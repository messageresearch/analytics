[32:25] Father, we come to you tonight just
[32:27] grateful and thankful, Lord, for another
[32:29] time that we can gather together, Lord,
[32:31] on this side of eternity. Lord Jesus,
[32:33] for all we know, this could be our last
[32:36] chance. Tomorrow, Lord, between 6:00 and
[32:38] 9:00, you could take us out of here.
[32:40] Lord, we just pray, dear God, tonight
[32:42] that you just move, dear God, upon these
[32:44] requests. And Lord, you saw the hands
[32:47] that was raised. And you know, dear God,
[32:49] what was behind those hands, we ask,
[32:51] dear Jesus, that you would just move
[32:52] down, Lord Jesus. Build the faith of the
[32:55] people tonight, Lord Jesus. May they be
[32:58] able to reach out by faith and receive
[33:00] what they have come for, Lord. They
[33:02] didn't come to see a man, Lord. They
[33:04] they come to see you. And we just pray,
[33:06] dear God, that you would just help them
[33:08] move out of the way. And may you just
[33:09] move on the scene and intervene for each
[33:11] one. Bless the request, dear God. Bless
[33:14] the man that would come here in a moment
[33:16] to minister. We just pray that thy
[33:18] anointing power would be upon him, dear
[33:20] God, to get out of the way and move upon
[33:22] the people, dear God. That your
[33:24] anointing power would fall upon them.
[33:26] That they would step out of the way and
[33:27] pull upon the gift, Lord, just move in a
[33:30] mighty way. And may each one be able to
[33:32] say later tonight, "Wasn't it good to be
[33:35] in the house of the Lord? Didn't he
[33:36] visit my pew? Didn't he visit my seat?
[33:39] Lord, just move in a mighty way." And
[33:41] we'll give you the praise, the glory,
[33:43] and honor in Jesus name.
[33:48] Oh, I reach my
[33:51] hands to the heavens. I lift my eyes

[48:50] Oh, you can't get any farther because
[48:54] you're just losing ground. But I'm not
[48:58] giving up. No, I'm not turning around.
[49:05] For by the grace of God, I'm going to
[49:08] wear a shining crown. Shine deck. Will I

[49:20] hand. And I'm not giving up. Oh, I'll
[49:25] keep going on.
[49:29] Now would you mind to tell me? You see,
[49:33] there's been something bothering
[49:36] me. Oh, why is it that old devil just
[49:41] won't let God's children be? Well, you
[49:45] see, it's purposed and determined to get
[49:50] right in the way. Oh, and turn us from
[49:55] the way of life and lead our souls
[49:59] astray. But I'm not giving up. Sister
[50:03] Hannah Wallace comes not turning
[50:07] around. For by the grace of God, I'm
[50:11] going to wear a shining crown.
[50:15] Someday. Well, I'll keep holding

[51:23] dance, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking
[51:28] it back.
[51:29] everything that the devil stole from
[51:36] me. One day, old King David came home to
[51:40] a city called
[51:43] Sig. And while he was gone, the enemy
[51:46] came and stole everything that he
[51:50] had. Well, David encouraged himself in
[51:54] the Lord. He made up his mind. He said,
[51:59] "I'm on my way down to his gave and I'm

[52:36] me. We all know that the devil only
[52:40] comes to kill, steal, and

[52:47] been times when he's taken away my
[52:51] joy. Well, I'm serving notice on the
[52:54] devil today. His kingdom is under
[52:58] attack. Cuz I'm on my way down to his
[53:02] gates and I'm taking my property back.

[53:48] when he's taking away my

[1:01:06] week is to pour his spirit out upon us.
[1:01:10] Amen. You don't have to beg him to do
[1:01:12] it. All you have to do is just have a
[1:01:14] hungry heart. Amen. And and he promised
[1:01:17] that he would feel us. Ain't that right?
[1:01:20] Amen. And uh we certainly love the Lord.

[1:01:45] claim everything that God has given to
[1:01:48] us. Amen. I know uh you know Christian
[1:01:51] life maybe it seems like Christians
[1:01:54] struggle. Amen. But it's born in them.
[1:01:58] Amen. Not to sit there and let the devil
[1:02:01] take everything from them and destroy
[1:02:04] their lives, but it's in them to fight.
[1:02:09] Amen. And we have been given the
[1:02:12] greatest message on the face of the
[1:02:15] earth. Not a man just preaching his
[1:02:19] ideas and giving us wishbones and but
[1:02:23] it's a word that has been open in this
[1:02:26] day. Our name is in that book. And every
[1:02:30] promise that God made us, our name is
[1:02:33] right there. Amen. And there's something
[1:02:36] down within us that are beginning to
[1:02:39] understand, amen, that I have a right. I
[1:02:42] don't have to be a victim to the devil.
[1:02:44] I don't care how much he fights. I don't
[1:02:46] care how much it seemed like it's dark
[1:02:49] and it's just dreary. I have a right to
[1:02:53] prevail over Satan's kingdom. And I
[1:02:56] believe that's what the Lord was trying
[1:02:57] to remind us last night. Amen. Is you've
[1:03:01] got a right to claim. Don't sit there
[1:03:03] and let the devil just run over you.

[1:03:08] thinking bad thoughts." Them ain't your
[1:03:10] thoughts. That's his thoughts. Amen.
[1:03:12] Well, I'm just uh You just don't know.
[1:03:14] I'm defeated. I have failed. I've done
[1:03:16] this. That has nothing to do with it.
[1:03:19] Look at the word of God and see what God
[1:03:21] says about you. Amen. I was thinking of
[1:03:25] Sister Hannah that was singing that
[1:03:27] song. I'm taking it back. And Amen.
[1:03:30] She's got a reason to say that song.
[1:03:32] Satan was almost trying to take her life
[1:03:35] and suicidal thoughts and depression.
[1:03:38] But God got a hold of her one night.
[1:03:41] Amen. And changed her. Amen. Broke the
[1:03:44] power of the enemy. Amen. And now she's

[1:04:05] behind. Amen. I'm fighting my way
[1:04:08] through this thing. And I'm willing to
[1:04:11] fight. I'm willing to lay my life down
[1:04:13] for this message that God has so
[1:04:16] graciously given to me. Amen. Do you
[1:04:19] love him? Can you give him a hand clap
[1:04:21] of
[1:04:23] praise? Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:04:25] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:04:29] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to read this
[1:04:32] and then we'll turn it to the minister.
[1:04:35] But brother Bram said, "Could you
[1:04:36] imagine the United States Army training
[1:04:39] a man to sit around and eat
[1:04:43] cookies and so forth?" Why? He gives him
[1:04:46] a uniform, his gun, and trains him to
[1:04:50] get out there and fight and defend the
[1:04:53] nation. And that's what we've got to do.
[1:04:56] We've got to defend our God-given
[1:04:59] rights. What God said, it's ours. Let's
[1:05:03] stand right toeto-toe with Satan. Say
[1:05:07] they're ours. How many believes that? We
[1:05:10] believe them. And you just might as well
[1:05:12] move back because you haven't got
[1:05:14] nothing at all. You haven't got Satan
[1:05:17] hasn't got one legal rights of anything.
[1:05:21] Everything he's got is defeated. And the
[1:05:25] only thing he is is a scarecrow. That's
[1:05:28] all. He cannot bother you. He cannot
[1:05:31] bother you.
[1:05:34] Come on. A man that's born of the spirit
[1:05:36] of God, there's nothing at all can harm
[1:05:39] him. Now, Satan can push things over on
[1:05:42] you and keep you uh just keep shoving
[1:05:46] you out and shoving you out. If I went
[1:05:48] to my house tomorrow night and I looked
[1:05:50] up there and there moved into my house
[1:05:53] was a big bunch of people and they were
[1:05:56] drunk prostitutes and carrying on. Why
[1:05:59] I'd put them out? Well, how you going to
[1:06:01] do it? They say I'm human. See, this is
[1:06:05] house is made for humans. I can live
[1:06:07] here, too. But I say this belongs to me.
[1:06:10] This is my legal possession. I've got an
[1:06:13] abstract deed here at the courthouse
[1:06:15] that shows this belongs to me and you
[1:06:18] cannot stay here any longer. And I'd
[1:06:21] serve notice on them and they'd have to
[1:06:24] move. And if they didn't, there's a a
[1:06:26] law downtown that'll make them move. Is
[1:06:29] that right? Well, anything that Satan
[1:06:33] put upon you in the way of sickness or
[1:06:36] whatever it is, you every bornagain
[1:06:39] person has an abstract has a warrant
[1:06:42] from God and the Holy Ghost is here to
[1:06:45] put any devil out.
[1:06:48] Do you believe that? No matter if he it
[1:06:51] is cancer, if he is tumor, cataract,
[1:06:55] we'd say arthoritis, we'd say whatever
[1:06:58] migraines, uh uh whatever it is, the
[1:07:01] Holy Spirit will put him out if you if
[1:07:04] you will serve notice on him in the name
[1:07:08] of Jesus Christ because he has no legal
[1:07:12] rights. I'm the Lord that health all thy
[1:07:15] disease. Is that right? He was wounded
[1:07:17] for our transgressions. With his
[1:07:19] stripes, we are healed. Is that right?
[1:07:22] But you've got to go over and take it.
[1:07:26] Can you say amen? Do you love the Lord?
[1:07:30] Well, let's stand to our feet. We're
[1:07:33] getting ready to hear the the word of
[1:07:35] the Lord. And and uh I tell you, there's
[1:07:38] warriors here tonight. Amen. And we're
[1:07:41] not fighting flesh and blood. We're
[1:07:43] fighting in the spiritual realm. And
[1:07:45] amen that preacher.
[1:07:47] Amen. The Bible says that he sent his
[1:07:50] word and he healed them of all their
[1:07:52] diseases. And the word of God is fixing
[1:07:54] to come forth. And the prophet taught us
[1:07:57] how it works. It ain't the preacher that
[1:07:58] works magic. He just preaches the word.
[1:08:01] We pull on that word by saying amen. And
[1:08:05] it's like saying sick. Sickum. Can you
[1:08:08] say amen? Amen. And I I just believe
[1:08:12] that the word is powerful. I want to say
[1:08:15] uh it's just good to have uh brother
[1:08:17] Matt Morris uh all the way from Arkansas
[1:08:21] and uh a a pastor there and and uh we've
[1:08:24] certainly grown to love and appreciate
[1:08:26] him and uh his ministry and just doing
[1:08:30] wonderful work and uh uh in the area
[1:08:33] that he is in and u um and it's just
[1:08:37] really good to have his family, his
[1:08:39] church here. Uh I know you've drove a
[1:08:42] long ways and uh but we just pray that
[1:08:45] God would just richly bless you, amen,
[1:08:48] for your effort to come and uh it's just
[1:08:51] a real honor to have you. And so as uh
[1:08:54] we we just want brother Matt take his
[1:08:55] time now. This is camp meeting, tent
[1:08:58] meeting, whatever you want to call it.
[1:08:59] In other words, we ain't in in no hurry.
[1:09:03] uh no time limits and uh just preach the
[1:09:06] way the Lord wants him to preach it and
[1:09:09] uh uh sing. He's a he's a a wonderful
[1:09:12] singer and uh so we just want him to
[1:09:14] feel at home and uh he's among the bride
[1:09:18] and we love the word. Amen. Amen. So

[1:09:42] Without

[1:10:11] Lord. Oh, without
[1:10:17] him I'd surely fail.
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:43] Oh, without
[1:10:46] [Music]

[1:12:01] it's good to see all of you tonight and
[1:12:03] and man it's just sure good to be in a
[1:12:05] in a in a tent meeting. Isn't it
[1:12:07] wonderful? Amen. We have a a tent
[1:12:09] meeting back at home and in the in the
[1:12:12] uh fall of the year and you know one of
[1:12:13] the brothers got a saying going. He said
[1:12:15] you can't get starchy in a tent. And so
[1:12:17] it's just kind of been the way it is.
[1:12:19] You know when you come to a tent you

[1:15:33] How many say he's all right tonight? He
[1:15:36] saved my soul. He filled me with the
[1:15:38] Holy Ghost. He never failed me. He's
[1:15:40] been an everpresent help in the time of
[1:15:42] trouble. And I say he's all right. He's
[1:15:45] an all right God. And he's worthy of our
[1:15:48] praise. We come down here tonight to
[1:15:51] have communion with our maker. And we
[1:15:53] invited him here. And when he comes into
[1:15:55] the tent tonight, we want him to know
[1:15:57] that he's welcome. So we say, "Lord,
[1:15:59] you're all right in my book. You're an
[1:16:01] awesome God. You made me. You created me
[1:16:04] in your image, and you gave me dominion
[1:16:06] over all the things that I face in this
[1:16:08] life." I said, "He's all right." How
[1:16:10] many say he's all right? Turn around,
[1:16:12] somebody tell them, "He's all
[1:16:14] right." Well, he didn't just save me, he

[1:16:52] Oh, I feel like praising the Lord

[1:16:56] through and through. I said,
[1:16:59] "He's Well, I know." When he filled me,
[1:17:03] he filled me through and through. I

[1:17:41] God that would be a help to you? And my
[1:17:44] I just thank God for all that he's done
[1:17:46] for us.
[1:17:47] I was just praying on the way here and
[1:17:49] getting ready for the service and I
[1:17:50] thought, Lord, I ain't nothing that I
[1:17:53] could have that would be a help to
[1:17:54] anybody. Nothing I could say that could
[1:17:56] help you, but if God would come by and
[1:17:57] minister to his children, we can leave
[1:17:59] and know we've all been helped. Amen.
[1:18:01] So, that's our desire tonight is to
[1:18:03] allow the Lord to have his way in this
[1:18:05] service. Amen. Amen. Just certainly a
[1:18:08] privilege to be able to serve the Lord
[1:18:10] with precious brothers and like precious
[1:18:12] faith. And Amen. May God bless each one
[1:18:15] of you tonight. How many has a need on
[1:18:16] their heart tonight? Maybe something
[1:18:18] that you just ask the Lord to come by
[1:18:20] and do for you. And some I know that God
[1:18:23] is certainly uh able to do uh all that
[1:18:27] we could ever ask him. And how many
[1:18:29] believes that that God is able? Amen. It
[1:18:32] doesn't matter what it looks like.
[1:18:33] Brother Sean was saying, doesn't matter
[1:18:34] how dark it gets or how hard the battle
[1:18:37] gets, we serve a God that is able. And
[1:18:39] you know, I think about that often. You
[1:18:40] know, God, not only is our God able, but
[1:18:43] he's also willing. So to have a God
[1:18:45] that's willing and able. We've got we've
[1:18:47] got an answer to our prayer. Amen. And
[1:18:49] so won't we just in invite him to come
[1:18:52] tonight. May you just bow your head
[1:18:53] together and if you have something on
[1:18:55] your heart, just lift your hand to the
[1:18:56] Lord and ask him that he would come by
[1:18:58] our way. Amen. Gracious heavenly father,
[1:19:02] Lord, what a privilege it is to serve
[1:19:05] you. Lord, as sons and daughters of God,
[1:19:08] Lord, we come gathered in this tent
[1:19:10] tonight. And Lord, what a lovely
[1:19:12] atmosphere, Lord is here. And Lord, a
[1:19:16] perfect place, Lord, for you to come and
[1:19:19] have fellowship with the bride of Jesus
[1:19:21] Christ. Lord, we realize our weaknesses
[1:19:24] and our failures and the inabilities of
[1:19:27] our flesh. But Lord, we didn't come here
[1:19:30] relying upon our own efforts, Lord, but
[1:19:32] we come to surrender to you. Lord, we
[1:19:35] ask you that you would have your way in
[1:19:36] this meeting tonight. God, you know
[1:19:38] every heart, every need, Lord. God, we
[1:19:41] come to you tonight. Lord, you know the
[1:19:43] very hour that we're living in. And
[1:19:45] Lord, we just ask you that you would
[1:19:47] come and you would meet each one of us
[1:19:48] here, Lord. God, as we find ourselves
[1:19:51] here at the foot of the cross, Lord, we
[1:19:54] ask, Lord, that you would meet each
[1:19:55] need. Lord, I pray something would be
[1:19:57] said to encourage the bride, Lord, that
[1:19:59] we would leave this place, Lord, knowing
[1:20:01] that we had been in your presence, Lord.
[1:20:03] And Lord, we'll be so careful to give
[1:20:06] you the glory for all that you've done
[1:20:07] here tonight. We thank you for it. Lord,
[1:20:09] we ask you to anoint this word in Jesus
[1:20:12] Christ's name we pray.
[1:20:15] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. We
[1:20:17] just want to invite you in the scripture
[1:20:20] to the book of of John and we're going
[1:20:22] to read out of the ninth chapter and
[1:20:24] we'll go from the first verse, John 9
[1:20:28] and one.
[1:20:29] Just want to bring you greetings from
[1:20:31] our home church there in Arkansas and I
[1:20:35] know several of them are on the uh
[1:20:37] service tonight and some many that came
[1:20:40] out. Appreciate all of the efforts to
[1:20:42] come to the meeting
[1:20:43] and
[1:20:46] Amen. Just give you a moment to to get
[1:20:49] there. John the 9th chapter in the first
[1:20:52] B uh verse and just something the Lord
[1:20:54] has really been pressing on my heart and
[1:20:56] I know you can't ever go wrong when you
[1:20:58] just follow the leadership of the Lord.
[1:20:59] Amen. Amen. So we'll just read John the
[1:21:02] 9th chapter the first verse. The Bible
[1:21:04] said, "And as Jesus passed by, he saw a
[1:21:07] man which was blind from his birth. And
[1:21:09] his disciples asked him, saying, Master,
[1:21:11] who did sin that this man or his parents
[1:21:14] that he was born blind?" And Jesus
[1:21:16] answered, "Neither hath this man sin,
[1:21:18] nor his parents, but that the works of
[1:21:21] God should be made manifest in him. For
[1:21:23] I must work the works of him that sent
[1:21:26] me, and while it is day, for the night
[1:21:29] cometh, when no man can work. But as
[1:21:31] long as I am in the world, I am the
[1:21:33] light of the world." And when he had
[1:21:35] thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and
[1:21:37] he made clay of spittle, and he anointed
[1:21:38] the eyes of the blind man with the clay.
[1:21:41] And he said unto him, "Go wash in the
[1:21:43] pool of Saleom, which is by
[1:21:45] interpretation sent." And he went his
[1:21:48] way, therefore, and he washed, and he
[1:21:50] came seeing. And we'll just ask the Lord
[1:21:52] to add his blessing to the reading of
[1:21:54] the word tonight. And I would like to
[1:21:56] speak on this subject as you take your
[1:21:58] seats on the healer, the believer, and
[1:22:01] the
[1:22:02] Pharisee. The healer, the believer, and
[1:22:04] the Pharisee. Here in our opening
[1:22:07] scripture, I found uh one of the great
[1:22:09] stories of the Bible. As we would read
[1:22:11] through this story and uh you know, you
[1:22:13] can find that this is a story of
[1:22:15] salvation. It's a story of healing, a
[1:22:18] story of perseverance. It's a story of
[1:22:21] revelation. Uh it's a story of
[1:22:23] compassion. There's many things that we
[1:22:25] could take uh out of this story in the
[1:22:27] John the 9th chapter. And you know, I've
[1:22:29] always loved uh this testimony of this
[1:22:31] blind man because uh he had a condition
[1:22:34] that he carried from his birth. And you
[1:22:36] know uh when you think about this man's
[1:22:39] condition, I always thought that that
[1:22:40] was something that applied to all of us.
[1:22:42] See uh each one of us, we were born
[1:22:44] under the same kind of birth. We all
[1:22:46] came uh into the world the same way and
[1:22:48] each one of us was born in the same
[1:22:50] spiritual condition. And so uh we can
[1:22:52] always find oursel in this story because
[1:22:55] uh we were born under the curse of this
[1:22:57] flesh. And but then the story tells us
[1:22:59] what takes place when a man with this
[1:23:01] condition meets Jesus. I think that's
[1:23:03] wonderful here. This man is sitting as a
[1:23:06] blind man over on the side of the road.
[1:23:08] And the Bible says, "But when Jesus
[1:23:10] passed by him, he saw him." I thought
[1:23:12] that's just wonderful right there.
[1:23:14] Here's a man that couldn't see, but
[1:23:15] Jesus saw him. Isn't that the way it is
[1:23:17] when when you didn't know he was there,
[1:23:18] but he saw you all along? And and so he
[1:23:21] saw him and the disciples began to ask.
[1:23:23] They said, "Lord, who sin that would
[1:23:24] cause this man to be born blind." And
[1:23:26] I'm sure when they got to talking about
[1:23:28] him that all of a sudden it got his
[1:23:30] attention that here he couldn't see what
[1:23:32] was going on. But he could hear him as
[1:23:33] they would talk about his condition and
[1:23:35] say, "Lord, you know, here sets a man
[1:23:37] that's blind and what happened to him?
[1:23:38] Why is he blind? Did he do something
[1:23:40] wrong? Did something happen? Uh did his
[1:23:43] parents do something wrong?" And here,
[1:23:44] although he couldn't see what was going
[1:23:46] on, I'm sure I'm sure his ears perked up
[1:23:48] whenever they got to talking about his
[1:23:50] condition and and where he was. And I,
[1:23:52] you know, I thought here he was sitting
[1:23:54] there and all of a sudden he heard the
[1:23:56] words of Jesus for the first time. He
[1:23:57] heard the voice of Jesus. And the words
[1:23:59] that he spoke was, "This man has never
[1:24:02] sinned. It wasn't nothing that he done.
[1:24:04] It wasn't his fault. It wasn't his
[1:24:07] cause." He said, "But he was born this
[1:24:09] way so that the works of God could be
[1:24:11] made manifested in him." I thought what
[1:24:13] faith it must have gave him that day to
[1:24:15] hear Jesus say it was that God's works
[1:24:17] might be manifested in him and Jesus
[1:24:19] told him he and the Bible said he made
[1:24:21] clay and he put it on his eye he said go
[1:24:23] wash in the pool of Saleom the Bible
[1:24:25] said he went and he washed and he came
[1:24:27] see you know I thought this wonderful
[1:24:29] here this man comes back he as he obeyed
[1:24:31] the Lord and when he come back from that
[1:24:33] place the people they they they would
[1:24:35] look at him and you know here he had
[1:24:37] been changed he had been uh uh healed of
[1:24:39] his condition but when people would look
[1:24:41] at And they said, "You know, that looks
[1:24:43] like that boy that used to sit by the
[1:24:45] wayside. You remember the blind boy that
[1:24:46] used to be in that condition? You
[1:24:48] remember the boy that was born in that
[1:24:49] condition? He used to sit by the way
[1:24:51] over there and beg. But don't he look an
[1:24:53] awful lot like him?" And as he spoke up,
[1:24:55] he said, "No, it's me. It's me. I I'm
[1:24:57] the one that was there. It was me that
[1:24:59] was blind." See, and he looked a little
[1:25:01] different. You know, he may maybe he
[1:25:02] maybe he didn't have that same old
[1:25:04] beggar clothes. He He could walk. He
[1:25:06] could see straight. He could see
[1:25:07] differently. He didn't stumble around
[1:25:09] anymore. He he he could walk upright. He
[1:25:12] he he kind of walked with a little sense
[1:25:13] of pride that he didn't used to
[1:25:15] have. And he said, "Well, you know, it
[1:25:17] looks a lot like him." He said, "No,
[1:25:19] it's me." And you know, as he would
[1:25:21] begin to tell his testimony, I love as
[1:25:23] he begins to talk to them and and they
[1:25:25] would ask this question, "What happened
[1:25:26] to you? What you know, I wonder how many
[1:25:28] times that somebody met you out out in
[1:25:30] the world and say, you know, what
[1:25:31] happened to you? I remember what it used
[1:25:32] to be like, but what something's changed
[1:25:34] about you? You're a little different
[1:25:35] than you used to be." And and he got an
[1:25:37] opportunity to share his testimony. And
[1:25:39] he said, you know, he said, I he said,
[1:25:41] how? He said, I was sitting there one
[1:25:42] day and a man called Jesus came by my
[1:25:45] way and he made some clay out of the
[1:25:47] ground and he had put it on my eyes and
[1:25:48] he anointed in my eyes and he told me to
[1:25:51] go to the pool and wash and and I would
[1:25:53] receive my side. And you know what I
[1:25:54] did? I obeyed the word of the Lord and I
[1:25:56] went down to the pool and I washed and I
[1:25:58] came back seeing. But friends, it wasn't
[1:26:00] enough to satisfy them. They got to
[1:26:02] questioning in their heart what was
[1:26:04] taking place. It was something
[1:26:06] supernatural. It was something beyond
[1:26:08] their understanding. I thought many
[1:26:09] times that's the way it is when we look
[1:26:11] at somebody. Only God could have changed
[1:26:13] that man. It it would take the
[1:26:14] supernatural to change that life cuz I
[1:26:17] know the condition that he was in. So
[1:26:19] there was something that was beyond
[1:26:20] their understanding. And so they brought
[1:26:22] him to the house of the Pharisee and
[1:26:24] they asked and the Pharisees began to
[1:26:26] ask him, "What do you say of the man
[1:26:28] that opened your eyes?" I love how he
[1:26:30] responds. He wasn't ashamed of nothing.
[1:26:32] He said, "I say that man was a prophet."
[1:26:34] They said, 'Well, how can you say he's a
[1:26:36] prophet?' He said, 'Well, let me tell
[1:26:37] you how. Cuz he told me if I go to the
[1:26:39] pool and I wash and I and I obey the
[1:26:42] word of God, then when I wash and I'm
[1:26:44] going to get out of the water, then I'm
[1:26:46] going to have my son. He said, and I
[1:26:48] went down to the pool and I washed just
[1:26:50] like he said and I came back seeing.
[1:26:52] See, only a prophet could know that if I
[1:26:55] obeyed the word of the Lord that I would
[1:26:56] come back with my sight. And the very
[1:26:58] thing he said would happen, it happened
[1:27:00] in my life. He says, he says, "So I say
[1:27:02] he's a prophet." Well, you know, you
[1:27:04] know what they done? They couldn't
[1:27:05] handle they couldn't swallow that. So
[1:27:06] the Pharisees begin to talk among
[1:27:08] themselves and they they would ask him,
[1:27:10] they said, "Well, you know what? I don't
[1:27:12] even know if this man ever was blind to
[1:27:14] begin with. Maybe maybe he wasn't even
[1:27:16] ever in that condition. You know what?
[1:27:17] Maybe this old testimony is just a farce
[1:27:20] and and it's all made up." And so they
[1:27:22] called his parents down by the way and
[1:27:24] they and they asked him. They said, "Was
[1:27:25] he blind?" He said, "Well, he was
[1:27:27] certainly blind." And but and they said,
[1:27:28] "Well, won't you tell us how he received
[1:27:30] his sight?" But you know what the Bible
[1:27:31] said? It said the Jews had agreed
[1:27:33] already that if a man would confess
[1:27:35] Jesus Christ, he would be put out of the
[1:27:37] synagogue. So his parents, they wouldn't
[1:27:39] stand behind his testimony because they
[1:27:42] didn't want to have that kind of
[1:27:43] confession. So when they were put on the
[1:27:45] spot, they said, "Well, we don't know.
[1:27:46] Why don't you just ask him? He's of
[1:27:48] age." And so they got they turned back
[1:27:50] to him and they said, "Well, I'll tell
[1:27:52] you what. We we we they came up with a
[1:27:54] way that everybody could agree on it."
[1:27:56] They said, "Why don't you just give God
[1:27:58] the praise and leave this man's name out
[1:28:00] of it?" I tell you, if you'll just give
[1:28:02] God the praise and you'll leave this man
[1:28:04] out of it, then we can go along with
[1:28:05] you. Won't you just give the glory to
[1:28:07] God? For we know this man ain't nothing
[1:28:09] but a sinner cuz he tries to take the
[1:28:11] place of God. You know what he said? He
[1:28:13] said, "Whether he be a sinner or not, I
[1:28:15] don't know." He said, "But one thing I
[1:28:17] do know is one day I was blind and the
[1:28:20] next day I could see." They said, "Well,
[1:28:22] how does this man open the eyes of the
[1:28:25] blind?" He said, "I don't know how he
[1:28:27] does it. All I know is that he does it.
[1:28:29] I don't know how he does it. All I know
[1:28:31] is that he does it." And the Bible said
[1:28:33] they got angry with him. They reviled
[1:28:35] him. They bered him. They mocked him.
[1:28:38] They made fun of him. And finally, they
[1:28:40] got rid of him. They threw him out of
[1:28:42] the church on the outside of the city.
[1:28:45] But the Bible said, "But Jesus heard
[1:28:47] that they had cast him out and he came
[1:28:50] down and he when he found him, you know
[1:28:53] what it means for Jesus to find you? It
[1:28:56] means he was looking for you."
[1:28:58] He said, "And when he found him, he
[1:29:01] said, do you believe on the son of God?"
[1:29:03] I love this man's answer. He said,
[1:29:05] "Well, who is he, Lord, that I might
[1:29:08] believe on him?" See, he didn't deny
[1:29:10] that God would have a son. He didn't
[1:29:13] deny that the very creator of heaven and
[1:29:16] earth that was only known in spirit that
[1:29:19] they had all heard of but yet they had
[1:29:21] never seen that he would have a son upon
[1:29:24] the earth in a human body. The very
[1:29:26] thing that seemed so unbelievable to the
[1:29:29] world yet this man did not deny. He said
[1:29:32] but who is he Lord that I might believe
[1:29:35] on him? And Jesus answered and he said
[1:29:37] unto him thou hast both seen him and it
[1:29:40] is he that talkth with thee. Oh, I love
[1:29:43] what he said.
[1:29:45] He said, "Lord, I believe."
[1:29:49] And he fell down and he worshiped him.
[1:29:52] I wonder how many believers that we have
[1:29:54] here tonight. I wonder how many
[1:29:56] believers that they that could say,
[1:29:58] "Lord, I believe and I've come to
[1:30:01] worship you. Lord, I'm a believer and I
[1:30:04] come to worship you." I think what a
[1:30:06] response it was of a believer. I might
[1:30:09] not be able to explain it all, but
[1:30:11] there's something in me that makes me
[1:30:13] believe. Friends, let me tell you
[1:30:14] something I find wonderful about being a
[1:30:16] believer. In order to be a believer,
[1:30:18] there's never been a requirement that
[1:30:20] you had to be a teacher. In order to be
[1:30:21] a believer, there's no requirement that
[1:30:23] you have to be a preacher. To be a
[1:30:25] believer, you don't have to be an
[1:30:26] evangelist. You don't have to be a
[1:30:28] prophet. You don't have to be a great
[1:30:30] man. There's never been a God- called
[1:30:32] man or woman that's ever done anything
[1:30:34] for the Lord that wasn't first a
[1:30:36] believer in God. You know, I think I
[1:30:38] think, well, we may as well preach
[1:30:40] anyway. We're in a tent meeting. I get
[1:30:42] so tired of seeing people put under so
[1:30:44] much pressure to be a somebody. It seems
[1:30:46] like everybody's trying to make anybody
[1:30:48] a somebody. And they put so much
[1:30:50] pressure. I think the church puts more
[1:30:52] pressure on people sometimes than the
[1:30:54] world puts on them. It's a pressure to
[1:30:56] perform, a pressure to speak in tongues,
[1:30:58] a pressure to prophesy. But let me tell
[1:31:00] you what happens when you get under that
[1:31:02] kind of pressure. You fail to focus. you
[1:31:05] lose focus on the calling that God
[1:31:07] placed in your life. But let me tell you
[1:31:08] what my Bible said. It never said that
[1:31:10] all things are possible to them that
[1:31:12] prophesy. Or if you can speak in tongues
[1:31:15] that all things are possible. Or if you
[1:31:17] can sing that all things are possible.
[1:31:19] Or if you can preach, then all things
[1:31:20] are possible. But my Bible said if thou
[1:31:23] canst believe, then all things are
[1:31:26] possible to them that believe. See,
[1:31:28] that's our calling in the church of the
[1:31:30] living God. Our calling is first to be a
[1:31:32] believer. That's what the Bible said. He
[1:31:34] said, "Make your calling and election
[1:31:36] sure." You know what the Bible was
[1:31:37] talking about? That calling come from
[1:31:39] the Greek word cliches, which meant the
[1:31:42] call or the summons of God to be a
[1:31:44] follower of God and accept his gift of
[1:31:47] salvation and all of the blessings that
[1:31:49] go along with it. So, so make your
[1:31:51] calling and election sure that God had a
[1:31:54] divine purpose of your life to be able
[1:31:56] to accept the very message of the hour.
[1:31:58] I've made my call. I want to know how
[1:31:59] many tonight could say, "I've made my
[1:32:01] calling." And intellectually sure, I am
[1:32:04] a believer.
[1:32:06] I thank God for preachers. Without them,
[1:32:07] we wouldn't be here. I thank God for
[1:32:09] evangelism. Without evangelists, we
[1:32:11] never would have heard the call. I thank
[1:32:13] God for good pastors. Without pastors,
[1:32:15] we'd be sheep that was scattered in the
[1:32:17] field. But you know what? I thank God
[1:32:19] for all the singers. I thank God for the
[1:32:21] musicians that would come and sing and
[1:32:23] create an atmosphere where the word of
[1:32:25] God can go forth. How needed is it? And
[1:32:27] I thank God for those that would come,
[1:32:29] men and women that would come and serve
[1:32:31] the Lord. They prepare meals for
[1:32:32] meetings like this. There's brothers
[1:32:34] that turn on the lights. There's
[1:32:35] brothers that runs sound. There's
[1:32:37] sisters that take care of children. All
[1:32:39] the things that happens, the labor that
[1:32:41] is taking place just to be able to have
[1:32:43] a meeting like this or a meeting with
[1:32:45] God. But you know what I'm so thankful
[1:32:48] for the most? I'm thankful for
[1:32:50] believers.
[1:32:51] You know why? Cuz without believers, you
[1:32:53] would never see a miracle. Without
[1:32:55] believers, you never see the
[1:32:56] supernatural. Without believers, you
[1:32:59] never see the hand of God. But when you
[1:33:00] get believers together, you're going to
[1:33:02] see God move. When you get believers
[1:33:04] together, you can see the supernatural.
[1:33:06] Believers come together, it brings a
[1:33:08] resurrection in the church. Friends, I
[1:33:10] got news for you. There's enough
[1:33:11] skeptics. There's enough critics.
[1:33:13] There's enough naysayers. But what about
[1:33:15] some believers that believe in the
[1:33:17] supernatural and the power of God and
[1:33:20] the presence of the Holy Ghost? Brother
[1:33:22] said, "I believe he's here now. I
[1:33:24] believe the Holy Spirit is here because
[1:33:26] he does the same thing that he always
[1:33:28] does. He said, "So we don't have to be
[1:33:30] suspicious anymore because our suspicion
[1:33:33] only hinders the other believers." He
[1:33:35] said, "But what about we just get in one
[1:33:36] accord and say, God, we thank you for
[1:33:39] sending the Holy Ghost and we believe it
[1:33:41] and it's you and we accept you and we
[1:33:43] don't think it's spiritualism or some
[1:33:45] spook, but we believe it's you because
[1:33:47] the scripture said so. You promised it
[1:33:49] and I'm here to receive it cuz I am a
[1:33:53] believer.
[1:33:55] How many believers we have here tonight?
[1:33:59] Our story has three main characters.
[1:34:01] There's a healer, a believer, and a
[1:34:03] Pharisee. Brother Daryl, you know, the
[1:34:05] more I thought about this story, the
[1:34:06] more I realized that it didn't end in
[1:34:09] John the 9th chapter. It didn't end in
[1:34:11] the days of Jesus or even in the days of
[1:34:14] the disciples. But as you read through
[1:34:16] the Bible, you'll notice that these
[1:34:18] characters continue to appear. You can
[1:34:21] see him down there at the gate when
[1:34:23] Peter and John met the lame man and that
[1:34:26] Peter looked at him. He said, "Silver
[1:34:27] and gold have I none, but such as I
[1:34:29] have, I give unto thee. In the name of
[1:34:31] Jesus Christ, rise up and walk." You
[1:34:33] know what that man? He could have sat in
[1:34:35] his condition. He could have he could
[1:34:37] have not got up. He could have argued.
[1:34:38] He could have fallen. But the Bible
[1:34:40] says, "But he leaping stood up and he
[1:34:42] walked and entered with him into the
[1:34:44] temple walking and leaping and praising
[1:34:46] God." We find him again in Apostle Paul
[1:34:48] who was a Pharisee. But by the angel of
[1:34:51] the Lord, his eyes became open and Paul
[1:34:54] became a believer. And the Bible says
[1:34:55] that same Paul that miracles were worked
[1:34:58] at at Paul's hands in so much that from
[1:35:00] his body they took aprons and the sick
[1:35:03] was healed and diseases departed from
[1:35:05] people because of the healing or the
[1:35:07] miracles uh that was in in Paul's life.
[1:35:10] We see these all through the scripture
[1:35:12] even even in the second century. We see
[1:35:14] this this this great Pharisee in the
[1:35:16] second century when when the Roman
[1:35:18] Catholic Church would come to take the
[1:35:20] name of Jesus out of water baptism. you
[1:35:22] you can read it in their own
[1:35:23] encyclopedia of uh the Catholic
[1:35:25] encyclopedia volume 2 page 263. It says
[1:35:28] the baptismal formula was changed from
[1:35:30] the name of Jesus Christ to the words
[1:35:33] father son and holy spirit by the
[1:35:34] catholic church in the second century.
[1:35:37] In other words, you can say god did it
[1:35:39] but we just don't want his name
[1:35:41] involved. So so we we we see this all
[1:35:44] through time. We continue to see this
[1:35:46] same this same uh characters. They they
[1:35:49] showed up in Zurich in Switzerland when
[1:35:50] brother Brandon would talk about brother
[1:35:52] Billy Graham and he went over and
[1:35:53] preached the meetings and and and he
[1:35:55] preached on the supreme deity of Jesus
[1:35:57] Christ. He said when he left they put an
[1:35:59] article in the paper and said he wasn't
[1:36:01] nothing but an American soap salesman.
[1:36:03] He went right behind him in in Brother
[1:36:05] Bam's meetings. There was miracles with
[1:36:07] miracles and signs and and wonders in
[1:36:09] the very meetings that Brother Bam had.
[1:36:11] They proved the very thing that Brother
[1:36:13] Billy Graham was preaching. It it proved
[1:36:15] the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. But
[1:36:18] you know what they did? They put an
[1:36:19] article in the paper and said he's
[1:36:21] nothing but an American soothsayer come
[1:36:23] in to get all these people worked up and
[1:36:25] and some spook or something. He said,
[1:36:27] "But notice Jesus Christ, he came as a
[1:36:29] prophet like John Billy Graham. He was
[1:36:31] preaching repentance and then he come
[1:36:33] back around in an oldfashioned campaign
[1:36:35] of heal the sick and prophesy and all of
[1:36:38] the different signs and wonders. But
[1:36:40] it's still the same ungodly Pharisee
[1:36:43] spirit that lives out yonder in a church
[1:36:45] atmosphere instead of under the shakina
[1:36:48] glory. You hear what the prophet saying
[1:36:50] that the Pharisee was not a person but
[1:36:53] the Pharisee was a spirit. Hello
[1:36:55] somebody. So here he said it's a spirit
[1:36:57] and I got news for you. This spirit of
[1:36:59] the Pharisee is a spirit of unbelief in
[1:37:02] the deity of Jesus Christ. It's an
[1:37:04] ungodly spirit that refuses the shakana
[1:37:07] glory. And by reputation, the Pharisee,
[1:37:09] he's a critical spirit. He's a jealous
[1:37:11] spirit. He's a selfish spirit. And
[1:37:13] friends, I got news for you tonight that
[1:37:16] that Pharisee, he may challenge the
[1:37:18] healer, but he'll never stop the
[1:37:19] believers. I say, "God is still a
[1:37:22] healer." I wonder how many tonight say,
[1:37:24] "God is still a healer." How many can
[1:37:26] raise your hand tonight and say, "I know
[1:37:28] God is still a healer." I could pass
[1:37:31] this microphone around and every one of
[1:37:33] us can tell testimonies of God being a
[1:37:35] healer. I'm sure we could we could get a
[1:37:37] thousand testimonies tonight of of
[1:37:39] things that God has done because God is
[1:37:41] still a healer.
[1:37:43] You know, here few months ago or couple
[1:37:45] years back, me and a and a brother in
[1:37:47] the church, a lady in in town was trying
[1:37:49] to sell a house. And so he wanted me to
[1:37:51] go over there and look at it with him.
[1:37:52] And and so we went we went in the house
[1:37:54] and, you know, kind of looking around to
[1:37:55] see what kind of house it was and such.
[1:37:57] And we walked in, of course, we go back
[1:37:59] through the rooms and and I noticed back
[1:38:01] in the back bedroom there was a picture
[1:38:02] of Brother Brandham on one of the walls.
[1:38:04] I never knew the lady. So, you know, I
[1:38:06] walked back out. You know, our
[1:38:08] conversation just changed. And and I
[1:38:10] walked back and I said, "Ma'am, I
[1:38:11] noticed that you had a a picture of
[1:38:12] Brother Benham back there in in one of
[1:38:14] the bedrooms." I said, "I thought that
[1:38:16] was quite nice." She said, "Oh, that's a
[1:38:17] that's a family heirloom that's been
[1:38:19] passed down from my mother to me." And
[1:38:20] and she said, "You know, there's a story
[1:38:22] behind that picture." I said, "Well,
[1:38:24] there is. I I wouldn't mind hearing
[1:38:25] that." And and she said, "Well," and she
[1:38:27] got to telling me, "She's an elder lady.
[1:38:29] Her husband had passed away, a widow
[1:38:31] lady there." and and uh and she said,
[1:38:33] "You know, my mother," she said, "Back
[1:38:35] uh many years ago." And and my mother
[1:38:38] had been diagnosed in Jonesboro with
[1:38:40] tuberculosis. And back in Arkansas,
[1:38:42] there wasn't very many places you could
[1:38:44] go when you had tuberculosis. Remember,
[1:38:46] it was a great pandemic. And and and so
[1:38:48] she said my mom had had made an
[1:38:51] appointment at I believe it was in
[1:38:53] Benton or somewhere in Arkansas where
[1:38:54] they had the sanatorium where they would
[1:38:56] send people. But the problem was is that
[1:38:58] there was so many people that had the
[1:38:59] disease and that there wasn't enough
[1:39:01] beds for people to go. And so here she
[1:39:03] was on the list on a waiting list to get
[1:39:05] on the bed. And and so here in the in
[1:39:07] the days that had gone by in the time of
[1:39:09] waiting and and she had listened to
[1:39:11] radio programs and they got to
[1:39:13] advertising meetings and got you know
[1:39:15] had some temper bibles like this and got
[1:39:17] to advertise the meetings and and she
[1:39:18] started hearing testimonies and meetings
[1:39:20] that was taking place in brother Bram's
[1:39:22] meetings and or healings and and and and
[1:39:25] so she went to her husband and something
[1:39:26] just kind of sparked in her. She went to
[1:39:28] him and she said, you know, she said, "I
[1:39:29] I heard about this this person that got
[1:39:31] healed. They were giving their testimony
[1:39:33] down there in Corning, Arkansas that got
[1:39:35] healed and this other person from over
[1:39:37] in West Memphis that got healed and and
[1:39:38] she was hearing about all these
[1:39:39] testimonies. She got excited and she
[1:39:41] went telling her husband, you know,
[1:39:42] maybe if I can go down to that meeting,
[1:39:44] you know, they say this man's a prophet.
[1:39:45] He's got quite a gift of healing on his
[1:39:47] life and man, if we could just go to the
[1:39:49] meeting then then then I then maybe God
[1:39:51] would heal me, too. And her husband
[1:39:52] said, "Well, well, you know, that that's
[1:39:54] just a thing to" and this is the lady's
[1:39:56] testimony. She said, "But you know, he
[1:39:58] just kind of felt like it was all for
[1:39:59] the money. they just done it to take up
[1:40:00] offerings and stuff like that. And he
[1:40:02] said, "No, we ain't going to have no
[1:40:03] part of that. We've already got her
[1:40:05] appointment set and we're on the list at
[1:40:07] the at the doctor and and so she just
[1:40:09] got to praying." He said, "She or she
[1:40:10] said she she just prayed and asked the
[1:40:12] Lord and it became a burden on her heart
[1:40:13] and the more she listened to it and the
[1:40:15] more testimonies, the more the faith
[1:40:17] build and and so she began to call out
[1:40:19] to the Lord, Lord, would you make a way
[1:40:20] that I could go to the meeting?" And and
[1:40:22] so here it came down at the the time
[1:40:25] that this meeting was advertised and and
[1:40:27] they got a phone call from the doctor
[1:40:29] and they said that your bed is
[1:40:30] available. They've got a room for you uh
[1:40:32] and to be able to come and and so so she
[1:40:35] you know she went out that night. She
[1:40:36] said my mom wept and prayed all night
[1:40:38] asking the Lord that he would change my
[1:40:40] dad's mind that the next morning that he
[1:40:42] would take her to that meeting. They
[1:40:44] were supposed to go to the doctor. So
[1:40:46] the next day she said she prayed all
[1:40:48] night. The next day she got up and she
[1:40:49] even took her Sunday dress with her and
[1:40:51] packed it in the in the luggage because
[1:40:53] she wanted to make sure that the Lord
[1:40:55] was going to answer her prayer and he
[1:40:56] was going to take her to the meeting.
[1:40:57] She said, "I believe if I go to that
[1:40:59] meeting," she went down, told her
[1:41:00] husband. She said, "We need to go to the
[1:41:01] meeting. I really believe that if I can
[1:41:03] never get to that meeting, I'm going to
[1:41:04] receive my healing. I believe that
[1:41:06] that's a prophet of God. I've heard
[1:41:07] enough testimonies. I there's something
[1:41:09] in me. I believe that God can take this
[1:41:11] take this condition from me." But you
[1:41:13] know what her husband done? He said,
[1:41:14] "I'm not going to fall for it. We've
[1:41:16] already got an ab. been waiting a long
[1:41:18] time for a bed. If we miss it now, we'll
[1:41:20] never be able to get it. He put her in
[1:41:22] the car and he drove her to the
[1:41:23] hospital. She said she cried the whole
[1:41:26] way to that hospital saying, "Lord, I'm
[1:41:28] so sorry. I tried to tell him and I
[1:41:30] tried to get there and I know you put it
[1:41:32] on my heart to go, but let me tell you
[1:41:34] what happened." She said, "My mom went
[1:41:35] into the hospital and the doctors came
[1:41:37] in and they they ran the test on her for
[1:41:40] tuberculosis and the doctor came back
[1:41:41] into her room. He said, "Ma'am, I don't
[1:41:43] know what doctor in Jonesboro ever told
[1:41:45] you that you had tuberculosis." He said,
[1:41:47] "But you're perfectly well. There ain't
[1:41:49] nothing wrong with you at all." I
[1:41:51] thought my here this woman that there
[1:41:53] wasn't nobody there. Here she weep all
[1:41:55] night. But the Bible said weeping shall
[1:41:58] endure for a night, but joy cometh in
[1:42:00] the morning. There wasn't nobody there
[1:42:02] that could lay hands on her. There was
[1:42:03] no one there to motivate her. There was
[1:42:05] no one there to encourage her, but still
[1:42:08] yet in her was the ability to be able to
[1:42:10] receive her healing. I say tonight, our
[1:42:12] characters are very much alive. There's
[1:42:15] a Pharisee. There's a healer. And
[1:42:17] there's a believer. They were alive in
[1:42:19] John the 9th chapter. They were alive
[1:42:21] through the age of the apostles. They
[1:42:23] were alive in the dark ages. They were
[1:42:25] alive in the days of brother Brandham.
[1:42:26] And they're still alive today. And I've
[1:42:28] got news for you this or tonight that
[1:42:30] you don't have to look very far to find
[1:42:32] them. You can look in the church world
[1:42:34] and you can find them scattered around.
[1:42:36] And there's a whole lot more of one than
[1:42:37] there is of the other. Matter of fact,
[1:42:39] you can go to your local churches and
[1:42:41] you'll find all three of them. You can
[1:42:42] go down to my church and you'll find all
[1:42:44] three of them. You can go to every
[1:42:46] meeting and all three of them will be in
[1:42:48] the meeting. Even in this meeting
[1:42:49] tonight, you'll find a Pharisee and a
[1:42:52] healer and a believer. They're all three
[1:42:54] present. Everywhere you go, they're
[1:42:56] going to be there. You say, "Brother
[1:42:57] Matt, how do you know that?" Let me tell
[1:42:59] you how I know. Cuz brother Brown said,
[1:43:01] "We are a triune being. We're made up of
[1:43:04] body, soul, and spirit." Can I tell you
[1:43:05] a little about it tonight? He said, "And
[1:43:07] in you is a soul, and that soul belonged
[1:43:09] to God before the foundation of the
[1:43:12] world." He said, "But the that real
[1:43:13] ordained of God, that real gene, the
[1:43:16] germ, the soul of God that was in God
[1:43:18] before the foundation of the world." He
[1:43:20] said, "See, it's not it's not who you
[1:43:22] are, but but it's not what you are, but
[1:43:25] it's who you are." See, if your soul was
[1:43:27] a part of God, then it's been seeking
[1:43:30] God, and God's been seeking it. And
[1:43:32] that's why you were never satisfied in
[1:43:34] this world because you always were a
[1:43:36] part of God. That's why you hungered and
[1:43:38] thirsted for another life because you
[1:43:40] always were a part of God. And and then
[1:43:42] when you heard the word, that believer
[1:43:44] in you that was always a part of God. It
[1:43:47] responded to the word of God. And
[1:43:49] brother Bham said, "Now it's a finished
[1:43:51] thing with God, it's already settled."
[1:43:53] He said, "Every believer was sealed with
[1:43:55] this promise from the very beginning."
[1:43:57] Because before the foundation of the
[1:43:58] world, we were predestinated under the
[1:44:01] adoption of sons before the world ever
[1:44:03] began. He said, "I pray that the master
[1:44:07] would pick up that faith that you've got
[1:44:09] and streak across the word and may the
[1:44:12] tune come back in your ear that thou has
[1:44:15] been ordained before the foundation of
[1:44:17] the world to believe this." I say
[1:44:20] tonight that we've been ordained to be
[1:44:22] believers. I didn't just become a
[1:44:24] believer. I've always been a believer.
[1:44:26] And that part of you that was always a
[1:44:28] believer of the word of God, it's been
[1:44:31] buried up in this robe of flesh. But
[1:44:33] that real believer, that part of you
[1:44:35] that truly believes the word, it's
[1:44:37] always been there.
[1:44:40] But see, not all of you is a soul.
[1:44:42] There's another part of us that is a
[1:44:44] spirit man. Brother B would teach on on
[1:44:46] the on on healing. You notice what he
[1:44:48] would say? Healing takes place in where?
[1:44:51] In the spiritual realm. Remember when he
[1:44:53] would show through these healing
[1:44:54] campaigns, there would be a person come
[1:44:56] up with blinded eyes. It never was a
[1:44:58] flesh problem. Brother B said it was a
[1:45:00] blind what? Spirit. It was a blind
[1:45:03] spirit. It's a spirit that would wrap
[1:45:05] around some nerve. It was it when the
[1:45:07] deaf and dumb, it was a deaf and dumb
[1:45:09] spirit. Cancer, it was a demonic spirit.
[1:45:12] And he would show us how that these
[1:45:13] diseases, the demonic spirits had came
[1:45:16] into the world after the fall in the
[1:45:17] garden. So you realize it's a flesh
[1:45:19] problem. So So it can't be healed by the
[1:45:22] flesh, but it takes a spiritual healing.
[1:45:24] He said, see, that's why he would say,
[1:45:26] who wants to come and be healed by the
[1:45:28] spirit of God? So that's why he said
[1:45:31] even when Jesus would heal, it wasn't
[1:45:33] the flesh of Jesus that was healing
[1:45:35] anybody, but it was the spirit. It was
[1:45:37] the life that was on the inside of him.
[1:45:39] It was the spirit upon him. Matter of
[1:45:40] fact, the person actually asked this
[1:45:42] question to am I okay? He asked this
[1:45:45] question in 1964. He said, "Can every
[1:45:47] son of God be anointed to do miracles
[1:45:49] and signs and wonders or is it at the
[1:45:51] direction of the Holy Ghost?" Listen how
[1:45:53] brother Ben answers this. He said,
[1:45:54] "Yeah, it's at the direction of the Holy
[1:45:56] Ghost." He said, "But if you are a son
[1:45:58] of God or a daughter of God, whatever
[1:46:01] you are, when you have received the Holy
[1:46:03] Spirit, then the Holy Spirit directs you
[1:46:05] to do things." And then he starts
[1:46:07] telling a testimony about a little lady
[1:46:09] over in Meridian, Mississippi. When
[1:46:11] brother Bigby put on his campaign
[1:46:12] meeting, he said that lady was sitting
[1:46:14] there in that great auditorium. And here
[1:46:16] comes a little mama holding a baby, a
[1:46:18] blue baby. Remember? She said when she
[1:46:20] passed by me, you know, something on her
[1:46:22] heart. So told her, "You go pray for
[1:46:24] that baby." She said, "Well, I can't go
[1:46:26] pray for that baby." You know, after
[1:46:27] all, we're at Brother Ma's meetings. And
[1:46:29] you know, she come here to get to get
[1:46:30] healing. And and so she just kind of
[1:46:32] waited a little bit later hear that mama
[1:46:34] come back by again. And she noticed in
[1:46:36] her hand she had a prayer card. And she
[1:46:38] said, you know, that the spirit kept
[1:46:39] telling her, "Go pray for that baby. Go
[1:46:41] pray for that baby. Go lay your hands on
[1:46:44] that baby." She said, "But but but but
[1:46:45] she had a prayer card." She said, "Now I
[1:46:47] know that that'd be silly for me to go
[1:46:49] pray for my well that mama wouldn't want
[1:46:50] me praying for a child. After all, she's
[1:46:52] here to see Brother Brown. She's got a
[1:46:54] prayer card in her hand. But but
[1:46:55] something just kept pressing on her. She
[1:46:57] finally she said, "Well, I'll tell you
[1:46:58] what I'll do. I'll just get it out of my
[1:47:00] system and and I'll just let her have my
[1:47:01] seat." So here she was right there near
[1:47:03] the front. And when the lady came back
[1:47:05] by, she said, you know, ma'am, she said,
[1:47:06] would you like to sit down? She gave her
[1:47:08] she gave her her seat. And you know, she
[1:47:10] kind of I can just see this little lady
[1:47:11] sitting there. She kind of sit there a
[1:47:13] minute and nervous as she was. She said,
[1:47:14] you know, sis, you know, I noticed she
[1:47:16] had a prayer card. She said, "Yeah, I
[1:47:18] yeah, I have one." She said, "Boy, I
[1:47:20] sure hope your number gets called." She
[1:47:21] goes, "Yeah, I do too. I I hope it does.
[1:47:24] We're we're hoping and praying." She
[1:47:25] said, "Well, you know, I this may sound
[1:47:26] a little bit odd, but you know, the
[1:47:28] whole time you've been walking in here,
[1:47:30] there's something been pressing on me to
[1:47:31] pray for your baby. would you allow me
[1:47:33] to lay my hands on your baby now? I
[1:47:35] don't want to offend you in any way. And
[1:47:36] the lady said, "Well, sure. I I wouldn't
[1:47:38] mind that. You go ahead and pray for
[1:47:40] her." So that little lady, she she laid
[1:47:42] her hands on the child and she prayed a
[1:47:43] prayer of faith. Well, then after she
[1:47:45] after she got done praying, she got up
[1:47:47] and she went way up up up in about three
[1:47:49] levels of balconies away and a gentleman
[1:47:51] gave his seat up to her and and so after
[1:47:53] a little a few minutes, Brother Bam
[1:47:54] comes in the meeting and and they they
[1:47:56] start he gives a little word and then he
[1:47:58] starts calling people forth and calling
[1:48:00] the prayer cards and that lady got so
[1:48:02] excited up there in the top rows when
[1:48:04] she looked down and saw that the prayer
[1:48:06] card that that little lady with a baby
[1:48:08] that she was third or fourth in line.
[1:48:10] She said, "Oh, she was up at the front
[1:48:11] of Elijah." She got so excited cuz now
[1:48:13] brother Benham's going to be able to
[1:48:14] pray for her baby. And so and so she
[1:48:17] finally she walks up there and she and
[1:48:19] brother Ma'am goes and he he takes the
[1:48:20] child. He goes to pray for it. He said,
[1:48:22] "Ma'am," he said, "you come here." He
[1:48:24] told her her name, where she was from.
[1:48:25] He said, "You come here to receive
[1:48:27] healing for your baby. You got a a
[1:48:29] little blue baby." He said, "But there's
[1:48:30] only one problem. Your baby's already
[1:48:32] been healed." He said, "There's a lady
[1:48:34] sitting up in the balcony about the
[1:48:36] third level up. over the fourth row down
[1:48:38] and this is her name and this is where
[1:48:40] she come from and the spirit of the Lord
[1:48:42] ministered to her and told her to pray
[1:48:44] for your baby and God has already healed
[1:48:46] her. He said if that woman wouldn't have
[1:48:48] obeyed the Lord he said then the then it
[1:48:50] would have caused a rebuke in the
[1:48:52] meeting. He said so yes we can all do
[1:48:55] miracles when you're directed by the
[1:48:57] Holy Ghost to do miracles. You go do it
[1:49:00] because it's Holy Spirit directed. He
[1:49:03] said if she wouldn't have carried out
[1:49:04] what God told her to do, he said it
[1:49:06] might have been a rebuke in the spirit.
[1:49:08] If she'd have disobeyed the Lord, he
[1:49:09] said, "But that's always if you're a
[1:49:11] Christian and something is persuading
[1:49:13] you to do something, then you go do it.
[1:49:15] Don't doubt it. Just go do it." Oh, I
[1:49:18] know what the devil says. Brother Sean
[1:49:20] said, "I can have my liberty." I know
[1:49:21] what the devil said. Brother Maggie, you
[1:49:22] better be careful. What's going to
[1:49:24] happen? You're going to have people
[1:49:25] walking around praying for one another.
[1:49:27] God forbid. Oh, I know what's going to
[1:49:29] happen. that people are are going to
[1:49:30] start believing in the power of prayer
[1:49:32] and people are laying hands on one
[1:49:34] another and they'll be calling sisters
[1:49:36] to their house in the middle of the
[1:49:38] night to lay their hands on their
[1:49:39] children having having people expecting
[1:49:42] miracles again. Oh friends, I got news
[1:49:44] for you tonight. I think we need to take
[1:49:46] the limits off of God anyway. I think we
[1:49:48] put too many limits that God ain't big
[1:49:50] enough cuz he can't work through little
[1:49:52] people. Ain't that the word of a
[1:49:54] Pharisee? God can't work through a
[1:49:55] little person. God can't work through a
[1:49:57] little dishwoman. God can't work for a
[1:49:59] young man or a young boy. But I got news
[1:50:01] for you. Our God is big enough to work
[1:50:04] through the little. Oh, hallelujah. If
[1:50:06] he can work through me, he can work
[1:50:08] through
[1:50:09] anybody. That was the problem with the
[1:50:11] Pharisee to begin with, that God was too
[1:50:14] big to use a man in that way. That's why
[1:50:17] people still live with problems because
[1:50:19] God's too big to to use in that way.
[1:50:21] That they stop praying. They stop asking
[1:50:23] God for things. In the minds of people,
[1:50:26] God has become too small to do anything.
[1:50:32] Hallelujah.
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:35] My goodness. Can I have some liberty?
[1:50:37] You know what? You know what that
[1:50:38] reminds me
[1:50:39] of? I I don't want to put this out
[1:50:41] there, but any of y'all ever been to
[1:50:42] Disney World? Don't raise your hand, but
[1:50:43] there's a ride at Disney World. It's
[1:50:45] called It's a Small World After All. You
[1:50:48] get on there on this little got this
[1:50:49] little boat and you get in there. It's
[1:50:51] the worst thing you ever done. If you
[1:50:52] hadn't done it, don't don't experience
[1:50:53] it. I had a little girl. She insisted.
[1:50:55] But when you get on there, they take a
[1:50:57] little boat and it goes through and it's
[1:50:58] got all these little wooden scary dolls
[1:51:00] that jump around. It's a small world
[1:51:02] after all. It's a and they go to singing
[1:51:04] and then they go to the next country and
[1:51:06] it sings in another language. Goes to
[1:51:07] the next country, sings in another
[1:51:09] language. Worst nightmare. I didn't know
[1:51:10] you could have a nightmare in 20
[1:51:11] languages, but you can. It's a
[1:51:14] nightmare. They thought the Haunted
[1:51:15] Mansion was scary. It ain't got nothing
[1:51:16] on. It's a small world. I'd rather be
[1:51:18] drugged behind that boat with my head
[1:51:20] banging on the rail that's driving it
[1:51:21] than sitting in it looking at them
[1:51:22] wooden dolls singing it's a small world
[1:51:25] after
[1:51:26] all. But you see what they done is they
[1:51:28] actually designed it to where they could
[1:51:31] build it in a way that the world would
[1:51:34] seem small to you. They designed it in
[1:51:36] such a way that you could go through it
[1:51:37] all and you could see it all and that's
[1:51:39] all there is to offer. So the world
[1:51:41] could look small and so it show you how
[1:51:43] much we're connected. I thought my it
[1:51:45] may be that way with the world, but it
[1:51:47] ain't that way with God. I think too
[1:51:50] many people have made God too small
[1:51:52] anyway. They may supposed to get up and
[1:51:53] sing the song special in church. He's a
[1:51:55] small God after all. But I got news for
[1:51:58] you. My God ain't a small God. He's a
[1:52:01] great big God. He's He's omniresent.
[1:52:04] He's omnipotent. He's unlimited in power
[1:52:07] and has the ability to do all things.
[1:52:09] And brother Bam said, "It ain't only God
[1:52:11] that's omnipotent, but any man that's
[1:52:14] fully surrendered to God is an
[1:52:16] omnipotent man." And what happens when
[1:52:18] two omnipotent meet? He said, "When God
[1:52:20] and man comes together," he said, "wo
[1:52:22] omnipotence be that something's got to
[1:52:24] shake." And whatever you say with that
[1:52:26] creative power of the omnipotence of
[1:52:28] God, knowing that he promised it, he
[1:52:30] said it in his word, he creates a power
[1:52:33] and goes out yonder and bring things to
[1:52:35] pass. Things that and it makes them as
[1:52:37] though they are because two omnipotents
[1:52:40] have met.
[1:52:42] He's an omnipotent God. You say,
[1:52:43] "Brother Matt, I don't feel omnipotent."
[1:52:45] That's the way we feel. I I don't feel
[1:52:47] very big. I don't feel that kind of
[1:52:49] power in my life. Maybe reminds me of
[1:52:50] that little boy that was sitting by the
[1:52:52] side of the road that day. remember when
[1:52:53] he was sitting there and he had his head
[1:52:55] bowed. He was saying A B C D E F G H I J
[1:52:59] K L M M N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N N
[1:53:00] N N N N O P. Pastor walked by where he
[1:53:03] was. He said, 'Young man, he said, "What
[1:53:04] in the world are you doing?" He said,
[1:53:07] "Well, I wanted to give my heart to the
[1:53:09] Lord." He said, "You're sitting there
[1:53:11] saying your ABCs." He said, "Well, sir,
[1:53:15] it's because I don't know how to pray
[1:53:17] and I don't know what words to say. So,
[1:53:19] I thought I'd just give God all the
[1:53:21] letters and let him make out the words.
[1:53:24] I'm not very big. I don't I may not know
[1:53:26] a whole lot of things, but but I'm just
[1:53:28] going to give the letters to God and let
[1:53:30] God work. I thought, my it don't take
[1:53:32] big words to get God moving in your
[1:53:34] life. All it takes is a surrendered
[1:53:36] heart to allow God to move on the scene
[1:53:39] and be able to minister and change
[1:53:40] things in your life. Friends, I've got
[1:53:42] news for you tonight. There ain't enough
[1:53:44] words to describe him. There ain't
[1:53:46] enough letters to define him. I can tell
[1:53:48] you right now, if you took your ABCs,
[1:53:50] you could find every letter in our
[1:53:52] alphabet and you could preach a message
[1:53:54] on it of the greatness of our God. A,
[1:53:57] he's almighty. B, he's a boundless God.
[1:54:01] That means he's not confined by the
[1:54:03] world or the limits that man would put
[1:54:04] on him. Solomon said, "Heaven and the
[1:54:07] heavens cannot contain thee. How much
[1:54:09] less than this house that I have built?"
[1:54:10] Our God is a boundless God. His mercy is
[1:54:13] boundless. His love is boundless. His
[1:54:15] grace is boundless. He's a boundless
[1:54:17] God. See, he's a God of compassion. Oh,
[1:54:21] that's what Jesus said to the multitude
[1:54:23] when they were hungry. He said, "I have
[1:54:25] compassion on the multitude." The Bible
[1:54:27] said he's compassionate and gracious and
[1:54:29] he's slow to anger. D, he's a deliverer
[1:54:32] and he's a dependable God. That means
[1:54:35] you can rely on him to do what he says
[1:54:37] he's going to do. E, he's an eternal
[1:54:39] God. He never had a beginning and he
[1:54:41] never how I may as well preacher. He
[1:54:43] never had a beginning and he never had
[1:54:44] an end. F. He's a faithful God. David
[1:54:47] said, "Thy faithfulness shall be
[1:54:48] established in the heavens." And I I got
[1:54:51] news for you tonight. Not only was it
[1:54:52] established in the heavens, but it's
[1:54:54] been established on the earth. It's been
[1:54:56] established in the heart of every
[1:54:58] believer. Our God is a faithful
[1:55:01] God. Gee, he's gracious. He's glorious.
[1:55:04] He's generous. He's a great God. H, he's
[1:55:07] a holy God. He set apart one. He's
[1:55:10] always right. He's blameless and pure.
[1:55:12] Isaiah said, "I saw them sitting upon
[1:55:15] the throne, and the angels were crying,
[1:55:17] holy, holy, holy to the Lord of hosts. I
[1:55:20] He's our mall. He's He's immortal. He'll
[1:55:23] never decay. He'll never cease to
[1:55:25] exist." Jesus said, "You can destroy
[1:55:27] this temple in three days. I'll build it
[1:55:29] back up again." But I got news for you.
[1:55:31] He ain't the only immortal one. He said,
[1:55:33] "But one day, this mortality will put on
[1:55:35] immortality, and you'll be just like God
[1:55:38] is." No wonder Paul said, "Thou unto the
[1:55:41] King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the
[1:55:45] only wise God be honor and glory forever
[1:55:48] and ever. Amen."
[1:55:51] J, he's a just God. K, he's kindness. L,
[1:55:55] he's a God of love. M, he's merciful. N,
[1:55:58] he's never failing. I ain't got time to
[1:56:00] preach him. O, he's a one God. And let
[1:56:02] me tell you something else about it.
[1:56:03] He's on time. He ain't never whenever
[1:56:05] you need him, he's always on time. He's
[1:56:08] our God. P, he's perfect. That means he
[1:56:10] can never do wrong. Q, he has quickening
[1:56:13] power. He can take the dead and bring it
[1:56:15] back to life. He has the power to bring
[1:56:17] forth. R, he's righteous. S, he's
[1:56:20] sovereign. T, he's a true God. He'll
[1:56:23] never tell you a lie. You, he's
[1:56:25] unchanging. He's unwavering. He's
[1:56:28] unconquerable. He's our God. He's
[1:56:30] victorious. For the letter V W, he's a
[1:56:33] God of wisdom. That's what Paul said. He
[1:56:36] said, "The depths of the riches, both
[1:56:37] the wisdom and the knowledge of God."
[1:56:39] Hallelujah. He's a God of wisdom. But
[1:56:41] let me tell you what else. He's a God
[1:56:44] that that that John when he would see,
[1:56:46] he would we be weeping. He said, "I
[1:56:48] found no man worthy to open the book and
[1:56:51] loose the seals thereof." But then all
[1:56:54] of a sudden, the the elders called to
[1:56:55] him and said, "Oh, John, behold, don't
[1:56:58] we, but the line of the tribe of Judah,
[1:57:00] the root of David, hath prevailed to
[1:57:02] open the book and to loose the seals
[1:57:04] thereof." And the Bible said when he
[1:57:05] turned around, he said, "I saw a bloody
[1:57:07] lamb standing there." And you know what
[1:57:09] those elders done? They fell down before
[1:57:11] him. They and they begin to cry out,
[1:57:14] "Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[1:57:17] Worthy is the one that was able to take
[1:57:20] the book and open the seals thereof and
[1:57:22] redeem us to God by his blood."
[1:57:26] X, he's extraordinary.
[1:57:28] That's free right there. He's an
[1:57:30] extraordinary God. Why? He's Yahweh. The
[1:57:34] Bible would say the self-existing Lord.
[1:57:36] But let me tell you the best part about
[1:57:37] why he's your God.
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:41] He's your God. He's your God. He's your
[1:57:45] God. He's your God. He He He said, "I
[1:57:48] they will be my people and I will be
[1:57:50] their God." He's not just a God, but
[1:57:52] he's your God. But Ram said, "We have a
[1:57:55] personal relationship with him." You
[1:57:58] see, he's a zealous God.
[1:58:01] You know what it means? It means he
[1:58:02] displays a great energy or purpose in
[1:58:04] his pursuit. He's God. He's a zealous
[1:58:07] God. That means when God comes after
[1:58:08] you, he won't ever quit. He don't give
[1:58:10] up. He's got the energy to follow you to
[1:58:12] the ends of the earth. He's got the
[1:58:14] energy to follow you into the depths and
[1:58:16] the lowest parts of your life and be
[1:58:18] able to bring you out. He's a zealous
[1:58:19] God and he hasn't ever lost a one. I say
[1:58:22] he's God. He's the King of Kings. He's
[1:58:24] the Lord of Lords. He's the Alpha. He's
[1:58:27] the Omega. He's the beginning and the
[1:58:29] end. There ain't enough letters to
[1:58:31] define him. There ain't enough words to
[1:58:32] describe him. He's my God. He's God in
[1:58:35] the Father. He's God and the Son. He's
[1:58:38] God in the Holy Ghost. He's Elohim, the
[1:58:41] self-existing one. He's God that's
[1:58:43] present among us this evening. He's our
[1:58:46] God.
[1:58:47] He's our God.
[1:58:51] Let me tell you where the struggle is.
[1:58:53] The struggle is not with the healer.
[1:58:56] It's not with the believer. But the
[1:58:58] struggle is with the Pharisee.
[1:59:02] It's the Pharisee. Said, "Here we are
[1:59:05] talking about this flesh of ours." He
[1:59:07] said, "It's a old cockabar nature. The
[1:59:09] life of a believer, it's like a cockabar
[1:59:11] out in the field. The shell is a
[1:59:12] cockaur, but inside is a wheat life." He
[1:59:16] said, "The life of that cockar, it's
[1:59:17] been taken out. But the nature of it
[1:59:19] still sticky. And until this life has
[1:59:21] been fully developed out of the ground
[1:59:23] and raised up again, when it comes
[1:59:25] forth, then it'll no longer be a cocoa
[1:59:26] bar, but it'll be wheat. But while it's
[1:59:29] here on the earth,
[1:59:31] that cockaur, it's still sticky. It's
[1:59:34] but it's got the nature of wheat on the
[1:59:36] inside of it. He said, "And as long as
[1:59:38] you're in this life, you're going to be
[1:59:39] sticky and have a carnal nature that's
[1:59:42] going to bother you as long as you live.
[1:59:44] But the inside of you, you're born
[1:59:45] again. And when you're raised up, you're
[1:59:47] in the likeness of Christ and all that
[1:59:48] sin is gone from you. You know what that
[1:59:50] tells me? That every true Christian,
[1:59:53] every man or woman, you can find all
[1:59:55] three of those characters. You can find
[1:59:57] the healer, you can find the believer,
[2:00:00] and you can find the Pharisee. I can
[2:00:02] prove this to you cuz every time God
[2:00:04] does something supernatural, there's a
[2:00:05] part of you that always wants to believe
[2:00:07] it. But then notice what happens
[2:00:09] sometimes whenever you hear a testimony,
[2:00:11] sometimes instead of the believer
[2:00:12] showing up, the Pharisee shows up first.
[2:00:14] He says, "You know what? I I just find
[2:00:16] that hard to believe." And you hear a
[2:00:18] testimony of the blinded eyes that was
[2:00:20] open in a meeting. Well, you know what?
[2:00:21] I I don't know about that. You know, I
[2:00:23] could see it maybe back when Jesus was
[2:00:25] here. Maybe when Brother Man was here,
[2:00:26] maybe when one of these great meetings,
[2:00:28] but but but I don't know about that.
[2:00:30] What? It's the Pharisee that's showing
[2:00:31] up. He said, "I don't see if it's true
[2:00:33] or not." You look what he does whenever
[2:00:35] God starts working in a church and and
[2:00:37] all of a sudden the Pharisee would rise
[2:00:39] up. Well, I don't know if that's God or
[2:00:40] not. If God was going to move, then God
[2:00:42] would probably use me. Or if God was
[2:00:44] going to do a great work, wouldn't God
[2:00:45] do that great work through us? You see,
[2:00:47] because it's always a Pharisee. I watch
[2:00:49] that spirit. I I don't know why they let
[2:00:51] them sing. I I don't know why they let
[2:00:52] that brother preach. I don't know why
[2:00:54] they do this that way. I don't know why
[2:00:56] they have meetings in Virginia. And I I
[2:00:57] don't know why they put the tent down in
[2:00:59] the hole where the water could get in. I
[2:01:00] I don't know why this. There's a
[2:01:02] Pharisee that's always trying to combat
[2:01:04] the things of God. It will turn them.
[2:01:07] Let me tell you what'll happen, friends.
[2:01:09] That Pharisee will rob you of every
[2:01:11] spiritual blessing that God has ever had
[2:01:13] for you. He'll cause you to turn down
[2:01:16] every move of God. It'll cause you to
[2:01:18] resist God. And when God moves, it'll
[2:01:20] cause you to sit back and be criticized
[2:01:22] the very thing that the Holy Ghost is
[2:01:24] doing. But let me tell you what we ought
[2:01:25] to do tonight. I think it's about time
[2:01:27] that we just rebuke the Pharisee and let
[2:01:30] the believer in us rise up and declare
[2:01:33] the works of a living God. I wonder how
[2:01:35] many tonight can say I come to declare
[2:01:37] him for I am a believer. A believer it's
[2:01:40] a person who believes that a specified
[2:01:43] thing is effective and proper and
[2:01:47] desirable. That's what a believer is.
[2:01:49] They believe a certain thing is
[2:01:51] effective and proper and desirable. So
[2:01:53] that means a believer of the word, it
[2:01:56] means that that person believes that the
[2:01:58] word is effective, it's proper and it's
[2:02:01] desirable. I thank God that I that here
[2:02:04] in the midst of Leosa that there's still
[2:02:07] a people that desire the word of God.
[2:02:10] That's what a believer is. It finds the
[2:02:12] thing they believe in is desirable. See,
[2:02:14] so when you say, "Brother man, I'm a
[2:02:16] believer." That means there's a desire
[2:02:18] in your heart for the word of God. It's
[2:02:20] the believer. Don't you realize the age
[2:02:22] that we're living in here is so
[2:02:24] prevalent? In the Leoa, the Bible said
[2:02:26] they were blind or they were they would
[2:02:28] say, "I am rich and increase with goods
[2:02:29] and have need of nothing." He said, "But
[2:02:31] they don't know that they're wretched
[2:02:32] and miserable and poor and blind and
[2:02:34] naked." He said, "But what?" He said,
[2:02:36] "But but but I'm going to anoint thine
[2:02:38] eyes with eyes that thou mayest see."
[2:02:41] Isn't that something? That's what the
[2:02:42] old hunters used to do. Remember
[2:02:44] when somebody's eyes got matted over and
[2:02:45] it got cold and and that they would take
[2:02:47] the grease from the Brother
[2:02:49] Wayne's mom, she used to And if you
[2:02:50] ain't ever ate old the best
[2:02:52] you ever ate, she cooked it. My make it
[2:02:54] with some sweet potatoes and buddy, it
[2:02:56] was terrible. But it was the best
[2:02:57] you ever ate. But but uh not not a knock
[2:03:00] on our cooking. It's just the co but
[2:03:02] they're real greasy. Amen. So I know
[2:03:04] about that. Y'all do too. I looked up
[2:03:05] coons in hunting in Virginia. It's a
[2:03:07] real thing here too. Don't look at me
[2:03:08] like I'm from
[2:03:09] Arkansas. But but but but they would
[2:03:12] take this grease and they would
[2:03:13] save it up and they get them eyes all
[2:03:15] matted over, put the grease on and
[2:03:17] it would it would it would cause all
[2:03:18] that to clear up and then they could see
[2:03:20] again. But Ram said, "But here when you
[2:03:22] see the condition of the church," he
[2:03:23] said, "The church has found itself in a
[2:03:25] spiritual drought. It's a freezing
[2:03:26] spell." He said, "But it'll take more
[2:03:28] than congre to open the eyes of the
[2:03:30] church." See, it'll take the Isa of the
[2:03:32] Holy Ghost, the true revelation of the
[2:03:35] word of God. That's what was going on in
[2:03:37] in Leosia here, the move of Pentecost.
[2:03:39] He said they they got where they were
[2:03:41] more concerned about how big their
[2:03:42] church was. He said until they left God
[2:03:44] out of it. Or how smart their pastor was
[2:03:47] and they left God out of it. Or how much
[2:03:48] money they had and they left God out of
[2:03:50] it. He said, "But you'd be better off
[2:03:52] instead of having so many big churches
[2:03:54] if you just went back down on the street
[2:03:56] corner to a store mission and have God
[2:03:58] with us. Don't you think so?" I think
[2:04:00] that's the way it ought to be. I'd
[2:04:02] rather have a little church with God in
[2:04:03] it than a great big church without him.
[2:04:05] I'd rather have I'd rather be poor with
[2:04:07] God than to be rich without him. I'd
[2:04:09] rather die sick with God than to live
[2:04:12] well without him. Cuz if I died sick, at
[2:04:14] least I'd have a hope for a
[2:04:16] resurrection.
[2:04:18] I think it's time. He said, when the
[2:04:19] church gets organized and set down home
[2:04:22] and just a big bunch of cold statues, he
[2:04:24] said that's when the Holy Ghost moves
[2:04:26] out and starts a little latter rain.
[2:04:28] Glory to God. When they turn into a
[2:04:31] bunch of cold statues, then the Holy
[2:04:33] Ghost moves out and he starts some
[2:04:34] latter rain. He said, "That's what we
[2:04:36] need today. We need some old-fashioned
[2:04:39] God sent Holy Ghost preaching from the
[2:04:41] pull pit to straighten the church back
[2:04:43] out to let loose the grace of God and
[2:04:45] bring a people to repentance because
[2:04:47] we've got too formal and set down. Oh,
[2:04:50] hell. Hallelujah. You know what we need?
[2:04:52] I think that's what we need tonight is
[2:04:53] we need a little Holy Ghost rain in the
[2:04:56] church of the living God. You know what
[2:04:58] rain represents? Rain represents the
[2:05:01] spirit of God falling upon the earth.
[2:05:03] That's what Joel prophesied. He said in
[2:05:06] in the last days and when he talked
[2:05:07] about the restoration of the church, he
[2:05:09] said, "I have given you the former rain
[2:05:11] moderately, but God will cause to come
[2:05:13] down you the former rain and the latter
[2:05:16] rain in the first month and the floor
[2:05:18] shall be pul full of wheat and the vat
[2:05:20] shall overflow with wine and oil." How
[2:05:22] many knows what them rains were? The
[2:05:23] former rain which was a teaching rain
[2:05:25] and the in the in the in the in other
[2:05:27] words it was a planting rain and the
[2:05:29] latter rain was a harvest rain. So you
[2:05:31] know if you went ask an old farmer the
[2:05:33] farmer tell you what that meant. In
[2:05:34] other words, that when you're going to
[2:05:36] go plant a seed, you had to have a had
[2:05:38] to have a good rain to plant the seed
[2:05:40] in. That way, the seed could take and
[2:05:42] the the ground was prepared, had a good
[2:05:44] rain. That's a planting rain. In other
[2:05:46] words, that that's what he would call
[2:05:47] this teaching rain. But then when it
[2:05:49] came time for harvest, any good farmer
[2:05:51] would tell you that they need that last
[2:05:53] rain just before a harvest in order to
[2:05:56] cause the ears or the or the ears of the
[2:05:59] corn to fill up to their full potential.
[2:06:01] I thought, my isn't that good. here.
[2:06:03] They might be full and they might look
[2:06:05] good and they they might look good on
[2:06:06] the surface, but a good farmer says,
[2:06:08] "But what we need is a harvest rain."
[2:06:10] Cuz that harvest rain, it'll cause it to
[2:06:12] come. It'll fill the husk all the way to
[2:06:14] the top. It'll be able to man manifest
[2:06:17] all that it can be if we can get that
[2:06:19] harvest rain upon it. I I know what the
[2:06:21] devil said. We We don't We don't need
[2:06:23] We've already got the message. We don't
[2:06:24] need that no more. We don't need no that
[2:06:26] latter rain stuff. After all, we're not
[2:06:28] a bunch of Pentecostal babies and and
[2:06:30] we're under the headship of the word
[2:06:32] after all. Let me tell you what a
[2:06:33] prophet of God said. He shows what would
[2:06:35] happen in Leosa. He said this age
[2:06:37] started after the turn of the century.
[2:06:39] He said, "But it was to be the age in
[2:06:42] which the true church would return to
[2:06:44] being the bride that she was at
[2:06:45] Pentecost." He said, "And we know that
[2:06:47] there must of by necessity be a return
[2:06:51] of dynamic power." Y'all catch that
[2:06:52] word? He said, "It must by necessity be
[2:06:55] a return." You know why? There was a
[2:06:57] necessity means there was a need for the
[2:06:59] church to return to a dynamic power. You
[2:07:01] said, "Well, brother Matt, what's the
[2:07:02] need of it?" The need is the church has
[2:07:04] to go into a rapture. The need is it's a
[2:07:07] time for harvest. He says, "So here, the
[2:07:09] people were waiting on this. The
[2:07:10] believers, they sensed it in their
[2:07:12] spirits. They got the calling out for
[2:07:13] God for an outpouring." He said, "And
[2:07:15] all of the sudden it seemed like the
[2:07:17] answer came when the in Isuza Street in
[2:07:20] that Pentecost." He said, "It looked
[2:07:22] like the answer came." He said as many
[2:07:24] be to speak in tongues they manifested
[2:07:26] the gifts of the spirit. It was believed
[2:07:28] that it was the very long awaited
[2:07:30] restoration of the church. They actually
[2:07:32] believed that that was the latter rain
[2:07:34] that fulfilled Jo the second chapter.
[2:07:36] But brother said but it couldn't been
[2:07:38] that. He said it wasn't that for the
[2:07:41] latter rain could not come until the
[2:07:43] former rain had came. See because the
[2:07:45] spring rain or the teaching rain had to
[2:07:47] come first and then the latter rain
[2:07:49] which is a harvest rain. He says, "So it
[2:07:52] could be the real thing. How could it be
[2:07:54] the real thing when the teaching reign
[2:07:55] had not yet come?" He said, "But then
[2:07:58] when the prophet messenger would come
[2:07:59] that was sent to teach the people and
[2:08:02] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:08:04] their Pentecostal fathers, when he would
[2:08:06] come," he said, then then then the
[2:08:08] latter reign would have the ability to
[2:08:10] come. He said that's what they thought.
[2:08:11] They thought it to be the restoration.
[2:08:13] They thought it was the final quickening
[2:08:14] under the rapture. But but but it wasn't
[2:08:17] that. It had not come yet because it was
[2:08:20] a mixture of unrighteous partaking of
[2:08:23] the spiritual blessings and the
[2:08:25] manifesting of the Holy Ghost. I
[2:08:27] thought, my if there's an unrighteous
[2:08:29] partaking of of the of the of the of the
[2:08:32] spiritual blessing and manifesting the
[2:08:34] Holy Ghost, then what about a righteous
[2:08:36] partaking? What about those that are
[2:08:38] called to that are righteous by the word
[2:08:40] of God to be able to to manifest the
[2:08:43] very spirit of God? He said, "We knew it
[2:08:45] was the devil because it was a devil
[2:08:46] power. They were controlled by devils."
[2:08:48] He said, "They didn't seem to realize
[2:08:50] it, but I can prove that it wasn't real
[2:08:52] because in before the second generation
[2:08:54] appeared, they organized. They wrote
[2:08:56] unscriptural doctrines and they built
[2:08:58] their own fences around just like every
[2:09:00] other group around them did." He says,
[2:09:03] "See, so see where we are. Think about
[2:09:05] it where we are. Pentecost, it couldn't
[2:09:07] have been the latter rain. That's what
[2:09:08] people put it on. Well, that was that
[2:09:10] was something that happened in
[2:09:11] Pentecost. That's just a that's just a
[2:09:13] little revival. or something like that.
[2:09:14] Said, "But it couldn't have been that
[2:09:15] because the latter rain was a harvest
[2:09:17] rain. And you can't have a harvest if
[2:09:20] there never was a crop that was put in
[2:09:22] the ground." Are you hearing me? There
[2:09:23] can't be a harvest if there's no seed
[2:09:25] planted. He said, "So, see, the seed had
[2:09:28] to come first." That was the very
[2:09:29] purpose of Malachi 4. It was to plant
[2:09:32] the seed of the word. You said, "Well,
[2:09:33] brother M, what's he going to plant?"
[2:09:34] Let me tell you what a prophet said. He
[2:09:36] said, "He will plant the seed of the
[2:09:38] entire Bible from the serpent to the
[2:09:41] messenger in the formal reign." Friends,
[2:09:43] let me tell you tonight, rain is rain.
[2:09:45] Let me tell you the only difference
[2:09:46] between the former rain and the latter
[2:09:48] rain. It was the season that it came.
[2:09:50] Rain is the moving of the spirit of God
[2:09:53] upon the earth. It's the move of the
[2:09:55] spirit. That's what the Bible would tell
[2:09:57] us. It's the It's the spirit of God
[2:09:59] coming down on the earth. It was a
[2:10:00] different season, but it's the same
[2:10:02] rain. It's the move of the spirit that
[2:10:05] would bring things to pass. You think
[2:10:06] about it. In other words, that same Holy
[2:10:08] Ghost that done the teaching is the same
[2:10:11] Holy Ghost that does the harvesting. And
[2:10:14] brother Bam said, "And now we've had a a
[2:10:17] teaching rain, but we're now ready for
[2:10:20] the harvest rain." Oh, don't you see
[2:10:22] where we are? We're in harvest time. How
[2:10:24] many believes that tonight? This is
[2:10:25] harvest time. We ain't waiting on
[2:10:27] another age. He said it's harvest time.
[2:10:30] This is a season of the rapture. And let
[2:10:31] me tell you something tonight. I'm not
[2:10:33] afraid of a little bit of rain. I'm not
[2:10:35] afraid of the moving of the spirit. I'm
[2:10:38] not afraid of a revival. It takes the
[2:10:40] move of the spirit of God to bring the
[2:10:42] seed to life. That's what happened in
[2:10:44] the book of Genesis. The Bible says that
[2:10:46] God laid the seed beneath the waters. It
[2:10:48] was buried up in the earth. It was
[2:10:50] black. It was unformed. But then the
[2:10:52] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[2:10:54] waters and the seed brought forth
[2:10:57] life. So the moving of the spirit is
[2:10:59] what makes the sea grow. Friends, let me
[2:11:01] tell you, that's what we need today. We
[2:11:03] don't need a church movement. We need
[2:11:05] the moving of the spirit of God. So, let
[2:11:07] me tell you what I'm going to do. I'm
[2:11:09] going to forget all my thoughts. I'm
[2:11:11] going to forget my feelings. I'm going
[2:11:12] to forget my problems. And I'm going to
[2:11:14] let the spirit of God move upon the face
[2:11:17] of the waters.
[2:11:20] I wonder how many can say, "Lord, that's
[2:11:22] what we need is a little bit of rain. It
[2:11:24] don't hurt to have a little rain upon
[2:11:26] our life. Let the revival of God pour
[2:11:28] out upon our life." Let me tell you
[2:11:30] friends, the problem is too many people
[2:11:31] come to church with an umbrella when the
[2:11:33] rain begins to fall. I don't want none
[2:11:35] of that getting on me. After all, I just
[2:11:37] bought this dress and you know, I sure
[2:11:38] hate to mess it up and my I don't want
[2:11:40] that. You know, it's too loud. I don't
[2:11:42] want none of that kind of rain. That's
[2:11:43] too much emotion in it. I don't want
[2:11:45] that kind of rain. That's too much
[2:11:47] liberty in it. I don't want that kind of
[2:11:48] rain. It's too loud. I'd hate to mess up
[2:11:51] my hair. They got the umbrella to keep
[2:11:53] the rain of God off of them. But I think
[2:11:55] what we ought to do this night is to
[2:11:57] take the umbrella and shuck it and let
[2:11:59] the rain of God fall up in the house of
[2:12:02] God. Hallelujah. I think we ought to
[2:12:05] shuck it. Oh, I think the I think we
[2:12:06] ought to just let the wind of wind of
[2:12:08] God blow through this building and break
[2:12:10] every umbrella that you're holding till
[2:12:12] it don't work no longer that the power
[2:12:14] of God could fall and you could stand in
[2:12:16] the presence of almighty God and just
[2:12:18] get soaked in his presence. I say, God,
[2:12:21] let it rain upon the people of God.
[2:12:24] Lord, let me be soaked in the presence
[2:12:26] of God from my head down to my feet.
[2:12:30] [Applause]
[2:12:32] It's harvest time. It's the season of
[2:12:36] rapture. Won't you stand to your feet
[2:12:38] tonight? It's the season of rapture. If
[2:12:40] we've already had a teaching reign, let
[2:12:42] me tell you what that means. It means
[2:12:45] that the seed has already been planted.
[2:12:48] Hello, somebody. Amen. If we've already
[2:12:50] had a harvest rain, that means the seeds
[2:12:52] already in the ground. You know what
[2:12:54] that means, brother Windle? That means
[2:12:56] you can turn to the devil and say,
[2:12:58] "Devil, you're too late.
[2:13:01] The seed's already been planted." Isn't
[2:13:03] that what Brother Bam said, "What
[2:13:05] happened in the garden?" He said, "The
[2:13:06] problem was that Satan got to Eve before
[2:13:09] before Adam did." He said, "But in this
[2:13:11] age, it didn't happen that way. God got
[2:13:13] to her first." Oh, hallelujah. I say,
[2:13:16] "Won't somebody look at the devil and
[2:13:18] say, "Devil, you're too late. It don't
[2:13:20] matter what he says. God done got to
[2:13:22] reverse. There's a seed in my life.
[2:13:24] There's a believer in me that God
[2:13:26] planted before the foundation of the
[2:13:28] world. And here, he planted his seed.
[2:13:30] And that seed has came to life." I say,
[2:13:32] "Devil, you're too late. It don't matter
[2:13:34] what he says." He said, "The days of
[2:13:35] miracles has passed." Brother Ram said,
[2:13:37] "You've come too late to tell me that
[2:13:39] God can't still do miracles." I say,
[2:13:41] "Devil, you're too late." He said, "You
[2:13:44] can't get your healing." I said, "You're
[2:13:46] too late." He said, "You can't have
[2:13:48] revival." I said, "You're too late." He
[2:13:50] said, "These young people can't be
[2:13:52] filled with the Holy Ghost." I said,
[2:13:53] "Devil, you're too late." Cuz the seed
[2:13:56] has already been planted and there are
[2:13:58] children can be saved. Oh, you can't
[2:14:00] have a rapture. You're too late. There
[2:14:02] won't be a body change. You're too late.
[2:14:04] You'll never be anything with God. I
[2:14:06] say, devil, you're too
[2:14:09] late. For the seed has already been
[2:14:12] planted in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:14:17] I say, devil, you're too late. You're
[2:14:20] too late.
[2:14:23] Hallelujah.
[2:14:25] You're too late. You can't be free.
[2:14:27] You're too late. You can't get delivered
[2:14:30] of alcoholism. You're too late.
[2:14:34] You You can't You can't You Your
[2:14:36] marriage can't ever be fixed. You're too
[2:14:38] late. God will never be able to use you
[2:14:40] in the house of God. You're too late.
[2:14:43] For the seed has already been planted.
[2:14:46] My isn't it something? It's arrived.
[2:14:49] Amen. You remember the story back in
[2:14:52] World War
[2:14:53] I how the those men got in trouble.
[2:14:57] There was a they were bunkered down in
[2:14:59] the midst of the midst of the battle.
[2:15:01] And here there was several hundred men
[2:15:03] that were there. The enemy, the German
[2:15:05] soldiers were shooting at them. their
[2:15:07] own American soldiers were shooting.
[2:15:09] They didn't know where they were. They
[2:15:10] were launching an attack upon the enemy
[2:15:13] and it was landed on. And here these
[2:15:15] men, they had these doves that was given
[2:15:18] to them by the French, these carrier
[2:15:21] pigeons. And they had one that was
[2:15:23] remaining after this war. And here they
[2:15:26] got in trouble. And so one of the
[2:15:28] captains, he pinned a note down on that
[2:15:30] on a piece of paper. He put in that
[2:15:33] little pigeon's leg and he tied it up on
[2:15:35] his leg. And that little p he was a a
[2:15:38] dove. It was his name was Sher Amy. If
[2:15:39] you ever want to look him up, they've
[2:15:40] got him in the Smithsonian, the
[2:15:42] taxiderermy works one day. He he lived
[2:15:45] out his life from his heroism. This
[2:15:48] little dove,
[2:15:50] Sherami, when they let him loose out of
[2:15:52] the bunker, the soldiers would say that
[2:15:55] as soon as he took flight, he got hit
[2:15:57] with his first shot. Here the enemy
[2:15:59] shoulders or soldiers were watching.
[2:16:01] They couldn't let the message reach its
[2:16:03] destination after all. So when it went
[2:16:05] up, they started shooting at it. And he
[2:16:08] came and he kept flying and he got hit
[2:16:09] and kept flying. He hit with a barrage,
[2:16:11] went through enemy attack 25 miles. They
[2:16:14] say that that bird traveled to get to
[2:16:16] his destination. And when he got to the
[2:16:19] headquarters, the keeper found him. That
[2:16:21] little dove was missing a leg. He had a
[2:16:24] wing that was battered, had holes in it.
[2:16:26] He had a hole in his chest. His whole
[2:16:28] body was bleeding and dangling off of
[2:16:31] that little leg that was not even there.
[2:16:33] Just at the top of the leg was a note
[2:16:35] that said, "Here's our coordinates.
[2:16:38] Here's right where we are and we need
[2:16:40] your help. Tell our tell our friends to
[2:16:42] quit shooting at us. We need your help.
[2:16:45] We can't win this battle by oursel. We
[2:16:47] We need to band together. We need your
[2:16:49] help. If y'all don't quit, we're we're
[2:16:51] all going to go down together. We're
[2:16:52] going to lose a lot of men." And history
[2:16:54] tells us when they got the note they
[2:16:56] were able to prevent the any further
[2:16:58] damage and there was 194 American
[2:17:01] soldiers lives that were saved by that
[2:17:03] little dove. The French army actually
[2:17:06] gave him the greatest medal of valor
[2:17:07] that they would ever give to any man.
[2:17:09] They gave it to that dove. I thought,
[2:17:11] isn't that something tonight that here
[2:17:14] in the midst of our great trouble in the
[2:17:17] midst of
[2:17:18] Leoa that God would send a message to
[2:17:20] his little bride.
[2:17:23] He would give the coordinates and he
[2:17:24] would give the very thing that she had
[2:17:26] need of to make it on the other side
[2:17:28] that we could come together in unity. He
[2:17:30] he would give the answer and he put that
[2:17:32] message in a little dove. And that dove
[2:17:35] came down to minister unto the people.
[2:17:37] Let me tell you what's happened. It's
[2:17:39] been shot at, by every Pharisee. It's
[2:17:42] been criticized by every critic, by
[2:17:44] every jealous spirit, by every
[2:17:46] everything the devil has. He's thrown at
[2:17:48] it. There's it's been he's been shooting
[2:17:51] hoes at it this entire
[2:17:53] time and here it stands. Holes shot all
[2:17:57] up in it, mangled all up. It may look to
[2:17:59] the world looks like it's all broke up
[2:18:02] in a thousand pieces. Looks like there
[2:18:03] ain't no unity or anything left in it.
[2:18:05] But friends, I've got news for you. I
[2:18:07] wish that little dove was standing here
[2:18:09] this morning cuz I'd like to tell him
[2:18:12] something. I'd like to tell him, I know
[2:18:14] that you've been made fun of, and I know
[2:18:17] you were ridiculed, and I I know you've
[2:18:19] been torn to pieces, and I know there's
[2:18:20] been holes that's been shot in your life
[2:18:22] for the life that you live. But I want
[2:18:25] to tell you something this tonight that
[2:18:28] the message made it
[2:18:29] home. I want to tell you tonight, it
[2:18:32] made that the message made it home. The
[2:18:34] seed has been planted. The very thing
[2:18:36] that you were called to do, it's made
[2:18:38] it. It's made it to its resting place.
[2:18:40] Friends, I stand here as a believer
[2:18:42] tonight to say the message has found its
[2:18:44] home in our hearts and the devil's too
[2:18:47] late to take it out. I say, why don't we
[2:18:50] just rejoice in the Lord? Say, "Oh God,
[2:18:52] I thank you tonight, Lord, that you
[2:18:54] called me to be a believer. Lord, I
[2:18:56] thank you for the message of the hour.
[2:18:58] Lord, I thank you for giving me the
[2:19:00] courage to be able to stand on the truth
[2:19:02] of God's
[2:19:03] word. And I thank you for the dove that
[2:19:06] brought it to me." Oh my. Don't you love
[2:19:10] the Lord? Can you sing, "Our God
[2:19:12] reigns." Our God reigns. Do you have
[2:19:14] that? Our God
[2:19:17] reigns. Amen. If you love the Lord
[2:19:20] tonight, Amen. Won't you just bow your
[2:19:23] heads? You say, "Brother
[2:19:26] Matt, I want that believer just to rise
[2:19:29] up in me and take control of my life."
[2:19:32] I don't know how many mean said, you
[2:19:34] know, you know, the Pharisees had a lot
[2:19:35] of say so lately, but I want to put him
[2:19:38] in his place. So, I just want to let him
[2:19:41] loose tonight and let God know whose
[2:19:44] side I'm
[2:19:45] on. Amen. Won't you just worship the
[2:19:48] Lord? Our God
[2:19:50] [Music]
[2:19:57] [Music]
[2:20:00] array. Our
[2:20:07] God. Our

[2:20:45] Lord. I know. My God. God reigns.
[2:20:51] Oh, how many can say he reigns supreme
[2:20:53] in my God reigns. Yes, he's my God.
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:20:59] Oh, my God reigns. Can you say it like
[2:21:02] this? Oh, I
[2:21:04] say he's still
[2:21:10] alive. I said he's still alive.
[2:21:18] I know he's still
[2:21:22] alive.
[2:21:24] Hallelujah. He's still
[2:21:29] alive. Oh, the seed
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:34] remains. Oh,
[2:21:35] hallelujah. I say the seed
[2:21:42] remains. for the seed
[2:21:47] remains. Thank you, Lord. And my God
[2:21:52] reigns. Can you sing a line to the devil
[2:21:55] tonight? I say, devil, you're too
[2:21:58] late.
[2:22:01] Hallelujah. I say you're too
[2:22:05] [Laughter]
[2:22:07] late. I know you're too late.
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:14] Hallelujah. Cuz my God
[2:22:19] reigns. I know the seed
[2:22:26] remains. Yes, the seed
[2:22:32] remains. For the sheep
[2:22:37] remains. Hallelujah.
[2:22:40] My
[2:22:43] God. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[2:22:48] [Music]
[2:22:53] [Applause]
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:55] clap? Amen. How many say the seed of God
[2:22:58] has found its resting place? Amen. Do
[2:23:00] you love the Lord tonight? Brother Sean
[2:23:03] told me I could sing a psalm. I'm I'm
[2:23:05] I'm going to try this. I think it's in
[2:23:07] the key. I don't know what key. Happy
[2:23:10] song. What key? F. Praise the Lord.
[2:23:14] Amen. We're gonna have church anyway.
[2:23:15] You love the Lord tonight. How many say
[2:23:18] your God reigns? How many believers do
[2:23:20] we have here
[2:23:23] [Music]
[2:23:28] tonight? Well, you said I couldn't make
[2:23:32] it. You told me not to try. But I'm
[2:23:36] going to live for Jesus until the day I
[2:23:40] die. I'm so tired of you,
[2:23:43] Satan. You've had me bound too
[2:23:49] long. Hell, I'm going to raise my hands
[2:23:52] toward heaven. I'm going to sing me a
[2:23:56] happy
[2:24:00] song. Well, you threw the Hebrew
[2:24:02] children in a red hot burning fire, but
[2:24:06] they came out the winner. And devil, you
[2:24:09] came out the liar. I'm so tired of you,
[2:24:13] Satan. You've had me bound too
[2:24:18] long. My I'm going to raise my hands
[2:24:21] toward heaven. I'm going to sing me a
[2:24:25] happy
[2:24:28] song. Well, you said I couldn't make it.
[2:24:32] You told me not to try. But I'm going to
[2:24:36] live for Jesus until the day I die. I'm
[2:24:40] so tired of you,
[2:24:42] Satan. You had me down too long.
[2:24:48] I'm on earth. Raise my hand to heaven.
[2:24:52] I'm going to
[2:24:54] sing. He said, "That's what's the matter
[2:24:56] with the church tonight." He said
[2:24:58] they've called of God. I believe they
[2:25:00] are. But the devil just makes a puppet
[2:25:03] out of them and he pushes them around
[2:25:05] from place to place. But what we need to
[2:25:07] do is to pull the mark with him and call
[2:25:10] the scripture on his hand. So I think we
[2:25:12] ought to look him in the eye and say,
[2:25:13] "Devil, you're too late." How many say
[2:25:16] it
[2:25:18] tonight?
[2:25:19] Well, well, I'm going to sing. Do you
[2:25:23] have a little bit?
[2:25:28] Well, listen to me, devil. I'll tell you
[2:25:31] what I'm going to do. You walked on me
[2:25:34] long enough, so I'm going to walk on
[2:25:37] you. I'm so tired of you,
[2:25:39] Satan. You have me bound too
[2:25:45] long. I'm going to raise my hands to
[2:25:49] heaven. I'm going to sing a happy song.

[2:45:07] God has healed me. Amen. Amen. And then
[2:45:11] the next day he'd say, "Yesterday I had
[2:45:14] a migraine, but God has healed me." He
[2:45:17] said, "I did that for 30
[2:45:19] years." And he said, "As the prayer line
[2:45:22] last year," he said, "I wasn't able to
[2:45:25] go on the prayer line, but he said, I
[2:45:26] was asked to help help people uh as as
[2:45:30] as they went through the prayer line."
[2:45:32] He said, "When I got up there," he said,
[2:45:34] "my headache left." And he said, "I
[2:45:37] never had another one
[2:45:40] since." Our God is
[2:45:43] awesome.

[2:49:02] for amen the word of God tonight. Amen.
[2:49:04] That we heard. Amen. Let's just bow our

[2:49:08] grateful for the opportunity to gather
[2:49:09] and to feast upon the spiritual food
[2:49:11] that we feasted upon tonight, Lord.
[2:49:13] Father, we thank you for the one that
[2:49:15] prepared it, Lord God. We know it was
[2:49:16] the Holy Spirit, but we thank you for
[2:49:18] the man that you spoke through tonight,
[2:49:19] Lord God, for yielding to that spirit to
[2:49:22] speak what we had need of, Lord God,
[2:49:24] that we could feast upon it tonight,
[2:49:25] Lord. And Father, as we leave this
[2:49:27] place, let us go, Lord, fed on your
[2:49:30] word, Lord God, with new strength, amen,
[2:49:32] to face another day, Lord. And Father,
[2:49:34] as we go to feast on the natural food
[2:49:36] that's been prepared for us, Lord, we
[2:49:38] ask that you would bless it to our
[2:49:39] bodies and our bodies under thy
[2:49:40] servants. Bless the hands of prepared
[2:49:42] it. Bless brother Shawn and all those
[2:49:44] that put their shoulders in the wheel to
[2:49:46] make these meetings pro so so
[2:49:48] prosperous, Lord God. We just thank you
[2:49:50] for them. And we look so forward to
[2:49:52] times of gathering like this around your
[2:49:54] word. And Lord God, as we dismiss from
[2:49:57] this building, Lord God, or from this
[2:49:58] tent, Father, we pray we'd never dismiss
[2:50:00] from your presence, have your way among
[2:50:02] us. Bring us back together at your
[2:50:03] appointed time. And we'll be careful to
[2:50:05] praise you and thank you in the
[2:50:06] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[2:50:08] Jesus Christ. Amen.
