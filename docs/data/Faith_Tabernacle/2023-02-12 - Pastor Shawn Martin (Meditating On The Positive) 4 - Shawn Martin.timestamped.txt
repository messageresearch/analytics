[39:29] and the 19th Chapter
[39:32] praise the lord it's just good to be a
[39:35] Christian
[39:36] and I can't just thank God enough for

[39:42] bringing me to the message of the hour
[39:44] and
[39:46] giving me a heart to believe in amen
[39:51] you know you you think of the so many in
[39:54] the world today that
[39:57] trying to find the answers or think they
[40:00] have the answers without vindication
[40:03] and but we're a people that know that we
[40:06] have the answers
[40:08] simply
[40:10] because we've seen the Vindication of
[40:12] God over and over and over
[40:15] amen and um
[40:18] we may not understand everything that
[40:20] God has done today but we know that he
[40:22] has done something
[40:24] and I'm just so glad for that amen it
[40:29] just puts my heart at rest
[40:31] and um
[40:33] we know that we can see the time that
[40:37] we're living in the day that we're
[40:39] living in
[40:40] and when the things that are going on
[40:43] out in the world
[40:45] Amen we we know that it's just exactly
[40:48] the way God's ordained it to be
[40:51] amen but we've been told to lift our
[40:54] head up
[40:55] amen for our Redemption draws tonight
[40:58] amen
[40:59] before we go into the word let's just
[41:01] bow our heads and talk to
[41:04] our father
[41:06] Lord Jesus
[41:09] it's words just can't express Lord what
[41:14] you are
[41:15] we tried Lord and
[41:18] even your spirit coming upon man to
[41:21] write the songs
[41:22] that we sing
[41:25] and yet Lord it it just can't express
[41:29] All That You Are
[41:32] the Lord we sing them
[41:34] because it's an expression of our heart
[41:38] to you Lord and let the world know that
[41:42] you are tremendous that your strength
[41:44] never fails
[41:46] Lord that you're high and exalted and
[41:49] You Are God Alone
[41:52] father and in our feeble efforts to
[41:55] describe you Lord we pray that it's
[41:57] pleasing in your sight
[42:00] and Lord may you just feel welcome in
[42:04] this place this evening
[42:06] Lord among your people among Believers
[42:09] father
[42:10] for We Believe Lord in the impossible We
[42:14] Believe father we don't limit you just
[42:18] to science or technology or even what
[42:21] our own mind can fathom
[42:23] that we believe beyond that Lord that
[42:26] you work when no one else can we know
[42:31] your work and even when we can't see it
[42:33] with our natural eye
[42:35] and oh God if you just come Among Us now
[42:40] and just do a work within every one of
[42:43] us Lord and we give you the room to do
[42:46] so
[42:47] we give you the Liberty to do so for
[42:49] your God and all we thank you Lord
[42:52] anoint the word not the speaking anoint
[42:57] the hearing of your word we ask it in
[43:00] Jesus name amen
[43:04] we look at Psalms here the 19th I
[43:08] believe chapter
[43:09] and I just want to read the uh 14th
[43:15] verse praise the Lord but it says let
[43:18] the words of my mouth
[43:21] and the meditation of my heart be
[43:23] acceptable in thy sight O Lord my
[43:28] strength and my redeemer amen you can
[43:32] have your seats this evening
[43:34] praise the Lord
[43:38] you know
[43:40] just going to be simple this evening and
[43:43] not to take you time too much but
[43:47] before the world
[43:50] God chose to work through man
[43:54] and as I've said it today and and we all
[43:59] know it
[44:01] but God chose a specific people
[44:05] that he would work through but but yet
[44:09] uh uh I I believe that he he had
[44:12] predestinated a people to every age
[44:15] and as the prophet would tell us that he
[44:18] would lay his word out for each age and
[44:22] then there would be a people come along
[44:23] in that age to fulfill and to manifest
[44:27] that word
[44:28] but we know that he can work through
[44:31] most any man
[44:34] um
[44:36] you know he he has that right he has
[44:39] that ability to do that and
[44:42] um he came and has anointed uh men who
[44:47] are converted and would never be saved
[44:51] they're they're lost and uh and we read
[44:54] about it throughout the Bible
[44:58] um you know just comes to my mind Balaam
[45:01] and how that Balaam was a false prophet
[45:04] but he was a prophet and he come to to
[45:08] um to curse Israel and yet when he every
[45:12] time he opened his mouth he blessed
[45:15] Israel
[45:16] uh and then prophecies still stand
[45:18] because it was the word of the Lord
[45:20] coming through that man
[45:22] we we look at it all the way even down
[45:25] through uh to Judas uh which was the son
[45:28] of perdition
[45:30] and uh yeah he was among those that was
[45:34] anointed to heal the sick cast out
[45:36] devils and and these things and yet we
[45:40] see the end and and uh the Bible says he
[45:45] was the son of perdition he was of that
[45:47] Wicked one and so uh when the anointing
[45:52] though goes off of them then they they
[45:56] return back to what they were before the
[45:59] anointing Came Upon them and so uh uh so
[46:04] God can use anyone that he wants to and
[46:08] some people again when the anointing
[46:11] comes their use for specific specific
[46:14] reasons specific purpose and when the
[46:16] anointing lifts they go back to what
[46:19] what what they were
[46:22] um and and so and such again was the
[46:25] case of Caiaphas uh he prophesied among
[46:29] among them and and
[46:33] um and and and then yet had Jesus
[46:36] crucified and these things but he was
[46:39] truly anointed ain't that right so but
[46:42] then there is a people that God has
[46:45] Supreme control over
[46:48] and uh and these are the ones that are
[46:51] the Overcomers these are the ones that
[46:54] are changed forever these are the ones
[46:58] that's been purchased with the blood of
[47:00] Jesus Christ and and they are the ones
[47:03] that Paul would say you're not your own
[47:06] uh you've been bought with the price
[47:08] therefore glorify God in your body and
[47:12] so they are the ones that God works
[47:14] through not just to prophesy not just to
[47:17] dance not just to preach not just to
[47:20] play music not just to whatever amen but
[47:24] these are ones that God has uh called
[47:28] for himself uh to to defeat demonic
[47:32] Powers
[47:33] um and to they are the ones at the third
[47:36] pool operates in they're the ones that
[47:39] comes into this adoption they are the
[47:42] ones as Adam that has dominion and so um
[47:48] I believe that God strategically
[47:51] made us for this purpose and the way he
[47:56] designed us is important and it's
[48:00] something that I guess that we should
[48:03] know how does he use us how how do we
[48:07] overcome how do we make the word work
[48:11] for us and again my my thought is
[48:15] meditating on the positive
[48:18] um I think these are legitimate
[48:20] questions
[48:22] um it's it's
[48:23] we we should think about things we we
[48:27] should want to understand things I you
[48:30] know it's fine to go to church and have
[48:32] have a good Rendezvous and go home and
[48:37] then but what did the service mean to us
[48:40] what what what what is my life here as a
[48:43] husband as a uh you know I was going to
[48:45] say as a wife I'm not a wife but what
[48:47] what
[48:48] what does what what does the meaning for
[48:51] you women to be wives or to be mothers
[48:55] dads to be husbands and why would God
[48:58] choose us and and and and these things
[49:01] why does God bring us into the message
[49:03] of the hour
[49:05] um you know and what makes us different
[49:08] what what is behind it all what's his
[49:11] plans and and things like that and and
[49:14] so now you know
[49:16] um I think these are legitimate
[49:19] questions simply because uh we know that
[49:22] his word is a seed and that his word has
[49:26] to fall in ground it's it's going to
[49:28] fall uh and we are that ground that the
[49:32] seed falls upon ain't that right and so
[49:35] Jesus spoke of the four types of ground
[49:38] and Matthew uh 13 and 3 starting he says
[49:43] in breaking in it just says behold A
[49:45] sower went forth the soul now he's
[49:49] saying this for a reason he ain't just
[49:50] telling you a past history lesson that
[49:53] he's this is prophetic and uh that
[49:57] applies to you and I and he says or into
[50:00] this world it applies to the world in
[50:03] mankind and when he sowed some seeds
[50:07] fell by the wayside and the fowls came
[50:10] and divired it up
[50:12] uh some fell up on Stony places where
[50:16] they had not much Earth and forthwith
[50:19] they sprang up because they had no
[50:22] deepness of Earth and when the sun was
[50:26] up they were scorched and because they
[50:29] had no root they withered away and so
[50:32] talking about the word right and so some
[50:35] fail among thorns and
[50:38] the Thorns sprung up and choked them but
[50:42] other fell into good ground and brought
[50:45] forth fruit and some hundredfolds some
[50:48] 64 some 34 ain't that right so we know
[50:52] that the seed is the word of God and so
[50:55] the seed is thrown out there it's sown
[50:58] but not not everybody produces the word
[51:03] not the word is not productive in every
[51:07] ground but there's some that is good
[51:10] ground that brings forth the word and so
[51:14] if we are the good ground which I I
[51:18] believe that I'm good ground and I you'd
[51:21] believe that way yourself uh then the
[51:24] word is sown into us that word that is
[51:27] sown into US is to prosper
[51:31] ain't that right it it's got to prosper
[51:34] God means for the word to prosper so
[51:38] God's left us tapes God's left us books
[51:41] to read of the message of the hour
[51:44] not every book that is written out out
[51:46] that you see in the Bible book story
[51:48] that's not for you
[51:51] good books maybe but not for you but
[51:54] there are books and that is the message
[51:56] of the hour there are tapes and uh and I
[52:00] know Ministries make a lot of tapes but
[52:02] there are tapes that that are for you
[52:05] and that is the message of this hour
[52:07] ain't that right and and so uh uh and
[52:12] then then we come to church what's the
[52:15] purpose of Us coming to church just so
[52:17] we do our duty that I don't believe that
[52:20] I I think God wants us to come to church
[52:22] God's brought ministers you've got you
[52:25] know you've you've we've got pastors
[52:28] we've got evangelists we've got teachers
[52:30] and we've got uh missionaries and and
[52:33] all of these things and everyone's got
[52:35] their part and yet we've got we've got
[52:37] them all out there that uh that that in
[52:41] all kinds of denominations and all of
[52:43] that and I'm going to exclude a lot of
[52:45] that and and tell you there that there's
[52:47] Real Men of God that are preaching the
[52:49] message of the hour
[52:51] and and we should be concerned about
[52:53] these things because you know uh brother
[52:56] Branham talks about how that if you've
[52:58] got a bowl of soup and at from a
[53:00] restaurant and you saw fly and here's
[53:02] that soup or even a hair I mean that's
[53:05] for me you know if I see a hair in my
[53:07] food that's it done
[53:09] you know I ain't touching that food you
[53:12] know well brother Brown says if you're
[53:14] going to do that on the natural what
[53:15] about what we put in the soul
[53:18] because it's important do you believe
[53:20] that so then we we find that that we we
[53:25] we we've got to realize that we're
[53:27] ground and and and and and again we're
[53:31] looking that we're good ground and so
[53:34] then then we're whatever Falls uh in US
[53:39] then then it's meant to to grow it's
[53:43] meant uh you understand what I'm saying
[53:45] and so if we receive just any word if we
[53:49] receive I and and you just have to
[53:52] forgive me I'm gonna try to get
[53:53] somewhere in just a moment but I'm
[53:55] thinking of how uh uh acceptable
[53:58] children are if you take the child and
[54:01] you belittle that child and constantly
[54:03] tell him he's no good and he's he's this
[54:05] and he's a failure and and these things
[54:08] well what you're doing is you're
[54:10] planting words into that child you're
[54:13] planning them and what you're doing is
[54:14] You're Building complexes in that child
[54:16] before you know it he begins to believe
[54:18] it an innocent little baby grows up and
[54:22] he becomes a teenager he becomes a grown
[54:25] man and and he can actually even be get
[54:27] married and all that and he still has
[54:29] these complexes he still battles the
[54:32] words that you were planning as when he
[54:35] was just a little kid and ain't that
[54:37] right you can plant fear in a child you
[54:40] can plant you can plant positiveness in
[54:43] a child you can put because words are
[54:45] seeds ain't that right and and so I I
[54:50] think every chance we get we we ought to
[54:54] tell our child and this is just
[54:55] naturally how good they are and how
[54:57] positive they are even when you correct
[54:59] them you know how much you love that
[55:01] child and you love them and and you you
[55:04] you you and it's because even though
[55:07] through the correction you're planting
[55:09] seeds in that child that you're positive
[55:12] God's got something for you amen you're
[55:15] you're you're you're God's God's got a
[55:18] Rapture for you don't just leave them
[55:20] for the world to put things in that
[55:23] plant seeds
[55:25] ain't that right because after all we we
[55:29] are ground
[55:30] amen I think we could even do that with
[55:33] marriage at the same time amen you know
[55:37] but I love to tell my wife I love her
[55:40] and I I
[55:42] um how she's beautiful how she's uh
[55:45] means so much to me you know now we may
[55:49] have our spats we may have our little
[55:51] differences but if I just leave it to
[55:53] that
[55:54] then it'll build complexes and all that
[55:57] and I know how Satan does he tries to
[55:58] work them complexes you know he tries to
[56:01] plant them and there might be some
[56:03] things that I say that I shouldn't say
[56:05] that I always want to plant good things
[56:09] that that she's the love of my life and
[56:11] I ain't just saying that I mean that you
[56:13] know well because she she's ground she's
[56:17] she's a ground and so I want to plant
[56:19] seeds you understand what I'm saying
[56:21] just want to plant seeds well if if we
[56:25] understand that we are uh we are aground
[56:29] then then we we get that understanding
[56:32] based off of the Bible because Jesus
[56:35] calls us ground we are ground for God's
[56:39] word to be productive
[56:42] ain't that right so that's why you
[56:45] should never look at the word of God in
[56:47] a negative way because I don't believe
[56:49] that's what God intends us for us to
[56:52] understand the word of God
[56:54] Amen brother Ryan tells us the word of
[56:56] God is a love story it's a love letter
[56:58] to his bride and it's it's actually a
[57:01] word of God is God revealing love
[57:04] Secrets Whispering love secrets to his
[57:06] bride
[57:07] why he's wanting to instill seed in US
[57:11] it's it's something that he's building
[57:13] his bride up
[57:14] you believe that words are are something
[57:18] that is is is so we say stick sticks and
[57:22] stones may break my bones but words will
[57:24] never hurt me that's a lie
[57:26] words do a lot of damage
[57:28] and so we we we look at it and and by
[57:33] our opening scripture we understand that
[57:36] not all words and not all meditation uh
[57:42] is acceptable unto God ain't that right
[57:46] for for the uh the the the writers
[57:49] asking Let My Words and the meditation
[57:54] of my heart the words of my mouth the
[57:57] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[58:01] unto thee ain't that right and so now we
[58:05] know that we can sin with our words and
[58:08] with what we meditate upon amen The Book
[58:11] of Job tells us that job did not sin
[58:15] with his lips
[58:17] ain't that right now I'm going to read
[58:19] some scriptures here Psalm 17 3 uh
[58:23] breaking in I believe it's David that
[58:25] said I am purposed that my mouth shall
[58:29] not transgress
[58:31] another place says Psalm 71 8 let my
[58:35] mouth be filled with thy praise and With
[58:39] Thine honor all the day
[58:43] Psalm 71 15 my mouth shall show forth my
[58:49] mouth a man shall show forth thy
[58:52] righteousness and thy salvation all the
[58:56] day so in other words I'm going to speak
[58:58] I'm going to project my words will
[59:01] project thy righteousness and thy
[59:03] salvation all the day
[59:06] Psalms 89 1 I will sing of the mercies
[59:10] of the Lord forever
[59:14] and with my mouth will I make known Thy
[59:18] Faithfulness to all generations
[59:21] so it's important what we say it's
[59:24] important the words that come out it's
[59:27] important what we say to the generations
[59:29] that is coming up how we project God how
[59:33] we project his word how we understand
[59:35] his word because if we have no
[59:37] understanding of his word then we cannot
[59:40] project his word right to the Next
[59:42] Generation
[59:44] ain't that right so I'm going to sing of
[59:46] the mercies of the Lord forever and with
[59:49] my mouth will I make known Thy
[59:51] Faithfulness to all generations in
[59:54] Proverbs it says Break It In My Mouth
[59:56] shall speak truth
[1:00:00] ain't that right now now we know what
[1:00:02] the Bible says Thy word is truth so my
[1:00:06] mouth shall speak Thy word ain't that
[1:00:08] right so now I as as I have said before
[1:00:12] you know Adam before he fell he didn't
[1:00:16] think anything of he didn't think of
[1:00:18] anything else but the word that's all he
[1:00:20] had was the word ain't that right it was
[1:00:23] the word he didn't speak anything but
[1:00:25] the word he didn't think anything but
[1:00:27] the word he had Dominion by the word it
[1:00:31] was the word that gave him that Dominion
[1:00:33] ain't that right amen he had power what
[1:00:36] he said came to pass
[1:00:39] you believe it that's why he just didn't
[1:00:42] have idle thinking he didn't just have
[1:00:44] all these kind of thoughts and he didn't
[1:00:46] meditate on us all these stocks he he
[1:00:49] was behind the word it was before sin
[1:00:51] came he had power with his words so he
[1:00:55] didn't just speak anything because he
[1:00:56] knew that what he said came to pass
[1:01:00] ain't that right so he didn't speak out
[1:01:02] of words like men do today he didn't
[1:01:04] think vain thoughts like men do today
[1:01:07] see he knew that his words had power
[1:01:12] it was only after the fall that Adam
[1:01:15] spoke words that expressed doubt and
[1:01:18] fear
[1:01:19] it was then that you know uh Adam would
[1:01:23] speak after the fall it was he spoke as
[1:01:28] one without Authority
[1:01:31] Jesus spoke with one as one with
[1:01:33] authority but now Adam how different
[1:01:36] that was Adam had once come to a place
[1:01:40] of authority he had that Authority his
[1:01:43] words had power
[1:01:45] brother Ram said it he could speak to a
[1:01:48] tree tree be plucked from there and be
[1:01:49] planted here
[1:01:50] he he could rearrange anything
[1:01:53] because he was God of the Earth
[1:01:56] and his words had the power but when sin
[1:01:59] came he lost that power
[1:02:03] now he was speaking negative things and
[1:02:05] look what the effect it had
[1:02:08] so but Redemption brings us back to what
[1:02:12] Adam lost and fell from ain't that right
[1:02:16] so now through Redemption
[1:02:20] God has provided a way and it's all
[1:02:24] based off of Calvary Redemption but God
[1:02:28] has provided us a way to where we could
[1:02:31] come back
[1:02:33] as Adam
[1:02:35] ain't that right
[1:02:38] God thinking for just a moment of God's
[1:02:42] plans he knew what he was going to do he
[1:02:44] knew he knew the sin and so he knew he
[1:02:48] was going to destroy so he sent Noah and
[1:02:51] Noah built an ark
[1:02:53] and he prepared that Ark and and brother
[1:02:56] Branham would ask the question why why
[1:02:59] would Noah come and prepare an ark
[1:03:02] and the answer he said was God was going
[1:03:06] to destroy the enemies of the world so
[1:03:08] God had to build a way to prepare to
[1:03:13] ride through it
[1:03:15] and so
[1:03:18] I got to say get to that and I'm looking
[1:03:20] it up because looking at this they hear
[1:03:22] Brother Branham begins to speak of the
[1:03:25] conditions of the world that that we're
[1:03:27] living in today and and he would talk
[1:03:31] about it and look where we're at today
[1:03:32] and we can identify and but he talked
[1:03:36] about how man is getting weaker and is
[1:03:38] becoming more susceptible to diseases he
[1:03:42] said the inner breeding and so forth has
[1:03:44] broke down the structure of the human
[1:03:46] being till it's nothing but a bunch of
[1:03:48] muck a ball of sickness and what done it
[1:03:52] science
[1:03:53] he said see look it's caused the genes
[1:03:56] between the man and the woman to weaken
[1:03:58] the physical weakness of the human being
[1:04:01] through the genes and the increase of of
[1:04:04] children is around 30 percent
[1:04:08] uh Mongolian uh is on the great climb
[1:04:12] and these weaknesses of breed
[1:04:15] interbreeding of the foods that we are
[1:04:17] eating for life is weakening the body
[1:04:19] which causes cancer mental troubles all
[1:04:24] kinds of diseases is setting in upon the
[1:04:27] human body because it's weakness yeah
[1:04:32] ain't that right
[1:04:34] we have we have found there there's not
[1:04:38] a more age than what is today of mental
[1:04:41] problems
[1:04:42] having mental everything becomes mental
[1:04:45] young people fighting mental
[1:04:49] battles uh brother Brown said it's a
[1:04:52] neurotic age mental
[1:04:54] and we're fighting mental pressures
[1:04:57] are we not and and and so now brother
[1:05:00] Branham is given us a an Insight is of
[1:05:05] what is causing these things that that
[1:05:08] are happening and it's the foods that
[1:05:11] we're eating it's it's something that is
[1:05:14] starting to break down and I uh um uh
[1:05:18] autistic children and things I've
[1:05:21] listened to the radio about a year ago
[1:05:23] and they said that it never uh has it
[1:05:27] been since in this this time that
[1:05:31] autistic children is is coming more
[1:05:34] autistic children are being born and
[1:05:36] things and you know what they place it
[1:05:38] upon Foods
[1:05:40] I thought wow you're a prophet told us
[1:05:43] years ago and here now they're they're
[1:05:45] describing describing this as the as as
[1:05:48] the foods now brother Brandon said 30
[1:05:51] years ago he said about I gave a
[1:05:54] prophecy that it would come to pass that
[1:05:55] in the last days there would be diseases
[1:05:57] amongst animals amongst cattle eggs even
[1:06:01] to eggs and it would come to pass that
[1:06:04] there would be eggs that wouldn't be fit
[1:06:06] to eat and it would come to pass that
[1:06:08] people living in The Valleys he said now
[1:06:10] remember I prophesied that way back 30
[1:06:13] years ago that it would come to pass
[1:06:15] that people living in valleys that I'd
[1:06:18] ask the Christians to move from the
[1:06:19] valley and then not to eat and different
[1:06:22] meats and things like that would be
[1:06:23] poison it'd be dangerous he said I
[1:06:26] believe I had it like that or for people
[1:06:28] to live in valleys and and things like
[1:06:30] that now we're we're coming into a place
[1:06:33] of of of these things happening uh uh uh
[1:06:38] diseases and breaking out and these
[1:06:40] things but what
[1:06:41] I got to thinking about this that we're
[1:06:44] not to fear
[1:06:46] everybody say we're not to fear
[1:06:48] we hear Jesus say fear not he says it
[1:06:51] quite often fear not
[1:06:54] and here in in the Book of Revelations I
[1:06:57] believe the the the first chapter
[1:07:00] Jesus as he's revealing says fear not
[1:07:04] for I am he that was dead and is alive
[1:07:06] again
[1:07:08] and I have the keys of death hell in the
[1:07:11] grave
[1:07:12] so we're not to fear because he is
[1:07:15] showing himself as the Conqueror
[1:07:18] ain't that right and what is he he's the
[1:07:21] word
[1:07:22] he is the word I'm I'm getting to a
[1:07:26] point
[1:07:28] brother random says you know because
[1:07:30] we're you know as I say we're not to
[1:07:33] fear
[1:07:34] because a way has been provided for us
[1:07:38] just as God provided a way for Noah the
[1:07:41] the danger was coming destruction was
[1:07:45] coming but God would provide a way that
[1:07:50] that Noah and that that elect could ride
[1:07:53] through it
[1:07:55] ain't that right
[1:07:57] brother Brandon says this God has made a
[1:08:00] way to destroy that cancer
[1:08:04] God has made a way to take blindness out
[1:08:08] of them eyes
[1:08:10] God has made a way do you believe that
[1:08:12] I believe that God has made a way to
[1:08:16] take away arthritis
[1:08:18] I believe that God has made a way to
[1:08:21] take away the heart conditions
[1:08:24] believe that God God has made a way I
[1:08:27] know the diseases are coming upon the
[1:08:29] land that God has made a way a man to
[1:08:34] take them from his people
[1:08:38] I just believe that
[1:08:40] I believe you you look at even Moses of
[1:08:44] how that that uh um uh when he come the
[1:08:49] plagues fell and they failed but they
[1:08:52] didn't fall on everybody
[1:08:55] they just fell upon a certain group
[1:08:58] but when it came to Israel God's people
[1:09:04] it never fell on them
[1:09:06] ain't that right never fell on them
[1:09:10] amen and so see God has made a way and
[1:09:13] that's what we've got to look at God has
[1:09:16] made a way now brother Bradham says now
[1:09:18] and I think this is important uh you
[1:09:21] know he just he just says it calmly and
[1:09:23] yet uh I I think how he brings that in
[1:09:27] it's important he says and what we are
[1:09:30] trying to do with this word this morning
[1:09:32] is to build something everybody say
[1:09:36] build something
[1:09:37] to build something for you to ride
[1:09:41] through on your Victory and that's God's
[1:09:46] word
[1:09:48] ain't that right see God's word thus
[1:09:51] saith the Lord see right through on his
[1:09:55] word
[1:09:57] God said so
[1:10:00] ain't that right so we're seeing it all
[1:10:03] come to pass
[1:10:05] destructions are in the land the death
[1:10:08] angel is rioting
[1:10:10] it's affecting the the physical being
[1:10:13] it's affecting the the mental
[1:10:17] it's affecting the soul it's affecting
[1:10:19] everything
[1:10:21] ain't that right
[1:10:23] our church is being that the churches
[1:10:25] around the world being affected by
[1:10:28] politics being affected governments
[1:10:30] everything is being affected because God
[1:10:33] Made A Way
[1:10:37] he's made a way for you to ride through
[1:10:39] victory
[1:10:41] and that is the word of God
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] now thinking back again let the
[1:10:49] meditation of my heart the words of my
[1:10:52] mouth be acceptable
[1:10:55] we are a threefold being bodies spirit
[1:10:59] and soul
[1:11:01] the body is the outside man the spirit
[1:11:04] is the Inside Man
[1:11:06] and Satan has access to both
[1:11:10] just as much as God has access but Satan
[1:11:13] has access to these things
[1:11:16] but it's the Inner Man the soul is the
[1:11:19] inner man that's on the inside of the
[1:11:22] inside right that's the soul and so each
[1:11:26] of us if I could say it this way each of
[1:11:28] us determines who has access
[1:11:32] to that
[1:11:35] and and so uh uh
[1:11:39] these three things determine
[1:11:43] what we meditate and speak
[1:11:47] and I I really pray that the Lord helps
[1:11:50] me make it clear and again I'm not going
[1:11:52] to take long so you just hang in there
[1:11:54] with me
[1:11:56] see the words that we speak
[1:11:59] are the meditation of our thoughts
[1:12:03] because a word is just an expression of
[1:12:07] a thought
[1:12:08] it has to be a thought first
[1:12:10] then it becomes a word
[1:12:13] ain't that right
[1:12:15] even your actions are a result of your
[1:12:19] thoughts brother Ram says anytime a
[1:12:21] woman takes a wrong step she has to
[1:12:23] First receive it in her mind
[1:12:26] some Slicker has to persuade her she
[1:12:28] listens to it against her own judgment
[1:12:30] then the ACT is committed so first Satan
[1:12:34] hit his mind
[1:12:36] in the womb of her mind she doubted
[1:12:39] God's word then come the actual Act
[1:12:44] you see what I'm saying
[1:12:47] so another place Eve believes Satan's
[1:12:50] lie see and received it into the womb of
[1:12:54] her mind
[1:12:55] and that polluted her soul and set death
[1:12:59] in the soul then the natural Act take
[1:13:01] place
[1:13:03] ain't that right
[1:13:04] but notice then we find brother Brown
[1:13:07] talking about Mary
[1:13:08] how of her physical mind was the womb
[1:13:12] ain't that right
[1:13:13] it was the physical womb of uh a virgin
[1:13:17] wound her her physical mind was the
[1:13:20] Virgin womb why because she believed
[1:13:24] everybody say she believed she believed
[1:13:27] God's word regardless
[1:13:29] of what anybody else said
[1:13:32] she believes regardless of how
[1:13:35] impossible it was
[1:13:37] she believed regardless whether whether
[1:13:42] uh uh the preacher believed it whether
[1:13:45] Joseph believed it whether the the
[1:13:48] Deacon believed it she just believed it
[1:13:51] because her mind was virgin wound
[1:13:56] can you say mine brother Brown said see
[1:13:59] first it was her mind
[1:14:03] he says before the act ever taken place
[1:14:07] in her literal womb the ACT took place
[1:14:11] in here first see to let the script or
[1:14:16] the Spirit come in to do the rest of the
[1:14:19] work
[1:14:20] before the actual spiritual birth can
[1:14:24] take place the word has to find itself
[1:14:27] through your mind to believe it
[1:14:31] and you say Amen
[1:14:33] now if you notice the word the word
[1:14:35] because he says I'm going to lay the
[1:14:37] word out for you to ride through I'm I'm
[1:14:39] laying that word so see the word is
[1:14:43] important ain't that right
[1:14:45] the word is important and the word came
[1:14:48] to both Eve and Mary two women came came
[1:14:51] to both and Satan's lie came to both
[1:14:54] women as well
[1:14:56] Eve chose to receive Satan's lie
[1:15:01] she received his lie into her mind
[1:15:05] ain't that right
[1:15:06] but Mary chose to receive the word into
[1:15:11] her mind the word of God into her mind
[1:15:14] now the prophet said that Satan came to
[1:15:17] her just as well you know it can't
[1:15:19] happen you know what they're going to
[1:15:20] say you know how ridiculed they're gonna
[1:15:22] they're gonna laugh at you they're gonna
[1:15:24] make fun of you you know that can never
[1:15:26] happen when has it ever happened he came
[1:15:29] to her in her reasoning
[1:15:31] but she cast it all aside and accepted
[1:15:34] the word of God
[1:15:37] ain't that right now you're going to
[1:15:39] receive something in your mind
[1:15:42] ain't that right you're going to receive
[1:15:45] something in your mind
[1:15:47] and and there's no way of getting around
[1:15:49] it there's going to be meditation of
[1:15:53] your mind
[1:15:55] and and you're gonna think on things I I
[1:15:58] don't care what it is
[1:15:59] what you watch you're gonna think on it
[1:16:02] what you listen to you're going to think
[1:16:04] on it
[1:16:05] tonight you're going to think on things
[1:16:07] ain't that right what you've seen you're
[1:16:09] going to think on it what you've heard
[1:16:12] what what whatever it's going to enter
[1:16:14] and you're going to have uh uh the
[1:16:17] meditation now God gave Adam and Eve his
[1:16:22] word
[1:16:23] for them to meditate upon
[1:16:26] you believe that and not only just to
[1:16:29] meditate on but to speak it
[1:16:32] and his word was meant to bring life to
[1:16:37] them life upon the Earth
[1:16:40] ain't that right she was to receive the
[1:16:43] word and it was to prosper
[1:16:47] Eve wants to receive that word and it
[1:16:50] was to prosper
[1:16:53] can you say Amen remember there was no
[1:16:56] other word given to them
[1:16:58] until Satan came along
[1:17:01] Satan would enter into that Serpent and
[1:17:04] begin to tell his lies to Eve
[1:17:06] Satan's lies had no power over her
[1:17:10] Satan's lies had no dictate over her
[1:17:14] ain't that right Satan's lies Could Do
[1:17:17] no harm to her
[1:17:20] that's true
[1:17:22] he was only just giving them to her he
[1:17:25] was only just tell it he was only just
[1:17:28] speaking
[1:17:29] but what did Brother Brown say she
[1:17:31] stopped
[1:17:33] to listen to him
[1:17:36] and she began to reason with it
[1:17:39] and remember he was twisting that word
[1:17:42] up
[1:17:43] just enough to get her attention
[1:17:47] ain't that right now the problem was she
[1:17:50] was already lusting for something
[1:17:52] greater
[1:17:53] that's what the prophet said she was
[1:17:56] looking for no more light
[1:17:58] and Satan was promising her more light
[1:18:02] and it caused her to stop and to listen
[1:18:06] ain't that right
[1:18:08] see but it could have done her no harm
[1:18:10] until she listened and then she received
[1:18:13] it
[1:18:15] ain't that right now today you've not
[1:18:19] only got the word but you got Satan's
[1:18:21] lie
[1:18:23] that's the battles
[1:18:25] we battle ain't that right go through
[1:18:28] the battles
[1:18:29] amen you've got we've got God's word and
[1:18:32] we have Satan's lie remember in second
[1:18:35] Thessalonians 2 9. uh through 12 it says
[1:18:39] even him whose coming is after the
[1:18:42] working of Satan with all power and
[1:18:43] signs and line wanders with all
[1:18:46] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:18:49] them that perish because they receive
[1:18:51] not the love of the truth
[1:18:55] that they might be saved for this cause
[1:18:58] now notice the truth would have saved
[1:19:00] them
[1:19:01] do you believe that the truth would have
[1:19:04] saved him and the word is truth
[1:19:07] God sent a prophet to save the people
[1:19:12] can you say amen that's right he knew
[1:19:15] what was coming
[1:19:16] just as he knew he was going to destroy
[1:19:18] the Earth
[1:19:19] but he sent a prophet to make a
[1:19:22] preparation
[1:19:24] and it was only eight that he come
[1:19:26] toward but that was enough
[1:19:28] and if it was just one for this day God
[1:19:32] would have still done it
[1:19:33] but he didn't waste time to send a
[1:19:36] prophet he sent a prophet for a reason
[1:19:38] can you say Amen
[1:19:40] now and so we find that with all
[1:19:42] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:19:45] them that perish because they received
[1:19:47] not the love of the truth that they
[1:19:49] might be saved for this calls God shall
[1:19:52] send them strong delusion that they
[1:19:54] should believe alive brother Brown said
[1:19:55] velai
[1:19:57] ain't that right the same lie that was
[1:19:59] Satan presented to Eve it's the same lie
[1:20:02] he's done today
[1:20:04] amen see that they might all be damned
[1:20:08] who believe not the truth but had
[1:20:11] pleasure in unrighteousness
[1:20:13] now I'm telling you amen for a believer
[1:20:16] that believes the truth he cannot be
[1:20:19] damned he cannot be destroyed he cannot
[1:20:22] be cursed he cannot be amen Satan can't
[1:20:25] have no power over him
[1:20:29] ain't that right
[1:20:30] it's to them that has not a love for the
[1:20:33] truth
[1:20:34] they might believe not the truth then
[1:20:36] God sends a lie to them
[1:20:38] now that lie Satan Satan torments our
[1:20:42] minds you know because the Battleground
[1:20:43] is in the mind
[1:20:45] ain't that right but now listen the
[1:20:48] truth is presented and the LIE is
[1:20:51] presented God presents his truth and
[1:20:54] he's more record by Vindication that
[1:20:56] it's the truth and then Satan brings his
[1:20:59] own lies
[1:21:02] ain't that right
[1:21:03] but now what does God's word tell us
[1:21:06] because now we're talking about every
[1:21:07] individual here
[1:21:08] what does God tell us as individuals
[1:21:11] cast down everybody say cast down every
[1:21:15] imagination
[1:21:16] do you have the power to cast them down
[1:21:18] yes you do have that power
[1:21:20] God's word
[1:21:22] God's word eve had the power to cast it
[1:21:25] down but she didn't do it
[1:21:26] but you have the power to cast it down
[1:21:28] the same word that came to Eve has come
[1:21:31] to us
[1:21:32] it's been restored to us can you say
[1:21:35] Amen
[1:21:38] this message this this message did not
[1:21:41] come mixed up amen with all kinds of
[1:21:44] ideas and all that is the perfect word
[1:21:46] perfect interpretation
[1:21:49] can you say Amen now that word tells us
[1:21:53] to cast down every imagination don't you
[1:21:57] sit there and say well I just can't do
[1:21:58] it I just don't know I just you've got
[1:22:01] the power with the word of God
[1:22:05] and the and he says cast down every
[1:22:08] imagination and the high thing that
[1:22:10] exalteth itself above the knowledge of
[1:22:13] God or the word of God right the
[1:22:15] knowledge of God the word of God that's
[1:22:18] right and then as we've we've quoted the
[1:22:20] script or read the scripture before read
[1:22:22] it again that we're told to think upon
[1:22:25] things that are true
[1:22:26] think about things that are honest think
[1:22:29] about things that are just think about
[1:22:31] things that are pure think about things
[1:22:33] that are lovely think about things that
[1:22:35] have a good report
[1:22:37] can you say Amen now why because that
[1:22:40] come from God's word
[1:22:42] Satan's lie is not honest Satan's lie
[1:22:45] does not have just in it there's nothing
[1:22:48] about Satan's lie that God tells you to
[1:22:50] think about then lies you've got to cast
[1:22:54] out
[1:22:56] cast down can you say Amen how do you
[1:22:59] cast down the word gives you the
[1:23:01] authority to do so
[1:23:03] yeah
[1:23:05] why you're gonna ride through this thing
[1:23:09] right to it
[1:23:11] why because they're going to be people
[1:23:13] that spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:23:15] and we ain't like the Baptist that now
[1:23:17] now you have to excuse me here but but
[1:23:19] we're not like the Baptist say well God
[1:23:21] you know God save me and I'm good and so
[1:23:23] and then we just live oh like a hell
[1:23:25] hole
[1:23:26] our house is just a hell trap
[1:23:31] hello
[1:23:33] I don't believe that I understand we got
[1:23:35] weaknesses and I understand we fall and
[1:23:37] I understand these things but I believe
[1:23:39] there's a power
[1:23:41] I believe there's a power power to write
[1:23:43] through this thing unscathed that we
[1:23:47] will overcome and the brother said God
[1:23:49] ain't going to overcome for you you've
[1:23:51] got to overcome yourself he gave you the
[1:23:54] ability to overcome he should have
[1:23:56] overcome that serpent but she didn't but
[1:23:59] Mary overcame it
[1:24:03] can you say man why eve took the devil's
[1:24:06] life Mary took God's word and now it's
[1:24:10] presented to us again
[1:24:13] can you say Amen
[1:24:16] that God would send a prophet amen with
[1:24:18] the word amen to help us to ride through
[1:24:21] it
[1:24:22] you can ride through this thing
[1:24:24] I know we got that internet pornography
[1:24:26] is so easy but you can ride through it
[1:24:31] I know this is the age of adultery and
[1:24:33] and and husbands wives you know God they
[1:24:36] they got people on the side and Honey
[1:24:38] Buns on the side but you can ride
[1:24:39] through it
[1:24:41] you understand what I'm saying you can
[1:24:43] be faithful you you you can live holy
[1:24:47] you can live righteous
[1:24:49] you don't have to be they're stuck in
[1:24:51] the muck of this world
[1:24:53] even Peter said we've escaped the
[1:24:55] corruption that is in this world through
[1:24:57] lusts
[1:24:59] see you can ride through this thing
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:06] you believe it
[1:25:11] goes on to say we are to think on things
[1:25:13] that have virtue
[1:25:16] think on things that have praise
[1:25:21] another place that says let God's word
[1:25:23] be true
[1:25:24] and every man alive
[1:25:28] let God's word be true so you build your
[1:25:30] thoughts on God's word
[1:25:33] you build your meditation upon God's
[1:25:35] word
[1:25:38] ain't that right
[1:25:39] sure you're going to have all kinds of
[1:25:41] thoughts that come into your mind but
[1:25:43] why how you receive them
[1:25:47] all right amen come on now
[1:25:51] did not what what did Jesus say a sweet
[1:25:55] water and bitter water can't come from
[1:25:57] the same fountain
[1:26:00] so you you can't have victory
[1:26:03] you we can't have Victory meditating on
[1:26:06] negative thoughts and meditating on on
[1:26:08] the word of God
[1:26:10] meditating on this and meditating on
[1:26:12] that things that are contradicting one
[1:26:15] another
[1:26:18] so we have to we we have to make that
[1:26:20] decision as to what we are I'm a shout
[1:26:24] of God
[1:26:25] then what does that mean to be a child
[1:26:27] of God
[1:26:31] well I go to church
[1:26:34] devil goes to church
[1:26:36] well I believe in the message
[1:26:39] what does the message do for you then
[1:26:43] that's wonderful you believe the message
[1:26:44] can you imagine many people don't have
[1:26:47] the truth
[1:26:51] oh wow
[1:26:53] I thought of that you know where Terry
[1:26:56] just the thinking how blessed I am
[1:27:00] amen I could have been raised in a home
[1:27:03] that all it was was just a television
[1:27:05] going on
[1:27:07] I could have been raised in a home when
[1:27:09] it was just parents playing rock and
[1:27:10] roll music
[1:27:13] these children could be raised in homes
[1:27:16] that all it is is just smoking
[1:27:18] cigarettes
[1:27:20] and they don't know nothing else but
[1:27:25] that's right but here we have the truth
[1:27:28] we literally have truth
[1:27:32] to help us right through this thing
[1:27:37] I hope it's a help to you
[1:27:40] God's word is truth
[1:27:45] and if I can tell you young people
[1:27:50] really take seriousness about your life
[1:27:54] right now
[1:27:55] I know you might be young and
[1:27:58] some of you might be just just coming
[1:28:00] into teenage years I've got a young boy
[1:28:03] I've got a boy coming into teenage years
[1:28:05] and
[1:28:06] ah
[1:28:07] you know I've already raised two boys
[1:28:10] and I understand the things that they
[1:28:13] were going through and now it's it's
[1:28:14] showing here
[1:28:18] and as a dad I had to cry sometimes said
[1:28:21] God is in God
[1:28:24] have mercy
[1:28:30] but you know what I I thought y'all I'm
[1:28:33] so glad that I can come to you
[1:28:36] as a father
[1:28:37] foreign
[1:28:42] I know there's temptations there I know
[1:28:45] it
[1:28:48] but I I steal into him son
[1:28:52] there's a word for you
[1:28:58] there's times that I'll hear him you
[1:29:00] know playing playing the message in a
[1:29:02] room
[1:29:03] it's not that oh God let that word stick
[1:29:08] why would God do it for us I don't know
[1:29:11] it's just his grace
[1:29:14] it's his Mercy
[1:29:16] what if as a father I didn't have no way
[1:29:19] to help him they'll go see a
[1:29:21] psychologist son or well it's just the
[1:29:23] norm these days
[1:29:25] but it don't have to be the norm there's
[1:29:28] a word that helps us ride through these
[1:29:30] things
[1:29:31] and and and it'll help you with you
[1:29:33] teenage years it'll help you in your
[1:29:35] adult Years it'll help you I thought of
[1:29:37] brother Walker there that is just
[1:29:39] suffering with with things and and I
[1:29:41] know the discouragement's there I know
[1:29:43] the Mind battles that he's going through
[1:29:44] but every time I go visit him he's not
[1:29:47] talking about all that he's talking
[1:29:48] about the word of God he's talking about
[1:29:49] the message he's talking about how good
[1:29:51] God is why there's a word that's helping
[1:29:54] him right through this thing
[1:29:57] there's a word that helps
[1:30:01] you can sit there and meditate upon all
[1:30:03] the negatives
[1:30:06] but he chooses to take the word of God
[1:30:08] as the positive
[1:30:10] and it helps him ride through it
[1:30:19] you see God's word is the only positive
[1:30:21] thing that there is
[1:30:24] the only thing that has virtue it's the
[1:30:26] only thing that has a good report you
[1:30:28] believe that
[1:30:29] Psalms 119 97
[1:30:34] little lengthy but it says oh how I love
[1:30:38] thy law
[1:30:39] you love it
[1:30:42] what is his law his word
[1:30:44] that's what he's saying how I Love Thy
[1:30:46] Word
[1:30:48] now that's got to be settled in US
[1:30:52] I love that word we can see the
[1:30:55] importance of the word of God and how
[1:30:57] it's our life it's our it's our refuge
[1:31:00] it's it's everything that we have need
[1:31:02] of
[1:31:03] now notice what he says it is my
[1:31:06] meditation all the day
[1:31:10] through thy Commandments Thy Word
[1:31:14] has thou through thy Commandments
[1:31:18] Thy Thy Word in other words has made me
[1:31:20] wiser than mine enemies
[1:31:25] for they are forever with me
[1:31:29] can you say Amen
[1:31:31] see he's going to teach us how to ride
[1:31:32] through things
[1:31:34] I I have more understanding than all my
[1:31:37] teachers for thy testimonies which is
[1:31:40] his word
[1:31:41] are my meditation
[1:31:44] I understand more than the Ancients
[1:31:46] because I have kept for I keep by
[1:31:50] precepts by word
[1:31:53] I have refrained my feet from every evil
[1:31:56] way that I might keep thy word
[1:32:02] I have not departed from my judgments
[1:32:05] for thou has taught me
[1:32:07] how sweet are thy words under my taste
[1:32:11] yay sweeter than honey to my mouth
[1:32:15] through thy precepts Thy word I get
[1:32:18] understanding therefore I hate every
[1:32:21] false way
[1:32:25] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[1:32:27] light unto my path
[1:32:29] ain't that right
[1:32:31] then you go Psalms 119 11 Thy word
[1:32:35] notice I put Thy word have I hid
[1:32:39] Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:32:42] now I that I might not sin against thee
[1:32:45] so this is the important thing it's not
[1:32:47] God hiding the word
[1:32:49] he hides it
[1:32:51] now I think that's important
[1:32:53] it starts with our thoughts
[1:32:56] and I'm not going to keep you much
[1:32:58] longer
[1:32:59] but it starts with our thoughts
[1:33:01] meditation
[1:33:02] and and and and please keep this
[1:33:05] remember that I'm not addressing a
[1:33:09] people who are unconverted
[1:33:12] I'm not as the world that is trying to
[1:33:15] bring on a millennium without repentance
[1:33:19] I'm not trying to make better people
[1:33:21] without them having a new birth
[1:33:25] this is no way
[1:33:27] in any way trying to bring Reformation
[1:33:34] but the word is for those who are
[1:33:38] predestinated to catch it
[1:33:42] ain't that right
[1:33:45] you remember we've talked about David
[1:33:47] speaking of the man in in the first
[1:33:50] chapter of Psalms where he said you know
[1:33:52] he shall be as a tree planted by the
[1:33:54] rivers of water
[1:33:56] and and brother Brown said see he's
[1:33:58] planted not set out transposed from this
[1:34:01] to that he is predestinated to be there
[1:34:07] right he is predestinated so David is
[1:34:10] showing us that he's predestining he's
[1:34:12] showing what a predestinated man does
[1:34:15] all right Thy word have I hid in my
[1:34:19] heart
[1:34:20] it went from here all the way down into
[1:34:24] the soul
[1:34:28] and you say man if the word stays in
[1:34:30] your intellect Satan can take that word
[1:34:32] out
[1:34:35] is that right
[1:34:37] Betty let that word get down to the soul
[1:34:41] to where Satan couldn't take it out
[1:34:48] brother Brown said he's predestined to
[1:34:50] be there that thought of God before the
[1:34:52] foundation World placed him there
[1:34:54] not stuck out not by chance but was
[1:34:57] planted predestinated ain't that right
[1:35:00] he is predestinated to be there not just
[1:35:04] by chance he noticed he was
[1:35:07] predestinated to catch that word when it
[1:35:11] was sold
[1:35:14] now you might hear it intellectually
[1:35:16] naturally it might be your body that
[1:35:18] your five senses will well we'll catch
[1:35:21] it there then it comes into your spirit
[1:35:23] to where you start reasoning it out and
[1:35:26] if you're not careful Satan will start
[1:35:28] using that you mishear it or you'll
[1:35:31] start reasoning it all right
[1:35:33] and you say amen he comes to you and
[1:35:37] starts working on you and messing that
[1:35:39] word and all that but you've got to let
[1:35:42] it drop down into that soul
[1:35:48] because see if you're predestinated then
[1:35:52] you're predestinated to catch that where
[1:35:56] not intellectually
[1:36:00] but it comes down into the soul
[1:36:03] that's right
[1:36:05] that's that word see God wouldn't have
[1:36:07] said behold a virgin shall conceive if
[1:36:10] there was nobody to catch the word in
[1:36:12] that season
[1:36:15] Prophet said he wouldn't have given the
[1:36:16] last commission to the church if there
[1:36:18] was no one to catch the word
[1:36:21] can you say man
[1:36:23] see he wouldn't have said the works I do
[1:36:25] shall you do even greater see if there
[1:36:28] was nobody to catch that word
[1:36:30] see thank God for the word thank God for
[1:36:33] the promises every one of them are
[1:36:35] positive it says you will overcome it
[1:36:38] says there will be a bride without spot
[1:36:40] wrinkle or bleming that somebody got to
[1:36:42] catch the word
[1:36:45] ain't that right
[1:36:50] and so but he would say that he would
[1:36:53] say these promises he would tell us
[1:36:55] about what belongs to us because he knew
[1:36:58] you would be able to catch it
[1:37:02] you'd catch that word
[1:37:08] predestinated to it so you're not living
[1:37:10] in this age by coincidence
[1:37:13] don't just go through this age don't go
[1:37:15] through life just just hum drum
[1:37:18] act as if well nothing's happening
[1:37:21] and I believe she's just floating by no
[1:37:24] no no no you got to catch the word
[1:37:27] and God knew you would catch the word
[1:37:28] that's why I sent you that's why you're
[1:37:30] here for the message of the hour
[1:37:33] ain't that right
[1:37:35] see he knew you wouldn't be just be
[1:37:36] intellectual with it
[1:37:38] but you would catch it and it would get
[1:37:40] down into that soul and it would
[1:37:42] actually prosper
[1:37:46] ain't that right
[1:37:48] see you're predestinated to be here God
[1:37:51] had a word for this age to be fulfilled
[1:37:54] ain't that right he said there's going
[1:37:56] to be a rapture we are in that Rapture
[1:37:58] age well how's there going to be
[1:37:59] arriving you know how there's going to
[1:38:01] be a Rapture in this age because there's
[1:38:02] somebody to catch that word
[1:38:06] true
[1:38:07] Paul talked about the manifestation of
[1:38:09] the sons of God do you know why he would
[1:38:10] do that because somebody would catch the
[1:38:12] word in the season
[1:38:14] and this is the season
[1:38:21] Now by being predestinated to catch the
[1:38:24] word then you have the ability to
[1:38:25] discern what is of God and what is of
[1:38:28] the devil
[1:38:29] now brother random says you hear so much
[1:38:31] today about positive thinking you just
[1:38:34] put your mind on anything and think
[1:38:36] positive on it
[1:38:38] the devil can do that so we're not we're
[1:38:41] not talking about positive thinking as
[1:38:43] the world would
[1:38:45] he said the devil can do that there's
[1:38:47] only one thing that rules overall and
[1:38:50] that's God's word
[1:38:52] ain't that right and if you're thinking
[1:38:54] contrary to the word forget your
[1:38:56] thinking think on the word
[1:38:59] ain't that right when the five senses of
[1:39:01] your body starts going contrary to the
[1:39:03] word forget it
[1:39:04] stay with the word when the five senses
[1:39:07] of your spirit your reasoning your
[1:39:08] affection your conscience your memory
[1:39:10] and all that starts to stray and amen
[1:39:12] from the word of God bring it back into
[1:39:14] subjection
[1:39:18] is that right
[1:39:19] so now positive thinking is taught to
[1:39:22] all kinds of people
[1:39:26] because it bypasses the supernatural
[1:39:29] birth
[1:39:31] amen it's a human effort to make Man
[1:39:34] Superior without the word of God
[1:39:39] and psychology is the same thing it
[1:39:42] bypasses the supernatural it deals with
[1:39:45] the human mind
[1:39:46] but when it comes to the word and
[1:39:48] understanding it and receiving it well
[1:39:51] you know they cannot do that they only
[1:39:54] get an intellectual conception of the
[1:39:57] word
[1:40:00] right
[1:40:02] Jesus Judas had a mental conception of
[1:40:06] what Jesus was saying and who Jesus was
[1:40:09] but that's as far as it went
[1:40:11] he couldn't understand the ministry of
[1:40:13] Jesus couldn't understand what he was
[1:40:14] all about couldn't understand anything
[1:40:16] and and Jesus was the word ain't that
[1:40:18] right he couldn't catch that word
[1:40:25] did you even go back into Cain he had
[1:40:27] intellectual conception of God
[1:40:30] that he couldn't catch the word
[1:40:33] ain't that right so Judas intellectually
[1:40:35] he heard what the other disciples were
[1:40:37] hearing he saw what the other disciples
[1:40:39] were seeing and he believed it in his
[1:40:42] mind but in his heart he didn't believe
[1:40:45] it
[1:40:48] yeah you're just gonna believe it in
[1:40:51] your mind you better be careful because
[1:40:52] Satan will mess with your mind
[1:40:57] the word cannot remain cannot be planted
[1:40:59] in you just in your mind
[1:41:01] it's got to drop
[1:41:04] ain't that right I hope it's all right
[1:41:06] but
[1:41:08] so he couldn't catch the meaning of what
[1:41:09] it was all about but notice what the
[1:41:11] prophet said but the real ordained of
[1:41:14] God that real Gene that real germ a soul
[1:41:18] of God that was in God before the
[1:41:20] foundation of the world remember you
[1:41:22] that's really got the spirit of God in
[1:41:24] you tonight you were here in Christ
[1:41:26] because he was the fullness of the word
[1:41:28] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:41:30] bodily God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:41:33] world to himself he said do you believe
[1:41:35] that look he was in Christ then if you
[1:41:38] were in God a gene a word an attribute
[1:41:42] from the beginning then you walk with
[1:41:44] him here on Earth you talked with him on
[1:41:46] Earth you suffered with him on Earth you
[1:41:49] died with him at Calvary you Rose with
[1:41:51] him again and now you're sitting in
[1:41:53] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:41:54] communing with him the word as it feeds
[1:41:58] into your soul
[1:42:03] that man shall live by every word that
[1:42:08] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:42:11] ain't that right
[1:42:13] as we try to close it's the soul is that
[1:42:15] counts
[1:42:17] that's so that you have is either a gene
[1:42:20] seed or it's not
[1:42:22] is either before the foundation of the
[1:42:24] world or it's not and we know what the
[1:42:27] soul controls the spirit the spirit
[1:42:29] controls the body but the soul is where
[1:42:31] the domain the soul is where the domain
[1:42:34] is
[1:42:35] ain't that right you believe that not
[1:42:38] your body not your spirit your soul is
[1:42:40] where the domain
[1:42:42] that's right see and so whatever is in
[1:42:45] the soul would determine what you do
[1:42:47] with the thoughts that come in your mind
[1:42:52] amen
[1:42:54] again we talk of the five senses of the
[1:42:56] body taste feel hear smell
[1:42:59] and seed and there's the five the spirit
[1:43:02] has the five gates of memory affection
[1:43:05] reasoning conscience and Imagination and
[1:43:08] what is a gate it's an entrance
[1:43:11] it's it's an entrance to something I
[1:43:13] looked at it Webster says it is a door a
[1:43:15] valve or other device for controlling
[1:43:18] the passage
[1:43:20] right so the body has five entrances the
[1:43:24] spirit has five entrances see but when
[1:43:27] it comes to the soul the prophet said
[1:43:29] there's only one Avenue to it and that's
[1:43:32] free moral agency you can accept doubt
[1:43:35] or you can accept Faith either one you
[1:43:38] want to work on see therefore Satan
[1:43:41] began at the principal part to cause the
[1:43:43] spirit of man to doubt God's word god
[1:43:45] began at the principal part to lay his
[1:43:48] word into that Spirit ain't that right
[1:43:50] so there you are that's what does it now
[1:43:52] you we we all know in 1953 is what when
[1:43:56] he said that and and brother Branham
[1:43:58] taught that we were Body Soul in spirit
[1:44:00] and but later on in his ministry he
[1:44:03] corrects it and says we are Body Spirit
[1:44:04] and soul ain't that right and so so so
[1:44:09] what you see what you taste hear smell
[1:44:12] uh whatever these five senses of the
[1:44:15] body actually is a gate it it it it it
[1:44:18] it can affect a man the the inner man
[1:44:21] your spirit man because it what what you
[1:44:24] see amen then it comes into your memory
[1:44:27] or it comes into what you hear then it
[1:44:31] becomes into you can re then you start
[1:44:33] reasoning out in your spirit ain't that
[1:44:35] right that now now and if I can get this
[1:44:39] uh uh to you clearly amen see uh uh but
[1:44:44] in order for it to get down into your
[1:44:46] soul you have to receive it
[1:44:52] come on now how many people saw they
[1:44:55] they saw the the the the supernatural
[1:44:57] Saul why did not they why didn't they
[1:45:00] believe it
[1:45:01] they saw it
[1:45:03] there's people that testified that saw
[1:45:05] that Pillar of Fire
[1:45:07] it's all the angel
[1:45:09] yet they didn't they didn't accept it
[1:45:11] because they saw it and time it got to
[1:45:14] into their Spirit they began to reason
[1:45:16] it
[1:45:17] reasoning
[1:45:19] and they explained allowed the devil to
[1:45:21] explain it away
[1:45:25] hello
[1:45:27] and they never received it see so you're
[1:45:30] a free moral agent and and there's again
[1:45:31] there's only one gate to the soul and
[1:45:33] that's either Faith or doubt and brother
[1:45:35] Brown said it all depends as to what
[1:45:38] kind of nature the soul is
[1:45:43] so you're either going to believe it or
[1:45:44] you'll reject it
[1:45:46] ain't that right
[1:45:48] and so what you are in your soul is what
[1:45:52] counts yeah
[1:45:54] you you can be affected in this body by
[1:45:56] by the five by the five senses
[1:45:59] you you can be affected a man in the in
[1:46:02] the in by the five senses of the spirit
[1:46:04] and Satan can control all all of them
[1:46:08] Satan has his way with them all
[1:46:11] but then you have the power
[1:46:17] to reject it
[1:46:19] or to accept it
[1:46:22] you have the power to cast it down
[1:46:26] or to meditate on it
[1:46:33] you love the Lord
[1:46:36] Amen brother Branham says the devil can
[1:46:38] get into these five senses and lie to
[1:46:39] you
[1:46:41] he said but he cannot touch that super
[1:46:44] sense which is faith
[1:46:45] it's far beyond his reach
[1:46:49] for it came from God
[1:46:51] that's why your physical being you could
[1:46:55] you could be blind deaf dumb whatever or
[1:46:58] or whatever you could be affected uh by
[1:47:01] diseases or whatever and then Satan can
[1:47:04] come into that reasoning and say look
[1:47:05] how long you've been sick God doesn't
[1:47:07] love you God doesn't heal God doesn't
[1:47:09] this and God doesn't that if God loved
[1:47:12] you you wouldn't be the Way You Are
[1:47:15] right
[1:47:18] well you must have done something wrong
[1:47:19] or you you must not have faith right
[1:47:24] what is it you're feeling the symptoms
[1:47:26] and Satan's working on it
[1:47:32] but if you're a Believer you disregard
[1:47:34] all of that
[1:47:36] and you count every symptom as a lie
[1:47:40] just as Mary did you can be as an eve
[1:47:43] that accepts the LIE
[1:47:46] or you can be as a Mary
[1:47:49] but there's a people that's a Mary in
[1:47:51] this age
[1:47:53] and God did not promise us a Bed of
[1:47:55] Roses he did not promise us a life of
[1:47:57] ease
[1:47:59] ain't that right you're going to go
[1:48:01] through your hell you're going to go
[1:48:03] through your pain you're going to go
[1:48:04] through whatever
[1:48:06] but it proven that you're a son of God
[1:48:12] oh I I love him
[1:48:14] now brother Brown said see the five
[1:48:16] senses does not control the sixth sense
[1:48:19] but the Sixth Sense controls the five
[1:48:20] senses
[1:48:21] the super sense controls the natural
[1:48:23] senses the five senses the states feel
[1:48:25] he'll uh hear smell and uh uh see he
[1:48:29] says see the the super sense is
[1:48:31] something that'll make you believe God's
[1:48:33] word but where's the Super sense down in
[1:48:36] the soul
[1:48:37] it'll make you believe God's word
[1:48:38] whether you see it or not it'll make you
[1:48:40] believe it
[1:48:42] ain't that right you might have every
[1:48:44] reason to reason it away but that Sixth
[1:48:47] Sense down in that soul will make you
[1:48:49] believe it regardless
[1:48:52] it'll make you believe for things that
[1:48:54] you cannot see taste feel smell or hear
[1:48:57] because it'll take God's word and it
[1:48:59] will deliver that word to you and make
[1:49:02] you walk contrary to any other thing
[1:49:04] there is but God's word by faith faith
[1:49:07] does it can you say Amen
[1:49:09] oh do you love him isn't he wonderful
[1:49:14] so here Eve heard the word of God and
[1:49:17] she said okay that sounds good
[1:49:18] intellectually she heard it
[1:49:20] but that's as far as it went
[1:49:23] then Satan began to take that word and
[1:49:24] begin to reason with her
[1:49:26] work on that reasoning
[1:49:28] reason and see and she listened to it
[1:49:30] against God's word
[1:49:32] and by that she accepted Satan's lie
[1:49:34] over God's word
[1:49:36] ain't that right
[1:49:39] and you would think you you you would
[1:49:41] think that everyone that sees the
[1:49:43] supernatural would believe it
[1:49:47] but that's not the case
[1:49:49] God sends preachers to preach his word
[1:49:51] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:49:52] the word
[1:49:53] God performs the supernatural so that
[1:49:55] men can see it with their own eyes
[1:49:58] right
[1:49:59] then it enters into the five one of the
[1:50:02] five gates of the of the spirit if we
[1:50:04] can say it that way but it never gets
[1:50:06] into the soul
[1:50:07] as we get ready to close now brother
[1:50:09] Brown said you got five senses that
[1:50:11] controls the body you got five senses
[1:50:13] that controls uh of the spirit
[1:50:15] conscience and so forth he said your
[1:50:18] body there's a seed taste feel smell in
[1:50:20] here but there's only one channel to the
[1:50:24] inside of that soul
[1:50:25] to show uh that shows that you are a
[1:50:29] seed
[1:50:30] your soul body experiency and then one
[1:50:33] channel Avenue one way into that your
[1:50:36] free moral agency that is you can
[1:50:38] receive it or reject it you do whatever
[1:50:41] you want to
[1:50:42] therefore Eve was on the same basis she
[1:50:45] could take God's word and and said God
[1:50:47] said not to do it get away from here and
[1:50:50] that would have been all right
[1:50:51] but instead of that she tried to hybrid
[1:50:54] it with Satan's lie and it brought death
[1:50:56] but when it come to Mary it was
[1:50:59] different behold the hands maiden of the
[1:51:01] Lord how's it going to be that doesn't
[1:51:03] matter it's going to be anyhow
[1:51:06] you have spoke it it's the word of God I
[1:51:09] receive it behold the hands made of the
[1:51:10] Lord be it unto me even as thy word see
[1:51:13] there it was that settled it she was all
[1:51:15] right then she brought forth that germ
[1:51:18] of Life which was the word of God made
[1:51:20] manifest in a form of a man
[1:51:22] and through death of that one just paid
[1:51:25] death the death and the debt for every
[1:51:27] one of us that's unjust and by accepting
[1:51:30] then his word brings life and brings
[1:51:34] Christ back in us because Christ is the
[1:51:36] word the spoken word and it will mature
[1:51:39] if you can receive it you that sick
[1:51:42] accept it believe it no matter what it's
[1:51:44] got to mature and we'll come forth in
[1:51:47] its season it's got to
[1:51:49] oh do you love him
[1:51:51] oh praise the Lord that the musicians
[1:51:53] will come
[1:51:54] I pray he had some sin made some sense
[1:51:56] to you today
[1:51:58] I am going to read this here because it
[1:52:01] did not stay in Mary's intellect but it
[1:52:04] went into the soul
[1:52:06] she heard it but didn't walk away and
[1:52:08] allowed Satan take it from her
[1:52:11] she received it down inside she was
[1:52:14] predestinated to catch that word
[1:52:18] and she meditated her meditation was
[1:52:20] upon the word her confession was the
[1:52:22] word right
[1:52:24] there's other people that probably said
[1:52:26] well how can that be even Joseph even
[1:52:28] questioned it there but yet she wouldn't
[1:52:30] listen to it
[1:52:32] right
[1:52:34] now
[1:52:36] brother Branham says this and I want you
[1:52:38] to listen now
[1:52:39] he said now this outside man is the
[1:52:41] Flesh and that's what we look at what we
[1:52:43] see
[1:52:44] and it has five inlets to that body
[1:52:47] any grammar school child as myself would
[1:52:50] know there is five senses that control
[1:52:52] the body see taste feel hear smell
[1:52:56] and so he says without that without them
[1:52:59] senses you can't touch the body
[1:53:01] that's the only way you have uh that's
[1:53:04] the only way you have to the body see
[1:53:06] taste feel smell here you see it taste
[1:53:09] it feel it and that is the evil one on
[1:53:12] the outside
[1:53:14] now inside of that is a spirit which you
[1:53:17] become when you're born in the Earth
[1:53:19] and the Breath of Life is breathing to
[1:53:21] him that spirit is of a worldly nature
[1:53:24] because it was not given from God but it
[1:53:27] was permitted by God now you got that
[1:53:30] every child that's born in the world is
[1:53:32] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:53:34] the world speaking lies
[1:53:36] that right so that person inside there
[1:53:39] is a sinner to begin with it's got five
[1:53:42] inlets see I don't know whether he said
[1:53:45] I can count them off but he said
[1:53:46] conscience and reasoning and things he
[1:53:49] said there's five inlets to the spirit
[1:53:51] you can't think with your body you have
[1:53:53] to think with your spirit you can't have
[1:53:55] conscience in your body it has no mental
[1:53:58] factualities at all your body doesn't so
[1:54:01] you have to think with your spirit see
[1:54:03] you have to reason you can't reason with
[1:54:06] your physical being because reason don't
[1:54:08] see taste feel smell or hear reason is
[1:54:11] what you can make in your mind if you're
[1:54:14] asleep or or you're out your body is
[1:54:18] lying there dead but your spirits can
[1:54:21] steal reasons see so there's five senses
[1:54:23] that control that Inside Man now to the
[1:54:27] last man which is the soul there is only
[1:54:30] one sense that controls that and that is
[1:54:32] free moral agency free will to choose or
[1:54:35] to reject now now the reason that people
[1:54:37] is don't forget this you'll see he says
[1:54:40] now people can live in the spirit they
[1:54:43] can dance in the spirit shout in the
[1:54:45] spirit go to church in the spirit and
[1:54:46] they can absolutely have the real spirit
[1:54:49] of God anointed on that Spirit but still
[1:54:52] be lost and just as devil possessed as
[1:54:54] they can be with that spirit because
[1:54:57] watch that's the reason you couldn't
[1:54:59] tell that woman wearing shorts was wrong
[1:55:01] you couldn't tell her bobbing her hair
[1:55:04] was wrong well what what's your hair Got
[1:55:06] to Do With It see she's starting to
[1:55:08] reason with that well uh he did the
[1:55:11] Samson see well whosoever shall add one
[1:55:13] word to this or take one word from it
[1:55:15] you've got to have an ultimate somewhere
[1:55:18] for instances if I was a Baptist man you
[1:55:21] come down and told me I must be baptized
[1:55:23] in Jesus name it's in the Bible well the
[1:55:26] first thing you'd know I'd say I'll ask
[1:55:28] my pastor I go to the pastor he says oh
[1:55:31] that's something back Yonder yeah we
[1:55:33] Baptist here's what we believe we
[1:55:35] believe that we should be in immersed in
[1:55:37] titles Father Son and Holy Ghost that's
[1:55:38] all the way the church has done it see
[1:55:40] since John Smith found it and that's the
[1:55:42] way it's done well see that's your
[1:55:45] ultimate heck with that guy you know
[1:55:48] with what that guy says see well it what
[1:55:51] if you're a Methodist and sprinkling is
[1:55:53] your system and and you are told that
[1:55:56] you must be immersed see what I mean you
[1:55:58] go back to the Methodist Pastor he'll
[1:56:00] write and ask the bishop and it's sold
[1:56:03] and so and so and so said about this see
[1:56:05] well but we the Methodist Church we was
[1:56:07] founded three or four hundred years ago
[1:56:09] in England by John Wesleyan Whitfield
[1:56:11] and Dad see we founded this document
[1:56:14] following John Wesley that we are to be
[1:56:16] sprinkled and see because it's just an
[1:56:20] outward in form emotion form and we
[1:56:23] think sprinkling is just as good as it
[1:56:25] is any other way if you're It is Well if
[1:56:28] the Methodist Church is your automation
[1:56:30] that's as far as it you can go see the
[1:56:33] word stops right he said if you're
[1:56:36] Catholic same thing not you know it's in
[1:56:39] the you know I'll tell you it's not in
[1:56:42] the Bible not to eat meat on Fridays and
[1:56:44] all those things like this that Holy
[1:56:46] Eucharist isn't a wafer because it's a
[1:56:48] spirit and so forth you go to your
[1:56:51] priest the priest says here it is room
[1:56:53] right in our documents see well if the
[1:56:55] church is your ultimate you don't give a
[1:56:57] hoot what anybody says that's your
[1:56:59] ultimate oh God he's says help this to
[1:57:03] sink into me the whole thing is wrong
[1:57:05] God's word is the ultimate whatever that
[1:57:08] word says then that's right and now the
[1:57:12] only way up here in the Spheres that you
[1:57:15] could ever be in this little Inside Man
[1:57:17] you have to be predestined for ordained
[1:57:20] because you was with God you were a part
[1:57:22] of God can you say amen that's right see
[1:57:26] so we find he says he never came to save
[1:57:30] the devil's children they will never
[1:57:32] know it they are so shrewd in their ways
[1:57:34] of their intellectual learning that you
[1:57:36] cannot compare with them at all you
[1:57:39] cannot out talk to them at all but by
[1:57:42] faith you see it
[1:57:44] can't explain it but the word is able to
[1:57:47] get past your your five senses of the
[1:57:49] body your five sins of the spirit and it
[1:57:52] drops down into the soul and the faith
[1:57:55] controls your body it controls your
[1:57:58] spirit it whatever is in that Soul
[1:58:00] controls can you say man
[1:58:02] I am the Lord wonderful
[1:58:04] [Music]
[1:58:07] brother Ram talks about in Africa he
[1:58:09] says I go in Africa and one they see one
[1:58:11] Miracle one Supernatural sign and the
[1:58:14] people flock thousands he said but it
[1:58:17] doesn't work in America
[1:58:19] he said I come to American
[1:58:23] he said man he says or he talks about
[1:58:25] Africa he says you know he says tell
[1:58:26] person what was wrong or something like
[1:58:28] that every person would do just exactly
[1:58:29] what you told them to do and if they
[1:58:31] were laying Twisted bound up they'd be
[1:58:33] wiggling and trying their best to get
[1:58:36] off that cough they do they they'd keep
[1:58:39] doing it until they could get up and do
[1:58:41] it no defeat with them there they said
[1:58:43] America it never works he said because
[1:58:45] there's so much teaching in America so
[1:58:47] much different teachings until everyone
[1:58:49] has their own idea and they say well my
[1:58:52] pastor said that that man was a
[1:58:54] spiritualist well then that settles it
[1:58:55] with you see the word could never come
[1:58:57] into their soul
[1:58:58] and have an effect
[1:59:00] and oh you say well I don't believe that
[1:59:02] now brother Branham he spent way down in
[1:59:04] that subconscious it's still there you
[1:59:07] usually move by your subconscience
[1:59:09] and you say amen and that's where we got
[1:59:12] to get that t that that that
[1:59:13] subconscious got to be clean to where
[1:59:15] God can move in that subconscious
[1:59:18] that's right and he and he goes on down
[1:59:20] I'll get down to it later but he says
[1:59:22] see you can say oh I believe it I
[1:59:24] believe it yes sir I believe it but down
[1:59:26] then in that subconscious if there's a
[1:59:29] doctrine that you've been taught that is
[1:59:31] against that
[1:59:33] it throws that out
[1:59:36] because you hold on to that Doctrine you
[1:59:38] hold to that teaching and that's why so
[1:59:41] many people called what God done this
[1:59:43] day of the devil they called it BLS
[1:59:46] above because their Pastor taught them
[1:59:47] that because the pope taught him that
[1:59:49] because some bishop or the church taught
[1:59:52] that well the days of Miracles and as
[1:59:54] I've told you I've talked to that one
[1:59:55] gentleman that that told me that March
[1:59:58] 16 was not inspired and that God does
[2:00:00] not do Miracles today amen and I tried
[2:00:03] to tell that man I showed him I told him
[2:00:05] my daughter I said look I said this is
[2:00:07] my daughter Anne and and I said she was
[2:00:09] born I got proof that that she didn't
[2:00:12] have a hip socket in in when she was
[2:00:15] born and and and God created a hip
[2:00:18] socket just uh days later and and I got
[2:00:22] the proof of that and and and wouldn't
[2:00:24] believe it why because the church became
[2:00:27] his absolute
[2:00:28] but I'm so glad we've come out of her my
[2:00:31] people
[2:00:32] we've come out so that the word can have
[2:00:34] an effect
[2:00:35] I hope it's helped you God bless you is
