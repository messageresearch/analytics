[24:54] I anybody know where that song really
[24:56] originated from
[24:58] who first came out with that huh just a
[25:01] little bit of trivia here
[25:07] yeah
[25:09] well I know that back in the early 70s
[25:12] the Philip uh or Simon Cameron family
[25:15] from Scotland actually was going around
[25:18] singing that
[25:20] and I don't know if any that goes back
[25:22] probably too far for
[25:24] mostly here but I remember them going
[25:27] around they were all over the United
[25:28] States singing and that was one of their
[25:30] songs
[25:31] praise the Lord amen
[25:35] he was associated with the Simon Cameron
[25:38] family Roy Turner that's right all right
[25:41] praise the Lord uh Sister Kim

[25:47] but you would you happen to have a song
[25:49] for us tonight
[25:51] amen
[25:53] praise the Lord
[26:13] first time I heard that song brother
[26:15] Terry I was about 20 years old and
[26:18] brother Stephen Shelley sung it at a
[26:21] camp meeting but he wasn't those words I
[26:24] like those words really those are
[26:26] awesome
[26:36] forgive me my mind went blank
[26:40] here I got it
[26:41] I got it my Physicians tried in vain
[26:46] through 12 long years of pain
[26:50] it is proof that there is nothing they
[26:55] can do
[26:58] but I heard somebody say
[27:03] there's a Healer all the way
[27:08] somehow I've got to press my way through
[27:14] I gotta get
[27:18] Jesus
[27:19] gotta get to Jesus
[27:24] oh he's the only answer
[27:29] to money
[27:31] [Music]
[27:37] he can something
[27:40] in the broken pieces
[27:44] gotta get to Jesus
[27:53] now when my world is
[27:57] [Music]
[28:03] I don't know just how much I can take
[28:09] [Music]
[28:12] trapped inside a cloud
[28:15] of disbelief and doubt I only know one
[28:23] way of Escape
[28:27] I gotta get back to Jesus
[28:32] gotta get to Jesus
[28:44] [Music]
[28:48] [Applause]

[29:06] gotta get to Jesus
[29:31] all these broken pieces
[29:39] to Jesus
[29:42] [Music]
[29:48] gotta get to Jesus amen I enjoyed that
[29:51] song
[29:52] amen you know I think it's one of the
[29:54] saddest things I know of is when you
[29:56] hear of somebody that felt like they ran
[29:59] out of Hope or they didn't have
[30:01] stand a chance for something and it
[30:03] didn't turn to the Lord and Lord could
[30:05] he's a problem solver he's a Waymaker
[30:08] he's uh he can certainly take an
[30:11] impossible circumstance that looks like
[30:14] I mean it's there's so many uh things
[30:17] confusion in it and he could bring peace
[30:21] he can bring Clarity uh to a complicated
[30:24] situation there's no problem that God
[30:27] can't solve
[30:28] I I was one of them so I don't know
[30:32] about you but I certainly was one of
[30:34] them and God solved me amen aren't you

[34:13] number seven sabbaths of years unto thee
[34:15] and seven times seven years and the
[34:17] space of the seven sabbaths of years

[36:21] the season the seasons that is the
[36:24] season for adoption
[36:31] to everything to everything to
[36:33] everything to everything there's a
[36:34] season in a time and every purpose under
[36:37] the Heaven There is a time to be born a
[36:39] time to die a time to plant a time to
[36:41] pluck up that that that that that which
[36:45] is it is it is is planted A Time to Kill
[36:48] a time to heal time to break down and a
[36:50] time to build up a time to weep and time
[36:52] to laugh and time to mourn and time to

[37:19] and a time of peace
[37:21] so so so so so we notice now that um
[37:25] that God has seasons and he has times
[37:27] for everything for for everything that
[37:30] there is
[37:31] when it comes to to anything and
[37:34] everything God has his perfect time in
[37:36] perfect seasons for for for uh for when
[37:39] he wants things to happen you you uh if
[37:42] you notice now that Moses's message
[37:44] message wouldn't have worked wouldn't
[37:45] have worked for Noah's age and Noah's
[37:47] message wouldn't have worked for for for
[37:50] for Moses's Age and and neither and
[37:52] either would would have any other
[37:54] prophets prophets walked through most of
[37:56] the time and Moses's message message
[37:59] wouldn't have have worked for um for um
[38:02] for for any of the of of of the other of
[38:06] the other prophet's time it came it came
[38:09] in the season and the time that that
[38:11] that that God that God that God had
[38:13] intended
[38:14] Moses Moses Moses Moses couldn't have
[38:17] jumped jumped couldn't have couldn't
[38:20] have couldn't have built built an ark
[38:22] and and floated down the Nile and and
[38:24] say and say and say climb on in it's
[38:27] it's how we're leaving here it it it it
[38:29] it wouldn't have worked God had his time
[38:30] in his season for for exactly for
[38:33] exactly what what he planned
[38:41] said and with the age that that that we
[38:45] that that in the age that we're living
[38:46] in when that word when that word is
[38:49] interpreted God's speaking God speaking
[38:51] that that word out and making the
[38:52] Wardrobe the words for that age live
[38:54] giving the interpretation of it that is
[38:57] God in Christ manifesting see because
[38:59] Christ is the word and when the word is
[39:01] made manifest that is Christ in every
[39:04] age then so so so so now so now if if we
[39:09] if we step back and and look at at Moses
[39:13] at Moses for just a little bit we
[39:16] we know that that Moses that Moses
[39:18] intellectually he he knew that that that
[39:21] he was supposed to that he was supposed
[39:23] to to to to to deliver the the the the
[39:26] the children of Israel he he knew his
[39:29] mind that that's exactly what God had
[39:30] called him to do but but but but but but
[39:33] but but but we know now that that just
[39:37] because you have a call of God it it it
[39:39] it it it doesn't it doesn't necessarily
[39:41] mean that mean that you're supposed to
[39:42] just just just jump out there and do it
[39:44] you have to wait on God's timing and in
[39:46] God's Will and and and and and and and
[39:49] and and and Moses and Moses and Moses
[39:51] probably thought that that well that
[39:54] that that that well the children of
[39:55] Israel of Israel no no no that I'm
[39:58] supposed to be there to deliver and and
[40:00] and and and he jumps out there and he
[40:03] kills a man and and and and and and we
[40:06] find out that the children of Israel
[40:08] they did not that that that they did not
[40:13] understanding what it ended up doing was
[40:15] driving Moses Moses that drove Moses out
[40:18] out of the land of Egypt and he's so
[40:21] drunk and his sojourned in in the desert
[40:25] for 40 years why and but and and and and
[40:28] and and and brother Brown had actually
[40:31] said said that Moses had lost all hopes
[40:34] and Andy and he had and he lost he had
[40:36] lost all and he had he he had all lost
[40:39] all his hopes and all the power that he
[40:41] had had had because he was thinking that
[40:45] freedom was not for the children of
[40:47] Israel he had lost all thoughts of
[40:49] Freedom until God had met him one day in
[40:51] a burning bush
[40:54] and and and and and and and then we know
[40:57] that that that that that and God that
[40:58] when God sees and can't came along just
[41:00] exactly right right right right right
[41:02] right and then at that point he began he
[41:04] began to reveal his plans on the Moses
[41:06] he he began to show him signs and
[41:09] wonders that that that that that that
[41:10] that Moses that Moses was to do and
[41:12] before you know it and and
[41:16] before you know it know what that in
[41:18] that five minutes it with that burning
[41:20] bush had had done more for him than all
[41:22] the 40 years of schooling and with with
[41:24] the Egyptians why because because he he
[41:27] became from a head knowledge to a direct
[41:29] revelation of what of what he was
[41:31] supposed to do in in his time in his
[41:34] season and and he realized then that
[41:37] then then that God had called him for
[41:39] that and he realized that it was this it
[41:41] was the season for it now now now now
[41:43] now now now now here he comes he he'd
[41:47] become out he did the end there he went
[41:48] well went marched back across the desert
[41:50] as an 80 as in as an as an 80 as an 80
[41:53] year old man man man
[41:57] with the stick in his hand because
[41:59] because because because he had realized
[42:02] he had caught the Revelation that it was
[42:04] now God's time in in God's season to do
[42:06] to to to do it so we know that we know
[42:09] that God has a time for all things he's
[42:11] got a he has a time that that will be
[42:13] plant corn he has a time that we plow it
[42:15] and he has the time that we I'll be
[42:16] harvested the uh um spring rains come
[42:20] and and then the droughts come and then
[42:22] and then the droughts come in the
[42:24] summertime and then the fall rains and
[42:26] then the Snows and and and and and we
[42:28] assume we noticed that that with with
[42:30] these times and Seasons we have we have
[42:32] we have this we have a planting season
[42:34] we have a we have a harvest season we
[42:36] have we we we we we have all these times
[42:39] and seasons for it and if you go against
[42:41] the seasons that God had God has placed
[42:43] there it'll never work the the the the
[42:46] Apaches used to um you used to go and
[42:49] plant corn and they had they had what
[42:51] they called to call it a harvest drain
[42:53] or I'm sorry a planting rain and they
[42:55] would never they would never ever
[42:56] Harvest our or I'm sorry plant corn on
[42:58] or or or the crops or whatever it was
[43:01] until until the until what they had
[43:03] what's called a planting land and it was
[43:05] usually it was usually about the start
[43:07] of the start of the monsoon season and
[43:09] and and and and and so we noticed now
[43:11] that that that that that that that all
[43:13] that that that that that every farmer or
[43:15] anybody knows anything in those anything
[43:18] about that kind of stuff knows that you
[43:20] can't just just go and plant it and
[43:21] plant it and plan it yesterday and and
[43:24] tomorrow and tomorrow go go in and and
[43:27] and pick it you have to wait for God's
[43:29] time and and the season
[43:31] brother Brown said
[43:33] he said that God has times for the
[43:35] seasons he has seasons for his word he
[43:37] has times when he'll win where in the
[43:40] scriptures where it said the presence of
[43:42] the Lord was there to heal the sick he
[43:44] said and that's when Jesus was was was
[43:46] was ministering too and and at the
[43:49] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[43:50] the sick he said and maybe and maybe at
[43:52] at at other times the presence of the
[43:55] Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and
[43:57] we find out that God works everything
[43:58] seasonally and and now when Moses when
[44:01] he
[44:02] he both of them said when Moses what he
[44:06] failed to do was find was find the
[44:07] timeline of God and so so so so so so so
[44:11] we find out that when God revealed him
[44:13] that when God revealed him him him him
[44:16] in the burning bush we we we we we we we
[44:19] we we we we we we we we we can find out
[44:21] now that that the very thing that he was
[44:22] lacking he found he that he found out
[44:25] what he was lacking was it was in that
[44:27] burning bush
[44:32] what we need
[44:35] today as as as as as as as as
[44:39] Christians when when when we know what
[44:42] God has called us to do when we know
[44:43] that that we are the bride of Christ
[44:45] when when when we know when when when
[44:48] when when when when we know that God has
[44:51] called us to overcome all all the
[44:54] enemies what we need what we what we
[44:56] need to do now is go and have a burning
[44:58] bush experience what we need to do is in
[45:00] the backside you could go on the
[45:02] backside of that desert and we stay
[45:04] there until we know that we know that we
[45:06] know that God has called us to these
[45:07] things and there's nothing any more that
[45:09] could ever stress from it why because we
[45:12] have got a direct revelation of the will
[45:15] of God in our lives it's not enough it's
[45:19] it it's it's it's not enough just to
[45:21] hear the tapes and and hear the promises
[45:23] of God it's not enough just to just to
[45:25] sit there and not head at it and say
[45:26] well yes well yes I absolutely believe
[45:28] that but what we have to do is we have
[45:30] to we is we have to go out on that back
[45:32] side this side of the desert and we have
[45:34] to have that have we have to have that
[45:36] that that that burning bush of bush
[45:38] experience where we know that we know
[45:40] that we know that God has has has has
[45:44] has has has
[45:46] well God has called us through it we
[45:48] have to have a revelation of what God
[45:50] has called us to have what God has
[45:51] called us for
[45:53] um um so so so so so so so we find out
[45:56] now now that now now that that that that
[45:59] once Moses what Moses that that Moses
[46:02] when he when he finally when he finally
[46:05] got the got the direct will of God and
[46:07] the direct time of God and it became a
[46:10] revelation to it to him to him to him
[46:13] now now we see him as an 80 year old man
[46:18] with his wife and his kids and was
[46:20] marching him and he went marching
[46:22] marching uh back back across that desert
[46:25] as a one-man Invasion why because
[46:27] because the time the time had come for
[46:32] for deliverance it was now the season
[46:34] and the time for it so we and so Moses
[46:38] Moses Moses Moses no longer no longer no
[46:42] longer had a head knowledge he he
[46:44] he no longer had a had a had a hope so
[46:47] or just an intellectual knowledge of it
[46:49] it became our direct Revelation that
[46:52] that right now it was time it was time
[46:55] for the for for the Deliverance of of of
[46:58] of Israel and well and he only got that
[47:02] when he came in contact with the pillar
[47:04] of fire so so so so so so so so so so so
[47:07] so so so God so so God so God has has a
[47:10] set time it's a season it's a season for
[47:12] it to happen so what but but
[47:15] notice now that God hasn't set time for
[47:18] everything we we go that we see that God
[47:20] had has to set time for for for for for
[47:23] Christ for Christ to come on the earth
[47:27] and when he came it wasn't a day early
[47:30] it wasn't a daylight it was right on
[47:32] time according to God's Will and God's
[47:34] plan
[47:35] it could not have come a day later it
[47:37] couldn't have come earlier it couldn't
[47:38] have come a month later or a month or a
[47:41] month earlier and maybe the doctors were
[47:43] telling Mary that your due date is on
[47:45] such and such a day but really it came
[47:47] it came on this day why because because
[47:50] because as good as those doctors were
[47:52] that they might that they might have
[47:53] that that they might have tried try to
[47:56] tried to guess the due date just exactly
[47:58] right
[47:59] um God had his exact timing for when
[48:02] Christ was was to come on on on on Earth
[48:06] brother Brown said said um said uh um um
[48:10] um like like the heat of the sun uh like
[48:13] like like the like the heat of the sun
[48:15] to open up when it's so when it when it
[48:17] when it's when it's when it's tender and
[48:20] young to to to to to to bring it to to
[48:23] bring it out of the ground the seed then
[48:25] then it gives its leaves and then
[48:27] another stage of the sun
[48:29] um um the hot sun it will kill it if
[48:31] it's the ripening seed or ripening time
[48:33] he said so he regulates the Sun and
[48:35] regulates nature to meet his word he
[48:38] regulates the church the um the uh the
[48:42] predestinated the the the the the the
[48:43] bride to meet the season that they are
[48:46] that they are are are are living in and
[48:49] he said even need to Nature itself even
[48:51] nature itself tells us tells us tells us
[48:55] today as we see the Nations breaking and
[48:57] the Earth sinking and the handwriting is
[48:59] on the wall we see the church and the
[49:01] state and the state in the state it's in
[49:03] now we see the bride in the state in the
[49:06] state and he's we see the church and the
[49:08] state and this and the state it's in he
[49:10] said we see the bride in the state she's
[49:12] in and we know and we know by Nature
[49:14] that the church is getting ready is
[49:16] getting ready is getting ready ready to
[49:20] leave he he's one of the Glorious time
[49:21] it's a time that all the prophets have
[49:23] long to see he said this hour he said
[49:25] now now he's now he revealed his word
[49:28] only in its season and Martin Luther
[49:30] read the same Bible Bible Bible we did
[49:33] he he he he he he said that that Wesley
[49:36] Wesley read the same Bible that Martin
[49:39] Luther did in the Pentecostals read the
[49:40] same Bible that that that that that we'd
[49:44] read now he said but Jesus he's in Jesus
[49:46] read the same Bible read the same Bible
[49:48] that the verse he's read but he he he he
[49:51] said he said he he said he he he he said
[49:55] he he he he he he he he said but they
[49:58] were trying to keep the corn in an early
[50:00] stage when it was ripening he he said
[50:02] see they failed they failed to to to see
[50:06] their hour now and God reveals this word
[50:09] in the season and and and to whom and to
[50:13] whom he he chooses he chooses he chooses
[50:16] to to he to whom he chooses to reveal it
[50:19] to God chooses who he reveals it to and
[50:21] he chose that before the foundation of
[50:23] the world all of this doings were
[50:25] foreknown by him and hidden and hidden
[50:27] and hidden from man he just reveals them
[50:30] as he will it is his chosen season his
[50:33] chosen purpose and he never did choose a
[50:36] part of your sect it is a chosen person
[50:38] and he does it and Zechariah 14 verse 7
[50:41] it says and and but it shall be one day
[50:43] that which which which and one day which
[50:46] shall be known which which shall be
[50:48] known what shall be known to the Lord
[50:51] and not not day nor night but it shall
[50:53] come to pass that in the evening time it
[50:55] shall be a light and in Revelation
[50:57] chapter 10 verse 1 verse verses verses
[51:01] verses one through seven it says and I
[51:04] saw another Mighty Angel come down come
[51:06] down come down down from out of from
[51:09] come down from heaven clothed with the
[51:11] cloud and a rainbow and the rainbow was
[51:13] upon his head and his face was as it
[51:15] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[51:18] fire and he had in his little hand a
[51:20] little book open and he said his he said
[51:23] his right his his right foot upon the
[51:25] sea and his left and his left
[51:27] and his left foot of foot on the earth
[51:30] and and and he cried and and he cried
[51:33] with a loud voice as when the lion world
[51:35] and when he cried the seven Thunders uh
[51:38] other other their their their their
[51:40] their their voices and when the seven
[51:41] Thunders had had had and when the
[51:44] seventh Thunders had uttered their
[51:45] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[51:48] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[51:50] up those things what's this what's the
[51:52] seven what's the seven Thunders uttered
[51:55] and white them not and the angel which I
[51:57] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[51:59] Earth lifted up his hand lifted up his
[52:01] hand and it lifted up
[52:03] lifted up his he he lifted up his hand
[52:07] to him and and swear by him that liveth
[52:09] forever and ever who who who who who who
[52:12] who created heaven and the things and
[52:15] the things that that that that that
[52:18] they're in our hand and the earth and
[52:20] the things in the and the things that
[52:22] they're in our and the Sea and things
[52:24] that that that that that are there in
[52:25] that there should be time no no no no no
[52:28] no no no longer but then he says this in
[52:31] the days of the voice of the seventh
[52:32] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[52:35] mystery of God should be finished as he
[52:37] hath declared to his servants
[52:39] to his servants the prophets and so so
[52:42] so so so so we notice now now now now
[52:44] with that John when he heard those those
[52:47] seven Thunders he was about to write
[52:50] them and
[52:52] the angel told him seal them up and and
[52:55] and and and and and and and and and and
[52:57] and but in the days but it says in the
[52:59] days of the voice he would reveal those
[53:02] things which he which which had which
[53:04] which had been hid since since since the
[53:07] foundation of the world the the the and
[53:09] now and and now and now and now and now
[53:12] today we as the bride of Christ we can
[53:14] stand here and and say that the seven
[53:17] Thunders have to have been opened onto
[53:19] US those things that have been sealed in
[53:20] that book have now been opened up to us
[53:22] because because we now we have a full
[53:24] understanding and a full revelation of
[53:26] just exactly what those seven Thunders
[53:28] are because it because it is now in the
[53:30] correct time and season for these things
[53:39] these these who are the world see are
[53:42] the elect of God they are they are the
[53:45] um predestinated foreknown of God and
[53:47] we're in the mind of God and his
[53:49] thoughts and very plain and very plain
[53:52] language the true bride of Christ was in
[53:55] the mind of God eternally though not
[53:57] expressed until each came forth and then
[53:59] in the designated decreed in the
[54:02] designated
[54:03] decreed season
[54:05] and and and and and and and and as as
[54:09] each as each member came forth it became
[54:11] expressed and took its place in the body
[54:13] thus the bride thus the bride this bride
[54:16] is the literal spoken word seed bride
[54:19] and though she is feminine and and and
[54:21] and and and and and designation she's
[54:25] also called the body of Christ and it is
[54:27] very apparent that she ought to be
[54:29] called that for she was predestinated in
[54:31] him came from the same source and and
[54:33] was eternal with him and is now
[54:35] manifesting God in a many-membered body
[54:38] whereas once God was manifested in one
[54:40] member even our Lord Jesus Christ now
[54:43] now that we are coming to a conclusion
[54:46] as the Eternal logos which was God was
[54:49] manifested it was manifested it was
[54:51] manifested in the son and in Jesus
[54:53] throughout all the fullness of the
[54:54] godhead by head and all the fullness of
[54:56] the godhead all the fullness of the
[54:58] godhead bodily and that internal one was
[55:01] the father manifest in flesh and thereby
[55:03] thereby gained the title of son so even
[55:06] so we Eternal in his thoughts are in our
[55:09] turn
[55:10] became the many membered spoken word
[55:13] seed manifested in flesh and those
[55:15] Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh
[55:18] are all the sons of God even as we are
[55:21] so-called we do not be become seed by by
[55:25] The Rebirth of birth we received and
[55:27] therefore were reborn for only the
[55:29] re-elect can be reborn because we
[55:31] receive is the reason we could be
[55:33] quickened and non-seed there is
[55:35] absolutely nothing nothing nothing
[55:37] nothing nothing
[55:38] to go to to Quicken
[55:41] and um so so what we're seeing now that
[55:44] that that that asses Body of Christ as
[55:47] she's maturing in her season she's
[55:49] Rising forth and she's becoming and
[55:51] she's becoming literally Jesus Christ in
[55:54] flesh again in these last days
[55:56] brother might have said it said now this
[55:58] one here is is a little bit of a reading
[55:59] so you guys will have to help me help me
[56:00] out or you have to have you you you
[56:02] you'll you you'll you'll you'll you'll
[56:05] have to you'll have to bear bear with
[56:08] the movie with me but it's a bit of it's
[56:11] a bit of a of a foundation here
[56:14] brother Brown said he he was talking
[56:18] about uh uh uh about
[56:20] um
[56:21] um
[56:22] um
[56:23] um Abraham here he he he's now that's
[56:25] exactly what God did what God did about
[56:27] the Royal by the royal royal seat of
[56:30] Abraham he said now I know Isaac was the
[56:32] Seed of Abraham potentially it was the
[56:34] natural seed his CC seed but not the
[56:36] real seed he said that real seed that
[56:38] real seed his his seed was Christ The
[56:41] Royal seed Isaac only was a
[56:43] substitutionary until Christ came which
[56:45] was the Seed of Abraham he he he he said
[56:48] he he he he he he he he said he he says
[56:52] he says then the real Seed of Abraham
[56:54] believes the promise just like just like
[56:56] what just like just like Abraham did
[56:58] because it because it's it's because
[57:00] it's to Abraham and his seat after him
[57:02] now watch what God did what God did what
[57:06] god did did
[57:07] um did to the Royals royal seed seed is
[57:11] the seeds need to make the Covenant
[57:12] confirmed he took Christ which was the
[57:15] seat of Abraham on Calvary he tore him
[57:17] apart and he took his spirit off him and
[57:19] he put his body in the grave in his soul
[57:21] in hell and raised him up on the third
[57:23] date and raised up his body and brought
[57:26] it up into glory and there's and there
[57:29] sent the spirit back down and kept the
[57:31] body on his right hand side and sent the
[57:33] spirit back down to live in the church
[57:34] to make to make to make a church just so
[57:37] much with the Life of Christ that in the
[57:39] end of that in the Resurrection the two
[57:41] will come will that the two will will
[57:43] the two will come together bride and
[57:46] bridegroom in the church in Christ will
[57:48] be exactly alike with the same kind of
[57:50] ministry the same kind of power the same
[57:53] kind of spirit and that he raised up the
[57:54] he raised up the body of Jesus Christ
[57:56] and sat on his right side his right hand
[57:59] and poured down the spirit the the the
[58:01] spirit
[58:02] upon the church on the day of Pentecost
[58:05] cause that's how God proved his Covenant
[58:07] with his church
[58:09] so so we noticed now now now now that
[58:13] that that that that that
[58:15] um that that there was a that there was
[58:16] that God performed a super sign and and
[58:19] we know we we know that that that that
[58:21] that that that that brother Brown had
[58:22] called the super sign the Discerning of
[58:24] the spirits of the heart and um um and
[58:27] and and and and and we all know that's
[58:30] that that that that God that God that
[58:31] God had that that that God that God
[58:33] adopted Jesus on the on the mount on the
[58:36] mount Transfiguration and and and and
[58:38] and he overshadowed them and he took him
[58:41] up and he took him up and he took him up
[58:43] up up to two two two a public place when
[58:47] he had it and he had and he had Peter
[58:49] James and John and John with them his
[58:51] three Witnesses
[58:53] and he overshadowed them and and his
[58:56] Raymond began to begin to shine like the
[58:59] sun sun the sun and and he said and the
[59:02] voice and a voice came out came out came
[59:04] out from Heaven saying saying this is my
[59:07] beloved Son hear ye
[59:13] [Music]
[59:17] I've placed him positionally that's my
[59:21] son what he says I'll back up he keeps
[59:23] my word he spot through all of these
[59:25] denominations and everything else and
[59:27] has kept the faith he's pulled no
[59:29] punches he's been true he's always he's
[59:31] always about my work and when people
[59:32] look at him they see me this is my son
[59:35] hear ye him and and and and further on
[59:39] down brother Branham says this is it
[59:42] says it says it says says says that God
[59:45] took Abraham out and placed the adoption
[59:47] upon him and changed his name and he
[59:49] says Glory from Abram to Abraham and
[59:52] Abraham comes from the word Elohim God's
[59:55] Own Name he Associated his name with
[59:58] God's name God
[1:00:00] um God God is Elohim how many how many
[1:00:03] knows that the great Jehovah the great
[1:00:05] Jehovah
[1:00:06] um
[1:00:07] um um
[1:00:09] Elohim Elohim the the the the
[1:00:12] all-sufficient one one the self-existing
[1:00:15] one Elohim and what did he do he took
[1:00:17] the Hem off his name and placed it into
[1:00:19] Abraham's name because he he was Abraham
[1:00:21] God is the is the father of all and
[1:00:24] Abraham is the father of Nations Glory
[1:00:26] Elohim Elohim father of all Abraham
[1:00:29] father of Nations placed him
[1:00:30] positionally glory now he said that's
[1:00:33] after his church that's after his church
[1:00:35] received the Holy Ghost after after they
[1:00:38] after they had went through the testing
[1:00:39] see Pentecostal missed that they
[1:00:42] organized they they they they organized
[1:00:44] they organized themselves and couldn't
[1:00:46] get any further and then when God does a
[1:00:49] certain thing say uh-huh stay away from
[1:00:50] it see our church don't teach that he
[1:00:52] said he said he said go ahead now he
[1:00:54] said but here's what he done to Abraham
[1:00:56] to Abraham and he seen afterwards and
[1:01:00] and and and
[1:01:02] so we notice now and in the scriptures
[1:01:05] that just a couple days a couple days or
[1:01:08] that that when God had placed Abraham he
[1:01:10] just changed his name from Abram to
[1:01:12] Abraham to to Abraham a couple days Days
[1:01:15] days later he shows up he he he he he he
[1:01:18] he shows up and and he said and and he
[1:01:22] said and he said he he said he said hey
[1:01:24] he he he said he said he said he said
[1:01:27] Abraham he said he said I'm going to
[1:01:29] give you a sign and and he he said he he
[1:01:33] he said you will have a son and Sarah
[1:01:36] laughed at him and and but now but now
[1:01:38] if I can find the spot he said he said
[1:01:41] he he he he he he said he said before he
[1:01:45] received his super son or his son that
[1:01:46] was to be born a super son of course
[1:01:49] before he before be before he received
[1:01:51] him he he he he's not the Royal one now
[1:01:54] but before he received him he received
[1:01:56] the super sign he said what was it God
[1:01:59] came down to him in the form of a man
[1:02:01] he's a notice he's he he he he he he
[1:02:04] he's noticed that man that talked to
[1:02:06] them that that that's that's that stood
[1:02:08] that's that that stood in the tent where
[1:02:11] he was and he performed a super sign and
[1:02:13] when his super son come on the scene his
[1:02:15] super son performed the same sign the
[1:02:18] sign his sign to show that he was
[1:02:20] Abraham's supersede glory and he
[1:02:22] promised the same thing in these last
[1:02:24] days and and he performed a sign and he
[1:02:26] performed the sign I I signed a signed
[1:02:28] to Abraham to let him know that he was
[1:02:30] the supersede he said where Sarah and
[1:02:33] she said she is in the tent behind you
[1:02:34] he said I'm going to visit you according
[1:02:37] to according according according to the
[1:02:40] time of life and Sarah did something she
[1:02:42] kind of laughed and he said Why did Why
[1:02:44] did Why did Why did Why did
[1:02:48] why did Sarah laugh laugh saying that
[1:02:53] these things that these things he cannot
[1:02:54] be and and he perceived the thoughts
[1:02:57] that was in Sarah's mind in the tent
[1:02:59] behind him and he knew that that was God
[1:03:01] so this is so so so so so we noticed now
[1:03:05] now now that at the time at the time of
[1:03:08] that super sign is when God came down
[1:03:10] and he adopted and and he adopted a and
[1:03:13] he adopted he adopted he adopted
[1:03:19] Abraham
[1:03:21] and and at the adoption time God God had
[1:03:25] sent us into Super slime
[1:03:27] showing showing what the time and the
[1:03:29] seasons was to be at the discernment of
[1:03:32] the thoughts of the thoughts and the in
[1:03:34] the intents of the heart God placing
[1:03:36] himself in the man Elohim and this and
[1:03:39] this and this and this and this today in
[1:03:42] our day in our day again again again
[1:03:44] again in these last days this is now the
[1:03:47] hour hour the hour for adoption God has
[1:03:50] sent again another Super sign in our
[1:03:52] days
[1:03:54] it was the discernment of the thoughts
[1:03:56] and the intents of the heart and no
[1:03:58] other age it had ever been except for
[1:04:00] this age then that there was never a
[1:04:02] time a time like we were saying again in
[1:04:04] these last days but but but but but but
[1:04:07] we are saying it again again again today
[1:04:10] in these last days it's God back in this
[1:04:13] church again Elohim in his bride and and
[1:04:17] it is that Covenant if that Covenant
[1:04:19] that that that that that he made that he
[1:04:21] made with Adam without him without him
[1:04:23] and and the garden
[1:04:25] in the garden in the in the Garden of
[1:04:28] Eden it was an unconditional it was on
[1:04:31] an unconditional Covenant it was no
[1:04:32] strings attached to it whatsoever and
[1:04:34] that he would send it and he would see
[1:04:36] he would he would send the Savior God
[1:04:38] promised it and he fulfilled that that
[1:04:40] that that that that that that that that
[1:04:42] that promise but but in that Covenant
[1:04:46] that Covenant he made without him was
[1:04:48] perfectly was perfectly was perfectly
[1:04:50] was perfectly fulfilled and since that's
[1:04:53] and and so will the Covenant that God
[1:04:55] that God had given on on to Abraham
[1:04:58] um that and that his seed
[1:04:59] unconditionally will will be fulfilled
[1:05:03] just as certain as Jesus Christ you guys
[1:05:06] can't get just as certain as Jesus
[1:05:08] Christ he can come to the Earth come to
[1:05:11] the Earth to fulfill what God had said

[1:06:07] accepted it and by faith I believe it
[1:06:10] whether I feel good or whether I feel
[1:06:12] like it or not I am anyhow because God

[1:07:00] knowing that whatsoever we have need of
[1:07:03] God God is obligated to fulfill it from
[1:07:07] brother Branham said said
[1:07:10] this and said that when you become a
[1:07:12] Christian God gives you a checkbook in
[1:07:14] there with Jesus name sign at the bottom
[1:07:16] of it for anything you have need of
[1:07:18] while you're
[1:07:20] wow oh no well anything you haven't
[1:07:23] either while you're on you're on life's
[1:07:24] journey are you afraid to cast it he
[1:07:26] said amen fill it out and send it and
[1:07:28] send it to headquarters and see what God
[1:07:30] what God will do about it amen this is
[1:07:33] the bride's day we have found favor we
[1:07:35] have found a favor with God so just as
[1:07:38] just as mass Mary had had found have
[1:07:40] found had found had found favorite with
[1:07:43] God and then and that angel came and
[1:07:45] said said Thou Art highly favored among
[1:07:47] um among among women or women this is
[1:07:50] the hour of favor favor for the Bride of
[1:07:53] the bride of Christ Gideon when when
[1:07:55] when when when when when when when when
[1:07:57] Guinea he was out there he was out there
[1:08:00] threshing wheat threshing wheat wheat
[1:08:02] wheat behind the behind the behind the
[1:08:03] wine press because he was he was scared
[1:08:05] and the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:08:07] him and unto him and said thou Mighty
[1:08:09] Man of Valor why he he was a he was a
[1:08:12] scared chicken but
[1:08:14] by the end of it but by the end of it he
[1:08:17] began to realize he'll realize that this
[1:08:19] was now the time in the season for a
[1:08:21] complete deliverance the Deliverance
[1:08:25] Deliverance whether for the children of
[1:08:27] Israel and he and he knew without a shot
[1:08:29] of doubt that God that God had called
[1:08:31] him and he and he was able to stand up
[1:08:33] stand up and stand up with just with us
[1:08:35] with just 300 men and drive out and
[1:08:38] drive out and drive out every enemy that
[1:08:40] that that that that
[1:08:41] Israelites had maybe because because he
[1:08:44] caught of what he caught exactly what
[1:08:47] God had called him to do and he realized
[1:08:49] it was the time and the season for it
[1:08:51] and why he he he had stood up and stood
[1:08:54] in his position in all confidence and in
[1:08:57] all boldness and he stood there on his
[1:08:58] word and said if God before me then who
[1:09:03] can be against me and so so so so so we
[1:09:06] notice now now now now now now now now
[1:09:10] that um um that uh brother random said
[1:09:13] said that he sends us he sends us with
[1:09:15] his message and he said let's go with
[1:09:18] the message and go and go with something
[1:09:19] to tell he said go go tell he said not
[1:09:22] not run and not run and then not and
[1:09:24] then and then and then not be able to
[1:09:26] tell he said first let's get it let's
[1:09:28] get it in our own heart and he said when
[1:09:30] you come up when you come up when you
[1:09:32] come up to be prayed for in the morning
[1:09:34] he said don't come don't don't don't

[1:09:40] half past it away he said come with a
[1:09:42] message in your heart he said I am he I
[1:09:44] am he that was dead and alive again he's
[1:09:47] I am the one that gave the message and
[1:09:48] he said these signs tell follow them
[1:09:50] that believe if God Almighty could take
[1:09:53] a little cross-eyed baby and turn his
[1:09:55] side sight and turn the sight normal
[1:09:58] DACA and it's starting to sight back
[1:10:00] normal when normal was just a prayer
[1:10:01] that God could take a baby
[1:10:03] a baby boy born never did see in his
[1:10:06] life and 16 years old restore his
[1:10:08] eyesight back and restore and restore
[1:10:11] his eyes like back to him God can take a
[1:10:14] miserable rest of a cancer-eating person

[1:12:00] the and the time and the time for the
[1:12:02] stuff we are a fully manifested bride of
[1:12:05] Jesus Christ Elohim back in his bride
[1:12:07] again in these last days the message of
[1:12:09] Luther it will not it will not it will
[1:12:12] not it it won't it won't work work work
[1:12:15] work work work work
[1:12:17] in these days the the the message of
[1:12:21] Wesley won't won't will not work will
[1:12:24] not work will not work work work work
[1:12:27] work for these days today days if if if
[1:12:31] if Moses would have come and brought
[1:12:33] Noah's message message it wouldn't have
[1:12:35] worked and neither would Jesus and and
[1:12:37] and and other and either and neither
[1:12:40] would would Jesus's message ever ever
[1:12:42] worked ever worked ever worked ever
[1:12:45] worked worked for uh for for Moses and
[1:12:47] either will will will will bless his
[1:12:49] message
[1:12:52] Luther's messages for Wesley and vice
[1:12:55] versa but and and and and and and and
[1:12:58] and and and and and we're looking around
[1:13:02] now and we see that the glass the last
[1:13:04] great Reformation was it was was it was
[1:13:07] was was
[1:13:08] Pentecost and and today and today we can
[1:13:12] see that we have moved on on on on to me
[1:13:15] from that
[1:13:17] why because the Pentecostal message will
[1:13:20] not mix will will not mix with what we
[1:13:22] will with what we have well with what we
[1:13:24] have what with what we have what we have
[1:13:27] what we have today and and and and and
[1:13:31] and it's and and and and it's because
[1:13:34] God is is forming a building up he's
[1:13:36] he's laid the foundation and and he's
[1:13:40] built the walls and he's come on up and
[1:13:42] he's and he and he's forming the roof
[1:13:43] now and he's shutting that Capstone
[1:13:45] right on top of the roof
[1:13:47] it's like the the the defeat and the
[1:13:50] arms and all coming together and it and
[1:13:53] it's not that we that we throw the
[1:13:56] messages away of Luther and Wesley why
[1:13:58] Hawaii because they in their season they
[1:13:59] were exactly what this bride needed
[1:14:02] we're not on the roof roof roof roof
[1:14:06] putting a bunch of foundation a bunch of
[1:14:08] foundation blocks up we're on the roof
[1:14:09] and we're putting shingles on it it's
[1:14:11] we're in a totally different stage of
[1:14:12] Life on this stuff
[1:14:15] but and and just and just like and just
[1:14:18] like like like like like the life of a
[1:14:21] wheat it's combed up and and it started
[1:14:24] out just just as little as this little
[1:14:26] sprig that maybe look like grass and
[1:14:27] it's ComEd up and it was growing up and
[1:14:29] and we begin to see now what is taking
[1:14:32] place all the way up through Luther's
[1:14:34] stage and and and and and Wesley's age
[1:14:37] and all through Pentecost but now the
[1:14:39] banana but now that that shuck has
[1:14:40] pulled back and it's revealing it's
[1:14:42] revealing the fruit of that of that
[1:14:44] wheat and it's lying here wide open and
[1:14:46] it's ready for and it's ready now and
[1:14:47] it's ready now and then now and then
[1:14:49] after the Harvest time we're not in
[1:14:50] Luther's age of the planting season
[1:14:51] we're not in Wesley's age of the
[1:14:54] planning season we're now in the harvest
[1:14:57] season season for the bride of Christ
[1:15:00] just just just just just just just
[1:15:04] as a corn of wheat of of we of we of we
[1:15:07] have we had
[1:15:09] I had to fall in the fallen in the
[1:15:11] ground and die took the race back up
[1:15:13] again just like Jesus
[1:15:16] I had to die on the cross and raise up
[1:15:18] again and so did the Church of of of of
[1:15:21] of of of Pentecost they've had to
[1:15:23] they've had to die and and and and and
[1:15:25] it had to go on the ground of them of
[1:15:28] all them Dark Ages
[1:15:31] and any grain that that that that that
[1:15:34] that goes in the ground it has to land
[1:15:36] that in that dark time to bring forth
[1:15:38] life but she started sprouting up
[1:15:41] through Martin Luther and come on up and
[1:15:42] through Wesley and on the Pentecost and
[1:15:44] now and now we go out in the Grain and
[1:15:46] the dinner and this is Brother random
[1:15:47] and now the denominational systems that
[1:15:49] they left behind their stocks that's all
[1:15:51] it's to be burned he said the
[1:15:53] denomination system but the real grain
[1:15:55] of wheat that's come out of each of each
[1:15:57] of each one of those reformations will
[1:15:58] be caught up in the bride it all all
[1:16:00] together we'll make the bride brother
[1:16:02] brother Madam says this is that and in
[1:16:04] there there would be a Time come forth
[1:16:07] when he could express himself and
[1:16:09] fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:16:11] his church we have the um we have the
[1:16:15] um um um we have the
[1:16:18] preeminence is in this church oh my what
[1:16:20] he said what the anointed man now and
[1:16:22] his anointed people oh my to bring back
[1:16:25] the anointed right and and the
[1:16:28] bridegroom anointed by by by why and
[1:16:31] he's about why except in what Eve had
[1:16:33] turned down and Adam coming back with
[1:16:35] the anointing of the word because he
[1:16:37] said my word is spirit see Spirit of the
[1:16:39] word and when Eve turned down he comes
[1:16:42] back and we accept he's now he's now we
[1:16:44] see that that hybrid condition again
[1:16:46] does exactly what what he had what what
[1:16:50] what he had that that had had done to
[1:16:54] Eve but now we as the bride of Christ
[1:16:55] we're coming forth and we and now that
[1:16:59] truck has pulled back and that
[1:17:00] denominational system is dying off and
[1:17:02] now the bride of Christ is standing is
[1:17:04] standing tall and and all in all the
[1:17:06] glory of of the power of Christ around
[1:17:08] her and she has all authority and all
[1:17:11] power and and she can she can look any
[1:17:15] devil in the eye and say get the hints
[1:17:17] why because she had as the authority of
[1:17:19] Christ and we're now standing with all
[1:17:21] authority and in all power that that was
[1:17:23] promised us in these last days and so so
[1:17:26] so so so so so so so

[1:17:47] saying a bear and and and and and and
[1:17:49] and and and other people saying this
[1:17:51] thing but he said you take that picture
[1:17:53] and you turn it sideways and he said

[1:19:27] message the mystery of God should be
[1:19:29] finished and the Mystery of the
[1:19:30] revelations of of 10 1-7 the last
[1:19:33] message to the last Church age fulfills
[1:19:36] exactly in this age Luke 17 30 the day

[1:19:41] and and and in another place he says he
[1:19:46] says now watch now he has appeared to us
[1:19:48] in the same form that he did that that
[1:19:50] he did to them in the Old Testament and
[1:19:52] the same as he did as he did as as he
[1:19:55] did he as he did in in the New Testament

[1:20:00] Christ and I declare and I declare to
[1:20:03] you that Christ is the Holy Ghost and

[1:20:13] word Quest means the anointed one and
[1:20:16] just as a person that just a person just
[1:20:19] a person a person that's anointed that
[1:20:21] is the Christ that is the Christ the
[1:20:23] anointed one how many knows how many
[1:20:25] knows knows knows knows that that's true
[1:20:27] he said the anointed one that there
[1:20:29] would be a man that would be anointed
[1:20:30] Anointed with what the Bible says in
[1:20:32] Acts 2 that Jesus the Nazareth of
[1:20:34] Nazareth a man approved for God Anointed
[1:20:37] with the Holy Ghost went about it and
[1:20:38] done great works and things and see that
[1:20:40] God manifested prove that he was in this
[1:20:43] man he said and now we become Anointed
[1:20:46] with that same Spirit we are anointed
[1:20:49] Messiahs Messiahs of the last day to
[1:20:51] shine forth the resurrection of Jesus
[1:20:53] Christ to show that he is not dead but

[1:25:12] confidence knowing that God that Christ
[1:25:14] does not see us that Christ does not
[1:25:15] does not does not does not is he is as a
[1:25:19] as a weak hopeless denominational sinner

[1:25:54] the head with that every day it's what
[1:25:56] you're going to become but yeah we can
[1:25:58] stand here and all confidence and not
[1:26:00] and not and not look at ourselves
[1:26:02] through our eyes but look but but look
[1:26:03] but look through the mirror of God's
[1:26:05] word and we can stand there and say

[1:26:21] now on us and that now makes us an heir
[1:26:23] and a joint Heir with with
[1:26:27] Christ what we need to do is let a
[1:26:30] vision break out breakouts breakouts
[1:26:32] break out over our lives and and and
[1:26:34] serious ourselves not as the world sees
[1:26:36] us but as Christ as Christ as Christ
[1:26:40] sees this a Son of God that that has
[1:26:42] that has broken out of those prison bars
[1:26:45] and a step forth and with full Authority
[1:26:47] and full power and where we can look
[1:26:51] and where we can look we we can look
[1:26:54] that double right in the eye and say
