[49:15] and and
[49:17] it didn't work out and so uh and it was
[49:20] still on my heart so I I called him up
[49:23] and said you want to lead songs let me

[58:25] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[58:28] pray and all the Believers says
[58:31] amen and amen Matthew the sixth chapter
[58:34] and in the ninth verse is actually the
[58:36] Lord's Prayer he said after this manner
[58:39] therefore pray ye Our Father which art
[58:42] in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy

[58:56] the word of the hour
[58:58] and forgive us our debtors as we forgive
[59:00] or forgive us our debts rather as we
[59:03] forgive our debtors and lead us not into
[59:06] temptation
[59:07] but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is
[59:10] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[59:13] forever amen in the book of First
[59:17] Corinthians the 15th chapter
[59:19] First Corinthians 15 and I want to look
[59:22] in the 33rd verse First Corinthians 15.
[59:28] you love the Lord tonight
[59:30] amen First Corinthians 15 and verse 33
[59:33] Paul here writing he says now be not
[59:36] deceived evil Communications corrupt
[59:40] good manner somebody say corrupt
[59:42] evil Communications corrupt good manners
[59:45] awake to righteousness and sin not for
[59:49] some have not the knowledge of God and I
[59:52] speak this to your shame amen we ask the
[59:56] Lord this evening to add the blessing to
[59:57] the reading of his word as you can have
[59:59] your seats here this afternoon I want to
[1:00:01] by the help of the Lord for just a few
[1:00:03] moments tonight if God would give us
[1:00:05] Grace I want to speak to you here on the
[1:00:07] thought of a title tonight Under the
[1:00:10] Influence under the influence you know I
[1:00:13] believe there's Christians that we're
[1:00:14] living in a time of influence and I I
[1:00:17] believe that influence is a powerful
[1:00:19] thing I believe it's a it's a it's a
[1:00:21] it's something that we should take not
[1:00:22] lightly but we should take very heavily
[1:00:25] that influence is a very powerful thing
[1:00:28] now uh just maybe to lay a foundation
[1:00:30] here I was looking at several different
[1:00:31] definitions and meanings of influence
[1:00:33] and one definition it means the capacity
[1:00:36] to have an effect on the character the
[1:00:39] development or the behavior of someone
[1:00:41] or something thing or the effect itself
[1:00:44] influence is the power to shape so when
[1:00:47] when influence comes up on something it
[1:00:50] begins to shape it it begins to form it
[1:00:52] another definition means the process of
[1:00:54] producing modifications especially when
[1:00:57] slow or permanent Amen to exert or
[1:01:00] maintain a mental or moral power upon or
[1:01:03] over others so amen influence is
[1:01:05] something that's slow but it happens it
[1:01:08] amen maybe not overnight does it change
[1:01:10] but when influence begins to affect
[1:01:12] something over time you can see the
[1:01:14] influence of what is upon that thing
[1:01:16] changing it another definition of
[1:01:18] influence means the flowing into have
[1:01:20] power rather in the form of motive or
[1:01:23] ability so amen if there if there is an
[1:01:26] influence coming up on something it's
[1:01:28] actually a power that's flowing into it
[1:01:31] now you all know that brother random
[1:01:32] preaches several messages called
[1:01:34] influence influences then he preaches
[1:01:36] the influence of another and when he
[1:01:38] preaches that he takes it from Isaiah
[1:01:40] the sixth chapter and he shows you how
[1:01:42] that Isaiah come under the influence of
[1:01:45] Uzziah and he said when he did that he
[1:01:47] said he got his eyes off of the Lord got
[1:01:49] his eyes over on his eye and he said
[1:01:51] Uzziah become his influence and he said
[1:01:53] God actually let usiah fall Amen to
[1:01:57] prove to to Isaiah that have no other
[1:01:59] gods before me have no other influences
[1:02:01] amen your influence should be the Lord
[1:02:04] now when brother bran preaches this he
[1:02:05] said I want to take a subject this
[1:02:07] morning called influence and he said now
[1:02:09] you know as we might not want to believe
[1:02:11] this but everything that we do amen we
[1:02:14] are influencing someone else everything
[1:02:16] we do we are influencing someone else
[1:02:19] another place he said amen we need
[1:02:21] influential Christians amen that are
[1:02:24] influenced by the word of God we need
[1:02:26] influential Christians amen that are
[1:02:28] influenced by the word of God Amen
[1:02:31] called men or women for an influence
[1:02:33] Amen to the elected church for the last
[1:02:35] days that's what we need what we need
[1:02:37] amen is an influence from the elected
[1:02:40] Church in the last days he said and God
[1:02:43] give it to us they'll be there they're
[1:02:45] going to be now when you think about
[1:02:46] this influence influence actually has
[1:02:49] the power to convert something you all
[1:02:51] believe that influence has the power to
[1:02:53] change something has the power to shape
[1:02:55] something or to convert something in the
[1:02:57] Book of Luke the first chapter and the
[1:02:59] first verse the Bible said as much as
[1:03:01] many have taken in hand to set forth in
[1:03:04] order a declaration of those things
[1:03:05] which are most surely believed among us
[1:03:07] even as they delivered them unto us
[1:03:10] which from the beginning amen were
[1:03:12] eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word
[1:03:14] it seemed good to me also having had
[1:03:17] perfect understanding of all things from
[1:03:19] the very first to write unto thee in
[1:03:21] order and then Luke says most excellent
[1:03:24] Theophilus now when you look at this
[1:03:26] word Theophilus his name actually means
[1:03:28] a friend of God Theophilus means a
[1:03:31] friend of God and actually who he was he
[1:03:33] was the person here amen that Luke
[1:03:35] addresses his gospel to as well as the
[1:03:38] book of Acts now he was probably an
[1:03:40] official of high rank so if flesh amen
[1:03:43] when when he began he was not a
[1:03:45] Christian he was not a he was not maybe
[1:03:47] a Believer amen but he was an official
[1:03:50] of high rank he was a gentile a man of a
[1:03:53] rank and a consideration now watch this
[1:03:55] who came under the influence of Luke or
[1:03:57] Paul at Rome amen and was converted to
[1:04:01] the Christian faith so in other words
[1:04:02] here you've got this this Theophilus who
[1:04:05] is a high-ranking a gentile amen and
[1:04:07] everybody's looking at him everybody's
[1:04:09] talking to him amen but then he comes in
[1:04:11] contact with two holy ghost-filled men
[1:04:13] we'll say it like that amen Luke and and
[1:04:16] and uh Luke and Paul amen and then he's
[1:04:19] converted to the Christian faith now I
[1:04:21] want to say it to you like this what
[1:04:22] happened to Theophilus amen was he came
[1:04:24] in contact with influential Christians
[1:04:27] amen he came in contact with Believers
[1:04:29] Amen in other words he came in contact
[1:04:31] with salt right now in the Book of
[1:04:34] Matthew the fifth chapter the 13th verse
[1:04:36] amen the Bible says that ye are the salt
[1:04:38] of the earth but if the salt has lost
[1:04:41] its savior it man we're with shall it be
[1:04:43] salted it is henceforth good for nothing
[1:04:45] amen but to be cast down or cast out and
[1:04:49] to be trodden under the foot of man so
[1:04:52] when when influence happens or rather
[1:04:54] when salt amen loses its savior amen it
[1:04:57] is to be cast out and trodden under the
[1:05:00] foot of man can you say Amen now that
[1:05:02] word salt actually is a symbol amen of a
[1:05:05] lasting Concord because it protects food
[1:05:07] amen from putrification and it preserves
[1:05:11] it unchanged so when salt comes into
[1:05:13] something it has the ability Amen to
[1:05:16] preserve something and to keep it from
[1:05:18] changing now you know the prophet taught
[1:05:20] us that we must be salty amen and if
[1:05:23] we're salty then the world will be
[1:05:24] thirsty right amen if the salt in our
[1:05:27] life be it full of Savior amen then it
[1:05:30] will create a thirst in the world
[1:05:32] probably God said you are the salt of
[1:05:34] the earth but if the salt has only got a
[1:05:36] look and not a savior amen it's
[1:05:38] henceforth good for nothing but to be
[1:05:40] laughed at so it's it's not good enough
[1:05:42] just to look like salt it's not good
[1:05:45] enough just to act like salt amen but
[1:05:47] there's got to be some Savor in that
[1:05:49] salt again the prophet said you know
[1:05:51] Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word
[1:05:52] of God he said the Bible said that we
[1:05:54] are the salt of the earth and if the
[1:05:57] salt is still God its savior in it amen
[1:05:59] in contacts it's a savior amen so if
[1:06:02] salt still has its Savory and it
[1:06:04] contacts something then whatever it
[1:06:06] contacts it will have an influence upon
[1:06:09] what it contacts see if the Saul has
[1:06:11] lost its string he said if our
[1:06:13] testimonies are irregular and one they
[1:06:15] were up and the next they were down and
[1:06:17] this they were believing and the next
[1:06:19] day we're not we how can a sinner
[1:06:21] how can a sinner amen find anything from
[1:06:24] us see amen we must take our stand for
[1:06:27] God and there remain there until death
[1:06:30] sets us free and when you start looking
[1:06:32] at this salt amen there's got to be a
[1:06:34] strength in the salt amen and the
[1:06:36] strength that's in the salt brother says
[1:06:38] is the power of the Resurrection in the
[1:06:41] Christian he said see the strength of
[1:06:43] the holy spirit amen should be in every
[1:06:46] member of the church how many will agree
[1:06:48] that the strings amen of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:50] should be in every member of the church
[1:06:53] see what do you mean strength he says
[1:06:55] the power of the Resurrection he said
[1:06:58] the life that Jesus gave for the church
[1:07:00] should be operating Amen in every member
[1:07:03] of the body the life of Jesus Christ
[1:07:06] amen should be operating in every member
[1:07:09] of the body he said now salt will only
[1:07:11] save it if it contacts amen but it must
[1:07:14] contact and if the church gets that
[1:07:16] burden on their heart Amen to contact
[1:07:18] someone Amen to get someone saved he
[1:07:21] said then the strings amen is coming
[1:07:23] back into the church again amen into the
[1:07:26] people so amen we're not looking for the
[1:07:29] strengths that come into the carpet or
[1:07:30] to the sheetrock or to the amen to the
[1:07:32] peace but we're looking for the strength
[1:07:34] of the Holy Spirit which is the power of
[1:07:37] the Resurrection Amen to come into every
[1:07:39] member and make them more than a church
[1:07:42] member amen but makes him an influential
[1:07:44] Christian Amen in that in the last day
[1:07:46] now amen I said like this our influence
[1:07:49] changes the world Amen not the world
[1:07:52] changed in our influence amen the world
[1:07:55] should the world should not change the
[1:07:57] influence of the Church Father God said
[1:07:59] you're the saw the Earth he said I'm
[1:08:01] afraid I'm afraid that's what happened
[1:08:03] to the church it's just lost his
[1:08:05] sweetness it's lost it's love amen it's
[1:08:07] lost its influence to bring Sinners to
[1:08:09] you Lord he said just taking in a bunch
[1:08:12] of members and baptized them amen and
[1:08:14] let them live in the world Amen and
[1:08:17] their influence has corrupted the church
[1:08:19] amen so when a sinner comes in that's
[1:08:21] what the proud of God said I do not
[1:08:23] believe a man gets saved tonight and
[1:08:25] preach the gospel tomorrow he said I
[1:08:27] don't believe you get saved tonight or
[1:08:29] on the bar room last night playing music
[1:08:31] and get saved and start playing music in
[1:08:33] church now I know that may be
[1:08:34] controversial but let me just preach the
[1:08:36] message amen the prophet believed in a
[1:08:39] transformation amen or a conversion that
[1:08:41] would take every ounce of the world Amen
[1:08:44] out of the individual because if that
[1:08:46] ounce of world comes in the church amen
[1:08:48] it don't take two pounds it don't take
[1:08:50] amen two gallons to change it just takes
[1:08:53] one ounce of the world coming in the
[1:08:54] church and that one ounce can corrupt
[1:08:57] the church amen but I say oh God let the
[1:08:59] power of the Holy Ghost amen come back
[1:09:02] in the church to when a sinner gets
[1:09:04] saved amen they don't change church
[1:09:06] books they don't change Church cards
[1:09:07] they but they changed from the inside
[1:09:09] out Amen in all the world dies and all
[1:09:13] the birth of Jesus Christ and his power
[1:09:15] comes into the individual now I'll just
[1:09:18] say it like I believe that worldly
[1:09:19] influence don't belong in the church
[1:09:21] amen amen the influence of the world
[1:09:23] does not belong in the church amen now
[1:09:26] the prophet said like this he said
[1:09:28] that's the main thing is being
[1:09:29] influenced see not by what great numbers
[1:09:31] we are but by what a great God that
[1:09:33] we're representing amen and that kind of
[1:09:35] life that's in US is by him see that
[1:09:38] will influence others so can I say it
[1:09:40] this way we are influenced and we
[1:09:42] influence others are you with me we are
[1:09:44] influenced but we also influence others
[1:09:47] and the way we influence others is by
[1:09:49] what we ourselves have been influenced
[1:09:52] by amen he said now we are the salt amen
[1:09:54] but if the salt loses its strength amen
[1:09:57] its power to contact amen salt can only
[1:10:00] save as it contacts and if it loses its
[1:10:03] power of contact then it's no more salt
[1:10:05] amen but it's sand so when Saul loses
[1:10:08] its savior amen when salt loses its
[1:10:11] contact it's no longer salt it becomes
[1:10:14] sand he said and when we lose our
[1:10:16] influence as a father as a mother as a
[1:10:19] Christian as a businessman as a to
[1:10:21] minister when we lose our influence with
[1:10:23] the people now we can be very popular in
[1:10:25] the line of the world Amen but I mean we
[1:10:27] represent Christ amen and when we lose
[1:10:30] our influence he said then how can we
[1:10:32] blend in with the day amen when God is
[1:10:35] so against the day do you realize that
[1:10:37] this is the evil day amen that Paul
[1:10:40] speaks 7 Ephesians the sixth chapter
[1:10:41] amen that they'll they'll come an evil
[1:10:44] day amen and we're living in that day so
[1:10:46] a Christian cannot blend in with this
[1:10:48] day amen but a Christian has got to
[1:10:51] stand out in this state listen you were
[1:10:53] not born to fit in amen you were born to
[1:10:56] stand out amen you say why was I born to
[1:10:59] stand out because you amen are God's
[1:11:02] point of contact on the earth the
[1:11:04] prophet said oh may we and we must press
[1:11:06] with all that's in us do everything we
[1:11:08] can he said be sure that we speak to
[1:11:10] every sinner during the time of this
[1:11:12] convention approach every businessman
[1:11:14] and every unsaved person and those
[1:11:16] without Christ amen without the Holy
[1:11:19] Spirit now I love how he says he said we
[1:11:22] want to approach them with the message
[1:11:24] amen so brother Rana was not one that
[1:11:26] believes you got people to Christ and
[1:11:27] then you got him to the message amen he
[1:11:29] actually believed the message was Christ
[1:11:31] amen so when you approach somebody amen
[1:11:34] you approach him to the channel of the
[1:11:36] message with the same solid gospel to
[1:11:39] approach the people he said let our
[1:11:41] lives be so salty that others can watch
[1:11:44] the way we Act and the way we live and
[1:11:46] they'll want to live that way too see
[1:11:48] amen because if the salt lost its
[1:11:51] testimony its savior amen is trolling
[1:11:53] power then it can no more heal or save
[1:11:56] amen sought contacts and we must be
[1:11:59] God's contact amen we are his point of
[1:12:02] contact on the earth that's why Jesus
[1:12:04] prayed in the model prayer amen Lord he
[1:12:07] said let thy will be done let thy
[1:12:09] kingdom come and let thy will be done in
[1:12:12] earth as it is in heaven see in other
[1:12:15] words you are the salt of the earth I've
[1:12:17] got a good friend down in Florida
[1:12:18] brother Wesco one of his favorite quotes
[1:12:20] is said you're taking Jesus place on the
[1:12:23] earth amen I'll set you like this amen
[1:12:26] he was the salt of the earth when he was
[1:12:28] here amen he was the light of the world
[1:12:30] when he was here amen but he's not here
[1:12:32] to day in a corporate body amen but you
[1:12:35] are here amen which is making you his
[1:12:37] amen making you take his place amen here
[1:12:41] on the earth now when I say it like this
[1:12:43] let me say it this way amen that this
[1:12:45] message of the hour has come into this
[1:12:47] age Amen to be put on display or to be
[1:12:50] exhibited in flesh Amen brother bam
[1:12:53] speaks of it in in 1964 Amen in the
[1:12:56] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:12:57] and the Earthly bride is talking about
[1:12:59] how he goes through town and he's
[1:13:01] visiting the hotels and he's visiting
[1:13:03] the restaurants and he goes through
[1:13:04] there and one of the one of the owners
[1:13:06] says to him
[1:13:08] I said I want to comment to you amen as
[1:13:10] I was going to different places well the
[1:13:12] owners said stream said sir that's one
[1:13:14] of the finest bunch of people I've ever
[1:13:15] seen he said they're really nice so I
[1:13:17] went to a motel yesterday amen and I had
[1:13:20] to had to meet a father and a mother and
[1:13:21] their daughter and I had to go to
[1:13:22] manager to find the room they were in
[1:13:24] and he said are you brother Brandon
[1:13:26] that's up at the Oaks I said yes sir he
[1:13:28] said I want to shake your hand he
[1:13:29] introduced me to his wife very nice
[1:13:31] couple he said every person in this
[1:13:33] Motel is attending services
[1:13:35] said we reserved it for them all the
[1:13:37] other customers we turned down I said
[1:13:39] well thank you for that he said brother
[1:13:41] Branham one of the nicest bunch of
[1:13:42] people I ever seen amen are the people
[1:13:45] that comes up here and that attends your
[1:13:47] meeting see amen I love what he says he
[1:13:50] says so to be that Amen to me you are
[1:13:53] the salt of the earth amen so when a
[1:13:55] prophet was preaching the word amen the
[1:13:58] salt of God was back in human flesh amen
[1:14:01] and it was contacting Sinners Amen to
[1:14:04] the preacher the message in their flesh
[1:14:06] was making an influence upon the
[1:14:08] business owners of the town he said I'm
[1:14:10] so grateful to know I have the privilege
[1:14:12] of preaching to people that even sinners
[1:14:14] now I don't say these people are sinners
[1:14:16] but I mean the business and so forth
[1:14:18] amen can say you're nice people and they
[1:14:21] appreciate you in their business around
[1:14:22] their places you know that's being salty
[1:14:24] amen I appreciate your behavior amen the
[1:14:28] way that you take care of things he said
[1:14:30] I feel you're my children you are the
[1:14:32] stars and if I ever have one when I get
[1:14:34] there you'll be that true you amen out
[1:14:37] shining part in the crown of my Ministry
[1:14:39] amen when it's crowned you will be that
[1:14:41] Jewel amen when when the ministry of
[1:14:44] William random is crowned amen you will
[1:14:47] be the jewels in the ministry of the
[1:14:48] Prophet now come on Church Amen brother
[1:14:51] Branham never went in there and preached
[1:14:52] the future home he never went in there
[1:14:54] and preached the invisible union he
[1:14:56] never went in there and preached things
[1:14:57] that are to be they never heard sermons
[1:15:00] amen but the people who was hearing them
[1:15:02] sermons was under the influence and they
[1:15:04] were being shaped Amen to live a life it
[1:15:07] was according to the word that they was
[1:15:09] hearing I don't know about you but I say
[1:15:11] oh God Amen shape Our Lives amen that
[1:15:14] when people see us and they hear us and
[1:15:16] they meet us amen that their life can be
[1:15:18] contacted by the message of the hour
[1:15:21] because we are the salt of the earth now
[1:15:24] when you start looking at this influence
[1:15:25] you'll realize amen that influence comes
[1:15:28] from somewhere
[1:15:30] right amen influence comes from
[1:15:32] somewhere which tells me amen that
[1:15:34] influence has a source now the prophet
[1:15:37] says here as I've often said I believe
[1:15:38] in the church here there's a role here
[1:15:40] amen that like that we're mortal beings
[1:15:42] live and each one in this great
[1:15:44] conglomeration I get it out in a minute
[1:15:46] of gaiety Amen of Blackness and darkness
[1:15:49] Mortals live in here he said now they
[1:15:51] are either influenced from this away or
[1:15:53] from that away when he says this he said
[1:15:56] you cannot be here amen a spiritual
[1:15:59] being a sinner or Saint amen without
[1:16:02] having an influence from the underworld
[1:16:04] or the above world so brother Terry
[1:16:06] there's two worlds there's an underworld
[1:16:09] and then there is an above world and the
[1:16:11] prophet of God said if you're a sinner
[1:16:13] you've got a spirit influencing you and
[1:16:15] if you're a saint you've got a spirit
[1:16:17] influencing you he said if you're
[1:16:19] influenced from here amen then from
[1:16:21] above see amen your Celestial body is
[1:16:23] waiting up here but if you're Wicked and
[1:16:26] hypocritical and indifferent then your
[1:16:28] Celestial body is down here regardless
[1:16:30] of how much you think it's up there
[1:16:32] because the fruits you bear amen before
[1:16:35] the people proves where you're from so
[1:16:37] you are here what you are somewhere else
[1:16:40] that's why the prophet said amen that
[1:16:42] death does not change a person it only
[1:16:44] changes their Dwelling Place if you was
[1:16:47] indifferent here death is not going to
[1:16:49] make you calm amen meant if he was evil
[1:16:51] here death is not going to make you
[1:16:53] righteous as a tree falls amen so shall
[1:16:56] she lay listen friends the prophet said
[1:16:58] your life you live here is reflecting
[1:17:01] what your inheritance is when you leave
[1:17:03] here another place he said the whole
[1:17:05] Heir has become contaminated with the
[1:17:08] powers of the underworld amen the powers
[1:17:10] of Darkness another place he said the
[1:17:13] sinner is influenced by a spirit amen
[1:17:15] because he has a spirit and the wrong
[1:17:18] gives influence and the right gives
[1:17:19] influence and those who are dominated
[1:17:22] with Blackness and separation amen are
[1:17:25] dominated from the underworld of devils
[1:17:27] now how many will agree we're living in
[1:17:30] the time when the lead has been taken
[1:17:32] off of Hell probably God said the
[1:17:34] letters come off of hell and demon
[1:17:36] powers are streaming throughout the
[1:17:38] world do you realize what they're
[1:17:40] contacting amen they're contacting their
[1:17:42] subjects amen which has an inheritance
[1:17:45] reserved in darkness and and fire amen
[1:17:48] and so what they're doing is their
[1:17:49] manifest investing as a billboard amen
[1:17:52] the underworld listen friends I do not
[1:17:55] believe amen that the devil is the only
[1:17:57] person that's got a billboard in this
[1:17:59] world I believe that Jesus Christ has
[1:18:02] got a bride in this age who is not
[1:18:04] influenced from the underworld but she's
[1:18:07] influenced from the above world and
[1:18:09] she's manifesting the life of God on
[1:18:11] this Earth amen somebody asked me one
[1:18:13] time they said how can you prove amen
[1:18:16] how can you prove that the underworld is
[1:18:18] influenced in this world that we're in I
[1:18:19] said well it's very easy souls in prison
[1:18:21] 1963.
[1:18:23] there I was outside of JCP
[1:18:26] enny he said there I was outside of
[1:18:28] JCPenney he said in front of there and
[1:18:30] he said there come a woman had that blue
[1:18:32] stuff under eyes he said when I looked
[1:18:34] at her I thought I'm a missionary I
[1:18:36] prayed for people around the world he
[1:18:38] said I was going to pray for remember
[1:18:39] that
[1:18:41] you know what he said he said it was
[1:18:43] demon powers manifesting in this realm
[1:18:46] and now watch you say how do you know
[1:18:48] that because when he went to when he
[1:18:50] went uh to the region to the Lost what
[1:18:52] did he say he said there I saw those
[1:18:55] blue eyes and all that makeup and stuff
[1:18:57] and his was his words he said there I
[1:18:59] was back in hell again when he saw it in
[1:19:02] JCPenney amen where did it come from it
[1:19:05] came from the underworld and that Spirit
[1:19:07] of influence had influenced girls listen
[1:19:09] they're literally being influenced from
[1:19:11] the pits of Hell amen I'll say this
[1:19:13] friends it's time to change our
[1:19:15] influence amen it's time to let the word
[1:19:17] of God Amen be our influence amen we are
[1:19:21] influenced by the environment that we
[1:19:23] live in amen like you you take for an
[1:19:25] example a desert amen a desert in the
[1:19:28] Bible or rather a desert today amen a
[1:19:30] desert known to be dry it's known to be
[1:19:33] hot it's known to be sticky it's known
[1:19:35] to not have any moisture amen and if a
[1:19:38] person lives I remember I remember first
[1:19:40] time I ever went to Arizona I hey man I
[1:19:42] was out there for about a week and about
[1:19:43] two days into it brother Kevin hey man I
[1:19:45] just bounce through the I said I
[1:19:46] couldn't even hardly spit I mean I
[1:19:48] wasn't sweating now my hands was I mean
[1:19:50] it was horrible and I'm thinking oh dear
[1:19:52] lord what's going on and come to find
[1:19:53] out I wasn't drinking enough water and
[1:19:56] the in the environment I was in was
[1:19:58] influencing my body probably God said
[1:20:00] the environment you live in amen
[1:20:02] influences you he said
[1:20:05] he's a Christian speaking of a man that
[1:20:06] was called to preach he said it's a
[1:20:08] little boy he said when he become a
[1:20:10] Christian he got in the wrong
[1:20:11] environment and that environment
[1:20:13] influenced him amen now watch he said
[1:20:15] and you just keep holding around with
[1:20:17] that kind of environment and it'll
[1:20:18] influence you see amen the first thing
[1:20:21] you know you become a part of the
[1:20:23] environment amen you go into it and just
[1:20:26] like a good clean man that's clean and
[1:20:28] moral and he begins to associate with a
[1:20:30] bunch of people who's not amen see you
[1:20:32] take up the spirit of that because
[1:20:35] everything is governed by a spirit y'all
[1:20:38] remember talked about Nellie Sanders he
[1:20:40] said she was delivered from dancing he
[1:20:42] said but she went up there and he said
[1:20:44] she thought she could stand there and he
[1:20:46] said before she knew it she found
[1:20:47] herself back on the Dance Floor amen
[1:20:50] what happened the environment pulled her
[1:20:52] into it amen she had been delivered of
[1:20:54] it but the environment influenced her
[1:20:56] and her body followed the influence
[1:20:59] listen I think it's time to discern the
[1:21:01] spirit amen that's motivating the
[1:21:03] atmosphere that we're dwelling in we we
[1:21:05] are under a commission of God to discern
[1:21:07] the spirit to withstand the spirit amen
[1:21:10] and to live under the influence of the
[1:21:12] above world and not the underneath world
[1:21:15] Amen you say why do why is it so
[1:21:17] important is for me as a Christian Amen
[1:21:19] to live amen because God is going to
[1:21:21] have a point of contact in laodicea he's
[1:21:25] going to have somebody he can contact I
[1:21:28] got to thinking about this brother
[1:21:29] shamaya and I heard the story brother M
[1:21:31] Tales he was in a restaurant in Toledo
[1:21:33] Ohio y'all remember the story and he
[1:21:35] said there I was and there was a police
[1:21:36] officer and a young woman he said and
[1:21:39] they said the young woman and the police
[1:21:40] officer sitting there he said the police
[1:21:42] officer had his hands in places they
[1:21:44] should have never been he said while I'm
[1:21:46] sitting there he said there was an old
[1:21:48] woman comes out he said she's dressed
[1:21:50] like a uh like I don't know what he said
[1:21:52] pain on her face all kinds of things he
[1:21:54] said she was immorally dressed he said
[1:21:56] and I started condemning her he said but
[1:21:58] then all of a sudden he said the angel
[1:22:00] showed him Jesus on the cross remember
[1:22:03] he said the angel showed him Jesus it's
[1:22:05] on the cross and he said when I saw him
[1:22:07] he said I began to look there and I seen
[1:22:09] him crawl amen I seen the old book
[1:22:11] laying there as a sinner there laid
[1:22:12] everything on it and I've seen my sins
[1:22:14] what I was doing and I said Lord will
[1:22:16] you forgive me and he took his hand in
[1:22:19] his side and got some blood out and he
[1:22:21] rode across the top and said pardon then
[1:22:24] he threw it back in the sea of
[1:22:25] forgetfulness to remember it no more it
[1:22:27] was gone forever he said now I forgive
[1:22:30] you
[1:22:32] but you're condemning her see he said
[1:22:35] now that changed my idea I said Lord
[1:22:37] have mercy after I come out of it I
[1:22:39] walked over and I sat down I said how do
[1:22:41] you do ma'am she said oh hello I said if
[1:22:43] you'll pardon me I'm Reverend random a
[1:22:45] minister she said oh excuse me excuse me
[1:22:47] go to the story I said I will stand
[1:22:49] there and I was condemning you and
[1:22:50] thinking what a horrible thing maybe
[1:22:52] you've got children she said I have I
[1:22:54] said what caused the way to go wrong she
[1:22:56] said begin to unfold the story amen
[1:22:58] would Rend any heart she said I was
[1:23:01] asking her he said I was asking God Amen
[1:23:03] didn't he just rake such off the Earth
[1:23:05] hear you here with two drunken men
[1:23:07] you're drunk yourself I said someday the
[1:23:09] blood that's holding God's Wrath from
[1:23:11] you is going to you're going to die one
[1:23:13] of these days you're a premarital agent
[1:23:15] now you can reject or receive and I said
[1:23:18] but someday your Soul's going to be on
[1:23:20] there see amen now watch where there's
[1:23:22] no mercy left if you die in your sins
[1:23:25] you're already judged amen you're going
[1:23:27] to hell you know that the woman slipped
[1:23:29] out of the seat there in the restaurant
[1:23:30] and we had a prayer meeting like you've
[1:23:33] never heard in your life and she come to
[1:23:35] Christ he said
[1:23:37] he said don't condemn
[1:23:38] them the gospel
[1:23:41] that's real I
[1:23:43] from over here amen but our influence
[1:23:46] comes from above what did I tell that
[1:23:48] because here's a prophet in a restaurant
[1:23:51] condemning a lady amen but God has got
[1:23:54] him on the earth to be salt amen and
[1:23:57] there he is in that restaurant and God
[1:23:59] gets a hold of him and through him he
[1:24:01] contacts that woman and that woman gives
[1:24:04] her heart to God and serves him the rest
[1:24:06] of her days listen friends I think it's
[1:24:08] time to make sure that our influence is
[1:24:11] in the right place so that God can use
[1:24:13] us anywhere Anytime Anyplace that he
[1:24:16] desires to see fit to use us I don't
[1:24:18] know about you but I want to be a place
[1:24:20] of contact I want to be a place of
[1:24:22] contact that God can use me to contact
[1:24:25] somebody else and to lead them from the
[1:24:28] past of sin into the paths of
[1:24:30] righteousness I love what Paul said he
[1:24:32] said set your affection on things above
[1:24:34] amen and not on things on the earth now
[1:24:36] now we've already said it I'll say it
[1:24:38] again just this way the believer's
[1:24:40] influence is the word right the
[1:24:43] believer's infamous just the word
[1:24:44] probably God said let's not let nothing
[1:24:46] influence us but the word of God let
[1:24:49] that be our influence now whatever is
[1:24:52] influencing you amen it has the
[1:24:54] preeminence of you in other words it has
[1:24:56] consumed you
[1:24:58] whatever is influence in you has the
[1:25:01] preeminence of you it has consumed you
[1:25:03] that's why we cannot let an ounce of the
[1:25:06] world come in the church it will corrupt
[1:25:09] and consume the church Paul said he is
[1:25:11] the body the head of the body of the
[1:25:13] church who is the beginning the
[1:25:14] firstborn from the dead amen that in all
[1:25:18] things he might have the preeminence
[1:25:20] that word preeminence means to be first
[1:25:22] or to hold the first place so brother
[1:25:25] bam says here he said I'm looking for a
[1:25:27] Time To Break Forth of the spirit of God
[1:25:29] in these last days where we're now
[1:25:31] living amen see for a Rapture and Faith
[1:25:33] just before it comes and I believe that
[1:25:35] we're now at the time that the word
[1:25:38] should have the preeminence I believe
[1:25:40] the time to lay aside our Creeds and our
[1:25:42] faults and come back to the word so
[1:25:45] what's he saying here he's saying the
[1:25:47] time has come for the revelation of the
[1:25:49] word which is the head and to take
[1:25:51] preeminence in the body which is a many
[1:25:54] membered body so that is why the
[1:25:56] Christians are the body of God they are
[1:25:58] the source of influence of God upon the
[1:26:01] Earth Paul said ye are our epistle
[1:26:03] written in our hearts known in the red
[1:26:05] of all men for as much as ye are
[1:26:07] manifested declared to be the Epistle of
[1:26:09] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:26:12] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:26:14] God see not in tables of stone but in
[1:26:17] fleshly tables of the heart now can I
[1:26:20] can I read this to you the part of God
[1:26:22] said we never know just what we're doing
[1:26:23] what influence we're doing is having
[1:26:25] upon others that is your life reached so
[1:26:28] loud to the public until your testimony
[1:26:30] if it's contrary to your life is without
[1:26:33] any effect see that's what's it's what's
[1:26:35] on the inside of you that the people
[1:26:37] read not so much what you say but what
[1:26:40] you are seeing you can pin something on
[1:26:42] somebody say this is that and so forth
[1:26:45] but your life being different from what
[1:26:47] they say your testimony of your life is
[1:26:49] louder than the testimony that someone
[1:26:50] could say something about you yeah so
[1:26:52] just keep that on mind that we're
[1:26:54] bringing influences every day right and
[1:26:57] the life that you live proves what's on
[1:26:59] the inside of you amen the life that
[1:27:02] you're living is proving what's on the
[1:27:04] inside of you you cannot change that
[1:27:06] amen it reflects every person reflects
[1:27:09] outside what he is inside amen listen
[1:27:12] when he takes the name on of Jesus
[1:27:14] Christ he is going to be a
[1:27:16] representative Christ then you should
[1:27:18] watch every move you make because
[1:27:20] somebody is watching you I like to say
[1:27:23] it like this it's the Holy Ghost on the
[1:27:25] inside ain't been working on the outside
[1:27:28] oh what a change has come into our life
[1:27:31] amen amen it's Jesus on the inside amen
[1:27:35] working on the outside oh what a change
[1:27:38] in our life amen I said like this that's
[1:27:40] why amen that the holy spirit is a
[1:27:43] definite must in this day Paul said amen
[1:27:47] or Jesus rather said receive the promise
[1:27:49] of the father in The Book of Acts he
[1:27:51] said you shall receive power Paul says
[1:27:53] in Ephesians 5 amen be filled with the
[1:27:56] spirit probably God said that's the
[1:27:58] reason the holy spirit is a definite
[1:28:00] must in this day because it's the one
[1:28:03] that lives your life you don't live it
[1:28:05] yourself it's Christ in you that after
[1:28:08] you receive the Holy Spirit if he don't
[1:28:10] have the preeminence in your life then
[1:28:12] you just remember you haven't received
[1:28:15] the Holy Spirit because if he's in you
[1:28:18] he will live his life
[1:28:21] life on can I just give you a few
[1:28:23] statements here Amen on the Holy Spirit
[1:28:25] influence amen maybe you can remember
[1:28:27] these amen the holy spirit is the
[1:28:30] influence amen that feels and governs
[1:28:33] the soul
[1:28:34] the holy spirit is the influence that
[1:28:37] feels and governs the soul amen the holy
[1:28:40] spirit is the efficient source of any
[1:28:43] power affection emotion or desire amen
[1:28:47] God puts the desire there he has a
[1:28:49] motive and put an affair and he has the
[1:28:52] ability to produce amen the desire that
[1:28:55] he put there and you know friends this
[1:28:57] evening Amen to if we're under the
[1:28:59] influence of something amen the best
[1:29:01] sign amen is to be in direct contact
[1:29:04] with what we're under the influence of
[1:29:06] y'all y'all remember the amen I hope I'm
[1:29:08] not born yet amen y'all remember the
[1:29:10] young boy walked in the bar room that
[1:29:12] day remember said he walked in there and
[1:29:14] he said when he went in there he looked
[1:29:15] and he saw the bartender and he said sir
[1:29:18] your signs down he said okay I'll go out
[1:29:20] there thinking goes out there looks up
[1:29:22] his signs still hanging on the building
[1:29:24] takes his apron cleans it off comes back
[1:29:26] in tells the boy uh Sonny you're wrong
[1:29:28] said my sign's not down said it's right
[1:29:30] there he said no your best sign
[1:29:33] brother Sammy said your best sign he
[1:29:36] said that's the best sign I got he said
[1:29:38] no he said the man that just walked out
[1:29:40] of here
[1:29:41] is laying down there in the gutter
[1:29:44] passed out he said that's your best sign
[1:29:46] see what it was he was under the
[1:29:48] influence of what was being sold on the
[1:29:51] inside and the prophet of God said when
[1:29:53] we see a man under the influence of the
[1:29:54] Holy Spirit until his life is burning
[1:29:57] with the old-fashioned Pentecostal fire
[1:29:59] amen that's the best sign that God ever
[1:30:02] had that a man is saved is when he'll
[1:30:05] serve it's the best sign amen the best
[1:30:08] sign that God's got a hold of your life
[1:30:10] is not you can quote scripture not that
[1:30:12] you can quote the quotes but when you
[1:30:14] will become a channel that God can use
[1:30:16] on the earth to contact others amen that
[1:30:19] is the best sign that you're under amen
[1:30:22] and influence now I'll set like this I
[1:30:24] believe the message of our is our
[1:30:26] influence I believe that influences are
[1:30:28] singing influences are preaching
[1:30:30] influences her dress influences our
[1:30:32] activities come on church amen the
[1:30:34] message of the hour is our influence
[1:30:36] which that means the message of the hour
[1:30:39] is the light first John 1 5 we spoke
[1:30:41] come this morning latter part of that
[1:30:43] scripture it says God is light and then
[1:30:46] him is no Darkness at all amen the
[1:30:49] reason I say this to the church Living
[1:30:51] God today Shalom is because we are his
[1:30:54] lights amen see ye are the light of the
[1:30:57] world now the world is under the
[1:31:00] influence of Darkness right amen but the
[1:31:02] Church of the Living God is under the
[1:31:04] influence of light amen the Bible says
[1:31:07] in John 12 35 yet a little while it's a
[1:31:10] lot with you walk while you have the
[1:31:12] light lest Darkness come upon you for he
[1:31:15] that walketh in darkness knoweth not
[1:31:17] whether he goeth while you have the
[1:31:19] light amen believing the light that you
[1:31:21] may be the children of light amen these
[1:31:24] things spake Jesus and departed and did
[1:31:26] hit himself from them in Ephesians 5 8
[1:31:29] Paul says ye were sometimes Darkness
[1:31:31] amen but now are you alive in the Lord
[1:31:34] so walk as the children of light in
[1:31:38] first Thessalonians 5 5 hear all the
[1:31:40] children of light and the children of
[1:31:42] the day we are not of the night nor of
[1:31:45] the darkness you say then one are the
[1:31:47] children of Life the prophet of God said
[1:31:49] we are to be those children and the
[1:31:51] light is the word which is made light
[1:31:54] for this age how do we know that light
[1:31:56] except it comes from the word so the
[1:31:58] word made flesh is the light of the age
[1:32:02] when you see it the word made flesh is
[1:32:05] the light of the age when you see it now
[1:32:07] how many knows in Matthew 2 that there
[1:32:10] were three wise men right and those
[1:32:12] three wise men were following a star
[1:32:14] Amen to come to the birth of the Lord
[1:32:16] Jesus the Bible says when Jesus was born
[1:32:19] Amen in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
[1:32:21] of Herod the king behold there came wise
[1:32:23] men from the east of Jerusalem saying
[1:32:26] where is he that is born King of the Jew
[1:32:29] for we have seen his star in the east
[1:32:31] and are come to worship Him verse said
[1:32:34] the wise man of the old followed the
[1:32:36] god-given substance they followed the
[1:32:38] word of God to the light because it was
[1:32:41] the word that brought life amen and so
[1:32:43] will the wise man today he says who is
[1:32:46] not blinded by Creeds will follow the
[1:32:48] god-given spoken word till they see the
[1:32:51] fullness of the power of God blooming
[1:32:53] forth in this hour they see it and they
[1:32:56] know it's here in the scripture amen
[1:32:57] because God promised it for this day
[1:33:01] so we are under the influence of the
[1:33:04] pillar of fire now amen I love this
[1:33:06] because the product God said I believe
[1:33:08] amen that the message of the hour amen
[1:33:10] is what will fool around the second
[1:33:12] coming of Christ somebody somebody told
[1:33:14] me one time they sit now uh there are
[1:33:16] certain things in the message it's not
[1:33:18] really scriptural you can't prove it by
[1:33:19] scripture so you know me I just ask him
[1:33:21] well well give me one you know and they
[1:33:23] said well I count their 1933 the Ohio
[1:33:26] River a light come down that's not
[1:33:28] scriptural I said well it's not
[1:33:30] scriptural to you but it actually is
[1:33:32] scriptural they said well give me a
[1:33:33] scripture well look in Deuteronomy 4 36
[1:33:35] Out of Heaven he made you hear his voice
[1:33:38] that he might instruct thee and upon the
[1:33:40] Earth he showed thee his great fire and
[1:33:43] thou heardst his words out of the midst
[1:33:46] of the fire amen I don't know what more
[1:33:48] but Terry describes what happened on the
[1:33:50] Ohio River than that verse right there
[1:33:52] when the prophet said Out of Heaven came
[1:33:54] alive which was identified as the pillar
[1:33:57] of fire amen and how about Pillar of
[1:33:59] Fire there were some words spoken and
[1:34:01] here were the words as John the Baptist
[1:34:04] was sent to Forum the first coming of
[1:34:06] Christ amen your message will forerun
[1:34:08] the second coming of Christ he said
[1:34:10] that's what the angel of the Lord said
[1:34:12] amen now the message he said and I
[1:34:15] believe that I have the message of the
[1:34:17] day that is the light of the day is
[1:34:19] pointing to the time coming amen I
[1:34:22] believe the message he said down there
[1:34:24] is the message that you have listen amen
[1:34:27] if you won't argue with it if you won't
[1:34:29] tamper with it if you won't question it
[1:34:31] if you'll receive it and believe it that
[1:34:34] message will become a token to you it'll
[1:34:36] become a provision for you it'll become
[1:34:39] a signal it'll become a sign it'll
[1:34:41] become an end sign it'll become a
[1:34:43] protection for you and you'll stay under
[1:34:45] that message it'll influence your
[1:34:46] destination you say influence my
[1:34:48] destination well what about Rahab the
[1:34:50] Harlot Joshua's second chapter amen you
[1:34:53] can read about it but in Hebrews 11 31
[1:34:55] Paul says amen by faith the Harlot Rahab
[1:34:58] perish not with him that believe not not
[1:35:01] when she had received the spies with
[1:35:04] peace amen the protagon said Rahab was a
[1:35:06] believer in Gentile he said believe in
[1:35:09] Gentile Harlot a
[1:35:11] and he was a Believer he's he had heard
[1:35:13] the wrath of God they had heard of the
[1:35:15] display and signs the Miracles of God
[1:35:17] among his people but they had to receive
[1:35:19] it see she had to receive God's destroy
[1:35:22] an angel was coming they knew it and
[1:35:24] Joshua was the angel they were in line
[1:35:27] he said that little old Harlot had heard
[1:35:29] amen and all the country was disturbed
[1:35:32] about Joshua he said now watch Rahab
[1:35:35] honor those spies and how did she honor
[1:35:37] them she said I want to live everything
[1:35:41] was in the line of Destruction but Rahab
[1:35:44] confessed I want to live amen and
[1:35:46] Jericho heard what God was doing he said
[1:35:48] the same as denomination but
[1:35:51] makes a warning see amen and we're
[1:35:53] living in the age the same time when God
[1:35:55] has manifesting himself and they refuse
[1:35:58] to take God's provided way of Escape he
[1:36:00] said now what happened they were all
[1:36:02] shut up see but there must have been
[1:36:04] some tape boys that slipped in somewhere
[1:36:07] for the predestinated seed they slipped
[1:36:10] over to her house and played some tapes
[1:36:12] now watch she made her own house a
[1:36:15] church she made her house a church to
[1:36:18] receive the message listen friends the
[1:36:21] message was spoken that day on the river
[1:36:23] amen but when it's spoken it's got to be
[1:36:25] received and Rahab prepared her home to
[1:36:29] receive a message of Deliverance in a
[1:36:32] time of Destruction listen I believe
[1:36:34] Church Living God Amen that we're on the
[1:36:36] verge of Destruction amen and when
[1:36:38] destruction set in rahab's house was not
[1:36:42] touched but remember said why because
[1:36:44] God himself recognized his messenger's
[1:36:47] message
[1:36:49] Oh Glory to God he said God himself
[1:36:52] recognized his messenger's message he
[1:36:55] said then what happens see they could
[1:36:57] read the scriptures while the battle was
[1:37:00] going on while the war was going on they
[1:37:02] were not looking out for Windows that
[1:37:04] they were not seeing what was happening
[1:37:05] they were in their house reading the
[1:37:08] scriptures and feeding on the message
[1:37:10] because they were under the influence of
[1:37:13] a message that said you will not be
[1:37:14] destroyed amen but you will leave here
[1:37:17] your family will leave here everything
[1:37:19] under the token will be spared oh come
[1:37:22] on sir you might as well wake up have
[1:37:24] churches Sunday night amen and here we
[1:37:26] are in the last days and the world has
[1:37:28] fallen apart but there's a bride who is
[1:37:31] under the influence of a message from
[1:37:33] the above world and she's feeding on
[1:37:35] things listen Russia's hollering the
[1:37:37] bomb is built California is going under
[1:37:40] nations are breaking Israel's Awakening
[1:37:42] she's in her Homeland but there's a
[1:37:44] bride on the earth tonight who has come
[1:37:46] under the influence of a token from the
[1:37:49] above world and when destruction sets in
[1:37:52] she will not be a part of it she will be
[1:37:54] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[1:37:57] of an eye the old will become young
[1:37:58] mortal will become immortal corruption
[1:38:01] will put on incorruption and death will
[1:38:03] be swallow up in Victory listen friends
[1:38:05] let me say this as plain as I know how
[1:38:07] them tapes are not for token
[1:38:10] them tapes are not the token but the
[1:38:13] token is on the tapes
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:21] so if you come under the influence of
[1:38:23] the tapes you will come under the
[1:38:25] influence of the word that's being
[1:38:27] preached the token listen I know there

[1:39:05] everybody's got to see an angel feel an
[1:39:06] angel bump into an angel and I believe
[1:39:08] in those things but don't you forget the
[1:39:11] fact that a prophet said amen the angel
[1:39:13] of the Lord accompanies the message
[1:39:15] always amen wherever the message of the
[1:39:19] hour is being preached brother Matthew
[1:39:20] the angel of the Lord is there somebody
[1:39:23] said well I didn't see him that don't
[1:39:24] mean he's not here amen if you're
[1:39:26] preaching the message he's here because
[1:39:29] he cannot go on anywhere without the
[1:39:31] message and the message cannot be
[1:39:33] anywhere without him because he and the
[1:39:36] message are one listen friends if this

[1:40:00] in a grave in Jeffersonville he's not in
[1:40:02] the mountains of Tucson he's not buried

[1:40:07] that's in that picture is whirling
[1:40:09] through this building right now by the
[1:40:12] preaching of the message of the hour
[1:40:13] what are you saying I'm saying if we'll
[1:40:16] preach this message it'll bring an
[1:40:17] influence from heaven in the church and
[1:40:20] it'll silence evil communication and it
[1:40:22] will awake a righteousness in the church
[1:40:24] Living God as the devil cannot put out
[1:40:27] with all of his demons and all of his
[1:40:29] hymns they will never stop the influence
[1:40:31] of this word
[1:40:32] somebody shot Glory hallelujah amen he's
[1:40:35] with his message won't we give him a
[1:40:37] hand clap of praise the angel of the
[1:40:40] Lord is with the message
[1:40:43] and if the angel brother Kevin of the
[1:40:46] Lord is with the message he's with you

[1:41:03] never leave you nor will I forsake you
[1:41:04] I'll be with you always even till the
[1:41:07] end and here we are at the end and
[1:41:09] there's many walking away but hang on
[1:41:11] little bride there's a fool there's a
[1:41:14] full influence of the body changing
[1:41:16] power coming in this age
[1:41:19] what are you saying I'm seeing God's
[1:41:21] always with this message he was with it
[1:41:23] when the prophet was preaching it and he
[1:41:25] was with it when the church was
[1:41:26] listening to it in their homes
[1:41:28] now you may prove it to you Jamaica he
[1:41:30] said they got a little six volt battery
[1:41:32] recorder took it down there in the
[1:41:34] Jamaica land so they were listening to
[1:41:35] tapes on them Seven Seals He said Out of
[1:41:38] Heaven oh God I love how you always
[1:41:40] identifies It Out of Heaven he said a
[1:41:43] lot come in the room

[1:41:48] light come in the room he said when the
[1:41:50] light come in there he said it went over
[1:41:51] there and hung over the tape recorder no
[1:41:54] offense it didn't hang over Billy
[1:41:56] Graham's books no offense it didn't hang
[1:41:58] over oral Robert's videos no offense it
[1:42:01] didn't follow Dr Dobson it didn't back
[1:42:03] up smiley face in Texas it didn't
[1:42:05] accompany TD Jake's but this message has
[1:42:08] come from the angel itself so the angel
[1:42:11] has to identify that he's with it he
[1:42:13] said and it's the same one that was in
[1:42:16] the picture hung over the tape recorder
[1:42:18] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:42:20] have we forgot where the change comes in
[1:42:23] a service have we forgot amen where when
[1:42:25] the atmosphere gets right and the Holy
[1:42:28] Ghost starts moving and you start
[1:42:29] feeling something changing have we
[1:42:31] forgot where it comes from it don't come
[1:42:33] from the preacher it don't come from the
[1:42:35] gifted preacher it don't come from a man
[1:42:37] it comes from the influence of the Angel
[1:42:40] that's in the building you say there's
[1:42:42] an influence right here on a Sunday
[1:42:44] night about the hour don't know what
[1:42:46] time it is amen about 606 on a Sunday
[1:42:49] night even in the angels of God are in
[1:42:51] this building
[1:42:53] can I can I get two or three witnesses
[1:42:55] that believe that the angels of God is
[1:42:58] in this building I love what the Bible
[1:42:59] says this poor man cried and the Lord
[1:43:03] heard him and saved him out of all of
[1:43:05] his troubles for the angel of the Lord a
[1:43:09] camp in campus about them that fear him
[1:43:11] and delivereth him oh taste and see that
[1:43:15] the Lord is good and blessed is the man
[1:43:17] that trusteth in him
[1:43:20] are you ready for this God is always
[1:43:23] present
[1:43:24] the angels of the Lord are copy about
[1:43:27] those who fear Him are you ready for
[1:43:29] this he says in this building tonight
[1:43:31] stands Jesus Christ in this building
[1:43:35] tonight stands Jesus Christ in this
[1:43:38] building tonight brother Judah he says
[1:43:40] is a host of angels He says thousands of
[1:43:42] them gathered around you don't see them
[1:43:45] you don't see them but you feel the
[1:43:48] influence of them amen telling you
[1:43:50] they're here you don't see the Angels
[1:43:52] amen you don't describe them amen you
[1:43:55] come on church with her here and you
[1:43:57] feel the influence of them then what are
[1:43:59] those angels doing as you're hearing the
[1:44:01] word those angels are bringing a power
[1:44:04] into you and that power is shaping you
[1:44:06] it's shaping your confession it's
[1:44:08] shaping your testimony it's shaping your
[1:44:11] body old church and living God I say let
[1:44:13] the angel do the preaching again if the
[1:44:16] angel do the influence again if we'll
[1:44:18] just give room for the angel of God
[1:44:19] he'll change a negative confession to a
[1:44:21] positive he'll change an empty heart to
[1:44:23] a field because he still has the power
[1:44:26] to influence human beings by his
[1:44:28] presence in a meeting yes sir some of
[1:44:31] y'all sitting there and you're saying
[1:44:32] with Andrew I don't feel like crazy in

[1:44:49] say preacher you're getting far out
[1:44:50] there I do not believe in the worship of
[1:44:52] angels but I do believe in the ministry
[1:44:55] of angels and I believe there's Angels
[1:44:57] right here in this bill come on there
[1:44:59] was an angel that met Elie Easter and
[1:45:01] led him to Rebecca and the problem of
[1:45:03] God said you know why Rebecca believed
[1:45:05] he said because when she heard Ellie
[1:45:07] Easter's message he said there was an
[1:45:09] angel hanging over her that persuaded
[1:45:12] her to believe what she was hearing was
[1:45:14] the truth did you know how that Hattie
[1:45:16] ride got her two boys back it's because
[1:45:19] the same angel that was on the river
[1:45:21] that was in the cave that was in the
[1:45:23] woods was in the house of the rights and
[1:45:25] when she began to hear the word she
[1:45:28] began to say that's nothing but for
[1:45:29] truth and an angel influenced her to
[1:45:32] believe real Church Living God if an
[1:45:34] angel could be influence Hattie if an
[1:45:37] angel can influence Rebecca then I
[1:45:39] believe an angel can influence will I
[1:45:41] believe an angel can influence Tim I
[1:45:42] believe an angel can influence Shema
[1:45:44] because we're not a different believer
[1:45:46] we are the same Believers in the same
[1:45:48] word and it will just let the angel
[1:45:50] influence us

[1:48:33] saying I'm saying this if something in
[1:48:35] the word can make you realize can I can
[1:48:37] I preach this quote if something in the
[1:48:40] word can make you realize you are free
[1:48:43] by his grace or if something realized
[1:48:45] and the word makes you understand or
[1:48:48] some Act of God that it included you it
[1:48:51] includes us all then you just accepted
[1:48:53] on those bases you're free

[1:49:08] hear the promise that Satan is a bluff
[1:49:10] every disease is defeated every sickness
[1:49:13] is healed when you hear that word come
[1:49:16] on Church you got a right to act upon
[1:49:18] the word that you heard what amen I'm
[1:49:20] gonna preach on in a few days amen what
[1:49:23] are you saying preacher I'm saying amen
[1:49:25] the miracle takes place on the word
[1:49:27] direct quote the miracle takes place on
[1:49:30] the word so when you hear the word you
[1:49:33] recognize the word and you act upon the
[1:49:35] word I've often wondered brother Bill
[1:49:37] when a brother and preach if God be with
[1:49:39] us then we'll be all his miracles I've
[1:49:41] always wondered why the prophet took
[1:49:43] time to say it's time to go into action
[1:49:45] but then I heard another day he said the
[1:49:48] action is to act upon his word in other
[1:49:51] words you know God in other words you
[1:49:53] hear his word and you act upon his word
[1:49:55] like this amen we singed all night we
[1:49:58] fished all night and every time we let
[1:50:00] down our net we pulled it back up empty
[1:50:02] every time we let it down we pulled it
[1:50:04] back up empty so what did Jesus say he
[1:50:06] said at that word he said lay down the
[1:50:09] net again are you hearing me amen the
[1:50:11] action was oh God the action was the
[1:50:14] word amen and they let down the net was
[1:50:16] the action and the Miracle took place on
[1:50:19] the word when they pulled the net back
[1:50:21] up it like they broke the oars amen
[1:50:23] because the net was full of fears are
[1:50:25] you hearing me church when we prove it
[1:50:26] let me give you another example amen the
[1:50:28] woman with just a little bit of oil and
[1:50:30] a little bit of meal in a barrel amen
[1:50:32] the Act was give it all to a prophet
[1:50:34] amen and the Word was this day the meal
[1:50:37] will never run empty and the oil will
[1:50:39] never run by or you hearing me the
[1:50:41] miracle takes place on the word well
[1:50:43] that same word is in this building
[1:50:46] tonight and if I can present it to you
[1:50:48] in such a way by the word and you can
[1:50:50] see that you're free you can realize
[1:50:52] you're free he said you don't have to
[1:50:54] feel anything at all different he said
[1:50:56] no sir if you believe it then take the
[1:50:58] two-edged sword and cut every Promise
[1:51:01] free because God is going to have
[1:51:03] somebody that's going to believe every
[1:51:06] promise of God's word regardless of how
[1:51:09] they feel oh I remember I remember one
[1:51:11] time y'all heard the quote remember so
[1:51:13] when you got the purchase and power he
[1:51:15] said you don't have to wait till you get
[1:51:16] the bread he said you can go ahead and
[1:51:18] dance a little jig that's actually a
[1:51:20] direct quote he said you can go
[1:51:22] and you can dance a little jig when you
[1:51:25] hear you got the purchase in power there
[1:51:27] was a brother down in Tennessee one day
[1:51:28] he heard that quote had leukemia in his
[1:51:31] body eating up his body he was down with
[1:51:33] leukemia he heard that quote across the
[1:51:35] pulpit you know what he did I've never
[1:51:37] seen that man dancing all my life I
[1:51:40] never seen him move but brother Sean he
[1:51:41] jumped out and he started dancing and
[1:51:43] shouting
[1:51:45] um
[1:51:46] I'm just going to say this amen I don't
[1:51:48] know what happened to spontaneous praise
[1:51:50] but I think it needs to come back
[1:51:53] well glory to God you say what are you
[1:51:56] getting at I'm saying God ain't looking
[1:51:58] for your fancy footwork he ain't looking
[1:52:00] for how well you can dance or some other
[1:52:02] day they said oh I would dance if I had
[1:52:04] some good footwork I thought dear God
[1:52:05] have we gone back to Pentecostalism or
[1:52:08] we got to practice our shout and get all
[1:52:10] of our footwork amen I want to say this
[1:52:12] God wants to see somebody praise him he
[1:52:15] don't care if he got pretty footwork or
[1:52:16] ugly footwork he just wants somebody who
[1:52:19] will act upon the word of God and that
[1:52:21] man began to shout and dance and he went
[1:52:23] to the doctor the next day and the
[1:52:25] leukemia was completely gone out of his
[1:52:27] body listen he didn't have a report he
[1:52:30] didn't have a CT scan he didn't have a
[1:52:32] blood test but he had the word and he
[1:52:34] believed the word and he received the
[1:52:36] word and the Miracle took place on the
[1:52:38] word what are you saying I'm saying amen
[1:52:41] that this body is flesh and it's under
[1:52:43] the influence of death but there is a
[1:52:45] soul in there that is under the
[1:52:47] influence of a theophany which is an
[1:52:49] eternal life and outside of that we have
[1:52:51] no hope
[1:52:53] outside of that we have no hope but if a
[1:52:56] breath of fresh air somebody say fresh
[1:52:58] air we'll come into our hearts amen by
[1:53:01] that baptism of the Holy Ghost we'll
[1:53:03] hear from our theophany right Paul to
[1:53:06] gosh when you heard the word for your
[1:53:07] age it was Eagle food he said you left
[1:53:10] the other thing you heard from your
[1:53:12] theophany amen I'm gonna set you like
[1:53:15] this amen we right here tonight and I'm
[1:53:17] going to close you on this we're right
[1:53:18] here tonight have come back under
[1:53:20] prophetic utterance we are back under
[1:53:23] prophetic utterance but let me say it
[1:53:25] like this we're not back under prophetic
[1:53:27] utterance of uh I feel I think I sense I
[1:53:30] feel I see uh somebody in here no we're
[1:53:33] under Vindicated prophetic utterance
[1:53:36] we're under word prophetic utterance
[1:53:38] listen here in the Book of Ezekiel 37
[1:53:40] and verse 1. amen the hand of the Lord
[1:53:43] was upon me and he carried me out in the
[1:53:45] spirit of the Lord and set me down the
[1:53:47] midst of the valley which was full of
[1:53:48] Bones and caused me to pass by them
[1:53:50] round about and behold there were very
[1:53:52] many in the open Valley and lo they were
[1:53:54] very dry I preached that church before
[1:53:56] Lo they were very dry
[1:53:59] a bunch of dry bones you know amen and
[1:54:01] he said unto me son of man can these
[1:54:05] bones live and I answered O Lord God
[1:54:07] thou knowest and again he said unto me
[1:54:09] feel upon these bones
[1:54:12] sense upon these bones oh I think he
[1:54:16] said prophesy upon these bones and say
[1:54:18] unto them oh you dry bones hear the word
[1:54:21] of the Lord what was the action the
[1:54:23] action was prophesied and the Miracle
[1:54:26] took place on the word of the Lord can I
[1:54:28] can I tell you what this word prophesy
[1:54:29] means it's under the influence of a
[1:54:32] Divine spirit so in other words what the
[1:54:34] spirit is telling him is you bring them
[1:54:37] dry bones under the influence of a
[1:54:39] Divine Spirit let's set the Lord God in
[1:54:41] these bones behold I will cause breath
[1:54:43] to enter into you and ye shall live I
[1:54:45] will they send you upon you I will bring
[1:54:47] flesh upon you I will cover you with
[1:54:49] skin put them breath in you and ye shall
[1:54:51] live and ye shall know that I am the
[1:54:53] Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded
[1:54:56] and as I prophesied there was a quiet
[1:54:59] little bit of a little bit of noise that
[1:55:01] you could hear
[1:55:02] there was a noise and beholders shaken
[1:55:05] and the bones come together bone to his
[1:55:08] bone amen and when I beheld low sin you
[1:55:11] and flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[1:55:13] covered them above but there was no
[1:55:15] breath in them Church there was no
[1:55:17] breath right there is three stages of a

[1:55:24] there was bone back to Bone amen but
[1:55:26] there was no life there was no breath in

[1:55:34] the wind thus saith the Lord God come
[1:55:36] from the Four Winds old breath and
[1:55:38] breathe upon the slain that they may
[1:55:41] live so I prophesied old church I could

[1:55:45] through justification through
[1:55:46] sanctification through the baptism of
[1:55:49] the Holy Ghost amen before was not
[1:55:51] enough in that Pentecostal age to put
[1:55:53] the life of God back in these dry bones
[1:55:55] but in the end time the bride will come
[1:55:58] out of a Pentecostal age into a bright
[1:56:01] age by the voice of the seventh angel
[1:56:03] she will come under prophetic utterance
[1:56:05] she will come into the influence of a
[1:56:08] Divine spirit and it will put her in
[1:56:10] position to receive rapturing Faith oh I
[1:56:13] prophesied as he commanded and the
[1:56:15] breath came into them and they lived and
[1:56:17] stood upon their feet amen and exceeding
[1:56:19] great Army then he said unto me son of
[1:56:21] man can these uh these bones of the
[1:56:23] whole house of Israel behold they say
[1:56:25] our bones are dried our hope is lost we
[1:56:27] are cut off of our parts therefore

[2:30:08] amen and I tell you I believe that God
[2:30:12] is still real he's still moving
[2:30:15] and the Devil is a defeated foe
[2:30:19] you believe that
[2:30:21] the devil's a defeated fall and I tell
[2:30:24] you just to recognize that the Lord is
[2:30:27] here with us and
[2:30:29] God send that prophet he Vindicated that
[2:30:33] gift
[2:30:35] and we know beyond a shot of a doubt
[2:30:38] that the angel of the Lord according to
[2:30:41] Revelations 10 1.
[2:30:43] is here with us never laughed with the
[2:30:47] prophet that he's here with the bride
[2:30:49] Jesus Christ
[2:30:51] and we're so thankful for that and
[2:30:57] um
[2:30:59] the
[2:31:02] just received a
[2:31:06] text that brother Jewel fournies in need
[2:31:10] of prayer
[2:31:11] he had a stroke this afternoon after
[2:31:14] this service and he's going in for
[2:31:18] surgery now there's a blood clot on the
[2:31:21] brain
[2:31:22] and
[2:31:24] [Music]
[2:31:25] that God can dissolve blood clots
[2:31:30] and
[2:31:32] I I really love brother Jewell
[2:31:36] he's labored very hard preaching the
[2:31:38] gospel to the bride of Christ
[2:31:42] and he has stood with this message when
[2:31:46] even his closest friends have walked
[2:31:48] away
[2:31:48] [Music]
[2:31:50] he was offered you know
[2:31:55] when things went down there in North
[2:31:57] Carolina
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:00] Pastor who was a beloved friend of his
[2:32:03] and
[2:32:05] let him
[2:32:06] to the Lord into this message
[2:32:14] then the pastor left the message and you
[2:32:18] all know the story but he offered
[2:32:21] brother Jewel a lot of money
[2:32:23] stay with him and I'll take care of
[2:32:25] every need you got and just stay with me
[2:32:28] and
[2:32:31] I know for for an evangelist and
[2:32:35] all that that stuff you know the the
[2:32:37] church was supporting brother Jewel
[2:32:41] financially
[2:32:43] helping him and things like that and so
[2:32:46] I'm sure the devil tempted him in that
[2:32:50] that manner
[2:32:51] uh you know just to
[2:32:55] to walk away from the message and accept
[2:32:57] all of this but brother Jewel he loved
[2:33:00] the message
[2:33:02] and he walked away from all his finances
[2:33:05] walked away from all of that to
[2:33:08] to walk with God and Satan has fought
[2:33:11] him in his body
[2:33:13] in
[2:33:14] many instances throughout the years
[2:33:17] since and the brother Joel has remained
[2:33:21] trying to Pastor trying to help God's
[2:33:23] people and I I think we ought to
[2:33:27] remember him in our prayer and so maybe
[2:33:31] we could just just bow our heads
[2:33:35] okay John's going to stand there and
[2:33:40] annoying brother John and
[2:33:43] I I just believe God will hear our
[2:33:47] prayer if God can give new lungs
[2:33:51] amen just God can restore our brother
[2:33:54] and
[2:33:55] and uh
[2:33:57] take that blood clot out of that brain
[2:34:00] and renew our brother so let's pray
[2:34:03] father
[2:34:05] God
[2:34:09] we we love brother Jewel
[2:34:11] [Music]
[2:34:13] his ministry has influenced Our Lives
[2:34:16] in many ways Lord
[2:34:19] even though we haven't heard him
[2:34:21] preached in a long time and we hadn't
[2:34:23] maybe talked with him but our hearts are
[2:34:26] still with him Lord

[2:36:38] people a lot and
[2:36:42] uh by sitting there

[2:36:48] me as as to why I really believe that
[2:36:52] Satan is fighting you young peoples
[2:36:53] because he knows that you've got the
[2:36:55] gift
[2:36:57] you got the gift to drive him away
[2:37:00] he knows that he's going to do
[2:37:02] everything he can
[2:37:04] build complexes in your mind
[2:37:07] you're worthless that you're no good
[2:37:10] that you ain't got nothing to offer
[2:37:13] and God doesn't love you but you just
[2:37:15] remember
[2:37:16] a man that is through you
[2:37:19] your gift your talent
[2:37:21] yielding to the Lord
[2:37:23] you're going to drive him away
[2:37:25] drive him away from the people of God
[2:37:27] that's what the prophet said now music
[2:37:30] and singing song is used to drive
[2:37:33] Spirits away
[2:37:35] amen so you just remember that and
[2:37:38] that's why Satan fights you so hard
[2:37:41] amen but you will overcome
[2:37:44] amen just yield yourself to the Lord and
[2:37:47] I I really appreciated what brother
[2:37:49] Andrew is saying get under that
[2:37:50] influence of this message amen remember
[2:37:54] influences a man and
[2:37:57] you know brother Brown preaching on the
[2:37:59] invasion of the United States
[2:38:01] and Satan has found all this technology
[2:38:05] to invade your mind to invade the homes
[2:38:08] to invade these things
[2:38:10] and uh you know we
[2:38:14] not everything is prudent on these cell
[2:38:16] phones not every app is is is of a
[2:38:22] benefit to you and I I know we've got
[2:38:25] all kinds of you know apps where you
[2:38:28] take pictures of yourself and send them
[2:38:30] out and and you know you just all kinds
[2:38:33] of stuff people taking pictures of you
[2:38:36] know what food they're eating and then
[2:38:37] they send it out and
[2:38:39] a lot of that is your senseless stuff
[2:38:42] and it's it's really it's just Satan
[2:38:46] trying to get avert your attention away
[2:38:47] from everything else that God's got for
[2:38:50] you
[2:38:50] and uh you know it makes you just so
[2:38:53] carnal and and uh so come under the
[2:38:58] right influence
[2:38:59] come under the right influence and even
[2:39:02] though there they might seem harmless
[2:39:04] and innocent it's it's whatever's taking
[2:39:07] you away from the message of the hour
[2:39:09] and and bringing you to where you're
[2:39:12] more acceptable to to discouragement
[2:39:15] you're more susceptible to his he's the
[2:39:17] one that puts these thoughts of
[2:39:19] negativity in your mind and if you're
[2:39:22] not feeding up on the word then you
[2:39:25] become susceptible to it to where you
[2:39:27] start believing that and you start
[2:39:29] entertaining them thoughts and so God
[2:39:32] help us all to get away from all that
[2:39:34] and and just feed upon the word of God
[2:39:37] I uh you know and so anyways God bless
[2:39:41] you we love you appreciate you you want
[2:39:44] to keep brother Andrew in prayer
