[46:16] are you grateful for the message of the
[46:18] hour
[46:19] if not we'd be still stumbling in
[46:21] confusion amen well if you have your
[46:24] bibles let's turn to john 16 and 12.
[46:28] it's an honor to be standing here
[46:29] appreciate the opportunity to be
[46:31] speaking this morning this is like a
[46:33] second home and most of you all know
[46:35] i've spent apart two or three months of
[46:38] my life here so
[46:40] seems like every time that uh i'd be
[46:42] going through circumstances or trials as
[46:45] a young man always had a place here that
[46:47] i can just escape and recoup my mind you
[46:50] know so i always appreciate uncle sean
[46:53] and what he's done for me as a young man
[46:55] growing up you'll have a great pastor
[46:57] here if y'all don't know that you ought
[46:59] to know that
[47:01] john 16 and 12 i have yet many things to
[47:04] say unto you but you cannot bear them
[47:06] now how be it when he the spirit of
[47:09] truth has come he will guide you into
[47:11] all truth for he shall not speak of
[47:14] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[47:16] that shall he speak and he will show you
[47:18] things to come
[47:20] can we bow our heads this morning
[47:22] dear heavenly father lord it's an honor
[47:24] and a privilege to be standing before
[47:26] your people this morning god as i've
[47:28] prepared lord for this morning i ask
[47:30] that you would anoint me help me to get
[47:32] myself out of the way lord
[47:34] lord just anoint this vessel god
[47:36] bring back to remembrance lord things
[47:38] i've listened lord and in your message
[47:40] god are things i've studied on father
[47:43] lord just lead me this morning anoint
[47:44] the hearers father as the word come
[47:46] forth i ask that they would reach up and
[47:48] accept their blessing father we ask
[47:50] these things in your precious name amen
[47:53] you may be seated
[47:55] my subject this morning or my title
[47:56] would be the spirit of truth these are
[47:59] some things that i've been studying on
[48:00] for myself
[48:02] for the last month or so so i pray it
[48:04] can all come together and and make sense
[48:07] you know that's when i want to start off
[48:09] by saying i'm thankful for a prophet he
[48:11] came in this last day with the mind of
[48:13] god not just to give his opinions not
[48:15] just to give his ideas but he came with
[48:17] a message to bring us a revelation of
[48:20] all the mysteries that were sealed up in
[48:22] the book and you know in this scripture
[48:24] here sort of having me puzzled for you
[48:26] shall not speak of himself but
[48:28] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[48:31] speak and that sort of had me puzzled
[48:33] and i was wondering what did that mean
[48:35] you know and so brother branham
[48:37] speaks on the scripture in a guide he
[48:39] says now in this 13th verse how be it
[48:42] when he the spirit of truth has come he
[48:44] will guide you into all truth when the
[48:46] spirit of truth is come he will guide
[48:48] you into all truth what is truth he says
[48:51] the word for he shall not speak of him
[48:53] he shall not speak of himself but what
[48:55] he hears he'll speak and he says it
[48:58] again what he hears he'll speak in other
[49:00] words he'll be the one that will reveal
[49:03] the thing and that just made sense and
[49:06] what i got out of that is you know we
[49:08] hear many say that or some say that the
[49:11] the spirit of truth is to divide the
[49:13] message and pick out truth and what this
[49:15] here meant to me is brother branham says
[49:17] he's not going to come to you and give
[49:19] you the revelation of the seals like he
[49:21] did with the branham he's not going to
[49:22] come and speak of himself but what he
[49:24] hears a prophet's going to come on the
[49:27] scene with the message with the
[49:29] revelation and the spirit of truth
[49:31] that's on the inside is going to hear it
[49:33] then he's going to reveal it and that
[49:35] just spoke to me saying wow the spirit
[49:38] of truth of this bride is under can look
[49:40] at this message and say it's thus saith
[49:43] the lord i may not understand it but
[49:45] there's something on the inside that is
[49:47] drawing me to this message something on
[49:50] the inside that's drawing me to this
[49:52] word you see human intellect can never
[49:54] understand the things of god never
[49:56] understand this message never understand
[49:58] scriptures they've been trying for years
[50:01] for centuries to try to understand
[50:03] scripture that's why there's the trinity
[50:05] doctrine there's the the baptism's off
[50:07] this is off that is off they're trying
[50:10] to understand scripture in human
[50:12] intellect but we don't got to try to
[50:14] understand scripture in our own
[50:16] intellect we can come under the spirit
[50:18] of truth and look at a vindicated
[50:21] message not some idea not some opinion
[50:24] but we got a message that was from the
[50:26] throne room of god to bring all the
[50:28] loose sins together brother branham says
[50:30] this message is the tie all the loose
[50:32] ends together he says now watch there
[50:35] was a lot of truth lost out there my why
[50:38] they were picking out what they thought
[50:39] was right what this one thought was
[50:41] right and they lost a lot of truth but
[50:44] he says there's a lot of truth lost out
[50:46] there why others when others compromised
[50:48] on truth but this seventh angel don't
[50:51] compromise on nothing and i'm so glad
[50:54] that we had a man of god a prophet that
[50:56] wasn't worried about being popular
[50:59] wasn't worried about fitting in but he
[51:02] wanted to bring a message to this bride
[51:04] so that she can understand her place her
[51:08] day in scripture in march he still
[51:11] continuing going on the skin this quote
[51:12] the seventh angel don't compromise on
[51:15] nothing he gathers up all the loose ends
[51:18] gathers them up oh my gathers them up be
[51:21] grateful for the message but you can't
[51:23] have truth without having the spirit of
[51:25] truth and you can't have the spirit of
[51:28] truth without having truth they tie
[51:30] together and produce an invincible army
[51:33] you look at john 4 and 24 god is a
[51:36] spirit and they that worship him must
[51:39] worship him in spirit and in truth he
[51:42] didn't leave no wiggle room jesus didn't
[51:44] say if you feel like it worship in
[51:46] spirit and truth he didn't say if if you
[51:49] think it's right he says you must
[51:52] there's no wiggle room you've got to
[51:53] have the spirit of truth and the word
[51:56] you've got to have the word there's many
[51:58] that wants to take the spirit but push
[52:00] away the word or have the word and push
[52:03] away the spirit but there's a middle
[52:05] road spirit and truth is what's going to
[52:08] produce a rapture what's going to
[52:10] produce your body change what's going to
[52:12] produce a future home oh you look at
[52:15] second corinthians 3 and 6 who also hath
[52:18] made us able ministers of the new
[52:20] testament not of the letter but of the
[52:22] spirit the letter killeth but the spirit
[52:25] giveth life the letter ain't going to
[52:27] have nothing to produce with unless the
[52:29] spirit's there then the spirit can pick
[52:32] up the message and produce it inside of
[52:34] your life
[52:36] oh my jesus said you gotta worship in
[52:39] spirit and in truth and that's what's
[52:40] making this message live if not you're
[52:43] gonna go right back to denominations go
[52:45] right back to man's ideas man's opinions
[52:48] brother branham says here we are at the
[52:50] end time red light down flashing coming
[52:53] of the lord as that hand yes sir listen
[52:55] the end time message shall meet end time
[52:58] conditions where they got off the
[53:00] message ought to bring it back oh i'm so
[53:03] glad that we're not stuck in
[53:05] denominational ideas but where they left
[53:07] off where luther fell off well once they
[53:10] fell off we had a message to bring what
[53:12] wesley's truth hat what this one's truth
[53:14] had and bring forth the fullness of the
[53:18] word so that there can be a bride march
[53:20] over theology merch over man-made ideas
[53:23] merciful opinions and i'd stand with
[53:26] truth
[53:27] well the message ought to bring back
[53:29] always end time message meets end time
[53:31] conditions all the way through scripture
[53:34] you'll have to do it this time a call
[53:36] back to the original word oh my like
[53:39] other messengers did in that day this
[53:41] message will have to be the same we
[53:43] promised that god promised it back in
[53:46] his word malachi 4 said it would happen
[53:49] restore the faith of the children back
[53:52] to the fathers promised it and we're
[53:54] living in that day oh it's been always
[53:56] each time a group of leaders that gets
[53:59] the people all mixed up it's not so much
[54:01] the people it's the leaders that gets
[54:03] them mixed up this message didn't come
[54:07] to put you into confusion
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:16] but there has to be a people under the
[54:17] spirit of truth that can point and say
[54:20] no that's a lie no that's deception no
[54:23] that's not right if it's not coming back
[54:25] to scripture it's not right
[54:28] it's the leaders brother branham says
[54:30] it's this one it's that one but there's
[54:31] got to be a people that's under the
[54:34] spirit of truth that can say this is
[54:36] truth this message
[54:38] is truth while others fall while this
[54:41] one's falling away i'm standing on truth
[54:45] you see where they got off to the church
[54:47] ages this message is to bring back
[54:49] brother branham says they're probed have
[54:51] the word throughout the church ages and
[54:53] that's why it got all mixed up but this
[54:55] message is to bring the fullness of the
[54:57] word back to us but this only comes the
[54:59] understanding of this only comes by the
[55:02] holy ghost he didn't say i'm going to
[55:04] send some holy men and they're gonna
[55:05] make seminaries he says i'm gonna send
[55:07] the spirit of truth he didn't say i'm
[55:10] gonna give you some intellect where you
[55:12] can understand the scriptures he says
[55:14] i'm gonna give you the spirit of truth
[55:16] he promised to send a guide he promised
[55:19] to send something to lead us brother
[55:21] branham says jesus first doctrine was
[55:24] she must be born again and he says if
[55:26] there's 900 denominations there's going
[55:28] to be 900 different meanings of what
[55:31] that means he says there's one meaning
[55:33] you must be born again it's an
[55:35] experience he says some say you gotta
[55:38] quote a creed or some say you gotta
[55:40] belong to church to be born again he
[55:42] says no it's an experience and that's
[55:44] where many people is missing is the
[55:47] experience of the baptism of the holy
[55:49] ghost that's why they're putting their
[55:51] own ideas to the message they're putting
[55:53] their own opinions to the message if
[55:56] they can't understand it they're trying
[55:57] to bring it together with their human
[56:00] intellect but the spirit of truth is to
[56:02] guide you into all truth no matter how
[56:05] smart you are how intelligent you are
[56:08] you'll never be able to understand
[56:10] scriptures it's always been the smart
[56:12] ones that explain away the bible that
[56:15] explain away a god explain away this why
[56:18] they can't comprehend it with this human
[56:21] mind it's gotta be by the spirit of
[56:24] truth guiding us
[56:26] amen brother branham says in the
[56:27] scriptures it's of no private
[56:29] interpretation it was wrote by the holy
[56:31] spirit and the holy spirit is the only
[56:34] one who can reveal it from it is hid
[56:37] from the eyes of the wise and the
[56:38] prudent and revealed to babes such as
[56:41] will lord so if you don't watch if you
[56:44] don't use the mind of the holy spirit to
[56:46] put it together you have your scene all
[56:49] mixed up
[56:50] he says for instance like a cow picking
[56:52] grass in the top of a tree that's just
[56:55] about the way it looks that's what man's
[56:58] theology looks like without the spirit
[57:00] of truth
[57:02] a cow on top of a tree eating grass it's
[57:04] impossible for that to happen just like
[57:07] it's impossible for there to be three
[57:09] gods just like it's impossible for you
[57:12] to be sprinkled just like it's
[57:14] impossible for this and for that without
[57:16] the spirit of truth your theology is
[57:19] going to get it all mixed up and the
[57:21] same thing is happening in the message
[57:23] oh you don't have to have the holy ghost
[57:25] anymore we don't need an experience
[57:27] anymore what the theology is doing is
[57:30] putting a cow up in a tree eating grass
[57:32] but there's a pride that's under the
[57:35] spirit of truth not with man's theology
[57:37] but with thus say of the lord with the
[57:40] message that is coming right back to
[57:42] scripture that is properly vindicated
[57:45] for this last day
[57:47] oh my
[57:49] hallelujah this message will always go
[57:51] right back to scriptures the scripture
[57:53] was wrote by the holy spirit and the
[57:56] only way it's going to be revealed is by
[57:58] the holy ghost brother branham says
[58:00] without the holy ghost you can't put the
[58:02] pieces together he says it's like
[58:04] it's like a jigsaw puzzle and without
[58:06] the spirit of truth you can't put the
[58:08] pieces together have you ever put a
[58:10] puzzle together and you have a piece
[58:13] that you think goes here it looks right
[58:15] and you're cramming it in there cramming
[58:17] it in there you're putting a plate a
[58:19] piece that don't belong there but it
[58:21] belongs over there
[58:23] oh man that's what happens with men's
[58:25] theology without the holy ghost they're
[58:28] trying to cram a piece that don't belong
[58:30] there but stick with this message all of
[58:33] the pieces will come together and
[58:36] produce an invincible army produce a
[58:38] rapture stick with this message
[58:42] oh there's only one way to understand
[58:44] scriptures that's through the holy ghost
[58:46] john 14 and 15 if you love me keep my
[58:49] commandments and i will pray the father
[58:51] and he shall give you another comforter
[58:53] that he may abide with you forever he
[58:56] says even the spirit of truth whom the
[58:58] world cannot receive because that saith
[59:01] him not neither knoweth him but ye know
[59:04] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[59:07] be in you i will not leave you
[59:09] comfortless i will come to you he says
[59:12] if you love me keep my commandments but
[59:15] he knew this was going to be impossible
[59:17] to keep the scriptures to understand the
[59:19] scriptures so he stops and he says i'm
[59:22] going to give you a guide
[59:24] i'm going to give you the spirit of
[59:26] truth so that you can make scriptures
[59:29] live but the world can't receive it
[59:31] because they don't know what it is
[59:34] they think an emotion is the holy ghost
[59:37] come on somebody they're in confusion
[59:39] but we had a message that says speaking
[59:42] in tongues it's a holy ghost it's an
[59:44] experience that's why we needed a
[59:47] message so that the spirit of truth can
[59:49] come inside of this bride so that we can
[59:52] recognize the day we're living according
[59:54] to this message
[59:56] oh my in your own ability you can't keep
[59:59] my words you can't keep my commandments
[1:00:02] but i'm going to send the guide and i'm
[1:00:03] so glad that we've got a guide in this
[1:00:06] last day and the holy ghost will never
[1:00:08] leave you astray from the word it always
[1:00:11] comes right back to the word brother
[1:00:13] branham says the holy ghost is your
[1:00:15] compass and the word is the north star
[1:00:18] the holy ghost can only point to that
[1:00:20] north star and if your wonder a guide
[1:00:23] that's pointing somewhere other than
[1:00:25] scripture you're under the wrong died
[1:00:28] but if you're under the spirit of truth
[1:00:30] and it's pointing back to scripture you
[1:00:32] can stand assured that you're under the
[1:00:35] spirit of truth and there's no deception
[1:00:38] that can get your mind there's no ideas
[1:00:41] that can get your mind but just stick
[1:00:43] with the spirit of truth
[1:00:45] oh hallelujah
[1:00:47] you say
[1:00:48] if we have the holy ghost then why do we
[1:00:50] need a prophet
[1:00:52] this is the point
[1:00:54] many people use hopelessness okay uncle
[1:00:55] sean this is the point many people use
[1:00:58] to disregard the message
[1:01:00] we got the spirit of truth
[1:01:02] so we don't need a prophet
[1:01:05] the spirit of truth is to divide the
[1:01:07] message and pick out truth that's not
[1:01:10] the way jesus said it would be he says
[1:01:12] he's going to guide you
[1:01:15] he's not going to pick out truth for you
[1:01:17] he's going to guide you in truth
[1:01:21] oh they've got their chain all mixed up
[1:01:23] they got a cow up in a tree eating grass
[1:01:26] the holy ghost need to divide the
[1:01:28] message the holy ghost is to be guided
[1:01:30] you into the message so that you can see
[1:01:33] the day that you're living in we have
[1:01:36] too many people with a head knowledge
[1:01:38] and missing the spirit of truth we
[1:01:40] needed a message because we needed
[1:01:42] something to tie the loose ends together
[1:01:44] the holy ghost ain't going to come to
[1:01:45] you like i said earlier and give you a
[1:01:47] mouth sunset experience where you're
[1:01:49] called up by seven angels and he's going
[1:01:51] to give you the revelation no he gave a
[1:01:53] prophet a revelation and you're to see
[1:01:56] this message and not argue with this
[1:01:58] message not put your own ideas to this
[1:02:01] message not put your interpretations to
[1:02:04] this message but be led and guided into
[1:02:07] this message by the spirit of truth
[1:02:11] oh you see the two go hand in hand
[1:02:13] you've got to have the truth and you've
[1:02:15] got to have spirit of truth hope this is
[1:02:18] all making sense this morning
[1:02:20] oh they're they're there's big-name
[1:02:22] preachers i used to be big-name
[1:02:24] preachers in the message let's start to
[1:02:26] divide the message from the bible
[1:02:29] and what that does is takes you back to
[1:02:31] confusion
[1:02:33] claiming to be under the spirit of truth
[1:02:36] and start to divide the message from the
[1:02:38] bible you can't divide the message from
[1:02:40] the bible the message didn't do away
[1:02:43] with the bible it came with an
[1:02:45] interpretation of the bible why did we
[1:02:48] need a message because man's ideas got
[1:02:51] the bible all twisted up
[1:02:54] oh
[1:02:56] my feet didn't need a prophet the water
[1:02:58] baptism who was ripe to be to be
[1:03:00] sprinkled with or if we didn't need a
[1:03:02] prophet the trinity's right but god gave
[1:03:05] us a prophet to bring us back to the
[1:03:09] original not for you to argue with
[1:03:12] not for you to put your own opinions
[1:03:14] with but he gave you a message to be led
[1:03:17] into
[1:03:19] oh hallelujah
[1:03:21] i hope this is okay they say the message
[1:03:24] in my absolute the bible's my absolute
[1:03:27] oh this is okay the message ain't my
[1:03:30] absolute the bible's my absolute how can
[1:03:33] you understand bible without message
[1:03:37] so the bible is not your absolute your
[1:03:39] opinions of the bible is your absolute
[1:03:43] your ideas of this bible is your
[1:03:46] absolute but we are the prophet with the
[1:03:48] divine interpretation of scriptures so
[1:03:51] that you don't go to go back to man's
[1:03:53] ideas this message came to do away with
[1:03:57] man's interpretations do away with man's
[1:04:00] idea and give us an original
[1:04:03] hallelujah that's what malachi 4 came to
[1:04:06] do to give god's interpretation not
[1:04:09] man's
[1:04:10] interpretation man's interpretation is
[1:04:13] why we're all confused in the first
[1:04:15] place but god's interpretation brought
[1:04:18] us out of confusion
[1:04:20] it's now their responsibility to correct
[1:04:23] the prophet
[1:04:24] it's now their responsibility to find
[1:04:27] the line between brother branham's human
[1:04:30] side and the spiritual side
[1:04:32] hope this is okay this morning the devil
[1:04:34] knows if you go back to confusion you're
[1:04:37] just worse off like the denominations
[1:04:40] are
[1:04:41] once you start to separate it all you're
[1:04:44] doing is looking for flaws
[1:04:46] the devil's always going to give you
[1:04:48] flaws always going to give you reasons
[1:04:50] to leave this message but god gives you
[1:04:53] a reason he vindicated this message by
[1:04:56] the purifier by his spirit many times
[1:05:00] it's been vindicated so this bride can
[1:05:03] look and say this is the message i'm to
[1:05:06] be
[1:05:06] under oh and it's a trick of the devil
[1:05:10] to drive a wedge between the scriptures
[1:05:12] and the interpretation of scriptures
[1:05:16] you look at revelations revelations is a
[1:05:19] book of symbols
[1:05:20] how can you understand it without an
[1:05:22] interpretation of it
[1:05:25] you see this message and the bible come
[1:05:28] together
[1:05:30] hope this is making sense this morning
[1:05:32] it's coming together and they look they
[1:05:34] look for the mistakes and the devil is
[1:05:37] always going to give you mistakes
[1:05:38] remember what happened with moses the
[1:05:40] dathans and the chorus rose up and
[1:05:43] started to divide
[1:05:45] moses's message from the scripture
[1:05:47] you're not the only holy man that god
[1:05:50] speaks to god speaks to us too
[1:05:53] and they started to divide the what
[1:05:55] happened there was many that fell away
[1:05:57] what happened to the men and women that
[1:05:59] was with nathan and corey
[1:06:01] after they went into confusion the earth
[1:06:03] swallowed them up
[1:06:05] the world swallowed them up
[1:06:08] what happens oh what happens whenever
[1:06:11] confusion sets in the world's gonna try
[1:06:13] to grab you
[1:06:15] you look at some of these that left a
[1:06:17] message their daughters are lesbians
[1:06:19] they're now drinking beer their wives
[1:06:21] are wearing pants and cutting their hair
[1:06:23] confusion is going to lead you straight
[1:06:26] to the world but a vindicated message
[1:06:28] will lead you straight to a rapture
[1:06:31] straight to a body change straight to
[1:06:33] your future home don't go to man's ideas
[1:06:36] of this message stick with the save the
[1:06:39] lord stick with the vindicated prophets
[1:06:43] oh
[1:06:44] hallelujah most of this message did them
[1:06:47] no good if there was no one to believe
[1:06:49] it
[1:06:50] somebody had to believe that message in
[1:06:54] order to go into the promised land
[1:06:57] somebody's got to believe this message
[1:06:59] though everyone's fallen away there was
[1:07:01] a joshua and caleb that the same message
[1:07:04] oh my
[1:07:06] the same message that they were doubting
[1:07:08] brought joshua and caleb out of
[1:07:10] confusion

[1:07:15] this day that this one's doubting this

[1:07:21] wilderness i'm in my promised land and
[1:07:24] dwelling with my inheritance oh in this

[1:08:02] message i'm gonna stay with the
[1:08:04] vindicated prophet
[1:08:07] hallelujah
[1:08:09] you see the thing of that back back in
[1:08:11] that day they couldn't look past the
[1:08:13] veil of flesh
[1:08:15] they couldn't look past the flesh and
[1:08:17] see a message that moses had
[1:08:21] oh hallelujah what's happening today
[1:08:24] hope this is okay they can't look past
[1:08:26] the flesh
[1:08:28] and see a message
[1:08:32] oh but the brandon made human mistakes
[1:08:34] but the brandon had false moses killed a
[1:08:36] man
[1:08:38] but that message that moses brought
[1:08:40] wasn't from a human intellect it was
[1:08:43] from the throne room of god
[1:08:45] and the message that malachi before
[1:08:48] brought through william miriam branham
[1:08:50] was in his intellect it was from the
[1:08:53] throne room of gods
[1:08:56] oh how come they killed jeremiah they
[1:08:58] killed isaiah they killed the great
[1:09:00] prophets they couldn't look past the
[1:09:03] veil of flesh
[1:09:04] and the same thing today they're trying
[1:09:06] to kill brother brown but the brandon
[1:09:08] says you don't got to stab a man in the
[1:09:10] back to kill him you can kill his
[1:09:12] influence and what are they trying to do
[1:09:14] come on somebody trying to kill the
[1:09:17] influence of the message on your life
[1:09:21] but there's somebody that's under the
[1:09:24] spirit of truth that's not being bound
[1:09:26] to the influence of this world their
[1:09:29] wonder another influence the spirit of
[1:09:32] truth is guiding you away from confusion
[1:09:35] and into a message
[1:09:38] oh come on somebody this message has
[1:09:41] brought us out of confusion
[1:09:43] [Applause]
[1:09:45] ii peter 1 and 20 knowing this that no
[1:09:48] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:09:50] private interpretation for the prophecy
[1:09:53] came not an old time i like this not in
[1:09:56] old time by the will of man
[1:10:00] hey he didn't come by the will of man
[1:10:02] scripture says but by holy men of god
[1:10:06] spake as they were moved by the holy
[1:10:09] ghost
[1:10:11] what's the absolute they're saying the
[1:10:13] bible not the message
[1:10:16] how did the bible come about
[1:10:19] flawed human beings
[1:10:22] flawed human beings
[1:10:24] they're absolute
[1:10:26] come on somebody but it wasn't a flawed
[1:10:29] human beings intellect it was the spirit
[1:10:32] of truth
[1:10:34] that anointed them to bring forth an
[1:10:37] absolute the bible is my absolute that's
[1:10:39] why i can say this message is my
[1:10:42] absolute
[1:10:43] and the same spirit that anointed
[1:10:45] jeremiah anointed david anointed solomon
[1:10:49] anointed jeremiah anointed joe malachi
[1:10:52] all of these ones is the same spirit
[1:10:55] that anointed malachi 4 william miriam
[1:10:58] branham to bring forth a message
[1:11:01] he anointed another flawed human being
[1:11:05] to bring forth the interpretation of
[1:11:08] truth
[1:11:10] oh
[1:11:10] just like mary was a flawed human being
[1:11:13] but she was anointed to take truth and
[1:11:16] produce it there's a bride on earth
[1:11:18] that's a flawed human being but she's
[1:11:20] anointed by the spirit of truth and is
[1:11:23] picking up truth and making it live
[1:11:27] god as an electric group a predestinated
[1:11:30] bride to come under this message and
[1:11:32] defeat theology defeat man's ideas and
[1:11:36] one day we're going to defy gravity and
[1:11:38] defeat death defeat the grave defeat
[1:11:41] hell and step out of this earthly
[1:11:44] dimension into a body change how come
[1:11:47] brother josh the spirit of truth and
[1:11:49] truth is doing something through this
[1:11:52] body and i'm going to defy the odds and
[1:11:54] step in my body change are you going
[1:11:57] with me this morning
[1:11:58] if you want to stick with this message
[1:12:02] don't look to this one's idea this one's
[1:12:05] theology stick with the vindicated
[1:12:08] prophet
[1:12:09] oh
[1:12:10] hallelujah
[1:12:12] somebody's got to believe it
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:16] somebody's got to believe it
[1:12:18] brother branham says now we're in the
[1:12:20] evening time and the messengers down to
[1:12:23] the age we find out that at the
[1:12:25] beginning when a messenger was sent to
[1:12:28] misconstrue his word or to doubt one
[1:12:32] word
[1:12:33] one word
[1:12:34] to doubt one word was a total
[1:12:37] annihilation and eternal separation from
[1:12:40] god
[1:12:41] to misconstrue that messenger's word the
[1:12:44] first messenger was god himself
[1:12:49] so i
[1:12:51] if god the first messenger was god
[1:12:54] himself
[1:12:55] and adam and eve and eve still uh took
[1:12:58] the devil's interpretation over god's
[1:13:01] word
[1:13:02] i don't think it's human flaws
[1:13:04] that's causing meaning to walk away from
[1:13:06] this message
[1:13:08] it's the same devil that spoke to eve to
[1:13:12] have her disbelief god's word
[1:13:16] god didn't come through a flawed human
[1:13:18] being in the beginning god himself came
[1:13:22] oh
[1:13:22] come on somebody
[1:13:24] well what happens is the devil is
[1:13:26] getting people to think they're so
[1:13:27] spiritual that they know more than the
[1:13:29] prophet but in reality it's the same
[1:13:32] devil that spoke to eve is speaking lies
[1:13:35] in this last day
[1:13:37] oh but there's a bride that's not under
[1:13:39] the serpents that are under the devil's
[1:13:41] lie but it's under the spirit of truth
[1:13:44] brother branham says the second eve
[1:13:46] ain't like the first eve we're not bound
[1:13:48] off all we're bound to rise how come
[1:13:51] we've had a message in this last day
[1:13:54] and the spirit of truth is making it
[1:13:56] live
[1:13:58] and the first messenger was god himself
[1:14:01] and every other messenger has been god
[1:14:04] speaking through man
[1:14:07] oh since which is god's word for there's
[1:14:10] no man then for him to speak through but
[1:14:13] just the one he's talking to
[1:14:16] there's only one man
[1:14:18] god's going to speak through that's the
[1:14:20] prophet
[1:14:22] there's not holy men that's to correct
[1:14:24] the prophet and want to follow their
[1:14:26] theology there's one man
[1:14:29] god's going to speak through that's a
[1:14:31] vindicated prophet
[1:14:33] oh hallelujah
[1:14:36] but the brandon says in another quote we
[1:14:38] are now ready for battle the trumpet is
[1:14:40] the sound the hymns have been sung now
[1:14:43] comes the word i think as i stand here
[1:14:45] yes you probably do but to hear these
[1:14:48] comments of these young soldiers here
[1:14:50] and myself getting old and listening and
[1:14:52] listening around your faith and
[1:14:54] confidence that you've placed to believe
[1:14:57] this message
[1:14:58] that god has been that god has given now
[1:15:01] if it wasn't for you all this message
[1:15:04] would do no good
[1:15:07] it says if there wasn't for you to
[1:15:08] believe this message he would do no good
[1:15:11] he said see it's got to be built
[1:15:13] somebody to believe it
[1:15:16] why do you think the devil's coming and
[1:15:18] trying to get you to doubt this message
[1:15:22] if somebody ain't going to believe it
[1:15:24] it's not going to do no good
[1:15:26] oh but the devil may try he may send
[1:15:29] theology but there's a bride under the
[1:15:31] spirit of truth
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:34] hold on he says as long as it's coming
[1:15:36] from god there's going to be somebody
[1:15:39] believe it and i believe this message
[1:15:41] came from god and i'm going to be the
[1:15:44] somebody that's going to believe it
[1:15:47] he's just he says you see god has made a
[1:15:49] way he have fixed this great economy
[1:15:52] so when he sends for something there's
[1:15:54] going to be something meet that
[1:15:56] something the deep response to the call
[1:15:59] of the deep
[1:16:01] what does brother branham say in the
[1:16:03] church age book he says the devil knows
[1:16:06] he can't make you one of his children
[1:16:07] paraphrasing he says he knows he can't
[1:16:10] make you one of his but what he does is
[1:16:12] to discredit the word in your life
[1:16:16] what does that happen that's putting
[1:16:18] question marks in your mind and
[1:16:21] concerning this message
[1:16:23] he knows you're not his seed he knows
[1:16:26] you're not one of his but if he can get
[1:16:28] you to disbelieve this message
[1:16:32] oh you see what the devil's trying to do
[1:16:34] he's trying to take you right back to
[1:16:37] confusion right back to the wilderness
[1:16:40] brother branham says the children of
[1:16:42] israel was only right there on the
[1:16:44] border of the promised land they were
[1:16:46] right there but because of disbelief
[1:16:49] they wandered around in confusion
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:16:52] and what happened they wanted to go back
[1:16:55] where they came from
[1:16:57] they said let us make us a captain
[1:17:00] what was the captain a captain was what
[1:17:03] beat their backs in egypt
[1:17:06] come on somebody it was a captain that
[1:17:08] kept them in bondage and because of
[1:17:10] confusion that theology wanted to take
[1:17:14] them back to where they came from
[1:17:17] but sean you came out of pentecost you
[1:17:19] came out of manmade ideas why would you
[1:17:21] want to go back to that captain
[1:17:24] oh why would we want to go back to that
[1:17:26] cabin when we're on the verge of a
[1:17:29] rapture a verge of our body change the
[1:17:32] verge of my future hope i've walked
[1:17:35] through the red sea i've watched by the
[1:17:38] egyptians be defeated why would i want
[1:17:41] to go back i'm going to stick with the
[1:17:44] message
[1:17:46] this may be a boat statement but i
[1:17:48] believe anything outside of this message
[1:17:50] is confusion
[1:17:53] anything outside of this message is
[1:17:55] confusion and whenever you separate the
[1:17:58] message from the bible you're starting
[1:18:00] to denominate
[1:18:03] oh hallelujah you're starting to
[1:18:05] denominate how come what happened with
[1:18:08] wesley's then wesley's day they took a
[1:18:10] portion of truth and pushed the rest
[1:18:12] away
[1:18:14] brother branham says the baptists have a
[1:18:16] portion of truth
[1:18:18] this one has a portion of truth but
[1:18:20] they're pushing the rest away whenever
[1:18:23] you start to separate the message from
[1:18:25] the bible you're taking a portion of
[1:18:27] truth and pushing the rest away
[1:18:30] which is making a denomination
[1:18:33] then when that happens you're no longer
[1:18:35] in the message because brother branham
[1:18:37] says this message will never denominate
[1:18:40] there's somebody that's not putting
[1:18:42] their own ideas but sticking with the
[1:18:44] pure unadulterated word of god
[1:18:49] oh
[1:18:50] hallelujah
[1:18:51] hope this is okay brother branham says
[1:18:54] she with their own interpretation they
[1:18:56] couldn't do nothing else because they
[1:18:58] leaned to what their church i told them
[1:19:00] he always comes then he did rather he
[1:19:03] would heal every time he comes
[1:19:05] everything he does it'll be a taste of
[1:19:07] the word so therefore we can't put
[1:19:10] confidence in what other people say
[1:19:12] there's only one thing you can put your
[1:19:14] confidence in and that's the word
[1:19:17] and the word is god and the anointed
[1:19:20] makes the messiah the anointed word of
[1:19:22] the hour how beautiful they missed it
[1:19:25] the word the word is always right but
[1:19:28] their interpretation is always wrong
[1:19:33] that's not that the bible's wrong but
[1:19:35] the baptist interpretation of scripture
[1:19:38] is wrong
[1:19:39] the methodist interpretation of
[1:19:41] scripture is wrong it's not it's not
[1:19:44] that the message is wrong man's
[1:19:47] interpretation
[1:19:48] of this message is wrong
[1:19:51] we've seen uh somebody sent us the
[1:19:53] website back home of a group in texas
[1:19:56] saying that brother branham was lord
[1:19:58] he's jesus christ
[1:20:00] someone's gonna see that and say man
[1:20:02] that message is wrong they're occult no
[1:20:05] the message ain't wrong that man's
[1:20:06] interpretation is wrong
[1:20:09] oh stick with the prophet stick with the
[1:20:12] message and you'll never have to be
[1:20:15] going back to man's ideas brother
[1:20:17] branham says god he don't eject anything
[1:20:20] into all
[1:20:21] he says when a man is born of the spirit
[1:20:24] of god he don't inject anything into his
[1:20:27] life it's the unadulterated word of god
[1:20:30] vindicated for this hour
[1:20:34] oh
[1:20:35] my this message is pretty important when
[1:20:38] a man is born of the spirit of truth he
[1:20:41] puts inside of his life the vindicated
[1:20:44] word for this hour
[1:20:47] oh there's a bride that's making this
[1:20:50] word live
[1:20:53] he takes the full word of god he don't
[1:20:55] put no creeds nothing else into it it's
[1:20:58] purely unadulterated god's word made
[1:21:01] manifest
[1:21:02] among us made manifest
[1:21:06] the word hasn't been made manifested
[1:21:08] until this last day
[1:21:10] because it was all uh misconstrued it
[1:21:12] was all mixed up so there was no power
[1:21:14] to make the world live
[1:21:16] oh but there's a bride just like when
[1:21:18] jesus was on earth making scripture live
[1:21:21] why did he say to the scribes and
[1:21:22] pharisees search the scriptures for they
[1:21:25] testify of me brother branham says that
[1:21:27] jesus life vindicated who he was because
[1:21:31] of scripture
[1:21:33] this message is vindicated because the
[1:21:36] scripture this pride is vindicated
[1:21:40] because of scripture and now the word is
[1:21:43] walking on earth once again
[1:21:47] oh
[1:21:48] my goodness you missed jesus christ how
[1:21:50] come this word has brought christ down
[1:21:54] the appearing brother random says the
[1:21:55] appearing and the coming of christ is
[1:21:58] two different things we've got the
[1:21:59] appearing in word form the message has
[1:22:03] brought christ and one day if you stick
[1:22:05] with this message we'll see the coming
[1:22:08] oh
[1:22:09] my there's going to be some missing
[1:22:11] they're not going to see the rapture but
[1:22:13] there's a bride that's going to see it
[1:22:15] because they're sticking with the
[1:22:17] appearing
[1:22:18] of jesus christ
[1:22:20] oh
[1:22:21] hallelujah
[1:22:23] hallelujah
[1:22:24] and brother branham says remember
[1:22:27] he is a true prophet of god hope it's
[1:22:29] okay to read quotes this morning
[1:22:31] who the word comes to he can't do
[1:22:33] nothing else but go back to the words
[1:22:36] a prophet can do nothing else but go
[1:22:39] back to the word
[1:22:42] there's many accusing brother branham
[1:22:44] that his teachings was off
[1:22:47] so bless saying he's a false prophet
[1:22:49] because the prophet can't do nothing but
[1:22:51] go back to the words
[1:22:53] no matter if all the pentecostals in the
[1:22:55] country gather around him and say sir
[1:22:58] amos we believe you to be a prophet but
[1:23:00] you're off the word we want to
[1:23:02] straighten you up he would stay with the
[1:23:04] word there's nothing else he can go to
[1:23:06] he could go to because he's a prophet he
[1:23:09] didn't need the cooperation oh
[1:23:12] he didn't need the
[1:23:14] cooperation he's got a message to give
[1:23:18] all the father has given me will come to
[1:23:21] me he's going to preach the word he's
[1:23:23] going to preach it just like would be in
[1:23:25] the bible
[1:23:28] you catch that the prophet is going to
[1:23:30] preach his message just like it's in the
[1:23:33] bible how come it's in the bible
[1:23:36] he's preaching a message with conviction
[1:23:38] just like he would be preaching the
[1:23:40] bible because the message came out of
[1:23:42] the bible
[1:23:44] hallelujah
[1:23:45] just like would be in the bible
[1:23:46] therefore we'll turn him down that's
[1:23:48] right no matter what it would be the
[1:23:50] word of god comes to the prophets their
[1:23:53] interpretation catch this part we'll
[1:23:55] read it again no matter what would be
[1:23:58] the word of god comes to the prophets
[1:24:00] their interpretation of the word is the
[1:24:03] right interpretation
[1:24:06] oh no need to put your ideas to it the
[1:24:09] prophet's interpretation is the right
[1:24:12] interpretation
[1:24:13] but brother branham says the way of a
[1:24:15] true prophet is always despised
[1:24:18] people can never look past the veil of
[1:24:19] flesh never look past
[1:24:21] his mistakes and see the message that he
[1:24:24] didn't bring with his intellect but a
[1:24:26] message that god gave and many to many
[1:24:28] times people is making themselves the
[1:24:31] interpreter of the message we don't need
[1:24:34] an interpreter of the message we got an
[1:24:36] interpretation and brother branham says
[1:24:39] have you have you ever thought how great
[1:24:41] this is what could you give in exchange
[1:24:44] in this day of confusion says this day
[1:24:47] when the people don't know what to do
[1:24:49] which way to go the bible says these
[1:24:51] days would come and there would be a
[1:24:53] famine in the land not for bread not for
[1:24:55] water but for the hearing of the true
[1:24:58] word of god
[1:25:00] i like how he says that the true word of
[1:25:02] god not a man's idea of the word of god
[1:25:06] but the true word of god and the people
[1:25:09] would go from east to west north to
[1:25:11] south seeking to hear the true word of
[1:25:15] god
[1:25:17] they're seeking for something they're
[1:25:19] looking for something it's already here
[1:25:22] brother branham says and here we are
[1:25:23] privileged tonight to see the message
[1:25:27] he says they're going from north to
[1:25:29] south he's the west seeking for the true
[1:25:31] word of god and he says you're
[1:25:33] privileged to see the true word of god
[1:25:35] how come this message has brought forth
[1:25:38] the true word of god
[1:25:41] oh the world is looking for something
[1:25:43] genuine
[1:25:44] people in this message is looking for
[1:25:47] something but it's already here remember
[1:25:49] when the scribes and the pharisees asked
[1:25:51] jesus for a sign they were looking for a
[1:25:53] vindication they asked give us a sign
[1:25:56] and what did jesus say he says a wicked
[1:25:58] and adulterous generation seeks after a
[1:26:01] sign
[1:26:02] he didn't say nothing about the elect
[1:26:06] peter had already seen the word
[1:26:09] come on somebody the the elective that
[1:26:11] day had already seen the words
[1:26:14] vindicated they didn't need a sign they
[1:26:17] stopped looking they found something
[1:26:20] come on somebody the unbelievers were
[1:26:22] still looking for something and failed
[1:26:25] to see what they were looking for was in
[1:26:27] their midst
[1:26:29] oh and let the people in the message
[1:26:31] turn away they're still looking for
[1:26:33] something but i found what i was looking
[1:26:36] for malachi 4 came on the scene i'm no
[1:26:39] long i'm no longer looking for the
[1:26:41] bride's revival it's here in action i'm
[1:26:44] not looking i'm not looking for the
[1:26:45] manifestation of the third pole it's
[1:26:48] already here i'm not looking for an
[1:26:50] adoption message it's already here
[1:26:53] stop looking and enjoy the fulfillment
[1:26:57] come on somebody we need to stop looking
[1:27:00] and enjoy it
[1:27:01] if i was looking for my hanky but i
[1:27:03] thought it was in the office and it's
[1:27:05] right here i'm gonna push that away and
[1:27:07] go around here looking for something
[1:27:09] that's right here
[1:27:11] when you're looking for something you're
[1:27:13] pushing it off in the future because
[1:27:15] it's not here in a present tense form
[1:27:18] and whenever you're looking for
[1:27:19] something to come you're going to miss
[1:27:21] out what's already here
[1:27:24] oh hallelujah the scribes and the
[1:27:27] pharisees were pushing it off
[1:27:30] for something to come you can't push it
[1:27:32] off for something to come the message
[1:27:35] has brought it
[1:27:36] the seals have been open
[1:27:38] we don't got to wait for brother branham
[1:27:40] to come back it's already open
[1:27:44] hallelujah
[1:27:46] i hope this is okay this morning
[1:27:48] remember the woman at the whale
[1:27:50] she was looking for the messiah
[1:27:52] she was pushing it off in the future she
[1:27:54] met with christ
[1:27:56] and what does she say when the messiah
[1:27:58] comes he will do these things
[1:28:01] he she was still looking for something
[1:28:04] to come but then spirit and truth came
[1:28:06] together
[1:28:08] oh what did jesus say they that worship
[1:28:10] must worship in spirit and in truth then
[1:28:13] all of a sudden something clicked
[1:28:15] you're him
[1:28:17] she dropped her water pots
[1:28:19] oh i'm gonna i don't know if i said this
[1:28:21] here before but this hit me whenever i
[1:28:23] was studying one time she dropped her
[1:28:25] water pots what was her water pots that
[1:28:27] was her theology whenever jesus said i
[1:28:31] will give you water to drink
[1:28:33] and you will never thirst again what
[1:28:34] does she say she don't got nothing to
[1:28:36] dip with
[1:28:37] she don't got no water pots her water
[1:28:40] pots was her theology
[1:28:42] that's what was keeping her from seeing
[1:28:44] the anointed word
[1:28:47] but one of the bibles say she dropped
[1:28:49] her water parts
[1:28:51] she dropped her theology and ran away
[1:28:55] from her theology with the anointed word
[1:28:58] and said come see a man
[1:29:01] she dropped what was hindering her man's
[1:29:03] interpretation of scripture she dropped
[1:29:06] it and says i'm no longer looking for
[1:29:08] something i found it come see a man and
[1:29:11] that message or the anointed word so
[1:29:13] transformed her life that she was
[1:29:15] completely different but the brandon
[1:29:17] says since her she was ill-famed she
[1:29:19] couldn't even go into the city
[1:29:21] the men of the minimum city wouldn't
[1:29:23] even listen to her but because of the
[1:29:26] anointed word the men looked and said
[1:29:29] something's different about this woman
[1:29:31] the message has so changed our life
[1:29:34] that's made us different than the
[1:29:35] denominations man manis different than
[1:29:38] the creeds and the traditions what is it
[1:29:40] it's the power of god
[1:29:44] we're no longer deceived we've found
[1:29:46] what we're looking for
[1:29:49] we're found what we're looking for the
[1:29:50] woman at the well found what she was
[1:29:52] looking for
[1:29:54] peter found what he was looking for
[1:29:56] these other ones found what they were
[1:29:58] looking for and they stopped searching
[1:30:01] the scribes and the smart ones can keep
[1:30:02] searching if they want to with this
[1:30:04] pride has found what she is looking for
[1:30:07] we're no longer waiting for malachi 4.
[1:30:09] it's here brother branham says they want
[1:30:12] a great awakening they're crying
[1:30:14] believing that there will be awakening
[1:30:16] they're good people why is it what have
[1:30:18] they done they have not recognized the
[1:30:21] awakening of the bride
[1:30:24] they're looking for something to come
[1:30:27] but it's already here say being a
[1:30:30] christian they can feel the pull of the
[1:30:32] hour but they haven't recognized what's
[1:30:34] been done that's why it's making them
[1:30:37] feel that way they know something is
[1:30:38] supposed to happen
[1:30:40] excuse me they know something is
[1:30:42] supposed to happen they're looking for a
[1:30:44] way off in the future to come when it's
[1:30:46] already right here by you
[1:30:49] that was way back then in 64. people
[1:30:52] were looking for something here we are
[1:30:54] in 2022 and they're still looking for
[1:30:57] something
[1:30:58] but this bratty looking
[1:31:00] she's enjoying the fulfillment
[1:31:02] of scripture
[1:31:04] hallelujah we've exchanged our confusion
[1:31:07] for the true interpretation
[1:31:10] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:31:12] malachi 4 is fulfilled
[1:31:14] is that all these things have come to
[1:31:16] pass
[1:31:17] you see so why do we need a prophet if
[1:31:19] we have the spirit of truth
[1:31:21] the bible did a promise to give you oh
[1:31:24] that that that i would do nothing unless
[1:31:27] i first reveal it to my bride by the
[1:31:29] spirit of truth
[1:31:30] he says i do nothing first i revealed to
[1:31:33] my prophets
[1:31:34] he didn't say i'm going to send the
[1:31:36] spirit of truth to the bride and he's
[1:31:38] going to turn the hearts of the children
[1:31:40] to the fathers he says i want to send
[1:31:41] malachi 4.
[1:31:44] come on somebody he didn't say these
[1:31:46] things but he said to send a prophet and
[1:31:49] there's going to be the spirit of truth
[1:31:51] inside of a bride
[1:31:53] recognize the message for this day and
[1:31:56] act upon opponent
[1:31:58] act upon brother branham says where he
[1:32:00] preaches those messages i believe in
[1:32:02] receiving and acting upon hearing
[1:32:04] receiving and acting he says the word
[1:32:06] puts you into action once you hear it
[1:32:09] you receive it then you act upon it
[1:32:11] you're no longer looking for something
[1:32:13] but we're acting upon this message this
[1:32:15] message has produced a powerhouse inside
[1:32:19] of this pride there's now young people
[1:32:21] that can live above adultery live above
[1:32:25] pornography live above drinking and
[1:32:28] alcohol and smoking how come the message
[1:32:31] has brought the full word the full power
[1:32:34] back inside of the bride
[1:32:37] you see it's not all on the prophet
[1:32:39] the prophet's important but this bride's
[1:32:41] important too there's got to be somebody
[1:32:44] under the spirit of truth
[1:32:46] recognize
[1:32:48] hallelujah
[1:32:50] recognize and be led into it
[1:32:54] hallelujah
[1:32:55] i'm going to read this quote hope it's
[1:32:57] okay uncle sean
[1:32:58] and then brother branham says and then i
[1:33:00] heard this the other day when i
[1:33:02] when i sort of got into a little
[1:33:03] discussion with the pastor so that's how
[1:33:05] i've been studying on these things and i
[1:33:07] heard this and it it just made perfect
[1:33:10] sense to me but the brandon says and
[1:33:11] then the next message that opened up the
[1:33:14] seven seals would shut down all the
[1:33:16] hidden mysteries of the bible doctrines
[1:33:19] and so forth which the world so rudely
[1:33:22] attacks now
[1:33:23] they're still attacking it today
[1:33:26] attacks it and says it's wrong this is
[1:33:28] wrong and that here the other day in
[1:33:30] arizona splicing tapes together to make
[1:33:33] me say things that i didn't say just
[1:33:36] remember the vision about arizona
[1:33:38] proposition the bible said it was far
[1:33:41] better for you to have a rock at your
[1:33:42] neck and another thing the whosoever let
[1:33:45] him be a preacher or what he will will
[1:33:48] take one word from it or add one word to
[1:33:51] it
[1:33:52] this scripture was in in the bible
[1:33:54] concerning the scripture if you add or
[1:33:56] take away you're going to get your name
[1:33:58] taken away brother branham is using that
[1:34:00] scripture for this message
[1:34:05] why this message is the bride's absolute
[1:34:08] how come the message and the bible tie
[1:34:10] together
[1:34:12] [Applause]
[1:34:13] hallelujah he's swerving be a preacher
[1:34:16] or what he will will take one word from
[1:34:18] it or add one word to it people putting
[1:34:21] their own interpretation upon the word
[1:34:24] as it's been given trying to make it say
[1:34:27] something i didn't say then he says not
[1:34:30] my word it's his words then he says it
[1:34:33] again you shall add or take away
[1:34:37] this message is important you better not
[1:34:40] be putting your own ideas to it it's not
[1:34:42] brother branham's word it's his word and
[1:34:46] that right there you know i was told
[1:34:47] there's no quotes that says this message
[1:34:50] is the absolute
[1:34:51] and i found this one i said right here
[1:34:53] pretty much explains it to me that this
[1:34:55] message is to be the bride's absolute
[1:34:58] it's not his word it's god's word
[1:35:01] hallelujah
[1:35:04] so whenever you start this helpful this
[1:35:06] is okay when you separate the message
[1:35:08] from the bible you're separating the
[1:35:10] power of scriptures from your life
[1:35:13] separating the interpretation from the
[1:35:16] bible
[1:35:17] and brother branham didn't bring us on
[1:35:18] human intellect like i said but god has
[1:35:21] given a message that has brought the
[1:35:22] true interpretation we're no longer
[1:35:25] bound to man's teachings a man's ideas
[1:35:27] but we're bound to scripture bound to a
[1:35:30] message and one day it's going to go
[1:35:32] right back what did jesus say not one
[1:35:34] word or one of the scriptures saying not
[1:35:36] one word is going to return unto him
[1:35:38] void
[1:35:40] so in other words the word once it
[1:35:42] fulfills what it's to do is going to go
[1:35:44] back to it go back to him
[1:35:47] so if we're tied to the word
[1:35:49] are you catching me now if we're tied to
[1:35:52] the word remember brother branham says
[1:35:53] an absolute is a thai post so if we're
[1:35:55] tied to this word when this word
[1:35:58] fulfills what it's meant to do it's
[1:36:00] going to go back and if we're tied to it
[1:36:02] we're going back with it
[1:36:04] we don't got to be tied to man's ideas
[1:36:07] tied to the word
[1:36:10] hallelujah
[1:36:12] but the brandon says this message from
[1:36:14] scripture interprets to you the hour
[1:36:16] we're living in
[1:36:18] oh my interprets to you the hour we're
[1:36:21] living in brother branham says somebody
[1:36:23] wrote me here not long ago and said
[1:36:24] brother branham i'll tell you we all
[1:36:27] believe you to be a prophet said as long
[1:36:29] as the spirit of the lord's upon you and
[1:36:31] you're discerning the people and things
[1:36:33] like that the discernment we know that's
[1:36:35] a prophet but he says your teaching is
[1:36:37] horrible
[1:36:39] you know what his response was why
[1:36:41] brother you don't even know what a
[1:36:43] prophet means
[1:36:46] we hear the same thing today
[1:36:49] oh he's a prophet of god but when it
[1:36:51] comes to this his teachings off they
[1:36:54] don't even know what a prophet is
[1:36:56] he says why brother you don't even know
[1:36:58] what a prophet means what did the word
[1:37:00] of the lord come to the prophet what
[1:37:03] does the prophet mean it's all it
[1:37:05] doesn't all together mean a foresee or a
[1:37:07] foreteller a prophet means that this is
[1:37:10] given to him to vindicate that he's an
[1:37:13] interpreter of the divine word
[1:37:16] absolutely how can you be so dogmatic
[1:37:20] he says how can you be so dogmatic it
[1:37:22] shows your carnal when you do that
[1:37:26] oh i'm not a carnal one i'm a believer
[1:37:29] that's looking at this message and say i
[1:37:31] know what a prophet is and he's brought
[1:37:34] to me an interpretation
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:38] another quote like like i said i've been
[1:37:40] just putting quotes together and things
[1:37:42] for myself and here's another quote but
[1:37:44] brandon says i saw seven angels come
[1:37:47] didn't a life magazine pack it as the
[1:37:49] fog of it floated across here 27 miles
[1:37:52] high 30 miles across it's not fred
[1:37:55] saltman these others dean norman and
[1:37:57] them sitting back there stood right
[1:37:59] there when them seven angels appeared
[1:38:01] right there on the hill it shook the
[1:38:03] hills from miles around like that there
[1:38:06] stood seven angels thrown a sword in my
[1:38:09] hand and said go home open the seven
[1:38:12] seals that are given
[1:38:14] i mean it may get rocky here but i'm
[1:38:16] going to finish this this is a
[1:38:17] vindicated prophet he says here they are
[1:38:20] the true mystery of marriage and divorce
[1:38:24] the serpent seed and all of these things
[1:38:27] that's been fussed about
[1:38:31] he didn't stop there he says it's thus
[1:38:33] saith the lord
[1:38:36] they're still fussing about it why would
[1:38:38] you want to fuss with us saith the lord
[1:38:42] i may be young and naive but i'm smart
[1:38:44] enough to stick with us saith the lord
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:50] hallelujah why would we want to take
[1:38:52] man's interpretation when we have to say
[1:38:54] of the lord
[1:38:56] moses message was vindicated by the
[1:38:59] pillar of fire which was the spirit of
[1:39:01] truth the scriptures what did the one of
[1:39:04] the the the pillar of fire say to him
[1:39:06] out of the burning bush says i've heard
[1:39:08] the groans in my people the cries of my
[1:39:10] people and i've come to deliver them
[1:39:12] which was a scriptural promise
[1:39:15] so there's three things here there was
[1:39:17] the spirit of truth the holy ghost which
[1:39:19] was the pillar of fire scripture he says
[1:39:22] i've come to deliver my people then he
[1:39:24] gave a message
[1:39:27] which lined up with scripture
[1:39:31] then the spirit of truth vindicated it
[1:39:34] what did we get in this last day the
[1:39:36] spirit of truth the purifier the
[1:39:39] scriptures and we got a message the
[1:39:42] scriptures and the the message tied
[1:39:45] together then the pillar of fire
[1:39:47] vindicates it
[1:39:50] oh
[1:39:50] hallelujah and if they just stuck up
[1:39:53] that message they would have went across
[1:39:54] the red sea like they did they were
[1:39:56] destroyed there was army they would have
[1:39:58] went into the promised land
[1:40:00] but they couldn't stick with the message
[1:40:03] oh hallelujah the same thing today just
[1:40:06] stick with the message
[1:40:09] they might not have seen the promised
[1:40:11] land yet but if they would have stuck
[1:40:12] with the message by revelation there was
[1:40:14] already there they could see it the
[1:40:17] message brought to them their promise
[1:40:19] you look at eliezer message to rebecca
[1:40:22] was isaac
[1:40:23] she hadn't seen isaac yet
[1:40:26] she hadn't seen by a message drawn her
[1:40:29] out
[1:40:30] what about the scripture says that the
[1:40:32] mother and the brother said let her stay
[1:40:35] i believe seven more days i think
[1:40:36] brother branham says the mother
[1:40:39] represents the catholic church and he
[1:40:41] says the brother represents the preacher
[1:40:44] that's trying to get you to stay in
[1:40:46] confusion
[1:40:48] the preacher in the catholic church is
[1:40:50] trying to keep you down but what did
[1:40:52] they say ask her
[1:40:54] she's of age ask her then what did she
[1:40:56] say i'll go with him
[1:40:58] she seen a message that said no the
[1:41:01] roman catholic system has no part of me
[1:41:04] the protestant church has no part in me
[1:41:07] since they're going back to the horse
[1:41:09] system but there's a message that's
[1:41:12] drawing my name
[1:41:14] and she hadn't seen isaac yet but the
[1:41:17] message described eyes a tour
[1:41:20] what's his likes what's his dislikes
[1:41:22] what is he like and that message would
[1:41:24] describe to her what isaac was
[1:41:27] so before she seen isaac with her
[1:41:30] physical eyes she had already seen him
[1:41:32] with the revelation and one day that
[1:41:35] message brought forth isaac in front of
[1:41:37] her physical eyes
[1:41:40] we may not see christ with her physical
[1:41:42] lies but this message has brought forth
[1:41:45] a revelation that we can see christ in
[1:41:48] one day this message is going to bring
[1:41:51] us to christ so that we can see him with
[1:41:54] our physical lies
[1:41:57] remember esther esther out a message

[1:42:14] or
[1:42:15] rebecca was he was already with isaac
[1:42:19] oh a prophet went behind the curtain of
[1:42:22] time
[1:42:24] and came back and said i seen you there
[1:42:27] he was caught up and gave a message
[1:42:29] before he came with the message god had
[1:42:31] already met with him he had already been
[1:42:33] with god
[1:42:34] so he wasn't bringing his own ideas he
[1:42:36] was already there and he came and
[1:42:38] brought forth the
[1:42:40] message oh you look at the eunuch with
[1:42:44] esther
[1:42:45] esther she didn't know she never met the
[1:42:47] king before she didn't know what he
[1:42:49] liked what he what his dislikes were but
[1:42:51] there was somebody that came with the
[1:42:53] message that said i came from the throne
[1:42:55] room of the king i know what he likes
[1:42:58] i know what he wants all of the other
[1:43:01] ones

[1:43:22] hallelujah
[1:43:23] and she just had to stick with the
[1:43:25] message of the you and a cat
[1:43:27] and what happened whenever she got
[1:43:29] before the king the king was wow

[1:43:33] to see them this is one that is
[1:43:36] heartbeat of my heartbeat how come there
[1:43:39] was a message that brought her cry
[1:43:42] brought her the king
[1:43:43] just like our message has brought forth
[1:43:46] us the king and when we step before him
[1:43:49] it's heart of his heart flesh of his
[1:43:51] flesh
[1:43:52] hallelujah
[1:43:54] hope this is okay this morning
[1:43:57] i'm going to try to make one more point
[1:43:59] before i close
[1:44:01] if i can find it here the message i
[1:44:03] believe the message in the bible like
[1:44:04] i've said come together and the spirit
[1:44:07] of truth vindicates it
[1:44:10] amen what happened with mary the man
[1:44:12] when the angel of the lord came to mary
[1:44:15] i'm going to read some scriptures here
[1:44:16] when the angel of the lord came to mary
[1:44:18] that message was always pointing to
[1:44:20] scripture
[1:44:22] so so just follow me this morning you
[1:44:24] look at luke 1 26 this is when the when
[1:44:27] gabriel came to uh to mary in the sixth
[1:44:30] month of the angel gabriel was sent from
[1:44:32] god from god he wasn't he didn't send
[1:44:35] himself but this angel was sent from god
[1:44:38] into the city of galilee named nazareth
[1:44:42] just like we had an angel sent from god
[1:44:45] to laodicea
[1:44:47] but this message didn't come to any mary
[1:44:50] it came to an elected mary
[1:44:53] this message didn't come to anybody it
[1:44:55] came to an elected bride the 27th verse
[1:44:59] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[1:45:01] was joseph of the house of david and the
[1:45:04] virgin's name was mary so let's go to
[1:45:06] zechariah 13 1. in the day there shall
[1:45:09] be a fountain open to the house of david
[1:45:12] to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin
[1:45:15] and for uncleanliness so we see here his
[1:45:17] message is already going back to
[1:45:19] scripture
[1:45:20] back to luke luke 1 28 and the angel
[1:45:23] came unto her and said hell thou art
[1:45:25] high highly favored the lord is with
[1:45:27] thee blessed are thou among women when
[1:45:29] she saw him she was troubled at a saying
[1:45:32] and cast her in mind
[1:45:34] in her mind what matter of salutation
[1:45:36] this should be and the angel said unto
[1:45:38] her fear not mary for thou hast found
[1:45:40] favor with god and behold thou shalt
[1:45:42] conceive in thy womb and bring forth the
[1:45:45] son in his name they call his name jesus
[1:45:48] isaiah 9 and 6 for unto us a child is
[1:45:52] born unto us the son is given the
[1:45:54] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:45:56] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:45:58] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[1:46:00] father the prince of peace isaiah 7 14
[1:46:04] therefore the lord himself shall give
[1:46:07] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:46:10] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:46:12] his name emmanuel you see his message
[1:46:16] and scripture is tying together
[1:46:19] oh look back that luke luke 1 32 and he
[1:46:22] shall be great and shall be called the
[1:46:24] son of the highest and the lord shall
[1:46:25] give unto him the throne of his father
[1:46:28] david isaiah 9 7 of the increase of his
[1:46:31] government and peace shall there be no
[1:46:34] end upon the throne of david
[1:46:37] his message is constantly going back
[1:46:39] luke 1 33 he shall reign over the house
[1:46:42] of jacob forever and his kingdom there
[1:46:45] shall be no end daniel 7 and 14 and
[1:46:48] there was given him dominion and glory
[1:46:50] and the kingdom that all peoples nations
[1:46:53] and sign languages shall serve him his
[1:46:56] dominion is an everlasting dominion back
[1:46:59] to luke 1 34 then said mary unto the
[1:47:01] angel how shall this be seeing that i
[1:47:04] know a man she's saying i have no power
[1:47:07] to make scripture be fulfilled i've got
[1:47:10] no power to make the message produce
[1:47:13] itself the one of the angels say luke 1
[1:47:15] 35 or the angel said unto her the holy
[1:47:18] ghost
[1:47:19] shall come upon you the spirit of truth
[1:47:22] is going to come down and make
[1:47:24] scriptures and the message which are
[1:47:26] together make it live
[1:47:30] the angel answered and said unto her the
[1:47:31] holy ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:47:33] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:47:36] thee therefore also the holy thing which
[1:47:39] is born of thee shall be called the son
[1:47:41] of god
[1:47:43] because the musicians come
[1:47:45] you see there there was three things the
[1:47:47] scriptures the message they tied
[1:47:49] together then the holy ghost which was
[1:47:52] to come upon mary was to overshadow her
[1:47:54] was to bring forth the fulfillment
[1:47:57] and in this last day we've got the
[1:47:59] scriptures and the message which tie
[1:48:01] together
[1:48:02] then the spirit of truth is bringing it
[1:48:04] to life
[1:48:06] and fulfilling what scripture says will
[1:48:08] be fulfilled
[1:48:09] producing an invincible army program and
[1:48:12] it's going to produce a rapture of body
[1:48:14] change
[1:48:17] let's bow our heads this morning can you
[1:48:18] just play something soft
[1:48:21] dear heavenly father
[1:48:23] lord i hope all this came together
[1:48:26] but lord may we leave this place and
[1:48:27] know the importance of this message lord
[1:48:30] not to separate it from the scriptures
[1:48:32] god but it ties together
[1:48:34] and lord one day we're going to step out
[1:48:36] of this dimension
[1:48:38] and step into our body change lord
[1:48:41] i ask that we remain faithful to your
[1:48:43] word father
[1:48:44] may we never go to the left or to the
[1:48:46] right
[1:48:47] to this idea or to this opinion lord but
[1:48:49] may we stick true to the message you've
[1:48:51] given us
[1:48:52] that we ask these things in your
[1:48:54] precious name
