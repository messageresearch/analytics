[45:07] Comfort their hearts in the days to come
[45:10] father we know that you can we know that
[45:14] you will you promised you would father
[45:17] Lord we just ask you in Jesus Christ's
[45:19] name
[45:22] amen the uh Matthew the 20th chapter and
[45:27] we're going to start at the 20th verse
[45:29] again then came to him the mother of
[45:33] zebedee's children with her sons
[45:35] worshiping him and Desiring a certain
[45:37] thing of him and he said unto her What
[45:40] wilt thou she saith unto him grant that
[45:43] these my son two sons May sit the one on
[45:48] thy right hand and the other on the left
[45:50] in thy
[45:51] kingdom but Jesus answered and said you
[45:53] know not what you ask are you able ble
[45:57] to drink of the cup that I shall drink
[45:59] of and be baptized with the baptism that
[46:02] I am baptized
[46:03] with they say unto him we are able and
[46:07] he saith unto them you shall drink
[46:10] indeed of my cup and be baptized with
[46:13] the baptism that I am baptized with but
[46:16] to sit on my right hand and on my left
[46:18] is not mine to give but it shall be
[46:21] given to them for whom it is prepared of
[46:24] my father and when the 10 heard it they
[46:27] were moved with indignation against the
[46:29] two Brethren but Jesus called them unto
[46:32] him and said you know that the princes
[46:35] of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
[46:39] them and they that are great exercise
[46:43] Authority upon them but it shall not be
[46:46] so among you but whosoever will be great
[46:49] among you let him be your
[46:52] minister and whosoever shall be Chief
[46:54] among you let him be your servant even
[46:58] as the son of man came not to be
[47:00] ministered unto but to minister and to
[47:02] give his life a ransom for many amen you
[47:07] can have your seats this morning and
[47:10] then I'm going to read from Philippians
[47:14] 5 and
[47:16] 8-8 uh Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind
[47:21] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[47:24] who being in the form of God thought it
[47:26] not robbery to be equal with God but
[47:29] made himself of no reputation and took
[47:31] upon him the form of a servant and was
[47:34] made in the likeness of men and being
[47:37] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[47:40] himself and became obedient unto death
[47:43] even the death of the
[47:47] cross I want to just continue along the
[47:51] lines of the son of man came to
[47:53] minister and um again to minister
[47:56] minister is to serve
[47:59] others um to wait upon others to supply
[48:04] what is needed to care for right it is
[48:08] um so if we're going to serve if we're
[48:11] going to minister that means we have to
[48:12] have something to
[48:15] give and every minister or every member
[48:19] of the body of Christ it it does not
[48:21] matter who um it does not matter the age
[48:26] uh um we're all called to minister
[48:30] within
[48:32] the um office the place that God has
[48:37] called us and um and we must not forget
[48:41] that whether you're a father your mother
[48:46] even grandfather grandmother whether
[48:48] you're a child whether you're Deacon
[48:51] trustee
[48:53] Minister musician singer song leader
[48:57] whether you're the boss on the job
[49:00] whether you're you know the coworker um
[49:03] employee whatever you
[49:06] are God has called you to
[49:10] minister and and so um there's no one
[49:15] that is exempt I just don't I don't
[49:17] believe
[49:19] that um you don't have to be healthy in
[49:22] good health to be a minister you don't
[49:25] have to uh um you know I so anyways um
[49:31] if we're called to minister then we're
[49:33] called to serve the needs of others and
[49:35] to supply the need we're called to wait
[49:38] upon and to care for
[49:41] others then if that be the case then it
[49:45] requires us to be interested in people
[49:48] we got to be interested in
[49:50] People Ministry must be important it
[49:54] must it must be because Satan
[49:57] always wants to cut us off he always
[50:01] wants to get us isolated from others I
[50:04] mean that's just a a trick of the
[50:07] enemy um is if he gets us isolated and
[50:11] we're serving the lord in our own little
[50:15] little
[50:16] cubicle then what good are
[50:20] we uh but we need one another people
[50:23] need us whether we realize it or not and
[50:27] and he's good at making us feel like
[50:29] we're we're just
[50:31] incapable that that that yeah we are of
[50:35] no value that we have no use
[50:39] so why should we even try but that's not
[50:43] true we've got a Ministry if we're part
[50:46] of the body of Christ we're called to
[50:48] minister so you have to uh be interested
[50:52] in people in this this kind of interest
[50:55] uh that I'm speaking of requires us to
[50:57] have a burden for
[50:59] souls and someone asked brother brandom
[51:03] what his main objective in life was and
[51:05] he replied back I have only one
[51:08] objective in life and that is saving
[51:10] souls for Christ he said my highest
[51:14] ambition and only ambition is to see
[51:17] Jesus Christ glorified and I live for
[51:20] that hallelujah amen well that's that's
[51:23] exactly in line with what Jesus came to
[51:26] do for the the Bible says he came to
[51:27] seek and to save those that were lost
[51:30] ain't that right so we cannot this this
[51:33] cannot be achieve without having a
[51:36] burden Ministry is not effective without
[51:40] first someone having a burden for for
[51:44] souls and I've I know you know there
[51:47] there are men who preach the gospel and
[51:49] yet have no burden for Souls there there
[51:52] are people that play music in churches
[51:55] and maybe they holded uh um an office as
[52:01] as a deacon trustee Sunday school
[52:03] teacher or maybe they're they're they're
[52:06] minister or or whatever but yet and they
[52:10] and they they perform their duties as
[52:13] what is required of them yet they have
[52:16] no burden for
[52:17] Souls they're they're performing they're
[52:20] doing they're doing what is expected of
[52:23] them but without a true heart for people
[52:26] people for for
[52:28] souls and and so the the the people of
[52:31] this lay odyssean Church age you know
[52:34] brother Bram talks about it and he says
[52:35] they're burdened all right they're
[52:37] they're burdened I mean that's that's
[52:39] that's the the prophecy of the day is
[52:42] that they're burdened but they have the
[52:44] wrong kind of Burden he says they're
[52:47] burdened with
[52:48] wealth then than and not burden for
[52:53] souls and so this this fits in line with
[52:56] what the IES described of this age now
[52:59] of course we've got great churches big
[53:02] big churches more we've got seminars and
[53:06] seminaries and and you know Bible
[53:09] colleges that are producing more
[53:12] preachers in in the age than probably
[53:15] ever before I guess and we got more
[53:18] churches on every corner than ever
[53:21] before they have their societies they
[53:23] have their programs and they have their
[53:26] they have their own method methods and
[53:28] their working uh of how to get people
[53:31] into the church uh churches you know uh
[53:36] we we got just just in Tulsa Oklahoma
[53:40] alone there's probably five churches
[53:42] with 5,000 to 10,000 people in in in in
[53:46] the church and and so they're doing
[53:49] something right as far as getting people
[53:51] to the church but with no burden for
[53:55] Souls it's amazing isn't it now how you
[53:58] can have all these programs and
[54:00] societies and all that and do all this
[54:02] for for the interest of getting people
[54:03] to church and yet no
[54:07] burden the Bible or the prophet even
[54:10] talked and I couldn't find it I was
[54:11] trying to find it in the office but uh
[54:15] uh brother Bram talks about how that it
[54:17] would be so easy for people to join the
[54:20] World Council of
[54:21] churches thinking it'll be a better way
[54:24] to win souls it's a it's an opportunity
[54:28] to win souls and yet they are leading
[54:30] people right into the World Council of
[54:34] churches leading them to
[54:37] hell and they're doing this for the the
[54:40] sake of souls but no burden for
[54:44] souls and so uh uh true
[54:49] Christians are have a burden for lost
[54:52] souls they they if anyone's going to
[54:54] have a burden for lost souls I mean a
[54:56] real burden genuine it's it's the it's
[55:00] it's a true Christian and this comes by
[55:04] not human
[55:05] love human love would cause you to be
[55:08] interested in people and trying to help
[55:10] people in one way but but Divine love
[55:14] divine love in a man's heart causes a
[55:17] man to have a burden for
[55:20] Souls um in such a way that it produces
[55:23] the ministry that Jesus Christ had right
[55:27] Divine love of course is an eternal love
[55:29] it survives the hurts it survives the
[55:32] pain the
[55:34] scars it seeks no reward and it doesn't
[55:38] seek revenge it doesn't compromise for
[55:41] gain or
[55:42] popularity it doesn't compromise for the
[55:46] sake of having
[55:49] friends it it's a
[55:51] genuine
[55:53] love and and it it causes you know um it
[56:00] well brother Brandon says it's the
[56:01] purest of love there's different loves
[56:03] there's different types of love but all
[56:06] these other loves come from the the the
[56:10] the purest of love and that's Divine
[56:12] love and anything that that's out of
[56:15] that is a perverted love whether it's
[56:17] human love um there's a lust love
[56:21] there's um I don't know there's all
[56:23] kinds of loves that brother Brown talks
[56:24] about but it's all perverted love
[56:26] there's only one pure love and that's
[56:28] Divine love and that's the love of God
[56:32] and and by that Divine Love Comes the
[56:34] ministry of Jesus Christ ain't that
[56:36] right so so this this Divine love looks
[56:39] beyond the fault and actually sees the
[56:42] need and and brother brandom talks about
[56:44] it he's he's showing the different love
[56:47] uh the difference between human love
[56:49] filio love and and divine love agape
[56:52] love and and he says you know uh uh um
[56:57] uh filal love would cause you to hit a
[56:59] man that insults your wife he said and
[57:03] and and you know hey that that that
[57:05] seems to be the right lie the the the
[57:07] the right action and and the right kind
[57:10] of love for your wife but then he says
[57:12] the agapo love divine Love Actually
[57:14] causes you to pray for that man's lost
[57:20] soul now so
[57:23] so brother brandom says a real born
[57:26] again man or woman that's got
[57:28] discernment of the Holy Ghost will find
[57:30] his place in
[57:31] church I'd like to say that again a real
[57:35] born again man or woman that's got
[57:37] discernment of the Holy Ghost will find
[57:39] his place in
[57:42] church so all these people that don't
[57:44] believe in going to church well there
[57:47] you are a real born again man and woman
[57:51] that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost
[57:53] will find his place in church worshiping
[57:56] and crying
[57:58] out and doing all that that's in his
[58:03] life to bring in
[58:06] Sinners certainly if it's God see he
[58:11] says you should put your heart in it if
[58:14] you've got discernment work everybody
[58:16] say work work don't come to church and
[58:20] just set to be ministered expect to be
[58:22] ministered to because people that expect
[58:25] to be ministered to to they all of a
[58:27] sudden they're the ones that finds the
[58:29] fault in the church because they're not
[58:32] being totally satisfied I mean if
[58:34] someone doesn't call them if the
[58:36] preacher don't come and visit them
[58:38] they're going to have their gripes and
[58:40] complaints if if if the musicians don't
[58:43] play it right if the if the song leader
[58:45] ain't doing it right if the deacons if
[58:48] the church and and and and all a sudden
[58:50] they're the people amen that starts
[58:52] finding the faults in in the church
[58:55] because they are need
[58:56] they've come to just be ministered to
[58:59] they don't see the reason why that that
[59:02] that others put effort into into such
[59:04] things there are the ones that don't see
[59:06] why we put effort in tent meetings and
[59:08] and and and they don't see value they
[59:11] want every all the attention upon
[59:13] themselves hello well it's just the
[59:17] truth and and so but brother Ram says
[59:20] you should put your heart into it if
[59:22] you're coming to church don't just sit
[59:24] there then if it's if it's worth
[59:28] something I don't understand why people
[59:29] go to a church and they
[59:31] complain I you know I I just don't
[59:34] there's all kinds of churches go to the
[59:37] church that satisfies you but if you're
[59:39] coming to church and if it's worth it
[59:41] then put your all into it put put effort
[59:44] into it can you say Amen don't just come
[59:47] and expect the song leader to to revive
[59:50] you put effort into it raise your hands
[59:53] unto God sing be be be be do
[59:59] something put effort into the service
[1:00:01] put effort into your life put effort
[1:00:03] into the church you may not be the
[1:00:06] singer you may not be the the the the
[1:00:09] the the the the musicians you may not be
[1:00:11] the preacher but you've got something to
[1:00:15] do ain't that right see so so and and
[1:00:18] the goal is on anything anything I don't
[1:00:22] care what what you are called to do is
[1:00:26] is to bring Sinners into the kingdom of
[1:00:29] God that's what we want to be effective
[1:00:32] see so certainly if if it's god let's he
[1:00:35] says then you should put your heart into
[1:00:37] it if you've got discernment work don't
[1:00:40] just go and say yes I believe that
[1:00:43] that's the truth that's good amen and
[1:00:45] then go home go to work you you've got
[1:00:49] discernment work while it's light for
[1:00:52] the night cometh when no man can work
[1:00:56] you say Amen brother BR preaches the
[1:00:58] message several times using the title uh
[1:01:01] convinced and then concerned if you're
[1:01:04] convinced about it you'll be concerned
[1:01:06] if you are convinced that the world is
[1:01:08] at its end you will be concerned if
[1:01:12] you're convinced that this message is
[1:01:14] the only way this message holds the the
[1:01:17] the key to a Rapture you'll be concerned
[1:01:20] you won't be just satisfied with your BR
[1:01:22] brother down the road just claiming to
[1:01:24] be a Baptist smoking his cigar there's
[1:01:26] something that calls you cuz you're
[1:01:28] concerned about his
[1:01:30] soulen if you're convinced you're
[1:01:33] concerned can you say Amen if you're
[1:01:35] convinced that that that the the wrath
[1:01:38] of God is coming and if you're convinced
[1:01:40] that the reason why this world is Fallen
[1:01:42] apart is because it's come to its end
[1:01:44] and there's only one safety and that's
[1:01:46] in Christ you'll be concerned you'll be
[1:01:49] concerned about your family you'll be
[1:01:50] concerned about your lost neighbor
[1:01:52] you'll be concerned about your coworker
[1:01:54] you'll be concerned about everybody
[1:01:56] you're
[1:01:58] concerned you get convinced so he says
[1:02:01] see go to work you've got discernment

[1:02:06] cometh when no man can work work while
[1:02:09] we've got an Open Door see work while we
[1:02:12] can have meetings like this see get our
[1:02:15] loved ones in bring them into the gospel
[1:02:18] get our friends our neighbors God died
[1:02:20] for those people and we ought to be
[1:02:22] concerned enough about them to work till
[1:02:25] our hand are bleeding we will come empty
[1:02:29] if we don't amen can you say Amen
[1:02:33] realize and that you know God saved us
[1:02:35] I'm glad for that God God redeemed us
[1:02:37] I'm glad for that it's good to talk
[1:02:39] about Redemption it's good to talk about
[1:02:41] who we are it's good to know that God
[1:02:43] loves us and that we're sons of God but
[1:02:46] don't forget that God died for someone
[1:02:48] else can you sayen don't forget that
[1:02:52] that if we've got the blessings then
[1:02:53] then as Jesus said freely give freely
[1:02:57] you have received freely give freely
[1:02:59] give as you have freely received can you
[1:03:01] say amen amen don't just hog it all
[1:03:04] don't be some selfish individual can you
[1:03:06] say man we've got the greatest message
[1:03:09] on the face of the Earth and sometimes
[1:03:12] we get so used to coming to church and
[1:03:13] we want to be uplifted uplifted uplifted
[1:03:16] oh if he could just uplift me I'm just
[1:03:17] feeling so down I'm just so I'm so so
[1:03:20] bulked down with the world Satan just
[1:03:21] fighting my mind oh God just let the
[1:03:23] preacher just preach me happy but what
[1:03:25] about telling somebody
[1:03:28] else exactly
[1:03:31] amen being burdened for Souls means that
[1:03:34] we are interested in the well-being of
[1:03:37] mankind Body Spirit and
[1:03:40] soul we're we're we're concerned for the
[1:03:42] sick
[1:03:43] people ain't that right we're concerned
[1:03:47] amen for mentally ill people we're we're
[1:03:50] concerned the fact that that that that
[1:03:53] Satan is is is is is is telling young
[1:03:56] people convincing them to commit suicide
[1:03:58] and convincing them putting complexes on
[1:04:01] people's lives to where they can't even
[1:04:02] hold their head up anymore we're
[1:04:05] concerned about these things ain't that
[1:04:07] right we're concerned about their soul
[1:04:10] that's that's the greatest interest in
[1:04:12] our lives it should be about the soul of
[1:04:14] man more than the health of a man it
[1:04:16] should be about the soul of a
[1:04:18] man can you say amen amen that's right
[1:04:21] see because uh uh uh uh you can do all
[1:04:24] you can to build that man's that that
[1:04:26] man's health amen pop the pills give him
[1:04:29] the best of things and all of that and
[1:04:31] that man amen eventually he may get he
[1:04:33] may he may he may get well and he may be
[1:04:35] doing fine and and all of that but
[1:04:38] eventually he's going to have to die
[1:04:39] sometime yeah ain't that right and if he
[1:04:42] dies amen and that Soul has not been
[1:04:45] helped amen he'll die
[1:04:47] lost ain't that right he could have
[1:04:49] lived healthy all of his life and just
[1:04:52] die of a car wreck or die of of of some
[1:04:55] you know something and and even
[1:04:57] sometimes the doctors don't even know
[1:04:58] why they
[1:05:00] died but if that soul is lost then what
[1:05:04] good does it do I know of a lot of men
[1:05:07] and women that have been sick and and
[1:05:09] all of that but their soul is sealed
[1:05:12] amen and they they know where they're
[1:05:15] going to me that's the Eternal
[1:05:18] value so so if we're interested in the
[1:05:21] soul of man then this has to do that his
[1:05:24] spiritual well-being we're interested in
[1:05:27] this his spiritual well-being now the
[1:05:30] Church of Jesus Christ does not
[1:05:32] specialize in in their Ministry does not
[1:05:36] specialize in scientific research the
[1:05:39] body of Jesus Christ with its Ministry
[1:05:42] does not specialize in
[1:05:44] medications we do not specialize in
[1:05:47] Psychology we do not specialize in
[1:05:50] Theology and Seminary training we do not
[1:05:54] specialize you know know uh uh in
[1:05:57] alcoholic programs and Drug programs and
[1:06:02] uh uh you know we we don't specialize in
[1:06:05] establishing uh John 3:16 missions and
[1:06:09] uh uh uh you know food lines to help the
[1:06:12] poor and and and and these things and
[1:06:16] and and we have nothing nothing against
[1:06:19] any of that we're we're glad that they
[1:06:21] are there I am uh glad that they have
[1:06:24] been established to help people in life
[1:06:27] uh uh there are great doctors um uh and
[1:06:31] the Lord has used them to help people uh
[1:06:34] uh no doubt that the John 36 missions
[1:06:37] have have helped people in in uh in life
[1:06:41] and and uh uh so many programs and and
[1:06:44] all that and there are even uh good
[1:06:47] doctors and all that who are message
[1:06:49] Believers and that's that's awesome Amen
[1:06:51] but as the prop that any good doctor
[1:06:53] will admit that their medication what
[1:06:55] they do cannot heal people it it takes
[1:06:58] God to do the healing ain't that right
[1:07:01] amen see and and and and uh uh all these
[1:07:04] things so but we're we're not in the
[1:07:06] business of of getting people reformed
[1:07:09] that's why we don't have drug programs
[1:07:11] and alcoholic and uh uh you know things
[1:07:14] and and all these things we're not about
[1:07:16] teaching people how to cope with their
[1:07:19] problems can you say amen amen I think
[1:07:23] that's what seminars are for is to help
[1:07:25] people to cope with their problems and
[1:07:27] and and all of that but this is the
[1:07:29] commission it's the last commission the
[1:07:32] greatest commission that Jesus gave us
[1:07:35] and we all know it Mark 16:15 he said go
[1:07:37] ye out into all the world and preach the
[1:07:41] gospel to Every Creature yes sir you may
[1:07:44] not be called to go overseas but you got
[1:07:46] what about that that that that that that
[1:07:49] employ that needs God what what about
[1:07:51] that coworker that needs God what about
[1:07:54] that that that your mate that needs God
[1:07:56] or or whatever preach the gospel to
[1:07:59] Every Creature he that believeth and his
[1:08:02] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:08:04] believeth not shall be damned amen and
[1:08:07] these signs shall follow them that
[1:08:09] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:08:10] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:08:14] they shall uh uh take up serpents and if
[1:08:18] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:08:19] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[1:08:22] sick and they shall recover can you say
[1:08:25] Amen so this is the ministry that the
[1:08:28] Church of the Living God
[1:08:31] has ain't that right it's showing that
[1:08:34] the Church of God has a power more than
[1:08:37] science can give you more than education
[1:08:39] can give you there is some Authority
[1:08:42] that man has not been able to tap into
[1:08:46] amen see now there is no profession on
[1:08:49] the face of the Earth that has the
[1:08:51] ability and the power to help people the
[1:08:55] way that they need help like the Church
[1:08:59] of the Living God has there is no school
[1:09:03] college or university Christian secular
[1:09:06] whatever that can Empower a
[1:09:09] man with what you and I have as the
[1:09:13] Church of the Living God Amen can you
[1:09:16] say Amen Zechariah 4:6 says not by might
[1:09:20] nor by power but by my spirit sayith the
[1:09:23] Lord not by my not nor by power not by
[1:09:28] education not by science research not by
[1:09:31] not not not by man's uh ability but by
[1:09:36] my spirit sayth the Lord can you say
[1:09:39] Amen it's the how did you get into the
[1:09:41] Church of the Living God by his Spirit
[1:09:44] how was your soul saved by his Spirit
[1:09:47] can you sayen how did you get Redeemed
[1:09:49] by his spirit amen who healed the scars
[1:09:52] and who healed the wounds by his spirit
[1:09:55] everything it's been by his Spirit ain't
[1:09:57] that right yes sir see and so then it is
[1:10:02] the church that has this special
[1:10:03] Ministry for it's the church that is the
[1:10:07] Tabernacle of God himself it is the the
[1:10:11] Tabernacle of deity amen and it's made
[1:10:14] up of Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:18] God Amen it's a higher office than than
[1:10:21] a doctor would have a president would
[1:10:24] have a king would have any position on
[1:10:27] the face of the Earth any profession the
[1:10:31] fact that you have come into the body of
[1:10:34] Christ by his Spirit you're born into it
[1:10:37] and you are now Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:39] God deity living inside of you the
[1:10:41] prophet said deity is not in heaven it's
[1:10:43] in you can you say amen that's the
[1:10:46] highest thing that you could ever
[1:10:49] achieve I enjoyed brother Terry's
[1:10:52] message Wednesday night you know and and
[1:10:55] uh he talked about God becoming
[1:10:56] incarnate in his church amen and U uh
[1:11:00] just just a wonderful uh sermon but we
[1:11:04] we find here uh uh brother brand says
[1:11:09] Satan is going
[1:11:10] to uh has incarnated himself from
[1:11:13] Antichrist to false prophet now and in
[1:11:16] the days of the Jew is Antichrist
[1:11:19] amongst the early Church in the Dark
[1:11:22] Ages he become a false prophet to the
[1:11:24] world see her there with her cup of
[1:11:27] iniquity that's to the church age but in
[1:11:30] the age after the church goes home he
[1:11:33] becomes a beast he becomes the devil
[1:11:35] incarnate uh the red dragon himself oh
[1:11:38] my can't you see what I mean he's
[1:11:40] incarnate in his people then he's got
[1:11:43] his people Bound by his power yes that's
[1:11:48] that's what's happening he's binding the
[1:11:50] People by his power how he's getting
[1:11:53] them coming into the World Council of
[1:11:55] churches there's something that is
[1:11:57] binding them to it they have no idea
[1:11:59] what it is but but by God sending a
[1:12:02] prophet it's opened our illumination
[1:12:05] it's given us an Insight of really
[1:12:07] what's taking place in this world it's a
[1:12:12] power and the false prophet has
[1:12:14] prophesied them right into it give them
[1:12:17] over to strong delusions to believe a
[1:12:19] lie and be damned by it denying the word
[1:12:22] with a form of godliness ain't that
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:25] but notice God works his place in a
[1:12:28] trinity justification sanctification and
[1:12:32] incarnate himself in his people with the
[1:12:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost so what are
[1:12:38] you today as the Church of the Living
[1:12:40] God you are God it's the Incarnate God
[1:12:45] in you your body you're the Tabernacle
[1:12:49] of Jesus Christ that's not a figment of
[1:12:52] our imagination that's not just a phrase
[1:12:54] that's actual real
[1:12:57] ity praise the Lord so today it's the
[1:13:00] Incarnate Word made flesh
[1:13:03] amen amongst his people again it's the
[1:13:07] church that is the branch right where
[1:13:11] the life of the vine flows through it's
[1:13:15] the church that the Holy Spirit has the
[1:13:17] preeminence over it is the church that
[1:13:21] must be about the father's
[1:13:23] business it it is the church that God
[1:13:26] must trust can you say Amen so the
[1:13:30] mission of the
[1:13:31] church is to preach the gospel which we
[1:13:35] know what that means demonstrate the
[1:13:38] gospel demonstrate the power of God
[1:13:42] brother Ram said Jesus never did say
[1:13:45] build big churches no he never never did
[1:13:48] he say have seminaries I ain't got
[1:13:50] nothing against churches big churches
[1:13:52] they're all right I haven't got nothing
[1:13:54] against seminar they're all right but
[1:13:56] Jesus never commissioned us to do that
[1:13:59] he never said big build uh build big
[1:14:02] churches or have seminaries he never
[1:14:04] said build hospitals or schools but
[1:14:06] they're all right remember I have
[1:14:08] nothing against them but the very
[1:14:10] principle that he said for us to do
[1:14:12] we've let down and took
[1:14:15] secondarily can you say amen amen that's
[1:14:17] right see we have built great hospitals
[1:14:19] and schools and great places and
[1:14:21] seminaries and educated our preachers to
[1:14:24] make them so that they can speak with
[1:14:26] very fine swelled words and use the
[1:14:28] psychology and stand stiff and say amen
[1:14:31] and just as plight as it can be and all
[1:14:34] of that and what has it gotten us a
[1:14:36] bunch of big or a big bunch of
[1:14:38] backsliding people nothing but a bunch
[1:14:42] of cold formal indifferent churches as
[1:14:45] cold as zero weather spiritually
[1:14:48] speaking can you say amen that's right
[1:14:51] see so they have emphasized on big
[1:14:55] they've emphasized there's nothing wrong
[1:14:57] with big churches you know you know
[1:14:59] people think that sometimes well if a
[1:15:01] message you know if if there's a big
[1:15:03] church in the mess of church they're
[1:15:05] compromising that ain't that ain't true
[1:15:07] that's right that that that that ain't
[1:15:09] true at all amen see that's not what
[1:15:11] brother brandham is saying that we all
[1:15:13] got to have a small congregation we all
[1:15:15] got to have a small thing if God's
[1:15:16] blessed a man with the ministry that can
[1:15:18] draw draw people then so be it God bless
[1:15:22] them for that you understand what I'm
[1:15:24] saying amen you know as long as it's
[1:15:26] done the right
[1:15:27] way sure but but the but but but men
[1:15:32] have have emphasized on churches amen of
[1:15:36] of the more the more people the the
[1:15:39] better they are it's a Prestige
[1:15:41] thing and and while they're building
[1:15:44] their B big churches and they have their
[1:15:46] thousands of people they're compromising
[1:15:48] on the very word and they're leading
[1:15:51] souls to hell because they have no
[1:15:53] burden for Souls
[1:15:55] Amen brother
[1:15:57] amen and what they've done they've
[1:16:00] kicked out the only one that can help
[1:16:02] them brother Braham says see the
[1:16:05] American people are so hypnotized with
[1:16:07] different theologies and the Bible says
[1:16:09] that' be that way see he said did you
[1:16:12] know that said when they go from the
[1:16:14] East and the west north and south
[1:16:16] seeking to find the true word of God and
[1:16:17] they failed to find it doctor so and so
[1:16:20] believes it this way and doctor so and
[1:16:22] so believes it that way and they kicked
[1:16:24] out the blood they kick out the
[1:16:25] atonement they kick out the power they
[1:16:27] kick out the Holy Spirit you know you
[1:16:30] know and E even today there there's many
[1:16:32] churches that kick out the spirit of
[1:16:34] worship in the church the moment you
[1:16:36] start getting excited in God you need to
[1:16:39] settle down they kick out the worship
[1:16:42] yeah ain't that right amen now you can
[1:16:44] say Amen to that because you know it's
[1:16:48] true and they do it in the message
[1:16:51] churches just as much he says and what
[1:16:53] they got left what do they have left
[1:16:55] they they they take out the blood of
[1:16:57] Jesus Christ out of the Bible to where
[1:16:59] you haven't gotten no Bible left they
[1:17:01] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost out
[1:17:03] of there and you got nothing to preach
[1:17:05] with or preach
[1:17:08] on he says Jesus is the same yesterday
[1:17:12] today and forever don't you never let
[1:17:14] anybody tell you anything else he's
[1:17:17] raised from the dead he lives tonight
[1:17:19] supremely he's here in the building now
[1:17:22] certainly he is where two or three are
[1:17:25] gathered in together I'll be in their
[1:17:27] midst no matter how small the church is
[1:17:29] or even two or three gathered I'll be
[1:17:31] there he can not lie amen amen see and
[1:17:36] so therefore the ministry of Jesus
[1:17:39] Christ is built upon the power of the
[1:17:43] Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost can you say Amen
[1:17:47] Lord praise the Lord now we find that I
[1:17:52] would say
[1:17:53] 99%
[1:17:57] of churches both big and small have
[1:17:59] kicked Christ
[1:18:00] out which is fulfillment of what it says
[1:18:04] here in Revelations
[1:18:06] 3:19 Jesus
[1:18:08] speaking of this leay Odyssey and church
[1:18:11] age saying behold I stand at the door
[1:18:13] and knock If any man hear my voice and
[1:18:16] open the door I will come into him and
[1:18:18] will s with him and he with me brother
[1:18:20] that's the most pathetic scripture is
[1:18:23] where Jesus is kicked out of his own
[1:18:25] church amen been kicked out can you say
[1:18:29] amen and and and so what have they done
[1:18:33] they they've turned to education to help
[1:18:35] their Ministry they've turned to
[1:18:38] scientific knowledge to help their
[1:18:39] Ministry they've turned to psychology to
[1:18:42] help their Ministry cuz they have no
[1:18:44] power they kicked out the very thing
[1:18:45] that can help people exactly ain't that
[1:18:47] right amen and they' they've kicked and
[1:18:50] and they're substituting now everything
[1:18:53] else programs and nice things and
[1:18:56] intellectualism and and all of these
[1:18:59] things for uh to for the sake of Soul
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:05] winning true right now we
[1:19:08] are called to
[1:19:10] minister to those who are in
[1:19:14] need we do not Minister through
[1:19:16] profession
[1:19:18] professionalism right yeah we don't
[1:19:21] Minister through skill we don't Minister
[1:19:23] through education
[1:19:26] you don't have to be talented in order
[1:19:28] to
[1:19:30] minister you have to find your place
[1:19:34] that God has called you to be that's the
[1:19:37] important thing now God uses our talents
[1:19:40] for his purpose and we are to be our
[1:19:45] best Lord amen I think we ought to be
[1:19:48] the best
[1:19:49] musicians I think we ought to be the
[1:19:51] best preachers sir I think we ought to
[1:19:53] do our best amen amen now it all depends
[1:19:55] what we do say is our best I don't think
[1:19:57] you need to go to school to to to to be
[1:20:01] effective as far as you know
[1:20:05] um um not against learning I just don't
[1:20:09] think a minister needs to go to school
[1:20:11] to to to be as best as a
[1:20:14] preacher ain't that right but I think we
[1:20:18] ought to be our best if we're going to
[1:20:19] be a minister let's be our best amen
[1:20:23] don't just be halfway
[1:20:25] I I I just you know and and we we'll put
[1:20:28] it this way you know we we again it's
[1:20:32] not by might nor by power but by my
[1:20:34] spirit sayith the
[1:20:36] Lord amen we know that we need the Lord
[1:20:41] we need his anointing I don't care what
[1:20:43] we can say in words I don't care how
[1:20:45] good a man can play I don't music I
[1:20:48] don't care how good he can sing and all
[1:20:49] that without the anointing you're
[1:20:51] nothing amen that's just facts
[1:20:55] help us ain't that right so we need the
[1:20:59] spirit why do we need the spirit because
[1:21:02] we know that that's the only way that
[1:21:05] can help the
[1:21:06] people lord it's the only
[1:21:11] way well I'm just waiting for an
[1:21:15] unction that's not the point there's
[1:21:18] many times I get up here without unction
[1:21:20] come on Brother come on and I'm relying
[1:21:22] on the Holy Spirit to come sure
[1:21:25] there's many times that that musicians
[1:21:28] get up and start playing without unction
[1:21:29] but they're relying on the spirit of God
[1:21:33] true it's not our gifts we're not here
[1:21:36] to show off we're here to play our best
[1:21:40] we're here to do our best as a preacher
[1:21:43] but I don't have to be brother Wayne
[1:21:44] Lawson to be a best preacher I don't
[1:21:47] have to be an Andrew Glover Donnie
[1:21:49] Reagan or or Tim PR to be the best
[1:21:51] preacher I have to be what God called me
[1:21:53] to be and be my
[1:21:55] best ain't that right that I don't need
[1:21:58] to sound like Randy Travis to be a best
[1:22:01] singer or whatever you your group
[1:22:05] is some say well thank God for not being
[1:22:09] Randy well you might like someone else
[1:22:12] in the gospel group I don't have to sing
[1:22:14] like George
[1:22:17] johs or
[1:22:19] whoever young people probably don't know
[1:22:21] who joh George JNS is you know that's
[1:22:23] that's my dad I
[1:22:26] guess I have to be my
[1:22:29] best ain't that right that's what I
[1:22:32] appreciate about brother Kevin trying to
[1:22:34] get the musicians together be your
[1:22:36] best sir play together in unison play
[1:22:39] together in
[1:22:41] harmony why because there there's
[1:22:43] something that we're after but more than
[1:22:46] anything of this more than anything we
[1:22:49] need the spirit of
[1:22:51] God ain't that right well then if we
[1:22:54] know that we need the spirit of God then
[1:22:56] we can't just be living a halfway
[1:22:59] life amen amen you understand what I'm
[1:23:02] saying you know you know uh uh we can't
[1:23:06] I'm going to take myself as a minister
[1:23:07] we I I you you wouldn't want you
[1:23:09] couldn't expect me and I can't expect
[1:23:11] myself to stay on the phone all the time
[1:23:13] never study never pray never think of
[1:23:16] God all the time just wrapped up in in
[1:23:19] comedy and all the time you know to
[1:23:20] where you know then all of a sudden I'm
[1:23:22] starting to look at pornography or I'm
[1:23:24] starting to look at this and I'm
[1:23:25] starting to have problems and I'm
[1:23:26] starting to have all these things and
[1:23:28] then come up and preach and expect God
[1:23:30] to bless you understand what I'm saying
[1:23:33] that there has to be a dedicated
[1:23:37] life you understand what I'm saying
[1:23:39] doctors can smoke they can be a drunk
[1:23:40] and they can do all that and still
[1:23:42] operate on you and do a good
[1:23:44] job but we as the body of Christ we're
[1:23:48] called to a higher goal a higher
[1:23:50] Ministry we need the spirit of God as
[1:23:53] long as we have a Spirit of bitterness
[1:23:55] on us brother BR says it drives the
[1:23:57] spirit of God away from us how can you
[1:23:59] minister in Your Capacity the way you
[1:24:01] need to minister the way God has called
[1:24:03] us to minister having bitterness hanging
[1:24:05] on us oh but I I I I help people and I
[1:24:09] do this and I do that that has nothing
[1:24:11] to do with
[1:24:13] it we need the spirit of God to approve
[1:24:16] of Our
[1:24:17] Lives is that not what the prophet uh uh
[1:24:21] uh relied upon Minister said well you
[1:24:23] don't even know your Bible you can't

[1:24:39] relied upon God he stayed in fellowship
[1:24:42] with God he stayed true to God and God

[1:26:57] Harry out
[1:26:59] there hello we give our children over to
[1:27:03] sports right amen the only reason why
[1:27:06] you do that is because you need a
[1:27:08] babysitter and you ain't got enough guts
[1:27:11] to get down and pray for your children
[1:27:14] how can you pray for the soul of that
[1:27:16] child and then you give them over to
[1:27:18] worldly
[1:27:19] influence
[1:27:21] amen help us God told you about one time
[1:27:24] a friend of mine minister went
[1:27:27] overseas first time going over there to
[1:27:30] this certain
[1:27:34] Church met the
[1:27:37] pastor and got to talking to him and his
[1:27:41] two girls walked
[1:27:45] in the minister friend of mine said I
[1:27:50] caught it right
[1:27:51] there they were lesbians
[1:27:56] he I caught their
[1:27:57] Spirit them two girls are in bad
[1:28:02] shape so as they he was talking to his
[1:28:06] the pastor and he asked his pastors what
[1:28:09] happened to your daughters he's like
[1:28:11] what do you
[1:28:14] mean he said they're they're lesbians
[1:28:16] aren't they the man just started crying
[1:28:20] I broke down crying he said I tell you
[1:28:23] what I done he I started letting them
[1:28:25] play
[1:28:27] soccer he said I started letting them
[1:28:29] play soccer not even understanding that
[1:28:30] their coach was
[1:28:33] lesbian they started working on My
[1:28:37] Girls He said now I don't know what to
[1:28:40] do which of course the the minister
[1:28:42] friend said well there's a power that
[1:28:44] can that can break
[1:28:47] that amen but why let him go to that
[1:28:52] extent why give them over to things of
[1:28:54] the
[1:28:55] world we're called to be a
[1:28:58] minister people say well I ain't got
[1:29:00] nothing to do in church you don't have
[1:29:02] to have anything to do in church what
[1:29:03] about your
[1:29:05] family what what about the people that
[1:29:08] God given you as
[1:29:09] friends to help to
[1:29:12] witness to pray
[1:29:19] for can you say Amen you love the
[1:29:23] Lord
[1:29:26] amen we all parents make mistakes I
[1:29:29] understand that we all make
[1:29:33] mistakes but I think we should learn
[1:29:35] from our mistakes I think we should
[1:29:38] grow hello
[1:29:42] grow the
[1:29:48] Lord now you don't have to be talented
[1:29:51] in order to minister you know uh but we
[1:29:54] are to be our
[1:29:57] best but the way we serve the way we
[1:30:00] serve is by
[1:30:02] influence by being an influence but our
[1:30:06] influence is not a carnal thing in other
[1:30:10] words we're not using our
[1:30:13] Personality yeah right there's there's
[1:30:17] if if you use your personality right
[1:30:20] that's a good thing there's all kinds of
[1:30:24] men that have stronger personalities
[1:30:26] than others true and they take that
[1:30:28] personality and they draw to themselves
[1:30:30] and they use that to split
[1:30:32] churches they use that to divide they
[1:30:35] use that to to bring
[1:30:39] contradiction and it becomes an ego
[1:30:41] thing right true true
[1:30:44] hello it's
[1:30:47] true our influence should not come does
[1:30:50] not come just by being fundamental in
[1:30:52] the scriptures
[1:30:55] there's all kinds of churches that are
[1:30:57] fundamental
[1:30:58] fundamental fundamental
[1:31:01] right brother Braham talks about balum
[1:31:03] and
[1:31:05] Moses
[1:31:07] fundamentally balam and Moab all that
[1:31:10] they were right they did everything that
[1:31:13] Moses done and Israel they had the same
[1:31:15] kind of altars they had the same kind of
[1:31:17] this they sered the same God they serve
[1:31:19] whatever fundamentally they were
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:24] but Moses had the pillar of
[1:31:28] fire right he was anointed of God to
[1:31:34] lead the people out bam didn't
[1:31:38] fundamental
[1:31:42] right true
[1:31:45] amen now I hope this all right
[1:31:49] today but Isaiah 60 And1 says arise
[1:31:52] Shine for thy light light everybody say
[1:31:55] thy light is come and the glory of the
[1:31:58] Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The
[1:32:00] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[1:32:03] Darkness to people but the Lord shall
[1:32:05] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[1:32:07] seen upon thee amen ain't that wonderful
[1:32:11] thy light is come yeah so this this
[1:32:14] scripture was a prophecy speaking of
[1:32:16] this day and age and and and again it's
[1:32:20] it's a day of night and of Darkness and
[1:32:23] Light it's a day where gross darkness is
[1:32:26] covered the people yes and and believe
[1:32:28] it or not Darkness has an
[1:32:32] influence a ain't that right Darkness
[1:32:35] has an influence there there's a there's
[1:32:37] there's a life that dwells in darkness
[1:32:40] and it's
[1:32:41] real there's creatures that dwell in
[1:32:43] darkness that cannot dwell in light and
[1:32:46] when the light the Sun starts shining
[1:32:48] these creatures Scurry when you turn on
[1:32:50] the light the roaches
[1:32:52] leaf amen yeah that's right but Darkness
[1:32:57] has has an influence and brother Brandon
[1:32:59] would call this Darkness it's the
[1:33:01] influence of the power of Darkness the
[1:33:04] influence of the power of darkness and
[1:33:06] we have to understand there's there's
[1:33:08] there's a there it's the there's only
[1:33:11] two influence and that's the power of
[1:33:12] darkness and the power of
[1:33:14] God are you with me there there are
[1:33:18] people that are religious as religious
[1:33:20] can be and doing everything they can in
[1:33:23] their societ ities and in their programs
[1:33:25] and all that Amen to bring people in and
[1:33:28] yet it's under sitting under the power
[1:33:31] of Darkness that's their influence and
[1:33:33] it's influencing them to the World
[1:33:35] Council of churches it's influencing
[1:33:38] them into the tribulation it's
[1:33:40] influencing them and they don't know
[1:33:42] what it
[1:33:45] is on now can you say Amen but in the
[1:33:48] middle of all of this and and the
[1:33:50] politics and all of these things if you
[1:33:51] could look at the world today uh uh uh
[1:33:55] over 99% of the people in the world
[1:33:57] today is influenced by the power of
[1:33:59] Darkness they're under this influence
[1:34:04] amen can you say amen I and and if we
[1:34:08] could ever really get convinced of that
[1:34:09] we'll really be
[1:34:14] concerned but a rise
[1:34:16] Shine for thy light has come amen the
[1:34:20] church is not left without influence a
[1:34:23] rise shine for thy light has come the
[1:34:25] Lord has risen upon thee and His glory
[1:34:28] shall be seen upon thee ain't that right
[1:34:31] now notice what Jesus said you are the
[1:34:34] light of the world can you say Amen see
[1:34:38] we would be in Gross Darkness as well we
[1:34:41] we are no special uh no different we're
[1:34:43] common born Flesh and Blood just like
[1:34:46] everybody else we've got a we we've had
[1:34:48] to deal with sinful nature we had to be
[1:34:50] saved just like everybody else and all
[1:34:52] of these things but by the grace of God
[1:34:55] in order for us to be the light of the
[1:34:58] world there had to be a light rise and
[1:35:01] shine upon
[1:35:06] us now who is the light of the world
[1:35:09] brother Ram said the seed of that age
[1:35:11] that Pro that manifests the promised
[1:35:13] word the seed of the age now he's
[1:35:15] talking in in in uh the seed of
[1:35:18] discrepancy the seed of that age is are
[1:35:21] those who manifest the promised word for
[1:35:23] that age they are the kingdom of God the
[1:35:26] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:28] operating through his children is those
[1:35:31] of the kingdom of that age can you say
[1:35:34] Amen now brother Brandon uh uh in in uh
[1:35:38] well several sermons but he he he says
[1:35:41] that the Moon is the type of the church
[1:35:44] ain't that right amen and and and so
[1:35:47] what is the Moon it has no light of its
[1:35:49] own but it reflects the light of the Sun
[1:35:53] and as long as is nothing comes between
[1:35:55] it and the sun Amen to darken the moon
[1:35:58] remember when it when when the world
[1:36:00] passes when the earth passes through
[1:36:02] between the Sun and the Moon then the
[1:36:05] moon BLS
[1:36:07] out
[1:36:09] true right and so so we we we see that
[1:36:14] and and and so but but we we find that
[1:36:17] as long as there's nothing there
[1:36:19] blocking the light amen then the light
[1:36:22] uh of the sun shine upon the moon and
[1:36:24] the moon just
[1:36:26] reflects radiates the light of the sun
[1:36:30] amen ain't that right well so the church
[1:36:34] has no light of her own but she is a
[1:36:37] reflector of another light so AR rise
[1:36:41] shine AR rise shine Church in the midst
[1:36:44] of Darkness gross Darkness Darkness
[1:36:46] covering the Earth rise and shine
[1:36:49] there's an influence upon you it's not
[1:36:52] the influence of Darkness there's a
[1:36:54] light that is
[1:36:56] shining a light that is shining upon you
[1:37:00] well brother brand said well what light
[1:37:01] is it it's the manifested word of God
[1:37:05] identified is
[1:37:08] light the manifested word of God
[1:37:12] identified is
[1:37:15] light amen there can be no light outside
[1:37:18] the word of God can you say Amen so now
[1:37:21] brother BR said well what is gross
[1:37:23] Darkness then it's to fail to see the
[1:37:25] light that's shining gross darkness is
[1:37:30] is is failing to see the light that's
[1:37:33] shining can you say amen and and he says
[1:37:36] this seventh Church age is all smothered
[1:37:38] out see with Christ on the outside so
[1:37:42] gross Darkness has covered the people
[1:37:44] ain't that right but unto you arise and
[1:37:47] shine you got to shine why how are we
[1:37:51] going to shine thy light has come
[1:37:54] God hasn't left us without
[1:37:56] light how true the scripture is you are
[1:37:58] the light of the world and God provided
[1:38:01] the light to shine on you so you could
[1:38:05] reflect can you say Amen now brother
[1:38:08] Bram said you cannot be here a spiritual
[1:38:09] being sinner or Saint without having an
[1:38:12] influence from the underworld or from
[1:38:14] the world
[1:38:15] above so so every individual sinner or
[1:38:18] Saint in this Mortal life has an
[1:38:22] influence amen
[1:38:24] and it's from either the influence comes
[1:38:27] from above or from underneath right
[1:38:30] influence comes from Hell or
[1:38:34] Heaven and brother Braham says see
[1:38:36] Mortals are influen from an outside
[1:38:38] world I should understand by the grace
[1:38:40] of God I deal with spirits and I should
[1:38:42] know what I'm speaking of and I I and I
[1:38:46] look along through this dark mass of
[1:38:48] gity every once in a while you'll see
[1:38:50] little lights of Burning Lights see
[1:38:54] there you are it's your table today
[1:38:56] lights are burning that's Christians in
[1:38:58] the darkness giving light see what I
[1:39:01] mean now look look at this here the The
[1:39:04] Sinner is influenced by a spirit because
[1:39:07] he has a spirit and the wrong gives
[1:39:10] influence and the right gives influence
[1:39:13] can you say Amen so no wonder the devil
[1:39:15] is against us no wonder the devil wants
[1:39:17] to destroy us is because the most
[1:39:20] majority of the world is uninfluenced of
[1:39:22] Darkness
[1:39:24] and and and darkness is influencing the
[1:39:26] wrong is influencing television is
[1:39:28] influencing our children amen uh uh uh
[1:39:31] evil minds are influencing our children
[1:39:34] technology is influencing uh the
[1:39:37] people to where there more more
[1:39:40] more uh uh perceptive and uh uh what
[1:39:46] more more controlled by by the things of
[1:39:48] the
[1:39:49] world and and it's true yes sir that you
[1:39:52] know I'm I mean just anything is
[1:39:54] becoming God
[1:39:55] today right Hollywood sports stars and
[1:39:59] and and girls and and cars and homes and
[1:40:03] wealth and jobs all that's becoming
[1:40:05] God's today they they're under such an
[1:40:08] influence of Darkness there there's
[1:40:10] nothing that there's no standards
[1:40:13] today can you say Amen there's no
[1:40:16] standards in dress there's no standards
[1:40:17] in Morality anymore it's becoming common
[1:40:20] that boys and girls just shack up kiss
[1:40:23] and and all that when a prophet said
[1:40:24] just kissing a boy and a girl kissing is
[1:40:27] is adultery
[1:40:30] potentially it's an
[1:40:33] adultery but we give them over to to to
[1:40:36] and and let let our children be
[1:40:38] influenced by people that don't don't
[1:40:39] understand these
[1:40:41] things boys hugging with girls and all
[1:40:43] that don't even claim to be husband or
[1:40:46] or boyfriend and girlfriend they it's
[1:40:47] just a society
[1:40:49] today when when a prophet said no red
[1:40:52] blooded man can whether you're filled
[1:40:54] with the Holy Ghost or not can genuinely
[1:40:56] put your hands around another woman and
[1:40:58] not have sensual feelings you can't do
[1:41:01] it amen I don't care what they say you
[1:41:03] can't do
[1:41:06] it
[1:41:08] hello but it's become the norm
[1:41:11] today see why it's a
[1:41:14] Darkness but in the middle of Darkness
[1:41:17] there is a light thank God that's burden
[1:41:21] for that soul
[1:41:23] there's a light that's standing
[1:41:29] here that's not saying oh it's okay cuz
[1:41:33] I want to be your
[1:41:34] friend so we don't say nothing about it
[1:41:36] we just let it
[1:41:39] go come on
[1:41:41] now we'll let them use the lord's name
[1:41:44] in vain and don't think nothing of it
[1:41:45] because we're afraid to hurt their
[1:41:46] feelings come on come on where's the
[1:41:49] light at
[1:41:51] amen we're afraid to say we're a
[1:41:53] Christian because we we well cuz our
[1:41:56] life really don't really match
[1:41:58] up come on so then we become we're
[1:42:00] afraid to be Hypocrites so instead of
[1:42:02] just cleaning our life up and
[1:42:04] proclaiming what we are we just soon not
[1:42:06] Proclaim what we are so we no one will
[1:42:08] think we're different if you're the
[1:42:09] light of this age if you're the light of
[1:42:11] the world you will be different because
[1:42:14] you're contradicting the power of
[1:42:15] Darkness you're showing that Darkness
[1:42:18] has no right over me has no power over
[1:42:20] me has no control over me I'm a
[1:42:22] different
[1:42:24] person can you say
[1:42:27] Amen I'm Different not because I got a
[1:42:30] different personality not because I
[1:42:32] think more positive than the next
[1:42:36] guy or because I'm smarter than the next
[1:42:39] guy it's because I'm a light that Jesus
[1:42:43] Christ can reflect himself
[1:42:45] through praise the
[1:42:48] Lord so he said see The Sinner is
[1:42:50] influenced by spirit because he has a
[1:42:52] spirit the wrong the wrong gives
[1:42:55] influence the right gives influence and
[1:42:57] those who are dominated from the
[1:42:59] Blackness and separation are dominated
[1:43:01] from the underworld of devils see look
[1:43:05] the first thing he says here when you're
[1:43:07] going out of this line now he says get
[1:43:10] this straight here's you know and and I
[1:43:12] guess he's got a line and he says here's
[1:43:15] where Mortals live a whole Comm
[1:43:18] conglomeration is Blackness and darkness
[1:43:21] but in there in there is little lights
[1:43:24] placed now and then that's born again uh
[1:43:28] uh that's Christians that are born again
[1:43:30] of light you are a light that is set on
[1:43:33] a hill a candle that is set in the room
[1:43:36] and gives light to all the room that's
[1:43:38] what a Christian is among Darkness
[1:43:40] you're supposed to shine where it's
[1:43:43] dark the wicked or the unbeliever is
[1:43:46] influenced from beneath there is a
[1:43:48] trinity of hell like there is a trinity
[1:43:51] of Heaven they're influenced evil
[1:43:54] powers are you with me see and so we as
[1:43:58] lights in this world of Darkness amen
[1:44:00] God gives us a
[1:44:03] burden by a Divine
[1:44:08] love we got to reach
[1:44:11] them we got to help
[1:44:16] them can you say Amen see the moon only
[1:44:20] influences the Earth by the Light it
[1:44:22] shines
[1:44:26] it has the authority and power to
[1:44:27] control and to exert influence by its
[1:44:31] light Jesus said let your light so shine
[1:44:34] before men that they may see your good
[1:44:36] works and glorify your father which is
[1:44:38] in heaven ain't that right so light has
[1:44:43] the power to influence just as much as
[1:44:45] Darkness has the power to
[1:44:48] influence now Satan the prophet said
[1:44:51] Satan is doing his best or I'm
[1:44:54] paraphrasing to kill the influence among
[1:44:56] the people kill the influence of the
[1:44:59] word among the People by sewing his seed
[1:45:01] of discrepancy right yeah right telling
[1:45:04] him to join the church shake the
[1:45:07] preacher's hand ah it's okay to take a
[1:45:09] drink every once in a while long as you
[1:45:12] just do it you know have
[1:45:14] self-control you know it's okay God
[1:45:17] loves all all no one's perfect so you
[1:45:19] know you you we'll we we'll put a
[1:45:21] smoking for you and we'll do this and
[1:45:25] therefore no nothing's preached against
[1:45:28] anymore so we've allowed the homosexuals
[1:45:30] transgenders now we allow W boys and
[1:45:33] girls shacking
[1:45:35] up
[1:45:37] amen it's just truth there there why
[1:45:41] because the preacher is afraid of a meal
[1:45:43] ticket right that's what brother BR
[1:45:45] called a meal ticket he's afraid that he
[1:45:47] if he starts preaching strong then he's
[1:45:49] going to lose his
[1:45:50] crowd right and and and and of course no
[1:45:54] one wants to be unpopular no one wants
[1:45:57] to be considered the Oddball you know so
[1:46:00] let's let's just let's just baby
[1:46:03] everything and and and and while the
[1:46:06] world is well you know brother Brown
[1:46:09] talks about you know well Jesus said he
[1:46:11] gives us power you know to remit sins
[1:46:13] and who ever sins you remit are you
[1:46:15] remit are remitted and and these things
[1:46:18] and he says well the Catholic Church
[1:46:20] claims to do that but he says the only
[1:46:22] one that really that has the power to do
[1:46:24] that is the Church of the Living God and
[1:46:26] how do we remit the sins by preaching
[1:46:28] the gospel preaching the word hello do
[1:46:31] you realize if you hold back on the
[1:46:33] truth they're going to die be
[1:46:38] lost
[1:46:41] hello well yeah well they're good people
[1:46:44] they baptized in Father Son and Holy
[1:46:45] Ghost though but they're really good
[1:46:46] people they're just they really love the
[1:46:48] Lord but do you realize what a prophet
[1:46:49] said that Devils travel in the name of
[1:46:51] Father Son and Holy Ghost travel in them
[1:46:53] titles and we know that and don't say
[1:46:56] anything about
[1:46:58] it
[1:47:00] amen hello it doesn't cause us to get on
[1:47:03] our knees and
[1:47:06] pray am
[1:47:09] amen amen hope you understand
[1:47:14] amen that they kill the influence Jesus

[1:50:29] can use me that's what I want and I want
[1:50:33] to be in a place that God can use me I
[1:50:36] want to be in a place that God can look

[1:50:56] the difference we live in the presence
[1:50:57] of the son amen are you with me now we
[1:51:01] live in a place that God can have
[1:51:03] complete control of our
[1:51:05] lives but you live in a place where you
[1:51:07] block the presence of God from your life
[1:51:09] how do you help others amen so wrapped
[1:51:12] up in the world and wrapped up in this
[1:51:14] you ain't prayed you ain't read your

[1:51:18] you're listening to more gossip and
[1:51:19] unbelief and everything else you're
[1:51:21] influenced by nothing else than the
[1:51:23] presence of God Amen now the prophet
[1:51:26] said we must live in the presence of God
[1:51:29] ripen in the presence of God can you say
[1:51:31] Amen we got a ripen
[1:51:35] Church the world's getting more dark and
[1:51:37] more dark and more dark but our

[1:51:45] life shouldn't be more is just so uh
[1:51:48] infested with with Devils to where we
[1:51:51] can't even raise hands anymore on no you
[1:51:54] live in the presence of that light your
[1:51:57] influence is from the
[1:51:59] light your influence is a greater than
[1:52:02] the
[1:52:04] darkness the prophet says the the light
[1:52:06] is 10 million times stronger than
[1:52:08] Darkness how dare we live go a Christian
[1:52:12] Life like the world would live so
[1:52:14] defeated so gloomy so we we don't know
[1:52:17] what to do we're just helpless little
[1:52:19] creatures then live in the presence of
[1:52:21] the light
[1:52:24] God doesn't bring complexes the devil
[1:52:26] puts complexes on us yes Hees God
[1:52:29] doesn't bring us into bitterness and and
[1:52:31] hate the devil does
[1:52:34] that God doesn't bring us in a position
[1:52:37] where we can't lift our hands and
[1:52:38] glorify God the devil does that God
[1:52:42] doesn't put us in a place to where we
[1:52:45] isolate ourselves from everybody else
[1:52:47] and we don't want to talk and we don't
[1:52:48] want to do that the devil does that
[1:52:53] amen can you say
[1:52:54] Amen so it all depends what we're living
[1:52:57] under influenced by the
[1:53:00] world now you remember how it is with
[1:53:04] let's just say with weights or with any
[1:53:07] kind of
[1:53:08] exercise it's always hard to live to
[1:53:12] exercise especially when you're starting
[1:53:14] out you breathe hard there's one point
[1:53:18] you I just walk up these
[1:53:21] steps I'm thinking in my mind Lord just
[1:53:23] let me let my breathing become stable
[1:53:25] before they call me you know turn it
[1:53:27] over to
[1:53:30] me but the more you exercise and the
[1:53:32] more you you you you get off the that
[1:53:35] old
[1:53:37] weight true you build your
[1:53:40] muscles you find in yourself you're
[1:53:42] achieving something amen you you you're
[1:53:44] finding yourself
[1:53:46] improving right you're able to do things
[1:53:49] that you used to not be able to do
[1:53:54] right sure well that's the way it is
[1:53:57] with
[1:54:01] God Amen if we have a burden for
[1:54:05] Souls there's something about it that we
[1:54:07] want to stay in tune with God
[1:54:10] Amen we want to stay in his
[1:54:13] presence we want to watch what we do yes
[1:54:17] we want to watch what we
[1:54:20] say not going to be perfect free or or
[1:54:23] perfect you ain't going to be fault free
[1:54:25] or whatever there's one thing about it
[1:54:28] you're going to rise again amen and
[1:54:31] you're realizing that you're influencing
[1:54:33] people thank you how you doen how you
[1:54:36] say how you
[1:54:38] act you're
[1:54:40] influencing they want to see a genuine
[1:54:43] Christian Life out of you amen cuz
[1:54:45] they're in need yeah can you say amen
[1:54:49] for all the time just talking negative
[1:54:51] right
[1:54:53] well I just don't know I just don't what
[1:54:55] what what is the people going to think
[1:54:56] about the word of God that you claim to
[1:54:58] know what what are they going to think
[1:55:00] about the God that you claim to serve
[1:55:03] there is nothing I mean the Bible
[1:55:04] plainly says there's nothing impossible
[1:55:06] with God there's nothing impossible to
[1:55:08] them that believe and then we have this
[1:55:10] negative I just don't think it's going
[1:55:11] to work I just don't know I who is me I
[1:55:14] you know and you have this
[1:55:16] attitude you you're living in a bubble
[1:55:20] so you think you got your head in the
[1:55:24] sand and you're not seeing all these
[1:55:26] others that are influenced by what
[1:55:28] you're saying and how you're
[1:55:31] doing and it's easy for us all to get
[1:55:34] there but we've come to serve prise the
[1:55:39] Lord and our service does not require
[1:55:43] rewards our service does not or should
[1:55:46] not require the applauds of
[1:55:51] men
[1:55:54] our ministry should not come to limit
[1:55:58] its
[1:55:59] limitations to where well you know I'm
[1:56:02] only going to do so much and if they
[1:56:04] don't respond back then it's
[1:56:08] over brother Bram said love that man
[1:56:10] that kill you if he
[1:56:12] could it's true can you say amen amen I
[1:56:16] thought of this um and I'm I'm going to
[1:56:20] close um
[1:56:27] and I well we just talk more about it
[1:56:30] later on if the musicians will come it's
[1:56:34] almost
[1:56:37] one pray that it's a help to you today
[1:56:40] Am
[1:56:44] Lord I want to I want to help I want to
[1:56:48] I want to be such an
[1:56:51] example
[1:56:53] amen I want to be influential to
[1:56:58] others it may not seem we're getting
[1:57:00] anywhere with it but that's that's
[1:57:03] that's that's not up to
[1:57:04] you that's that's between them and
[1:57:08] God
[1:57:10] right we just do all that we can knowing
[1:57:13] that our life here is for a purpose
[1:57:17] Amen brother brandham I I honestly don't
[1:57:20] think brother brandham can considered
[1:57:22] crowds as his
[1:57:25] success if he did he would be one
[1:57:28] discouraged man at the end of his
[1:57:32] life I don't think he considered Fame
[1:57:35] and Fortune right for his
[1:57:39] success I don't think he looked at that
[1:57:41] as
[1:57:42] rewards cuz he would be one discouraged
[1:57:45] man if he
[1:57:47] did I don't think Paul
[1:57:49] did for even Deus he said forsaken me
[1:57:53] but did Paul give up no I'm sure he was
[1:57:56] discouraged I'm sure he went through low
[1:57:58] spots but he kept on because he knew
[1:58:01] that well he knew he had not run in
[1:58:05] vain he knew that he was laying a
[1:58:08] foundation for others brother brandom
[1:58:12] knew that what he was doing was for our
[1:58:14] sake he may have not saw the results of
[1:58:17] it at that point but he knew he trusted
[1:58:21] God
[1:58:22] even if it was for one person brother
[1:58:24] Brandon would have went through it all
[1:58:26] again just for that
[1:58:28] one you know there's songs there's been
[1:58:30] sayings that if it was only for one he's
[1:58:33] Jesus Christ would have still come he
[1:58:36] would have still carried the cross he
[1:58:37] would have still endured the suffering
[1:58:39] he would have still taken the beaten he
[1:58:41] would have still ignored the the shame
[1:58:44] and and he would have never changed the
[1:58:45] situation or the direction of his life
[1:58:49] even if it was for
[1:58:51] one can you say Amen the Lord just keep
[1:58:55] pressing on Amen endure to the end right
[1:58:59] we got souls to win we got Souls that
[1:59:02] need
[1:59:03] help who is who I don't know but we'll
[1:59:06] leave that to God but let's do all that
[1:59:09] we can for the Lord more and more I I
[1:59:13] think I've told you before but I thank
[1:59:14] God while I still got Health in my body
[1:59:17] let me do it let well I still got a
[1:59:19] voice I see others that you know
[1:59:22] there there's one gospel singer that has
[1:59:25] lost his voice a good man sung I mean s
[1:59:28] singing was his passion but he's lost
[1:59:30] his voice and he just doctors there's no
[1:59:33] cure for it and I thought oh
[1:59:36] God as I look at that I thought God that
[1:59:39] could be me let me do all I
[1:59:43] can when you see people that are
[1:59:45] crippled and can't walk
[1:59:48] and I like oh
[1:59:50] God don't don't let don't don't let me
[1:59:53] take it uh just for granted My Liberty
[1:59:56] of being able to walk and being able to
[1:59:58] move and let let let me reach out to
[2:00:02] somebody let me use that for somebody
[2:00:05] you see people that are
[2:00:07] blind I said oh God don't let it be me
[2:00:10] and if it ever did don't don't let it be
[2:00:12] said that I couldn't get my eyes off the
[2:00:14] wrong
[2:00:16] things that that my I use my eyes for
[2:00:19] for for horrible things watching things
[2:00:23] that I shouldn't watch and you you
[2:00:25] understand what I'm
[2:00:26] saying let let my eyes be for this word

[2:00:46] let let him be used to hear the message
[2:00:48] of the hour and not gossip and not the

[2:01:09] it if he takes us home today and I know
[2:01:13] that's so far-fetched
[2:01:14] I think of men like brother Will's Daddy
[2:01:19] for one that just had a massive heart
[2:01:21] attack in the k
[2:01:23] kitchen I thought oh
[2:01:26] God what if that was me what have I done
[2:01:30] for the kingdom did I just sit around
[2:01:33] and pity party did I just sit around and
[2:01:34] moan and groan that I use everything
[2:01:37] that I had to complain and gripe
[2:01:41] and what influence have I left for
[2:01:45] others can you say amen amen I think um
[2:01:49] well let's stand to our feet
[2:01:53] what
[2:01:55] song he wants me to live I want to

[2:03:33] love I can
[2:03:35] never ever out
[2:03:40] love I
[2:03:42] know that can get
[2:03:46] discouraging the old human flesh can get
[2:03:49] discouraging when you just keep hearing
[2:03:51] the the negative and seeing the negative
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:57] and like it just seem like you're just
[2:03:59] not getting anywhere with
[2:04:03] it but oh God if I could just encourage
[2:04:07] you to just keep pressing
[2:04:09] on you don't know what you mean to that
[2:04:12] that lost loved

[2:04:18] what you really mean and how important
[2:04:21] you are
[2:04:22] are to the children that have gone
[2:04:25] astray or to your spouse that maybe is
[2:04:28] not
[2:04:30] saved you don't know what it
[2:04:33] means to your children that you're
[2:04:35] trying to raise up right and the devil's
[2:04:38] trying to attack you in any which way to
[2:04:40] get you to slip and get you to turn
[2:04:42] aside and get you to
[2:04:44] compromise amen oh God if he could just
[2:04:48] open our eyes to see our importance
[2:04:52] don't let the devil build
[2:04:55] complexes don't let the devil build
[2:04:58] things around you to where you get so
[2:05:00] wrapped up in it that you lose sight and
[2:05:04] focus the people on your job need
[2:05:07] you people at your school need
[2:05:11] you the people that you see on the
[2:05:14] streets they need

[2:05:18] need to see a Victorious Life they
[2:05:22] no church they may not see the pillar of
[2:05:25] fire like we can here in the picture but
[2:05:28] they can see what influence that light
[2:05:30] is bringing in your life there's a
