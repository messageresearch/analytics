he boy that's a big big responsibility but we we know he's he can handle it and uh so anyways we love the Lord prise the Lord amen uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord for a moment Lord Jesus we come as your children Lord and we thank you Lord for opening up your word to us more and more in this age and helping us to realize who we are father Lord that we're not just Beggars vagabonds but we are truly your children Sons and Daughters of the king and Lord royal blood flows within our veins and father you've B us Lord to come together that we may commune with you and that you would commune with us father and father we have worshiped we sung the songs Lord and we pray that it would be pleasing in your sight and now as we settle our hearts down and just to Feast on your word we pray that you would just minister to us Lord Feed Us father is our prayer and may your anointing just come and anoint me Lord and help me to get myself out of the way father and may you anoint your people and I pray father just a special blessing upon brother will today and his family and father that you'd give them the strength give them Grace today Comfort their hearts in the days to come father we know that you can we know that you will you promised you would father Lord we just ask you in Jesus Christ's name amen the uh Matthew the 20th chapter and we're going to start at the 20th verse again then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her What wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my son two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able ble to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he saith unto them you shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the 10 heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever shall be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen you can have your seats this morning and then I'm going to read from Philippians 5 and 8-8 uh Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I want to just continue along the lines of the son of man came to minister and um again to minister minister is to serve others um to wait upon others to supply what is needed to care for right it is um so if we're going to serve if we're going to minister that means we have to have something to give and every minister or every member of the body of Christ it it does not matter who um it does not matter the age uh um we're all called to minister within the um office the place that God has called us and um and we must not forget that whether you're a father your mother even grandfather grandmother whether you're a child whether you're Deacon trustee Minister musician singer song leader whether you're the boss on the job whether you're you know the coworker um employee whatever you are God has called you to minister and and so um there's no one that is exempt I just don't I don't believe that um you don't have to be healthy in good health to be a minister you don't have to uh um you know I so anyways um if we're called to minister then we're called to serve the needs of others and to supply the need we're called to wait upon and to care for others then if that be the case then it requires us to be interested in people we got to be interested in People Ministry must be important it must it must be because Satan always wants to cut us off he always wants to get us isolated from others I mean that's just a a trick of the enemy um is if he gets us isolated and we're serving the lord in our own little little cubicle then what good are we uh but we need one another people need us whether we realize it or not and and he's good at making us feel like we're we're just incapable that that that yeah we are of no value that we have no use so why should we even try but that's not true we've got a Ministry if we're part of the body of Christ we're called to minister so you have to uh be interested in people in this this kind of interest uh that I'm speaking of requires us to have a burden for souls and someone asked brother brandom what his main objective in life was and he replied back I have only one objective in life and that is saving souls for Christ he said my highest ambition and only ambition is to see Jesus Christ glorified and I live for that hallelujah amen well that's that's exactly in line with what Jesus came to do for the the Bible says he came to seek and to save those that were lost ain't that right so we cannot this this cannot be achieve without having a burden Ministry is not effective without first someone having a burden for for souls and I've I know you know there there are men who preach the gospel and yet have no burden for Souls there there are people that play music in churches and maybe they holded uh um an office as as a deacon trustee Sunday school teacher or maybe they're they're they're minister or or whatever but yet and they and they they perform their duties as what is required of them yet they have no burden for Souls they're they're performing they're doing they're doing what is expected of them but without a true heart for people people for for souls and and so the the the people of this lay odyssean Church age you know brother Bram talks about it and he says they're burdened all right they're they're burdened I mean that's that's that's the the prophecy of the day is that they're burdened but they have the wrong kind of Burden he says they're burdened with wealth then than and not burden for souls and so this this fits in line with what the IES described of this age now of course we've got great churches big big churches more we've got seminars and seminaries and and you know Bible colleges that are producing more preachers in in the age than probably ever before I guess and we got more churches on every corner than ever before they have their societies they have their programs and they have their they have their own method methods and their working uh of how to get people into the church uh churches you know uh we we got just just in Tulsa Oklahoma alone there's probably five churches with 5,000 to 10,000 people in in in in the church and and so they're doing something right as far as getting people to the church but with no burden for Souls it's amazing isn't it now how you can have all these programs and societies and all that and do all this for for the interest of getting people to church and yet no burden the Bible or the prophet even talked and I couldn't find it I was trying to find it in the office but uh uh brother Bram talks about how that it would be so easy for people to join the World Council of churches thinking it'll be a better way to win souls it's a it's an opportunity to win souls and yet they are leading people right into the World Council of churches leading them to hell and they're doing this for the the sake of souls but no burden for souls and so uh uh true Christians are have a burden for lost souls they they if anyone's going to have a burden for lost souls I mean a real burden genuine it's it's the it's it's a true Christian and this comes by not human love human love would cause you to be interested in people and trying to help people in one way but but Divine love divine love in a man's heart causes a man to have a burden for Souls um in such a way that it produces the ministry that Jesus Christ had right Divine love of course is an eternal love it survives the hurts it survives the pain the scars it seeks no reward and it doesn't seek revenge it doesn't compromise for gain or popularity it doesn't compromise for the sake of having friends it it's a genuine love and and it it causes you know um it well brother Brandon says it's the purest of love there's different loves there's different types of love but all these other loves come from the the the the purest of love and that's Divine love and anything that that's out of that is a perverted love whether it's human love um there's a lust love there's um I don't know there's all kinds of loves that brother Brown talks about but it's all perverted love there's only one pure love and that's Divine love and that's the love of God and and by that Divine Love Comes the ministry of Jesus Christ ain't that right so so this this Divine love looks beyond the fault and actually sees the need and and brother brandom talks about it he's he's showing the different love uh the difference between human love filio love and and divine love agape love and and he says you know uh uh um uh filal love would cause you to hit a man that insults your wife he said and and and you know hey that that that seems to be the right lie the the the the right action and and the right kind of love for your wife but then he says the agapo love divine Love Actually causes you to pray for that man's lost soul now so so brother brandom says a real born again man or woman that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church I'd like to say that again a real born again man or woman that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church so all these people that don't believe in going to church well there you are a real born again man and woman that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church worshiping and crying out and doing all that that's in his life to bring in Sinners certainly if it's God see he says you should put your heart in it if you've got discernment work everybody say work work don't come to church and just set to be ministered expect to be ministered to because people that expect to be ministered to to they all of a sudden they're the ones that finds the fault in the church because they're not being totally satisfied I mean if someone doesn't call them if the preacher don't come and visit them they're going to have their gripes and complaints if if if the musicians don't play it right if the if the song leader ain't doing it right if the deacons if the church and and and and all a sudden they're the people amen that starts finding the faults in in the church because they are need they've come to just be ministered to they don't see the reason why that that that others put effort into into such things there are the ones that don't see why we put effort in tent meetings and and and and they don't see value they want every all the attention upon themselves hello well it's just the truth and and so but brother Ram says you should put your heart into it if you're coming to church don't just sit there then if it's if it's worth something I don't understand why people go to a church and they complain I you know I I just don't there's all kinds of churches go to the church that satisfies you but if you're coming to church and if it's worth it then put your all into it put put effort into it can you say Amen don't just come and expect the song leader to to revive you put effort into it raise your hands unto God sing be be be be do something put effort into the service put effort into your life put effort into the church you may not be the singer you may not be the the the the the the the the musicians you may not be the preacher but you've got something to do ain't that right see so so and and the goal is on anything anything I don't care what what you are called to do is is to bring Sinners into the kingdom of God that's what we want to be effective see so certainly if if it's god let's he says then you should put your heart into it if you've got discernment work don't just go and say yes I believe that that's the truth that's good amen and then go home go to work you you've got discernment work while it's light for the night cometh when no man can work you say Amen brother BR preaches the message several times using the title uh convinced and then concerned if you're convinced about it you'll be concerned if you are convinced that the world is at its end you will be concerned if you're convinced that this message is the only way this message holds the the the key to a Rapture you'll be concerned you won't be just satisfied with your BR brother down the road just claiming to be a Baptist smoking his cigar there's something that calls you cuz you're concerned about his soulen if you're convinced you're concerned can you say Amen if you're convinced that that that the the wrath of God is coming and if you're convinced that the reason why this world is Fallen apart is because it's come to its end and there's only one safety and that's in Christ you'll be concerned you'll be concerned about your family you'll be concerned about your lost neighbor you'll be concerned about your coworker you'll be concerned about everybody you're concerned you get convinced so he says see go to work you've got discernment work while it's light for the night cometh when no man can work work while we've got an Open Door see work while we can have meetings like this see get our loved ones in bring them into the gospel get our friends our neighbors God died for those people and we ought to be concerned enough about them to work till our hand are bleeding we will come empty if we don't amen can you say Amen realize and that you know God saved us I'm glad for that God God redeemed us I'm glad for that it's good to talk about Redemption it's good to talk about who we are it's good to know that God loves us and that we're sons of God but don't forget that God died for someone else can you sayen don't forget that that if we've got the blessings then then as Jesus said freely give freely you have received freely give freely give as you have freely received can you say amen amen don't just hog it all don't be some selfish individual can you say man we've got the greatest message on the face of the Earth and sometimes we get so used to coming to church and we want to be uplifted uplifted uplifted oh if he could just uplift me I'm just feeling so down I'm just so I'm so so bulked down with the world Satan just fighting my mind oh God just let the preacher just preach me happy but what about telling somebody else exactly amen being burdened for Souls means that we are interested in the well-being of mankind Body Spirit and soul we're we're we're concerned for the sick people ain't that right we're concerned amen for mentally ill people we're we're concerned the fact that that that that Satan is is is is is is telling young people convincing them to commit suicide and convincing them putting complexes on people's lives to where they can't even hold their head up anymore we're concerned about these things ain't that right we're concerned about their soul that's that's the greatest interest in our lives it should be about the soul of man more than the health of a man it should be about the soul of a man can you say amen amen that's right see because uh uh uh uh you can do all you can to build that man's that that man's health amen pop the pills give him the best of things and all of that and that man amen eventually he may get he may he may he may get well and he may be doing fine and and all of that but eventually he's going to have to die sometime yeah ain't that right and if he dies amen and that Soul has not been helped amen he'll die lost ain't that right he could have lived healthy all of his life and just die of a car wreck or die of of of some you know something and and even sometimes the doctors don't even know why they died but if that soul is lost then what good does it do I know of a lot of men and women that have been sick and and all of that but their soul is sealed amen and they they know where they're going to me that's the Eternal value so so if we're interested in the soul of man then this has to do that his spiritual well-being we're interested in this his spiritual well-being now the Church of Jesus Christ does not specialize in in their Ministry does not specialize in scientific research the body of Jesus Christ with its Ministry does not specialize in medications we do not specialize in Psychology we do not specialize in Theology and Seminary training we do not specialize you know know uh uh in alcoholic programs and Drug programs and uh uh you know we we don't specialize in establishing uh John 3:16 missions and uh uh uh you know food lines to help the poor and and and and these things and and and we have nothing nothing against any of that we're we're glad that they are there I am uh glad that they have been established to help people in life uh uh there are great doctors um uh and the Lord has used them to help people uh uh no doubt that the John 36 missions have have helped people in in uh in life and and uh uh so many programs and and all that and there are even uh good doctors and all that who are message Believers and that's that's awesome Amen but as the prop that any good doctor will admit that their medication what they do cannot heal people it it takes God to do the healing ain't that right amen see and and and and uh uh all these things so but we're we're not in the business of of getting people reformed that's why we don't have drug programs and alcoholic and uh uh you know things and and all these things we're not about teaching people how to cope with their problems can you say amen amen I think that's what seminars are for is to help people to cope with their problems and and and all of that but this is the commission it's the last commission the greatest commission that Jesus gave us and we all know it Mark 16:15 he said go ye out into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature yes sir you may not be called to go overseas but you got what about that that that that that that employ that needs God what what about that coworker that needs God what about that that that your mate that needs God or or whatever preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned amen and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall uh uh take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover can you say Amen so this is the ministry that the Church of the Living God has ain't that right it's showing that the Church of God has a power more than science can give you more than education can give you there is some Authority that man has not been able to tap into amen see now there is no profession on the face of the Earth that has the ability and the power to help people the way that they need help like the Church of the Living God has there is no school college or university Christian secular whatever that can Empower a man with what you and I have as the Church of the Living God Amen can you say Amen Zechariah 4:6 says not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord not by my not nor by power not by education not by science research not by not not not by man's uh ability but by my spirit sayth the Lord can you say Amen it's the how did you get into the Church of the Living God by his Spirit how was your soul saved by his Spirit can you sayen how did you get Redeemed by his spirit amen who healed the scars and who healed the wounds by his spirit everything it's been by his Spirit ain't that right yes sir see and so then it is the church that has this special Ministry for it's the church that is the Tabernacle of God himself it is the the Tabernacle of deity amen and it's made up of Sons and Daughters of God Amen it's a higher office than than a doctor would have a president would have a king would have any position on the face of the Earth any profession the fact that you have come into the body of Christ by his Spirit you're born into it and you are now Sons and Daughters of God deity living inside of you the prophet said deity is not in heaven it's in you can you say amen that's the highest thing that you could ever achieve I enjoyed brother Terry's message Wednesday night you know and and uh he talked about God becoming incarnate in his church amen and U uh just just a wonderful uh sermon but we we find here uh uh brother brand says Satan is going to uh has incarnated himself from Antichrist to false prophet now and in the days of the Jew is Antichrist amongst the early Church in the Dark Ages he become a false prophet to the world see her there with her cup of iniquity that's to the church age but in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate uh the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what I mean he's incarnate in his people then he's got his people Bound by his power yes that's that's what's happening he's binding the People by his power how he's getting them coming into the World Council of churches there's something that is binding them to it they have no idea what it is but but by God sending a prophet it's opened our illumination it's given us an Insight of really what's taking place in this world it's a power and the false prophet has prophesied them right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe a lie and be damned by it denying the word with a form of godliness ain't that right but notice God works his place in a trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so what are you today as the Church of the Living God you are God it's the Incarnate God in you your body you're the Tabernacle of Jesus Christ that's not a figment of our imagination that's not just a phrase that's actual real ity praise the Lord so today it's the Incarnate Word made flesh amen amongst his people again it's the church that is the branch right where the life of the vine flows through it's the church that the Holy Spirit has the preeminence over it is the church that must be about the father's business it it is the church that God must trust can you say Amen so the mission of the church is to preach the gospel which we know what that means demonstrate the gospel demonstrate the power of God brother Ram said Jesus never did say build big churches no he never never did he say have seminaries I ain't got nothing against churches big churches they're all right I haven't got nothing against seminar they're all right but Jesus never commissioned us to do that he never said big build uh build big churches or have seminaries he never said build hospitals or schools but they're all right remember I have nothing against them but the very principle that he said for us to do we've let down and took secondarily can you say amen amen that's right see we have built great hospitals and schools and great places and seminaries and educated our preachers to make them so that they can speak with very fine swelled words and use the psychology and stand stiff and say amen and just as plight as it can be and all of that and what has it gotten us a bunch of big or a big bunch of backsliding people nothing but a bunch of cold formal indifferent churches as cold as zero weather spiritually speaking can you say amen that's right see so they have emphasized on big they've emphasized there's nothing wrong with big churches you know you know people think that sometimes well if a message you know if if there's a big church in the mess of church they're compromising that ain't that ain't true that's right that that that that ain't true at all amen see that's not what brother brandham is saying that we all got to have a small congregation we all got to have a small thing if God's blessed a man with the ministry that can draw draw people then so be it God bless them for that you understand what I'm saying amen you know as long as it's done the right way sure but but the but but but men have have emphasized on churches amen of of the more the more people the the better they are it's a Prestige thing and and while they're building their B big churches and they have their thousands of people they're compromising on the very word and they're leading souls to hell because they have no burden for Souls Amen brother amen and what they've done they've kicked out the only one that can help them brother Braham says see the American people are so hypnotized with different theologies and the Bible says that' be that way see he said did you know that said when they go from the East and the west north and south seeking to find the true word of God and they failed to find it doctor so and so believes it this way and doctor so and so believes it that way and they kicked out the blood they kick out the atonement they kick out the power they kick out the Holy Spirit you know you know and E even today there there's many churches that kick out the spirit of worship in the church the moment you start getting excited in God you need to settle down they kick out the worship yeah ain't that right amen now you can say Amen to that because you know it's true and they do it in the message churches just as much he says and what they got left what do they have left they they they take out the blood of Jesus Christ out of the Bible to where you haven't gotten no Bible left they take the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of there and you got nothing to preach with or preach on he says Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever don't you never let anybody tell you anything else he's raised from the dead he lives tonight supremely he's here in the building now certainly he is where two or three are gathered in together I'll be in their midst no matter how small the church is or even two or three gathered I'll be there he can not lie amen amen see and so therefore the ministry of Jesus Christ is built upon the power of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen Lord praise the Lord now we find that I would say 99% of churches both big and small have kicked Christ out which is fulfillment of what it says here in Revelations 3:19 Jesus speaking of this leay Odyssey and church age saying behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me brother that's the most pathetic scripture is where Jesus is kicked out of his own church amen been kicked out can you say amen and and and so what have they done they they've turned to education to help their Ministry they've turned to scientific knowledge to help their Ministry they've turned to psychology to help their Ministry cuz they have no power they kicked out the very thing that can help people exactly ain't that right amen and they' they've kicked and and they're substituting now everything else programs and nice things and intellectualism and and all of these things for uh to for the sake of Soul [Music] winning true right now we are called to minister to those who are in need we do not Minister through profession professionalism right yeah we don't Minister through skill we don't Minister through education you don't have to be talented in order to minister you have to find your place that God has called you to be that's the important thing now God uses our talents for his purpose and we are to be our best Lord amen I think we ought to be the best musicians I think we ought to be the best preachers sir I think we ought to do our best amen amen now it all depends what we do say is our best I don't think you need to go to school to to to to be effective as far as you know um um not against learning I just don't think a minister needs to go to school to to to be as best as a preacher ain't that right but I think we ought to be our best if we're going to be a minister let's be our best amen don't just be halfway I I I just you know and and we we'll put it this way you know we we again it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord amen we know that we need the Lord we need his anointing I don't care what we can say in words I don't care how good a man can play I don't music I don't care how good he can sing and all that without the anointing you're nothing amen that's just facts help us ain't that right so we need the spirit why do we need the spirit because we know that that's the only way that can help the people lord it's the only way well I'm just waiting for an unction that's not the point there's many times I get up here without unction come on Brother come on and I'm relying on the Holy Spirit to come sure there's many times that that musicians get up and start playing without unction but they're relying on the spirit of God true it's not our gifts we're not here to show off we're here to play our best we're here to do our best as a preacher but I don't have to be brother Wayne Lawson to be a best preacher I don't have to be an Andrew Glover Donnie Reagan or or Tim PR to be the best preacher I have to be what God called me to be and be my best ain't that right that I don't need to sound like Randy Travis to be a best singer or whatever you your group is some say well thank God for not being Randy well you might like someone else in the gospel group I don't have to sing like George johs or whoever young people probably don't know who joh George JNS is you know that's that's my dad I guess I have to be my best ain't that right that's what I appreciate about brother Kevin trying to get the musicians together be your best sir play together in unison play together in harmony why because there there's something that we're after but more than anything of this more than anything we need the spirit of God ain't that right well then if we know that we need the spirit of God then we can't just be living a halfway life amen amen you understand what I'm saying you know you know uh uh we can't I'm going to take myself as a minister we I I you you wouldn't want you couldn't expect me and I can't expect myself to stay on the phone all the time never study never pray never think of God all the time just wrapped up in in comedy and all the time you know to where you know then all of a sudden I'm starting to look at pornography or I'm starting to look at this and I'm starting to have problems and I'm starting to have all these things and then come up and preach and expect God to bless you understand what I'm saying that there has to be a dedicated life you understand what I'm saying doctors can smoke they can be a drunk and they can do all that and still operate on you and do a good job but we as the body of Christ we're called to a higher goal a higher Ministry we need the spirit of God as long as we have a Spirit of bitterness on us brother BR says it drives the spirit of God away from us how can you minister in Your Capacity the way you need to minister the way God has called us to minister having bitterness hanging on us oh but I I I I help people and I do this and I do that that has nothing to do with it we need the spirit of God to approve of Our Lives is that not what the prophet uh uh uh relied upon Minister said well you don't even know your Bible you can't even say your words right you can't even do that that's what they relied upon here he was a seventh grade educated uh Minister didn't have hardly any of the the the knowledge and the education that them ministers behind him had but yet he relied upon God he stayed in fellowship with God he stayed true to God and God could bless him for that amen he was a servant to the people he came to minister the Lord you understand what I'm saying that's why you ministers keep your keep keep your keep your nose out of the phones it's just true yes sir fathers if you want a if you if you want a home that God blesses keep the movies [Applause] out the Lord can't raise your children on movies can't raise your children on Hollywood amen hello it's what brother Bram said apply the token if you're going to apply the token you got to take things out the token can't be effective true love stories magazines things that are just contradictory to God you with me now we're talking about Ministry it's our job to clean our home up why because we don't want the devil taking our children amen hello well I'm busy at work that's us well that's fine you can be the workaholic and you can provide and your whole family can can can live off inheritance for for 10 Generations after you but what about their soul yes we are called to supply uh uh be the provider as husbands of our homes and and all that but there's more to it you are called to be a minister and that means carrying the burden of your children the burden of your spouse that's right upon your heart but not only that car the burden the burden being burdened for Souls the Lord hello brother Braham said keep your children near you amen keep them close by amen don't let them out there fellowshipping don't let them out there running around with some Tom Dick and Harry out there hello we give our children over to sports right amen the only reason why you do that is because you need a babysitter and you ain't got enough guts to get down and pray for your children how can you pray for the soul of that child and then you give them over to worldly influence amen help us God told you about one time a friend of mine minister went overseas first time going over there to this certain Church met the pastor and got to talking to him and his two girls walked in the minister friend of mine said I caught it right there they were lesbians he I caught their Spirit them two girls are in bad shape so as they he was talking to his the pastor and he asked his pastors what happened to your daughters he's like what do you mean he said they're they're lesbians aren't they the man just started crying I broke down crying he said I tell you what I done he I started letting them play soccer he said I started letting them play soccer not even understanding that their coach was lesbian they started working on My Girls He said now I don't know what to do which of course the the minister friend said well there's a power that can that can break that amen but why let him go to that extent why give them over to things of the world we're called to be a minister people say well I ain't got nothing to do in church you don't have to have anything to do in church what about your family what what about the people that God given you as friends to help to witness to pray for can you say Amen you love the Lord amen we all parents make mistakes I understand that we all make mistakes but I think we should learn from our mistakes I think we should grow hello grow the Lord now you don't have to be talented in order to minister you know uh but we are to be our best but the way we serve the way we serve is by influence by being an influence but our influence is not a carnal thing in other words we're not using our Personality yeah right there's there's if if you use your personality right that's a good thing there's all kinds of men that have stronger personalities than others true and they take that personality and they draw to themselves and they use that to split churches they use that to divide they use that to to bring contradiction and it becomes an ego thing right true true hello it's true our influence should not come does not come just by being fundamental in the scriptures there's all kinds of churches that are fundamental fundamental fundamental right brother Braham talks about balum and Moses fundamentally balam and Moab all that they were right they did everything that Moses done and Israel they had the same kind of altars they had the same kind of this they sered the same God they serve whatever fundamentally they were right but Moses had the pillar of fire right he was anointed of God to lead the people out bam didn't fundamental right true amen now I hope this all right today but Isaiah 60 And1 says arise Shine for thy light light everybody say thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee amen ain't that wonderful thy light is come yeah so this this scripture was a prophecy speaking of this day and age and and and again it's it's a day of night and of Darkness and Light it's a day where gross darkness is covered the people yes and and believe it or not Darkness has an influence a ain't that right Darkness has an influence there there's a there's there's a life that dwells in darkness and it's real there's creatures that dwell in darkness that cannot dwell in light and when the light the Sun starts shining these creatures Scurry when you turn on the light the roaches leaf amen yeah that's right but Darkness has has an influence and brother Brandon would call this Darkness it's the influence of the power of Darkness the influence of the power of darkness and we have to understand there's there's there's a there it's the there's only two influence and that's the power of darkness and the power of God are you with me there there are people that are religious as religious can be and doing everything they can in their societ ities and in their programs and all that Amen to bring people in and yet it's under sitting under the power of Darkness that's their influence and it's influencing them to the World Council of churches it's influencing them into the tribulation it's influencing them and they don't know what it is on now can you say Amen but in the middle of all of this and and the politics and all of these things if you could look at the world today uh uh uh over 99% of the people in the world today is influenced by the power of Darkness they're under this influence amen can you say amen I and and if we could ever really get convinced of that we'll really be concerned but a rise Shine for thy light has come amen the church is not left without influence a rise shine for thy light has come the Lord has risen upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee ain't that right now notice what Jesus said you are the light of the world can you say Amen see we would be in Gross Darkness as well we we are no special uh no different we're common born Flesh and Blood just like everybody else we've got a we we've had to deal with sinful nature we had to be saved just like everybody else and all of these things but by the grace of God in order for us to be the light of the world there had to be a light rise and shine upon us now who is the light of the world brother Ram said the seed of that age that Pro that manifests the promised word the seed of the age now he's talking in in in uh the seed of discrepancy the seed of that age is are those who manifest the promised word for that age they are the kingdom of God the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those of the kingdom of that age can you say Amen now brother Brandon uh uh in in uh well several sermons but he he he says that the Moon is the type of the church ain't that right amen and and and so what is the Moon it has no light of its own but it reflects the light of the Sun and as long as is nothing comes between it and the sun Amen to darken the moon remember when it when when the world passes when the earth passes through between the Sun and the Moon then the moon BLS out true right and so so we we we see that and and and so but but we we find that as long as there's nothing there blocking the light amen then the light uh of the sun shine upon the moon and the moon just reflects radiates the light of the sun amen ain't that right well so the church has no light of her own but she is a reflector of another light so AR rise shine AR rise shine Church in the midst of Darkness gross Darkness Darkness covering the Earth rise and shine there's an influence upon you it's not the influence of Darkness there's a light that is shining a light that is shining upon you well brother brand said well what light is it it's the manifested word of God identified is light the manifested word of God identified is light amen there can be no light outside the word of God can you say Amen so now brother BR said well what is gross Darkness then it's to fail to see the light that's shining gross darkness is is is failing to see the light that's shining can you say amen and and he says this seventh Church age is all smothered out see with Christ on the outside so gross Darkness has covered the people ain't that right but unto you arise and shine you got to shine why how are we going to shine thy light has come God hasn't left us without light how true the scripture is you are the light of the world and God provided the light to shine on you so you could reflect can you say Amen now brother Bram said you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the world above so so every individual sinner or Saint in this Mortal life has an influence amen and it's from either the influence comes from above or from underneath right influence comes from Hell or Heaven and brother Braham says see Mortals are influen from an outside world I should understand by the grace of God I deal with spirits and I should know what I'm speaking of and I I and I look along through this dark mass of gity every once in a while you'll see little lights of Burning Lights see there you are it's your table today lights are burning that's Christians in the darkness giving light see what I mean now look look at this here the The Sinner is influenced by a spirit because he has a spirit and the wrong gives influence and the right gives influence can you say Amen so no wonder the devil is against us no wonder the devil wants to destroy us is because the most majority of the world is uninfluenced of Darkness and and and darkness is influencing the wrong is influencing television is influencing our children amen uh uh uh evil minds are influencing our children technology is influencing uh the people to where there more more more uh uh perceptive and uh uh what more more controlled by by the things of the world and and it's true yes sir that you know I'm I mean just anything is becoming God today right Hollywood sports stars and and and girls and and cars and homes and wealth and jobs all that's becoming God's today they they're under such an influence of Darkness there there's nothing that there's no standards today can you say Amen there's no standards in dress there's no standards in Morality anymore it's becoming common that boys and girls just shack up kiss and and all that when a prophet said just kissing a boy and a girl kissing is is adultery potentially it's an adultery but we give them over to to to and and let let our children be influenced by people that don't don't understand these things boys hugging with girls and all that don't even claim to be husband or or boyfriend and girlfriend they it's just a society today when when a prophet said no red blooded man can whether you're filled with the Holy Ghost or not can genuinely put your hands around another woman and not have sensual feelings you can't do it amen I don't care what they say you can't do it hello but it's become the norm today see why it's a Darkness but in the middle of Darkness there is a light thank God that's burden for that soul there's a light that's standing here that's not saying oh it's okay cuz I want to be your friend so we don't say nothing about it we just let it go come on now we'll let them use the lord's name in vain and don't think nothing of it because we're afraid to hurt their feelings come on come on where's the light at amen we're afraid to say we're a Christian because we we well cuz our life really don't really match up come on so then we become we're afraid to be Hypocrites so instead of just cleaning our life up and proclaiming what we are we just soon not Proclaim what we are so we no one will think we're different if you're the light of this age if you're the light of the world you will be different because you're contradicting the power of Darkness you're showing that Darkness has no right over me has no power over me has no control over me I'm a different person can you say Amen I'm Different not because I got a different personality not because I think more positive than the next guy or because I'm smarter than the next guy it's because I'm a light that Jesus Christ can reflect himself through praise the Lord so he said see The Sinner is influenced by spirit because he has a spirit the wrong the wrong gives influence the right gives influence and those who are dominated from the Blackness and separation are dominated from the underworld of devils see look the first thing he says here when you're going out of this line now he says get this straight here's you know and and I guess he's got a line and he says here's where Mortals live a whole Comm conglomeration is Blackness and darkness but in there in there is little lights placed now and then that's born again uh uh that's Christians that are born again of light you are a light that is set on a hill a candle that is set in the room and gives light to all the room that's what a Christian is among Darkness you're supposed to shine where it's dark the wicked or the unbeliever is influenced from beneath there is a trinity of hell like there is a trinity of Heaven they're influenced evil powers are you with me see and so we as lights in this world of Darkness amen God gives us a burden by a Divine love we got to reach them we got to help them can you say Amen see the moon only influences the Earth by the Light it shines it has the authority and power to control and to exert influence by its light Jesus said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven ain't that right so light has the power to influence just as much as Darkness has the power to influence now Satan the prophet said Satan is doing his best or I'm paraphrasing to kill the influence among the people kill the influence of the word among the People by sewing his seed of discrepancy right yeah right telling him to join the church shake the preacher's hand ah it's okay to take a drink every once in a while long as you just do it you know have self-control you know it's okay God loves all all no one's perfect so you know you you we'll we we'll put a smoking for you and we'll do this and therefore no nothing's preached against anymore so we've allowed the homosexuals transgenders now we allow W boys and girls shacking up amen it's just truth there there why because the preacher is afraid of a meal ticket right that's what brother BR called a meal ticket he's afraid that he if he starts preaching strong then he's going to lose his crowd right and and and and of course no one wants to be unpopular no one wants to be considered the Oddball you know so let's let's just let's just baby everything and and and and while the world is well you know brother Brown talks about you know well Jesus said he gives us power you know to remit sins and who ever sins you remit are you remit are remitted and and these things and he says well the Catholic Church claims to do that but he says the only one that really that has the power to do that is the Church of the Living God and how do we remit the sins by preaching the gospel preaching the word hello do you realize if you hold back on the truth they're going to die be lost hello well yeah well they're good people they baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost though but they're really good people they're just they really love the Lord but do you realize what a prophet said that Devils travel in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost travel in them titles and we know that and don't say anything about it amen hello it doesn't cause us to get on our knees and pray am amen amen hope you understand amen that they kill the influence Jesus said by your by your teaching of traditions Commandments of men you you you have K the effects of the word right amen so so then we understand the kind of influence that we are to have we must know what is Right amen and not just know it but we must speak what is Right amen the Lord ain't that right you love the Lord amen so if we are the if we are if the like the moon then then we must be influenced and I'm going to close but we must be influenced right can you say it with me I must be influenced influenced now you're going to be influenced yes sir but what is going to be your influence YouTube comedy your pet feelings selfishness come on embarrassment ashamed complexes what's going to be your influence remember there's only two influences from above or from beneath powers of Darkness or the powers of God right so a man's got to have Victory amen a man's got to have Deliverance a man's got to have he he's got to have what it takes to give man said well you know I'm I'm just going through it I I I can't overcome the pornography well I understand what you mean I can't either how you going to help that person you're in the same ditch that's right I love the Lord amen amen they come to it well I I don't know what to do with my family my family so broken you know and we just fight and fuss and we just all these things well I know what you mean I can't get along with my wife either what are you doing you're not a light that's right if we're at a point of helplessness how do we help others if if we're at a point that that we have so many comp lexes in our life how do we help [Music] others right are you with me well I don't want to get up and play cuz I'm just bashful but God's giv you a talent amen get over the bashfulness amen let God use you it's not all about you at all yeah but people might not I might make a mistake who cares make all the mistakes you want I ain't going to say everything right when I preach I go home and say man I should have said it better but that's not the point if God can use me that's what I want and I want to be in a place that God can use me I want to be in a place that God can look at me and smile and say that boy's been tested that boy's been proven that he stood the test can you say Amen yes we need God and yes we know we need God hey satan can put comp lexes on us just as easy as he can the next guy but what is the difference we live in the presence of the son amen are you with me now we live in a place that God can have complete control of our lives but you live in a place where you block the presence of God from your life how do you help others amen so wrapped up in the world and wrapped up in this you ain't prayed you ain't read your Bible you ain't listening to tapes you're listening to more gossip and unbelief and everything else you're influenced by nothing else than the presence of God Amen now the prophet said we must live in the presence of God ripen in the presence of God can you say Amen we got a ripen Church the world's getting more dark and more dark and more dark but our experience shouldn't be more dark amen our home shouldn't be more worldly our life shouldn't be more is just so uh infested with with Devils to where we can't even raise hands anymore on no you live in the presence of that light your influence is from the light your influence is a greater than the darkness the prophet says the the light is 10 million times stronger than Darkness how dare we live go a Christian Life like the world would live so defeated so gloomy so we we don't know what to do we're just helpless little creatures then live in the presence of the light God doesn't bring complexes the devil puts complexes on us yes Hees God doesn't bring us into bitterness and and hate the devil does that God doesn't bring us in a position where we can't lift our hands and glorify God the devil does that God doesn't put us in a place to where we isolate ourselves from everybody else and we don't want to talk and we don't want to do that the devil does that amen can you say Amen so it all depends what we're living under influenced by the world now you remember how it is with let's just say with weights or with any kind of exercise it's always hard to live to exercise especially when you're starting out you breathe hard there's one point you I just walk up these steps I'm thinking in my mind Lord just let me let my breathing become stable before they call me you know turn it over to me but the more you exercise and the more you you you you get off the that old weight true you build your muscles you find in yourself you're achieving something amen you you you're finding yourself improving right you're able to do things that you used to not be able to do right sure well that's the way it is with God Amen if we have a burden for Souls there's something about it that we want to stay in tune with God Amen we want to stay in his presence we want to watch what we do yes we want to watch what we say not going to be perfect free or or perfect you ain't going to be fault free or whatever there's one thing about it you're going to rise again amen and you're realizing that you're influencing people thank you how you doen how you say how you act you're influencing they want to see a genuine Christian Life out of you amen cuz they're in need yeah can you say amen for all the time just talking negative right well I just don't know I just don't what what what is the people going to think about the word of God that you claim to know what what are they going to think about the God that you claim to serve there is nothing I mean the Bible plainly says there's nothing impossible with God there's nothing impossible to them that believe and then we have this negative I just don't think it's going to work I just don't know I who is me I you know and you have this attitude you you're living in a bubble so you think you got your head in the sand and you're not seeing all these others that are influenced by what you're saying and how you're doing and it's easy for us all to get there but we've come to serve prise the Lord and our service does not require rewards our service does not or should not require the applauds of men our ministry should not come to limit its limitations to where well you know I'm only going to do so much and if they don't respond back then it's over brother Bram said love that man that kill you if he could it's true can you say amen amen I thought of this um and I'm I'm going to close um and I well we just talk more about it later on if the musicians will come it's almost one pray that it's a help to you today Am Lord I want to I want to help I want to I want to be such an example amen I want to be influential to others it may not seem we're getting anywhere with it but that's that's that's that's not up to you that's that's between them and God right we just do all that we can knowing that our life here is for a purpose Amen brother brandham I I honestly don't think brother brandham can considered crowds as his success if he did he would be one discouraged man at the end of his life I don't think he considered Fame and Fortune right for his success I don't think he looked at that as rewards cuz he would be one discouraged man if he did I don't think Paul did for even Deus he said forsaken me but did Paul give up no I'm sure he was discouraged I'm sure he went through low spots but he kept on because he knew that well he knew he had not run in vain he knew that he was laying a foundation for others brother brandom knew that what he was doing was for our sake he may have not saw the results of it at that point but he knew he trusted God even if it was for one person brother Brandon would have went through it all again just for that one you know there's songs there's been sayings that if it was only for one he's Jesus Christ would have still come he would have still carried the cross he would have still endured the suffering he would have still taken the beaten he would have still ignored the the shame and and he would have never changed the situation or the direction of his life even if it was for one can you say Amen the Lord just keep pressing on Amen endure to the end right we got souls to win we got Souls that need help who is who I don't know but we'll leave that to God but let's do all that we can for the Lord more and more I I think I've told you before but I thank God while I still got Health in my body let me do it let well I still got a voice I see others that you know there there's one gospel singer that has lost his voice a good man sung I mean s singing was his passion but he's lost his voice and he just doctors there's no cure for it and I thought oh God as I look at that I thought God that could be me let me do all I can when you see people that are crippled and can't walk and I like oh God don't don't let don't don't let me take it uh just for granted My Liberty of being able to walk and being able to move and let let let me reach out to somebody let me use that for somebody you see people that are blind I said oh God don't let it be me and if it ever did don't don't let it be said that I couldn't get my eyes off the wrong things that that my I use my eyes for for for horrible things watching things that I shouldn't watch and you you understand what I'm saying let let my eyes be for this word am I could read this word let my eyes be there let my eyes be on things that are Godly let my eyes CU one of these days I might not have these eyes that be used for you can you say Amen let my ears be let let him be used to hear the message of the hour and not gossip and not the Wordly things let my whole being be used for you the Lord hallelujah you love him amen church we don't know when our time is up we don't know when the Lord's going to call us home what have we done with it if he takes us home today and I know that's so far-fetched I think of men like brother Will's Daddy for one that just had a massive heart attack in the k kitchen I thought oh God what if that was me what have I done for the kingdom did I just sit around and pity party did I just sit around and moan and groan that I use everything that I had to complain and gripe and what influence have I left for others can you say amen amen I think um well let's stand to our feet what song he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love I can never ever out love is that your prayer can you sing it now I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love you there's just no I can never ever out love the Lord once again oh I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more give I want to love love till there's just no more love I can never ever out love I know that can get discouraging the old human flesh can get discouraging when you just keep hearing the the negative and seeing the negative [Music] and like it just seem like you're just not getting anywhere with it but oh God if I could just encourage you to just keep pressing on you don't know what you mean to that that lost loved one you don't know you just don't know what you really mean and how important you are are to the children that have gone astray or to your spouse that maybe is not saved you don't know what it means to your children that you're trying to raise up right and the devil's trying to attack you in any which way to get you to slip and get you to turn aside and get you to compromise amen oh God if he could just open our eyes to see our importance don't let the devil build complexes don't let the devil build things around you to where you get so wrapped up in it that you lose sight and focus the people on your job need you people at your school need you the people that you see on the streets they need you they need to see that smile they need to see a Victorious Life they no church they may not see the pillar of fire like we can here in the picture but they can see what influence that light is bringing in your life there's a Radiance there's there's something there that movies can't give you that vacations can't give you that money can't give you that retirement and all the wealth and materialistic things can't give you there's just a there's a there's just something there that God gives a Christian and it radiates it flows keep your life clean keep your life pure keep your thoughts pure don't dwell on negative don't dwell on unclean things don't laugh at unclean things don't don't try to fit in with your co-workers you don't have to be Arrogant with them but just don't don't try to fit in with them don't we don't look for acceptance we've got something that they need amen amen the Lord you love the Lord be so salty the only way I can know that you can be salty is not just having a good personality and laughing with your buddies and laughing and whatever but being so salty and staying in his presence and letting his light reflect from you amen then they'll know that you've got something that they need they got something even though they may be claiming religion and they may be claiming Jesus Christ and all that but there's something about your life that they know they ain't God they may put you through the test they may laugh at you they may scoff you they may whatever but they want to see something genuine Hallelujah so don't fail don't give up don't get to the point you say well what's the use you keep shining that light amen it's worth it all at the End Amen can you say amen hallelujah can we just bow
