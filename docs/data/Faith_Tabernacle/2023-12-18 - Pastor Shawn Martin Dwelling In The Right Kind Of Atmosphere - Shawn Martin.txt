again knowing you Jesus knowing you there is no greater thing you're my all you're the best you're my joy my righteousness and I love you Lord and I love you Lord aren't you glad you know him amen knowing the way Paul was saying that I may know him in the power of his resurrection amen uh the musicians can be dismissed if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians the second chapter amen it's certainly good to be a Christian praise the Lord and um let's see Ephesians the 2 chapter the uh first verse we will start there it says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he had loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen let's just bow our heads father Lord it is an honor to be able to know you and we certainly couldn't know you without you first revealing yourself to us father may we never take this for granted Lord there's going to to come a time when we will gather here for our last time we'll sing Our Song here in this Mortal life for the last time we'll raise our hands in this Mortal body for the Last Time Lord and we want to do all that we can while we're still here father May our hearts yearn Lord just to know you more father may you come in a special way this evening bless what simple words we would have father multiply it Lord as you did the The Fish and Loaves Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening and the um I guess the my uh thought would be living in the right kind of uh atmosphere and I want to read this scripture from the Amplified Bible and um but it says and you he made alive when you were dead slain by your trans trespasses and sins in which at one time you walked habitually you were following the course and fashion of this world uh were under the sway of the tendency of this present age following the prince of the power of the air you were obedient to and under the control of the demon spirit that still constantly works in the sons of Disobedience the careless the rebellious the unbelieving who go against the purposes of God among these we as well as you once lived and conducted um ourselves uh in the passions of our flesh our Behavior governed by our corrupt and sensual nature obeying the impulses of the Flesh and the thoughts of the Mind are Cravings dictated by our senses and our dark imaginings we were then by Nature children of God's Wrath and Hees of his indignation like the rest of mankind but God's so rich in his Mercy uh because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which he loved us even when we were dead slain by our own shortcomings and trespasses he made us alive together in fellowship and in Union with Christ he gave us the very Life of Christ himself the same new life with which he quickened him for it is by Grace his favor and mercy which you did not deserve that you are saved delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ salvation and he raised us up together with him and made us sit together giving us joint seating with him in the Heavenly sphere by virtue of our being in Christ Jesus the Messiah the anointed one I thought that uh that was pretty powerful and it it actually describes uh really our day and and the the uh where we are because we are seated with him in an Heavenly atmosphere and I'm not going to to keep you long but um I think every part of the word is so important to to us and amen if there's ever a time that we need need to know and I think we should want to know uh what we need to do in life uh it's it's now we we should we want to know I I I I God forbid that we would be just churchgoers of all of our life without really understanding the power and the depth of God's love to us and and the inheritance that he has given to us um and and so we want to we we want to know these things and and so uh brother brandham he he talked about the church he said the Church of the Living God is the pillar of truth of the truth amen and and so then uh uh if truth is going to be proclaimed it's by the Church of God uh it's by the body and and so truth is established uh by it being fulfilled in the church there there there's the written word but then this word must must come to pass it it must be carried out and and so we know that this is the script and and and there's people that are going to be the actors uh in this day for the the word to be fulfilled and so so we are not in interested in writing a Bible this it's already been written but we want that written word now to to live in us to be thoroughly Vindicated that it is right we got so many Skeptics today and unbelievers and scoffers and that don't believe in the promises of God don't believe that God is ex exists don't don't believe in a powerful Church don't they don't believe don't understand don't don't accept it and and while they're denying all this God has a group of people that is vindicating this written word by it fulfilling through their lives and so what God said it now it comes to pass in and by and through the church it it it must and so brother Bram said see God intended this church to be a powerful church not a defeated church not a hopeless church not a beggarly church but a powerful church that means you that means all of us here if we're part of that church we are meant to be powerful Hallelujah and he says a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of Christ well expected and espouse and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the lord well I I I believe he's going to have that church I I truly believe that and it's going to be it's going to be a minority it it that church is going to be minority but but and it may not be accepted by presidents and kings and and governments and Bishops and Cardinals and whatever else it may not be that way but God's going to present it yes he will and he's going to be so well pleased with it that he will present it to Christ and I'm so glad to be part of that church and and to be to to be this church would would mean that we are a word church a word bride that every promise that he fulfilled or or declared in this book has been fulfilled by US in US and through us and I I think that's powerful so since since the time of Luther uh the the the the church has been maturing it's it's it's steadily M maturing coming up the life has been coming up coming up and and um uh so in in the last three stages of uh the church ages uh the last three Church ages we've come through three stages of restoration and and uh uh this is God restoring to the church what Satan has has taken away and and and so we we know them things uh by the um um the restoration of the brigh tree and other places but but the the third stage of course was the pentec age but now we're living in that fourth stage brother Brandon plainly taught the fourth stage there is no three stages of restoration there's three stages to a new birth but there's no uh there's four stages to a restoration and we are living in that fourth stage of Life restoration of Life which as we said this morning and and uh is the token it's the personal life of Jesus Christ and and brother brandham said say that you know this is the age of life and he's the Dynamics he's the quickening power and and he's come in this day to Quicken that that word seed do you believe that amen and so uh uh the age of life which is the personal life of Jesus Christ vindicating the promised word in us and so it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in the body of Christ in US aren't you glad to be part of that amen and so as as individuals as the church has has has gone so as as we as individuals are are ripening we're we're growing uh in the word and and and and this is why we come to church is to grow in the word and to grow in our experience and uh Christian experience with God and grow in our fellowship and and with God and uh relationship and see we don't come to uh uh come to waste time we're not wasting time by our gathering and and we're we're we're we're you know just uh uh what whatever there you know the Bible says that judgment begins at the house of God so so this is why we coming is is for a judgment and and and you know uh the prophet talked like if you know if we were going to go to court and and you know for trial well there's a book of the law that we would be judged by amen that's what makes the whole trial worth anything is there is a book that that judgment comes from amen and and so uh uh so is it uh uh that the house of God Amen we take our judgment by the word of God by this word ain't that right amen and how precious it is to us we want to be judged by that word amen because it's by that word that we find out what is lacking in our lives we we we see what we need to be in Christ we see you know uh what we maybe need to give up or need to hold on to or uh uh you know and and and and all of these things uh and it's not a condemnation to us but it's actually a Grace that we could come amen and be actually or let's say accurately judged amen by the uh the the book of of of God's word ain't that right amen see so uh uh and so what what we're doing is it's it's actually the word seed that is ripening in the presence of the sun this this ripening that we're going through it's it's nothing to do with the perfecting of the flesh uh we we all have our ups and downs and our issues and things that we we we we we deal with on an everyday basis and and that's just the carnal man and things and and brother Brown said you know as as long as you live in this body you're going to have a sticky nature and that's just the way it is but so we're not we're not perfecting that but we there there is that word seed that is ripening and we are becoming more powerful not as mortal beings not in the sense of Flesh getting our Bazookas and and and things like that if they take away the guns we're still a powerful church if if they take away all of our rights we're still a powerful Church no matter what they do it it has nothing to do with this literal natural substance we are still a powerful church because and and that's what's ripening that's that's what we're coming into amen is is this ripening so now uh uh it's the word seed and and that word seed can only grow in the right atmosphere ain't that right so so like brother Brown said you can lay a seed out out there in the ground and no matter how much uh that seed is gerti and and layeth there it's got to have an atmosphere to make it live it's got to you believe that no matter what that word is inside of you it's got to have an atmosphere for that word to live Amen to to mature so he said see that sun has to come to a certain power before uh uh to bring it it can bring that seed to a certain atmosphere see uh to bring it to a certain atmosphere for that seed so I I can we can I think all can truly say and believe that the Sun s so n has come to that certain atmosphere to where the sun is is shining in its full string to bring that word seed within you and I Amen to its Harvest Time to full maturity we're living in Harvest do you believe that so so every word that has been laying dormant in this Bible that speaks of the bride of Christ is now now being made flesh in you and I we're we're not going to be lacking amen uh uh in these promises we're not coming up short see so so what is it that this s so n that that that the the the presence of the Sun the the the revealing of the sun is bringing the right kind of atmosphere to bring forth a har crop do you believe that and so it it's amazing what an atmosphere does and and brother Brandon does talk a lot about atmosphere and and and and we we we know the importance of it but you know he he he talks and and maybe some of you have tried it about an egg you you can get an uh an egg of a whatever and you can put it in any kind of atmosphere put it under a pup and keep that you know that pup down tie him down enough or what ever and and to where there's an atmosphere there and that egg will hatch under a pup or whatever SE and and so uh brother Brown said see any seed everybody say any seed any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition and the right atmosphere so we want to know that we have the word seed how many believes you have the word seed it's a predestinated seed if you have the word of seed uh the word seed in your heart then then you you know that every promise in this book is mine every promise I don't have to beg God for it don't have to plead for it don't have to say man I I'll wait for another day for it no no no it's in you it it's in you and this is the time for ripening this is the time that the word takes flesh in you that it now begins to take hold in in you can you say Amen we we've looked at them days we uh uh and and Jesus said if you say to this Mountain be thou removed be doubt not in your heart you all know the scripture it's in this day it's time it's time for this scripture to be made manifest it doesn't only just belong for a prophet absolutely not amen I believe it belongs to the body of Believers amen I just believe that so this is just where we're at see and so uh uh any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right atmosphere and the right condition we know that there is a wrong wrong atmosphere and there's a right atmosphere brother Bram talks about it if you're going to go do a dance and and you're want to have a good time you know I've never been to one you know but uh I've passed by you know where people are dancing and they're playing that music and the strobe lights and all of that and and you know you look in there and and they're they're they're having a wonderful dark you know and and then they got these neon lights and stuff and and things like that but brother Brown said see if you're wanting to go in them places and you're wanting to dance and have a ball you got to have the right atmosphere right and he says see if if if in if if you're going and then then someone in there says well I don't know if I'm going to dance or not I I don't know you know and and you get people like that well that that's not going to create a right atmosphere said then you get the the the musicians and they're playing near my God to thee he says he chose that song near my God to thee you know and you're wanting to have a dance club and you're wanting to go out and party well wrong music for that type of atmosphere right so so uh uh you know so so brother Brown said see it's not creating an atmosphere for a dance he said the only way to bring an atmosphere for a dance is some put some music that makes dance see then you put the people in the mood for dance you're creating an atmosphere then something's going to happen then those that are expecting to have a dance party they're going to come into this atmosphere and fulfill amen everything that they've been expecting amen see so he says then it gets everybody to thinking about what a good time they're going to have at the dance party just dancing and carrying on why it's the right kind of Atmosphere for it ain't that right so he says now put the right kind of a uh a music on the on the piano the organ and everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus is there and is going to meet everything that they have need of something will go and take place he said because it's the atmosphere ain't that right amen see so then then it's not all about just us coming to church believeing God sent a prophet and hearing the word of God and all these things we've got to have the atmosphere for it this is why we got the music this is why we got the singing this is why we got everything it's to create an atmosphere this is why we worship worship this is why we encourage people amen you to come to the house of God a little early amen and and get get your mind off of everything and focus in on the word of God and and and train on the thoughts of God and and come expecting God to do something because you're creating an atmosphere for all things to become possible now I know these things we all know these things but it's just to remind us that that if if we are expecting this word seed to grow there's got to be an atmosphere for growth do you believe that amen that's right see so now the prophet said the hardest thing to do is getting people in the atmosphere of worship that he said that's the hardest thing is getting the people in the atmosphere of worship in the atmosphere of believing amen but see we we've got a message amen we we've got the word of God we've got the the seals have been open we've got the greatest message on the face of the Earth that it should not be hard for us to enter into an atmosphere amen but I think a lot of times it is is because things get common to us we get into an everyday life and a pattern and a ritual and things like that and then on top of that we've got so much entertainment amen and and and and you all know what the prophet said about it so many voices out there that is is drowning the voice of God Amen to where the voice of God is becoming foreign to us but see the voice of God is real the word of God is true it's powerful how many believes it's powerful it's powerful for any situation amen see now brother BR said see so so the hardest thing to do is getting the people in the right kind of uh uh in the atmosphere of worship in the atmosphere of believing and he said this is why a Divine Life uh is called and set aside as being a fanatic and crazy to the general public amen see um uh not not everybody understands the the real true way of a Christian Life and and so it's it's becomes fanatical it becomes holier than thou you know the thought of these things and it set aside as something weird you know and and brother Brown said the reason why is because you've changed Dwelling Places you went from one atmosphere to another atmosphere and I like that how he puts that Dwelling Places it's it's not just a a second thing an hour thing a monthly thing it's it's a constant thing you're you dwelling from you went from dwelling in this atmosphere to now dwelling in another atmosphere right amen and and and is the word the seat one of these seat one of these atmospheres is going to produce something you know it it it's going to produce something and and so you're dwelling in this atmosphere there there are so many people billions of people today and you all know it as well as I do that that are so negative negative negative negative you hear the negative on television uh whether it's in it don't matter where it's at newspaper uh news um uh but it's just constant negative and and and it's it's a negative atmosphere they're Negative they produce a negative atmosphere an atmosphere complaining an atmosphere of griping grumbling and and uh an atmosphere to where people dwell in a dis despondent it's it's they dwell in a despondent atmosphere and in other words that word despondent is hopeless it's a it's a they dwell in an atmosphere to where they're they're hopeless it's despairing it's just you know and and and they they they they live in a in a world an atmosphere where the the the the glasses half empty you know and and and and and so uh you know and and this is what the world is producing today it's it's just it's it's just a an atmosphere of Gloom an atmosphere of Doom and an atmosphere of of all of these things well you know and and and to be honest just just put it simple it's an atmosphere of unbelief it's an atmosphere of unbelief where faith is slow they they they've turned down the word of God they turned down the promises they've turned down anything positive that God had for them they've turned it all down and and and when you turn that down when you shun that when you look away from the promises and Redemption and and all that to something else you're going to look to Doom and Gloom and and hopelessness and despair and that's where people are living and and so no one really seems to have happiness and joy and and and and a lot of people claiming to be Christians going to church but but it's not it's it's an atmosphere they're living in and the word seems so distant from them it's it's almost like the the the the the the donkey chasing the the carrot all day you know and the carrots out there and he's chasing and he's exhausted but it's never coming to you know completion it's they're never connecting you understand what I'm saying well it's the atmosphere the word is powerful the word is is supreme the word can override anything do you believe that it can override the lawyer it can override the judge it can override the the banker it can override the the any situation that you're going through the word can but it takes an atmosphere for that word to to to be exercised in to the power that it is see God can't dwell in in an atmosphere of unbelief he can't he can't dwell in an atmosphere of grumbling and complaining and and and and when when there's just constantly being voiced of well I don't know if it's ever going to work and I just don't know and and you know uh uh uh you know the doctor says this so we might as well just put up with it I I don't know you know I think my little kid is a little devil you know and and and and and I don't don't know what's going to happen to them I don't know I'm doing everything I can and they ain't getting we you know and and what you're doing you're living in an atmosphere you're creating atmosphere for where the devil can just have Heyday with anything he wants to with you see because the word can't have preeminence in the atmosphere you're creating can you say Amen so God can't dwell in it the word seed cannot grow in an atmosphere as that see so to to go from dwelling in in that kind of atmosphere to dwell in in an atmosphere of Faith then you you you actually live in a totally different world uh uh or and in a totally different environment amen and then that's what makes you strange why while someone can look at the glass and they can explain to you why it's half empty you can explain to them why it's half full see and and and and it is it's just the atmosphere two atmospheres in the same room even but but it's it's in the world that you're living in see so a person who has faith is so different from a person who has unbelief they look at things differently they talk about things differently even talking about the same subjects even amen you can talk about your your your child's sickness and and and one person can have faith in and say well God's going to heal that individual I just know it God's God Is A Healer and then the other person that that lives in an atmosphere of unbelief well the doctor says I I just don't know I I you know he's had this for a long long time you're talking to the same guy the same subject the same everything two different outlooks because one is living in an atmosphere of faith and the other one is living in an atmosphere of unbelief it's true now amen see so so their their outlook on life or or the situation that they're in is totally different one from another it's because one lives in an atmosphere of faith and the other one lives in an atmosphere of unbelief you see the negative becomes realityy Amen to those who live in in uh uh the atmosphere of unbelief that's right that's why brother Brown said if you come to find negative in the church and something to criticize you'll find it ain't that interesting that that two people can come and see two different things and find two different things in the church one is is coming to criticize and they find every reason and it's justifiable reasons to them in their mind why to criticize why the other one come just to see God and he sees God and he has justif justifiable reasons as to why God is in there in his presence and he receives it amen and both actually get what they've come looking for amen but it's the atmosphere can you say Amen see so so the negative becomes reality to those who live in the atmosphere of unbelief whereas the positive becomes reality to those and I say positive I'm not talking positive thinking I'm talking about every word of God amen it becomes reality to those who live in an atmosphere of Faith you don't look how long it's been you don't look how desperate the situation is you don't look at the impossibility you're just looking to God's word and watching that word become reality amen see God can work in an atmosphere of faith God works in an atmosphere amen of of belief ain't that right well the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe so see the right kind of atmosphere brings the supernatural Among Us that's right it's because the ones who believe create an atmosphere of Faith amen that's why all things all things are possible to them that believe if you're having heart issues all things are possible if you can just believe it you're having you know uh mental problems all things are possible to them that believe you're you're you're up against the wall where all things are possible to them that belief you see the word of God will never change God has done everything possible to let you know and to let me know that he'll never fail upon his word but now now it's up to you to create the atmosphere What atmosphere are we going to live in I I understand I understand the doctors don't always agree with the way the word of God says but we will agree with the word of God I understand our own symptoms our own our own bodies doesn't always agree with the word of God our own bodies will tell us well you'll always have this you'll always be in that situation you'll always be blind you'll always fight arthritis you'll always fight hard condition well the word of God says I don't have to so but it all depends on what atmosphere you live in can you say Amen see so we we find that when Jesus went and and uh uh Jas came up to him and said my my daughter's dying and and I need you would you come and lay hands on Jesus said sure I'll come well as they went uh servant comes says trouble not the master your daughter's dead and Jesus said but if you if thou just can believe it'll be all right so he said come on you know let's go they got in that house and what did Jesus mean but scoffers and uh scorners and people that just did not receive him here was the resurrection in life here was the God of all Heaven he had come purposefully to raise that girl up amen but here was the scoffers here was the unbelievers they didn't believe in it they just like today ain't that right he has come purposefully to raise a church up to resurrect can you say Amen to show forth his resurrection power amen but Jesus could not raise that girl up with all of this atmosphere of laughing and scorning and unbelief so he kicked them out he got unbelief on the outside amen to where it was just him jaras amen and his his lovely wife amen and brother Brown said there was an atmosphere of Faith right there he got the atmosphere of unbelief away from him amen and he was able to raise that child up from the dead the power of Resurrection was made a reality in the right atmosphere do you believe that you know brother BR said when you you get around where there's arguments you get in that type of atmosphere see if there something in the church someone who's disobedient acting very ugly in the church and causing trouble you'll never be able to have a Revival as long as that kind of atmosphere is around ain't that amazing it's the atmosphere the word of God can be preached the same word the promises all these things but it's the atmosphere amen so sometimes God gets that unbelief out to where he can start actually moving hello amen that's right see so we are every one of us now we as we read we've been raised up as Sons and Daughters of God this is not an incident this is just not a or coincident amen uh uh something that just happened that Christ deliberately took you who were a nobody who who who was walking after the course of this world who who was walking under the same influence in the same atmosphere of this world and he brought you out he saved you he he delivered you and he raised us up to sit with him in Heavenly atmosphere Heavenly places can you say amen amen now you think of that because he's going to use you Amen to display his word he's going to use you Amen to display his power amen the same power that raised up Lazarus from the dead think of that that power is in you the power that's going to raise us up out of here and to transform our bodies that power is living inside of you you don't need new power amen all you need is to create an atmosphere of Faith amen faith is what's going to make this thing work Faith amen is going to get us out of here faith that atmosphere is going to change this vile body it's going to Hallelujah see so we've been raised we've been raised in an atmosphere so so what that means is is you and I have a responsibility say we have a responsibility yep we are responsible for creating an atmosphere we are responsible for creating the right atmosphere you see we're living in Le osia and I know I understand you think well Heavenly places I sure don't feel Heavenly create the atmosphere is that right well I live in Le odyssea I'm tired and and I I just I got so many F just AES and pains and and oh just everybody around just ugly looking and and you know and then you look at the filth and you look at all the unbelief you're talking about atmosphere they create this atmosphere all around but you know what that atmosphere is look at what that atmosphere is breeding homosexuals transgenders rebelliousness it's it's it's it's it's it's breeding things that atmosphere why the devil's able to have Liberty it's he's the god of the world now he's able to create his at his Eden through their unbelief he's able to do things through their unbelief the atmosphere that they created gives him the Liberty you create the atmosphere of a Heavenly atmosphere and Satan's power will be limited that's right it'll be limited so see you you you you look at all these things well the people of Leota they're they're creating their own atmosphere see and and and it's an atmosphere of unbelief and and we all know that because God would send a prophet they kicked him out they kicked the word out they kicked the revealing of the son they didn't want nothing to do with all of that they called it whatever they wanted to call it you know they they they called it mind reading mental telepathy psychology and yada Yad yada and and and and and Satan Was preparing the people for this time you know through all these denominational teachings and all that and then when God come to reveal himself they didn't want it because it was against their ideologies of what they've accepted as the truth ain't that right so now they're living in an atmosphere of unbelief and they don't know how to stop it kids are going to school shooting their teachers and and and they don't know how to stop it oh get rid of the guns no it ain't going to work it's an atmosphere it's an atmosphere can you say Amen you see if you don't believe the word of God there will be an atmosphere on the other side that Satan will be able to torment you he'll be able to afflict you he'll be able to bring you to an early grave if he can help it you you understand what I'm saying he he'll he'll he'll do everything he can to destroy you but here we are in this leot ofy and age have been lifted up and given that ability given the power to create our own atmosphere and it's a Heavenly atmosphere yes sir that's right we as sons of God are not to live in that atmosphere that they live in we are not to create I hope you understand stand we're not we're we're not to create the atmosphere that LE Odyssey has been creating see they're creating it by denying the words where do they go so they go to the doctors doctor says you're going to die oh really I'm going to die that's all they have that's right because they've rejected the promise of God Amen right so they have no ability to create anything else they've allowed their televisions to come in that's and it's created an atmosphere right it has so bombarded their minds that they don't know what to do what else do we do that's right amen they they they've projected broken homes so much through the television that now everybody's true having broken homes it it it it's created an atmosphere right but we're not to create that atmosphere we're Believers yes sir God sent the pro Propet with the word that you could create a different atmosphere when your your child is sick and this is not psychology this is just believing the word of God when your child is sick and you don't know what to do about it don't just sit there and just dwell on that thing and speak negative take God at his word you don't have to be that way hello yeah but you you don't understand and that's that's the thing when you speak the positive things people get offended by that like you're being insensitive well I'm not going to sit there and create an atmosphere with you I'm not going to sit in that atmosphere of unbelief you want to live like that you want to be like that that's up to you that's right be that way be sick all your life be a sickly person that's right but you don't have to be just don't have to you don't have to be depressed you don't have to be beat down you you don't have to carry these things create the atmosphere God has given us his word to create the atmosphere amen can you sayen if if we're not careful we'll let the devil just again beat us down to to the point that we conduct ourselves like the world we conduct ourselves like like everything else people are ending their lives by suicide because they're in an atmosphere of despondency and don't think the devil will try to get you into won't try to get you into that place he will he does it he does it all the time but we refuse to live in that atmosphere we refuse to take God at his word over anything or we we accept God's word and refuse to accept anything else so brother Bram said the the word seed of God cannot grow in the atmosphere of knowledge and wisdom it just can't see so so the realities of God cannot be made made made known in in that kind of atmosphere it's the atmosphere of Faith everybody say it's the atmosphere of Faith atmosphere faith that the word can only grow in it's it's the realities of the word is not so far from you that you can't reach it's just the atmosphere of Faith amen amen you love the Lord so as I said we're we're living in in the age where the whole word of God has been restored to us and he the quickening power is here it's it's here to make that word live within you and I so we're we are past the age of dissecting the word we're past the age of arguing the word we we are past the stage of trying to believe the word ain't that right that's right we are the true word bride that's right perfect Faith coming to a perfect Faith where it's the word over everything yeah and so the prophet would call us The Virtuous bride of Christ we are virgin to the word yeah other words our womb is not open to anything else outside the word of God remember Eve's womb was she was to accept the word that's what her womb was for was to accept the word to receive word seed but she didn't she received other seed but God's got a bride in this age can you say amen and and so if you notice it's the atmosphere of faith that that kind of atmosphere is the only atmosphere that Christ can hang around you know we read the scripture of where he speaks to the the Fig Tree and I'm closing but he fix he he he he he goes to the F tree gets something wants to get something to eat there ain't no fruit so he curses it he goes into town to Jerusalem and then we read the next day he comes out of Jerusalem and and brother Bram said you know why he he left early is because he goes there and he says and they were fussing at him arguing with him and he just couldn't stand it he just didn't like that atmosphere so he goes out see it's the wrong kind of atmosphere so he loves to be around Believers because they're able to create the right atmosphere that he can stay in can you say Amen you love the Lord amen now as if the musicians will come he says and I want you to be sure now he says watch real close God promised Eve the time would come when the word would be restored by her seed this word itself would become seed and when they give her a substitute she held that substitute and when the word come to her what did she do she didn't want it it was too humble didn't look right to her wasn't polished enough a stable oh my see a guy like that not a day and skew well I I can't accept that see that's no Messiah see a guy let guys kick him around like that and then call that Messiah let let them put a rag around his face then hit him on the head see and he called himself a prophet a real Prophet would raised up see he said see so he goes on down he saids now God promised spiritual leave at Pentecost and told it even before it happened see 400 years before the church ever fell that they would fall away and they would do what they've done but he promised in the last days he would send the word again aren't you glad for that something that he has promise has now been fulfilled we have the word man we're living in this day so we're not studying Creeds of man anymore we're not studying traditions of the church anymore doctrines of the church or whatever you want to we're not studying that no more we are studying the legal book of God the legal Promises of God that are that that that is our legal rights legal inheritance the word of God can you amen the lamb has opened the book it has been read it has been explained by the seventh angel messenger we have found out that through this reading of the book we Are Heirs of God we are HS to every promise we are heirs to the power of God God heir to the supernatural of God we are Heir not only to everything that God has but we're air to everything that God is we are the bride of Christ can you say amen amen it's here it's it's at our it's it's at our fingertips it's been given to us it's handed to us brother Beal it's the right atmosphere that we are to create to let that word now have the positive impact fact Upon Our Lives amen isn't the Lord wonderful to us yes sir he said see he said uh each one of you is a Creator did you know that each one of you people that's born again is a Creator and we must create an atmosphere another place you got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it see they were all in the upper room with one Accord and when suddenly there came a sound as a uh Came From Heaven as a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind the atmosphere was right it takes

if there's ever a time that he would like for us to create a different atmosphere I remember you know brother Bram you all know brother Bram talking he comes home of course you know they had company all the time uh his wife was just their house was just a kind of a traffic place and uh for people to come getting interviews asking for prayer camping out on their yard you know and staying all night

is just crying he went over there and he just hugged her begin to Pat her she's just telling bill I can't stand it anymore I don't know but as he's just ping just praying God do something God bring peace and he said what was I doing I was creating an atmosphere see Satan was trying to wreck his home Satan was trying to get his wife to lose her mind but he began to create an atmosphere before you knew it tears dried up the kids quit quit screaming and crying and fighting the whole atmosphere he said changed amen I thought of that and here he is telling us that we have that ability to do just
