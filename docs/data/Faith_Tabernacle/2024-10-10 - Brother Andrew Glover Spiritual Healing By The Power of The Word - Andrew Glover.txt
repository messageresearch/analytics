Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you this evening father it was in the cool of the evening that you would come down and Lord you would fellowship with Adam and Eve there in the garden father you would ask them Lord how they enjoyed their stay on Earth that day and Lord you would talk to them and father they would commune back with you and Lord we know the things that's transpired and caused the separation but Lord in the last days you would send a cross and the blood and Lord you would you would make a way that man could be reconciled back into your presence and Lord you would send a prophet in this generation that would say to the church our souls are now back communing with you father we've come here tonight for one purpose and that is to fellowship with you and Lord to lay aside the things of the world the cares of life the situations of the day or the things that we're facing this week and Lord just to entertain your presence and Lord to receive from your presence and Lord as I just heard your Prophet said today you said he how he said that the word would begin to be spoken and Lord as that word was spoken father Lord we would begin to change our thoughts from the negative to the positive and Lord I pray tonight as we would Endeavor to look into your word may your great anointing come Among Us Lord You' seen every hand that was raised father I pray Lord that you would move on that need upon that situation and Lord as your word Goes Forth Lord May that word influence the the thoughts from the negative to the positive and Lord may we be transformed here

suffering in body Lord sick in body I pray you would send healing to their bodies those that are traveling Oh God lord May the angels of God encamp around found them Father and Lord may you return them back to the fold at your appointed time now Lord we we commit this meeting tonight in thy faithful hands move Among Us in a special way and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen The Book of Psalms the 107th chapter I want to read one verse there and then we'll turn to the book of Acts the 10th chapter but in Psalms 107 and verse 20 the Bible says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions amen I love that he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions now in the book of Acts the 10th chapter the book of Acts the 10th chapter I've spoke out of this passage of scripture many times but it's very it's very special to my heart in Acts chapter 10 and verse 36 David there're writing in Psalms 107 he says that the word was sent and here in Acts 10:36 the Bible says the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all now that word I say ye know which was published throughout all Judea and begin From Galilee after the baptism which John preached now we know that John preached the baptism of our Lord Jesus but watch verse 38 how that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost amen I'm thankful for the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good now watch this and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight amen to speak to here in if I would take a title I want to speak to you on spiritual healing by the power of the word amen spiritual healing by the power of the word uh maybe just to lay a foundation here I want to read a quote the prophet of God speaking speaking of Jesus baptism on the River Jordan and then he begins to speak about the dove that descended and he says here now when he came down upon him he become the anointed one the Messiah how many believes he was the Messiah he said then we find out then that Temptation in the Wilderness he said but immediately returning from his temptation he went about Healing The Sick casting out Devils setting the people at Liberty he said now let's see them the first thing he did amen was start preaching the gospel Healing The Sick all those amen that were oppressed of the devil so right after amen Jesus was baptized filled with the spirit he went about preaching the gospel Healing The Sick and casting out the devil now you all know the first name that God appeared to Us in amen was Jehovah and brother BR said I I believe the first name God Amen the word ever appeared in was I am the Lord that Health thee he said taking away all the sickness and things from je from them amen Jehovah Rafa he said Jehovah Gyra amen was the provided sacrifice and Rafa amen was the Lord that Health thee brother man establishes something here he said God is the Healer how many agrees God is the Healer he said Satan cannot heal when you see the sign following the spirit of healing and blessings of God you realize that's coming from God so don't misjudge it judge God rightly he said and may the Lord Jesus tonight appear Amen in this Auditorium in the resurrected power of His being amen I believe tonight that he is here but he's not here in the form that the world is looking for him to be here in but he is here in the form that he promised to be here and that is the power of his resurrection now amen you know that when you catch that spiritual revelation of his presence not here yesterday or will be here tomorrow but his presence amen that is here right now amen I believe that that releases an understanding to us amen that if his presence is here then healing is here if his presence is here amen then Del Deliverance is here brother says it very beautiful he said see if he is not here amen that he said something that he cannot back up he said we got a spirit ual Revelation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said his power is here now his spirit is here now his healing is here now his salvation is here now everything that we have need of Amen is right here now the Holy Ghost is moving on the building right here now he said that would save every sinner that would baptize every believer amen and that would heal every sick person so the presence of God Amen that's here right now now has the ability Amen to save every sinner to heal every sick person amen and to deliver everyone that's bound because Jesus said Upon This Rock Amen I will build my church and the Gates of Hell amen cannot Prevail against it he said oh my I feel like preaching oh amen don't you believe that God Amen is revealing himself to the human heart amen the spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ so this amen is more than just an education amen it's more than just an idea amen but this is a revelation that God Amen is revealing something not to the Head amen not to the feet not to the hands amen but he is revealing it to the hearts amen notice the place that this Revelation is taking place amen it's taking place in amen the human heart now you all know what healing is the prophet of God said it's your personal faith Amen in a finished work at Calvary amen of what the Lord Jesus J Christ what God did by him at Calvary when he purchased your salvation and your healing now amen I find it very amazing that brother Bram will tell us that there's actually two types of healing he says there is a physical healing he said but then there is a spiritual healing now when you think of this the spiritual brother B says this he says but there's more to the ministry than just Divine Healing see amen the sickest body I know of tonight amen is the so-called body of Jesus Christ he said it needs spiritual healing he said then there's only one bomb that I know that will heal amen and that is the word there's only one thing amen that will heal the body of Jesus Christ and that is the word he said and that's the sick body that we want to stand up Amen in the strength and the Vitamin Power of the Gospel he said that's why I use so much of my time now amen trying to strengthen the church amen by the word amen he was not laying just in feelings or in gifts or in emotions amen but he knew if this church was going to withstand amen the End Time battle it was going to do it by the word and the only way that you can be strengthened amen is by the word listen friends Feelings Will Fail You amen gifts will fail you but there's one thing that he said will never pass away he said heavens and earth shall pass away amen but my word shall never pass away I believe tonight that the mystical body of Jesus Christ is not a weak body amen I believe it's a strong body because the word has been revealed in the age that we're living in yes sir the Bible says in Psalms 41:4 it says I said Lord amen be merciful unto me and heal my soul amen for I have sinned against thee in Isaiah 53 and verse 5 you know that very well as the atonement he said he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon Him amen and with his stripes we are healed amen Isaiah 57:18 I have seen his ways and will heal him I will lead him also and restore Comforts unto him amen and to his mourners in Jeremiah 3:22 he says return ye backsliding children and I will heal your backslidings behold amen we come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our God in Jeremiah 17:14 he says Heal Me Oh Lord and I shall be healed that's not a negative confession amen that's a positive word amen Heal Me Oh Lord and I shall be healed amen save me and I shall be saved amen for thou art my praise amen I love Hosea 6:1 he says come and let us return unto the Lord amen for he hath torn amen and he will heal us how many believes he will heal us watch and he will he has smitten amen but he will bind us up amen so after the tearing there is a promise of a healing after the smiting there is a promise of abinding you all know the prophet of God said that Jesus amen is our bridegroom right he said now what was Jesus he was smitten now I believe that if if our bridegroom was smitten amen then so will the bride be smitten brother said the word living in an action the Bible bride amen not some man-made bride but the Bible bride amen smitten and Afflicted of God he said no Beauty we should desire her amen but yet we did esteem her smitten and Afflicted that's right amen she stands alone he said she is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3 she is smitten out of the leot ofan church age amen that she was raised up in see the church was raised up in the leot ofan church age he said but that was the husk listen and the seed is not air with the shuck amen this bride might have been raised up in the L of sin age amen but she could not receive amen a strength by the word underneath the influence of a shuck amen so God had to send a prophet with a message that would be a Vindicated message that would call the bride out amen of the place that was wounding her listen leosa was wounding this bride it was wounding her faith it was wounding her ability to believe God hey but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound there will be a voice of resurrection and that voice will call the bride out of the confusion and will call her to a place sister James that she could receive healing hey hey you all believe it church amen that this message of the hour has provided a place for the bride Amen to receive healing amen not just a physical healing but a spiritual healing she was smitten out of the leay out of sin Church age amen I'll said it as plain as I know how and she was called into the bride age she was smitten out of the lotan age but she was called into the bride age Amen to receive true spiritual healing amen by the word I love what the prophet of God says in Feast of trumpets he said see the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years amen but is to be loosed in the evening time amen by the evening time message amen the Holy Spirit amen back in the church again amen Christ himself revealed in human flesh Amen in the evening time he said it he promised it amen listen the devil don't want that to become amen a reality in the Church of the Living God because if that is a reality amen then I can say it don't matter what devil has wounded you it don't matter what false Doctrine has wounded you hey the Holy Ghost is no longer bound amen by the wounds of Le of seea and the confusions of the age we're living in but there is a bomb in Gilead there's a sweet opium from the lily of the valley and it's flowing in the house of God and if he is here amen then healing is here amen I believe it I believe what Luke 4:18 says I love that verse it says the spirit amen of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me Amen to preach the gospel to the poor how many believes that Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor watch this he has sent me Amen to heal the brokenhearted he has sent me Amen to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind amen and to set at Liberty amen them that are bruised amen listen but without the spirit of the Lord upon him he could not do it amen but when the spirit of the Lord descended Hallelujah when the spirit of the Lord descended like a dove on the River Jordan amen he re receive the power Amen to heal the sick and to save the Lost listen I wish I had an hour on every one of those amen but what jumps out to me church is he was sent Amen to heal the brokenhearted amen look at this word heal it means to make whole it means to cure it means to heal it means to free from errors and sins Amen to bring about one salvation amen so healing is not just dealing with the leaving of a cancer amen or the or the or the the changing of a of a limb amen but there's a spiritual healing amen that comes to wounded Hearts amen now I'll say this amen there's many wounded hearts in the world today and I'll just say this Leota a denominational Doctrine wounded many people it wounded people with false Doctrine but look at this word brokenhearted of course you know amen we're speaking of the heart look what it says amen the heart denotes amen the center of all physical and spiritual life amen the center and the seat of spiritual life how many's got a heart amen that might be an odd question to ask you got a heart okay in that heart amen is the center or the seat amen of all physical and spiritual life it is the center amen of spiritual life amen it is the Fountain and the seat of the thoughts amen the passions the desires the appetites the affections the purposes and the Endeavors listen somebody say well amen it don't matter what condition my heart is well according to the Bible out of your heart amen is the issues of Life the Bible says in Proverbs 4:23 amen keep thy heart with all diligence because out of it amen are the issues of life amen out of your heart comes your appetite out of your heart comes your desire out of your heart Comes Your Passion out of your heart comes your purpose amen listen when you Endeavor to do something amen though you may do it with your feet amen your feet receives a mobile or or receives a how can I say a motivation from your heart listen your heart is what motivates your hands to raise your heart is what motivates your feet to shout your heart is what motivates your hands to clap listen and and the Bible says keep thy heart amen for out of it are the issues of life now I love what Jeremiah 179 says it says the heart amen is deceitful though Above All Things amen and desperately wicked amen who can know it amen who can know the heart but the Bible goes on to say but I the Lord search the heart amen and I try the Reigns amen even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings amen so the one who made the heart has the ability to search the heart and he has the ability to discern amen what is afflicting the heart and by that discernment he has the ability to bring a healing to that broken heart brother said we find out now amen that the ark being a top of the human heart he said the heart is deceitful he said that's where people fail today amen is because they get a head religion instead of a heart religion they get a head religion instead of a heart religion now I'll just say this amen there's one thing that Satan would love to break in every one of us amen that's not our feet come on I know we love to dance and Shout but the devil don't mind if he breaks her feet the devil don't want to break he don't mind if he don't really want to break her hands so he can't clap amen he don't want to break our voice so we really can't sing amen the devil wants to break our heart because he knows if our heart amen is out of whatever we're doing we won't be doing it for long amen the day your heart leaves whatever you're doing amen don't worry you won't be doing it for long you say well can you prove that well amen y'all been around long enough to see preachers amen around this message Amen brother Terry they didn't just wake up one day and decide they didn't believe the message amen but somewhere years ago amen the devil broke their heart and their heart left the message and a lot of them just stayed in so they could get enough money to retire on well come on we might as well preach amen but their body was there but their heart was gone I say oh church of living God Amen May the spirit of the Lord amen guard our hearts in the last days amen that no matter what the devil throws at us will not have the ability to break the seat amen of our passion to serve God to break the seat of our affection to believe his word to break the seat amen of their appetite to feed on every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I say oh God let your spirit Reign upon the Church of the Living God in the last days and guard our heart yes sir amen the devil knows brother takes time and shows us he said see the Bible said is blood and water speaking of Jesus am been separated from each other he said any doctor anything can tell you amen that knows the chemistry of the blood that only sorrow will do that brother Kevin when the water and the blood broke apart in the body of our Lord Jesus he said he never died from a Roman spear neither did he die from a nail that drove in his hand or his feet but he died of a broken heart he said being rejected he came to his own and his own received him not said brother random I wish I could have stood there that day at Calvary he said brother you're standing in a better place today come on you're standing in a better place today you're standing in the presence of a resurrected Lord Jesus who has already proved himself triumphant amen I love what David says he says the Lord is n to them that are of a broken heart amen and save a such of a contrite spirit let me say this amen my Lord amen might have hung on the cross amen and he might have stood there and he might have took the pressures of the Roman spear the pressures of the Roman Crown of Thorns but what really killed him was the ability amen not the ability but the breaking of his heart when his heart was broken that's when the blood and water separated amen I'll tell you something friends the devil knows Humanity the devil knows what he knows what's in that heart amen that's why the devil wants to break it in Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 6 the Bible says orever amen this is it's an odd scripture but let me just read it it says orever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bow be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel amen broken at the sister look at that or the Golden Bowl be broken amen or the pitcher be broken or the wheel be broken look at this word broken it means to crush or to oppress brother speaking of a married he he was still there in 1951 marries this young couple during the Depression he said now listen they didn't have hardly anything he said but I looked at them and I said if they love each other they said well sure so I said well now remember amen happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you own amen but how contented you are with the portion that's allotted to you so that's what it be he said I said now there'll be times that you all won't see things alike amen but always remember you're still in love when you see one in that way or the other don't I said give in if they're wrong it'll show after a while to be all right now I want you to catch this I said there's a little bow in a human heart that is full of a golden oil called love amen I'm not preaching on marriage so relax amen but in the human heart there is a little bow in that human heart and it's full of a golden oil called love he said if it's ever broken it can be healed up thank God if it's ever broken it can be healed up he said but there will always be a scar there as long as you live let me just stop and say this amen if you got a bowl and you you you know what a Bowl's for right you put milk in it soup in it ice cream in it amen that bow if it's going to hold anything it's got to be in one piece right it can't be broken it's got to be in one piece listen to me there's many ways that bowl can be broken and when that bowl is broken amen things begin to leak out of it hey but watch this it can be broke in many ways you can drop it you can scoot it off the table you can put it between something and clam the uh slam the door too hard and crack it amen there's many ways it can be broken but there's only one way it can be fixed and I'll tell you what'll fix it amen to bring it back together is something has got to be more powerful of a force than what broke it come on there's got to be something more powerful to pull the two together and put it back together so you can put milk in it or you can put ice cream in it or you can put soup in it there's got to be a glue that more powerful than whatever the force that broke it let me say this friends every single one of us sitting here tonight amen have a heart and we have a bowl in that heart and we've been through things face things been through situations and there's been times that bowl has been cracked but can I make an announcement to you tonight there is a bomb in Gilead there is an opium from the lily of the valley there is a glue it's not super glue it's not Gorilla Glue amen it's not a hotgun glue it's the Holy Ghost Ghost and the Holy Ghost has the power Amen to come between the two cracks amen and put some sad between them and the Holy Ghost is stronger than the oppression that broken that's why Jesus stood there and said he has sent me he said you both know me and you know when I am and I am not come of myself but he has sent me as true whom ye know not he said but I know him for I am from him and he hath sent me Jesus knew that the the father has sent him brother said see what is happening here is God is sending his word and it's bringing Liberty to those who receive it not bondage my goodness the word is not sent to bring bondage it's sent to bring Liberty he said Jesus come he was sent to destroy the works of the devil he said that's why God was made both soul and body he said Jesus had both soul and body and yet was God he came to take on himself the full form of man to redeem the full form of man back to God he said that's why he come in flesh and in Soul he said that's the reason Jesus could say it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he said and if sickness is a blessing and Jesus come and healed the sick everywhere then he defeated his purpose in coming Jesus never did tell his disciples amen never preached at anywhere ask the disciples Amen to tell people they must stay panned down with sickness to obey him but he sent them amen to liberate the sickness and to preach in captivity and to those in bondage he come to bring Deliverance he said and he can't bring Deliverance he can't do the two things opposite one from the other he's either got to be the author of life amen or the author of death he said listen if you put sickness onto God and say that it's God making you sick to die then you got to make him the author of death when death and life cannot associate even together there never was a funeral preached in the presence of Jesus Christ he broke up every funeral possession he come in contact with why because life and death amen cannot exist together what are you saying I'm saying the thing that broke the bow cannot exist in the presence of what come to heal it amen let me say this the sin amen that is bound you cannot exist in the presence of the God who is sent his word to heal you listen friends amen I am a firm believer that the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost has the ability Amen to heal any sickness it has the ability to save any sin it has the ability to forgive any iniquity there is a God and he's right here in this building tonight hey may I say it as plain as I know how healing is here you say it's God's will to heal you yes sir according to Psalms 107 spiritual healing comes amen by God sending his word I love what the prophet says he says God don't want you to suffer he wants you to be well he died for that purpose he don't want you to suffer he wants you to be well and he's made one basic thing if you believe listen what he done he sent his word he sent his son he sent his prophets he sent law he sent everything and today he sent the holy spirit amen to continue the ministry that Jesus did when he was here on the earth you say well the law is not here and the prophets are not here and Jesus is not here in a Corporal body what difference does it make if the holy ghost that was on him is here I say to you tonight Church the holy spirit moves out on the building and speaks whoever he will speak he said that's sovereignty then that brings the knowledge because it's a promise of God Amen and that brings the knowledge of God Sovereign and it also brings his presence down among us we should see it and rejoice we should see the moving of the spirit of God and rejoice amen listen he always send his word amen by prophets acts 10 said the word which God sent unto the children of Israel listen God was sending a blessing to Israel amen but it came by a burden on the heart amen of a prophet so if I could say it this way amen the word was sent as a burden but when it was received brother the bill it was received as a blessing it was sent by a burden but it was received as a blessing Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and day of the Lord listen I doubt very much if any true truly knew the messenger that God had sent into it any age rather amen a church age book except in the first age where Paul was the messenger and even in that age many did not recognize him for what he was first of all the messenger is going to be a prophet it will be based solidly on the word because when he prophesies or has a vision it will always be word oriented and it will always come to pass so it's not going to be human assumptions that's right he will be Vindicated as a prophet because of his accuracy listen what the prophet of God says he said and listen it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by Prophet see the word always came by a prophet and always will that this is the law of God is evident by even a casual search of scripture the unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent his prophet in every age where the people had strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word God always sent his servant to these people but apart from the Theologian in order to correct the false teaching and to lead the people back to God listen the prodag God said see the message is thus sayith the Lord he said the they were speaking amen the word of God because the message is the word itself listen friends the word amen being quickened by the spirit is bringing us to a recognition of the power of the message at the end time listen if it was just word word word and no Spirit the letter kth amen but the spirit giveth life listen God sends his word and heals the people and saves them from their destruction but it's the spirit of God upon the word that administers the word and quickens your heart to receive that word ream come along and preached in 1964 recognizing your day and its message he said see the bride has recognized the evening life how many's thankful for that just begin to recognize the hungry Pentecostals have begin to recognize that them organization hasn't got anything they was looking for they're so twisted and tore up see it's the time of of recognition you've got to recognize amen the world has recognized the Nations has recognized science has recognized and the devil has recognized that it's the time he can wreck women he can wreck the church he can wreck the people he recognized it amen listen if the world is recognized and the devil has recognized then listen what the prophet of God says and God has recognized that there is a people on the Earth that he predestinated to life and he recognized this is the time to send his message he did it the people recognized it the bride time has realized the evening light oh Church of the Living God in the age when the devil is wounding Hearts he is breaking up homes he has destroying the nation he has become the god of this evil age he has created his perverted rather his own Eden but God would send a message and brother Daniel it would not be a theologian it would not be a school teacher it would be a vind ated voice of authority and we can stand here today and say if you'll hear this message you can receive your healing if you'll hear this message you can receive everything you have need of the evening light message is not an intellectual message therefore it's bypassed by many it's not a scientific message therefore brother Bob it's looked down upon by many but it's a message of faith and promise to a Believer listen Malachi 4 come what did it do it restored faith it restored the faith in the promise of God's word don't pay no attention the critics keep our faith on the promise our eyes single our ears single our heart single and one thing on Jesus Christ he is able to perform that which he has promised listen I believe it I believe we're living in a day in time of pressure you all know this where pressure is on everybody come on pressure is on the White House and then it's on the on the schoolhouse it's on the church house it's on the Vatican listen the prodag God said there's a pressure on people today listen and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines it has no age line it has no respective persons it's on the young it's on the old you say well brother Andre I'm a pretty good person I'm under pressure well according to the prophet it's on the good and the bad amen it's on everybody it's pressure he said because we are living in an neurotic age it's a nervous tension and all this together this tension is building up then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place he said it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way because it's tension steam built up got to blow it out somewhere see amen you blow the Buller up listen it builds up as the day goes on he said you talk to your boss if you're working oh so and so if you speak to Kitty come in here mama I'm see there you are it builds up oh my see you feel like your head is going to come off I know I'm with it every day so I know what it means pressure builds up amen now let's just be human for a minute amen you can agree with me that pressure builds up how does it build up it builds up as the day goes on when you wake up in the morning go down The Breakfast Table eat some s eat supper and breakfast eat some breakfast amen there ain't much pressure amen but Daddy goes to work and Mama's got the babies and Kitty's got school amen all day long this happened on the job this happened in the house dog got sick this went amen and by the time everybody comes back together as the day goes on the pressure that evening amen is built up that's why oh God can I preach amen that's why home life is falling apart amen because there's no way Amen to handle the pressure amen the daddy comes home Mama comes home babies come home and all this pressure builds up so the way they handle amen his daddy gets his phone and Mommy gets her phone and kitties get their phone and oh come on Amen and supper is eating the badroom and supper's eating the game room and supper's eating the sewing room amen because there's so much pressure amen the world don't know how to don't know how to deal with it brother said everybody's all built up he said and it builds up to a place it breaks up things it causes hard feelings they snap off listen everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty you're all guilty we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise see there's an excess pressure built up today can I just say what a prophet said he said before I go any further I might say this I believe it's the enemy I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil can I tell you why because the coming of the Lord is at hand the great hour of pressure is on the church but I I want to make an announcement tonight the hour is here for you to be healed it's not the hour you got to live underneath this pressure it's the devil come on let's just preach it's the devil it's not your husband it's not your wife it's not the kids it's the devil coming down and pressing upon you because you are the only people on the Earth that he cannot wreck oh god he has wrecked for churches he has wrecked politicians he has wrecked science and wrecked education but there is a group of people with a predestinated seed on the inside of their soul and the devil can't wreck you I love what David says in Psalms 147:3 he Health the broken in heart he bindeth up their WBS oh people rise in the name of the Lord your God and claim your god-given privilege for the hour is here for you to be healed that's right to glorify God and to receive his spirit and His blessings cut off all the formalities cut off all the ritualistic religion and come into the Realms of the Living God who awakens the human soul I'm reading you a quote and brings you into righteousness into worship of him in the spirit and in the truth I love what the Bible says in Acts 10:38 it says this that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil now watch what he says here for God was with him look at this word devil it's a false accuser this one astounds me brother brother Branson it's persecuting good men it's estranging Mankind from God and enticing them to sin it is afflicting them with diseases by means of demons who take possession of their bodies amen at his bidding now what an age we're living in where everything you go the doctor and they just give you a pill for it right right come on we're living it is this okay we're living in a day and time where everything has a medical has a medical name for it but let me just show you what the Bible says the Bible says in Isaiah 53:7 it says speaking of Jesus the Lamb of God he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb the slaughter and as a sheep before shears his dumb so he openeth not his mouth listen friends certain conditions amen cause Affliction and by that Affliction it brings an oppression let me just say this I know people sometimes have a hard time with this but brother brandom our Prophet suffered with a mental oppression amen now listen it was not coming from something that he done it was coming from a stomach condition that was afflicting his body on the wings of a snow white dove he said I always wanted to go to mayos to find out what was wrong because of the doctors there he said my stomach gets sour oh my brother Jack's helped me around the house before he said now listen to The Prophet I've walked around the house and just a hot greasy water like flying out of my mouth and I walk to the pullad and pray for people that was twice that bad and be healed yeah are y'all hearing me walk around the house all day long spitting up hot water greasy stuff out of his mouth and walk to the p dead and pray for people and be healed he said I've I've had them lay my hands on a man with a cancer on his face and the cancer left his face standing there and I was so sick I couldn't stand up right amen now come on think about that amen amen amen you ever see in the other tevan just doing that amen sit in a chair amen and a prophet couldn't even lift his own hand to pray for the person somebody had to raise his hand Amen to lay it on the cancer because oh god brother Junior his own body was under an Affliction he said you don't know what I've suffered amen just a mental oppression he said every seven years it's come all my life he said that's where I am right now 78 listen to what he says he said I was so distressed I cried I begged and I pleaded brother Sean he lets us in on a little secret amen listen amen I hope this is okay a prophet sitting on the platform anden he wasn't worried about who thought about what about him he was there to preach the word because the anointing was upon him listen it was the ministry of Jesus Christ you all know the pr of God said that Jesus prayed for Peter's mother-in-law or rather not Peter's mother-in-law amen was it the Widow of main son he prayed for walked out by the gate and sit down and grown with a headache are you hearing me but listen he said I was distressed I cried I begged I pleaded but you know what I don't see brother I don't see where he says I quit I've read that quote over over and brother I don't see where it says I quit can I tell you why you don't see it amen because greater was the revelation of the never failing presence of Jesus Christ in his soul than the Affliction that was in his flesh oh God are you hearing me if fat Revelation ever moves in your soul it don't matter how the devil afflicts the flesh greater is the Revelation in your soul and the Affliction in your flesh Hallelujah there's a strength coming from the Revelation I love how the part of God just breaks in this for a minute he says I've seen that demon of Oppression that's battled me all my life he said it comes like a cloud form like a wave it just makes a real funny sound when you're in that other dimension to see the spirit so he was not describing the flesh he was describing the spirit now watch this he said the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old was because the spirit a spirit hung over me and he identifies but tell you what that spirit is it's a devil and here's what it was saying wait a little while longer he said there's not a man that's got his right mind but what wants to do right but there's something that won't let him do right is that right that's the devil but he commissioned his church to cast them Devils out in my name they shall cast out Devils you ain't going to heal nobody you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing I've already done he said preacher stood on the platform and they preach the gospel and devil scatter man come to the altar under conviction say I want to get saved the preacher never saved the man he cast out the devil and the man got saved he said that's the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning do you believe that you've been born again Sons and Daughters of God Christ has already healed you the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's already done it he said that's right but that's what God gave me it's what he give every gospel preacher who will believe him the power and the authority to break that Spirit what are you saying preacher I'm saying we're not in a FES and but battle we're not in a hand to a hand to combat battle we are in a spiritual battle but let me say this I believe with all my heart re says every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken well that ought to make you shout hallelujah every devil that's bowed you all day long and followed you to the house of God that's hanging over your praise that's hanging over your faith that's hanging over your health it's already Broken Hallelujah that devil is already broken by the authority of the word that God sent to heal his children hallelujah hallelujah brother said what is it amen see it's just the devil now I'll just say this that Spirit of Oppression it hangs over it hangs over something can I can I just take a few minutes and read a few things to you the spirit of Oppression it hangs over things because it wants to break things down yeah perseverant you ministers know this man I believe someone says brother Turner yeah all right you know him all right the thing of it is you're really the trouble is amen amen I just want to I want to pile the black eyes on the devil tonight is that okay amen you're suffering from a nervous breakdown you're having some kind of a mental scruple in your mind oh it's oppression from Satan this has been going on for some time and it's caused your body to get weak now watch a prophet it's causing your heart to get weak you're in a very bad shape by this your whole family's Bing nervous breakdown sir you've been waiting for a word haven't you go ahead you've been waiting for a word haven't you yes sir the brother says then do you accept my word oh God do you accept my word yes sir that in the name of Jesus Christ I send you home to be well and the devil's got to come out you say preacher how could that man stand there and accept the word of a seventh angel because it was not his word amen the Holy Ghost had been bound by denom AAL Rivers for 2,000 years but the evening time message would bring the Holy Ghost back in the church and we would be standing here hey not saying what we want to say but saying what he gives us to say you receive my word go home and be well look at this next one prophet of God stands there this is strange to you isn't it it's what makes you upset your body with a nervousness anyhow amen that's your trouble you believe he will take it away from you it's your age it's that time there's probably only one remedy for you and that's Christ that's a horrible thing it's the worst feeling anyone could have there's nothing like feeling that distress you see but Jesus Christ can make you well remember oh God there's not a remedy in a doctor's book for it why it's oppression is like a dark shadow hangs it's always caus you to be that way but he will heal you if you believe amen will you believe amen can I give you another one Ladi some the extreme nervous condition and a firewood which is making her overweight that's what she wants to be prayed for that's exactly the truth let her be the judge now the Lord Jesus is that what he did when he was here on Earth how many knows that to be the Bible you ever read the Bible what was that he did to prove his messiahship to both the Jew and all the rest of the people well this is the end time and the prophet said the Sun would rise in the east it' be a dark day not a day or night but in the evening time the sun would shine again is that right it'll be light in the evening time this is the light that he spoke of the light is Christ he's the light of the world he's a shining and he shine on the Eastern people in the beginning of Pentecost they had the same thing and they took heat as these ignorant fishermen that had been with Jesus because they done the works of Jesus and in the western world after the church age and denomination it's ceasing oh God it's ceasing it's dying and thanks be to God for that but we're coming into the real age now the old leot see in church age brother sea is dyed it's ceasing but we're coming in the real age now and the Christ is shining forth His blessings to the people again you might not want to believe me because I'm not a bishop or some Cardinal but God don't always use Bishops and Cardinals sometimes he uses fisherman and so forth like that so he can take nothing and declare something if I was a cardinal you might think I was smart enough to have some kind of psychology or something but I'm not a cardinal I'm your brother brother Terry let's see he's already told you what you wanted is that right it was for what let's see again it's a nervous condition and overweight you're praying for and you got a broken heart about something watch a Prophet come all the way down that it would take visit after visit after visit after doctor visit after prescription after are you hearing me but a prophet underneath the loosening of the Holy Ghost could stand there and go all the way direct to the source and say it's a broken heart it's a little nephew of yours and he's Afflicted he's a little boy about 10 years old you're more interested about his parents because they're unsaved and you're praying for them thus saith the Lord God bless you lady go on your road and believe and be healed church he sent his word oh God how did he send it he sent it by a vindicate ated prophet he sent his word and he healed the people and he stood on the platform and he saved them from the thing that was trying to bring destruction upon them Hallelujah you believe lady can I read another one amen you believe lady if the Lord Jesus will let me know what you're here for will you accept him as getting as getting what you're after you will you have many things I'm reading you discernments not assumptions one thing you have a Col in

and we cheapen it down to some oh I see you've been through something oh I see you've been through a bad day oh God hey this ain't a bunch of car impersonations it's God sending his word to heal his people I say God forg God forbid we ever reduce it down see listen one thing you have a colon trouble you have a gall batter trouble and you're nervous goes all the way down that's right and then one great thing that's bothering you is a demon oppression you always feel depressed like the devil's got you or something like that you're having a spiritual battle aren't you is that true especially you get that in the afternoon after the dinner something like that in the afternoon it's worse than it is in the for morning that's right cuz it makes you all upset remember that pressure builds up as the day goes on yeah nervousness thank God for a prophet see it's cause looks like there's an enemy fting at you but do you believe that God sent me to cast it away from you do you believe that God sent me to cast it away from you you do come here better bow your head our heavenly father Satan here trying to come against your Holy Spirit why the evil one come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I adjure Thee to leave her you're exposed Satan you go from this woman you're trying to make her commit suicide but you leave her in Jesus Christ's name now look at here it's over now oh God hallelujah he didn't just stand there and see the problem he stood there and and brought that devil right down and exposed him but then he he adjured that devil and he looked right at that spirit and said it's over now raise your hand if ever worri is G you're going to be all right just go on rejoicing and praising God he wants to be worshiped what are you saying I'm saying that Devil's roaming to and fro looking for someone to believe his lies can I read you another one I see a vision break before me a young lady she went back there and sit down a few minutes ago that think she's crossed the separating line don't let Satan tell you that brother Bill a't that powerful as long as you love God God still loves you that I'm make you raise your hands and shout hallelujah as long as you still love God God still loves you it has to be a Creator to create that Creation in your heart to make you love God don't you believe that devil anymore go believe with all your heart go believe him that Christ loves you you know what I say I say it's time to stand up and put that devil on notice we're not a bunch of weak lay out of sins we're not a bunch of confused Babylonians we're not a bunch of intimidated confused Pentecostals we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we have been called out of the deceiving age we have stepped over under the administration of the son of man the Holy Ghost is in the church healing is here salvation is here it's right here tonight as long as you love God you believe it you believe what he said to you what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's the devil you all heard me say these things before he said what is it it's unclean spirits what they're trying to do is they're trying to wear down the people they're trying to oppress the people they're trying to get the people to give in he said listen oh oh therefore behold Exodus 3:9 behold therefore the Cry of the TR of Israel is come unto me I have also seen the oppression where with the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore and I will send thee un Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt brother B said now one day a broker came by and he saw a bunch of slaves working on a certain Plantation 100 more slaves and they were sad brother son why were they sad because they were away from home Lea is not my home this world is not my home many times they were with them because they wouldn't work they thought they would never go home again babies they never see Papa and Mama they' never see their relation they' never see and they were very downcast as it's so easy to become especially when you're oppressed that's what the devil likes to work on you in oppress you know that's a trick of the devil to oppress but when the Christian knows his legal rights amen when you can quote God's word I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee that takes all the oppression away and the clouds begin to clear back but if you just know that God is promised and God's faithful he can keep his promise or he would have never promised it that that what what what Drive drives the clouds back what pushes back the heaviness what what releases you from the downtrod and downcast is when you remember I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you when you remember the revelation of his never failing pres oh my brother said what happens he says you see it and rejoice let me say this in Psalms 33:1 the Bible says rejoice in the Lord amen oh ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright can I have a few minutes on this can I can I have a few minutes and closing is that all right for praise is comely for the upright did it say now listen friends it did not say the spirit of heaviness in Isaiah 61:3 listen at this to appoint of them that mourn and Z to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning that little bow in the Heart Belongs some oil in there the oil of Love is in there look here and the oil of joy for morning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified oh church as long as you're wearing the spirit of heaviness you're out of your position but when your garments change from the spirit of heaviness to the praise of God the Bible says amen that you will be giv God glory in your situation look at this word heaviness it is a dim it is a dull it is a colorus it is a a faint look I found this amazing that in the Bible heaviness is the strongest of the three Greek words in the New Testament for depression in Psalm 69:20 look what David says he says reproach hath broken my heart and I am full of heaviness I look for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but I found none come on I can take it a hand in the Bible she went in the temple wearing the spirit of heaviness under reproach of a Barren womb a prophet comes along in 1958 says I'm a stranger to you lady you're standing here for someone else that is a lady in a hospital been very sick with a cancer the doctors can do no more and you're in need of prayer too cuz you got a heavy heart look at a prophet you got a heavy heart but God knows the secrets of the heart do you believe he can tell me what your heaviness is about it's because you want a baby and I see two Dark Shadows you've had two miscarriages in your time that is correct and now a spirit can you see that moving from this woman that old woman sitting there look at hear that old woman sitting on the corner she suffering the spinal trouble and the reason is

that's been bound by these spirits of Oppression by these false doctrines by these denominational Rivers is going to be loosed in the evening time God sent his word by a Vindicated Prophet with the power and the authority to stand up in his position by the word of God and break every Spirit of heaviness amen I'm going to close on this tonight amen I think it's time to break the spirit of heaviness I think it's time to break it I think it's time to break it over our faith I think it's time to break it over our hope I think it's time to break it over our families I think it's time to

give us the divine power to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going to read it or I'm going to bust don't you love when a prophet just talks to the devil don't you just love it when a prophet just stands there brother Branson squares his shoulders back looks that devil square in the eyes and just has a conversation with him now Satan you who are hanging around here with a question mark across the word of God you are literally disposed tonight you're exposed God has revealed you told you write out who you are what you are you are a liar and the father of a lie and as the Church of God and as one of the members of that church as a born again by the Holy Spirit and by being called in this world to be a prophet and these people have confessed Jesus Christ as their healer and as an interceding priest standing between the living and the dead I say in the name of Jesus Christ I break your power [Applause] Hallelujah and leave this building in the name of Jesus Christ turn every one of them loose come out of them Satan leave them he stood there there one who is bringing the word he said now that I prayed I love this next one he said now that I prayed them through tonight I break the way with the word of God and set them free in the name of Jesus Christ I bring them back to the faith amen he shall turn the heart yes sir he shall turn the Broken Heart by tradition and religion and denomination and afflictions confusions sicknesses diseases whatever broke it he shall heal that Heart by turning it back to the Lord I love what David says in Psalms 19:28 my soul melteth for heaviness strengthen thou me according unto Thy word Proverbs 12:25 heaviness is in the heart of a man and it maketh it stoop but a good word a good word maketh it glad you know what Paul said Paul said we have tasted the good word of God you know what David said he said oh taste and see that the Lord is good are you hearing me church you've got a taste of that good word look what the Bible says in Mark 9:1 he said to them verily I say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power B said they say death and taxes are certain he said taxes is but death isn't certain no indeed there might be a Rapture death ain't to too certain no no not in this day it was many years ago but death is not too certain today let our musicians come there's something about a man or woman that's ever tasted of Jesus Christ they can't taste the world no more you'll spit it out every time I'm so glad if a man's ever tasted that good gift of God he said I'm so glad that we have a heavenly father that if we'll just permit him remember Paul said he said laying not the foundation again of dead Works repentance of God God laying on of hands he said let us go on under Perfection remember that remember what he said he said and this we will do if God will permit prophet of God comes along and says father if we'll just permit him he'll Place us in a place where the devil's house and all the whiskey and npe and nightclubs can never touch us far beyond the screams of this world and all of its PP and all of its worldly mixture and all of its frazel it's Fantastics if a man's ever taste of that good gift of God these things become As Dead As midnight AM my goodness

man there in Welsh he said he went there to find the Revival he found a policeman there on the corner swinging his Billy stick and he walked up to him he said sir he said I'm looking for the Welsh Revival where is it he said Look No Further you found it he said it's here it's in my heart I thought oh God lord if you had left us in that layot of sin age we would have to be identified under some

out of that age it's dying Lord It's ceasing and Lord you called this bride into the real age the bride age Lord under the evening light under the opes of the revealed word of the hour Lord the Holy Ghost can't be bound in this bride age there's something in our hearts we've tasted the good word Lord many hearts that were stooping underneath heaviness stooping underneath confusion Lord father how many hearts Lord when your Prophet come on the scene they were stooping they were stooping underneath men's impersonations of a messiah sign trying to stand there and Lord as I've heard many testimonies of how Lord that Pentecostal preachers would get little earpieces and microphones and things and hear little reports about people and say things in their ear and they would stand there and try to discern it out and call this out and had somebody tell them and call the Lord father what a what a spirit of Oppression hung over the church when you raised up a prophet in this generation and he stood there not after night and he hit Time After Time and there never was one assumption there was never one confusion because it wasn't the spirit of William brandom it was the spirit of Truth it was the spirit that had been bound by those denominational River the spirit of Truth the spirit of accuracy the power of infallibility had been released into the age and Lord it took a prophet right out of that age into a bride age and he stood there and called your people out into the word father I'm not ashamed tonight to be identified with the power of healing by Your Word thank you for

did you enjoy the service tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] you know there is a true power in the message of the hour it is not just a message it's not just another man that has come with his ideas but it is truly the Lord that has come with healing in his wings to offer healing for the not just the physical but the the mental the the spiritual and I thoroughly enjoyed it tonight I so wished I so wish that you know you could get people just to focus on the message of the [Music] hour it there's no need to be confused in this age you know the you wish that people wouldn't follow personalities you just wish that people wouldn't follow after big Ministry or gifts uh um that ain't even tried and true you just wish you know every gift every gift that that is exercised must be tested it must be it it must be uh brought and and and I can't think of that word but you never found a prophet never found a prophet that that stood before men to be judged because he had thus sayth the Lord and he was truly Vindicated but every other gift must be judged and it's just so sad that people get caught up in the confusion when we got such a beautiful message that keeps us from brokenhearted it it's supposed to heal our hearts and I I really enjoyed the quotes there brother BR or brother Andrew just reading of uh the discernment line and and that that true discernment was exposing Devils it was it was defeating Devils it never gave the devil room to work it just never did because it was a true discernment it was a true gift and I tell you it I encourage you church I encourage you young people feed off the message of the hour feed off the word you don't want to become anemic you don't want to become so weak uh to where when troubles come hey troubles everywhere and that is no surprise to any of us we've already heard a prophet preach about the world falling apart we already had a prophet preach and expose the devil in the church he didn't expose him in the barroom he didn't expose him in the clubs and the nightclub he exposed him in the church and and so so it should never become a shock when we see the devil working and and moving and when you're seeing the world crumble and and things falling AP and you see all the turmoil we shouldn't be so shocked and so bothered and so move to where we can't we can't press on and we can't overcome it and and we just don't know what to do we should know what to do that's why we should feed on the word and feed on the word you know and and uh because God's looking for strong Christians in this age so if your heart is broken if there's things that just ain't ain't you know and and you're just feeling just all fragile stay with the message feed off this unfailing word of God it'll strengthen you it'll help you overcome it'll get you R you're ready can you say amen amen and I believe that's where the bride is today God bless you is our prayer and may you just feed off the word that you've heard tonight and uh just soak it into your soul and um you know find time to pray find time to get along and get into the word of God read and pray and listen to the the message that God has sent us in this day can you say amen God bless you we love you uh we want to keep brother Andrew and um Sister Mariah and uh little man in our prayer and that God will just uh be with them as they travel and uh also keep brother Shmi and sister Bethany in our prayer and um uh uh Shu shuel believe is doing good there's some challenges still but uh doing good and so we want to uh just keep brother Shmi and sister Bethany in our prayer and I know they're exhausted and um I I think that comes with parenting and uh uh you know I guess when we got our first child when Seth come along I my world changed and uh you know and it just seems like it keeps changing every child you get and uh you never look back it's just uh it's a glorious thing and so we want to keep them in our prayer that the Lord will just uh bless them and and give them strength that they could uh uh make a way where they can come to church amen and God will just help the baby to grow and develop fully amen and so anyways God bless you uh remember service 11:00 uh we want to keep brother Amos Sister Lisa in our prayers they're traveling uh to Canada I think they left today and and be gone a few weeks and um so anyways the Lord will just keep them safe and bless brother Amos as he would Minister wherever the Lord has got him uh to go amen so let's just
