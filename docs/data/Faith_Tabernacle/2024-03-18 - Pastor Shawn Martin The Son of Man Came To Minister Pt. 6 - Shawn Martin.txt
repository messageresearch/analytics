of situation they've come from California and um it was after the mother got breast cancer and had to get both breasts removed and they came here and then her her daughter's been sick just really fighting an illness it's had her lose 20 uh I think even 30 lbs and she started just breaking down in the meeting that when we were talking just crying and it just felt like you know it' be something that we take before the church here just to pray for her and her whole family if anybody else has a need an imminent need that they' like to lift up before the Lord by lifted hand do that and um

the songs tonight and the special as well and um um enjoyed them verses uh brother Terry amen uh there to that song and I've heard the way uh I guess the um heard that song most my life you know but uh enjoyed the verses that was just good and um enjoyed brother Matthew singing and I love that song word of God speak amen and uh brother Amos is uh is ministering for brother farmer tonight and so we want to keep them in prayer and um let the Lord just use him brother Andrew Glover asked me to greet you all and he's ministering for um brother Homer uh Loria tonight and so um just pray the Lord just blesses them as well amen and uh but before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to the Lord father we're so looking forward to being with you Lord for eternity Lord where we can worship you father without any baggage of carnal mind and the warfar and the things that we all go through on a daily basis be no more Enemy No More discouragements and Lord we're just looking for to that time but father until that time we press on Father we know Lord that U we have the opportunity to come into your presence and Lord just to sit in Heavenly places with you and I pray father that it would be so tonight father that you would just speak through us speak through me speak to your people and Lord anoint both speaker and hearers our prayer and may the words be living to us father and be planted inside of us and take effect Upon Us Lord bless your people tonight father is our prayer brother Amos brother Andrew that is ministering tonight as well I pray that you would anoint them give them the words of life and May the churches there be just edified and lifted up into higher places with you father we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen um John 13 and I'm going to start at the first verse and um but it says uh now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas the scarat Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands now what knowledge that is the the the understanding of that Jesus understanding having this knowledge that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to god notice what he does next he riseth from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where withth he was GED then cometh to he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not but Thou shalt know Hereafter amen you can have your seats this evening and of course this uh this scripture reading is a uh is scripture that we read during our U communion service but I thought it uh prudent to uh read it at this time and um brother branam uses this scripture as a foundation when he preaches um uh the message images of Christ there in 59 but I I thought of this that he knows he he knew he knew he came from God he was going to return to God he knew that the father had given all things into his hands what what a knowledge that is that that is a knowledge that no no man can ever obtain without God giving that to him it was a divine revelation and um and but but then you know of course we know who Jesus was he was God made flesh and he was the King of Kings the Lord of lords the almighty The Undefeated champion of love you know we sing about and all these things he was the Father's Love gift to to the world he carried the heart of the Father And yet when he this he knew what he was he knew his his place he knew these things and yet he didn't rise and say now you know um let's let's let's build a denomination or let's let's build this Kingdom or let's you know you guys need to bow down to me and and all these things but he actually uh takes the lowest humblest role that a man could could take and that is a footwash flunky I mean uh he knows he knows that the father had given all things into his hands he knows who he is right you go listen to the perfect faith and and brother brand you know talks about uh that Jesus knew he he knew he was God he he knew he lived by that faith and and um he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me so he had all of this knowledge and yet he lays aside his robes and takes on a towel put he grabs a towel and he kneels before his disciples and he begins to wash their old dirty feet and you know uh the Bible says that Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost and he shows how he would do that and that would be to take on the form of a servant he took on the form of the servant as we talked about it and there in John uh the the says that he he Sanctified himself he Sanctified himself for the sake of others and then the prophet said he was he was teaching his disciples that they would have to do this same thing if they were to carry on his min Ministry we talk about carrying on the ministry of Christ and and how true that is we are the bride of Christ but but there's a way to carry this out and and Jesus would show us by taking on the form of a servant and so the prophet says see Jesus never lived for himself he's he his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live for your your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others and so it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God this eternal life come into to the Lamb of God and he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others right so so someone says uh said well how can you stand and let somebody call you such bad names well you don't live for yourself you live for others and notice how he puts it that you might redeem that man you live for others for the purpose that you might redeem that man see you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons so I think that's important I think that's what he's trying to say is we're coming to know who we are we talk about knowing who we are right it's important that we know who we are but with this knowledge of knowing who we are we become more humble we become more with a servant heart amen can you say Amen see you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot that they were Sons you are a son you are Tak taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others and why do we live for others that we might redeem that man ain't that right well brother brandom I can live for this brother because he's sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man that hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them see that's eternal life see when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards Calvary can you say Amen am so we we live we live in this life we live for others that we might redeem them we we don't live so that we can have their friendship we don't live so so that we can we we we can be popular among the crowd we don't live for others to to gain uh uh something back from them we live for others that we might redeem them amen ain't that right so so now God made it to where we must come in contact with Sinners we must come in contact and again this is what I was saying this morning this is why Satan wants to isolate us and he does that through complexes and through hurts and and and and and STS and and troubles and disappointments and everyone's going to be disappointed in somebody I guarantee you we all disappoint one another you you can't tell me that that your your spouse doesn't disappoint you in one way or another at some point amen hello it may be just something little I'm not talking about them affecting your love for them but but we we we all have disappointments ain't that right see so so then but yet uh uh through all of this and and if that happens in the in a marriage it happens in a church it happens with it it just happens and and and and yet and then and through that Satan uh builds complexes and we all get and and before you know it it becomes easy to be divided it becomes easy to isolate it becomes easy to whatever but God has made us for contact we got to have contact with Sinners so so you see how do we project something if it cannot be seen right so so I I looked up the word uh uh project it means to present for consideration amen so so brother Ram says you know says many people pray for Sinners he said that's all right but that's not the way to win a sinner it's your business to win the center everybody say it's my business to win the center it's your business to win the centner you don't win him by praying for him you win him by talking to him and introducing to him Christ ain't that right see that's your business that your duty is to win Sinners by talking to them and projecting projecting to them the love of God through the word of God that wins The Sinner somebody say well I wouldn't go to church I sure like that woman I sure like that fallacy because you're winning them right you're becoming salty they may not even step they don't even want to have nothing to do with church you're the contact ain't that right so he says if you stayed home and just prayed for The Sinner never went to contact him there is very little that can be done right but you've got to pray then go see that's right go and do it see the projecting of this love another place he says see we are Pentecostal or are we the next thing if we are Pentecostals let's be Pentecostal If the message is right get in it if it isn't get out of it and find where is right see sure if God be God serve him but but you can't serve God and Mammon at the same time you can't serve God and man at the same time you can't serve God and yourself at the same time ain't that right he said see so let's serve God be convinced and then you'll be concerned now then the church will really go to Growing cuz you'll go out and get everybody you can to bring them in but as long as you just go around and say well that's the preacher's job it isn't the preacher's job it's everyone's job it's everybody's job see every born again Christian has that same spirit in and them ain't that right now 1 Timothy 4:16 uh I did not give them the scriptures uh there so uh but 1 Corinthians uh or 1 Timothy 4 and6 Paul says take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them everybody say continue continue in them for in doing this see Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee Lord ain't that right see now uh and I I won't take long but you know in in in in talking to people sometimes we we can get jokey or or we can give someone else that don't believe what we believe uh you know a hard time in in what they believe and and and and sometimes we can make them feel foolish for believing what they believe and and um you know you you believe in a pope you know or you believe in a you know fat Idol you know to be your God or or whatever you know and and and and what what you know and and really what we're trying to do is make them think they're crazy for what they're believing you know cuz ours is right but that's not the way to win souls you understand what I'm saying see you you you don't have to make fun of a person for the way he believes to win them over and and and the thing is is we've got to take these things serious we've got to take Soul winning serious we got to take a man's Soul be because listen Church they may never go to church in their life we may be the only contact they have with God we we may be the only one the only channel that they will ever have and ever know in order to know a living God hello see and and and so then uh uh uh uh you don't have to make fun of a person's religion you don't have to put them down for what they believe just be salty be so salty that then they will look at you and realize that you've got something that they don't have you've got something that they need you will actually make them understand that their religion is dead can you say Amen see so the then then you know we we spoke of influence this morning and and in 1963 brother Braham said this he said we need influential Christians can you say that with me we need influential Christians now how are they going to be influenced he says influential Christians influenced by the word of God Amen that's what we need we don't need influential people that are influenced by money or by Prestige or by uh Creeds or whatever we need influential Christians who are influenced by the word of God called men or women for an influence to the elected church for the last days now as as we know we don't know who the elect is uh be nice if God would show us you know and uh say no that's an elect and that's elect go for it you know but that's not true we we work among people of all sorts and and we don't know who's the elect and it's really not up for us to know the elect we just go out and try to be we're trying to get the elect in and the only way that we can is is to be influential can you say Amen now so so he says see he said now that that is what we need see is influential Christians influenced by the word amen uh uh for an influence to the elected church for the last days he said now God give it to us and they will be here they're going to be and I believe that's where we come in God's got influential Christians God didn't call you amen uh uh for denominations God didn't call you amen for anything else but he brought you into the greatest message in the world of all ages and he's put it at your feet to affect you this message is affecting us that we can go out in the world and be influence just like the word affected us now we become an effect to the world can you say man why because that's the only thing that's going to get the elect that's the only thing can you say Amen so Matthew 5:13 Jesus said you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden under the foot of men ain't that right now so influence is a great thing this is what God established his church for for them to be to reflect light and for them to be salty amen that's right amen see so so influence in other words we are to have influence see and it's not by great numbers that we have influence can you say Amen it's not by great talent that we have influence it's it's brother Bram said it's by the great God that we represent that's the only influence that we need you you don't have to have have proceeds to have this kind of influence you you don't have to have position in the government or or or to be upper class to have this kind of influence a person that don't even know their ABCs can have that same this kind of influence can you say Amen see and so he's living his life through us that's the influence he's living his life through through us that's why Paul would say I Die daily the life that I now you know uh uh I I've been crucified with Christ and now the life that I now live I live by the faith of Jesus Christ it's a total different life can you say Amen see so so he's living his life through us and that's what will influence others that's that's the kind of influence that we want is he living his life through us God help us ain't that right now a question was asked brother brandham uh by a sister brother brandham I have accepted God's message of today and also our son and we both have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my husband hasn't accepted the message is fighting this message and he has influenced our son and has taken him to a Methodist Church he wants me to go uh with him to church when we are not in service here at the Tabernacle would it be all right for me to go with him or would it be better to stay out of that denomination so well uh dear sister now she never signed her name but perhaps you're listening to your question um he says uh go with your husband but don't be partakers of what they're doing now notice what what this notice this now go with your husband don't but don't be partakers of what they're doing you're supposed to love your husband and love is what does it are you with me love is what does it you be real s salty right don't condemn him don't make him look like he's an idiot be real salty and you say Amen he'll get thirsty if there's anything in him now don't join their denomination stay away from that Den he you know he said stay away from that denomination so don't join it go to it see he says if you can't get a whole loaf get a half can't get a half just get a slice but that's the way you'll win your husband by doing that don't be arrogant then he'll know he's got just as much as you have can you say Amen see so us having influence is to let the people know we've got something that they need on now can you say Amen if the sin looks at it and says well I got the same thing they got my church has got the same thing they got why would I want them well you've lost your in uence ain't that right see and and so so here it is but when you can show something that you have that he don't have well that will make him thirsty to be like you then you don't have to be dogmatic right then you don't have to force people well you know I can't believe you got a TV I ain't got one no just be so salty amen that's good the Lord and you say Amen see well well if I live if we say that God sent a prophet they well of course they're all going to call us an Ault you know Mormons believe that God sent a prophet there's a lot of people believe in prophets you some of you young people may not even remember about David Kesh you know but there was David Kesh in Waco and he had he you know how read up on him and what he was you realize that they believed in Malachi 4 just the same they taught Mal there he that and there's a teaching still down there actually brother Andrew he went down there to look at the uh at at the the site and uh there there's a man that David Kesh uh that goes to the church that David Kesh come out of and and he told him Malachi 4 believes in it da d d d da totally different than what we believe but they're they believe in a prophet well David cres took it further than that he thought he was the to open the Seven Seals and he thought he was the Jesus Christ and he so he exalted so the pastor kicked him out well he takes that whole following you understand what I'm saying see so but but but so there there's people that believe in prophets there's people that believe what but there's something that's got to be deeper than just a combat of knowledge combat of Doctrine can you say man and that is there's there's something that we have that the world don't have have and we've got to be influential amen we must not lose our influence that's right prise the Lord and you say Amen must not in lose our influence I thought of how how people have been turned off this message by by all kinds of sing all kinds of things in in in in the way of of uh crazy doctrines and crazy actions and and all kinds of nonsense but you know what there's one thing that I believe that can help our young people that have turned away from this message amen and and and I I don't think it's any fault of theirs at all I I just think it's is because the message has been misrepresented so it's up to us to present the message right can you say Amen it ain't for us to to fault them it's not for us to condemn them it's actually we it it ought to put a burden and a concern on us to say God let me be so influential because we know that this message is right how many believes this message is Right amen I I just believe this message is right I believe it's the highest thing that you'll ever have in the form of the word of God and in the spirit of God can you say amen amen is this message now what we want is to be salty with this message let's be salty let's let's not lose our our influence let's not lose oh yeah you can quote scripture you can quote message all you want to amen but if you have no influence it does us no good can you say Amen see show that you've got something that he don't have and that'll make him thirsty to be like you see another place if the salt has lost its safer it is s forth good for nothing cast out tro under the foot of men see we must never forget that we are salt and if the salt loses its strength its power to contact see see the salt can only save as it contacts and if it loses its power of contact then it is no more salt but sand amen so what is the difference between salt and sand contact don't lose the power of contact yes sir Amen brother brandom another Place said when we lose our influence as a father as a mother as a Christian as a businessman as a minister when we lose our influence with people he said now we can be very popular in the in the line of the world and go along with the world and a lot of popular people in that way but I mean as what we represent we represent Christ amen ain't that right see see you you can have such such a personality that people just draw to you and still be the wrong influence can you say am man there's a lot of men that are born leaders women that are born leaders they they just got that way about them and the people flock to them but that's not what we're talking about we're here to represent Christ that's the influence that we need and when we lose our influence as that as standing out how can we blend in with the day when God is so against the day so so God does not want us blending in with the day can you say Amen the power of darkness is the thing that is making the day what it is everything that you're seeing today in the world is is is it's it's operating under the power of Darkness can you say man so we are the salt of the earth I I I pray it's a help to you I it's just something that's been on my heart I we we are the salt of the earth how how you are needed how how we are needed I don't care what what kind whether what what what position you hold I don't care your age I don't I don't care your your status in life if you've got the influence of Jesus Christ if if you're representing his life God has called you for contact right can you say Amen you you you're the you know as the prophet said you're the only Bible that a lot of folks will ever read there's some that'll never pick up this Bible but you're the only Bible that they'll read some of them will never understand God and never will walk into a church but you're the church that people will see ain't that right see so you you you are one because you are a dedicated Channel and uh you know when when in electrical you know when you're hooking up the uh stove or you're hooking up the refrigerator or whatever they they you know you it's only supposed to be operating off of one circuit it's a it's it's what we would call a dedicated circuit now uh if you you can on other lines you can run different things on it um and and it all be off of one circuit one breaker but when it comes to something like a a stove or whatever it's a dedicated circuit that that only just only that that uh machine is on that one circuit and that's it see well I think that's the way we ought God has called us to be is dedicated channels right can you say man dedicated Channel see and so we are the salt of the earth now in the natural Church the salt has lost its Savor and brother Brown said see it's lost its sweetness it's lost its love it's lost its influence to bring Sinners to Christ now they're bringing Sinners to the church and that's that's what the prophet talked about I'm afraid we're getting people to to church and not to Christ they're bringing them to their Doctrine they're bringing them to their denomination they're bringing them to their Creeds they're bringing them to a lot of places but that's not the point right they've lost their ability to bring the sinner to Jesus Christ that's right amen amen can you say Amen so they're just taking in a bunch of members and baptized them and then let them live in the world and their influence the influence of the world the influence of the sinner has corrupted the church right ain't that right yeah yes sir now what is the meaning of being a Christian uh brother brandham says it this way because you know we say well I'm a Christian and a lot of times it's just thrown around are you a Christian yeah yeah I'm a Christian I believe in the Lord I go go to church and this and this so brother Brown goes through a a list of it people think that you know being a Christian is having an image of of some image of Christ hanging on the wall or the mirror or something and um or being a Christian is is you know feeding the poor doing doing good to your neighbor and being a good citizen in town and and everybody's got their idea even going to church being faithful doing duties and being involved and all these and and and and they seem to think that that's what makes a Christian but brother Ram says being an image of Christ makes you a Christian being an image of Christ makes you a Christian it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly that's made that makes us what we are then therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness and members of his body we should be images like him right can you say Amen see then our lives should reflect the image of Christ not in our joining church or packing a crucifix or our emotions but it should be in the living presence of the Living God that's reflected through our lives the living presence of the Living God must be reflected Christian means Christlike amen so we we find that you know there's there's what they call you know when when they were digging for gold in the gold rush they they found that there's a rock or whatever called pyite I guess is what it called and and they called it fo's gold because it looked like gold and uh it fooled many many people they thought they had gold and and and actually it was it was fo's gold it really wasn't gold and so how they found that the difference whether it was pyite or or or real gold is that the goldsmiths and and even the Indians they did it and but they would take that that piece and they would beat it and when they just keep beating it and keep beating it and keep beating it until they got down to the real gold they got all that flaky stuff out of there and and and and how he knew it was real and it got down to real substance is that the beater of this piece could see his reflection in it he could see his image he could see his reflection and brother Bram says when the holy spirit of God begins to beat on us with the gospel Hammer until all the things of the world is beaten out and we can reflect the image of the Lord Jesus Christ he said that's then I believe we become Christians can you say Amen too much flake so God beats us and he beats us and he beats us until when he looks he sees his own image reflected he sees his own character ain't that right so he says see we we don't have to reflect the physical image of Christ to have the same stat be the same of the same stature that he was and long hair and the beard and and all these things that he had back then we're in a different day he said but we must in our souls everybody say in our souls we must in our souls reflect his Spirit image and his manner of life life so God has to get all that make belief away from us and boy does he do it right sends us through the test sends us through the trials gets all that selfishness out of us all the unbelief and and all of that till he gets down to the real thing and then we begin to Bear His Image oh aren't you glad for that now notice what kind of an image was he if if we're wanting to reflect him if we're wanting to Bear His Image he's after something right right he's after something in in that image that's why he send you through the trials it ain't to it ain't it ain't to throw you away it ain't because he hates you and and doesn't like you and all that he's after his image that's right praise the Lord so what kind of an image brother Bri says he came not to be some some great somebody yet he was but he came as a servant he came not to be minister to but to minister he said our text tonight reflects what he was that's what makes him great in my es estimation yet being the very God of Eternity the very God who created the heavens and earth and when he came here he took the lowest position the most dis uh undesirable job that anybody could have and that was a foot foot wash flunky can you say Amen see and so that's that's the image that's the image see uh that he's wanting to see in US is when we can humble ourselves amen when we're not trying to be something great we're not trying to make a name for ourselves yes sir but we can actually serve through humility we can actually do what we can do through humility trying to redeem that man trying to redeem that woman trying to redeem that boy or girl can you sayen see so now what a difference it is of the so-called Christian today of what he's reflecting you know because he that so-called Christian wants to be served he begins to think he is somebody but Jesus never came to be ministered to he never came to look and say see what I am am no he he took the lowest he took the lowest can you say Amen right and then he turns around and says and let him that will be the greatest that's the greatest among you be the servant of all ain't that right right so brother Bram says the Modern Trend of Christianity is I'm somebody and you're nothing he said oh that's wrong it should not be that way we are trying to reflect Christianity in the wrong way God doesn't want us to do that can you sayen he said see that doesn't act like Jesus that doesn't reflect his love his personality he came to the lowest to the street Harlot to the beggar to the bum and got right down in the dust with them that's the Christian Life that's the way it should be to reflect him in that way can you say Amen Lord you love him amen so then he says if Christ Still Remains Christ if his spirit is still the holy spirit that was in him and it's still in you if it's in you it'll make you take that position too Lord can you say amen he said see today we try to think that we're different how far it is from his prayer when he prayed that this would all men know that we were his disciples when we have love one for another and instead of that we fuss at one another we despise one another because we don't agree upon certain things we go out and accuse each other see and yet claim to be Christians I know people who claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost as guilty of such things going out and really saying evil things about other Christians when they not when they ought not to be uh to do those things can you say Amen brother Braham said when you do that he said' then we're not Christians yet because it's not what we confess to be but it's actually what we possess that we actually possess it's something that we truly have within us can you say Amen so he says we cannot be a Christian and not love all people ain't that right now listen we might disagree with people and we may even come to bitterly disagree with them but we still love them amen yeah why that we might redeem that man that's the focus that we might bring them back into line hello that's right amen may God help us all amen Jesus never told the Pharisees I think I told you today but he never told the Pharisees you know well you know because you are a Pharisee you're not in it you're not going to make it you're just going to hell there's just no chance all that brother B said Jesus never told them Pharisees because they are a Pharisee that you're lost you're you're no good no brother brah said he went to them and he ministered to them and he helped them he done every thing he could to help them and I truly believe Jesus did and what how did he help them by saying oh you're okay no no he didn't he he whipped them right I mean brother brand said you you compare the fruits of the spirit compared Jesus and the old priest and see which one had the had the the best display the greatest display of the fruits of the spirit it sure wasn't in Jesus because here he was got in a whip and he beat him out of the temple whipped him out of the temple amen through anger ain't that right he called them all different he called them Devils he called them what Snakes in the Grass he called them whatever but what was he trying to do he's trying to show them the error of their way right he could have just walked among them he he could have just been classy guy he could have just had healing campaigns he could have and never never showing light to them never showing the error of their way you understand what I'm saying and yet through it all it was by Divine love CU he didn't come just to feed the poor he didn't come just to uh be the physician to the sick he come to redeem them you're not going to redeem everyone you're not going to help everybody there's some people that ain't even going to be influenced by what you say or what you do but that who cares right we've got to show love anyways the Lord can you say Amen Lord you love the Lord amen amen if there's ever a time that we need to project Christ and the spirit of God it is now there's ever a time you know we do not win people over by knowledge we do not win people over by our education smarts and all that we win people over by the spirit of God Amen may he have total preeminence in US amen may we do you realize you're the only people and I'm talking about bride people message people that have the access to light shining that you could live in the presence of the sun amen and that that light is so quick in you that you can reflect to someone else Lord can you say Amen Lord don't need gifts don't need talents don't need anything else you just need to stay in the presence of the son and reflect him and be so salty yeah with him amen I love the Lord amen let's just stand to our feet amen we want to be Christlike you know is been said he became us that we could become him and I'm I'm I'm so glad for that aren't you glad for that amen I'm um I think this what this this communion service is about is is a testimony that Calvary has had an effect Upon Us amen
