Lord the um so Psalms the 23rd chapter and start at the first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul eliteth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen you can have your seats this evening praise the Lord and so um here's a note they're going to keep brother Walker overnight and with eventual transferred to rehab facility and so we want to just continuing to pray for brother Walker or to give him strength to help him to walk and Sister Walker will be going home with their daughter and so just keep them both in prayer I know they would really appreciate it brother Walkers of praying man and he prays just for every one of us and uh you know I I the prayer works and I'm I'm glad that God's got people that are prayer warriors that that just keep us in in prayer and and he certainly needs our prayer amen and so we want to just to continue There but in the past I have talked about the two paths that Jesus spoke of of course one is the broad path which leads to destruction and Jesus said that many there be that that that walk in this path and the other one is the Narrow Path which leads to life which Jesus said few there be that find it and so I want to more talk on this um I believe that the the the Narrow Path is the paths of righteousness that David is speaking of and and so uh maybe just to talk about that a little bit because the paths of righteousness this is the path that God's elect walks in a man he leads me in the paths of righteousness and so they find this path uh now if you be there that find it but they're they they're able to find it because the Lord is their Shepherd and that's what David clearly makes in in the the first verse is the Lord is my shepherd and so he is the one that is leading in these Paths of righteousness I believe that the shepherd the Lord is the spirit of truth that Jesus promised to to come in this age and that is to lead us and to guide us into all truth not just some truth but he is to guide us into all truth which tells us again that it would be at the time of an open book that there there would uh uh be a time that all truth would be made known and and this is the paths of righteousness a man and so uh uh in speaking of the spirit of Truth coming in this day I want to read uh there in in Ephesians 1 starting at the third verse Paul says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ ain't that right now that's that's the position of the believer according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will ain't that right and to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now this means a lot to us and I want to go on wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence and and that that he that hath abounded is the spirit of truth that has come in this day he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will so his will has been a mystery and now it's it's been made known uh according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the Dead dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ ain't that right now I the reason I read this in in in uh Ephesians is because I believe that that the uh Ephesians uh is is is is connected with the spirit of truth that uh uh has come and is showing us all truth amen and being made known unto us ain't that right he has abounded toward us and having made known unto us the mystery of his will so there there is a truth and that is the mystery that has been hid before the foundation of the world that has been hid in the mind of God do you believe that amen so so it's it's dealing with that which has been predestinated that which has been in the mind of God and now it's it's it's it's it's uh uh uh being made known and so uh uh if you remember the prophet tells us that there is a parallel between the book of Ephesians and the Book of Joshua ain't that rhyme amen uh there there's the parallel in other words they're connected they're they're speaking of or dealing with the same thing the same subject the uh uh these things and so the the the the the Book of Joshua brother Branham said it should be called the the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament amen because the the uh Joshua and the Ephesians go hand in hand so what does the Book of Joshua deal with then well it deals with Israel coming into their inheritance it it deals with him coming uh into the land of promise ain't that right and and this wasn't just any old land this was a land that was predestinated for the children of Israel it it was predestinated it was a lamb that was prepared for them and it was in that land that they won their battles it was in that land that they had a right to lay claim to it and and move the Giants move the enemy off and say yeah you got to go this is our land ain't that right they could not do it on the other side of of Jordan they could not do it in in in Esau's land they couldn't do it in the land of of the moabites uh they they couldn't do it in any of the land but the land that was prepared for them amen that was an inheritance Amen to the people ain't that right a man so the and and and the people the land was not only predestinated for them but they were predestinated for that land amen they were predestinated for that land and we know that there there are 12 tribes of Israel and and brother Graham talks about it in the adoption series of how that that got new years and years and years uh uh before uh Israel ever crossed over under Joshua's Ministry that uh that they would go there and he knew exactly where every tribe belonged ain't that right amen and so uh brother Brown says each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children see she spoke the very place in her labor pain where they would be positioned in the promised land now you're talking about inspiration amen they didn't know it and I know they weren't thinking at that time of delivery that they weren't thinking this this little guy is going to a Promised Land I don't think they were thinking that they were just thinking let's get this thing over with right and yet as they as in their travail amen they were naming the place that they would be years and years and years down the road ain't that right and so it was it was God that was directing everything amen uh brother Brown said Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the lamb he from here manessa here this one over here God over here Benjamin you know there's got to be over here and and and uh see he divided the lamb and he says watch when each of those mothers when she called out Ephraim say she was in labor positionally placing him where his feet was setting in oil just exactly every one of them where they were at and Joshua not even knowing this amen not not knowing what the name meant not knowing amen their position at at that time but by inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after being into the promised land gave each man his promise amen his name was telling him where his promise was and and Joshua under inspiration of the Holy Spirit gave him the promise exactly what the Holy Spirit Spirit promised through the birth back there amen I I think that's awesome Amen sold the land a man when they crossed over into the land the promised land then come the revelation of who they were amen then come the meaning of their name then become a man a placing everything that God had promised years ago and and and the plan began to become known to them a man as as when they stepped over into the promised land ain't that right well I believe that we're we're here in our Promised Land amen I believe that we've stepped over Jordan I believe that that third pool it has to do with the promised land of our age ain't that right and so here we're finding that the spirit of truth I believe it was the same Spirit of truth that was back there with Joshua amen here he didn't know what to do but God already ordained him to be the leader and he told him I will not fail thee I'll not leave thee I'll be with thee you just go cross and I'll I'll show you what to do and the spirit of Truth uh uh uh unctioned him amen and gave him the revelation of where every tribe needed to go ain't that right well I believe the spirit of Truth is here today that is revealing the hidden mysteries of who we are I I can't help but to believe that when the mind of God becomes revealed our position becomes revealed amen when the mind of God becomes Maine known amen we become made known because we were the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world can you say amen amen so we find that the things that had been predetermined predestinated by God a man for Israel amen at that time amen and become made known that we find that Moses's Ministry couldn't do that amen he had a different Ministry than what Joshua had amen uh uh we we find that uh uh Moses Ministry was the ministry of law uh which we know to be the ministry of condemnation a man whereas Joshua's Ministry was the ministry of Grace ain't that right and I say this the only the ministry of Grace a man has the ability to reveal the hidden things of God Amen see because uh it deals with predestination amen when you open the mind of God you begin to understand what was predestinated Amen in this age ain't that right amen God just ain't doing things as as as time goes along but it was all set it was all predetermined it was all or amen but yet it was a mystery God's will God's purpose was a mystery Amen to all of us ain't that right but then when the spirit of Truth came amen and began to open up and lead us into truth we found out that the truth was it was hidden in the mind of God and he began to reveal what was there and we found all along we're not here by accident our lies ain't by accident everything that is going on isn't by accident it was all predetermined before the foundation of the world that is the gospel truth can you say Amen you're not an accident that's a lie amen you were predestinated of God that's the truth can you say man so we we find that the ministry of Grace is the only way that the hidden things of God could be made known because it deals with predestination now Moses ministry again was the ministry of condemnation it was the ministry under the law which dealt with the The Works of man it it it uh you know the the law required man to be righteous and yet uh uh without there being an atonement amen it told you what it need what needed to be it demanded it required you to be a certain way but it didn't have no remedy for you to get there you understand that see no remedy and so law does not and cannot uh uh provide an atonement because for one man doesn't deserve an atonement amen the law only deals with what you deserve amen Grace doesn't deal with what you deserve Grace deals is is solely an act from God Amen whether you deserved it or not and none of us deserved it but yet God by Grace amen provided the atonement so the atonement comes by grace and not by law ain't that right and and so uh law cannot he could not did not provide the atonement because we did not uh deserve it amen so so we find the the law just requires you to be perfect sinless but has no remedy to make you in that way amen all it does is just demand a man you to be such and yet you have no uh uh uh uh uh remedy uh no way to get there and so it just deals with the flesh it deals with the carnal man amen the nature of man ain't that right and the moment you break God's Commandments the moment you break the law then there stands the law to condemn you now church we were condemned in the beginning we were condemned before we ever got started because we were sinners by birth ain't that right there is no way that you could serve God by carnal nature there is absolutely no way a man that you could please God In the Flesh for even the Bible says they that walk after the flesh cannot please God ain't that right so then we find that the law Works death and that was what the ministry of of condemnation it was death amen to anybody that that lived under the law a man see and and to think of that if you're under the law you're already condemned there is no remedy there how do you see light at the end of the tunnel then how can you ever hope a man to get any better if you're under the law of of condemnation that Ministry of uh that is administering death and administering amen defeat and ministering something that makes you so helpless and and a sinner before God see but we find a man that Psalm says he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness you know as I got to thinking of that that's uh I just got excited about that he leads me in the paths of righteousness and it is not Paths of death it's not the paths of desolation it's a path of life can you say man it's a path of Life Psalm 16 11 says Thou will show me the path of life oh that's Grace right there ain't that right thou will show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand are there are Pleasures forevermore ain't that right so we we look and and and the law it it it puts you in jail the prophet said and it does not provide an advocate for you there there's no advocate so so how how can the law deal with predestination then if it's dealing with what you are as an individual whether you're worthy or not the way you know you're not worthy so it's it's it's locked you up in jail and it doesn't give you any Advocate whatsoever now can you imagine being in prison a man with no Advocate there I uh you know we we needed an advocate ain't that right now I I think David is is pleading for an advocate here in Psalm 17 3 says hold up my goings in thy paths not my paths thy paths and that my footsteps slip knot ain't that right now we know that David Fell and fell and fell he was a man of failure but here he is he's looking to the Lord and he's saying hold up my goings in thy paths ain't that right that my footsteps slip knot and I I thought that was pretty profound amen so how could David plead for such a thing as this when he was condemned to die by by the law amen how is that well I I thought Paul gives us the answer to that in Romans 5 20 where he says moreover the law entered that the offense might abound amen the law was there that your offense may may abound in other words there ain't no getting rid of your your offense through the law amen it's just there ain't that right but notice he says but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound so even though the people chose law amen you know why they chose the law they chose law so they could have something to do with it they wanted to serve God they didn't want God doing what amen uh well see he called Abraham by Grace Abraham just an ordinary man just uh and uh uh but he called him out by grace and yet there was everyone else there but he by Grace God had had uh uh called Abraham out and prayed every destined him to a promise ain't that right he gave Abraham the promise ain't that right and it was all by Grace Abraham didn't know law it was by Grace so it was the people of Israel that chose the law but even though they chose law Grace did much more abound and if it hadn't been for the grace of God God would have wiped them off the face of the Earth amen but there was something in the mind of God that he could not wipe them off because he had already predestinated for them amen a destination ain't that right so Grace did much more abound sin abounded but Grace did much more abound ain't that right amen so we find that the law could not give the advocate and and to be honest we didn't deserve it advocate we didn't ask for an advocate amen we didn't think we had any chance for an advocate who could be our Advocate who who one of us amen one of you a man could could get me out of uh uh and and justly get me out of the things that I owe God Amen not one of you could I couldn't even do it amen for you amen we find that that that that that when the when the cry went forth who is worthy to open the seals thereof there was nobody that was worthy the prophet said Abraham had to hang his head Moses had to hang his head Joseph that only had one little flaw had to hang his head there was no one even if you cried for an advocate who could be your Advocate can you say man now I've thought of that The Advocate is one who defends or pleads for another or to support or argue For A Cause policy and we and we will call it word predestinated word who's going to appeal for that Amen to plead in favor of can you say man see we needed that Advocate law is saying you're you're you're you're you're worthy of death you are going to die and we have to just hang our head down and say I deserve it I know I did it and I you know what else could I do amen and and and so therefore but here we find there is an advocate and and first John 2 and 1. my little children these things right I unto you that you sin not ain't that right that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous can you say Amen so God by Grace provided an advocate for you and I amen that would sit there and plead our calls and you know what he would plead not that you were not guilty because you are guilty amen he wouldn't say well amen I'll go I'll plead on their record no we had no record ain't that right that he would take the predestinated will of God and he would put him uh uh he he would Advocate on that father you can't destroy them because you ordained them amen to be a bride of yours you ordained them to the promises of God and you cannot destroy them amen and God would provide a Grace for you and I can you say Amen yes sir brother Brown said if it wasn't for that Advocate we'd all be gone wouldn't we but in there we're brought under the rich Royal Blood of the Son of God and before God we are pure and holy think of that now amen not by law amen that's why God sought to abolish the law and he did it he abolished the law when he produced an advocate for us ain't that right yes sir see so we find a man that now we are pure and holy Why by an advocate amen that's right there's no way that you could serve god without an advocate there's no way that you you could lift up hands tonight amen with joy in your heart without an advocate but I'm glad that we have an advocate and such powerful is that Advocate amen that we are pure and holy before who God who knows the hearts and the intent of the heart he knows the hidden thoughts he knows every ounce about you and yet you stand pure and holy before him that's how powerful your Advocate is yes sir so brother Branham in another place the worshiper once purged has no more desire or conscience of sin he doesn't even want to sin he will do things wrong everybody say he will do things wrong but as soon as he does it he will confess his sins right there and say God forgive me I didn't mean to do that you know it father God never sees it but he has an advocate he has a confession and he makes it can you say man now I want to make this very clear now Amen brother Brown said the man who goes ahead and sins and says well I belong to church it don't make any difference it shows right that right then in him proves that he hasn't got what he says see no sir you can't draw bitter in sweet water from the same Fountain ain't that right amen but I'm just believing here tonight that every one of us amen is looking at this and saying father I don't want to sin father amen I know I'm just trapped as the prophet said you're trapped you're in this body of Flesh and you're trapped amen into sins but then there's an advocate ain't that right amen that we don't have to hang our head down amen and the moment you confess your sin is dropped into the bleach of God's blood never to be remembered anymore can you say man now I can be remembered by you because Satan will bring it up before you amen and he works on that memory but I'm talking about the very God that has an infinite mind that knew the end from the beginning and yet the sin he can't remember because such an advocate that he provided for you and I yes sir I'm so blessed for that and you know what the prophet said Grace produced the person of Jesus Christ not the law it was Grace ain't that right you know why yeah you know how Grace done that and God so loved you he so loved you and when his love was expressed Grace produced an object amen windly God his love was expressed towards you oh I want to save that individual I I I I want to bring him to me amen he knew what the devil was going to do with you he knew what the devil was going to destroy you and make you a man a habitual liar or a drunk or or a a sex addict or a drug addict or or whatever amen back in God's mind he says that's the individual I want for my bride for he's a part of me ain't that right and love was projected to you and this is what John says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called not drunks not not abusers not no Goods but we should be called the sons of God and when the love was projected Grace produced the object that love was looking for ain't that right so we we find that as long as a man lives under the law he will never know and neither will he understand predestination he will never understand the what the the mind of God really is oh yes sir you know Israel was worthy of death according to the law but see it never changed the fact that God had predestinated to them to that land ain't that right yes sir these people were Misfits but God had predestinated them to overcome in that land yes sir see amen they didn't deserve the promises of God but you know what it didn't matter whether they deserved it or not God predestinated it and they were the people that God was gonna use to take over ain't that right yes sir amen there was not one of them that could say well God see I knew you'd choose me I tell you what I'm a good guy he met no law condemned them amen they were condemned all together amen so they couldn't even hold their head up and say God okay yeah I'm worthy so I'll go on over no no they they didn't deserve it but God had already predestinated them before they become the Misfits ain't that right so they didn't deserve it and the law proved that they didn't deserve it but God predestinated them to it so it would take Grace not law to take them over into the land ain't that right and remember that false prophet Balaam looked upon the children of Israel and saw their hinder parts Amen brother Branham said see he thought looky here now listen he thought surely that a holy moral God would have to curse a people like that that done such things as that but when looking upon them he looked and he said now lookie they've done this and they've done that surely there's not a holy God in heaven can look upon that and absolutely have any blessing with that church because look at them they've done this and they've done that see he looked at it from the I standpoint from the moral standpoint trying to judge a people by immoral God holy God but he failed to see the smitten Rock before them the Brazen serpent that atonement that forgave their sins can you say Amen oh my and so is it today when a people laugh and say them Divine healers them Holy Rollers they've done this and that well I'll admit that but they failed to see the the blood of Jesus Christ the son of God moving on before the church that's right it atones aren't you glad for that remember young people there's a blood that atones Hallelujah amen I believe there's going to be young people that's going to make it and they and they stand today pure holy before God for the blood atones yes sir and and so brother Branham says see there's a sin atonement made for the church and people you who know God move on yeah don't stop move on don't sit there and have a pity party move on can you say Amen don't think about your past move on amen there's an atonement you can move on that's how he could lead us in these Paths of righteousness there is an atonement he says God is for you do you believe that everybody say it with me God is for me God is for me now I'm telling you this is the spirit of truth that is telling us God's for you hello now if it was just some Bishop telling us this then then we'd have something to argue about but this is a prophet of God that is Anointed with the spirit of truth that is being back in the mind of God and is it's telling us what the mind of God really is and he's telling you God's for you Satan tells you you can't make it God's for you Satan tells you you ain't gonna you ain't gonna become anything he's telling us God is for you move on ain't that right no matter how much they try to put a curse on it it can't be done you can't curse the church it can't be done the blood of Christ separates that God did not look upon any people as their own moral standards the only thing he looks at is the blood of his own son Jesus Christ and any persons that's under that blood is safely protected can you say man aren't you glad for that any person aren't you glad for the blood amen any person that is under that blood you're safely protected amen from who God himself ate that run amen and the only way the devil can harm you is is is is through the sins of unbelief but there is a blood barrier that is separating a man you from the devil and it's separating you from God in the sense that God can't look at you as a sinner he looks at you as his son man you're safely protected I'm safely protected just tell the devil I am safely protected you believe it yes sir see says oh my under the blood I don't care how much you haul or scream stay there until morning breaks they were under the blood the blood of the Lamb the smitten Rock Brazen serpent see look they were under the blood of the Lamb the blood was placed upon the door the lentil of the door they went out under the blood amen amen that's right this is a blood path bloody pass amen who's whose blood his blood amen see they went out under the blood they got out there and got hungry God fed them out of Heaven they got thirsty God gave them water from the rock they got sick he gave them power for healing and Balaam failed to see that ain't that right he thought because they were so radical in in this way and that way that God didn't have any honor for them boy he fought wrong ain't that right he thought a holy God wouldn't have honor to such a people as that but there was a blood Hallelujah you see he didn't he didn't have honor notice how the prophet says this he didn't have honor for them he did for his atonement he provided something that he could honor ain't that Ryan he don't honor our mistakes he doesn't honor our funky ideas he doesn't honor our weird ways sometimes sometimes we're just weird weird acting weird thinking weird whatever amen we're getting on an emotional rollercoaster amen and God there's so much things that God can't honor about us but one thing he can honor is the blood can you say amen he honors that blood and that blood will never lose its power I don't care if you're in the Mountaintop or in the valley or in the darkest pits of Hell the blood will never lose its power what an advocate he didn't have any honor for them but he did for his atonement amen God today no matter what the church has done you get that church no matter what the church has done the atonement the blood of Jesus Christ steal the tones for the sins aren't you glad for that now listen the atonement is the only way the predestinated will of God could be fulfilled is by the atonement couldn't fulfill it by the law you ain't even got to start by the law but if you'll look at the atonement remember they want a law so they can look at themselves say look what a guy I am God we're Partners right and God's looking out there ready to blow their you know blow fire upon them and consume them because of the Wrath and they're they're filthy and and their their own righteousness stuck before God is this filthy rags ain't that right amen there's nothing about them that God wanted a man that he could use of them amen all he needed was an atonement to where he could go down and live in them Hallelujah so the atonement is the only way that the predestinated will of God can be fulfilled it's part of the plan of God right God trusts his atonement better than he trusts that you will not make a mistake ain't that right he has so much confidence in his atonement that he seals his people way before they get to their destiny right now if God can trust the atonement you can too if God so trusts the atonement that he comes and lives in you a man woman boy girl full of mistakes and failures and yet he's living in you just because of the atonement that he provided can't we find a trust in that atonement too should not our songs be based up off the atonement should not our glory be based off the atonement should not our praise be based off the atonement should not our preaching our singing everything about us be based off the atonement I am what I am by the grace of God Ephesians 4 30 it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption you're not sealed at the day you're sealed until the day right he doesn't wait for you to make it and then he seals you and says Paul that was a tough one I didn't think they'd do it but they did it now I can silly nope he called your son not because you deserved it but of his love now brother round says don't that just take the scare out of it now God's with us do you believe that maybe say that God's with us God's with me God's with this church God's with my family God's with us oh my not a take to scare out right although you sin you got an advocate tell God you're sorry come on back that's the way to do it don't think you're cast off forever [Laughter] as long as you still have enough desire to come to this church come on God's still with you and you say man as long as that desire is still lingering in your heart to serve God keep moving on God's still with you hmm yes sir sure he is yes he would just keep moving as long as he as he's called you he's still in the saving business to call you and all he's calling he's still wooing at your heart see come on no matter what you've done God still wants to forgive you and take you back love you a little bit hug you up to his bosom oh what a different picture Satan tells us that God doesn't love us God is just our he rejected us we're just Misfits but here is a prophet amen looking in the mind of God and spirit of Truth Now expressing to us all truth ain't that right expressing all that truth that God really just wants to give you a little hug and he wants to draw you up close to his bosom and just love on you a little bit give you a few spiritual vitamins put you back in the church in your position again he came to redeem to seek to save that which was lost notice another place brother Branham and speaking of the Holy Ghost says it makes intercession for our ignorance sometime we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into something the holy spirit's there to make advocate for us he is our advocator he stands there he's our attorney aren't you glad you got the best attorney I thought many times what if I ever got in trouble you know and you need to you just needed the best attorney you might be facing death sentence or you might be facing life and and you've got to put your own life into the skills of an attorney and you don't know if he can be bought you don't know if he just really likes you or not he might just be taking the case just to get away from home I don't know you know and yet your life is hinging on what he does for you but oh my amen our life is dependent upon our attorney amen amen whether it's heaven or hell and I'm telling you right now we're Bound for heaven now the prophet already said you can't lose we've got the best Advocate we've got the best attorney there is and I didn't call for him God's the one that provided it hate that ride and I'm just be honest God became flesh himself that he could become my attorney God not only is my judge but he's my attorney and not only is my he is my attorney but he's already paid my Ransom he became My Sacrifice that way when he gets up on the throne and he looks at me he can't see me he hears my voice that he sees the blood and what blood is it it's his own blood his own blood is bleeding on my behalf how can you go wrong I hope it's all right this is truth you know see so we ignorantly stagger into something the holy spirit's there to make uh advocate for us he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for ourself because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for us the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand he makes intercessions for us and I believe this is why prayer is so important in our daily walk amen yes sir that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything I walk now notice how brother bran puts it I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fella we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say well I'm afraid to take Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I will do this don't be afraid everybody say don't be afraid hey man don't don't be afraid don't be afraid to take this Christian Life and don't don't be afraid to say God I'm going to serve you don't look at the future and say well I might make mistakes and I might do this and I might do that what what if I just make a flub of myself don't be afraid to take God at his word don't be afraid to commit your life to him ain't that Ryan Don't Be Afraid we have an advocate a man always stands by us he is in us and he makes intercessions for us the Holy Spirit constantly and he repeats that constantly making advocate for us all the time hallelujah thank God that ought to make us excited then I'll take all the fear away he's making Advocate constantly constantly for us all the time when you're asleep he's making advocate you know the devil does he comes into you in bad dreams sometimes have you ever just had bad dreams and in bad dreams amen they begin to try to affect you yet the Holy Spirit even while you're asleep and even while Satan's trying to attack your mind I believe the holy spirit is there making advocate for you he said he's constantly making advocate for us he's advocating for us in our ignorance he's advocating oh my so it's the ministry of Grace that takes us over into the Promised Land into the promises ain't that right and you remember what the prophet said the promised land is the age of the overcomer and again that could only happen by grace you can't overcome by law now you're condemned now notice Joshua 1 and 2 Moses my servant is dead therefore arise now go over this Jordan thou and all this people under the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that I have given unto you every place don't be afraid to walk amen don't be afraid to possess these things are in the mind of God that has been in the mind of God now they've been made open to you don't be afraid to confess them I am the Son of God I am the Spotless virgin bride of Christ he ain't that right I am faultless ain't that right why because there's no fault in My Sacrifice there's no fault in my Advocate his advocation is perfect his blood is perfect and that blood has perfectly loosed me walk ah yes sir he leads me in the paths of righteousness every place your feet Treads upon I've given it done to you from the Wilderness in in this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of our life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee and you know brother Brown takes that very scripture and applies it to his ministry ain't that right now and you you you got to know this you say well and the devil will say well that that was just for Joshua that was just for brother Branham absolutely not as long as the people follow Joshua it belonged to them ain't that right that's what Caleb believed anyways 80 years old am I but give me my mountain he didn't care about them Giants to promise that God gave Joshua belong to him just as well because he was following the message of the hour so he says I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto this people Thou shalt divide for an inheritance the land it wasn't meant for Joshua to take the inheritance it was meant for the people to take the inheritance are you with me and so is this message it's meant for you to take it not for you to squabble over it not for you to get it intellectually is for you to look at it and say that mine that promise is mine that's mine if you need healing take it if you need Deliverance take it if you need Rapture and Faith take it whatever you need take it amen be strong and of good courage For unto this people that shall divide for an inheritance land which I swear unto the fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous now George you understand that he's he he's applying this several times to Joshua be strong be courageous this is the part now Joshua had to be strong them people needed to be strong now and I have to tell you our Prophet was strong he was very courageous was he not he stood night after night after night facing every devil that came against him he was very strong in his faith he was very courageous and now you've got to be strong and very courageous as well this ain't the time to pity Patty with the devil this ain't the time to bargain with the devil we ain't here to sit down and talk and discuss and all of these things not one piece of my land am I given to the devil I'm not giving my family to the devil I'm not giving my mind to the devil I'm not giving my body to the devil I'm not giving my soul to the devil I'm not giving this church to the devil amen everything belongs to me and I'm going to be strong and courageous oh yeah there's Giants enough to make you fear if you look at it but you got to look at the promise so he says see be strong and very courageous thou that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded they turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest no matter what part of the land you're going hey man don't don't look to the left or the right keep your eyes on that promise amen keep it there and be strong and very courageous that you may Prosper can you say Amen this church is not going to be defeated God never meant for Israel to enter that land and be defeated amen every giant look at what David David believed in that promise he knew he was a covenant person and when that giant was defying the very God that they served and the his Brethren his Grand his Kindred was standing there shaken he was the one to stand up and say but I'm a covenant one we are a covenant people and here a little boy could look at that giant and slay him amen thank you thank you good the commission was given to Joshua and for all the people that followed his message and his leadership and this is why this is not the hour does dissect brother Brandon's message and say well this is his opinion and that's opinion and this and that and all just believe the message you may not understand it I'll just bleed the message and what seems to be contradictory to the Bible just put it that you don't understand it then you say man that just put it to my ignorance that that that I don't understand ain't that right Middle Brother Brown said it then then there's got to be a reason for it so now Joshua's message of Grace couldn't exist at the same time that law was in existence and brother Brown said neither does any message that forwards the people on ever cons coincide with the past message it will not do it there's where you have trouble today Jesus said does any person put a new piece of garment and put it into an old or put new wine into Old bottles they perish it bursts them open they can't stand it and Joshua could not at all come into his ministry until after Moses was gone so you see the very first verse here Moses my servant is dead now arise and take this people to the promised land Moses representing the law had served its time see the law had served its time now Joshua could rise up into his position with the ministry of Grace and take the people over Hallelujah now you we know that Israel had grace before the law as we talked about the church started out in Greece ain't that right man always got to do something himself but see the Promise was not given unto the law and it cannot be fulfilled by law you just can't it came by grace and it will be fulfilled by grace so notice the spirit of Truth I believe is the spirit of Grace which Paul speaks of in Hebrews 10 29. here on the 28th verse he that despised Moses the law died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses how much sore of punishment spoji shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under the foot of the underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified and Unholy thing and had done despite unto the spirit of Grace now that's what's here in in in the land today with with this bride is the spirit of Grace ain't that right even Malachi or Zechariah spoke of that when he saw the headstone coming and what all did he cry Grace Grace Under The Headstone and and go go listen to the message of Grace and and you have to listen just listen and maybe re-listen and re-listen and re-listen but brother Brown sank a lot in that message amen but he's typing his ministry to that as The Headstone and it's Grace Grace and he says I've always been I've always been you know they've kind of blamed me for just being a one of Grace but he says I am one of Grace amen see and so so and he begins to talk to us but but brother Bradham said the spirit of Grace comes from the blood oh the spirit of Grace comes from the blood amen so Paul tells us now that Jesus is the mediator and I I'm hoping I'm making some sense a little bit uh but stick in mind the paths of righteousness amen and hopefully we'll get somewhere but Jesus Paul tells us that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant oh man so the New Covenant yeah now that that Covenant God made with you it's a covenant right did not Abraham make God make covenant with Abraham remember he tried to make a covenant with Adam and he put it on moral free moral agent you know it was a conditional he put it on conditional he says and Adam broke it and brother Brown says every time that God makes a covenant with man on condition man always breaks it but God was so determined that he what was in his mind be fulfilled that plan would be carried out that he would make a covenant with man but it would be unconditional oh man and he shows it through Abraham he puts Abraham to sleep right showing that Abraham had nothing to do with it and and the deeper a Darkness came over Abraham brother Brown said show him that he was worthy of hell ain't that right amen but then the Bible says there's a lot a little light Pillar of Fire a lake of fire a man that went between the sacrifices showing that while Abraham was asleep God was not only going to fulfill his part but he would step over and fulfill man's part as well amen and that would be called The Grace Covenant not by what you've done but what God has done and while you were so ignorant and I was so ignorant we didn't know what God was doing and yet we think God left us we think God had nothing to do with us anymore God's been with us all the time and he's making his word perfect in US for he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you and it's all because he honors the Covenant that he made with you it's a Grace Covenant ain't that right now Paul tells us Jesus our Advocate is the mediator of the New Covenant oh is the Covenant of Grace it's a blood Covenant ain't that right now notice Paul would tell us that here's blood the blood of Jesus Christ Our advocate speaks better things than did of Abel ain't that right well see so the blood speaks the blood has a voice and yet the blood of Christ speaks better things than Abel's blood did what was Abel's blood it was crying out against Cain no mercy for Cain could you imagine the blood speaking out and no mercy and and no matter wherever Cain went Abel's blood was still calling out against it crying out against him he was a condemned man and God didn't kill Cain but he just marked it and wherever he went he was marked man that'd be horrible ain't that right why because it was the voice of condemnation it would not wipe Cain's actions clean it would not take it away it was a voice against him of condemnation yeah ain't that right here's what the prophet says though the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word can you say Amen and that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it ain't that right so I believe that the spirit of truth that is leading Us in guidedness are Shepherd right yeah it's the voice of the blood amen oh now notice brother Brown said it speaks better things the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of Heaven ain't that right right here in this word it speaks of it all and it comes from the voice of not law but the blood of Jesus Christ and that same blood that was shed upon the ground that called after his dead brother called out after his dead brother that killed him the blood of Jesus covers everybody say it covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us that's what the spirit of Truth is in this last day is to lead us into the promises the blood made the way now you brother Graham goes on in another place said you say the churches has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it know the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found Grace to with her and she has found Grace with him he's engaged to her and if there's anything he'll keep her away keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great up on them and so will it be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many lost and blind how many Sinners there was there in the world the hour I got saved but God saved me for a purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose I don't care what anything else goes I want to do it and I believe that's all of us tonight I want to fulfill his purpose he had a purpose in calling me ain't that right all right so we're going to move on and then we'll get ready to close but the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua the New Testament the prophet says it's dividing up and setting in order the overcome ones another place that said the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua and Joshua placing the people where they belong so again the book of Ephesians positionally places the the church where it absolutely stands in Christ ain't that right Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua that's me right amen put yourself there too see Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua another place he said Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the other so it will repeat in this end day the same problem the same pressures ain't that right so again notice under the ministry of Joshua the mystery was made known and we see that brother branham's Ministry perfectly is in line with Joshua's Ministry ain't that right so with this in mind this is what the ministry of of the message is doing it's opened up the lamb to us the land the book right it's in this day that we see there's a rapture for us it's in this day that we see that we're we're Enoch's type it's in this day where Ruth was our type Esther was our type it's in this day that the land has been open and now we're not just reading about David and Goliath we're actually seeing ourselves and saying hold it he was our type ain't that right there there's so many types in this Bible that that that applies to you and I that that it's incredible that this Bible amen this as it has been written as God is moving upon men and women's lives and and they don't even know it but God knows it he's speaking of us in this last day ain't that right and so it took a profit in this day to open the land up oh yes the spirit of Truth has come to lead us in the paths of righteousness see the paths of righteousness is the plan of God mapped out they are predestinated paths predestinated for certain people that's been predestinated to walk these paths Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them not you didn't stumble on it he's leading you in these paths can you say amen and these Paths of righteousness were already foretold in the scriptures they are prophetic paths for the age in which we live amen oh amen now that word predestinate means to predetermine to for ordain by a Divine decree and this all took place before the foundation of the world ain't that right now notice how this how this works Romans 8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called when was this before the foundation of the world and whom he called them he also Justified before the foundation of the world and whom he justified them he also glorified before the foundation of the world that's why the prophet said you've already got your glorified or your your theophany is already there waiting on you yes sir how can it be so how can I already brother Branson how can we already have is he off any waiting on us because God already predestinated it it's a path for you it's a path for me ain't that right there's a table that's already spread he ain't waiting to add chairs and take away chairs and they didn't see who makes it it's already a path that's ordained for me God already knows who's going to make it in a rapture it's a path that is ordained for me God already knows who's going to be in this part of the third pool Ministry in this age it's a path for me I couldn't come in Luther's age I couldn't come in Pentecost I couldn't come at the first church I had to be in this age it's a path all right predestinated amen so then we also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen you love the Lord I hope I'm making a little sense to you Paths of righteousness brother Brown said if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me now he's got confidence that God wants to use you God wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it now now you say but but the Greater Works he chose you in this age for that scripture that's a path that's been ordained for this bride you believe it what about the challenges you know where brother branham's you know and he takes it from the scripture in in a couple places like the Philippian Jailer where Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be in thy house shall be saved then brother Branham comes right along taking that scripture and he says and you mothers you have a waivered boy or girl no matter how Wayward no matter how Wayward don't you look at that giant no matter how wayward if you've got enough faith for yourself then bleed for them also that is the Sith Lord from the from from a prophet's mouth why it's a path that's been ordained before the foundation of the world it's true why God been waiting for this bride to come up and to rise up in her position to come to adopted sons of God that even the devil when he takes our children we can lay claim to them and the devil has to give it up that's a path of righteousness that's a predestinated path that we all have and I'm telling you in the paths of righteousness no devil in hell can stand before you it's your promise this book is your promise can you say Amen so he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you don't sit there and just sit around say well I just don't understand why everybody else just be thankful that God chose you I may not understand that part but all I know is God chose me and I'm thankful for it and all I can say I am what I am by the grace of God it ain't because I got a better head I think because I got better intellect it ain't because I got a better willpower than everybody else the times that I wanted to quit he wouldn't let me quit thank God it's our God but he took you and then notice he says amen no one can take your place amen again you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you how thankful we ought to be that God would choose us now the millions of people that are trying to find answers we sit here with answers of the millions of people that don't know the love of God and they're trying to find joy in the beer bottles they're trying to find joy in in religion they're trying to find Joy but God chose us to open the Mysteries to us that we could walk in these Paths of righteousness he ordained for us to fulfill can you say man do you love him I got a lot more but I'm gonna close I I don't want to bore you but if the musicians will come the prophet said God in his great economy has so set the body of Christ in order till there is no one can take your place that's how important you are no one can take your place I could say it this way if you notice in the Bible we can see men and even women then had nothing to do with being what they were you can turn this down just a tad bit it's keeps trying to squeal God said to Jeremiah in in Jeremiah 1 4. before I formed thee now you think of this before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations and the prophet said what did Jeremiah have to do with that nothing God did it so it's God's
