and they sang it and three different languages I think it was English Hebrew and Arabic I think or something and it was kind of neat to hear it the different ways but you know how we use different words in different languages but so we say promise keeper I think that's what it is but you know in the Hebrew the Arabic that it leans back on what it was originally it says I think in the one language it's Keeper of the Covenant and then the other one says Covenant keeper and I just thought that was neat the just the wording that uh it's glad we've got a keeper of the Covenant and okay he promised us that he would be a counselor a mighty God and the prince of peace [Music] that he a father and would love us with a love that would not cease well I've tried him and I found his promises

we uh just love the lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen and uh thank him for all his goodness and good to have brother Amos back in the house of the Lord tonight and had to work today I guess and so if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Joshua the first chapter and um we'll read the eighth verse it says this book of the law shall not depart out of our mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for them everybody say then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen let's just bow our heads precious Lord the songs Just uplifting it's coming from our heart lord it's an expression Lord of how we feel about you Lord you are our everything and we value so many times Lord certainly don't mean to and we just ask that you would forgive us of all of our sins and Lord May the worship be pleasing to you tonight Lord for it comes from a heart that's been redeemed Lord we've experienced your goodness we've experienced your grace and mercy Lord and we just thank you and now we're just asking that you would move Lord through your word and just speak to every heart all that you see the the simple thought that I would have tonight and I pray Lord that you would just multiply it to blessed father is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you can have your seeds I have just stayed simple thought and and um I guess the title would be meditating on the positive and um and the the scripture that we read here of course this is dealing with Joshua he's he's getting ready to take the the the people over into the promised land which has been long waited this has been something that uh they've lived for there's prophecies that have been been laying dormant and here now Joshua is Anointed to bring the people over and so when he's saying Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then you should have success and you can see what that meant to Joshua that this is we're going in the land and the enemies there and you remember what the ten spies said uh we can't take it and and in the natural I mean they they they said we were as grasshoppers in their sight so man what a uh tremendous thing it was to them uh it was overwhelming and then not just the Johnston they're having to face walled cities and things in that nature and so here's the promise but there's obstacles that that just seem overwhelming but your God is is telling Joshua now there's a key to it and that is you don't let the book of the law depart from your mouth and you shall meditate there in day and night and I I think as as brother random he parallels This Book of Joshua with the book of Ephesians and Ephesians is our Joshua our land it talks about our inheritance and it talks about these things and and we know that's our scripture this that's that applies to us it never as far as I can see in the message it never applied to any other age but us and and so then when we read this then we we can can see how applicable it is to us I think it's strange and like I said I got simple thought I um uh anyways I think it's strange that it would be in this age that if if God has a law to success and I'm not talking in in natural I'm talking about our Promised Land then and that is to keep the word in our mouth and meditate upon it I think it's strange of how that Satan has developed so much to keep our minds occupied off the very thing that we need to have success and to be prosperous I I personally don't think that um that God would write these things get like let's give them the land and and say okay go for it and then they fail and and then they struggle and then they they they come up short in what God already promised them now that was the mindset of the ten spies God promised it but we can't God said we can do it but we can't because they forgot the law they forgot the key they forgot it and and so of course it was a mixed multitude and that makes multitude kept things stirring up it it kept them the people turning other directions instead of just staying with what the prophet said and and seeing what God was doing and and we could even look at that that that there's not just the voice of a prophet there's so many voices out here today uh uh one voice of God and many voices uh to contradict that and and that is ringing so loud brother REM says that it's almost drowning out the voice of God and and so we we are in in a time of mixed multitude a lot of religions a lot of uh uh confessions professions or whatever you want to call it but uh in the same time there is the voice of God and and the law of God Still Remains true uh for us to prosper and and have good success now last week this came to my mind and I so I wanted just to speak on it this afternoon and I'm not going to take long but uh but I'm I'm tonight I'm not addressing you as a professor with his students in a college of of some sort but I as a minister of the Gospel I believe I'm I'm talking to Sons and Daughters of God and we are Sons and Daughters of God so our approach is different than the way the world would approach things and and I'm looking at this word positive according to Webster it's fully assured it means fully assured and there's there's other meanings but but this word uh or this meaning is positive means fully assured confident a man fully assured confident now this means something to us because brother Branham said and and I didn't have the time and and so I'm going to I'm going to take some time uh to get more into it but brother Branham said make every word positive make every thought positive right so now he's telling this us for a reason now we we are people of the land we are people um uh of the open book right this this is our land right here and and it had been closed up it's it's been you know and a lot of challenges and things but then it's it's been open to us but to be positive to be fully assured to be confident then there can be no questions to things uh uh and and so you know uh you you cannot have a sure Foundation under you when you have questions and I don't I don't even think maybe even in the natural you you you can a person can't be successful even in a business if he's questioning the business uh you know if he's not sure about the business if the business is not solid if it's and and uh you know you you have a lot of people wanting to get rich quick you know and things like that and then they jump into things never questioning it or or just not not really sure if it's going to work but but they they just go into it and and but but to be positive a man has to be positive he has to know where he's standing and and and and if there's anything that throws questions that's the devil the devil puts questions constantly he's got questions he always questioned the word of God remember even questioned Jesus if thou be the Son of God do this if thou be do this if thou be and it was always question question question he never came to Jesus with solid uh uh Thou Art the Son of God now I'd like to see you do this it was always if thou be and and so because he was trying to get Jesus to prove amen get him in a place that he would prove that he was the son of God right and so Satan is constantly throwing questions uh out there well you know to where we you know if we're not careful we will listen to them and it could be thoughts just coming into our mind that are you know thoughts of unworthiness thoughts of well uh will we really make it thoughts and I've really forgiven thoughts of you know uh uh is is there really hope for me is thoughts of uh you know what is my future and but but questions but I think we have answers I I think we have answers to these questions that that we don't constantly have to listen to that or or that we don't have to uh allow them questions to come into us but we can actually meditate not on questions but on the answers can you say man and and so uh um uh so so we cannot be unsure if because if you're unsure you will not move forward in in confidence you you won't move forward in faith and and if you're unsure if you're questioning you won't move and and that's what happened with the 10 spies right they they didn't they they had the answer but they looked at everything else but the answer and and they trembled in in in fear and and so they they said we can't take it that was the the the final analysis uh for them uh uh and so uh but James James said in uh James 1 6 and I did not give them the scriptures they may be a little slow uh getting them up but James said but let him ask in faith right let him ask in faith now he's talking about if any man lack wisdom asking us as let him ask of God but we can let's just put it in anything of Our Lives you see the promises of God you you see them well ask and you shall receive right every everything is is asking everything is is you're looking at it and and and you're wanting it I think that's the desire of every one of us here tonight when you listen to the tapes when you listen to the messages all you hear is the promises of God and and there's something in you say that's what I want that's what I'm after that's that's that's what I'm seeking for right but let him ask in faith he let him ask in faith nothing wavering don't don't waver when you ask so when you're approaching these promises and and and and and you're looking at these things don't waver in them in any way so that means you've got to be a solid there there has to be a positive to this right clearly confident and so he says for he that wavereth is like the wave a wave of the sea driven With the Wind uh and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord uh and now now that's not what God wants us to be to where we come to the place of the promises and then we receive nothing we we we're not to go into prayer and and come up empty-handed we're not to serve God only to be empty-handed at the end he says I've Jesus I've ordained you know called you and over ordained that you should bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain so so the there there's reality to promises there's reality to predestination there's there's reality to his choosing there's a reality to this adoption there's a reality to the message of the hour can you say man there was a reality to Joshua's leadership right there was a reality to the choosing of God choosing Joshua uh uh to lead the people over he wasn't to lead them over and then they all famished and die no no God wanted success God wanted them to to be prosperous right and and so let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord see for a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways ain't that right so positive you you have to have a basis for positive being positive in other words there must be a source that you draw from and that Source has to be solid and ain't that right uh I don't care what you do you you want to you you want your your work you want your your whatever you want it to be solid if you're gonna you know if you're gonna give your ten thousand dollars to the bank you want that bank to be solid and to know that you know you ain't going to put it there and then tomorrow it's going to be gone from you if you're going to invest you you want to do the the the you you want to go into the what is solid what's going what's you know you understand surely we all know uh in in these things and so so how do we how do you get how do you get positive from politics you know how do you get you you get positive from the economy how do you get positive you know from the things that are failing right before our eyes there there's not a solid source to be positive in I'd be honest except we're going you know the ship's going down uh for this nation uh but but as far as just natural things uh where are you going to get it from the bright mind the greatest mind there is how are you going to draw positive from that you can say well we got it all worked out but how really I mean the greatest Minds have been working and working and working and look where we're at it's still not working it's not helping so how do you get positive from them things but here the prophet said the word is positive ain't that right now I'm talking to Christians see uh sons of God the word is positive why it cannot change right you cannot change it must stay just the way it's written so then for for a person to have a deposit in meditation to be positive then then it has to draw from the word of God ain't that right and and so we we find that because the word of God is the it's sure it's steadfast everything about us is negative and is uncertain I I think we could all agree with that uh you say you're going to go to work tomorrow but you really don't know what's going to happen tomorrow I mean and things are changing so fast you know I mean and and and you know sometimes even in my life things just constantly going then you then then you start asking what's next right and and maybe that's you you've done it where it rains it pours and I don't care if it's the flat tire I don't care if it's uh you know the the dog or the you know or something going on with the plumbing or whatever and then you just ask what's next you know uh because everything is just changing you know and and it could be that it could be the economy it could be anything I mean the world I mean we we the the moment I say you know I think we've reached to where it can't get more evil and it gets evil so then I'm thinking Okay now what's next you know because because nothing everything's changing so fast and and so everything about us is negative and and it's all going in the negative uh because we're it's it's all sink and sand ain't that rhyme but here and I hope I make a little sense to you tonight but Philippians 2 and 5. Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus right let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus First Corinthians 2 16 is Paul says for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have everybody say we have the mind of Christ God I think that that means so much to us we have the mind of Christ we have now if you will notice in that uh uh the the previous verses of of second Corinthians 2 or First Corinthians two uh Paul talks about he says I have not seen the natural eye have not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things that God not the world not politics God have prepared for them that love him now the world is preparing something different than what God's preparing you believe that God's making preparations on a totally different than what man is is preparing for but what God is preparing for and what he has made the preparations for man cannot comprehend it ain't that right so there it's it's like in in in in in in I I don't know if you're just you're stuck in the mud or you're in a pit as the prophet would call it a say it or or or whatever and your surroundings is that's all you know is your conditions and and so the meditation everything about it is just let's just say it it's evil it's dark it's you know it's it's hard to believe what man comes up with these days but they're thinking on these things you know what I'm saying and and the world knows how to promote them things Hollywood knows how to promote these things to where it's on the children's mind constantly right and and they can do it through TV they can do it through video games they can do it through schooling now and and they're projecting things in the children's Minds to get their minds directed in a certain way and they're easily and every everyone is falling prey to it because it's dealing with carnal Minds can you say man and you know where it's all coming to education civilization all of that is taking the people's minds further away from God further away from God to where they don't even recognize the presence of God they they they well brother Branham even said the reason why they're doing all the evil is because they're not even aware of God's presence well something has drawn their minds into that direction to where they're not thinking of God they've taken the Bible out they've taken prayer out they're taking everything but what else are they promoting they're promoting other religions they're promoting other things to where you know that God is a god of love and he'll accept anybody anyway anything uh it don't matter you know so so this is the the the the mindset that the generation has can you say amen and yet it's so far from God but but and and and and so we can perceive them things because that's a carnal thinking that's a carnal mind and so that that same we'll put it this way that same carnal eye that same natural mind that same natural ear that same natural heart or whatever you want to call it uh uh cannot see the things that God has prepared for them that love him ain't that right but then God rich in Mercy Paul says but God hath revealed them to us by what an educator by by some student by by some technology no but by his spirit then you say man so so we we have been given now you know then Paul would tell us how it takes the spirit of man to know the things of man he said so it takes the things of God uh the spirit of God to know the things of God ain't that right and and and so then then Paul would tell us but we've not received the spirit of the world aren't you glad for that we've not received the spirit of the world because if you had received the spirit of the world how how do you meditate upon the the law of God the word of God and with the with the spirit of the world you know where the spirit of the world's leading it's coming up with all these things that are so contradictory to God do you believe that it the spirit of the world is actually causing people to you know to identify as a cat you know the spirit of the world is causing people to identify with the same genders uh the spirit of the world is trying it's so mixing the people up that is so contrary to this Bible and and and the churches aren't having success you understand what I'm saying and and so because the spirit of man feeds off the world but he says we've not received the spirit of the world we've received the spirit of God I'm so glad for them that we might know why would he give you the spirit that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God ain't that rhyme so the spirit of man feeds off the world and and of course that's a worldly knowledge where the spirit of God feeds on the word of God and and the pr Paul would go on to say the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto them unto him ain't that right see neither can he know them and I again we go back to the ten spies why didn't they just take what Moses said to them because them words were foolishness to them that they were looking at the obstacles and saying there ain't no way that that word could help us overcome so they disregarded what God said they disregarded the promises because they were serving God from the carnal side of things and and and so so is it the way the world is today and and this is why you don't want we don't want to disregard what God has said can you say man there's a treasure chest in this word there there is prospering in this word there there's ability to have success in your Christian walk in this word and so he goes on the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned ain't that right so Paul tells us the things of God are taught he goes on he says but they're not taught in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual oh aren't you glad you got the Holy Ghost yeah I tell you what what what does it do it opens up another world it reveals things that you would have never been able to comprehend with your natural mind ain't that right so here now Paul is saying we have the mind of Christ we're not looking at the word and trying to think man what in the world is going on we we've got the mind of Christ to come and seek with the word of God can you say Amen the mind of Christ is opening the the revealed Mysteries to us eyes and I believe that and and notice the mind is what we think with it's the intellect and and so the Bible speaks of a Godly knowledge uh Revelation and things which comes by the mind of God ain't that right Revelation uh coming it's the mind of God to you and and so he's saying we have the mind of Christ in other words these things have been opened these these things have come to us which you we know that Paul was actually speaking of our day can you say amen and so I believe that in this age the mind of God has been given to us through the opening of the word ain't that right Paul would talk and and a lot of times Paul talked in riddles if if you don't say that and and it was all mystery form and even Paul Peter would say these things that are hard to be understood but but here God would open them up to you and I in in a time that that we would need to meditate and the time that we don't need the questions in the time that we need to be assured as to where we stand it's it's in a time that that that when when the obstacles are before us and Satan is trying to throw the questions we we've got to be as Christ did and come back with the word of God can you say amen and and and have it rightly divided unless he's so so we know the mighty angel coming down with that open book and and we know the mighty Angel is Christ and and the presence of God is here to anoint the word to us do you believe that it's here to anoint the word and and so that that we we know that the the the angel the mighty Angel gave that book to the the uh uh seventh angel to give us the true interpretation of the word of the book ain't that right why was that it was to direct our thoughts it was to direct our thoughts have you ever just you know um I I think as I've said this morning you know we've had this Bible for years and and yet it's only brought forth questions and debate and one preaching this and one preaching that and one preaching his thoughts about it and and no doubt they there were good thoughts and and they're good intentions and had a lot of commentaries and things like that but it could never bring us to an absolute it good things but it never would bring us to an absolute ain't that right but then and so how could you be positive about that you know you might go that direction but still you just uh uh something just wasn't you know uh fully satisfying amen but then when God would send a prophet and vindicate him so thoroughly that we could look and and when he began to to break the word down to us it would open our understanding is that not what Jesus did on to the two on the way of to Emmaus amen he opened their eyes the eyes of their understanding was opened and I believe that we're sitting here tonight A people that has the eyes of their understanding opened ain't that right so we're not looking and as you know think of it after that's the time that maybe we would read Joshua and we would read even the book of Ephesians or we would read whatever and we wouldn't know how to place these things we knew it being the word of God it was true but how do we apply it you know and and things that it would take a profit a man to open it up to us and to apply it to us and and again it was to directing our thoughts not just reading the Bible a year all the way through every year but it was to direct our thoughts to where we would become a channel now uh brother Branham in another place that think the right thing you got to think the right thing come to church think the right thing how many people coming to church hearing the word but not thinking the right thing because it ain't directed in the right way it's it's it's not with true interpretations you understand what I'm saying I I and when I say think the right thing on uh you know uh I know in the natural you got to think the right things of this but I'm just talking you know that you could be sitting in church I mean I'm I'm I personally am glad that I'm not listening you know I'm not wasn't setting under David koresh I mean he brought their thoughts to something that wasn't the right thing Jim Jones brought his followers to something that wasn't the right thing but when we're hearing a Vindicated prophet it we can rest assure he's channeling our thoughts into the right thing why he was taking us over into the Promised Land can you I hope you understand see and so then if we're coming into the promised land which I believe that we're there I I believe the land is open before us and and the way to be successful in the land is to think the right thing and right and and and and not get our minds so clogged up with the world and and and with what all this is going on you know uh uh our we've been giving an understanding that the world knows nothing about we've been given understanding of the things that God has prepared for us how many people talk about Rapture and yet they don't have the right thing about it the interpretation so they're they're looking at it but it's not the right thing that they're thinking about right they're looking at maybe at the resurrection we believe in a resurrection but but uh you know uh uh but it's not the way that that that God intended it to be they've got their own idea to it so their thoughts a man isn't isn't channeled right but I believe that God has by his grace opened up our minds opened up the channels because we are a channel that God works through do you believe that we're a channel that God works through and Satan knows that just as well and this is why uh he gets our minds in in such a so busy in life he gets us so busy caught up in and our thoughts are are you know just everyday thoughts if we're not careful you know we're meditating upon other things instead of the word of God and so what I want tonight to do is just to encourage you a man that that guard your thoughts guard your mind can you say man we're the body of Christ and and and and and and and these promises the only way they can come to reality is the people of God right you you take any other people that would come into the promised land that was not part of Israel that that was not setting under a prophet Ministry that that land meant nothing to them the promises that God gave Israel meant nothing to to to that other individual you understand uh but it was Israel sitting under the prophetic message the prophetic word that that them promises were directed to it that land meant something to them and so they weren't just coming as a stranger they were coming as possessors of that land that they weren't coming as squatters they they were coming because God had given them the promise to possess it can you say amen and so God wanted them to keep their mind upon the word of God don't forget the word don't forget the promises don't forget amen these things can you say man so we we find that we're a channel and and the meditation of the world is so far different than that of the Spirit-filled believer there is a lot said in the Bible about meditation on the word and and um we read there in Joshua but Psalm 63 and 5 David says my soul shall be satisfied as with moral and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips what a difference now do you believe that that scripture still is applicable to us today I believe it is but what a difference it that scripture is compared to the negativity that is around us today a world they are so negative in their thinking they're talking they're you know and and if we're not careful that Spirit tries to anoint us to where we talk negative we we think negative we our lives are negative everything about us is negative and we don't want to be negative you understand what I'm saying and and and and and so uh uh we we find here my soul shall be satisfied as with moral and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips not just when I'm on the Mountaintop every day this is the pattern ain't that rhyme a man win and notice what he says everybody say when so so this this my soul being satisfied is a result of something and and and my mouth praising thee with joyful lips is a result when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches ain't that right there's a reaction that comes with meditating upon the Lord Psalms 119 148 mine eyes prevent the night watches that I might meditate in Thy Word Psalms 119 78 let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely with me without calls but I will meditate in thy precepts and there's more scriptures amen that talk about meditation there is a reason that we are to meditate upon the word of God then you say amen and it was at that time in our opening scripture that right when they were coming into the promises God would tell him you must you must meditate upon this law and the words must not depart out of thy mouth and you say man and what are words from thoughts words is an expression of thought so when her mind is meditating upon the word when her mind is meditating upon up on the the promises of God it fills our mouth praise the Lord that's right amen do you love him amen if the musicians will come I love the Lord I think of the word the word of God meditating upon the word of course the word of God is our light the Bible says that Thy Word is a light when the doctors shuts off all hope of living or or always being you know whatever or the word gives us light to see something different when the Gloom is all around which it is the word of God is our light for us to see beyond it when there's no hope and the world ain't providing the answers the word of God is our light to where we can see the answer ain't that right the world the world there there's there's you know as Paul would say if I had hope in this life only I'd be of all men most miserable we have the tribulation coming upon the Earth the wrath of God the plagues and men's hearts in this age are failing them for fear looking after those things which are coming could you imagine being in that state and yet the word of God is our light that gives us [Music] something that we can see that's different for us I'm so glad for that I'm so glad we need we had a prophet that tell us these things that you will not the church will not go through tribulation the church will not face the the evils and the things it it will not Prevail upon the church can you say Amen and that word is our light [Music] the word when when you you feel unworthy and you feel like you've you've messed up and you feel like you know you've crossed that line and yet we've had a word to come to us and tell us that a Christian cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost we've had a word that comes and tells us you are Justified as though you've never done it you are spotless you are the The Virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ do you realize that is a light to us that that word is a light that that when these things that of gloom and doom and and and all the things that Satan is putting in there Amen to try to cover us up that word would give us light beyond all of that to we we could see a way out that we see us a way of Escape we we we can see ourselves a man above the clouds ain't that right amen and and so this is why it's important to meditate upon the word of God you meditation is so important and I'd like to get into that more but because the word of God gives us light to see can you say man it's positive there's nothing negative in Christianity it's all positive ain't that right so so the mind of God gives us a positive thinking I'm talking World positive thinking the way the world deals with that so the word of God is a light that makes the promises of God to shine to where we see something different than what the average guy sees can you say Amen I don't know about you that I hope I hope you can see something different people are trying to commit suicide trying to end their lives lean into all kinds of things you realize the millions of people that live life feeling hopeless but here God has given you a mind God has given you his life [Music] not trying to imagine the magically thinking something up but it's it's it's it's a true thing that cannot change you know this word is a love letter to you it's a love letter if you view it any other way you're missing the point because brother Brown said it's a love letter and when we can see it that way it's our life that we can see the love of God to us we can see the promises to us we can see that he's prepared heaven for me we can see that he's staged he's prepared the rapture he has sent down his power quickening power for me so he can't lead me in this world the way it is he can't lead me to where I go in the tribulation he's made a way of Escape I think we have something positive to meditate upon you believe that you've got something positive because if you meditate upon anything else you'll just hold your head down the rest of your life you always live in Wonder you'll always live in defeat you'll always live wondering can I can I overcome it can I you know is it possible is it can I really make it can I really be that am I I don't know let's settle the questions the word of God is settled forever meditate upon it don't give the devil a chance to fill you up with questions that are meaningless to where you get to wander in who you really are it's time to know who we are whether you feel it or not it's a positive source because the word doesn't change with you the word doesn't change I don't know who it was that I was listening to but someone may remember who it was and I just heard it the other day how I said God starts backwards man starts forward it begins to work something up but God starts backwards and I thought man that's that's pretty powerful because he would choose you glorify you justify you before you ever came so now he's working to what he's already done it's bringing you to the place that he's already accomplished I thought that's pretty good meditate think on them things can you say man oh my God's called us to be prosperous in him amen what song if you're mine [Music] Faithfully and I died sweet [Music] if you're just [Music] laid on me oh faithful and I will give you joy joy and peace [Music] if you'll just keep your mind [Music] [Music] future [Music] [Music] once again sing it now oh keep your mind you've been privileged still the mind of God I'm privilege to know his will his future [Music] don't meditate upon this whole world has no future meditative in the saints of God Hallelujah that are positive they're sure [Music] faith [Music] I will give you joy and peace sweet release [Music] [Music] power hits foreign just how important it is to think the right things [Music] we see Lord that you're not going to come and just wave a magic wand over us and then we go home but Lord we're stepping into this coming to this because the word is taken preeminence in our heart and our minds and I pray Lord that you would give us all that Grace to not look at the negative not sink on the negative and everything in this world's negative but Lord may we meditate upon the word you you so graciously have given it to us not just for head knowledge but just to meditate and let it drop down into our soul and let it control us and I pray Lord that the word becomes a reality to every one of us here may we not look at it as though it's something we can obtain for there's no way we can attain it in the human effort Lord you've given us the channel and that's our mind to sink on it to meditate upon it and as we meditate upon you as we talk of you as we think of you you come on the scene oh that's what we want to be as a people Lord that is not sidetracked not double-minded Lord the Lord May our thinking have Foundation to it everything that is negative comes from the Devil he gets us to make mistakes so he can tell us that we're not seen it gets us Lord to thinking of things or doing things falling or whatever in traps so he can [Music] his thoughts his voice becomes more pronounced foreign there's nothing solid about him he's a liar it may be Lord there might be those that hear whether it be a young person that are just meditating upon them thoughts of worthlessness and failures and I'm a nobody or may they see that them thoughts come from the Devil but Lord there is a provided source and that's your word that has been open to us and father may we discipline ourselves if I could say it that way Lord that to where we think upon you we get in your word we pray we commune with you that's more valuable than anything we can do upon this Earth father we love you we thank you for what you've done for us in this day foreign help us to take use of it Lord we love you Jesus name [Music] if you'll just keep your mind say it one more

Church we certainly appreciate every one of you and keep on the firing line amen and brother Wendell is going to be with us uh Wednesday night and he preached at brother Ron's and last night and today and just preached a really wonderful sermon last night and uh that we uh so he's going to be here Lord willing uh Wednesday so to minister and so we're looking forward to that and then Thursday uh we're uh several of his brothers I guess are going to Oklahoma and uh it's going to be a real fast trip to pick up that tent it's been ready for uh a month I guess and so we're going to pick that up and so we covet your prayers as we would travel and Lord Willem will be back Saturday evening so it's really going to be a fast trip and but looking forward to the fellowship and getting that and uh anyways got a lot of folks excited about the meeting and I'm excited about it and I'm just believing God to do something great and I'm glad that we're part of it I'm just glad we're a part of it uh yeah we're a small church but I'm glad we're part of it maybe a lot of work and but I see benefit in it and I see something that God is doing and and God has blessed it that's all I can say so it's definitely been beyond our Humanity uh uh our you know things it's just been a supernatural uh saying and I get so many uh testimonies from it and the healings and just heard the other day that brother had been looking you know just seeking for the Holy Ghost been you know and and God filled him uh with the Holy Ghost and one of the services and so to me that that's worth it there and uh just one soul to the Lord so all of our efforts every every effort that you put that we put it's it's not in vain and I believe God Smiles on us I just believe that it's something that would you see God moving in and and the people tell me all the time around they say these are the best being we've ever been you guys just uh you know and they come looking for answers they come looking for deliverances and and and God meets them and and I'm so glad for that I think I told you about the uh the the Mexican brother Hispanic brother that you know um they'd come with whatever he needed I think needed healing or whatever and his wife needed things and in her life and so she came to the prayer line he set back and watching the children so she could go and as he's just reverent and praying God came by his way didn't even go through the prayer line but God came by his way and healed him touched him and I just think that's just uh uh thank the Lord for that and so uh anyways uh the tent is about paid off and so we thank the Lord for that and and so looking forward to a great time amen so keep us in prayer uh because we're leaving out early I think at six meeting at six and leaving and uh so uh 6 16 17 hours down and 16 hours back so be tired but it'll be fun so God bless you brother Amos [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] God is mindful of us every aspect of our life amen praise the Lord so let's just bow our heads if all hearts are clear and uh brother John would you want to pray for dismisses [Music]
