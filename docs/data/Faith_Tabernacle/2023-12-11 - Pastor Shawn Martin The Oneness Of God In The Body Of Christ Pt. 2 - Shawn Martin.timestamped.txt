[20:09] we didn't even know it we didn't know it
[20:11] there was a foreign enemy an infection
[20:14] that was uh or disease or something that
[20:17] tried to encroach and sneak into our
[20:19] bodies but dear God you you stopped it
[20:22] dead in its tracks as only you can do we
[20:26] thank you for those things we thank you
[20:28] Lord God for Lord times that we were
[20:31] diagnosed with this or diagnosed with
[20:33] that and you healed us Lord God we don't
[20:37] give you enough of thanks for that I
[20:39] know we don't Lord father God this time

[20:58] brushed knees rolling off that first
[21:01] bicycle accident oh God and Stones
[21:04] hanging out of our skin Lord and pain
[21:06] that we experience Lord you healed it

[21:11] just we can't thank you enough Lord
[21:14] thank you Jesus thank you Lord people
[21:17] Lord we don't ever want to become
[21:19] callous Lord that we become so technical
[21:22] about things dear God that we can't see
[21:25] your hand of Deliverance of healing Lord
[21:29] whatever in our lives oh God over and
[21:33] over the about you said in your word in
[21:35] the psalmist Lord that day on the day

[21:50] own wife not feeling well today God
[21:52] these others Lord that was mentioned
[21:54] here that are out tonight Lord God not
[21:56] feeling well Lord we've never seen a
[21:59] time when the devil has certainly tried
[22:01] to attack the human body the uh the
[22:04] houses of the Believers to try to
[22:06] distract us to try to get us uh uh
[22:10] sideways or try to get us to not fulfill
[22:13] the perfect will of God lord if there's
[22:15] any of us here Lord he wish he could
[22:17] take our lives oh God so that we
[22:19] couldn't so that God's plan uh per a

[22:38] remember those in foreign lands I think
[22:40] dear God that brother that told me Lord
[22:43] we we take this heated air conditioned
[22:46] building Lord for granted too many times
[22:48] when people because of the law and the
[22:51] religion of the land they can't even
[22:53] meet in a public place of worship
[22:57] they've got to meet in homes because the
[22:59] religion that's predominant will not
[23:02] allow open Christian worship Lord God
[23:06] we're thankful God that we have that
[23:08] freedom here we pray for those Believers
[23:10] in those lands sometimes have to take
[23:13] secondary jobs dear God because they the
[23:16] the the religious uh majority of that
[23:20] Nation Lord will only allow their people
[23:23] to hold a higher paying jobs and
[23:26] Christians and and others minorities
[23:28] have to take what's left God we pray
[23:31] that you would bless your children Lord
[23:32] in every place in every continent Lord
[23:35] regardless of the political Lord the
[23:38] Demonic uh government that may be in
[23:41] place you can make a way where there
[23:44] seems to be no way we ask for
[23:46] deliverance tonight for those who are
[23:48] oppressed or even possessed of the Devil
[23:51] family members oh God we know that
[23:53] demonic possession Lord and oppression
[23:56] is going on all around us but dear God
[23:59] we are the ambassadors of deliverance we
[24:02] are your hand at work we are your right
[24:05] hand of authority here on this Earth and
[24:07] we bind the powers of the Demon Lord
[24:11] that would try to hinder us it with
[24:13] unbelief Lord and whatever dear God it's
[24:17] just a devil as we always Lord need to
[24:20] realize that it's our not our brother or
[24:22] sister but it's the devil we ask your
[24:24] blessing over the young people tonight

[44:15] and I've given them Thy word and they
[44:18] have received
[44:19] it and I you know as I've stated before
[44:24] I believe that this prayer is is really
[44:27] a pro prophetic of of our
[44:30] day and uh this Oneness uh existed
[44:35] between Jesus and the father for Jesus
[44:39] said the father and I are are
[44:41] one and the bride of Christ today is to
[44:44] manifest that same Oneness amen now
[44:49] Jesus for one he knew that he and the
[44:52] father were one he he was aware of that
[44:56] there was no questions about it I mean
[44:59] this is what he's saying in the prayer
[45:00] and this prayer is not question marks
[45:02] it's it's
[45:04] statements make them one as I you and I
[45:07] are one and I I think that this bride is
[45:12] not going to be one without her knowing
[45:13] it but she she is becoming fully aware
[45:17] of her
[45:18] relationship uh with with Christ amen
[45:22] and and so this Oneness is to occur in
[45:26] this age for John 14:20 Jesus said at
[45:30] that day you shall know that I am in my
[45:32] father you and me and I in you amen now
[45:35] I wasn't able to give you the scriptures
[45:38] uh uh brother Matthew so you forgive
[45:41] me uh there but brother brandham says
[45:46] that this that that scripture is to be
[45:48] for today at that day you shall know
[45:51] that I'm in my father you in me and I in
[45:54] you and as we said last Sunday night
[45:57] that this kind of Oneness cannot exist
[46:00] outside the body of Christ this Oneness
[46:05] must and can only be had by being
[46:09] baptized into the body of Christ to have
[46:12] this kind of
[46:13] Oneness now brother brandom talks about
[46:16] a person uh being being Having the Holy
[46:19] Ghost and he said this is the evidence
[46:21] of it he said make no mistake about it a
[46:26] person that is truly baptized by the
[46:29] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[46:32] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[46:34] will be in the word all the way amen he
[46:39] will be in the word all the way that is
[46:42] the evidence of being baptized with the
[46:46] Holy
[46:47] Ghost so so that's why there cannot be a
[46:51] Oneness without uh uh being baptized
[46:55] into to the body of Christ as we know as
[46:59] message Believers there was a
[47:01] Oneness uh that existed in the garden
[47:05] man and God was one yes man and his wife
[47:10] was one and because of this Oneness
[47:13] there was a fellowship man had
[47:16] fellowship with God and and what a what
[47:20] an honor that must have been in that
[47:23] time to to have have such a fellowship
[47:27] with God but we're even to have a
[47:31] greater fellowship with God Amen Adam
[47:35] Adam fellowship with God but he never
[47:37] knew God the way we know him never never
[47:39] knew God in in in his Saving Grace never
[47:43] knew God as as one that could pick up
[47:47] and and and fully restore but we are
[47:50] that that people that truly not and and
[47:55] and and and this is just my thoughts
[47:57] about it but I don't know I don't I'll
[48:01] just put it this way I don't know if
[48:02] Adam just truly understood God's mind
[48:05] all the way the way we understand it and
[48:08] and I'm I'm going to say I don't think
[48:09] he did because uh the Mysteries that
[48:12] have been revealed today has been hidden
[48:15] in the mind of God from the foundation
[48:18] of the world so then you know what what
[48:23] uh Oneness that Adam had I I truly
[48:26] believe that we we've come into a
[48:28] greater Oneness than even that but man
[48:31] and God was one and because of this they
[48:34] had the fellowship as we have said
[48:36] before that man was made to achieve for
[48:39] God but but he could only do that when
[48:42] he was one with God and so when he broke
[48:45] that Oneness with God then then he he
[48:48] become a failure and he he just well all
[48:51] of us were were uh born failures because
[48:55] we we were born the wrong way and and
[48:58] and so when we had that that rebirth
[49:02] that new birth then we begin to find our
[49:05] identity not in the world but find our
[49:08] identity in God and and then we find
[49:12] that that that we begin to come to our
[49:14] true purpose and and that's when we
[49:17] begin to really be able to achieve
[49:20] because we come back into fellowship
[49:22] with God but it takes a Oneness in order
[49:26] to achieve and and uh you know brother
[49:30] brandham uses the example of a watch and
[49:34] and how that uh every part of that watch
[49:37] has to to work in Harmony in order to
[49:40] for that watch to to really keep perfect
[49:43] time see uh uh but but when when
[49:47] everything about this watch wants to
[49:49] work uh something contrary to uh and
[49:54] each element or each piece of the watch
[49:57] you know begins to do its own thing then
[50:00] the watch has no reason for
[50:03] existence ain't that right see we got we
[50:06] got to watch to keep time but if the
[50:09] watch won't work if if everything about
[50:12] that watch that makes the watch just
[50:14] wants to do its own thing then why
[50:17] what's the point of having a watch and
[50:19] so is it in in this day like brother
[50:22] Braham said he said no matter how good
[50:24] the jewels are on watch it's got to keep
[50:27] in perfect time or It's Made In Vain and
[50:30] if the church isn't unified then it
[50:32] exists in vain if the church is not
[50:36] achieving what God has ordained it to be
[50:39] then it's not in vain now do you think
[50:42] God will start a church and promise to
[50:44] build a church only for it to be in vain
[50:48] God you know if if if man can make a
[50:50] watch to make it work and all the time
[50:52] pieces work to where we can actually
[50:53] keep time with it then surely God knows
[50:56] how to do a
[50:57] church for it to uh uh uh to to bring it
[51:01] into Oneness you believe that so then
[51:04] brother brand says see God's purpose is
[51:06] for us to unify together and be one but
[51:10] but true oness is only when we become
[51:14] one with the word because what good is
[51:17] Oneness if we have no fellowship with
[51:19] God right amen what what good is Oneness
[51:22] when God doesn't approve of it true and
[51:25] and so now Satan is not against Oneness
[51:28] now now we surely all know that anything
[51:31] that Satan has something to do with one
[51:34] thing he's going to do is he's going to
[51:36] try to bring a
[51:38] Oneness it's just that way uh you get a
[51:42] person disgruntled in a church that
[51:44] person cannot stay disgruntled by
[51:46] himself he just can't he's anointed and
[51:51] so what he does is he tries to bring as
[51:54] many as possible
[51:56] to be disgruntled with him because it's
[51:59] no good standing alone being disgruntled
[52:02] when everybody else is in
[52:03] unity so but that's that's just the way
[52:07] it is he knows the power that Oneness
[52:11] has and but it's it's as we know it's
[52:13] it's a perverted Oneness now we talked
[52:16] about it last uh Sunday evening but the
[52:19] Tower of Babel is a great example of
[52:21] Satan's Oneness Genesis 11:1 the whole
[52:25] Earth was of one language and of one
[52:27] speech the third verse and they said to
[52:31] one another go to let us make brick burn
[52:33] them thoroughly and they had brick for
[52:36] stone and slime and had they uh had they
[52:39] for Mortar and they said go to let us
[52:43] build a city and a tower whose top May
[52:46] reach unto heaven and let us make a name
[52:49] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[52:50] face of the whole earth sixth verse it
[52:53] says and the Lord said behold the people
[52:56] is one and they have all one language
[52:59] and this they began to do and now
[53:01] nothing will be restrained from them
[53:04] which they have imagined to do so it it
[53:07] it truly is an example of Oneness and
[53:10] what they are was able to achieve by
[53:12] Oneness but it was the wrong Oneness
[53:14] because it was against God's word it God
[53:18] they did not confer with God they they
[53:20] did not seek his will they did not
[53:22] receive instructions from God it was a
[53:25] Oneness that was inspired of the devil
[53:28] and and so uh uh uh this kind of Oneness
[53:32] U was was a carnal man with a carnal
[53:35] mind trying to uh achieve a carnal thing
[53:39] and and and all that Oneness they were
[53:42] against God's plan against God's word
[53:45] against his his uh his uh uh uh purpose
[53:50] so then uh uh it's carnal unregenerate
[53:54] man coming together in Oneness and then
[53:57] we see what happens well if there's ever
[54:00] a time that man is becoming one it's
[54:03] it's in this age brother brandham said
[54:06] the Tower of Babel in that day speaks of
[54:08] this ecclesiastical world in the last
[54:11] days which is
[54:13] now right now and he says they will
[54:16] finally unite under the Antichrist a
[54:20] man-made religion so the world is
[54:23] uniting whether we see it or not it is
[54:27] uniting they're coming together laws are
[54:30] being P things behind the scene uh that
[54:34] you know it's it's happening very rapid
[54:37] and one of these days it's going to
[54:39] happen and it's going to manifest itself
[54:42] and and and it it'll be just like that
[54:45] but it's already happening under
[54:47] cover the man the prophet said the
[54:50] man-made religions will all come into
[54:52] this Antichrist religion there will be
[54:54] two forms of them one form will come
[54:58] from Rome which will be the Beast and
[55:00] there is an image unto the Beast which
[55:03] will be the ecclesiastical head of the
[55:05] Protestant Church Heap up as an image
[55:08] unto the Beast under the denominational
[55:10] world and it'll all everybody say all
[55:14] come under one great dominion and the
[55:18] Antichrist will be the one that's
[55:20] enthroned and seated see anti anti means
[55:23] against see almost exactly alike but yet
[55:27] his teaching isn't from the scriptures
[55:30] enough of the scriptures he's got enough
[55:32] of the scriptures to make it look like
[55:33] it's right but it's wrong amen see and
[55:37] and so uh it's not it's not the people
[55:41] in denominations that we speak against
[55:44] when we talk of denominations and so you
[55:46] must understand that it's the system of
[55:49] denominations that's got the people
[55:51] bound and and blind and and and the
[55:55] people you you I feel sorry for them and
[55:58] I I wish to God that we could reach
[56:00] every individual that we could to show
[56:03] them the truth sure and and because it's
[56:06] it's happening and and the people are
[56:08] being sucked into it left and right and
[56:12] so because it's a great deception but
[56:15] but we see just in this day like the
[56:16] United
[56:17] Nations you know they they they're
[56:20] trying their best to bring all nations
[56:23] together that's this you know that's
[56:25] really why they were established they're
[56:27] trying to bring a Oneness by TR Trying
[56:30] by bringing all the nations into one
[56:32] great big Brotherhood the prophet said
[56:35] it's a Brotherhood under a United power
[56:39] but it's not working is it it it it
[56:42] can't work but yet it's it's it's it's
[56:45] Satan trying to bring everything under a
[56:49] power brother BM talked about Russia we
[56:52] know Russia is a communist country and
[56:54] he said now Russia's got a false
[56:57] Pentecost and he said uh uh in in other
[57:02] words they're trying to force all men to
[57:05] communist they're trying to bring
[57:07] everybody under that that communist uh
[57:11] um uh government or or whatever but it's
[57:14] a work of the devil and so brother
[57:16] brandom called it a false communist and
[57:20] and and see to where every man has all
[57:23] things in common
[57:25] now Isaiah
[57:27] 54:15 uh God saying behold they shall
[57:31] surely gather together but not by me
[57:33] they'll come into a Oneness there'll be
[57:35] an assembly but it won't be by me see
[57:38] and whosoever Shall Gather together
[57:40] against thee so now think of this
[57:42] Gathering it's it's it's the purpose of
[57:44] this Gathering is against
[57:46] God ain't that right you'll either
[57:49] gather for God or you gather against God
[57:52] but you will not you cannot remain in
[57:54] the middle that's right and and so this
[57:56] Gathering they're going to gather but
[57:58] it's not by me but notice the reason
[58:01] whosoever Shall Gather against thee
[58:03] shall fall for thy sake see so so and
[58:07] and he's who who shall ever that the
[58:09] Gathering against the children of God is
[58:12] is is basically what he's talking about
[58:14] whether it was Israel or whether it's
[58:15] the bride or whatever it's it's it's
[58:18] there's always been a bitterness a
[58:19] hatred be uh uh against the the true
[58:22] seed of God but thinking of this Oneness
[58:25] uh a false uh Pentecost and and things
[58:29] there was a Oneness at
[58:31] Pentecost and and Acts 2 and 1 and when
[58:35] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[58:37] were all everybody say all with one
[58:40] Accord in one place amen the 44th verse
[58:45] uh of the second chapter and all that
[58:48] believed were together and had all
[58:51] things in common so that's what Russia
[58:54] is trying to do under communism that's
[58:56] what social all these things they're
[58:58] trying to bring everything where all men
[59:00] have things in common but it's under a
[59:03] false Pentecost but this was a true
[59:06] Pentecost and it brought all things in
[59:09] common it brought the people together
[59:11] the elect uh uh acts 4:32 and the
[59:16] multitude of them that believed were of
[59:18] one heart of one Soul neither said any
[59:22] of them that ought of uh
[59:25] of the things which he possessed was his
[59:27] own but they had all things in common
[59:31] ain't that right so Satan is is trying
[59:34] to have the Oneness that they had at
[59:36] Pentecost without having the Pentecostal
[59:38] experience no wonder brother brandom
[59:40] kept hollering and and and and and
[59:43] telling us and crying out go back to
[59:45] Pentecost go back to Pentecost go back
[59:47] to Pentecost what is he saying not to go
[59:50] back into an upper room you know and and
[59:53] I know the word it's been quoted the
[59:56] Lord knows we believe it that the word
[59:57] at Pentecost don't work for today but
[59:59] you got to go back to
[1:00:01] Pentecost everybody say you got to go
[1:00:03] back to Pentecost if you didn't have to
[1:00:05] go back to Pentecost the prophet
[1:00:06] wouldn't have said
[1:00:07] it the same one that said the word won't
[1:00:11] work at Pentecost for today like it did
[1:00:13] back is the same one that cried out over
[1:00:15] and over and over go back to
[1:00:19] Pentecost why it's the only way you're
[1:00:21] going to get a
[1:00:22] Oneness it's the only way that this one
[1:00:24] between God and and and us and and the
[1:00:27] church can exist because it's a
[1:00:29] Pentecostal
[1:00:31] experience on can you say amen and and
[1:00:36] so Satan is is got this false Pentecost
[1:00:39] that he's trying but what is he trying
[1:00:40] to do he's trying to bring it through
[1:00:42] force force everything is about Force
[1:00:45] everything that Satan does force yeah
[1:00:47] you don't like my way I'll force you to
[1:00:49] like my way oh if you if you don't live
[1:00:52] the way I live then I'm going to force
[1:00:54] you to live the way I live look that the
[1:00:57] homosexuals ain't happy with us the way
[1:00:59] we
[1:01:00] are so what do they want to do they want
[1:01:02] to make
[1:01:04] you accept their
[1:01:07] lifestyle they want to make us teach our
[1:01:10] children their lifestyle they're not
[1:01:13] happy with us saying man you're nuts now
[1:01:17] if they want to F we're nuts we don't go
[1:01:19] in there and try to make them look you
[1:01:21] know agree with
[1:01:23] us you understand you know what I'm
[1:01:24] saying but Satan will force you to
[1:01:27] believe the way he wants you to believe
[1:01:29] they'll take your children away they'll
[1:01:31] take they're going to they they'll try
[1:01:32] to close your
[1:01:35] churches it's it's it's a Oneness
[1:01:37] through force and Satan has always tried
[1:01:41] to force the people into a Oneness but
[1:01:43] God never forces his people together
[1:01:50] never you see the the people that he's
[1:01:52] ordained for
[1:01:55] a Oneness they they were ordained before
[1:01:58] the foundation of the world and they're
[1:02:00] the ones that's going to truly unite
[1:02:02] together and and Pentecost did not come
[1:02:06] by force but you know how it came them
[1:02:08] people they God didn't force them
[1:02:10] together but it come by the life of God
[1:02:13] quickening the word seed within them the
[1:02:16] life of God come in them and Quicken
[1:02:20] that word
[1:02:21] seed and all of a sudden these people
[1:02:24] people had all things in common they
[1:02:27] were together praise the Lord they they
[1:02:30] come together you understand what I'm
[1:02:32] saying so this is what God promised
[1:02:35] through the prophet Joel he says you
[1:02:37] know acts 2:17 and it shall come to pass
[1:02:40] in the last day sayith God I will pour
[1:02:42] out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:02:44] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:02:46] and your young men shall see Visions
[1:02:47] your old men shall dream dreams and on
[1:02:49] my servants and handmaids I will pour
[1:02:52] out in those days my of my spirit and
[1:02:54] they shall prophesy ain't that right but
[1:02:57] notice Jesus told his disciples
[1:02:59] beforehand he says now in Luke 24:49
[1:03:02] behold I send thee promise now this is
[1:03:06] what what was promised in Joel in Joel I
[1:03:09] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:03:12] but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem
[1:03:15] until you be endued with power from on
[1:03:17] high ain't that right so they were
[1:03:19] together in one heart one mind one
[1:03:23] Accord waiting for this promise to come
[1:03:27] it was not a force it was a people that
[1:03:31] wanted to be a part of the promise of
[1:03:34] God they weren't wrestling with the
[1:03:36] promise of God they weren't denying the
[1:03:38] promise of God but but they were
[1:03:42] earnestly looking for this
[1:03:45] promise and it and it brought them into
[1:03:48] one heart one mind one Accord ain't that
[1:03:53] right see so now denominations are
[1:03:56] trying to have Unity apart from the word
[1:03:58] of God and and brother brandom says now
[1:04:00] the great Harlot of Revelation 17 these
[1:04:03] balum teachers with their false Doctrine
[1:04:05] is marrying the church into that kind of
[1:04:09] a mess see watch when it comes to a
[1:04:12] showdown at the end time look at the
[1:04:13] weakness of it now 900 and some
[1:04:15] different organizations one pulling one
[1:04:18] way the other pull in this way there's
[1:04:20] no Unity among them and they're trying
[1:04:23] to bring Unity but that Unity is not
[1:04:26] backed by the word of God God's original
[1:04:29] plan they're taking it in by politics
[1:04:32] and
[1:04:34] organization you can't have Oneness
[1:04:36] among God's people by politics and
[1:04:39] organization ain't that right amen now
[1:04:43] just to try to hurry I won't keep you
[1:04:45] long but we know what broke the Oneness
[1:04:47] in the Garden of Eden is Eve could not
[1:04:50] wait we talked about it last Sunday amen
[1:04:52] God told Eve and Adam Adam told him to
[1:04:55] multiply replenish the Earth but when
[1:04:57] Adam came to her he found her with the
[1:04:59] wrong seed and and she was pregnated
[1:05:02] corrupted and and things and so she had
[1:05:05] be been United with something else in in
[1:05:08] the wrong way and she lusted for
[1:05:11] knowledge she lusted she wasn't content
[1:05:14] with the word of God she had the word of
[1:05:17] God and if she would have stayed with
[1:05:19] the word of God everything would have
[1:05:20] worked out just perfect for her but she
[1:05:24] could not she lusted after knowledge and
[1:05:26] Satan made sure she got it wrecked her
[1:05:30] life wrecked wrecked the home wrecked
[1:05:32] the fellowship wrecked it all ain't that
[1:05:35] right see she wasn't satisfied with the
[1:05:37] word the word's got everything that we
[1:05:40] need it does ain't that right we find
[1:05:43] out also that Israel was not satisfied
[1:05:45] with the word and and and that that
[1:05:48] bride God's Hebrew bride uh uh he found
[1:05:52] her pregnated with the word
[1:05:54] and and the prophet said they rejected
[1:05:56] the leadership of God when they rejected
[1:05:59] the prophet and wanted a king see so the
[1:06:02] the word come to a prophet that's how
[1:06:04] God would rule his people is by the word
[1:06:07] of God that come to a prophet ain't that
[1:06:09] right but they rejected God's leadership
[1:06:12] Samuel thought it was all all about him
[1:06:15] and he said Lord they rejected me and
[1:06:17] God says no no no no they didn't reject
[1:06:19] you they've rejected me that I should
[1:06:21] not Reign Over them well how would God
[1:06:23] Reign over them by his word that they
[1:06:27] wanted to come like everybody else and
[1:06:29] be United under
[1:06:31] politics they rejected God's leadership
[1:06:34] and I I say this that any time a person
[1:06:37] becomes dissatisfied with the word of
[1:06:39] God Satan will impregnate them with the
[1:06:42] wrong seeden do not become s
[1:06:45] dissatisfied with the word of God ain't
[1:06:48] that right amen if you are sick tonight
[1:06:51] be satisfied with the word of God
[1:06:55] if if you are discouraged and you're at
[1:06:58] the bottom of the beer be satisfied with
[1:07:01] the word of God
[1:07:05] Amen if your marriage has fallen apart
[1:07:07] be satisfied with the word of God if
[1:07:11] your children is is gone wavered and and
[1:07:13] it just seems impossible for them to
[1:07:15] come back be
[1:07:17] satisfied with the promise of God be
[1:07:21] satisfied with the word of God right
[1:07:24] ain't that right wait wait don't don't
[1:07:28] get impatient like you did the word will
[1:07:31] come the word will manifest itself
[1:07:33] there's power in that
[1:07:36] word and if he would have just
[1:07:38] recognized that that there's power oh if
[1:07:41] she would just waited for that word to
[1:07:43] come to
[1:07:44] her but she didn't she got impatient now
[1:07:49] notice the true bride must be unii
[1:07:52] unified the prophet said by the word you
[1:07:55] cannot come in unification outside the
[1:07:58] word of
[1:08:00] God ain't that right now that goes for
[1:08:04] anything if you want your ministry Let
[1:08:07] It Be unified by the word of
[1:08:09] God if you want your gifts Let It Be
[1:08:12] unified by the word of God you you don't
[1:08:15] want it to prosper when God ain't in it
[1:08:18] you you you you you don't want something
[1:08:20] else amen and the glitter and the
[1:08:22] glamour you don't want promotion of man
[1:08:24] if God ain't promoting
[1:08:26] it and I don't want to promote anything
[1:08:28] if God ain't promoting it you understand
[1:08:31] what I'm saying the the true bride must
[1:08:34] be unified by the word of
[1:08:37] God
[1:08:39] Amen and the bride of Christ will never
[1:08:42] unify around anything else but the word
[1:08:44] of God brother brandham called it
[1:08:47] assembling together in The Fellowship of
[1:08:49] the word amen he says the fellowship of
[1:08:54] the word that's right fellowshipping
[1:08:55] setting together in Heavenly places in
[1:08:58] Christ Jesus tonight one Accord one
[1:09:01] place one Spirit one mind one hope one
[1:09:04] God one purpose amen there you are every
[1:09:08] here's the fellowship every time the
[1:09:10] Bible says anything we say Amen see
[1:09:15] punctuating every word with amen Jesus
[1:09:18] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:09:20] forever amen be baptized in the name of
[1:09:23] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin we
[1:09:26] say amen amen can you say Amen see amen
[1:09:30] everything just amen amen amen right on
[1:09:33] down see in
[1:09:35] Fellowship the Lord I'm the god that
[1:09:38] Health thee of all thy diseases and we
[1:09:40] say
[1:09:42] Amen but it may be impossible it may
[1:09:45] this and the doctor saying this but we
[1:09:46] stay virtuous to that
[1:09:48] word come United by the
[1:09:52] word now now Matthew 24:27 it says for
[1:09:56] as the lightning cometh out of the East
[1:09:58] and shineth even unto the West so shall
[1:10:01] also the coming of the son of man be for
[1:10:03] where wheresoever the carcass is there
[1:10:06] will the Eagles be gathered together so
[1:10:09] what brings that Oneness the carcass the
[1:10:12] revealed word of God the same word that
[1:10:14] was in the East is now in the west the
[1:10:17] same son of man the same power the same
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ in every way is he the same
[1:10:23] except his Corporal body ain't that
[1:10:25] right and every elect of God has come in
[1:10:29] together around this in
[1:10:32] Oneness it's a Oneness you see then our
[1:10:36] word the word is our headship now Satan
[1:10:39] will promote any kind of Oneness when
[1:10:41] it's apart from the word of God and he's
[1:10:44] for Oneness so don't don't don't ever
[1:10:46] think he's not he's for Oneness but he
[1:10:49] can never bring a pure
[1:10:51] Oneness but he is for Oneness and and
[1:10:54] but it's always that Oneness is apart
[1:10:56] from the word of God uh uh doing
[1:10:59] something outside the word of God
[1:11:01] ignoring the word of God half beli in
[1:11:03] the word of God you know it's it's it's
[1:11:06] always that way and yet brother brandham
[1:11:09] said the unity that we're wanting is a
[1:11:11] spiritual unity and he says see
[1:11:14] spiritual Unity with his word and with
[1:11:18] him Unity right so in another place he
[1:11:22] said the peering of Christ and the
[1:11:24] coming of Christ see it's two different
[1:11:25] words altoe Christ is appearing in these
[1:11:29] last days in his church bringing his
[1:11:33] church together in unity and faith and
[1:11:37] Power in the word all together that when
[1:11:40] he returns he will find the same church
[1:11:44] amen that's right ain't that right so
[1:11:48] what is this message doing and remember
[1:11:50] it's only to the elect now you got all
[1:11:53] kinds of Isom and schisms in the message
[1:11:56] you got all kinds of crazy things that
[1:11:58] that go on in the message it does not
[1:12:00] take away from the reality of this
[1:12:02] message because the message is not to
[1:12:05] bring everyone in unity it's not to
[1:12:07] bring it all to one great big
[1:12:09] Brotherhood as as as what they're trying
[1:12:12] to do in the world Council of churches
[1:12:15] there's people that's in this message
[1:12:16] does not want to walk with the
[1:12:18] word they just don't and how many
[1:12:21] preachers preach this message like it's
[1:12:23] a legalist thing forcing the people to
[1:12:27] operate that's
[1:12:29] right it's true they can't get them to a
[1:12:32] real birth so they'll do it they'll do
[1:12:34] it outwardly then you got to do this you
[1:12:37] got to do that you got to do this you
[1:12:39] got to do this and and and in all
[1:12:41] reality it just brings Hypocrites amen
[1:12:45] it ain't bringing people into the
[1:12:46] Fellowship of the word it's not bringing
[1:12:48] people into fellowship and love to God
[1:12:51] it's really just bringing hardened heart
[1:12:54] Hearts where people don't even know how
[1:12:56] to believe in God they don't even know
[1:12:59] how to stand in faith on the word of God
[1:13:01] that's but you talking about holy people
[1:13:03] you talking about moral people you talk
[1:13:05] about outward outward appearance people
[1:13:07] they outshine any day you understand
[1:13:09] what I'm saying but the Muslims do
[1:13:15] that you you can't bring people to
[1:13:18] Christianity by
[1:13:20] government so this message is a message
[1:13:23] of grace to the elect amen and and this
[1:13:27] message see Christ is appearing how many
[1:13:30] believe that this message is Christ
[1:13:32] brother bradam he says it he said the
[1:13:35] message is Christ see why because it's
[1:13:39] it's Christ manifesting this
[1:13:41] word right so Christ is appearing in
[1:13:45] these last days in his church bringing
[1:13:49] his church his body together in unity
[1:13:53] and faith and Power in the word all
[1:13:56] together brother Brandon preached the
[1:13:58] message leadership I don't know if
[1:13:59] you've all heard it but if you haven't
[1:14:01] you really need to listen to
[1:14:03] it it's not a it's not a in in what we
[1:14:08] would call a real powerful church
[1:14:10] service he's I think in a home in there
[1:14:13] in Prescot he's at a community it's a
[1:14:16] gan and Leo I think I think that's where
[1:14:18] it was they had gotten a a a community
[1:14:22] thing where everybody lived on the the
[1:14:23] same property and trailers and all that
[1:14:25] well they've invited brother brandom to
[1:14:26] come yeah and he's talking to the young
[1:14:29] people he's talking to a a young
[1:14:31] generation and and so it sounds like
[1:14:33] it's just for kids and so he's talking
[1:14:36] you know but really if if you think of
[1:14:38] what he's doing he's actually talking to
[1:14:41] the bride in general and and and so he's
[1:14:45] speaking that there has to be a
[1:14:48] leadership come follow me and remember
[1:14:51] he talks about Christ talking to that
[1:14:52] Rich Young ruler and and he wanted
[1:14:55] eternal life how do I get it and he said
[1:14:57] sell all that thy thou Hast and come and
[1:15:00] follow me and the Rich Young Ruler could
[1:15:02] not do that because he had great values
[1:15:04] and all of this and he couldn't sell all
[1:15:06] that you know and and so he walked away
[1:15:09] but there there there was the headship
[1:15:12] the message the word that that has been
[1:15:14] restored in this day and now the the the
[1:15:19] beckoning call was come follow me there
[1:15:22] is a leadership
[1:15:23] I know there there's all kinds of men
[1:15:25] that rises there's all kinds of
[1:15:26] organizations there's all kinds of
[1:15:28] things that that draws us to follow and
[1:15:31] this but now you know I I was talking to
[1:15:33] uh uh a Judas class online the other day
[1:15:37] uh uh a Bible study and and I I titled
[1:15:40] it the the the Vindication has taken
[1:15:43] away all confusion and and this this
[1:15:48] leadership the leadership that that we
[1:15:51] have been given in this day has been
[1:15:53] it's it's coming from a Vindicated
[1:15:55] message the message has been so
[1:15:58] thoroughly Vindicated that there should
[1:16:00] be not one question about it and here
[1:16:04] brother Brandon was fixing to go it's
[1:16:06] it's as it's at the end of his life that
[1:16:08] he's preaching this message everything
[1:16:11] all through the years God has Vindicated
[1:16:13] over and over and over and over now the
[1:16:15] rest of it is just follow me there is a
[1:16:19] leadership there is a gathering there is
[1:16:22] something that we can truly follow and
[1:16:24] not be
[1:16:27] misled yes sir the word has been Now set
[1:16:31] forth It's been thoroughly Vindicated
[1:16:33] now we are to follow without
[1:16:35] question can you say amen Amen brother
[1:16:39] brandham says this in in a couple places
[1:16:42] but I thought it was profound he said a
[1:16:45] real believer don't hear nothing
[1:16:47] everybody say nothing he doesn't hear
[1:16:50] nothing but the word amen that's that's
[1:16:53] all he watches the word that's that's
[1:16:57] that now this is how it's we're coming
[1:16:59] together now this is what's bringing us
[1:17:00] in a Unity a gathering that elect is
[1:17:02] because he watches the word he hears
[1:17:05] nothing but the word he ain't looking
[1:17:08] for no
[1:17:10] loopholes he ain't looking for no
[1:17:13] gimmicks he just believes God and that
[1:17:17] settles it and he just keeps
[1:17:20] going hallu amen that's right yeah amen
[1:17:24] another place he said the people tried
[1:17:26] them Pharisees and Sadducees and
[1:17:28] hypocrites and
[1:17:29] herodians and all of them tried to cast
[1:17:32] a shadow in
[1:17:33] Jesus but then True Believers that was
[1:17:36] predestinated to hear that message heard
[1:17:39] it and they seen no fault in it at
[1:17:43] all he said that's the same now those
[1:17:46] who believe him love him those who
[1:17:49] believe him see no fault in him they
[1:17:52] don't see see any heresy they don't see
[1:17:55] anything wrong they don't see anything
[1:17:58] wrong with his word they don't see
[1:18:00] anything wrong with his people they just
[1:18:02] see Jesus that's all see they're
[1:18:05] predestinated to eternal life so they
[1:18:07] just take sides with Jesus and stay
[1:18:11] there you get it that's the only way
[1:18:13] there can be a Oneness in among the
[1:18:16] elect is they have come to a place
[1:18:18] they're not picking this message
[1:18:21] apart amen yes that's right can you say
[1:18:24] Amen they're not picking the move of God
[1:18:27] apart they're not picking God's people
[1:18:31] apart
[1:18:32] hello you got quiet on that one but it's
[1:18:35] the truth you cannot have
[1:18:40] Oneness until we come to a place that we
[1:18:43] accept God and his message we we're
[1:18:47] willing to become one with the message
[1:18:50] and all these fault finders that are
[1:18:52] with the people of God that find fault
[1:18:53] with the people of God hey they find
[1:18:55] fault with the message too and it's a
[1:18:58] pure message it it's a perfect message
[1:19:01] and yet they want to they they they want
[1:19:03] to tell us all the things that are wrong
[1:19:05] with it and all that it's nothing but an
[1:19:09] unbeliever it's just an unbeliever
[1:19:11] wanting to take us away from the
[1:19:12] promises of
[1:19:14] [Applause]
[1:19:15] God the prophet says they those who
[1:19:18] believe him love him those who believe
[1:19:20] him see no fault in him they don't see
[1:19:22] any her they don't see anything wrong
[1:19:24] they don't see anything wrong with his
[1:19:25] word they don't see anything wrong with
[1:19:26] his people they just see Jesus that's
[1:19:28] all and see they're predestinated to
[1:19:31] eternal life so they just take sides
[1:19:33] with Jesus and and stay there and and
[1:19:35] you know what people say Well they're
[1:19:36] just gullible they're just gullible
[1:19:37] people willing to accept anything no
[1:19:39] it's not it's been
[1:19:41] Vindicated we're not following a David
[1:19:43] Caris you're drinking the Kool-Aid of
[1:19:44] Jim Jones and we're not drinking anybody
[1:19:47] else's
[1:19:48] Kool-Aid we're following Vindication
[1:19:51] that's right that's
[1:19:54] right the ones brother Brown said the
[1:19:57] ones who ought to have loved him the
[1:19:59] ones who ought to have been for him was
[1:20:01] his bitterest enemies and he had made up
[1:20:04] his little group out of a bunch of poor
[1:20:06] people fishermen tax gatherers
[1:20:09] uneducated the Bible said some of them
[1:20:11] was even ignorant and unlearned some
[1:20:15] could not even sign their name he never
[1:20:17] went to the churches to get his people
[1:20:19] he never agreed with any of the church
[1:20:21] leaders and besides that he followed the
[1:20:24] very trend of a prophet he condemned
[1:20:26] everything that they done as the ones
[1:20:29] before him had because they were a
[1:20:31] portion of the word and he was the word
[1:20:33] in its fullness notice but everybody say
[1:20:36] but in the midst of it all see through
[1:20:40] every age and every Prophet that had
[1:20:42] been or would be there is going to be a
[1:20:45] certain amount of people that's
[1:20:47] predestinated to hear that message and
[1:20:50] they will follow it they ignore the
[1:20:53] crowds they ignore the criticism of the
[1:20:55] unbeliever they have no argument with
[1:20:57] them they've got one thing to do and
[1:21:00] that's to believe and to get every bit
[1:21:02] of it they can soak it in like Mary who
[1:21:06] sat at the feet of Jesus prise the Lord
[1:21:10] last Sunday we read this scripture I'll
[1:21:11] read it again as we get ready to
[1:21:15] close Proverbs
[1:21:18] 311 says who can find a virtuous woman
[1:21:22] for a price is far above rubies the
[1:21:25] heart of her husband do safely trust in
[1:21:27] her so that he shall have no need of
[1:21:29] spoil she will do him good and not evil
[1:21:32] all the days of her
[1:21:34] life I thought of that and what a what a
[1:21:38] scripture and this isn't just a man
[1:21:40] writing this about a natural woman even
[1:21:44] though we're living in a day that
[1:21:45] there's
[1:21:46] very uh virtuous women left in the
[1:21:50] world and
[1:21:54] but I I think of the heart of God as
[1:21:58] he's speaking through this this
[1:22:00] man and the words are being pinned the
[1:22:03] heart of God looking for someone
[1:22:06] virtuous who who who who who is there
[1:22:09] that can just wait upon me until I bring
[1:22:12] my word to them who is it that could
[1:22:14] just accept my word and be satisfied
[1:22:16] with it instead of when something
[1:22:20] glittery or something greater is
[1:22:22] something better comes they they get
[1:22:24] sidetracked and they follow it and you
[1:22:26] know the Bible says when he came there
[1:22:28] was no comeliness that we should desire
[1:22:30] him there there was no beauty that we
[1:22:32] should desire him there was nothing
[1:22:34] about him that really was
[1:22:36] spectacular that that had a drawing card
[1:22:38] for the world but but the elect was
[1:22:41] drawn to him because they saw him for
[1:22:45] what he was he was the promise of life
[1:22:48] within him was the promise of life ain't
[1:22:51] that right and and and and so so but but
[1:22:54] see that that woman that virtuous woman
[1:22:57] is actually the bride of
[1:23:00] Christ and I am so glad that we could
[1:23:02] answer back that there can actually be
[1:23:04] an answer in this day to say there is
[1:23:07] that virtuous
[1:23:08] woman she's here that's right the Lord
[1:23:13] we are a people that is virtuous unto
[1:23:16] him what an honor that is
[1:23:21] amen Hallelujah she'll be the one to go
[1:23:24] in the Rapture you know because she's
[1:23:27] virtuous praise the
[1:23:29] Lord
[1:23:31] and not not
[1:23:34] because she's any whatever but it's
[1:23:38] because there's only one way for for for
[1:23:42] her to go in a Rapture there's only one
[1:23:43] way for a person to go in a
[1:23:45] Rapture and this scripture has been made
[1:23:48] plain to us in this day 1 Thessalonians
[1:23:51] 4:16 for the Lord Lord himself shall
[1:23:53] descend from heaven with a
[1:23:55] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:23:58] with the Trump of God and the dead and
[1:23:59] Christ shall rise first then we which
[1:24:02] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:24:05] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:24:07] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:24:09] be with the Lord you see
[1:24:12] before the dead in Christ can rise first
[1:24:15] and before we which are alive can be
[1:24:17] caught up together with them to meet the
[1:24:18] Lord in the air there has to be
[1:24:21] something take place
[1:24:23] and that's the shout The Voice the
[1:24:27] Trump and in all reality it's the
[1:24:30] word brother Brown said Christ does all
[1:24:35] three that's right and why she why is it
[1:24:38] that she's the only one that goes in the
[1:24:39] Rapture is because she's a virtuous
[1:24:41] woman that's right she's not
[1:24:45] impatient she's not in a hurry she's not
[1:24:47] going after some Fang dangle thing Satan
[1:24:51] you realize how many times Satan has
[1:24:52] offered us the same things that he has
[1:24:55] Eve and we keep turning him down that's
[1:24:59] right thank realize how many times that
[1:25:01] he has tried to get us to get
[1:25:03] impatient but there's no lust for
[1:25:05] knowledge we're literally settled in
[1:25:09] what God has said am am it's quickening
[1:25:13] something within us am and the prophet
[1:25:16] said the message is the shout that calls
[1:25:19] the bride together it brings them
[1:25:21] together it calls the bride and he
[1:25:24] brings them together true without this
[1:25:27] message there could be no
[1:25:30] Unity without this message there could
[1:25:33] be no Oneness because Jesus and the
[1:25:35] father were one with the word he was the
[1:25:38] word Christ God in Christ reconciling
[1:25:42] the world to himself amen now it's
[1:25:44] Christ in his bride amen the word he
[1:25:47] shows her his Word of Life she receives
[1:25:51] it she never never doubts it
[1:25:53] amen I hope it's helped you in some way
[1:25:57] brother brandom said the bride stands
[1:25:59] virtuous because when she heard the
[1:26:01] truth she came forth and the blood
[1:26:05] cleansed
[1:26:06] her amen you see it when you had a
[1:26:11] positive response to the message you
[1:26:14] didn't just sit there and say well I
[1:26:15] don't know I don't know if it's really
[1:26:17] right or not you know it saddens me when
[1:26:21] you got ministers in the message still
[1:26:23] still at that point they don't know
[1:26:24] whether it's right or
[1:26:26] wrong people don't know whether it's
[1:26:28] right or wrong but this bride will never
[1:26:31] be deceived she'll never turn from it
[1:26:34] she is Thoroughly
[1:26:36] convinced and she has come forth when
[1:26:38] she's heard the message and the blood
[1:26:41] has cleansed her amen that's right she's
[1:26:43] virtuous aren't you glad for that Amen
[1:26:46] brother Ram said no sin in her at all
[1:26:49] she's not a defiled woman I'm so glad
[1:26:52] for that if the musicians will come do
[1:26:55] you love the
[1:26:57] Lord God has finally been able to
[1:27:00] achieve the Oneness that Jesus prayed
[1:27:03] for that's right in such a way and and
[1:27:06] as I've said it before that's why you
[1:27:09] and I are going through so much hell on
[1:27:12] Earth so to
[1:27:14] speak trial after trial it seems and it
[1:27:17] seemed like not just one trial but
[1:27:18] trials on every
[1:27:20] hand but you see what it is is God's
[1:27:23] proven you I go listen to
[1:27:28] um I think it's
[1:27:31] um God of this evil age I I think I've
[1:27:35] been listening to it and um the other
[1:27:38] night I I couldn't sleep so I was um
[1:27:42] listening to the sermon yeah the God of
[1:27:45] this evil age amen and brother brandham
[1:27:48] said see he's um he's calling people out
[1:27:53] for his name in this age and he said the
[1:27:55] reason why is to try her try her to try
[1:27:58] her amen now you think of that he's
[1:28:01] calling her out to try her
[1:28:05] what is it a blessing to be called out
[1:28:08] then oh yeah cuz then brother brand says
[1:28:11] the reason why he's trying her is to
[1:28:13] prove to Satan she's not like
[1:28:16] Eve she will not do like Eve
[1:28:20] amen so you're tried on every
[1:28:23] hand but think it not strange concerning
[1:28:27] the trials that are to try you can you
[1:28:30] say Amen it's only working for your
[1:28:32] good if you only knew that God is
[1:28:35] bragging on you he's able to finally
[1:28:38] achieve Oneness amen and that Oneness
[1:28:42] will not break not not break CU she
[1:28:45] staying true to the word you love
[1:28:48] him
[1:28:50] amen what's
