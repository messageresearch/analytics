[5:14] evening
[5:15] amen the musicians can be dismissed
[5:18] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[5:20] just turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd
[5:24] chapter
[5:28] and just read the first verse we're all
[5:31] familiar with it
[5:34] okay
[5:37] and I guess it's used quite often
[5:41] at funerals
[5:43] but I think it is very very applicable
[5:46] to us who are alive
[5:50] amen
[5:54] it says the Lord is my shepherd
[5:57] I shall not one
[6:01] amen
[6:03] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[6:06] father
[6:08] truly we need you this evening
[6:12] more than we ever have before
[6:16] father you have made it Lord through our
[6:21] lives as we grow older
[6:24] we're learning more of you the Lord
[6:27] you're making it to where we become more
[6:30] needy
[6:32] and father how we feel that way this
[6:35] evening
[6:36] and we just asked that you would come
[6:38] Among Us and just take what simple words
[6:41] we have
[6:43] Lord and just minister to your people
[6:46] pray that you would help me just to get
[6:48] myself out of the way
[6:50] Lord and may you anoint the years in the
[6:52] hearts of your people this evening
[6:55] oh God we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[6:58] amen and amen you can have your seats
[7:02] this evening
[7:04] we want to remember brother Josh
[7:07] Bennett's meeting that is starting
[7:09] tomorrow night
[7:10] through Sunday and so
[7:13] if any of you are able to go
[7:17] I know you'll be blessed by the ministry
[7:21] that will be there
[7:23] and I think brother Ron Spencer brother
[7:25] Wayne Lawson and brother Jonathan
[7:28] and then brother I think brother Josh
[7:31] Martin's be ministering the Saturday
[7:35] morning youth service
[7:37] and so I I know you'll be blessed and
[7:42] also we want to keep brother Andrew in
[7:45] our prayers to be traveling tomorrow or
[7:47] Thursday or something to that effect
[7:49] tomorrow Friday to Florida and so um
[7:54] he's um me doing a four night meeting
[7:59] and and so we wanted to just um uh pray
[8:03] for him as well
[8:05] but uh tonight I just have a a simple
[8:07] thought and that's just the Lord is my
[8:09] shepherd
[8:10] it's it's a simple thought but it's a
[8:13] profound
[8:15] to the believer and really it's it's a
[8:18] it's a a statement that would perplex
[8:21] the world
[8:23] uh because they don't know the the Lord
[8:27] as their Shepherd
[8:28] but today God has been many things uh in
[8:33] the world has made him uh many many
[8:36] things he's been made that way a mascot
[8:38] an Aaron boy and
[8:40] a god of convenience the god of
[8:44] Showmanship
[8:46] and these things and he's been made
[8:48] everything that he really isn't to be he
[8:51] that's not what he is and but David
[8:56] recognizes the Lord to to be his
[8:59] Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd and and
[9:03] I looked up the Amplified and and he he
[9:07] puts there the Lord is my shepherd to
[9:10] feed to guide and to Shield
[9:14] and now god holds that responsibility
[9:18] he's the one that puts himself in that
[9:21] responsibility
[9:22] and David has just come to know what the
[9:26] Lord is to him and that is a Shepherd
[9:29] one that would feed the guide to Shield
[9:32] this shows the special relationship that
[9:36] David has with God and that God has with
[9:40] David there's no struggling to be leader
[9:43] there's no there's no animosity between
[9:46] David and God there's there's not no
[9:49] friction there as to David's will trying
[9:53] to overcome God's will it's just a
[9:57] simple acknowledgment a recognition that
[10:00] that David has and that is the Lord is
[10:03] my shepherd
[10:05] and so David in other words knew his
[10:09] place
[10:10] and he was content with it there was no
[10:13] contention there David had come to be
[10:18] satisfied that he was the lamb
[10:21] and that God was the leader God was the
[10:25] shepherd
[10:26] and by studying sheep the prophet says
[10:29] that we can learn
[10:31] we can learn about us we can learn about
[10:34] our nature because now not not talking
[10:37] of worldly nature carnal nature but when
[10:39] you you get the Holy Ghost and you you
[10:42] come into the body of Believers then you
[10:45] take on a nature and the nature that you
[10:49] would take on is the nature of a sheep
[10:51] in in in in uh one way and so we learn
[10:56] about our nature as Christians by
[10:59] studying uh sheep and the prophet said
[11:03] one thing that we learn from a sheep is
[11:07] is that when the weather is really hot
[11:09] sheep won't separate themselves but
[11:13] instead they will all Stand Together
[11:16] and he says they do that to make shade
[11:18] for each other he says they're having
[11:20] Fellowship
[11:22] and he says now it would be good if all
[11:24] God sheep when the heat was on would
[11:27] stand together
[11:28] when the trials are real hard and the
[11:31] heat is on and everything going on
[11:34] everywhere if all God's Little Sheep
[11:37] would just stand together we'd have the
[11:41] coolness of the shade of each other the
[11:43] Comfort to lean upon each other
[11:46] he said now someone would say now is
[11:48] that necessary brother Branham it is
[11:51] certainly it certainly is there's
[11:54] nothing like having a real good
[11:57] Dependable friend that when the troubles
[12:00] are blazing the heat's on you can go to
[12:03] this friend and sit down and just
[12:05] explain it to them
[12:07] and talk it over in personal confidence
[12:10] and then kneel down and prayed together
[12:12] and know that this person is a good
[12:14] god-saved man or woman that you can put
[12:17] confidence in oh it's good to do that
[12:20] come let us reason together set the
[12:23] scripture or come and let us Stand
[12:26] Together
[12:27] and so then he goes on that even in the
[12:31] times of in the north when the blizzards
[12:33] are really uh prevalent and and it's
[12:37] freezing cold and and you can barely see
[12:41] and the winds are blowing that snow all
[12:44] around he says those little sheep he
[12:47] said they may be on one side of the hill
[12:49] but they'll come running
[12:50] and they'll meet up with all the other
[12:52] sheep and they'll huddle together
[12:55] to keep warm
[12:57] they're going to keep each other warm
[12:58] ain't that right because of the heat of
[13:01] their body and he says I think when the
[13:04] church gets real cold and indifferent
[13:06] God's sheep ought to huddle together and
[13:11] pray for each other and the warmth of
[13:14] real good Christian Fellowship all it
[13:17] means so much
[13:19] God spoke of it in or David spoke of it
[13:22] in the first Psalm and said blessed is
[13:25] the man that saareth not in the seat of
[13:27] the scornful or standeth in the way of
[13:30] the Sinners but his Delight is in the
[13:32] law of the Lord and in the law does he
[13:34] meditate day and night and he shall be
[13:36] like a tree that's planted by the river
[13:39] of water and his Leaf shall not wither
[13:41] for whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[13:43] ain't that right now then then he goes
[13:46] on to say now you know if he said if
[13:48] you're going out for a picnic and he
[13:49] describes his country how hot it gets in
[13:52] the summertime and you want to go on a
[13:54] picnic and it's really hot he says you
[13:57] you need shade he said you want some
[13:59] shade you ain't gonna go sit out in the
[14:01] sun you know you want shade but he said
[14:04] you want to know that you're not just
[14:06] sitting under a twig that someone just
[14:09] set out there and it may be Shady right
[14:12] now you know but it ain't got no roots
[14:15] it ain't got nothing he said but you
[14:17] want to know that you come back next
[14:19] year it's going to be planted is that
[14:21] that tree's still going to be there
[14:22] ain't that right and so he says see uh
[14:26] you got to have confidence in that shade
[14:29] that you're you're you're you're you're
[14:30] you're coming under he said but you go
[14:33] to where the big old stately Oak stands
[14:37] where the trials and temptations and The
[14:39] Swinging of the limbs back and forth and
[14:42] back and forth has moved that old tree
[14:44] till them roots are way down deep in the
[14:46] ground and you can pretty well believe
[14:48] she'll still be standing there and he
[14:51] said that's the way I like now tonight
[14:54] now he's talking about getting together
[14:56] and the kind of getting together right
[14:59] he said that's the way I like is to get
[15:01] an old God uh God's safe Saint that's
[15:04] weathered the storm and their roots are
[15:07] still holding deep in the love of God
[15:09] what it means to get a person like that
[15:12] and have a little time of Fellowship it
[15:15] means so much
[15:16] ain't that right so so you can learn
[15:19] from sheep another thing that sheep is
[15:21] is is a sacrificial animal
[15:24] and
[15:26] um
[15:27] uh you know which there's nothing
[15:31] helpless as a sheep ain't that right
[15:33] nothing and David being a Shepherd in
[15:37] the natural uh watching his father sheep
[15:41] he he understood that the nature of
[15:43] sheep he knew understood the
[15:45] relationship that a Shepherd would have
[15:47] with the sheep and and and and and the
[15:50] the importance of sheep having a
[15:52] shepherd and and and sheep have to have
[15:55] a shepherd
[15:56] ain't that right we have to have a
[15:58] shepherd and so they're they're the most
[16:01] the prophet said they're the most
[16:02] helpless creatures in the world when
[16:04] they are lost and when a sheep is lost
[16:07] it'll just stand there and bleed and
[16:09] bleat and bleed stand there until it
[16:12] dies
[16:13] except the other sheep could be 100 300
[16:16] yards away
[16:17] and but that sheep has lost its
[16:20] direction
[16:21] and in instead of getting its senses
[16:23] it's it's helpless it can't yet its
[16:26] senses and so it needs the shepherd to
[16:29] lead it back to the fold hey ain't that
[16:32] right and so if if the shepherd doesn't
[16:35] get to it in time then a predator will
[16:39] come
[16:40] and a wolf or a coyote or whatever and
[16:43] take advantage of the helplessness of
[16:46] this sheep and so it must have a
[16:49] Shepherd to lead it ain't that right
[16:51] and so we know from David that a
[16:54] Shepherd is a protector of the Sheep
[16:57] amen David experienced it one time as he
[17:01] tells the story to King Saul of of how
[17:04] that the bear come and try to get a lamb
[17:07] and he took the lamb from the the flock
[17:10] and and then a lion came in and took a
[17:13] lamb from the flock and but he says I
[17:16] went after that I went after them and
[17:19] and God gave Grace and I was able to
[17:22] rescue them from the mouth of the lion
[17:24] and the mouth of the bear
[17:27] what a Shepherd we need ain't that right
[17:30] a Shepherd that is willing and able
[17:34] because David going after the something
[17:37] that was mighty uh like a lion or a bear
[17:40] he was actually willing to lay his life
[17:44] down for that sheep which was a type of
[17:48] Christ ain't that right and so brother
[17:51] Branham would tell us that he says that
[17:53] the Sheep is the most helpless thing
[17:55] there is there's nothing so insufficient
[17:58] of Defense than the Sheep
[18:01] think of that now that's what God Likens
[18:03] us
[18:04] and we have no defense
[18:06] we're just sheep ain't that right
[18:09] amen there's no insufficient of the uh
[18:12] there there's nothing so insufficient of
[18:15] Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run
[18:17] a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can
[18:21] bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a
[18:24] bird can fly but the Sheep stands
[18:26] helpless
[18:27] and if you notice God never Likens us as
[18:31] to a horse that can run never Likens us
[18:34] as to a lion that can roar and tear
[18:36] apart but he Likens us as sheep and you
[18:40] say man and and the prophet begins to
[18:43] pull out these characters of the sheep
[18:46] that are that we are liking to ain't
[18:49] that right amen that's right amen now I
[18:52] know that God Likens us unto Eagles but
[18:55] but but uh uh but an eagle is a predator
[18:59] but we find that uh uh God Likens us as
[19:04] to an eagle in different characters but
[19:07] we're speaking of a sheep and you say
[19:09] man a sheep uh that ain't uh going
[19:13] around killing that ain't out to devire
[19:16] that ain't we're just it's just a
[19:18] helpless creature that is in need of a
[19:20] Shepherd ain't that right so we are the
[19:23] people the the Bible says David says we
[19:26] are the people of his pasture and the
[19:28] Sheep of his hand uh Psalms 103 it is he
[19:33] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[19:36] we are his people and the Sheep of his
[19:39] past sure ain't that rhyme see so we we
[19:43] find that God Likens the prophet said he
[19:47] Likens his believing children unto sheep
[19:50] because they must be guided
[19:53] sheep must be guided and not just
[19:57] natural sheep but God's children must be
[20:01] guided can you say amen that's right see
[20:05] and so if if it's a necessity to be
[20:09] guided by somebody then you know that of
[20:12] course the devil is going to take take
[20:14] uh to try to take advantage of that uh
[20:18] uh of of that guiding ain't that right
[20:21] and and so the prophet would give out
[20:24] that warning be careful as to who guides
[20:28] you then you're going to be guided by
[20:30] something but be careful as to who or
[20:34] what guides you because see if if you're
[20:38] being led by a goat
[20:41] the prophet says every time that they
[20:44] want to take the Sheep to the slaughter
[20:46] they get a goat
[20:48] and that goat will take the Sheep to the
[20:51] slaughterhouse they'll get them up on
[20:53] that ramp and as soon as it gets right
[20:56] up into the gate that that that goat
[20:59] will jump off and and the Sheep just
[21:01] goes right on into the slaughter can you
[21:04] say man amen so the prophet says the
[21:07] goat will lead but you cannot lead him
[21:10] ain't that right so that's the nature of
[21:13] of a goat but the Sheep cannot lead the
[21:18] Sheep has to be led
[21:20] I I think sometimes we you know the
[21:23] world thinks Christians are dumb but in
[21:26] all reality we are in in in ways be
[21:30] because we we realize that we're not
[21:33] made to defend ourselves we're not made
[21:35] to just go out there and and and and and
[21:38] uh you know just whatever you want to
[21:42] call it you can't make life or make your
[21:45] way through life without a shepherd
[21:49] without a leader can you say man that
[21:52] that's just the way that God has made us
[21:54] to be now so it's the shepherd now the
[21:58] prophet said the shepherd must be very
[22:00] smart in order to tell the difference
[22:02] between the bleeding of a goat and the
[22:05] bleeding of a sheep because they sound
[22:07] alike ain't that right and so we find
[22:11] that Jesus said it'd be so close in this
[22:14] last day that it would actually deceive
[22:17] the elect if it was possible so then
[22:20] then we're seeing that Satan Works in a
[22:23] in a in a shrewd way very shrewd in
[22:27] trying to bring us into under his
[22:30] headship ain't that right under his
[22:32] headship and but but then you hear the
[22:36] Lord is my shepherd
[22:38] I think it's important for sheep to know
[22:41] who is their Shepherd
[22:44] not to be confused
[22:46] because as the as as we know throughout
[22:50] the Bible that that uh the shepherd the
[22:55] Sheep know their Shepherd can you say
[22:58] amen that's right when they're when
[23:00] they're when they're under a Shepherd
[23:02] amen the prophet says that the shepherd
[23:04] it stinks like the Sheep smells like the
[23:07] Sheep he's with the Sheep he he's with
[23:10] them all the time and and the moment you
[23:13] think that God is forsaken you you're
[23:15] wrong
[23:17] he's the shepherd
[23:18] [Music]
[23:20] ain't that right now the Lord is The
[23:24] Shepherd of every Son of God every
[23:26] daughter of God the Lord is the shepherd
[23:30] and and and the more we can realize that
[23:33] recognize that I think we'd be better
[23:36] off
[23:37] ain't that right now Romans 8 14 it says
[23:40] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[23:43] God they are the sons of God so you're
[23:47] going to be led the world is going to be
[23:50] led the the the the the uh man is being
[23:54] led there the world the churches they're
[23:56] being led to the World Council of
[23:58] churches ain't that right but the
[24:00] difference that makes the Son of God
[24:02] Stand Out is they are led by the spirit
[24:06] of God so the Lord is their Shepherd can
[24:12] you say man he's the king's Shepherd now
[24:15] notice what David being a lamb writes
[24:18] about the shepherd there in in
[24:21] um uh uh II Samuel 22 and 5 it says when
[24:25] the waves of death come past me the
[24:28] floods of ungodly men made me afraid the
[24:31] Sorrows of hell can passed about me uh
[24:35] uh the snares of death prevent at me in
[24:38] my distress I called upon the Lord and
[24:42] cried to my God
[24:44] and he did hear my voice out of his
[24:46] Temple and My Cry did enter into his
[24:49] ears then the Earth Shook and trembled
[24:52] the foundations of Heaven moved and
[24:55] shook because he the shepherd was Wrath
[24:59] ain't that right there went up a smoke
[25:02] out of his nostrils and fire out of his
[25:04] mouth devired and coals were kindled by
[25:07] it he bowed the heavens also and came
[25:11] down and darkness was under his feet and
[25:15] he rolled upon a cherub and did fly and
[25:18] he was seen upon the Wind Wings of the
[25:20] wind and he made his Darkness Pavilions
[25:24] round about him dark Waters and sick
[25:27] clouds of the sky and through the
[25:30] brightness before him were coals of fire
[25:33] kindled the Lord thundered From Heaven
[25:36] and the most high uttered his voice and
[25:39] he sent out arrows and Scattered them
[25:41] lightning and discomforted them and the
[25:44] channels of the sea appeared and the
[25:46] foundations of the world were discovered
[25:49] at the rebuking of the Lord at the blast
[25:52] of the breath of his nostrils he sent
[25:55] from above he took me and he drew me out
[25:58] of many water years he delivered me from
[26:01] my strong enemy and from them that hated
[26:04] me for they were too strong for me they
[26:08] prevented me in the day of my Calamity
[26:10] but the Lord was my stay he brought me
[26:15] forth also into a large place he
[26:17] delivered me because he delighted in me
[26:22] can you say man thank the god to have a
[26:25] Shepherd that Delights in you now I know
[26:29] this is simple but I know that we've all
[26:31] come to a place at some point or another
[26:33] to where that that that we've we've come
[26:36] to to places that we don't know what to
[26:38] do and and it looks like the enemy was
[26:41] going to overtake us but then we realize
[26:44] the Lord is Our Shepherd can you say
[26:48] Amen have you ever realized that in the
[26:50] most of times that you you just don't
[26:52] know it just looks like you ain't going
[26:54] to be able to go any further and then it
[26:56] just comes to recognition that God you
[26:58] are my son Shepherd and I am needing
[27:01] help I'm a lamb that is bleeding and you
[27:03] watch God come on the scene in your
[27:06] behalf yes sir see so our Lord uh the
[27:11] Shepherd that doesn't just sit back and
[27:13] let the enemy devour his sheep the enemy
[27:17] will not and cannot Devour the soul of
[27:20] God's sheep can you say amen amen amen
[27:24] he may be able to take them in death
[27:26] amen to where their body is just a
[27:28] spoonful of of dust or Spoonful Of Ashes
[27:32] but that Soul amen liveth and abideth
[27:35] forever can you say amen that's right
[27:38] that soul of God's sheep lives for
[27:41] eternally amen that's right and another
[27:44] thing that the devil cannot devour and
[27:46] that is the praise of God's Sheep amen
[27:50] and the worship that comes from the
[27:52] Sheep of God Amen he can never devour
[27:55] their love for their Shepherd he he will
[27:59] never be able to devour amen their faith
[28:03] in him can you say amen amen there's
[28:06] things about a believer that the devil
[28:09] cannot devour that the enemy can never
[28:13] destroy there's something about us a man
[28:17] that were in the shepherd's Hands Where
[28:19] where the apple of his eye we we are the
[28:23] people that he will move Heaven and
[28:25] Earth for we are the people that if
[28:27] there was no other people on the face of
[28:30] the Earth he still would have come and
[28:32] he would have went to Calvary just for
[28:34] one amen that's how much he loves his
[28:36] sheep can you say amen amen he's a
[28:40] Shepherd that will not forget us he's a
[28:41] Shepherd that will not just turn his
[28:43] back upon us he's a Shepherd that
[28:46] forever has us at his heart
[28:49] [Applause]
[28:50] you believe that the Lord is Our
[28:53] Shepherd
[28:54] now David named some of the benefits
[28:58] that come with the Lord being a shepherd
[29:02] and notice it's all in that verse I
[29:05] didn't read it but he says we shall not
[29:07] I'm going to put it in plural we shall
[29:10] not want
[29:12] or lack
[29:14] we are made to lie down
[29:17] not not not in desert places
[29:20] but in Green Pastures
[29:23] we are laid beside not the rumbling
[29:27] Waters you get around rumbling Waters of
[29:30] turrets or current and turmoils and and
[29:34] and where there's a strong current
[29:36] you're just scared to get around that
[29:37] water
[29:38] you're afraid to fall in but he leads us
[29:41] besides Steel Waters
[29:44] and our soul is restored do you believe
[29:49] that our soul is restored we are LED in
[29:54] the paths of righteousness for his
[29:56] namesake and notice his presence takes
[30:00] away all fear foreign
[30:04] as we walk through the valley of the
[30:07] shadow of death we fear no evil for we
[30:10] realize that he is with us
[30:13] Hallelujah this is what we're walking in
[30:15] today is the valley of shadow of death
[30:18] ain't that right we are comforted by his
[30:21] rod and staff a table he is prepared for
[30:25] us in the presence of our enemies our
[30:28] head has been anointed and I I'd like to
[30:30] just take some some time in in and just
[30:34] go through all of this later Amen in in
[30:36] the services but a table is prepared for
[30:39] us in the presence of our enemy our head
[30:43] has been anointed our cup run is over
[30:47] now this is the benefits When the Lord
[30:50] is your Shepherd it just makes you want
[30:53] to be a sheep
[30:55] can you say Amen it just makes you want
[30:58] to turn it all over the Lord and let him
[30:59] fight your battles it just makes you
[31:02] just want to call out to him amen and in
[31:05] in the Despair and when it looks like
[31:07] it's all Bleak yet you still have a
[31:10] trust that is anchored because you
[31:12] realize he's your Shepherd and there
[31:14] ain't nothing going to touch the hair of
[31:16] your head
[31:18] it's just not goodness and mercy never
[31:21] leaves us we will dwell in the house of
[31:24] the Lord forever now if these if these
[31:27] benefits do not apply to you then you're
[31:30] not his sheep and he's not your Shepherd
[31:32] can you say Amen so then we have to
[31:35] settle it how many believes that the
[31:37] Lord is your Shepherd you really believe
[31:39] that the Lord is your Shepherd then then
[31:41] we understand these are benefits that we
[31:44] cannot say the Lord is Our Shepherd and
[31:47] then scratch out these benefits as
[31:49] though they belong to some other race of
[31:51] people or some other class or some other
[31:53] church or some other individual if the
[31:55] Lord is my shepherd it's a it's a
[31:58] personal Shepherd it's a personal
[32:00] relationship a personal faith a personal
[32:03] confidence and these benefits are
[32:06] attributed to me
[32:09] he's my shepherd
[32:12] and
[32:14] sheep follow their Shepherd
[32:18] this shows the relationship that and
[32:21] trust that sheep have in their Shepherd
[32:26] I've had you know different ones that I
[32:29] guess have sheep and they try to tell me
[32:31] well you know sheep is just bullheaded
[32:33] and they just this and they just that
[32:34] that's just the way we are brother Sean
[32:36] and I thought well when I read about
[32:38] sheep when the prophet talks about he
[32:40] never talks about any of that
[32:42] he puts that to goats
[32:47] but sheep have confidence in their
[32:49] Shepherd
[32:52] it's a relationship that has been built
[32:56] you know you hear the story of
[32:59] you know that you you see the shepherd
[33:01] the picture that Shepherd holding his
[33:03] lamp
[33:04] across his shoulders
[33:07] he got that rod
[33:10] and it's been said that when the Sheep
[33:12] a Little Lamb
[33:14] you know he just filling his oats and he
[33:16] just you know so he wants to stray
[33:19] he wants to have a good time
[33:21] he doesn't know the shepherd yet
[33:25] and the shepherd knows that there's
[33:27] enemies out there
[33:30] he knows the nature of that lamb
[33:33] he knows the lamb before the lamb knows
[33:35] itself
[33:37] and so he he pulls in that sheep that
[33:40] little lamb and the lamb just keeps
[33:42] going and finally the old Shepherd out
[33:45] of love he'll take that take that thing
[33:47] take his staff and he'll he'll he'll
[33:50] break that leg
[33:52] buddy you talking about looks like the
[33:55] the shepherd forsaken the the lamb
[33:59] but then it says that the the shepherd
[34:01] will take that lamb and it's bleeding
[34:03] and he just oh just fell off forsaken
[34:06] but the shepherd will take that lamb and
[34:08] he'll rest it upon the strong part of
[34:10] his body the shoulders
[34:12] and he carries that lamb everywhere he
[34:15] goes
[34:16] he sings to that lamb he talks to the
[34:19] lamb
[34:20] and what is happening is there's a
[34:23] bonding taking place between the
[34:26] shepherd and the lamb
[34:29] and the lamb is learning the voice of
[34:31] the shepherd
[34:33] ain't that right he's learning the voice
[34:36] of the shepherd
[34:37] and then when the leg heals and he's
[34:40] able to put that lamb down never again
[34:43] does that lamb wander
[34:45] the Lamb's right there by that Shepherd
[34:47] everywhere he goes and when the shepherd
[34:50] speaks he knows the voice
[34:52] can you say man now if that's in the
[34:55] natural so is it in the spiritual ain't
[34:58] that right we're we're a people that
[35:01] began to know our Shepherd right now I I
[35:07] thought of how they follow the shepherd
[35:08] and the relationship brother Branham
[35:11] talks about being in the in the Eastern
[35:13] country
[35:14] where you know at their food market they
[35:17] have all their food outside it's not
[35:19] like our grocery stores and people just
[35:22] travel you know walk all through there
[35:24] and I'm sure you've seen scenes and
[35:27] pictures or whatever of it but they have
[35:29] food just lined up out in the streets
[35:31] you know and and he says he was there
[35:34] and a Shepherd come bring in a sheep
[35:37] right starting to ride through all that
[35:40] and any thought my goodness this is
[35:42] going to be catastrophe them sheep going
[35:45] to smell that food and that's it you
[35:46] know the shepherd loses its control over
[35:49] the Sheep
[35:50] but he says as he watched all the cars
[35:53] stopped for the Sheep to go across
[35:56] and the shepherd went right through all
[35:58] of it and the Sheep would look at it but
[36:00] it stayed right with the shepherd He
[36:02] said not one of them touched that food
[36:04] they were following their Shepherd and
[36:08] he said oh if the people could
[36:10] understand my language I would have
[36:12] stopped the cars and preached a sermon
[36:14] of what I just saw that the Sheep stay
[36:17] with the shepherd can you say amen
[36:19] that's right they know the shepherd will
[36:21] feed them they know the shepherd will
[36:23] take care of them they're now out trying
[36:25] to defend themselves for themselves can
[36:28] you say amen that's right see so so then
[36:31] then the Sheep are Guided by The
[36:33] Shepherd's voice
[36:35] John 10 27 my sheep hear my voice my
[36:40] sheep hear my voice if a natural sheep
[36:43] can can fall in love with their
[36:45] Shepherd's voice and know their
[36:48] Shepherd's voice and and not get
[36:50] distracted by any other voice then
[36:54] cannot God sheep do the same
[36:56] if God would make a natural sheep to
[36:59] type out you and I and we see that they
[37:02] don't fail in that they know the
[37:04] shepherd's voice they're loyal to that
[37:06] Shepherd's voice then so is God's sheep
[37:09] loyal to his voice as well he said my
[37:13] sheep hear my voice I know them and they
[37:17] follow me now we know and again this is
[37:20] simple I know that the voice of God is
[37:23] the word of God
[37:25] the voice of God everybody say the voice
[37:27] of God is the word of God ain't that
[37:31] right so the word of God is our defense
[37:33] the word of God is our shelter our
[37:36] refuge it's it's a preserver of life
[37:39] ain't that right now Jeremiah 7 23 uh
[37:45] God uh speaks to Israel and saying obey
[37:48] my voice
[37:49] obey my voice and I will be your God and
[37:53] you shall be my people ain't that right
[37:56] now that's the difference the thing is
[37:57] is Don't Be The Voice got it we ain't in
[38:00] Rodeo time we we've been rodeos when I
[38:03] was younger you know when they have them
[38:05] in Oklahoma and and you know uh uh my my
[38:09] nephew got he's he's a tough old boy you
[38:11] know y'all seen him I'm sure but uh uh
[38:14] you know he's just strong and he got in
[38:16] that competition you know I think it's a
[38:18] hundred dollars last guy that could
[38:20] stand in there without getting knocked
[38:21] out you know her chicken and he he he uh
[38:25] he's determined you know he's gonna last
[38:27] and that bull come running at him he
[38:29] stayed right there and that bull just
[38:31] plowed him man now I think it knocked
[38:33] him out but that's that that's not God
[38:36] in the Sheep
[38:38] if you want to be a bull
[38:41] then be the bull but you'll never be
[38:43] part of Gods
[38:46] you understand so obey my voice and I'll
[38:49] be your God and you shall be my people
[38:51] and won't ye in all the ways that I have
[38:55] commanded you that it may be well with
[38:58] you
[38:58] God has a way to to to to protect his
[39:02] sheep
[39:04] ain't that right obey my voice ain't
[39:06] that right so the great Shepherd makes
[39:09] himself known by his voice
[39:13] and brother Brown said we know it's the
[39:15] voice of God because it's the
[39:17] manifestation of the prophet's word
[39:20] it's one thing for a prophet to speak
[39:23] but it's another thing for that where to
[39:26] be backed up and then you know it's the
[39:28] voice of God
[39:30] ain't that right brother Brown said this
[39:32] is God's prophet and a true voice of God
[39:35] only brings back that real living
[39:38] Supernatural god with this Supernatural
[39:42] word with the supernatural manifestation
[39:44] of the true word then we know that it's
[39:48] the voice of God can you say Amen we now
[39:51] know what is the difference between just
[39:53] a theologian and God's voice we now know
[39:56] what is the difference between somebody
[39:58] that is just trying to to make something
[40:00] out of the scriptures and then God's
[40:03] voice can you say Amen not everybody
[40:05] that that preached from the Bible is
[40:08] God's voice not everybody that quotes
[40:10] scriptures is God's voice but we're
[40:13] understanding now that the voice of God
[40:15] is the manifestation of this word of God
[40:19] ain't that right and so now we find out
[40:22] amen that the prophet said there's so
[40:25] many voices in the Earth today now
[40:28] you'll you understand why there's going
[40:30] to be very few that make it in the
[40:31] rapture
[40:32] amen because the Rapture is connected
[40:35] with the voice of God
[40:37] and it is true because looking right
[40:39] look look in Revelations the fourth
[40:41] chapter after these things I Heard a
[40:43] Voice
[40:44] saying to me John come up hither brother
[40:47] said that was the Rapture the voice of
[40:50] God is connected with the rapture
[40:53] ain't that right but notice there's so
[40:56] many voices in the Earth today that it
[40:58] is absolutely a hard thing because it
[41:03] deadens the voice of the supernatural so
[41:06] what is the voice of God it's the voice
[41:09] of the supernatural
[41:11] Supernatural can you say Amen see so we
[41:15] we find now that that we have lived in a
[41:18] time uh through through years of
[41:21] thousands years to where the voice of
[41:24] God Our Shepherd the voice of Our
[41:28] Shepherd has been foreign to the world
[41:33] right ain't that right the voice of God
[41:36] has been foreign to the church world
[41:39] it reminds me of the time
[41:41] in the days of of the Old Testament Eli
[41:45] and Samuel
[41:47] and the Bible says that the voice of God
[41:50] was a rare thing for Samuel 3 1 says the
[41:53] word of the Lord was precious in those
[41:55] days why was it precious because it was
[41:58] rare
[41:59] it wasn't just a common thing it was
[42:02] rare in the days of Eli and there was no
[42:06] open Vision ain't that right so what was
[42:10] it the prophet describes that time as a
[42:12] time of confusion
[42:14] because there was no voice of God there
[42:16] is no open Vision it was just it was a
[42:19] time of confusion a time of of
[42:21] catastrophe the people couldn't clearly
[42:24] see because there was no open Vision
[42:27] ain't that right Prophet said the voice
[42:29] of God was just foreign to them and it
[42:32] got in such a place till the church
[42:33] began to let uh get so loose that the
[42:37] word is foreign to the people ain't that
[42:40] right they didn't know the word of God
[42:42] they didn't understand the word of God
[42:44] there was nobody to give them the
[42:46] correct word of God so they didn't have
[42:49] a voice of God and wow what a what a
[42:52] what a sad day that would be to live in
[42:55] that time amen and you didn't know what
[42:58] to do with your children you didn't know
[43:00] what to do with your family you didn't
[43:01] you didn't know how to cope with the
[43:03] church you just didn't have a voice of
[43:06] clear Direction
[43:08] wow that'd been bad wouldn't it amen
[43:10] well it's you know you know the prophet
[43:13] says that Eli of course we know he was a
[43:15] priest he wasn't a prophet but he was
[43:17] backslidden his his eyes began to get
[43:20] dim uh because of his old age ain't that
[43:23] right he couldn't see to get around and
[43:26] he had let the word of the Lord go
[43:28] undone he had left the work of the Lord
[43:30] go undone everybody was occupied with
[43:33] everything else but the house of God and
[43:36] and the things of God and and Corruption
[43:39] was in the church and the people had no
[43:42] clear direction from the Lord and and
[43:44] the prophet said the need of the hour
[43:47] was they needed an open Vision they they
[43:51] needed the word of the Lord to speak
[43:53] directly to the people Amen to gather
[43:57] them out of all of that confusion so
[44:00] that the Sheep could shine and follow
[44:04] Laura
[44:05] remember without a Shepherd the Sheep
[44:07] scatter
[44:09] ain't that right
[44:12] amen so God had to raise up a prophet
[44:17] among them
[44:19] and that was Samuel
[44:21] because the word of the Lord comes to
[44:23] the Prophet The Prophet is the one that
[44:25] has the vision
[44:26] the open Vision ain't that right
[44:29] so he wanted God wanted to get the
[44:31] people out of the confusion
[44:33] Eli's days the prophet coming upon the
[44:36] Earth showed that Eli's day Eli's days
[44:39] were numbered
[44:41] amen and and Eli the priest the prophet
[44:44] said represented the church
[44:45] the church denominations were numbered
[44:48] ain't that right God was going to raise
[44:50] up a prophet amen that had a clear-cut
[44:53] thus said the Lord amen to give a vision
[44:56] to give direction to to to to to an open
[45:00] Vision to the people ain't that right
[45:02] then then parents could start teaching
[45:05] their children and the church could
[45:07] start teaching their their people and
[45:09] and and and and and people would have
[45:11] thus said the Lord amen down into the
[45:14] bosom
[45:15] yes sir see so he says the prophet is
[45:19] the word and the priest is the church
[45:21] and God the voice of God was making
[45:24] itself known through the prophet ain't
[45:28] that right not the priest the prophet
[45:30] amen and he says God has promised to
[45:33] meet the need of this hour he always
[45:35] does that and we need the voice of God
[45:38] today to meet the need of the hour to
[45:41] meet the time that we're living in and
[45:44] after he has promised it we can rest
[45:46] assure that he will keep his promise and
[45:49] that's the confidence the believer has
[45:51] in his maker that he promised to meet
[45:53] the need can you say Amen but I want to
[45:56] say we've gone beyond just looking and
[45:58] needing a man God to meet the need of
[46:00] the hour today he's already met the need
[46:03] of the hour do you believe that the Lord
[46:06] has sent a prophet through the Malachi
[46:08] prophet of Malachi 4 he has met the need
[46:11] of the hour just as he did with the
[46:14] prophet Samuel God would raise up a
[46:16] prophet in this day and the churches
[46:19] would be numbered the denominational
[46:21] Church would be numbered it it would be
[46:23] the end of them it would be the end of
[46:25] their foul teaching it would be the End
[46:28] Amen other man-made traditions and and
[46:31] the voice of confusion there will
[46:33] literally be a voice of God on the Earth
[46:37] today
[46:39] thank you Lord
[46:41] amen
[46:43] and we know it to be the voice of God
[46:45] because it brought back the supernatural
[46:47] Living God Among Us
[46:49] you believe that Supernatural god with
[46:52] the supernatural word with the
[46:54] supernatural manifestation of the true
[46:57] word amen see now only God sheep now
[47:01] listen now only God sheep going to hear
[47:02] the voice
[47:05] now now now you know the prophet goes on
[47:08] talking about you know being overseas
[47:11] and and and and he's talking to some
[47:14] some gentleman that uh I don't know if
[47:17] he was a Shepherd himself or what but
[47:20] brother Brown saw that there was donkeys
[47:22] out in the field with the sheep and
[47:24] there was other things out in the field
[47:26] with the sheep and and and they got to
[47:28] talking about that Shepherd and the the
[47:30] man says well you know he's kind of like
[47:32] he he's kind of like y'all's cowboy in
[47:35] the United States and so brother Brown
[47:37] said oh so a Shepherd is a herder you
[47:40] know and he said well yeah he's kind of
[47:42] like a herder he says oh he's well I
[47:43] just thought it was for sheep and and
[47:46] the man said no it's not just for sheep
[47:48] he'll he'll he'll be a Shepherd to the
[47:50] donkey and he'll be a Shepherd to this
[47:52] he'll be he said but notice the
[47:54] difference he said it's at night time
[47:57] that the shepherd will call
[48:00] his voice will begin to call and only
[48:03] the Sheep will answer his voice
[48:06] and only the Sheep is gathered into the
[48:09] full
[48:10] everything else is left out in the
[48:12] fields but at night time does the Sheep
[48:15] is gathered in for protection
[48:19] oh my
[48:20] God can you say Amen now I know
[48:23] everybody's claiming Christianity
[48:25] and I know I know everybody's feeding
[48:27] off the blessings of God but there is a
[48:29] voice that is sounded in this evening
[48:31] time
[48:33] bringing the Sheep into the foe why the
[48:37] wraths of God is coming
[48:40] it's true and Only God sheep's going to
[48:42] hear the voice
[48:44] everybody else may be speaking in
[48:46] tongues but only God sheep going to hear
[48:47] the voice everybody else may be running
[48:49] around dancing shouting and you know
[48:52] professing Christianity and going to the
[48:54] sports uh Arenas and the bars and and
[48:57] all of that and don't really care about
[48:58] the things of God and yet just putting
[49:00] on a a display of godliness and all of
[49:04] these things and and just having a form
[49:06] but there's a bride a sheep that's going
[49:08] to hear the voice of God
[49:10] [Applause]
[49:12] can you say Amen see and when they hear
[49:15] the voice every denominational power is
[49:18] broken over them
[49:20] do you believe that
[49:22] see why the open Vision has now come to
[49:24] them
[49:27] there's plenty you know those that claim
[49:29] to be in the message but they have never
[49:30] heard the voice behind The Voice
[49:33] and they still hold the old
[49:34] denominational ways they still holding
[49:37] the old Pentecostal Traditions they
[49:39] they're still stuck in in man-made
[49:42] Traditions can you say Amen yes sir see
[49:45] amen they still accept the denominations
[49:48] as though they have some kind of truth
[49:50] that they can teach us as the Sheep of
[49:52] God Amen they still tried to divide the
[49:55] Bible from the message and and see they
[49:58] don't understand that that it's not the
[50:01] separation between Bible and messaging
[50:03] and the New Testament Prophet versus the
[50:05] Old Testament Prophet all that it's the
[50:07] voice of God that is sounding the same
[50:10] voice that was sounding in Isaiah's day
[50:13] is the same voice that was speaking
[50:16] through the prophet of this day it's the
[50:19] voice of God
[50:21] all right it's the voice can you say man
[50:23] and if the Lord is your Shepherd then
[50:26] you know his voice
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:29] you know his voice can you say man
[50:32] now brother Branham explains the reason
[50:34] as to why the church is in the condition
[50:36] that it's in
[50:37] he said and and when we're saying the
[50:40] church remember not bride
[50:43] brother Branham plainly put the
[50:45] difference between bride and church
[50:49] ain't that right
[50:51] so the church natural
[50:54] has heard the prophet just like you and
[50:56] I have
[50:58] Prophet went around the world seven
[51:00] times
[51:01] proclaiming this message
[51:04] the supernatural power of God behind it
[51:06] right
[51:07] it wasn't hitting the corner but the
[51:10] reason why it never changed the church
[51:12] and the church is in its condition is
[51:14] because there are so many voices so many
[51:18] other voices to attract the church from
[51:20] the voice of God
[51:21] till it's very doubtful that many would
[51:25] hear the voice of God though it spoke
[51:27] right through their midst right in their
[51:28] midst see they perhaps wouldn't even
[51:31] understand it because it would be a
[51:33] foreign thing to them they have got
[51:35] themselves so much centered on the
[51:39] voices of the day
[51:42] now this is amazing how that they have
[51:46] they have
[51:48] centered themselves on the voices of the
[51:51] day
[51:52] to where they couldn't hardly even hear
[51:55] the voice of God
[51:56] and recognize it they couldn't recognize
[51:59] it right and so we we find
[52:02] that that brother Bradham would tell us
[52:05] if other voices are contrary to the
[52:07] voice of God
[52:09] then it must be the voice of our enemy
[52:12] to confuse us
[52:15] now now think of it because we know
[52:18] beyond a shot of a doubt how many knows
[52:20] Beyond Shabbos out that God his voice
[52:22] has been sounding
[52:24] we know beyond a shout of a doubt
[52:28] then what would bring confusion then is
[52:31] the voice of our enemy
[52:34] that would bring confusion to where we
[52:37] would not understand the voice of God
[52:40] when it spoke
[52:42] he said there's so many voices in the
[52:44] Earth today that it is absolutely a hard
[52:46] thing because it deadens the voice of
[52:49] the supernatural there's so many
[52:51] intellectual voices great voices of
[52:55] mighty men who are intellectual that in
[52:57] their intellectual conditions even shake
[52:59] the Nations
[53:01] ain't that right they're not just
[53:03] overnight people but they Shake Nations
[53:06] bringing great organizations together
[53:08] great campaigns flowery see and a person
[53:13] would be a bit confused it's enough to
[53:15] confuse them of how that these things go
[53:18] on and prosper see there's voices that
[53:21] raise up and it may be even confusing to
[53:23] you young people how that demand can be
[53:26] great in in successful in their great
[53:29] meetings and thousands of people and yet
[53:32] the voice of God or the message of
[53:34] brother Branham would be so condensed
[53:37] down that hardly nobody knows it that
[53:39] that he came in this day do you realize
[53:41] history is being lost of what brother
[53:44] Branham what happened in brother
[53:45] branham's meetings
[53:47] right yeah that's right a lot of things
[53:50] are being lost
[53:52] because you got your your our elders
[53:54] that were there have have left the scene
[53:56] or leaving the scene
[53:58] ain't that right
[54:00] give it a few more years and and and and
[54:02] and and if if God would tarry there'd be
[54:05] very very very few people in this earth
[54:08] know that God sent a prophet
[54:12] and that's why it's important to have
[54:15] Ministry
[54:18] that'll stay with that message and
[54:21] proclaim the message before you
[54:23] to keep that Vision alive
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:28] and you say Amen
[54:31] now he said see a person get confused
[54:33] it's enough to confuse them of how that
[54:35] these things go on and prosper there's
[54:37] voices that raise up and do these things
[54:39] and it causes the voice of God to be
[54:41] placed way back somewheres
[54:44] the true voice of God now I'm not going
[54:47] to go into everything I'm I'm I'll let
[54:50] you go here in a minute
[54:52] but some of the voices today brother
[54:53] Bradham mentions them
[54:55] thousands of voices but one of them is a
[54:58] church voice
[55:00] and you know you can take this in so
[55:04] many directions
[55:05] as far as a church voice because
[55:09] you know that's what brother Branham
[55:10] come to do is he come to expose the
[55:14] devil in the church
[55:16] whereas everybody else all the other
[55:19] preachers you know they expose the devil
[55:21] in the in the center
[55:22] in the bar in the in the in the movie
[55:26] house and and this and that but here
[55:28] come a prophet exposing this the the the
[55:31] religious side of the devil out ain't
[55:35] that right and and there are there are
[55:37] great powerful Ministries out there
[55:40] that that truly have a gift to preach
[55:45] sometimes I when you hear them I'm like
[55:47] wow
[55:49] if if they just gonna know the message
[55:54] it would just be mind-boggling and then
[55:56] sometimes I wonder you know you just
[55:58] kind of you drift as a as a man and
[56:02] you're thinking well why would God not
[56:03] use them people to come into the message
[56:06] and and bring the people together
[56:08] because that's not God's plan
[56:13] amen
[56:14] God used the seventh grade conduction
[56:19] to bring the message
[56:21] and he's not going to use some great
[56:23] gift
[56:25] to where everybody oohs and all's over
[56:27] that gift
[56:28] that's that's going to pass we we're
[56:30] past all that
[56:31] The Lord Is Our Shepherd
[56:34] ain't that right The Lord Is Our
[56:36] Shepherd so then then we find they're
[56:39] able to deliver their sermons and wow
[56:41] they're able to to bring masses of
[56:44] people in and just hold them Spellbound
[56:46] and and sometimes I just marvel at the
[56:49] way they can just present a message
[56:53] but yet the voice is contrary
[56:56] to the voice of God
[56:59] but that voice is so powerful and strong
[57:02] the church voice is so strong that it'll
[57:05] put the voice of God way back
[57:09] can you say Amen now Prophet said it's
[57:11] the voice of a false prophet
[57:14] he said now see the prophet of course is
[57:17] a preacher the modern word Prophet
[57:19] absolutely means a man that preaches
[57:21] under inspiration and there's men who
[57:23] stands and calls themselves a prophet
[57:25] and then denies the word of God denies
[57:27] the truth of God and at mine it just
[57:30] blows the people's minds how the fact
[57:33] can prosper and we say the real voice of
[57:36] God was in the then the message of
[57:38] William or Adam and it ain't prospering
[57:40] much to them
[57:42] so they just think you're following
[57:44] something some old dead thing if it was
[57:46] really the voice of God
[57:49] then it would Shake everybody remember
[57:51] brother Brown talks about brother Boze
[57:55] don't brother Brown said I just I've
[57:57] been praying for shaking
[57:58] he said I just I just knew the shaking
[58:01] was coming brother Brown said you're
[58:03] seeing the greatest shaking it'll ever
[58:04] have
[58:06] that's right why the voice of God was
[58:09] sounding
[58:11] and he wasn't out to shake everything he
[58:14] was out to shake that little bride
[58:17] bring her into the full
[58:20] can you say man
[58:22] so people have turned down their
[58:24] visitation today because their Church
[58:27] taught different
[58:29] than what the voice of God was
[58:30] proclaiming
[58:32] then there's the voice of politics
[58:34] promise of prosperity
[58:37] brother Brown said the voice of politics
[58:38] is actually stronger than the voice of
[58:40] God in the churches
[58:43] it's amazing
[58:45] how politics have become such a big
[58:48] thing in message churches
[58:52] wow
[58:53] George they will literally fight over
[58:56] this
[59:01] most people vote without even knowing
[59:04] what the will of God is and really don't
[59:06] care
[59:08] we see that we're in the last days we
[59:11] know what the voice of God says there's
[59:14] not no hope for America
[59:17] there's nothing that's going to bring it
[59:19] back
[59:21] and how many thought that Trump was the
[59:23] guy
[59:24] voting message people getting out and
[59:27] voting for this guy
[59:29] but see it was the voice of politics
[59:33] that was drowning out the real voice of
[59:36] God
[59:38] hello
[59:39] is true
[59:43] and the prophet sits there so they're
[59:45] really without knowing the will of God
[59:47] they're just doing what they want to do
[59:50] well then when Biden comes in we all
[59:52] complain
[59:54] but if we really know that the Lord is
[59:56] Our Shepherd
[59:59] and we understand that the will of God
[1:00:02] is
[1:00:04] then we know that we're in his will we
[1:00:06] were smack dab right in the middle of
[1:00:09] his will do you believe that
[1:00:12] Biden's corrupt he's bringing this
[1:00:14] nation down
[1:00:16] but it's supposed to happen
[1:00:20] can you say Amen
[1:00:22] but we're not calling out for prosperity
[1:00:25] brother man said Prosperity does not is
[1:00:27] not a sign of God's blessings
[1:00:31] hello
[1:00:32] Prosperity is not a sign of God's
[1:00:34] blessings
[1:00:35] but my sheep know my voice
[1:00:39] and if there's ever a time that the
[1:00:41] voice of God must be prominent in our
[1:00:45] lives our church our home it's now
[1:00:51] don't get me swayed by the voice of
[1:00:52] politics
[1:00:54] don't get swayed by the voice of the
[1:00:56] church
[1:00:57] can you say Amen
[1:00:58] that's right see amen another thing
[1:01:02] another voice is the voice of Hollywood
[1:01:04] don't be swayed by that voice
[1:01:06] and you say Amen brother Brown said seed
[1:01:09] the voice of Hollywood has captured the
[1:01:11] world
[1:01:14] that's right
[1:01:15] yes guess what it's doing it's drowning
[1:01:18] out the voice of God
[1:01:19] it's drowning out the voice of the Lord
[1:01:21] so we understand why so many very few
[1:01:25] are going to make it
[1:01:27] too many voices out there let's probably
[1:01:31] let someone come out in Hollywood with
[1:01:33] something you'll find it all over the
[1:01:34] country
[1:01:37] hello
[1:01:39] some popular thing some dress some some
[1:01:42] Style
[1:01:43] it got me in you know wearing these
[1:01:45] skinny jeans
[1:01:47] and churches falling right into it
[1:01:49] message young people falling right into
[1:01:51] it
[1:01:53] it's a voice of Hollywood
[1:01:56] it's true
[1:01:59] see and he says see you find it all over
[1:02:01] the country notice they have set a
[1:02:03] pattern for our women on their dress and
[1:02:06] their heads hairstyles see they set that
[1:02:10] dress
[1:02:11] and the church ought to know the voice
[1:02:13] of the trumpet of God on that
[1:02:15] but there's so much confusion because
[1:02:18] you see others do so and there you set
[1:02:21] them as the examples
[1:02:23] you you see ours these these these
[1:02:26] sisters wearing these short skirts don't
[1:02:28] put that as your example
[1:02:32] they want to go out skiing putting
[1:02:34] putting you know wearing their mini
[1:02:35] dresses and and and wearing her pants
[1:02:38] claiming that's Holiness that ain't
[1:02:39] holiness
[1:02:43] hello
[1:02:45] it's not holiness
[1:02:47] it's a style that is coming in that's
[1:02:51] drowning out the voice of God
[1:02:57] our lady should be ladies our men should
[1:02:59] be men
[1:03:01] and you say Amen
[1:03:03] so he says don't you never pattern
[1:03:06] yourself after that kind of an example
[1:03:08] because it's perishable always hear the
[1:03:12] voice of God what he says about it
[1:03:16] can you say man that's right see so
[1:03:19] there's so many things to get us at a
[1:03:22] place to where we can't hear the voice
[1:03:24] of the Lord
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:29] bran talks about having religious
[1:03:31] holidays there's religious holidays
[1:03:34] Christmas St Patrick's Day
[1:03:37] yeah you know you got your Mother's Day
[1:03:38] Father's Day you got you got all these
[1:03:40] things and and and he says and the
[1:03:42] commercial World captivates that it it
[1:03:45] it it it pounces on that and then they
[1:03:48] make millions and millions of dollars
[1:03:50] off these things
[1:03:52] and the voice of God sets dead
[1:03:57] can you say Amen
[1:03:59] the voice of God
[1:04:01] and so every other voice is setting the
[1:04:04] pace for the world
[1:04:05] setting the pace setting the pace
[1:04:07] setting the pace can you say man
[1:04:11] that is it helping the people
[1:04:13] absolutely not
[1:04:15] is your money helping your people
[1:04:16] helping you absolutely not your fine
[1:04:19] houses find cars find everything
[1:04:21] absolutely not it's making the church
[1:04:24] more dead it's making the church more
[1:04:26] worldly it's making the church more they
[1:04:29] ought to see it and I'm not just saying
[1:04:32] ours I'm just saying it's everywhere
[1:04:36] and these voices are setting the pace
[1:04:39] for the world but it's not the voice of
[1:04:41] the shepherd
[1:04:43] can you say Amen
[1:04:45] it's a voice that's leading them to
[1:04:47] destruction
[1:04:48] and the people become are so gullible so
[1:04:53] unsettled because they don't know the
[1:04:57] voice of the shepherd
[1:05:01] and the prophet says how do you know the
[1:05:03] voice and I'll close
[1:05:04] but the prophet says how do you know the
[1:05:06] voice he said you don't know the voice
[1:05:08] by your ear playing the tape
[1:05:12] but he said you know the voice by your
[1:05:15] heart
[1:05:16] that inner something begins to speak to
[1:05:18] you
[1:05:20] yeah you're hearing the voice of a
[1:05:21] prophet yes you're hearing the pastor
[1:05:24] yet you're hearing the Evangelist you're
[1:05:26] you're hearing
[1:05:28] but the voice of God is something that's
[1:05:30] an inner side inner
[1:05:34] that begins to softly speak to you
[1:05:38] have you ever had that happen sure you
[1:05:41] have
[1:05:43] do it you just know
[1:05:46] this message is right you just know what
[1:05:49] direction to take
[1:05:50] yet you just know
[1:05:53] and and and and how you know it is not
[1:05:57] because you've got uh uh uh some
[1:05:59] sensation or a bundle of emotions
[1:06:04] that you're able to take it back to the
[1:06:07] word
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:09] ain't that right
[1:06:11] you're able to judge the Spirit by the
[1:06:14] word by its motives
[1:06:19] ain't that right
[1:06:22] brother Brown said the only way to
[1:06:24] straighten all these voices out is
[1:06:25] tested by the word
[1:06:27] test it by the word can you say Amen do
[1:06:30] you love the Lord
[1:06:31] amen see
[1:06:33] so what we what we want to do
[1:06:38] is get to the place and I I think it
[1:06:41] would be good for this church
[1:06:45] to get back to the place
[1:06:48] a real sensitivity
[1:06:50] to the voice of God
[1:06:56] don't look to the left
[1:07:00] or the right
[1:07:06] I enjoyed brother Andrew's sermon the
[1:07:09] other day changing our Focus
[1:07:13] see when the Lord is your Shepherd
[1:07:17] and you know that you're following the
[1:07:19] Shepherd by The Voice
[1:07:22] then you're not running to and fro like
[1:07:24] the Bible says you're not fulfilling
[1:07:26] that part of Prophecy
[1:07:29] where they run to and fro
[1:07:32] looking trying to find the word of God
[1:07:36] the Bible says they shall not find it
[1:07:39] but my sheet know my voice
[1:07:42] my sheet my sheep can you say man
[1:07:47] now the Cry of today is behold I stand
[1:07:50] at the door and knock
[1:07:52] If any man hear my voice
[1:07:57] and open the door I will come into him
[1:08:00] and will sup with him and he with me
[1:08:03] I don't think there's any other age
[1:08:08] that has given a challenge to the church
[1:08:13] to hear his voice
[1:08:15] as it is this age
[1:08:17] hear my voice why because God would
[1:08:20] raise up a prophet
[1:08:21] to give an open vision
[1:08:24] amen and all of these voices would be
[1:08:28] sounding at the same time
[1:08:30] and the call would be hear my voice
[1:08:34] hear my voice
[1:08:36] and if you hear my voice and you open up
[1:08:38] to me
[1:08:39] I'll come in and sup with you
[1:08:42] then you begin relationship
[1:08:44] Fellowship
[1:08:46] can you say Amen
[1:08:47] you love the Lord
[1:08:50] check everything with the word
[1:08:53] see
[1:08:56] if the musicians will come
[1:08:59] brother Brown said you might hear in
[1:09:01] your ears the voice speaking
[1:09:03] but when you hear in your heart the
[1:09:05] voice speaking then you're hearing
[1:09:08] you're not you do not see with your eye
[1:09:10] you look with your eye you see with your
[1:09:12] heart
[1:09:13] you see something and say well I just
[1:09:15] don't see it well you're saying you
[1:09:16] don't understand it
[1:09:18] say you do not hear with your ears you
[1:09:20] hear with your heart many times your
[1:09:21] ears hears the true voice of God and it
[1:09:24] falls off of you
[1:09:26] like water off of a duck's back
[1:09:29] see because your ears are hearing but
[1:09:32] when you really hear you hear with your
[1:09:35] heart
[1:09:36] then you know
[1:09:38] the Lord's your Shepherd
[1:09:40] and you're coming in tune with that
[1:09:42] inner voice that small voice can you say
[1:09:45] man
[1:09:47] I want to bring something else out right
[1:09:49] fast but Psalms 95 and 7.
[1:09:53] it says for he is our God and we are the
[1:09:55] people of his pasture and the Sheep of
[1:09:57] his hand today if you will hear his
[1:10:00] voice
[1:10:01] and Harden not your heart
[1:10:06] now you know what he's talking about
[1:10:08] don't let your heart be filled with
[1:10:11] unbelief
[1:10:13] don't Harden your heart
[1:10:16] don't Harden your heart When Trials come
[1:10:20] don't don't don't Harden your heart
[1:10:23] when things come up that seem to be
[1:10:25] impossible
[1:10:27] don't let your heart be filled with
[1:10:30] contempt
[1:10:32] when it seems that God isn't making a
[1:10:34] way of Escape for you
[1:10:38] don't don't let your heart be hardened
[1:10:40] at his voice
[1:10:42] yield to his voice
[1:10:45] can you say man don't let your heart be
[1:10:48] hard and when it seems that God isn't
[1:10:49] working a miracle
[1:10:51] but hear the voice of the shepherd
[1:10:54] no weapon
[1:10:55] that's formed against the eagle and
[1:10:57] prosper
[1:10:59] every tongue that shall rise against the
[1:11:01] end judgment Thou shalt condemn

[1:11:23] Voice
[1:11:24] see see you you're going to see all
[1:11:27] kinds of things and and the voice of the
[1:11:30] Lord will be so contradictory to
[1:11:32] everything all right that if you're not
[1:11:34] careful you'll start doubting that voice
[1:11:36] and you'll Harden your heart against
[1:11:37] that voice and accept every other thing
[1:11:40] don't Harden your heart
[1:11:42] the Lord is your Shepherd
[1:11:44] that voice is the one that's going to
[1:11:45] get you out of here the voice is what's
[1:11:47] calling you wooing you can you say Amen
