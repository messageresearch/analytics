[46:20] says for 40 years old was I when Moses
[46:25] the servant of the Lord sent me from
[46:28] Kadesh
[46:29] barnea to es uh spy out the land and I
[46:34] brought him word again as it was in Mine
[46:38] Heart nevertheless my brethren that went
[46:41] up with me made the heart of the people
[46:45] melt but I wholly follow the Lord my God
[46:50] that's right and Moses swear on that day
[46:54] saying surely the land were on thy feet
[46:57] have trotten shall be thine inheritance
[47:01] and thy children's forever because thou
[47:03] Hast wholly followed the Lord my
[47:05] God and now behold the Lord hath kept me
[47:08] alive as he said these 40 and5
[47:12] years even since the Lord spake with
[47:15] spake this word unto Moses while the
[47:18] children of Israel wered in the
[47:21] wilderness and now lo I am this day four
[47:26] score and 5 years
[47:28] old as yet I am as strong this day as I
[47:32] was in the day that Moses sent me as my
[47:35] strength was then even so is my strength
[47:38] now for war both to go out and to come
[47:42] in now therefore give me this mountain
[47:46] wherefore the Lord spake in that day for
[47:49] thou heardest in that day how the anacom
[47:54] were there and that the city were great
[47:57] and fenced if so be the Lord will be
[48:00] with me then I shall be able to drive
[48:03] them out as the Lord said amen you can
[48:08] have your seats this
[48:12] evening and also we want to remember
[48:15] communion uh this Sunday evening as well
[48:19] the Lord
[48:20] willing but um if I would have a title
[48:25] it's uh would be
[48:27] taking our
[48:29] inheritance by the word in our mouth the
[48:33] Lord and um I would also like to read if
[48:38] you wouldn't mind to ro uh turn to
[48:41] Romans the 10th
[48:45] chapter and
[48:48] um we're going to start at the 8th verse
[48:51] Romans
[48:52] 10 and
[48:55] 8 and it says but what saith it the word
[48:59] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[49:02] thine heart that is the Word of Faith
[49:05] with which we
[49:07] preach that if thou con shalt confess
[49:10] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[49:12] believe in thine heart that the god ha
[49:14] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[49:17] saved for with a heart man believeth
[49:20] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[49:22] confession is made unto salvation
[49:27] so here we reading the word is nigh thee
[49:30] even in thy mouth amen and in thine
[49:32] heart ain't that right that is the word
[49:36] of faith which we
[49:37] preach so here we we look at uh in in
[49:42] our first scripture reading um Caleb is
[49:48] is talking about uh his inheritance in
[49:52] the promised land and um Joshua is
[49:57] fixing to take them over into the land
[49:59] of promise and um uh of course we know
[50:03] what the land is that's that's the land
[50:06] of
[50:08] adoption Israel uh as long as they were
[50:11] in the wilderness they were just
[50:13] sojourners they they could not possess
[50:16] any
[50:17] land uh they they traveled through the
[50:20] land of Moab they travel to Esau's
[50:24] portion and different things but God
[50:27] told them don't even look at that that's
[50:29] that's not your
[50:30] land and so they they had an inheritance
[50:34] that they had to go to and so uh we know
[50:39] that it's the land of adoption this is
[50:41] what brother brandham type that land out
[50:43] as is the land of adoption many people
[50:46] think it's the uh the Millennium but he
[50:49] said that's not true because uh in the
[50:52] Land There was Wars there were
[50:55] conquering and fighting and and that's
[50:58] not to be in in the Millennium ain't
[51:00] that right so Ephesians 1 and5 Paul
[51:04] would say having predestinated us unto
[51:08] the adoption of
[51:10] sons uh by Jesus Christ to himself
[51:14] according to the good pleasure of his
[51:16] will and so it's in that land is where
[51:20] we possess our inheritance that has been
[51:23] given to us by promise ain't that right
[51:26] and and and it's it's to it's to the
[51:30] Overcomer and and um uh it's um so
[51:36] Caleb's inheritance was in that land and
[51:39] and uh God God had delivered uh the
[51:43] children of Israel for that purpose uh
[51:46] from the land of Egypt called them out
[51:49] to go into the inheritance uh if they
[51:52] refus to go in then they perish they
[51:56] died and that's exactly what happened uh
[52:00] but before he would allow them to go
[52:02] into the promised land uh he brought
[52:06] them to a place called Kadesh
[52:09] Baria uh which was uh uh brother said it
[52:14] was the Judgment seat of the world and
[52:16] so this this was the testing ground it
[52:20] was The Proving Ground uh and and and
[52:24] you know brother Brandon would type that
[52:25] out um to where uh there 1 Peter 4:17
[52:29] judgment begins at the house of God and
[52:32] so you you think of that they had to
[52:35] come to a judgment they they had to make
[52:38] their choice they they had to uh God uh
[52:41] had Moses to send 12 Spies over into the
[52:45] land uh now you have to remember they
[52:48] they heard about all that land they
[52:50] heard what was supposed to be in the
[52:52] land uh God never told them about the
[52:55] Giants mean as far as I know uh but he
[52:58] did tell them that he would drive the
[53:00] enemy out he he would drive the
[53:02] inhabitants out before them uh uh but he
[53:06] he he gave them specific things that the
[53:09] of that that land held and so he sent
[53:12] the spies over and of of of course uh um
[53:17] uh 10 of the spies when they came back
[53:20] they had an evil uh report of
[53:23] unbelief uh and and and it's because
[53:27] they they they saw the Giants in the
[53:30] land and uh they saw the walled cities
[53:33] in the land uh uh and they and but they
[53:37] also saw every promise that Moses told
[53:39] him was going to be in the land they
[53:41] they partook of the the fruit they they
[53:44] they uh saw the milk and honey they they
[53:47] saw all of these things but yet they
[53:50] they had a a evil report of unbelief so
[53:54] there was only two that had a good
[53:56] report of faith and and so uh but God
[54:00] would allow that amen before they could
[54:02] go into that promised land and partake
[54:04] of the promise God would allow that the
[54:07] people would hear two different reports
[54:10] and then the people had to judge as to
[54:13] what was truth and and what wasn't uh
[54:16] now they had plenty of opportunity they
[54:19] they had saw the the mighty Miracles all
[54:22] the way through uh uh uh the journey uh
[54:27] God brought them out with a mighty hand
[54:29] and and uh but but not only just out of
[54:32] Egypt but even in in the wilderness he
[54:35] provided for them he clothed them he he
[54:38] fed them he he gave them water he
[54:42] everything they didn't need a red cross
[54:44] the prophet said they didn't need they
[54:46] had Dr Moses and and his medicine was
[54:49] the word of God and and so they they saw
[54:52] the supernatural they uh uh the pillar
[54:55] of fire was with the smitten Rock was
[54:57] with them the Brazen serpent was with
[54:59] them the The Mercy Seat and and all of
[55:02] these things but but uh uh uh uh yet God
[55:07] God wouldn't just allow them to go in
[55:09] they had to judge amen between the two
[55:13] reports so one report declared uh all
[55:16] negative about the land uh declared of
[55:20] uh uh dealt with the symptoms dealt with
[55:22] the problems dealt with the issues that
[55:25] the land had and and and and and and
[55:29] that report explained to the people as
[55:31] to why they couldn't overcome why they
[55:34] couldn't take the land why you
[55:37] understand and and if you've read read
[55:40] that that story amen they saw themselves
[55:43] as
[55:44] grasshoppers uh uh and and and so um
[55:48] that that that's what they got out of
[55:52] out of that so then there was that other
[55:54] report that never looked at the the
[55:56] Giants never looked at the issues never
[55:59] looked at they it just it dealt with the
[56:02] promise of God that we're more than able
[56:05] and everything that God said was would
[56:08] be in that land is there in the land and
[56:11] and and so it it reminded the people
[56:14] that God was the one who gave the
[56:17] promise ain't that right amen and and
[56:20] then they even brought the evidence of
[56:22] the land back to show that that God was
[56:25] right what he had said about the land
[56:28] but of course the people having an evil
[56:31] heart of unbelief amen they they uh uh
[56:35] believe the negative report and we know
[56:37] that these were the unbelievers and make
[56:40] Believers and and and all of these
[56:42] things and so they never went into the
[56:44] land uh that God had told them and in
[56:48] numbers
[56:50] 14:22 uh uh God would say because all
[56:53] those men which have seen my glory and
[56:56] my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in
[56:58] the wilderness and have tempted me now
[57:01] these 10 times uh uh and have not
[57:04] hearkened to my voice surely they shall
[57:07] not see the land which where I which I
[57:11] swear unto their fathers neither shall
[57:14] any of them that provoke me see it now
[57:17] now they were acquainted with the
[57:18] message of the hour they were they sat
[57:21] under a prophet's Ministry and and that
[57:24] Prophet was a Vindicated Ministry but
[57:26] all all the time when trouble come they
[57:30] provoke God they just kept provoking God
[57:33] and provoking God and and and so God was
[57:37] just tired of it he says he tempted me
[57:39] these 10 times and so God made that
[57:41] decree at that Kadesh Baria that final
[57:45] action uh uh there that they would never
[57:48] see the land uh they will not enter into
[57:51] that land but notice he said see uh uh
[57:55] uh the 24th verse but my servant Caleb
[57:59] uh because he had another spirit with
[58:01] him uh and hath followed me fully him
[58:05] will I bring into the land wherein he
[58:09] went and his seed shall possess it now
[58:13] now the prophet identified these two men
[58:16] Joshua and Caleb he said Joshua
[58:18] represented the messenger of this hour
[58:21] the end time leader and Caleb
[58:23] represented that believer that followed
[58:26] that in the end time believer that
[58:28] believed in in the message ain't that
[58:30] right and and so we we find that that
[58:34] Caleb had a different Spirit he was of
[58:37] another uh uh uh kind altogether he was
[58:40] one of the spies uh uh that went over
[58:43] into the land and when he come back he
[58:45] stood with Joshua and and and began to
[58:48] tell the people but God said it and and
[58:52] what God Said is true and here is the
[58:55] evidence thereof up so so Caleb could
[58:58] not see any negative about it all he
[59:01] could see was promise after promise
[59:03] after promise after promise and and you
[59:06] know there's two types of people in in
[59:09] in the message ranks amen they will see
[59:12] nothing but trouble in the message
[59:14] they'll see nothing but negativity in
[59:16] the message but then there will be those
[59:18] that they see nothing but promise after
[59:21] promise after promise after promise but
[59:24] see Caleb didn't follow everything that
[59:27] came along Dayan came on the scene and
[59:30] and and Drew many with him but Caleb
[59:33] stood with J uh with Moses uh uh Kora
[59:36] rose up and came on the scene and Drew
[59:39] many with him but Caleb stayed with the
[59:42] prophet of the age of that hour balam
[59:45] had come on the scene and and caused the
[59:48] people uh uh to mingle and and get into
[59:52] a idolatry and adultery and and it it it
[59:56] was just a mey but Caleb was had a
[59:59] different Spirit he was of a of a
[1:00:02] different kind and and and the prophet
[1:00:05] said you know the there there was only
[1:00:06] two out of the two and a half million
[1:00:09] that knew what it was all about they
[1:00:12] knew they had an understanding of what
[1:00:14] Moses's message was about they they had
[1:00:17] an understanding of what the journey was
[1:00:20] all about they had an understanding of
[1:00:23] what the pillar of fire was all about
[1:00:25] and and the smitten Rock was all about
[1:00:28] and and and all of these things and they
[1:00:31] they they weren't just just uh uh uh
[1:00:34] going blindly amen but they had an
[1:00:37] understanding that this was God taking
[1:00:39] us to the land of promise can you say
[1:00:42] amen and and so uh um Caleb yes he saw
[1:00:48] uh uh what the others saw he saw the
[1:00:50] Giants he saw the wal cities and and and
[1:00:53] yet he saw everything else and him the
[1:00:56] promises outweigh the negative amen well
[1:01:00] the the other spies saw what Caleb saw
[1:01:02] they saw amen the the the all the
[1:01:05] promises they they saw they tasted of
[1:01:08] the evidence that that Caleb had tasted
[1:01:11] of and partook of and all of that but
[1:01:13] all they could see was the negative and
[1:01:17] and and that's what they talked about
[1:01:19] and church if if we could say it this
[1:01:20] way let's not have a negative spirit
[1:01:23] amen let let's not get into a negative
[1:01:26] Spirit I'm talking about me I'm talking
[1:01:27] about you I'm talking about deacons I'm
[1:01:29] talking about preachers I'm talking
[1:01:31] about all of us here amen when the
[1:01:33] Trials come don't get into a negativity
[1:01:37] Amen to where all you see is the Giants
[1:01:40] in the land can you say Amen that that's
[1:01:43] exactly right see and and so we we find
[1:01:47] that they doubted God and they died in
[1:01:50] the wilderness and they they not only
[1:01:52] died physically but but we understand by
[1:01:56] Jesus amen words that they died
[1:01:58] spiritually they were cut off separated
[1:02:01] from God and and church this is where
[1:02:04] we're at today amen Moses had already
[1:02:07] given his message Moses had already
[1:02:10] brought him up amen under the
[1:02:12] supernatural hand of God brought them up
[1:02:15] to that Promised Land amen now it was
[1:02:17] their time Amen to make a judgment
[1:02:20] whether God was right or or or the
[1:02:23] unbelievers were right you understand
[1:02:25] what I'm saying amen and they would make
[1:02:27] that judgment based upon uh uh the the
[1:02:30] the reports amen that they've heard amen
[1:02:33] and this is what's happening today God's
[1:02:35] not going to send us another Prophet
[1:02:38] amen God's not going to send us another
[1:02:40] messenger God's not going to just send
[1:02:42] us something else to convince us if we
[1:02:45] cannot be convinced by the message of
[1:02:47] the hour and the and the supernatural
[1:02:50] that has happened in this age there will
[1:02:52] be nothing ever to convince us amen see
[1:02:55] God God's not going to do anymore it's
[1:02:57] now time for us Amen to to judge what
[1:03:01] report is Right amen did God called me
[1:03:04] to be an overcomer did God say that he
[1:03:07] would be with me amen then let's believe
[1:03:10] that amen but but or we'll look at the
[1:03:12] negativity we'll look and and judge it
[1:03:15] by our feelings we'll judge it by what
[1:03:17] we feel and what we don't feel and and
[1:03:19] all of these things and if you're not
[1:03:21] careful you'll judge God Unfaithful amen
[1:03:25] by the ne netives that is in your life
[1:03:27] can you say amen amen and I say God help
[1:03:30] us all in that amen you see uh people
[1:03:33] are dying today and they're dying
[1:03:35] spiritually people are literally amen
[1:03:38] being cut off from the life of God and
[1:03:41] you see what's amazing it's in this age
[1:03:44] that a prophet would stand and and tell
[1:03:46] us that the token God is requiring a
[1:03:49] token this is the only age that God is
[1:03:52] requiring a token and that token is a
[1:03:55] token of life life must be on display
[1:03:59] life must be manifested life can you say
[1:04:02] amen and only that believer is going to
[1:04:06] manifest the life you say well what kind
[1:04:09] of a life word life amen word life where
[1:04:13] it's showing the evidence of the land
[1:04:15] that that life is is uh uh bringing that
[1:04:19] word to life in in uh uh Our Lives ain't
[1:04:23] that right so the token of life must be
[1:04:26] on display Caleb holy follow the lord
[1:04:31] holy follow the lord now now the the
[1:04:34] others came out but they didn't wholly
[1:04:36] follow the lord every little issue that
[1:04:39] rose up they complained they murmured
[1:04:42] they they griped they griped about the
[1:04:44] way God was doing things they they
[1:04:46] griped about Moses his leadership and
[1:04:49] they griped about this and they griped
[1:04:51] about that and everything was just a oh
[1:04:54] yeah they they they were coming they
[1:04:56] they were being led up to that Promised
[1:04:58] Land but God was going to give them one
[1:05:00] final time Amen to make their judgment
[1:05:04] about the word of God can you say amen
[1:05:07] that's true see and so Caleb wholly
[1:05:10] followed the Lord you see you follow the
[1:05:13] Lord by believing his word amen you say
[1:05:15] well I follow the lord you know because
[1:05:17] I don't cut my hair you ladies and and
[1:05:20] and I wear long skirts that ain't
[1:05:21] following the Lord amen if you're not
[1:05:24] following his word if you can't believe
[1:05:26] all of the word amen then then you're
[1:05:28] not wholly following the Lord amen and I
[1:05:32] think this is where the separation is
[1:05:34] coming amen that there's going to be
[1:05:36] somebody that's going to wholly follow
[1:05:38] the lord regardless sink or swim he come
[1:05:42] hell or high water we're going to follow
[1:05:44] the lord and believe him for what he
[1:05:48] says is the truth you see it takes
[1:05:51] courage amen uh uh uh uh to possess the
[1:05:55] land amen and and we know that if you're
[1:05:58] going to believe the word the word comes
[1:06:00] through a prophet we all know that so so
[1:06:03] God's already sent us a prophet it's
[1:06:05] been Vindicated time and time again a
[1:06:08] ain't that right amen but but now now
[1:06:12] and and we know that brother branham's
[1:06:14] Ministry tied both Moses Ministry and
[1:06:17] Joshua's Ministry amen so we're not
[1:06:19] looking to for some Messenger to come
[1:06:21] and take us over to the land it's
[1:06:23] already taken it's already there we've
[1:06:26] already got a a messenger ain't that
[1:06:28] right and it may not be in a physical
[1:06:30] sense but we got the message of the hour
[1:06:33] amen if we can just believe it and watch
[1:06:36] what let it take us over into our
[1:06:39] inheritance that's what this message is
[1:06:42] about can you say Amen see but it takes
[1:06:45] courage it takes courage to possess the
[1:06:47] land you you understand that church amen
[1:06:50] we're in an age where fear is gripping
[1:06:53] the people just like it did back then
[1:06:56] amen at a time that we should rise up in
[1:06:59] courage to take our inheritance fear is
[1:07:03] overcoming the age amen see and and
[1:07:06] those that are gripping those that are
[1:07:09] afraid to move in with God and to take
[1:07:12] God at his word watch that spiritual
[1:07:15] death take place amen and it's just the
[1:07:18] truth amen see it it it's it's it we're
[1:07:21] Beyond playing games church we we're
[1:07:24] just beyond this amen and and and I'm
[1:07:27] talking for me I'm talking for you I'm
[1:07:29] talking for anybody that's going to
[1:07:30] listen to me amen we're just beyond
[1:07:33] playing gain we're just beyond amen all
[1:07:35] these things we we look at Russia rising
[1:07:38] up we look at Israel doing uh uh and and
[1:07:41] what what's happening there we look at
[1:07:43] the world condition and how everything
[1:07:46] is you may think and the world may think
[1:07:48] it's all chaotic but it's not chaotic
[1:07:51] according to the Prophecies of God God's
[1:07:53] already prophesied these things are
[1:07:55] going to happen but in the middle of all
[1:07:58] that there's a prophecy concerning the
[1:08:00] bride that she takes a courage and she
[1:08:03] possesses the gates of her enemies can
[1:08:06] you say Amen see so it takes courage
[1:08:09] Amen to possess the land it takes
[1:08:12] courage amen we you may be fighting
[1:08:14] today and you're not fighting a natural

[1:10:06] the situation and always ducking always
[1:10:10] trying to find easy route and always
[1:10:12] trying can you say man well God cannot
[1:10:15] you depend on someone who backs down now

[1:11:26] God never would forgive them for a ain't
[1:11:29] that right amen it wasn't the message
[1:11:31] fault it wasn't Moses's fault it was the

[1:14:27] blow your nose son you know I you poor
[1:14:30] little thing I I just feel sorry for you
[1:14:33] no God sent them for a reason he sent
[1:14:36] them to Kadesh Baria for a reason he had
[1:14:39] a purpose in doing that ain't that right
[1:14:42] he allowed them to go through the all
[1:14:44] these things that they went through to
[1:14:46] show them their P his power and by the
[1:14:49] time they got to Kadesh barnea they
[1:14:52] should have been strong like Caleb and
[1:14:54] said I don't care about the Giants I
[1:14:55] don't care about the world city I don't
[1:14:58] care about any sympton God said it's
[1:15:00] right and it's right but they didn't do
[1:15:03] it and you'd think it'd be that same way
[1:15:06] today
[1:15:08] amen amen that's right say but a matured
[1:15:12] son what is a matured Son Well a matured
[1:15:15] son is an obedient son go go listen to
[1:15:18] the the words of the message hear ye him
[1:15:21] and adoption and that a series on
[1:15:24] adoption and so many other uh uh
[1:15:27] messages that a a an a a uh an adopted
[1:15:31] son is a matured son but he's also an
[1:15:34] obedient son what do you mean he knows
[1:15:37] how to handle the business he's been
[1:15:39] under a tutorship and he wasn't looking
[1:15:42] out the window while the the teacher was
[1:15:44] trying to say things he wasn't talking
[1:15:47] and being the class clown while the
[1:15:49] teacher was trying to teach them
[1:15:51] something but he was a studious uh uh
[1:15:54] boy he he he he he was eager to learn
[1:15:57] about the father's
[1:15:58] business can you say amen that's right
[1:16:02] see so he knew he knows that that son is
[1:16:05] an obedient son knows how to handle the
[1:16:07] the business knows what needs to be done
[1:16:10] knows what not needs to be done and and
[1:16:12] and he's he's he's come into an
[1:16:15] agreement with the father he's he's past
[1:16:19] his adolesent uh you know the the
[1:16:21] teenage years were just arguing and I
[1:16:23] know better than Dad and and and this
[1:16:26] and that and and it just becomes a
[1:16:27] tug-of wh and and and two heads in the
[1:16:30] house fighting back and forth and and
[1:16:33] and all these things oh no no no that
[1:16:35] that's a son amen that is disobedient
[1:16:38] that's a son that'll never come to
[1:16:40] adoption that's a son that the father
[1:16:42] can't trust amen but an adopted son is a
[1:16:46] son that the father could place his
[1:16:48] confidence sin amen and give him the
[1:16:51] inheritance of the land of the business
[1:16:54] uh whatever so he's in agreement with
[1:16:58] the Father which for us we're in
[1:17:00] agreement with the word for the word is
[1:17:02] God ain't that right amen so so to to
[1:17:05] say that the message is different from
[1:17:07] God different from Christ it to me it's
[1:17:10] a it's an ignorant uh unlearned son amen
[1:17:14] because if he would listen to the tutor
[1:17:16] he would find out that the word is
[1:17:18] nothing but God himself and when you
[1:17:21] come in agreement with the message you
[1:17:23] come in agreement with the father
[1:17:26] amen he's not trying to change things
[1:17:30] not arguing and complaining about way
[1:17:32] the father does
[1:17:35] things ain't that right now brother
[1:17:38] Brown said if that boy was just a
[1:17:40] renegade no good didn't care for the
[1:17:42] father's business all he thought about
[1:17:44] was flirting and running with women
[1:17:47] drinking or gambling or horse racing
[1:17:50] that boy would always be a son but he
[1:17:52] was never placed in position to have
[1:17:55] heir to all his father's his what his
[1:17:58] father had but if he was a good boy and
[1:18:01] he was about the father's business and
[1:18:03] he proved to be the right child then
[1:18:06] they had a ceremony see and and and I
[1:18:09] had to say it this way but Caleb proved
[1:18:11] to be the right child amen all these
[1:18:14] others didn't prove anything amen when
[1:18:17] the time come when the final test come
[1:18:20] amen that God would give them over amen
[1:18:23] and let them come over into the promise
[1:18:24] land they failed everyone but there was
[1:18:26] Caleb because he was attentive to the
[1:18:29] word of God he was attentive to that
[1:18:31] prophet's words and what that Prophet
[1:18:33] said Caleb hung his life upon Caleb hung
[1:18:38] his soul Upon A can you sayen that's
[1:18:41] right see and so we we find they they
[1:18:44] took the boy if the right child if he
[1:18:47] proved the to be the right child they
[1:18:49] had a ceremony they took the boy out
[1:18:52] into the street and put a white robe on
[1:18:54] him they set him up on a scaffold so all
[1:18:56] the city could see they made a feast uh
[1:18:59] and a jubilee and the father then had
[1:19:02] the ceremony of adoption he adopted his
[1:19:05] own son into his own business and then
[1:19:08] the son was co-equal with his father in
[1:19:11] other words if he had been today the
[1:19:13] son's name on the check was just as good
[1:19:16] as the Daddy's Oh my he had access to
[1:19:20] the account he had access to everything
[1:19:22] that the father had no question to it
[1:19:25] because he had been proven he had been
[1:19:28] tried he had been tested amen he had
[1:19:31] gone on The Proven ground and come out
[1:19:33] right can you say amen and that's the
[1:19:36] same way God is proving Us in this age
[1:19:39] I'm so glad that God sent a prophet I'm
[1:19:41] so glad to what God done for back then
[1:19:44] and I I thank God for the stories of
[1:19:46] that Prophet they never get old amen for
[1:19:49] for me to hear what God done to that
[1:19:51] Prophet but it only solidifies my heart
[1:19:54] that God with that man and whatever that
[1:19:56] man said that's my absolute can you say
[1:19:59] amen amen it was a Vindicated uh God

[1:20:33] the father's business there is a land
[1:20:36] for me amen and if I've got to overcome
[1:20:38] I'm going to overcome if I've got to
[1:20:40] fight my way I'm going to fight my way I
[1:20:42] ain't going to let fear dictate me I'm
[1:20:45] not going to let the demons dictate me

[1:20:50] age this is my time it's the land of
[1:20:54] adoption

[1:21:17] started choosing sides amen they all
[1:21:19] started getting all tore up about the
[1:21:21] problems in the church but Caleb
[1:21:23] wouldn't get troubled up he wouldn't get
[1:21:25] involved in all that he stayed with
[1:21:27] Moses he stayed with that word because
[1:21:29] that word was going to take him
[1:21:31] somewhere and he gained Courage by the
[1:21:34] word how often many times people forget
[1:21:37] the word forget what God promised forget
[1:21:40] what God said forget about all the
[1:21:43] things that God has done in this age

[1:33:28] wasn't there to keep reminding him of
[1:33:29] the promise that's right but he didn't
[1:33:31] need to because that word had now come
[1:33:34] into Caleb's heart and here years later
[1:33:37] now he's reminding Joshua Joshua that's
[1:33:40] my promise I'm going to keep you now I'm
[1:33:43] going to hold you I'm going to tell you

[1:33:54] word was in his
[1:33:55] mouth see we're living in a time where
[1:33:58] it's the word or it's
[1:33:59] nothing you cannot rely on your
[1:34:02] intellect you can't rely upon your
[1:34:03] goodness you can't rely upon your
[1:34:05] servitude you can't rely upon nothing
[1:34:07] you got to rely upon the word of God am
[1:34:10] hello church amen there is no human way
[1:34:14] possible that you're going to withstand
[1:34:16] the devil in this hour but the word of
[1:34:19] God will withstand
[1:34:21] him amen the word will with stand any
[1:34:24] demon amen that's right see so so it's
[1:34:28] it's the word or nothing and and the
[1:34:30] testing ground is to see who is really
[1:34:33] interested in the word that's right
[1:34:35] interested in the word it's good to say
[1:34:38] God sent a prophet it's good to Rejoice

[1:40:14] heart that's right that's why we ain't
[1:40:16] playing you know footsy with the
[1:40:19] devil everybody else getting TVs but
[1:40:22] there's a young people that just ain't
[1:40:23] wanting
[1:40:25] it it's just
[1:40:28] true Lord you know I was raised in in in
[1:40:33] Pentecost and sad to say we didn't we
[1:40:35] didn't believe in TVs we didn't believe
[1:40:37] in going to the movies we didn't believe
[1:40:40] in makeup we didn't believe in cutting
[1:40:41] the hair we were
[1:40:43] Holiness but you know most most of the
[1:40:46] my friends most of in my age or older or
[1:40:51] younger and even parents
[1:40:54] they were only doing it because it was a
[1:40:55] law a lot of the children were only
[1:40:57] doing it because their parents made them
[1:40:59] do it every one of them just about maybe
[1:41:02] one or two out of 50 60 people young
[1:41:06] people that I'm personally acquainted
[1:41:08] with they've all left two three maybe
[1:41:11] the only ones that are standing in in
[1:41:14] out of all of that because they were
[1:41:16] only doing it because of mom and dad
[1:41:18] they were only doing it because they
[1:41:19] were made to do it and and and you know
[1:41:22] it because they would sneak
[1:41:23] and they got away that that that you
[1:41:26] know and and even parents would do it
[1:41:27] too women would do it they they trim
[1:41:29] their hair just where it wouldn't look
[1:41:31] like it was
[1:41:34] cut they try to get away with it wearing
[1:41:37] makeup to just enough to where it
[1:41:38] wouldn't being too
[1:41:41] noticeable hello church it's just the
[1:41:44] truth but God's got young people that
[1:41:46] don't care about sneaking around that's
[1:41:48] right they've got convictions of their
[1:41:50] own the Ragged Christians
[1:41:54] they ain't saying well I just I wish I
[1:41:55] could do that but my parents won't let
[1:41:57] me no no they're standing on their own
[1:41:59] two feet because they realize the
[1:42:01] promise was given to them the words that
[1:42:03] come out of that prophet's mouth is now
[1:42:07] theirs they have received
[1:42:11] itall can you say amen amen Yep this
[1:42:16] bride of Christ today that's on the
[1:42:18] earth she is a word
[1:42:20] bride Amen brother BR said God is proven
[1:42:23] that she is not like Eve that she is not
[1:42:26] that type of a woman she will be Tried
[1:42:29] by his word the Bride As Adam's bride
[1:42:31] was Tried by the word but she will stand
[1:42:34] the test that's right aren't you glad
[1:42:36] for that she will stand the
[1:42:39] test you know uh brother brah says I'm
[1:42:42] trying to tell you what's the truth and
[1:42:45] that's God's word we got to hear that
[1:42:48] small voice of God to measure up to the
[1:42:51] word we're going through a time of
[1:42:54] testing
[1:42:58] Hallelujah don't you like that we're
[1:43:01] going through a time of testing then his
[1:43:03] his his his reaction is going through a
[1:43:05] time of testing Hallelujah
[1:43:10] hallu he said did you realize that after
[1:43:13] that testing come time comes that
[1:43:15] tutorship of that son that was born into
[1:43:18] a denominational family if he stood the
[1:43:20] test and remained with the father's
[1:43:22] desire then that boy was taken out and
[1:43:25] he was put on a garment and and then
[1:43:28] there was a ceremony set and that boy
[1:43:30] was placed then into the family to which
[1:43:33] he was born in that's what the matter
[1:43:36] with our Pentecostals today they just
[1:43:38] jump here and there and organizations
[1:43:41] would pull them this way and that way
[1:43:44] they don't stay with the word but if
[1:43:46] you'll stay with the word then God sing
[1:43:49] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[1:43:51] you see he cannot deny it it's his it's
[1:43:55] his word then there will be a time
[1:43:58] sometime where you'll be taken out and
[1:44:01] set aside and be be given something
[1:44:03] that's genuine Hallelujah the power of
[1:44:06] almighty God I don't believe that we got
[1:44:09] a lot of time I don't believe that
[1:44:11] there's a time I know you know the
[1:44:12] prophet now some you know are teaching
[1:44:15] that as soon as you get the new birth
[1:44:16] you're adopted well that's not what
[1:44:18] brother brandham taught totally against
[1:44:20] what brother Bram taught see and and and
[1:44:23] and so you got to be attentive to the uh
[1:44:25] the word of God Amen well the prophet
[1:44:28] taught that the new birth came and he
[1:44:30] said that is not your placing that is
[1:44:32] not your adoption but then there's a
[1:44:35] time of maturity there's a time of
[1:44:37] growth and and you say well I I ain't
[1:44:39] got much time what what what what's the
[1:44:42] where's the time frame it's not time
[1:44:45] frame it's how much you can yield to the
[1:44:47] word of God it's how much you can
[1:44:50] believe the word of God let the word of
[1:44:52] God be your
[1:44:55] headship can you say amen Amen Let the
[1:44:58] word of God Be Your headship come become
[1:45:01] so submitted to that
[1:45:03] word that's why you got to know what the
[1:45:05] word
[1:45:06] says and become submitted to it deny
[1:45:10] yourself and follow him can you say amen
[1:45:14] that's right see so we find he says see
[1:45:18] God is waiting for his children but they
[1:45:20] just won't line up when they come to
[1:45:22] that testing time will you accept it
[1:45:25] well the church will put me out all
[1:45:28] right there you are see then go see
[1:45:30] that's not Abraham's seed Abraham's seed
[1:45:32] doesn't act like that Abraham's seed see
[1:45:35] well now I don't care what come contrary
[1:45:37] to Abraham he stayed right with the Word
[1:45:39] of Promise he just stayed right with it
[1:45:41] no matter how Sarah come and others come
[1:45:44] different ones come everything he
[1:45:46] counted it as though it wasn't see he
[1:45:48] looked he believed that he could see the
[1:45:51] Promise because God promised it to him
[1:45:55] and that was all there was to it it was
[1:45:57] God's word and it stayed right in him
[1:46:01] ain't that right then God gave him the
[1:46:04] final test I'll give him a double
[1:46:06] portion and try him now he's already got
[1:46:09] the sun he sees that he's got it see but
[1:46:13] now I'll tell him take that son up and

[1:46:18] kill that son I'll try him now I'll try
[1:46:21] him God loves to try his people
[1:46:24] I mean he waited I mean you think that
[1:46:26] would have been good enough waiting for
[1:46:29] 25
[1:46:30] years and and and not even counting

[1:46:49] things but Abraham just stayed with the
[1:46:51] promise yeah and then he gets the son
[1:46:56] and God says I'll try him doubly
[1:46:58] now Abraham go kill him go offer him up
[1:47:02] as a
[1:47:03] sacrifice but the word stayed in him
[1:47:06] that word remained in
[1:47:09] him he went out there and he told that
[1:47:12] that his servants he says you'll stay
[1:47:14] here me and the lad will
[1:47:17] return why because he knew that even
[1:47:20] though that boy would die God would
[1:47:22] raise him up God had promised it to him
[1:47:26] can you say Amen is that the faith you
[1:47:29] have tonight if it's not God give it to
[1:47:33] us can you say Amen if the musicians
[1:47:37] will
[1:47:38] come take that son up and kill it let
[1:47:41] that son see will he kill that son said
[1:47:45] Abraham true to the word how when how
[1:47:48] when you receive the promise how you
[1:47:50] going to stop the thing how you going to
[1:47:53] how you going to ever expect to be a
[1:47:55] father of Nations and here you are 115
[1:47:58] years old now little Isaac about 15 14
[1:48:02] years old how are you going to be a
[1:48:03] father of Nations when you're 115 years
[1:48:06] old here's your only child you're
[1:48:08] destroying your only evidence that you
[1:48:10] have how am I going to make it if I ever
[1:48:13] get out of my organization how am I ever
[1:48:15] going to make it if I do this oh listen
[1:48:17] to that still Small Voice and come to
[1:48:19] the word you say I Heard a Voice tell me
[1:48:22] this if it's contrary to the word it
[1:48:24] wasn't God's voice God's voice comes to
[1:48:28] the word can you say Amen you love
[1:48:33] him that's
[1:48:35] Hallelujah and what is the word that
[1:48:37] we're
[1:48:40] believing Paul says we come not unto you
[1:48:43] in word only but in power and
[1:48:45] demonstration of the holy spirit so the
[1:48:48] word that we're believing is is it's
[1:48:51] it's made Power brother Bram said as
[1:48:54] well as in
[1:48:55] voice so we're not just talking about
[1:48:57] the Bible anybody could have the Bible
[1:49:00] and yet have wrong interpretations of
[1:49:01] the Bible but when you see that
[1:49:05] scriptures come alive
[1:49:07] today then you know it's the word of the
[1:49:09] Lord amen it's the word of the Lord
[1:49:12] speaking ain't that
[1:49:14] right
[1:49:16] therefore we're talking about the
[1:49:19] Revelation the word that we have
[1:49:21] received the word that is n thee it's
[1:49:23] the Revelation that has been preached in
[1:49:25] power and
[1:49:26] demonstration and it's matching it's
[1:49:28] scriptural it's matching every promise
[1:49:30] of the Bible for this age can you say
[1:49:33] amen and then when we receive that word
[1:49:36] into our hearts how do you receive it
[1:49:39] into your heart by believing it by just
[1:49:41] simply believing it God said it I ain't
[1:49:43] going to try to reason it I ain't going
[1:49:45] to try to figure it out God said it it's
[1:49:48] over it's
[1:49:50] done and when you receive it into your
[1:49:52] heart it becomes into your mouth for out
[1:49:56] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:49:58] speaketh can you say Amen so we don't
[1:50:01] speak the word by reasoning you don't
[1:50:04] reason God's word you speak the word by
[1:50:07] faith because you believe God's word you
[1:50:10] believe it you don't consider the
[1:50:12] symptoms you don't consider the Giants
[1:50:13] you don't consider the negative you
[1:50:15] don't consider nothing you received it
[1:50:18] by faith into your
[1:50:20] heart and by the mouth the mouth
[1:50:23] speaketh can you say amen and what does
[1:50:26] it do you may not have a natural sword
[1:50:30] but the word in your mouth has become a
[1:50:32] sword to the
[1:50:34] enemy amen and what we have is the king
[1:50:38] sword can you say Amen God's very own
[1:50:43] word that he used to defeat nations with
