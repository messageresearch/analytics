[Music] He promised us that he would be a counselor, a mighty God, and a prince of peace. He promised us that he would be a father and would love us with a love that would not cease. Well, I've tried him and I found his promises are true. He's everything he said that he would be. The finest words I know. Cannot begin to tell just how much Jesus really means to me. For he's more [Music] wonderful than my mind can conceive. He's so wonderful and my heart does believe he goes beyond my highest hopes and my fondest dreams.

Do you have that determination &gt;&gt; going all the way? Amen. And uh we're fixing to cross the finish line and um we certainly can't uh turn back now. Amen. Too close to the end. And um I'm looking forward to it. It's good to uh see everyone. Good to have brother Bob, sister Janice Amen back with us. Amen. And um um the musicians can be dismissed. And I certainly enjoyed the the song specials tonight. Amen. And John, you've done a good job. Amen. And um my wife always does a good job. &gt;&gt; And so uh but we appreciate that. And u good to have brother Amos and sister Lisa back with us. Amen. Always miss you all when you're gone. And um brother Amos said they had some wonderful services and so we thankful to the Lord for that. Amen. Uh if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to the book of John. the um 14th chapter. And just to remind you that um I won't be here this coming Sunday uh be ministering down there uh for brother Fred Mullins's and um so covet your prayers uh for that and uh we'll be praying for the service here and brother Terry's going to be uh ministering and so um um I'm sure uh you will be blessed uh by that. And we certainly appreciate Brother Terry and appreciate um uh the ministers here just love the message and love God's people and doing everything to to make us ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so uh but John the 14th chapter, we'll uh read there, but let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Amen. I certainly believe that we need him. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, as we approach this sacred time, Lord, we realize the responsibility that you have put upon our shoulders as ministers of the gospel. And Lord, I certainly want to do my part. I don't want to be sluggish, Father, in the call that you've called me to the work. And I just pray, Lord, that you would help me just to yield myself, Lord, to thee. And Lord, as you have wrote this book, Father, and you inspired men and and gave them that uncction to write your words. And I'm just asking that that same spirit would come among us, Lord, and inspire me, Father, to speak your word and inspire the people to believe the word. give us understanding and father the needs that are here that are present or maybe those that couldn't come tonight due to sickness or whatever it would be I pray that you would help them. Father, we just commit it into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and and to um just to remind you that brother Hunter is having his meeting uh starting tonight and uh so um I think the services are uh 7:00 nightly and uh Saturday is uh 6. will start at 6 pm. And so, um, I'm sure you'll be blessed if you're able to make it, uh, there. Praise the Lord. But, uh, John, uh, the 14th chapter and, um, we want to look at the first verse u Jesus saying, let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am, there you may be also. Amen. You can have your seats this evening. And uh just taking a title, there is a place prepared for me. &gt;&gt; And uh that ought to give us all hope that there is a place prepared &gt;&gt; here. uh Jesus um is talking of the future and he's telling us of what will be not uh what may happen you know uh but what will happen what will be and so he goes to make preparation if if if you're expecting something if you're expecting a future event then you you plan for that event. You um you know uh you mothers that you know you having your baby and uh Ann and and Branson fixing to have have their first child and so they've been preparing getting ready and because they're under expectation for uh uh the arrival of their their child, &gt;&gt; right? And so Jesus is saying, "I'm I'm going to prepare a place for you and and because uh he knows, you know, uh he he knew that that we would be there, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And so you see, God has an infinite mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um and that is as the prophet would tell us, that's how he knows uh the end from the beginning. He's not taking things on a daily basis, just a day by day. &gt;&gt; But he knows the end from the beginning. So nothing happens by chance. &gt;&gt; Um uh your your salvation, your natural birth, all these things. He already knew all this to happen. So I read you a uh just a series of scriptures here. Uh John 15:18. known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. Isaiah 46:9, "Remember the things, the former things of old, for I am God, there is none else. I am God, there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, &gt;&gt; and from ancient times the thing that are not yet done." &gt;&gt; Uh saying, "My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29:11. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace, not of evil, to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. Whom he called, he also justified. Whom he justified, them he also glorified. Ain't that right? 2 Thessalonians 2:13. But we are bound to give thanks always to God. For you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation. God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation. We find Jude 4. For there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation. Amen. So when did God express his love toward us? Was it when we uh had first uh got a religious thought or uh a feeling come over us? Or was it when we first asked him into our heart or uh when we, you know, sung our first gospel song or preached our first uh uh sermon or whatever? Well, you know, uh Paul would ex, uh tell us through, uh the story of of Jacob and Esau, and he wrote of them saying God declared, uh that he loved Jacob and hated Esau. &gt;&gt; Now, listen to that. God declared that he he hated Esau and yet he loved Jacob before the children were yet born and before they had done good or good or evil. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, so we find that it's always before the foundation of the world. And so the prophet says now God before the foundation of the world who knew the end from the beginning. He knew the end from the beginning by fornowledge. He elected where to cut. He knew where to cut. Amen. And so he knowed the difference between Esau and Jacob. He knows the difference between sinner and saint. He knowed the difference. SEE, HE NOT presently knows. He knew back before the foundation of the world. He knows every motive of every heart. knows the motive of every heart. So he elected us before the foundation of the world and put our names on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God knew HE HE KNEW WHERE TO CUT. He knew every every individual from the the THE START OF TIME ALL THE WAY TO THE end of time. He knows every individual and he knows what is in the heart. He knows where that person is. And so he doesn't have to wait for you to do something and and good or bad or whatever. He doesn't even have to wait. Amen. To put you on trial. He already knows about you before the foundation of the world. So he could actually elect and choose before uh we came. And so uh we find that the lamb, the Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. The prophet said he was elected back there to be the lamb to be slain. And notice we were elected to be the one that he was slain for. Amen. So this this uh thought of Christ dying and now he's JUST SITTING HERE WITH A PUPPY dog look and and and just hoping somebody will feel sorry for him. Well, that's that's not the case. He was he was predestinated to be slain and we were the people predestinated to be redeemed. Amen. And and so uh uh this is all there. So so see WHAT WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS GOD CAME TO DELIVER YOU. GOD CAME to deliver me. And uh uh so the prophet said it's the predestinated church I'm talking to, NOT THOSE OUT THERE say no sir. out of every group. He's pulled his predestinated and THAT'S WHAT HE'S COMING for in every age. Now, the rest is just playing church. Amen. They're just playing around with God. But there is a predestinated people. Amen. That is giving their everything TO GOD BECAUSE GOD KNEW THAT THEY WOULD. There's no struggling to be a Christian. Not to the bride. Amen. There's no impersonation of being a Christian, not to the bride. God already knew what was in them. And so so while the bride is coming up and and and THE POWER OF TRANSFORMATION is taking a hold, the rest are remaining in their same old stuper, same old habits, same old ways. Amen. Same. And there ain't nothing there to to cause them to want to repent. There's nothing there to cause them to want to come up higher. And actually, they get jealous of the bride. They get jealous of the church. Amen. They they they look and they get angry with it because they see someone rising up. Amen. And and they want everybody to remain down here with them and they just don't understand. But see, God already knew. Amen. Before the foundation of the world. Now, the prophet uh uh you see uh uh the same God that predestinated you before the foundation of the world, he also said, "Now I go to prepare a place for you." See, SO HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT HIS ELECTION is going to stand. HE KNOWS THAT HIS PREDESTINATED WILL, AMEN, nothing is going to detour it. Amen. So therefore, he says, I go to prepare. Not not when you come, Amen. and you die and and you've proven yourself. NOT NOT AT THE time that you've overcome. AMEN. BUT BEFORE YOU COULD EVER HAVE A CHANCE IN LIFE, AMEN, to do good or bad, he says, "I'll go to prepare a place for you." Amen. Before you WENT THROUGH YOUR TRIALS, BEFORE YOU WENT through your ups and down, before you failed, AND AND ALL OF THESE THINGS, he is declared because, see, he knows the future. HE'S PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE because he's already declared it. Can you say amen? He knows. He knows where we're going. How many believes that he knows? HE KNOWS I WAS GOING TO GIVE MY HEART TO HIM. HE KNOWS, AMEN. that if if I ever, Amen. He knew that if I'd hear THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, I WOULD COME OUT OF BABYLON AND AND I WOULD COME OUT OF THESE things and give my life to it, to this message. And he knew that. AND HE KNOWS THE PLACE I'M GOING. SO, HE GOES BEFORE ME AND PREPARES IT. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See now uh uh we find the devil you know wants us to believe that you know that that Jesus statement was only to his disciples but that's not true. Amen. What Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you as to every predestinated believer that that had their names written in the lamb's book of life. Amen. See and and and believers are those that have their names written in the lamb's book of life. Amen. See the believer. See, so God secured the believer. You're not secured now. You're secured back then. He didn't secure you at a certain time in your life. YOU WERE SECURED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WHEN HE WROTE YOUR name in THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, AMEN, THAT'S WHEN YOU WERE SECURED. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. See, and so we we find that the believer is a predestinated gene seed of God. HE IS A PART of God. Do you believe that? Amen. See, so, so what a believer is in their natural birth has no relation, Amen. to what God predestinated them to be, to what they really are. Amen. It it no ties. Amen. And I'm so glad for that. See, we had to come the way we came. As the prophet says, "And who is this Melzdc?" We bypassed the word part. Amen. And we had to become flesh to be tempted and tested and and all of these things. And and and and that was through our our first birth. And and and we had to come that way to know who God is and what he is and and to know him in a greater way. Amen. Than Adam even did. Amen. Before he fell. ADAM HAD FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. THAT HE DOES. He has no idea had no idea of what God was like you have. Amen. So our fellowship with God is even in a greater way than what Adam's fellowship with with God because Adam as he fellowship with God, he never knew God as a savior. He never knew God as a healer. He never knew God as a way maker. He never knew all of these things. Amen. But now you and I do. Amen. And so our worship goes deeper than even their worship BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT GOD DONE FOR US. WE KNOW HOW UNWORTHY WE WERE. BUT GOD'S GRACE CAME, AMEN. and rescued us. He is my redeemer. He is my savior. Amen. And and I trust you can say the same thing. Sin required a savior. Amen. Sickness required a healer. Bondage required a deliverer. Amen. And and our origin where we fell from required a redeemer. Ain't that right? See, and so, Amen. It it everything in God's plan, Amen. Sin was not meant to destroy the elect of God. Amen. Sin, Amen, was not meant, AMEN. TO STARE GOD'S WRATH, AMEN, TOWARD THAT ELECT. AMEN. If anything, it steered his love toward us. Amen. WHEN HE SAW US MARRED IN SIN, GOD'S LOVE REACHED DOWN. AMEN. And and and picked us up. Aren't you glad for that? Amen. See, so we find that that God is eternal. And which means he has never had a beginning. He'll never have an ending. Amen. He's the only one. He's the source of eternal life. Amen. And so God is savior. He's redeemer. He's deliverer. Amen. and and he was all of these things, but yet he couldn't, as the prophet would tell us, he could not be expressed in them things. Amen. Without uh the fall of man. Can you say amen? So, he wanted to express what he was. Amen. He knew what he was, BUT HE WANTED TO EXPRESS IT TO SOMEBODY. AMEN. And be praised for it. The angels praise him, but your praise is a lot greater than the angels. Amen. There's there's angels all around the throne tonight singing holy, holy, holy, holy. They've been doing that for eons of time. But your praise is EVEN DIFFERENT THAN THEIR PRAISE. It's deeper praise. IT'S A GREATER PRAISE. IT'S THE PRAISE THAT GOD actually wanted. Amen. Because you weren't just made to praise God. Amen. But God made you with A FREE WILL. AMEN. and in your trials AND IN YOUR TROUBLES AND IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, YOU WALK INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO LIFT YOUR HANDS and you BEGIN TO WORSHIP HIM. THAT MEANS MORE TO GOD THAN THE ANGELS THAT ARE all around him worshiping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the fall allowed God to express himself in all of his attributes. Now we of course we didn't come forth as sons of God when we come uh to earth by the natural act of our parents. Amen. We expressed this sinful nature. Amen. And uh uh uh because that which was part of God had not yet been expressed. It it had not been quickened. Had not been received a birth. There there was a gene seed laying there. Amen. Yeah. Uh, that's why you got to be born again. Amen. Because you were born once and had a body. Amen. But God takes that same SINFUL BODY. AMEN. And causes another birth within you. Amen. The same body. Amen. But it's a spiritual birth. Amen. And so we we find that uh uh uh that that which was part of God had not as of yet uh be when we were out in the world and all that, it had not received a birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it didn't cause God to lose us. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? It didn't cause God to to lose us. Yes, we were lost. Amen. And uh uh uh due to the fact that we couldn't find our way back to God, but not so lost. Not so lost that God didn't know where we were. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I was lost. Oh yes. Amen. But not so lost that God didn't even know I was. That God couldn't find me. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? YOU SEE, THE prophet described it that the Holy Spirit, he searches all throughout the earth. He'll go down through the dark tin alleys, you know, the dark alleys, and he'll go through the beer beer joints, AND HE'LL GO TO THE HONKY TONKS, AND HE'LL GO TO EVERY CHURCH. HE'LL GO TO AMEN. EVERYWHERE. UH, AMEN. because he knows he's GOT A SEAT SOMEWHERE. AMEN. That's right. See, and and he knows where to find us. Ain't that right? See, and so I know that Satan would like for us to believe that we're beyond hope. Amen. And and these things. And I'll say your your your parents, Amen, they might have been evil and wicked. Your your family tree uh uh might might be so disgraced and and uh uh you know, the history might not be so great. And you may have even been raised in a a religious family. And you know, the prophet says a religious man is is is the worst sinner there is. Amen. God can deal with a a sinner. Amen. just an outranking sinner than he can a religious person. Amen. One that don't uh that feels like they're okay and yet they can go out and do all kinds of stuff. They they can do sin and hide it and and and and come to church and rejoice and all that. Amen. But you know, if a man ain't got the Holy Ghost, he's just a ranked sinner. Amen. But see, we could have been Amen. a as that in in that condition. Amen. But no matter what your background was or what you were mixed in, God didn't lose you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Titus uh second uh Timothy, I believe 2:19 says, you know, nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this sealed, the Lord knoweth. Everybody say, "The Lord knoweth them that are his." &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes the Lord knows you? Amen. Ask his Remember, there's going to be people that come uh uh up there that says, "Lord, have we not prophesied? Have we not cast out devils in thy name? Have we not done this?" And he says, "Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity. I never knew you." But God says here, "The foundation of God stand assure. The Lord knoweth them that are his." We ain't going to come to him as a stranger. We're not living in this life as a stranger anymore. Can you say amen? So we find Jesus said in John 6:38, he says, "For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me that all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day." Ain't that right? So when Jesus says, "I go to prepare a place for you," he's talking to those whom the father has given &gt;&gt; him. Can you say amen? He's talking to those. Amen. Where he says, "I've not lost a one. I will raise him up again." Amen. That's who he's talking to. A ain't that right? Amen. Because he knew he would not lose a one. That was the father's will. that all the father has given me, I've not lost a one. Amen. And and so he knew he wouldn't lose a one of those uh uh names. Amen. Now you understand, see that the names that are written in the lamb's book of life are the ones that cannot be lost. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It cannot be lost. Amen. Now, the Bible mentions a book called the book of life. Amen. and and it is also referred to as the lamb's book of life. And and and if you look at the scriptures, I won't read them, but Revelations 13:8, Revelation 17:8, Revelations uh 20:12-15, you will see that the scriptures mention a book, singular, a book. A ain't that right? Now the prophet said, see there's no basis for the claims that the lamb's book of life is not the same as the book of life. So the lamb's book of life, the book of life are not two separate books, but it's one book. Can you say amen? Amen. The prophet said the book of life might be called the lamb's book of life or Christ's book of life or even thy book and book of the living. Only names are written in this book. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So it's one book and this book is a record of life. Amen. The lamb's book of life. See? Amen. Uh the book of life. And and so the prophet said, see life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book. You see, our natural life is recorded in a book. every deed, every lie, every bad thought, EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT secretly openly. Amen. You can go in your truck, you can go in the closet, you can go in a secret room and look at things on your phone that YOU SHOULDN'T LOOK AT. AMEN. And God knows it. And it's being recorded. Every little thought, whether it's a thought of bitterness, thought of vengeance, thought of hatred, a lustful thought, an adulterous thought, whatever, it's all being recorded in a book of life. Can you say amen? Amen. Now the prophet said, "Your name of your first nature was born and put in the book in a book of life. All your deeds was wrote in it too. Everything you've done under that nature was put in a book called the book of life." Now notice under that nature, amen, was put in a book called the book of life. Ain't that right? Now there's so much confusion when you talk about the book of life and the lamb's book of life and and and some you know uh uh teach that your name can be taken out of of the lamb's book of life and and others uh you know it's a common belief that when you come to the altar you've accept God then God is writing your name in the lamb's book of life and and and he sees this says oh that's nice you know and and and so he writes your name when you uh uh uh whatever. But see, we would be confused as well if it had not been that God sent us a prophet with the message of the hour to let us know. Amen. And to make clear. Now, this book, Amen, contains names. Your name, my name, the names of every individual that has ever lived from Adam all the way down. Amen. It contains names. And all the names, amen, that are in the book were written before the world began. Every name in the book. Now the prophet says most Bible students have drawn the conclusion that when a person is born again, then God writes his or her name his or her name in uh um uh the lamb's book of life. And if for any reason that name is removed, then there's a space on the record will simply be blank as it was before the name was placed there. Well, that's a false teaching. The prophet said there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names. This was all done before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But in this book that we're talking, there is a section. &gt;&gt; In the book, the prophet said, that is called the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; In the section, there is a uh uh the book of life. But then there's a section called the lamb's book of life. Amen. See, and and the names that are written in that section are the ones that God predestinated to make his bride. Amen. To make up his bride. These are the ones that God predestinated. Amen. When he had the lamb slain. Amen. That lamb was slain for their names written in the section of the book. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so if you are elect, then uh uh your name isn't written in the book of life, but it's written in the section that is in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, every man, woman, boy, and girl, Amen, whose name is written in the book of life, they're going to have to stand before the white throne judgment. Amen. And and to be judged according to his or her life that was lived up on on on the earth. They will be judged according to their works of what they did on earth. Amen. Because the book of life is a record of the person's life. Can you say amen? It's it's just a record of of their natural life. But those whose names were written in the lamb's book of life, it's not their life. It's the lamb's life. Can you say amen? Amen. See, and so they're NOT GOING TO HAVE TO be judged. He took our judgment. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So this is why Colossians 3 now he's not Paul when he's writing he's not talking to the world he's talking to those who have their names written in the lamb's book of life and he says for you are dead your life is HID WITH CHRIST in God &gt;&gt; when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory it is true true that we lived a sinful life. It is true, amen, that we were born sinners and had a a carnal nature. It is true that we needed to repent. But our names were written in the Lamb's book of life. Can you say amen? You see, that's the only way we can repent. That's the only way we can move forward. That's the only way we can look to the future is because our names were written in the Lamb's book of life. So as the prophet said about the woman at the well, she had representation. THAT'S WHY SHE COULD SAY, "SIR, I KNOW WHEN the Messiah cometh, he will do these things." Why? Amen. As soon as that LIGHT FLASHED ACROSS HER PATH, THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN INSIDE THAT GRASP IT AND SAID, "YOU ARE THE MESSIAH." He had been around and he had performed THE SAME SIGN TO the priest. But the prophet SAID HE WAS BLACKENED OUT. AMEN. because he had no representation. Amen. Aren't you glad for that? See, our names were written. Now, the prophet said, "Jesus come to redeem those name, those that had their names in the book." Another place before the foundation of the world, God wrote your name in the lamb's book of life by his spoken word and sent Christ THE SACRIFICE TO BUY to redeem that same group that he had wrote their names in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. So while you were a sinner, see God already knew everything about you. God already knew what Satan would do and how he would trip you up, but you could never GET SO LOST. UH YOUR PATH COULDN'T GET SO DARK THAT GOD COULD NOT SEE you and that he would lose you and don't know where to FIND YOU. THAT HE'S already made a plan. I'm going to redeem them. Oh, aren't you glad for that? And his so determined love for us, his plan for us is he did not have to wait for us to be born to have a lamb slain. The lamb was slain before the foundation of the world, before there ever was a first sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Committed. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; But somewhere in in this dimension of time, this mortal life, we separated from our old life &gt;&gt; somewhere. Yeah. You may have drank. You may have uh stole. You may have been the biggest liar. You you you may have cheated. You may have done all these things. But somewhere in this life, &gt;&gt; mortal life, you separated from that life. &gt;&gt; NOW, THE PROPHET SAID, "YOU separated and and and I would encourage you to go listen to the invisible union of the bride." &gt;&gt; You you ought to go listen to that. Amen. You separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now, Brother Brham, he's talking, of course, it looks sounds like he's talking about a natural woman and a and a natural man. In one way he is, but the depth of it IS HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE CHURCH and and Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and the world, he said, but you separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you are what? born again &gt;&gt; or remarried again. See why your your your wife. Amen. That old nature that brother Brand would type out as our first wife, our first lover. Amen. That nature, it died. It It loved the world. It craved the world. Oh, you could have went to church, but you was like a prisoner in church. You just like a zoo, you know, JUST YOU'RE WANTING TO GO OUT THERE, BUT everybody telling you you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't do this and about to drive you crazy. Amen. But when that nature dies, THERE IS A SEPARATION. YOU SEPARATED from that by spiritual death. Now you're born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world, but of eternal life. Notice that germ that was in you at the beginning found you. &gt;&gt; Now your old book is gone. &gt;&gt; There's no record of you anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you would have been standing at the white throne judge, there's no book for you. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING FOUND FOR YOU. YOU'D BE JUST STANDING UP THERE AND GOD SAYS, "OKAY, bring the book." Well, there ain't no book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU BE JUDGED IF THERE'S no record? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So, he says, "See, uh uh your old book is gone with your old union. Now, your names has been transferred. Now, you say, do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness?" You stand perfectly before God now. Your name is now, he said, your name is now in the new book, not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. Amen. In other words, your record now, amen, is is now switched over. Your life that you're living is now switched over. You was a sinner. And Satan could condemn you. Satan could ACCUSE YOU BEFORE GOD BY THAT LIFE. BUT WHEN GOD PUT IT IN THE SID FORGETFULNESS, WHO CAN FIND IT? Even the devil can't find it. God can't find it. And your LIFE NOW IS BY THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. There's nothing against you. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It's true. Can you say amen? See what the He said. So, see, you stand perfectly before God. Your name is now in the new book. Not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. What the lamb redeemed. &gt;&gt; Not the old book of your natural union. Amen. But your new book or your new bride, see? Hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold. &gt;&gt; Now you're not only forgiven, but you're justified. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Our sins are divorced from us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That word divorce is separating two things that commonly interact and belong together. &gt;&gt; Your sins belong to you &gt;&gt; by your natural birth. &gt;&gt; By that first nature, it belonged to you &gt;&gt; you couldn't you couldn't break from it if you had to. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God through the blood through redemption separated you, &gt;&gt; DIVORCED YOUR SINS FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So what we were in our first birth has nothing to do with the gene seed of God. And this is why God does not impute iniquity to his own. Right. &gt;&gt; Psalms 32:2. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity. &gt;&gt; Paul picks it up in Romans 4:8. Blessed is the man. Now, church, you're blessed. &gt;&gt; If If God does not impute sin to you, you're blessed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I I don't care how bad you've gotten in life. I don't care how discouraged you get. You might be a poor as Job's turkey and that had to lean against the wall just to gobble. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; that's pretty bad. &gt;&gt; But you're blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if if if he does not blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the prophet says, "Now the thing of it is you say, "Well, we'll just live loose." That shows your name isn't on the book. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. That proves that you wasn't uh uh when you tried to live any kind of life that you want to live. See, that shows you haven't got it. If you're a real Christian, you'll live the real life &gt;&gt; because the life in Christ is in you and you can't do nothing else but live the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; See, this isn't a rodeo. This isn't parent uh trying to make the child or the pastor trying to to to to make the the the church and and the the the singers and the musicians and the officers to conduct themselves in the right way. &gt;&gt; It ain't a rodeo. &gt;&gt; THIS IS BETWEEN GOD and and and that man, that woman, boy, girl that has their names written in the lamb's book of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so he says, see, you can't do nothing. So Jesus says, see, all that the father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody say, will come. &gt;&gt; Now, do we have to pray that for our loved ones? You bet. That's all part of God's will. &gt;&gt; Just as much as as when when God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life, he had to have send a redeemer to come and literally die for us. &gt;&gt; But it was all A PART OF GOD'S PLAN. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "Those who have their name written on the lamb's book of life see their name when the seals are thrown open there and the Holy Spirit speaks to them and they come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They come. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; This why we're dedicated to preach the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in preaching anything else. &gt;&gt; I I'm only after bride. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. This is why the prophet said, "You see, we're pulling and sainting, trying to find where those people are that have their name or that their name was put in the lamb's book of life." So, THAT'S WHAT THE PROPHET WAS TRYING TO DO. HE THAT'S WHY HE STAYED WITH THE MESSAGE. THAT'S why he didn't preach a Billy Graham sermon. That's why he didn't preach a a a a Charles Wesley sermon and uh or whatever. He was after those names that were written in the LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. AND I JUST believe that GOD'S CALLED ME TO PREACH THIS MESSAGE. AMEN. God knows what is what. Everybody is going in into TO WHATEVER PLACE THEY ARE. THAT IF GOD HAS GOT A NAME STILL ON THIS EARTH, I'M OUT TO PREACH A MESSAGE. AMEN. That God, by God's grace, we can get it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And it could be that that name is sitting on a church pew &gt;&gt; that needs God &gt;&gt; and they don't know it yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, so the rest will never come. &gt;&gt; As the prophet, you know, said, "Amen." That that you you're you're preaching, you're you're casting the net out, and you draw a lot of them in, and one by one. Amen. The the spiders go back, THE CRAWFISH GO BACK, AND this goes back, and that goes back. But but but there's got TO BE A TROUT SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; THERE THERE'S GOT TO BE A keeper somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it ain't it ain't up to us to keep them. It's up to God to keep them. Can you say amen? Because it's it he knows he knows his own. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so the prophet says the same God that called your name and wrote it on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world has already made a place in uh uh in glory for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that? Yes. &gt;&gt; And when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting for us in the way he's fashioned. Now, so who are the people that have the Holy Ghost? Amen. Well, it's those who have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life. That's what the Holy Ghost was given for is the those names. They're the only ones that will have it. Others may act like they have it and and but it's only to those who have their name written in the lamb's book of life. Well then what is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is a seal. Everybody say it's a seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4:30. It says, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption." Now notice what a prophet said. This is the sealing time. This is the sealing time. See? And so therefore, the seal of God, Amen, is the life of God. Amen. And which is the token that God is requiring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So close. Remember the Jesus said in this last day, it'd be so close that it deceive the very ELECT IF IT WAS POSSIBLE. BUT THERE'S ONE thing about it. THIS ELECT HAS A SEAL. YEAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, the prophet said, "This seal is a sign that the seed has been geratized with eternal life." Zoe, my own life, God's own life. See, and I'll raise it up again at the last day. And as you walk, as you walk, you're sealed. You have confidence that the life of Christ is in you and you are in him. by one spirit. We're all baptized into one body, SEALED THERE BY THE Holy Ghost among this believers like this until the day that Jesus raises us up. &gt;&gt; Now, a seal and and a seal signifies a finished product. Amen. So, a seal cannot be put on anything that is not complete. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so this is why the prophet said the Lutheran wasn't sealed. The day of the dispensation of grace wasn't completed. They preached justification. Methodist wasn't sealed because it wasn't completed. But the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the completion of the works of God. &gt;&gt; Three works of grace. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the baptism is is the finished product of the works of God is is the completion. This why Peter said repent. Amen. Every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now he has come himself &gt;&gt; in the form of son of man. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Revealed sealing his elect. &gt;&gt; God's own life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, where is this seal being placed? We'll look here. Ezekiel 9:3. And the glory of the of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen which had the ink writer's inkorn by his side. And the Lord said unto him, "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof." Now, we know that this scripture was fulfilled. Uh this happened on on the day of Pentecost. Amen. Uh uh but it also as as the prophet says that scriptures have a double &gt;&gt; meaning. Amen. And and so like he would use the scripture out of Egypt have I called my son. Well, he did. He called the natural Jacob and and the people out, but he also called Christ out. So it was fulfilled in two ways. Amen. Well, this go through the city h the midst of the city and and and and midst of Jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads of the men. That was done on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And now it's being again done in this gentile dispensation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now the seal is being placed upon the forehead. Now a lot of people think forehead is natural. Natural forehead. &gt;&gt; Amen. A stamp on the forehead. I was listening to some uh uh uh one of the commentaries on social media the other day and he had a minister and they got talking about the end times and all these things and he says, "Well, how how's that, you know, how's that going to happen?" because uh we haven't had a stamp yet, you know, and and and and so they were talking about the natural stamp and being people being stamped. But see, the the prophet, Amen, told us it's not no tattoo. &gt;&gt; It's not some literal thing. Amen. And people think, well, you know, it's them putting a bug or one of them chips in your hand. That's not it. A lot of people are even scared about that. That's not that's not the seal. Amen. Uh uh but we find amen the prophet said foreh forehead is knowledge to understand. &gt;&gt; Everybody say knowledge &gt;&gt; to understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he puts a seal up on the forehead. Knowledge to understand. When that seal happens something happens. The the light comes on &gt;&gt; and every else everybody else walks without understanding and in darkness. So, we're sealed, amen, by the knowledge of God. See, Brother Brandon said, "Your forehead is your revelation." &gt;&gt; See, your hand is the thing you do about it. NOW, PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I GOT THE HOLY GHOST." WELL, then you're saying that that that revelation has come to you. But notice if if there's not a doing about it, if you're not doing anything about this message, if if you're just sitting there living a backsliding life, say, "Well, I got the HOLY GHOST. BLESS GOD. I BELIEVE THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET and there ain't nothing about you, Amen, that is causing you to walk away from sin, to walk away from the hate and the bitterness and and and all of the things of the world, then the ceiling ain't right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So your forehead is your revelation and your hand is the thing you do about it. It's a spiritual mark. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what did the first seal prophet says what did the first seal look like? Amen. On the day of Pentecost, he says they were filled with the Holy Ghost. That's right. Their works was the works of Christ. &gt;&gt; They were sealed and their works was the works OF CHRIST. THEY LAID hands on the sick. They recovered. They done all kinds of signs and miracles and wonders. See, and in their forehead was sealed by the revelation THAT HE WAS THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NOTHING COULD TAKE THAT AWAY from them. &gt;&gt; They were sealed. THE REVELATION WAS THERE, sealed in them, and they did the works of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, they were working with him, the deity of Christ. There's the mark. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, see, this is why people that claim to have the Holy Ghost and they're teaching uh uh trinitarian baptism, they they don't have the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because now we know what the seal is. &gt;&gt; It's the understanding. &gt;&gt; Well, well, you know, they say they got the Holy Ghost and they don't believe in Mal Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; They ain't got no understanding. So, so they can't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They're claiming to have the Holy Ghost, still ordaining women preachers, &gt;&gt; and and they can say, "I love God." They can cry and they can boohoo. They can be so dedicated and winning souls and all that. But the seal of God is in the forehead. [Music] &gt;&gt; Revelation, understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Ephesians 1:16. Now, remember, Amen. God knows who you are. When he seals you with the Holy Ghost, you're coming to know who you are. &gt;&gt; You're coming to know who he is. You're realizing you're not a sinner. Amen. But you are a super race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. See, Ephesians 1:16, Paul says, "Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory," notice, "meto the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him." In other words, may he seal you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice the sealing. The prophet said the ceiling's taken place today. John 14:8, I will not leave you comfortless. Jesus said, I will come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. I think another place says and neither knoweth him, &gt;&gt; but you see me. &gt;&gt; Because I live, YOU SHALL LIVE. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT THE QUICKENING POWER. NOW YOU HAVE THE QUICKENING POWER. And that day, prophet said, "This day, not looking for a future day, not looking at a day past. This day you shall know." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE REVELATION STRIKES YOU THAT I AM IN MY FATHER, you in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; So the seal of God, the prophet said, is being made known today. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Everybody that has it, THEIR HEARTS ARE FREE. THEY'RE SEALED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD IN THEIR FOREHEAD that they do know that Jesus is is dead and raised again because they can see him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the world doesn't see him. The world doesn't know him. But those that are sealed with the seal of God, they have an understanding of who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They know he's alive. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice uh uh Revelation 66, and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beast say, a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny. Notice, see thou hurt not the oil and the wine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oil represents the Holy Spirit, the seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wine represents revelation. &gt;&gt; They go together, &gt;&gt; can't have the seal without the revelation. &gt;&gt; Can't have the Holy Ghost without revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Remember, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he'll lead and guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; So, those who have the seal of God are forbidden to be touched. &gt;&gt; Satan can't touch them. &gt;&gt; Satan can't hurt them. &gt;&gt; Oh, he can afflict your body. HE CAN AFFLICT YOUR MIND, &gt;&gt; but he cannot touch that soul. That's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's already said, Jesus already promised, "The gates of hell SHALL NOT PREVAIL." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, they're not going through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a seal also signifies ownership. Prophet said God owns his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He owns his people. And he shows this by sealing them. So now notice, and I'm going hurry here, but he says, "The seal of God in this last day is a distinction." Everybody say distinction. &gt;&gt; A mark that'll be put upon the people. The seal of God is a distinction. &gt;&gt; See? Well, distinction is the act of perceiving someone or something as being not the same and often treating as separate or different. It's special honor or recognition. &gt;&gt; Now, I can't give you the seal. You can't give your own self the seal. You can't give me the seal. &gt;&gt; This is God. IT COMES FROM GOD. GOD HAS to give the seal. &gt;&gt; When he gives the seal, it shows he's recognized you. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I I couldn't beg for it. Couldn't plead for it. Couldn't live good enough for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people live better than me. There's a lot of people live more holier and stricter than I do &gt;&gt; than what you do. &gt;&gt; And and yet it pleased God &gt;&gt; to give us the seal. &gt;&gt; Showing this is mine. &gt;&gt; Can't touch him, devil. &gt;&gt; This is mine. Out of the millions that are headed TO TRIBULATION, THIS ONE ISN'T. So remember, God required Abraham and his seed to have the seal of circumcision. &gt;&gt; See, Abraham had believed God. How did he get the faith? God gave him the faith. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to struggle with it. God gave it to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then God gave HIM THE SEAL OF CIRCUMCISION, SHOWING THAT HE RECOGNIZED HIS FAITH. GOD RECOGNIZED HIS OWN FAITH in Abraham. &gt;&gt; So, so God required all of Abraham's seed to have this seal of circumcision. So, the the seal of circumcision was the distinction. The prophet said it was to separate them from all other people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God didn't require any other nation. No other nation had this seal of circumcision but Abraham's seed all the way through the lineage of Abraham's seed. THERE WAS A SEAL OF CIRCUMCISION AND THAT separated them from the rest. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So God today seals the believer by giving him a a a uh the Holy Ghost. And then if he has sealed you, given you the Holy Ghost, now now we know we can have it on our flesh and that don't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; And and under that having it on the flesh, there's men that drink, smoke, and committing adultery and still writing just wonderful songs, have great anointing, and they'll write songs that we sing. I know people say you don't need to sing them, but if they're anointed and they're of God, then then you you just ignore their life and take what God's put there. You say, "Well, I I don't believe that." Well, that's that's your business. But we will say this, there was the rock. You remember the world's got a little trickle of water coming out of that rock in the in the wilderness. The prophet said it wasn't no trickle of water. It was gushers of water. It had to feed two and a half million PEOPLE PLUS ALL THE LIVESTOCK. AND that water not only went to Israel, but it actually ran down and went to other nations. So the other nations lived off of this water. Amen. But that water was for Israel. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? SO, SEE, THEY CAN HAVE THIS ANOINTING upon their flesh and and they can do Christian things and and ALL THESE THINGS, BUT the seal is when he gives you the Holy Ghost down in that soul. &gt;&gt; And when he does that, if he has sealed you, then you are a finished work. It's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's over for you. Can you say amen? Not that you keep you you you you're not it's not that you don't keep working doesn't mean that you you don't keep pressing but but your days of struggle is over. Amen. Your days of wondering if you're if you're there, if you're not, it's over. It's just something that starts to settle down inside of you. Brother Brown said, "You who are born again, God put your name on the lamb's book of life." Amen. Christ died and sent the Holy Ghost here to call you to eternal life. You have RECEIVED IT. HE SEALED YOU. NOW YOU'RE there till the day of your redemption. Oh, Satan might try to get you to wonder if you're saved and he'll try to all this, but there's something solid down inside of you. It's the revelation. I know who I am. I know I'm on my way. I know I am saved. I know I'm I'm Well, WHAT IS IT? THE SEAL WORKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? Yes. &gt;&gt; So he says if you're a believer and believe on the Lord, he's recognized you and he's recognized your faith by giving you the seal of his promise, the Holy Ghost. Notice, then you have the assurance, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; of being with him in glory forever. &gt;&gt; Now, he knows you're going to be there. Now, he gives us that seal. Now, we know we're going to be there. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost isn't just some emotion. That's a sensation that one gets. &gt;&gt; It's not a good feeling or a religious feeling that comes over a person. It's a it's a seal. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm I'm rushing here now. In in the early days, a seal was also a signature. like like in the Romans and and even in the Jews and in the older days, there's some people that did not know how to write their name or or I think even maybe kings and royalty would use a seal instead of their signature. If they were going to write an article or whatever, instead of writing their signature like we do at the bottom to show that it's us, then they would use a seal. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it would be a ring &gt;&gt; or it would be, you know, something that would be on the back of their wrist or or like that. I don't know. But anyway, it' be something on their on the wrist or a ring, but it would have their seal on it instead of their signature. So, the seal acted as the name. The seal was the name, &gt;&gt; right? THE SEAL WAS A BONAFIDEED statement &gt;&gt; that it was good as the man's signature. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it was a capital fine uh for anyone who would try to copy that. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said, "Now listen you Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, don't try to copy it. &gt;&gt; It's a seal." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hold still and God will put it on you. Then you'll be an inside example of Christianity and manhood and womanhood. The seal of the HOLY SPIRIT, GOD'S IN sign pressed into you till you look, act, walk, talk the gospel everywhere you go and no finger can be put on you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? So notice the name, this is the prophet speaking it. The name of Jesus Christ is the seal. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SEALS YOU, HE PUTS HIS NAME TO IT. &gt;&gt; Now look, look, let's look at some scriptures. Revelation 7:2. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads." Of course, these servants are the Jews, right? The the 144,000. If you read on the fourth verse, I think and fifth. Amen. Uh uh John heard the number of them that were sealed and it equaled up to 144,000. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that the prophet said they are sealed WITH THE SAME SEAL THAT YOU AND I AS THE GENTILES ARE SEALED WITH. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Now notice they're sealed in their forehead. Revelations 14:1. And I looked and lo, a lamb stood on the mount Zion with him and 144,000 having his father's name &gt;&gt; written in their foreheads. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Revelations 22:4. And they shall see his face and his name. &gt;&gt; His seal &gt;&gt; shall be in their foreheads. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And his name is called the word of God." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; The revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. So now notice the prophet said he Jesus Christ his name is called the word of God. He Jesus Christ was the word made flesh when he dwelt upon the earth. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now his name is upon our forehead. Meaning the word is now made flesh &gt;&gt; in his church &gt;&gt; dwelling among us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One place, Brother Bram said, the word of God, his name was the word of God. The word made manifest. &gt;&gt; So, not just coming in church and learning something like a a school or a seminary and we're getting educated, intellectual learning. That ain't it. &gt;&gt; It ain't even about coming in here and listening to the message and ALL THAT. THAT'S FINE. BUT NOW, we come AND WE GO OUT THEM DOORS AND WE BEGAN to live the message. The word becomes manifest. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his signature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "If you abide in me and my words abide in you," what is that? The prophet said, "It's God made flesh again. &gt;&gt; You ask what you will and it shall be done for you." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So what is it? It's the Holy Ghost coming in the person and quickening the word of God to him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Prophet says when he goes to the Jews, when God goes to the Jews and and he seals them, that's when they'll be sealed, right after the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says the spirit of Elijah off of this gentile church will just continue right on into that Jewish church. go right on in and call Moses with him. Hallelujah. You see it? He'll preach the same message of Pentecost to those Jews. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll preach the same message you're hearing. &gt;&gt; That message that you're playing on the tapes and you're listening to the seals don't have to be open for them. It's already open unto us. THEY'LL RECEIVE the message that you're receiving &gt;&gt; and THEY'LL BE SEALED BY IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Under that, they'll recognize their Messiah. &gt;&gt; They'll recognize their true atonement. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, we know that there's another group of people who are receiving the mark of the beast. Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 13:11, I beheld another beast coming out out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 16th verse, and he caus all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond. See, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads, and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. See, and so if the musicians, they can come on up. But the Bible says that in the beginning, God set a mark upon Cain. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; After and we know what Cain who Cain was. He was a the son of Satan. &gt;&gt; He was of that serpent seed. The Bible says Satan, the serpent, had a seed. &gt;&gt; Cain was that seed. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And God set a mark upon him that no man would kill him if they found him. Now God separated Cain BY PUTTING A MARK on him &gt;&gt; and then sent him out from the presence of the Lord. And the prophet said that is what the mark of the beast is. &gt;&gt; A man cannot come back into the presence of God once that mark is upon him. And he says, "The mark of the beast is the wayward, the outcast that refused to take and come God's provided way." &gt;&gt; Cain, as soon as he was marked, was sent away. Can sit in church, never feel the presence of God again, never be convicted again. Never. Never. This is why you can't play around with God. You can't not play around with things. You either get right or you just it it'd be better you just go out and live a sinful life. Live a sinner's life instead of trying to bring it into the church and and and and live in in a lukewarm state. &gt;&gt; So it it this is why the prophet would say well the prophet said it's now come I think in the identified Christ of all ages. He come to the point he said now there's only one thing left and he told the people there's only one thing left that can happen. He was talking about the revealing of the son of man. He said and that is for the people to be mar or receive the seal of god or to be marked &gt;&gt; with the mark of the beast. That's what's happening in this age. &gt;&gt; So he says this is the age of the turning time. It's a time when men are either will either come into the kingdom of god and be or be sealed out of the kingdom of god. &gt;&gt; No no no in between. No playing, no playing church. It's either we're we're coming in to be sealed in or we'll be sealed out. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Also, the mark showed that God had something against Cain. Rebraham said, "You never heard someone say, "Well, you got one seal against you." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's always you got one mark against you." Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got you got you got a mark against you. &gt;&gt; And where's that mark being placed? The right hand, the forehead. Speaking of knowledge or deed, &gt;&gt; receiving the doctrines and putting it into action. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; When John saw the great he saw that she had a mark upon her forehead. Brother Brandham identified it as the Catholic Church. There was a mark upon her forehead. Revelation 17:5, "And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth." Can you say amen? See, so then once a man receives the Holy Ghost, he can not be lost. It's an assurance. &gt;&gt; Proble said God wouldn't give a man the Holy Spirit if he knew he was going to lose him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, Judas, Amen. THAT'S WHERE HE STOPPED AT. He He He He cast out devils. He worked all kinds of miracles. He had an office in the church. He was set under Jesus's ministry. HE PARTTOOK OF IT ALL, BUT HE STOPPED SHORT of receiving the Holy Ghost getting sealed. &gt;&gt; And at the end, he was lost. The prophet said he came in as a believer being a devil from the beginning. He was born the son of predition. He pulled nothing over on Jesus because he knowed him from the very beginning for he was the word. Can you say amen? SO THEN HE GIVES THE HOLY GHOST TO those who he has gone on to prepare a place. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And the prophet said the Holy Spirit here itself is a seal. Seal signifies finished work. The Holy Spirit being a seal to the individual and to that individual. When he receives the Holy Spirit, then his time of groaning is over because it's a finished work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about it. Then you can rejoice in your trial. You can rejoice when you fall. You can rejoice. Get back up and press the battle. Can you say amen? Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What song? [Music] Oh, I want to thank you, Lord. [Music] Oh, thank you, Lord, [Music] for making me whole. Oh, thank you, Lord, for giving to me. Oh, thy great salvation so rich. Shall we sing it again? I want to thank. Thank you, Lord. Are you thankful tonight? [Music] Thankful that you're one of his. Thankful that God put his signature upon you. Bless the name of the Lord. Blessed are your eyes for they see. Blessed are your ears for they hear. Oh thy great salvation so full and free. Once again I want to thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you, Lord, for making me whole. I want to thank you, Lord, for giving to me. Oh, thy great salvation [Music] so rich and free. [Music] Let the death angel pass [Music] God's bride safe at last. [Music] It's the token he gave [Music] that we might be saved. [Music] Oh, hallelu. Glory to God. The blood's been applied. His spirit now abides. Let the death angel pass. Sing that again. Oh, let the death angel pass. Glory to God. The bride's safe at last. It's the token he gave that we might be saved. [Music] And oh hallelu, [Music] glory to God. The blood's been applied. Spirit abides. Let the death angel pass. What is that verse? The Lord talked to Moses, [Music] told him what to say to the children of Israel [Music] in Goan that day. [Music] Oh, slay the lamb. [Music] Amen. Amen. For I'll pass through Egypt this night and smite all the firstborn. But we say, "Let the death angel pass. No fear, no worry. By God's grace, I'm safe at last. I've got the token he gave. Oh, that I might be saved. And oh hallelu, [Music] glory to God. [Music] The blood's been applied. His spirit abides. Let the death angel pass. Second verse. Thou the sweet Holy Spirit [Music] is the token, the seal today. [Music] and all that are under it, God said would be saved. [Music] Anything outside of this token, [Music] the lost will be found. [Music] If you want your loved ones saved, you better get them in now. [Music] Oh, let the death angel pass. [Music] God's bride safe at last. She's got the token he gave [Music] that she might be saved. Oh, hallelu. [Music] Glory to God. [Music] The brine blood's been applied. Your spirit abides, let the death angel pass. Now, as they just place softly, when God seals a person, then that person should never look back in the past, they should look to the future. &gt;&gt; That's right. If if God had such a revelation, a knowledge of us being there that that even before we come to earth, he makes this promise. I go to prepare a place for you. He's looking in the future. He's not looking at our mistakes. He's not looking at the earth, our natural birth. He's not looking at our our life or anything. He's looking at that predestinated seed. And he said, "Now I'm going to go prepare a place for you." Now that seal has been upon our forehead. The revelation has come. Let's look to the future. &gt;&gt; I'm going. He's got a place prepared for me. This is why Paul would say, "As as soon as this earthly body is is dissolved, we've got a place waiting. We've got another one that's waiting for us." Can you say amen? That's how assured we are. God bless you. love you. Thank you for your patience and listening. Amen. You know, Brother Brandham, I'm going to read this quote. Brother Brandham said, "If you're looking here at what's going on now, you'll certainly run off the board. But if you just keep your eye on the end and hold steady and just keep watching the end, you won't get so nervous. Oh, how's this going to be and how's that going to be?" Just keep it to the end. everything else will work out. Can you say amen? God bless you. Amen. We'll be praying for you and uh uh ask that you'd pray for for me and the other brothers that'll be ministering. Amen. And u we can be a blessing and uh to the people there in South Carolina. and love you and uh brother Daniel and brother Judah be heading to Arkansas uh think Saturday or Missouri uh Saturday and so ask that you'd keep them in prayer as well. God will keep them safe and bring them home safely. Amen. And so u may y'all have a wonderful evening. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Amen. Um, brother Bill, do you want to dismiss us in prayer? [Music]
