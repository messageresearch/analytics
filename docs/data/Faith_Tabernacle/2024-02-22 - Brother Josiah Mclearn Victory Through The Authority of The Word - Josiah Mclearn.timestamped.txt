[35:27] fullness they Their Eyes Were veiled
[35:30] were veiled were veiled were veiled to
[35:32] it but but but yet but yet uh but but
[35:36] but but yet but yet he would always but
[35:37] yet he would always re re re re reveal
[35:40] himself in his way and and in his time
[35:42] and Jesus and Jesus thanked the father
[35:44] he said he said he that he had hid these
[35:46] things from the wise and The Prudent and
[35:49] and would reveal it unto babes such such
[35:51] as as as as would learn so we find that
[35:55] God that God that God that God in his
[35:57] nature never changes from from age to
[36:00] age it's always has has has remained the
[36:02] same God's nature has has always has
[36:05] always stayed exactly the same and and
[36:08] Malachi 3 he says he says he says I am
[36:11] God and I change not so so he works in
[36:13] the same principles in the same way in
[36:15] the same way in the same way throughout
[36:18] time and but but but but but but but but
[36:21] but yet um brother bandom said said said
[36:25] that and and he was talking of Jesus
[36:26] said said he could not have come he
[36:28] could not have come with with with with
[36:29] Moses's message because because it it
[36:32] would it wouldn't have worked Moses was
[36:34] God Moses was God in a portion made
[36:37] manifest he was the word expressed for
[36:40] that hour but Jesus could not could not
[36:43] could not come in that but the the Bible
[36:45] said the Bible say never said never said
[36:48] he would come he would come in in that
[36:50] way but but but but but when he come
[36:53] when he come Express exactly exactly the
[36:58] the the way the Testament had said that
[37:01] that that he would be expressed then all
[37:04] those then all those who was redeemable
[37:08] believed it because because because
[37:10] because they because they were the
[37:11] thoughts of God the attributes of him at
[37:14] the beginning was made flesh and
[37:16] redeemable and was brought back to God
[37:19] and and the Bible says as many as
[37:21] received him to them gave he power to
[37:23] become the sons of God because they were
[37:26] redeemable they they were from the
[37:28] beginning in the expression
[37:31] and and he says and he says and he says
[37:34] if we could stop here a moment if it
[37:35] would be possible and think that tonight
[37:37] of the message of the hour the expressed
[37:39] thoughts of Jehovah before the
[37:41] foundation of the world we are told our
[37:43] names were put in the Lamb's Book of
[37:45] Life so we are we are the literal
[37:48] expressed thoughts of God we are the
[37:50] bride of Christ we are his literally his
[37:53] expressed thoughts made manifest in
[37:56] these last days we we have become we so
[38:00] and so we are the fullness of God that
[38:02] has been unveiled in these last days um
[38:05] um um you look at look you look at at
[38:07] Luther and and and in his time he had he
[38:10] had a portion of it and John Wesley he
[38:12] had a portion of it in the the
[38:14] Pentecostal that that that they they
[38:17] they they they they had a portion of it
[38:20] um ausa Street had had a portion of the
[38:22] Holy Ghost and Pentecostals they they
[38:24] had a portion of of of
[38:28] of of of the Holy Ghost but we as the
[38:31] bride of Christ Christ Christ today can
[38:33] stand here and the full manifestation
[38:36] and and the full expression of what
[38:39] God's of what God had in the back of his
[38:41] mind mind since the since before the
[38:43] world was ever formed we can now stand
[38:45] here here here as the fully manifested
[38:47] son and daughter of God why and um um
[38:51] and and and you look at at at at at John
[38:54] the Baptist he he he was the voice of of
[38:56] of the of one crying in the wilderness
[38:58] he he tried to tell them that that that
[39:00] and but yet he was also he was also Mal
[39:04] Mal Malachi
[39:06] Malachi 3 where where where it said
[39:09] behold I send my messenger from from
[39:13] from before my my my face prepare
[39:15] prepare the way before the people
[39:18] brother bam said said that said said
[39:21] said said that John the Baptist he he
[39:23] said he was that Living Word a and and
[39:27] and and the true and the and and the
[39:29] true born again again again Church
[39:31] Church of the of the Living God in in
[39:33] this hour and and and in this day is the
[39:36] living is the living is the Living Word
[39:39] of God of of God in these last days it
[39:43] we are we have been been we have been
[39:45] made we have been made made made
[39:48] manifested fested and so so if we if you
[39:52] search the scriptures and look out and
[39:54] look and look and look and look
[39:57] throughout history we we we we can see
[40:00] what's supposed to be in these last days
[40:02] in these last age and in this leoty and
[40:03] age we see that the world that's falling
[40:05] apart and and we see Satan he's on the
[40:07] Rampage everywhere but yet but but but
[40:10] yet through it all there's a bride and
[40:12] she standing forth as the expressed
[40:14] image of God there's Christ Living again
[40:17] and and and he's just just changed his M
[40:20] from from one
[40:21] form on onto the other and all that God
[40:25] was he has poured into Christ and all
[40:27] that Christ was he has poured into his
[40:29] his his his his his his his
[40:32] church and and while standing on on on
[40:36] that rock Moses Moses he he was standing
[40:38] there he he said Lord I want to see you
[40:41] and and and God told him he he said
[40:44] stand on the rock over there when he
[40:45] stood there stood there stood there he
[40:49] he saw the back part of a
[40:51] man walk walk by but but but but but but
[40:55] but yet but but but yet that wasn't God
[40:57] he himself he he it was a it was a veil
[41:01] of God as brother random said it the the
[41:04] Bible said no man no man hath seen God
[41:06] at any time but the only begotten of the
[41:09] father hath declared him so so so so so
[41:12] Moses saw him veiled as a man man man
[41:16] man and we find that and we find that
[41:18] that that Jehovah that Jehovah of the
[41:20] Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the
[41:22] New Testament and
[41:25] and his brother B has has has has taught
[41:29] us it's the changing it's the changing
[41:31] it's the changing from form to form it
[41:34] it's called it's called that inm
[41:36] morpha and and and what the what that
[41:39] what that what that what that word inm
[41:41] morpha means it means it's the Unseen
[41:45] was made visible and and and something
[41:47] that that that that that that that that
[41:51] that as brother Ram said that we know
[41:52] what's there but but but we just can't
[41:57] can't but but we just can't can't see it
[42:00] but but but but yet all the time all the
[42:01] time we we we we we know it's there but
[42:06] but yet but yet but yet when when God
[42:10] came down and lifted that Veil it was
[42:11] that it was that it was that it was that
[42:14] it was that
[42:15] imor and and and he changed that that
[42:18] that that that that that form now and
[42:20] then and then there we' seen Jesus
[42:22] Christ standing there when all
[42:24] throughout all throughout the history
[42:25] the prophet had longed to see him men
[42:27] and women of throughout the Bible had
[42:31] longed to see Christ but but but but but
[42:33] yet God came and changed changed he his
[42:36] Veil and and he stood there as the
[42:39] expressed image of God In the Flesh it
[42:42] was in morphy the Unseen was made
[42:45] visible
[42:46] why and and all he did was was was was
[42:50] he just changed his mask and and in
[42:52] other words in other words like they do
[42:54] in those plays where where where where
[42:57] where um um in those school plays or
[42:59] something where where one guy might play
[43:01] five five five parts it's the same man
[43:04] but he's going behind the veil and he's
[43:06] changing his mask and coming back out as
[43:07] a as a as a different person and and
[43:10] that's and that's exactly what God did
[43:12] it's the same God all the time he has
[43:15] not he has not changed he's the same man
[43:17] he's the are are the same God God God
[43:20] he's the same God since the beginning of
[43:24] time but he he was in the of the father
[43:27] he was he was in the form he he was in
[43:29] the form of the pillar of fire and he
[43:31] was he was in the he was in the he he
[43:36] was in the form of Christ but it's the
[43:38] same God but but but God has just
[43:39] changed his mask and uh I I'm laying a
[43:43] foundation here so so you guys will just
[43:45] have to bear with me for a little bit
[43:47] but but but but but but just like an
[43:51] artist he'll He he'll he'll sit there
[43:52] and Veil his painting and and nobody can
[43:55] can see it you can't see it they or or
[43:59] or sculpture where where where they're
[44:01] they might see a vague form of something
[44:03] but it's but it's being shaped and it's
[44:05] being molded but but yet nobody knows
[44:07] nobody knows what this thing what this
[44:09] thing what this thing looks like until
[44:12] the day until the day o o of the
[44:15] revealing where where that where that
[44:18] sculpture can step back and take the
[44:20] Veil Down and they see the Masterpiece

[44:32] has been removed from the people's eyes
[44:33] and then now had the full
[44:35] revelation of of of of what the master
[44:38] builder Builder has been doing has been
[44:40] doing for years and years and years why
[44:42] why it's and brother bam say said said
[44:46] said said that he was God in morphe
[44:49] master in the pillar of fire god in
[44:51] morphe and a man called called called
[44:54] and a man called called Jesus God in and
[44:58] morphe in his church God above us God
[45:01] With Us God in us the condescending of
[45:03] God he he said he said he said he said
[45:07] up there no um up there talking about
[45:10] the mountain he he said nothing could
[45:12] could could ever touch it and even if an
[45:13] animal touched the mountain it had to
[45:15] die but then God came down and changed
[45:17] his tent and come down and and and and
[45:21] lived with us became became one of us
[45:24] and we and we and we held him the um the
[45:27] Bible says in 1 Timothy 3:16 it it says
[45:31] it say it says it says without without
[45:33] without controversy great is the mystery
[45:36] is the mystery of of godliness for God
[45:39] was manifested in the flesh handled with
[45:41] hands God eat meat God drank water God

[45:52] God God he he said that was God above us
[45:54] God With Us now it's God in us the Holy
[45:57] Spirit not the third person but the same
[46:01] spirit is now in The Bride of Jesus
[46:05] Christ but but but but but but but but
[46:09] yet but yet but yet um we can look
[46:11] around around today and and we see that
[46:15] to most of the world it's still veiled
[46:17] it it it's it's it's the the um
[46:21] unbeliever cannot see it it's it's it's
[46:24] it's the no matter no no
[46:29] matter no matter no matter no matter
[46:32] what what we do it seems like sometimes
[46:34] you can take them right up there up
[46:36] there too I was talking to to one of my
[46:38] co-workers the other day he he's a
[46:40] southern baptist I was talking to him
[46:41] about the message and he kind of looked
[46:43] at me with this with this like like like
[46:45] like you're dumb you know because but
[46:47] but but but but see to his eyes it's
[46:49] bailed he cannot see it no matter what I
[46:51] do to show him I'll show him in the
[46:52] scripture he cannot he cannot he cannot
[46:55] see see
[46:56] it but but but but but it's not it's not
[46:59] for the unbeliever it's for the believer
[47:03] only it's it's it's it's it's but but
[47:06] God always veils himself from the unbel
[47:10] on on on on on on to from the on on on
[47:15] we we we we find that um um Traditions
[47:19] will hide it and and and people
[47:21] denomination ideas idea ideas ideas will
[47:25] will will will will will will hide it
[47:28] and all these all these isms of the
[47:30] world of the world will will will hide

[47:37] she's standing there and all and all the
[47:39] glory
[47:41] of of of God she's standing there as as
[47:46] an unveiled Masterpiece in these last
[47:48] days Lord where where brother brandom

[48:17] and Moses made it plain he said he he he
[48:20] say he he said the Commandment says this
[48:23] and this is why he made it plain
[48:26] and before it was made plain it was
[48:28] veiled and so it is and so it is is is
[48:31] today veiled to to the people until it's
[48:34] revealed and made plain to the people

[1:00:08] cast in the sea you can doubt not and
[1:00:10] claim it why because it's our promise
[1:00:14] God had made a
[1:00:15] promise when when when God told told
[1:00:18] told told told when God told when God
[1:00:22] told Abraham what what what what what
[1:00:25] what what when God told Abraham what
[1:00:29] what he he he would do do he he he he he
[1:00:34] he he he he took this soath and he swore
[1:00:37] by himself because there was no no no
[1:00:39] one one one one there was no one greater
[1:00:42] so God
[1:00:44] literally swore by himself and and he
[1:00:46] made a promise he made an unconditional
[1:00:48] Covenant to the supernatural Seed of
[1:00:50] Abraham and and and and all that was in
[1:00:53] and and in that pillar pillar of fire
[1:00:56] fire of fire wasn't was in was in was in
[1:01:00] Christ Christ CH Christ was in Christ
[1:01:03] Jesus for for and brother Rand says said
[1:01:07] the the Bible said that God emptied he
[1:01:09] said he said he said he said you know
[1:01:11] what what you do what you do when you
[1:01:13] empty anything he emptied himself in
[1:01:15] into Christ just think God emptied
[1:01:18] himself in himself just think God
[1:01:21] emptied himself in into Christ and
[1:01:24] Christ thought it not robbery to be
[1:01:26] equal with God for he was God and and
[1:01:30] and that's the thing that that that that
[1:01:32] that that's the thing that that they
[1:01:33] killed him for for for for breaking for
[1:01:35] breaking the Sabbath day and making
[1:01:37] himself God and he was Lord of the
[1:01:39] Sabbath and he was God Emanuel God in
[1:01:42] Christ reconciling the world the world
[1:01:46] the world the world the world the world
[1:01:49] to himself now and everything that God
[1:01:51] was he emptied it
[1:01:55] he emptied into Christ and everything
[1:01:57] Christ was he emptied in in in in in
[1:02:01] into to the church so you don't see so
[1:02:04] don't you see how how Christ regardless
[1:02:06] of of of of what the of what the
[1:02:08] Theologian said he believed the father
[1:02:10] is that right they said he's crazy he's
[1:02:13] he he he's be above he's the devil and
[1:02:16] and he said and he he said you can get
[1:02:18] by with that now but when the Holy Ghost
[1:02:20] comes don't you try it for Christ
[1:02:22] believed the father regardless of what
[1:02:24] the teacher said he believed the father
[1:02:26] is that right for God had emptied
[1:02:29] himself himself himself himself in
[1:02:33] himself into Christ and deity was in
[1:02:36] Christ he said Woo I hope you get it and
[1:02:39] then what Christ was he emptied into
[1:02:41] that in he emptied in in into the into
[1:02:45] the into the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost
[1:02:50] believer so no matter what so no matter
[1:02:52] what what a
[1:02:54] a no matter what anybody says he
[1:02:57] believed God's word see see he has to
[1:03:00] for all that Christ was all God was all
[1:03:04] that God was was in Christ all that
[1:03:06] Christ is is in you the believer Christ
[1:03:09] can't say say Christ cannot say
[1:03:13] something and stand around and and deny
[1:03:17] it he can't take his his his his his his
[1:03:20] his word back he he he he said he he's
[1:03:22] got to stick with what he says oh he's
[1:03:25] God and the infallible and he's got to
[1:03:27] stay with what he says we have the
[1:03:29] Eternal thoughts of God now that's it's
[1:03:32] now been revealed to to the bride of
[1:03:34] Christ through the prophets and and
[1:03:37] these last days brother bam said said he
[1:03:41] said said said so God in the beginning
[1:03:43] was life was life the Eternal one in him
[1:03:47] in him was was was attributes and those
[1:03:50] attributes became words and those words
[1:03:52] are and word and and the the word became
[1:03:54] flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to
[1:03:57] redeem means to bring back and if he has
[1:03:59] to bring it back it has to be somewhere
[1:04:01] to be brought back to he said so you see
[1:04:04] all people will never will never be able
[1:04:07] to see it because all people wasn't in
[1:04:09] the beginning of God's thoughts see he
[1:04:11] said he he said I'm an heir of all

[1:14:14] he might he might hook you up to an
[1:14:15] x-ray machine or or or or or or or a
[1:14:18] C-section or not C-section but a CAT
[1:14:20] scan SK machine whatever whatever
[1:14:22] whatever it may
[1:14:23] and and he begins he begins to look
[1:14:25] around and he sees the
[1:14:28] problem and he sat there and says you've
[1:14:31] got ulcers and he says you've got you've
[1:14:33] got this you've got that and you don't
[1:14:35] ever you don't ever question
[1:14:36] it what he says you just say oh I do
[1:14:39] okay well well then well then he begins
[1:14:41] to out out some
[1:14:44] medicine and then he gives you a bottle
[1:14:46] of pills and says take these twice a day
[1:14:49] and two weeks it it'll be gone now I
[1:14:52] don't know about you but I but but I'm
[1:14:54] not a pharmacist I have no idea what's
[1:14:55] in those pills all I do is I just says
[1:14:57] it says where it says reads reads reads
[1:15:00] reads reads reads to take to take to
[1:15:02] take to take to take twice
[1:15:05] twice twice a day and it's once in the
[1:15:07] morning and once in night you just take
[1:15:09] it and before you know it your Pain's
[1:15:11] gone your symptoms gone why because why
[1:15:14] why because we have faith in what the
[1:15:15] doctor has has has has has has has told
[1:15:19] us and yet yet in these last days when
[1:15:23] all this world is stumbling around in
[1:15:24] darkness and don't know what's up and
[1:15:26] what's down they're so confused they
[1:15:28] don't know who to trust they they don't
[1:15:29] know they don't know what's going on we
[1:15:31] have an anchor an anchor in the soul and
[1:15:33] God has laid it out has has has has laid
[1:15:37] these things out in this message in
[1:15:38] these last days and he and he told us
[1:15:40] and he's told us by his stripes we are
[1:15:43] healed we can sat there and say and say
[1:15:45] by his stripes I am healed we don't
[1:15:47] question it we don't set to wonder if
[1:15:50] it's going to work we have the chief
[1:15:51] doctors doctors and and he's written out
[1:15:53] a prescription for us we just walk out
[1:15:55] there and start our truck up why because
[1:15:57] we don't have to question anything
[1:16:00] anything we can just take it and claim
[1:16:02] it because why because he has he has he
[1:16:05] he has proven himself Time After Time
[1:16:08] After Time After Time to us we don't
[1:16:10] ever have to sit there and question well
[1:16:11] is is God is God a Healer or is he not
[1:16:14] we we know he is we've seen him move
[1:16:15] we've seen him do it thousands and
[1:16:17] thousands of
[1:16:19] times in our lives he has more than than
[1:16:22] than Vindicated himself himself
[1:16:26] himself himself himself to us that's why
[1:16:29] it blows my mind when when people
[1:16:31] constantly question question the prophet
[1:16:33] of God they constantly sat there and say
[1:16:35] well he missed it here or he missed it
[1:16:36] there it's like my goodness that has
[1:16:38] been Vindicated over and over and over
[1:16:41] and and yet we have the audacity to set
[1:16:43] them a question if brother random told
[1:16:44] us not to have a pink Rock in my yard
[1:16:46] yard yard I want to have a pink have a
[1:16:49] pink Rock in my yard do I understand it
[1:16:51] nope I have no idea I have no idea but
[1:16:53] but if brother Bram said not to do it
[1:16:55] we're not going to do it why because the
[1:16:57] doctor has been Vindicated to us over
[1:17:00] and over and
[1:17:03] over and yet and yet people still sat
[1:17:06] there and question him and and
[1:17:08] questioning whether he was right here or
[1:17:10] or or or not or whether he was just he
[1:17:12] wasn't he wasn't anointed here or there
[1:17:14] and and and yet we can we have we have
[1:17:18] we have the Vindication
[1:17:22] of
[1:17:24] of his his his his ministry time and
[1:17:27] time again that Pillar of Fire setting
[1:17:29] right there is a Vindication to us that
[1:17:31] we should never have to question ever
[1:17:33] ever to
[1:17:34] us ever ever ever ever to us but and yet
[1:17:38] we as a bride of Christ we can we can
[1:17:40] sit there and take the doctor and and
[1:17:42] take and take the prescription and say
[1:17:44] and say by his stripes I am healed and
[1:17:47] through faith I shall
[1:17:49] overcome we can we can be so burdened
[1:17:52] down
[1:17:54] so burdened down
[1:17:55] so we can be so so burdened down with
[1:17:58] with with with with sin and with burdens
[1:18:00] in our lives till we feel so dirty and

[1:18:17] again we might have tried every single
[1:18:20] remedy that that that that we know of
[1:18:23] and all we have to do is come to Dr
[1:18:26] Jesus and all we have to do is say and
[1:18:27] say Lord I need you
[1:18:30] tonight and and yet he will set there
