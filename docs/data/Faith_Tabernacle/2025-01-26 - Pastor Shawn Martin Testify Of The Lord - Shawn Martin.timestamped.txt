[48:53] looking forward to that and um so uh
[48:58] thankful that the Lord is um with them
[49:01] and helping a little
[49:03] man there through this trial and um uh
[49:09] just believing everything going to be
[49:10] all right and he's going to continue to
[49:14] uh to get better amen and um he was
[49:18] pretty dehydrated when they got there to
[49:21] the hospital and but uh doing doing good
[49:24] and so we thankful to the Lord for for
[49:27] that amen and uh but the book of Psalms
[49:34] 145 and we want to start at the eth
[49:39] verse it says the Lord is gracious and
[49:42] full of
[49:43] compassion slow to anger and of great
[49:47] Mercy the Lord is good to all and his
[49:51] Tender Mercies are over all his works
[49:55] all thy Works shall praise thee Oh Lord
[49:58] and thy Saints shall bless thee they
[50:01] shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom
[50:05] and talk of thy power to make known to
[50:10] the sons of men his mighty acts and the
[50:13] Glorious
[50:15] Majesty of his kingdom praise the Lord
[50:19] you can have your seats this
[50:21] morning and I'm also going to turn to
[50:25] First Peter which
[50:27] we uh know
[50:30] um but 1 Peter 2
[50:34] and9 but it says but you are a chosen
[50:39] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[50:43] nation A peculiar people that you should
[50:46] show forth the Praises of him who ha
[50:49] called you out of
[50:51] Darkness Into His Marvelous
[50:54] Light which in time pass were not a
[50:57] people but are now the people of God
[51:00] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[51:02] have obtained Mercy praise the
[51:07] Lord if I would uh use a title it uh
[51:11] maybe it would be testify of the
[51:15] Lord and U we don't um necessarily I
[51:19] guess talk of this word testify too
[51:23] much and um but uh I do believe in in
[51:29] testifying and uh we should all have a
[51:33] testimony and um uh we do use talk of
[51:37] the word
[51:39] confession and uh which is the same as
[51:45] testifying um and so it is it is
[51:48] important that we as Believers
[51:52] testify uh of and uh we know that that's
[51:57] how we overcome the devil for that's
[52:00] that's what the Bible says there in
[52:02] Revelations
[52:03] 1211 says they overcame him by the blood
[52:06] of the lamb and by the word of their
[52:11] testimony and so brother Bram said this
[52:14] is why we love to
[52:15] testify because we overcome the devil
[52:19] when we when we give testimony and uh so
[52:24] I I thank God for the the blood of the
[52:27] Lamb how many glad for the
[52:30] blood but I'm also glad that I have a
[52:34] testimony Amen to share because I I
[52:38] couldn't overcome without it and um so
[52:43] brother Bram says well what is their
[52:46] testimony he said Jesus Lives that's our
[52:49] testimony is Jesus Lives we're not
[52:53] talking testifying of what was yesterday
[52:57] and and the days gone by but we're
[53:01] testifying of a living God that he has
[53:03] risen and that he is alive uh forever
[53:08] more and brother brandham also called it
[53:10] the word of testimony to Jesus Christ
[53:14] amen and so uh uh our testimony uh is to
[53:20] Jesus Christ so to testify is to give a
[53:25] testimony and and um I I looked up that
[53:29] word testimony is is the
[53:32] evidence giving given from what has been
[53:36] witnessed amen so that that's that's you
[53:40] you won't have a testimony if if you
[53:43] don't have if you haven't witnessed
[53:45] because the testimony is the evidence of
[53:49] what you have
[53:50] witnessed it's it's a personal uh uh a
[53:54] personal thing and so the word testimony
[53:58] has the same meaning as the word
[54:00] testify uh uh and testify means to make
[54:04] a solemn
[54:06] declaration amen uh verbal or written to
[54:10] establish some fact to give testimony
[54:14] for the purpose of communicating to
[54:16] others a knowledge of something not
[54:19] known to them so so this is this is our
[54:25] testimony is establishing a fact amen
[54:30] we've witnessed something amen and we're
[54:33] going to declare it and establish it to
[54:36] people who don't know can you say amen
[54:41] and and and how we need testimonies in
[54:44] this age amen uh when we have so much
[54:48] contradiction of the word when we have
[54:50] so much unbelief so much skepticism and
[54:54] so much of of of other voices amen and
[54:59] so uh testify is also in judicial
[55:04] proceedings to make a solemn declaration
[55:07] under
[55:09] oath for the purpose of establishing or
[55:14] making proof of some ACT to a
[55:18] court uh to Bear witness to to support
[55:21] the truth of by testimony amen
[55:26] and and I'm I'm I'm glad that God gave
[55:30] us a testimony that we can bear witness
[55:33] of the truth amen and so to testify is
[55:37] to Bear witness amen it's like brother
[55:40] Bram said when you go to a trial to be a
[55:42] witness well you're testifying for
[55:45] somebody now now you know uh we we could
[55:49] say the world is the court and and and
[55:53] and the people is the the jury and and
[55:57] they're going to decide uh what we
[56:00] testify about can you say amen and and
[56:04] we've got you know we we've got all
[56:06] kinds of uh people uh bearing witness of
[56:10] of other things but God wants a people
[56:13] to Bear witness of him in the age that
[56:16] we're living in and so again before you
[56:20] could
[56:22] testify uh be before they would call you
[56:24] to testify well
[56:26] they they would want you to to
[56:29] experience you you you you had to have
[56:32] an experience you you must know
[56:35] something before you can testify in the
[56:38] court of the law uh they're they're not
[56:40] just going to go get somebody off the
[56:41] street and say would you be willing to
[56:42] testify you know no no they want someone
[56:45] that was involved they want someone that
[56:47] witnessed they want someone that saw
[56:50] something heard something and and and
[56:53] and these things and so uh
[56:57] the prophet said a witness is a person
[56:59] who has seen something that knows that
[57:02] it is the truth they know they're not
[57:04] guessing it's the truth they're they're
[57:06] not going he said she said and and I
[57:09] don't know but I'll I'll give it my best
[57:11] shot but they know that this is the
[57:14] truth see and and they know it's the
[57:17] truth and they're called to give witness
[57:20] and and then a witness must know what
[57:23] he's talking about he must not well
[57:26] someone told me a certain thing see he
[57:29] must be the witness himself if not then
[57:32] he's speaking of someone else that could
[57:34] be a witness at the scene ain't that
[57:37] right so
[57:40] testifying is not just rambling of words
[57:43] you know getting up there you know uh uh
[57:46] well would you testify for you know Jim
[57:49] Bob yeah I'll give a testimony you know
[57:51] and get up there say well I went fishing
[57:53] yesterday with with Scott and and boy we
[57:56] not a big one you know well that's not
[57:58] testifying amen uh you got to testify
[58:01] what the trial is about what the subject
[58:04] is and and and who's ever on uh uh uh
[58:08] needing you to show evidence or proof of
[58:11] Innocence or or whatever it would be and
[58:14] so testifying I I I you know we used to
[58:19] have testimonies in service you know and
[58:22] and in the Pentecostal and and uh
[58:25] anybody got a testimony you know not
[58:27] everybody at once you know anyone got
[58:30] testimony you got you know and then you
[58:32] know it'd be usually some elder sister
[58:35] get up and talk for a good 15 minutes
[58:38] about who knows what you know just
[58:40] rambling well that's not
[58:43] testimony you know testimony and and and
[58:47] and so um uh it would a testimony it
[58:51] would have to be a statement of truth
[58:55] based on what we
[58:57] personally experienced ain't that right
[59:00] so if our testimony isn't a statement of
[59:03] truth then we are found to be false
[59:07] Witnesses and and and I'm afraid there's
[59:10] a lot of false Witnesses in the world
[59:13] today that that are taking uh the Bible
[59:17] and and and and declaring that God isn't
[59:21] the god of of what he was yesterday he's
[59:24] not the same today but he is the same I
[59:28] I declare that that he's still filling
[59:30] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I
[59:34] still declare that that people can be so
[59:38] wrapped up in God that they can live h a
[59:41] a life uh over
[59:44] sin and overcome the things of the world
[59:47] do you believe that amen there's a lot
[59:51] of talk about a lot of things and and
[59:54] people talk about the trouble as as we
[59:56] all know when you're out on the jobs or
[59:59] schools or where wherever uh but there's
[1:00:03] a lot of trouble that are going on and
[1:00:05] they talk about it they talk about the
[1:00:07] politics or they talk about sports they
[1:00:10] talk about the economy they talk about
[1:00:12] and uh just all kinds of things and the
[1:00:15] world is consumed by what's going on
[1:00:19] around them
[1:00:21] and you know they they uh um uh and and
[1:00:26] and that's just what's up upon the
[1:00:28] people's minds and most conversations
[1:00:32] these days are have have a have fear
[1:00:35] mixed in it or anxiety or hate or
[1:00:39] bitterness or uh worry um all of these
[1:00:43] things uh it's mixture of in the
[1:00:47] conversations because uh uh it it shows
[1:00:51] how people have been affected by the
[1:00:53] events that are taking place in the
[1:00:56] world and and you know and and so it it
[1:01:00] it's so much of of uh testifying of
[1:01:03] negative uh of things but but we
[1:01:07] find here in 1 Chronicles uh
[1:01:11] 16:24 it says declare his glory somebody
[1:01:15] say declare his glory declare his glory
[1:01:19] among the Heathen uh uh you know don't
[1:01:22] don't get wrapped up in in in in world
[1:01:26] conversations and we we shouldn't let
[1:01:29] our testimony or our conversations or
[1:01:33] our lives be tainted with uh bitterness
[1:01:37] or hatred or worry and fear and and as
[1:01:41] the world would be but declare his glory
[1:01:45] among the Heathen His Marvelous Works
[1:01:49] among all nations for great is the Lord
[1:01:53] and greatly to be praised he is also to
[1:01:57] be feared Above All
[1:02:00] Gods can you say Amen excuse me and so
[1:02:04] the the the word declare is another word
[1:02:06] for
[1:02:07] testify testify of his glory among the
[1:02:12] Heathen can you say amen amen see
[1:02:16] testify about His Marvelous Works amen
[1:02:20] for the Lord is great how many believes
[1:02:22] he's great he's greater than Trump I
[1:02:24] promise you that he's greater than Biden
[1:02:27] he's greater than any politician or any
[1:02:29] preacher or or or anything that we could
[1:02:33] we we could think of great is the Lord
[1:02:36] can you say amen and
[1:02:38] so uh the the word is uh declare is
[1:02:43] testify our life should testify of him
[1:02:47] now it's not just testifying out out in
[1:02:50] in the church I I know we don't do a lot
[1:02:53] of testifying in the church anymore like
[1:02:56] you know and I'm kind of glad for that
[1:02:58] uh because it seemed like testimonies uh
[1:03:00] like I said a lot of rambling and it and
[1:03:02] it took up the the service amen and and
[1:03:05] so we kind of uh you know brother Brian
[1:03:07] kind of set a lot of that in order and
[1:03:09] and we thank the Lord for that amen but
[1:03:12] you can still testify for our life
[1:03:14] should testify of him our our worship
[1:03:18] should testify of him how we worship the
[1:03:21] way we worship and and way we put our
[1:03:24] energy into worship it should testify of
[1:03:27] of of what we really think of God can
[1:03:30] you say Amen our mouth should testify of
[1:03:33] him our attitude should testify of him
[1:03:37] everything about us should testify and
[1:03:40] declare how great God is in in the world
[1:03:44] today can you say amen amen see so why
[1:03:48] why would God save us and and then keep
[1:03:52] us uh living in in a a world of sin and
[1:03:57] and chaos and all of that and and yeah
[1:04:01] yeah I I I believe that uh it does allow
[1:04:04] us to know him more I I I truly believe
[1:04:07] I know the Lord and have experienced him
[1:04:10] in a greater way than when I first gave
[1:04:13] my heart to him and and it it should be
[1:04:15] that way every day that we're we're
[1:04:17] Experiencing God we're we're we're
[1:04:20] growing in God God we're we're loving
[1:04:22] God I I believe I love him more than I
[1:04:25] did yet yesterday it he he just becoming
[1:04:28] more I I I I'm becoming consumed of him
[1:04:32] by him and and and and and I I think
[1:04:36] that's what it ought to be but also
[1:04:38] think it is for us to fulfill our
[1:04:40] purpose here in life and and and that is
[1:04:44] to glorify God I God should get the
[1:04:47] glory out of all of our Lives amen when
[1:04:51] you sing a song he should get the glory
[1:04:53] out of that when we preach a message he
[1:04:56] should get Glory out of that when we
[1:04:58] play music God should get Glory out of
[1:05:00] that when we're out on the road or out
[1:05:03] in the streets or wherever God should
[1:05:05] get the glory out of our Lives you
[1:05:08] believe that amen see and so Romans 15
[1:05:12] and6 it says that you may with one mind
[1:05:16] and one mouth glorify God Amen even the
[1:05:20] father of our Lord Jesus Christ and then
[1:05:23] if you go to the eighth verse now I say
[1:05:25] that Jesus Christ was a minister of the
[1:05:28] circumcision for the truth of God to
[1:05:30] confirm the promises made unto the
[1:05:33] fathers that the Gentiles might glorify
[1:05:37] God for his Mercy can you say Amen how
[1:05:40] many's received of his Mercy amen well
[1:05:43] it's not for us just to sit here and
[1:05:45] just oh yeah I'm on my way to heaven
[1:05:47] amen but it's to glorify God for his
[1:05:50] Mercy then then we do have something to
[1:05:53] talk about he gave us a testimony when
[1:05:56] he showed us his Mercy if you ain't got
[1:05:59] nothing to testify about you ought to
[1:06:01] testify of his mercy and glorify God by
[1:06:06] his Mercy that he has showed you amen
[1:06:09] yes uh he may not answer another prayer
[1:06:11] of mine I don't care but he's been so
[1:06:14] good that I still have a testimony amen
[1:06:17] of his Mercy amen so and that the
[1:06:20] Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy
[1:06:23] as it is written for this call I will
[1:06:26] confess to thee among the Gentiles and
[1:06:29] sing unto thy name and again he saith
[1:06:33] Rejoice ye
[1:06:35] Gentiles with his people again praise
[1:06:38] the Lord all ye Gentiles and L him all
[1:06:43] ye people praise Him declare him can you
[1:06:47] say amen amen you know you're you're
[1:06:50] when you when you're testifying to
[1:06:52] somebody on the street of the Lord
[1:06:53] you're actually worshiping God
[1:06:56] it's not just our worship is here it yes
[1:06:59] we worship here by lifting our hands and
[1:07:02] singing song we should do that that
[1:07:04] should never get common to us amen
[1:07:07] knowing where we're going what he
[1:07:09] brought us from and and the promises
[1:07:11] that are ours and and that that we we
[1:07:15] should be able to praise him from the
[1:07:17] heart amen whether the music is going or
[1:07:19] whether it's not going where someone's
[1:07:22] singing on tune or not singing on tune
[1:07:24] it shouldn't matter we're here to
[1:07:26] glorify God Amen but when we're out on
[1:07:30] the streets and we're talking to our
[1:07:31] friends and we're talking to our
[1:07:33] co-workers about the things of God
[1:07:35] you're glorifying God you're worshiping
[1:07:38] God Amen you're you're giving God the
[1:07:42] praise that is Du his name amen but see
[1:07:45] God wants us to glorify him uh First
[1:07:48] Corinthians 620 you are bought with the
[1:07:52] price think of that now you are bought
[1:07:55] with the price how many believes that
[1:07:57] amen now you think of that when God
[1:07:59] saved your soul he snatched you from the
[1:08:02] devil amen and and and he bought you
[1:08:06] with the
[1:08:08] price
[1:08:09] therefore glorify God in your
[1:08:13] body and in your spirit can you say Amen
[1:08:16] which are Gods amen that that's why we
[1:08:19] don't go to church and we say Amen to
[1:08:21] the word and then we go out and live any
[1:08:24] old way we want to act any old way we
[1:08:26] want to because we're glorifying God in

[1:08:41] metal amen they wouldn't pass security
[1:08:43] amen and the metal detector you know and
[1:08:46] and uh uh but but we find amen but we
[1:08:50] glorify God we sanctify the Lord in in
[1:08:53] our bodies and and we keep ourselves
[1:08:56] holy and clean can you say Amen why
[1:09:00] because we're bought with a price God
[1:09:03] bought you that you could glorify him in
[1:09:06] your body amen I know the world's acting
[1:09:08] like heathens but you don't have to do
[1:09:10] that because God bought you with the
[1:09:13] price that Redemption price Satan has no
[1:09:16] claim on you anymore he has no claim on
[1:09:18] your body he has no claim on your spirit
[1:09:20] he has no claim on your mind amen
[1:09:24] glorify God in body and in your spirit
[1:09:28] which are Gods which are Gods amen Acts
[1:09:33] 1:8 but you shall receive power after
[1:09:36] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:09:38] and you shall be
[1:09:40] Witnesses you shall be Witnesses of me
[1:09:44] can you sayen if God's going to have
[1:09:46] someone to uh that he's going to ask to
[1:09:48] come on the stand and be a witness it's
[1:09:51] you it's I amen that we would be gladly
[1:09:54] we should be glad to give a testimony of
[1:09:57] our Lord Jesus amen Psalms 19 And1 The
[1:10:01] Heavens declare the glory of God and the
[1:10:04] firmament showeth his handiworks now
[1:10:08] brother Brown talked about that was his
[1:10:09] first Bible was the stars and and and
[1:10:12] the the the universe and nature and and
[1:10:15] things but the the Sun the moon the
[1:10:18] stars and the planets and they all speak
[1:10:21] of him the heavens declare the glory of
[1:10:25] God Amen and in Psalms 97 and6 the
[1:10:29] heavens declare his righteousness and
[1:10:32] all the people see his glory they may
[1:10:36] not recognize it but they see his glory
[1:10:38] they're without a witness of God Amen
[1:10:41] they're without a witness amen because
[1:10:44] there is a a a the heavens declaring him
[1:10:48] amen but then the trees the flowers
[1:10:51] declare him the grass the The Four
[1:10:54] Seasons that we have it it speaks of him
[1:10:58] animals uh life speaks of him and you
[1:11:02] can see God in in the flowers and in the
[1:11:06] trees and and and and you can see God in
[1:11:09] in the birds and as they sing of him and
[1:11:12] they're glorifying him see so God is is
[1:11:17] glorified in his creation but then we
[1:11:21] find that God created a people for his
[1:11:24] glory
[1:11:25] now you think of it he created a people
[1:11:29] for his glory Isaiah 43 and6 it says I
[1:11:33] will say to the north give up and to the
[1:11:36] South keep not back bring my sons from
[1:11:39] far and my daughters from the ends of
[1:11:42] the Earth even everyone that is called
[1:11:45] by not my name for I have created him
[1:11:49] for my
[1:11:50] glory aren't you glad for that amen
[1:11:54] created him
[1:11:55] I have formed him yay I have made him
[1:11:59] and then if you go to the 21st verse of
[1:12:02] the 40 thir chapter this people have I
[1:12:06] formed for
[1:12:08] myself they shall show forth my praise
[1:12:12] can you say Amen they're going to
[1:12:14] declare me not not all men declare a God
[1:12:18] not every man you got men that are
[1:12:20] spatting words against God and and oh
[1:12:24] they they may bless him with their lips
[1:12:27] and yet their heart is far from him and
[1:12:30] and and yet they're they're cursing and
[1:12:32] they're oh we're we're Christian and and
[1:12:35] and and yet swearing and us the lord's
[1:12:38] name in vain and saying all kinds of
[1:12:41] ungodly things and all these things but
[1:12:44] God has created a people for himself you
[1:12:49] understand that church they're not them
[1:12:50] people are not swearing and using God's
[1:12:53] name in vain amen but they've been kept
[1:12:56] apart for God and for his glory they are
[1:12:59] Sanctified they are chosen people now
[1:13:03] who is this people that God formed for
[1:13:06] himself 1 Corinthians 3:16 know ye not
[1:13:11] that you are the temple of God and that
[1:13:14] the spirit of God dwelleth in you amen
[1:13:17] If any man Devour the temple of God him
[1:13:20] shall God destroy for the temple of God
[1:13:23] is Holy which Temple you are amen you've
[1:13:27] been bought with a price why that God
[1:13:30] that you could be the Temple of the
[1:13:32] Living God Amen see and and and then the
[1:13:36] 2 Corinthians
[1:13:37] 6:16 and what agreement have the temple
[1:13:41] of God with Idols right amen that's why
[1:13:45] you ain't going to be joined up with the
[1:13:47] the World Council of
[1:13:49] churches that's a that that's just a
[1:13:52] swamp of all all ungod
[1:13:55] coming into that well what what
[1:13:57] agreement would the temple of God have
[1:13:59] with them things that's why we can't
[1:14:01] join up with all kinds of nonsense
[1:14:04] that's in the world today for you are
[1:14:07] the Temple of the Living God as God has
[1:14:10] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[1:14:14] them you're talking about an experience
[1:14:16] God going to give you a testimony amen
[1:14:19] when they're telling that the world is
[1:14:20] not or God ain't real and God ain't
[1:14:22] doing what he used to do and and and
[1:14:25] this and that God says I'm going to
[1:14:28] dwell in you I'm going to walk in you
[1:14:31] I'm I'm going to make myself known ain't
[1:14:34] that right he says and I will dwell in
[1:14:36] them walk in them I will be their God
[1:14:39] and they shall be my people wherefore
[1:14:42] come out from among them and be ye
[1:14:45] separate sayith the Lord and touch not
[1:14:47] the unclean thing and I will receive you
[1:14:52] can you say
[1:14:53] Amen so we are living temples of the
[1:14:57] Living God lord now you know there
[1:15:01] there's a lot of temples out in the
[1:15:02] world today that are erected for Gods
[1:15:06] there's a lot of gods and there's a lot
[1:15:08] of temples and and so it it's
[1:15:11] interesting that the how that the
[1:15:13] heathens Even build temples for their
[1:15:17] gods amen and and temples all over the
[1:15:20] world uh uh when Christianity first came
[1:15:24] to Rome
[1:15:26] that there was uh about what uh 400
[1:15:28] temples I think the prophet said you
[1:15:31] know that that were uh within a s mile
[1:15:34] radius uh 7 mile radius 400 temples for
[1:15:38] all these gods that were out there and
[1:15:42] and uh to think of that see and and so
[1:15:45] temples are they they they have a
[1:15:49] purpose and and not only does it for God
[1:15:52] but for for the world you got to have a
[1:15:54] temple for your God uh uh to come in to
[1:15:57] live in temples are sacred amen whatever
[1:16:00] you do out in the world when you come
[1:16:02] into that Temple you just don't do
[1:16:03] things like you did out in the world
[1:16:06] Amen because it's a sacred it's a place
[1:16:08] of sacredness it's a place where deity
[1:16:11] is to dwell it's a place where a deity
[1:16:14] is exalted and worshiped ain't that
[1:16:17] right and so these people think that
[1:16:19] there's deity in their idols and so they
[1:16:22] erect temples and and and and place the
[1:16:25] the their gods in these temples and and
[1:16:28] it's a it's a it's a place of sacredness
[1:16:31] to them and a place of worship and
[1:16:34] exaltation and a place of honor ain't
[1:16:37] that right and and so well we we know
[1:16:41] that in the Old Testament there was the
[1:16:43] temples and and and Moses uh uh uh had
[1:16:47] there there was the Tabernacle of Moses
[1:16:50] amen and and it was for deity to come it
[1:16:54] was it was a place for God to dwell and
[1:16:57] and it had the three
[1:16:59] compartments uh uh there the outer Court
[1:17:02] the inner court and the holiest of holy
[1:17:05] and and of course these three these
[1:17:08] three courts represents the the the
[1:17:10] three parts of man the the flesh which
[1:17:13] is the outer the spirit which is the
[1:17:15] inner and then the Soul of of man and
[1:17:19] and so each of these courts had
[1:17:21] different uh uh functions uh different
[1:17:24] uh things uh furniture and different
[1:17:27] kinds of light the outer Court had
[1:17:29] sunlight the inner Court had candle
[1:17:32] light and then the the the the holiest
[1:17:36] of holy that third Court it it had
[1:17:39] shakina light it it was God himself the
[1:17:43] pillar of fire ain't that right and so
[1:17:46] but but this was three compartments and
[1:17:48] and and it was a type of what man is um
[1:17:52] there but in that third room
[1:17:55] uh uh the holiest of holies uh it it had
[1:18:00] there The Arc of the Covenant or uh
[1:18:03] another word for it is the Ark of
[1:18:07] testimonies and and so that that Ark I I
[1:18:11] wished I had a picture of it uh uh but
[1:18:14] that the Ark of the Covenant it was just
[1:18:16] a wooden box and and and uh uh it was a
[1:18:21] wooden box and inside of that box was
[1:18:24] the law or or we would call it the word
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:29] testimonies uh uh the testimony and
[1:18:32] things in E Exodus 25 and 21 it says and
[1:18:36] thou shalt put the mercy seat up upon
[1:18:39] the ark see uh uh and in the ark Thou
[1:18:43] shalt put the testimony that I shall
[1:18:46] give thee and there I will commu or meet
[1:18:50] with thee and will I will commune with
[1:18:54] thee from from Above The Mercy Seat from
[1:18:57] between the two cherubims which are upon
[1:18:59] the Ark of the testimony of all things
[1:19:03] which I will give thee in commandment
[1:19:05] unto the children of Israel ain't that
[1:19:07] right so the Covenant was in the ark the
[1:19:11] testimony amen was was in the ark and
[1:19:14] The Mercy Seat covered the testimony
[1:19:16] covered that word
[1:19:19] amen and and and that was placed in that
[1:19:23] that third compartment that third room
[1:19:26] amen and and that's where the word was
[1:19:29] and that's where the presence of God
[1:19:32] come amen is where the word was can you
[1:19:35] say amen amen and so we we find that God
[1:19:39] would come and settle in between the
[1:19:42] cheram and he would commune amen not not
[1:19:47] in the first room or the outer court and
[1:19:50] the the the the the second court but
[1:19:52] that third Court where the Ark of the
[1:19:54] testimony was ain't that right and so it
[1:19:58] it was put in there the Tabernacle of
[1:20:01] Moses and brother Bri said see it was
[1:20:03] veiled behind veiled behind the old
[1:20:06] Badger skins in the old Temple was the
[1:20:08] word see was the word manifested on
[1:20:12] tables of stone ain't that right see and
[1:20:16] and and so uh uh to think of it now it
[1:20:19] says and then another place behind the
[1:20:21] old temple in the veil what was behind
[1:20:24] there
[1:20:25] he said what was Jehovah what was hid
[1:20:27] back there what was the veil hiding oh
[1:20:30] hallelujah what was the veil hiding it
[1:20:32] was hiding the word see The Veil The Old
[1:20:36] Badger skins was hidden hiding the word
[1:20:39] to their natural or to their eyes
[1:20:41] natural behind there also was the shoe
[1:20:44] bread uh behind there also was the shik
[1:20:48] glory ain't that right remember the the
[1:20:51] old Mana it died every day it got old
[1:20:54] and every morning they can't they
[1:20:56] weren't allowed to keep it or eat it or
[1:20:58] anything cuz it'd get nasty and wormy
[1:21:00] and maggoty and and they had to throw it
[1:21:03] away they weren't allowed to keep it but
[1:21:05] then God would tell them to get a bowl
[1:21:08] of of this mana and take it not in the
[1:21:11] outer Court the inner court but that
[1:21:14] third room where the word was amen where
[1:21:19] the ark was where the The Mercy Seat
[1:21:22] hovered over that testimony
[1:21:25] amen and and put it in there and that
[1:21:28] Mana would would not get old but it was
[1:21:31] Kept For Generations that the priest
[1:21:34] could come into that room and partake of
[1:21:37] of that same mana and it was still as
[1:21:40] fresh as it was when it first fell
[1:21:42] showing that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:21:45] yesterday today and forever and whoever
[1:21:49] partook of that had a different
[1:21:50] testimony than those that were on the
[1:21:53] outside they'd say well I I I I ate some
[1:21:56] of that stuff that was a week ago that
[1:21:57] fell a week ago and it was nasty but
[1:22:00] whoever come into that in that third
[1:22:02] room amen could come out and say it's
[1:22:05] still fresh it's still the same amen
[1:22:08] what was the difference it was where the
[1:22:10] word was
[1:22:13] right can you say
[1:22:15] amen and so we we find that the prophet
[1:22:19] said see it was hid from from it was all
[1:22:21] hid from them it was all hid all all the
[1:22:24] glory of God was right behind that old
[1:22:27] Badger skin all hid to the natural eye
[1:22:30] only those that were chosen to go in
[1:22:33] there and partake amen could see the
[1:22:36] glory of the Lord that's right but this
[1:22:38] showed where the word would be
[1:22:40] positionally placed in man amen it it
[1:22:44] wouldn't be in the flesh rim and it
[1:22:47] would not be in the spirit real but it
[1:22:50] would be kept in the soul of man can you
[1:22:53] say man
[1:22:55] you're you're made up of three
[1:22:56] compartments and you're the temple of
[1:22:58] God Amen you have that flesh uh that
[1:23:01] flesh rim and and this outer court and
[1:23:04] you have that inner court amen that that
[1:23:06] still can get smoked up and and all of
[1:23:09] these things but then in that Soul amen
[1:23:12] is kept where that word is to be kept
[1:23:15] can you say Amen where the word will not
[1:23:18] get stale and your testimony will not
[1:23:20] get stale but your testimony remains
[1:23:23] fresh because you're seeing him as the
[1:23:26] same yesterday today and forever it
[1:23:29] doesn't matter what this flesh says it
[1:23:31] doesn't matter what our spirit feels it
[1:23:33] it doesn't matter what I think or how I
[1:23:35] feel there's something down inside that
[1:23:37] I'm partaking of the Mana of the Hidden
[1:23:40] mana and the realities of God can you
[1:23:44] say amen that's why I can testify beli
[1:23:46] Living God whether I feel him or not
[1:23:49] amen where where whether it seemed like
[1:23:51] uh uh the mountain is just so far great
[1:23:54] I don't know what to do but I can stand
[1:23:56] there with the testimony and declare the
[1:23:59] glory of God Amen because there's
[1:24:02] something down in the
[1:24:06] soul
[1:24:08] notice uh in Hebrews 10 and
[1:24:11] 16 uh Paul wrote of the Covenant that
[1:24:13] God made uh and and and this is the
[1:24:17] Covenant that I will make with them
[1:24:20] after those days sayith the Lord I will
[1:24:23] put my laws in their hearts and in their
[1:24:26] minds while I write them and their sins
[1:24:28] and iniquities will I remember no more
[1:24:31] amen aren't you glad for that oh what a
[1:24:34] mercy
[1:24:36] seat amen yes sir and so we find that
[1:24:41] Jesus also said from the abundance of
[1:24:44] the
[1:24:44] heart the mouth
[1:24:47] speaketh so wherever what's in that
[1:24:50] heart is what the mouth is going to
[1:24:52] declare ain't that right
[1:24:54] it's down in the abundance of the heart
[1:24:57] and this is why God promised to write
[1:24:59] his law his word of course we know it as
[1:25:02] the Word of Promise a word of
[1:25:05] Grace amen that he would write it in our
[1:25:09] heart amen oh I'm so glad for that and
[1:25:13] and so then so in in the Tabernacle of
[1:25:16] Moses the word was put behind the bad
[1:25:18] your skin in the holiest of holy and and
[1:25:22] exodus 40 and 34 four it says then a
[1:25:25] cloud covered the tent of the
[1:25:27] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[1:25:29] filled the
[1:25:30] Tabernacle think of that the cloud
[1:25:33] covered the tent of the congregation and
[1:25:35] the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:25:37] Tabernacle and Moses was not able to
[1:25:39] enter into the tent of the congregation
[1:25:41] because of the cloud Abode there on and
[1:25:44] the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:25:46] Tabernacle think of that filled the
[1:25:48] temple Amen brother Bri said now notice
[1:25:51] the old Temple had in it the shakina
[1:25:54] glor Glory see the light of the shikina
[1:25:57] over the word the word is a seed and it
[1:26:00] brought forth the Sho bread to Believers
[1:26:04] only see the blood also was upon the
[1:26:07] Covenant see the blood is the water the
[1:26:10] water that's uh that liens the grain see
[1:26:14] the the the wheat the seed which is the
[1:26:17] word so we we see and and we could go
[1:26:20] more into the study of of the Tabernacle
[1:26:23] of Moses but we find
[1:26:25] that David one time he he said you know
[1:26:27] it's
[1:26:28] not it's not good that I live in a nice
[1:26:31] house here they build built me a house
[1:26:34] and it's a palace and all all these
[1:26:36] things and yet the Lord dwells in the
[1:26:39] tent the the testimony dwells in the
[1:26:42] tent the the Covenant and and so he
[1:26:47] determined that he was going to build a
[1:26:49] house for God a temple and of course I
[1:26:52] think it was Nathan the prophet said do
[1:26:54] all that's in your heart for the Lord's
[1:26:56] with the and but the Lord come back and
[1:26:59] told Nathan said now go tell David it's
[1:27:02] it's not meant for him to build the
[1:27:04] Tabernacle he he's his hands are just
[1:27:06] too bloody of war and things but his son
[1:27:09] will and and and so we we find that
[1:27:14] Solomon being the natural son of David
[1:27:18] did build a temple uh and I guess it
[1:27:22] would be known as Solomon's Temple
[1:27:25] uh and and if you go and read what what
[1:27:28] he did I mean he put some he put Time
[1:27:31] and Labor into this to make sure
[1:27:33] everything was just right and and then
[1:27:37] he offered Sac thousands of
[1:27:40] sacrifices and when he offered the
[1:27:43] sacrifices and he got done the glory of
[1:27:46] the Lord coming into that place to where
[1:27:48] even the priest could not Minister and
[1:27:51] it must have been a a real real
[1:27:55] uh time what a day that would have been
[1:27:58] to finally get this thing I mean took
[1:28:00] years to build the temple and and uh lot
[1:28:05] of work went into this and then then
[1:28:08] they see the glory of the Lord descend
[1:28:11] and and come into that Temple it it must
[1:28:14] have been a glorious day but we find
[1:28:17] that that that was just a type and
[1:28:20] Shadow because uh uh really God was
[1:28:24] telling David that your son the true son
[1:28:28] which was Jesus Christ would build a
[1:28:30] temple amen and and and that would be
[1:28:34] the real thing and so brother brandham
[1:28:36] says see the true son of David is Christ
[1:28:39] Jesus that built the real Temple that
[1:28:42] was born a virgin birth and in his body
[1:28:47] is the Everlasting temple of God ain't
[1:28:51] that right see so now Solomon's Temple
[1:28:54] had the Ark of the
[1:28:56] testimony it had the Ark of the Covenant
[1:28:59] amen all of these things and and I I'll
[1:29:03] I'll read it here but 2 Chronicles 7:1
[1:29:06] it says and when Solomon had made an end
[1:29:08] to praying the fire came down from
[1:29:10] heaven and consumed the burnt offering
[1:29:12] and the sacrifices and the glory of the
[1:29:14] Lord filled the house and the priest
[1:29:17] could not enter into the house of the
[1:29:19] Lord because the glory of the Lord had
[1:29:21] filled the Lord's House and and when all
[1:29:24] the children of Israel saw how the fire
[1:29:27] came down and the glory of the Lord upon
[1:29:30] the house they bowed themselves with
[1:29:33] their faces to the ground upon the
[1:29:36] pavement and worshiped and praised the
[1:29:38] Lord saying for he is good for his mercy
[1:29:43] endureth forever amen it it brought a
[1:29:46] song it brought a response from the
[1:29:49] people seeing the glory of the Lord
[1:29:52] descend upon the Tabernacle ain't that
[1:29:55] right so Prophet said the see the P
[1:29:58] Pillar of Fire it it passed over and
[1:30:01] went down and took his resting place
[1:30:04] with the Ark of the Covenant there in
[1:30:07] Solomon's Temple but we find years later
[1:30:10] that that Temple was destroyed by
[1:30:12] Nebuchadnezzar in in 586 BC and and and
[1:30:17] it it it remained that way until uh the
[1:30:20] Jews had come out of Exile and and then
[1:30:24] they rebuilt the temple uh uh
[1:30:27] there and and so uh when the and they
[1:30:32] were proud of that but when the real uh
[1:30:35] son of David came to Earth he he looked
[1:30:38] at him and he told him he says now there
[1:30:40] will not be one stone upon another on
[1:30:43] this Temple and all he tell them that
[1:30:45] this Temple all that work you've done
[1:30:48] and all of these things is going to be
[1:30:50] destroyed and and and so of course they
[1:30:53] didn't believe that and all that but the
[1:30:55] prophet said what he was trying to do he
[1:30:57] was trying to point them to another
[1:31:00] Temple amen an everlasting Temple
[1:31:03] another Temple and get your eyes off of
[1:31:06] that Temple and look to another Temple
[1:31:08] can you say Amen but they couldn't get
[1:31:10] their eyes off of it now there was a
[1:31:13] promise given by the prophet hegi in in
[1:31:17] hegi 2 and9 and it says the glory of
[1:31:20] this latter house shall be great than of
[1:31:24] the former sayith the Lord of host and
[1:31:27] in this place will I give peace sayith
[1:31:31] the Lord of host can you say amen amen
[1:31:35] so now they're thinking that they built
[1:31:37] this second they restored the the the
[1:31:40] Temple of Solomon and and so they they
[1:31:44] were looking for the glory to come as it
[1:31:48] did in the first house and they were
[1:31:51] looking for it to be greater Glory than
[1:31:55] what it was when Solomon first built
[1:31:57] that Temple but it never
[1:32:00] happened it it never took place and and
[1:32:04] now as they're waiting on this glory to
[1:32:07] come then Jesus is telling them this
[1:32:10] Temple is going to be
[1:32:12] destroyed and and so we we find that uh
[1:32:16] uh they they thought it would be greater
[1:32:19] and and so uh we find that the glory of
[1:32:23] the latter house never did become
[1:32:26] greater uh upon that Temple as it was
[1:32:31] the former can you say Amen because it
[1:32:34] was not part of the promise they they
[1:32:37] were totally looking at the scripture
[1:32:39] wrong they didn't understand it but
[1:32:42] notice in Acts 7 and 48 how be it the
[1:32:45] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[1:32:50] with hands as saith the prophet can you
[1:32:54] say Amen so if they could have
[1:32:56] understood that that that Temple of of
[1:32:59] Moses and the Temple of uh the
[1:33:01] Tabernacle of Moses and the Temple of
[1:33:03] Solomon was only a a a a prefigure a a
[1:33:08] type A telling of another Temple that
[1:33:11] was to come and them temples had to be
[1:33:14] destroyed can you say amen and and and
[1:33:17] and must have been great for the glory
[1:33:19] of the Lord to to descend upon them the
[1:33:22] Tabernacle and and upon Solomon's Temple
[1:33:26] but oh God was telling me don't get
[1:33:28] don't don't look at this there's
[1:33:30] something greater that's coming in
[1:33:32] another Temple can you say amen and and
[1:33:35] so how be it the most high dwelt not in
[1:33:38] temples made with hands where where the
[1:33:40] stone is cut with with saws and and and
[1:33:44] the timber has been cut down and all of
[1:33:46] these things Hebrews 9 And1 Christ being
[1:33:51] come and high priest of good things to
[1:33:53] come
[1:33:54] by a greater everybody say a greater and
[1:33:57] more perfect
[1:34:00] Tabernacle not made with hands can you
[1:34:04] say amen amen so uh uh and then go
[1:34:09] Hebrews 10 and5 wherefore when he cometh
[1:34:12] into the world he says sacrifice and
[1:34:15] offerings thou wouldest not but a body
[1:34:19] thou H has prepared me not made of stone
[1:34:23] and bricks and sticks and all that but a
[1:34:27] body thou Hast prepared me see so that's
[1:34:31] the latter house that God was speaking
[1:34:34] of can you say man remember a greater
[1:34:37] than Solomon is here amen see so a body
[1:34:42] not made with hands is a greater and
[1:34:45] more perfect Tabernacle than the
[1:34:48] Tabernacle of Moses and of of uh the
[1:34:52] Temple of Solomon so we look now amen
[1:34:56] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[1:34:59] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:35:03] was God and the 14th verse and the Word
[1:35:07] was made flesh can you say Amen no
[1:35:11] longer the Ark of the Covenant amen come
[1:35:15] being able you can't put the Ark of the
[1:35:16] Covenant into this Temple it the word
[1:35:19] now becomes flesh
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:23] can you say Amen see amen greater than
[1:35:27] just uh uh uh the word resting in a in a
[1:35:31] building but now the word has taken on
[1:35:36] skin can you say Amen the word was made
[1:35:40] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:35:43] his
[1:35:45] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:35:48] of the father full of grace and truth
[1:35:51] what was he he was the expressed image
[1:35:53] of of God he declared God to the people
[1:35:57] testified of God can you say Amen see he
[1:36:01] declared God the Tabernacle of Moses
[1:36:04] couldn't do that the T Temple of Solomon
[1:36:07] couldn't do that can you say Amen we
[1:36:10] look I I think we could all agree that
[1:36:13] that the Tabernacle of Moses was was uh
[1:36:16] made after the Heavenly it was it was
[1:36:19] the image of heavenly things amen
[1:36:23] that right but notice what Jesus Christ
[1:36:26] was he was the expressed image of God
[1:36:28] that's right amen he was the expressed
[1:36:31] image and the voice of God came from
[1:36:35] him he was the word can you say Amen
[1:36:40] even God testified of him saying this is
[1:36:43] my beloved Son hear ye him in in whom
[1:36:47] I'm well pleased to dwell in see the
[1:36:51] word of God flowed through him hello he
[1:36:54] was the Temple of the Living God and the
[1:36:58] word of God flow through him the word of
[1:37:01] God rested in him the word of God
[1:37:04] manifested itself through him can you
[1:37:06] say amen he testified of the word and
[1:37:10] the word testified of him you believe
[1:37:13] that he didn't testify of a denomination
[1:37:15] he testified of what the father showed
[1:37:17] him testified of what the father was for
[1:37:21] he was the father
[1:37:25] now can you say
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:29] amen Lord we
[1:37:31] find brother Ram said now that same
[1:37:33] logos has a
[1:37:35] part he's got a bride and the same logos
[1:37:39] this word can that cannot be tampered
[1:37:40] with is brooding over the churches today
[1:37:43] trying to bring back the word to its
[1:37:45] full
[1:37:46] manifestation and you say
[1:37:49] Amen see and now it it's true and I'm
[1:37:52] going to close i' I've got more to go
[1:37:55] but it's true that a man can be used of
[1:37:58] God and yet not express God so that's
[1:38:02] not the temple of
[1:38:04] God uh uh the spirit of God can fall
[1:38:07] upon the Flesh of our
[1:38:10] flesh can can come fall upon a man's
[1:38:13] Spirit he can speak in tongues and he
[1:38:15] can do all kinds of things dance shout
[1:38:18] and and actually work miracles prophesy
[1:38:22] all of these things
[1:38:24] and and yet not be the temple of God not
[1:38:27] not express God not speak of God because
[1:38:31] the word is not in him can you say Amen
[1:38:35] but notice the prophet said when Christ
[1:38:38] left he Sanctified the church that the
[1:38:42] church might take his
[1:38:45] place not just have a religious
[1:38:49] experience not just so they have a
[1:38:51] religious feeling but a people that
[1:38:54] would stand in his
[1:38:59] place to where that God could be the
[1:39:02] same in every
[1:39:05] detail but the physical
[1:39:07] body can you say Amen every
[1:39:11] detail you believe it yes sir and that
[1:39:15] the church might take his place and
[1:39:18] express the word of God Express the the
[1:39:22] promises of God become that Living
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:28] Word now he says in another place say it
[1:39:31] taken him 4,000 years to make this
[1:39:33] masterpiece now he's been nearly 2,000
[1:39:35] years making another Masterpiece a bride
[1:39:37] for Christ another Masterpiece can you
[1:39:41] say amen and she can only be a perfect
[1:39:43] Masterpiece the prophet said when it's
[1:39:45] the perfect word that's right so notice
[1:39:48] he says we are made partakers of his
[1:39:51] Holiness see we're we're we and this may
[1:39:54] not even make sense I hope it's making a
[1:39:56] little sense to you but we are we are we
[1:40:00] are partaking we are experienced
[1:40:03] something that the world knows nothing
[1:40:05] of therefore Our Testimony is becoming
[1:40:08] so enlightening it's we we are speaking
[1:40:12] of something we
[1:40:14] know not something that we've learned
[1:40:16] about not head knowledge but something
[1:40:19] because the God is now living within us
[1:40:22] we are made made partakers of his
[1:40:25] Holiness we In His Image are living
[1:40:29] images of a living God then dead to self
[1:40:34] raised with him now listen listen to
[1:40:36] this his word made flesh again in us
[1:40:41] when they want to speak doubt we can't
[1:40:43] speak doubt when they ain't got no hope
[1:40:47] we don't talk like we ain't got no hope
[1:40:49] a living God is in US
[1:40:54] can you say Amen we're not we're not
[1:40:57] we're not talking of a god of yesterday
[1:40:59] we're the Temple of a living God the god

[1:41:05] supreme is within us the god that rolled
[1:41:08] back the Red Sea is living within us
[1:41:11] it's a testimony that we
[1:41:17] have he said what is it it's not the
[1:41:19] mythical imaginary God sitting out there
[1:41:22] but the Living God
[1:41:24] what is the Living God the word in you
[1:41:25] making itself real glory to God he said
[1:41:30] I know you think I'm a holy roor maybe I
[1:41:32] am but oh brother do you see it triumph
[1:41:34] over every denomination triumph over all

[1:50:18] rejected amen and and or the Cornerstone
[1:50:23] and we find that Christ was rejected of
[1:50:27] the Jews but here in this day The
[1:50:31] Headstone the Cornerstone has become The
[1:50:34] Headstone and he's not rejected when he
[1:50:37] comes but there's a people crying Grace
[1:50:39] Grace To The
[1:50:42] Headstone and when the Lord shall build
[1:50:44] up Zion he shall appear in his glory he
[1:50:48] will regard the prayer of the destitute

[1:51:26] show forth his glory and the word would
[1:51:29] become prominant inside of them 1
