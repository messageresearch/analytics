[35:26] of hurt this week a lot of
[35:28] Devastation and yet um I don't think
[35:32] I've heard of any of God's
[35:35] people losing their lives in this in the
[35:39] in the flooding and all it I was
[35:41] thinking about brother Forton where I'm
[35:44] from we sit in the foothills of the
[35:46] mountains
[35:49] and the um powers that be say that we
[35:53] should have had worse flooding
[35:56] there and yet I think I think of that
[35:58] church sitting on the
[35:59] hill and I think of God's bride there
[36:02] and towns had to be
[36:05] destroyed and I'm so sorry heartbroken
[36:08] over it but towns had to be destroyed to
[36:12] protect God's bride in Rutherfordton
[36:14] North Carolina and that's simple but I
[36:17] believe with all my
[36:19] heart God protected his his children I
[36:23] do y'all sing it with me

[36:42] daily
[36:44] bread see them at the grave of one who
[36:48] left us too
[36:51] young and I've heard them crying out for
[36:56] their wayward
[37:00] but I've never no never seen The
[37:05] rightous
[37:06] Forsaken seen them with tears in their
[37:10] eyes I've seen them with their hearts
[37:13] breaking I've seen them tested seen them
[37:17] tried seen them with their face Shake on
[37:22] but I never no never seen the rightous
[37:27] was

[44:53] her brother then her husband and now her
[44:57] daughter and so I know I know she would

[46:38] everything that they have lost their
[46:40] loved ones through this flood of last

[47:08] um ask prayer for these needs Lord
[47:12] Jesus father I know that we uh had
[47:17] requests but these two maybe have not

[47:27] and Lord I don't even know where she is

[47:40] remember your Prophet talking about the
[47:43] convert that he had won over to the Lord
[47:45] at 90 years

[49:17] needs father may you go to where they're
[49:19] at we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[49:24] and
[49:25] amen if you have your Bibles we're going
[49:28] to turn first of all got a few
[49:31] scriptures here but first of all acts 1
[49:35] and8 and um also
[49:40] um
[49:41] uh sister Britney uh reserved a place at
[49:45] a park nearby for next
[49:47] Sunday after the morning service for
[49:50] Fellowship so if you would um I'm sure
[49:53] she
[49:53] will um send out or whatever we're going
[49:58] to do um we may just go get something
[50:03] and just every each individual do what
[50:06] they want to do as far as food and then
[50:09] if you want to meet over there I'm sure
[50:11] it'll be enjoyable have some
[50:14] fellowship so uh but acts 1
[50:20] and8 uh it says but you shall receive
[50:23] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[50:27] upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto
[50:30] me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and
[50:34] in Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[50:37] of the
[50:38] earth then if you'll turn with me to uh
[50:42] uh The Book of John
[50:45] one John the first
[50:51] chapter and we're going
[50:54] to start at the 10th verse
[50:57] verse and read a few verses
[51:00] here it says he speaking of Jesus was in
[51:03] the world and the world was made by him
[51:06] and the world knew him not he came unto
[51:09] his own and his own received him
[51:11] not but as many as received him to them
[51:16] gave he power to become sons of God even
[51:20] to them that believe on his name which
[51:22] were born not of blood nor of the will
[51:24] of the flesh nor of the of man but of
[51:29] God then turn with me John
[51:34] 15 um and we'll start at the first verse
[51:38] John
[51:40] 15 and
[51:44] one I am the
[51:47] Vine I am the True Vine and my father is
[51:50] the husbandman every branch in me that
[51:53] beareth not fruit he taketh
[51:57] away and every branch that beareth
[52:01] fruit um he purgeth it that it may bring
[52:06] forth more fruit now you are clean
[52:09] through the word which I have spoken
[52:11] unto you abide in me and I in you as the
[52:15] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[52:17] except it abide in the vine no more can
[52:20] you except you abide in me I am the vine
[52:24] you are the branches he that abide
[52:26] abideth in me and I in him the same
[52:29] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[52:33] you can do nothing if a man abide not in
[52:37] me he is cast forth as a branch and is
[52:40] withered and Men gather them and cast
[52:43] them into the fire and they are burned
[52:46] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[52:50] you you shall ask what you will and it
[52:54] shall everybody say it shall
[52:57] be done unto you ain't that right all
[53:01] right one more uh Luke
[53:04] 12 Luke
[53:06] 12 and uh we're going to start at the
[53:09] sixth
[53:15] verse so you shall receive
[53:17] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[53:20] upon you um then of course we read where
[53:24] he said that unto them that received him
[53:27] to them gave he power if you abide in me
[53:31] my words abide in you you shall ask what
[53:34] you will so it surely doesn't give us a
[53:36] picture of a defeated Church ain't that
[53:40] right and then uh Luke 12 and um we're
[53:46] going to start at the sixth verse six
[53:47] and S are not five sparrows sold for two
[53:51] far thingss and not one of them is
[53:54] forgotten before God
[53:57] but even the very hairs of your
[54:00] head um are all numbered fear not
[54:05] therefore you are of more
[54:08] value than many sparrows can you
[54:12] sayen you can have your seats this
[54:16] morning I had uh was really really
[54:19] trying to get on another thought and um
[54:25] um
[54:28] concerning of the age that we're living
[54:31] in and and the world condition and
[54:34] things but uh it just uh it just wasn't
[54:40] happening and uh so yesterday I just
[54:43] like Lord I I need your help I I don't
[54:46] know why this is going just you know
[54:49] just something just wasn't I don't know
[54:52] how I guess you preachers know how that
[54:55] is you you you you're really trying to
[54:57] go One Direction and and and just you
[55:00] just something just not right and so um
[55:05] it just uh come on this uh today and I
[55:09] pray that it'll be a blessing but you
[55:11] know there are so so many things that
[55:14] are going on in the world
[55:16] today um that it can actually be
[55:20] overwhelming if you just look at it so
[55:24] much negative uh uh in in the land um
[55:30] and uh I I tell you Satan is working
[55:33] over
[55:34] time um you know um he's uh because he
[55:40] knows his time is up how many knows his
[55:43] time is
[55:44] up not your time but his time but he
[55:49] wants to make us think our time is up
[55:51] but his time is up and so he is working
[55:54] over time and people are left devastated
[55:58] whether it be by national events
[56:00] International or whether it be just be
[56:02] personal events uh Church events or
[56:05] whatever but they're they're left
[56:08] devastated confused worried broken
[56:13] frustrated um and it could be about the
[56:16] job it could be politics religion it it
[56:19] just don't matter it just seem like
[56:21] everybody's got a sad story to tell
[56:23] these days and uh um uh you know
[56:29] and if you know if we had a a uh
[56:34] confession you know I'm I'm sure all of
[56:36] us here could really give give some
[56:40] stories of what we were going through or
[56:43] been going through and um I'm sure then
[56:46] we'd try to top one of them off you know
[56:49] as as we go and um you know it's kind of
[56:52] like um one one uh they were having a
[56:56] testimony service in a Pentecostal
[56:58] church and uh everybody got to talking
[57:02] and one guy said well I just want to
[57:04] thank the Lord for saving me he said I
[57:06] was so bad that everybody every all my
[57:08] friends were scared of me you know and
[57:11] and um you know and then another one got
[57:13] up and well I was so bad that the town
[57:15] was scared of me you know and it was
[57:17] just getting really bad finally the
[57:19] pastor got up and say I got to fix this
[57:21] you know he goes well I'm going to tell
[57:22] y'all right now I was so bad even the
[57:24] devil was scared of me and so uh you
[57:27] know but but everybody uh we just so
[57:31] many things in the negative but I am I'm
[57:34] truly glad that uh we have a father that
[57:38] cares about us he he knows uh he cares
[57:42] for us and and he cares so much for us
[57:46] that he promised to never leave us nor
[57:48] forsake us but that he would be with us
[57:51] uh to the end of the age and he's
[57:54] promised to always be with us he he
[57:57] cares so much for us that that he
[58:00] predestinated us and and which that that
[58:04] truly means that you and I are secured
[58:07] if if you can believe that uh uh he's he
[58:11] secured us because in this
[58:13] predestination he he called us but not
[58:16] only called us he chose us not only did
[58:19] he choose us he justified us and not
[58:21] only did he justify us he glorified us
[58:24] so it's already taken care care of um
[58:27] you you haven't reached your
[58:28] glorification but but you know that it's
[58:31] already taken care of and that's where
[58:33] we're headed and that's what gives us
[58:35] hope in in a hopeless age uh when when
[58:39] there's nothing to believe in yet we
[58:41] believe in it because we we've been
[58:44] predestinated and if you don't believe
[58:46] in predestination I don't know how you
[58:48] going to have faith amen because that's
[58:50] just the way it is but uh uh we were
[58:54] pre-planned uh uh that's the only way he
[58:57] could have predestinated us as we were
[59:00] pre-planned uh so God's plan is not he's
[59:03] not just coming up with something as we
[59:05] go along it was already done before we
[59:08] ever come here and and so then as the
[59:12] prophet would tell us we are the
[59:13] premeditated thoughts of God and and so
[59:17] uh uh Ephesians 1 and4 according he as
[59:21] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[59:24] foundation of the world that we should
[59:26] be holy Without Blame before him in love
[59:30] having predestinated us unto the
[59:33] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[59:35] himself according to the good pleasure
[59:37] of his will no one made him to do this
[59:40] this was out of the good pleasure of his
[59:42] will it pleased him to choose you it
[59:45] pleased him to predestinate you and and
[59:48] and and so and it pleased him to secure
[59:50] you it pleases him to be with you it it
[59:54] pleases him to go in the valley ales
[59:56] with you and and in your trials with you
[59:58] and in the darkest times of your life it
[1:00:01] pleases him to go with you amen and and
[1:00:05] um uh no one is making him do such and
[1:00:07] so brother brandham said God is true to
[1:00:10] his promise how many believes that God
[1:00:13] is true to his promise no matter what he
[1:00:16] has to do bankrupt the heavens he will
[1:00:19] before he would let his word go defeated
[1:00:22] he never made a promise that he cannot
[1:00:25] keep and this predestination is nothing
[1:00:28] but promises about your life he promised
[1:00:31] amen if if he Glory If he if he called
[1:00:34] you that's a promise if he chose you
[1:00:36] that's a promise if he justified you
[1:00:39] that's a promise if he glorified you
[1:00:41] that's a promise and he'll B bankrupt
[1:00:44] heaven to make sure that that promise
[1:00:46] comes to pass amen see so God prepared
[1:00:50] everything for us ahead of time he
[1:00:53] prepared this Earth because he knew that
[1:00:55] we were coming he he as as the prophet
[1:00:58] said he some like the valley some like
[1:01:00] mountains some like deserts some like
[1:01:03] whatever and he created this he prepared
[1:01:05] this for for us his children see amen
[1:01:09] and and so he prepared the Earth and and
[1:01:12] he he actually prepared our makeup our
[1:01:16] our way of of of what we are our being
[1:01:19] and What Makes Us tick he he prepared
[1:01:22] that Amen brother Bram said you were in
[1:01:25] God's thinking and he might have had to
[1:01:27] breed this with that and down here and
[1:01:29] down here like a man making Chimes for
[1:01:32] the church puts in so much brass and so
[1:01:35] much iron and he and and gets it just at
[1:01:38] the right pitch see the motor knows how
[1:01:40] to put it in if he doesn't then he
[1:01:42] doesn't get the right gream and
[1:01:45] sometimes we think that we're a mistake
[1:01:47] sometimes that we think oh uh I'm I'm
[1:01:49] just nut but just a a a flub and and a
[1:01:52] uh a a a failure no you're not God made
[1:01:56] you exactly the way you are so that he
[1:02:00] could get the right tune the right thing
[1:02:03] out of your life ain't that right now
[1:02:06] many many times we become a hindrance to
[1:02:09] the will of God uh uh and and that is uh
[1:02:13] because uh we get in the way of God but
[1:02:16] that does not mean that God made a
[1:02:18] mistake in how he made us see so we just
[1:02:22] have to fully surrender ourselves so
[1:02:24] that he can use us to what he uh deems
[1:02:28] best for our lives amen amen and and
[1:02:32] that is the truth so he prepares these
[1:02:34] things he's prepared a lamb for us he
[1:02:36] prepared an atonement for us he prepared
[1:02:39] the high priest for us uh to intercede
[1:02:42] uh uh for for our our sins and our
[1:02:46] confession he prepared healing for us he
[1:02:49] prepared deliverance and victory and and
[1:02:52] salvation for us and he's even prepared
[1:02:55] a city for us John didn't just see a
[1:02:58] city coming down he saw a city prepared
[1:03:01] amen for us can you say Amen he's
[1:03:05] prepared a place for us for he says I go
[1:03:08] away uh that that where I am you may be
[1:03:12] also and he say I go to prepare a place
[1:03:14] for you ain't that right amen so it it's
[1:03:17] it's all preparing God is already into
[1:03:20] our future and and he's already seen it
[1:03:24] and he's already working in our future
[1:03:25] future he's already and he's guiding us
[1:03:28] to where amen that he has prepared amen
[1:03:32] he prepared a way for us to go from the
[1:03:35] sand of the sea to to shining as stars
[1:03:38] of the heaven God prepared a way amen
[1:03:42] for that see because he cares for us if
[1:03:45] we could just get that into our hearts
[1:03:48] and and and really really uh uh be
[1:03:51] satisfied with his preparation for us
[1:03:55] and and ready that God knows everything
[1:03:58] about us amen he knows and he cares
[1:04:02] everything that we have need of was
[1:04:04] redeemed at Calvary amen Jesus Christ as
[1:04:07] we know paid the price of redemption and
[1:04:10] gave us everything that belongs to us
[1:04:14] now you think of that you before you
[1:04:16] could have made the decision before you
[1:04:18] could have said God I want it he's
[1:04:20] already prepared it he prepared it amen
[1:04:24] and and paid the price of redemption
[1:04:27] that that when Satan would come to you
[1:04:29] and tell you you're a nobody and and and
[1:04:31] that you'll never make it and you could
[1:04:33] look at Calvary and say but Satan the
[1:04:36] price was paid for and it was given to
[1:04:39] me at Calvary everything that Christ
[1:04:42] redeemed is mine and you don't belong
[1:04:45] and you have no right to it anymore amen
[1:04:48] you see Christianity is based on the
[1:04:51] finished works of Christ do you believe
[1:04:54] that it's not based upon on Promises of
[1:04:56] tomorrow it's based on the finished work
[1:04:59] of Christ amen that's what your
[1:05:01] Christianity is amen if you need
[1:05:04] salvation this morning you cannot be
[1:05:07] saved and and and you think of that now
[1:05:09] the brother brandom said that and that
[1:05:11] must have been a profound statement that
[1:05:13] morning when he said it that if you need
[1:05:15] salvation this morning you cannot be
[1:05:17] saved but he said look you would have to
[1:05:20] accept your salvation that was paid for
[1:05:22] you 1900 years ago see Jesus saved you
[1:05:26] when he died that's when you he saved
[1:05:29] you but you have to accept it when he
[1:05:32] knocks at your heart and then you accept
[1:05:34] your salvation can you say Amen how
[1:05:37] many's accepted your salvation I I've
[1:05:40] accepted what he done at Calvary amen
[1:05:43] see well then you accept your salvation
[1:05:45] you accept Jesus as your personal savior
[1:05:48] well that goes with healing if you need
[1:05:50] healing this morning you you can't get
[1:05:52] healed the only way you what you can do
[1:05:54] is you can accept your healing he's
[1:05:56] already healed you 2,000 years ago amen
[1:06:00] you you say well I need help well you
[1:06:02] can't get help this morning in in that
[1:06:04] way he's already done that amen if you
[1:06:07] need Deliverance he's already delivered
[1:06:09] you amen if you need it he's already
[1:06:12] done it it's your faith is based upon a
[1:06:15] finished work of Calvary amen God ain't
[1:06:18] doing anything right now he's already
[1:06:20] done it amen he's not making a way for
[1:06:23] your salvation he's already done it he's
[1:06:25] not making way for your deliverance he
[1:06:26] already done it he's not making a way
[1:06:28] for you to go in a Rapture he's already
[1:06:30] done it at
[1:06:32] Calvary it's the finished work can you
[1:06:35] say Amen you were healed at Calvary 1
[1:06:39] Peter
[1:06:40] 2:22 who his own self bear our sins in
[1:06:43] his own body on the tree that we being
[1:06:46] dead to sin should live under
[1:06:48] righteousness righteousness by whose
[1:06:51] Tripes ye were healed amen not a can
[1:06:55] continue you were healed were healed
[1:06:59] past tense can you say Amen see so every
[1:07:02] Redemptive blessing amen belongs to the
[1:07:05] believer already that's what he's done
[1:07:07] to prepare for us amen see so then faith
[1:07:11] is not based upon what God is going to
[1:07:13] do oh I've got faith in God well what
[1:07:16] faith are you having in God is it what
[1:07:19] he's going to do no it's not based upon
[1:07:22] what will happen or what is going to
[1:07:25] happen and all of these things it's
[1:07:27] based upon the finished work of Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ at Calvary amen that's where your
[1:07:32] Fai should be directed is at Calvary can
[1:07:35] you sayen Faith knows that I'm Healed
[1:07:38] well how would you know you're healed
[1:07:40] because at Calvary it was paid for amen
[1:07:43] I know I'm saved amen why do I know I'm
[1:07:46] saved because I look at Calvary it was
[1:07:48] paid for amen it was paid for brother
[1:07:53] Bram said Divine Healing is based upon
[1:07:55] the finished work of Jesus Christ at
[1:07:57] Calvary it's a finished work can you say
[1:08:00] that with me it's a finished work it's a
[1:08:02] finished work salvation is the same way
[1:08:05] you wasn't saved last week 40 years ago
[1:08:07] you were saved 1900 years ago when Jesus
[1:08:11] died at Calvary but you accepted your
[1:08:13] pardon so many years ago and so many
[1:08:16] nights ago and so forth amen the same
[1:08:19] way he was wounded for our
[1:08:20] transgressions with this strip we were
[1:08:22] healed it's a past tent
[1:08:26] you know I'm studying about Israel and
[1:08:27] the 144,000 and things and you know
[1:08:30] brother Brown said that God redeemed
[1:08:32] Israel at Calvary too he said the
[1:08:35] problem was they wouldn't accept their
[1:08:37] pardon they they wouldn't accept their
[1:08:39] pardon but he redeemed them just as much
[1:08:42] as he redeemed you at Calvary but here
[1:08:45] we are as Gentiles accepting our pardon
[1:08:48] and one of these days there'll be 144
[1:08:50] Jews that will accept their pardon it
[1:08:52] isn't that Christ will die for them he's
[1:08:55] already already done it but now their
[1:08:57] eyes will come open and see the true
[1:08:59] atonement Christ the lamb but I'm so
[1:09:02] glad that we can see that atonement
[1:09:05] right now and accept everything that
[1:09:07] Christ has done for
[1:09:09] us a finished work yes sir brother Bram
[1:09:13] said see C the Judgment was paid all
[1:09:16] that God required was paid for at
[1:09:20] Calvary and when he died at Calvary he
[1:09:22] bowed his head as far as the Aton was
[1:09:25] made and everything that you've got need
[1:09:28] of in this journey from Earth to Glory
[1:09:29] it was already made ain't that right and
[1:09:32] he screamed it is finished amen it is
[1:09:36] finished that's what he said right it is
[1:09:39] finished he said see there can be
[1:09:41] nothing else added to it nothing else
[1:09:44] taken from it amen you can't add
[1:09:46] anything to to to what Calvary was and
[1:09:49] you can't take anything from it what
[1:09:51] Calvary was he said it is finished amen
[1:09:54] see the the plan of God is finished the
[1:09:57] Bible is finished the atonement is made
[1:10:01] the devil is defeated amen when was he
[1:10:05] defeated 2,000 years ago he was defeated
[1:10:09] in your life 2,000 years ago Amen
[1:10:12] brother BR said you're dealing with a
[1:10:13] defeated enemy that's all we're doing
[1:10:15] we're dealing with a defeated enemy and
[1:10:18] he nothing but a bluff the problem is we
[1:10:21] listen to his lies we listen to things
[1:10:23] that he tells us amen and he ain't got
[1:10:26] no power over us that's how much God
[1:10:30] cares if we can look get your eyes up
[1:10:32] and look at
[1:10:33] Calvary you can see what he's done for
[1:10:36] us God
[1:10:38] cares do you believe it amen it is
[1:10:42] finished in Hebrews 12:2 Paul tells us
[1:10:46] that Christ is sat down at the right
[1:10:49] hand of the Throne of God you see if
[1:10:52] Jesus hadn't finished the job amen then
[1:10:55] the prophet said he would have not sat
[1:10:57] down he said no man sits down until his
[1:11:00] job is over amen but it was finished it
[1:11:03] was so finished that there was nothing
[1:11:05] else for God to do there was no acts of
[1:11:07] redemption left Amen to do at at Calvary
[1:11:11] it was finished so so he sat down at at
[1:11:14] at at the right hand brother Braham said
[1:11:17] see Jesus took his blood he went through
[1:11:20] the heavens of heaven and condemned
[1:11:22] every devil now you think of that that's
[1:11:24] what Jesus Jus done he condemned every
[1:11:27] devil amen not you the devil condemned
[1:11:30] you but Jesus didn't condemn you he
[1:11:33] condemned every devil every devil that
[1:11:37] bothers you Jesus is already condemned
[1:11:40] it's condemned he has no right he has no
[1:11:43] power he has no
[1:11:45] authority Jesus himself condemned
[1:11:49] him condemned every devil took the keys
[1:11:52] of death hell and sat down
[1:11:56] Lord to show us it's
[1:11:58] finished aren't you glad for that it's
[1:12:01] finished so notice when you become a
[1:12:04] Christian the prophet said God gives you
[1:12:06] a checkbook in there with Jesus name
[1:12:09] signed at the bottom of it for
[1:12:11] everything for everything everybody say
[1:12:13] everything come on now don't don't don't
[1:12:16] don't undermine what God has done cannot
[1:12:18] undermine the power of the Cross and the
[1:12:21] power of the blood that was shed amen
[1:12:23] because the blood was shed
[1:12:25] now he's invited you to come and he's
[1:12:28] handed you a checkbook amen he's telling
[1:12:31] you every promise that belongs to you
[1:12:34] amen you don't have to sit there and
[1:12:35] bargain with the devil you don't have to
[1:12:36] sit there and whine about it amen it's
[1:12:39] given to you sign he's already signed
[1:12:42] his
[1:12:43] name he's already signed his name at the
[1:12:46] bottom of it for anything that you've
[1:12:48] got need of while you're in life's
[1:12:50] journey are you afraid to cash it oh my
[1:12:53] don't be afraid to cash it amen don't
[1:12:56] don't be afraid to act a morning he said
[1:12:57] fill it out send it to the hel uh the
[1:12:59] helicopter head headquarters and see
[1:13:02] what God will do about it can you say
[1:13:05] amen amen fill it out fill it out amen
[1:13:08] and then send it back to the
[1:13:10] headquarters and see what God will do I
[1:13:12] guarantee you God will act upon it I
[1:13:14] believe that God will give it to you do
[1:13:16] you believe that God will give it to you
[1:13:18] you should never let your prayer be as
[1:13:20] oh oh God I hope you're going to do it I
[1:13:22] pray it will I don't know that ain't
[1:13:24] even a faith amen that if your faith is
[1:13:26] really amen anchored in true Faith it'll
[1:13:29] be anchored at the finished work of
[1:13:31] Calvary amen there's no guilt there is
[1:13:33] no condemnation there is no devil amen
[1:13:36] that can stand there and can accuse you
[1:13:39] amen before God Amen God has made a a
[1:13:42] way Amen to where you could come and ask
[1:13:45] amen with faith and he will do
[1:13:50] it Lord he
[1:13:52] cares and then Christ sent that back his
[1:13:57] Spirit as an
[1:13:59] Earnest of our
[1:14:02] inheritance in other words it is a down
[1:14:04] payment to let you know that your
[1:14:07] salvation is secure now it's becoming a
[1:14:10] personal thing for God so loved the
[1:14:12] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:14:15] well that's fine amen but but now when
[1:14:17] he gives you the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:19] Ghost amen it's a personal assurance
[1:14:22] that he included you at Calvary can you
[1:14:25] say amen he secured your salvation he
[1:14:29] secured your destiny he secured your
[1:14:31] healing he secured your deliverance he
[1:14:34] secured your your Victory he secured
[1:14:37] everything that you have need of it's in
[1:14:41] the bank write the
[1:14:46] check you know people
[1:14:48] are usually
[1:14:51] applying raising the dead and Healing
[1:14:54] The Sick and C casting out devils and
[1:14:56] speaking in tongues and and all these
[1:14:59] things to the Bible days they say well
[1:15:02] that was in the days of the Bible I you
[1:15:04] may have talked to some of them that
[1:15:06] that that do that it's it was if that
[1:15:08] was in Jesus's day that was all in in
[1:15:11] that day but the prophet said but as
[1:15:13] long as the holy spirit is here we still
[1:15:17] live in the Bible
[1:15:19] days do you understand that you live in
[1:15:22] the Bible days what do you mean are we
[1:15:25] wearing robes are we wearing sandal oh
[1:15:27] no that's not it but the same God that
[1:15:29] was back there is the same God today if
[1:15:32] you need the dead raised he'll raise up
[1:15:34] the dead amen if you need the blind to
[1:15:37] see he'll he'll cause your eyes to come
[1:15:39] open if you need healing of arthritis of
[1:15:42] cancer of whatever it is that same God
[1:15:45] is here to heal
[1:15:47] you why because he's given you the
[1:15:51] earnest earnest can you say amen amen in
[1:15:55] in 2 Corinthians 6:10 Paul would tell us
[1:15:59] that we possess all things everybody say
[1:16:02] we possess all things I possess all
[1:16:05] things we're possessors of all things
[1:16:08] and and that word possess is to have to
[1:16:11] already have not want not looking
[1:16:15] forward to in the future but already
[1:16:17] have it amen see all things to hold as a
[1:16:22] as property to own not not renting not
[1:16:25] borrowing I own it see to have as an
[1:16:29] attribute to seize and take control of
[1:16:32] to take into one's own possession so
[1:16:36] then if we possess all things and we're
[1:16:39] in control of we own it amen then all
[1:16:43] things are ours it's it's ours even this
[1:16:47] Earth Is Ours do you believe that we
[1:16:49] possess this Earth we may not possess
[1:16:52] politics we may not possess the
[1:16:54] government
[1:16:55] of this Earth but we possess a kingdom
[1:16:58] that cannot be shaken we possess the
[1:17:01] Earth Jesus says the meek will shall
[1:17:03] possess uh inherit the Earth where we're
[1:17:06] possessors of it do you believe that so
[1:17:09] so see you may be poor but you're rich
[1:17:12] amen see why because we possess death
[1:17:15] hell the grave because Christ conquered
[1:17:19] it for us this is why Paul would say in
[1:17:21] 1 Corinthians 15:55 oh death where's thy
[1:17:25] sting see grave where is thy Victory The
[1:17:28] Sting of death is sin the strength of
[1:17:30] sin is the law but thanks be to God
[1:17:32] which giveth us the victory through
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ Our Lord see so then
[1:17:39] there's no grave powerful enough to keep
[1:17:41] our body down if we would go by the way
[1:17:44] of the Grave yet we are possessor of
[1:17:47] death we possess the grave the grave
[1:17:49] doesn't possess us death doesn't possess
[1:17:51] us we possess death can you say Amen
[1:17:55] amen this is why Paul would say in 1
[1:17:57] Corinthians
[1:17:58] 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we
[1:18:00] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:18:02] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:18:05] an eye at the last Trump for the Trump
[1:18:07] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:18:10] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:18:13] for this corruptible must put on
[1:18:15] incorruption Amen and this Mortal must
[1:18:17] put on immortality so when this
[1:18:20] corruptible shall put on incorruption
[1:18:22] this Mortal shall put have put on IM
[1:18:24] mortality then shall be brought to pass
[1:18:27] the saying that is written death is
[1:18:30] swallowed up in Victory death you don't
[1:18:33] have to fear death you possess it you
[1:18:38] own it you rule
[1:18:41] it praise the Lord ain't that
[1:18:44] right then the prophet would tell us you
[1:18:47] not only possess things that are
[1:18:50] seen you possess things that are not
[1:18:53] seen amen
[1:18:56] you know in the beginning God wanted
[1:18:59] light yet there was no light to be
[1:19:02] seen no light to be
[1:19:05] had nothing visible to show that there
[1:19:08] was
[1:19:09] light but God being the
[1:19:12] possessor of things that are not
[1:19:15] seen he spoke it the Lord let there be
[1:19:19] light and he brought light out he
[1:19:22] created the light by his creative word
[1:19:25] ain't that right see he possessed it see
[1:19:28] and so just because things cannot be
[1:19:31] seen doesn't mean that they aren't
[1:19:35] there are you with me now I'm I I'm
[1:19:39] talking about you now just because
[1:19:43] things are not seen don't mean they
[1:19:45] can't be had don't mean that it's
[1:19:49] impossible do doesn't mean that it it's
[1:19:51] not there you possess things that cannot
[1:19:55] be
[1:19:57] seen ain't that right see you may not
[1:20:00] see Victory but you possess
[1:20:02] it it's
[1:20:05] there amen you may not see your healing
[1:20:08] but you possess it you may not see the
[1:20:11] Breakthrough that you want and that
[1:20:13] you're needing but you possess
[1:20:15] it can you say Amen you possess it
[1:20:20] that's why God would say ask anything in
[1:20:23] my name amen ask anything what do you
[1:20:27] mean ask things that I can see no ask
[1:20:29] things that you cannot
[1:20:33] see you don't have to live in in in
[1:20:37] defeat just because you cannot see
[1:20:40] Victory doesn't mean you can you have to
[1:20:42] live in defeat you possess things that
[1:20:45] cannot be seen
[1:20:52] ask God want a light the there was no
[1:20:55] light so he just
[1:20:56] quit gave up on his
[1:20:58] dreams it's impossible I can't have it I
[1:21:01] want it but I can't have it no he was
[1:21:03] possessor of things that cannot be
[1:21:06] seen can you say Amen you talking about
[1:21:09] the power of
[1:21:11] Calvary that when Calvary came he
[1:21:14] redeemed it to you he redeemed all
[1:21:17] things to
[1:21:19] you you think he would call you to be a
[1:21:21] Christian and then you live here a
[1:21:23] defeated life and just beat up by the
[1:21:24] devil and can't make it what a God that
[1:21:27] would be but when he redeemed you at
[1:21:30] Calvary he gave it all back to you
[1:21:33] things that are seen things that aren't
[1:21:37] seen can you say Amen now what right
[1:21:41] what right do we have to lay claim to
[1:21:43] the promises of God what right do we
[1:21:45] have to
[1:21:47] act as though we possess all things what
[1:21:51] right do we have to act like we're Kings
[1:21:56] we were born like Beggars ppers and now
[1:21:59] we act like kings prise the Lord that
[1:22:01] looks hypocrisy oh no not if you're a
[1:22:04] child of God not if your faith is based
[1:22:07] upon a finished work yes sir Calvary not
[1:22:10] only made you a church member Calvary
[1:22:12] not only saved you so you'd come to
[1:22:14] church and learn about God Calvary
[1:22:16] brought you to a place of
[1:22:20] kingship that you could act like God
[1:22:23] that you could speak like God that you
[1:22:25] can live like
[1:22:28] God see we possess a kingdom right how
[1:22:33] many believes we possess a kingdom
[1:22:35] through Calvary we possess a
[1:22:38] kingdom they talk about politic they
[1:22:40] talk about all this stuff it's a joke a
[1:22:43] j they really think they've got power
[1:22:45] but you got power you got more power
[1:22:47] than
[1:22:51] Angels Hallelujah
[1:22:54] you believe it you know they talk about
[1:22:57] these UFOs unidentified now we know what
[1:23:00] they are brother Ram said they're Angels
[1:23:03] investigating
[1:23:05] Angels but they they've taken pictures
[1:23:07] of these
[1:23:08] UFOs in in hurricanes in
[1:23:12] tornadoes and and one of them right in a
[1:23:14] hurricane in the middle of a hurricane

[1:23:28] stood there that was power that that was
[1:23:31] something that was Supernatural that has
[1:23:33] so baffled the human mind even the
[1:23:36] smartest men they don't know how that
[1:23:38] can do that and then disappear just like
[1:23:41] that with such speed that we don't even
[1:23:43] know about we can't even comprehend that
[1:23:46] type of speed and yet they can do that
[1:23:49] there's a supernatural so there they
[1:23:51] know there's a supernatural element
[1:23:53] there that they cannot explain but how
[1:23:55] much more Supernatural do you have to

[1:27:28] Jesus says many good works have I showed
[1:27:31] you from my father many good works
[1:27:33] because Jesus was not without works amen
[1:27:37] see and and and and so brother brandom
[1:27:39] said now notice the works that he did
[1:27:43] were ordained of God to inspire faith in
[1:27:46] him for it was a great part of his
[1:27:50] ministry amen not just sitting on a Pew
[1:27:53] not just saying amen not just preaching
[1:27:55] a little sermonette and not just but but
[1:27:58] good works amen he manifested The Works
[1:28:01] of the father he said the works that I
[1:28:03] do is not me but it's my father that
[1:28:05] dwells on me in me ain't that right so
[1:28:07] so he manifested the works good works
[1:28:10] see well we have been created unto good
[1:28:15] works can you say Amen see and this
[1:28:18] creation comes by the creative word of
[1:28:22] God and not by sex
[1:28:25] Blood by sex blood of your father is

[1:28:38] on Church you were born in in the
[1:28:41] chicken yard you you were just born I
[1:28:44] mean it it you there was nothing about
[1:28:47] your first birth that was any positive
[1:28:49] about you at all ain't that right and
[1:28:52] you were condemned but we were created
[1:28:56] Created unto good works and it that
[1:28:59] creation did not come by sex blood but
[1:29:02] it come by the creative word of God can
[1:29:05] you say for what good works could come
[1:29:06] by sex blood amen you might be a genius
[1:29:09] you might get the world together and and
[1:29:11] and get it all well they're they're
[1:29:13] going to get a one world government and
[1:29:15] all these things amen and they call that
[1:29:17] good works but it's all bringing the
[1:29:19] wrath of God upon them can you say man
[1:29:21] so the good works that a man can do amen
[1:29:25] he he could he could give his arms and
[1:29:27] he could he could uh feed the poor and
[1:29:29] he could have charity functions and he
[1:29:31] could have missions and he could do
[1:29:34] everything uh well they're all doing it
[1:29:36] you got the movie stars you got uh uh
[1:29:39] well Trump and you got all kinds of
[1:29:41] people giving billions millions of
[1:29:43] dollars out here to all these things and
[1:29:45] that's fine amen but that's not the good
[1:29:48] works that Jesus is talking about amen
[1:29:51] you had to come amen through the blood
[1:29:54] to come into this good
[1:29:56] works we were created in Jesus
[1:30:00] Christ can you say Amen created in Jesus
[1:30:04] Christ unto good works now now now
[1:30:07] notice what brother BR said these Works
[1:30:09] were to inspire faith in him the works
[1:30:13] the works that we have been created unto
[1:30:16] was to is in to inspire faith in him as
[1:30:20] they would show forth that relationship
[1:30:24] to him can you say Amen so so we can
[1:30:27] give arms to feed the poor we we can
[1:30:29] give things out out in the world and we
[1:30:31] can be involved in this and and in that
[1:30:34] and and and in this function and that
[1:30:36] function to help the the needy and then
[1:30:39] and that's that's just fine amen but
[1:30:41] them do not tie you Amen to relationship
[1:30:45] with the father but the works that Jesus
[1:30:48] did tithed him in relationship to the
[1:30:52] father can you say Amen for one place
[1:30:54] they said no man can do these things
[1:30:56] that you do we know that thou art a
[1:30:58] teacher from God we know you come from
[1:31:00] God you you have to be cuz no man can do
[1:31:03] the works that you do can you sayen well
[1:31:06] that's the good works that you have been
[1:31:08] created unto is to show amen give the
[1:31:11] people faith in him because it shows
[1:31:15] that there's a relationship between you
[1:31:18] and the
[1:31:20] father there's a lot of people going to
[1:31:22] church and living defeated lives Liv
[1:31:24] that's right can you say Amen but how do
[1:31:27] you show God in
[1:31:31] that a lot of people talking
[1:31:34] negative well you know how it
[1:31:37] is it's it's there but see these Works
[1:31:41] were to inspire faith in him as they
[1:31:44] would show forth that relationship to
[1:31:46] him that Paul described as created in
[1:31:50] him now notice 2 Corinthians 5:17
[1:31:53] therefore if any man be in Christ he is
[1:31:55] a new creature or a new
[1:31:58] creation old things everybody say old

[1:38:49] grandfather and he was just a a genuine
[1:38:53] good man but he a lot of hurts down the
[1:38:56] road because he was good to people he
[1:38:59] got beat up one time and and might have
[1:39:03] even been a couple times and and just
[1:39:06] one thing after another and finally he
[1:39:08] got bitter and that's that's what I
[1:39:11] remember of my grandpa just a bitter man
[1:39:14] and and I I remember one time I I I've
[1:39:18] watched my dad he was kicked out of
[1:39:20] church and several times a couple times
[1:39:23] out the Pastor's house and and uh oh

[1:39:28] church and and they did not like my dad
[1:39:31] uh lot of a lot of some of the people in
[1:39:32] the church because they were attacking
[1:39:34] the pastor my dad stood with the pastor
[1:39:36] and and so Dad stood between them and
[1:39:39] the pastor and and they tried to sway
[1:39:41] him and he wouldn't be swayed and so
[1:39:43] they turned against him and and I
[1:39:45] remember all this stuff as as a
[1:39:47] preacher's kid amen and and I I remember
[1:39:50] my dad uh telling Mom one time and
[1:39:53] probably didn't even think I was
[1:39:54] listening amen but he said you know jene
[1:39:57] he said you know bitterness tries to
[1:39:58] gets a hold of my heart so much amen and
[1:40:01] and and tries to take me down and and I
[1:40:03] want to get so bitter toward people and
[1:40:05] so bitter but he says I remember my dad
[1:40:08] and and and what it did to him and how
[1:40:10] it affected him and and and he said jene
[1:40:13] I tell the devil every day I don't have
[1:40:15] to be that way I will not be bitter I
[1:40:17] will not give in to you can you say man
[1:40:20] there's a time that we stand and say I

[1:40:40] full of love and so full of grace toward
[1:40:43] people and I say I refuse to be bitter I
[1:40:46] refuse amen by Jesus Christ I refuse

[1:41:37] ouse it's not a a new creation uh not
[1:41:41] the new creation is not an old creation
[1:41:43] made over or it could not be called a
[1:41:45] new creation this is exactly what it
[1:41:48] says it is New Creation it is another
[1:41:51] creation distinct from the old one no
[1:41:54] longer is he dealing by the ways of
[1:41:57] Flesh that was how he dealt with Israel
[1:41:59] he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue
[1:42:03] uh through Godly Isaac uh line see but
[1:42:07] uh uh but now out of every kindered

[1:44:25] as author of this new creation of God
[1:44:28] his Sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:44:30] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:44:33] of this new creation he predestinated
[1:44:35] them to the adoption of children
[1:44:37] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:44:39] will and by his omniscience and
[1:44:41] omnipotence he brought it to

[1:46:38] going to praise God
[1:46:39] anymore you ain't going to look at the
[1:46:41] promises
[1:46:43] anymore if he has his way you won't even
[1:46:45] pray no more if he has a real way you
[1:46:48] won't even be in the house of God no
[1:46:50] more

[1:46:54] really has his way
[1:46:57] oh he'll get you to kill
[1:47:03] yourself it
[1:47:09] hello so brother Bram said your old life
[1:47:12] has to die everybody say my old life has
[1:47:14] to
[1:47:15] die and the new one has to be born again
[1:47:19] and then see you're no more the creature
[1:47:22] you was at
[1:47:24] all the devil has no more rights to me
[1:47:28] no wonder I stand
[1:47:30] Justified as though I never did
[1:47:33] it I'm not that creature that I used to
[1:47:39] be that's when you become uh come behind
[1:47:43] the blood fortified with the word don't
[1:47:45] try to explain nothing just believe it
[1:47:47] and go on just say Lord I believe savior
[1:47:51] raise my faith in thee till I can move a
[1:47:54] mountain I just believe it well Satan
[1:47:57] get you to reason well but look at what
[1:47:59] this and I don't care I just believe it
[1:48:01] I believe it I believe it everybody say
[1:48:03] I believe I now it's more than just
[1:48:04] saying I believe it you go home and you
[1:48:06] believe it you act like you believe it
[1:48:08] you live like you believe it you speak
[1:48:11] like you believe it
[1:48:13] believe that's right
[1:48:17] Hallelujah Romans 8:1 there there is
[1:48:20] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:48:22] which are in Christ
[1:48:23] Jesus no condemnation to that new
[1:48:27] creation in Christ Jesus those that are
[1:48:30] created in Christ Jesus there's no
[1:48:32] condemnation to
[1:48:34] them that's true who walk not after the
[1:48:37] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[1:48:40] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:48:42] hath made me free from the law of sin
[1:48:45] and death now if you bear with me this
[1:48:48] creation that we're speaking of this new
[1:48:50] creation it comes by rebirth
[1:48:53] see 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of
[1:48:56] corruptible seed sex seed sex act see of
[1:49:00] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by
[1:49:02] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:49:04] forever ain't that right see so our new
[1:49:07] birth comes from an Incorruptible seed
[1:49:11] which is the word of God that's the part
[1:49:14] that's
[1:49:16] predestinated that's the part that will
[1:49:18] never change that's the part that God
[1:49:21] will bake up a bankrupt heaven to bring
[1:49:24] the pass that's right this other life's
[1:49:28] going to
[1:49:32] die and you say Amen so so by the word
[1:49:35] of God now brother Bram said we did not
[1:49:37] become seed by rebirth we were seed
[1:49:40] therefore we're reborn for only the
[1:49:43] elect can be reborn because we were seed
[1:49:47] is the reason we could be quickened in
[1:49:49] nonseed there is nothing to
[1:49:51] Quicken they can dance they can shout
[1:49:53] they can do whatever but there's nothing
[1:49:55] to Quicken but when the emotions are
[1:49:58] gone when your shouting is over and and
[1:50:00] and and your feeling is over and you
[1:50:03] don't feel like you're going to make it
[1:50:04] there is something down inside that's
[1:50:07] being
[1:50:09] quickened
[1:50:10] [Applause]
[1:50:11] right so God put a word seed Jean seed
[1:50:16] in us do you believe that I believe it's
[1:50:20] amazing brother Brandon did not preach
[1:50:21] about Jean seed did not even mention
[1:50:23] Jean seed until the I think the last six
[1:50:26] sermons of his life and then he's just a
[1:50:29] jean seed Jean seed Jean seed Jean
[1:50:31] seed
[1:50:34] Amen brother Ram said see inside of your
[1:50:37] spirit you've got a soul and that soul
[1:50:41] is that Gene that come from
[1:50:44] God another place the third Rim is is
[1:50:48] the soul you got your flesh spirit and
[1:50:50] then the Soul that's predestinated by
[1:50:53] God there is where the real G uh seed
[1:50:57] germ lays is in
[1:51:00] there now notice another place in God's
[1:51:03] own mind we are a germ of the gene of
[1:51:07] God we
[1:51:12] are so then the Soul is the real
[1:51:18] you that Soul that's been quickened
[1:51:24] Hallelujah hello
[1:51:26] amen now in order to get back to the
[1:51:30] original God has to speak
[1:51:32] again that's what he does when he gives
[1:51:35] you New Birth your old life is gone and
[1:51:39] you're back to the original word of the
[1:51:45] Lord I hope this is making sense to you
[1:51:47] in some
[1:51:48] way you're back everybody say I'm back
[1:51:52] I'm back I've
[1:51:54] arrived honey I'm
[1:51:58] home you're back to the original word of
[1:52:03] the
[1:52:04] Lord yeah before you got s you was just
[1:52:08] defeated Satan just let he you would
[1:52:11] just a slave that old stupid
[1:52:13] devil but that's not what the word of
[1:52:15] God called you to be you were so Laden
[1:52:18] down with sins and depression and
[1:52:24] you had no
[1:52:25] hope you live for this life prise the
[1:52:29] Lord but that wasn't what God called you
[1:52:32] to do down inside there was that c Gene
[1:52:37] and then it was
[1:52:39] quickened now that old life is gone and
[1:52:43] you've come back to the original word of
[1:52:46] the Lord Sons and Daughters of God
[1:52:53] how dare we live like or act like or
[1:52:56] talk like we're sons and say we're sons
[1:52:59] and then live below our
[1:53:02] privileges live as though we have no
[1:53:04] hope live as oh I've been changed I've
[1:53:08] been reborn and we live in the dumps and
[1:53:11] we live depressed and we live and the
[1:53:14] devil is infecting our lives till we
[1:53:17] ain't got nothing to live
[1:53:19] for about it Hallelujah come on now
[1:53:24] you're back to the original
[1:53:26] word everybody say I'm
[1:53:30] back to that original
[1:53:33] word now brother Bram says in another
[1:53:36] place we have become from Mortal beings
[1:53:38] from time beings to Eternal beings when
[1:53:40] the word of God lit our souls and we
[1:53:43] become Sons and Daughters of God with
[1:53:46] the attributes the gene of God in us to
[1:53:49] be Sons and Daughters of the Father God
[1:53:52] God in heaven crying Abba
[1:53:55] Father Can you say Amen so so listen
[1:53:59] we're not just
[1:54:00] Christians in the way the world thinks
[1:54:03] of a Christian and considers a Christian
[1:54:06] to be but we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:54:10] God which means we are part of
[1:54:14] God can you say Amen we are not trying
[1:54:18] to be sons of God right it's it's like
[1:54:22] the apple seed is not trying to produce
[1:54:25] the tree and trying to produce the
[1:54:28] apples it's already within it it has the
[1:54:32] authority to be what God called it to
[1:54:37] be there's a law of life within it it
[1:54:41] possesses life it possesses a certain
[1:54:44] nature it possesses a law and it just
[1:54:47] brings forth of its kind and we are of
[1:54:51] the same material like God we are of the
[1:54:55] same material as God is we are power of
[1:54:59] his power word of his word life of his
[1:55:03] life Romans 8:29 for whom he did for
[1:55:07] know them he also did predestinate to be
[1:55:09] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:55:11] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:55:13] Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:55:15] predestinate them he also called and
[1:55:17] whom he called he also Justified and
[1:55:19] whom he justified them he also glorified
[1:55:21] what shall we say say to these things if
[1:55:23] God before us who can be against us if
[1:55:26] the situation is against us then then if
[1:55:29] God before us then there is no situation
[1:55:31] amen that is against us that can that
[1:55:33] can affect
[1:55:36] us can you say Amen now this Bible is
[1:55:39] prophetic do you believe that amen it's
[1:55:42] full of Prophecy uh second Peter 1:21
[1:55:44] for the prophecy came not in Old Time by
[1:55:47] the will of man but but holy men of God
[1:55:50] spake as they were moved by the holy
[1:55:52] ghost now what is prophecy then prophecy
[1:55:55] is to foretell to forecast to call it
[1:55:58] before it happens so our life amen and
[1:56:02] I'm getting ready close now but our life
[1:56:04] was already foretold in the
[1:56:09] scriptures you you think that the Bible
[1:56:12] only spoke of of the tribulation and
[1:56:15] foret toed of of the heathens and for
[1:56:18] toad of judgment and for toad of you
[1:56:21] know uh
[1:56:22] whatever of the world condition The Way
[1:56:25] It Is Well it for told of all that but
[1:56:27] it also within all of this it for tells
[1:56:30] of
[1:56:31] you
[1:56:33] amen and you say Amen see so here we
[1:56:37] come now in this day not to try to be
[1:56:42] what was
[1:56:43] prophesied we ain't trying at
[1:56:46] all we're not trying to become Sons and
[1:56:49] Daughters of God we're not trying to be
[1:56:51] Christians we're not trying to be the
[1:56:53] manifestation of the sons of God we
[1:56:55] already
[1:56:59] are amen 1 John 3:2 beloved now we are
[1:57:04] the sons of God so then the word seed
[1:57:07] that predestinated Gene seed of God
[1:57:09] inside of us is now matching every
[1:57:12] prophecy that was spoke of in this Bible
[1:57:16] That's Right amen can you say amen I
[1:57:20] wish I could go on wished I had the time
[1:57:23] good preach but you can take a little
[1:57:25] apple
[1:57:26] seed just take the apple
[1:57:30] seed and if you know all about that a
[1:57:33] tree take a man that really knows apples
[1:57:36] trees and all that and knows everybody
[1:57:38] that he can take that apple seed and
[1:57:40] tell you what kind of apples it's going
[1:57:41] to produce what kind of bark is going to
[1:57:44] be on that tree he could probably tell
[1:57:46] you just the standard size of that tree
[1:57:48] and how it's going to be he could tell
[1:57:50] you all about that just by knowing what
[1:57:52] seed that is why because he's been able
[1:57:55] to study other ones just like
[1:57:59] it ain't that
[1:58:05] right now
[1:58:07] Church brother brandham there's a reason
[1:58:10] why brother brandham told stories in the
[1:58:12] Bible he constantly pulling up stories
[1:58:14] of this Bible
[1:58:16] amen
[1:58:18] why I believe God had him to do it so
[1:58:21] you would
[1:58:22] know what you're going to
[1:58:25] be praise the Lord right David slew his
[1:58:30] giant David slew The Lion and the bear
[1:58:36] Joshua spoke and called the son to stand
[1:58:40] still
[1:58:41] shamard took an ox
[1:58:44] gold and slew 600 Philistines I believe
[1:58:47] it was Yeah by himself amen Samson took
[1:58:52] the gates of a city when it was they
[1:58:54] were trapping him and he just took the
[1:58:56] gates of City off its hinges and walked
[1:58:58] up the hill with
[1:59:00] it ain't that right Samson took a
[1:59:04] Jawbone of a donkey and slew a thousand
[1:59:09] Philistines we could go on and on and
[1:59:13] on what does it tell us we're part of
[1:59:18] this that Jean seed that's in us we're
[1:59:21] part part of it am that's the way you're
[1:59:24] to be sister Brenda that's the way
[1:59:26] you're to be that's right sister Rihanna
[1:59:29] that's the way you're to be you're part
[1:59:31] of this thing I cannot say I cannot look
[1:59:34] at your life and say you're a defeated
[1:59:36] person I cannot say that that's not your
[1:59:37] future because you're part of what was
[1:59:40] in the book this is what your prophecy
[1:59:43] is God's called you ordained you to
[1:59:46] overcome your
[1:59:48] enemy God's called us to ordain he's or
[1:59:52] dained us to be this we can't be nothing
[1:59:56] else God showed us no matter how many
[1:59:59] Devils come no matter how strong the
[2:00:01] enemy was Samson took a thousand of them
[2:00:04] and defeated them how many spirits may
[2:00:06] be coming against you but you'll stand
[2:00:09] there because it's in your jean
[2:00:11] seat it's in
[2:00:15] there God look at
[2:00:19] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon
[2:00:22] on them God planted a seed it was a
[2:00:24] Pentecostal Church a Pentecostal
[2:00:27] seed man look what they done they were
[2:00:31] so quickened by the Holy Ghost to where
[2:00:34] that Phillip he was preaching a meeting
[2:00:36] and then in the middle of that meeting
[2:00:37] was translated and was not found over
[2:00:40] there he was found over hundreds of
[2:00:41] miles away in another
[2:00:43] place so
[2:00:46] Quicken read the book of
[2:00:48] Acts not one devil could defeat them
[2:00:52] prise the
[2:00:54] lordes Paul and Silas they're Bound by

[2:03:15] brother brandham talked about that slave
[2:03:17] that was taken from Africa and he was
[2:03:20] taken over here into America Amica as a
[2:03:23] slave and there he
[2:03:26] worked you know and and and finally
[2:03:29] someone come and he was want to buy some
[2:03:32] slaves
[2:03:35] and he looked at the owner of the slaves
[2:03:39] and he saw this this one man and his his
[2:03:43] back was bleeding just as much as the
[2:03:45] others but he had his shoulders squared
[2:03:49] his head high the smile on his face
[2:03:53] Standing Tall while the others was just
[2:03:57] bent down under the load and just oh
[2:04:00] just barely going but he he was
[2:04:03] different and that that man says I want
[2:04:05] to buy that guy yeah he says oh no you
[2:04:08] can't have him he said he ain't for sale
