love the Lord amen amen uh the musicians can be dismissed and um appreciate our young people people there and lending their talents to the Lord and amen being willing to do something for the Lord amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Revelations the 2 chapter and the 8th verse Revelations 2 and8 praise the Lord and it says um um actually let's go Revelations uh 211 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and he that overcome shall not be hurt of the second death amen then uh go with me to Revelations the 20th chapter and the sixth verse Revelations 20 and six says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years amen let's just bow our heads father truly it's in your presence Lord that things happen lives are changed and we're so thankful to be part of that to be Witnesses of your your your presence Lord I pray that you would be with us now as we would Endeavor to minister to your people I pray father you'd help me get myself out of the way and Lord that you could just use these mortal lips father and to speak your words of life to your people and pray Lord that you'd help the people to to understand Lord and Lord make your scriptures clear to us father Lord draw us closer as our prayer in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening and um I guess if I had a title be the second death has no power and we'll try to um not keep you long uh this evening but I do think it amazing how God shows his goodness to us and um he's all the time you know trying to show his love to us and his mercy and uh but here in the the first reading um there in in the second chapter of Revelations uh God is rewarding those who overcome and um I um I I think the um God is looking for Overcomers in this age and amen um the ones it's it's the Overcomers who who overcome the age that they live in and of course we realize that we're living in the Le odsan age so this is the age that we've got to overcome and and and this is the age of lukewarmness and so brother Ram said each son out of each Church age overcome the temptation of that age and so we we understand the temptation of the age is is lukewarmness to to keep us religious but yet um uh keep us without there's really the the power of God and and uh what God has for us but the Overcomer is the one who that God can put his hand upon as a witness in the Earth and and uh so then that that means that there we it's it's a challenge for us to come up higher than just being religious uh but that God could make us a witness uh here on in this leodys and age there has always been the prophet said an overcomer that's come out of each age God has always had a witness and and he still has his Witnesses today but it's been very few uh very few Overcomers um if you listen to the message how can I overcome the prophet talks about it and and there were like only eight Overcomers in Noah's day um and he said there's no doubt perhaps millions of people in that age and and you think of that millions of people but only eight Overcomers uh and he says they were genuine they they were eight real genuine Overcomers if you look in the days of of Daniel and um uh brother Brown said there was only four Overcomers in that age that could stand the test of fire and lion and of course the Bible says that he that cometh to God must first be tried it must be first must be tested and and for you young people to remember that that that there's always going to be testings and I buddy them them testings can be the can be hard um testings uh require us to have faith require us to Be steady require us to stay true uh because uh we don't have an infinite mind that we don't know uh we we can't we can't figure it out it's not like a math problem 4 + 4 is 8 it's it's not like that but but it requires us to trust God that he knows what he's doing and so brother brandom says see that that only shows a true child then seed to be tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and so God loves us and and God wants the best out of us but you see the war that is going on is Satan is bragging that he can take us out you know the story of job right uh Satan was bragging about job and and saying you know if you just take off the Hedge from him of course he's got it made he's got it easy but you you you just let me have him for a little bit and I'll get him to curse you to your face and uh and but God was bragging on Joel and he says yeah go right ahead and try it you know so God sent job through some trials but it it wasn't it and and of course it was Al it was definitely beneficial for job for for in the end he says I've heard of thee with the hearing of the year but now my I see a the so job received great Revelation in in during them times but it's it was in them times that he had to stay true to God and I mean his his friends were were criticizing him and saying it's all your fault and and his his wife even said you know what job give up man just curse God and die get it over with you know and and so those that were intimate around him uh uh uh was really the ones that was really putting him to the test and so to speak of course he lost his children he lost everything and and all of these things but uh but God was really just it was It was a battle not with job at all the Bible says that job's heart was perfect it it was between God and the devil and job just happened to be the guy that was picked and so um and and and actually God is the one that brought job's name up you know and so um uh anyways but James 1:12 it says blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life with which the Lord has promised to them that love him ain't that right so every Overcomer has to be put to the test and and uh the the the size of of of the Bride in Daniel's age if you want to call that or elect was four people uh uh that that was Daniel and and meach Shadrach and abedo and and yet the prophet said there was about 2 million people of the Jews uh there in in in uh captivity as well as the Ford but they're the only ones that overcome brother Brandon would even include uh in lot's day and how that there were only three Overcomers in lot's in lot's time uh uh that was lot and his daughters and and you remember Lot's wife started out right she she was leaving too uh but then she uh uh turned around and looked back and and and that's that's something that we we got to think about is that she made her choice to leave but after a little bit she couldn't stand it she had to look back and so um and and brother Bram said many of you have has left too many of youve uh left the things to take your stand after you search it through the scripture and find it's right you've seen the Vindication of almighty God not by some what somebody said uh but what was vindication see what the Bible said would be and here it is doing it you saw it was the truth so you set out to leave Sodom leave the denomination leave the things that bind you to a Creed and to follow Christ by the Holy Spirit vindicating himself by the written word of God other words you took the Bible instead of the Creed ain't that right but see it wasn't in her heart to leave she left but it wasn't in her heart to leave and so brother Brown said she still loved the world so it's possible he says that you can make a start and still be the world in you you can leave the world and yet the world still be in you see she never overcome and even though she was well on the road it finally overthrow her see she had to take that one big long last look and that's where she got caught so don't even look back don't have no desire keep going put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ can you say Amen you see that when you do start out and you and you're and you're starting to serve the Lord and and things the devil will always throw it into your facei of of what good is it doing you what what what rewards is there what what benefits is there what if what if you you you give your whole life to God and and then nothing uh uh uh transforms out of that but there's always some discouragement always something and that's why you can't have one ounce of the world in you so keep moving keep your mind on Calvary and moving towards Christ out of the two and a half million people that left Egypt there was only two Overcomers out of that group and that was Joshua and Caleb and and we know they all saw the works of God they all saw the manifestation of the spirit they all saw the mighty Miracles that was done in Egypt and things and so they all started out but the prophet said it just wasn't in their heart Amen to to to move on and and so they didn't overcome and they perished in the wilderness and and so the testings and the trials uh uh there to show really what's really down deep in our heart I if if if serving the lord If the message message if if what we say is true is it really down into our hearts can you say Amen in John the Baptist age brother Ram said there was only six Overcomers uh in in that age and yet the rest of them offered their sacrifices and they done their Duty uh as as what they were but the ones that overcome these six they were the elected uh that was called by God and and so it it is such a blessedness uh to be Overcomers in this age as as you can read through the history Biblical history and you see of Overcomers that that stood the test you read the the fox's book of Martyrs and and how through them Dark Ages there were Overcomers that that that that they were willing to give everything that they got even the parents seeing their their their children suffer and and be torn apart and burned and and all of that just to try to get the mom and dad to recant and yet they wouldn't recant and and and uh uh them themselves being uh uh fled alive and and tortured and burned to the steak and and uh fed to the Lions but they were Overcomers amen they they did not want to go back and and yet they had just a little bit of of light amen they didn't have the light that we have today and so when you see that they had overcome young people overcome and and and adults overcome and everybody that had claim well we are it's our turn it's this is the greatest age of overcoming than ever before do you realize that amen God would pick you for the hardest age the greatest age to overcome amen this is the age uh that is increased with goods and thinks that she has need of nothing and yet the Bible says that she's wretched blind miserable and naked and knoweth it not notice what brother brandham called this age he says this lazy loose happy gol lucky joking sinful age of lust that we're living in now it's a wonder that God just doesn't say step back church I'll just liquidate the whole group what an age that we're living in and he will do that one of these days too we know it's coming there isn't to be no sparing to this because he's already someone died for those who wanted to escape but he'll take those who was or who has accepted Christ and become Christians and he'll they'll be taken out of the Wrath aren't you glad for that amen but notice this lazy loose happy go lucky joking sinful age of lust well see that's the age that we have to overcome ain't that right uh uh uh that's the age brother said there's more sin in this age that has ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age right here the powers of Satan is harder to fight against than any other age but there is an overcomer that's going to overcome aren't you glad for that amen so uh uh it's harder uh and and here Jesus talks about in Luke uh 11:24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places uh seeking rest and finding none and he saith I will return unto my house when I came out and when he find when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished then he goeth he and taketh to him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first and so this explains uh uh why we are fighting the hardest battle in this age than ever before uh it's it's because the enemy has come Amen in the name of a church it's it's so deceiving and and it's the greatest deception uh and and Matthew 24:24 it says for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and show show signs great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect ain't that right and and so this is the age that that it's in all of the evil that's been through every age is wind up in this age right here amen and and so uh uh brother brandom said people uh can live a clean life a holy life not not be sinful adulterers drinkers liars and gamblers in other words not be any of that and they can live above that and still not with it ain't that right and then he says this is the age of personal life of Jesus Christ ain't that right so if there's ever a time that that we've got to overcome and keep in the Life of Christ it is now amen don't let nothing take the life from you don't let nothing take the spirit of God from you ain't that right do whatever you can to to keep on the fire in line is is basically it and keep in the spirit of God ain't that right and so uh uh but but overcoming is something that God does not take lightly uh uh for he rewards those that over overcome and he rewards them the best that he can give them if if there was anything greater that God could give he would have given it but he rewards you as an overcomer with the best he could give you think of that amen and so for him to reward his elect by them not being part of the second death is a blessing and a comfort to us amen it's it's a comfort and and so uh even though this was uh partaking or or a promise of Ages of an age before the Le osia yet we can take comfort as as a as the last age we can take comfort knowing that this promise is also to us who overcome in this age amen because uh brother Brandon would say now le osia that's the last age there's going to be some Overcomers in there he said watch Che says they remember each age uh uh each Church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered ain't that right so us being the last Church Age We inherit as Overcomers all the rewards amen that was given to the previous ages ain't that right and and so not being part of the second death what a reward now now death uh it we know that death represents uh is separation and and so some people may think that death is just a physical thing where a person separates from their loved ones and and and well that that is death to where that when your loved one dies you can't you can't go where they're at you can't talk to them you can't see them you can't you know uh you can't hear their voice and you can't have that fellowship and and and death has separated them from us who are still alive and and if if you've ever had that experience of losing a loved one uh uh it it it it really brings a uh real meaning of what death does and so uh but second Corinthians 5:6 Paul would tell us that we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from from the body and to be present with the Lord so absent death physical death takes us from our physical body but it doesn't do away with us as as an individual uh for he says to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord even the prophet goes beyond the curtain of time and he sees people who had once lived on Earth that was separated from their loved ones here on Earth but yet the prophet saw them in another body and and and they were Fully Alive ain't that right amen so they were in a body but they were not in the one that they had here on this Earth amen so we we could call that kind of a death maybe the first death uh because the Bible talks about the second death amen and and so we we would call that the first death maybe uh uh but but the second death is a spiritual death which is a separation as well and and John 10 and 10 Jesus says for the the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but I am come that they may have life not physical life but but spiritual life and that they might have it more abundantly ain't that right so then he that overcomes will not be part of that spiritual death it it there will be no separation now the second death is the death of the soul and and um you know we we today we see that spiritual death is on in the land today upon people uh uh and and and yet they're living uh um uh in the physical real in their body natural life but spiritual life is gone and and 1 Timothy 5:6 she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth ain't that right so you see The Sinner is separated from God there there is no Fellowship there is no conscience of God there is no friendship with God there is there there is yo yeah they they learn about God but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about intimate relationship with God and and that soul is separated from God uh uh you know brother brandom says this I love lovely young woman she may be pretty and she'll dress up really nice and go down the street and the boys will whistle at her and she'll twist her shoulders and giggle and smoke her cigarettes and she thinks that's living but the truth of it is it's death see it's life to the flesh but it's death to the spirit and the Soul see so so so people think that this is life and and yes you are living and and yet but the the greatest life would be eternal life can you say amen and and even though we weep at a at at the first death that we would call First death and and a separation from our loved ones and and that is horrible but the greatest thing that would be horrible is that be separated from God our creator to to where that we would live in this life we would we would be able to touch we'd be able to talk we'd be able but we'd have no conscience I could have conscience of you but we'd have no cons ience of God Amen be because we're separated sin separates that individual from being conscience and the fellowship with God can you say amen amen but but the the life of this world that people think is life and yet brother Brown says this death people are so miserable in this life have you ever just thought of it living in the Sin and oh yes they they could have money they could have riches they could have anything that they want and they're so miserable uh uh to where that that men take a gun and blow their brains out and and and try to end their life in such uh horrible ways because it's a life that that is death it's it it's because when a man is separated from his creator and and from that Fellowship there's a longing there's a misery there is a a a uh uh whatever you wanted to call it but you you couldn't call that kind of life you know that uh uh uh uh uh a life that David was speaking of uh it's it's a perverted life it's a life that the devil is trying to have you to live can you say amen amen see uh and so uh uh uh we we find here that that Romans 6 and 23 for the wages of sin is death amen uh Ezekiel 18 and20 the soul that sinth it shall die ain't that right so in other words that the the soul shall be completely separate to where it will be no more it'll be totally annihilated ain't that right and and and so but but think of it how many people are living today uh uh in the physical amen but God can't get to that Soul amen can't get to that Soul it see it's it's a separation out out of fellowship with God and I I thought of the the uh uh brother Bram talking about that girl that that you know was sitting in the back of the preacher's daughter I think pastor's daughter and he he was preaching and and at the end gave the altar call and he told that lady girl he said it's your last night you need to come to the Altar and of course she didn't and met him outside after church and said don't ever talk to me like that again don't embarrass me like that and and and and so they got to talk in there and and and he left her and and saw her I think a year later or sometime after and there she was smoking a cigarette hair all messed up and more just disheveled and and and things and and and he he she saw him and and and and she said hey preach you know and so he stopped to talk to her and he says you know she said you know you you well he off she offered him a cigarette and he says no ma'am I don't want that and he says how could she how dare she offer a minister a cigarette and and so he he says you know you you're right preacher that that night says you you were right says God was calling for you know and and says you know wife I'm uh she says you know in in the conversation she say I can see my mother soul in hell and frying and and she's I just laugh about it you know and he says see that just shows that she went too far but God couldn't reach that Soul God God it was a separation you understand what I'm saying you know uh uh the the real saying true gospel you know when when a person is separated and and if you notice brother Brandon says the real true same God gopel can't even reach them even though they are religious yet religious but yet having no fellowship with God uh no peace no no no Comfort it it it's it's it's this second death is is is is a powerful thing uh brother brand talked about that lady who attended a famous Church most of you know it and and you know uh uh she sung in the choir and and things and and brother Brandon says I always doubt Ed uh of her Christian experience of being born again yet she was a good moral woman and and as far as she knew but she was married got married to a boy named John and and you know after a while uh John uh moved to a bigger city or whatever because of uh uh work uh for a better job and things and so uh the the the church that they started to attend uh was wasn't as spiritual as the one that she went to and and her I think it was her uncle that pastored the first church but she moved they moved to another one and this woman you know began to get mixed up in with other women and and started to copy after them and impersonating them and and and things and brother Brown said that's that's what's the matter with our country today with our churches one's trying to copy after the other and they sat with their head in the televisions and things and trying to impersonate or copy after some filthy thing they saw on television and then bring it into the Church of the Living God and sainted women and men do the same thing or claim to be sainted you you see and and and and I'll say it this way this is one of the reasons why people can't go on with God is because they're too busy wondering what everybody else is doing and trying to copy what everybody young people do not copy after other young people get your own experience with God Amen because even your friends even being raised in messes churches that does not mean that they have an experience with God make sure that you have your own identity with Christ and not worrying about everybody else what everybody else is doing sometimes you just got to stand alone on your own two feet with your own convictions and no matter what everybody else says and it's in them times that maybe you don't even feel God but but God is bragging on you you and he's looking for an overcomer you remember God's not going to Baby everybody he's not going to Baby us well it's true amen it's not parental love that God loves us with its elective love and and so therefore uh uh you you can't you can't get into what what this one's doing and what's that one doing and and looking around to where you forget what God wants you to be be be one that God can call you out of and stand and be identified as a witness for God Amen see so you can't mix oil and water together because it won't work brother brandom says how are you going to believe the supernatural how are you going to get anywhere when you're mingling with the world ain't that right so so another place the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's Not in you now that may rub just a little bit but it'll do you good think of it he said said brother we got to meet Christ in judgment someday woe unto the man who will stand behind the pulpit and use his influence to flatter some people instead of preach the gospel like God said to do it got to be told the truth and that's what we need today is more of the truth bring brought out in its light ain't that right and and so uh uh uh uh this woman you know being around these other and trying to be like everybody else and tried to fit in with the crowd and and whatever see I I I think that's why the devil gives us complexes and especially you young people having complexes but but even adults get complexes and and and because you want to fit in you want to be accepted you you you you you you you want to be able to rub shoulders and be liked and be this and be that but see you you God's called you for a purpose and and and Satan will put them complexes on you and and and try to get you bound up Amen to where you're so afraid of what what your friends are going to say and what they're going to think about you and all of that but you can't worry about that just stand with God and overcome the age that you're living in so this woman started wearing the Scandal clothes and shorts and got getting out there and mowing the yard with them and and uh you know her dad rebuked her and the others did as well and but she thought she was good as the rest of them then she started smoking and then she started doing other things that were wrong and and then after a while some slickster come along and and begin to swoo her while her husband's at work and things like that and and we all know this the story he was married to another woman and and then convinced her to run away with him and so she she ran left John and went with this guy and and and you know uh brother Brown said you know the first thing they'd get back there and she'd put on her little clothes move the yard when he'd come in and he you know what he brother Brown says what you wearing them for not to appear before God but to appear before men ain't that right amen women put on them sexy clothes not not for God they they they doing that for men amen but you know so anyways uh uh uh they get they ran off they get married and before you know it he leaves her and goes to for another woman and and it just once one thing and after another and after another and it just begin to compile and and she kept all this time kept playing the piano in the church and and and things like that and so she ended up living with a common law husband and and uh uh I believe it was brother Neville you know or some minister went over and talked to her and trying to woo her and she you know uh to bring her back call her back and she says hey I'm all right I'm just as good as anybody you know and and these things and so one day she ended up with cancer and and the doctor told her says I've done all that I can do for you you know and and uh you're going to die get you know prepare for death and things like that so brother Neville actually went to go see her in in the hospital and thought you know if I could just get her to surrender to Christ then you know I maybe I can get brother brandom to come over and pray for and things like that and and so a servant of God went over there and she just baled him out and and uh uh she let him know that she didn't sin for him didn't want him there and uh said I'm just as good as you are and and yet you know she was smoking cigarettes right after another and all that and yet claiming to be saved and and things like that see and brother brandom he he says now why why why would she act like that what was it brother BR said this she grieved the holy spirit away from her she grieved the holy spirit away from her and so this is what the Bible again says the soul that sinth or the soul that disbel believes that Soul shall die or separate can you say amen and so uh uh uh you know th this is the comfort that the Overcomer has is because if we would be separated from one another in death amen we may be a we may do that death may come for us every one of us uh or some of us or one of us to where that God takes us home and we're separated from each other but one hope that we have is that we'll never be separated from our God can you say amen and and see the soul has separated from her and the soul is in her heart and and the pro you know well the Bible says you believe from the heart ain't that right so when the soul separates and and then the heart can't believe it it has nothing to believe with and brother BR says see people don't get religion in their head by a book knowledge you get religion in the Heart by an experience in the heart and the heart will always agree with the Bible but the head will reason ain't that right the devil works in the mind and he says now he says see her mind would tell her now it's reasonable if these women can do it then why can't I see they're called Christians they have good standing in the church they're good standing in the community so why can't I be that see I'm a Christian like they are and if they can do that then it's reasonable that I should be able to do it too and because then I'll be one of them if I don't they'll think I'm an old fogy if I don't do this then they'll think I'm better than they are ain't that right of course we don't want to be better than other people right and so then we got to lower our standards a little bit so we fit into the crowd so we'll be accepted we got to have a good testimony anyway after all amen ain't that right and if I just live a little bit above them they'll reject me they'll think I'm a little goofy and a little funny and all that and then I can't win souls that way right see it's all the reasoning reasoning reasoning and and all these things see and he says that's reasoning I'll get uh you know it'll get you in bad every time no matter what your intellectual knowledge tells you don't you believe it if it's contrary to the word of God ain't that right take thus sayeth the Lord first stay with that no matter and your soul will always agree with that word that's right ain't that right see so what is it then that's the Overcomer the Overcomer is agreeing with the word of God rejecting the reasoning rejecting everything and just staying right with the word of God you can love people and stand with the word of God Amen oh yeah they'll say you're hateful and you're being you're being too rigid you're being too judgmental all that just stay with the word of God can you say Amen the sign that you do love people is the sign that you'll tell them where they're wrong the sign you do love people is not just going around putting your arms around making everybody feel comfortable amen and oh you're okay and you're okay we support you whatever you do that ain't love amen that that's a that's a a perverted love that sends people to Hell amen but if you really love people you'll stand for what's right you'll tell the truth regardless of what happens amen though the world forsake me I'll still follow Christ amen that's the greatest love that you can give a person is when you stand for the truth let your light shine and in their darkness and they're sailing the Seas of life and they're about to shipwreck hopefully they'll look to you as the lighthouse and see that there is a truth in this thing can you say amen and that you can lead them back to truth you ain't leading them to Truth by patting them on the back all the time so brother Brown said her pastor come down there and he seemed to think that she was all right so her brother drove you know from the house and went on her thinking she was right on she had intellectual faith and she said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I've accepted him years ago my personal savior she said I can play in in the church I have my places in society I'm just as good as anybody else and my pastor he says brother Neville said well but what about this common law husband and she said the same's door o the same doors open that you come in at and he left and he says you know I want to bring brother brandom over and she said I don't want to see him and he went on back and the only thing he could do see and brother said to me said what about that brother brandom I said watch her at the in be sure that you're standing near her when her time comes to leave here so she went on a few months and kept getting worse finally hospitalized her and one day when all of them was standing around and she was going out to meet God all at once when this intellectual begin to break in here see remember your mind is controlled by your brain and your nerves and blood and whenever those human elements fail to function this brain here the intellectuals began to break and when it began to break she realized this soul that sinned that disbelieved and cast off to one side began to catch up with her and when she seen that coming she cried out oh I'm lost can you say amen and the Pastor said now here here here you're getting beside yourself she said don't speak to me he said don't you speak to me you're lost she says I'm lost and they went and got the doctor and she got beside herself they gave her a hypo and they shot a Hyo and she and and she I'm lost I'm lost I'm going to H and they said give her another and they kept giving her a hypo until finally her breath faded out screaming I'm lost I'm lost he said see the hypo stop this confession with these lips and when the intellectual was breaking but that soul that had sinned before God she'll have to live with it throughout all ages to come can you sayen so what a a a time what would it would be to be separated amen uh uh from God you you can have all your college you you can have all your education you can have all the wealth that you want but remember all of that comes to an end to one of these days everything comes to an end I I you know and and you just forgive me I hope it's all right but I I was just talking to my wife and you know I got to think about brother Brandon when he says I you know what if I had I think it was 10,000 years to live without God 10,000 years to have anything I wanted on this world but at the end of the 10,000 years I'm done it's over with you know and and but said then you know if if I had what what did he say have nothing but yet have Christ and no you know he said I choose that more than than than anything else you know and I thought well you know I was telling my wife the other day just so struck me what if we chose that what if we chose that and and we've only got one month left of the 10,000 years one month left what do we do next there'd be nothing you understand what I'm saying no hope whatsoever it's it's over so the 10,000 years of of all the wealth all the things that you want in this world do anything you want no parents to tell you no preacher no nothing no no laws nothing you just get anything you want it's yours and yet at the end of them 10,000 years you've done it all these years and then you got a day to live what next all of that would be nothing when considering to live eternally with God now this is what we have made the choice is is we we have we we we could live it up we could have anything that we want we we could be whatever but we have made the choice as an overcomer we're going to overcome we're going to overcome can you say amen and God's promised this now listen in your deepest trials in your hardest times in the times when it seems all hell is breaking loose there is a promise that you'll not be part of the second death keep standing for God keep standing true for this message keep pressing on and sin or or Satan will never be able to separate you I don't care how hard the trial is amen the trial could not separate God from job and job from God he could not separate Satan could not separate that Faith from God Satan could not separate that relationship with God Satan could not separate God Amen from getting to job and giving him a revelation I see uh uh what is it uh I shall see My Redeemer even though the skin worms eat this body yet in my flesh I'll see my redeemer why because sin could not separate job from his creator ain't that right amen and there is a people on this earth that is overcoming that is enduring and no matter how hot it gets and no matter how alone they feel and no matter how wretched it may be and no matter how poor they are amen God still has keeping a relationship with him amen and staying with him and they keeping that intimate relationship oh do you love him second Peter 7:10 it says Godly sorrow now listen Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented do amen but sorrow of the world worketh death separation right so brother Brown said she she could go to church and act like a saint and that don't have one thing to do with it but she's dead while she's living look what the denominations has done for her they made her a Handler of the holy word which is contrary to the Bible they made her a preacher it's forbidden of the scripture even makes her now become ruler mayor Governors everything in the country and a minister in the house of God when she's guilty of every sin that's ever committed she is the cause of it right see now I'm not I'm he says I'm not speaking of Rights he said but she is guilty she is the one that caused every baby to be born blind she is the one that caused every grave to be dug she is the one that caused sin sickness sorrow an ambulance can't ring unless a woman caused it no crime can be done no sin no death no sorrow no suffering but a woman done it and God forbids her to go to the pulpit to preach but they yet they do it anyway see amen he says and what is it it's denomination that's that's what it is but to those who overcome amen shall the second death shall have no power over them I I I think it's worth overcoming don't you amen you see there is a spiritual drought amen that is going on throughout the land today and the thing brother Braham said that has caused it is sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought the place to this coming on uh coming judgment they have turned from God's word and his prophit to a modern theological terms of the word and and so whenever there's a drought death follows it ain't that right when there's a drought death follows when there's a famine F death follows see and and so we're in a in a time that the prophet uh uh Amos I think that that that that talked about a famine in the land and and and uh not for bread or water but for hearing of the word so so that means that if there's the famine then there's death that's going to come and and we're seeing that today death is all over the place spiritual death is taking place but yet through it all God has promised the over Comer amen uh reward ain't that right now notice in the drought uh uh second uh Revelations 2 and 17 to him that overcometh everybody say to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana Hallelujah in the drought there's going to be a hidden mana and and what is the hidden Mana it's the revealed word ain't that right it's the revealed word now Matthew 4:4 man shall not live live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God famine will not come to that man that eats of the word the revealed word ain't that right so notice the hidden Mana is what the Overcomer through every age has fed on Amen uh the hidden mana and this message is the hidden Mana for the Overcomer of this age do you believe that Amen in the drought God has promised the Overcomer you will not part of the second death amen why because God has provided a hidden Mana a hidden Mana it's hidden from everyone else but he's reserved it he's got this Mana for his elect in this age in the time of spiritual death caused by spiritual drought the life of the Overcomer is sustained he shall not be part of the second death ain't that right amen so the Overcomer is the man that perfectly overcomes the prophet said the man that really sits down and throw aside throws aside everything else besides the word amen see so in closing the religious people today are like Esau he traded the birthright for a mess of pottage and brother Brown says Esau morally was a better man than Jacob but he didn't have respects to his Birthright which was the word see uh uh the word his the Covenant right the promise amen so how many knows that the birth Rights was the word the promise the Elder son but he was a good man a moral man like the nominal Christian today a good man he didn't lie he didn't steal he was a good to his daddy he done all these things but you see his Birthright see he said he didn't care about that what difference does that make I'm an Israelite anyhow I belong to it anyhow but it was his birth rights that counted his natural was all right but his spiritual was all wrong ain't that right see so his natural was all all right naturally he was a good man he was a daddy's boy and he was a great Hunter he was moral he was honest he didn't cheat didn't lie didn't steal naturally he was good but spiritually he was all wrong ain't that right see so it's spiritual death now notice as as again as we get ready close 1 Corinthians 15:54 Paul said so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the say that is written death is swallowed up in Victory aren't you glad for that death is swallowed up in Victory amen hallelujah I just love the Lord I just you know I believe that this is applicable not applicable not only to the physical but to the death to the spiritual as well death is swallowed up second Corinthians 1:9 it says but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the Dead who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet Deliver Us can you say Amen if he has delivered our soul from Death then can we not believe him that he will raise this old body up even though it's in ashes and even though it's gone into dust and even though it's just nothing but a spoonful of dust amen God will raise this up again amen and we will live eternally before him notice second Timothy 1 and9 it says who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Lord Our Savior Jesus Christ who has abolished death aren't you glad he abolished death who did he do it for for you the elect amen the Overcomer he abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel when did he bring life and immortality to light in this age a prophet stepped over beyond the C curtain of time and he began to let us know what it's all about can you say Amen aren't you glad for that amen Revelations 1:7 when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not amen fear not elect fear not Overcomer I am the first and I am the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death church he holds the power to sustain life aren't you glad for that do you love him if the musicians will come thank you Lord second Death Shall
