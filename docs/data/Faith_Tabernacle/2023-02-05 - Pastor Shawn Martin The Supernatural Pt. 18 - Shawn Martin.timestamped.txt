[46:14] would be able to help us
[46:16] with your
[46:18] the

[46:23] and if anyone just in and wants to help
[46:27] you know during the meeting with

[46:32] um it would definitely be a big help to
[46:36] us and um
[46:38] also I had announced a while back uh
[46:44] about maybe going to taking a trip to
[46:47] Pennsylvania
[46:49] um to see The Sight and Sound I don't
[46:52] know what their plan maybe David or
[46:55] something like that but
[46:56] it's a it's if you haven't been to Sight
[46:59] and Sound you would enjoy it I believe
[47:01] but
[47:02] um last year we did that several of us

[51:27] worship uh you know it's uh it's good
[51:31] when the people come in free you know
[51:33] and just be able to Worship the Lord
[51:35] I've just enjoyed the specials
[51:38] um there and and uh you know I wanted to
[51:42] say I really appreciate all of you the
[51:46] uh your gifts we're we've got a talented
[51:49] church and uh you know and we all you
[51:54] know as hearing brother Brown the other
[51:56] day and he said we've all got something
[51:59] special to do and and I think that is so
[52:03] true whether it's cleaning the windows
[52:06] or uh directing the traffic or whether
[52:10] it's saying amen and being you know I
[52:14] just there's your everyone is special
[52:18] and
[52:20] um I thought of even you know just
[52:22] thinking of brother Walker and Sister
[52:24] Walker and I know sometimes you know
[52:27] they don't feel like they're they're
[52:30] they're doing much for the Lord but you
[52:33] know I I think of all the times that he
[52:35] had called me and and uh he calls me and
[52:38] say I'm I'm praying for you you know
[52:40] always praying for you and he just don't
[52:44] realize how special that is to me and uh
[52:48] but every one of us has got something to
[52:51] do for the Lord amen now let's just
[52:54] stand to her feet and
[52:56] um
[52:58] um
[53:02] and we're going to turn back to
[53:05] Ephesians 1.
[53:11] amen Ephesians 1.
[53:19] I think that's the the Devil he's good
[53:22] at letting telling us that we're not
[53:25] needed he's good at telling us that
[53:28] we're not important
[53:30] I even find that young people have such
[53:32] complexes
[53:34] of thinking that they're they're just of
[53:36] no value or
[53:38] of you know that
[53:42] they settle for the for less and I don't
[53:44] think you have to settle for less you
[53:46] are of value
[53:48] when it comes to the kingdom of God
[53:50] you're of value amen and
[53:54] um
[53:55] before we go into the word let's just
[53:57] bow our hearts and talk to our Lord
[54:01] dear father
[54:03] we just come to you Lord with Humble
[54:07] Hearts
[54:09] Lord just can't express enough
[54:13] of how thankful we are for all your
[54:16] blessings
[54:18] and Lord you bestowing your love Upon Us
[54:21] father
[54:22] Lord that you have chosen us for this
[54:25] day the greatest age Lord that
[54:30] the sages of old the Patriarchs the
[54:33] Saints
[54:34] have long for this day
[54:37] and here we are Lord and I know Satan
[54:40] would
[54:41] love just to to think make us think that
[54:45] we're just here coinced by coincidence
[54:48] Lord or just floating along
[54:51] the Lord you've called us for this Lord
[54:54] and every challenge that we face you've
[54:58] called us to overcome
[55:00] Lord you've given us the grace to do so
[55:03] and may we walk in your footsteps may we
[55:06] may we take courage this morning
[55:09] and I pray Lord that you would just
[55:12] anoint Lord both speaker and hearer
[55:15] bless the words that we would have to
[55:18] say God and may it be you speaking and
[55:21] bless the reading of your word as our
[55:24] prayer
[55:25] we ask it in your lovely name Jesus
[55:28] Christ
[55:29] amen and amen
[55:33] uh Ephesians the first chapter and I'm
[55:37] going to the 22nd verse
[55:41] I think it's it's very powerful
[55:45] done the well the whole book of
[55:47] Ephesians but
[55:49] but here it says and hath put all things
[55:51] everybody say all things under his feet
[55:56] and gave him to be the head over all
[55:59] things to the church
[56:01] which is his body
[56:04] the fullness of him
[56:06] that philth all in all
[56:09] amen you can be seated
[56:14] that feeleth all in all
[56:17] so
[56:20] I'm using this scripture
[56:24] a lot because
[56:26] not not just for repetitious but in yet
[56:32] it tells us as to what part we play in
[56:36] God's plan
[56:39] and if we if we
[56:43] those setting here this morning or maybe
[56:46] even listening in
[56:48] online if we are the church then we are
[56:52] his body
[56:53] no via fans or buts it's we are his body
[56:58] if we are his church
[57:01] and we're baptized into this body by one
[57:05] spirit
[57:06] amen and I'm so glad for that because
[57:10] that's the only way that we could be
[57:11] part of the body or the Church of the
[57:15] Living God
[57:17] I looked up this word body it it is the
[57:20] main Central
[57:22] or principle part
[57:24] the material part to give form or shape
[57:28] to the expression of
[57:32] and
[57:33] we know how that's true as as the
[57:38] prophet said we can't see one another
[57:40] uh because we're all Spirit form
[57:44] but we have fellowships by it through
[57:47] your body it's it's your body expresses
[57:51] you your body my body expresses me
[57:54] and whatever nature whatever character
[57:58] whatever I am my body expresses that
[58:03] and
[58:04] um we so we we find that God is without
[58:10] form for he is a spirit
[58:13] and and a spirit has no form
[58:18] but he took form
[58:21] he took he took form when he created the
[58:24] body of his son and came and lived in it
[58:28] ain't that right
[58:29] and and so the the Bible tells us what
[58:33] form and that is he took on the form of
[58:37] man
[58:38] a man and and so then then we find it to
[58:43] be true for Jesus when Thomas uh told uh
[58:47] approached Jesus saying
[58:50] um uh it would suffice us if if you
[58:55] would show us the father in other words
[58:58] we'd be satisfied if we can just see the
[59:01] father
[59:01] and and Jesus says but you know have I
[59:05] been so long with you and you still
[59:07] don't know who I am
[59:10] he that has seen the father hath seen me
[59:13] ain't that right and so God took on the
[59:18] form of man and brother Branham goes
[59:21] into you know talks about that form and
[59:26] tells us that the Greek word means in
[59:29] morpha and and he says which means he
[59:34] changed himself
[59:36] God came down and took on a form of man
[59:42] something that could not be seen yet
[59:44] it's there and then it's changed and the
[59:48] eye can catch it so he says he changed
[59:52] himself to what he was to what he is or
[59:56] his mask he changed masks uh to take on
[1:00:01] another act ain't that right so the ACT
[1:00:04] did not finish with Jesus in the god
[1:00:08] becoming in the form of man in the body
[1:00:10] of Jesus that Paul is saying that God
[1:00:14] has now taken on another form
[1:00:16] amorpha and that's the body of his
[1:00:19] church ain't that right so he's in morfa
[1:00:24] in his church which is his body as we
[1:00:27] know uh all that God was he poured into
[1:00:30] Christ and to think of that now all that
[1:00:34] God was he poured into Christ and all
[1:00:38] that Christ is he poured into the church
[1:00:42] amen so the same God that was in Christ
[1:00:46] is in the body of his church today and
[1:00:50] the body you you you think of it now
[1:00:53] you're the only people and when I say
[1:00:56] you the only people I'm talking about
[1:00:59] worldwide as as the Church of the Living
[1:01:02] God that can reflect as what God is
[1:01:05] without trying to interpret who God is
[1:01:09] God interprets his own self through his
[1:01:12] body ain't that rhyme amen so what God
[1:01:16] is his body reflects what character is
[1:01:19] on the inside of the body the body
[1:01:22] reflects what nature is on the inside of
[1:01:25] the body the body reflects ain't that
[1:01:28] right so we find Jesus being the body of
[1:01:32] God was the expressed image of God so
[1:01:36] much so that he says he that has seen me
[1:01:38] has seen the father now you know I I
[1:01:43] think someone had meant maybe a brother
[1:01:45] Wendell but how that that uh um uh and
[1:01:49] brother Branham you know did too where
[1:01:51] the woman said you know uh talking about
[1:01:54] Oneness and and uh he said you know she
[1:01:58] I think she was saying about you know
[1:02:00] that that Oneness is you and your wife
[1:02:02] that's the type of Oneness that Jesus
[1:02:04] was talking about and brother Brian said
[1:02:06] no that's not true and and he he and and
[1:02:09] he says you know me and my wife for one
[1:02:12] he said but do you uh do you see my wife
[1:02:15] here no he goes well then that's not the
[1:02:18] Oneness that Jesus is talking about
[1:02:20] because Jesus said he that has seen me
[1:02:22] has seen the father and and I I believe
[1:02:25] personally that we're coming back to
[1:02:27] that Oneness and and if you'd go listen
[1:02:29] to what brother Branham preached on on
[1:02:31] the message Oneness amen he gives this
[1:02:34] uh it tells us really what kind of
[1:02:37] Oneness is is is we're coming to ain't
[1:02:41] that right now now with that in mind if
[1:02:43] we are the body how can God be in you
[1:02:46] and the creative word not be in you how
[1:02:49] how can God be in you and the
[1:02:51] supernatural not be in you how can God
[1:02:55] be in his body and the body not reflect
[1:02:57] anything that he is and is reflecting
[1:03:01] something else ain't that right that's
[1:03:03] why we can't just settle down just being
[1:03:05] church members amen we can't just settle
[1:03:08] down just by uh uh knowing a Doctrine or
[1:03:12] knowing uh uh what brother Branham got
[1:03:14] done in brother Branham I think we ought
[1:03:17] to be able to identify with the Miracles
[1:03:19] that brother Branham uh uh that God done
[1:03:21] through brother Branham I think we ought
[1:03:23] to be able to identify with the Miracles
[1:03:25] that God done through Jesus Christ I
[1:03:27] believe that we ought to be able to
[1:03:29] identify with the same Supernatural God
[1:03:32] that was Identity or that was revealed
[1:03:34] or reflected in in them do you believe
[1:03:37] that a man so now uh we are his body and
[1:03:41] what God is is then the body is to
[1:03:44] reflect for God is dwelling in his own
[1:03:47] body you are not your own
[1:03:51] you've been bought with the price ain't
[1:03:53] that right when God redeemed you he did
[1:03:55] not just redeem you and then you just go
[1:03:57] happy go lucky and not knowing anything
[1:04:00] about God Amen but he did he redeemed
[1:04:04] you that he himself could possess you he
[1:04:07] possesses your mind he wants to possess
[1:04:10] your tongue he wants to possess your
[1:04:12] eyes he wants to possess these hands he
[1:04:14] wants to possess your whole entire body
[1:04:17] amen and his desire is to fellowship
[1:04:20] with you amen but to think of it not
[1:04:23] just the fellowship not just going
[1:04:24] around saying I'm a Christian I'm
[1:04:25] message believer I'm Christian you know
[1:04:28] but he wants an intimate relationship
[1:04:30] with you amen but not only just an
[1:04:33] intimate relationship with you but he
[1:04:35] wants to reveal himself through you a
[1:04:39] man to where the people uh at work the
[1:04:41] the the the the people that you meet
[1:04:44] your friends your family wherever you
[1:04:46] are the people can see Jesus Christ is
[1:04:49] alive today not by because you say so
[1:04:52] but there's an atmosphere that you
[1:04:55] create there is a supernatural uh thing
[1:04:58] about you that the world knows nothing
[1:05:01] of can you say man amen and this is not
[1:05:04] assembly line production this is God
[1:05:07] himself living inside of you producing
[1:05:10] his own works now we are living in a
[1:05:14] time where the world has left off from
[1:05:17] the Supernatural and if there has ever
[1:05:20] been a a time of human promotion it is
[1:05:24] today amen uh man's uh ideas being
[1:05:29] promoted Humanity promoted everything
[1:05:32] about man being promoted exalted lifted
[1:05:35] up amen and of the human mind the human
[1:05:39] achievements human work human intellect
[1:05:42] this is the promotion of man hey ain't
[1:05:46] that right whether it's by education or
[1:05:49] whether it's by science or technology G
[1:05:51] or whatever it's it's nothing but the
[1:05:54] promotion of man's intellects
[1:05:56] achievements and all that but in all of
[1:05:59] man's achievements he is unable to fix
[1:06:01] what chaos is going on the more he he
[1:06:05] brags about his intellect the worst
[1:06:08] chaos it gets amen the more uh
[1:06:11] achievements he he he comes up with a
[1:06:14] man the worse it gets I don't care if
[1:06:16] it's if it's a super church it's getting
[1:06:19] worse I don't care if it's a super
[1:06:21] government it's getting worse I don't
[1:06:23] care if it's a supernation it's getting
[1:06:25] worse ain't that right amen because it's
[1:06:28] nothing but man's achievements his and
[1:06:31] Man is full of death his works are full
[1:06:33] of death uh everything he does I don't
[1:06:36] care he comes with better foods and
[1:06:38] we're dying dying dying more more faster
[1:06:41] than ever we he come up with better cars
[1:06:44] we've become up with better way of
[1:06:46] traveling a better way of whatever to
[1:06:48] live and and and we're getting weaker
[1:06:50] and weaker and weaker amen and man is
[1:06:54] trying to stop this death he's trying to
[1:06:56] stop amen the train wreck that's coming
[1:06:59] and he can't do it he has no answers
[1:07:02] every promise that man makes is a false
[1:07:05] promise it's a false hope it's false
[1:07:07] ain't that right amen even your rich man
[1:07:10] your wealthiest men has got bunkers a
[1:07:13] Man Down Under the Earth to hide amen uh
[1:07:17] uh when when because they know
[1:07:18] catastrophe is coming and and and all
[1:07:21] their intellect will tell them is is if
[1:07:23] we get in a bunker we'll be safe but we
[1:07:26] know that a prophet said you'll never be
[1:07:28] safe can you say man the Bible says
[1:07:31] you'll never be safe you they're going
[1:07:33] to run they're going to cry for the
[1:07:34] rocks to fall upon them amen but but it
[1:07:37] ain't it ain't going to cover them from
[1:07:38] the wrath of God ain't that right so we
[1:07:42] we see we see this chaos that it's it's
[1:07:45] in the home life it's in the churches
[1:07:48] it's in schools it's in society
[1:07:50] governments and politics and and and you
[1:07:53] name it the chaos is there we see it
[1:07:56] working uh in in adults and and and yet
[1:08:00] then we see it working in teenagers now
[1:08:02] we're seeing it working in Little
[1:08:04] Children the devil possessing their
[1:08:07] minds and and and and they're becoming
[1:08:09] the puppets of the devil ain't that
[1:08:12] right to think of it a six-year-old
[1:08:14] would shoot his teacher just the other
[1:08:15] day about a six-year-old think of that
[1:08:18] how in the world could it come to that
[1:08:20] I'll tell you what it is it's the demon
[1:08:22] possession amen now the prophet already
[1:08:24] told us it's invasion of the United
[1:08:26] States Hollywood has invaded in our
[1:08:30] homes the devil has come into the home
[1:08:32] through Hollywood amen the murders and
[1:08:35] the blasphemies and the and and and the
[1:08:38] things the wicked acts amen has come
[1:08:40] right into the home where God don't feel

[1:08:54] raping your mind amen rape and
[1:08:57] everything that God wants to use you God
[1:09:00] wants to God has created man for his
[1:09:02] glory amen but he's got to have a
[1:09:04] channel to work through ain't that right
[1:09:06] and our minds are so stopped up the
[1:09:09] people's minds are suit and twisted in
[1:09:13] this day we don't even know what
[1:09:15] motherhood is like anymore we don't even
[1:09:16] know what fatherhood is like anymore we
[1:09:19] don't even know what church life is
[1:09:21] supposed to be anymore you understand
[1:09:23] what I'm saying when I say we I'm
[1:09:25] talking about Americans I'm talking
[1:09:26] about the world over we think church is
[1:09:28] just joining up and sitting there amen
[1:09:31] like a knot on a log and having a
[1:09:33] 30-minute episode and then we all go
[1:09:35] home that ain't what a church is
[1:09:37] supposed to be amen it's supposed to be
[1:09:39] a life that is living inside of us amen

[1:11:20] I can make it
[1:11:23] you're valuable
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:26] ain't that right
[1:11:28] but we find it's certainly out of the
[1:11:30] control of mankind
[1:11:33] but we as Believers see that the
[1:11:35] supernatural God is controlling things
[1:11:38] Psalms 103 19 the Lord hath prepared his
[1:11:41] throne in the heavens
[1:11:43] and his kingdom ruleth overall
[1:11:47] so see the God we serve is ruler Over
[1:11:50] All
[1:11:51] the god that we serve is not defeated
[1:11:53] the god that we serve when he speaks
[1:11:56] some things happen things happen not
[1:11:58] something things happen amen why he
[1:12:01] rules over all now you to think of that
[1:12:04] you're his body you are his body that
[1:12:07] this God that is omnipotent that
[1:12:09] reigneth overall decides to to live in
[1:12:11] he redeemed you for that purpose he
[1:12:14] called you for that purpose can you say
[1:12:16] amen and then he saves you in this for
[1:12:19] this time as such a time as this when
[1:12:22] it's the wickedest age when it's the
[1:12:24] darkest age and yet as the prophet said
[1:12:26] God decided and says I will defeat my
[1:12:30] enemy through them
[1:12:31] God would reserve a body in this age
[1:12:34] amen for the final moments amen when
[1:12:37] Satan would come in as a roaring lion he
[1:12:40] would take you amen redeem you and then
[1:12:43] come and live in you and defeat every
[1:12:46] enemy amen that comes your way
[1:12:48] oh yes this church is triumphant amen
[1:12:52] because she's the body of the triumphant
[1:12:54] God this church is Victorious because
[1:12:56] she's the body a man of a Victorious God
[1:12:59] this church Reigns Amen in this life do
[1:13:04] you believe that we're not victims we're
[1:13:06] not defeated we are literally reigning
[1:13:09] in our body because we are the Temple of
[1:13:12] Jesus Christ
[1:13:15] grace alone
[1:13:18] the word Supernatural
[1:13:22] means
[1:13:23] and I've read this before but I read it
[1:13:25] again
[1:13:26] to refresh your minds
[1:13:29] it means departing from what is usual or
[1:13:31] normal
[1:13:33] especially so as to appear to transcend
[1:13:35] the laws of nature
[1:13:38] and the word transcend
[1:13:41] is to rise above
[1:13:43] or go beyond the limits of
[1:13:45] so it it's it's it's going Supernatural
[1:13:48] rises above or goes beyond the limits of
[1:13:51] nature
[1:13:52] it means to triumph over the negative or
[1:13:56] restrictive aspects of it means overcome
[1:14:01] to be prior to
[1:14:03] Beyond and above the universe or
[1:14:07] material existence
[1:14:09] see to outstrip or outdo in some
[1:14:12] attribute quality or power
[1:14:14] so it we as Mortals we are confined to
[1:14:19] gravity
[1:14:20] but the supernaturalism
[1:14:22] so you understand how the Supernatural
[1:14:24] is going to take place
[1:14:26] amen uh uh we are limited as as mortal
[1:14:29] beings to the laws of nature but the
[1:14:32] supernatural isn't
[1:14:34] as mortal beings we are we are uh uh
[1:14:38] restricted amen our youth is restricted
[1:14:42] Amen to the laws of corruption but the
[1:14:45] supernatural isn't
[1:14:47] hey ain't that right
[1:14:48] amen see and so this is how God could
[1:14:51] take a man uh an old man that that could
[1:14:55] be feeble and bent over and all that and
[1:14:57] let that spirit of God so Quicken him
[1:15:00] amen he could be preaching and anointing
[1:15:02] strike him and that backhoe straightened
[1:15:05] up hey man he get to feeling young again
[1:15:07] because it's something Beyond Humanity
[1:15:11] ain't that right it's the supernatural
[1:15:14] that that transcends the laws of nature
[1:15:17] so the Supernatural is attributed to an
[1:15:21] invisible agent it supersedes overrides
[1:15:25] overpowers the natural and it cannot be
[1:15:28] explained by science a manifestation a
[1:15:32] Supernatural is a manifestation or event
[1:15:35] attributed to some Force Beyond
[1:15:38] scientific understanding or the laws of
[1:15:41] nature so so there there's there's a lot
[1:15:44] of things there that describes the
[1:15:47] Supernatural and and and so the main
[1:15:49] thing we get is that that the
[1:15:52] Supernatural is unlimited it's it's it
[1:15:56] it answers to nothing whatever the
[1:15:58] supernatural whenever the Supernatural
[1:16:00] is is there the supernatural being here
[1:16:04] then we expect anything to happen amen
[1:16:07] it because it goes beyond the
[1:16:09] limitations of your your problems it
[1:16:11] goes beyond the the limitations of how
[1:16:14] you feel it goes beyond the limitations
[1:16:16] of your weaknesses it goes beyond the
[1:16:19] limitations of everything and so when we
[1:16:21] say that God is here then then it perks
[1:16:24] us up when we come to church and we say
[1:16:27] we come to meet God Amen and and we're
[1:16:29] under expectation to meet God well it's
[1:16:33] more than just coming uh Mortals coming
[1:16:35] together it's a supernatural God Amen uh
[1:16:39] uh coming and moving among his body
[1:16:41] working among his body and and whatever
[1:16:44] problem you have you don't have to have
[1:16:46] it any longer amen whatever sickness
[1:16:49] you've got you can leave here healed
[1:16:50] amen whatever discouragement you're
[1:16:52] going through amen there is a
[1:16:54] supernatural power amen that can go
[1:16:57] beyond amen the discouragement say man
[1:16:59] I've had it amen when I've come in with
[1:17:02] questions in my mind and the
[1:17:04] supernatural drop he will answer every
[1:17:07] question that I have because God is God
[1:17:10] he is Supernatural he is not on the
[1:17:13] level of human beings
[1:17:16] ain't that right and and so this is what
[1:17:20] God is this is describes God for he is
[1:17:23] Supernatural amen there is no mortal
[1:17:26] that can ever be compared to what God is
[1:17:29] amen and Mortal man can't even
[1:17:32] comprehend what God is and I think this
[1:17:35] is the the the the the lovely thing and
[1:17:39] the Most Blessed thing about being the
[1:17:40] body of Christ is because the Holy Ghost
[1:17:43] within us gives the understanding amen
[1:17:47] if we had not the Holy Ghost we would
[1:17:50] never be able to understand the things
[1:17:52] of God even though we we heard about the
[1:17:54] things of God I could tell you about the
[1:17:56] things of God that you could hear
[1:17:57] through a prophet you could see God in
[1:18:00] action and yet if you don't have
[1:18:02] something within you then then you would
[1:18:05] never know you would never understand it
[1:18:07] it would just you don't kind of give you
[1:18:09] a flat top as it goes by you know and
[1:18:11] and so but but when you have the spirit
[1:18:14] of God I I I take it like this and I've
[1:18:17] used this illustration and I hope it's
[1:18:19] okay to use it again but but you know
[1:18:21] it's it's like human Humanity
[1:18:25] with with with uh bug life
[1:18:28] the the intelligence is of if humanity
[1:18:32] is so far beyond the the intelligence of
[1:18:35] a bug and and you know I use brother
[1:18:39] Branson for for a moment but you know
[1:18:41] he's a fine looking young man and and
[1:18:44] and I'm sure you know that he'd like to
[1:18:47] uh uh have a home and and uh one of
[1:18:50] these days get married and you know
[1:18:52] these things got Visions plans and all
[1:18:55] that and and so but it it it wouldn't it
[1:18:58] be funny though and uh if if you come in
[1:19:01] with the ladybug on his arm you know I
[1:19:06] want his hand and then you put a little
[1:19:08] thing you you know you Gucci Gucci goo
[1:19:11] you know and and and he's talking to
[1:19:14] this ladybug and and I I guarantee you
[1:19:18] uh the parents would be like that ain't
[1:19:20] my boy
[1:19:21] you know he he he left and he's never
[1:19:24] come back I don't know who you are you
[1:19:27] know and and you'd say man you know
[1:19:29] Brent said man I can run I you know
[1:19:31] little girl I can run 20 miles
[1:19:36] in an hour
[1:19:38] you know
[1:19:39] I don't know if you can or not but we
[1:19:41] will dramatize here you know and and
[1:19:44] well he's telling the ladybug everything
[1:19:46] about himself and that ladybug just was
[1:19:49] just running around she's not
[1:19:50] comprehending nothing
[1:19:53] because the intelligence is two
[1:19:55] different things
[1:19:57] ain't that right it's a bug life versus
[1:20:00] human life
[1:20:02] now if she could get the spirit that
[1:20:04] little bug could get the spirit of human
[1:20:06] she could actually begin to comprehend
[1:20:09] what human Branson is saying about
[1:20:12] himself to her but but see his presence
[1:20:15] even though he's made all these
[1:20:17] achievements and and and these things
[1:20:19] and and to us you know we would look and
[1:20:23] say wow that that Branson he's he's very
[1:20:26] talented he's he's done this he's done
[1:20:29] this he's done that and this and wow
[1:20:31] that and we actually gain respect and
[1:20:34] and and this you understand what I'm
[1:20:36] saying I mean his presence like wow man
[1:20:38] I'm his buddy you know and and uh and
[1:20:42] and maybe someone else that don't know
[1:20:44] Branson would say well you you know him
[1:20:47] I mean I've heard about him I've I've
[1:20:49] read him about him in the newspaper saw
[1:20:51] him on the news and all of his
[1:20:53] accomplishments and things like that and
[1:20:55] yeah yeah I know him you know but but
[1:20:57] see everything that he is don't mean
[1:20:59] nothing to the ladybug you understand
[1:21:01] what I'm saying and and so his presence
[1:21:04] is unrecognized the the what he is is
[1:21:07] unrecognized by that little bug you
[1:21:10] understand what I'm saying that there's
[1:21:12] no Fellowship that could be had there's
[1:21:14] no relationship that could be had where
[1:21:16] you could just imagine now now we we I
[1:21:19] I'm just trying to go from from from One
[1:21:22] Life to another life very low and that's
[1:21:25] pretty low a ladybug versus a human
[1:21:27] that's pretty low you know uh uh uh
[1:21:29] change uh difference there but could you
[1:21:32] imagine how much more difference it is
[1:21:34] between God and man
[1:21:37] amen God is God God is supreme god
[1:21:40] reigns God God love wow God human human
[1:21:44] dialect can't even explain what God is
[1:21:46] give it a try you could speak a million
[1:21:49] words for for uh uh for so many years of
[1:21:52] God and just constantly describing God
[1:21:54] God God and you ain't even going to be
[1:21:57] able to describe him Amen to actually to
[1:21:59] what he really is but yet God chooses to
[1:22:03] have relationship with us God wants
[1:22:05] relationship now there's no way that
[1:22:07] that brother Branson could have
[1:22:09] relationship with that you know a
[1:22:11] fellowship with that that ladybug there
[1:22:13] ain't no way there's no way that that
[1:22:15] ladybug can comprehend she has no
[1:22:17] ability to comprehend well we have no
[1:22:20] ability to comprehend who God is amen
[1:22:22] even the prophet preach the message the
[1:22:24] presence of God unrecognized he could
[1:22:27] come in the midst and people don't even
[1:22:29] know who he is remember to think that
[1:22:32] God would choose us for relationship but
[1:22:35] the only way he can have Fellowship a
[1:22:37] man is for him to come himself and live
[1:22:40] within me can you say amen amen now I
[1:22:44] have and I have a higher intelligence
[1:22:46] than just human life because human life
[1:22:49] can't even grasp what God is but the
[1:22:52] Holy Ghost can can you say Amen so when
[1:22:54] God says I am that I am there's that
[1:22:57] Holy Ghost down inside of me that says
[1:22:59] yes Lord you are the I am that I am amen
[1:23:03] do you realize the times that we praise
[1:23:05] the lord it's the Holy Ghost quickening
[1:23:07] us amen just to glorify God well how do
[1:23:11] you know he's up there because there's
[1:23:13] something down inside of me that is
[1:23:15] telling me he's alive they're sucking
[1:23:18] down inside of me that's telling me he
[1:23:20] reigns how can you go through their
[1:23:22] trials in peace and joy because there's
[1:23:25] something down inside of me that tells
[1:23:28] me he's all faithful
[1:23:30] Hallelujah
[1:23:34] it's a relationship
[1:23:36] can you say man
[1:23:38] yet mortal beings
[1:23:42] will never comprehend it
[1:23:45] can't
[1:23:47] Isaiah 55 9 God says for as the heavens
[1:23:50] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:23:53] higher than your ways
[1:23:54] and my thoughts higher than your
[1:23:56] thoughts
[1:23:57] now that's god making that statement how
[1:23:59] true it is so how could he have
[1:24:01] fellowship with the people that can't
[1:24:03] even understand him how how can he have
[1:24:06] fellowship with the people amen that
[1:24:09] that don't even comprehend who he is
[1:24:11] amen but he decides Amen to clean this
[1:24:14] whole body out amen that he himself
[1:24:17] could live in us and Quicken our
[1:24:20] thoughts Quicken our thinking amen now
[1:24:23] we can sing the songs Oh How Great Thou
[1:24:26] Art amen we can look at the trees and
[1:24:28] see God we can look at the flower and
[1:24:30] see God we can look it all around us and
[1:24:33] see God it's everywhere can you say man
[1:24:36] amen I can see God in you because I can
[1:24:40] identify his characteristics of who he
[1:24:43] is can you say man you should have been
[1:24:46] out and gone long time ago but there's a
[1:24:48] power that's holding you
[1:24:53] glory Lord
[1:24:57] so what God is and what he does
[1:25:00] is completely
[1:25:02] beyond the the comprehension of man
[1:25:06] job said of the Lord he doeth great
[1:25:08] things past finding out
[1:25:10] yea and wonders without number
[1:25:13] Paul wrote in Romans 11 33
[1:25:16] saying oh the depths of the riches both
[1:25:19] of the wisdom and knowledge of God how
[1:25:22] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[1:25:26] ways past finding out
[1:25:28] in Isaiah 40 and 25 God asked to whom
[1:25:32] then will you liken me or shall I be
[1:25:35] equal
[1:25:36] saith the Holy One Oh my he asked again
[1:25:40] in Isaiah 46 5 to whom will you liking
[1:25:43] me and make me equal and compare me that
[1:25:46] we may be like now you think of it
[1:25:49] because of man's lack of comprehension
[1:25:51] of God they think they can be equal to
[1:25:54] God because of their lack of knowledge
[1:25:56] of who he really is they're trying to be
[1:25:59] God themselves or ain't that right
[1:26:01] they're exalting himself but if you ever
[1:26:03] come into the presence of God and you
[1:26:06] understand who he is it'll melt you it
[1:26:09] it makes you humble it makes you bow
[1:26:11] before him oh how arrogant people can
[1:26:14] get in this day when the presence of God
[1:26:17] comes and they just fold their arms and
[1:26:19] they look and they call it a devil oh my
[1:26:22] God has come down in this age to a
[1:26:25] prophet the angel of the Lord came night
[1:26:27] after night after night and the people
[1:26:30] that set their stonehearted amen but
[1:26:32] there was an elect that says that's God
[1:26:35] Amen that's that that's the one I serve
[1:26:37] I can see his realities
[1:26:43] so we find
[1:26:45] that in the ninth verse of Isaiah 46 God
[1:26:48] said Remember the formal things of old
[1:26:50] for I am God and there is none else
[1:26:53] I am God and there is none like me and
[1:26:57] we say Amen
[1:27:00] amen we ain't trying to find someone
[1:27:03] equal to him amen we are not putting
[1:27:05] ourselves as equal with him he's God and
[1:27:09] I'm so glad that we have that
[1:27:10] comprehension amen that we're able to
[1:27:12] comprehend that there's nobody like our
[1:27:15] Lord amen I'm not going to serve the
[1:27:17] Pope I ain't going to serve some other
[1:27:19] Prophet that has come I'm not going to
[1:27:21] serve anything else I serve my God and
[1:27:24] him alone for I can comprehend his
[1:27:27] attributes
[1:27:31] now the prophet or the he says here I am
[1:27:34] God there's none like me declaring the
[1:27:36] end from the beginning
[1:27:38] keep that in mind declaring the end from
[1:27:40] the beginning
[1:27:42] from ancient times the things that are
[1:27:44] not yet done saying my counsel shall
[1:27:46] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[1:27:49] ain't that right now God could not be
[1:27:52] Supernatural if he was not omniscient or
[1:27:56] omnipotent amen omnipotent and this word
[1:28:00] omnipotent means having unlimited
[1:28:03] Authority
[1:28:04] influence a force of unlimited power how
[1:28:09] many believes God's omnipotent amen he
[1:28:12] could not be Supernatural if he wasn't
[1:28:13] omnipotent amen but when he speaks it's
[1:28:16] omnipotent speaking amen and that is
[1:28:19] with unlimited Authority influence or a
[1:28:23] force of unlimited power amen so of
[1:28:26] course this word is in reference Amen to
[1:28:30] the the power of almighty God Amen
[1:28:33] there's none else that is omnipotent
[1:28:35] amen God is omnipotent amen and so to
[1:28:39] show that he is omnipotent then he shows
[1:28:44] or he performs the supernatural amen God
[1:28:48] is Not Just Like Us that that just that
[1:28:50] works within the realm of humanity but
[1:28:52] he's omnipotent amen and God wants us to
[1:28:55] know that he's omnipotent so he performs
[1:28:58] the supernatural now now you you got to
[1:29:01] know the contrast the laws of God Amen
[1:29:04] you would not know appreciate the day if
[1:29:06] there had not been for the night you're
[1:29:08] not appreciate the the the warm if it
[1:29:10] had not been freezing cold you'd now
[1:29:12] appreciate amen see there's that law of
[1:29:15] contrast so this is why God would choose
[1:29:18] us and make us what we are he made you
[1:29:20] full of weaknesses he made you full of
[1:29:22] failure he'll put your back against the
[1:29:25] wall to where you ain't got no way out
[1:29:27] amen and then he comes as the omnipotent
[1:29:30] one amen and performs the Supernatural
[1:29:33] and then we raise our hands unto him and
[1:29:36] say God I thank you amen because there's
[1:29:39] no one else like you that's why we can
[1:29:42] sing the song There's No One There's No
[1:29:44] One Like Jesus amen there's no one like
[1:29:47] him I've looked I searched I've a world
[1:29:50] over and I found there's no one like him
[1:29:53] why because it took you amen getting in
[1:29:57] your weak your Dark Hour your your time
[1:30:00] to where you can't do nothing about it
[1:30:02] and God steps in and performs the
[1:30:05] supernatural
[1:30:07] ain't that right
[1:30:09] see so so you see a man cannot know God
[1:30:12] without knowing a man that he is
[1:30:15] omnipotent brother Brown said it always
[1:30:18] takes the miraculous to speak of the
[1:30:21] omnipotence of God
[1:30:22] aren't you glad for that so I thank God
[1:30:25] for the miraculous I know we cry and
[1:30:28] then we think you know and all these but
[1:30:30] I think the more mature we get in God
[1:30:32] Amen we come to understand that when we
[1:30:35] Face the trials that we just
[1:30:37] automatically know God's going to bring
[1:30:38] us out
[1:30:39] God's going to bring us out if he done
[1:30:41] it yesterday he can do it today if
[1:30:43] you've done it a year ago I mean I mean
[1:30:44] you you think either go down your path
[1:30:46] you shouldn't be here but God kept you
[1:30:49] amen the times that you wanted to give
[1:30:51] up you're still here there's an
[1:30:53] omnipotent power amen there's an
[1:30:56] omnipotent God that has taken over your
[1:30:58] vessel
[1:31:00] it's true
[1:31:03] and can I say it this way there's
[1:31:04] nothing you can do to kick him out
[1:31:08] for the Bible said you're sealed to the
[1:31:09] day of your Redemption
[1:31:13] your Humanity ain't big enough to kick
[1:31:15] him out
[1:31:16] your failures ain't big enough to kick
[1:31:18] him out
[1:31:19] ah yes sir it's true now your weaknesses
[1:31:23] and your inabilities and all the things
[1:31:25] about you amen and your troubles and and
[1:31:27] now now the church we give God trouble A
[1:31:29] lot of times amen there's times that we
[1:31:32] he wants to go this way and we get so
[1:31:33] confused in our mind we don't know which
[1:31:35] way and and he has to break us he has to
[1:31:38] mold us he has to shape us to finally we
[1:31:40] see the direction but he never left us
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:45] it's omnipotence
[1:31:48] it always takes the miraculous
[1:31:52] the prophet said to speak of the
[1:31:54] omnipotence of God
[1:31:56] brother Rams says omnipotence is the
[1:31:58] all-powerful and it takes the miraculous
[1:32:00] to vindicate the omnipotence and only
[1:32:03] the miraculous can do it teaching of the
[1:32:06] word is very is a very fine thing and it
[1:32:09] come faith comes by hearing and hearing
[1:32:11] the word but it always everybody say it
[1:32:14] always takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:32:17] that the omnipotent still lives and
[1:32:19] Reigns oh God now you know I I think of
[1:32:23] that because Balaam remember we talk
[1:32:25] about Balaam of how he looked at Israel
[1:32:28] and he criticized Israel he saw all
[1:32:30] their hinder Parts he saw and and and he
[1:32:33] looked at them by from a moral
[1:32:35] standpoint and then he says how in the
[1:32:37] world could a God Like That amen a holy
[1:32:40] God look upon a people like that and
[1:32:42] have anything to do with him how could
[1:32:44] he honor them how could he you
[1:32:46] understand what I'm saying how could he
[1:32:48] live among them there ain't no way so he
[1:32:50] decides to curse him and every time he
[1:32:52] opened his stinking mouth to curse them
[1:32:54] God would bless them
[1:32:58] God just blessed them and you know what
[1:33:01] them prophecies are still coming to pass
[1:33:06] that's right but you know what it
[1:33:09] pleased God to live within people
[1:33:11] because it was through them people he
[1:33:14] would show his miraculous power and
[1:33:17] prove that he's still omnipotent
[1:33:23] so brother Brown said it always takes
[1:33:25] the miraculous to vindicate the omnit
[1:33:27] that the omnipotent still lives and
[1:33:29] Reigns and then he says we must
[1:33:32] we must have the miraculous
[1:33:39] we must
[1:33:40] now according to Webster this word
[1:33:43] miraculous means performed
[1:33:46] supernaturally
[1:33:48] I do not work miraculous
[1:33:51] you do not work miraculous
[1:33:53] the pope does not work miraculous Trump
[1:33:57] did not work miraculous Biden sure ain't
[1:34:00] doing it and no other one is going to do
[1:34:03] it
[1:34:04] you understand that miraculous is
[1:34:07] performed by the supernatural
[1:34:11] or by a power beyond the ordinary agency
[1:34:15] of natural laws affected by the direct
[1:34:19] agency of Almighty power and not by
[1:34:22] natural causes
[1:34:25] can you say Amen
[1:34:27] amen we're thankful for what we have in
[1:34:30] the natural amen but that's not
[1:34:32] miraculous medicine does not work the
[1:34:35] miraculous only God can work the
[1:34:37] miraculous ain't that right amen but
[1:34:39] when you get God work in the miraculous
[1:34:41] things change things are transformed the
[1:34:44] situations that you're up against amen
[1:34:47] all of a sudden disappears that's the
[1:34:49] miraculous and you can't explain it by
[1:34:51] human ability but if you can comprehend
[1:34:54] that it's God working for you
[1:34:57] he's working
[1:34:59] he's at work
[1:35:02] God can take the worst vile Sinner and
[1:35:05] transform him into a son of God
[1:35:08] you know what that's why we believe that
[1:35:10] no matter how Wayward our boy girl gets
[1:35:15] I don't care how wavered and then
[1:35:17] Prophet said no matter how wayward
[1:35:23] they can they'll still be saved
[1:35:25] I just believe in that now
[1:35:27] the prophet said if you believe it have
[1:35:29] enough faith for yourself then you
[1:35:30] believe for them
[1:35:32] that's right so it's the supernatural
[1:35:34] now we're looking at the miraculous God
[1:35:36] see he can take the worst case scenario
[1:35:41] and change the situation
[1:35:44] in a moment's time the worst case
[1:35:46] scenario
[1:35:50] he can take the worst diseased infested
[1:35:52] body
[1:35:53] and make it completely whole
[1:35:55] to where there is no sign
[1:35:58] that it ever occurred
[1:36:01] amen I'm thinking of the story of the
[1:36:04] young lady
[1:36:06] that uh raised in church I think I
[1:36:10] believe she was raised in church and
[1:36:12] but she didn't have an experience with
[1:36:13] God Satan got a hold of her mind
[1:36:16] tormenting her
[1:36:18] and she started cutting herself
[1:36:21] and cut her arms and wherever but she
[1:36:25] cut herself she bore scars of all the
[1:36:28] cuts
[1:36:29] you just sit there and cut I I you know
[1:36:31] no human mind no human
[1:36:34] individual in the right mind would do
[1:36:36] that junk
[1:36:38] that's the devil doing that
[1:36:41] right
[1:36:42] but then God got hold of that lady
[1:36:46] Supernatural
[1:36:48] look like a situation that was
[1:36:50] impossible but God worked the
[1:36:52] supernatural
[1:36:53] the miraculous to prove that he was
[1:36:55] still omnipotent
[1:36:59] he saved that girl
[1:37:01] delivered her filled her with the Holy
[1:37:03] Ghost
[1:37:04] and now here she is trying to serve God
[1:37:06] with all them scars
[1:37:08] she felt so ugly
[1:37:10] felt just so rejected it just it just
[1:37:12] you know it messed with her mind and and
[1:37:14] and and to see all these scars of her
[1:37:16] past
[1:37:17] and it came to her God if you could save
[1:37:20] my soul and you could deliver me
[1:37:22] I'm asking you now just to take these
[1:37:24] scars away
[1:37:26] and the omnipotent came in and worked
[1:37:28] the miraculous
[1:37:30] and every one of them scars are gone
[1:37:33] not even a remembrance of what she was
[1:37:35] or what she did see God it takes the
[1:37:39] miraculous to prove that the omnipotent
[1:37:41] God still lives and Reigns can you say
[1:37:44] Amen now these testimonies that we see
[1:37:46] like these things gives us encouragement
[1:37:48] a man that we could go to the darkest
[1:37:51] hours and still lift up holy hands
[1:37:53] without wrath or doubting knowing that
[1:37:55] it's going to be taken care of you're
[1:37:57] walking in his will you're walking
[1:37:58] according to what he wants you to walk
[1:38:00] amen there is nothing that the devil can
[1:38:04] do to hurt you and you say well even if
[1:38:07] you're in Disobedience look look what
[1:38:09] Abraham and God done with Abraham and
[1:38:11] kept Sarah amen and that King from
[1:38:14] touching Sarah amen and said if you
[1:38:16] touch Sarah you're going to destroy a
[1:38:18] nation that I promise would come through
[1:38:20] her and you ain't gonna do that I'll
[1:38:22] kill you right now amen and here Abraham
[1:38:24] was alive he was disobedient he was out
[1:38:27] of the will of God Amen and yet he never
[1:38:30] lost the Covenant
[1:38:33] it was omnipotent God watching over him
[1:38:38] I hope that's all right but it's true
[1:38:41] so all through the Bible God performed
[1:38:46] the miraculous which is something that
[1:38:48] cannot be explained but yet it's true
[1:38:50] and it starts the super the the
[1:38:53] miraculous the supernatural starts in
[1:38:55] Genesis 1 1. in the beginning God
[1:38:59] created the Heaven and Earth
[1:39:01] amen I that's incredible and and we know
[1:39:05] what create means it means to bring into
[1:39:07] existence so God brought the heavens and
[1:39:10] earth into existence he brought light
[1:39:12] into existence he he brought the
[1:39:15] universe into existence amen he brought
[1:39:18] the dirt amen that we live as a walk on
[1:39:22] into existence he he brought the trees
[1:39:25] the flowers the the grass into existence
[1:39:28] he brought man into existence ain't that
[1:39:31] right see at one time it didn't exist
[1:39:35] and now it does exist it took the
[1:39:38] miraculous Amen to do that he he had
[1:39:41] nothing to take from and to make amen
[1:39:44] now we will do that amen we we will we
[1:39:46] will take these elements and make rubber
[1:39:48] amen then from that rubber we'll make a
[1:39:50] tire we'll make we'll make something
[1:39:52] we'll do this we'll take iron and and
[1:39:55] and we'll we'll mold it and and we'll
[1:39:57] make it and and we call that inventions
[1:39:59] or or or or what whatever amen but we
[1:40:03] can never have the power in ourselves to
[1:40:06] bring into existence even the devil has
[1:40:10] no power to bring into existence he has
[1:40:13] to have something to work through but
[1:40:15] here's a God Amen that was before all
[1:40:18] things and yet he would he would bring
[1:40:21] all these things into existence
[1:40:26] ain't that right he created everything
[1:40:28] he brought he brought the oxygen into
[1:40:31] existence there was nowhere there was no
[1:40:34] oxygen he brought the atoms into
[1:40:36] existence he brought the molecules into
[1:40:38] existence oh God and that God that done
[1:40:42] that is now living in a body
[1:40:45] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:40:50] see it's something that he could only do
[1:40:52] by his Supernatural power Colossians 1
[1:40:54] 16 says for by him were all things
[1:40:57] created that are in heaven that are in
[1:40:59] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:41:02] be Thrones or dominions or
[1:41:03] principalities or Powers all things
[1:41:06] everybody say all things were created by
[1:41:09] Him by him and for him amen nothing out
[1:41:13] of place
[1:41:14] the whole thing by him and for him and
[1:41:17] he is before all things and by him all
[1:41:21] things consist ain't that right so it's
[1:41:24] God performing the supernatural amen now
[1:41:28] how did he do this how how did he bring
[1:41:31] this into existence how how was this he
[1:41:34] spoke the creative word
[1:41:37] ain't that right now we're dealing with
[1:41:39] God now because you want to know what
[1:41:41] part what body you are but belong to
[1:41:43] amen what you are to reflect amen seek
[1:41:46] God before he had a body before he had
[1:41:49] you to live in amen he was there all by
[1:41:52] himself amen and and and we we know how
[1:41:55] the prophet says it that that a light
[1:41:57] came from God which was the pillar fire
[1:42:00] the anointed logos the amen uh the
[1:42:03] anointing and he called it the Christ
[1:42:05] ain't that right amen and then God lived
[1:42:07] in that Pillar of Fire right there amen
[1:42:10] and then he spoke Let There Be and when
[1:42:14] he spoke see then the logos that
[1:42:17] anointed that that the the Christ the
[1:42:20] the the the pillar of fire began to
[1:42:22] brood over the Earth amen God's Own
[1:42:25] anointing God's own life begin to brood
[1:42:28] over the earth and the prophet said up
[1:42:30] came azaleas and up came bushes and up
[1:42:32] came trees and up came this and up came
[1:42:35] that at the word of God right amen see
[1:42:38] what was it God was able to bring his
[1:42:41] own word to pass amen what he spoke he
[1:42:45] was able by the miraculous by the
[1:42:47] supernatural by what he is he needed
[1:42:50] nothing else he could bring his own word
[1:42:53] to reality
[1:42:56] ain't that right so you will only see
[1:42:58] God in his word
[1:43:01] that's right Amen brother Brown said
[1:43:03] God's word is God's life and God's power
[1:43:08] ain't that right so uh Psalms 107 20 he
[1:43:12] sent his word and healed them the word
[1:43:15] went before amen he sent his word and
[1:43:19] healed them and delivered them from
[1:43:21] their destruction so his word heals his
[1:43:25] word delivers his word sets free his
[1:43:28] word saves
[1:43:31] his word transforms ain't that right
[1:43:34] brother Brown said I don't know hardly
[1:43:36] what to what more to do than first to
[1:43:39] bring you this word God's word and then
[1:43:42] after that has been brought then God's
[1:43:45] spirit comes down to confirm that word
[1:43:48] signs and wonders and so forth telling
[1:43:50] the people everything just exactly the
[1:43:54] way Supernatural Spirit beings do
[1:43:58] ain't that right see so he he says here
[1:44:02] just uh he says the supernatural
[1:44:04] everybody say the Supernatural is always
[1:44:07] with the word
[1:44:09] the Supernatural is always with the word
[1:44:12] not with not with the some denomination
[1:44:14] not with some name over the church he's
[1:44:17] with the word
[1:44:19] that's why the prophet said the angel of
[1:44:21] the Lord accompanies this message always
[1:44:24] it's the word
[1:44:27] he says any any faith that anybody wants
[1:44:30] to have in the Supernatural it must
[1:44:33] place be placed first in the word of the
[1:44:35] Living God Amen ain't that right that's
[1:44:38] why we don't believe blood coming out of
[1:44:40] hands and we don't it's not in the word
[1:44:43] amen we don't believe in all these
[1:44:45] things I you know uh uh back in in the
[1:44:48] the reservation in in Arizona you know
[1:44:51] uh they got to work in performing the
[1:44:53] Witchcraft in the church and and and
[1:44:55] pyota whatever they do on that trap but
[1:44:58] they got to work in it in the church uh
[1:45:00] the pastor was a uh Indian guy and he
[1:45:03] got what whatever and and he he uh
[1:45:06] actually raised uh uh they said he he
[1:45:10] raised a man sitting on the uh laying on
[1:45:13] the on the floor there and he raised him
[1:45:15] off of the in the air just sitting there
[1:45:19] raising and and and he was trying to
[1:45:21] show that that he can do performing he
[1:45:24] could perform things and that he was a
[1:45:26] powerful thing and everybody needed to
[1:45:27] listen to him
[1:45:29] amen but see that's contrary to the word
[1:45:31] of God
[1:45:33] are you with me that's contrary to the
[1:45:36] word of God
[1:45:40] yes sir that's why it takes the Holy
[1:45:42] Spirit to be able to comprehend God
[1:45:44] and know how he works
[1:45:46] and he only works through his word
[1:45:51] is that right
[1:45:53] so if God's word prophesies the prophet
[1:45:56] said if he if God's word prophesies
[1:45:58] something and God takes the Supernatural
[1:46:00] and proves that it's the truth it's the
[1:46:03] urum summon people time to receive it
[1:46:06] and believe God
[1:46:08] God always manifests himself in
[1:46:11] Supernatural but always everybody say
[1:46:13] always according to his word for he is
[1:46:18] Supernatural
[1:46:21] we're talking about the being that lives
[1:46:22] in you
[1:46:24] he is Supernatural so then be careful of
[1:46:27] anything that's outside of the word of
[1:46:31] God I don't care what they produce I
[1:46:34] don't care what anointing they produce I
[1:46:36] don't care what goes on Amen and you say
[1:46:39] well I've never seen that done before it
[1:46:41] does not matter if it's not according to
[1:46:43] the word leave it alone
[1:46:45] you say well I can't even do them things
[1:46:47] amen well you're not meant to be you
[1:46:50] only can work the supernatural in the
[1:46:52] word
[1:46:58] now the word of God is quick and
[1:47:00] Powerful
[1:47:01] that's what the Bible says
[1:47:03] and Jesus was the word
[1:47:05] he is the word ain't that right notice
[1:47:08] he raised the Dead
[1:47:09] because that's what the word said he
[1:47:10] would do
[1:47:11] calls the blind to see the lame to walk
[1:47:13] cast out Devils he set free those who
[1:47:16] were bound because the word said he
[1:47:18] would do it and the supernatural always
[1:47:21] is in the word
[1:47:23] ain't that right now brother Brown said
[1:47:25] when you receive the word you received
[1:47:26] Jesus for he is the word believe we
[1:47:30] believe that Christ is God's word made
[1:47:32] manifest and we believe that his bride
[1:47:35] must be the same thing
[1:47:38] oh I hope you hope you understand where
[1:47:40] I'm where I'm coming from the word makes
[1:47:43] the difference
[1:47:46] God done it by his word
[1:47:49] the word went forth in the Supernatural
[1:47:51] follows
[1:47:52] ain't that right
[1:47:54] we're not just those Supernatural
[1:47:56] following uh working in us the word must
[1:47:59] be in the bride
[1:48:01] she must be the same thing
[1:48:05] ain't that right remember Jonathan
[1:48:08] Chambers done Miracles just like Moses
[1:48:10] but Moses had the word he was working
[1:48:13] the supernatural based off the word
[1:48:16] there was a message come with that
[1:48:18] Supernatural
[1:48:21] so he says we believe that she must
[1:48:24] believe every bit of the word and have
[1:48:26] that word in her because she is part of
[1:48:29] the body she is the body where he is the
[1:48:31] head ain't that right so what you have
[1:48:34] in you is the word living in you
[1:48:38] you're the body of the word
[1:48:44] so when God said something says
[1:48:46] something then watch the supernatural
[1:48:48] happen and bring the word of God to pass
[1:48:51] this is why God this is why the word of
[1:48:54] God can be very detailed and specific
[1:49:00] and it's foretelling
[1:49:03] because every word of God will come to
[1:49:07] pass
[1:49:08] no guessing
[1:49:12] now I'm going to talk to you for just a
[1:49:14] moment I'll let you go
[1:49:17] in Noah's day God foretold of rain
[1:49:20] coming
[1:49:22] 120 years before it happened
[1:49:26] and it had never happened before
[1:49:30] but yet God told Noah that it would
[1:49:33] happen and Noah was so convinced
[1:49:36] that he never used the words now y'all
[1:49:39] better be ready just in case something
[1:49:41] happens
[1:49:43] hello he didn't leave it in general
[1:49:47] because he's talking to Mortal beings
[1:49:49] that always something going to happen
[1:49:55] but God was specific
[1:49:57] and he told Noah you tell them
[1:49:59] specifically what's going to happen
[1:50:02] it's going to rain
[1:50:04] yes it become a laughing stop Noah
[1:50:06] became a laughing stock of it because
[1:50:08] they proved that there was no rain up
[1:50:10] there
[1:50:11] they proved that there were and they
[1:50:14] would ask for proof and Noah had no
[1:50:16] proof but God said so
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:19] but that's all the proof he needed and
[1:50:22] that's all the proof that the elect
[1:50:24] needed
[1:50:26] can you say amen and God took 120 years
[1:50:30] to fulfill it but it happened
[1:50:34] then you say Amen what happened the
[1:50:37] supernatural took place
[1:50:39] he foretold of Israel God foretold of
[1:50:41] Israel being in bondage in Egypt uh
[1:50:44] years before it happened and and how
[1:50:46] that they would be delivered and go into
[1:50:48] the land that he had gave them and it
[1:50:51] happened just that way
[1:50:54] ain't that right he foretold of the
[1:50:57] Messiah coming to Earth and what he
[1:50:59] would be and do and it happened just
[1:51:01] that way
[1:51:03] now Jesus there in Matthew 24 35 Heaven
[1:51:07] and Earth shall pass away but my words
[1:51:09] shall never pass away ain't that right
[1:51:13] shall not pass away again Jesus said the
[1:51:16] words that I speak unto you they are
[1:51:18] spirit and they are life
[1:51:22] so the spirit gives life to the word the
[1:51:25] prophet said
[1:51:26] ain't that right so that's why you not
[1:51:29] only have the word but you have the
[1:51:31] spirit working in you
[1:51:34] the word living inside of you pull Satan
[1:51:37] inside of you so man's word will fail
[1:51:41] but the supernatural will never fail
[1:51:47] ain't that right
[1:51:48] and man's word fails because the
[1:51:50] supernatural's not there to back it up
[1:51:52] God only backs up his own word
[1:51:55] can you say that with me God only backs
[1:51:58] up his own word
[1:52:01] story Romans 3 4 says let God be true
[1:52:05] but every man a liar
[1:52:07] ain't that right
[1:52:09] so now when man speaks man cannot
[1:52:11] predict the future and be accurate in
[1:52:14] his prediction because he has no power
[1:52:17] to make his prediction come to pass
[1:52:20] ain't that right
[1:52:21] we have our weather Prophets
[1:52:24] and they'll give us the weather plan and
[1:52:26] all these things and then it don't
[1:52:27] happen
[1:52:28] but we just say well you know we could
[1:52:31] get upset and say well I thought they
[1:52:32] said it was going to be sunny now I hear
[1:52:33] it's raining all that and stuff but we
[1:52:36] already know that they ain't gods
[1:52:38] they they can't work the supernatural
[1:52:41] they're understanding their future
[1:52:43] prediction is leaning upon scientific
[1:52:45] knowledge
[1:52:46] but when God said something it's going
[1:52:49] to happen just that way
[1:52:51] ain't that right so God can forekel
[1:52:53] something to happen and it'll come to
[1:52:55] pass because the word is coming from the
[1:52:58] supernatural
[1:53:01] then if that be the case then God can be
[1:53:03] so precise
[1:53:05] and what he says and give us the
[1:53:08] specific details about it example the
[1:53:12] Lord showed brother Branham
[1:53:14] you know that a boy would raise from the
[1:53:16] dead after being hit by a car
[1:53:18] ain't that right now he didn't just say
[1:53:21] a boy going to be hit by a car
[1:53:23] well
[1:53:25] if I can sit this way duh if he'd say
[1:53:28] that I mean how many boys that day were
[1:53:30] going to be hit by a car worldwide
[1:53:34] but then he begins to gives the specific
[1:53:36] details
[1:53:38] he's gonna be brown haired
[1:53:40] he'll be brown eyed he'll be about eight
[1:53:43] years old
[1:53:44] he describes how awful it was but then
[1:53:47] he looks and says it's going to be in a
[1:53:49] rocky land there'll be mountains
[1:53:51] there'll be rocks all around it and he
[1:53:54] began to describe the details of this
[1:53:56] event
[1:53:57] and then he begins to tell the around
[1:53:59] the world
[1:54:00] two years before it happens
[1:54:04] now he forgot about it
[1:54:07] he tells him how he walked upon the
[1:54:09] scene
[1:54:10] looks at and says oh my
[1:54:12] that's a hopeless case that is so bad
[1:54:16] and getting ready to turn away and
[1:54:20] something
[1:54:22] grips his heart
[1:54:24] and he turns around and looks at that
[1:54:26] boy
[1:54:28] looks around the landscape and says I've
[1:54:31] seen this before
[1:54:34] right
[1:54:35] and he tells the brother that was with
[1:54:37] him says go get your Bible
[1:54:40] he come and got his Bible says Now read
[1:54:42] that Vision that I told you about and he
[1:54:44] began to read and there it all was it
[1:54:46] was all described he said now stop it
[1:54:48] from happening
[1:54:51] he said there was no devil to stop that
[1:54:54] boy from Raising from the dead because
[1:54:55] it had already been prophesied
[1:54:57] God had given the details already there
[1:55:00] and that boy raised from the dead and
[1:55:03] remember the mama of the other boy said
[1:55:05] well if you can do that then do this one
[1:55:06] he says I can't do it I don't know he
[1:55:09] said she said well will my boy live he
[1:55:11] says I don't know God showed me that boy
[1:55:14] of course he went and prayed for the boy
[1:55:16] and the boy live but as far as for the
[1:55:18] vision he didn't have none
[1:55:21] but what I'm saying is God can be
[1:55:23] specific when he speaks it's specific
[1:55:30] oh do you love him
[1:55:31] see so God is not limited time and he's
[1:55:34] not bound by circumstances therefore he
[1:55:37] can foretell of something to happen to
[1:55:39] the exact place the exact time way
[1:55:42] before it happens you realize God spoke
[1:55:45] through the prophet Nahum in the Old
[1:55:47] Testament telling of our cars and our
[1:55:49] highways
[1:55:53] like that Ryan
[1:55:55] he didn't just say way I say to you that
[1:55:57] something's going to be out there I see
[1:55:59] something I just don't know what it you
[1:56:00] know but something's happening
[1:56:03] he told us exactly what it would be
[1:56:08] I also believe that God told of our
[1:56:10] media coverage too
[1:56:13] in our our technology that we have
[1:56:17] you look at Revelations 8 and 8 for
[1:56:20] tells of the two prophets that would be
[1:56:22] killed in Jerusalem and their dead
[1:56:23] bodies shall lie on the street of the
[1:56:25] great city which spiritually is called
[1:56:27] Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was
[1:56:30] crucified and they of the people in
[1:56:32] kindreds and tongues and Nations shall
[1:56:34] see their dead body
[1:56:36] how's that going to happen
[1:56:38] now we know how it will happen
[1:56:40] he'll be all over the media
[1:56:44] can you say Amen
[1:56:45] God knows what's going to happen
[1:56:48] and he can tell exactly what would be
[1:56:50] and probably when it was written when
[1:56:52] John wrote this in the Book of
[1:56:53] Revelation they're thinking how in the
[1:56:54] world can that happen it takes us months
[1:56:56] just to get from one country to another
[1:56:58] country by ship
[1:57:02] but see he foretells that the whole
[1:57:05] world would see the event take place and
[1:57:08] this was foretold nearly 2 000 years
[1:57:10] before internet and television and all
[1:57:12] that took place
[1:57:14] can you say Amen
[1:57:16] God foretold of the destruction of of
[1:57:19] Jerusalem and and and and there in
[1:57:23] Ezekiel 9 I'm not going to read it for
[1:57:25] the sake of time that Ezekiel 9 and 3
[1:57:28] through 7. he foretelled foretells of
[1:57:30] the destruction of of Jerusalem and
[1:57:33] foretold it 900 years before it ever
[1:57:37] happened
[1:57:39] ain't that right
[1:57:40] and then Here Comes Jesus Amen in his
[1:57:44] day forewarning his disciples of this
[1:57:46] same event
[1:57:48] Matthew in Matthew 24 15 through 18 and
[1:57:51] and tell them when you therefore uh uh
[1:57:54] shall see uh the abomination of
[1:57:56] desolation spoken of by uh Daniel the
[1:57:59] Prophet and stand in the Holy place
[1:58:00] whosoever readeth let him understand
[1:58:02] then let them which be in Judea flee
[1:58:05] into the mountains let him which is on
[1:58:08] the housetop not come down to take
[1:58:10] anything out of his house neither let
[1:58:12] him which is in the field return back to
[1:58:15] take his clothes ain't that right this
[1:58:18] was fulfilled in 80 70 through Titus
[1:58:22] ain't that right brother Brown said
[1:58:24] Titus brought this great Army of Romans
[1:58:27] and Greeks and compassed the walls of
[1:58:29] Jerusalem pinned those people in there
[1:58:30] now they starve to death they barked
[1:58:33] from the trees Josephus the great
[1:58:35] historian tells us see they ate grass
[1:58:38] off the ground they even bowled one
[1:58:40] another's children and eat it as as they
[1:58:42] were mad people see then when finally
[1:58:45] Titus he was setting back upon the heels
[1:58:47] around Jerusalem and saw those people in
[1:58:49] there and thought they were doing the
[1:58:50] see those people thought they were doing
[1:58:52] the will of God when they saw these
[1:58:54] armies Marching In they had refused to
[1:58:56] hear the great Master Lord Jesus tell
[1:58:58] them that but notice he says there
[1:59:01] wasn't one of them Christians caught in
[1:59:04] there for they saw the sign and moved
[1:59:08] aren't you glad that God is specific in
[1:59:10] what he does
[1:59:13] he made sure to let them know the
[1:59:15] details
[1:59:17] ain't that right so they won't be
[1:59:19] confused and said I wonder if this is
[1:59:21] the vent or something else is going to
[1:59:22] happen
[1:59:24] they knew exactly when it was going to
[1:59:26] happen
[1:59:27] and not one Christian not one believer
[1:59:29] that stood with the message of the hour
[1:59:31] was caught in there
[1:59:36] yes sir
[1:59:39] to see they said he said let them that's
[1:59:42] on the housetop not come down or him
[1:59:44] that's in the field go back not take his
[1:59:46] coat but flee into Judea see pray that
[1:59:48] your flat not be in the winter time or
[1:59:50] on the Sabbath because in the winter
[1:59:51] time the heels would be full of snow and
[1:59:53] on the Sabbath day the doors would be
[1:59:55] closed the gate see and they'd be caught
[1:59:57] in that condition see so so we find now
[2:00:01] I've read this I'll read it again Isaiah
[2:00:03] 46-9 remember the former things of old
[2:00:05] for I am God and there is none else
[2:00:09] see that's the body that you are of is
[2:00:11] the god that there is none else
[2:00:13] amen I am God and there's none like me
[2:00:16] declaring the end from the beginning
[2:00:18] from the ancient times the things that
[2:00:20] are not yet done saying my counsel shall
[2:00:22] stand and I will do all my pleasure I
[2:00:26] say to you that's the way of God
[2:00:30] I hope it's okay
[2:00:33] when the word of the Lord came to the
[2:00:35] prophets they were specific in every
[2:00:37] detail
[2:00:39] that even when the prophet spoke they
[2:00:41] didn't even understand it they even
[2:00:43] wondered how it would be their human
[2:00:46] comprehension how could these things
[2:00:48] happen and yet it happened
[2:00:51] and they would speak the word of the
[2:00:53] Lord in detail and then they would go by
[2:00:55] the way of the grave but yet that word
[2:00:57] that came out of their mouth was settled
[2:01:00] forever
[2:01:02] ain't that right so example Isaiah
[2:01:05] prophesied Behold a virgin shall
[2:01:07] conceive
[2:01:09] he didn't Now Behold a woman shall
[2:01:11] conceive
[2:01:14] he was specific detailed a virgin will
[2:01:18] conceive
[2:01:20] now that that throws the question out
[2:01:22] there how in the world could a virgin
[2:01:23] conceive it wasn't Isaiah's words
[2:01:27] it was Supernatural God that took the
[2:01:29] lips of that man and began to speak it
[2:01:32] used his vocal cords and began to speak
[2:01:34] to a people amen and prophesy that
[2:01:37] there's coming a time that the
[2:01:39] impossibility will happen and I'll be
[2:01:41] the omnipotent one that makes it happen
[2:01:45] ain't that right
[2:01:47] yes sir a virgin shall conceive
[2:01:50] you know today we've had in the
[2:01:53] Pentecostal movement you know a lot of
[2:01:55] prophecies a lot of gifts a lot of
[2:01:58] speaking and tongues interpretation and
[2:02:00] tongues and and you find you know when I
[2:02:04] say you can but you know when when man
[2:02:07] prophesies
[2:02:10] he just tells us what we already know
[2:02:13] and he you know he'll tell us well the
[2:02:15] Lord's coming be quick you know make
[2:02:17] yourself ready yeah I say make yourself
[2:02:19] ready
[2:02:23] well that's all fine and good
[2:02:25] but we didn't need a prophecy for that
[2:02:32] if you read your Bible
[2:02:34] you know the Lord said he's coming
[2:02:37] it's our pretty
[2:02:39] specific about the details as it was in
[2:02:42] the days of lot as it was in the days of
[2:02:44] Noah as they were given in marriage and
[2:02:46] drinking and you marrying and giving in
[2:02:48] marriage you understand you you know the
[2:02:50] Scriptures it was detailed to where you
[2:02:52] could look and say this is the age the
[2:02:54] Lord is coming
[2:02:56] ain't that right I've seen him look out
[2:02:59] in the audience and maybe you have two
[2:03:00] look out across the audience of a
[2:03:02] thousand people and say well
[2:03:05] um
[2:03:06] the Lord shows me there's someone here
[2:03:07] that's got a heart condition
[2:03:13] not to
[2:03:15] say anything wrong I could do that
[2:03:22] I could do it this morning
[2:03:25] so oh somebody's got some problems
[2:03:30] foreign
[2:03:33] and I ain't trying to be funny I'm just
[2:03:36] trying to tell you truth
[2:03:41] and if you're gullible enough you say
[2:03:43] boy he hit me this morning
[2:03:46] the Lord spoke to me
[2:03:54] so we find but God man has to be vague
[2:03:59] because he starts telling my new details
[2:04:02] about people's lives
[2:04:04] he gonna miss it
[2:04:09] but God don't have to be vague
[2:04:13] God don't have to leave it out in
[2:04:15] general
[2:04:15] and we've seen it Time After Time After
[2:04:19] Time in this age
[2:04:21] and not one of them failed to be wrong
[2:04:25] then you say Amen
[2:04:27] why because God has an infinite mind and
[2:04:30] he knows the end from the beginning
[2:04:32] ain't that right he could tell you what
[2:04:34] you've done 30 years ago he could tell
[2:04:37] you what happened you may be a hundred
[2:04:38] years old he could tell you what
[2:04:39] happened at Birth
[2:04:41] sure
[2:04:43] ain't that right
[2:04:45] he could tell everything about it now
[2:04:48] the prophet says here he says see uh uh
[2:04:51] uh many of you strangers perhaps hear
[2:04:53] these men get up and make these remarks
[2:04:55] about a message of this hour and so
[2:04:57] forth what they are getting at is God's
[2:05:00] promise of this hour
[2:05:03] that he promised what he would do see
[2:05:05] and we see him scripturally vindicating
[2:05:07] just exactly what he said he would do in
[2:05:11] the same manner
[2:05:12] now God didn't just take one scripture
[2:05:15] and prophesy of this age you can take
[2:05:17] scripture after scripture after
[2:05:19] scripture after scripture both Old and
[2:05:21] New Testament of what God promised for
[2:05:24] this age and not one scripture will fail
[2:05:27] malachia has been fulfilled do you
[2:05:30] believe that Luke 17 30 is fulfilled
[2:05:32] Revelations is fulfilled Ephesians is
[2:05:35] scriptures about Ephesians amen of what
[2:05:38] God promised in this day is being
[2:05:40] fulfilled
[2:05:43] it's true
[2:05:45] so we find see he says see uh uh uh we
[2:05:49] see him scripturally vindicating just
[2:05:51] exactly what he said he would do in the
[2:05:53] same manner foretold his just exactly
[2:05:56] perfectly each time because it's God
[2:05:59] saying it now if a man I don't care who
[2:06:01] he is will try to make such a prediction
[2:06:03] there's one chance out of 10 million
[2:06:07] one chance
[2:06:08] if a man told you a certain thing would
[2:06:10] happen and it would happen at a certain
[2:06:13] time one out of 10 million
[2:06:15] and then the place it would happen would
[2:06:18] be about one chance out of a hundred
[2:06:21] million and then the time it would
[2:06:24] happen and goes on and on and on the way
[2:06:26] it will happen and what will be
[2:06:28] happening and so forth and see it's just
[2:06:31] beyond a guess when we see it so
[2:06:34] perfectly each and every time then we
[2:06:36] know it's of God
[2:06:39] now I'm going to tell you if God can
[2:06:40] take a seventh grade educated uh
[2:06:43] Kentuckian that didn't hardly know
[2:06:45] anything about anything you understand
[2:06:47] what I'm saying amen I'm not putting him
[2:06:49] down but I believe God done that for a
[2:06:51] reason to show his miraculous in uh
[2:06:55] omnipotent power working through an
[2:06:57] individual
[2:06:59] he didn't take some educated man he took
[2:07:01] a dumb uh uh uh a poor uh Kentuckian
[2:07:04] amen and revealed his miraculous works
[2:07:08] and if God could take that man and and
[2:07:10] prophesy and tell it and it would happen
[2:07:13] just exactly the way it happened why
[2:07:16] can't he do us the same way
[2:07:20] I don't think we ought to use our gifts
[2:07:21] and guess
[2:07:27] is okay
[2:07:30] I like the story of the
[2:07:33] time the woman went up in prayer line
[2:07:35] brother Brown told her address you live
[2:07:36] on such and such street
[2:07:39] brother Perry green says that
[2:07:42] that woman come down and happened to sit
[2:07:44] right in front of him
[2:07:47] and her friend
[2:07:49] looked over there and told her and he
[2:07:51] heard it he says she she told that lady
[2:07:53] says but you don't live on that you
[2:07:56] don't live on that address your address
[2:07:58] is so and so and the lady says oh I
[2:08:00] forgot to tell you
[2:08:02] I just moved yesterday
[2:08:06] see God keeps up with it
[2:08:10] God keeps up with it
[2:08:12] here God just changed Abraham and
[2:08:14] Sarah's name from Abram and Sarah to
[2:08:17] Abraham and Sarah and when God showed up
[2:08:20] in Melchizedek he didn't call her Sarai
[2:08:22] he said where is Sarah thy wife he knew
[2:08:25] exactly because he's the one that
[2:08:26] changed it and now he's standing in a
[2:08:29] human body looking right at Abraham and
[2:08:31] Discerning and being specific with what
[2:08:33] just happened
[2:08:35] no guesswork
[2:08:37] now God places nine nine spiritual gifts
[2:08:40] in his church you believe that two of
[2:08:42] them is Gifts of tongues and the gift of
[2:08:44] interpretation of tongues and they are
[2:08:46] not meant to be used by man
[2:08:49] they are meant to be used of God do you
[2:08:51] believe that they are not to exalt a man
[2:08:54] they are used to exalt gold and to edify
[2:08:57] the Church of the Living God they are
[2:08:59] used to show that God is still alive and
[2:09:01] that he's still omnipotent that when the
[2:09:03] when it's done and when it's said and
[2:09:04] when it happens we can all say God's
[2:09:07] been with us today that God has spoken
[2:09:09] directly to us
[2:09:11] can you say Amen now so God put them in
[2:09:15] the church for when he has something to
[2:09:17] say
[2:09:21] so then they are you to be used in a
[2:09:23] supernatural way
[2:09:25] ain't that right
[2:09:27] now this is just for my church okay for
[2:09:29] us speaking in tongues and
[2:09:31] interpretation of tongues must not be
[2:09:33] you know brother Brian said just the
[2:09:35] quoting of scripture because God doesn't
[2:09:37] use vain repetition it must be everybody
[2:09:40] say it must be a direct message to the
[2:09:44] church
[2:09:46] he says it couldn't be now like Jesus is
[2:09:49] coming soon well we know that and other
[2:09:51] things that the scriptures declared it
[2:09:53] would be something like this tell thus
[2:09:55] saith the Lord tell tell brother Jones
[2:09:57] to get away from that place where he
[2:09:59] lives for it's near a railroad track and
[2:10:01] for tomorrow at two o'clock there's
[2:10:03] going to be a wreck there and his house
[2:10:05] will be destroyed
[2:10:07] what that's something specific that's a
[2:10:10] direct message
[2:10:12] ain't that right or tell brother Branham
[2:10:14] that tonight there will be somebody in
[2:10:16] from a certain place that's got a
[2:10:17] certain disease be dressed a certain way
[2:10:19] and he shall go to them they'll be
[2:10:21] brought in tonight by ambulance and tell
[2:10:23] them that this thing that's against them
[2:10:25] it's thus saith Lord
[2:10:27] specific
[2:10:29] another place the first thing you know
[2:10:31] when the message is over the healing
[2:10:33] line Starts Here Comes the woman a woman
[2:10:35] someone spoke in tongues and she said
[2:10:37] she was and said she was coming every
[2:10:39] one of us knows what's going to happen
[2:10:41] every one of us knows it see see how the
[2:10:44] faith begins to build with them tongues
[2:10:46] of fire standing over you now she's
[2:10:48] she's began to accumulate together why
[2:10:51] it's just a finished work that's all see
[2:10:53] that woman he said I'll say you know
[2:10:55] Miss so-and-so from New York setting
[2:10:57] here oh that's right well how did you
[2:10:59] know that it's a message from the Lord
[2:11:01] to the church when you were 16 years old
[2:11:04] wasn't you at a certain certain place
[2:11:06] and done take some money from the church
[2:11:08] and stole it and went out and got new
[2:11:09] clothes with it oh that's right that is
[2:11:11] right see that's exactly what God has
[2:11:14] told us tonight through brother so and
[2:11:15] so spoke with tongues see brother so and
[2:11:18] so interpreted brother so and so here of
[2:11:21] the discernment said it was from the
[2:11:22] Lord and that's the truth yes then thus
[2:11:25] said the Lord go make it right and
[2:11:26] you'll get over your cancer
[2:11:29] see it's a specific message
[2:11:32] [Music]
[2:11:35] brother Jones goes home gets the wagons
[2:11:37] backs up gets his furniture gets away
[2:11:39] from there two o'clock tomorrow
[2:11:40] afternoon brother Brown makes a sound
[2:11:42] illustrate
[2:11:44] and goals the whole thing off see then
[2:11:47] the church glorifies thank you Lord
[2:11:49] Jesus for your goodness now see that's
[2:11:52] what that's what it is to edify for the
[2:11:55] church
[2:11:56] now if it doesn't happen after they've
[2:11:58] said it then you've got an evil spirit
[2:11:59] among you and you don't want that evil
[2:12:01] thing why do you want something evil
[2:12:03] when the skies are full of Pentecostal
[2:12:06] real
[2:12:08] can you say Amen see what is it it's God
[2:12:11] the supernatural God working through his
[2:12:14] body
[2:12:17] hope you understand
[2:12:19] nope God doesn't change because he comes
[2:12:21] inside of you
[2:12:23] he's still infinite
[2:12:25] so when he really speaks to a man when
[2:12:27] he speaks to a boy girl whatever it
[2:12:29] would be he can be very detailed and
[2:12:32] specific why not to glorify that man
[2:12:35] and actually brother Branham says that a
[2:12:37] man can prophesy one time and the Lord
[2:12:39] never use him again to prophesy
[2:12:43] foreign
[2:12:45] see so there's nothing vague when it
[2:12:48] comes to the prophecies concerning this
[2:12:50] day God foretold of it just about every
[2:12:53] scripture in the Bible he foretold us
[2:12:55] that God would send a prophet ain't that
[2:12:58] right to us and that Prophet would have
[2:13:00] the spirit of Elijah upon him which is
[2:13:03] the Holy Ghost
[2:13:04] God foretold that his ministry would be
[2:13:06] that of Melchizedek
[2:13:08] he foretold that he would get the bride
[2:13:11] just as Eliezer got a bride for Isaac
[2:13:14] you see all these types in the Bible
[2:13:16] were speaking of something to come
[2:13:21] now we can see through the ministry of
[2:13:23] brother Branham and we can compare the
[2:13:25] ministry with them types and then
[2:13:27] prophes to say it's been fulfilled
[2:13:32] ain't that right
[2:13:33] now it rests our soul to where we don't
[2:13:36] have to look for another
[2:13:38] it's happened
[2:13:40] oh do you love him
[2:13:42] Oh My My My I love him see so when it
[2:13:46] came time for these scriptures to be
[2:13:48] fulfilled there was nothing vague about
[2:13:50] it churches denied it preachers denied
[2:13:53] it Pope denied it everybody denied it
[2:13:55] but that little elect saw the scriptures
[2:13:57] that begin to compare it with scripture
[2:13:59] to scripture the ministry scripture
[2:14:01] actions with scripture miraculous with
[2:14:03] scripture everything typed it everything
[2:14:05] mass and then we can say he's the one
[2:14:12] oh the Lord is good
[2:14:16] I still believe God's moving in the
[2:14:18] bride today
[2:14:22] I still believe that the miraculous is
[2:14:24] working
[2:14:26] speaking of an omnipotent God
[2:14:29] the supernatural can you say man
[2:14:32] got more to go
[2:14:33] but if the musicians will come
[2:14:38] brother Brown said many of you strangers
[2:14:40] perhaps hear these men get up make
[2:14:42] remarks
[2:14:48] he said see you're talking about the the
[2:14:51] the one out of chance which I've read a
[2:14:53] lot of these things
[2:14:54] he says see he says it's just beyond the
[2:14:57] guess when we see it so perfectly each
[2:15:00] and every time then it's God then we
[2:15:02] turn right back in the Scriptures it may
[2:15:06] seem foreign to us
[2:15:08] but we turn right back in the scriptures
[2:15:11] without even knowing where to look
[2:15:14] think of that we don't even know where
[2:15:16] to look and the Holy Spirit brings out
[2:15:20] and just puts the whole word together
[2:15:22] makes the picture there to show us just
[2:15:24] the hour that we're living
[2:15:28] aren't you glad for the supernatural God
[2:15:32] it's a miracle
[2:15:34] it's the miraculous that you believe in
[2:15:36] this message
[2:15:37] it's the miraculous that you can see the
[2:15:40] message in the Bible
[2:15:42] how else would we know where to look
[2:15:45] except he quickened it to us
[2:15:48] oh may God bless you this morning you
[2:15:51] love him
[2:15:53] I honestly believe that if you look in
[2:15:56] the scriptures there's nothing vague
[2:15:58] about the prophecies concerning the
[2:16:00] bride
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:04] oh my
[2:16:06] God could so Quicken it to us
[2:16:09] we could look and see if we're part of
[2:16:11] this
[2:16:12] we could see it working we can see it
[2:16:14] moving
[2:16:16] see what part we have to play in this
[2:16:18] age
[2:16:19] amen so wonderful can you say man
[2:16:23] amen it's and and and
[2:16:26] it's so clear it's so pacifically
[2:16:29] detailed brother branham's Ministry was
[2:16:31] so detailed and and and clear in the
[2:16:36] prophecies
[2:16:38] that it would take a blind man
[2:16:41] a man would have to be blind
[2:16:47] and the prophecies concerning the bride
[2:16:49] is so clear
[2:16:50] in detail
[2:16:54] that it would take a man I'd have to be
[2:16:56] blind not to see it
[2:16:59] but I'm so glad God has given us the
[2:17:01] Isaac
[2:17:03] to open our eyes
[2:17:05] Hallelujah you love him
[2:17:08] amen what song are we singing

[2:30:31] the whole body of Jesus Christ
[2:30:33] [Music]
[2:30:36] reflect himself more and more not just
[2:30:39] to you
[2:30:40] but in you
[2:30:42] and through you amen
[2:30:45] may we just bow our heads and as we
[2:30:48] close
[2:30:50] brother AJ would you want to dismiss us
[2:30:53] in prayer
[2:30:55] [Music]
