always enjoy having fellowship with other uh Believers amen and uh so we uh we all you know everyone's fighting battles and sometimes you know it may seem like you're just isolated and and going just by yourself but when when you get around Believers then you you realize that it's it's everybody fighting but everybody Victorious everybody's we're we're you know we're we're we're Overcomers that's the bride of Christ is is overcoming and uh so we thank the Lord for that brother Andrew is ministering in Canada today or this weekend and so I told him we'd be praying for him and uh the Lord would just give him an outpouring uh preaching there at brother Kelly hilderbrand and um um that place up in that area has just gone it's a war torn area as well years and years and years of just uh uh struggles and things and if you haven't met brother Kelly he's just a wonderful man and uh got to meet him last year there in Oklahoma and um he's just held things together and and um I certainly appreciate him and so I know that area is uh going through some things right now and so um we just want to pray for brother Andrew the Lord just using today in a special way amen before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and um ask the Lord to be with us father Lord your Prophet told us that we can do a lot of things too much we can read we can um we can work we can do all these things too much but we can never pray too much and father that is something that my heart's desire and and I'm sure the church here the folks is we we want a spirit of prayer to come upon us father and Lord um and I know there's been prayer throughout the service today but we're once again praying to you and just asking Lord that you would just move in a special way in this part of the service Lord I pray that you would anoint uh myself father help me to get myself out of the way and Lord I pray that you would anoint the people father we we see the the day approaching of your coming and Lord the world is getting so wicked and so contrary to your word father we need your word more than ever before father God may we fortify ourselves behind it and believe it with all that's within us anoint Faith Lord within every one of us father I pray Lord that you would bless and meet every need present even those that are maybe listening online father I pray you'd go in their home and may your presence just feel the place we at ask it father in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord aren't you glad to be a Christian amen amen uh we want to look at uh Philippians 2 and 14 it says do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom ye shine as lights in the world now we we know that the light has come in this age holding forth the Word of Life the word for the day that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain amen you can have your seats this morning of course it would seem that Paul is speaking uh to the people of his age and rightly so but I believe that this scripture would apply to us for Paul had laid the foundation and every every age has been tied to that Foundation that elect and if we fail as the the end we know that we're in the finishing up we are the finale if we were to fail then even he would have run in vain all those that have ran before us would have run in vain so then I believe that this is um uh important amen and this scripture would uh be applicable to us today I'm going to just use the title again and speak along the lines that we have been speaking and that's overcoming the age of lukewarmness yes and uh maybe go through uh uh church history and um and um just continue along the thought it may not get to it all today but um uh hopefully it'll be a help but thinking of this word perverse because he says to stand shining forth light that you may be blameless without rebuke in a perverse crooked uh Nation or generation or world and this word perverse means turned away from what is right or good uh uh other words for for perverse would be corrupt or corruption one definition is obstinate in opposing what is Right reasonable or accepted and they put that word wrongheaded uh Wayward or perverted and so uh this is what perverse means a perverted Nation a perverted and we believe that we are living in a perverted world today he a if there's ever a perverted generation we're we're living in it and the prophet said that it is perverted it's perverted mentally sexually physically and everything it's everything is is perverted and and he he he says you know he says that there are more unbelievers than we've ever had before you you you whatever age it would be from time to now there's more more unbelievers than ever before but notice what he would tell us he said they were ecclesiastical type of unbelievers so he wants to show us a the perversion we we see the perversion as far as uh you know men uh going to bed with men women going to bed with women that's perversion we we see the transgenders um you know men becoming women and or trying to become women they're not but uh trying to become women women trying to become men that's perversion we we see even marriages uh Fallen apart and and uh uh that's perversion we we see um uh and and and the reason why we would say that because God never intended for marriages to be broken he just never did uh and so we see a sign of perversion in everything uh in in in the world but brother brandham when he come he pointed the perversion in in the church and and so he he looked and he said they're they're ecclesiastical type of unbelievers and he says he said they they are the hardest the hardest to deal with uh than just plain uneducated Heathen that lives you know in the jungles of Africa or whatever and don't know what is left or right don't know how to write their names and all of that and we would call that Heathen you know but uh uh uh he said the worst the hardest to deal with is easy ecclesiastical uh unbelievers and and you know um and and so brother Bram talking about just the the the Heathen you know and the the jungles of Africa he said he comes in in his condition he never heard of God and now he wants to see something and as soon as you can prove to him what's truth he will accept it he said but the educated Heathen he said now he wants to draw his own opinion about it uh see because he knows so much about it you know and he can't just humble himself just to Faith and to look at God's word and and so we find that was the same thing that Jesus had to deal with in his day was was Pharisees and sadu es and and these things and and and and they were uh uh ecclesiastical unbelievers because they refused to look at the word of God even though it was standing right there being made manifest before them and they didn't want to see it so uh uh uh then so we could say there there is a perversion the perversion that we're seeing and and and when I'm speaking of that I'm speaking of perversion of all sorts is not just to big cities it's it's it's and it's not just to a America alone but this perversion is worldwide it's it's it's hitting everywhere it's it's it's it's hitting the poor the rich the smart the not so smart uh just you know uh uh it's it's in every place and and we're living in a time where more people claim to be Christian than any other time and so but when we study the the the the scriptures and church history we see that it's a perversion of what Christianity ought to ought to be there there is a perversion and and so uh um brother Brandon would tell us a Christian is a Christian because Christ lives in that person and Christian means Christlike not a membership but see it's a Vindication God producing through you just what a Christian is it's you getting out of the way and letting God come in and you taking no thoughts about it see let the mind that was in Christ be in you there you are that's the real Christian how many believes that that's the real Christian that's exactly what Adam was before he fell was that God could could flow through him and he had strictly the mind of Christ that that he had the authority that's where the authority came from was God a man having the preeminence over Mankind and when Adam spoke it was as though God was speaking he was standing in the place of God God spoke let there be light and and there was light and God created things by his word but now he created a man that would become his agent that that now he would speak and and it would be as though God himself was speaking amen see and so that is the Christian today that God has so uh uh uh has been working on that's the vision and here we are in the completion of of God's thoughts in this day and so now uh God looking for that real Christian because after sin had come the channel had been broken and and and we we know what what had done and so God working to bring that real Christian back that real that Adam and Eve uh uh back as it was in the garden before sin come along uh he purchased by his blood a a people we are a blood bought people and and and God made a way to to break the power of sin and and these things and on the day of Pentecost he was able to to uh after his Ascension he was able to bring back his spirit amen not upon just one man that was virgin born as as Christ was but he was able to take a group of sex born people that was Sinners and that was a perversion in in their their birth and and these things and and and produce real Christians amen that his Spirit would come into them and produce real Christians and and we see that acts 2 and one when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord and in one place uh and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost not all filled with an emotion not all filled with with Sensations and and and and things but filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance can you say Amen uh uh just to say this usually when the day of Pentecost is is mentioned uh um you know the people speaking with other tongues and as the spirit gave them utterance that that seems today to be the main focus among the the Pentecostal ranks um uh of this age that that's the main focus of of what what happened on on the day of Pentecost and it and it has become the criteria uh as to whether you have the Holy Ghost or not and that becomes the interpretation of what Pentecost is but that's the wrong interpretation because really the true interpretation of Pentecost is is about the life of God coming into an individual amen and quickening uh the word to them and and quickening them to the word of God see God came into that people to fulfill the word of God and to manifest himself amen we know that God is all powerful we know that God is all knowing we know that God is supreme and that God Reigns uh upon the throne and there's nothing that can hinder him there's there's nothing that can defeat him when that same God comes into a group of people amen he wants to manifest himself in that way Amen to the world to where that they don't live defeated and the Demons of hell can't conquer them but now he's in them people as the prophet said God determined that he would come into them people and he would defeat his enemy through them amen to show his power and his superiority and his his his holy nature ain't that right so God came into them a people that was helpless a people that could not do anything that that was subject to Satan and his powers now God would loose them by his blood and he would pour himself into them and began to fulfill his word and manifest himself now the prophet speaking of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost he the people there he said their mortal bodies were quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quickened their Spirits were Quicken their life was quickened they were quickened all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk anymore uh in any more human languages they were so quickened up in the presence of God till they spoke in a new tongue a Heavenly language amen that's in the rising of the Sun or the Easter seal in 65 amen but see Pentecost now seems to be a bad word uh uh with most people in the in the message ranks and and uh and and and I just have to say they just don't understand the importance of Pentecost it's as though they say God would just do away with that we're in a better age how can we become better in in this age when when whatever God does he he can't do anything greater he can't do anything of more importance if God saved you by Blood what makes you think that he can't save another one amen we then why do we still preach the blood amen some of you might have been born or say 50 years ago and you're still preaching the blood of Jesus Christ well I say we can still preach Pentecost amen because that's exactly what it is if God Saves you and fills you with the Holy Ghost it's what he done on Pentecost can you say amen amen that's right you'll never get brother brandham to change it you'll change it in your own mind and your own Theology and your own Doctrine but brother brandham never changed such a thing amen see now so so we find when I come into the Pentecost or to the message man Pentecost seemed to be kind of the the curse word of the day amen and uh don't mention Pentecost Don't Preach Pentecost don't all of these things but they just don't understand the importance of it the way brother brandham did brother brandham said we'll only find Christ when we go back to Pentecost he says in another place drop just drop everything and rush back to Pentecost and find the true and the Living God see get back to the gospel again back to the power of God get back to Pentecost like the original was see he says in the last age there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she'll listen to the spirit in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ can you say Amen see but Pentecost is not about speaking in tongues it's not about all of these things things uh we know that can happen but what the main focus of it is is the quickening power coming into a people amen an individual amen and quickening them to the word Jesus even said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you amen so we find today that even even Pentecost a man of today has has gotten cold and formed and until it's it's just become another word like Baptist or or Catholic or uh uh or what whatever the meaning of that word uh is lost to the people and they are left without the experience of Pentecost Amen brother Bram said if you say well I'm Pentecost that don't mean no more to God than if you said you was Roman Catholic or a Jew or whatever you might be see that it it's lost its meaning because if you see your Pentecost and you have have failed to receive the the the experience of Pentecost then the name has no meaning to us it's just like with the message you can say I message all you want but if the God of this message ain't living in you then then then then the message is just another name can you say amen that's right see well the the the Pentecostal age in this in age stands defeated as as Sams did no power to overcome no joy no uh uh uh no no Victory you you you understand I'm talking about the the Pentecostal age it acts like the world lives like the world dresses like the world thinks like the world Amen conducts everything like the world smells like the world so what what would we say about it is the age of Pentecost is a perverse age it it it's it's come to a perversion of what God had intended can you say amen amen see and so we we understand that perversion it it it is the result of Satan's power and and influence he he is the one in the beginning that perverted God's creation amen and and and but but how could he do that how could this power of perversion come in and affect all creation and and the prophet would use another word deform amen Satan was able to deform he he couldn't create he didn't have that power of creation but he was able to pervert uh perform and by that perversion he would be able to to exalt himself and and and as though he was God but how was he able to do that because he got Eve to let down the bars Amen brother Brandon uses that you know saying we've let down the bars we've let down the bars you know how how did the goats get in you know uh uh uh uh the Sheep got out the goats got in well how did they do that you let down the bars right and and so he was able to to to gain his influence over creation over man amen simply by Eve letting down the bars she let down the Bars by reasoning with God's word amen that's right see and so because she did that it opened the door to Satan's influence and and power to where he was able to deform or uh uh uh pervert uh man and creation brother brandham would say uh Satan and his angels was kicked out of heaven and then they come to the earth and the battle set in because Eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of God and from that hour think of that from that very hour Satan won the battle over God's word because one of his subjects the the weaker let down the bars he said and that's exactly how Satan's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word of God now church I I just believe that Satan will not amen be victorious over this bride Satan will not stop this Rapture from happening Satan will not stop this body change from happening can you say Amen Satan will not stop this Millennium from coming forward amen and coming on and and the kingdom of God being set up which tells us that there's a people that will not let down the bar of God's word I would rather be isolated amen with God's word than I would to be joined with anything in this world let me be isolated to God's word because if you're isolated amen behind God's word it breaks the power of Satan I don't care if it's sickness I don't care if it's discouragement I don't care if it's mental uh mental mind battles or whatever if you stay with that word it cannot it cannot amen uh uh defeat or Satan cannot win the battle amen but he wins the battle every time the subject of God Amen uh let's down the word of God can you say amen amen that's why you need to believe the word over uh uh over the doctor's words you need to believe the word over your situation amen you need to believe the word of God Amen you say well I just don't feel good believe the word of God Amen well they say I ain't going to make it believe the word of God Amen well Satan says that I'll never amen make it in a Rapture I don't feel worthy believe the word of God I don't care if you feel worthy or not you've got to believe the word you got to believe it do you believe that y so you know brother brandom even says this Believers will sometimes let down the bars to unbelief amen now he's speaking to us even Believers will sometimes let down the bars to unbelief and then then Satan will come in a whirlwind and causes fusses and stews and arguments and everything he said that is the devil getting among people well how did he get among the people if somebody let down the bar somebody let down in their faith with God can you say Amen oh God help us to hold that that that that banner up and that that bar up you see the church is supposed to be in a prominent position uh um in the world it it's to have that Pro uh prominent position in the world it's uh it's supposed to um uh be the framework as the prophet said that holds the the world together is the church and and and he says it knits what we call the morals and things of the world it's the church see the church the church has an important it's brother Bram typed the the church as the moon amen and you know the Moon it controls things upon the Earth it it keeps the Earth from being flooded it it there's a lot of things that the moon affects the the the Earth and and the changes of the Moon and all these things and and it can so silently but it'll it'll affect nature of man it affects the nature of animals it affect all of these things see and and so the church is likened to that that that it it when it's in its place it it affects it affects it it holds things together amen but notice what the prophet says but the church has become polluted perverted amen and therefore it has caused the world to become perverse amen see so so we don't lay the blame on politics we laid the blame on the church just like brother brandham did Brother brandom put the blame upon the church the world is the way it is because of the church home life is the way it is because of the church can you say Amen the schools are the way it is because of the church amen uh uh Russia is a communist today because of the church amen the church let down the bars ain't that right see and so any time that Israel in the Old Testament any time that Israel as a nation forsook the word of God Amen then they they went into captivity into the land of idolatry ain't that right so so on the day of Pentecost now there was one church every say one church amen that one church was started or planted by God and it was God's church amen at that time there was only one Faith one Doctrine one Lord uh uh one church and it was a Pentecostal Church Amen brother brandom says now as the first Adam was given a a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undivided undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time and we can look at that in the days of Acts and what what uh transpired and and the things that they done it was a mighty Church ain't that right but as Eve was tempted by Satan amen so was the church tempted and seduced amen and and the prophet said if become contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit amen so just as as uh Satan was able to gain a a foothold in in the beginning because Eve let down the bar so did this Antichrist spirit amen gain entrance into the church because the church began to let down the bar amen John wrote about it in in his first epistle uh 1 John 4:3 he uh breaking in this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it work or is it in the world see this wasn't too long after Pentecost amen you also look look at Acts 20 and 28 uh Paul would say take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which hath he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things Twisted things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears so so Paul saw this coming he he saw this starting to rise up in the church amen and and because he saw it and and no doubt he saw the devastation that it would do he he would weep and and he would travail for the people amen because he saw the enemy coming in uh the book of Jude uh it was written uh uh in the year of uh around the year of 66 ad which would have been uh around the prophet said was around uh 33 and 1/2 years after uh uh the Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost so 33 and A2 years that's not just too far away from the that that time and but notice what he writes Jude uh in the third verse and fourth he said beloved when I gave all diligence to you to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith now he's telling the people earnestly contend for this see which was once delivered amen unto the Saints so it it it then it it was showing that they were starting to slip away amen earnestly content and he this is 33 and A2 years after Pentecost and he's already warning the church contend for that faith that was once delivered for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into last seious and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now the day of Pentecost it started in uh ad33 the first church age started in a. 53 so that means it was 20 years after Pentecost around that time notice what God would say to this church of the the first church uh age uh uh there in Revelations 2 and one unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canest not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars so this is already springing up in the church and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake H has labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee thou because thou Hast left thy First Love ain't that right so here at the church in the first Church age 20 years or so after Pentecost the the church had already been identified by God as a fallen woman uh not too long after Pentecost see so just as Satan was able to get to Eve before Adam uh uh so Satan seduced the church amen uh the bride of Christ before the marriage supper of the lamb and and so this word Ephesus the prophet says has a compound meaning it's it means aimed at or or relaxed uh they're uh aimed at and relaxed and he says the the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God on the day of Pentecost whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God is that not what Paul said I press toward the mark of of the the prize of the High Calling of God Amen that was their ambition was the high calling of God Amen see and and and he says now it began to give way to a less watchful attitude amen just the attitude was less watchful it it began to be relaxed a less Ardent following of Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of Satan it had become relaxed and was drifting so we could see in that age uh the first age that the church began to let down the bars amen and and therefore brother Brandon says the tiny seed planted in that Ephesian age would one day grow in the spirit of of error until all foul birds of the air would Roost in its branches so then Satan uh God planted his seed on the day of Pentecost afterward Satan was able to plant his little tiny seed Amen in in there and and of course this for was foretold of Jesus there in Matthew uh 13:24 where he says the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a man with so good seed in his field but while men slipped his enemy came and so tears among the wheat and went his way but then but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit and appeared the tears also or then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou sow good seed in thy field uh from whence then ha it tears you know where did it come from and he says an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up and he said nay no see lest while you gather up the tears ye root up also the wheat with them but let them grow together until the Harvest this age right let him grow up and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears bind them up in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now just reading a lot of quotes here and and but brother Brandon would tell us so in offensive so inoffensive to human re reasoning would that little plant appear that uh uh to that new EVE the new church that again she would be deceived by Satan so in offensive to human reasoning it's just a little bit here just little drop here it That's what Satan does Amen so many times amen he plants things that looks good it looks justifiable but if it's against God's word it's not of God it's a little seed that wants to plant in our in our hearts ain't that right amen see and so the church was deceived Again by uh deceived by Satan amen and so the Ephesian age he said had presented to her the opportunity uh uh for God's best amen she was presented God's best amen she had that opportunity to uh uh uh to be amen uh uh you know God's best for her and and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed everybody say she relaxed then relaxed amen see and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the SE seed of complete ruination think of that notice the power of the seed that he plants amen is is the seed of complete ruination so a Satan was able to get his foot in in the door in the church and bring about a perversion not only in in in the first church age but notice how it continued in all Seven Ages ain't that right now this is why we look at Roman or Revelation 61 and it was important for us that the seals would be open amen so that we would know what Satan had been doing amen see and and because you cannot overcome you know uh you well brother Brown how do you say it to overcome you got to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and and we're living in the most deceptive age ever amen because that seed that he planted has grown up into maturity to where he looks exactly so close that it would deceive the very elect but thank God the seals were open amen uh uh for that elect but here Revelation 61 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that said on him had a bow now I'm doing this for maybe some that don't understand the why we believe things uh but I I saw an a White Horse He that sat on him had a bowl and had a crown uh was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him uh uh that set upon that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third be say come and see and I beheld and L a black horse and he that set upon him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine see and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them uh over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth amen so we look at this of course East represents power ain't that right so there was a power amen that was writing amen and and and we know now that this was a satanic power amen and a a perverse power ain't that right it had the power to pervert to deform to kill uh uh to destroy not only physically but spiritually ain't that right amen now as we know uh uh brother Bram said you know and and you could study it a lot of a lot of commentaries a lot of theologians and things uh down Through the Ages has always attributed that white horse to be Christ amen for only he could be a white white represent you know righteousness and all of these things and so and even brother brandham thought that that that was Christ all right but when the lamb come and open the seals then brother brandham received a revelation hold it this ain't Christ this is the Antichrist the de receiving and acting as though he is righteous he it's a religious spirit can you say amen amen see and so and and and notice it's not four different writers but the prophet told us it's the same writer changing masks amen he's changing himself amen see and so this writer writes through all seven Church ages and his influence affects the whole Earth ain't that right it affects the whole earth and all the peoples of the Earth or I would say the peoples of the earth it does not affect the bride does not affect the righteous can you say Amen the elect and and so or or it well you understand uh uh it didn't deceive the elect let's put it that way of course it it it they were affected in in one sense of the word amen but you know so so we find that this was the Antichrist he had gained a hold in the church because the church let down the bars the church got relaxed the church amen see and he was able to come in and began his Ride Through the Ages that of that Gentile dispensation now brother bradam says the very religion of Ephesus types out perfectly this first church age and sets the tener see it'ss the foundation or establishes a way of the ages to come see in the first place the Magnificent Temple of Diana which was in Ephesus see uh uh that was so many years in building and housed in its sacred courts the most lustrous and unobstrusive image of Diana that one could imagine she was absolutely unlike any other of her images seated in the other temples dedicated to her see she was simply an almost shapeless female figure that finally sunk into the block of wood from which she was carved I wish I had a picture to uh to show you uh there maybe we can uh find one uh next time but but uh so so she was a shapeless uh this this Idol was a shapeless Fem fale figure that sunk into a a a a uh the block of wood from which she was carved and her two arms were formed of two simple iron bars so that was her arms was iron bars he says now how perfectly this depicts the spirit of antichrist now this was the god of the Ephesus amen and and you know this is why brother uh uh uh Jesus would type uh uh the the first church age the Ephesus Church age see and so uh uh he said this depicts the spirit of antichrist loosed in the first age there he was loosed in the midst of the people and yet took no shape as to alarm the people see he just entered more as a spirit of anti yet the two arms of iron bar bars showed that it was his intent to crush the work of God as he made his inroads ain't that right so Satan's agenda is always to attempt his agenda is to crush the work of God do you believe that I I'll say it to you in a in maybe a personal thing way uh uh for us uh individually is anytime that you're fighting in your mind or you're going through trials or you're going through whatever and and you're feeling something but always judge that Spirit judge it whether it's trying to uh uh bring in a bitter bitterness in your soul whether it's trying to make you feel Unworthy of the Gospel whether it's what you know trying to bring unbelief or whatever it is Judge the spirit before you justify the spirit and allow it to take over then judge the spirit cuz you remember if it's it's the devil which we know that these things are anything that is contrary to the word of God is of the devil remember he's got an intent to crush that work of God in your life amen that's right can you say Amen how many preachers have given up because of discouragement true brother no longer preaching the gospel how many people no longer just believe anymore into this message simply because of this discouragement not not in the fact that they believe brother Brandon was a lie and all they just get discouragement they either got hurt or they done this or or or just something in their own life that they just give up amen see so so Satan wants to destroy and crush the work of God well that's what he has sought to do in in the ages to come see and he got his foothold in that first church age so we we find that he said now in the first church age no one seemed to notice him or what he was doing but one day they would notice when when with those arms of iron his deeds became Doctrine and his Doctrine became the law of an Empire can you say Amen see so then then we find now the church ages uh in the study of the church ages brother Bram dun it uh it deals with the history of the church but but when we speak of the church we're not re referring to only the pure bride of Jesus Christ or the pure elect amen see but the word church is referring to the entire body of people who called themselves Christian whether they be true or just merely nominal can you say Amen so the prophet said as all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians not everyone that nameth the name of the Lord is true uh uh true Christian can you say Amen so then we find that because Satan was able to get his foothold in the door we see and and plant that little seed amen his his seed then we see that two Vines begin to to to uh spring up down through the ageny the church then is made up of two Vines the church can you say Amen so when we say Church we're not just speaking of one body one group Church rep represents that there uh of of everyone that is calling themselves Christians whether they be true or false church can you say Amen see so the church is made up of two Vines the true and false and these two Vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits two different kinds see one one Vine one church or one group has the holy spirit amen which is the spirit of life that's what started on the day of Pentecost the other Vine amen that false Vine is is uh indued with the spirit of antichrist or the spirit of perverseness can you say Amen now notice both claim to know and be known of God both speak uh claim to speak for God both believe certain basic truths and differ on others both bear the name of the Lord being called Christians therefore both claim a relationship to him can you say Amen see and so therefore the prophet said because of this they're they're both uh uh uh uh claiming relationship to him when they say well I'm a Christian I'm see when you say I'm Christian and and everyone else I'm Christian I'm Christian they're claiming relationship to God they're not as though the a as the atheists out there that is saying there is no God they're actually claiming relationship to God and they're claiming to speak for God and because of this God calls it a marriage and now holds them both responsible to him and speaks to each throughout the church ages can you say Amen now notice uh through the Revelation that God has given to us in this day then we know that the Holy Spirit can fall upon the unregenerated false Vine Christians and manifest powerfully the prophet said in various signs and wonders even as Judas had a definite Ministry in the Holy Ghost though he himself was pronounced to be a devil ain't that right now this has happened and it continues to happen see both finds the Holy Ghost falling upon not only the true but also the The Falls but remember there's two different seeds one was planted by God and the other was planted by the Antichrist one has the life of God flowing through it and is vibrant quickened to the word and the other one amen has has uh uh uh uh been endued by the spirit of perversion that Antichrist Spirit can you say amen and and so then Jesus would tell us that these two Vines are to grow these the wheat and The Tear is to grow together remember they were planted in the same field Jesus said the Earth is the field this world is the field ain't that right amen and they're planted in the same field and they grow up together and both we can truly say now both have come to maturity both vins the false the true has come to maturity and are getting prepared for Harvest now we're we're living in the time of separation of these two Vines you know brother brandham was writing with an elderly couple to go pray for a child that was sick and when they got to the child the family didn't want him to pray they turned him away said no can you imagine afterwards the lady mentioned that the elderly lady said to brother brand she says you know I I think what ought to take place is that all the church churches ought to come together and be one all the churches and that's a nice idea all the churches come together and and they be one see and now notice what brother brandham says about that statement he said and that's exactly what the devil thinks but God wants a separation of his church from the things of the world he does not want it mixed up in church politics see so he says the lady was only thinking the thoughts of the whole world that's what the whole world world is is wanting that's the the church world everybody is wanting to come together for the most part is pushing for a a togetherness the church is p pushing for a togetherness ain't that right but see so he says see that's exactly what the devil thinks he said but God wants a separation of his church from the things of the world and and so uh uh everybody wants a messiah to bring everything together and this the prophet said is the reason or the purpose for the World Council of churches existing is to bring everything together now Church the count World Council of churches exists today how many believes that it's it's here and she's getting ready to take front and center stage yes sir I believe that with all my heart that's how close we're living in and and you say well how how do you do that how do you know this is is because we are living in the age of maturity where the True Vine is maturity as and coming into what God has has has desired it to be as manifestation of sons of God can you say Amen we're in the age of adoption we're saying we're in the age of adoption why because only a matured son can come into this adoption if the church is is coming in the true church then you know the false Vine is too so therefore now no notice brother brand would tell us it is in this age that the churches are going to come together and now notice and as they are even now everybody say they are even now they're right now controlling World politics right now you may not understand all that I don't I'm I don't know how all this stuff is working but you can be assured that a prophet says it I believe it they are controlling World politics he said see the churches are come going to come together and as they are even now controlling World politics they will soon control the finances of the world that's right then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or sell see you will lose all those who stay stay true to God and keep their garments clean and the defilement of this world system of church orders or keep keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be pH physically bereft see there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the of the Antichrist be system see they won't even know that it's the an Antichrist see they'll just see it as a better way to serve God and they will give in to the flatteries flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false Shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment they will all be found naked they will all they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk with in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it's time to wake up and hear the voice of God crying come out of her see what is that organized religion come out of that my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues amen God is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague leaving leave off walking with the world and make your garments WIP by repentance and the blood of the lamb and you say Amen see so there is an overcomer now Paul being that angel Messenger to the first church age he said this in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work so it was already working in Paul's day and and this is what he was trying to say these Grievous wolves that's the that's what was working the spirit of iniquity the mystery of iniquity does already work see and the prophet said this mystery of iniquity was Antichrist in his teaching because it was against Christ the word ain't that right so see and and and so then God rebukes the age that church age that first church age because it had left its first love again brother brandom uses another meaning for Ephesus which means let go relax backsliding see so this word I looked it up relax means to make less tense or rigid see we don't in this age here we're in the most uh age of people's rights and things that we want everything quick we do not want tension we we we want things easy we want life easy we we don't want struggles we you you understand well this is what was in that first church age in in just a little seed was that it let go it was relaxed it backslidden and so it it it in other words it it was less tense rigid it was slack slacking see to make less severe or stringent modified to become LAX weak or loose to rest and this is how the nianis took hold of the church ain't that right so the church became relaxed and backslid and entertain this idea of nianis now most of us know what that is and and we could get into do it later on but it allowed the spirit of antichrist to gain access and pervert what God had intended for the church now notice within three years of of the Christian Church of uh the Christians being scattered abroad the gospel had been taken uh to Rome by by two men and these men are named uh uh their men in Romans 16:7 and they were called Apostles and and so they started this church in Rome and for several years the work of God began to flourish and and uh and and and and these things and uh brother Bram says until the constant altercations of the Jews amongst themselves caus the imperior of that day to expel them from Rome so the the the the leaders of that church amen got to fighting amongst one another or whatever and and finally the imperior of Rome banished them from Rome and and so brother Bram said with that the Jews Elders being taken out banished then it it the backbone of that little church was practically broken see and this is exactly what Satan wanted to do uh uh and and therefore brother BR said the elders perhaps Jew je uh and and so would be gone as well and and so he says this left the little flock unintended and the word of God had not been written as a guide so therefore it it was very easy for the group to drift or inundated by the philosophers and pagans of that day that they had no leadership in the church they had no written word in among them so therefore that little group that little flock was was just sitting there like a little sheep you know left to the wolves and and they they were easily persuaded easily affected uh by these things and so brother Bram would tell us with Grievious wolves on the prow and the spirit of antichrist released into the church the age we find from history that this little church in Rome became hopelessly backslidden and began to introduce Pagan ceremonies under Christian titles now Church uh I I know this is church history and I I think it's important or brother Brandon wouldn't have gone through all of this uh uh with us but I I think that that we must not just let it be history amen but that same spirit that began to work on that church Works upon us the moment you isolate yourself from the body of Believers you you're leaving yourself vulnerable to Satan amen true that's why brother Bram says you know people say well you know I can stay home from church and and and and be the same he said no you can't you just can't you you're you're you're like that that little that little uh deer or whatever that gets away from the herd and and and then the enemy isolates you from that herd because you're now showing a weakness in you exactly can you say Amen well it's true and and we're finding more message more message people not believing seeing the importance of being with the body they want to be their own self they want to be their own way they every you know what I'll set it this way you're always going to find you you're always when you're when you're among Believers when you're among people period you're going to see the weak hinder parts of people hello and this is where you got to put up with people this is where the Bible says you've got to bear with one another's burdens you understand what I'm saying we ought to be thankful for one another I'm not saying you aren't but I am saying we ought to be thankful be more thankful for one another if you see someone weak you be there don't isolate them be there with them that's right help them you understand what I'm saying see so so we're we're not chickens that look at this sore spot on the other chicken and then we start pecking that chicken that's good brother you understand what I'm saying so so there there's a reason that God puts us with a body a body of Believers and and and you know good and well it's just like brother brandom says you know talking about the church there where he was at and in Jeffersonville and he said this is such a sweet church now you know and and love and da D D D D he says let me warn you right now Satan ain't going to let it stay that way ain't going to let it stay that way why because if he can ever get a foot in the door he's going to bring division he's going to bring uh all kinds of things amen and and and he says what it'll do he says if he can't get someone in the church he'll bring somebody in the church he'll bring them in Let Them Sit amongst you get acquainted with you you become friends you you start just whining in a dining you start you know become a buddy and then all of a sudden he shoots that guy with poison and before you know it he's gained influence in the church hello and maybe he start speaking against the pastor or he start speaking against the songl well I don't like the way they lead them songs and I don't like the way that they play that musician and or the the music or I don't I don't just like the way the pastor does this or I don't like the way they do this and all that and what it's doing he's starting something he's trying that's exactly what happened in the first church age and you had a people that got relaxed can you sayen so you you find these things and and so this is why I encourage you when when when you when you do you know when when you find an issue in the church just pray about it when someone starts bringing up issues to you about the church don't you give in to that and usually they always find the weaker one that is willing and maybe they not intentionally do that but the spirit that's on them we will will usually know who the weak one is in the church I remember they always tried to come to Dad Dad was the associate and they always you know different ones would try to come to Dad at the beginning and start talking about brother bur well brother bur you know oh we love him oh he's just a good guy but he just he you know and and and dad says well you know what I'm just you know I'm I'm I'm not I'm not siding with you at all he said you know uh God sent brother burst there and I'm just going to stand behind him that's just the way it is you know and you know and so one family you know they they had been you know giving dad this and giving Mom this and just kind of giving them a little gifts and stuff like that and you know and and and and and taking them out to eat and doing all kinds of stuff and and uh just kind of getting a little close to them and you know and and then all of a sudden they they come just running to the house you know uh banging on the door and they're just AB balling and squalling and and so Dad says what in the world's wrong and oh you know so you we got to talk to you you know so they begin to talk to him about brother burst you know brother burst this and brother burst done this and brother burst done that and and all that and dad says well I tell you what have you ever talked to him about it oh no no we ain't doing that he said well I tell you what let's get in my car and we'll all go over oh no we ain't doing that at all he said oh yes we are going to go do that he said I'll either ride with you or you ride with me but we're going to get this straightened out right now you know and and oh no we ain't doing that he said yes you are you're getting in that car we're all going so he got them in the car they all got over there and and and you know Dad says now brother bur you know says uh uh there there's some complaint here and I think we need to get this worked out you know well oh you know so he says now now tell them tell brother bur what you told me oh well you know it we probably OV exaggerated a little bit and you know and uh you know well they were ready to go they were in a hurry but see what it was is Dad wouldn't give that that Spirit a foothold in his home in his life and I thank God for that you understand what I'm saying and and so uh everybody's willing to to uh to lend an ear amen but see if you're not careful it's Satan trying to work in Amen to destroy a church well he'll do it with your home he'll do it between you and your spouse he'll do it he'll cause uh uh maybe the children to think uh something different and and uh uh uh from their parents and all of a sudden something starts rising up against their parent well what it is it's just a stinking Old Devil trying to break everything up well that Spirit started here and if you ain't got strong ones and strong elders and and to say no we're not going this way we're going to serve the Lord we're going to pray about these things but here they didn't have the elders because Satan made a way for them to cast them away from the church get him away to where now there's a little flock that is just left vulnerable to his devices and so we find that that he says brother Brown says with Grievous wolves on the prow and the spirit of antichrist released we find from history that this little church in Rome became hopelessly backslid and began to introduce Pagan ceremonies under Christian titles it was a period of 13 years in this finally 13 years later that uh uh the Jews were allowed to go back to the city of Rome and the two Apostles that started the church went back in in to see how the church was doing the little flock and all these and and and what they found what they discovered was this church was woefully Pagan and yet had Christian title brother Braham says there were altars in the church upon which they placed incense and celebrated Pagan rights the established leaders of that church could not be approached so with the few who had tried to remain faithful they started a new church or the second Church of Rome and God graciously worked amongst them by signs and wonders so that a third church was started and though the first church was reproached for being Pagan and not Christian in its worship it would not give up its title and remained and Still Remains The First Church of Rome think about ain't that right so so then we we find and I'm just giving history uh here the the first church had began to thrive and multiply so in numbers that the imperial and the various officials of the government actually favored favored that church for political reasons kind of like it is today so when the leaders of this church found themselves in in favor of of the political world then they took opportunity to turn the government against the True Believers hello and they demanded their persecution of the Believers True Believers unless they came into their fold so now it become a force of re of religion so there therefore when polycarp heard about what happened to the first church of of Rome uh and and that they were involved in Pagan ceremonies and had corrupted the truth of the Gospel then he went in there to to implore them to to try to persuade them to change back and and when he got there he saw them prostrate uh themselves before images named after the apostles and Saints and he saw them like candles and burnt incense on the he saw them celebrate the Passover under the name of Easter where they elevated the dis shaped bread that honored the son God and then they poured out the wine out as a uh Li libation uh to the gods so then polycarp couldn't persuade them of their ways and history says that as he was leaving the Lord spoke through him saying Ephraim is married to his idols let him alone and polycarp never returned to that first church so so then we find the history of a church being started by the Antichrist Spirit how it become perverted and through that perversion and and I know we've we've we were we're uh uh winding up in time here but through this perversion amen uh uh this church has become larger and larger and we find that in the third thir Church age that church became married to State and and uh uh the church and state become married religious powers and state Powers Government powers became one became United and that was the the finally where the first the Catholic church was born but it all come through perversion and we'll we'll find out as we go that that you you'll find where these denominations and why we we we talk against not not people in the denominations but we talk about that organization of of what they are can you say amen and and so but in every age you you'll find that the the True Believers have withstood this and and and even when it come into I think it was the Dark Age brother brandham said there was less Christianity of the True Believer than even today he said it it it had come to such a few number of Christians because that Antichrist Spirit set War upon the True Believers now church that Antichrist Spirit it set War to the Believers it determined uh uh to toward the the Believers and and it become a physical thing to where it entered into the Dark Ages and how how many 66 million 68 million True Believers were slaughtered by an antichrist spirit that began to work in the first church age now we're looking and we've come brother brand said now we've had greater greater times of persecution like the dark ages and all that but never a time of great deception like we are in this age can you say amen amen how did the how did the the Believers in the age ages overcome because in every age there's been an overcomer is they stayed with what they knew amen and the spirit of God as as we know as as as Satan rode so did the spirit of God rise Amen to combat that Spirit can you say Amen now church that's the only way we're going to overcome in this age is stay with the word of God stay with the word of God now if they could overcome with just a little light just a little bit in their their age how much more can we overcome with the revealed word of God don't take this message for granted it's your Lifeline it's your Source can you say amen I have told you and and I'm I'm to close and we'll we'll we'll continue on another time uh but but I have told you you know uh and we were talking about last night but you know in my mind you know uh uh I you know you you want because we talk about adoption how the son comes into that adoption and and there's a time that he does that and you know in my mind I've wondered well when does that come and I've actually had people ask me well when when do we come to this adoption when do we know well you know and and and so you know there was a little just a bit I I didn't know what to say but but one day it just come to me don't worry about all that that's right just simply believe the word just simply live by this word simply so believe it till you speak the word no matter what situation you're in don't confess what a doctor says confess what the word says don't confess what everybody is saying say what the word word says can you say Amen don't take the thought of the world take the thought of God and overcome by it can you say Amen do you love the Lord amen if the musicians will come I love the Lord so we find that we're we're we're living in an age of perversion it's a perverse age and we see how it began to start in in that church age all the way down to where it is growing to where everything that we that the church once stood for is so perverse can you say Amen to where even that it would even get us if Satan could to start getting us to question the message as to what brother bradam said about things well did he really mean it well that was just because he was living in that time but see it's the spirit of perversion that has swayed the whole world to turn to something that a prophet told us not to do you understand what I'm saying if you stand with this message you don't have to worry about going chaotic because God would never leave you lead you to go somewhere way off the beaten path as long as you stay with the word now you'll be be you'll be off the beaten path with the world it'll make you different it'll it'll it they'll think you're crazy but isn't every person that's walked with God considered crazy not that we tried to act crazy not that we tried to to to be some odd individual it's just simply when you believe the word of God see you're standing you're standing in the midst of a perverse generation a perverse Nation a perverse world can you say Amen now stand holding the word of Truth aren't you glad for truth oh my I I I remember I remember you know being in the Pentecostal in that time of the Pentecostal and that's what we grew up in and there are so many things questions that I had personally you know that I didn't know I I just didn't understand things I you know I was telling my wife you know yesterday just of how that you know I remember you know just some brother Greg fry had come to me uh we were standing outside of her home and he was there visiting me he said brother Sean can you explain [Music] predestination I said no I I can't I was a young young man I don't know how old 20 I said I'm sorry I can't I felt so ashamed that I could not explain predestination because we didn't [Music] know and you know you just had questions like that of what what's right you you just saw a lot of things in the Pentecostal things that took place and you just wondered what what's right what's true what's and left you mixed up I remember when I come into this message I you know as I was reliving it yesterday I just that burning in my soul again I you know I I don't know how we started getting tapes but we didn't have computer for Terry you remember in times I'm sure all of y'all do most of you we didn't have computers we didn't have cell phones that had the app table apps we didn't have nothing I don't even know how I got the address to voice of God but I remember sending a letter to them or calling them and asking you know to get on their mailing list and I remember the first box of tapes I got 15 tapes they would give you and and you'd listen to them pay them off and then they'd send you another 15 man we were [Music] excited I just I was so excited I couldn't wait man when we ordered them tapes I just couldn't wait for them to come to the mail you know man we'd sit and listened to them here what a prophet had say didn't understand most of what he was saying but I was excited something just happened I knew it was right so I remember you know uh listen I think it was lifting God out of history and I'd went to back to visit our former church I was in py with Wendell at the time but they had a a meeting or something so we had went and uh just a a a man you know that that I knew when I was growing up we just got to talking I said man brother Joel I said have you ever listened to brother Brandon no oh you got to listen to him I said I've just been listening to this you know God lifting God out of history and I was trying to explain to him I still didn't understand and you know he was happy cuz I was happy but I don't think I was getting it clicking to him what I was really trying to get to but I just knew that this message was right then my pastor you know he come to me one time says what do you get out of this message what has this message done for you I said oh man brother bur you just don't know what it's done for me it has liberated me I am free I said this is so right so Vindicated oh you know but for me it become my lifeline tell my wife yesterday I I believe I'm more sold on this message than I was back then Lord I've got a better understanding of it but I am more sold on this thing because that's the only way we will overcome we've got all kinds of spirits that are trying to bring a perversion whether it's doctrines that's coming in the message or whether it's the world out there trying to pervert our minds and get us all twisted up in all kinds of ways but Church stay with the word of God stand in this perverse generation can you say Amen you love him amen
