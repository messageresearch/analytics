lives of the Believers aren't you thankful for that today amen God bless you this morning the musicians can be dismissed we want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we sure sure count it

the book of St John the 20th chapter and we want to this morning of course remember the Walker family and uh pray the Lord just Comfort them and amen I'm looking forward to that grand reunion day amen when all the saints are going together over there and we'll be changed Amen in the book of St John the 20th chapter and the 18th verse amen just before we read the word let's just bow our hearts together and ask the Lord to come by our way this morning Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Resurrection Sunday father we've not gathered here to be seen or to be heard but Lord we've gathered here to worship you and to lift up the name that is above every name for Lord we know that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess and father we know the world hates that name the world despises that name father they've done everything they can to bind that name but Lord here's a group of people that you've called for that name and Lord I believe there's power in that name this morning that when we speak the name of Jesus Lord as I was just hearing your Prophet say last night breathe that holy name in prayer Lord just a breath of that name can change the situation and oh God I'm asking you this morning to send your grace in this meeting father may you bind the hand of Satan may you bring healing to the sick bodies Lord those that are not able to be here homesick may you bring healing to their bodies oh God Lord I pray you would just bring Lord guidance and direction to us as we look into your word and father I pray for those traveling may you keep your hand upon them Lord those that are on their way and unable to Lord get through traffic or whatever the situation may be I pray oh God you would bless him Lord and father whatever you have on your heart for us this morning we'll be sure to receive it in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen the Book of John the 20th chapter and in the 18th verse of John 20 the Bible says Mary magdalina came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoke these things unto her then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst amen I I love that Jesus came and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you amen when he had so said he showed unto his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had I want you to catch this and when he said this he breathed on them when he had said this he breath breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now watch the next verse right after he says this he speaks of authority and says whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained amen we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning amen we we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God amen amen I want to by the help help of the Lord for just a few moments this morning to speak to here and if I would title this today I want to speak to you on freshly inspired by the Breath of God Amen freshly inspired by the Breath of God now I'm actually drawing this thought from a quote in 1956 brother B preaching on speaking or speaking here on hear ye him from Matthew 17 where Jesus was there on Mount Transfiguration and in the in paragraph 10 he said you know God's word is so Eternal it's so inspired that it's not just for one occasion or for one generation amen but the word of God Is So Eternal it's the same and the truth amen the word of God is eternal the word of God is the same and the word of God is the truth he said this same word inspired the disciples it inspired the first row of disciples and then the next is they followed down to the Lutheran age through the Methodist age in every age and it is just as sufficient and inspiring today Amen to us as it was the first day it was given see and if the world would stand a million years that word would still be just as inspired to the generations that will follow us as it is to us because it is perfect it's always amen given for the time he said one great way we could approach it this afternoon is the coming of the Lord see first is Moses amen then Elijah and then Jesus then we notice that Peter while he was there brother B said Peter had just been freshly inspired he said because he had just give a witness to who Jesus was amen and he was inspired now when a man and this what I want to focus on when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word then the two Inspirations gives a result no matter how well that you study the word it'll never do you no good until you're inspired yourself it takes your inspiration amen the word is already inspired amen so amen we're not here to inspire the word amen but the word is already inspired amen so what we're doing is letting the inspired word inspire our heart amen and that's what brings the results he said so what we need today amen is an inspiration over us amen God sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us and awaken us to his word and then the word being brought in the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen amen and things take place because the two amen just comes together so when the inspired word amen connects with the inspired believer amen and the two come together amen then watch that's where the miracle happens amen that's where things take place now in job 32:8 one of my favorite scriptures the Bible said amen that there is a spirit in man amen and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding now when you look at that word INSP spiration it means breath it means spirit amen it is the Breath of God or the breath of man amen every breathing thing the spirit of man now amen so there job says it's the inspiration of the almighty that giveth him understanding in other words what we could say Amen it it is the breath of the almighty amen that breathes over the believer and that breath is what inspires them amen and gives them understanding about the word in the age they're living in brother said God keeps his word he said oh God who formed the Heaven and the Earth just let his breath go forth with his word and everything Tak in its right position amen the Earth the moon the stars amen all swung into place just as God Amen breathed on his word and oh God today we ask amen that you'll breathe on your word as we are trying Amen to bring it to the people may it take its position this morning amen its place and be rooted and grounded in every heart amen that every person might receive your blessings amen when you see the mountains out there amen the Breath of God put him in their position when you see the stars the Breath of God put him in the sky amen when you see the Sun and you see the trees amen it was the Breath of God that breathed over the creation amen and brought it into its position listen church amen if the Breath of God can hang the moon and the Breath of God can place the mountains amen I believe that same breath amen can come in the Church of the Living God amen and can breathe over every believer amen and it'll be a press breath amen it'll be an inspiring breath amen I say oh God this morning breathe on us once again amen breathe on us with your love amen breathe on us with your provision breathe on us with your anointing breathe on us with Revelation breathe on us with power amen I believe if the Breath of God begins to blow in the Church of God Amen there'll be a Revival breakout in every heart there will be a dance breakout in the church there'll be a shout come out of the heart of every believer because the Breath of God Amen is inspiring the Church of God Amen I I tell you what the devil's tried to do he's tried to blow his poisonous breath long enough amen but I tell you what it's going to take to counteract amen the devil's poisonous breath amen is a fresh breath of the Holy Ghost amen and when he breathed upon him he didn't say receive your problems he didn't say receive your situation he said receive ye the Holy Ghost and you all know that the the Holy Ghost is the only thing amen that can fix a situation it's the only thing that can bring a Deliverance it's the only thing that'll be the lifter up of your head oh hallelujah amen sometimes we just got to look away to Jesus amen we got to look away from all the problems and all the situations amen and all the backb and gain saying and just look away to Jesus and let him be the lifter of our head amen I believe it I believe there's power Amen in the Breath of God Genesis 2:7 the Bible said that the Lord God formed man amen of the Dust of the ground amen and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life amen and Man became a living soul in Isaiah 42:5 the Bible said thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it amen he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and the spirit to them amen that walk therein oh Church the same breath amen that created the Earth you're walking on is the same breath that was breathed upon you amen that's in you listen friends we're not walking by our own breath we're not walking by our own spirit amen but the same breath that said let there be and let there be has now returned in the church in the form of the Holy Ghost amen and we're walking upon the created Earth amen but the breath we're living and breathing by is the created Breath of God Amen I tell you in in other words breath is a sign of life life amen if there is no breath amen there is no life call 911 amen and the first thing they're going to say is are they breathing amen amen because breath is a sign of life amen can I tell you what else breath is in the Bible it's connected to praise Amen in the Bible the word breath is connected to praise brother said look here in Psalms 150:6 he reads it let everything let everything that haveth breath amen praise the Lord amen and then he says it again praise ye the Lord let everything that has breath amen praise the Lord amen praise ye the Lord amen that word praise means to shine amen it is figurative of God's favor amen it is to flash forth light it is to praise it is to boast it is to be boastful it is to make a boast amen I like this one it is to make a fool of Amen to act madly to act like a madman amen so when you begin to praise amen sometimes you're going to boast amen and sometimes you're going to shine amen and sometimes amen you're going to make a fool of yourself and sometimes when you get done praising they're going to think you're a crazy man amen but let me say this at the end of the day the only thing I'm concerned about amen is is there some breath in the Church of the Living God Amen that no matter what we're going through no matter what we're facing amen there's a breath in our lungs Amen to say praise ye the Lord I might be broke but praise the Lord I might be sick but praise the Lord I might be depressed but praise the Lord I might be discouraged but praise the Lord I might be perplexed on every side amen but praise the Lord why do you say that amen because the god that's going to fix it is the god that's breathing in your lungs amen and the breath that you're giving praise with is the same breath that's going to blow on the face of the situation amen and things are going to change amen because he's the god of change he's the god hey if you begin to praise him he'll begin to blow if you begin to praise him he'll begin to fight back against those Devils because our God Amen is a god of battle he's a god of wh I say praise the Lord amen praise the Lord the Bible said let everything that has breath amen praise the Lord he said no I'm not emotionally but I am emotionally too he said anything without emotion is dead anything without emotion is dead I love this one ordination paragraph 98 he said do you imagine a man saying he loved his wife and he hadn't seen her for a long time amen and pass right by and say well I'll see her some other time amen see that isn't or the wife saying she loves her husband amen or the parents saying they love their child amen well it shows amen so love shows he said see in our think our Expressions that we should constantly long to be in worship amen we should constantly amen long to be in worship anywhere Amen to Worship the Lord when we come together to worship Him amen worship him at home worship him while you're driving your car wherever we are Worship the Lord amen just pray he said the Bible said let everything amen that hath breath praise the Lord and then he said praise ye the Lord now I I I just got to say this quote astounds me he said even if you haven't got any breath amen still praise the Lord amen praise everything that has breath praise the Lord amen and then praise ye the Lord amen you say brother Andrew how can I praise amen when I don't have the breath to praise well you got to remember that he is the breath and you got to remember that if you're there amen that he can breathe in you amen and he can give you the breath to praise in other words you just got to be willing to praise amen and God will supply the breath to do it amen you just got to be willing to worship amen and God will supply amen the breath to worship listen friends God is not looking for people that's got it all figured out amen he's just looking for somebody amen that is willing amen and ready to manifest him in the age that they're living in amen I tell you why we don't pray sometimes I tell you why we don't worship sometimes amen preachers included it's because we go through things we Face situation amen we Face obstacles the odds are against us amen but I love what the prophet said he said sometimes amen we just need a little fresh feeling amen sometimes we just need a little fresh feeling he said here not long ago brother Fred and I and brother Tom a bunch of us went to a noted Baptist Church in the City of Tucson he said to see if we couldn't find a little something amen that would give us maybe a little fresh feeling and the minister stood up and said amen the people in Egypt when they left eating Garlic and so forth amen they wanted to go back again and eat amen said that something like people today and he said we all said amen he said I never seen such a bunch amen the whole church lost sight of the preacher and look back to see who it was it said amen amen it like just scared them to death amen they didn't know what it was amen they didn't know why amen that there was somebody Amen in the church sister Becky amen and they were saying amen but I'll tell you why they were doing it it's because they were willing to say amen and so because they were willing to say amen amen God sent some breath in there Amen to say amen amen and to breathe an amen to his word he said Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord amen praise upon the harps praise him with the Sury let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord amen God rejoices in his people let them that have learned say amen amen when anything is said right amen I tell you what we need to do amen we need to let the Breath of God Amen blow in the church again amen and bring back our amens we need to let the Breath of God blow in the church again amen and bring back our hallelujah amen and bring back our glory to God Amen y'all remember what it used to be like amen when you couldn't wait to hear the word amen and all you could say was amen amen remember what it was like when a good point was made amen all you could do was say hallelujah amen but you know what happened amen somewhere amen we lost a fresh feeling of how good God has been to us amen somewhere we went through a trial we went through a battle come on church we went through a war amen but I say God is here this morning Amen in the restoring power of his resurrection and I believe he's here Amen to restore our amen I believe he's here to restore our Hallelujah I believe he's here to restore our thank you Jesus I believe he's here to restore our praise and restore our worship amen I think it's time to let the Breath of God Amen Breathe Again in the Church of God Amen because this is not the hybrid church this is the true church this is the true church and the prophet of God said the true church amen is the mystical Body of Christ and it is born of the Breath of God Amen the Church of the is the mystical Body of Christ and it is born of the Breath of God oh did you get it the congregation said amen the Church of God is born of the Breath of God Amen God breathed into the nostril spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul he said did you know the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal church is the born of the Breath of God did you know that they're the born of the Breath of God then he turns to John 20 and reads our opening text and said now watch the father that sent him went in him in other words he said and Jesus when he sends a disciple he goes in him can I ask you this amen how is he in you in the age you're living in well according to Isaiah amen the god that created the heavens and the Earth amen is the same God that breathed in those who are walking upon what he created in the age they're living then listen friends anden the church is born of the Breath of God when this stature has molded itself up there in condition amen then God's breath breathes upon them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born in the Church of the Living God Amen you are born by the Breath of God Amen God breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost amen receive ye the Holy Ghost oh my not come and join put your name on there with your soup suppers and all that goes with it you join a lodge you can join amen a Methodist Lodge you can join a Baptist Lodge or a presbyterian or Catholic Lodge or even a Pentecostal Lodge amen but when you become a child of God Amen you are born by the Breath of God Amen then what did the prophet of God say he said we are born by the word amen then brother shiah the word is the Breath of God can I say this to you amen God watches over his breath amen God watches over his word God don't waste his breath amen God watches over his word amen and God Reveals His word amen now watch this and what God has breathed upon his word amen when it becomes revealed it must have the preeminence amen can I say this to you amen then the word is the Breath of God right but the revealed word amen is the inspired Breath of God in the age we're living in brother said events made clear by prophecy he said we watch the Bible amen for God doesn't leave us in darkness he sent the Bible to forell us the events amen before they happen the very nature and time they would come he said now when you see the church get worldly like it was in the days of Sodom amen see the church world all going into the worship amen the God of this evil age and seeing that how many can agree that we see that amen we see the the we see the church World getting whirly and wicked and going in Amen to the worship of the God of this even age amen but at the same time we see that he said but then seeing a little minority group amen gathered out under the inspiration of God Amen producing again amen the word oh God producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen amen then you know what hour you're living in the Bible foretells by prophecy what day we're living and what time we're living and what kind of events ought to be taking place it foretells exactly to the letter and has never missed one age all the time not one time has it ever missed and it won't for who are predestinated to see it will see it amen for those who are predestinated to see it they will see it Jesus said no man amen can come to me except my Father which draws him and all the father has given me will come now watch a prophet it's the word joining the word it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else amen we know it the day we're living in amen so in this age the Breath of God Amen is joining with the Breath of God Amen the word of God is joining with the word of God I tell you what the devil wants us to do amen is the devil wants to put a thought in our mind amen that this word is not enough the devil wants to put a thought in our mind that we need something more than the word amen I'll say like a prophet said amen we are sufficiently impressed with the word and our midst amen I tell you what the devil was trying to do in John 20 he was trying to get them to believe something amen apart from the word amen but when Jesus come in the midst of them he stood right there in the midst of them the word appeared in their midst amen and said listen church amen receive ye the Holy Ghost and he breathed upon them amen now watch a prophet he said Jesus knew amen there was going to be a terrible draft amen away from the word in the pergan church amen which was yet 200 years old from the patmas vision so brother Mark we're not we're not a thousand years down the road amen we're just a a couple hundred years amen away from the patmas vision in the pergami and church age amen and they're already leaving the word he knew that drift would cause him to get in the Dark Ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God Amen was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left God if you leave that word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus amen and indeed to all churches of all ages and here's what he says I am the word if you want deity in your midst amen then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself amen I am the word remember that amen so Jesus is in the midst of the church and he's saying I am the word and if you want deity in your midst amen then don't welcome a feeling don't welcome a sensation amen don't welcome a gift that's unchecked by the word amen welcome the word in the church and when the word comes in the church there will be a power come behind that word and the prophet said I wonder amen if we are sufficiently impressed amen with the word in our midst amen Faith Tabernacle can I ask you amen are we sufficiently Inay bless with a word in our midst amen or is it just another sermon is it just another scripture is it just another quote is it just another service or is it just another meeting I say oh God Shake us from the pullit to the back door this morning and let us awaken our souls by the Breath of God to the inspired word of God Amen I tell you what's not Eternal is our feelings I tell you what not is true is our Sensations I'll tell you what is not perfect is our emotions amen but we have by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication and the word of God is perfect on our good days it's perfect on our bad days it's Eternal on our good days it's Eternal on our bad days and I say with everything within me I am sufficiently impressed with a revealed word of God in the age I'm living in if a prophet taught it I'm not ashamed of it now come on church and either we stand with a word or we stand with what what somebody thinks about it now I say this I am sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst have I got any other Witnesses you are sufficiently impressed that word impressed means sealed come on now and what did Jesus do he said receive ye the Holy Ghost brother said the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God he said now watch and that seal is not from meeting to meeting meeting he said but that seal is unto the day of your Redemption listen he did not say are we sufficiently impressed with Signs Now come on amen he said the word are we sufficiently sealed with the word now let me put this out there we believe in signs We Believe don't we do we do we believe in signs we believe in signs but can I tell you what signs can be impersonated come on now a devil can impersonate a time but a devil cannot impersonate the word now listen to what 2 Thessalonians 2:8 says when that shall then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth amen let me ask you this where does that breath come from it comes from your mouth amen shall re shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy amen with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and line wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them Shall Perish because they now watch they Reed not the love of the truth that they might be saved in other words the word is the truth so they did not receive a love for the word they were not sufficiently impressed with the word amen but listen friends we are lovers of the word amen we are lovers of Truth amen I say this the Bible speaks of signs in Exodus 7 the Bible speaks of signs and wonders amen that were done in the land of Egypt in Mark 16 Jesus said amen that signs shall follow them that believe amen can I preach you for a second amen signs and wonders amen shall follow them that believe I remember one time some of y'all here know Danny steeman I remember one time brother Danny was preaching and he got up and he was talking about signs and wonders following the believer and he said now here he said I'm the believer and he got two young boys and he said High sign and high wonders you know he called one signs and one wonders and he said now listen he said follow me amen so brother Danny started walking and everywhere brother Danny went he didn't turn around to see if they were still there he wasn't asking them are they still there he was not checking in with them to see if they were still there he said signs and wonders follow the believer he said so wherever I go signs and wonders go amen I think it's on the internet if you like said it sometime he said everywhere I go amen signs and wonders C so listen friends when we when we lose the sufficiently impr pressedness of the word is when we have to start stopping to check and make sure there's enough signs and wonders in the church amen for us to even claim to be Supernatural amen but I do not base the supernatural amen upon signs that can be impersonated I base it upon the word and as a Believer I am the word and then if I am the word signs and wonders are under a direct Mandate of the almighty God Amen to follow me wherever I am so if I'm here signs and wonders are here if I'm in Africa signs and wonders are there if I'm in Canada signs are Wonder come on wherever you go as a Believer church signs and wonders are following you amen because that's what God ordained them to do in John 4 Jesus said you won't believe except you see signs and wonders now how many realizes the Bible instructs us Amen to try the spirits the Bible brother preaches a whole sermon called discernment of spirit and what he says here amen is give them the word test notice he didn't say give it the sign test he said give it the word test amen spoken words Original Seed remember Moses born for the work had to wait on God for the extra gift for the job see he had to go back and wait amen for the time appointed amen now listen the people now listen a certain Pharaoh had to be on the throne and the people had to be wanting the bread of life before God would send him back amen that reminds me brother Josh's sermon here the other day amen on the blessing of hunger amen listen somebody had to be wanting the bread before God sent it somebody had to be wanting the Deliverance amen before God would send Moses into Egypt he said now with thousands of sign workers in this last day amen has created a generation of sign Seekers that knows no more anything about the true move of God in his word in these last days he said give him blood and oil and fleshly demonstration on the platform and they'll support it whether it's God's word or not whether it's scripture or not amen but Jesus warned us of such thing he said now listen Matthew 24 there'll be two spirits and they'll be very close alike and they will deceive the very elected if possible he said now how can you tell them amen give them the word test how can you know it speak the word and see what they say about it amen if they don't believe the word they have no seat germ in them they are of the evil one and deceive you as the first bride was deceived and the second bride was deceived they are deceivers of the third bride by hybriding the word or trying to uh can I say this God never plac signs ahead of his word he said amen that's a scorcher amen but God never placed signs amen ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word amen but the word was first amen the signs and wonders were added amen for the proof of the word amen but the word was first he said want me to prove it to you look at Elijah when he went to the woman he said make me a cake first amen then watch the miracle happen amen come to the word first amen and then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the Holy Spirit enteres what are you saying preacher I'm saying the miracle don't take place on the sign the miracle don't take place on the Wonder amen the miracle according to a prophet the miracle takes place on the word he said you begin to believe God's word amen and then the Miracle takes place on the word because the word is the seed that brings forth the miracle amen God to take the word first the holy spirit gives it life amen like water falling from Heaven amen can I say this to you amen the Holy Spirit does not energize your flesh only it does not energize your spirit only amen but the Holy Spirit energizes your soul amen and the soul is the real you then I tell you what we need to do is we need to unclog the channel amen of inspiration in our soul and let the inspired word amen strike the real us amen and let a breath of wind come out of our soul it says we'll stand with a word if we have to stand alone we'll stand with what a prophet told if everybody rejects it we can't help it we got to stand we got to stand church amen I am sufficiently impressed with the word that is standing in our midst amen the prophet makes it very beautiful speaking of David he said David was inspired as could be all the people was sh shouting and glorifying God Amen for a reason that seemed exactly scripture but he was the wrong person the inspiration should have come to Nath and not David he never consulted Nathan and do you see what happened see God said he does nothing amen till he reveals it to his servants the prophets and job was this prophet in this day now the only thing God had done to job what always give him wisdom in his word and inspiration but he could he could get no inspiration he knowed he had all the mechanics he had offered the burnt offering he had done everything he know to do was right but he couldn't get a word from God now watch job he cannot get a word from God I love this but the devil couldn't move him now let me say this sometimes you're going to be like job and you cannot get a word from God Amen so the devil will come in and impersonate a sign to give you a word to mislead you that's why you've got to be sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst you've got to know come on now remember the remember the the the the angel light come to to Luther I believe it was or Martin and said Fall Down and Worship me said here's the nails cars said here's the crown of thorns he said but I looked at him amen and I knew that wasn't God in the age he promised to be here in like that he said so I knew it was a devil amen impersonating God let me just say this church amen when you can't get a word from God Amen but the devil couldn't move him he said now there you are when you're prayed for you don't have to run back through a line or go let somebody else pray for you when you know you've done exactly what God Said to do see then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you and now I'm Healed and when it drops in there then it's all over oh you don't need no prayer line nothing else it's over it has been revealed to you just like Simeon amen the day Simeon received the promise I will not die until I see the Lord's Christ amen there were many days between Simeon and the Fulfillment of that promise but never one time amen did Simeon let the devil amen bring another child in front of him and say this is the child amen because Simeon was sufficiently impressed amen with the inspired word that said you'll not die until you have seen the Lord's Christ listen you're looking at one country preacher amen that is sufficiently impressed with the words of the seventh angel if he said Church ought to be run this way that's the way we're going to run it if he said deacons ought to be placed this way that's the way we're going to place them if he said we ought to preach this way that's the way we're going to preach come on church amen if he said we shouldn't have televisions in our home amen then we're not going to have them if he said we shouldn't look like the world and we're not going to look like it and I don't care come hell or high water amen we're not going to back off and let some sign come in the place of this message and lead the church now I know where I'm standing amen oh God I might as well preach since we're here amen I know it's an age where people are losing the ability to be sufficiently impressed with just preaching the message so they get up and say well if we just teach the Deep things we're going to have an intellectual church and we're going to lose our young people and we're going to dry up and die well I refuse to believe that nonsense amen cuz I am a believer that wherever you preach this message it is the Breath of God listen you're looking at somebody that stood in churches amen that men told me amen I should never even go preach in but I went there and preach this message with all kinds of funny ideas and stood there and declared what a prophet said and watched the Breath of God breathe across the church and change hearts and lives I am an advocate for the preaching of the message of the hour listen we can do without everything else but we cannot do without the message of the hour it's the direction to the church now I know what I'm talking about because it's an age where people think now oh God am then now we don't check the message we don't check check the church by the message we check the message by the church so if the message teaches against it but we think it's okay we just go right on with what the church is okay but let me say this how long's going to be before we're back in Babble and confusion come on now brother BR preached Church order for a reason it wasn't a suggestion it was a it was a it was a Vindicated word of a prophet who was trying to set the church amen in order and he wasn't moving the church back into Corinthians he was trying to get him into Ephesians we already had a Corinthian and he preached an entire sermon called the Corinthians the book of Correction but then he comes into his ministry and said but according to Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30 we are promised another Ephesian he said there'll come an understanding in the church amen and that understanding will come by the word oh thank you Lord Jesus the understanding will come by the word and job said there is a spirit the inspiration of the almighty amen giveth him the understanding amen then what is bringing the the inspiration or rather what is bringing the understanding amen is the Breath of God in the Church of God which is positionally placed in that church amen not in a Pentecostal age amen a birth but in an adoption age which a prophet called The Bride age amen when it's revealed to you that you yourself has received God's promis inspiration you being Christian amen it struck you you don't even need a prayer line the only thing you need is an open heart when all the mechanics are ready and let the inspiration drop in then nothing can change your mind you've got it nothing can change your mind you've got it now listen what brother B said he said now notice job he needed a Channel of inspiration he had it open but he had the channel to communicate with God by his inspiration he had a way of moving himself out now here's the big problem job had a way of moving himself out amen and let the word of God move in can we say that together move ourself out and let the word of God move in now you want to fix a bunch of confusion move yourself out and let the word of God move in the situation you want to fix a bunch of false Doctrine move yourself out the way and let the word move in said we got to move ourselves out of the way he said the greatest enemy I've got is William brandom he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it when he does that shs God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's H the way then God can come over and do things that William brandham knows nothing about he said that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody who will get themsel out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot be used of God can I say this when we're in the way when we are in the way amen we block the inspiration of God but when we're out of the way amen then the inspired word moves in and does things do you realize that's what the song service is to do is to get ourself out of the way so that the word can come in the church and can work effectually and mightily Among Us amen y'all imagine just walking in out of your cars and sitting down and open the Bible and start preaching amen your minds on everything your mind's on the day your mind's on the week your mind's on the situation amen but when you be to sing the songs of Zion amen a prophet of God said a holy ghost filled pianoist in church order and a holy ghost filled pianoist gets up and begins to play amen and begins to begins to drive Devils away come on now amen and what you're doing is you are creating an atmosphere for the word I think Josiah preached on it a while back amen creating an atmosphere for Revival amen let me ask you church amen if we don't create an atmosphere amen then the word's going to come and it's going to stand in the corner with dirty feet amen but if somebody amen will let the Holy Ghost amen open their eyes to the Revelation he's not in a grave in Jerusalem he's not in a tomb in je Jeffersonville but he's right here this morning in the Dynamics of his power in the manifestation of his resurrection and he's not here as an onlooker he's here he's here breathing on the church inspiring our hearts Awakening our Spirits refreshing Our Lives when the word moves in and does things brother said now it's a great thing to come up here and preach a gospel that can make people actually that was once a bootlegger and gamblers and prostitutes and everything else all on the street sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and can feel the inspiration of the spirit amen to rise you to a place till you lose yourself and scream out amen hallelujah praises to God that's a wonderful thing now come on Church that's a direct quote the Holy Ghost can move you and you can feel the inspiration of the spirit raise you to a place till you lose yourself and scream out do you see what happened amen you got out of the way so the word could move in you got your ideas out of the way so the word can move it now come on if you're going through something amen and in your mind you're trying to fix it you're trying to solve it you're trying to work it out you don't know how it's going to happen what's going to happen what's Heen you got all these things on your mind amen and you say it in the service with that on your mind and the preacher stands up and says our God is a way maker if yourself is still in the way you're going to say well I don't know how this is going to happen I don't know how it's going to work out amen but if you get yourself out of the way and the word of God brings over you and says God is a way maker amen then without your selfcontrol and your praise you're going to scream out amen hallelujah oh come on Church praises to God Amen what's happening amen the word has found a place of influence in the church of living God Amen in that same audience amen the gospel being preached and say what he was now to identify him again amen right back the same one amen identified word can I say this to you Church the identified resurrected word is back in our midst and we are sufficiently impressed by it now let me say this somebody say well brother we got to be careful amen because parts of the scriptures inspired Parts hard well let me ask you this amen doesn't the Bible say in second Timothy 3:13 evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou Hast learned and has been assured of Amen knowing of whom thou Hast learned them can I ask you something where did we learn the truth on the word of God we learned it by the spirit of truth that anointed a prophet so I'm not going to get in the last days and start questioning my teacher I'm not going to get here at the end time and start questioning who taught me these things listen I'm going to stand on the revelation of what I've been taught and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise under salvation amen through faith which is in Christ Jesus look at verse 16 of 2 Timothy 3:16 all scripture can we say that together all scripture is given by inspiration of God all scripture is given by the Breath of God Amen and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness now you all going to think I'm silly okay but brother Joe I looked up the definition of that word all can I tell you what it means each every any all the whole everyone all things everything any Scripture the whole scripture all scripture everything in the scripture oh come on Church any Scripture all things in the scripture is this truth it's given by the inspiration of God in the second seal he said we're so glad to to to be living in the day that God is revealing itself to us he said now all scripture is inspired the scriptures must be absolutely the truth no way around it let me back up he said I believe the great day has just begin to Dawn breaking the lights are begin to flash the birds of paradise has begin to sing in the Saint's heart they know that it isn't long now something's going to happen it's just got to now all scripture is inspired the scriptures must be absolutely be the truth no way around it there's where I different with our Catholic friends I believe that it was not written by just mere man I believe it was moved by the Holy Spirit and all these little things that has been added tried to add to it did you notice in the solving up the way everyone was kicked out these real true scriptures amen dovetail one with the other till there's no contradiction in them nowhere at all again he said Jesus said all scripture is inspired and not one bit of it can keep from being fulfilled there is no way Amen to keep the scriptures from being fulfilled can I give you another one he said I believe that Jesus Christ keeps every word all scripture is inspired I don't believe we have one right and we'll be condemned forward if we add one word to it or take one word from it let me say this nobody amen will take the script scriptures and add to or take away amen and say say I'm okay in it but I tell you what they do do is they take the message and they hack here and they hack there and they trim his and they add this and say now here's the direction can I tell y'all something amen by Bible says that Moses gathered him up on the mountain and said this day I call Heaven and Earth to record against you don't you add to or take away from one thing that I've said amen and brother brandham stood and said as Moses did so do I don't you add two or take away one thing amen from what's in this quot what's in this tapes let me say this friends I think it's high time Amen to throw our scissors away I think it's high time Amen to throw our cookie coat or clutch away I think it's time to come back and just say what a prophet said and let the Breath of God blow across the church and Inspire the church with a fresh reality with a fresh anointing with a fresh Vision oh church of living God it's time to get back to just saying what a prophet said and let it have influence in the church that believes what he said we're living in another day now I tell you where that Spirit come from that Spirit was around in brother b's day that Spirit of cutting and hacking and putting together and showing I know what I'm talking about I know exactly where I'm standing it's a spirit brother tells a story y'all remember he said that woman fell sick her son Kevin her son was over there overseas and she got real sick so they went down there and checked on her and they said you need prayer so they went in prayed for him they said now where's your son she said well he's actually away in Ministry he's studying they said well you're dying so you need to call for him so she called for her son to come home and he couldn't get there in time so a few days later he gets a postcard and the postcard says you know hey doing good God bless you honey see when you get home so when he gets home he walks in he says mom he says now you were dying he said I couldn't get here he said but now you're well what happened she said well honey said the local gospel Full Gospel Church not the local part gospel the local Full Gospel that believed all scripture any Scripture everything in the scripture all things in the scripture the whole thing amen they believed in it and they come down there and they prayed for me according to Mark 16 she said well honey he read it right out of the Bible these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and she said I believe that in God healed me he said mother that was Mark 16 he was reading from I said yes said well you see in the Seminary we learned amen that Mark 16 from the ninth verse on is not inspired and she said Glory Hallelujah herself was out of the way and the word had moved in she could not control her response to the word she said Glory Hallelujah why he said mother you begin to act like those people shame on you said what's the matter with you said I was just thinking thinking son do you mean to tell me that Mark the 16th chapter of God's Bible from the 9th verse on is not inspired said no it isn't mother it was put in there by a false witness now can I tell you how far that spirit will take you it'll take you to even saying the one that spoke it was a false witness come on go read Mark 16 it's not in Black letters it's in Red Letters which means it was the literal words that was recorded from the lips of Jesus Christ and they call that a false witness she said well praise the Lord he said what's the matter with you mom said I was just just thinking if God could heal me with the uninspired word then what could he do with that which is really inspired if he could heal me with the uninspired word then what could he do with that which's really inspired that's it see we have to believe all God's word is inspired and it all has its right meanings so all of the false conceptions of the earth which looks real and looks so reasonable is only a perverted Act of the devil from the original plan of God I think we ought to Pastor that quote all over the social media amen we have to believe all God's word is inspired and it has all its right meanings so all of the false conceptions of the earth which looks real and looks so reasonable is only a perverted Act of the devil from the original plan of God he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth how the mouth of God can I tell you what a prophet said he said in Mark 16 is just as in inspired as John 3:16 he said thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action is the true church amen that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be don't get mad at me but any spirit that says Mark 16 is a false witness amen is a false spirit amen and any spirit that says this message is a false witness of the power of God in the AG we're living in it's a false witness come on now Mark 16 is the sign of the true church now can I can I just I'm I'm I'm going to tie this together but sister cim I got to thinking amen Mark 16 the verse they chose was the nth verse they said from the ninth verse on brother Shi that's not even inspired so being the guy I am amen I want to know what the ninth verse said so I went over to Mark 16:9 read it and here's what it said now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils from the verse Oh God from the verse of his appearing at the resurrection that brought a Deliverance into her life they say from that verse on is uninspired so from that oh God so they're saying from the time he appeared on everything is uninspired amen you see they were teaching his appearing to Mar Magdalene was a false witness but here's the problem Mary Magdalene was a true witness so the false witness could not defeat her testimony because she was the one that had the Seven Devils she was the one that knew the torment of the enemy she was the one that was bound but she was also the one that had recognized his appearing in the age she was living in and when she oh God hallelujah when she recognized his appearing amen what did he say he said receive ye the Holy Ghost amen and whosoever sins you shall remit they shall be remitted and whoever sins you shall retain shall be retain in other words his breath amen was more than just a breath amen it was an authority coming in the church and listen Faith Tabernacle I believe there's some end time word Believers here that will not back off of this message they will not receive false accusation they will not bow their KN is something that's reasonable probable looks good they will stand on the infallible thus sayith the Lord and back every devil in hell up cuz we have seen the [Music] Lord we have seen the Lord we recognized his appearing now you saider what are you getting at the word of the Lord comes to the prophet the inspiration of the day and age comes to the prophet of that age Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophet Revelation 3:14 un the angel now now let's not read this just like a Baptist this morning no offense under the angel of the church L of sins right these things say the amen the faithful true witness the beginning the creation of God the what that that's the way they read it but today we can read it like this under William Mary and brandham is that okay the angel symbol has been revealed we now have a personal identification to the symbol of the Church of the leans write these things saith the amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I wish I could preach this morning in other words the God that was in the beginning I'm not saying that to you I'm saying to myself the God that was in the beginning has come all the way to the end time and the same God that was breathing in the creation there has returned in the last days and is breathing once again in the creation here and the prophet said Remember the message is promised and when all these Mysteries has been so bundled up by a bunch of Ecclesiastes ecclesiastical it will take a direct profit from God to reveal it listen now remember the word of the Lord comes to the prophet not the Theologian the word of the Lord comes to the prophet amen not the Theologian you want to scare the socks off of me tell me some man is a theologian in this message I mean just be honest with you you want you want to you want to make me uncomfortable in the conversation is tell me some man is a theologian and he's got all the information all the understanding and we ought to submit to what he says amen I'll tighten up on you quicker than a turtle goes in his shell amen because the word of the Lord does not come to your Theologian it comes to the prophet he is a reflector of God's word listen and he cannot say nothing he can't say his own thoughts he can only speak what God reveals listen friends that's why I say say What's on them tapes it's not the faults of William brandom it's not the suggestions of William brandom it's what God thinks about the word he could only say what was spoken to him by God even the prophet balam when he was trying to be sold sell his right he said How can any Prophet say anything but what God puts in his mouth it's a thing that God does and you can't say nothing else you're born that way listen friends William brandom was born Amen to say what God told him to say make fun of me ridicule me if you want to but I was born to say what a prophet said not change it one bit not add to it take away from it put all my studies together and present it to the church as a new way to go and do things I say what a prophet said now I'm I'm I'm going to preach it for a second we're going to go home okay because it's a danger in the last days didn't Timothy R and say these words he said perilous time shall come didn't I say that brother perilous time shall come so in the last days there's a danger and the danger is uninspired leadership the prophet of God said it's been always these time a group of lead leaders that gets all people mixed up it's not so much the people it's the leaders that get them mixed up you say oh brother brandom well now listen can I can I oh God I'm going get in trouble can I tell you how America how how you could fix a lot of problems in America let me tell you if you take the leaders behind closed doors and sit down on both sides and solve it is that okay if you get the leaders together and say now your party's got this Pew of you and our part and work it out but you know why you got people screaming vulgar things you know why you got people shooting and stabbing is because somebody involved people in a fight they should have never been a part of come on church and what's happening in the natural the devil will try in the spiritual said watch it's the leaders that get the people mixed up now you know what happens don't you is somebody gets up and sets a direction apart from what the prophet T so somebody down the road say well the prophet said so he corrects that guy and now that guy's correcting this guy are y'all hearing me and before long everybody's correcting everybody and ain't nobody correcting the situation and you got a bunch of Crossfire in the church and people are literally dying by confusion but the prophet of God said here's what happened is is uninspired leadership is what done it amen uninspired leadership now watch the theologians uninspired leadership that's why they called Mark 16 uninspired is there uninspired themselves but now watch theologians uninspired leadership say the same thing about his appearing in the last day hence forth second Timothy 4:8 there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous dud shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love he is appearing now look at this word appearing it's appearance often used to the Glorious manifestation of the Gods and especially of their Advent to help in the New Testament in the New Testament the Advent of Christ not only that which is already taken place by which his presence and power appear in the saving light he is sh upon mankind but also the illustrtion return from Heaven to Earth to occur in the future now John brother said John was so sure he was going to see the Messiah till he said he's in our midst now now watch there's a big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and Jesus coming there's two different words means two different things the appearing of the Lord the coming of the Lord now watch now the appearing of the Lord is now when he's appearing in his people his spirit is working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the Rapture for the come of the Lord to catch away his bride the appearing the the appearing and the coming from that time 62 you all know this quote by heart my Ministry is different I'm a pastor teacher I'm not I'm if I say anything wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean to but this is my Ministry is to declare him he's here in other words my Ministry in John 20 he stood there himself and said I'm in your midst in the days of John the Baptist John stood on the banks or in the river and looked upon the banks and said behold the messiah's come in this day brother BR said now watch he said I'm declaring he's here so John the Baptist brother brandham both Ministries fulfilled the prophesied comings of Elijah right one was the third coming one was the fourth coming but now watch both Ministries were ministries of introduction they were forerunning the the coming of the Messiah now can I can can you look at Hebrews 6:20 with me in Hebrews 620 the Bible says this whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus which is made a high priest Forever After the order of MDC now look at this word Forerunner it is a forerunner especially one who is sent before to take observation to act as a spy to scout a light armed Soldier one who comes in advanced now watch this one who comes in advance to a place where the rest are to follow so brother Bill the Forerunner goes before in the place but then there's some more that's to follow and them said my mission I believe to the Earth is what to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the Millennium and has everything right there because he is the word he said how can a messenger sent from God just believe some of the scripture and not all the word deny part of it the true prophet of God will proclaim the word in the last days denominations will hate him but he will not pull any punches on them he will be like he was when he come the first coming of Christ you generation of opers but the predestinated will hear and will make ready for the count down amen y y'all hear this remember say we we we we're going to have a forerunner and he's going to go Advance he's going to go before and what he's going to do is he's going to check there now what he checks others are going to follow y'all remember talked about going swimming as a kid he said we go down there at the swimming hole and sister Jane he said we didn't hardly have no clothes he said we'd take off running down there he said when we got down there he said I was always the first one in the water now some people take it as stories I take it as scriptural uh scriptural illustration he said I was the first one in the water he said I had a nail Mark he had that nail wrapped around that overall and he said I pulled the nail the clothes went he said I was the first one in the water he said now when I jumped in the water he said here's what I do he said if the water was cold I'd hang up one hold up one finger and say wait a second he said but if the water was just right he said I held up two fingers and I said it was good come on in now watch this he said in everything clothes go to scattering everybody would be in the message I mean everybody would be in the pool and brother I'm telling you now to you guys that's never been in the pool he said I've got two fingers up it's just right jump into it and find out you will find out it's wonderful the spirit of God is bathing through the people the Holy Ghost and sanctify find power cleans and healing oh it's marvelous Oh Glory to God Church there's oh Hallelujah somebody say brother Andrew what are you doing I'm in the message I'm swimming in the message I'm swimming in the seals I'm swimming in the church ages I'm swimming in the Revelation and I'm holding up two fingers everywhere I go and I'm saying come on church amen there's power in the message there's overcoming power there's joy in the message you want some Liberty to dance amen start preaching this message you want some Liberty to shout start preaching this message you want some peace in your life start listening this message amen get in the message is where all the inspiration and the Breath of God is breathing what are you saying belander I'm saying this we are not deceived as Adam the first Adam was deceived we are not deceived Hallelujah we know in whom we have believed listen John 20 and I'm closing on this point I promise John 20:22 when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost look at this word breathe to blow or breathe upon whether Jesus after the manner of the Hebrew prophets expressed where Jesus after the manner of the Hebrew prophets expressed by the symbolic Act of breathing upon the apostles the communication of the power of the Holy Spirit to them this word's only used once by the lxx translator in Genesis 2:7 where God breathed on Adam and he became a living Soul just as the original are you ready for this just as the original creation was completed by an act of God so to the new creation was completed by an act from the head of the new [Music] creation headship is here the same one that breathed in the beginning has come to the end on now he breathed on creation brother Shmi and what you see out there today is the completion of the Breath of God in the First Act of Creation listen Church the valley of dry bones you ever been there you ever got dry two of you three of you got dry couldn't raise your hands like he used to couldn't worship like he used to couldn't praise like he used to couldn't shout like he used to yeah you know what the Bible said there was a valley of dry bones and the Bible said these words can these bones live again brother Bill can these bones live again there's there's nothing but bones there's no senu there's no skin there's no muscle it's just bones now y'all just give me a second here in this because I want to make this as good as I can for you y'all imagine Them Bones laying there for years y'all seen them buzzards out there they pick and pull apart and carry and take and set you know and they get a little kingdom of bones and that's their bones and another buzzer gets some bones over here and that's his kingdom of Bones and oh God I'm preaching now a't it Daniel Amen another another buzzer gets some bones over here and carries them over here and that's his kingdom of Bones and before long it's just bones and none of the bones together to actually go to the B they're all scattered so so so so One Man's Bones might be two acres down from the other man's bone are you hearing me they were all scattered but when the word the Lord come over that entire valley of dry bones the son of man said prophesy and he stood there and prophesied over those bones and watch what happened he said as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise want to talk about dead church we'll talk about one there there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone not bone to bone bone to his bone Oh Glory not bone to bone amen Jim didn't get John's leg bone and John get Jim's ear bone amen but Jim's ear bone went to Jim's leg bone and John's ear bone went to John's leg are you hearing me Church bone to his bone and when I beheld low the senu and the flesh come upon them and the skin covered them but there was no breath in them then said unto me prophesy on the Wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayi the Lord God come for the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon thee slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and they stood up on their feet an exceeding great Army glory to God are y'all hearing me that's the same thing that happened in the Book of John after God breathed on them there come Authority with the Breath of God when the prophet breathe upon the valley of dry bones there come breath there come sinue there come flesh but there also come Authority they become oh God they become an exceeding great great Army let our musicians come this morning now what are you getting at brother Andrew brother B said it very beautiful he said the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same sign justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what is the Pentecostals leaves clap their hand Joy rejoice in Pentecostal what the word the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh the fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism Holy Ghost of the organization died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch I'm one of them Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so they can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture we the Justified Sanctified and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid are you
