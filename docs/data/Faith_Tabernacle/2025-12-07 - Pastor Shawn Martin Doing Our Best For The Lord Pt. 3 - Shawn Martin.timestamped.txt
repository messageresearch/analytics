[12:40] softly now, we've got a few written
[12:42] prayer requests we want to make known
[12:44] this morning. Amen. As brother Amos gets
[12:47] ready to come and lead us in prayer.
[12:49] Amen. But uh we want to keep Brother
[12:51] John Weekes in our prayers. Um he goes
[12:54] in for surgery on Wednesday to have his
[12:57] pacemaker uh replaced. So let's just
[13:00] keep him in our prayers. Um also um
[13:04] Sister Hope put in a request this
[13:06] morning. Uh her cousin um
[13:11] and his son was in a house fire which
[13:15] was caused by an explosion this morning
[13:18] at at 6 this morning. the son did pass
[13:21] away and uh they airlifted uh the his
[13:25] dad. Uh so we want to keep uh the the
[13:28] the father and the family in our
[13:30] prayers. Amen. Uh the mom and and
[13:34] brother are distraught in need of our
[13:36] prayers this morning. So let's just
[13:38] remember them. And also uh grandma uh is
[13:42] in our need of our prayers. They found a
[13:44] spot where the cancer used to be and
[13:47] they don't know what it is yet. Um, so
[13:51] there the doctors think it might be
[13:54] cancer again, but they're going to try
[13:55] to run some tests and just see. So,
[13:58] let's just pray that the Lord would just
[13:59] be with her and dissolve that spot.
[14:02] Amen. And we want to uh remember Sister
[14:05] Martha, Sister Kim Weekes, and um,
[14:08] Sister Janice, and um, all of them in
[14:11] our prayers this morning. Amen. How many
[14:13] has an unspoken request by lift your
[14:15] hands? Man, the Lord sees every need
[14:17] this morning. And let's remember our
[14:19] pastor that the Lord would just move in
[14:21] a special way. Amen.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said uh by this shall all men know
[14:30] that you're my disciples that you have
[14:32] love one for another. And one way to
[14:35] express that love is to pray for the
[14:37] people that we have uh been mentioned
[14:40] here this morning. Uh we've got another
[14:44] request here and I have brought this
[14:47] name up here before.
[14:49] Uh brother Leonard Seismore. He's been a
[14:52] pastor over in West Virginia for many
[14:54] years. I'll just read what his wife
[14:58] uh has sent me and I asked for an
[15:00] abbreviated version but this is what she
[15:02] sent me and it's got an update or two
[15:04] with it. She says, "My husband, brother
[15:07] Leonard Sismore from United States has
[15:10] been given a diagnosis of mystic brain
[15:12] cancer. The reason it is considered
[15:16] mystic is because the brain only
[15:18] produces one tumor of original brain
[15:21] cancer. If your test shows multiple
[15:23] tumors on your brain, then your cancer
[15:25] has traveled from a different organ and
[15:27] attached itself to your brain."
[15:29] According to what was told us at the
[15:31] West Virginia University Thomas Memorial
[15:34] Hospital in Charleston, original brain
[15:37] cancer will always only have one tumor.
[15:40] In the event there are more than one
[15:41] tumor on the brain, it's not true brain
[15:44] cancer, but cancer has dissected and
[15:47] travel from a different organ. At this
[15:50] time, at least four tumors can be seen
[15:52] on brother Leonard's brain, which tells
[15:55] us he does not have brain cancer, but
[15:57] some other cancer that has made its way
[16:00] to his brain. He has a PET schedule in
[16:03] the early part of January done in our
[16:06] patient clinic, outpatient clinic that
[16:08] should tell us exactly where the main
[16:11] mother tumor is hidden at. Regardless of
[16:13] the original source, Leonard has made
[16:16] the decision along with mine and our two
[16:18] daughters to not forego any treatment
[16:21] for the affected organs. It would either
[16:23] be
[16:25] it would be either chemo or radiation
[16:27] therapy.
[16:30] For the brain, he would have to have a
[16:32] needle biopsy through his skull and one
[16:34] of the tumors to retrieve a sample.
[16:37] Leonard is 80 years old. He only has 40%
[16:41] lung function from his work on strip
[16:43] mines. He has a pacemaker and has aphib.
[16:48] We both agree that when his time comes
[16:50] to leave this earthly home, an earthly
[16:53] body, he will step into that beautified
[16:55] body we are promised by our savior.
[16:58] Thank you so much very much for your
[17:00] prayers. An update. Leonard got a
[17:03] diagnosis of mastic brain cancer that
[17:06] has traveled to his brain from another
[17:08] organ. And she goes on to say there's
[17:11] four tumors on his brain, but with all
[17:13] the test scans, MRIs, biopsies, they
[17:16] could not tell us where the cancer
[17:18] traveled from to his brain. His power of
[17:21] concentration is extremely poor. If he
[17:24] tries to read the scripture, he has to
[17:26] read it several times to remember what
[17:29] he has read. and uh mind that add he has
[17:32] pastored a church over there in near
[17:35] Pineville, West Virginia
[17:38] uh for many many years and uh he's
[17:41] represented this message and uh so let's
[17:44] just if you would I met the brother
[17:46] already I actually spoke from their
[17:48] pulpit over there one time and u they're
[17:51] fine people but he's really needing a
[17:54] touch of God whatever the Lord's will
[17:56] would be but we're going to pray for his
[17:57] healing as well as the rest of these
[18:00] request us. God is a problem solver. I'm
[18:03] glad he's a I know he's a problem solver
[18:05] cuz he solved many of mine. I was one of
[18:08] his biggest problems. Praise the Lord.
[18:11] Hallelujah. He solved my problem. Amen.
[18:14] So, let's remember these requests. I
[18:16] know there's a whole lot to read there,
[18:18] but so we understand what's going on
[18:21] there and these other requests. This
[18:23] explosion, this loved one that's passed
[18:25] away and the others in emergency uh
[18:28] situation. But let's look to the Lord in
[18:31] prayer.
[18:32] Our gracious God, this morning, Lord, as
[18:34] we all join our hearts together in
[18:36] prayer, we come before you knowing that
[18:38] you're the great high priest of our
[18:41] confession, ever interceding for us.
[18:43] Lord, each and every one of us, you
[18:45] intercede for, Lord. You intercede for
[18:48] your children through their good times
[18:50] and through the bad times, through their
[18:52] weaknesses, through their strengths. Oh
[18:54] God. Lord, there's some of us that have
[18:56] been blessed in different ways. And then
[18:59] some of us, Lord, we have to compensate,
[19:02] Lord, through other means, God. Maybe we
[19:04] don't have a strong body, Lord, like
[19:06] somebody else. Or we've been afflicted
[19:08] or some tumor, some cancer, some some
[19:11] sort of illness or arthritis or some
[19:14] sort of devil, a spot has been found on
[19:17] this sister, Lord God. And Lord Jesus,
[19:20] God, you know about these things. And we
[19:22] know these bodies are temporary homes,
[19:26] God. We don't We know that we can't take
[19:28] away the wrinkles. We know we can't take
[19:30] away the the the bone joint, Lord, that
[19:34] material that seems to evaporate, Lord,
[19:36] out of them joints. But God, we know
[19:39] that healing is still the children's
[19:41] bread.
[19:43] You promise that our yoke would be easy
[19:45] and our burden would be light. And God,
[19:47] sometimes a body, we know that the devil
[19:50] attacks his vulnerability, Lord, because
[19:53] of the fallenness, Lord, that it is in
[19:56] the state it's in. Lord, Satan just he
[19:59] ways, Benny. God, we're not giving him
[20:02] any credit, but we know he's got that
[20:04] punch coming. But Lord, help us TO
[20:06] REALIZE THAT WE'VE ALSO GOT A PUNCH we
[20:09] can deliver back to the devil with the
[20:11] sword, which is a word. And father God,
[20:14] the word is in our lips and it's nigh
[20:16] us. And dear God, we know that you are
[20:19] you bore us our stripes for our healing
[20:22] so that we could serve you better in
[20:25] this body. We don't ask for Lord, we are
[20:28] asking for a body change and we know
[20:30] that at the appropriate time that will
[20:32] come, that will happen. But God, until
[20:35] that time, may you give us strength and
[20:38] healing in our body. When we think of
[20:40] this brother, pastor, brother Leonard
[20:42] over there that's served this church, oh
[20:45] God, for many years, Lord, he's worked
[20:48] in the coal mines. And Lord, only 40% of
[20:51] his lungs is is working, oh God. And
[20:53] Lord, he's fighting this tumor now. And
[20:56] I think Lord when I went with him Lord
[20:58] to the last time I seen him to visit
[21:01] that neighbor down the street that he
[21:03] took the church age book down there Lord
[21:05] and he was witnessing to him about the
[21:07] message and instructing him in the in
[21:10] the word. Oh God I pray Lord Jesus you
[21:13] remember all of his labors Lord.
[21:16] God, we just ask you'd move. And Lord,
[21:19] the the word was this morning, they
[21:21] can't even have service because brother
[21:23] Leonard's not in the shape that he
[21:26] should be in. Father God, to have
[21:27] service, God, we pray you'd be with that
[21:30] little church, Lord. And all the other
[21:32] churches, Lord, a church in
[21:33] Pennsylvania, church out there, Brother
[21:35] Marty Mccomomas, Lord, without a pastor
[21:37] now, Lord, another one in North Carolina
[21:40] and here and there. There's a bunch of
[21:42] them, dear God, that need pastors. Lord,
[21:45] it's just the same thing. Lord, you
[21:47] didn't bring a disjointed body. You
[21:49] didn't bring a freak body. Lord, if
[21:51] there's a true assembly somewhere, dear
[21:53] God, there's a pastor for it. Bottom
[21:56] line and the story, that's your word.
[21:58] You promise that God, you promise to
[22:00] raise up five-fold ministry, evangelist,
[22:02] pastors. Dear God, may you raise them
[22:04] up. We pray with each and every request
[22:07] this morning. Lord, bless our pastor as
[22:09] he comes to minister the word of God.
[22:11] May we have receptive hearts and ears to
[22:13] hear the word of the Lord. May it be
[22:16] come. May our revelation to open all our
[22:19] hearts to revelation. Lord, enlighten
[22:21] our eyes. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[22:23] name. We give you thanks and glory.
[22:26] Prayer request that was read Wednesday
[22:28] night. You've answered. We give you
[22:30] praise for that. We give you
[22:31] thanksgiving back to you. We just praise
[22:34] you now for what you're doing right now
[22:37] for these prayer requests in Jesus name.
[22:39] Amen.
[22:43] You can be seated.
[22:45] Oh, I bless your name.
[22:52] Lord, I give you honor.
[22:58] I give you praise.
[23:04] You are the life.
[23:10] Oh, the truth the way.
[23:16] Oh, I bless your name.
[23:22] Oh, I bless your hope. Do you have a
[23:25] song for us? Sing it again.
[23:28] Lord, I bless your name.
[23:35] Oh, I bless your name. name.
[23:41] Lord, I give you honor.
[23:47] Oh, I give you praise.
[23:53] For you are the life,
[23:59] oh, the truth, the way.
[24:06] Lord, I bless your name.
[24:12] Oh, I bless
[24:14] your name.
[24:26] The storm they were facing was fearful.
[24:30] Their ships seemed so small in the waves
[24:36] and the wind just kept blowing harder.
[24:41] Yet they were all still so safe.
[24:46] From out of the dark he came walking.
[24:50] He had never lost them from view.
[24:55] He can see through the darkest of trles.
[25:00] Oh, he just wanted them to see it, too.
[25:06] That you'll never be filled. Till you're
[25:10] empty.
[25:12] Until you're broken, you'll never be
[25:15] whole.
[25:18] Until the potter has tried your vessel
[25:22] with fire, you'll never come forth as
[25:27] pure gold.
[25:30] I didn't know how much he loved me.
[25:35] Until I passed through the storm and
[25:38] looked,
[25:41] I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[25:46] needed.
[25:47] until he was all that I had.
[26:07] Sometimes the storm that you're facing
[26:12] may seem like your whole world has
[26:16] changed. changed and the fire just keeps
[26:21] getting hotter.
[26:24] But the parter, he's just shaping your
[26:27] clay.
[26:29] Friends, Jesus knows what he is doing.
[26:36] Even though it causes you pain,
[26:41] he just wants you to know the lessons he
[26:45] shows.
[26:47] His word remains the same.
[26:52] That you'll never be filled till you're
[26:56] empty.
[26:58] Until you're broken, you'll never be
[27:02] whole.
[27:04] Until the potter has tried your vessel
[27:08] with fire, you'll never come forth as
[27:13] pure gold.
[27:16] I didn't know how much he loved me
[27:21] until I passed through the storm and
[27:24] looked back.
[27:27] I didn't know Jesus
[27:30] was all that I needed
[27:33] until he was all that I had.
[27:38] I didn't know Jesus
[27:42] was all that I needed until he was all
[27:47] that I had.
[28:04] He's all
[28:06] I need.
[28:08] He's all
[28:11] I need.
[28:15] Jesus
[28:17] is all
[28:20] I need.
[28:24] Oh, he's all
[28:27] I need.
[28:30] He's all
[28:32] I need.
[28:36] Jesus
[28:38] is all
[28:40] I need. As brother Doug comes.
[28:44] Oh, he's all
[28:48] Is he all you need this morning? He's
[28:51] all
[28:52] I need.
[28:56] Jesus
[28:58] is all
[29:00] I need.
[29:05] For he satisfies
[29:10] every need.
[29:13] He abides.
[29:16] Jesus
[29:18] is all
[29:20] I need.
[29:25] Amen. Amen. Bless
[29:59] I like to apologize for something. Uh
[30:01] the other day when I got up to sing this
[30:04] mic one went over like that and I
[30:06] grabbed it real quick, you know, and
[30:08] there's a wrong attitude. The devil, you
[30:11] know, devil devil won't show me. Oh, you
[30:15] still got that temper,
[30:18] but forgive me.
[30:23] I may not have much money
[30:27] and my health is not the best.
[30:31] And when trials come against me, I don't
[30:36] always pass the tests.
[30:40] But when I stop and count my blessings,
[30:44] I couldn't ask for more.
[30:49] For everywhere I look, dear Lord,
[30:53] there's something to thank you for.
[31:00] Blessings
[31:02] of plenty
[31:04] I don't even have to ask.
[31:08] He has given
[31:10] so many,
[31:13] expecting
[31:14] nothing.
[31:17] Whether it's the universe
[31:21] or just outside my door,
[31:26] everywhere I look, dear Lord, there's
[31:30] something to thank you for
[31:46] as I Turn the pages of your word. I'm

[38:12] dedicate their little one. And you know
[38:15] we know that um
[38:17] uh we dedicate our children not not to
[38:21] save them. dedication does not save our
[38:25] children but
[38:27] you know it's scriptural that Jesus
[38:29] blessed the children he uh he said let
[38:32] them come to me and and the Bible says
[38:35] that he blessed them and as every parent
[38:39] we u that's our desire is that God would
[38:43] bless them we've um he was gracious to
[38:48] give us our children and we in turn want
[38:52] to give our children back to the Lord
[38:55] and ask um his blessings upon them and
[39:00] that he would use them and keep them. So
[39:03] if uh brother Annne, sister, brother
[39:06] Branson, sister Anne want to come. Amen.

[39:48] added to their little family, their
[39:51] home, and um I'm just been really proud
[39:55] of them both and their dedication to God
[39:59] and love for the Lord. and and as
[40:03] Christian parents,
[40:05] um we're just going to pray that God
[40:09] just gives them grace and wisdom. Amen.
[40:13] We're living in a rough world today. And
[40:16] uh Satan is he's not just he's no uh
[40:22] respector of age. And uh but we're just
[40:25] going to ask God's blessings upon this
[40:27] little little guy. Amen. Father,
[40:34] Lord, we've been just so glad that you
[40:39] have blessed brother Branson and Sister
[40:41] Anne and their home with this lovely
[40:46] child.
[40:48] Father, children are a blessing to us,
[40:51] Lord. And this is a
[40:55] commandment, a desire, Lord, from you
[40:59] that we would have children and that we
[41:02] would raise them in the fear of you.
[41:07] Now, Father, we're just asking
[41:10] that you would touch this child, Lord,
[41:12] and be with him, Lord,
[41:17] through the years, Lord, when he grows
[41:20] up, Father, that your presence would
[41:23] always be near him, Father, that you
[41:26] would direct his feet.
[41:28] Lord, into the paths of righteousness.
[41:32] Father, we know that Satan is lurking,
[41:36] Father. There's so many enticements in
[41:40] the world to draw children today.
[41:43] That Father, we're asking that you would
[41:45] keep him and bless him. Father, may he
[41:50] know you and experience you at an early
[41:52] age. Father, is our prayer. and may he
[41:57] commit his life to you as he grows. I
[42:02] pray that you would give brother
[42:03] Branson, Sister Anne, the wisdom,
[42:07] Father, uh, on how to raise a child,
[42:11] Father. There's going to be times of
[42:14] perplexity. There's times when they
[42:16] ain't going to know what to do. But,
[42:18] Father, may they hold to your hand. May
[42:22] they Lord look to you and seek your
[42:25] guidance and your word Father. And Lord
[42:30] I know Father that you will you will
[42:33] answer their prayer. Father unite them
[42:37] all together. Make them one and may they
[42:41] be one with you. May you be the center
[42:44] of their home, their life and everything
[42:47] that they do. We ask it, Father, in
[42:50] Jesus Christ's name.
[42:53] Amen. And amen.
[42:56] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[43:38] laptop, but we could stand to our feet.
[43:41] Amen. and um enjoyed the uh the songs

[43:55] anniversary today. Well, God bless you

[44:09] sister Alice and they have been a
[44:12] blessing to us uh through the years.
[44:16] They've been coming and um
[44:20] just good to see that God's blessed
[44:22] their life together.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] And um so we also want to remember
[44:30] brother Wayne will be here with us
[44:32] coming up here in a couple weeks I guess
[44:35] week and a half uh but um uh on the 19th
[44:39] through the 21st
[44:41] uh Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And so,
[44:44] uh, looking forward to what God has in
[44:46] store, uh, for us and, um, just
[44:51] encourage you to be praying, uh, for the
[44:54] services and God would just speak to our
[44:57] hearts. Amen. In a special way. Uh, if
[45:01] you have your Bibles, we're going to
[45:02] turn first of all to the book of
[45:04] Matthew,
[45:06] uh, the 9th chapter.
[45:14] Matthew the 9th chapter.
[45:17] We read this verse um
[45:22] last Wednesday and I think last Sunday
[45:24] as well, but
[45:30] so um Matthew 9 and we'll start at the
[45:33] 35th verse.
[45:36] And Jesus went about all the cities and
[45:39] villages teaching in their synagogues
[45:42] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[45:45] and healing every sickness and every
[45:47] disease among the people. But when he
[45:50] saw the multitude, he was moved with
[45:53] compassion on them because they fainted
[45:56] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[45:58] having no shepherd.
[46:01] Then saith he unto his disciples, the
[46:03] harvest truly is plenteous, but the
[46:06] laborers are few.
[46:08] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
[46:10] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[46:14] into his harvest. Amen. Then if you'll
[46:18] turn the book of John
[46:20] the uh 15th chapter
[46:28] in John chapter 15
[46:31] we'll read a few verses here
[46:36] Jesus saying I am starting at the first
[46:40] verse I am the true vine and my father
[46:44] is the husbandman
[46:46] every branch in He that beareth not
[46:48] fruit, he taketh away, and every branch
[46:50] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it,
[46:53] um that he may bring forth more fruit.
[46:57] Now you are clean through the word which
[47:00] I have spoken unto you.
[47:03] Abide in me and I in you. As the branch
[47:06] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[47:09] abide abide in the vine, no more can ye
[47:13] except ye abide me. I am the vine, you
[47:17] are the branches. He that abideth in me
[47:20] and I in him, the same bringeth forth
[47:23] much fruit. For without me, you can do
[47:27] nothing. Can you repeat that? For
[47:30] without me, you can do nothing. Let's
[47:34] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[47:37] Father,
[47:39] we're so thankful for the opportunity
[47:43] be gathered together,
[47:45] Lord. Not just a gathering, but we're
[47:49] gathered around your word.
[47:52] This place has been set aside not for
[47:55] games and and activities, Lord, but it's
[48:01] it's been set aside that we could come
[48:03] and hear your word and hear what you
[48:08] would have to say to us that we could
[48:10] draw strength and find help in time of
[48:14] need.
[48:15] Father, we're so thankful that we have a
[48:17] place to come to. And we're just asking
[48:20] now, Lord, that you would speak to our
[48:22] hearts. Father, anoint me, Father, as I
[48:28] would yield myself to thee. And Lord,
[48:31] that you may have your way and speak me
[48:34] to your people. And I pray that you
[48:37] would help the people just to surrender
[48:40] themselves,
[48:41] Lord, and get themselves out of the way,
[48:44] Lord, that your word could have
[48:45] preeminence.
[48:47] Any spirit that would try to hinder the
[48:50] service, may you drive it away, Lord,
[48:53] and may your word have the freedom here
[48:56] this morning. Any sick among us, may you
[49:00] heal them. any bondages, Lord, that the
[49:04] people may be in, I pray you deliver
[49:07] them. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[49:11] And the church says,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. You can have your
[49:16] seats this morning.
[49:20] I uh again want to just take the simple
[49:22] thought of uh doing our best uh for the
[49:27] Lord.
[49:28] And um you know I I consider it a real
[49:32] honor, amen, to be able to do something
[49:36] uh for the Lord to work for the kingdom
[49:38] of God. And it has, of course, I was uh
[49:44] raised in church, but it was always my
[49:48] uh desire uh to do something for God,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; to to to work for God. and um and I'm
[49:57] I'm glad that
[50:00] um he chose me to do something. It's
[50:03] it's it's very humbling and I I really
[50:06] think we all feel that way. Uh is is I
[50:11] think every believer wants to do
[50:13] something for the Lord and um in
[50:16] whatever way it would be and and so um
[50:22] whatever it is as we have talked about
[50:26] uh we want to do our best. Um, we're
[50:30] living in a an age
[50:33] uh where it was uh prophesied uh there
[50:37] in Revelations the 3 chapter speaking of
[50:40] this Leoysian age that that people would
[50:43] be lukewarm. They would uh
[50:48] be neither hot nor cold but lukewarm.
[50:52] They'd be complacent.
[50:54] So they'd be Christian,
[50:56] claim Christianity, but yet be worldly
[50:59] at the same time. Have one foot in the
[51:01] church, one foot out in the world.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And so they wouldn't really be on fire
[51:08] for God. And so this is the challenge
[51:12] that we have being that it is the spirit
[51:15] of the age that we're living in
[51:18] is Satan would love to get us
[51:20] complacent. He would love to get us to
[51:22] where we're just mediocre Christians
[51:25] and, you know, and and to where church
[51:28] becomes more of an entertainment to us
[51:31] than anything else. And and we're not
[51:34] here to be entertained.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Uh God didn't call us or save us that we
[51:39] could be entertained and make a church
[51:42] uh a showmanship.
[51:45] Uh but he's called us that we could do
[51:48] something for him and to be the best and
[51:52] and that means putting our whole soul,
[51:56] mind, our heart, uh everything that we
[52:00] are into it. And we we should invest our
[52:04] strength, our energy, our time. We
[52:08] should invest everything that we have uh
[52:12] in into the kingdom of God. How many
[52:14] believes that?
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I look back at, you know, in
[52:19] the Bible and reading of the characters
[52:21] in the Bible and how they invested their
[52:24] time and their energy and you read the
[52:27] Fox's book of martyrs and uh other books
[52:30] of history of of the early church down
[52:32] through the ages and how they they took
[52:36] Christianity seriously.
[52:39] uh um they they were real Christians and
[52:43] they they gladly stood up for the cause
[52:46] of Christ. Ain't that right?
[52:49] &gt;&gt; But we think of this uh you know we we
[52:52] know that God wants to use the church.
[52:55] Uh the church is his body and so uh um
[53:01] uh we are his hands, we are his feet, we
[53:05] are his mouthpiece.
[53:07] Uh uh we are it. I mean you know as as
[53:11] we we know that uh you've not seen me.
[53:16] I've not seen you. You see my body.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; I'm living in my body.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; I and and you're living in your body.
[53:25] And so we fellowship through the body.
[53:28] We I'm able to speak through my body.
[53:31] I'm able to use my hands and and and
[53:34] these things. But when I leave, my body
[53:37] stays and it'll go in the ground. Uh
[53:40] unless I'm uh unless we, you know, uh
[53:44] are here when the rapture takes place.
[53:46] But if God were to take me home today, I
[53:49] would leave and and go into another body
[53:53] and yet the the this body would just be
[53:57] laying dormant and and would have to be
[53:59] buried. Uh so the body declares life. It
[54:03] declares my presence and and I know
[54:06] you're here because your body's here and
[54:10] and I I hear you sing and and see you
[54:13] moving and and so then then I know that
[54:17] you're you're living in that body. And
[54:20] so when the Bible says that we are the
[54:24] body of Jesus Christ, then we don't have
[54:28] to wonder where where he's at. If Christ
[54:31] can reflect himself through his body,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; And and and so uh God takes this body
[54:41] because he redeemed me. He takes your
[54:44] body because he redeemed you.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; He saved you. He He sanctified you. And
[54:50] then he fills you with the Holy Ghost,
[54:53] his own life, his own spirit. Ain't that
[54:56] right? Amen. and and he does that uh to
[54:59] do a work in you. And so now God's ways
[55:03] are totally opposite from man's ways.
[55:07] man, when he looks uh when he wants to
[55:11] use somebody um if if u if I'm going,
[55:15] you know, if I've got a job and and I'm
[55:19] and and I want to hire somebody uh to
[55:21] work for me and I want to use his his
[55:24] skills and all that, I want the best. I
[55:27] I I want the best that I can get. you
[55:30] know, I thinking of, you know, our
[55:31] president and uh uh you know, he's he's
[55:35] he wants the smartest, the brightest,
[55:37] you know, and that's all he hangs around
[55:39] with is is he loves smart people, you
[55:41] know, and he wants abled people and and
[55:44] if you're going to work for him, he he
[55:46] wants the best and and the most skilled
[55:49] and and the the most perfect uh that you
[55:53] can be. He demands that. He requires
[55:55] that. and and and well, we we should we
[55:59] we should want the best. If if you're
[56:01] going to hire someone, you're going to
[56:03] want someone to to really do the work,
[56:05] build your name up and build your your
[56:08] business up and and all of these things.
[56:11] But the when when God uses people, he
[56:15] goes opposite. It's it's kind of uh uh
[56:18] amazing, but he uses people that are
[56:23] full of weaknesses. Yes,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; he uses people that that aren't able.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He uses people that ain't really
[56:34] got the skill uh and and the ability and
[56:39] and and so uh you you would think that
[56:42] would be degrading on his name. You
[56:45] think it would be degrading on his part
[56:48] to to choose people that have no ability
[56:53] that that are in their weak weaknesses
[56:57] and and all of that. So I want to say
[57:00] this. You don't have to pretend to be
[57:03] something great for the Lord.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have a great resume to
[57:08] be used of God.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't have to present your
[57:12] best in the in the sense of of of of a
[57:16] list of accomplishments that you've
[57:18] done. And and hopefully God will hire
[57:22] you. Hopefully God will use you for his
[57:25] kingdom. You don't have to have great
[57:27] credentials for God to use you. Uh the
[57:31] prophet said there's so many of us likes
[57:33] to testify or likes to think that we're
[57:36] insufficient and therefore we make that
[57:40] an excuse. Well, I have no education. I
[57:43] have no ability. I'm unable to do this
[57:46] or to do that. And if you keep that up
[57:48] and do that in that way, keep going like
[57:51] that, then you can't mount to anything.
[57:54] But the very thing that we make excuses
[57:56] by our weaknesses, God uses that to
[58:01] tackle the very job with. Tackle the job
[58:04] with. He waits for us to get to that
[58:08] condition so that he can use us. Can you
[58:11] say amen?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; See, we take the excuses and we say,
[58:15] "Well, I I I can't do this and I'm I'm
[58:18] insufficient and I'm this." And God
[58:21] takes that very thing to do the job
[58:25] with. Can you say amen?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; So it it's it's an opposite of of how
[58:29] that God works contrary uh to the way we
[58:33] do. We want to be our best. We want to
[58:36] we we go to school to achieve and to
[58:39] become smarter and and and and the more
[58:42] we know, Amen, the better job we have,
[58:44] the better income we can make and and
[58:47] all of these things. But when it comes
[58:49] to God, the weaker you are, the better.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; And and so one of the reasons why we we
[59:00] come to church is to learn our
[59:03] weaknesses.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Not learn our strengths, but learn our
[59:08] weaknesses.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; And and you know that that we the
[59:14] prophet said we come to learn our
[59:15] faults.
[59:17] Not not so we can be condemned but that
[59:20] we might know how to better ourselves.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; And sometimes our faults is our
[59:28] abilities.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes our faults is our own
[59:33] strengths.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Because we lean to ourselves.
[59:39] We lean to our own understanding.
[59:42] We lean to what we can do instead of
[59:46] letting God do the work.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; So we we find that uh uh if we come to
[59:55] church for any other reason than this,
[59:58] the prophet says, "I'm afraid we won't
[59:59] get too much out of coming to church. We
[1:00:02] must come to find our weaknesses,
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; find our bad places, and see how little
[1:00:09] we are and put our trust in somebody
[1:00:13] that's strong.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to take my time for a few
[1:00:18] minutes now. Now, he says, you know, I
[1:00:21] I'll admit that people study too much
[1:00:24] and try to go too far ahead and and try
[1:00:28] to think too hard and sometimes they
[1:00:30] have mental breakdowns and things on
[1:00:33] account of studying about the Lord. You
[1:00:35] see that all the time. You got so many
[1:00:37] books out there and and uh written and
[1:00:40] commentaries and and different ideas of
[1:00:43] uh people they spend a lifetime trying
[1:00:47] to study about God, get to know more
[1:00:50] about God and and yet it does not bring
[1:00:53] them to more of a reality to God.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a knowledge of God.
[1:00:59] Ain't that right?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And and so he he says now he said, "But
[1:01:04] you must quit that. You don't have to do
[1:01:07] that. The only thing you have to do is
[1:01:09] fall in love with him and just go right
[1:01:13] on loving him. Ain't that right? It's
[1:01:16] not trying to push into something or
[1:01:20] make yourself something that you're not.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Remember, we talked about being
[1:01:24] impersonated. We don't want to be
[1:01:25] impersonators. We don't want to claim
[1:01:28] something that we're not. Can you say
[1:01:30] amen? Amen. Uh uh so it's not trying to
[1:01:34] make yourself self something you're not.
[1:01:37] Just go ahead and let God use you the
[1:01:41] way he wants to use you.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Just yield yourself.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Just yield yourself.
[1:01:51] See, commit yourself. Walk on happy,
[1:01:55] singing, rejoicing. Can you say amen?
[1:01:59] So, it's not trying to learn about God.
[1:02:01] It's not PUSHING OURSELVES INTO
[1:02:03] SOMETHING that we're not. Just let go
[1:02:06] and let God.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Now, God uh chooses us because we are
[1:02:15] not not because we're strong, but
[1:02:18] because we're in a condition of
[1:02:20] weakness.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; We don't like weakness. Man don't like
[1:02:23] weakness. We try to cover up our
[1:02:25] weaknesses. If there's anything, we're
[1:02:27] going to show our strengths, not our
[1:02:28] weaknesses.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We we'll go hide
[1:02:32] somewhere and and and show our
[1:02:34] weaknesses there when no one's around.
[1:02:36] But when we're around, we want to be
[1:02:38] bad, you know, tough and and strong and
[1:02:41] and all of these things. See, BUT GOD
[1:02:45] TAKES our weaknesses and and you'll see
[1:02:48] that throughout the Bible. Amen. We find
[1:02:51] people who are the weakest and the
[1:02:54] rejected by the outside world. And yet
[1:02:58] they're God's heroes.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; People that are weak, people that are
[1:03:04] rejected by the world, they are God's
[1:03:07] heroes that conquer up in the front line
[1:03:11] takes those who uh feel themselves
[1:03:14] unworthy. Ain't that right? So then why
[1:03:17] would God take a man that is is weak and
[1:03:22] and uh um
[1:03:26] DOESN'T REQUIRE ability from a man is
[1:03:30] because he God says it and I believe
[1:03:33] Isaiah that he says I will share my
[1:03:36] glory with no man.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; God ain't going to share his glory with
[1:03:40] us.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I God didn't choose me to preach
[1:03:45] because I'm a talented preacher.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it. I I'd
[1:03:50] just be honest. I' I've thought of our
[1:03:52] prophet and and you know night after
[1:03:55] night that that uh you know he would
[1:03:59] stand there preaching and and there
[1:04:01] would be scholars and men of welllearned
[1:04:04] and and according you know when you
[1:04:07] compared the prophet to to to
[1:04:11] these guys prophet wasn't much of a
[1:04:14] preacher you know he couldn't say
[1:04:16] eloquent words he he couldn't say things
[1:04:19] right And and even one of those scholars
[1:04:23] told him said, "You don't even know your
[1:04:24] Bible." You know, but one thing the
[1:04:27] reply was, "But I know the author."
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know the author. Ain't that
[1:04:32] right? Amen. And and I thought, you
[1:04:35] know, Brother Brandham actually built a
[1:04:37] complex and uh uh because of of him, you
[1:04:42] know, having to preach and his language
[1:04:46] wasn't good and his vocabulary and and
[1:04:49] here's all these men behind him and he's
[1:04:51] telling the people, he says, "I built
[1:04:53] the complex." He says, "I I DON'T
[1:04:55] UNDERSTAND WHY I'm here and and and and
[1:04:58] these things." But then he says, "But
[1:04:59] it's him.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; But it's him." AND THAT'S WHAT MADE HIS
[1:05:04] MINISTRY DIFFERENT WAS THERE WAS A
[1:05:06] PILLAR OF FIRE WITH HIM. THE PILLAR OF
[1:05:08] FIRE WAS WITH HIM VINDICATING everything
[1:05:12] that man said.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE ELOQUENT
[1:05:17] PREACHER. GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO have
[1:05:19] educated preacher. GOD WOULD TAKE A MAN
[1:05:22] that he could use and show his glory
[1:05:26] through.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, we think of that
[1:05:30] God knows how to get the job done. Do
[1:05:32] you believe that? Amen. If God's called
[1:05:35] you, he knows what he's doing. And if
[1:05:38] he's called you for a task, he knows how
[1:05:41] to get the job done.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. If he's
[1:05:45] called you to raise your children in
[1:05:47] this age and and and and raise them to
[1:05:49] the fear of the Lord, he knows what he's
[1:05:52] doing
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; and he knows HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE.
[1:05:55] AMEN.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES us parents are our backs are
[1:05:58] against the wall. We, you know, we we we
[1:06:01] uh uh don't know what to do. We don't
[1:06:03] have answers for everything. And and the
[1:06:06] things that we thought was good, WE FIND
[1:06:08] OUT IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD. And and and
[1:06:10] we're trying. It's just kind of amazed
[1:06:12] because they don't have textbooks for
[1:06:13] children, you know, AND AND EVERY CHILD
[1:06:15] IS DIFFERENT AND THINGS COME UP AND
[1:06:17] BUMPS ALONG the road and all of that.
[1:06:20] Amen. But what we count upon is not our
[1:06:23] own ability, but we rest in his ability.
[1:06:28] He knows how to get the job done. HE
[1:06:31] KNOWS HOW TO GET US THROUGH THIS MAZE.
[1:06:33] HE KNOWS HOW HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.
[1:06:36] CAN YOU say amen?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. See, and so he's
[1:06:40] able. Not only does he know how to get
[1:06:42] the job done, he's able to get the job
[1:06:45] done.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So then God just needs
[1:06:49] a body to work through.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; GOD JUST NEEDS A BODY. AMEN. I I want
[1:06:56] God to use my body.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's what he wants. He just
[1:07:01] needs a body to work through. He doesn't
[1:07:03] need us to tell him how to do it.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; He He doesn't need us to educate him.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? SOMETIME WE CAN GET SO
[1:07:14] CHURCHY and so THAT WE KNOW MORE ABOUT
[1:07:16] IT THAN GOD DOES.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, WELL, we He doesn't want us for
[1:07:20] that.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; He wants us that we could you he could
[1:07:24] use us.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Come on now, Lord.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; So, we find that the Bible tells us that
[1:07:31] each one of us are a vessel.
[1:07:34] We're considered to be vessels. Uh I I
[1:07:37] looked it up in in Webster dictionary.
[1:07:40] vessel is a container
[1:07:43] such as a cup,
[1:07:45] a bowl,
[1:07:47] uh uh some kind of a dish or a bottle or
[1:07:51] something and it's for holding
[1:07:53] something.
[1:07:54] See and and and then he goes on to say a
[1:07:57] person into whom now he's saying that
[1:07:59] the vessel is a person can be a person
[1:08:03] into whom uh some quality such as grace
[1:08:07] I put deity
[1:08:10] is infused
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; ain't that right
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; now now this was empty at one time
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; and THEN THEY PUT WATER in it
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; now AS LONG AS THIS IS EMPTY it does us
[1:08:22] no good
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; it's just going to sit in the shelf, BUT
[1:08:25] IT WAS FILLED WITH SOMETHING FOR a
[1:08:28] purpose
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; that I might use it.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; It's a vessel.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Something to be used for a purpose.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. WELL, GOD WOULD DESIGN man to be a
[1:08:46] vessel,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Not not not to be self-sufficient,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; right? I if IF YOU'RE NOT FILLED UP,
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIT on a shelf.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT A VESSEL IS A HUMAN. NOW, we
[1:09:05] talking ABOUT THE HUMAN VESSELS THAT
[1:09:07] SOMETHING CAN BE INFUSED,
[1:09:10] POURED INTO AND INFUSED.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; SO, the purpose of the vessel is to pour
[1:09:16] something in it and use it. Ain't that
[1:09:19] right? See, and it cannot be used unless
[1:09:23] there's something in it.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, uh, to get us to understand
[1:09:29] what we really are, God uses, you know,
[1:09:32] uh, different things to show us what we
[1:09:34] are, uh, like in our, in our opening
[1:09:37] scripture, he says, I am the br uh, the
[1:09:39] vine. You are the branch. Well, there's
[1:09:43] a reason he's telling us this. Because a
[1:09:46] branch can't bear fruit without the
[1:09:49] vine.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; The vine is the lifeline.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; The the life starts from the vine
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; and pours and flows through the branch.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; But the vine needs the branch because
[1:10:02] the vine cannot bear fruit without the
[1:10:05] branch. Can you say amen? So the vine,
[1:10:08] as long AS THE BRANCH IS ATTACHED to the
[1:10:11] vine, LIFE CAN FLOW THROUGH THAT branch
[1:10:14] and bring forth life that is in the
[1:10:17] vine.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? AMEN. SO YOU TAKE THAT
[1:10:21] BRANCH AND CUT IT OFF FROM THE VINE.
[1:10:23] AMEN. It ain't IT AIN'T SELF-SUFFICIENT.
[1:10:26] GOD DIDN'T MAKE THAT BRANCH
[1:10:28] SELF-SUFFICIENT. That branch NEEDS TO BE
[1:10:30] ATTACHED TO THE VINE.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; IF IT'S NOT ATTACHED TO THE VINE, IT'LL
[1:10:34] DIE UP AND ROT. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AND
[1:10:38] THAT'S WHAT JESUS IS TELLING US. AMEN.
[1:10:40] That if you're not attached to me,
[1:10:42] YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND DRY UP. FOR
[1:10:45] WITHOUT ME, YOU CAN DO NOTHING. YOU CAN
[1:10:49] PREACH, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED TO
[1:10:51] ME, IT'S NOTHING. YOU CAN SING, YOU CAN
[1:10:53] PLAY THE MUSIC, YOU CAN CLAIM
[1:10:55] CHRISTIANITY, YOU CAN DO ALL OF THOSE
[1:10:57] THINGS, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED TO
[1:10:59] ME, YOU'RE NOTHING.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; For sure. Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:11:06] That's right.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says the vine with all
[1:11:10] its energy cannot produce anything
[1:11:13] unless the branch is willing to receive
[1:11:15] the energy.
[1:11:16] Now God is depending on you as a member
[1:11:20] of his body to bear fruit of his spirit.
[1:11:24] Now, if he's dependent on you, let's
[1:11:27] open up our channels and let the Holy
[1:11:30] Spirit come in tonight and energize us
[1:11:34] and free us from all these fears and
[1:11:36] doubts.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? AS THE LIFE OF CHRIST
[1:11:41] just trying to pour itself into us,
[1:11:44] LET'S OPEN UP OUR CHANNELS. GOD, FREE US
[1:11:47] FROM ANY DOUBT THAT WOULD HINDER THAT
[1:11:50] LIFE FROM FUNCTIONING IN US. Can you say
[1:11:54] amen? BECAUSE WE FIND OUT THAT THE
[1:11:56] BRANCH IS A BELIEVER.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Not an unbeliever.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Jesus went and done
[1:12:05] miracles in his own town. And he did not
[1:12:08] one miracle because of the unbelief of
[1:12:10] the people. Amen. And no matter how much
[1:12:13] power is in the vine, no matter how much
[1:12:15] energy is in that vine, and no matter
[1:12:18] HOW MUCH LIFE IS IN THAT VINE, if the if
[1:12:21] if if the branch is an unbeliever, amen,
[1:12:24] THEN THE LIFE CAN'T FLOW, GOD CAN'T
[1:12:28] BRING HIS POWER AND MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN.
[1:12:31] Can you say amen? It takes a believer.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; SO GOD, TAKE ALL DOUBTS AWAY FROM US.
[1:12:38] TAKE TAKE ALL FEAR AWAY FROM US. TAKE
[1:12:42] ALL SKEPTICISM AWAY FROM US THAT we can
[1:12:45] open up our channel
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; and let you flow through.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; the Bible tells us that men again
[1:12:58] humanity are vessels but not all are the
[1:13:03] same kind of vessel.
[1:13:06] Not all are used for the same purpose.
[1:13:09] So I want to read a scripture Romans
[1:13:11] 9:22.
[1:13:13] It says, "What if God willing to show
[1:13:16] his wrath and to make his power known
[1:13:19] endured with much longsuffering
[1:13:22] the vessels of wrath fitted to
[1:13:25] destruction."
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So there's vessels that Paul would say
[1:13:30] they're vessels of wrath and they're
[1:13:33] fitted to destruction.
[1:13:35] Then 23rd verse. And that he might make
[1:13:38] known the riches of his glory, not on
[1:13:43] the vessels of wrath, but on the vessels
[1:13:46] of what?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Mercy,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; which he had all for prepared unto
[1:13:52] glory.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just don't want to be a
[1:13:55] vessel. Amen. But there's vessels of
[1:13:58] wrath. Amen. That are fitted to
[1:14:00] destruction and they're being used in
[1:14:02] their own way. Amen. But then there's
[1:14:05] vessels of mercy. God makes known his
[1:14:08] glory. Amen. And these vessels were
[1:14:12] prepared before the foundation of the
[1:14:14] world. Amen. In another place, the Bible
[1:14:17] tells us that there are vessels of honor
[1:14:20] and there's vessels of dishonor. Amen.
[1:14:23] Vessels of wrath, vessels of dishonor,
[1:14:26] vessels of mercy, vessels of honor. Can
[1:14:29] you say amen? See, and each of these
[1:14:32] vessels are filled with uh uh uh
[1:14:36] something different from the other. Like
[1:14:38] in Romans uh 1:29, Paul talked of a
[1:14:41] people being filled. Everybody say
[1:14:44] filled with all unrighteousness,
[1:14:47] fornication,
[1:14:48] wickedness, covetedness, uh
[1:14:51] maliciousness, full of envy, murder,
[1:14:54] debate, deceit, malign, whisperers.
[1:14:58] Ain't that right? Amen. See, so this
[1:15:01] this is what these vessels were filled
[1:15:03] with in in in indignation, wrath, and
[1:15:07] and fornication, and and all of THESE
[1:15:10] THINGS. NOTICE WHAT KIND OF VESSEL Judas
[1:15:12] was. Luke 22 and3 then entered Satan
[1:15:17] into Judas surnamed Iscar being the of
[1:15:22] the number of the 12 and he went his way
[1:15:25] and communed with the chief priests and
[1:15:27] captains how he might betray him Jesus
[1:15:31] unto them. See? Amen. So he was a
[1:15:34] vessel. Amen. But he was filled with
[1:15:37] Satan.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Satan entered into him. Can you say
[1:15:41] amen? What was he? a vessel of wrath, a
[1:15:44] a vessel of of of dishonor. Ain't that
[1:15:47] right? Luke 4 uh tells us that Jesus
[1:15:51] taught in the synagogue. And in the 28th
[1:15:54] verse, it says that and and and all they
[1:15:57] in that synagogue when they heard these
[1:16:00] things were filled with wrath. Not
[1:16:04] filled with repentance, not filled with
[1:16:07] agony, but filled with wrath. Synagogue
[1:16:10] back then is a church today. Amen. Uh we
[1:16:14] call it church. They called it
[1:16:15] synagogue. And all that were in that
[1:16:18] church in that synagogue when they heard
[1:16:21] HIS TEACHINGS, THEY ALL of a sudden were
[1:16:24] filled with wrath. What? Oh my. Amen.
[1:16:28] How how would God fill somebody with
[1:16:32] wrath when they're hearing the word of
[1:16:33] God? Well, God wouldn't DO THAT. AMEN.
[1:16:36] GOD WOULDN'T POUR WRATH INTO A VESSEL
[1:16:40] WHEN the word is coming forth and ALL
[1:16:42] THEY'RE FILLED WITH IS ANGER and wrath.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; So if you go to Acts 13:44,
[1:16:53] and the next Sabbath day came almost the
[1:16:56] whole city together to hear the word of
[1:16:58] God. And when the Jews saw the
[1:17:01] multitudes, they were filled with envy
[1:17:04] and spake against those things which
[1:17:06] were spoken by Paul contradicting and
[1:17:10] blaspheming. See, so these were vessels
[1:17:13] we could say of dishonor. Now the Bible
[1:17:16] tells of another people that on the day
[1:17:18] of Pentecost there was 120 gathered up
[1:17:21] in the upper room and when the Holy
[1:17:23] Ghost came they were all filled. Can you
[1:17:28] say amen? filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:31] Amen. Filled with THE HOLY GHOST. WHY?
[1:17:34] GOD FOUND VESSELS. GOD FOUND vessels
[1:17:38] that would open themselves up. Amen.
[1:17:41] Unto him. And they were praying. Oh God
[1:17:43] made the PROMISE COME. OH GOD, SEND US
[1:17:47] THE PROMISE. AMEN. AND THEY WERE VESSELS
[1:17:50] OPENING UP THEMSELVES TO HIS SPIRIT and
[1:17:53] he filled them.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul
[1:18:00] prays that the church might be filled
[1:18:04] with all the fullness of God.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 25, Jesus speaks of the 10
[1:18:12] virgins. There were five wise and five
[1:18:14] foolish.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; And he says that the five five wise took
[1:18:22] oil
[1:18:23] in their vessels.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. with their lamps.
[1:18:28] Now, we know this is speaking of this
[1:18:30] age
[1:18:32] that there are people that they were all
[1:18:34] virgins, clean, spotless,
[1:18:38] holy, of the same material,
[1:18:42] but there were virgins that did not put
[1:18:45] oil in themselves.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; But then there was the wise that had
[1:18:51] oil.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; They kept oil in their vessel. Yeah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; See? See? So vessels, vessels of honor.
[1:19:00] See, so we are made to be filled up
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; so that we can be used.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham praying. He says, "God,
[1:19:14] fill us with deity."
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Fill us with deity. fill us with power
[1:19:21] and energy until our souls are a flame.
[1:19:26] That our strength will be him, our
[1:19:29] testimony will be God, our words will be
[1:19:33] his, then devils will tremble.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; The world will shake and rock under the
[1:19:39] impact of it. Lord, can you say amen?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I think that should be the prayer of all
[1:19:45] of us today is God fill US WITH DEITY.
[1:19:49] FILL US WITH THY POWER.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; FILL US WITH THY WORDS THAT WHEN WE
[1:19:53] SPEAK IT'S YOUR WORDS.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; FILL US WITH THY ENERGY THAT WHEN WE
[1:19:58] MOVE IT'S IT'S YOUR ENERGY.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? FILL US WITH YOURSELF
[1:20:04] THAT OUR ATTITUDE IS YOUR ATTITUDE. OUR
[1:20:06] MOTIVE IS YOUR MOTIVE.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; So fill us Lord.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You see in another place he said breathe
[1:20:16] on us Lord. fill us with the oxygen of
[1:20:19] the word in the power of his
[1:20:21] resurrection so that we can stay alive
[1:20:23] in this last wicked day. You think of
[1:20:27] it, that's a prayer now because we're
[1:20:30] living in a time when the death angel is
[1:20:32] coming just as it was in the first
[1:20:33] Exodus where the death angel, God says,
[1:20:36] "When I see the blood, I'll pass over
[1:20:38] you." If there was no blood on that
[1:20:40] home, death struck.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And in this age, so is it. The death
[1:20:45] angel is coming. Amen. It's going
[1:20:47] throughout the land and people are
[1:20:49] spiritually dying. The revivals of what
[1:20:52] used to be. Amen. What Luther stood for
[1:20:56] in his day, the Lutheran do no longer
[1:20:58] stand for in that day. What Wesley stood
[1:21:01] for in his day, the Wesleyans no longer
[1:21:03] stand for that. Amen. The power of God
[1:21:06] that moved. Amen. These denominations
[1:21:08] are drying up and church people are
[1:21:10] drying up. You can go to church and be
[1:21:12] dead. Amen. dried up without a spiritual
[1:21:15] uh uh experience with God, without any
[1:21:18] kind of relationship.
[1:21:20] We don't want to come to church and not
[1:21:23] have a relationship WITH GOD. WE DON'T
[1:21:26] WANT TO RAISE CHILDREN WITHOUT
[1:21:28] RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. WE DON'T WANT TO
[1:21:31] PROCLAIM CHRISTIANITY WITHOUT KNOWING
[1:21:34] THE SUPERNATURAL POWER AND EXPERIENCING
[1:21:37] THE SUPERNATURAL. I SAY, GOD, FILL US
[1:21:40] UP. BREATHE INTO US A BREATH OF OXYGEN
[1:21:44] OF YOUR WORD that we may stay alive.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Not a form of godliness and deny THE
[1:21:52] POWER THEREOF. GIVE US THAT POWER.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Fill us up.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Fill us, Lord.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You see, God wants to fill us with
[1:22:05] himself.
[1:22:07] It doesn't matter how perfect the vessel
[1:22:09] is. That's right.
[1:22:14] The question is is what
[1:22:17] is this vessel filled with?
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a perfect vessel.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be just so perfectly
[1:22:26] formed. And you don't have to be an able
[1:22:28] vessel. You just need to be a open
[1:22:32] vessel.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Open to the right kind of things.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:40] You see, when the vessel is filled with
[1:22:43] God himself, then the shikina glory will
[1:22:46] return again to the house of the living
[1:22:48] God, which is the human body.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; See, that that that's what we want is we
[1:22:55] don't want the shakina glory leaving us.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Are are you with me?
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the shakana glory that we
[1:23:03] need. Remember when when in the Bible
[1:23:06] when when that when that rod Amen. and
[1:23:09] Aaron's rod. Amen. It It was almond rod,
[1:23:13] I believe. But it was dead. It It was
[1:23:15] detached. IT WAS NO LIFE IN IT. BUT WHEN
[1:23:19] IT COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF SHAKINA
[1:23:22] GLORY. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THAT
[1:23:25] ROD BUDDED. IT BROUGHT FORTH. CAN YOU
[1:23:28] SAY AMEN? What we need in OUR LIVES IS
[1:23:32] THE SHAKINA GLORY. AMEN. I DON'T WANT TO
[1:23:36] JUST read about him. I DON'T WANT TO
[1:23:38] JUST TALK ABOUT HIM. I WANT THAT SHAKINA
[1:23:41] GLORY TO COME INTO ME and cause my life
[1:23:44] to bud.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; You can know what God has done in this
[1:23:52] day. You can even believe in what God
[1:23:53] has done in this day. But if you're
[1:23:55] detached from the shakina glory,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; it doesn't do you any good.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That is true. You see, we desperately
[1:24:07] need the shikana glory in our lives or
[1:24:09] we will desperately fail.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; We'll miserably fail. Do you believe
[1:24:15] that?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Now notice,
[1:24:18] I hope this all right this morning.
[1:24:21] Acts 19:11,
[1:24:26] it says, "And God wrought special
[1:24:28] miracles by the hands of Paul,
[1:24:32] so that from his body were brought unto
[1:24:34] the sick handkerchiefs and aprons,
[1:24:38] and the diseases departed from them,
[1:24:41] and the evil spirits went out of them."
[1:24:45] Then
[1:24:47] certain of the vagabond Jews, exor
[1:24:50] exorcists,
[1:24:52] took upon them to call over them which
[1:24:56] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[1:24:59] Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus
[1:25:02] whom Paul preacheth."
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Now, it tells you right then, they
[1:25:06] didn't know Jesus for himself.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; They were only quoting what Paul
[1:25:10] preached.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; They were only saying Jesus whom Paul
[1:25:14] preaches. So it tells you they didn't
[1:25:16] know the Jesus that Paul preached.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And yet they were wanting to do what
[1:25:20] Paul was doing.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; And they thought well they looked at
[1:25:24] Paul working miracles and all that. They
[1:25:27] thought that was just Paul. So so let's
[1:25:29] just do it. We'll we'll do it ourselves,
[1:25:31] you know. And and so and and he says uh
[1:25:34] um
[1:25:36] we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul
[1:25:38] preaches and and there were seven sons
[1:25:41] of onekeva
[1:25:43] a Jew and chief of the priest which did
[1:25:46] so. And the evil spirit answered and
[1:25:49] said, "Jesus I know and Paul I know, but
[1:25:53] who are you?"
[1:25:56] And the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:25:59] leaped on them, overcame them, prevailed
[1:26:03] against them, so that they fled out of
[1:26:05] that house naked and wounded. Can you
[1:26:08] say amen?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Notice the difference between Paul and
[1:26:12] the seven sons ofKeva.
[1:26:15] See, now Acts 13:9 tells us that Paul
[1:26:21] was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say that with me? Paul was
[1:26:25] filled
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; He He wasn't filled with entertainment.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't filled with anger. He wasn't
[1:26:34] filled with doubt. He was a vessel
[1:26:37] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And back into the scripture that we just
[1:26:44] read. And God wrought special miracles
[1:26:47] by the hands of Paul.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; This wasn't Paul doing this. God was
[1:26:53] doing it.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Paul was just a vessel.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; So God performed the hands miracles from
[1:27:04] the hands of Paul. Whereas these seven
[1:27:07] sons were out on their own trying to do
[1:27:10] what Paul was doing.
[1:27:13] Paul was doing the work of the Lord by
[1:27:16] the spirit of God dwelling in him.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; You see, it's going to take the
[1:27:24] supernatural to do the work of the Lord.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not I'm not saying, you know,
[1:27:33] uh I I believe if God's called a man to
[1:27:36] do something, God equips that man. Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He equips him with the talent to to
[1:27:44] um to do to do what he's able to do. Uh
[1:27:49] thinking of brother Kevin uh such a
[1:27:52] guitar player. Well, God gave him that
[1:27:55] talent,
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And and God gives you talent to sing.
[1:28:02] God gives you talent to preach. God
[1:28:05] gives you gifts and and these things,
[1:28:08] but
[1:28:10] it takes the supernatural,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Kevin could be out just like so
[1:28:21] many others. Ched Atkins and well, I
[1:28:25] don't know too many of them out there
[1:28:28] that could take his gift, his talent,
[1:28:32] and play out for the world.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:28:35] They're they're good.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; There's guys out there that's playing in
[1:28:38] the honky tonks and all that. Just good
[1:28:40] guitarists,
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; And and there's some of them if you paid
[1:28:47] them maybe good money, they would come
[1:28:49] in the church and play,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; same talent,
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; same everything.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; But what would be the difference?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It would be a vessel
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; that is anointed of God
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; that when he gets UP AND PLAYS THE THE
[1:29:05] the the uh the guitar, Sister Rihanna,
[1:29:09] Ryanna playing the piano, I tell him the
[1:29:11] other night, I said, you know, uh uh you
[1:29:14] guys are just good.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; NOT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE JUST able to
[1:29:19] do something, but they're anointed when
[1:29:21] they play.
[1:29:23] JUST A SPIRIT OF GOD JUST IN THEIR
[1:29:26] MUSIC. WHY? IT'S A VESSEL
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; THAT HAS SURRENDERED to God.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; See, so we find that
[1:29:44] it's going to take something
[1:29:46] supernatural because as the Bible says,
[1:29:48] we're not wrestling against flesh and
[1:29:50] blood.
[1:29:52] You believe that
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; we're not wrestling. Spirits coming up
[1:29:56] against us all the time.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Spirits are working on people all the
[1:30:01] time. Sure.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; And and Brother Brown would call them
[1:30:04] precious people.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; People that ain't recognizing the spirit
[1:30:09] that is trying to to to war against
[1:30:12] them.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:30:17] It it it it is it isn't the person that
[1:30:20] causes havoc. It's it's not the person
[1:30:23] that's that it's it's a spirit that that
[1:30:26] causes disunityity. It's a spirit that
[1:30:29] brings division. IT'S THE SPIRIT THAT
[1:30:32] TRIES TO WRECK UP OUR FAMILY. It's a
[1:30:35] spirit that tries to it works AND THEN
[1:30:37] IT TRIES TO GET US to become bitter. IT
[1:30:40] TRIES TO GET US TO BECOME ANGRY. IT
[1:30:42] TRIES TO GET US TO TO FIGHT BACK. YES.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You understand WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S ALL
[1:30:48] A SPIRIT.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IS MOTIVATED BY A SPIRIT.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT SATAN DON'T REALIZE IS WE ARE
[1:30:59] NOT VESSELS OF DISHONOR.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; WE ARE VESSELS THAT HAVE BEEN DEDICATED
[1:31:05] UNTO GOD. REMEMBER there were vessels,
[1:31:08] amen, for the tabernacle THAT THAT GOD
[1:31:11] REQUIRED THEM VESSELS TO BE NOT USED FOR
[1:31:14] ANY OTHER thing than for his purpose.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? THEY WERE VESSELS UNTO
[1:31:21] THE LORD. They were considered holy
[1:31:23] vessels, not defiled vessels. AND YOU
[1:31:26] REMEMBER WHEN THAT OLD WICKED KING OF
[1:31:28] BABYLON TOOK GOD'S VESSELS AND BROUGHT
[1:31:31] THEM INTO HIS BANQUET OF CELEBRATION AND
[1:31:34] FILLED THEM WITH HIS WINE FOR HIS
[1:31:36] PURPOSE. THE HANDWRITING came on the
[1:31:38] wall AND HIS KINGDOM WAS FINISHED.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We are NOT VESSELS OF
[1:31:46] WRATH. WE ARE NOT VESSELS OF DISHONOR.
[1:31:50] AMEN. THEREFORE, WE GUARD OURSELVES. UH
[1:31:54] AMEN. SATAN, you cannot use us. Uh,
[1:31:56] SATAN, YOU CANNOT DEFILE US. UH, SATAN,
[1:31:59] WE ARE SOLD OUT TO GOD. WE HAVE BEEN
[1:32:02] DEDICATED UNTO GOD.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; We're not wrestling against flesh and
[1:32:11] blood.
[1:32:13] that Paul would tell us, we're wrestling
[1:32:15] against principalities, against powers,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; against the rulers of darkness of this
[1:32:22] world, against prince uh spiritual
[1:32:24] wickedness in high places.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Therefore, Paul would tell us the
[1:32:28] weapons of our warfare are not carnal.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It ain't with this fist. It ain't with a
[1:32:33] gun.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It ain't with words of of anger.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; It's not with the lawyer. IT'S NOT WITH
[1:32:39] WITH WHATEVER.
[1:32:42] AMEN.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; THE WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE ARE NOT
[1:32:46] CARNAL,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; but they are mighty through GOD TO THE
[1:32:50] PULLING DOWN of every stronghold.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; The armor that we must have on is
[1:32:56] supernatural.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; I pray this makes sense to you today.
[1:33:03] Lord,
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; the man, the woman, the girl, the boy
[1:33:08] that God uses is just a natural vessel,
[1:33:13] natural human
[1:33:16] with frailties,
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; disappointments,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; weaknesses,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; mistakes,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; complexes,
[1:33:30] perplexed at times, distressed at times.
[1:33:35] They feel the effects of of things in
[1:33:37] the world.
[1:33:41] And and yet God doesn't need our natural
[1:33:47] ability.
[1:33:49] God doesn't need us to feel perfect for
[1:33:51] him to use us.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you, God doesn't
[1:33:55] even need you to feel saved
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; as long as you are saved.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; God can use you when you don't even feel
[1:34:04] like you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; As long as you know you got it.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; God can use a preacher when he don't
[1:34:12] feel like he's a preacher.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; That's the way he wants it, don't he?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; God can take a Christian when he don't
[1:34:21] feel like he's a Christian and use him.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; See, it's not how we feel.
[1:34:28] It's not how we are.
[1:34:31] We are just his vessel that he's filled
[1:34:34] up.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't need our natural ability.
[1:34:41] Man
[1:34:43] always wants to lead
[1:34:47] or lend to God his ability and what he
[1:34:51] can do.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I won't take much longer. But Moses
[1:34:57] did that. He saw the need of the day.
[1:35:01] Prophet said he was a smart man. He was
[1:35:03] the coming Pharaoh. He had psychology.
[1:35:05] He had power. He had physical strength.
[1:35:08] He had everything. So he said, "Well,
[1:35:10] I'm equipped. I know all of it.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And if there's a man in the land that's
[1:35:14] able to do it,
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; So I'm the man of the hour. So I'll step
[1:35:20] out." And he went out to accomplish a
[1:35:22] work that was right.
[1:35:24] a work that was right that God had
[1:35:27] called him to do
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; and in the will of God.
[1:35:35] See, he he accomplished a work that was
[1:35:37] right and in the will of God and he
[1:35:40] offered his natural abilities and God
[1:35:42] refused it
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; because God could not use one thing that
[1:35:48] Moses had to offer.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; So because even though he was he was in
[1:35:59] the will of God as far as doing what God
[1:36:01] had called him to do, he was raised up
[1:36:03] for this purpose was to lead the people
[1:36:05] out,
[1:36:07] but because he was trying in his own
[1:36:09] ability, he failed miserably. And the
[1:36:11] only thing he ended up with was a dead
[1:36:13] Egyptian.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:36:19] So then we find that God had to take him
[1:36:21] out into the desert for 40 years
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; to get all of his knowledge out.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; To strip him of his will, to strip him
[1:36:31] of his ability, to strip him of his
[1:36:33] knowhow, to strip him of his want to, to
[1:36:37] strip him of everything,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; his theology, his ambition.
[1:36:44] Can you say amen?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Paul was the same way. God took him out
[1:36:48] in the desert
[1:36:50] to strip him of his own abilities, his
[1:36:53] own will, his education,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; his ambitions, everything to where Paul
[1:36:59] became a nobody.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Look at Paul. He was a well-learned man.
[1:37:06] He was a scholar. Could speak any near
[1:37:08] any language there was in the world at
[1:37:11] that time. He was a well-trained in
[1:37:13] psychology. He was brought up under the
[1:37:15] strict sect of Pharisees. His father was
[1:37:18] a Pharisee. He was a Pharisee. And he
[1:37:20] was the strictest of Pharisees. He had
[1:37:23] great authority. In Philippians 3 and 7,
[1:37:27] Paul says, "But what things were gained
[1:37:29] to me, I COUNTED LOSS FOR CHRIST."
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; NOW, before he got converted, he wasn't
[1:37:35] willing to lay down everything down.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he WAS USING TO WORK FOR
[1:37:40] GOD.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DIDN'T NEED THAT.
[1:37:44] AMEN.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING GOD A SERVICE.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU CAN USE ME. I'M TALENTED. I'M
[1:37:52] KNOWLEDGEABLE. I was reared up in
[1:37:53] education. I'M THE STRICTEST OF THEM
[1:37:55] ALL. ACCORD CONCERNING THE LAW, I'M
[1:37:58] BLAMELESS.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; AND NONE OF THAT MATTERED.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; That's good. HE SAID, "YAY, DOUBTLESS
[1:38:06] AND I count all things but loss for the
[1:38:09] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[1:38:11] Jesus my Lord, for whom I HAVE SUFFERED
[1:38:15] THE LOSS OF ALL THINGS,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; and do count them but dung that I may
[1:38:21] win Christ
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; and be found in him, not having my own
[1:38:26] righteousness, which is of the law, but
[1:38:28] that which is through the faith of
[1:38:30] Christ, the righteousness which is of
[1:38:33] God by faith." Good.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; So, he had to forget how strong and how
[1:38:37] great he was.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; He had to realize that he could not
[1:38:42] depend on himself. He had to forget all
[1:38:45] the training that he had.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Now, notice
[1:38:49] God got Paul to a a a a a place that he
[1:38:53] could use him. Notice the the place that
[1:38:55] Paul, this educated scholar, this this
[1:38:59] wellrefined man
[1:39:01] in 1 Corinthians 2 and one. And I,
[1:39:04] brethren, when I came to you came not
[1:39:07] with excellency of speech or wisdom.
[1:39:11] Whoa, that's that's not the the the Paul
[1:39:14] that we knew in the beginning.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; The saw
[1:39:18] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[1:39:21] For I determined not to know anything
[1:39:23] among you, say Jesus Christ, and him
[1:39:25] crucified.
[1:39:27] And I was with you in weakness,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; and in fear,
[1:39:33] and in much trembling.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And my speech, and my preaching was not
[1:39:39] with enticing words of men, wisdom, but
[1:39:42] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:39:44] power, that your faith should not stand
[1:39:47] in the wisdom of men, but in the power
[1:39:50] of God. Amen.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Prophet said he didn't want to know
[1:39:53] their abilities because he knew there
[1:39:55] was nothing in them.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; That's why church, we're we're all in
[1:40:02] the same boat. The older I get and and
[1:40:04] and the Lord, you know, the more
[1:40:07] schooling I get, I realize I'm nothing.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; But I look at a people who's nothing.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I I I I don't expect it from you. It's
[1:40:16] got to take God.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It It takes God to do
[1:40:22] it. It takes GOD FOR ME TO STAND up here
[1:40:24] to preach. It takes God FOR YOU TO TO DO
[1:40:26] WHAT YOU'RE doing in the kingdom of God.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to know their abilities
[1:40:35] because he knew that there was nothing
[1:40:36] in them. He had determined to only
[1:40:38] recognize the crucified savior among
[1:40:41] them. Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, I WAS WITH YOU IN WEAKNESS.
[1:40:45] NOT IN GREATNESS AND PIETY.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Not in strength.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I was with you in weakness and in fear
[1:40:55] and in much trembling. This was a man
[1:40:58] who had turned the world upside down.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; This was a man of great ministry and
[1:41:05] authority and God done many things in
[1:41:08] his life. And here he was confessing
[1:41:11] that he had come in weakness and not as
[1:41:13] a trained scholar. He came in fear, the
[1:41:16] prophet said, lest he would step off the
[1:41:18] path somewhere. It wasn't that he was
[1:41:21] scared of anything. He was just scared
[1:41:23] that he would displease God in some way
[1:41:25] and that he would get his own ability
[1:41:27] mixed into it.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET SOMETHING THAT HE
[1:41:32] HAD learned and give it to the people.
[1:41:34] And he came in much trembling because he
[1:41:38] could not trust in his own ability.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "If there's anything
[1:41:48] that our schools need today, if it's
[1:41:50] anything our churches need today, is a
[1:41:53] stripping of themselves of your own
[1:41:55] thoughts and your own abilities. Strip
[1:41:58] yourselves before God unless you would
[1:42:00] try to do something within yourself."
[1:42:03] He said, "You've got to become a
[1:42:04] nothing, not a know-it-all, not a great
[1:42:07] somebody, but a nobody.
[1:42:10] You got to come to dust.
[1:42:12] You got to get to a place that you know
[1:42:15] that you're nothing. And don't ever rise
[1:42:18] above that. For as soon as you rise
[1:42:20] above it, you rise above God. You've got
[1:42:23] to keep yourself in the dust and on the
[1:42:25] road to Damascus. You You got to keep
[1:42:28] yourself off your high horse."
[1:42:30] Yeah.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you notice in the Bible,
[1:42:33] it's always those who are trying to get
[1:42:34] away from it that God uses."
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Not men that say, "Well, I can do it. I
[1:42:40] can do it. You need me." But it's men
[1:42:43] that says, "Oh, no. I I'm not fit for
[1:42:44] the job. I I can't do it. I'm I'm not
[1:42:46] able to do it." And as long as man wants
[1:42:49] to do something and thinks he's got the
[1:42:51] ability, he can put the job over. God
[1:42:54] can never use that man.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Man, look at Moses
[1:42:59] running. Look at Paul running and the
[1:43:01] rest of them trying to get away from it.
[1:43:04] Another place he says, notice it takes
[1:43:06] the weakness and the rejected, the
[1:43:08] weakest and the rejected. And
[1:43:10] practically every hero God ever had on
[1:43:14] the front line was that type of person.
[1:43:17] A person that was rejected, a person
[1:43:19] that thought he was insufficient, a
[1:43:22] person that had no ability at all, then
[1:43:24] that person's just in good shape. so God
[1:43:28] can start using them.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T AND
[1:43:32] they ain't got nothing, THAT'S WHEN GOD
[1:43:34] CAN TAKE A HOLD of them and do something
[1:43:36] with them.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; But when we think that we're able to do
[1:43:39] it, then God can't use us because we're
[1:43:41] wanting to do it ourselves.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; He says, then the other side, we get
[1:43:50] these feelings
[1:43:52] and we think then that we're
[1:43:54] insufficient and we don't want to do it.
[1:43:57] than if we just listen to the call of
[1:43:59] God. That's the very thing that God
[1:44:00] wants us to get into that kind of a
[1:44:03] shape. So he can when we are in
[1:44:06] sufficient ourselves then we are
[1:44:08] subjects to yield to God's spirit. As
[1:44:11] long as we think that we can do it then
[1:44:13] we can't do it. But when we get to a
[1:44:15] place where we know amen that we can't
[1:44:18] do it then we yield oursel to God and he
[1:44:21] does it. So then IF IT'S US TRYING to do
[1:44:24] it we'll fail. BUT IF WE'LL JUST YIELD
[1:44:27] OURSELVES TO GOD, THEN GOD CAN'T FAIL.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that God cannot
[1:44:35] do, and that's fail. He can do anything
[1:44:37] else but fail. He cannot fail. So, as
[1:44:39] long as we're trying in ourselves and
[1:44:41] depending on our own ability and so
[1:44:43] forth, while we'll do nothing, but when
[1:44:46] we get to a place where we know we're
[1:44:48] nothing, then God can use us.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's one of the most
[1:44:52] important things that we must master."
[1:44:54] Remember he said especially you young
[1:44:56] ministers and lay members alike one
[1:44:58] thing that we've got to master if we
[1:45:00] expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[1:45:03] life that is we have to master the
[1:45:05] thought of human ability. If we ever get
[1:45:08] to a spot where we think that we can do
[1:45:10] it with our own intelligence and our own
[1:45:12] abilities. We've got to master that in
[1:45:14] such a way that we can get rid of the
[1:45:16] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[1:45:20] use us.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; So then it tells us that everything that
[1:45:25] we are has to be surrendered to God. And
[1:45:28] it may not be much.
[1:45:31] It may not. You look in the Bible of the
[1:45:35] the woman
[1:45:37] when Elijah
[1:45:40] uh called drought upon the earth, he
[1:45:41] said it wouldn't rain for three and a
[1:45:43] half years except at his word.
[1:45:46] And he was sent down to
[1:45:49] a widow woman of Zerapath. And this
[1:45:53] woman's husband had died. He had been a
[1:45:55] real godly man. She was left with a
[1:45:57] child.
[1:46:00] There was death all around. Nobody had
[1:46:02] anything.
[1:46:04] She She only had just a little. The
[1:46:06] Bible says she just had a little meal.
[1:46:08] That's it.
[1:46:10] And she says, "I'm I'm going to prepare
[1:46:12] this meal.
[1:46:14] Just one last. I'm going to prepare it.
[1:46:17] Then me and my son's going to die
[1:46:19] because that's all." She couldn't go
[1:46:20] borrow cuz no one had anything.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; She had come to her weakest point.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; TO WHERE SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO OFFER.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And as she was on her way to get the
[1:46:40] sticks or to prepare, she hears a voice
[1:46:44] say, "Bake me a cake first."
[1:46:48] She turned around and there's a prophet
[1:46:50] Elijah.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Make me the cake first.
[1:46:58] If you'll do this,
[1:47:01] the mailbarrow will never run dry. Yours
[1:47:04] of oil will never run dry.
[1:47:07] Lord,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; it'll last you. It'll sustain you.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And at the words of a prophet, she
[1:47:14] yielded what she had. to the Lord.
[1:47:19] She recognized that this man wasn't just
[1:47:21] an average man. This was a prophet that
[1:47:23] carried the words of God
[1:47:28] and she built it and she did
[1:47:30] accordingly.
[1:47:31] And when she surrendered what little she
[1:47:33] had to God, God blessed it.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; And he kept using it and using it and
[1:47:39] using it. God sustained her.
[1:47:44] Take the other little woman that had
[1:47:46] sons and there she was in debt and her
[1:47:50] her husband had died and she was getting
[1:47:54] her son's going to be sold taken into
[1:47:57] slavery and she ran to the prophet of
[1:47:58] God.
[1:48:01] And the prophet asked her says, "Well,
[1:48:02] what do you have in your house?" She
[1:48:04] says, "All only I've got is just a
[1:48:06] vessel, a vessel full of oil. That's all
[1:48:09] I got. Just a little vessel of oil."
[1:48:12] He says, "You go borrow from the
[1:48:14] neighbors. You go to the neighbor's
[1:48:15] house and you take all the vessels
[1:48:16] they've got and you bring it into your
[1:48:19] home."
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; And you take from that vessel and just
[1:48:24] pour it into the other vessels. Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And as she began to pour
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; and it would look like what she little
[1:48:32] she had, she surrendered it to the words
[1:48:35] of a prophet
[1:48:37] to his message
[1:48:40] and she poured it. And when that vessel
[1:48:42] become full, she looked and the vessel
[1:48:45] was still full.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; THE VESSEL SHE POURED FROM WAS STILL
[1:48:49] FULL.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; AND SHE POURED IT INTO ANOTHER VESSEL
[1:48:52] AND IT WAS STILL FULL. SHE POURED IT
[1:48:55] INTO ANOTHER VESSEL AND IT WAS STILL
[1:48:57] FULL. SHE HAD SURRENDERED what little
[1:48:59] SHE HAD TO THE MESSAGE THAT A PROPHET
[1:49:02] HAD BROUGHT HER.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, God gave us a message.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Surrender what little you have to him.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Surrender what little you have. You say,
[1:49:19] "Well, I I I'm not I'm just not good
[1:49:22] singer.
[1:49:23] I'm I'm not a good father. I'm not a
[1:49:25] good mother. I I'm I'm not a good
[1:49:28] whatever. You don't have to be.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, just surrender.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got much money. Well, take
[1:49:37] what little money you got and surrender
[1:49:38] it.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Just surrender everything that you are
[1:49:42] to the message that God has brought
[1:49:44] through a prophet in this age.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; And you find God start using you.
[1:49:52] You find that God starts pouring himself
[1:49:55] into you.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Pouring himself and pouring himself. Can
[1:50:00] you say amen?
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; God use us today.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; bless his holy name.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; I pray it was a help to you today.
[1:50:17] Doing our best for the Lord may not be
[1:50:19] much that we have to offer,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; but take everything that you got and
[1:50:26] surrender it to the Lord.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] You're not surrendering it to the world.
[1:50:36] You're not letting your vessel be filled
[1:50:38] up with trash.
[1:50:44] See, humans are like sponges.
[1:50:48] When we feed off of the things of the
[1:50:50] world,
[1:50:53] we start becoming that. It's
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; true.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Hanging around smoking and hanging
[1:51:01] around, you know, the ungodly believers
[1:51:05] and just we hanging around that stuff.
[1:51:08] Hanging around that. And what we're
[1:51:09] doing is we're soaking things up to our
[1:51:12] spirit. We're soaking up things
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; and it's taking us to where God can't
[1:51:17] fill us with his own glory. Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; But if we can stand here today
[1:51:23] and empty ourselves out, say, "God, I
[1:51:28] filled myself up
[1:51:31] with so much negativity, so much world
[1:51:36] that I just want to surrender it.
[1:51:41] I want to just empty myself out and let
[1:51:43] you just pour yourself into me."
[1:51:48] And if I'm full of you, then Satan can't
[1:51:50] pour in his bitterness. Satan can't pour
[1:51:52] in lust. Satan can't pour in anything.
[1:51:58] So God, fill me.
[1:52:01] Is that your desire today?
[1:52:04] Amen.
[1:52:10] in me.
[1:52:12] I give myself away.
[1:52:21] I give myself away
[1:52:24] so you
[1:52:26] can use me. I give myself away.
[1:52:36] I give myself away
[1:52:40] so you can use me. Here I am.
[1:52:48] Here I stand.
[1:52:52] Lord, my life
[1:52:56] is in your hand.
[1:53:00] Lord, I'm
[1:53:03] hoping to see
[1:53:07] your desires
[1:53:11] revealed in me.
[1:53:14] So I give myself away.
[1:53:19] Hallelujah.
[1:53:22] Oh, I give myself away
[1:53:26] so you can use me. I give myself away.
[1:53:36] Oh,
[1:53:38] I give myself away
[1:53:41] so you can use me. Take my heart.
[1:53:49] Take my life
[1:53:53] as a living
[1:53:57] sacrifice
[1:54:00] and all my dreams.
[1:54:04] All my plans,
[1:54:08] Lord, I place
[1:54:11] them in your hands.
[1:54:15] I give myself away.
[1:54:19] Sing it as a prayer to him.
[1:54:22] Oh, I give myself away
[1:54:26] so you can use me. I give myself away.
[1:54:38] I give myself away.
[1:54:42] So you sing it again. Oh, I give myself
[1:54:47] away.
[1:54:51] Glory, glory.
[1:54:56] Hallelujah.
[1:55:00] Oh, take my heart,
[1:55:04] take my life.
[1:55:08] Let it be a living sacrifice.
[1:55:15] And all my dreams,
[1:55:20] all my plans,
[1:55:23] Lord, I place
[1:55:26] I'll place them in your hands. Lord, I
[1:55:30] give myself away.
[1:55:34] Fill me with your spirit. Fill me with
[1:55:37] your deity.
[1:55:40] Halleluah.
[1:55:44] Oh, I give myself away.
[1:55:53] I give myself away
[1:55:56] so you can. Oh, sing it again. I give
[1:56:01] myself away.
[1:56:04] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:56:15] Here's my heart. I am here. I stand.
[1:56:22] Lord, my life
[1:56:25] is in your hands.
[1:56:29] And Lord, I'm longing
[1:56:34] to see
[1:56:37] your desires
[1:56:40] revealed in me.
[1:56:44] So I give myself
[1:56:47] away.
[1:56:51] I give myself away.
[1:56:56] Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] Oh, I give myself away.
[1:57:06] I give myself away
[1:57:10] so you
[1:57:12] can use me.
[1:57:15] Can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[1:57:17] and worship him?
[1:57:20] Oh, bless the name of the Lord. Bless
[1:57:23] the name of the Lord.
[1:57:25] We don't have to try to fix it. We don't
[1:57:27] have to try to do anything. Just
[1:57:29] surrender ourselves to him.
[1:57:33] Oh, let you, Lord, fix the problems.
[1:57:38] God, let you fight the battles, God. Let
[1:57:40] you open the doors for us.
[1:57:44] Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] Bless the name of the Lord. Bless the
[1:57:49] name of the Lord.
[1:57:52] Give myself. I give myself to you.
[1:57:59] My life is not my own. To you I belong.
[1:58:06] I give myself.
[1:58:09] Can we sing that again?
[1:58:12] Oh my life.
[1:58:15] It's not my own.
[1:58:18] To you I belong.
[1:58:21] I give myself. I give myself to you. Oh,
[1:58:26] I give myself away
[1:58:37] so you can use me. I give myself away.
[1:58:48] I give myself away.
[1:58:52] Oh, you
[1:58:54] I surrender. I surrender.
[1:58:57] I surrender.
[1:59:04] I
[1:59:06] surrender.
[1:59:12] Lord, surrender
[1:59:15] my life.
[1:59:18] I give it all to you.
[1:59:26] I
[1:59:27] surrender.
[1:59:32] Lord, I surrender.
[1:59:40] Lord, I surrender my life.
[1:59:46] I give it all to you.
[1:59:51] Say that as a prayer now.
[1:59:54] I
[1:59:56] surrender.
[2:00:01] I
[2:00:03] surrender.
[2:00:09] I
[2:00:15] I give it all to you.
[2:00:22] I
[2:00:24] surrender.
[2:00:29] I
[2:00:31] surrender.
[2:00:36] Lord, I surrender my life.
[2:00:43] I give it all to you.
[2:00:49] Is that the way you feel this morning?
[2:00:54] There's that song
[2:00:57] Don Brother Donnie Reagan wrote it.
[2:00:59] Something
[2:01:01] about my life waste.
[2:01:04] Um
[2:01:06] would y'all know that song? Something I
[2:01:08] surrender I give it.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; All that I years I've wasted.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; All those wasted hours.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All those wasted hours and
[2:01:20] minutes.
[2:01:23] They're yours now.
[2:01:25] From the start to the finish. I need
[2:01:29] more
[2:01:31] of
[2:01:33] you
[2:01:35] in me.
[2:01:38] Let's sing it out a prayer now.
[2:01:42] I need more
[2:01:45] love.
[2:01:51] That's the way it's got to be.
[2:01:56] I
[2:02:05] till there's no room left in me.
[2:02:12] All those wasted
[2:02:15] hours and days,
[2:02:19] they're yours now. From the start to the
[2:02:23] finish. I need more
[2:02:31] in
[2:02:32] me. Can we sing that one more time?
[2:02:36] Oh, I need more.
[2:02:40] Is that the way you feel?
[2:02:47] That's the way it's got to be.
[2:02:51] I
[2:03:00] till there's no room left in me.
[2:03:08] All those wasted
[2:03:10] hours and
[2:03:15] they're yours now from the start to the
[2:03:18] finish. I need more
[2:03:29] as they just play softly.
[2:03:34] May we keep that in our mind.
[2:03:38] It's not a natural, you know, we're in
[2:03:41] the season of Christmas
[2:03:46] and they have, you know, many displays
[2:03:50] there are of a little Jesus in a manger.
[2:03:57] But today,
[2:03:59] we are that manger.
[2:04:02] We are the one that he comes to live in.
[2:04:04] Not as a baby
[2:04:07] but as fullness
[2:04:09] of God,
[2:04:11] full deity, full power,
[2:04:14] not infant,
[2:04:16] but God in us
[2:04:18] ruling and reigning and declaring
[2:04:20] himself as God. And I'm so glad for
[2:04:24] that.
[2:04:25] May God bless you today. We love you.
[2:04:28] Stay warm. You were supposed to have a
[2:04:30] snowstorm again tomorrow. And so uh
[2:04:36] uh some is amen, some of them. No, no,
[2:04:41] I'm in between.
[2:04:46] But uh uh may you stay safe and once
[2:04:50] again, it's just really good to have all
[2:04:53] of visitors. Brother Chandler and his
[2:04:56] friend. God bless you all and always
[2:04:59] good seeing you and u sister Dia
[2:05:03] appreciate you. Amen. Very much. And um
[2:05:09] um may you have a wonderful day. Let's
[2:05:12] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:05:15] Amen. And ask maybe brother Will and
[2:05:19] dismiss this in prayer.
