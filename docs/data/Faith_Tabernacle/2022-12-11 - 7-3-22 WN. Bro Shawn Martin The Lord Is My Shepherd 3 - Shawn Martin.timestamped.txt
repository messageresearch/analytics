[2:08] brother Matt Morris tonight and then
[2:12] we'll be starting a meeting in another
[2:15] place in Arkansas so we want to keep him
[2:18] in our prayer and he asked me to to
[2:20] greet you all for him but if you have
[2:24] your Bibles we're going to turn to the
[2:27] Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter
[2:31] amen
[2:34] must have gotten a lot of rain over the
[2:36] weekend eh and uh I was reading the news
[2:41] they said there's some flooding going on
[2:44] in Virginia and several people are
[2:47] missing and and so I guess more up onto
[2:51] her Bluefield up in that area and it's
[2:54] moved houses off the foundations and so
[2:58] we want to keep the people in prayer for
[3:01] that the Lord will just
[3:04] I help them amen I tell you I just don't
[3:07] know what we'd do if we didn't know the
[3:09] Lord
[3:10] when we go through times of trouble and
[3:14] the Lord is certainly our stay he's our
[3:17] Rock and he's our comfort amen
[3:21] and but before we go into the word may
[3:25] we just borrow our heads and just talk
[3:28] to our Lord father
[3:31] truly your king of kings your Lord of
[3:34] lords
[3:35] and there's none else beside you
[3:39] and what an honor it is that you've
[3:41] called us
[3:43] in this age to be your ambassador to
[3:47] to serve you Lord and to run with your
[3:50] message
[3:52] and oh God to know that we have
[3:56] the scepter in our hands
[3:59] oh Father we just so thank you
[4:02] that you've redeemed us you bought us
[4:05] with your blood Lord
[4:08] and you've you've got a home prepared
[4:11] everything is set in order
[4:14] when the judgments of God are falling
[4:19] Lord the people don't know what to do
[4:22] they're shaking and fear trembling
[4:26] for their future is uncertain that Lord
[4:30] ours is certain
[4:33] father you've promised us a home you you
[4:36] promised us a way of Escape
[4:39] and oh Lord our hearts are at rest and
[4:42] we thank you for for for for providing
[4:46] such a refuge
[4:48] and I pray father that you would just
[4:50] bless what little words we have tonight
[4:53] though it may be simple let it be
[4:56] something that would
[4:58] uh better ground us and establish Us in
[5:03] you and bring us to a closer
[5:05] relationship with you
[5:07] father I pray that you would forgive us
[5:09] of our sins and our failures
[5:12] God and may your blood just cover us
[5:15] just now
[5:16] in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the
[5:19] church says
[5:20] amen and amen and the Book of Psalms the
[5:26] 23rd chapter
[5:28] and I'm just going to read the first
[5:29] verse but it says the Lord is my
[5:32] shepherd
[5:34] I shall not want. amen you can have your
[5:38] seats this evening
[5:40] and I'm going to continue on the thought
[5:43] the Lord is my shepherd
[5:47] and
[5:48] um
[5:49] this is a quite a statement that David
[5:52] makes in this
[5:55] um
[5:56] verse there
[5:57] because it's not just him saying
[6:00] that the Lord is his Shepherd but he's
[6:03] he's actually making a confession
[6:06] that he is the Sheep
[6:08] David is the sheep and the Lord is the
[6:12] shepherd
[6:13] later on in Psalms 103
[6:17] David says know ye that the Lord he is
[6:20] God it is he that hath made us not
[6:22] ourselves
[6:23] we are his people and the Sheep
[6:25] everybody say we are the Sheep of his
[6:28] pastor
[6:30] and so God Likens us as sheep and uh
[6:34] there in in First Peter 2 and 25 it says
[6:40] that we were as sheep that were going
[6:43] astray
[6:45] but now we have returned to the shepherd
[6:50] and Bishop of our souls
[6:53] and so all through the scripture God
[6:56] Likens us as sheep and he Likens himself
[7:00] as the shepherd
[7:02] he's the shepherd we're the Sheep
[7:05] which you know this shows the type of
[7:08] relationship that we have with him
[7:13] there's a special relationship that
[7:16] Believers have with God
[7:19] and so if if we study these things
[7:24] um then we know what kind of
[7:25] relationship we have now
[7:28] uh for one sheep must have a shepherd
[7:32] and we must have God
[7:36] David was a Shepherd at one time as we
[7:39] know and so he was very familiar with
[7:41] the nature and the the way of sheep he
[7:45] knew how she acted he knew uh their
[7:49] character and and so he knew just how
[7:53] valuable the shepherd was to the Sheep
[7:57] and David was valuable he knew that he
[8:01] knew he was valuable to the Sheep he led
[8:03] them
[8:04] he protected them he fed them he watered
[8:09] them he watched over them
[8:12] he as the shepherd helped bring other
[8:15] Lambs into the world
[8:18] he went after the Lambs that lost their
[8:21] way and brought them back into the fold
[8:25] he kept them from coyotes and from
[8:28] wolves and in David's case we knew that
[8:32] he uh he kept them from the bear and the
[8:35] lion
[8:36] uh this is the the way of a shepherd
[8:40] and and the shepherd as the prophet
[8:45] would tell us that a good shepherd he'd
[8:48] have to know the difference between you
[8:51] know the sounding of a sheep and the
[8:54] sound of a goat and and he had to know
[8:57] his sheep very well
[9:00] and so David understood both the needs
[9:03] of the sheep and the cares that the
[9:08] shepherd had
[9:11] and so we find that sheep are dumb
[9:14] they're helpless they are defenseless
[9:18] and they need to be protected
[9:22] and and and think that's a need
[9:26] they need to be fed
[9:29] they need to be watered
[9:32] they they need because it's a matter of
[9:36] survival to the Sheep ain't that right
[9:39] and so they need a shepherd
[9:43] and God made them that way now you know
[9:46] brother Brown said learning about sheep
[9:48] is not just education but he said it's
[9:51] divine education
[9:53] if you want to know about sheep it's
[9:55] it's a Divine education to know how she
[9:58] are
[10:01] and in studying the Sheep we learn how
[10:03] needy we are
[10:05] for we need to be led
[10:08] we need to be fed
[10:10] we need to be watered ain't that right
[10:13] we need to be protected we need a
[10:17] shepherd this is an optional this is a
[10:20] need
[10:20] that we have as as a sheep of God ain't
[10:25] that rhyme sheep cannot find their own
[10:29] food they can't find food on their own
[10:33] they can't find water on their own
[10:36] they cannot discern the enemy when he's
[10:40] trying to sneak in
[10:42] uh it takes a Shepherd they they rely
[10:47] upon the shepherd's senses they rely
[10:50] upon the shepherd's knowledge
[10:52] they rely upon the shepherd's
[10:55] intelligence
[10:56] can you say man
[10:57] a man sheep cannot fight off the enemy
[11:00] on their own they are defenseless
[11:03] they they are without the shepherd they
[11:06] are nothing but pure prey ain't that
[11:09] right to the Predator so they literally
[11:13] depend on the shepherd to defend them to
[11:18] guide them to protect them and to feed
[11:22] them
[11:24] and to save them
[11:26] and you say man when a sheep gets lost
[11:29] there's absolutely no way he can find
[11:30] his way back
[11:32] he's lost he needs a shepherd
[11:35] and the prophet would tell us see that
[11:38] sheep cannot lead sheep
[11:40] so as we see in the Bible that without a
[11:44] Shepherd the Sheep scatter
[11:47] because they can't lead one another
[11:50] they don't know how to stay together
[11:52] without a shepherd
[11:54] but they they stay together because
[11:57] there's a shepherd and they all rally
[12:00] around the shepherd
[12:02] can you say Amen
[12:04] so we we find that the welfare and
[12:07] survival of sheep is the responsibility
[12:10] of the shepherd so then the sheep have a
[12:14] personal attachment they have this
[12:18] personal relationship with their
[12:20] Shepherd
[12:22] another thing about sheep is that
[12:24] they're they're sacrificial they're a
[12:28] sacrificial animal
[12:30] when you read about the sacrifices and
[12:33] altars made in the Bible It's usually
[12:36] the lamb
[12:37] that is on the altar
[12:40] um when we read about the Exodus it was
[12:44] time for Exodus there the first Exodus
[12:48] and time for Passover it was time for
[12:52] the Tolkien
[12:53] God would provide a lamb a sheep
[12:56] for the people ain't that right
[12:59] because he's a sacrificial animal
[13:02] a lamb was put on the Altar for a sin
[13:06] offering it was a lamb that was killed
[13:09] for the burnt offering it was a lamb
[13:13] that God provided
[13:16] um uh for Abraham's sacrifice
[13:19] God would provide a a Ram uh he lamb
[13:23] ain't that right
[13:25] and so the lamb also is a type of Christ
[13:31] amen the sacrificial animal
[13:35] when Jesus walked on the earth he was
[13:38] God's lamb
[13:40] ain't that right
[13:42] uh the provided sacrifice
[13:45] John
[13:47] uh introduced him as the Lamb of God
[13:50] Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away
[13:54] the sins of the world
[13:57] Peter would tell us that we were
[13:59] redeemed with the precious blood of
[14:02] Christ
[14:04] as of a lamb without sparked or blemish
[14:09] ain't that right
[14:10] he was the Lamb of God
[14:13] so you you could see his life
[14:16] would would portray the life of a sheep
[14:21] amen
[14:22] his very own actions and Nature's proved
[14:25] that he was a lamb
[14:29] a man but a lamb nature
[14:32] amen
[14:34] and so we look
[14:36] at this lamb Christ
[14:40] acts 8 32 it tells us he was led
[14:45] as a sheep to the slaughter
[14:49] and we find out that sheep aren't driven
[14:52] they're LED
[14:55] and sometimes Christians
[14:58] may seem gullible
[15:02] because they're dumb
[15:04] helpless
[15:06] defenseless
[15:08] they're not made to be driven
[15:11] they're made to be led
[15:13] they're not made to live on their own
[15:16] they got to have a shepherd
[15:19] they're not made to make it on their own
[15:23] they got to have someone to lead them
[15:26] feed them ain't that right
[15:28] so we see the Life of Christ the lamb
[15:31] Matthew 4 and 1 then was Jesus led up of
[15:36] the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[15:40] tempted of the devil he was led get that
[15:43] word LED
[15:45] Matthew 26 57 and they that had laid
[15:49] hold on Jesus led him
[15:53] not pushed him
[15:55] not drove him not prodding him they led
[16:00] him
[16:01] not dragging him they led him
[16:05] and you say Amen to carefus the high
[16:08] priest Matthew 27 and 2 and when they
[16:12] had bound him
[16:14] they led him away
[16:17] and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the
[16:20] governor I I think it's important that
[16:23] God would let us know that he was led
[16:26] they didn't take him they led him
[16:30] they could have said well the Bible
[16:32] could have said well they brought him
[16:33] you know and and there's many ways to
[16:36] bring a person
[16:37] but they led him and God wants us to
[16:41] know that he was led to Calvary
[16:44] he was led to crucifixion
[16:47] he was led can you say amen amen God
[16:51] didn't drive him out in the wilderness
[16:52] to be tempted he was led there
[16:55] amen see and so Matthew 27 31 and after
[16:59] they had mocked him they took the robe
[17:02] off from him and put his own raiment on
[17:04] him and led him away to be crucified
[17:09] oh my
[17:11] God so then you go back to acts 8 and 32
[17:15] and like a lamb dumb
[17:19] before his Shearer Saul opened he not
[17:24] his mouth
[17:26] they spat upon him he opened not his
[17:28] mouth they smote him he opened not his
[17:32] mouth they beat him with the whip in the
[17:35] open not his mouth you understand what
[17:37] I'm saying he was a sacrificial lamb
[17:43] ain't that right
[17:44] see he was a lamb now another saying
[17:48] Matthew 21 and 5.
[17:51] tell ye the daughter of Zion Behold thy
[17:55] King cometh unto thee meek
[18:00] keep that word meek
[18:03] keep it in mind Matthew 11 29 it says
[18:08] take my yoke upon you and this is Jesus
[18:10] speaking
[18:11] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[18:14] for I am what meek and lowly in heart
[18:20] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[18:24] brother Brown said a lamb is the meekest
[18:28] and most gentlest of all the creatures
[18:30] there is on Earth
[18:32] there's nothing any more Meeker and
[18:35] gentler than a little lamb so innocent
[18:39] and not self-sustaining
[18:41] it's not arrogant it's gentle Meek
[18:45] little creature ain't that right
[18:47] so when John would tell us Behold the
[18:52] Lamb of God
[18:55] here's the meekness of God
[18:58] here's the gentleness of God
[19:01] a man upon the Earth
[19:04] that was meek in his spirit
[19:07] gentle now it's a lot of this because
[19:11] again
[19:13] he's our example
[19:15] because we're sheep right
[19:19] and so I looked up this word meekness
[19:22] and according to the vines dictionary
[19:25] meekness means gentle mild
[19:29] and if you'll notice that this meekness
[19:33] is to God
[19:36] hello
[19:37] [Music]
[19:38] this meekness is toward God
[19:42] you humble toward God gentle to God
[19:48] because he's got to be led
[19:51] ain't that right
[19:53] you ain't gonna find you ain't gonna
[19:56] find a wolf gentle to the shepherd
[19:59] but you'll find that lamb gentle
[20:03] you'll find the wolf's not being Meek
[20:06] toward the shepherd
[20:09] but but you'll find that the Sheep being
[20:12] gentle to the shepherd you understand
[20:15] what I'm saying so this is a meekness
[20:19] that is toward God the great Shepherd
[20:22] now you you look John 4 34.
[20:26] Jesus says unto them my meat
[20:30] is to do the will of him not them
[20:35] but him
[20:38] hello
[20:39] see Jesus a lamb had to have a shepherd
[20:46] ain't that right
[20:48] and so my meat is to do the will of him
[20:52] that sent me
[20:55] and to finish his work
[20:57] John 6 38 for I came down
[21:01] from Heaven not to do mine own will
[21:05] but the will of him that sent me
[21:10] don't think for a moment that his
[21:12] enemies took his life
[21:14] they didn't take his life
[21:16] he gave his life
[21:19] ain't that right
[21:21] he's a sheep
[21:24] the Bible says he gave himself a ransom
[21:26] for all
[21:28] Matthew 20 and 27.
[21:31] and whosoever will be Chief among you
[21:34] let him be your servant
[21:38] even as the son of man came not to be
[21:40] ministered unto
[21:42] but to minister and to give his life a
[21:47] ransom for many
[21:49] he came he couldn't come in any other
[21:52] way but a lamb
[21:54] a man because his life was a sacrificial
[21:56] life
[21:58] he came to minister
[22:00] and to give his life
[22:03] and you say Amen
[22:05] you see this is what Christianity is
[22:07] about
[22:09] is to minister
[22:10] and to give our life
[22:14] hello
[22:16] so this proved that he was the Lamb of
[22:19] God
[22:21] he came in meekness
[22:23] now one writer said meekness
[22:28] is that temper of spirit
[22:32] in which we accept God's dealing with us
[22:37] as good
[22:40] hello
[22:42] without disputing
[22:44] or resisting
[22:49] so this is why God would depict us as
[22:52] Lambs
[22:54] because it's the most gentlest it's the
[22:56] most meekest
[22:58] animal there is
[23:01] how else could he go to Calvary if he
[23:03] wasn't a lamb
[23:05] [Music]
[23:07] what if he came as a lion
[23:12] he would have destroyed his enemies
[23:14] did he come as a lamb
[23:17] hello
[23:19] you ain't gonna leave no line
[23:23] ain't that right
[23:25] but he was a lamb that was led
[23:29] and so he he could accept
[23:33] God's dealings with him
[23:36] as good
[23:39] ain't that right
[23:42] and as Lamb's meekness is
[23:46] part of a lamb that's the nature that's
[23:48] the character
[23:50] that's what makes it sacrificial
[23:54] that we can accept God's dealings with
[23:57] us as good
[23:59] could you imagine the the shepherd
[24:01] trying to trying to you know Shepherds
[24:04] you know a goat
[24:07] Shepherd some other thing
[24:10] trying to lead them
[24:12] and kick it up a fuss
[24:14] I don't want to go to that pasture
[24:17] I don't want to go there I want to go
[24:18] here
[24:19] and the shepherd's constantly trying to
[24:22] wrestle with it
[24:24] she you don't ever see sheep in a rodeo
[24:28] you'll see the ball
[24:29] you'll see the wild horse
[24:32] but you ain't gonna see a sheep at a
[24:34] rodeo
[24:35] he's not the main he's not the main
[24:37] character at the rodeo right
[24:40] yeah that's right see so we we find that
[24:45] you you you you accept God's dealing
[24:48] with you as good without disputing and
[24:52] without resisting
[24:55] now a lamb first Peter 2 21
[25:01] speaking of Christ but it says for even
[25:03] here unto were you called
[25:09] because Christ also suffered for us
[25:13] leaving us an example
[25:18] and you say Amen
[25:20] not leaving the wild goat for an example
[25:24] he's not an example to the goat he's not
[25:27] an example to some wild beast out there
[25:31] he's an example to the other sheep
[25:35] hello
[25:37] as as we're talking now
[25:39] we're talking about sheep
[25:42] and what greater example of sheep
[25:45] then we've got in Christ himself
[25:49] and here unto where you call because
[25:52] also Christ suffered for us leaving us
[25:56] an example that you should follow his
[26:00] footsteps
[26:01] or follow his steps
[26:04] who did no sin
[26:06] neither was guile found in his mouth
[26:11] who when he was reviled reviled not
[26:15] again
[26:16] when he suffered he threatened notch
[26:20] but committed himself
[26:23] to him the shepherd
[26:27] that judges righteously
[26:30] can you say man
[26:32] president said he didn't Rail and Carry
[26:35] On and fuss and stew and go on he just
[26:40] didn't do that
[26:41] now this proves to us that Lambs sheep
[26:46] are not fussy
[26:51] they want to do the will of the father
[26:54] they're obedient they're pliable
[26:58] call them dumb all you want to
[27:01] but they know they got to have the
[27:02] shepherd
[27:05] they know
[27:06] they're not out trying to be the lion
[27:08] they're not out trying to be the goat
[27:10] they're not trying to be nothing else
[27:12] they know God made them to have a
[27:15] Shepherd can you say man
[27:18] it's just a character it's just
[27:20] something there now brother bran would
[27:22] say now you let somebody do something to
[27:23] you or me
[27:25] my would just blow up like a toe frog
[27:27] eating buckshot
[27:29] but felt like an old goose
[27:31] I'll tell you right now you stepped on
[27:33] my toes like that again I'll never go
[27:35] back to that old church again
[27:37] no sir bless God hallelujah see the
[27:40] nazarenes will receive me the pilgrims
[27:42] holding us they'll take me Hallelujah I
[27:44] don't have to do it you don't do it no
[27:46] more all right see the dove takes his
[27:49] flight
[27:50] and you know what if that old hypocrite
[27:52] goes to that church I'll never go again
[27:55] bless God I'll just never do it
[27:57] well now brother Madam is showing us the
[28:00] difference between the nature of a sheep
[28:04] and the nature of a wolf
[28:07] hello
[28:09] try it
[28:11] so now if you notice because again David
[28:14] is saying the Lord is my shepherd
[28:17] I shall not want and and that whole
[28:20] scripture chapter
[28:25] first of all he's putting him his
[28:27] position as she
[28:29] the Lord's position as Shepherd
[28:32] his Shepherd
[28:34] so that means he's the Lord's sheep
[28:38] there's that relationship but you never
[28:40] find
[28:42] in that chapter
[28:45] where David is accusing God
[28:49] David never mentions anything about his
[28:52] problems
[28:54] David never mentions anythings about the
[28:57] trials and tribulations that he goes
[29:00] through
[29:01] or that he had gone through
[29:04] he just said the Lord's my shepherd
[29:07] and when you read that scripture it
[29:10] makes you want to be sheep
[29:13] it makes you want him to be your
[29:15] Shepherd
[29:17] because they get all what an awesome
[29:18] Shepherd God is
[29:21] leads me beside the Still Waters
[29:23] prepares the table before me in the
[29:26] presence of my enemies
[29:28] goodness and mercy will follow me all
[29:30] the days of my life and it's all because
[29:31] the Lord's my shepherd
[29:34] but don't forget where God led him many
[29:36] times
[29:38] he was anointed to the throne
[29:41] but he didn't go to the throne
[29:42] immediately
[29:44] but David doesn't tell us these things
[29:46] does he
[29:48] not in this chapter
[29:56] well know that the Lord
[30:01] allowed David to go through many things
[30:04] that David didn't want to go through
[30:08] and it would actually
[30:10] seemingly break David into the point
[30:13] that David would die
[30:15] that David would
[30:17] never go to the throne
[30:20] but one thing through it all
[30:23] after it all David realized
[30:28] he's my shepherd
[30:31] remember he said if it hadn't been for
[30:32] the Lord on my side
[30:35] I've been swallowed up
[30:38] had not been for the Lord on my side you
[30:40] remember them chapters oh that man would
[30:42] praise the Lord
[30:44] why
[30:45] because in the times that you're going
[30:48] through your trials
[30:50] it seems as if you're the one that's
[30:53] doing it
[30:54] it seems as if you're the one
[30:57] that's struggling and making it a long
[31:00] through life
[31:02] it seems as if you're barely surviving
[31:07] not realizing if the Lord wasn't your
[31:09] Shepherd you wouldn't have survived at
[31:12] all
[31:19] David doesn't Point blame to God
[31:22] and he doesn't speak
[31:25] as though he's disappointed
[31:28] in God's leadership
[31:31] because he was a lamb
[31:34] he never mentions the fact
[31:37] that he was rejected of his own people
[31:39] as king
[31:42] right
[31:43] he never mentions the fact that he was
[31:46] sped upon
[31:48] and he knew
[31:51] that the Lord told that man to spit upon
[31:54] him
[31:55] remember
[31:59] the one by David drew his swords and how
[32:03] dare that dog spit on my king
[32:05] I'll take his head off
[32:08] and David says let him alone
[32:11] the Lord
[32:13] the Lord
[32:15] it wasn't his enemy the Lord wasn't
[32:17] David's enemy David the Lord was his
[32:19] Shepherd
[32:22] can you say man
[32:24] and David's going to take a scripture a
[32:27] passage of scripture to write about that
[32:29] Shepherd
[32:30] yeah
[32:32] hello
[32:34] sometimes we focus on everything that's
[32:36] going wrong
[32:40] when in all reality he's the shepherd
[32:43] David didn't stumble into these things
[32:47] the Lord led him
[32:52] just as much as Jesus didn't just
[32:54] stumble into this Wilderness of
[32:57] Temptation
[33:00] he was led to be there
[33:02] amen he just didn't stumble happened to
[33:07] just by chance go into Pilot's Hall
[33:12] he was led there
[33:17] hello
[33:22] David never speaks of the time
[33:27] of years
[33:31] that he was a fugitive
[33:34] and anointed
[33:36] knowing he was anointed to be king
[33:40] and spending many years running for his
[33:44] life from a Mad King
[33:49] that all he would let us know is the
[33:50] Lord's my shepherd
[33:53] hope you understand I know it's a simple
[33:57] but if you're sheep the Lord your
[33:59] Shepherd
[34:01] but one thing David would display
[34:03] as Christ displayed his meekness
[34:07] that they could accept God's dealings
[34:10] with them as good
[34:14] without disputing without resisting
[34:19] and you say man
[34:22] the shepherd was leading and as a lamb
[34:24] David followed
[34:28] sometimes we just want to think it's the
[34:31] world that's that's caving in on us it's
[34:33] life is just treating us bad
[34:39] we just think every day is just a bad
[34:41] day
[34:43] we just think the economy is just rough
[34:47] and if we're not careful we'll start
[34:49] using our lips to complain
[34:55] hello
[35:00] in all reality if you're sheep the Lord
[35:02] your Shepherd
[35:07] another thing about sheep is they
[35:08] forfeit the rights sheep forfeits its
[35:11] rights
[35:13] it Bears woo
[35:16] Prophet said which is a god-given right
[35:19] God gave that sheep the wool
[35:22] and yet it's the only thing that it has
[35:26] and yet it forfeits it
[35:29] sheep forfeit everything that they have
[35:33] it's a sacrificial animal
[35:36] can you say man
[35:38] Prophet said he's willing to lay Upon A
[35:40] sharing block and have every bit of it
[35:42] sheared off of
[35:44] he won't kick and fuss about it just lay
[35:47] him up there
[35:48] put the loops around his legs and he
[35:50] just lays there and you take it from him
[35:52] everything he has that he forfeits it
[35:55] without murmuring about it
[35:57] I wonder today we who are supposed to be
[36:00] the Lambs of God you just cross try
[36:02] Crossing you up one time and watch how
[36:04] much lamb you are
[36:06] you talking about kicking up a fuss well
[36:09] I'll tell you let something go wrong in
[36:11] the church well I'll just quit right now
[36:12] and go over and join the Methodist yes
[36:15] sir I don't have to put up with that
[36:16] that shows what you're made out of
[36:20] another place he says the lamb
[36:22] sacrifices everything he's got the lamb
[36:26] hasn't got nothing but wool and yet he
[36:28] lays there and lets them Shear it off of
[36:31] him and says nothing about it
[36:33] the Bible can share everything all the
[36:36] pride and everything else out of you and
[36:37] if you're a lamb you'll say nothing
[36:39] about it
[36:40] can you say Amen
[36:42] amen that's right but you tried goat one
[36:45] time and you'll have it first kicked up
[36:47] right quick
[36:49] that's the difference between goat and
[36:51] sheep
[36:53] ain't that right
[36:55] now notice Romans 8 14 we know this
[36:59] that Paul said but as many as are Led
[37:03] Led by what
[37:05] the spirit of God the shepherd
[37:09] I want to get into that more later
[37:13] but as many as are led by the spirit of
[37:16] God they are the sons of God
[37:21] sheep cheap
[37:23] sons of God are sheep
[37:25] Daughters of God are sheep
[37:28] ain't that right
[37:30] and the Lord is their Shepherd and they
[37:35] follow him
[37:38] now that means that Hollywood isn't
[37:40] going to lead you
[37:44] it means that family and friends aren't
[37:46] going to lead you
[37:48] you understand the shepherd has more
[37:50] influence over you than anything in the
[37:52] world
[37:53] hello
[37:55] that that's the relationship that sheep
[37:58] have with the shepherd
[37:59] let let you walk up to that that that
[38:02] that the sheep and you're not Shepherd
[38:05] of that sheep they ain't gonna know your
[38:06] voice you you're a stranger to them
[38:10] hello
[38:11] you can talk all you want to but let the
[38:13] Shepherds speak once
[38:16] and the Sheep will rally around the
[38:19] shepherd because he sways the influence
[38:21] over them
[38:24] can you say Amen
[38:25] so this modern day Society isn't going
[38:29] to lead you
[38:31] your job
[38:33] is it going to lead you
[38:35] you know
[38:37] so many people today let their
[38:39] unconverted boss lead them around
[38:43] ye is it your spiritual guide
[38:46] he ain't worried about your spiritual
[38:48] walk with God
[38:50] he don't care about church he don't care
[38:52] about the supernatural things all he's
[38:55] worried about is making the money
[38:58] you understand what I'm saying
[39:01] see so so many times though if the boss
[39:04] says you're working late and you you
[39:06] ain't going to church we we just we just
[39:08] automatically fold
[39:14] well it's true
[39:18] but the Lord's got to be your Shepherd
[39:22] hello
[39:24] The Shepherd of the the the Sheep money
[39:28] isn't going to lead you
[39:30] your flesh isn't going to lead you
[39:35] ain't that right the carnal mind isn't
[39:38] going to lead you
[39:39] for David said the Lord is my shepherd
[39:42] He leadeth me
[39:46] Elijah and pass that your flesh would
[39:48] never go
[39:50] he'll Lead You In places that your
[39:51] carnal mind would never take you
[39:58] right you say man
[40:00] so one must possess
[40:03] a sheep like nature
[40:06] in order to be led by the shepherd
[40:10] why sheep trusts the shepherd
[40:15] they depend on the shepherd
[40:18] they have absolute confidence in the
[40:21] shepherd
[40:23] I know
[40:27] there's a big argument upon who's who
[40:29] what and who is our absolute today
[40:32] among the message ranks
[40:36] but you understand
[40:40] that for the Sheep their Shepherd is
[40:44] their absolute
[40:47] his voice
[40:50] is there absolute
[40:53] can you say man
[40:56] notice John 10 and 2.
[41:01] that he that enters in by the door is
[41:04] The Shepherd of the sheep to him the
[41:06] Porter openeth and the sheep hear his
[41:11] not footsteps
[41:15] right
[41:17] the Sheep don't hear him Belch
[41:22] the Sheep don't hear him break a stick
[41:26] that's not what appeals to the Sheep
[41:29] let that Shepherd speak
[41:34] and they hear his voice he calleth his
[41:38] own Sheep by name and leadeth them out
[41:41] aren't you glad you're being called by
[41:43] name
[41:46] oh to save the lamb Book of Life been
[41:48] opened
[41:50] our names were written in that book
[41:54] and in this age the voice of the
[41:56] shepherd is speaking
[41:58] as I said before it's the only age that
[42:00] we hear we hear the warning we hear the
[42:04] warning don't don't don't uh don't
[42:07] disregard the voice
[42:09] right remember he's knocking at the door
[42:12] if any man will hear my voice the holy
[42:17] age is this layout of sin age that we
[42:20] hear that warning hear my voice and open
[42:24] up I will come into him and sup with him
[42:28] ain't that right what is it it's it's
[42:31] the word being sounded out
[42:36] the full word the opening of the word
[42:39] the pure word of God
[42:42] and we understand it's the shepherd's
[42:44] voice
[42:46] not just a man talking
[42:51] it's God
[42:53] talking through that prophet
[42:56] can you say man
[42:58] see and he's calling us
[43:05] see calleth his own Sheep by name and
[43:08] lead him out
[43:11] and when he puteth forth his own sheep
[43:13] he goeth before them and the Sheep
[43:17] follow him for they know his voice
[43:20] see the voice of the shepherd is their
[43:23] absolute
[43:25] that's why I say this messages are
[43:27] absolute
[43:29] can you say Amen now they want to put it
[43:32] as just a a voice of another man but I
[43:35] say it's the voice of God to you
[43:37] brother Branham even said it he said I
[43:40] am God's voice to you
[43:43] and he said I felt bad about it the
[43:46] first time for saying that but it
[43:47] repeated it
[43:51] [Music]
[43:52] can you say Amen
[43:55] now they can say we're following a man
[43:57] all they want to I say I see my shepherd
[44:01] aren't you glad that the shepherd or
[44:04] that the Sheep is not
[44:06] it's not following the form of a
[44:08] shepherd
[44:10] they don't know him by Form per se they
[44:14] know him by his voice
[44:17] isn't that amazing how God would make a
[44:19] natural sheep type out the spiritual
[44:21] sheep
[44:24] when God was in Moses the people
[44:26] followed the voice
[44:29] when God was in Noah the elect the Sheep
[44:33] followed the voice
[44:35] All Through the Ages it's been The Voice
[44:42] amen
[44:45] they know his voice and a stranger will
[44:48] they not follow but will flee run from
[44:52] him
[44:56] so you you you and I've
[44:59] if you're not the shepherd say if if you
[45:03] go to a natural sheep let's say
[45:05] and you you're about visiting and you
[45:07] see all the sheep and you see the
[45:08] shepherd
[45:09] so you'll never have relationship with
[45:11] that sheep like the shepherd has
[45:15] there's a lot of strange voices in this
[45:17] age
[45:18] brother Brown names a bunch of them
[45:20] voice of Education voice of Hollywood
[45:22] for some pleasure voice of entertainment
[45:25] at religious voices
[45:27] it's just voice after voice after voice
[45:30] and they're sounding in this age at the
[45:33] time the shepherd sounds his voice
[45:36] sure
[45:38] he sounds his voice
[45:41] so that the Sheep know who to follow
[45:48] they know not the voice of strangers
[45:51] the walls of Hollywood is a stranger to
[45:53] sheep
[45:55] voice of education is a stranger
[45:59] hello
[46:01] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[46:03] see so many people go start out with God
[46:06] and they go to them colleges and and
[46:08] they start living out there and we've
[46:10] seen it happen they go shipwreck they
[46:12] come out here they say well we're going
[46:14] to visit church we want to contend
[46:15] Church while we're here and he'll start
[46:17] for a little while and brother Walker
[46:18] you've seen it we know it and and before
[46:21] you know it they go Shipwrecked they no
[46:23] longer come to church they start you
[46:25] know if there's the girls they start
[46:26] wearing you know fingernail polish on
[46:28] the toes and the fingers and this and
[46:31] that and before you know it you don't
[46:33] see them much anymore
[46:34] but I'm telling you it's a voice to get
[46:37] you away from the voice of the shepherd
[46:44] all these voices
[46:47] that notice in the 27th verse John 10 27
[46:50] my sheep hear my voice I know them
[46:54] and they follow me
[46:56] they follow me can you say man
[47:01] you know brother Branham in his later
[47:02] maybe one of the last sermons well the
[47:05] last one of the last sermons he preached
[47:07] was leadership
[47:09] you got to listen to that
[47:11] and it sounds as though he's talking to
[47:13] him about himself but it's not
[47:16] he knows he's getting ready to leave
[47:20] but the voice of the shepherd remains
[47:24] and God was telling us as sheep
[47:27] follow come follow me
[47:30] right
[47:32] follow me
[47:35] now listen if if one has not a sheep
[47:39] like nature
[47:41] than the voice of the shepherd means
[47:44] nothing
[47:46] ain't that right
[47:48] the voice of the Lord then becomes
[47:50] quietened by all these other voices and
[47:53] remember the prophet says all these
[47:56] voices are sounding so loud that they're
[47:59] actually putting the voice of the Lord
[48:01] back way somewhere else
[48:04] but the Sheep are following that voice
[48:07] that the world is pushing back
[48:12] ain't that right
[48:14] see now you know I I think I told you
[48:18] mentioned to you that you know brother
[48:19] Branham was was in another country
[48:23] and he was riding with a man
[48:26] I think in a Jeep and
[48:28] they were in traffic and
[48:31] he said all of a sudden they just
[48:32] stopped come to a complete stop in the
[48:34] middle of the road everybody just
[48:36] stopped brother Brown said what what's
[48:38] going on
[48:40] he says get on the bumper and look
[48:42] so he got on the bumper and he's looking
[48:45] and there's a shepherd
[48:48] with a sheep
[48:50] crossing the road
[48:52] remember you mean we're going to stop
[48:54] for this and
[48:56] he says but the shepherd has the right
[48:58] of way
[49:00] everything stops when the shepherd comes
[49:05] you know and brother Brandon typings
[49:07] that out that when the shepherd comes
[49:10] everything gonna come to a stop
[49:14] you're coming for a sheep
[49:17] aren't you glad for that
[49:19] oh yes I'm glad for that
[49:23] but see everything he says given them
[49:26] the right away
[49:27] he said it was a sight to be hoped
[49:31] and he says you know he said I watched
[49:34] that Shepherd come down through a street
[49:35] and in Palestine and different countries
[49:38] the orange everywhere they don't take
[49:40] their food and put them in fine glass
[49:42] counters like we do they just have a
[49:44] little spray coming up or just a bunch
[49:46] of fruit laying out and stuff right on
[49:48] the streets
[49:49] and here come that Shepherd going right
[49:51] towards one of them places
[49:54] and I thought man you're going to have a
[49:56] riot sure enough and as we drove up
[49:58] close to watch the strangest thing was
[49:59] that chipper went down through between
[50:02] those Great Walls of fruit and dainty
[50:04] things and pears and vegetables which
[50:07] the Sheep would love and it sure looked
[50:10] like them sheep would jump from one side
[50:12] to the other but they followed that
[50:13] Shepherd so close
[50:16] that they never looked to the right nor
[50:18] to the left they walked right through
[50:20] every Temptation following the shepherd
[50:23] and I thought oh God a true Born Again
[50:26] sheep of the foe will go through the
[50:29] Temptations of this life following the
[50:31] shepherd for my sheep know my voice and
[50:34] that Shepherd would just speak to them
[50:38] he said I notice in those great times of
[50:41] distress those great Temptations those
[50:43] little sheep looking from side to side
[50:45] and one time a lamb would try uh uh and
[50:49] the mama would nudge him a little bit he
[50:51] said we need some old more some more
[50:53] old-fashioned nudge and mammies
[50:56] with our kitties tonight when they're
[50:58] doing wrong and I noticed that Shepherd
[51:00] stepped out and going like this if he
[51:02] made a step out like this and come back
[51:03] every sheep followed him went straight
[51:06] in the same step they come right up
[51:08] there and go in and go out everyone
[51:10] right following right along with these
[51:13] others and our old brother it's not a
[51:15] sheep that gets out of order
[51:18] it's a goat that'll go aside for the
[51:20] temptation
[51:22] it's a goal that'll go out and grab a
[51:24] pear or whatever he can get a hold of
[51:26] not the Sheep it's the goat can you say
[51:28] man and the only thing that falls out is
[51:32] those who are tottering and waving
[51:36] so we find that a man's nature must be
[51:39] changed from a wolf or a goat to a sheep
[51:43] and if you're God's sheep and the Lord
[51:46] is your Shepherd
[51:49] then you will recognize his leadership
[51:54] you will be grateful for his leadership
[51:58] you will seek after his leadership
[52:02] you will wait for his leadership
[52:06] because now you are sheep you've got the
[52:09] nature of a lamb
[52:12] eat that right
[52:14] I know this is simple
[52:16] but I hope it drive to drive it home
[52:19] Matthew 12 15.
[52:22] Jesus said for whosoever shall do the
[52:24] will of My Father which is in heaven the
[52:26] same as my brother and sister and mother
[52:31] read that again for whosoever shall do
[52:34] the will of my father
[52:35] which is in heaven the same is my mother
[52:39] sister
[52:40] and brother brother sister and mother
[52:43] see in other words the ones who does the
[52:46] will of my father
[52:48] are the ones who are part of me
[52:51] relationship
[52:52] can you say Amen
[52:54] it's it's because he's the lamb we're
[52:58] Lambs he done the will of the father we
[53:01] do the will of the father
[53:03] ain't that right so the ones who are
[53:06] blood relationship they are family
[53:09] now notice second Peter 1 and 3
[53:12] according as his divine power hath given
[53:15] unto us all things that pertain unto
[53:18] life and godliness through the knowledge
[53:20] of him that hath called us to glory and
[53:22] virtue whereby are given unto us
[53:26] exceeding great and precious promises
[53:29] that by these you might be partaker of
[53:33] what
[53:34] the divine nature
[53:39] It's the Most Blessed thing
[53:42] to be a partaker of this divine nature
[53:46] that it would be even to be part taker
[53:49] of Heaven
[53:52] that it would be to be part taker of all
[53:56] other other blessings that God has
[53:59] hello
[54:02] people receive blessings of God all
[54:06] around
[54:07] yeah but there's that sheep there's that
[54:10] elect that can actually be partaker of
[54:14] the divine nature
[54:19] it's a blessing
[54:22] and because we are partaker of this
[54:25] divine nature we have escaped the
[54:28] corruption that is in the world through
[54:30] lust
[54:35] ain't that right
[54:36] remember the water that flowed from The
[54:38] Rock
[54:40] you know they they painted just a little
[54:42] trickle just a little trickle brother
[54:43] Brown said it couldn't have been a
[54:45] little trickle it had to feed the two
[54:47] two and a half million people and the
[54:50] camels and the goats and all the animals
[54:52] the herds but he said not only that but
[54:55] but towns cities Beyond them
[54:59] they partook of that water that
[55:00] overflowed
[55:02] that flowed down into their cities they
[55:04] were able to partake of it
[55:06] and so is it in this age the Revival has
[55:09] gone to where everyone the world look at
[55:12] how blessed people have been right
[55:18] but then there's that few that are
[55:20] partaker of divine nature
[55:24] now now how do we become partaker I mean
[55:27] what what is this it's the life of the
[55:30] Lamb coming back upon you
[55:33] it's the token the life is the token and
[55:37] the token has to be on display
[55:40] can you say amen for all deceased so the
[55:44] life of the Lamb coming into you makes
[55:47] you a lamb
[55:49] raise some water
[55:52] think of how we used to fuss and kick
[55:55] trying to make our own way
[56:01] but then the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[56:03] really comes in
[56:05] it it it doesn't just make you churchy
[56:07] it doesn't just make you well now I got
[56:10] the Holy Ghost I said on the pew
[56:11] no no many people without the logo sits
[56:14] on pews
[56:15] many people without the Holy Ghost
[56:17] believed in a god-centered prophet
[56:19] many many people but but at the same
[56:22] time the the Peter I think it was that
[56:25] would talk about this age that there
[56:27] would be a people that would deny
[56:29] deny the Lord that bought them
[56:33] they would deny him the rights to be to
[56:36] be owner to be leader to to have his way
[56:39] with them
[56:41] so when we say of this divine nature we
[56:43] find that the life is the token and for
[56:46] this time this evening time life
[56:50] this is the evening time it's token time
[56:55] so then if if there's ever a time they
[56:59] have it think of it
[57:01] the voice of the shepherd speaks in this
[57:03] age If any man hears my voice
[57:06] and yet there has to be a life on
[57:09] display
[57:10] life of what the life of the Lamb
[57:14] right
[57:16] he was a lamb and now the life of that
[57:18] lamb has come back upon us
[57:21] the show that we are purchased we are
[57:24] the redeemed
[57:27] so it's at this time that when the voice
[57:30] is uttering there is a sheep
[57:34] the life has entered into us to make us
[57:37] sheep
[57:39] don't worry we only hear that voice
[57:49] and when the life of the Lamb comes into
[57:51] you then the Lord becomes your Shepherd
[57:54] we sing the song where he leads me I'll
[57:56] follow
[57:58] I mean people have sung that
[58:00] in the churches
[58:04] claiming to have the Holy Ghost and
[58:05] still doing the ways of the world
[58:09] see he cannot be your Shepherd
[58:12] I'll tell you partake of the divine
[58:15] nature
[58:16] ain't that right
[58:18] I want you to I want to read this and
[58:20] you know
[58:22] but brother Brown said a young man asked
[58:24] me the other day said if you you think I
[58:26] could or ought to get married brother
[58:29] Brown does such and such girl and said
[58:30] how much do you think of her she said he
[58:32] said I just love her
[58:34] he said well if you're not going to live
[58:35] without her you better marry her
[58:37] you can live without her you better not
[58:39] but if it's going to kill you you better
[58:41] get go ahead and get married see and I
[58:43] said yeah and and so what I was trying
[58:46] to tell him is that if you love her so
[58:48] much
[58:49] see now right now before you're married
[58:52] and everything is fine and dandy but
[58:53] after you get married
[58:55] then the tolls and trials of Life come
[58:58] in
[58:59] that's when you've got to be so in love
[59:01] that you understand one another
[59:03] when you're disappointed in her and
[59:05] she's disappointed in you and yet you
[59:08] still understand one another and he said
[59:10] that's the way it is with Christ we've
[59:12] got to be so in love with him
[59:16] see till when we ask for something and
[59:19] he doesn't give it to us that doesn't
[59:21] shake us a bit see why and the only way
[59:24] that you can do that is to become
[59:26] partakers of his divine nature then
[59:29] you'll understand the reason he can't
[59:31] give it to you
[59:34] ain't that right
[59:37] so so we find that that you you you're
[59:41] so in love they're they're becomes such
[59:43] an attachment
[59:45] to Christ Our Shepherd
[59:48] that that where we put ourselves at his
[59:52] leadership
[59:54] we we put ourselves at his Mercy
[59:59] hello
[1:00:02] because there's there's an understanding
[1:00:05] there's a love there in such a way
[1:00:09] that he can actually have Sovereign
[1:00:11] rights in his leadership
[1:00:13] it can be Sovereign leadership over our
[1:00:17] lives
[1:00:18] and wherever he takes us
[1:00:21] whatever he allows to come
[1:00:24] whatever it would be
[1:00:26] we may pray for something and it doesn't
[1:00:28] happen that way
[1:00:30] we may Envision something happening and
[1:00:32] yet it it's totally blocked and we find
[1:00:35] our Direction going something else but
[1:00:37] yet we know it's the Lord leading
[1:00:40] ain't that right
[1:00:42] then with that meekness we accept his
[1:00:46] dealings with us as good
[1:00:49] right
[1:00:50] that's good
[1:00:53] without resisting or disputing
[1:00:57] right
[1:01:00] as I close I think it's kind of
[1:01:03] funny how the prophet would use
[1:01:05] different animals in their nature
[1:01:08] to show people what they are in their
[1:01:12] nature
[1:01:14] and
[1:01:17] really Bram talking about when he's in
[1:01:19] in Oklahoma Tulsa and he said I was
[1:01:21] getting in an awful mess there are them
[1:01:23] denominations begin swinging around
[1:01:25] there and I so I was sitting in this
[1:01:27] building one day and I saw a vision
[1:01:30] saw a little pretty little old kitten
[1:01:33] and he was laying on a silk pillow and
[1:01:35] he was the cutest little fella
[1:01:37] and I walked over there and he said I'm
[1:01:39] afraid of a cat
[1:01:41] but I went over there and I began to
[1:01:42] rake him and he was going purr purr you
[1:01:46] know
[1:01:46] he said you know he's however they do
[1:01:49] that funny noise you know and I was
[1:01:50] raking him they all saying pretty little
[1:01:52] kitty
[1:01:53] and he disappearing just as fine you
[1:01:56] know
[1:01:57] and I looked over this behind his pillow
[1:02:00] and it it said Pentecostal kitten
[1:02:03] well I thought now that isn't that
[1:02:05] strange
[1:02:06] and I said this has got to be a vision
[1:02:08] and something said as long as you rake
[1:02:10] his fur this way
[1:02:12] it's all right you know but now if you
[1:02:15] want to see what he's really made out of
[1:02:18] rake is fur backwards
[1:02:20] so when I raked his fur back then I
[1:02:24] stuck out green and he was a monster
[1:02:26] standing there spitting at me as hard as
[1:02:29] he could see just rake his fur back a
[1:02:33] little bit tell him his baptism in the
[1:02:35] father son holy ghosts of the devil now
[1:02:38] the Catholic church and Watch What
[1:02:39] Happens
[1:02:41] his fur gets up
[1:02:44] but see it's it's something Al that
[1:02:48] people are God would use the animals to
[1:02:51] to do such a thing such
[1:02:53] now brother Branham in another place if
[1:02:55] the musicians will come
[1:02:57] that brother Branham in one sermon was
[1:02:59] talking about the Gentile woman who
[1:03:01] Jesus called a dog
[1:03:04] and we all know the story she's meeting
[1:03:07] her daughter her daughter was vexed with
[1:03:08] the Devil
[1:03:10] and needing deliverance and
[1:03:14] but even though he called her a dog he
[1:03:17] insulted her calling her a dog yet she
[1:03:20] was still persistent she wouldn't quit
[1:03:22] she wouldn't leave her faith was so
[1:03:24] great that she wanted that and she had
[1:03:25] to have that miracle
[1:03:27] and he said now that wouldn't work
[1:03:30] on a bunch of Canadians would or a bunch
[1:03:33] of Americans he called him a dog or
[1:03:34] something why you're something or
[1:03:36] another
[1:03:37] you're a bunch of anglicans you know
[1:03:40] there's nothing to you something like
[1:03:42] that all my sakes you'd blow up like a
[1:03:44] frog getting shot
[1:03:46] he says see you would have not he said
[1:03:48] excuse the prayer expression see but um
[1:03:52] he said you would have thought awful bad
[1:03:55] about that if Jesus would have said I'm
[1:03:58] not sent to you anglicans I'm not sent
[1:04:00] it to you Pentecostals You're simply God
[1:04:02] you Church of God whatever you are I
[1:04:04] wasn't sent to you you're nothing but a
[1:04:06] bunch of dogs I'd have seen that
[1:04:09] disappointed look and say well I won't
[1:04:11] have nothing to do with him at all it
[1:04:13] wasn't right to begin with I'll just go
[1:04:15] back over to my own church but not her
[1:04:18] she had Faith she wasn't in a hotbed
[1:04:21] plant a hybrid some like like some of
[1:04:24] them today that called themselves
[1:04:26] Believers can't sit still a minute to
[1:04:28] the gospel
[1:04:30] that's what we got today a bunch of hot
[1:04:32] bed plants you have to Baby them all the
[1:04:35] time keep them sprayed the bugs off of
[1:04:37] them that's right and then goes back to
[1:04:39] that kitten see baby them like a kitten
[1:04:41] rubbing is for one one way and he'll
[1:04:44] purr but rub it back once and it shows
[1:04:47] what's in him can you say man
[1:04:50] and so we finding that in this age
[1:04:54] we're really seeing
[1:04:56] what is in in US
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:00] because anyone who is a lamb of God are
[1:05:03] led by God
[1:05:06] 's going to have his Sovereign way
[1:05:09] not just his way but it's a sovereign
[1:05:11] way it's and Sovereign is it it's not
[1:05:15] attached to anything it's it's he and he
[1:05:18] alone
[1:05:19] he makes the decisions over our lives
[1:05:22] he plans Our Lives not us
[1:05:25] he directs our lives and it's it's no
[1:05:28] other influence but he himself the
[1:05:29] shepherd ain't that right
[1:05:32] and then but you notice what Jesus
[1:05:34] requires
[1:05:36] notice what this Shepherd requires
[1:05:40] for those who follow him
[1:05:43] Matthew 16 24 then said Jesus unto his
[1:05:46] disciples If any man will come after me
[1:05:49] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:05:53] cross and follow me
[1:05:56] and whosoever will save his life shall
[1:05:58] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[1:06:00] for my sake shall find it
[1:06:03] is why you you can't try to follow him
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:08] without first having a sheep like nature
[1:06:13] because that's a sacrificial animal
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:20] sacrifice is a hard thing
[1:06:25] brother Brown said we want to make the
[1:06:27] sacrifice out of will something easy
[1:06:30] he said that's not a sacrifice
[1:06:33] sacrifice is something that hurts
[1:06:36] and cuts
[1:06:38] that's what is a sacrifice
[1:06:41] he said you're glad to bring somebody
[1:06:43] else to church you're glad to put
[1:06:44] flowers on the Altar and do a little
[1:06:46] charitable Deeds which is all right
[1:06:49] but are you the lamb
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:52] then you're the one that God wants on
[1:06:54] the altar it's a sacrificial life giving
[1:06:58] yourself completely into his will
[1:07:03] foreign
[1:07:06] did not Jesus tell us to pray
[1:07:10] teach us to pray Our Father which art in
[1:07:13] heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:07:16] thy kingdom come
[1:07:19] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:07:23] heaven
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:27] how can that prayer be fully
[1:07:30] fully set from heart from our heart
[1:07:35] if if we have the nature of a goat
[1:07:38] nature of a wolf
[1:07:41] nature outside of the nature of a sheep
[1:07:45] can you say man
[1:07:47] we're not to tell him what we're going
[1:07:50] to do
[1:07:52] we're we're not to tell him the plans
[1:07:55] that we have made
[1:07:58] we come to him as sheep
[1:08:00] and we treat him as the shepherd thy
[1:08:04] will be done
[1:08:05] thy kingdom come
[1:08:08] you do what you think best for me
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:12] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:17] David knew he was an honored to be king
[1:08:20] and he knew there would have come a time
[1:08:21] that he would be king but for now
[1:08:25] the Lord's leading me somewhere else
[1:08:28] I'm walking in a path of sacrifice
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:33] what we don't know is God was molding
[1:08:36] David or what David may have not known
[1:08:38] at that time
[1:08:39] he was molding David can you see man
[1:08:43] brother Brian said now you're going to
[1:08:45] have to sacrifice not man and money
[1:08:47] you're going to have to sacrifice what
[1:08:50] some of your own ideas
[1:08:52] you're going to have to sacrifice some
[1:08:54] time in prayer
[1:08:56] you're going to have to sacrifice maybe
[1:08:58] that stubborn wheel to break down in
[1:09:00] humility
[1:09:02] you're going to have to he says the
[1:09:03] whole Christian move is sacrificial
[1:09:06] he that will follow me let him deny
[1:09:09] himself let him take up his cross and
[1:09:11] follow me daily
[1:09:13] so he says how often do you have to
[1:09:16] sacrifice
[1:09:17] every day
[1:09:21] ain't that right
[1:09:22] for Paul says I Die daily
[1:09:26] all Lambs of God
[1:09:30] you love him
[1:09:32] I've thought of the Prophet talking of
[1:09:34] the Queen of Sheba
[1:09:36] and he describes how that there was that
[1:09:39] longing in that Queen when she heard of
[1:09:41] the Living God
[1:09:42] working through solemn
[1:09:46] and the wisdom of God and oh it reached
[1:09:49] her ears of the stories and
[1:09:52] it was so burning in her that she says
[1:09:54] I'm going
[1:09:56] and we just think well maybe just
[1:09:58] getting up and getting the car and going
[1:10:00] to like we would Walmart or something
[1:10:02] but no
[1:10:03] she had across the desert for months
[1:10:07] she had to go through things that well
[1:10:09] brother Brown said you know she talked
[1:10:11] to her maybe talked to her bishop or a
[1:10:14] priest and her priest says Ah that's
[1:10:15] nothing of the devil but thus it was
[1:10:18] still burning in her heart I gotta go I
[1:10:21] gotta go and and he said well if you go
[1:10:24] you're going to be excommunicated we
[1:10:26] ain't gonna have nothing to do with your
[1:10:27] church one but she had to make the
[1:10:29] sacrifice
[1:10:31] she had to go in that hot burning desert
[1:10:33] when there's when there's there's
[1:10:35] thieves and robbers and and all of that
[1:10:38] her life she's putting her life in
[1:10:41] danger but she made the sacrifice
[1:10:46] to see the Living God
[1:10:49] all the Lambs of God
[1:10:52] look at us how we've made sacrifice
[1:10:54] after sacrifice
[1:10:57] maybe content with our organizations our
[1:11:00] denominations or whatever you hear of
[1:11:03] people that had their Prestige and and
[1:11:05] was moving up the ladder but when they
[1:11:07] heard the message they left it all
[1:11:10] to see a living God
[1:11:12] and sometimes even as a church we have
[1:11:15] to sacrifice things
[1:11:17] see a living God
[1:11:19] to see God moving Among Us sacrifice
[1:11:22] things give up that television give up
[1:11:25] the movies give up whatever that is
[1:11:27] holding back
[1:11:29] from the blessings of God from coming
[1:11:32] into your home
[1:11:34] can you say Amen
[1:11:36] see sacrifice but sheep sacrificed
[1:11:38] they're the only ones because they're
