[37:24] purpose his will
[37:27] and the word of God is his
[37:30] will and that's uh something important
[37:34] for us is to know and to understand is
[37:37] the word of God being his will that is
[37:41] why we're here is to
[37:43] accomplish what he wants brother brandom
[37:46] said God wants to fulfill his word and
[37:50] he don't have any hands but mine and
[37:52] yours he don't have any eyes but mine
[37:55] and yours he has no tongue but mine and
[37:57] yours I am the vine you are the branches
[38:01] the branches bear the fruit the vine
[38:04] energizes the branch so the body is
[38:07] energized by the spirit of God brother
[38:12] brandham another place he energizes us
[38:14] and we bring forth his life as he brings
[38:18] it through us whether it's preaching the
[38:21] gospel by lip or it's seeing Vision by
[38:24] eye or whatever
[38:27] uh or whether it's whatever it is laying
[38:29] hands on the sick where whatever it is
[38:32] it's Christ working through the branches
[38:36] of his church or members of his body see
[38:40] every office
[38:42] literally everybody say
[38:45] literally every office literally
[38:49] electrified by his
[38:51] presence now that's everyone that's in
[38:54] the body is El terrified by his
[38:59] presence that that just blows my
[39:02] mind
[39:04] because to be part of the members of his
[39:09] body and his life coming in that body
[39:12] electrifying us quickening us it's in
[39:17] the it's it's
[39:19] for his purpose God made man for the
[39:24] purpose of achieving
[39:27] and and throughout time uh man has
[39:31] always tried to achieve he's full of
[39:34] goals he's full of vision he's full of
[39:38] motives he's full of ambition a man that
[39:41] don't have ambition something
[39:44] wrong uh and and but he was designed to
[39:50] achieve uh so this is why he would be
[39:53] full of ambition and things and but but
[39:57] the problem is is man has has tried to
[40:02] achieve it on his own he he wanted to do
[40:06] it within himself and the prophet said
[40:08] that's where he makes his
[40:10] mistake is he leaves God out of the
[40:13] picture when he does that and and so and
[40:18] and and so this is what happened in the
[40:21] beginning uh and uh and what caused the
[40:24] fall and and it continues to happen and
[40:28] and and so it it it uh uh you know after
[40:33] the fall man and uh Adam and Eve it
[40:36] wasn't too long that we read where man
[40:40] had had just become so ambitious he was
[40:43] achieving he was but but in in his
[40:46] achievement he polluted the Earth and
[40:50] and so much so that God repented it it
[40:55] it grieved God that he would even make
[40:57] man and and because uh man had gotten in
[41:02] such a condition uh uh and and God uh
[41:06] finally uh determined to destroy the the
[41:10] the Earth destroy man and but but see
[41:15] man Man was created in the image of God
[41:20] and he was made in the image of God and
[41:23] so God give him that Dominion not just
[41:26] to sit here on Earth without achieving
[41:29] anything but he gave him something
[41:32] whereby he could
[41:34] achieve and and and and so he was given
[41:37] dominion and authority over the earth
[41:40] and the prophet said he was made to do
[41:43] something for
[41:45] God it it wasn't that man was just left
[41:48] alone for his own Ambitions he was made
[41:51] to do something for God and and so but
[41:55] he when he lost his fellowship with God
[41:59] and then the prophet said he then became
[42:02] a unit of his own without God so he
[42:06] makes his cities he makes his technology
[42:10] all the inventions and yet it's without
[42:13] God and and and again uh it's it's just
[42:18] coming to to uh um well it's becoming a
[42:22] mess is what it is and so man he didn't
[42:26] depend on God anymore wanted to think on
[42:29] himself and then then what does man do
[42:33] he began to have selfish
[42:36] motives he still had motives he still
[42:39] had agenda he still had purposes he
[42:41] still had goals but they became selfish
[42:45] he became selfish so selfish motives
[42:48] selfish desires selfish Vision selfish
[42:52] motiv selfish everything and and and so
[42:56] when well then then what happens is man
[42:58] is a failure in himself to begin with
[43:03] right without God we nothing and and
[43:07] that's what Jesus said without me you
[43:09] can do nothing and and and he wasn't
[43:11] saying that you're just become a zombie
[43:14] amen but he said it without me no matter
[43:17] how religious you are you'll never be
[43:19] able to come and arrive to what what
[43:22] I've made you to be without me you
[43:24] you'll never come to eternal life uh yes
[43:26] they're trying to look young they're
[43:28] trying to sustain life but you'll never
[43:30] be able to do it without him they've
[43:32] been trying to make a millennium but
[43:33] they'll never be able to do it without
[43:35] him they they've been trying forever
[43:38] amen to reconcile man with God it'll
[43:41] never happen without him can you say man
[43:44] so man is a failure to begin with and
[43:47] and so we can see all all throughout the
[43:49] Bible that without God man is a failure
[43:52] look at David for for example when he
[43:55] did God a service outside of God's Will
[44:00] and what happened he failed in in what
[44:02] he done he should have consulted God but
[44:05] he had this great idea good idea and he
[44:08] was actually going to do God a service
[44:10] and and yet it was out side of God's
[44:13] will consider Moses when he tried on his
[44:16] own to deliver God's people he found out
[44:18] that he was a he was a failure he was
[44:20] called to deliver he was called to do it
[44:23] but he done it outside of God's help and
[44:27] when he done it he become a failure and
[44:30] see so what makes us a failure is when
[44:33] we do things outside of God's will then
[44:37] then we become failures and and it it
[44:40] even may be achievements that we
[44:42] consider great but if God doesn't
[44:45] consider it great if God doesn't see it
[44:47] as something if it's not according to
[44:50] God's will then we're failures to begin
[44:52] with you understand what I'm saying amen
[44:55] this is why people live so they they
[44:57] find themselves successful if they have
[44:59] their name that the world looks to if if
[45:02] they they they they become the NBA uh
[45:05] basketball star you know or the football
[45:08] star if they win the Super Bowl and
[45:10] they're the one that led it or they were
[45:11] part of that they consider that success
[45:14] but when it comes all down to it it's
[45:16] not success without God you know and and
[45:19] Men strive for money and money money
[45:21] money money and then they put God on the
[45:23] back burner they put everything about
[45:25] God on the back burner now they're rich
[45:27] and they're driving these nice cars and
[45:29] nice homes nice clothes and they think
[45:32] they've achieved something well in this
[45:34] world they may have but God would
[45:36] consider it a failure it ain't going to
[45:39] get you nowhere in the end so you know
[45:43] it it what really it makes us a failure
[45:46] when we're not in the will of God now
[45:48] man turned to all of his strengths the
[45:52] prophet said and his power over the
[45:54] selfish desire years and achievements so
[45:58] so when he left God and and through the
[46:00] fall amen then then he turned all of his
[46:04] strengths all of his Ambitions all over
[46:08] all all of his powers everything that he
[46:11] was over to selfish desires and
[46:15] achievements amen and so in in the days
[46:19] of Noah uh uh God said you know the end
[46:22] of All Flesh has come before me for the
[46:25] Earth is filled with violence through
[46:27] them and behold I will destroy them with
[46:30] the Earth amen see well then you know
[46:35] then man comes back through uh uh on the
[46:38] other side of the flood and then they
[46:40] start it all over again and then we read
[46:43] about Sodom and gomorah and and and in
[46:46] the days of lot amen the Bible says the
[46:49] men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners
[46:52] before the Lord
[46:54] exceedingly and and there in Genesis 24
[46:58] or 1924 then the Lord reigned upon Sodom
[47:02] and upon go gamarra and brimstone and
[47:07] fire from the Lord out of heaven and he
[47:10] overthrew those cities and all the plain
[47:13] and all the inhabitants of the city uh
[47:16] and that which grew up on the ground
[47:20] then in the 27th verse he says and
[47:23] Abraham get up early in the morning to
[47:25] the place where he stood before the Lord
[47:27] and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah
[47:30] and toward all the land of the plain and
[47:32] beheld and lo the smoke of the country
[47:35] went up as the smoke of a furnace God
[47:38] destroyed it all they they had become
[47:42] ambitious in them own selves and before
[47:44] you know it so perverted that that they
[47:47] that men were sleeping with men women
[47:49] with women and even when the two angels
[47:52] went down uh uh the men tried to grab
[47:55] the uh uh them angels to have sex acts
[47:59] and and all of that it it was such a
[48:01] feel and and notice brother brandham
[48:04] says all the time these things are going
[48:07] on the spirit of the Living God is
[48:10] driving with flesh trying to get man
[48:13] away from his own achievements trying to
[48:16] get man away from his own selfish
[48:19] motives and objectives to a plan which
[48:24] God has laid down
[48:26] see to a plan that God has laid down and
[48:29] as long as man Works in his own plan he
[48:33] will be a failure you understand that
[48:36] young people you you young couples just
[48:38] starting out and and these things as
[48:40] long as you work in your own plan you're
[48:42] a
[48:43] failure that's is true see man can only
[48:47] achieve right when he comes back with
[48:50] the right objective and the right motive
[48:53] and that is according to God's plan for
[48:57] him can you say amen amen that's why
[49:00] marriages are failing homes are falling
[49:02] apart the the world is falling apart and
[49:05] all of that because it's not built upon
[49:08] God's plan for their lives and so now in
[49:14] this day Jesus prophesied that there
[49:16] would be a day just like in the days of
[49:19] Noah and just like in the days of lot
[49:22] and and we know we know that beyond the
[49:24] shadow of we're living in that day how
[49:27] many believes that amen we're living in
[49:30] that day amen and and so uh as which
[49:34] means as God destroyed uh uh the world
[49:37] in Noah's day and as God uh destroyed
[49:40] Sodom and gamarra in lot's day amen he
[49:44] he's going to he's going to destroy the
[49:46] world in this day except this time there
[49:49] will be a total
[49:50] Annihilation uh uh uh in other words the
[49:53] sin would be totally gone with the the
[49:55] wickedness will be totally annihilated
[49:58] the devil The Sinner the a his angels
[50:01] and all of that he's God's going to
[50:03] totally annihilate uh the sickness and
[50:06] diseases and germs and and uh the
[50:09] thistles and all that and there's going
[50:11] to be a complete renovation can you say
[50:15] Amen a complete renovation of the
[50:18] heavens and the Earth amen the Bible
[50:20] says old things will pass away and all
[50:23] things will become new so this isn't
[50:26] going to be just like like the flood and
[50:28] then wickedness starts After the flood
[50:31] and and it ain't going to be like Sodom
[50:33] and gomor and then we have a repeat as
[50:35] we are today of what Sodom and Gomorrah
[50:38] there'll be no other repeat again it'll
[50:40] be a new eeden a restored Eden and there
[50:43] will be no sin no sickness no sorrow no
[50:46] loneliness no heartbreak there will be
[50:49] no tempter Amen to deal with like Adam
[50:52] and Eve
[50:53] did think of that am praise the Lord
[50:57] he'll be
[50:58] gone God's going to restore his Eden but
[51:01] before this happens before this happens
[51:05] and we know we're right in the
[51:06] milliseconds of time then then God uh uh
[51:11] has has come in this day to claim a
[51:16] group of people that he himself has
[51:20] redeemed amen now you think of the power
[51:23] of that Redemption so much is the Power
[51:25] that God never looks at that group of
[51:27] people as Sinners
[51:30] again once they're baptized in the body
[51:33] of Christ once they're sealed in he
[51:36] never considers them a sinner never
[51:38] looks at you brother Bill as a sinner
[51:41] again
[51:43] hallelu Lord that's why you must look in
[51:45] the word as a mirror and not just your
[51:48] regular
[51:49] mirror and don't let the devil show you
[51:51] the mirror of your past there is no past
[51:56] under the
[51:59] blood so we find that God predestinated
[52:03] this people though to fulfill his word
[52:07] yes something that he failed to do
[52:10] something that Adam fail to do God has
[52:13] now ordained Us in this day to fulfill
[52:17] his word in this age but in order to do
[52:21] this he had to redeem this group of
[52:23] people and I'm saying us here this
[52:25] morning and people around this world
[52:28] Universal amen that he had to redeem us
[52:32] in order to bring us into fellowship
[52:35] with him come back to being united with
[52:39] him come back to a dependency on him
[52:43] come back to True motives true Ambitions
[52:46] to where all of our strength is not uh
[52:50] uh uh uh uh directed to a selfish
[52:53] motives but to God's motive
[52:55] God's will everything about us is
[52:59] consumed to do his
[53:02] will now this group of people he wrote
[53:05] their names on the Lamb's Book of Life
[53:07] before the foundation of the world and
[53:08] he promised to take out a people take a
[53:12] people out of the Gentiles for his
[53:15] name and they are to be his bride and as
[53:18] we know that it's in this day that they
[53:20] bear the name Miss Jesus Christ now
[53:23] think of that and so brother brandom
[53:26] talks about it uh there has been
[53:28] churches churches Brides brides churches
[53:30] Brides brides but there has got to come
[53:35] one now he knew you
[53:38] coming he knew it he knew this message
[53:40] would produce
[53:43] you you know some i' I've heard that you
[53:47] know some parents say that their
[53:49] children need to go out in the world and
[53:51] all that to really experience the grace
[53:53] of God what hog was
[53:55] what a lie of the
[53:57] devil I think it's powerful that God
[54:00] could take young people that have never
[54:02] experienced these things amen and
[54:04] they're a product of the message of the
[54:07] hour they don't have to go be Baptist to
[54:10] experience the preciousness of this
[54:12] message they they don't have to go to
[54:14] the Pentecost like I did we raised in
[54:16] the Pentecostal era amen and and
[54:19] traditions and all that to appreciate
[54:21] the message of the hour you can
[54:23] appreciate the fact that God called you
[54:26] not to be part of that and and you don't
[54:28] have to go through all the junk and
[54:30] detox and all of these things but you
[54:33] can take the message of the hour and
[54:35] find it really precious in your in in
[54:37] your heart there has to come one
[54:40] Hallelujah says there has to come a real
[54:44] bride a real bride there must come one
[54:48] that's not only got the mechanics but
[54:50] the Dynamics of it this ministry is not
[54:53] about mechanics it's Dynam
[54:56] Dynamics mechanics and Dynamics coming
[55:00] together and he says see it makes the
[55:03] church makes that church live move in
[55:07] the power of his
[55:09] resurrection did you realize the prophet
[55:12] called this bride the bride coming of
[55:15] Christ can you say that with me the
[55:18] bride coming of Christ that's the truth
[55:21] think of that she's not just a little
[55:23] bride she's the bride
[55:25] coming of Christ people talking about
[55:28] Christ coming you might ought to
[55:31] look all right cuz he'll he's never
[55:34] promised he's never promised that his
[55:37] Corporal body his physical body will
[55:39] will come to the Earth and and and and
[55:43] and talk with us like now he he promised
[55:47] though that we would meet him in the
[55:50] air now I know people don't believe even
[55:52] in that but the Bible says it
[55:56] now somehow they say brother brandham uh
[55:58] changed all that I don't believe that no
[56:01] I believe these these so-called
[56:02] intellectual preachers have changed
[56:05] it you ain't going to find that in the
[56:07] word of God now I don't know how that's
[56:09] going to happen I don't know where I
[56:11] don't know how the Bible says we're
[56:13] going to meet him in the
[56:14] air can you say Amen so it ain't up to
[56:18] me to figure it out it's just up to me
[56:19] to believe
[56:21] it ain't that right but and until he
[56:25] does the son of man is revealed on the
[56:28] Earth right now and he is the same in
[56:32] every
[56:33] way same in Attitude same in desire same
[56:37] in motive same in power same in
[56:40] everything but his physical
[56:43] body who is it it's his bride he is
[56:47] living in his bride and is the bride
[56:51] coming of
[56:52] Christ can you say Amen amen I love it
[56:56] now we being predestinated are the
[56:58] members of the body of Christ so brother
[57:02] Braham says he has sent forth his holy
[57:05] spirit remember the prophet said in the
[57:07] Feast of trumpets that for 2,000 years
[57:10] the Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[57:13] denominational Rivers but is to be
[57:16] loosed in the evening time by the
[57:19] evening time
[57:21] messenger so he has sent forth his holy
[57:24] SP Spirit to continue his ministry in
[57:28] the
[57:31] church until he returns in a physical
[57:35] body ain't that right see so he's not
[57:40] going to reveal himself to the
[57:43] world as everybody thinks he's going to
[57:45] be the traditional thought of the
[57:47] Rapture is the the literal graves are
[57:49] going to open literally there's going to
[57:51] be holes all in the
[57:53] earth people's going to stop what
[57:55] they're doing and they're all going to
[57:57] look and seem that's not the way it's
[58:00] going to be now he promised to reveal
[58:03] himself to the
[58:05] Jews
[58:07] [Music]
[58:09] right the Lord that's right but you know
[58:11] what he's revealing himself right
[58:14] now revealing himself right now you're
[58:17] the only Bible that people will ever
[58:19] read you're the only God that people
[58:21] will ever see you are the body of Jesus
[58:24] Jesus Christ you are his
[58:27] bride there is a literal uh reality to
[58:31] that statement the bride coming of
[58:35] Christ that is true so he sent forth his
[58:39] holy spirit to continue his ministry in
[58:42] the church until he returns in a
[58:44] physical body notice again what the
[58:46] prophet says if the Church of the Living
[58:50] God is Not achieving what God purposed
[58:53] for them to do there's something wrong
[58:56] with that system somewhere it's just got
[58:59] to
[59:01] be all right come on
[59:04] now if the Church of the Living God is
[59:07] Not
[59:08] achieving what God purposed for them to
[59:12] do now we've read this before but
[59:15] brother Brown said Christ set the
[59:16] members in the body he endows them with
[59:20] their
[59:20] Ministries he puts the gifts at her
[59:24] disposal
[59:25] preaching is a gift healing is a gift
[59:28] singing is a gift music playing music is
[59:31] a gift speaking in tongues is a gift
[59:34] prophesying is a gift so brother Bram
[59:37] says they are all Ministry they are
[59:40] ministries of their own and notice
[59:44] here's the real key each man is
[59:46] commanded to wait everybody say to wait
[59:51] on his own
[59:53] Ministry amen again each man is
[59:57] commanded to wait on his own
[1:00:01] Ministry
[1:00:03] now is this not what happened to
[1:00:07] Eve didn't she could not
[1:00:12] wait hello God told them to replenish
[1:00:17] multiply and replenish the Earth that's
[1:00:19] right God had a plan for this to
[1:00:23] happen is that right she was Mary done
[1:00:27] what Eve was supposed to do be it unto
[1:00:31] me according to Thy word sir it was to
[1:00:33] be by Spoken Word but Eve could not
[1:00:38] wait Amen brother Bram said it was an
[1:00:42] oncoming thing it was a promise but
[1:00:45] Adam's bride couldn't
[1:00:48] wait see when Adam come to his wife she
[1:00:52] was pregnant she had done something she
[1:00:55] was pregnant with the corrupt seed from
[1:00:58] the serpent amen she was pregnated with
[1:01:01] the wrong
[1:01:03] seed amen through the wrong
[1:01:06] act can you amen every man is to wait
[1:01:11] commanded to wait on his own
[1:01:14] Ministry the Lord Proverbs
[1:01:17] 18:16 says a man's gift maketh room for
[1:01:21] him and bringeth him before Great Men in
[1:01:25] ain't that right so your gift makes room
[1:01:29] for you you don't have to make it happen
[1:01:33] you don't have to force it you don't
[1:01:36] have to be jealous because God's using
[1:01:38] somebody
[1:01:40] else your gift will make room for
[1:01:45] youlu and you will fit the
[1:01:48] gift that's true amen see so every
[1:01:52] member inside the Body of Christ that's
[1:01:55] part of the body is commanded to wait
[1:01:58] sometimes I I wonder what motivates some
[1:02:01] of these young ministers that wants to
[1:02:04] be full-time
[1:02:06] evangelists and you know they they'll go
[1:02:08] quit their
[1:02:09] jobs you know and and before you know it
[1:02:12] then they get jealous because God's
[1:02:14] using someone else another young man and
[1:02:17] wondering why they can't be
[1:02:19] that you got to be wait you got to wait
[1:02:22] for your
[1:02:23] gift God may have not called you to be
[1:02:25] that he may have called you to be a
[1:02:27] minister but he may have not called you
[1:02:28] to be full-time
[1:02:31] evangelist but sometimes you wonder what
[1:02:33] the motive is you you wonder what
[1:02:35] motivates these young men to want to be
[1:02:37] pastors when they can't sit under
[1:02:40] one you understand what I'm saying see
[1:02:43] God sets gifts in the
[1:02:46] body and even though Moses was trained
[1:02:49] even though Moses was told for since a
[1:02:52] young man a young child child that he
[1:02:55] was to be called to be the leader to
[1:02:58] deliver the people he had to wait on the
[1:03:02] gift ain't that right amen he made a
[1:03:05] mess of himself did he
[1:03:07] not see so God sets these gifts in the
[1:03:12] body it's it's kind of like we could
[1:03:14] take this room here and and as as though
[1:03:17] it's the body of Christ and you come
[1:03:21] into this come in and and then you see
[1:03:26] what what what's in in the room there's
[1:03:29] pews that are in the room that's a
[1:03:31] gift there there's a Pulpit for me to
[1:03:35] put my Bible and that's a
[1:03:37] gift there there's the Pian that we
[1:03:40] could worship with that that's a gift
[1:03:43] the drums are a gift the organ get to
[1:03:45] our base gifts right God God's put gifts
[1:03:50] right in in the church we got sound
[1:03:52] system gifts to some
[1:03:57] and and and we got the projectors and
[1:04:00] now we don't have to have s books or
[1:04:02] gifts we got
[1:04:04] pictures I I consider these gifts
[1:04:08] valuable gifts he and and and they're
[1:04:11] gifts right so the prophet say see but
[1:04:14] by one Spirit we can't just act now we
[1:04:16] can all come in here that's fine
[1:04:18] anyone's welcome to come in here as long
[1:04:20] as they behave themselves and be a
[1:04:22] brother but but but you not just anybody
[1:04:25] can come into the body they have to be
[1:04:28] elected called blessed is the man whom
[1:04:31] thou choosest Ain ain't that right and
[1:04:34] and the only way you can come into the
[1:04:36] body is by being baptized by one one
[1:04:40] Spirit there ain't no other doors into
[1:04:42] this into the body you have to come in
[1:04:45] by one Spirit into one body it's a
[1:04:49] spiritual baptism can you say amen and
[1:04:53] then when when we come into the body by
[1:04:55] that one Spirit we are subject to any
[1:04:59] gift that's what the prophet said to any
[1:05:01] of these gifts the nine spiritual gifts
[1:05:03] amen and these things see but
[1:05:06] now don't make the gift all about the
[1:05:10] Christian
[1:05:12] Life
[1:05:15] right can you say
[1:05:18] Amen because you got to remember not
[1:05:20] only did Rebecca receive gifts but her
[1:05:22] family received gifts
[1:05:25] true the only deal with Rebecca she got
[1:05:27] the bridegroom amen Rebecca was called
[1:05:30] for the bridegroom the family wasn't
[1:05:32] even though they all got gifts that's
[1:05:35] true ain't that
[1:05:37] right see so you know Martin
[1:05:41] Luther the prophet said Martin Luther
[1:05:43] was so filled with the Holy Ghost till
[1:05:45] he spoke in
[1:05:47] tongues but in his diary he said if I
[1:05:50] taught that to the people they'll seek
[1:05:51] the gift instead of The Giver yeah yeah
[1:05:55] that's what Martin Luther
[1:05:56] felt now if we were part of the
[1:06:00] Corinthian
[1:06:02] Church then I'm sure brother Brandon
[1:06:04] would have felt the
[1:06:06] same we can't do this because they're
[1:06:09] Corinthians they're
[1:06:11] babies now he considered the
[1:06:12] Pentecostals babies what did they do
[1:06:16] just as the Corinthian Church went after
[1:06:18] the gifts centered on the gifts focused
[1:06:21] on the gifts instead of The
[1:06:23] Giver ain't that right but we are not
[1:06:26] the Corinthian Church we are the
[1:06:28] Ephesian
[1:06:30] Church am can you say Amen what was the
[1:06:34] Ephesians Paul would place them
[1:06:38] positionally Joshua would place them
[1:06:41] positionally in the
[1:06:43] land no one trying to take another one's
[1:06:46] place no one being jealous of another
[1:06:50] guy hello brother brand how you even get
[1:06:53] on to these
[1:06:55] businessmen trying to take the place of
[1:06:57] the preacher right felt like they were
[1:06:59] better they can run a business but you
[1:07:02] don't run a church like you do a
[1:07:05] business that's right ain't that right
[1:07:10] so Joshua could place the people in the
[1:07:14] promised land which was the second part
[1:07:17] of
[1:07:18] redemption so did God with send our
[1:07:21] Joshua this end time lead
[1:07:26] the Holy Ghost working through a
[1:07:30] prophet amen hello so this message is to
[1:07:35] place Us in the
[1:07:37] body didn't do away with gifts didn't
[1:07:41] take the pictures out of the body didn't
[1:07:43] take the pews
[1:07:45] out could you imagine we still wanting
[1:07:47] to have church but we take the pews out
[1:07:50] we take the pulpit out we take the music
[1:07:52] out we take the sound system out we take
[1:07:54] this everything
[1:07:57] out thank God for Windows but now we
[1:08:00] don't need them anymore take them
[1:08:02] out we take everything out then what do
[1:08:05] we
[1:08:06] have just the
[1:08:09] building nothing to work
[1:08:11] with but God placed gifts in the
[1:08:16] body can you say
[1:08:18] Amen because in that body there is a
[1:08:22] Ministry amen ain't that right yeah so
[1:08:27] in us being that we are an Ephesian
[1:08:30] Church we're not going after gifts we're
[1:08:32] going after The
[1:08:35] Giver can you say
[1:08:38] Amen we realize that gifts do not make a
[1:08:40] man
[1:08:46] spiritual the prophet said you can
[1:08:49] actually send your soul to hell with a
[1:08:50] Divine gift right ain't that right yes
[1:08:54] sir now we know that there are
[1:08:55] Ministries that operate outside the body
[1:08:57] of
[1:08:58] Christ there are people who are not in
[1:09:01] the body of Christ and and you know they
[1:09:05] they they operate genuine gifts
[1:09:08] sure not even filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:12] if you're not in the body you're not
[1:09:13] filled with the Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost yes and you
[1:09:18] sayen and yet they're operating genuine
[1:09:21] gifts Judah Judas was a a example of
[1:09:26] that balum was an example of that can
[1:09:30] you say
[1:09:31] men and and many others in the Bible so
[1:09:36] brother Bram said we know everybody say
[1:09:39] we know that in the last days there's
[1:09:42] going to be a Revival of Supernatural
[1:09:44] That's not going to be of
[1:09:48] God there's going to be a Revival of the
[1:09:52] Supernatural That's not not everybody
[1:09:54] say it's not going to be of God that's
[1:09:58] true that doesn't mean that the devil is
[1:09:59] going to work the
[1:10:01] supernatural
[1:10:03] hello amen for Jesus told us how it's
[1:10:06] going to happen the the father make in
[1:10:09] heaven maketh his son to rise on the
[1:10:11] evil and on the good and sendeth rain on
[1:10:14] the just and on the
[1:10:16] unjust ain't that right the same rain
[1:10:19] that falls on your crop that you planted
[1:10:22] is the same rain that fall falls upon
[1:10:24] the concrete that falls upon the W the
[1:10:26] the thorns and the Fizzles is the same
[1:10:29] rain that could not just causes your
[1:10:31] crop of corn your crop of beans or
[1:10:33] whatever to grow it also causes the the
[1:10:36] the weeds to grow that you have to keep
[1:10:38] plucking out to keep your garden
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:42] clean hello that's right now Matthew 7
[1:10:46] and22 many will say to me in that day
[1:10:49] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:10:50] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:10:52] devils and in thy name done many
[1:10:54] wonderful works then I will profess unto
[1:10:56] them I never knew you depart from me ye
[1:10:59] that work iniquity they they prophesied
[1:11:02] in his
[1:11:04] name they cast out devils in his
[1:11:08] name they they done Miracles and signs
[1:11:11] in his name and used that as a great
[1:11:17] resume come on now and the Lord didn't
[1:11:19] say oh you are something else I didn't
[1:11:23] even know you existed in there no I'm so
[1:11:26] glad no not God no he says depart from
[1:11:31] me never knew you in other words I never
[1:11:34] had intimate relationship with you
[1:11:36] that's right I never induced you with my
[1:11:39] power I never filled
[1:11:43] you hello that's right had
[1:11:47] gifts so the rain comes from the same
[1:11:50] Source but it falls on two different
[1:11:52] seeds amen now notice the difference
[1:11:55] between the two seeds brother Bri said
[1:11:59] man has gifts and things but watch
[1:12:02] everybody say but
[1:12:04] watch but watch so what do we watch
[1:12:07] watch what's behind
[1:12:10] it Satan can't impersonate anything
[1:12:13] almost he is an impersonator he can
[1:12:16] impersonate but watch the kind of a
[1:12:20] voice that it is okay
[1:12:24] what's it saying what's it leading you
[1:12:27] to what's it pointing to amen and you
[1:12:31] say
[1:12:32] Amen see so God has set gifts in his
[1:12:36] body in his body in his church for the
[1:12:41] work of the ministry and these gifts in
[1:12:46] that body are under a headship amen
[1:12:51] ain't that right so the the ministry is
[1:12:54] under the headship Colossians 1:18 he is
[1:12:57] the head of the body the church and what
[1:13:00] is he the word the word Vindicated the
[1:13:04] Vindicated word the manifested word is
[1:13:07] the head of the
[1:13:09] body praise the Lord come on now
[1:13:13] amen so we're controlled by one head do
[1:13:18] you believe that not two heads to a
[1:13:20] body
[1:13:22] right said be a freak
[1:13:25] body so notice now you are baptized in
[1:13:31] the
[1:13:32] domain of that Kingdom one spiritual
[1:13:37] baptism Lord no matter how good how bad
[1:13:41] whatever you're in that Kingdom by the
[1:13:45] Holy Ghost
[1:13:48] baptism and you say Amen so so now that
[1:13:51] you're into this body you been baptized
[1:13:54] into the body you're under his
[1:13:58] domain Lord so I looked up I looked up
[1:14:02] domain it means complete and absolute
[1:14:04] ownership of of of land a territory over
[1:14:09] which Dominion is
[1:14:10] exercised so now gifts he put gifts in
[1:14:14] the body he placed you in the body by a
[1:14:19] spiritual baptism now the gift and you
[1:14:23] you and your ministry is under his
[1:14:27] domain you now become his
[1:14:31] territory you now become under his the
[1:14:35] control of his influence the Lord can
[1:14:38] you say Amen so now uh uh it's the
[1:14:44] territory in in which his Dominion is
[1:14:47] exercised that that's what it is so
[1:14:49] brother Brown says see God sits on the
[1:14:51] throne of your heart in his not yours
[1:14:55] his control room amen controlling your
[1:14:59] emotions controlling your powers
[1:15:02] controlling your
[1:15:04] conceptions and making you one with him
[1:15:08] in
[1:15:09] fellowship and in
[1:15:12] love what a people he's coming
[1:15:15] forlu and God fills you with love he
[1:15:19] fills you with power he fills you with
[1:15:22] the spirit he fills you with his own
[1:15:24] divine nature and he changes your carnal
[1:15:27] nature into his nature then in this you
[1:15:31] become a new creation in
[1:15:34] Christ can you say Amen see so when a
[1:15:38] man is trying to understand the Bible or
[1:15:40] the
[1:15:41] message uh by an intellectual conception
[1:15:44] he cannot believe it all he just can't
[1:15:48] because he's he's going by
[1:15:50] intellectual and so so somewhere he he's
[1:15:53] going to start reasoning it away well I
[1:15:55] I don't really know about that let let
[1:15:57] let problems come really
[1:15:59] hard now we can believe God for simple
[1:16:02] things but when it really comes
[1:16:06] impossible I mean
[1:16:10] impossible then if we're not careful
[1:16:12] we'll go to intellect and start
[1:16:13] reasoning well I don't see how that can
[1:16:16] happen I I I because you well of course
[1:16:19] you know I remember the last time
[1:16:21] someone got prayed for for cancer they
[1:16:22] died
[1:16:24] and all of a sudden you start reasoning
[1:16:27] yes sir in just instead of taking God at
[1:16:30] his
[1:16:31] word
[1:16:33] hello and if you get to reasoning too
[1:16:35] long if you're a minister you'll start
[1:16:38] bypassing that
[1:16:39] stuff you won't preach the power of God
[1:16:42] in it's all its
[1:16:44] reality cuz how you going to explain if
[1:16:47] someone dies of cancer and yet you're
[1:16:49] telling that God will answer prayers God
[1:16:52] heals God does all all these things and
[1:16:53] if you're not careful you start leaning
[1:16:55] to your own reasonings and your own
[1:16:59] intellects hello come
[1:17:01] on right but God's going to get a people
[1:17:04] that will actually be under his
[1:17:07] domain and under his control that simply
[1:17:11] takes God at his word you don't have to
[1:17:14] explain anything just believe
[1:17:19] it amen can you say Amen am so Satan
[1:17:24] controls the intellectual part of man
[1:17:27] therefore he will cause the person to
[1:17:29] reason with the word when he cannot
[1:17:32] understand it because as the prophet
[1:17:34] said he's looking at the word
[1:17:37] intellectually you may not be able to
[1:17:39] understand this word all always and
[1:17:44] actually if you just brother Brown
[1:17:47] plainly tells us you cannot read this
[1:17:48] Bible like you would a
[1:17:50] newspaper anyone has to when you really
[1:17:53] read this Bible you have to read between
[1:17:55] the lines you have to read in the spirit
[1:17:57] that it was given
[1:18:01] that's well that's the same thing about
[1:18:04] the message you have to understand the
[1:18:06] message in between the lines I know
[1:18:09] people picking this message apart but
[1:18:11] shoot that ain't nothing new it's the
[1:18:13] same old devil that's used people to try
[1:18:15] to pick this Bible
[1:18:17] apart they pick the Bible apart so it's
[1:18:19] automatically they're going to pick this
[1:18:21] message apart right well it's true
[1:18:25] that's right they say it was all written
[1:18:27] by man there ain't nothing about that
[1:18:28] inspired well then they say well the
[1:18:30] brother BR was just a man there ain't
[1:18:31] nothing about inspired come on now see
[1:18:35] it's carnal Minds intellectual Minds
[1:18:37] trying to reason with the message of the
[1:18:40] hour well well good grief we've already
[1:18:43] had a prophet tell us you don't
[1:18:45] understand it that
[1:18:46] way you got to fall in love with the
[1:18:49] author to understand this Bible you got
[1:18:52] to fall in love with God to even
[1:18:56] understand the message of the hour and
[1:18:58] you understand the message under by The
[1:19:00] Same Spirit that the prophet gave it he
[1:19:04] was under inspiration and your your
[1:19:07] understanding must be under that same
[1:19:09] inspiration yeah the prophet said this
[1:19:11] and well then you go over here and and
[1:19:13] it contradicts or you go in the Bible
[1:19:15] and it makes it look like the prophet
[1:19:16] contradicted the Bible no it's you
[1:19:19] contradicting the Bible it's you making
[1:19:22] the prophet and the Bible contradict one
[1:19:24] another if you're not careful you'll
[1:19:26] make Matthew Luke and John contradicting
[1:19:29] one
[1:19:31] another it's the same intellectual
[1:19:34] devil right
[1:19:39] Hallelujah so we cannot when you look at
[1:19:42] the word of God intellectually you
[1:19:44] cannot achieve things for God that
[1:19:48] way brother Braham said but let that
[1:19:51] same man take what little knowledge he
[1:19:53] has in his head and give it over to God
[1:19:56] and let the spirit of the Living God
[1:19:57] come down into that heart of his he'll
[1:20:00] call every word of God the truth and
[1:20:03] every promise Divine then everybody say
[1:20:06] then then he can achieve for
[1:20:09] God then he can achieve for God see God
[1:20:13] gave us his word God gave us the message
[1:20:16] God and and and and don't tell me amen
[1:20:18] and try to dissect the the the Bible
[1:20:20] from the message I say they're all one
[1:20:24] it was given by prophets it was written
[1:20:27] by prophets and so has this message been
[1:20:29] given by the most Vindicated Prophet
[1:20:32] there ever was on the face of the
[1:20:35] Earth so to try to separate and see
[1:20:37] which one is the better one come on now
[1:20:45] nonsense amen can you say
[1:20:49] amen he gave it to
[1:20:51] us that a man when a man woman boy or
[1:20:55] girl can truly believe it then he can
[1:20:58] cheve for God he can achieve for God see
[1:21:01] so God made a little compartment in each
[1:21:04] of our heart for
[1:21:06] himself that's his control room where he
[1:21:11] sits and controls Us Praise the Lord
[1:21:14] Brother brah said that's his place
[1:21:16] that's where he sends his messages from
[1:21:18] the control room how can he work with
[1:21:21] you notice the question now how can he
[1:21:24] work with you when the nature of the
[1:21:25] spirit of the devil is in
[1:21:29] there see if you're baptized in the in
[1:21:33] into the body then that spirit is gone
[1:21:37] prise the Lord that that that that's
[1:21:40] that's the important thing and that's
[1:21:42] why Satan tries to get everybody to
[1:21:44] bypass the spiritual
[1:21:48] birth is is because when when he comes
[1:21:52] in the devil
[1:21:54] leaves can you say amen and now God
[1:21:57] comes into that soul and that's his
[1:21:59] control tower not to control everybody
[1:22:02] else you can't help what everybody else
[1:22:04] does I can't that's that's that's why
[1:22:07] you know un unless you know just feel
[1:22:10] like the Lord just leads me to go some
[1:22:13] direction we ain't going to just blast
[1:22:16] people because you can't control
[1:22:21] them come on God has to set in that
[1:22:25] control
[1:22:29] tower right so he says every man born on
[1:22:34] Earth is born in sin shape and iniquity
[1:22:36] come to the world speaking lies that's
[1:22:38] right so in that carnal adamic nature
[1:22:41] how can a man achieve anything only by
[1:22:44] through his
[1:22:46] intellectuals and he's achieving a lot
[1:22:49] but he's a
[1:22:50] failure right everything that man does
[1:22:53] is going to
[1:22:56] fall so in the body you are
[1:23:00] baptized by one Spirit now you are his
[1:23:03] territory for the kingdom of God is
[1:23:07] within
[1:23:09] you I hope this
[1:23:12] okay can you say Amen if you haven't
[1:23:15] been baptized in the body you'll not be
[1:23:16] part of his
[1:23:18] domain now what is the kingdom of God
[1:23:21] brother Braham said his word made Power
[1:23:23] can you say that with me his word made
[1:23:26] Power his word that was here his word
[1:23:29] that was in the in the form of of of a
[1:23:31] message on tape and books and all that
[1:23:34] now has become made Power in you amen
[1:23:38] see the kingdoms in you the prophet says
[1:23:40] and when the word comes in there what
[1:23:42] does this word began it turns itself
[1:23:45] into Power making it say just exactly
[1:23:48] what it said you don't have to try to
[1:23:50] make it happen it turn turns itself into
[1:23:54] Power making it do and say exactly what
[1:23:57] it said it's not up to you to fulfill
[1:24:00] this word just be part of the
[1:24:03] body and you say Amen now see you can't
[1:24:06] say it says this and then it says this
[1:24:09] and make it work see you got to say the
[1:24:12] same thing it says that makes a
[1:24:14] confession not saying well it's polished
[1:24:16] up a little over here so I'll have some
[1:24:18] more wisdom I'll be better and better
[1:24:20] standing over here you stay with the
[1:24:23] word there it is see and it makes it
[1:24:26] power Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:24:29] today and
[1:24:30] forever can you say amen amen all right
[1:24:34] so John
[1:24:35] 14:12 Jesus said verily verily I say
[1:24:38] unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:24:39] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:24:41] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:24:44] because I go unto my father and
[1:24:45] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[1:24:48] will I do and the father that the father
[1:24:50] may be glorified in the son if you shall
[1:24:52] ask anything in my name I will do it
[1:24:54] what is that it's word do you believe
[1:24:57] that you believe it's the word or do you
[1:24:59] believe that someone just injected that
[1:25:01] in the Bible like I told you I was
[1:25:03] talking to that man that that didn't
[1:25:05] believe in Mark 11:23 he said somebody
[1:25:07] injected that that's that's
[1:25:09] uninspired but see if a man can believe
[1:25:11] it from his heart God having the control
[1:25:14] tower it makes that word turn into
[1:25:19] Power can you say Amen see John 15:7 if
[1:25:23] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:25:25] you you shall ask what you will and it
[1:25:28] shall be done unto you why you are
[1:25:31] baptized into his
[1:25:36] domain ain't that right so brother Bram
[1:25:39] said what is it you've got to get with
[1:25:40] the word get yourself killed out I'm
[1:25:44] persuaded that many of us friends have
[1:25:46] receive the Holy Ghost but we have just
[1:25:47] received enough holy ghost in us to make
[1:25:50] us uh uh to to a place place where we
[1:25:53] don't want to lie don't want to steal we
[1:25:55] don't want to do anything see but God
[1:25:57] wants to fill every fiber of his church
[1:26:00] he wants to feel your thinking he wants
[1:26:02] to feel your mind he wants to feel every
[1:26:04] bit of you just make you completely
[1:26:07] totally dead to yourself and to your
[1:26:09] thinking just so surrender in God till
[1:26:12] his word is just living right through
[1:26:14] you you don't know nothing else but
[1:26:17] God's word just stay right with his word
[1:26:19] it is life my words are life Jesus said
[1:26:23] he's placed with them teachers believing
[1:26:27] the Bible prophets that say the truth
[1:26:29] that say see show me the same prophecy
[1:26:32] that they've always did down through the
[1:26:34] age see or show they show the same
[1:26:36] prophecy what what's he done he's
[1:26:39] showing himself alive among them
[1:26:42] confirming his word see it's his word
[1:26:45] the kingdom of God is God's word made
[1:26:51] Power aren't you glad for that
[1:26:56] amen the kingdom of God the prophet said
[1:27:00] is made word and
[1:27:02] spirit in our own life Hallelujah ain't
[1:27:06] that right Lord so it brings to pass
[1:27:09] every
[1:27:11] promise every promise in this day as it
[1:27:14] did when the word and God was one in
[1:27:17] that day in Jesus's day ain't that right
[1:27:21] so now notice the word in God is one
[1:27:24] everybody say it's one one in his church
[1:27:30] today making it the headship of the body
[1:27:34] that is redeemed you know the prophet
[1:27:37] said there is not one
[1:27:39] hypocrite in the body of Christ there
[1:27:43] might be Hypocrites in Faith
[1:27:45] Tabernacle there might be Hypocrites in
[1:27:47] any
[1:27:49] church but in the body of Christ there's
[1:27:52] not one
[1:27:54] hypocrite amen every member of that body
[1:27:59] is pure unadulterated Sons and Daughters
[1:28:02] of God they believe his word from
[1:28:06] Genesis to Revelations and they stay
[1:28:10] with it Trials come but they stay with
[1:28:14] it torments come but they stay with it
[1:28:18] testings come but they stay with it
[1:28:20] failures come but they stay with it
[1:28:23] people come people go but they stay with
[1:28:26] it can you say Amen discouragements come
[1:28:29] but they stay with it see God tries you
[1:28:32] on every level but he knows you'll stay
[1:28:35] with it because you're part of his
[1:28:38] body talking about Proving
[1:28:43] Grounds he brings you to impossible
[1:28:45] situations but he knows you'll stay with
[1:28:47] the
[1:28:48] word there's your part of his
[1:28:51] body
[1:28:53] amen you love him
[1:28:55] amen notice brother Braham said and
[1:28:58] their life proves it that's true and God
[1:29:02] confirms his word to
[1:29:04] it and he says that's the
[1:29:08] Messiah the Lord that's the wife of
[1:29:11] Messiah see and God sets in that system
[1:29:15] teachers pastors prophets and so forth
[1:29:18] to keep that messiahship of is straight
[1:29:23] in there
[1:29:25] right that's why we keep preaching the
[1:29:28] promises of
[1:29:30] God hello that's why we stay with the
[1:29:34] message we study the message we study
[1:29:36] this
[1:29:38] word amen I ain't interested in what
[1:29:41] Charles Spurgeon has
[1:29:43] say he was fine in his day but he was
[1:29:45] you know did you know he was a smoked
[1:29:47] the cigars could you imagine taking that
[1:29:51] I know you get quiet on that but take
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:55] message any
[1:29:59] day can you say
[1:30:04] Amen so he says see that's the message
[1:30:08] that's the wife of Messiah and God sits
[1:30:12] in that system teachers pastors prophets
[1:30:15] and so forth to keep that messiahship of
[1:30:18] his straight in there see not not mixed
[1:30:22] up with denominational Creeds but weeds
[1:30:26] that thing out and keeps the church pure
[1:30:29] un adulterated to Christ and his
[1:30:33] word that's right
[1:30:35] amen aren't you glad for
[1:30:38] it that's why you should respect the men
[1:30:40] of
[1:30:42] God
[1:30:44] hello that's why I've always said if you
[1:30:46] can't have confidence in your pastor go
[1:30:48] find a pastor
[1:30:50] somewhere that you can
[1:30:52] follow
[1:30:54] amen cuz you know people say well you
[1:30:57] don't help me well if you'd respect the
[1:30:59] office brother BR says brother BR said
[1:31:02] pastor can't help you if you don't
[1:31:03] respect
[1:31:05] him so if you ain't getting
[1:31:07] help maybe you ought to change the
[1:31:11] attitude I'm not saying that's for
[1:31:13] anybody here but I'm just saying it's
[1:31:15] just true I'd say that to any church
[1:31:18] amen God puts that Ministry in there
[1:31:22] and it's not just the pastor god brother
[1:31:26] Terry brother Josiah brother brother
[1:31:27] Daniel brother Amos brother
[1:31:30] Andrew God puts them here in the church
[1:31:34] and when they're when they're preaching
[1:31:36] you you got to respect them things and
[1:31:38] and and as I've told these young men
[1:31:40] these young Brothers don't don't expect
[1:31:43] just because you're a preacher to get up
[1:31:44] here and just expect people to receive
[1:31:46] you live a
[1:31:49] life live something that the people can
[1:31:55] value ain't that
[1:31:57] right see so in the
[1:32:00] body think of that God has set teachers
[1:32:03] prophets pastors evangelists and so
[1:32:06] forth to keep that messiahship of his
[1:32:08] Strait Amen in the body
[1:32:11] amen now as I have said you know there
[1:32:15] are genu wine gifts that are operated by
[1:32:17] people who are outside of the body and
[1:32:19] and these people do not even have the
[1:32:21] Holy Ghost
[1:32:23] and which means that they're not under
[1:32:24] the domain of God they're not his
[1:32:28] territory and so this is why Jesus would
[1:32:31] tell us Matthew
[1:32:32] 24:23 breaking in If any man shall say
[1:32:35] unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[1:32:37] believe it not for there shall arise
[1:32:40] false Christ and false prophets and
[1:32:42] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:32:44] much if it were possible they shall
[1:32:46] deceive the very elect and and so we we
[1:32:50] can go to to balum again again who who
[1:32:52] was a false
[1:32:56] prophet he was a prophet like like Moses
[1:32:59] was Moses was a prophet in the same time
[1:33:02] as Moses there was balum but balum was
[1:33:06] false in that it wasn't his prophecy he
[1:33:09] prophesied and and and and the prophecy
[1:33:11] still coming to pass his prophecy was
[1:33:13] true but the prophet said his teaching
[1:33:16] was false that's what made him a false
[1:33:20] prophet
[1:33:25] yes sir I you know I mean you you got
[1:33:28] you got people saying all you know
[1:33:30] claiming to see Angels Kenneth Hagen was
[1:33:32] one of them that that that said he saw
[1:33:34] an angel come into his room I ain't
[1:33:36] going to dispute that I don't doubt that
[1:33:38] a bit but his teaching was
[1:33:40] false it was just plain as day
[1:33:44] false Joseph
[1:33:46] Smith the beginning of the Mormons said
[1:33:48] an angel came to him I don't doubt that
[1:33:50] a bit but but his teaching was
[1:33:52] false you understand what I'm saying see
[1:33:56] so so balum he he saw the angel he saw
[1:33:59] an angel too is donkey had to tell
[1:34:03] him that there was an angel
[1:34:06] there true
[1:34:12] amen just occurred to me you know women
[1:34:16] say they got to preach because men don't
[1:34:18] men don't ain't ain't fulfilling their
[1:34:20] job well
[1:34:23] both balam wouldn't listen to to God
[1:34:27] either but he didn't raise a woman he
[1:34:30] began to speak through the
[1:34:32] donkey so God don't change his mind if
[1:34:36] he if he has to bring a donkey or a
[1:34:39] monkey or a turkey or whatever he'll
[1:34:41] still speak his word but it won't be by
[1:34:42] a
[1:34:46] woman
[1:34:47] so so God spoke to the Donkey amen but
[1:34:53] notice his teaching was wrong it was
[1:34:56] false and the Bible says he taught the
[1:34:58] king baac to cast a stumbling block
[1:35:02] before the children of Israel so notice
[1:35:05] now he uses his
[1:35:08] ministry uses his
[1:35:12] ministry to cast a stumbling
[1:35:18] block right before the children of
[1:35:20] Israel to God wouldn't even forgive
[1:35:22] Israel for what they done and brother
[1:35:25] bandam said he polluted the whole Camp
[1:35:26] of Israel and yet God blessed
[1:35:31] balum he said look at the balms today in
[1:35:34] the field he said just look around
[1:35:36] prospering speaking in tongues sure
[1:35:39] using God's gifts to gain everything see
[1:35:42] but it defiles the whole church of god
[1:35:45] with their corrupt
[1:35:47] teaching think about it can you say Amen
[1:35:50] come on now
[1:35:52] Jesus the Bible says had a holy
[1:35:56] ghost well the prophet said a full Holy
[1:36:00] Ghost Ministry Jesus had a full Holy
[1:36:04] Ghost Ministry so acts
[1:36:06] 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
[1:36:10] with the Holy Ghost and with power who
[1:36:12] went about doing good healing all that
[1:36:14] were oppressed of the devil for God was
[1:36:16] with him what a Ministry he had right
[1:36:20] Matthew 10:1 though listen and when he
[1:36:23] had called unto him his 12 12 disciples
[1:36:28] he gave them power uh against unclean
[1:36:31] spirits to cast them out and to heal all
[1:36:33] manner of sickness and all manner of
[1:36:35] disease ain't that right well you go
[1:36:38] into that second CH verse I think and
[1:36:41] and the Bible names all all of the
[1:36:44] disciples and Judas was one of
[1:36:46] them acts 1:17 in speaking of Judas said
[1:36:51] he was numbered with us and had obtained
[1:36:55] part part of this
[1:36:59] ministry he didn't have a full Holy
[1:37:02] Ghost
[1:37:03] Ministry he had part of the ministry can
[1:37:07] you say Amen see so we we find a man uh
[1:37:13] because he he uh he didn't stay with the
[1:37:16] word in Matthew 7:5 Jesus prophesied of
[1:37:20] this day and age
[1:37:21] saying beware of false prophets which
[1:37:23] come to you in sheep's clothing but
[1:37:26] inwardly they are ravening wolves you
[1:37:30] shall know them by their fruits right
[1:37:34] now brother B said how do you do it you
[1:37:36] don't discern the man you don't discern
[1:37:38] the spirit of a
[1:37:39] man watch his motives watch his
[1:37:42] objectives what is he trying to do where
[1:37:45] is he trying to lead you
[1:37:47] to
[1:37:48] right amen
[1:37:52] cuz sheep don't lead sheep to slaughter
[1:37:54] it's goats that lead sheep to
[1:37:56] slaughter now in first John 4:1 we are
[1:38:00] given a warning beloved believe not
[1:38:03] every Spirit but try the spirits amen
[1:38:07] try the spirits whether they are of God
[1:38:09] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:38:12] into the world ain't that right now
[1:38:15] brother Brown says and who is it that
[1:38:16] shall attempt to deceive the very elect
[1:38:18] why the spirit of antichrist in the
[1:38:21] false anointed ones of this last
[1:38:24] day yes ain't that right so they have
[1:38:28] come in Jesus name claiming that they
[1:38:32] have been anointed of God but the
[1:38:34] prophet said they are false
[1:38:38] Messiahs right amen notice they claim
[1:38:42] that they are prophets but the question
[1:38:45] is are they one with the word
[1:38:47] though but are they one with the word
[1:38:50] there's only only one that's going to be
[1:38:51] one of with the word and that's the body
[1:38:53] of Jesus
[1:38:55] Christ you see why the word is more
[1:38:58] important than us having
[1:39:01] gifts
[1:39:04] absolutely so he says but are they one
[1:39:06] with the word never see they have added
[1:39:10] to it or taken from it no one denies
[1:39:13] that the spirit of God see u manifesting
[1:39:16] in gifts is upon them but like balam
[1:39:19] they all have their program make their
[1:39:21] appeal for money exercise gifts but deny
[1:39:24] the word or bypass it for fear that a
[1:39:26] controversy might diminish their chances
[1:39:28] for great greater gain see yet they
[1:39:31] preach salvation and deliverance through
[1:39:32] the power of God just like Judas with
[1:39:34] the ministry imparted by Christ but
[1:39:37] because they are wrong seed consequently
[1:39:40] they have a wrong Spirit motivating
[1:39:45] them true come on now another place he
[1:39:48] says the thing of it is today we don't
[1:39:51] try to establish the word of God in the
[1:39:54] people's
[1:39:55] hearts we are trying to establish
[1:39:58] ourselves churches are trying to
[1:40:01] establish the church doctrines in a
[1:40:04] person's heart we are commanded to
[1:40:06] establish the word of
[1:40:09] God Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:40:12] enticing words of man that your faith
[1:40:14] might rest up in the knowledge of man
[1:40:16] but I come to you in power and in
[1:40:19] manifestations of the holy ghost that
[1:40:21] your faith might rest in God
[1:40:25] Amen that's
[1:40:27] true you want to be established in
[1:40:30] God you want to be established in his
[1:40:35] power
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:39] amen I pray that if God
[1:40:44] carries and somehow he would take me
[1:40:47] home I pray that you all as a church
[1:40:50] would just continue right on serving the
[1:40:53] lord don't argue about playing tapes of
[1:40:56] who and when and
[1:40:58] where I pray that you stay together and
[1:41:01] stay in one
[1:41:02] love I pray that you just stay right
[1:41:05] with the word stay with this
[1:41:07] message and understand that God only
[1:41:10] uses uses a man takes him off the scene
[1:41:13] but there's someone else that'll take
[1:41:14] carried the
[1:41:16] torch
[1:41:18] hello I'm not interested in you building
[1:41:20] a camper around
[1:41:22] me you know you know you hear ministers
[1:41:26] saying well now you know if I leave you
[1:41:28] know you're just to play my tapes and
[1:41:30] the message that's
[1:41:31] it that's such a lie right that that is
[1:41:35] so
[1:41:37] wrong amen we are commanded not to
[1:41:40] establish ourselves but to establish the
[1:41:42] word of God in the
[1:41:44] people now that's any any person that's
[1:41:48] part of the ministry so you you mothers
[1:41:52] if you're part of this ministry you are
[1:41:55] to establish the word of God in them
[1:41:57] children
[1:41:59] right establish the word of God you
[1:42:02] fathers in your
[1:42:04] home everything should by be directed
[1:42:08] and motivated and everything by the word
[1:42:10] of
[1:42:13] God true can you say
[1:42:18] Amen so he said man mustn't establish
[1:42:22] yourself let God do something for a
[1:42:25] person and send him out and you find
[1:42:28] every man trying to impersonate it why
[1:42:30] they're trying to establish themselves
[1:42:33] God didn't God there ain't another
[1:42:35] brother brandham
[1:42:36] coming there ain't another gift like
[1:42:38] brother brandham coming I don't care who
[1:42:41] it is there's not another man with the
[1:42:44] same
[1:42:45] [Applause]
[1:42:48] gift hello
[1:42:51] I'm going to be honest I'd love to sit
[1:42:53] with brother
[1:42:55] brandham and have an interview but I
[1:42:57] don't want no other interview with
[1:42:59] anyone
[1:43:00] else not in that
[1:43:02] way why because every other gift has got
[1:43:05] to be tried and
[1:43:08] tested no other man stood before a
[1:43:12] prophet and judged that Prophet but
[1:43:14] every other gift must be judged not nine
[1:43:17] spiritual gifts any other gift of
[1:43:18] Prophecy gift of tongues gift of interet
[1:43:20] ration of tongue gift of whatever the
[1:43:23] church is not to receive it until it's
[1:43:26] been judged tried and
[1:43:32] proven amen hello and we'll get into it
[1:43:36] more as we
[1:43:38] go but so he said see they're trying to
[1:43:41] establish themselves every man saying
[1:43:44] see I did this me I mine my denomination
[1:43:48] me see this see establishing theirselves
[1:43:52] what are we preaching about ourselves or
[1:43:54] the kingdom of God establish the word of
[1:43:58] God and to do that you got to take out
[1:44:01] all unbelief and establish the kingdom
[1:44:04] of God in a man's heart and the kingdom
[1:44:07] of God cannot be established in a man's
[1:44:09] heart unless God made that man
[1:44:13] thus so the word of God is going to
[1:44:15] bounce off a lot of people's backs just
[1:44:18] like
[1:44:19] water bouncing off a Ducks
[1:44:21] back but when God makes a man thus am
[1:44:25] that word of God becomes preeminent in
[1:44:27] his
[1:44:28] soul and you amen praise the Lord and
[1:44:32] the man that is made thus his name was
[1:44:34] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:44:36] before the foundation of the world now
[1:44:38] as we get ready to wind down there are
[1:44:41] people who have their names in The Book
[1:44:43] of Life and they are religious ain't
[1:44:46] that right yeah in the Old Testament
[1:44:49] there were people who had their name in
[1:44:50] The Book of Life and the prophet said
[1:44:53] they were part of the religious order of
[1:44:56] that day that centered around the true
[1:44:58] God and worship of him they centered
[1:45:02] around the true God and worship of him
[1:45:07] and and Paul talks about it in 1
[1:45:09] Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I
[1:45:11] would not that you should be ignorant
[1:45:13] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:45:15] cloud and all passed through the sea
[1:45:17] were all baptized un Moses in the cloud
[1:45:20] in the sea they did all eat the same
[1:45:23] spiritual meat they did all drink the
[1:45:25] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[1:45:27] that spiritual rock that followed them
[1:45:29] and that rock was Christ ain't that
[1:45:31] right so when it came to the external
[1:45:34] blessings and manifestations the prophet
[1:45:36] said they took partook of all of it in
[1:45:40] like and equal manner just like Jesus or
[1:45:43] Judas did but he didn't go all the way
[1:45:46] can you say man he didn't go all the way
[1:45:49] they didn't go all the way for verse 5
[1:45:51] says but with many of them God was not
[1:45:53] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:45:55] the wilderness see so the prophet says
[1:45:58] when they came to Moab those who joined
[1:46:01] in the Feast of Bal Balor all died their
[1:46:05] carcasses fell in the wilderness for it
[1:46:08] was there that they refused the word of
[1:46:10] God and turned from it they P partook of
[1:46:14] all religious order they they done it
[1:46:17] you know and and partook of the
[1:46:19] religious things but when it come to the
[1:46:21] word of God they refused it and turned
[1:46:24] from it and he says there are people who
[1:46:27] seem involved in the things of God
[1:46:30] Almost 100% but they're like Judas no
[1:46:34] one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of
[1:46:37] a person Judas was so the day came that
[1:46:40] Judas did exactly what Israel did at
[1:46:44] bpor he decided that he wanted to join
[1:46:47] with the false Vine forces enter into
[1:46:50] the Financial political organization of
[1:46:52] anti- antichrist religion and he did so
[1:46:57] yeah and you say Amen in another place
[1:47:00] he said Judas was chosen of God not not
[1:47:03] in that he was elected before the
[1:47:05] foundation of the world name written in
[1:47:07] the L book of life but he was chosen to
[1:47:08] be 12 the part of the 12 disciples he
[1:47:12] was instructed in truth he shared
[1:47:14] knowledge of the Mysteries he had a
[1:47:17] Ministry of power granted unto him he
[1:47:19] healed the sick cast out devils in
[1:47:21] jesus' name but when The Showdown came
[1:47:24] he slded out for gold and political
[1:47:25] power he did not go up to Pentecost to
[1:47:28] receive the spirit of God he was devoid
[1:47:31] of the spirit make no mistake about it a
[1:47:36] person that is truly baptized by the
[1:47:39] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:47:42] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[1:47:44] will be in the word all the way all
[1:47:48] right that is the evidence of being
[1:47:51] baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas
[1:47:53] failed and multitudes fell amen right
[1:47:57] there can you say Amen do you love the
[1:48:01] Lord amen I love him amen stay with the
[1:48:05] word stay that word stay in the presence
[1:48:08] of
[1:48:10] God know him get to know

[1:48:17] him amen if the musicians will come
[1:48:23] praise the
[1:48:26] Lord I love the Lord
