[27:16] but it's all a reason and a purpose you
[27:19] never said it would be free from these
[27:20] trials tests and sicknesses but you said
[27:23] you'd make a way for us and you have
[27:25] made a way and you made a way for her
[27:26] and she's going to be a winner either
[27:28] way of all the way through she's still

[49:16] um in a great way and just grants the
[49:18] desires of your heart amen and you are
[49:22] deeply appreciated
[49:25] and I want to look at first John the
[49:30] fourth chapter and before we go into
[49:33] reading uh may we just bow our hearts
[49:36] our heads
[49:39] and just talk to our Lord father
[49:43] where your children and
[49:45] we come humbly before you Lord with
[49:49] grateful hearts
[49:51] just thinking of the song that was sung
[49:54] there that
[49:55] the break in the prodigal
[49:58] that way that life the tradition and I'm
[50:02] so glad that you did it for us
[50:05] father we wouldn't be here today if it
[50:07] hadn't been for your grace and your
[50:09] mercy
[50:10] and father our hearts desires that you
[50:13] would continue to draw was closer to you
[50:17] I don't think that we could be drawn
[50:19] close enough
[50:21] father let it be that we get so close in
[50:25] love with you father that the world just
[50:27] loses its hold
[50:29] loses it's it's its pull upon his father
[50:33] that there would be no desire for it
[50:37] Lord that we could be totally in love
[50:40] with you
[50:41] father I pray that you would increase
[50:43] our faith this morning
[50:46] Lord Jesus would you come and speak to
[50:48] our hearts Lord
[50:50] you see what words that we would have to
[50:53] say in the thought Lord but I pray that
[50:55] you would come and you would just
[50:58] Minister Lord
[50:59] do every heart father bless every dad
[51:02] here Lord and
[51:05] I pray Lord that your spirit would just
[51:07] come Among Us
[51:09] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[51:12] amen
[51:14] first John the fourth chapter the fourth
[51:18] verse here
[51:20] and um
[51:24] but it says you are of God little
[51:26] children can you say that with me you
[51:29] are of God
[51:31] little children
[51:33] and have overcome them because greater
[51:36] is he that is in you than he that is in
[51:40] the world
[51:41] amen lest you can be seated here
[51:50] this uh may be a a little odd
[51:54] um
[51:54] scripture reading for of Father's Day
[51:59] but
[52:01] um hopefully
[52:05] uh we can make sense of it and and I
[52:08] believe it would be applicable
[52:10] do what I have to say today
[52:14] and I want to address not only you
[52:18] fathers but every every man
[52:22] whether you are young and single and
[52:25] looking to be married or you might be
[52:28] married but as of yet don't have
[52:30] children or whatever but
[52:33] you know in in such days and times that
[52:36] we live there's there's so many things
[52:38] that I would like to
[52:40] pour my heart out
[52:42] uh and say to you Brothers
[52:46] um
[52:47] for one I I see that the
[52:51] um the the father's role within the
[52:54] family is diminishing
[52:57] manhood is being challenged fatherhood
[53:00] is being challenged
[53:02] in a in a great way
[53:06] or at least the way God designed it to
[53:10] be
[53:11] and
[53:13] um the world has practically done away
[53:16] with God what God has intended uh the
[53:21] family to be and as we've said and and
[53:24] you you all know but fatherhood today is
[53:27] just a figurehead father in the family
[53:30] has just become a figurehead and sad to
[53:34] say that confusion and perversion
[53:37] is becoming more predominant in the home
[53:41] and um
[53:43] you know the parents rights are being
[53:47] taken away uh gradually and
[53:52] um or it's been gradually it's now
[53:54] rapidly it seems to be speeding up
[53:57] and
[53:58] um you know we had our president
[54:01] um make the statement that all all
[54:04] children are our children they're not
[54:07] just anyones in particular they're our
[54:10] children
[54:11] and
[54:13] um there's this meaning behind that
[54:15] there there's a statement behind that
[54:17] and and so but in the beginning and I'm
[54:23] I'm just going to take my time and and
[54:26] these things you already know but I just
[54:29] want to bring to your remembrance but uh
[54:32] in the beginning God is the one who
[54:34] instituted marriage between man and
[54:37] woman
[54:38] and he designed it to where the man and
[54:41] woman wouldn't just live together
[54:45] um and and we the world too has
[54:48] forgotten that and this Young Generation
[54:50] has really forgotten that
[54:52] but God never intended for a man and
[54:54] woman to live together
[54:56] but he wanted them to live as husband
[55:00] and wife
[55:01] and he designed that husband and wife
[55:04] the first husband and wife that they
[55:07] should become one
[55:09] and the way he did that is he took the
[55:11] woman out of man he did not make her a
[55:15] separate entity but he took she is a
[55:18] byproduct of man and so she was Adam uh
[55:23] in feminine form ain't that right so God
[55:26] would take they the the feminist Spirit
[55:29] out of Adam and put that in in the woman
[55:33] and that's what woman is and so the
[55:37] first woman that come from man Adam when
[55:41] he sees her he gets this Revelation she
[55:44] is the Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone
[55:48] ain't that right and then he says they
[55:51] twain shall become one ain't that right
[55:54] and so that's the way God designed the
[55:58] start of any home was that they would
[56:01] become one not separate but one ain't
[56:05] that right and uh and and you know
[56:08] talking about I really enjoyed that song
[56:12] sister Kimberly
[56:14] the grace of God but but I I I say that
[56:18] it is also the grace of God that takes
[56:20] two people that have been separated that
[56:23] have that have maybe one has lived in
[56:26] Alaska and the other one has lived in in
[56:28] Maine or or in in Phoenix Arizona or
[56:32] whatever and and then they they somehow
[56:35] meet and and God agrees with that
[56:39] marriage and he makes them to one both
[56:43] having different backgrounds different
[56:45] upbringings different likings and and
[56:48] all that but in the end God designed it
[56:51] that that man and woman should become
[56:53] one ain't that right and and so God made
[56:57] it so that when a man Embraces a woman
[57:01] and takes her for his wife that she
[57:05] would make an imprint upon his heart
[57:09] and that no other woman can fit that
[57:12] print
[57:13] amen and so and and in our wedding vows
[57:17] we make the promise to love to honor and
[57:21] to cherish one another to support one
[57:24] another in sickness and in health in
[57:27] riches or poverty to cleave only to each
[57:30] other for as we both shall live ain't
[57:34] that right as long as we shall live and
[57:37] so these these men and women running
[57:41] around cheating on their you know their
[57:44] spouse now we know that is nothing but
[57:48] the devil it is nothing it's and and and
[57:52] Satan has got many traps out in this
[57:55] this world today to to draw a man and
[57:59] sadly save in a woman that draws them
[58:03] away from their marriage and their
[58:07] spouse and and before you know it they
[58:09] begin to have eyes for others and and
[58:12] such and such but we're seeing a lot of
[58:15] that in this evil age and one thing that
[58:18] we're we're not seeing is is commitment
[58:21] there is there's hardly any commitment
[58:24] uh uh toward one another now I'm going
[58:27] to say this more people are more men are
[58:30] committed to their jobs than they are
[58:32] their wife
[58:33] they're more committed to for money than
[58:36] they are their wife and their children
[58:37] they're more committed to to their their
[58:41] their
[58:41] Ambitions and and and their retirement
[58:44] than they are to the home and uh uh and
[58:49] we find it's it's the lack of love and
[58:52] and the prophet used the scripture where
[58:55] father would be against mother mother
[58:57] against father and children against the
[59:00] parents and and and and it just on and
[59:03] on and he says the reason why it's a
[59:05] lack of love the commitment love brings
[59:08] commitment it brings loyalty it brings
[59:11] it brings it makes it's sacrificial it
[59:14] it love is the main thing ain't that
[59:17] right but we we find that marriage is
[59:20] not as sacred as it used to be uh to to
[59:24] to many uh it has become just a fantasy
[59:29] uh uh especially those that have never
[59:32] been married and and looking in and it
[59:35] just becomes a fantasy in other words
[59:37] people imagine marriage to be something
[59:40] that it isn't right and and so they
[59:44] consider it a marriage to be a fix-all
[59:46] for all their problems and uh or they
[59:51] have this notion that once they get
[59:53] married it will change the one that
[59:55] they're going to marry for for better
[59:57] and and and but but they don't realize
[1:00:01] that marriage isn't to fix all marriage
[1:00:04] does not fix problems
[1:00:08] ain't that right
[1:00:09] and so we we find
[1:00:13] um uh you know
[1:00:16] I look at it if if dad and mom hasn't
[1:00:19] been able to change change him or her if
[1:00:23] the preacher hasn't been able to affect
[1:00:25] him or her and God hasn't been able to
[1:00:28] change uh him or her but uh but somehow
[1:00:34] they themselves feel like once they get
[1:00:37] married that they're they're able to fix
[1:00:39] things and you you you can't you you
[1:00:43] can't start uh with that uh marriage has
[1:00:46] plenty of disappointments along the road
[1:00:49] and uh and then the reality sets in and
[1:00:55] they find out that marriage isn't what
[1:00:58] they imagined it to be that they
[1:01:01] conjured it all up to be and and and uh
[1:01:06] uh and so and then then you find your
[1:01:09] divorce nurses and you find you know uh
[1:01:13] well today people don't even want to
[1:01:14] commit anymore they just shack up and
[1:01:16] live together
[1:01:18] and uh you know and and so uh and sad to
[1:01:23] say but our our nation is promoting them
[1:01:25] things there's more benefits if you just
[1:01:27] shack up than there is for the marriage
[1:01:30] and and so you you we're dealing with so
[1:01:34] much in this age and and so we're we're
[1:01:37] living in a time where the Prophet said
[1:01:40] and he preached the message uncertain
[1:01:43] sound and he said everything we're
[1:01:45] living in an age where everything is
[1:01:47] uncertain everything is uncertain and
[1:01:52] not only is the church not only his
[1:01:54] politics not only is is government and
[1:01:57] all these things uncertain not only is
[1:01:59] your future uncertain but uh in the
[1:02:02] future of of whatever but but uh uh also
[1:02:07] brother Brown said the American home
[1:02:10] life is uncertain the family is
[1:02:14] uncertain and he says a man marrying a
[1:02:16] wife it sure is a problem certainly is
[1:02:19] or a woman marrying a man it's certainly
[1:02:22] an uncertain thing they've even got it
[1:02:25] in the marriage ceremony now I take him
[1:02:28] for better or worse there's a question
[1:02:30] question on it see it's uncertain see be
[1:02:34] good to pray through on it don't you
[1:02:36] think so that would be better just pray
[1:02:39] through but it's uncertain homes are
[1:02:42] broke up remarriage constantly all the
[1:02:44] time uncertainty of home life and
[1:02:48] America leads the world in divorce cases
[1:02:51] and all the rest of the world America
[1:02:53] leads it and of course he's speaking
[1:02:55] years and years uh back but but we see
[1:02:59] it even more prominent in this age now I
[1:03:03] understand uh and I I you know you have
[1:03:05] to I guess make the Clause that uh uh
[1:03:09] there there's some maybe here or
[1:03:10] listening and in and and and you you
[1:03:13] your marriage has been messed up and and
[1:03:16] all these things and and maybe you were
[1:03:18] out in the world and got got messed all
[1:03:20] up and now you're back in church or
[1:03:22] whatever and and so you know that that
[1:03:25] there that's the grace of God and we
[1:03:28] understand there's Grace but but at the
[1:03:30] same time you know we are called to
[1:03:33] preach uh not the permissive will but we
[1:03:36] are to preach the perfect will because
[1:03:38] we got young young men young women that
[1:03:42] that need to walk in that perfect will
[1:03:44] of God and and so
[1:03:48] um uh but but how many men and women run
[1:03:51] around on their spouse because they've
[1:03:54] married for other reasons outside of
[1:03:57] Love they had their head in the clouds
[1:03:59] and their feelings and emotions got
[1:04:01] steered up and they didn't consider what
[1:04:04] God thought about it and I'm I'm gonna
[1:04:06] say this too but it's becoming more
[1:04:08] prominent men among these boys that
[1:04:10] they'll tell the girl that the Lord told
[1:04:12] me the Lord told me the Lord told me
[1:04:13] we're meant to be together the Lord said
[1:04:15] it and the Lord this I think them are
[1:04:18] cheap words
[1:04:20] yeah them are pretty cheap words
[1:04:23] um uh uh for one the Lord will tell her
[1:04:27] and the Lord will tell you and the Lord
[1:04:30] will tell I believe the Lord just works
[1:04:32] it all out it'd be in in both in in in
[1:04:35] the families and and so uh uh if if you
[1:04:40] feel like the Lord has told you then
[1:04:42] just keep your mouth shut and just and
[1:04:45] and and just continue to date and just
[1:04:47] let the Lord Do The Guiding and let the
[1:04:50] Lord do the leading but you don't have
[1:04:52] to go around making the Lord do
[1:04:53] something you don't have to put it in
[1:04:55] someone's head that the Lord said it and
[1:04:57] this is what it meant and now they're
[1:04:58] confused because they don't really know
[1:05:00] what to believe and and all that but I
[1:05:02] believe when the Lord speaks it is
[1:05:04] certain and he works on both ends don't
[1:05:06] you believe that he just works on both
[1:05:09] ends so uh but but uh young people they
[1:05:13] get their head in the clouds and their
[1:05:15] feelings and emotions and and all that
[1:05:17] and and and they think this is has got
[1:05:19] to be it and they never consider they
[1:05:22] never stop to pray they never really
[1:05:25] really anchor themselves in the word of
[1:05:27] God
[1:05:28] and really find out what God has to say
[1:05:31] about it and so uh brother Branham in
[1:05:35] talking to the young people he said you
[1:05:37] better pray a long time and ask God to
[1:05:41] give you a companion uh prayer is so
[1:05:45] important in these days and and the
[1:05:48] problem is young people they get in a
[1:05:50] hurry and become desperate instead of
[1:05:52] waiting on God but I believe God has the
[1:05:55] right one and and God knows what he's
[1:05:57] doing and and and and and these things
[1:06:00] but the sad thing is as parents
[1:06:02] encourage this as well never encouraging
[1:06:05] them to stop and to pray and and to wait
[1:06:09] and and and don't get into hurry on
[1:06:11] things and but it seemed like they want
[1:06:14] to push it and then they want to
[1:06:15] encourage it and they want to prod it
[1:06:17] and they want to go with it and and all
[1:06:20] of these things but but uh I I believe
[1:06:23] that that there there is a a a marriage
[1:06:27] that that that that can last and as long
[1:06:30] as God is in it ain't that right so God
[1:06:33] instituted Adam and Eve's marriage as we
[1:06:36] know but then afterward he told them to
[1:06:39] replenish and to multiply and and to be
[1:06:44] fruitful he replenish the Earth be
[1:06:46] multiply and be fruitful ain't that
[1:06:49] right in other words Adam was not just
[1:06:52] to become husband and live with his wife
[1:06:55] but he was actually to become father now
[1:06:58] and and and and Eve was to become mother
[1:07:02] and this was all in God's plans ain't
[1:07:05] that right now brother Branham really
[1:07:07] rebuked this age and this generation
[1:07:09] that they they they wanted to they
[1:07:13] wanted to get married uh or say or or
[1:07:16] live together or whatever uh but they
[1:07:20] wanted to raise a cat instead of a child
[1:07:22] they they wanted to raise a dog and and
[1:07:26] they wanted to raise whatever outside of
[1:07:29] children and and and he rebuked this
[1:07:32] generation because that's a sin can you
[1:07:35] say man you don't put your dog before
[1:07:37] your children you don't you don't baby
[1:07:40] your your animals before you do your
[1:07:42] children then you say amen and and and
[1:07:46] there's more than just providing uh a
[1:07:49] home or a roof over their head a man but
[1:07:53] but so they are to become father and
[1:07:55] mother and and they were to have
[1:07:57] children so not just to live together as
[1:08:01] husband and wife Psalms 127 3 says lo
[1:08:05] children are in Heritage of the Lord and
[1:08:08] the fruit of the womb is his reward now
[1:08:13] I I looked up here at the Gen and the
[1:08:16] meaning of this word is possession
[1:08:19] property inheritance it's it's Heritage
[1:08:23] Property portion share uh so children
[1:08:27] are God's portion given to us
[1:08:31] as as as uh uh husband and wife dad and
[1:08:36] mom ain't that right I I don't believe
[1:08:38] that we uh uh should ever tell our
[1:08:41] children that you were a mistake you
[1:08:43] know uh it may have happened
[1:08:45] accidentally and well you may have not
[1:08:48] been planning to have a child but if God
[1:08:51] gave it to you that's God's portion to
[1:08:53] you
[1:08:55] in your home ain't that right and and so
[1:08:59] that we've got a generation that looks
[1:09:02] at children to be a nuisance and I've
[1:09:04] had them tell me you know oh just wait
[1:09:07] till your children become teenagers and
[1:09:09] boy they're going to be your problem I
[1:09:11] haven't found that yet now when I say
[1:09:13] that I understand there's troubles I
[1:09:15] understand teenagers got their issues
[1:09:17] and and sometimes I'm about to pull my
[1:09:20] hair out that I don't agree regret one
[1:09:22] of them I don't regret having my
[1:09:24] children you understand what I'm saying
[1:09:26] amen and and so but it goes on to say as
[1:09:30] arrows are in the hand of a mighty man
[1:09:33] so are children of the youth happy is
[1:09:37] the man that hath his quiver full of
[1:09:40] them amen I I say that you know I use it
[1:09:44] as I got my Quivers got spandex you know
[1:09:47] because I got seven of them you know and
[1:09:50] and but my my it's full you know uh
[1:09:53] someone had talked to me the other day
[1:09:54] said now you got 12 right and I said
[1:09:57] no seven oh oh okay she says well I I
[1:10:02] saw all your your children and your
[1:10:05] daughter-in-laws I said well they are my
[1:10:06] children too I can I I consider my my
[1:10:09] daughters as well and uh uh so yeah you
[1:10:13] know in that sense but uh anyways happy
[1:10:16] is the man that have his quiver full of
[1:10:19] them and they shall not be ashamed but
[1:10:22] they shall speak with the enemies in the
[1:10:24] gate and and so uh uh man and his wife
[1:10:28] hard to have children and and now they
[1:10:32] become a a I'm going to say a family in
[1:10:36] in that way and and you know I
[1:10:40] I understand that uh uh some aren't able
[1:10:45] to have children and or as of yet here
[1:10:48] in the church and and uh you know but
[1:10:51] that that ain't you know I I just
[1:10:54] believe that's that's just the result of
[1:10:56] the devil uh that is afflicting the
[1:10:58] bodies and and we know brother Branham
[1:11:00] goes into that about the foods and such
[1:11:02] amen but I believe that you're still
[1:11:05] able brother Samaya amen and and to to
[1:11:09] plead God to God and and you to have a
[1:11:12] child amen I I believe it because it's
[1:11:15] God's word ain't that right amen and and
[1:11:18] we've seen it time again where God would
[1:11:22] uh open up the womb for a for a woman to
[1:11:25] where she could have children and and
[1:11:27] you know uh I'm thinking of brother
[1:11:28] Casto uh their pastoring just uh a few
[1:11:32] minutes away but uh uh married how many
[1:11:35] years and uh uh many many years not able
[1:11:38] to have children but they kept hanging
[1:11:40] on to a promise now they've got two of
[1:11:42] them so so God God has his timing ain't
[1:11:46] that right and and so we we find but but
[1:11:50] uh God intends for uh a family God wants
[1:11:55] family before the creation God uh was
[1:11:59] called Elohim as the prophet tells us
[1:12:01] which is the self-existent one he
[1:12:04] existed all alone and and these things
[1:12:06] but when he made man he made man in such
[1:12:10] a way not not in in in in in in the way
[1:12:14] that he would make animals and the trees
[1:12:16] and all the other creation Angels but he
[1:12:19] when he made man he said let us make man
[1:12:21] in our own image and and and and and so
[1:12:25] God says I am Yahweh uh uh Jehovah see
[1:12:29] and what did it mean I'm the
[1:12:31] all-existent one who has created
[1:12:33] something off of myself to be a son of
[1:12:38] mine so God wanted a family and so he
[1:12:43] creates a son ain't that right a man or
[1:12:46] uh so so something all for myself to be
[1:12:49] a son of mine or a temporary or an
[1:12:52] amateur little one of mine Oh Glory he
[1:12:55] said see Jehovah means that he gave man
[1:12:57] to be an amateur God because he is
[1:13:00] Father God no longer itself existing
[1:13:04] existing alone amen but now he is Father
[1:13:08] existing with his family ain't that
[1:13:12] right he isn't self-existent anymore he
[1:13:15] exists with his family a man so he says
[1:13:19] in another place there he is god Jehovah
[1:13:21] the one who once existed in
[1:13:24] self-existing but now he exists with his
[1:13:28] family his little ones with him aren't
[1:13:32] you glad for that but aren't you glad
[1:13:35] that God is a father not like us and not
[1:13:39] like the world that is out he here that
[1:13:41] forgets them and and doesn't want
[1:13:43] responsibility for them and and wants to
[1:13:46] do his own thing but everything that God
[1:13:49] has done has been for his family he
[1:13:52] created this Earth for his family he
[1:13:55] graved the mountains and the deserts and
[1:13:57] the rivers and the The Valleys for his
[1:14:00] family ain't that right amen all
[1:14:03] Redemption plan was for his family a man
[1:14:07] see and so children children uh God
[1:14:10] considers children to be a blessing amen
[1:14:15] and and something of value for children
[1:14:18] are to carry on the family name uh and
[1:14:22] the lineage of the family and in many
[1:14:24] cases it's the children that carry on
[1:14:28] the family business and and and these
[1:14:31] things but that's on the natural side of
[1:14:33] it but but let's look on God's side on
[1:14:36] the other side of this God wants the
[1:14:39] Next Generation a man to learn of him
[1:14:43] and his ways so that they can preserve
[1:14:46] him can you say Amen now now I I want to
[1:14:50] say it because they're passing laws left
[1:14:52] and right they are trying to do with you
[1:14:55] away with the existence of family the
[1:14:57] way God intended it they're trying to do
[1:15:00] away with the existence of of healing
[1:15:02] and the power of God and Holiness
[1:15:05] standards and and and and and and and
[1:15:07] they're trying to bring perversion in
[1:15:10] and and and and infiltrate that in our
[1:15:13] children's minds and and all of these
[1:15:15] things how many agree with that you can
[1:15:18] see it on the news and they're pushing
[1:15:20] it it's getting in the stores it's now
[1:15:23] even the Dodgers uh uh baseball uh they
[1:15:26] had a big thing an hour before the game
[1:15:28] the other night celebrating uh uh they
[1:15:31] they had a drag queens dressed as
[1:15:34] Catholic nuns and and uh they they they
[1:15:37] had it on the soccer the other day and
[1:15:40] to wear they were Chan the fans were
[1:15:42] chanting uh explicit homosexual uh uh
[1:15:46] things to where the the referees had to
[1:15:48] cancel the game and close it off amen
[1:15:51] it's an agenda and they're pushing and
[1:15:53] there's they're pushing these things not
[1:15:56] only on their children but they're
[1:15:57] trying to put it on upon our children
[1:15:59] can you say amen amen but see God God
[1:16:03] has a children God wants children a man
[1:16:07] uh uh so he can he can he can carry on
[1:16:11] his power amen the testimony of God's uh
[1:16:15] uh healing power are to continue on how
[1:16:18] many believe that amen the the the
[1:16:21] deliverance and the of God's power and
[1:16:24] and the the experience of the
[1:16:27] Supernatural are to carry on they are to
[1:16:29] live out and if every one of us daddies
[1:16:32] go and US Mama's goal amen and our
[1:16:35] children remain God wants them to carry
[1:16:38] on them power we don't want the
[1:16:40] experience of God God to die with us
[1:16:42] amen I thought of uh brother Walker amen
[1:16:45] uh you know uh uh God didn't want just
[1:16:48] everything to die with him God didn't
[1:16:50] want it to die with brother praying him
[1:16:52] but there thank God there are a people
[1:16:55] still alive and well that are
[1:16:58] proclaiming and are experiencing the
[1:17:01] power and the experiences of God can you
[1:17:04] say Amen see so these experience of God
[1:17:08] the Supernatural and the divine power
[1:17:10] and healing and the gifts and all these
[1:17:13] they're not to die with the older
[1:17:15] generation they are to keep living and

[1:17:50] wants you he don't want you just sitting
[1:17:51] on a Pew and being raised in a message

[1:17:56] God ever dealt with you at that tent
[1:17:58] meeting call and saved your soul it's
[1:18:00] because God's got a desire to use you in
[1:18:03] a greater way can you say amen amen see
[1:18:06] and yes you're going to fight these
[1:18:08] challenges you're going to fight things

[1:23:53] word comes to
[1:23:56] amen amen

[1:24:02] Sons

[1:24:10] people together and I will make them
[1:24:12] hear my words
[1:24:13] that they may learn to fear me all the
[1:24:17] days that they shall live upon the Earth
[1:24:18] that they may teach their children
[1:24:22] what a responsibility God tells them
[1:24:25] you're special in my eyes but not only
[1:24:28] you are your children are and their
[1:24:30] generation after them amen I've called
[1:24:33] you amen not just for today I've called
[1:24:35] you to serve me throughout your
[1:24:37] Generations
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:42] all the feasts all the sacrifices all
[1:24:45] the Commandments that God instituted in
[1:24:47] the Old Testament were to be kept and to
[1:24:50] be preserved
[1:24:52] by the children
[1:24:57] and the way they would be taught and
[1:24:59] preserved is by the Elder the older
[1:25:02] generation teaching the younger
[1:25:04] generation
[1:25:05] and they would be reared in knowing the
[1:25:08] children would be reared in knowing amen
[1:25:11] the principles of God the institution of
[1:25:14] God the way God wanted things to be and
[1:25:17] then they were required to teach their
[1:25:19] children
[1:25:22] you with me
[1:25:27] of course it was sad that it become a
[1:25:29] tradition
[1:25:31] to her when the true Messiah come
[1:25:34] no one knew him
[1:25:36] but oh God
[1:25:38] we're living in an hour this is the age
[1:25:41] we're not looking for generations to
[1:25:43] come this is the generation of the Lord
[1:25:46] coming
[1:25:47] are you with me now this is a generation
[1:25:50] this is the generation and God forbid
[1:25:52] that the Revival die with you
[1:25:55] God forbid that it dies with me
[1:26:01] you know I read to you last Wednesday
[1:26:02] night that brother Brown said
[1:26:04] historically every Revival only lasted
[1:26:06] three years
[1:26:08] he said but this this revival hasn't
[1:26:10] lasted now or hasn't ended in three this
[1:26:14] this has gone on and on and it will
[1:26:16] continue as long as there's people you
[1:26:19] say well that God will always do it no
[1:26:21] he's dependent upon you
[1:26:22] he's dependent upon you do you believe
[1:26:24] that he already had a predestinated seed
[1:26:27] before the foundation world but he
[1:26:28] raised up preachers he raised up parents
[1:26:30] he raised up somebody to carry that word
[1:26:33] and to teach it whether it's behind this
[1:26:35] Pulpit whether it's out on the streets
[1:26:37] whether it's at your home wherever the
[1:26:40] word of God is to be taught
[1:26:43] you cannot let the Revival die
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:55] amen
[1:26:57] as long as the Lord tarries and time
[1:27:00] continues
[1:27:03] it will be through our children that God
[1:27:05] lives
[1:27:10] this is why we dedicate them to the Lord
[1:27:14] they are his
[1:27:17] they were his in the first place
[1:27:20] and he blessed them us with them
[1:27:24] he gave them to us
[1:27:27] and then we in return give them back to
[1:27:30] him
[1:27:33] but with that dedication
[1:27:35] we're dedicating Our Lives to that child
[1:27:38] we're committing ourselves to that child
[1:27:41] we're not saying Lord okay here you are
[1:27:43] you take him and we pray that you just
[1:27:46] bless him and he'd be a preacher and she
[1:27:48] be a Sunday school teacher or whatever
[1:27:49] and then we just go do our own thing and
[1:27:52] leave it to the Lord no you commit
[1:27:54] yourself to that child
[1:28:00] you see
[1:28:02] I can say it this way
[1:28:04] our children
[1:28:05] were not born for the devil's enjoyment
[1:28:10] you believe that
[1:28:12] and I'm going to tell you you you you
[1:28:14] young men you young women
[1:28:17] whether you have small children or
[1:28:19] whether you ain't got any yet
[1:28:21] you better keep that in mind they're not
[1:28:24] given to you for the devil's enjoyment
[1:28:27] they are not born to be used as the
[1:28:30] devil's Pawn
[1:28:31] you with me
[1:28:33] God gave them to us they our ours
[1:28:38] not the devils
[1:28:40] and then we in return give them to God
[1:28:43] they are Gods Not the devils
[1:28:46] can you say amen and I don't want the
[1:28:48] devil now they're going to have enough
[1:28:49] influence out in that world Amen and so
[1:28:52] therefore it's my job as a parent to
[1:28:55] make sure there's a right atmosphere in
[1:28:57] that home and the devil ain't got a
[1:29:00] chance with them
[1:29:06] they are
[1:29:08] our family
[1:29:11] you believe it can you say it with me my
[1:29:13] children
[1:29:15] are my family
[1:29:21] where they build your children are yours
[1:29:25] amen
[1:29:26] the prophet Isaiah prophesied in Isaiah
[1:29:30] 65 19.
[1:29:32] speaking of the Millennium and I will
[1:29:34] rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my
[1:29:36] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[1:29:38] no more heard in her nor the voice of
[1:29:41] crying
[1:29:42] what a day that'll be eh
[1:29:45] there shall be no more sense an infant
[1:29:48] of days nor an old man that hath not
[1:29:52] filled his days for the child shall die
[1:29:54] 100 years old but the sinner being 100
[1:29:56] years old shall be accursed
[1:29:59] and they shall build houses and inhabit
[1:30:01] them and they shall build plant
[1:30:04] Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they
[1:30:06] shall not build and another inhabit they
[1:30:09] shall not plant and another eat and the
[1:30:12] prophet stops there and says in other
[1:30:14] words his son take it and his son see in
[1:30:17] other words the father built the home
[1:30:19] and the son takes it because he's died
[1:30:21] but he says no the sun will be right
[1:30:23] there living with him
[1:30:26] family children
[1:30:30] for as the days of a tree are the days
[1:30:32] of my people and mine elect shall long
[1:30:35] and joy the work of their hands they
[1:30:37] shall not labor in vain nor bring forth
[1:30:40] uh for trouble for they are the seed of
[1:30:44] the Blessed of the Lord and their
[1:30:46] offspring everybody say my Offspring
[1:30:49] their offspring with them
[1:30:54] Put The Offspring there
[1:30:57] can you say Amen
[1:30:59] yes sir see now if you notice I hope
[1:31:02] this is all right
[1:31:04] but if you'll notice the family must
[1:31:06] have structure
[1:31:09] the family has to have structure
[1:31:12] structure in other words it it is to be
[1:31:15] constructed
[1:31:17] this word constructed is to make or form
[1:31:20] by combining or arranging parts or
[1:31:25] elements
[1:31:28] so like when a man builds builds a house
[1:31:31] he is constructing it
[1:31:33] he puts he puts boards in the place
[1:31:37] where they belong
[1:31:40] where they need to go ain't that right
[1:31:42] now in the Bible the word family is
[1:31:46] house
[1:31:47] or house is family
[1:31:51] it's household
[1:31:54] Genesis 7 1 and the Lord said unto Noah
[1:31:56] Come Thou and all thy house
[1:32:00] thy family
[1:32:02] into the ark
[1:32:04] so so Noah's house was his family and he
[1:32:08] all went into the ark
[1:32:11] right
[1:32:12] Proverbs 14 1 Every Woman every wise
[1:32:16] woman buildeth her house
[1:32:19] her family
[1:32:21] but the foolish plucket that down with
[1:32:23] her hands
[1:32:26] Psalms 127 and one except the Lord build
[1:32:30] the house
[1:32:32] amen accept the Lord build the family
[1:32:37] they labor in vain that build it
[1:32:41] you say man
[1:32:43] so then the Lord has to have the
[1:32:46] preeminence in the family
[1:32:49] the family must be built under his
[1:32:53] leadership
[1:32:55] you believe it
[1:32:57] serve for as as in Zechariah I believe
[1:33:00] it is
[1:33:02] where the Lord said not by might nor by
[1:33:04] power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:33:07] the family must be built by his spirit
[1:33:14] then the building of the family must be
[1:33:17] sanctioned by him by God
[1:33:21] you believe it
[1:33:23] therefore it's not just my prerogative
[1:33:25] the way just to build my family the way
[1:33:27] I think they should go
[1:33:31] run my family the way it should what I
[1:33:34] think it should be
[1:33:35] God must sanction this family
[1:33:42] you see every son and daughter of God is
[1:33:44] God's family and he's the one that's
[1:33:46] building them
[1:33:48] but that does not give us the freedom
[1:33:52] as parents just to run free and Wild
[1:33:56] it does not mean that the natural family
[1:33:59] is left to the devices of carnal
[1:34:01] thinking carnal man
[1:34:03] carnal understanding
[1:34:08] there's a lot of good families
[1:34:12] and yet them families are not
[1:34:14] constructed by God
[1:34:19] it's true
[1:34:20] good parents that love their children
[1:34:23] it's not established on biblical
[1:34:26] principles the way God designed the
[1:34:29] family to be
[1:34:32] so therefore the family must be
[1:34:35] constructed according to God's blueprint
[1:34:39] Matthew 7 24
[1:34:42] Jesus says therefore whosoever heareth
[1:34:45] thee sayings of mine and doeth them I
[1:34:46] will liken him unto a wise man which
[1:34:49] built his house upon a rock
[1:34:55] the rain descended the floods came the
[1:34:58] winds blew beat up on that house and it
[1:35:01] fell not
[1:35:04] for it was founded upon a rock
[1:35:06] now I'm going to just tell you right now
[1:35:08] the floods are here
[1:35:11] every demon power is pouring in now
[1:35:18] it's invading the rich the poor
[1:35:21] educated the dumb
[1:35:25] the skinny the fact
[1:35:28] the tall the short
[1:35:30] The Talented the not so talented
[1:35:34] it's invading everything
[1:35:40] right
[1:35:43] and the rain descended the floods came
[1:35:45] and blew the winds blew and beat up on
[1:35:47] that house and it fell not for it was
[1:35:50] founded upon a rock and everyone that
[1:35:53] here at these things of mine and doeth
[1:35:55] him not
[1:35:56] shall be likened unto a foolish man
[1:35:57] which built his house upon the sand and
[1:36:00] the rain descended and the floods came
[1:36:02] the winds blew and beat up on that house
[1:36:04] and it fell and not only did it fall but
[1:36:06] great was the fall
[1:36:08] of it
[1:36:10] and you say man
[1:36:12] see so this tells us that a man must
[1:36:15] build right if his if he wants his work
[1:36:17] to last
[1:36:20] ain't that right and the foundation of a
[1:36:23] man's house must be built on the
[1:36:24] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:36:27] God is Not only to have preeminence in
[1:36:30] the church but he's to have preeminence
[1:36:32] in the family
[1:36:35] the natural family as well as the
[1:36:37] spiritual family
[1:36:39] and those who are part of his Spirit
[1:36:41] spiritual family will build the natural
[1:36:44] according to God's design and purpose
[1:36:47] why because they have their spirit in
[1:36:50] them
[1:36:51] his spirit is dominating them his spirit
[1:36:55] is controlling them
[1:37:00] people want to separate the church from
[1:37:02] the family
[1:37:03] separate the church from their own
[1:37:05] personal you can't do that
[1:37:08] you come to church
[1:37:10] don't know how to live as an individual
[1:37:13] you come to church to know how to live
[1:37:15] as parents you come to church to know
[1:37:18] how to live as children
[1:37:20] to live as a family to live as an
[1:37:23] employee to live as an employer
[1:37:26] you come to church I mean the Bible
[1:37:27] talks about it all yes
[1:37:30] ain't that right
[1:37:32] now so let's look at the family
[1:37:34] structure
[1:37:37] and this is where it rubs a lot of wrong
[1:37:39] I don't think it here in in the building
[1:37:42] but just
[1:37:43] popular opinion and belief
[1:37:46] but man is to be the head of the house
[1:37:49] if you're wanting a right structured
[1:37:51] family according to God's design man is
[1:37:54] the head of the home
[1:37:57] and he's not just to behead of his house
[1:38:00] but of his entire family
[1:38:03] ultimately this puts a great
[1:38:05] responsibility Upon Us daddies Upon Us
[1:38:08] husbands
[1:38:09] the shoulders way heavy with
[1:38:13] responsibility or it should
[1:38:17] we have great responsibility more than
[1:38:19] we realize I think
[1:38:21] as the head of the home we are to be the
[1:38:24] provider for our family
[1:38:26] as the head of the home we are to be
[1:38:28] protector of our family
[1:38:30] we are to be the breadwinners
[1:38:33] ain't that right
[1:38:34] God made man this is the reason why God
[1:38:36] made man in in a different way than he
[1:38:38] made woman
[1:38:40] I don't care what them transgender says
[1:38:42] I don't care what those homosexuals and
[1:38:43] our government and our whatever else God
[1:38:46] made man and woman to be different
[1:38:53] he gave man a masculine Spirit he gave
[1:38:55] woman a feminist Spirit women are not
[1:38:57] they are not to have a masculine
[1:39:00] disposition
[1:39:02] woman isn't made to be rough and tough
[1:39:04] and manly
[1:39:08] hello amen Prophet said God made her to
[1:39:12] be dainty and sweet like real Christian
[1:39:14] sisters are
[1:39:17] and God didn't make a man to be a pretty
[1:39:19] boy
[1:39:23] amen hello
[1:39:25] the world Hollywood and all these
[1:39:28] fashion designers want to take our boys
[1:39:30] and make sissies out of them and make
[1:39:31] them look like sissies
[1:39:33] with these tight jeans and these skinny
[1:39:35] shirts and real tight shirts and these
[1:39:37] little old hairdos and and and and then
[1:39:40] the limb their the Risco limp and all
[1:39:43] that that's nonsense
[1:39:45] reach Brothers
[1:39:47] talked about the fashion of the world
[1:39:49] the woman isn't to be a just he didn't
[1:39:52] preach just against a woman living like
[1:39:54] the Fashions the world you meaning to be
[1:39:56] fashionable either
[1:39:57] not like the world
[1:40:04] brother Brown said a woman's supposed to
[1:40:06] be a woman
[1:40:07] she's supposed to dress like a woman
[1:40:10] when God made a man he made him one
[1:40:12] thing
[1:40:13] and he made woman something else
[1:40:16] when God dresses a man he dresses him
[1:40:18] one way
[1:40:19] and a woman something else
[1:40:22] and the Bible says it's an Abomination
[1:40:24] for a woman to put on a garment that
[1:40:25] pertains to a man
[1:40:27] can you say Amen brother Brown says man
[1:40:29] is becoming more sensified every day and
[1:40:32] women is becoming more masculine every
[1:40:34] day God forbid that our children raised
[1:40:38] up that way and see Daddy and Mama being
[1:40:40] perverted in their ways
[1:40:50] brother Abraham said you man you dress
[1:40:52] like a man
[1:40:53] don't try to be a and wear women's
[1:40:56] clothes
[1:40:57] and women don't you try to be masculine
[1:40:59] and wear men's clothes because God don't
[1:41:01] want you to do it and the Bible condemns
[1:41:04] that now how many believes we got the
[1:41:06] true answers
[1:41:08] we got the true answer the way we should
[1:41:10] live
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:18] see the family must have structure but
[1:41:21] it must be built according to God's
[1:41:22] design
[1:41:25] brother Branham talk to
[1:41:28] when Melchizedek came to visit Abraham
[1:41:32] and he said this he said Sarah being a
[1:41:34] little Pentecostal sister stayed back in
[1:41:36] the tent to take care of her business
[1:41:40] you say what was her business brother
[1:41:41] Brown said she was in the tent cooking
[1:41:49] and he says far different
[1:41:51] from our modern sisters of today
[1:41:54] he said don't it make you feel bad when
[1:41:56] you know Men start talking and women
[1:41:58] come right out and butt right in
[1:42:00] he said it's kind of rude
[1:42:04] so a woman has her place in the home
[1:42:08] but us men have our place in the home
[1:42:12] you believe it
[1:42:14] now I I have to tell you for both of us
[1:42:17] uh men and and sisters and brothers
[1:42:20] uh men didn't decide to be the head of
[1:42:24] the home they didn't choose to be the
[1:42:25] head of the home actually it was God
[1:42:28] that made them the head of the home
[1:42:30] and whether a man wants to or not he's
[1:42:32] going to be responsible before God for
[1:42:35] his home
[1:42:38] ain't that right
[1:42:40] so we didn't design that decide to do it
[1:42:43] God made us to be that way
[1:42:47] and and so brother Branham and talking
[1:42:49] to the husband said you're supposed to
[1:42:51] be the ruler of the house and God will
[1:42:53] hold you responsible for what your wife
[1:42:56] does
[1:43:00] amen
[1:43:02] so a man he says is the head of the
[1:43:05] family he's the head of the house but
[1:43:07] today the woman's the head of the house
[1:43:08] head of the factory head of the church
[1:43:10] and everything else it's because it's
[1:43:12] become a conglomeration of sin
[1:43:18] this pastor ain't led by women
[1:43:21] this church ain't lit by women
[1:43:25] the nation may be led by women and and
[1:43:28] other men's homes may be led by women
[1:43:30] but you're to be the man of the house
[1:43:32] man
[1:43:33] it's got to be the right structure
[1:43:39] so therefore again the responsibility
[1:43:41] lays with on us and we are to be the
[1:43:44] provider uh for the needs of our family
[1:43:47] we are to protect our family at all
[1:43:50] costs
[1:43:54] brother Brown said any true real true
[1:43:56] dad and husband will think of his family
[1:43:58] first before himself
[1:44:01] I'm gonna say that again any true real
[1:44:03] true dad and husband will think of his
[1:44:06] family be first before himself
[1:44:10] now having said that we're going to go
[1:44:12] into some little Rough Waters
[1:44:15] but I hope you're with me
[1:44:19] not only are we to be the protector on
[1:44:21] the natural side
[1:44:23] that we are to be protector on the
[1:44:25] spiritual side
[1:44:28] we are to be we are responsible for the
[1:44:33] spiritual well-being of our family
[1:44:37] you with me
[1:44:39] Hebrews 11 and 7.
[1:44:42] by faith Noah being warned who was
[1:44:46] warned Noah he was the head
[1:44:51] man being warned of God
[1:44:55] of things not as not seen as of yet
[1:45:00] but he moved with fear
[1:45:03] prepared an ark for the saving of his
[1:45:08] house
[1:45:10] family
[1:45:13] you see Noah being the head of the home
[1:45:16] had a vision
[1:45:18] of the future
[1:45:19] of what was coming down the pike
[1:45:24] the wrath of God was going to be poured
[1:45:26] out upon the land and the people
[1:45:30] but God also gave vision and Noah a
[1:45:33] vision of a way of Escape
[1:45:38] you're with me I'm gonna stop here for
[1:45:41] just a moment but do you realize there's
[1:45:43] a lot of people knowing that judgment's
[1:45:45] coming
[1:45:46] but they have no way of Escape they
[1:45:48] don't know the way of Escape
[1:45:52] they have rejected the way of Escape
[1:45:55] right
[1:45:57] but no
[1:46:02] one caused him to move with fear
[1:46:05] and build the ark
[1:46:09] for his family and it was in mind
[1:46:13] ain't Iraq
[1:46:15] so he wasn't one of these modern dads
[1:46:16] that are carried away with the
[1:46:18] entertainment of the day
[1:46:20] he was an all wrapped up in money and
[1:46:23] retirement
[1:46:25] job
[1:46:27] he wasn't a dad that was caught up with
[1:46:30] all the materialistic things that life
[1:46:31] had to offer
[1:46:34] the future mattered to him and his
[1:46:36] family mattered to him
[1:46:38] if God gave him a plan for escape why
[1:46:43] not use it
[1:46:46] now we are children or fathers and
[1:46:50] mothers amen a people that have a vision
[1:46:53] of the wrath of God come and we see it
[1:46:56] we can tell you what's happening in
[1:46:57] politics we can tell you what's
[1:46:59] happening in the church we can tell you
[1:47:00] what's happening all over in the
[1:47:02] American home and around the world we're
[1:47:04] not a people that are confused
[1:47:07] but we also have a way of Escape
[1:47:11] ain't that right
[1:47:13] that's right so therefore God doesn't
[1:47:17] just call us out and give us this Plan
[1:47:20] of Redemption of a way of Escape for us
[1:47:23] used to be oh cared about with
[1:47:25] everything else you realize the it's
[1:47:27] Hollywood that's damning this nation
[1:47:29] it's these preachers that won't preach
[1:47:32] truth that's bamming these needs this
[1:47:35] world
[1:47:36] do you realize it's homes that have
[1:47:39] rejected the word of God that's damning
[1:47:42] this generation amen
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:49] you remember
[1:47:51] the Bible says because they had not a
[1:47:52] love for the truth God sent them strong
[1:47:54] delusion that they believed a lie and be
[1:47:57] damned
[1:47:59] again you say Amen because they had not
[1:48:02] a love for the knowledge of that truth
[1:48:04] because they did not honor God God
[1:48:06] turned them into reprobates
[1:48:08] God turned their minds and twitched to
[1:48:11] them in such a way amen and that they
[1:48:13] and gave them everything to fulfill the
[1:48:16] lusts
[1:48:20] but we're not called to be that
[1:48:24] mm-hmm
[1:48:25] I pray God will help us to realize that
[1:48:28] all this entertainment that people are
[1:48:30] falling in love with what is it doing to
[1:48:32] them they're forgetting the paths of God
[1:48:35] they're forgetting the way of God their
[1:48:37] hearts are becoming so consumed and
[1:48:40] they're fulfilling what the Bible says
[1:48:42] Lover's a pleasure more than lovers of
[1:48:44] God and if you don't love God you will
[1:48:46] never believe in his provided way you'll
[1:48:49] never act upon his provided way that he
[1:48:51] has given for safety
[1:48:53] amen amen
[1:48:55] great
[1:48:56] but Noah was thinking of the future he
[1:48:58] was thinking of his family their
[1:48:59] responsibility was upon him therefore he
[1:49:02] built the ark for the saving of his
[1:49:04] household can you imagine children
[1:49:06] imagine children in this age growing up
[1:49:09] without the right kind of vision in the
[1:49:11] home
[1:49:13] imagine children being raised up in
[1:49:16] church but yet don't have the right kind
[1:49:17] of vision
[1:49:19] come on church it's true now
[1:49:23] can you imagine
[1:49:29] people growing up
[1:49:31] children being raised up
[1:49:38] all they know is the preacher takes too
[1:49:40] long
[1:49:43] all they know is the music ain't right I
[1:49:45] have the time
[1:49:47] all they know is the church ain't run
[1:49:48] right half the time
[1:49:51] all they know is there's there's someone
[1:49:53] out there better I wish I wish there was
[1:49:55] something better we could go
[1:49:57] I wish there was this I wish there was
[1:49:59] that and that's all the children raise
[1:50:00] up to know
[1:50:02] they don't have confidence in the
[1:50:04] preaching they don't have confidence in
[1:50:05] the singing they don't have confidence
[1:50:06] in the musician they don't have
[1:50:08] confidence in nothing freedom amen but
[1:50:11] we will give him confidence in movies we
[1:50:13] give them confidence in the ball game we
[1:50:15] give them confidence in the world
[1:50:16] entertainment
[1:50:21] give them confidence in their retirement
[1:50:25] that ain't guaranteed
[1:50:27] you could die tomorrow
[1:50:30] and all that time you miss church to
[1:50:32] come amen for your job all that time you
[1:50:34] miss prayer and all that time you miss
[1:50:36] the things of God you could be having
[1:50:39] that amen and meet with God
[1:50:42] you ain't got no time guaranteed you
[1:50:45] none of us has got time
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] I thought it was a little girl brother
[1:50:51] Andrew was telling me went to he went to
[1:50:53] a funeral yesterday for a 14 year old
[1:50:54] girl
[1:50:59] raised up in a message Church
[1:51:04] her daddy was a FedEx driver
[1:51:07] still dancing they were they were just
[1:51:10] close
[1:51:11] so I won't go to work with you he said
[1:51:12] no you can't go work mama says no
[1:51:15] no she didn't you don't need to go to
[1:51:16] work today now I want to ride with you
[1:51:19] so Dad reluctantly gave in to her
[1:51:22] riding down just riding down doing his
[1:51:24] job
[1:51:25] everything right
[1:51:27] turn the curve and she fell out broke
[1:51:29] her neck killed her instantly
[1:51:34] now what I'm saying is life ain't
[1:51:35] guaranteed us
[1:51:40] right
[1:51:42] 14 year old girl what if she was raised
[1:51:44] up not respecting the preacher not
[1:51:47] respecting the church not respect to
[1:51:48] nothing
[1:51:51] all consumed in the world and
[1:51:54] entertainment
[1:51:59] you understand what I'm saying
[1:52:03] I pray for that that family
[1:52:08] but her husband said her daddy sat on
[1:52:11] the front row
[1:52:12] amen that preacher
[1:52:15] he was an aide to the pastor
[1:52:18] he was a help
[1:52:19] constantly helping supporting whatever
[1:52:22] he could do
[1:52:23] that's the way the girl learned
[1:52:26] you understand what I'm saying honor God
[1:52:32] now Matthew 6 33 Jesus said seek ye
[1:52:35] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:52:36] righteousness and all these things shall
[1:52:38] be added unto you
[1:52:39] you see seek ye first everybody say seek
[1:52:42] ye first
[1:52:43] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:52:46] teach your family to seek ye first the
[1:52:49] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:52:52] all these other things will be added
[1:52:55] now now notice brother Brandon after
[1:52:57] reading that says all material material
[1:53:00] Necessities everybody say necessities
[1:53:02] now now the Necessities ain't ones
[1:53:07] necessity is what you have need of
[1:53:11] all material Necessities will be added
[1:53:13] unto us can you say Amen so he says in
[1:53:17] another place any Christian will think
[1:53:19] of others before himself every Christian
[1:53:22] tries to put God first his family second
[1:53:24] he's number three
[1:53:28] in another place he says people of God
[1:53:30] are not Material minded they are
[1:53:32] christ-minded they do not seek the
[1:53:34] treasures that are below they are they
[1:53:36] seek those which are above
[1:53:38] it is absolutely true the majority of
[1:53:41] Christians are not wealthy whether they
[1:53:43] are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus
[1:53:45] day it was true in Paul's day and it
[1:53:47] should be true today
[1:53:48] oh it is not true today for the
[1:53:51] laodicean age is one of vast wealth
[1:53:53] where often the Criterion of
[1:53:55] spirituality is an abundance of Earthly
[1:53:58] Goods my how rich the church is in Goods
[1:54:01] but how important Spirit blessed it be
[1:54:03] ye poor see for yours is the kingdom of
[1:54:06] God the kingdom of God is Not meat and
[1:54:09] drink it is not Material it is within us
[1:54:12] a rich man is rich in God not in worldly
[1:54:16] things
[1:54:19] of course this this this kind of talk is
[1:54:21] is foreign to the world
[1:54:26] because of the desire for materialistic
[1:54:28] wealth
[1:54:30] and they tend to think that we're not
[1:54:32] balanced they tend to think we're out of
[1:54:34] our heads
[1:54:40] but brother Branham said this we have
[1:54:42] more wealth than we ever had and yet
[1:54:44] less is being accomplished spiritually
[1:54:49] now I'm going to try to wrap this up
[1:54:52] the Revelations 2 and 9 says I Know Thy
[1:54:54] Works God talking to that age I Know Thy
[1:54:56] works that tribulation and poverty
[1:54:59] and then brother Branham comments on
[1:55:02] what the spirit is actually saying
[1:55:04] all Christ the spirit I see your poverty
[1:55:07] I see your need you haven't very much if
[1:55:10] anything to boast of materialistic
[1:55:12] things
[1:55:14] see what you did have has been taken
[1:55:16] from you you gladly gave up your
[1:55:18] possession in exchange for Eternal ones
[1:55:21] you are laughed at you are scorned you
[1:55:23] don't have material resources to fall
[1:55:25] back on but you are rich in spite of it
[1:55:28] all for your security lies in him who is
[1:55:31] your shield and exceeding great reward
[1:55:35] ain't that right
[1:55:37] now there's nothing against wealthy
[1:55:39] people
[1:55:41] some of God's people are wealthy
[1:55:44] but it isn't not money with money that
[1:55:46] God works that's what the prophet says
[1:55:48] he moves by his spirit and that moving
[1:55:50] of the spirit comes only to a life
[1:55:52] consecrated
[1:55:54] to the word
[1:55:56] and you say man
[1:55:58] now if you allow me just a little bit
[1:55:59] more time
[1:56:01] as as I get ready to close but
[1:56:04] being the head of the home
[1:56:06] it's not all about bossing everyone
[1:56:13] Brother Brad said man's not measured by
[1:56:15] muscles
[1:56:17] that's Beast Brute
[1:56:20] man's measured by character
[1:56:23] and if you're a Son of God you're
[1:56:26] measured by your character
[1:56:29] now there are two sides to everything
[1:56:32] one side of it
[1:56:35] there are men who let anything and
[1:56:38] everything go within the family
[1:56:40] he has no vision for the family all he
[1:56:42] knows he got married and had children
[1:56:46] but he has no vision for the family he
[1:56:48] has no true relationship with his wife
[1:56:51] because he's constantly gone
[1:56:53] Galley bouting in everything that he
[1:56:56] wants to do
[1:56:58] that poor woman stays home with the kid
[1:56:59] trying to discipline trying to do
[1:57:01] everything else
[1:57:03] I want to say this don't you realize men
[1:57:05] that you're women you're you're women
[1:57:08] we're not Mormons
[1:57:14] your wife fights goes through things
[1:57:18] the devil attacks her in her mind
[1:57:21] the devil tells her just just a lot of
[1:57:25] times maybe we feel lousy about life and
[1:57:27] we feel like we ain't an accomplishment
[1:57:29] the devil fights her on the same things
[1:57:32] she ain't a good mother ain't a good
[1:57:33] wife she ain't doing things right and
[1:57:35] ain't doing this and while we're all out
[1:57:37] Galloping around the devil's playing
[1:57:39] with her mind
[1:57:44] but see he has no vision for the family
[1:57:46] he has no true relationship with the
[1:57:47] wife and he's not involved in his
[1:57:49] children's life
[1:57:51] the wife has left to make all the
[1:57:53] decisions and in many cases the children
[1:57:54] are left to make their own decisions
[1:57:56] left to their own devices
[1:57:59] and and I I'm just going to be true you
[1:58:01] can take it whatever you want to that's
[1:58:03] fine but that's the way the devil wants
[1:58:05] it
[1:58:06] [Applause]
[1:58:07] he wants to diminish the role of the
[1:58:09] father he wants to diminish the role of
[1:58:11] headship in the home
[1:58:14] to where we make the weaker vessel the
[1:58:17] head of the home the Bible calls the
[1:58:20] woman the weaker vessel
[1:58:24] is that right
[1:58:26] so the devil she's easy more easily
[1:58:29] convinced than a man is
[1:58:32] she's more easily swayed than a man is
[1:58:37] great she's more emotional than a man is
[1:58:44] and the devil knows how to attack the
[1:58:46] home
[1:58:50] so many times dad is too busy doing his
[1:58:52] own things fulfilling his own dreams
[1:58:57] and today it's become more
[1:59:02] you know uh uh
[1:59:05] then just going to work and providing
[1:59:07] for the family it's become a crave
[1:59:12] for materialistic things
[1:59:14] we are to provide for our family
[1:59:17] but when a spirit gets a hold of a man
[1:59:19] to where he's got to have more than what
[1:59:21] he what he want has
[1:59:26] and it causes him to forsake his role as
[1:59:29] head of that home
[1:59:32] something wrong
[1:59:38] today's success is defined as to having
[1:59:41] wealth and materialistic things
[1:59:44] the average family is too busy trying to
[1:59:46] keep up with the rest of the world
[1:59:48] if our neighbors or friends have it we
[1:59:50] want it too
[1:59:54] we get a new bowl last year we want one
[1:59:56] today a new one
[2:00:00] it's it's we're thriving our joy only
[2:00:03] comes by the things we get things we
[2:00:06] purchase
[2:00:07] our money
[2:00:10] and we've lost the happiness in our
[2:00:12] children we lose the happiness in our
[2:00:15] wife
[2:00:20] and I'm going to be honest with you it's
[2:00:22] created in an unhappy unsatisfied
[2:00:26] atmosphere within the home
[2:00:29] mother is unhappy father is unhappy
[2:00:32] children are unhappy brother REM said
[2:00:34] happiness does not consist of how much
[2:00:37] of this world's Goods you own it's how
[2:00:40] contented you are with the portion
[2:00:42] that's allotted to you
[2:00:46] that's what happiness means find Christ
[2:00:49] and you've got happiness
[2:01:00] there's a lot of men make a decent
[2:01:02] living but they got to have more
[2:01:05] there's something that drives them
[2:01:08] it could be that they're driven by their
[2:01:10] own lusts they could be that the wife is
[2:01:12] driving them
[2:01:14] to have more
[2:01:16] it could be that he is persuaded that
[2:01:19] him being able to give his family
[2:01:22] what they want in this world's Goods
[2:01:26] is all that is required of him
[2:01:28] well it's not
[2:01:33] on the other side of the coin
[2:01:36] there are men who think being the head
[2:01:38] of the home means that everyone within
[2:01:40] the home needs to somehow render
[2:01:42] obesians to them
[2:01:44] they're the king of the house and demand
[2:01:46] recognition as that
[2:01:48] they don't recognize the wife as being
[2:01:51] the queen of the home
[2:01:53] they just treat her any old way they
[2:01:55] don't care what the children do as long
[2:01:57] as they acknowledge Him as being the
[2:01:59] head and do what he does and and if he
[2:02:01] commands them to do this they they they
[2:02:03] do it they ask how high or jump you know
[2:02:06] they ask how high
[2:02:09] wait
[2:02:10] and yet no spiritual headship whatsoever
[2:02:14] we make sure our children learn how to
[2:02:16] work
[2:02:18] love
[2:02:20] but never teach them faithfulness to the
[2:02:22] house of God
[2:02:25] you understand what I'm saying
[2:02:27] so they take on this attitude do as I
[2:02:29] say not as I do
[2:02:31] they want everything their way
[2:02:33] because they are the head of the whole
[2:02:46] you know
[2:02:50] if you look at the structure of God as I
[2:02:53] get ready to close but as you look at
[2:02:55] the structure
[2:02:57] that God has for the home
[2:02:59] the structure of the home does not end
[2:03:02] everybody say it does not end
[2:03:05] with man being the top dog
[2:03:15] I know that hurts our pride but it's
[2:03:17] true
[2:03:19] God's design for the home is not man
[2:03:22] being Top Dog
[2:03:26] First Corinthians 11 3 but I would have
[2:03:28] you know that the head of every man is
[2:03:34] who's Top Dog
[2:03:36] who's the head
[2:03:38] so who's actually the head of the home
[2:03:41] Christ is the head of the home
[2:03:43] can you say Amen
[2:03:45] but I would have you know that the head
[2:03:47] of every man is Christ and the head of
[2:03:49] woman is the man and the head of Christ
[2:03:51] is
[2:03:52] God
[2:03:54] so then we understand that us brethren
[2:03:58] we have a headship
[2:04:01] woman has her headship but we have our
[2:04:04] headship and as the woman is responsible
[2:04:06] to to a her husband so are we
[2:04:10] responsible to our Lord
[2:04:17] as the woman is to submit to her
[2:04:19] headship so is the man to surrender to
[2:04:21] his headship
[2:04:23] and you say man
[2:04:25] you love the Lord
[2:04:29] and as the woman brings confusion in the
[2:04:32] home because she does not surrender to
[2:04:33] her to hit you up she's going to do her
[2:04:34] own thing
[2:04:36] have her own bank account have her own
[2:04:38] this and have her on this and have her
[2:04:40] on that and have her on that and man
[2:04:43] your husband don't you touch any of this
[2:04:45] this is my stuff
[2:04:46] and now whatever you got belongs to me
[2:04:48] too
[2:04:51] what a home
[2:04:54] men trying to bring water in the home
[2:04:58] as long as well I'm going to do my own
[2:04:59] thing
[2:05:00] making our own plans and her own this
[2:05:02] and her own that the husband's just
[2:05:04] barely hanging in there
[2:05:09] that brings confusion to the whole
[2:05:13] time amen but let's take it to the men
[2:05:18] You Gonna Do Your Own Thing when the
[2:05:19] word says not to
[2:05:22] word says forsake not the assembling of
[2:05:24] yourselves together even the morning but
[2:05:25] I don't care
[2:05:27] I'll go hunting
[2:05:28] I don't give a hoot
[2:05:31] I'm gonna do my own thing
[2:05:33] I'll go I can go fishing
[2:05:35] I'm gonna go work
[2:05:37] I don't care
[2:05:39] that's the attitude you play
[2:05:44] you're bringing the same confusion and
[2:05:46] then we want peace in the home we we
[2:05:49] want an atmosphere in the home we want
[2:05:51] God to fight our battles
[2:05:56] but we totally ignore the headship
[2:06:01] we want God to respect our prayers
[2:06:06] it's true
[2:06:08] so you you see you you just have to
[2:06:10] forgive me but a man that doesn't want
[2:06:12] to take any kind of responsibility of
[2:06:15] raising and training his children is
[2:06:17] selfish
[2:06:19] I don't care if it's in the natural
[2:06:21] sense or the spiritual sense
[2:06:23] you are obligated we as fathers and I am
[2:06:27] talking to this and I'm not saying
[2:06:28] you're not so so so I'm just I'm I'm
[2:06:30] encouraging you because Satan is
[2:06:33] fighting us on tooth and nail he is
[2:06:35] fighting us on every hand trying to
[2:06:37] bring our hands down and weaken us
[2:06:41] that I'm telling you
[2:06:43] it's not just our responsibility to take
[2:06:45] care of our family in the natural it is
[2:06:48] the spiritual side too
[2:06:56] a man that requires his family to obey
[2:06:59] him and yet uses his god-given position
[2:07:01] for his own gain is selfish
[2:07:05] there are men in this world that are
[2:07:07] great providers for their family
[2:07:09] they are great Protectors of their
[2:07:11] family when it comes to a natural enemy
[2:07:14] there are great interactors with the
[2:07:16] family when it comes to sports and
[2:07:18] hunting and fishing and entertainment
[2:07:20] and all of that there's there's fathers
[2:07:22] that are great fathers in all of that
[2:07:25] sure but when it comes to the spiritual
[2:07:27] things the family suffers
[2:07:29] because most men have no interest in
[2:07:32] spiritual things
[2:07:36] work and pleasure takes the preeminence
[2:07:38] over Church attendance
[2:07:40] entertainment takes the preeminence over
[2:07:42] prayer life
[2:07:44] the world has more appeal than does a
[2:07:47] consecrated life
[2:07:48] can you say Amen
[2:07:50] now I know I know that that we are
[2:07:53] helpless to make our family Christians
[2:07:55] our children Christians and all that and
[2:07:57] and each each member of our family has
[2:08:01] to have an experience with the Lord for
[2:08:02] themselves we cannot help what our
[2:08:05] children do when they grow up uh and and
[2:08:08] leave the house and all these things but
[2:08:10] but I got to tell you but that does not
[2:08:13] diminish your responsibility and how
[2:08:16] important you as a father are in your
[2:08:20] home
[2:08:23] even when your children leave you're
[2:08:25] still important
[2:08:30] this is all right
[2:08:33] we learned that by job's action
[2:08:37] the Bible said job was a man that was
[2:08:39] perfect and upright and one that feared
[2:08:41] God and issued evil he knew words he he
[2:08:43] shunned evil
[2:08:47] and this is what every young lady should
[2:08:49] look for in a man
[2:08:51] the husband
[2:08:53] job had seven sons and three daughters
[2:08:57] here's what the Bible says Job 1 and 4
[2:09:00] his sons went and feasted in their
[2:09:02] houses
[2:09:04] everyone is day and sent and called for
[2:09:07] their three sisters to eat and to drink
[2:09:09] with them and it was so when the days of
[2:09:11] their feasting were gone about that job
[2:09:14] sent and Sanctified them and Rose up
[2:09:16] early in the morning and offered
[2:09:18] offerings according to the number of
[2:09:20] them all
[2:09:22] for job said it may be that my sons have
[2:09:25] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[2:09:29] thus did job continually
[2:09:33] he didn't do it just one time he did it
[2:09:36] continually
[2:09:37] his children was out out of the home
[2:09:39] that he
[2:09:44] that was stand before God for his family
[2:09:48] God just in case
[2:09:50] just in case
[2:09:52] they have done something to the sin
[2:09:53] against you I'm going to offer a
[2:09:55] sacrifice for them
[2:09:56] can you say man
[2:09:58] brother Brown said see his children got
[2:10:00] married and went off in different ways
[2:10:02] and as they do like birds from a nest
[2:10:04] job knowing that there was no other way
[2:10:06] not a possible way that man could ever
[2:10:09] approach God and have fellowship with
[2:10:11] him see only through the sacrificial
[2:10:13] lamb to the blood see job said per
[2:10:16] Adventure my children might have sinned
[2:10:17] I'll offer a lamb for them Something
[2:10:20] Told job he had better make it ready
[2:10:22] he'd better be ready see he felt that
[2:10:26] urgency I've got offer for them church I
[2:10:29] hope you daddies and mamas feel the
[2:10:31] urgency of today
[2:10:34] hey man I hope we feel that urgency and
[2:10:37] he said and then when he made the
[2:10:39] offering for the sacrificial lamb for
[2:10:40] his children one day it happened one day
[2:10:43] it happened the storms come and killed
[2:10:45] them all in Fire and so forth and took
[2:10:47] them but before this happened job made
[2:10:50] sure that each one was under the blood
[2:10:55] hey man
[2:10:58] another place brother Brown said job was
[2:11:00] mindful of his children to make a
[2:11:01] preparation for their sin and father and
[2:11:04] mother if we would quit spending money
[2:11:06] on our children learning tap dancing and
[2:11:08] things like that and some kind of how to
[2:11:10] be an actor and put more time a pleading
[2:11:13] the blood of Jesus up over them and
[2:11:16] showing them love and fellowship we'd
[2:11:17] get along better the child would too
[2:11:20] teach your child see I believe if every
[2:11:22] parent would take their child see the
[2:11:24] first the parent come back to God and
[2:11:26] take the beer out of the ice box take
[2:11:28] the cards off the table oh you say it's
[2:11:31] innocent you see what it hatches out
[2:11:32] brother I wouldn't let a card light on
[2:11:34] my ground no sir it's it's the devil's
[2:11:37] thing keep them away from it you say
[2:11:40] your old-fashioned brother Branham well
[2:11:41] it was an old-fashioned gospel that
[2:11:43] saved me it's an old-fashioned salvation
[2:11:46] that makes me happy it was an
[2:11:48] old-fashioned holy ghost that healed me
[2:11:50] it's the same that's going to take us
[2:11:52] home to Glory sure teach your child see
[2:11:55] looky here look what the world can do
[2:11:57] now this little clean thing this little
[2:12:00] clean things I suppose I ain't I ain't
[2:12:03] got nothing do with it but looky here
[2:12:05] every kid in town could tell you who
[2:12:06] Davy Crockett was my it's on his
[2:12:09] teaspoon on his hat on his tie it's
[2:12:11] everywhere Davy Crockett see the world
[2:12:13] taught the children see everybody or
[2:12:16] America buy a fad taught All The
[2:12:19] Children See About Davy Crockett and
[2:12:21] they wanted to do it all today with
[2:12:22] other things too it's just a ad and that
[2:12:25] and that and see the world taught the
[2:12:27] children see they could tell you he was
[2:12:30] from Tennessee when he was born and all
[2:12:32] about it he wore a skin hat and
[2:12:34] killed a bear when he was a three you
[2:12:36] know all these kind of fiction things
[2:12:38] they they know all about David Crockett
[2:12:40] see and you're willing and like to tell
[2:12:43] him about it see well if if they could
[2:12:46] learn about Davy Crockett and dress like
[2:12:48] Davy Crockett and act like Davy Crockett
[2:12:50] surely you could teach them about Jesus
[2:12:51] Christ and they would act like Jesus
[2:12:54] Christ and love Jesus Christ as well as
[2:12:56] they could love David Crockett see
[2:12:58] Fellowship around the Bible tell them
[2:13:00] Jesus loves them see Davy Crockett is
[2:13:03] true but now killing that bear that
[2:13:05] three years old I doubt that see a lot
[2:13:08] of those things he believed a lot of
[2:13:10] fiction a lot of them stories are
[2:13:12] fiction here when I was a little boy I
[2:13:14] had such an admiration for William Tell
[2:13:16] he shot an apple off his boy's head see
[2:13:19] when I got down in Switzerland there's
[2:13:21] not a word of a truth it was all fiction
[2:13:24] see that's right there was a William
[2:13:26] Tell true see but he never shot no apple
[2:13:29] off his boy's head nothing about that
[2:13:31] but it's fiction stories that's told
[2:13:33] let's get the truth to the people
[2:13:37] let's not fellowship with that let's
[2:13:40] fellowship with God and with the Bible
[2:13:42] and with the Holy Spirit make
[2:13:43] preparations for our children
[2:13:47] is this all right
[2:13:50] brethren
[2:13:52] we are not miracle workers
[2:13:55] We Are Men of like passion
[2:13:58] we are men that fight discouragements we
[2:14:01] are men that goes through things mind
[2:14:03] battles
[2:14:04] Temptations
[2:14:08] we are men that
[2:14:10] just common flesh and blood men
[2:14:15] we fall got to get back up
[2:14:21] tell you what we're facing an enemy that
[2:14:23] we
[2:14:24] in our own selves we
[2:14:27] we we can't defeat
[2:14:30] Satan's more than a match for each of us
[2:14:34] you're God's placed us as the head of
[2:14:36] our home and yet the enemy is more than
[2:14:38] a match for us
[2:14:40] can you imagine what the enemy is to
[2:14:41] your wife and your children
[2:14:47] but God made it that way
[2:14:51] and this is why I would read that
[2:14:52] scripture in the beginning our opening
[2:14:54] scripture greater is he
[2:14:56] that is in you than he that is in this
[2:14:58] world
[2:15:00] you are a god little children
[2:15:04] see our strength is in him
[2:15:07] our help is in the Lord
[2:15:10] our answer is in him
[2:15:12] you may not know what to do
[2:15:14] but if you just rely upon him
[2:15:17] how we need men a prayer
[2:15:20] how we need men of dedication and
[2:15:23] consecration
[2:15:25] how we need fathers that'll know what it
[2:15:27] is to get alone with God and pray
[2:15:30] you say well I take my family on
[2:15:32] vacation that's not the answer
[2:15:34] oh that helps for a little bit maybe it
[2:15:36] gets you away from your problems but
[2:15:38] that's just as good as television and
[2:15:40] books and all that there's guys that I
[2:15:42] loved reading books and it takes my mind
[2:15:43] off of things and all that but when the
[2:15:45] book is done it's I'm back to troubles
[2:15:47] my mind's back in it you understand what
[2:15:49] I'm saying you know how the devil does
[2:15:51] this and we can get into entertainment
[2:15:53] we can go this we can go to Honolulu
[2:15:55] every every week your troubles are still
[2:15:57] there you ain't the answers
[2:16:00] what's the answers is God
[2:16:03] the answer says God
[2:16:06] can you say man
[2:16:08] and God has called us to be leaders as
[2:16:11] head of our home God has called us to be
[2:16:13] leaders and and leaders do not follow
[2:16:15] behind leaders and leaders don't just
[2:16:18] say do this do that do this but as the
[2:16:21] as the prophet told us leaders he
[2:16:23] described it in the Jeffersonville the
[2:16:25] fire fire department and and the the
[2:16:27] Louisville remember there's that big old
[2:16:29] house fire whatever it was and there's
[2:16:31] the Jeffersonville Department squirt a
[2:16:32] little Waters over here boys squirt a
[2:16:34] little water over here wasn't a thing
[2:16:36] you know but here comes that Louisville
[2:16:37] Department of boys
[2:16:39] barely didn't even get stopped and the
[2:16:42] chief was on top of that ladder that's
[2:16:44] it follow me boys and within minutes
[2:16:46] they got the fire out
[2:16:48] it shows what a true leader is
[2:16:52] follow me family
[2:16:55] follow me
[2:16:57] you want to know what it is follow me
[2:16:59] I'll show you
[2:17:01] as the head of the home as Leaders of
[2:17:03] our family you want to know where the
[2:17:04] power of God is follow me I'll show you
[2:17:08] I ain't gonna direct you over here
[2:17:10] you ain't gonna follow me out in the
[2:17:12] world you ain't gonna follow me into all
[2:17:13] these entertainments you ain't gonna
[2:17:15] follow me I I ain't gonna lead you into
[2:17:17] all these other things I'm going to lead
[2:17:19] you right back to God
[2:17:21] we're the power of God is
[2:17:23] we're the angels of God are pleased to
[2:17:25] come down in our home and sanctify and
[2:17:28] sanction Our Lives
[2:17:31] can you say Amen if the musicians will
[2:17:34] come
[2:17:43] brother Brown said we have a home life
[2:17:45] crisis it seems like the home life is
[2:17:47] running out into shallow water
[2:17:49] it used to be in a home that father the
[2:17:51] head of the house
[2:17:53] would sit down of a morning and would
[2:17:55] speak with this family and would and
[2:17:57] they would all take out the family old
[2:17:59] Family Bible and read just a little bit
[2:18:02] and all gather around the table and have
[2:18:04] prayer
[2:18:05] you don't see that no more
[2:18:08] and when the day was done and Maul was
[2:18:10] had the dishes washed they'd all Gather
[2:18:12] in
[2:18:13] and read some more of the Bible and pray
[2:18:15] before going to bed
[2:18:18] juvenile juvenile delinquency certainly
[2:18:23] it was a hard thing to find in them days
[2:18:26] the boys all went to the fields to work
[2:18:28] the girls helped mom with the washing
[2:18:31] all down at the creek
[2:18:33] but today we just push a little button
[2:18:35] and the dishes are all done and Maul's
[2:18:36] in the car and gone to the card party or
[2:18:39] out she's ratting around over the
[2:18:40] streets
[2:18:42] the work's done by a tractor we just
[2:18:44] don't have nothing but a bunch of lazy
[2:18:46] Idol people
[2:18:48] and home life is so neglected till the
[2:18:50] Bible is laid back
[2:18:52] so they'd have to hunt for an hour to
[2:18:55] find one in many homes in America
[2:18:59] you know and this is what we're facing
[2:19:01] I say to you that Satan has conquered
[2:19:04] most American families today
[2:19:10] you hear that phrase The Last of the
[2:19:12] Mohicans
[2:19:15] were that last
[2:19:18] were the last
[2:19:24] and this explains the Mind battles that
[2:19:26] you go through this explains the
[2:19:28] pressures
[2:19:30] that were fighting
[2:19:33] let's just explains why Satan wants to
[2:19:35] get our spirit and so riled up
[2:19:37] [Music]
[2:19:40] it's in these times that we got to find
[2:19:42] a place alone dads
[2:19:44] husbands
[2:19:46] get along with God
[2:19:48] you say well I try
[2:19:50] I can't feeling how long have you stayed
[2:19:53] there 10 minutes
[2:19:56] five minutes
[2:19:59] what about standing until you hear God
[2:20:01] Speak
[2:20:03] till you get the answer
[2:20:06] God help us all
[2:20:08] from this preacher all the way to the
[2:20:10] back door God help us all
[2:20:12] can you say man
[2:20:14] you love the Lord
[2:20:17] you see Ephesians 6 12 for we wrestle
[2:20:19] not against flesh and blood but against
[2:20:21] principalities against Powers against
[2:20:23] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[2:20:25] against spiritual weakness in high
[2:20:28] places so you see as fathers we're
[2:20:31] realizing we realize in this age that
[2:20:34] our wife is fighting more than just
[2:20:36] physical battles our children are
[2:20:38] fighting more than just natural battles
[2:20:40] it's it's it's it's it's it's an enemy
[2:20:42] it's not flesh and blood it's it's an
[2:20:45] enemy that's trying to come in and and
[2:20:47] divide the family separate the family
[2:20:49] destroy us get us in a carnal state
[2:20:54] can you say man
[2:20:57] God bless you
[2:21:01] and again I say Happy Father's Day to
[2:21:03] you all
[2:21:05] thank God for you fathers you husbands
[2:21:08] that are still standing
