[46:24] Oh, I've made
[46:28] my decision.
[46:32] Oh, I'm going all the way.

[46:55] Bless the name of the Lord. All the way.
[47:01] I'm going all the way.
[47:05] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[47:14] Amen. Do you have that determination
[47:17] &gt;&gt; going all the way? Amen. And uh we're
[47:22] fixing to cross the finish line and um
[47:27] we certainly can't uh turn back now.
[47:30] Amen. Too close to the end. And um I'm
[47:36] looking forward to it. It's good to uh
[47:38] see everyone. Good to have brother Bob,
[47:40] sister Janice Amen back with us. Amen.
[47:44] And um um the musicians can be

[48:12] all when you're gone. And um brother
[48:16] Amos said they had some wonderful
[48:18] services and so we thankful to the Lord
[48:21] for that. Amen. Uh if you have your
[48:25] Bibles, we're going to turn to the book
[48:26] of John.
[48:28] the um 14th chapter. And just to remind
[48:34] you that um I won't be here this coming

[48:43] brother Fred Mullins's
[48:46] and um so covet your prayers uh for that

[49:04] certainly appreciate Brother Terry and
[49:07] appreciate um uh the ministers here just
[49:11] love the message and love God's people
[49:14] and doing everything to to make us
[49:17] ready. Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; And uh so uh but John the 14th chapter,
[49:24] we'll uh read there, but let's just bow
[49:27] our heads in a word of prayer. Amen. I
[49:32] certainly believe that we need him.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Father,
[49:37] Lord, as we approach this sacred time,
[49:42] Lord, we realize the responsibility that
[49:46] you have put upon our shoulders as
[49:48] ministers of the gospel.
[49:51] And Lord, I certainly want to do my
[49:54] part. I don't want to be sluggish,
[49:56] Father, in the call that you've called
[50:00] me to the work. And I just pray, Lord,
[50:04] that you would help me just to yield
[50:06] myself, Lord, to thee. And
[50:09] Lord, as you have wrote this book,
[50:13] Father, and you inspired men
[50:17] and and gave them that uncction to write
[50:20] your words. And I'm just asking that
[50:23] that same spirit would come among us,
[50:27] Lord, and inspire me, Father, to speak
[50:31] your word and inspire the people to
[50:35] believe the word. give us understanding
[50:37] and father the needs that are here that
[50:40] are present or maybe those that couldn't
[50:43] come tonight due to sickness or whatever
[50:46] it would be I pray that you would help
[50:48] them. Father, we just commit it into
[50:51] your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and and to um just to
[51:01] remind you that brother Hunter is having
[51:04] his meeting uh starting tonight and uh
[51:08] so um I think the services are uh 7:00
[51:14] nightly and uh Saturday is uh 6. will
[51:21] start at 6 pm. And so, um, I'm sure
[51:26] you'll be blessed if you're able to make
[51:28] it, uh, there. Praise the Lord. But, uh,
[51:31] John, uh, the 14th chapter
[51:36] and, um, we want to look at the first
[51:39] verse u Jesus saying, let not your heart
[51:43] be troubled. You believe in God, believe
[51:46] also in me.
[51:49] In my father's house are many mansions.
[51:52] If it were not so, I would have told
[51:55] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[52:01] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[52:04] I will come again and receive you unto
[52:07] myself that where I am, there you may be
[52:12] also. Amen. You can have your seats this
[52:16] evening.
[52:19] And uh just taking a title, there is a
[52:24] place prepared for me.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And uh that ought to give us all hope
[52:31] that there is a place prepared
[52:34] &gt;&gt; here. uh Jesus
[52:38] um
[52:39] is talking of the future and he's
[52:43] telling us of what will be not uh what
[52:48] may happen you know uh but what will
[52:52] happen what will be and so he goes to
[52:56] make preparation if if if you're
[52:59] expecting something if you're expecting
[53:01] a future event then you you plan for
[53:05] that event. You um you know uh you
[53:09] mothers that you know you having your
[53:11] baby and uh Ann and and Branson fixing
[53:16] to have have their first child and so
[53:20] they've been preparing getting ready and
[53:23] because they're under expectation
[53:27] for uh uh the arrival of their their
[53:32] child,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; right? And so Jesus is saying, "I'm I'm
[53:37] going to prepare a place for you and and
[53:40] because uh he knows, you know, uh he he
[53:45] knew that that we would be there,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; right?"
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And so you see, God has an infinite
[53:51] mind.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; And um and that is as the prophet would
[53:56] tell us, that's how he knows uh the end
[53:59] from the beginning. He's not taking
[54:02] things on a daily basis, just a day by
[54:04] day.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; But he knows the end from the beginning.
[54:08] So nothing happens by chance.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Um
[54:12] uh your your salvation, your natural
[54:15] birth, all these things. He already knew
[54:17] all this to happen. So I read you a uh
[54:20] just a series of scriptures here. Uh
[54:23] John 15:18. known unto God are all his
[54:27] works from the beginning of the world.
[54:30] Isaiah 46:9, "Remember the things, the
[54:33] former things of old, for I am God,
[54:36] there is none else. I am God, there is
[54:38] none like me, declaring the end from the
[54:42] beginning,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; and from ancient times the thing that
[54:45] are not yet done."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Uh saying, "My counsel shall stand, and
[54:49] I will do all my pleasure." Yeah.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29:11. For I know the thoughts
[54:55] that I think toward you, sayeth the
[54:56] Lord, thoughts of peace, not of evil, to
[54:59] give you an expected end.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he
[55:07] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[55:10] the image of his son, that he might be
[55:13] the firstborn among many brethren.
[55:15] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[55:18] he also called. Whom he called, he also
[55:21] justified. Whom he justified, them he
[55:24] also glorified. Ain't that right? 2
[55:27] Thessalonians 2:13. But we are bound to
[55:30] give thanks always to God. For you,
[55:32] brethren, beloved of the Lord, because
[55:35] God hath from the beginning chosen you
[55:39] to salvation. God hath from the
[55:42] beginning chosen you to salvation. We
[55:46] find Jude 4. For there are certain men
[55:49] crept in unawares who were before of old
[55:54] ordained to this condemnation.
[55:57] Amen. So when did God express his love
[56:01] toward us? Was it when we uh had first
[56:04] uh got a religious thought or uh a
[56:07] feeling come over us? Or was it when we
[56:11] first asked him into our heart or uh
[56:14] when we, you know, sung our first gospel
[56:17] song or preached our first uh uh sermon
[56:21] or whatever? Well, you know, uh Paul
[56:25] would ex, uh tell us through, uh the
[56:28] story of of Jacob and Esau, and he wrote
[56:32] of them saying God declared,
[56:36] uh that he loved Jacob and hated Esau.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Now, listen to that. God declared that
[56:43] he he hated Esau and yet he loved Jacob
[56:48] before the children were yet born and
[56:51] before they had done good or good or
[56:53] evil. Ain't that right?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; So, so we find that it's always before
[56:58] the foundation of the world. And so the
[57:01] prophet says now God before the
[57:03] foundation of the world who knew the end
[57:07] from the beginning. He knew the end from
[57:10] the beginning by fornowledge. He elected
[57:14] where to cut. He knew where to cut.
[57:17] Amen. And so he knowed the difference
[57:20] between Esau and Jacob. He knows the
[57:23] difference between sinner and saint. He
[57:26] knowed the difference. SEE, HE NOT
[57:28] presently knows. He knew back before the
[57:32] foundation of the world. He knows every
[57:35] motive of every heart. knows the motive
[57:38] of every heart. So he elected us before
[57:41] the foundation of the world and put our
[57:44] names on the lamb's book of life.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God knew HE HE KNEW WHERE TO
[57:51] CUT. He knew every every individual from
[57:54] the the THE START OF TIME ALL THE WAY TO
[57:57] THE end of time. He knows every
[58:00] individual and he knows what is in the
[58:02] heart. He knows where that person is.
[58:04] And so he doesn't have to wait for you
[58:07] to do something and and good or bad or
[58:10] whatever. He doesn't even have to wait.
[58:13] Amen. To put you on trial. He already
[58:15] knows about you before the foundation of
[58:18] the world. So he could actually elect
[58:21] and choose before uh we came. And so uh
[58:25] we find that the lamb, the Bible says
[58:28] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[58:31] of the world. The prophet said he was
[58:33] elected back there to be the lamb to be
[58:36] slain. And notice we were elected to be
[58:40] the one that he was slain for. Amen. So
[58:44] this this uh thought of Christ dying and
[58:48] now he's JUST SITTING HERE WITH A PUPPY
[58:50] dog look and and and just hoping
[58:53] somebody will feel sorry for him. Well,
[58:55] that's that's not the case. He was he
[58:58] was predestinated to be slain and we
[59:01] were the people predestinated to be
[59:04] redeemed. Amen. And and so uh uh this is
[59:08] all there. So so see WHAT WHAT IT'S
[59:11] ABOUT IS GOD CAME TO DELIVER YOU. GOD
[59:14] CAME to deliver me. And uh uh so the
[59:18] prophet said it's the predestinated
[59:21] church I'm talking to, NOT THOSE OUT
[59:23] THERE say no sir. out of every group.
[59:27] He's pulled his predestinated and THAT'S
[59:30] WHAT HE'S COMING for in every age. Now,
[59:34] the rest is just playing church. Amen.
[59:37] They're just playing around with God.
[59:39] But there is a predestinated people.
[59:42] Amen. That is giving their everything TO
[59:45] GOD BECAUSE GOD KNEW THAT THEY WOULD.
[59:48] There's no struggling to be a Christian.
[59:49] Not to the bride. Amen. There's no
[59:51] impersonation of being a Christian, not
[59:53] to the bride. God already knew what was
[59:56] in them. And so so while the bride is
[59:59] coming up and and and THE POWER OF
[1:00:03] TRANSFORMATION is taking a hold, the
[1:00:05] rest are remaining in their same old
[1:00:08] stuper, same old habits, same old ways.
[1:00:11] Amen. Same. And there ain't nothing
[1:00:13] there to to cause them to want to
[1:00:15] repent. There's nothing there to cause
[1:00:17] them to want to come up higher. And
[1:00:20] actually, they get jealous of the bride.
[1:00:22] They get jealous of the church. Amen.
[1:00:24] They they they look and they get angry
[1:00:26] with it because they see someone rising
[1:00:28] up. Amen. And and they want everybody to
[1:00:31] remain down here with them and they just
[1:00:34] don't understand. But see, God already
[1:00:36] knew. Amen. Before the foundation of the
[1:00:39] world. Now, the prophet uh uh you see uh
[1:00:43] uh the same God that predestinated you
[1:00:46] before the foundation of the world, he
[1:00:48] also said, "Now I go to prepare a place
[1:00:51] for you." See, SO HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT
[1:00:54] HIS ELECTION is going to stand. HE KNOWS
[1:00:57] THAT HIS PREDESTINATED WILL, AMEN,
[1:01:00] nothing is going to detour it. Amen. So
[1:01:03] therefore, he says, I go to prepare. Not
[1:01:07] not when you come, Amen. and you die and
[1:01:10] and you've proven yourself. NOT NOT AT
[1:01:12] THE time that you've overcome. AMEN. BUT
[1:01:15] BEFORE YOU COULD EVER HAVE A CHANCE IN
[1:01:17] LIFE, AMEN, to do good or bad, he says,
[1:01:20] "I'll go to prepare a place for you."
[1:01:22] Amen. Before you WENT THROUGH YOUR
[1:01:24] TRIALS, BEFORE YOU WENT through your ups
[1:01:26] and down, before you failed, AND AND ALL
[1:01:29] OF THESE THINGS, he is declared because,
[1:01:31] see, he knows the future. HE'S PREPARING
[1:01:35] FOR THE FUTURE because he's already
[1:01:38] declared it. Can you say amen? He knows.
[1:01:42] He knows where we're going. How many
[1:01:44] believes that he knows? HE KNOWS I WAS
[1:01:46] GOING TO GIVE MY HEART TO HIM. HE KNOWS,
[1:01:48] AMEN. that if if I ever, Amen. He knew
[1:01:52] that if I'd hear THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:01:53] HOUR, I WOULD COME OUT OF BABYLON AND
[1:01:56] AND I WOULD COME OUT OF THESE things and
[1:01:58] give my life to it, to this message. And
[1:02:01] he knew that. AND HE KNOWS THE PLACE I'M
[1:02:04] GOING. SO, HE GOES BEFORE ME AND
[1:02:07] PREPARES IT. Can you say amen?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. See now uh uh we find the devil
[1:02:13] you know wants us to believe that you
[1:02:15] know that that Jesus statement was only
[1:02:17] to his disciples but that's not true.
[1:02:20] Amen. What Jesus said I go to prepare a
[1:02:24] place for you as to every predestinated
[1:02:27] believer that that had their names
[1:02:29] written in the lamb's book of life.
[1:02:32] Amen. See and and and believers are
[1:02:34] those that have their names written in
[1:02:37] the lamb's book of life. Amen. See the
[1:02:40] believer. See, so God secured the
[1:02:42] believer. You're not secured now. You're
[1:02:45] secured back then. He didn't secure you
[1:02:48] at a certain time in your life. YOU WERE
[1:02:51] SECURED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:02:53] WORLD. WHEN HE WROTE YOUR name in THE
[1:02:55] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, AMEN, THAT'S WHEN
[1:02:58] YOU WERE SECURED.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. See, and
[1:03:03] so we we find that the believer is a
[1:03:06] predestinated gene seed of God. HE IS A
[1:03:09] PART of God. Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:03:12] See, so, so what a believer is in their
[1:03:16] natural birth has no relation, Amen. to
[1:03:20] what God predestinated them to be, to
[1:03:23] what they really are. Amen. It it no
[1:03:26] ties. Amen. And I'm so glad for that.
[1:03:29] See, we had to come the way we came. As
[1:03:32] the prophet says, "And who is this
[1:03:34] Melzdc?" We bypassed the word part.
[1:03:37] Amen. And we had to become flesh to be
[1:03:40] tempted and tested and and all of these
[1:03:42] things. And and and and that was through
[1:03:45] our our first birth. And and and we had
[1:03:48] to come that way to know who God is and
[1:03:51] what he is and and to know him in a
[1:03:54] greater way. Amen. Than Adam even did.
[1:03:58] Amen. Before he fell. ADAM HAD
[1:04:00] FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. THAT HE DOES. He
[1:04:03] has no idea had no idea of what God was
[1:04:07] like you have. Amen. So our fellowship
[1:04:10] with God is even in a greater way than
[1:04:14] what Adam's fellowship with with God
[1:04:16] because Adam as he fellowship with God,
[1:04:18] he never knew God as a savior. He never
[1:04:20] knew God as a healer. He never knew God
[1:04:22] as a way maker. He never knew all of
[1:04:24] these things. Amen. But now you and I
[1:04:27] do. Amen. And so our worship goes deeper
[1:04:30] than even their worship BECAUSE WE KNOW
[1:04:33] WHAT GOD DONE FOR US. WE KNOW HOW
[1:04:35] UNWORTHY WE WERE. BUT GOD'S GRACE CAME,
[1:04:39] AMEN. and rescued us. He is my redeemer.
[1:04:43] He is my savior. Amen. And and I trust
[1:04:46] you can say the same thing. Sin required
[1:04:49] a savior. Amen. Sickness required a
[1:04:53] healer. Bondage required a deliverer.
[1:04:57] Amen. And and our origin where we fell
[1:05:00] from required a redeemer. Ain't that
[1:05:04] right? See, and so, Amen. It it
[1:05:07] everything in God's plan, Amen. Sin was
[1:05:11] not meant to destroy the elect of God.
[1:05:15] Amen. Sin, Amen, was not meant, AMEN. TO
[1:05:19] STARE GOD'S WRATH, AMEN, TOWARD THAT
[1:05:22] ELECT. AMEN. If anything, it steered his
[1:05:25] love toward us. Amen. WHEN HE SAW US
[1:05:27] MARRED IN SIN, GOD'S LOVE REACHED DOWN.
[1:05:31] AMEN. And and and picked us up. Aren't
[1:05:34] you glad for that? Amen. See, so we find
[1:05:38] that that God is eternal. And which
[1:05:41] means he has never had a beginning.
[1:05:43] He'll never have an ending. Amen. He's
[1:05:46] the only one. He's the source of eternal
[1:05:48] life. Amen. And so God is savior. He's
[1:05:51] redeemer. He's deliverer. Amen. and and
[1:05:54] he was all of these things, but yet he
[1:05:57] couldn't, as the prophet would tell us,
[1:05:59] he could not be expressed in them
[1:06:01] things. Amen. Without uh the fall of
[1:06:05] man. Can you say amen? So, he wanted to
[1:06:08] express what he was. Amen. He knew what
[1:06:11] he was, BUT HE WANTED TO EXPRESS IT TO
[1:06:14] SOMEBODY. AMEN. And be praised for it.
[1:06:17] The angels praise him, but your praise
[1:06:19] is a lot greater than the angels. Amen.
[1:06:21] There's there's angels all around the
[1:06:23] throne tonight singing holy, holy, holy,
[1:06:26] holy. They've been doing that for eons
[1:06:28] of time. But your praise is EVEN
[1:06:31] DIFFERENT THAN THEIR PRAISE. It's deeper
[1:06:33] praise. IT'S A GREATER PRAISE. IT'S THE
[1:06:36] PRAISE THAT GOD actually wanted. Amen.
[1:06:38] Because you weren't just made to praise
[1:06:41] God. Amen. But God made you with A FREE
[1:06:44] WILL. AMEN. and in your trials AND IN
[1:06:47] YOUR TROUBLES AND IN EVERYTHING THAT
[1:06:49] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, YOU WALK INTO THE
[1:06:51] HOUSE OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO LIFT YOUR
[1:06:53] HANDS and you BEGIN TO WORSHIP HIM. THAT
[1:06:56] MEANS MORE TO GOD THAN THE ANGELS THAT
[1:06:59] ARE all around him worshiping.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; So the fall allowed God to express
[1:07:06] himself in all of his attributes.
[1:07:09] Now we of course we didn't come forth as
[1:07:12] sons of God when we come uh to earth by
[1:07:15] the natural act of our parents. Amen. We
[1:07:18] expressed this sinful nature. Amen. And
[1:07:22] uh uh uh because that which was part of
[1:07:25] God had not yet been expressed. It it
[1:07:29] had not been quickened. Had not been
[1:07:31] received a birth. There there was a gene
[1:07:34] seed laying there. Amen. Yeah. Uh,
[1:07:37] that's why you got to be born again.
[1:07:39] Amen. Because you were born once and had
[1:07:42] a body. Amen. But God takes that same
[1:07:45] SINFUL BODY. AMEN. And causes another
[1:07:49] birth within you. Amen. The same body.
[1:07:52] Amen. But it's a spiritual birth. Amen.
[1:07:56] And so we we find that uh uh uh that
[1:08:00] that which was part of God had not as of
[1:08:04] yet uh be when we were out in the world
[1:08:06] and all that, it had not received a
[1:08:08] birth.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it didn't cause God to lose
[1:08:12] us.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? It didn't
[1:08:15] cause God to to lose us. Yes, we were
[1:08:18] lost. Amen. And uh uh uh due to the fact
[1:08:23] that we couldn't find our way back to
[1:08:25] God, but not so lost. Not so lost that
[1:08:29] God didn't know where we were.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I was lost. Oh yes.
[1:08:34] Amen. But not so lost that God didn't
[1:08:38] even know I was. That God couldn't find
[1:08:41] me. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? YOU SEE, THE
[1:08:43] prophet described it that the Holy
[1:08:45] Spirit, he searches all throughout the
[1:08:47] earth. He'll go down through the dark
[1:08:49] tin alleys, you know, the dark alleys,
[1:08:51] and he'll go through the beer beer
[1:08:53] joints, AND HE'LL GO TO THE HONKY TONKS,
[1:08:55] AND HE'LL GO TO EVERY CHURCH. HE'LL GO
[1:08:58] TO AMEN. EVERYWHERE. UH, AMEN. because
[1:09:00] he knows he's GOT A SEAT SOMEWHERE.
[1:09:03] AMEN. That's right. See, and and he
[1:09:05] knows where to find us. Ain't that
[1:09:07] right? See, and so I know that Satan
[1:09:10] would like for us to believe that we're
[1:09:12] beyond hope. Amen. And and these things.
[1:09:15] And I'll say your your your parents,
[1:09:18] Amen, they might have been evil and
[1:09:20] wicked. Your your family tree uh uh
[1:09:23] might might be so disgraced and and uh
[1:09:27] uh you know, the history might not be so
[1:09:29] great. And you may have even been raised
[1:09:32] in a a religious family. And you know,
[1:09:35] the prophet says a religious man is is
[1:09:37] is the worst sinner there is. Amen. God
[1:09:40] can deal with a a sinner. Amen. just an
[1:09:43] outranking sinner than he can a
[1:09:45] religious person. Amen. One that don't
[1:09:48] uh that feels like they're okay and yet
[1:09:50] they can go out and do all kinds of
[1:09:52] stuff. They they can do sin and hide it
[1:09:54] and and and and come to church and
[1:09:57] rejoice and all that. Amen. But you
[1:09:59] know, if a man ain't got the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:01] he's just a ranked sinner. Amen. But
[1:10:04] see, we could have been Amen. a as that
[1:10:07] in in that condition. Amen. But no
[1:10:10] matter what your background was or what
[1:10:13] you were mixed in, God didn't lose you.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Titus uh second uh Timothy, I
[1:10:24] believe 2:19 says, you know,
[1:10:27] nevertheless, the foundation of God
[1:10:29] standeth sure, having this sealed, the
[1:10:31] Lord knoweth. Everybody say, "The Lord
[1:10:33] knoweth them that are his."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes the Lord knows
[1:10:37] you? Amen. Ask his Remember, there's
[1:10:40] going to be people that come uh uh up
[1:10:42] there that says, "Lord, have we not
[1:10:44] prophesied? Have we not cast out devils
[1:10:46] in thy name? Have we not done this?" And
[1:10:48] he says, "Depart from me, ye workers of
[1:10:50] iniquity. I never knew you." But God
[1:10:52] says here, "The foundation of God stand
[1:10:54] assure. The Lord knoweth them that are
[1:10:58] his." We ain't going to come to him as a
[1:11:01] stranger. We're not living in this life
[1:11:03] as a stranger anymore. Can you say amen?
[1:11:07] So we find Jesus said in John 6:38, he
[1:11:11] says, "For I came down from heaven, not
[1:11:13] to do my own will, but the will of him
[1:11:16] that sent me. And this is the Father's
[1:11:19] will which hath sent me that all which
[1:11:21] he hath given me, I should lose nothing,
[1:11:25] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:11:27] day." Ain't that right? So when Jesus
[1:11:30] says, "I go to prepare a place for you,"
[1:11:34] he's talking to those whom the father
[1:11:37] has given
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; him. Can you say amen? He's talking to
[1:11:42] those. Amen. Where he says, "I've not
[1:11:45] lost a one. I will raise him up again."
[1:11:48] Amen. That's who he's talking to. A
[1:11:50] ain't that right? Amen. Because he knew
[1:11:53] he would not lose a one. That was the
[1:11:55] father's will. that all the father has
[1:11:57] given me, I've not lost a one. Amen. And
[1:12:00] and so he knew he wouldn't lose a one of
[1:12:04] those uh uh names. Amen. Now you
[1:12:09] understand, see that the names that are
[1:12:12] written in the lamb's book of life are
[1:12:14] the ones that cannot be lost.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; It cannot be lost. Amen. Now, the Bible
[1:12:22] mentions a book called the book of life.
[1:12:24] Amen. and and it is also referred to as
[1:12:28] the lamb's book of life. And and and if
[1:12:31] you look at the scriptures, I won't read
[1:12:33] them, but Revelations 13:8, Revelation
[1:12:36] 17:8, Revelations uh 20:12-15,
[1:12:41] you will see that the scriptures mention
[1:12:44] a book, singular, a book. A ain't that
[1:12:48] right? Now the prophet said, see there's
[1:12:50] no basis for the claims that the lamb's
[1:12:54] book of life is not the same as the book
[1:12:57] of life. So the lamb's book of life, the
[1:12:59] book of life are not two separate books,
[1:13:02] but it's one book. Can you say amen?
[1:13:05] Amen. The prophet said the book of life
[1:13:07] might be called the lamb's book of life
[1:13:09] or Christ's book of life or even thy
[1:13:13] book and book of the living. Only names
[1:13:17] are written in this book. Can you say
[1:13:20] amen?
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; So it's one book and this book is a
[1:13:25] record of life. Amen. The lamb's book of
[1:13:28] life. See? Amen. Uh the book of life.
[1:13:31] And and so the prophet said, see life is
[1:13:34] a sacred thing to God and it's recorded
[1:13:38] in a book. You see, our natural life is
[1:13:41] recorded in a book. every deed, every
[1:13:44] lie, every bad thought, EVERYTHING THAT
[1:13:47] WE'VE LOOKED AT secretly openly. Amen.
[1:13:50] You can go in your truck, you can go in
[1:13:52] the closet, you can go in a secret room
[1:13:54] and look at things on your phone that
[1:13:55] YOU SHOULDN'T LOOK AT. AMEN. And God
[1:13:58] knows it. And it's being recorded. Every
[1:14:00] little thought, whether it's a thought
[1:14:02] of bitterness, thought of vengeance,
[1:14:03] thought of hatred, a lustful thought, an
[1:14:06] adulterous thought, whatever, it's all
[1:14:09] being recorded in a book of life. Can
[1:14:12] you say amen? Amen. Now the prophet
[1:14:15] said, "Your name of your first nature
[1:14:17] was born and put in the book in a book
[1:14:20] of life. All your deeds was wrote in it
[1:14:23] too. Everything you've done under that
[1:14:26] nature was put in a book called the book
[1:14:30] of life." Now notice under that nature,
[1:14:33] amen, was put in a book called the book
[1:14:35] of life. Ain't that right? Now there's
[1:14:38] so much confusion when you talk about
[1:14:40] the book of life and the lamb's book of
[1:14:42] life and and and some you know uh uh
[1:14:46] teach that your name can be taken out of
[1:14:48] of the lamb's book of life and and
[1:14:51] others uh you know it's a common belief
[1:14:54] that when you come to the altar you've
[1:14:56] accept God then God is writing your name
[1:14:58] in the lamb's book of life and and and
[1:15:01] he sees this says oh that's nice you
[1:15:03] know and and and so he writes your name
[1:15:05] when you uh uh uh whatever. But see, we
[1:15:09] would be confused as well if it had not
[1:15:12] been that God sent us a prophet with the
[1:15:15] message of the hour to let us know.
[1:15:17] Amen. And to make clear. Now, this book,
[1:15:21] Amen, contains names. Your name, my
[1:15:24] name, the names of every individual that
[1:15:27] has ever lived from Adam all the way
[1:15:30] down. Amen. It contains names. And all
[1:15:34] the names, amen, that are in the book
[1:15:37] were written before the world began.
[1:15:40] Every name in the book. Now the prophet
[1:15:43] says most Bible students have drawn the
[1:15:45] conclusion that when a person is born
[1:15:48] again, then God writes his or her name
[1:15:50] his or her name in uh um uh the lamb's
[1:15:54] book of life. And if for any reason that
[1:15:56] name is removed, then there's a space on
[1:15:59] the record will simply be blank as it
[1:16:02] was before the name was placed there.
[1:16:05] Well, that's a false teaching. The
[1:16:08] prophet said there is not one scripture
[1:16:10] that teaches that God is presently
[1:16:13] compiling a record of names. This was
[1:16:16] all done before the foundation of the
[1:16:19] world.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But in this book that
[1:16:24] we're talking, there is a section.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; In the book, the prophet said, that is
[1:16:30] called the lamb's book of life.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; In the section, there is a uh uh the
[1:16:36] book of life. But then there's a section
[1:16:38] called the lamb's book of life. Amen.
[1:16:41] See, and and the names that are written
[1:16:44] in that section are the ones that God
[1:16:47] predestinated to make his bride. Amen.
[1:16:50] To make up his bride. These are the ones
[1:16:52] that God predestinated. Amen. When he
[1:16:55] had the lamb slain. Amen. That lamb was
[1:16:58] slain for their names written in the
[1:17:01] section of the book.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; See, so if you are elect, then uh uh
[1:17:10] your name isn't written in the book of
[1:17:12] life, but it's written in the section
[1:17:16] that is in the lamb's book of life.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, every man, woman, boy, and
[1:17:22] girl, Amen, whose name is written in the
[1:17:25] book of life, they're going to have to
[1:17:27] stand before the white throne judgment.
[1:17:30] Amen. And and to be judged according to
[1:17:33] his or her life that was lived up on on
[1:17:36] on the earth. They will be judged
[1:17:38] according to their works of what they
[1:17:40] did on earth. Amen. Because the book of
[1:17:44] life is a record of the person's life.
[1:17:48] Can you say amen? It's it's just a
[1:17:50] record of of their natural life. But
[1:17:53] those whose names were written in the
[1:17:56] lamb's book of life, it's not their
[1:17:59] life. It's the lamb's life. Can you say
[1:18:02] amen? Amen. See, and so they're NOT
[1:18:05] GOING TO HAVE TO be judged. He took our
[1:18:09] judgment.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So this is why
[1:18:13] Colossians 3 now he's not Paul when he's
[1:18:16] writing he's not talking to the world
[1:18:19] he's talking to those who have their
[1:18:21] names written in the lamb's book of life
[1:18:24] and he says for you are dead your life
[1:18:27] is HID WITH CHRIST in God
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; when Christ who is our life shall appear
[1:18:36] then shall you also appear with him in
[1:18:40] glory it is true true that we lived a
[1:18:43] sinful life. It is true, amen, that we
[1:18:46] were born sinners and had a a carnal
[1:18:49] nature. It is true that we needed to
[1:18:51] repent. But our names were written in
[1:18:54] the Lamb's book of life. Can you say
[1:18:57] amen? You see, that's the only way we
[1:18:59] can repent. That's the only way we can
[1:19:02] move forward. That's the only way we can
[1:19:04] look to the future is because our names
[1:19:07] were written in the Lamb's book of life.
[1:19:09] So as the prophet said about the woman
[1:19:11] at the well, she had representation.
[1:19:15] THAT'S WHY SHE COULD SAY, "SIR, I KNOW
[1:19:17] WHEN the Messiah cometh, he will do
[1:19:20] these things." Why? Amen. As soon as
[1:19:22] that LIGHT FLASHED ACROSS HER PATH,
[1:19:25] THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN INSIDE THAT
[1:19:27] GRASP IT AND SAID, "YOU ARE THE
[1:19:29] MESSIAH." He had been around and he had
[1:19:31] performed THE SAME SIGN TO the priest.
[1:19:34] But the prophet SAID HE WAS BLACKENED
[1:19:36] OUT. AMEN. because he had no
[1:19:39] representation.
[1:19:40] Amen. Aren't you glad for that? See, our
[1:19:43] names were written. Now, the prophet
[1:19:46] said, "Jesus come to redeem those name,
[1:19:49] those that had their names in the book."
[1:19:53] Another place before the foundation of
[1:19:55] the world, God wrote your name in the
[1:19:58] lamb's book of life by his spoken word
[1:20:02] and sent Christ THE SACRIFICE TO BUY to
[1:20:06] redeem that same group that he had wrote
[1:20:10] their names in the lamb's book of life
[1:20:12] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:20:15] while you were a sinner, see God already
[1:20:17] knew everything about you. God already
[1:20:19] knew what Satan would do and how he
[1:20:21] would trip you up, but you could never
[1:20:24] GET SO LOST. UH YOUR PATH COULDN'T GET
[1:20:27] SO DARK THAT GOD COULD NOT SEE you and
[1:20:30] that he would lose you and don't know
[1:20:32] where to FIND YOU. THAT HE'S already
[1:20:34] made a plan. I'm going to redeem them.
[1:20:38] Oh, aren't you glad for that? And his so
[1:20:40] determined love for us, his plan for us
[1:20:43] is he did not have to wait for us to be
[1:20:46] born to have a lamb slain. The lamb was
[1:20:49] slain before the foundation of the
[1:20:51] world, before there ever was a first
[1:20:54] sin.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Committed.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope this is all right.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; But somewhere
[1:21:03] in in this dimension of time,
[1:21:07] this mortal life, we separated
[1:21:10] from our old life
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; somewhere.
[1:21:15] Yeah. You may have drank. You may have
[1:21:18] uh stole. You may have been the biggest
[1:21:20] liar. You you you may have cheated. You
[1:21:23] may have done all these things. But
[1:21:25] somewhere in this life,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; mortal life, you separated from that
[1:21:31] life.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; NOW, THE PROPHET SAID, "YOU separated
[1:21:34] and and and I would encourage you to go
[1:21:36] listen to the invisible union of the
[1:21:39] bride."
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; You you ought to go listen to that.
[1:21:41] Amen. You separated from your first
[1:21:44] union by spiritual death. Now, Brother
[1:21:47] Brham, he's talking, of course, it looks
[1:21:49] sounds like he's talking about a natural
[1:21:51] woman and a and a natural man. In one
[1:21:53] way he is, but the depth of it IS HE'S
[1:21:56] TALKING ABOUT THE CHURCH and and Christ.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and the world, he said, but
[1:22:01] you separated from your first union by
[1:22:04] spiritual death. Now you are what? born
[1:22:08] again
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; or remarried again. See why your your
[1:22:14] your wife. Amen. That old nature that
[1:22:18] brother Brand would type out as our
[1:22:20] first wife, our first lover. Amen. That
[1:22:23] nature, it died. It It loved the world.
[1:22:26] It craved the world. Oh, you could have
[1:22:28] went to church, but you was like a
[1:22:29] prisoner in church. You just like a zoo,
[1:22:33] you know, JUST YOU'RE WANTING TO GO OUT
[1:22:35] THERE, BUT everybody telling you you
[1:22:36] can't do this and you can't do that and
[1:22:38] you can't do this and about to drive you
[1:22:40] crazy. Amen. But when that nature dies,
[1:22:44] THERE IS A SEPARATION. YOU SEPARATED
[1:22:47] from that by spiritual death. Now you're
[1:22:50] born again or remarried again to the new
[1:22:54] spiritual union of not your natural life
[1:22:57] of the things of the world, but of
[1:22:58] eternal life. Notice that germ that was
[1:23:02] in you at the beginning found you.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Now your old book is gone.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; There's no record of you anymore.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; What you would have been standing at the
[1:23:21] white throne judge, there's no book for
[1:23:23] you.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING FOUND FOR YOU.
[1:23:28] YOU'D BE JUST STANDING UP THERE AND GOD
[1:23:29] SAYS, "OKAY, bring the book." Well,
[1:23:31] there ain't no book.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU BE JUDGED IF THERE'S no
[1:23:35] record?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; So, he says, "See, uh uh your old book
[1:23:42] is gone with your old union. Now, your
[1:23:45] names has been transferred. Now, you
[1:23:49] say, do you mean to tell me that my old
[1:23:51] book God put it in the sea of his
[1:23:53] forgetfulness?" You stand perfectly
[1:23:56] before God now. Your name is now, he
[1:24:00] said, your name is now in the new book,
[1:24:02] not the book of life, but the lamb's
[1:24:03] book of life. Amen. In other words, your
[1:24:06] record now, amen, is is now switched
[1:24:09] over. Your life that you're living is
[1:24:12] now switched over. You was a sinner. And
[1:24:14] Satan could condemn you. Satan could
[1:24:17] ACCUSE YOU BEFORE GOD BY THAT LIFE. BUT
[1:24:20] WHEN GOD PUT IT IN THE SID
[1:24:22] FORGETFULNESS, WHO CAN FIND IT? Even the
[1:24:24] devil can't find it. God can't find it.
[1:24:27] And your LIFE NOW IS BY THE LAMB'S BOOK
[1:24:30] OF LIFE. There's nothing against you.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; It's true. Can you say amen? See what
[1:24:38] the He said. So, see, you stand
[1:24:41] perfectly before God. Your name is now
[1:24:43] in the new book. Not the book of life,
[1:24:45] but the lamb's book of life. What the
[1:24:48] lamb redeemed.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Not the old book of your natural union.
[1:24:53] Amen. But your new book or your new
[1:24:56] bride, see? Hallelujah. Your new life is
[1:24:59] in the lamb's book of life. Your
[1:25:02] marriage certificate. Hallelujah. Where
[1:25:04] your true eternal germ from the
[1:25:07] beginning takes hold.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Now you're not only forgiven, but you're
[1:25:12] justified.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Our sins are divorced from us. Praise
[1:25:21] the Lord.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; That word divorce is separating two
[1:25:24] things that commonly interact and belong
[1:25:28] together.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Your sins belong to you
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; by your natural birth.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; By that first nature, it belonged to you
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; you couldn't you couldn't break from it
[1:25:42] if you had to. Yeah.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; But God through the blood through
[1:25:49] redemption separated you,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; DIVORCED YOUR SINS FROM YOU.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; So what we were in our first birth has
[1:26:02] nothing to do with the gene seed of God.
[1:26:04] And this is why God does not impute
[1:26:07] iniquity to his own. Right.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Psalms 32:2. Blessed is the man unto
[1:26:14] whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Paul picks it up in Romans 4:8. Blessed
[1:26:20] is the man. Now, church, you're blessed.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; If If God does not impute sin to you,
[1:26:26] you're blessed.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; I I don't care how bad you've gotten in
[1:26:33] life. I don't care how discouraged you
[1:26:36] get. You might be a poor as Job's turkey
[1:26:40] and that had to lean against the wall
[1:26:42] just to gobble.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; that's pretty bad.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; But you're blessed.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Because if if if he does not blessed is
[1:26:55] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[1:26:58] sin.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] Now the prophet says, "Now the thing of
[1:27:03] it is you say, "Well, we'll just live
[1:27:05] loose." That shows your name isn't on
[1:27:08] the book.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. That proves that
[1:27:12] you wasn't uh uh when you tried to live
[1:27:16] any kind of life that you want to live.
[1:27:19] See, that shows you haven't got it. If
[1:27:21] you're a real Christian, you'll live the
[1:27:24] real life
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; because the life in Christ is in you and
[1:27:29] you can't do nothing else but live the
[1:27:31] life of Christ.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; See, this isn't a rodeo.
[1:27:35] This isn't parent uh trying to make the
[1:27:38] child or the pastor trying to to to to
[1:27:41] make the the the church and and the the
[1:27:45] the singers and the musicians and the
[1:27:47] officers to conduct themselves in the
[1:27:49] right way.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; It ain't a rodeo.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; THIS IS BETWEEN GOD and and and that
[1:27:56] man, that woman, boy, girl that has
[1:27:58] their names written in the lamb's book
[1:28:01] of life. Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; See, so he says, see, you can't do
[1:28:05] nothing. So Jesus says, see, all that
[1:28:07] the father hath given me will come.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Everybody say, will come.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Now, do we have to pray that for our
[1:28:15] loved ones? You bet. That's all part of
[1:28:17] God's will.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Just as much as as when when God wrote
[1:28:22] your name in the Lamb's Book of Life, he
[1:28:24] had to have send a redeemer to come and
[1:28:27] literally die for us.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; But it was all A PART OF GOD'S PLAN.
[1:28:32] Ain't that right?
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "Those who have
[1:28:35] their name written on the lamb's book of
[1:28:37] life see their name when the seals are
[1:28:40] thrown open there and the Holy Spirit
[1:28:43] speaks to them and they come."
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; They come. Can you say amen?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; This why we're dedicated to preach the
[1:28:52] message of the hour.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in preaching anything
[1:28:55] else.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I I'm only after bride.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. This is why the
[1:29:01] prophet said, "You see, we're pulling
[1:29:03] and sainting, trying to find where those
[1:29:06] people are that have their name or that
[1:29:09] their name was put in the lamb's book of
[1:29:11] life." So, THAT'S WHAT THE PROPHET WAS
[1:29:13] TRYING TO DO. HE THAT'S WHY HE STAYED
[1:29:15] WITH THE MESSAGE. THAT'S why he didn't
[1:29:16] preach a Billy Graham sermon. That's why
[1:29:18] he didn't preach a a a a Charles Wesley
[1:29:21] sermon and uh or whatever. He was after
[1:29:24] those names that were written in the
[1:29:26] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. AND I JUST believe
[1:29:28] that GOD'S CALLED ME TO PREACH THIS
[1:29:30] MESSAGE. AMEN. God knows what is what.
[1:29:33] Everybody is going in into TO WHATEVER
[1:29:36] PLACE THEY ARE. THAT IF GOD HAS GOT A
[1:29:38] NAME STILL ON THIS EARTH, I'M OUT TO
[1:29:41] PREACH A MESSAGE. AMEN. That God, by
[1:29:43] God's grace, we can get it.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And it could be that that name is
[1:29:50] sitting on a church pew
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; that needs God
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; and they don't know it yet. Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Now, so the rest will never come.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; As the prophet, you know, said, "Amen."
[1:30:04] That that you you're you're preaching,
[1:30:06] you're you're casting the net out, and
[1:30:08] you draw a lot of them in, and one by
[1:30:11] one. Amen. The the spiders go back, THE
[1:30:14] CRAWFISH GO BACK, AND this goes back,
[1:30:17] and that goes back. But but but there's
[1:30:19] got TO BE A TROUT SOMEWHERE.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; THERE THERE'S GOT TO BE A keeper
[1:30:23] somewhere.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it ain't it ain't up to us to
[1:30:27] keep them. It's up to God to keep them.
[1:30:29] Can you say amen? Because it's it he
[1:30:31] knows he knows his own.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Now, so the prophet says the same God
[1:30:38] that called your name and wrote it on
[1:30:41] the lamb's book of life before the
[1:30:42] foundation of the world has already made
[1:30:45] a place in uh uh in glory for you.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that? Yes.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And when this earthly tabernacle be
[1:30:54] dissolved, we have one already waiting
[1:30:56] for us in the way he's fashioned. Now,
[1:31:00] so who are the people that have the Holy
[1:31:02] Ghost? Amen. Well, it's those who have
[1:31:05] their names written in the Lamb's Book
[1:31:07] of Life. That's what the Holy Ghost was
[1:31:10] given for is the those names. They're
[1:31:12] the only ones that will have it. Others
[1:31:15] may act like they have it and and but
[1:31:17] it's only to those who have their name
[1:31:20] written in the lamb's book of life. Well
[1:31:22] then what is the Holy Ghost? The Holy
[1:31:25] Ghost is a seal. Everybody say it's a
[1:31:27] seal.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4:30. It says, "And
[1:31:31] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:31:34] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:31:38] redemption." Now notice what a prophet
[1:31:40] said. This is the sealing time.
[1:31:44] This is the sealing time. See? And so
[1:31:47] therefore, the seal of God, Amen, is the
[1:31:51] life of God. Amen. And which is the
[1:31:55] token that God is requiring.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; So close. Remember the Jesus said in
[1:32:02] this last day, it'd be so close that it
[1:32:04] deceive the very ELECT IF IT WAS
[1:32:05] POSSIBLE. BUT THERE'S ONE thing about
[1:32:08] it. THIS ELECT HAS A SEAL. YEAH.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; NOW, the prophet said, "This seal is a
[1:32:16] sign that the seed has been geratized
[1:32:19] with eternal life." Zoe, my own life,
[1:32:23] God's own life. See, and I'll raise it
[1:32:25] up again at the last day. And as you
[1:32:28] walk, as you walk, you're sealed. You
[1:32:32] have confidence that the life of Christ
[1:32:34] is in you and you are in him. by one
[1:32:38] spirit. We're all baptized into one
[1:32:40] body, SEALED THERE BY THE Holy Ghost
[1:32:44] among this believers like this until the
[1:32:47] day that Jesus raises us up.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Now, a seal and and a seal signifies a
[1:32:54] finished product. Amen. So, a seal
[1:32:58] cannot be put on anything that is not
[1:33:02] complete.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so this is why the prophet
[1:33:06] said the Lutheran wasn't sealed. The day
[1:33:08] of the dispensation of grace wasn't
[1:33:10] completed. They preached justification.
[1:33:14] Methodist wasn't sealed because it
[1:33:16] wasn't completed. But the baptism of the
[1:33:19] Holy Spirit is the completion of the
[1:33:22] works of God.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Three works of grace. Can you say amen?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the baptism is is the finished
[1:33:31] product of the works of God is is the
[1:33:35] completion. This why Peter said repent.
[1:33:38] Amen. Every one of you and be baptized
[1:33:41] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:33:44] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:33:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:51] Now he has come himself
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; in the form of son of man.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Revealed sealing his
[1:34:04] elect.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; God's own life.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:34:12] where is this seal being placed?
[1:34:16] We'll look here. Ezekiel 9:3. And the
[1:34:19] glory of the of the God of Israel was
[1:34:22] gone up from the cherub cherub whereupon
[1:34:26] he was to the threshold of the house.
[1:34:27] And he called to the man clothed with
[1:34:30] linen which had the ink writer's inkorn
[1:34:32] by his side. And the Lord said unto him,
[1:34:35] "Go through the midst of the city,
[1:34:38] through the midst of Jerusalem, and set
[1:34:40] a mark upon the foreheads of the men
[1:34:45] that sigh and that cry for all the
[1:34:48] abominations that be done in the midst
[1:34:50] thereof." Now, we know that this
[1:34:53] scripture was fulfilled. Uh this
[1:34:56] happened on on the day of Pentecost.
[1:34:58] Amen. Uh uh but it also as as the
[1:35:03] prophet says that scriptures have a
[1:35:05] double
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; meaning. Amen. And and so like he would
[1:35:09] use the scripture out of Egypt have I
[1:35:11] called my son. Well, he did. He called
[1:35:13] the natural Jacob and and the people
[1:35:16] out, but he also called Christ out. So
[1:35:19] it was fulfilled in two ways. Amen.
[1:35:22] Well, this go through the city h the
[1:35:25] midst of the city and and and and midst
[1:35:28] of Jerusalem set a mark upon the
[1:35:30] foreheads of the men. That was done on
[1:35:33] the day of Pentecost.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; And now it's being again done in this
[1:35:43] gentile dispensation.
[1:35:46] Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Now the seal is being placed upon the
[1:35:52] forehead.
[1:35:54] Now a lot of people think forehead is
[1:35:57] natural. Natural forehead.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. A stamp on the forehead. I was
[1:36:01] listening to some uh uh uh one of the
[1:36:04] commentaries on social media the other
[1:36:06] day and he had a minister and they got
[1:36:08] talking about the end times and all
[1:36:09] these things and he says, "Well, how
[1:36:11] how's that, you know, how's that going
[1:36:12] to happen?" because uh we haven't had a
[1:36:15] stamp yet, you know, and and and and so
[1:36:18] they were talking about the natural
[1:36:20] stamp and being people being stamped.
[1:36:22] But see, the the prophet, Amen, told us
[1:36:26] it's not no tattoo.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; It's not some literal thing. Amen. And
[1:36:31] people think, well, you know, it's them
[1:36:33] putting a bug or one of them chips in
[1:36:36] your hand. That's not it. A lot of
[1:36:37] people are even scared about that.
[1:36:39] That's not that's not the seal. Amen. Uh
[1:36:43] uh but we find amen the prophet said
[1:36:45] foreh forehead is knowledge to
[1:36:49] understand.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Everybody say knowledge
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; to understand.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he puts a seal up on the
[1:36:57] forehead. Knowledge to understand. When
[1:37:01] that seal happens something happens. The
[1:37:04] the light comes on
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and every else everybody else walks
[1:37:09] without understanding and in darkness.
[1:37:12] So, we're sealed, amen, by the knowledge
[1:37:15] of God. See, Brother Brandon said, "Your
[1:37:18] forehead is your revelation."
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; See, your hand is the thing you do about
[1:37:24] it. NOW, PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I GOT THE
[1:37:26] HOLY GHOST." WELL, then you're saying
[1:37:28] that that that revelation has come to
[1:37:30] you. But notice if if there's not a
[1:37:33] doing about it, if you're not doing
[1:37:36] anything about this message, if if
[1:37:38] you're just sitting there living a
[1:37:39] backsliding life, say, "Well, I got the
[1:37:40] HOLY GHOST. BLESS GOD. I BELIEVE THAT
[1:37:42] GOD SENT A PROPHET and there ain't
[1:37:44] nothing about you, Amen, that is causing
[1:37:47] you to walk away from sin, to walk away
[1:37:50] from the hate and the bitterness and and
[1:37:52] and all of the things of the world, then
[1:37:54] the ceiling ain't right.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; So your forehead is your revelation and
[1:38:03] your hand is the thing you do about it.
[1:38:06] It's a spiritual mark. Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; So what did the first seal prophet says
[1:38:11] what did the first seal look like? Amen.
[1:38:13] On the day of Pentecost, he says they
[1:38:16] were filled with the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:38:18] right. Their works was the works of
[1:38:21] Christ.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; They were sealed
[1:38:25] and their works was the works OF CHRIST.
[1:38:28] THEY LAID hands on the sick. They
[1:38:30] recovered. They done all kinds of signs
[1:38:32] and miracles and wonders. See, and in
[1:38:34] their forehead was sealed by the
[1:38:37] revelation THAT HE WAS THE SON OF GOD.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; NOTHING COULD TAKE THAT AWAY from them.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; They were sealed. THE REVELATION WAS
[1:38:48] THERE, sealed in them, and they did the
[1:38:52] works of God.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; See, they were working with him, the
[1:38:56] deity of Christ. There's the mark.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, see, this is why
[1:39:02] people that claim to have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:04] and they're teaching uh uh trinitarian
[1:39:07] baptism, they they don't have the Holy
[1:39:09] Ghost
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; because now we know what the seal is.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; It's the understanding.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Well, well, you know, they say they got
[1:39:16] the Holy Ghost and they don't believe in
[1:39:18] Mal Malachi 4.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; They ain't got no understanding. So, so
[1:39:22] they can't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They're claiming to
[1:39:27] have the Holy Ghost, still ordaining
[1:39:29] women preachers,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; and and they can say, "I love God." They
[1:39:32] can cry and they can boohoo. They can be
[1:39:34] so dedicated and winning souls and all
[1:39:37] that. But the seal of God is in the
[1:39:40] forehead.
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Revelation, understanding.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Now, Ephesians 1:16. Now, remember,
[1:39:54] Amen. God knows who you are.
[1:39:57] When he seals you with the Holy Ghost,
[1:40:00] you're coming to know who you are.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; You're coming to know who he is. You're
[1:40:05] realizing you're not a sinner. Amen. But
[1:40:08] you are a super race.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. See, Ephesians 1:16,
[1:40:15] Paul says, "Cease not to give thanks for
[1:40:17] you, making mention of you in my
[1:40:19] prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus
[1:40:21] Christ, the Father of glory," notice,
[1:40:23] "meto
[1:40:25] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:40:28] the knowledge of him." In other words,
[1:40:31] may he seal you.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Now, notice the sealing. The prophet
[1:40:40] said the ceiling's taken place today.
[1:40:43] John 14:8, I will not leave you
[1:40:45] comfortless. Jesus said, I will come to
[1:40:47] you yet a little while the world seeth
[1:40:50] me no more.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Right. I think another place says and
[1:40:55] neither knoweth him,
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; but you see me.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Because I live, YOU SHALL LIVE.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT THE QUICKENING POWER. NOW YOU
[1:41:05] HAVE THE QUICKENING POWER. And that day,
[1:41:09] prophet said, "This day, not looking for
[1:41:11] a future day, not looking at a day past.
[1:41:14] This day you shall know."
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; THE REVELATION STRIKES YOU THAT I AM IN
[1:41:24] MY FATHER, you in me, and I in you.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; So the seal of God, the prophet said, is
[1:41:32] being made known today.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Everybody that has it, THEIR
[1:41:38] HEARTS ARE FREE. THEY'RE SEALED BY THE
[1:41:40] KNOWLEDGE OF GOD IN THEIR FOREHEAD that
[1:41:43] they do know that Jesus is is dead and
[1:41:47] raised again because they can see him.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; So the world doesn't see him. The world
[1:42:01] doesn't know him. But those that are
[1:42:04] sealed
[1:42:06] with the seal of God, they have an
[1:42:08] understanding of who he is.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; They know he's alive.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice uh uh Revelation 66,
[1:42:23] and I heard a voice in the midst of the
[1:42:24] four beast say, a measure of wheat for a
[1:42:27] penny, and three measures of barley for
[1:42:28] a penny. Notice, see thou hurt not the
[1:42:33] oil and the wine,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Oil represents the Holy Spirit, the
[1:42:39] seal.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Wine represents revelation.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; They go together,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; can't have the seal without the
[1:42:48] revelation.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Can't have the Holy Ghost without
[1:42:51] revelation.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Remember, when he, the
[1:42:57] Spirit of truth, has come, he'll lead
[1:42:59] and guide you into all truth.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; So, those who have the seal of God
[1:43:09] are forbidden
[1:43:12] to be touched.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Satan can't touch them.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Satan can't hurt them.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, he can afflict your body. HE CAN
[1:43:20] AFFLICT YOUR MIND,
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; but he cannot touch that soul. That's
[1:43:24] true.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; He's already said, Jesus already
[1:43:28] promised, "The gates of hell SHALL NOT
[1:43:31] PREVAIL."
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Now, they're not going through the
[1:43:39] tribulation.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Now, a seal also signifies ownership.
[1:43:46] Prophet said God owns his church.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; He owns his people.
[1:43:52] And he shows this by sealing them. So
[1:43:55] now notice, and I'm going
[1:43:57] hurry here, but he says, "The seal of
[1:44:00] God in this last day is a distinction."
[1:44:03] Everybody say distinction.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; A mark that'll be put upon the people.
[1:44:09] The seal of God is a distinction.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; See? Well, distinction is the act of
[1:44:16] perceiving someone or something as being
[1:44:21] not the same and often treating as
[1:44:24] separate or different.
[1:44:26] It's special honor or recognition.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't give you the seal.
[1:44:36] You can't give your own self the seal.
[1:44:37] You can't give me the seal.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; This is God. IT COMES FROM GOD. GOD HAS
[1:44:44] to give the seal.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; When he gives the seal, it shows he's
[1:44:50] recognized you.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to have the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; I I couldn't beg for it. Couldn't plead
[1:45:04] for it. Couldn't live good enough for
[1:45:06] it.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people live better than
[1:45:08] me. There's a lot of people live more
[1:45:11] holier and stricter than I do
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; than what you do.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And and yet it pleased God
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; to give us the seal.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Showing this is mine.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Can't touch him, devil.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; This is mine. Out of the millions that
[1:45:29] are headed TO TRIBULATION,
[1:45:31] THIS ONE ISN'T.
[1:45:37] So remember, God required Abraham and
[1:45:40] his seed to have the seal of
[1:45:41] circumcision.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; See, Abraham had believed God. How did
[1:45:45] he get the faith? God gave him the
[1:45:47] faith.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to struggle with it. God
[1:45:51] gave it to him.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; And then God gave HIM THE SEAL OF
[1:45:55] CIRCUMCISION,
[1:45:56] SHOWING THAT HE RECOGNIZED HIS FAITH.
[1:46:00] GOD RECOGNIZED HIS OWN FAITH in Abraham.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; So, so God required all of Abraham's
[1:46:10] seed to have this seal of circumcision.
[1:46:15] So, the the seal of circumcision was the
[1:46:18] distinction. The prophet said it was to
[1:46:21] separate them from all other people.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; God didn't require any other nation. No
[1:46:26] other nation had this seal of
[1:46:29] circumcision but Abraham's seed all the
[1:46:32] way through the lineage of Abraham's
[1:46:34] seed. THERE WAS A SEAL OF CIRCUMCISION
[1:46:37] AND THAT separated them from the rest.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; So God today seals the believer by
[1:46:46] giving him a a a uh the Holy Ghost. And
[1:46:51] then if he has sealed you, given you the
[1:46:55] Holy Ghost, now now we know we can have
[1:46:58] it on our flesh and that don't mean
[1:46:59] nothing.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; And and under that having it on the
[1:47:04] flesh, there's men that drink, smoke,
[1:47:06] and
[1:47:08] committing adultery and still writing
[1:47:10] just wonderful songs,
[1:47:12] have great anointing, and they'll write
[1:47:14] songs that we sing. I know people say
[1:47:16] you don't need to sing them, but if
[1:47:18] they're anointed and they're of God,
[1:47:20] then then
[1:47:23] you you just ignore their life and take
[1:47:26] what God's put there. You say, "Well, I
[1:47:28] I don't believe that." Well, that's
[1:47:30] that's your business. But we will say
[1:47:33] this, there was the rock. You remember
[1:47:37] the world's got a little trickle of
[1:47:39] water coming out of that rock in the in
[1:47:41] the wilderness. The prophet said it
[1:47:43] wasn't no trickle of water. It was
[1:47:46] gushers of water. It had to feed two and
[1:47:50] a half million PEOPLE PLUS ALL THE
[1:47:52] LIVESTOCK. AND that water not only went
[1:47:55] to Israel, but it actually ran down and
[1:47:58] went to other nations. So the other
[1:48:00] nations lived off of this water. Amen.
[1:48:02] But that water was for Israel.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? SO, SEE, THEY CAN HAVE
[1:48:09] THIS ANOINTING upon their flesh and and
[1:48:12] they can do Christian things and and ALL
[1:48:14] THESE THINGS, BUT the seal is when he
[1:48:17] gives you the Holy Ghost down in that
[1:48:19] soul.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; And when he does that, if he has sealed
[1:48:23] you, then you are a finished work. It's
[1:48:26] over.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; It's over for you. Can you say amen? Not
[1:48:30] that you keep you you you you're not
[1:48:33] it's not that you don't keep working
[1:48:35] doesn't mean that you you don't keep
[1:48:37] pressing but but your days of struggle
[1:48:39] is over. Amen. Your days of wondering if
[1:48:42] you're if you're there, if you're not,
[1:48:44] it's over. It's just something that
[1:48:47] starts to settle down inside of you.
[1:48:49] Brother Brown said, "You who are born
[1:48:51] again, God put your name on the lamb's
[1:48:53] book of life." Amen. Christ died and
[1:48:55] sent the Holy Ghost here to call you to
[1:48:58] eternal life. You have RECEIVED IT. HE
[1:49:00] SEALED YOU. NOW YOU'RE there till the
[1:49:04] day of your redemption. Oh, Satan might
[1:49:06] try to get you to wonder if you're saved
[1:49:08] and he'll try to all this, but there's
[1:49:10] something solid down inside of you. It's
[1:49:11] the revelation. I know who I am. I know
[1:49:14] I'm on my way. I know I am saved. I know
[1:49:17] I'm I'm Well, WHAT IS IT? THE SEAL
[1:49:20] WORKS.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Is this all right? Yes.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; So he says if you're a believer and
[1:49:28] believe on the Lord, he's recognized you
[1:49:31] and he's recognized your faith by giving
[1:49:33] you the seal of his promise, the Holy
[1:49:35] Ghost. Notice, then you have the
[1:49:37] assurance,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; of being with him in glory forever.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Now, he knows you're going to be there.
[1:49:45] Now, he gives us that seal. Now, we know
[1:49:48] we're going to be there.
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost isn't just some
[1:49:53] emotion. That's a sensation that one
[1:49:55] gets.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; It's not a good feeling or a religious
[1:49:58] feeling that comes over a person. It's a
[1:50:00] it's a seal.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm I'm rushing here now. In in
[1:50:05] the early days, a seal was also a
[1:50:07] signature.
[1:50:08] like like in the Romans and and even in
[1:50:11] the Jews and in the older days, there's
[1:50:13] some people that did not know how to
[1:50:15] write their name or or I think even
[1:50:18] maybe kings and royalty would use a seal
[1:50:21] instead of their signature. If they were
[1:50:23] going to write an article or whatever,
[1:50:25] instead of writing their signature like
[1:50:27] we do at the bottom to show that it's
[1:50:29] us, then they would use a seal. Yeah,
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; it would be a ring
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; or it would be, you know, something that
[1:50:37] would be on the back of their wrist or
[1:50:39] or like that. I don't know. But anyway,
[1:50:41] it' be something on their on the wrist
[1:50:43] or a ring, but it would have their seal
[1:50:46] on it instead of their signature. So,
[1:50:49] the seal acted as the name. The seal was
[1:50:52] the name,
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; right? THE SEAL WAS A BONAFIDEED
[1:50:59] statement
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; that it was good as the man's signature.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; So it was a capital fine uh for anyone
[1:51:09] who would try to copy that.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said, "Now listen you
[1:51:14] Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist,
[1:51:16] Presbyterian, Pentecostals, don't try to
[1:51:20] copy it.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; It's a seal."
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:26] Hold still and God will put it on you.
[1:51:30] Then you'll be an inside example of
[1:51:33] Christianity and manhood and womanhood.
[1:51:36] The seal of the HOLY SPIRIT, GOD'S IN
[1:51:38] sign pressed into you till you look,
[1:51:42] act, walk, talk the gospel everywhere
[1:51:46] you go and no finger can be put on you.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; can you say amen? So notice the name,
[1:51:55] this is the prophet speaking it. The
[1:51:57] name of Jesus Christ is the seal.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SEALS YOU, HE PUTS HIS NAME TO
[1:52:07] IT.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Now look, look, let's look at some
[1:52:12] scriptures. Revelation 7:2. And I saw
[1:52:16] another angel ascending from the east,
[1:52:18] having the seal of the living God. And
[1:52:20] he cried with a loud voice to the four
[1:52:22] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[1:52:24] earth and the sea, saying, "Hurt not the
[1:52:26] earth, neither the sea nor the trees
[1:52:29] till we have sealed the servants of our
[1:52:33] God in their foreheads." Of course,
[1:52:36] these servants are the Jews, right? The
[1:52:38] the 144,000.
[1:52:41] If you read on the fourth verse, I think
[1:52:43] and fifth. Amen. Uh uh John heard the
[1:52:46] number of them that were sealed and it
[1:52:48] equaled up to 144,000.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that the prophet said they are
[1:52:53] sealed WITH THE SAME SEAL THAT YOU AND I
[1:52:57] AS THE GENTILES ARE SEALED WITH.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Now notice they're sealed in their
[1:53:04] forehead. Revelations 14:1. And I looked
[1:53:07] and lo, a lamb stood on the mount Zion
[1:53:12] with him and 144,000
[1:53:15] having his father's name
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; written in their foreheads.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. Yes.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Revelations 22:4. And they shall see his
[1:53:30] face and his name.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; His seal
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; shall be in their foreheads.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And his name is
[1:53:43] called the word of God."
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; The revelation.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:54] So now notice the prophet said he Jesus
[1:53:57] Christ his name is called the word of
[1:54:00] God. He Jesus Christ was the word made
[1:54:02] flesh when he dwelt upon the earth. Can
[1:54:05] you say amen?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Now his name is upon our forehead.
[1:54:10] Meaning the word is now made flesh
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; in his church
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; dwelling among us.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:21] One place, Brother Bram said, the word
[1:54:23] of God, his name was the word of God.
[1:54:26] The word made manifest.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; So, not just coming in church and
[1:54:31] learning something like a a school or a
[1:54:34] seminary and we're getting educated,
[1:54:36] intellectual learning. That ain't it.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; It ain't even about coming in here and
[1:54:40] listening to the message and ALL THAT.
[1:54:42] THAT'S FINE. BUT NOW, we come AND WE GO
[1:54:45] OUT THEM DOORS AND WE BEGAN to live the
[1:54:47] message. The word becomes manifest.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; It's his signature.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; His word.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "If you abide in me and
[1:55:02] my words abide in you," what is that?
[1:55:03] The prophet said, "It's God made flesh
[1:55:05] again.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; You ask what you will and it shall be
[1:55:09] done for you." Can you say amen?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; So what is it? It's the Holy Ghost
[1:55:13] coming in the person and quickening the
[1:55:16] word of God to him.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Prophet says when he goes to the Jews,
[1:55:23] when God goes to the Jews and and he
[1:55:26] seals them, that's when they'll be
[1:55:28] sealed, right after the rapture.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; He says the spirit of Elijah off of this
[1:55:34] gentile church will just continue right
[1:55:37] on into that Jewish church. go right on
[1:55:40] in and call Moses with him. Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] You see it? He'll preach the same
[1:55:46] message of Pentecost to those Jews.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; He'll preach the same message you're
[1:55:51] hearing.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; That message that you're playing on the
[1:55:54] tapes and you're listening to the seals
[1:55:57] don't have to be open for them. It's
[1:55:58] already open unto us.
[1:56:02] THEY'LL RECEIVE the message that you're
[1:56:04] receiving
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; and THEY'LL BE SEALED BY IT.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Under that, they'll recognize their
[1:56:14] Messiah.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; They'll recognize their true atonement.
[1:56:18] Can you say amen?
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that there's another group
[1:56:23] of people who are receiving the mark of
[1:56:25] the beast. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Revelations 13:11, I beheld another
[1:56:30] beast coming out out of the earth, and
[1:56:32] he had two horns like a lamb, and he
[1:56:35] spake as a dragon. 16th verse, and he
[1:56:38] caus all, both small and great, rich and
[1:56:40] poor, free and bond. See, to receive a
[1:56:43] mark in their right hand, or in their
[1:56:45] foreheads, and that no man might buy or
[1:56:48] sell, save he that had the mark, or the
[1:56:51] name of the beast, or the number of his
[1:56:53] name. See, and so if the musicians, they
[1:56:56] can come on up. But the Bible says that
[1:56:59] in the beginning, God set a mark upon
[1:57:02] Cain.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; After and we know what Cain who Cain
[1:57:05] was. He was a the son of Satan.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; He was of that serpent seed. The Bible
[1:57:12] says Satan, the serpent, had a seed.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Cain was that seed.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And God set a mark upon him that no man
[1:57:22] would kill him if they found him. Now
[1:57:25] God separated Cain BY PUTTING A MARK on
[1:57:29] him
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; and then sent him out from the presence
[1:57:34] of the Lord. And the prophet said that
[1:57:38] is what the mark of the beast is.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; A man cannot come back into the presence
[1:57:44] of God once that mark is upon him.
[1:57:49] And he says, "The mark of the beast is
[1:57:51] the wayward, the outcast that refused to
[1:57:55] take and come God's provided way."
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Cain, as soon as he was marked, was sent
[1:58:02] away. Can sit in church, never feel the
[1:58:05] presence of God again, never be
[1:58:07] convicted again. Never. Never. This is
[1:58:09] why you can't play around with God. You
[1:58:11] can't not play around with things. You
[1:58:14] either get right or you just it it'd be
[1:58:16] better you just go out and live a sinful
[1:58:18] life. Live a sinner's life instead of
[1:58:20] trying to bring it into the church and
[1:58:22] and and and live in in a lukewarm state.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; So it it this is why the prophet would
[1:58:30] say well the prophet said it's now come
[1:58:32] I think in the identified Christ of all
[1:58:34] ages. He come to the point he said now
[1:58:37] there's only one thing left and he told
[1:58:39] the people there's only one thing left
[1:58:41] that can happen. He was talking about
[1:58:42] the revealing of the son of man. He said
[1:58:45] and that is for the people to be mar or
[1:58:47] receive the seal of god or to be marked
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; with the mark of the beast. That's
[1:58:53] what's happening in this age.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; So he says this is the age of the
[1:58:58] turning time. It's a time when men are
[1:59:01] either will either come into the kingdom
[1:59:04] of god and be or be sealed out of the
[1:59:08] kingdom of god.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; No no no in between. No playing, no
[1:59:13] playing church. It's either we're we're
[1:59:16] coming in to be sealed in
[1:59:20] or we'll be sealed out.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Also, the mark showed that God had
[1:59:28] something against Cain.
[1:59:31] Rebraham said, "You never heard someone
[1:59:33] say, "Well, you got one seal against
[1:59:35] you."
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's always you got one mark
[1:59:40] against you." Yeah,
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; you got you got you got a mark against
[1:59:44] you.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And where's that mark being placed? The
[1:59:48] right hand,
[1:59:50] the forehead. Speaking of knowledge or
[1:59:54] deed,
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; receiving the doctrines
[1:59:58] and putting it into action.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:00:04] Amen.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; When John saw the great he saw
[2:00:10] that she had a mark upon her forehead.
[2:00:12] Brother Brandham identified it as the
[2:00:14] Catholic Church. There was a mark upon
[2:00:16] her forehead.
[2:00:18] Revelation 17:5, "And upon her forehead
[2:00:21] was a name written, Mystery Babylon the
[2:00:23] Great, the mother of harlots and
[2:00:26] abominations of the earth." Can you say
[2:00:28] amen?
[2:00:30] See, so then once a man receives the
[2:00:34] Holy Ghost, he can not be lost. It's an
[2:00:40] assurance.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Proble said God wouldn't give a man the
[2:00:44] Holy Spirit if he knew he was going to
[2:00:46] lose him.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, Judas, Amen.
[2:00:51] THAT'S WHERE HE STOPPED AT. He He He He
[2:00:55] cast out devils. He worked all kinds of
[2:00:57] miracles. He had an office in the
[2:00:59] church. He was set under Jesus's
[2:01:01] ministry. HE PARTTOOK OF IT ALL, BUT HE
[2:01:04] STOPPED SHORT of receiving the Holy
[2:01:06] Ghost getting sealed.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; And at the end, he was lost. The prophet
[2:01:11] said he came in as a believer being a
[2:01:13] devil from the beginning. He was born
[2:01:15] the son of predition. He pulled nothing
[2:01:16] over on Jesus because he knowed him from
[2:01:19] the very beginning for he was the word.
[2:01:21] Can you say amen?
[2:01:23] SO THEN HE GIVES THE HOLY GHOST TO those
[2:01:26] who he has gone on to prepare a place.
[2:01:29] Can you say amen?
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said the Holy Spirit
[2:01:33] here itself is a seal.
[2:01:36] Seal signifies finished work. The Holy
[2:01:39] Spirit being a seal to the individual
[2:01:41] and to that individual. When he receives
[2:01:44] the Holy Spirit, then his time of
[2:01:48] groaning is over because it's a finished
[2:01:51] work. Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about it. Then you
[2:01:55] can rejoice in your trial. You can
[2:01:56] rejoice when you fall. You can rejoice.
[2:01:59] Get back up and press the battle. Can
[2:02:02] you say amen? Oh, do you love him?
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What song?
[2:02:12] [Music]
[2:02:15] Oh, I want to thank
[2:02:19] you, Lord.
[2:02:24] [Music]

[2:03:24] Blessed are your eyes for they see.
[2:03:26] Blessed are your ears for they hear.

[2:04:30] Let the death angel pass
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:36] God's bride safe at last.
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:43] It's the token he gave
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:49] that we might be saved.
[2:04:53] [Music]
[2:04:56] Oh, hallelu.
[2:05:03] Glory to God.
[2:05:08] The blood's been applied. His spirit now
[2:05:13] abides. Let the death angel pass.
[2:05:18] Sing that again. Oh, let the death angel
[2:05:23] pass.
[2:05:25] Glory to God.
[2:05:27] The bride's safe at last.

[2:05:52] glory to God.
[2:05:58] The blood's been applied.
[2:06:02] Spirit abides. Let the death angel pass.
[2:06:11] What is that verse? The Lord talked to
[2:06:14] Moses,
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:16] told him what to say
[2:06:23] to the children of Israel
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:29] in Goan that day.
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:35] Oh, slay the lamb.
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:44] Amen. Amen.
[2:06:47] For I'll pass through Egypt this night
[2:06:52] and smite all the firstborn.
[2:06:57] But we say, "Let the death angel pass.
[2:07:02] No fear, no worry.
[2:07:04] By God's grace, I'm safe at last.
[2:07:10] I've got the token he gave.
[2:07:16] Oh, that I might be saved.
[2:07:22] And oh hallelu,
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:29] glory to God.
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:34] The blood's been applied. His spirit
[2:07:39] abides.
[2:07:40] Let the death angel pass. Second verse.
[2:07:46] Thou the sweet Holy Spirit
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:52] is the token, the seal today.
[2:07:56] [Music]
[2:07:58] and all that are under it,
[2:08:04] God said would be saved.
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:10] Anything outside of this token,
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:16] the lost will be found.
[2:08:20] [Music]
[2:08:22] If you want your loved ones saved, you
[2:08:27] better get them in now.
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:32] Oh, let the death angel pass.
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:38] God's bride safe at last.
[2:08:44] She's got the token he gave
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:50] that she might be saved.
[2:08:57] Oh, hallelu.
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:03] Glory to God.
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:08] The brine blood's been applied. Your
[2:09:11] spirit abides, let the death angel pass.
[2:09:18] Now, as they just place softly, when God
[2:09:22] seals a person,
[2:09:24] then that person should never look back
[2:09:27] in the past, they should look to the
[2:09:30] future.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. If if God
[2:09:35] had such a revelation, a knowledge of us
[2:09:38] being there
[2:09:40] that that even before we come to earth,
[2:09:44] he makes this promise. I go to prepare a
[2:09:46] place for you. He's looking in the
[2:09:48] future. He's not looking at our
[2:09:50] mistakes. He's not looking at the earth,
[2:09:52] our natural birth. He's not looking at
[2:09:53] our our life or anything. He's looking
[2:09:56] at that predestinated seed. And he said,
[2:09:58] "Now I'm going to go prepare a place for
[2:10:00] you." Now that seal has been upon our
[2:10:03] forehead. The revelation has come. Let's
[2:10:07] look to the future.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going. He's got a place prepared for
[2:10:12] me. This is why Paul would say, "As as
[2:10:15] soon as this earthly body is is
[2:10:18] dissolved, we've got a place waiting.
[2:10:20] We've got another one that's waiting for
[2:10:22] us." Can you say amen? That's how
[2:10:24] assured we are. God bless you. love you.
[2:10:28] Thank you for your patience and
[2:10:30] listening. Amen.
[2:10:33] You know, Brother Brandham, I'm going to
[2:10:34] read this quote. Brother Brandham said,
[2:10:37] "If you're looking here at what's going
[2:10:39] on now, you'll certainly run off the
[2:10:42] board.
[2:10:44] But if you just keep your eye on the end
[2:10:46] and hold steady and just keep watching
[2:10:48] the end, you won't get so nervous. Oh,
[2:10:51] how's this going to be and how's that
[2:10:53] going to be?" Just keep it to the end.
[2:10:55] everything else will work out. Can you
[2:10:57] say amen? God bless you. Amen. We'll be
[2:11:01] praying for you and uh uh ask that you'd
[2:11:04] pray for for me and the other brothers
[2:11:07] that'll be ministering. Amen. And u we
[2:11:10] can be a blessing and uh to the people
[2:11:13] there in South Carolina. and love you
[2:11:18] and uh brother Daniel and brother Judah
[2:11:20] be heading to Arkansas uh think Saturday
[2:11:23] or Missouri uh Saturday and so ask that
[2:11:27] you'd keep them in prayer as well. God
[2:11:32] will keep them safe and bring them home
[2:11:34] safely.
[2:11:35] Amen. And so u may y'all have a
[2:11:39] wonderful evening. Let's bow our heads
[2:11:41] in prayer. Amen. Um, brother Bill, do
[2:11:45] you want to dismiss us in prayer?
[2:11:48] [Music]
