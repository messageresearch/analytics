[Music] Well, do you believe that by his word? It's the only way we will overcome. Amen. Is is by the word of the Lord. And um I'm so glad that we have have the word as our our refuge. We're not just here gaining knowledge, something that makes us smarter than maybe someone else down the street about the Bible, but God is equipping us to overcome. Amen. That's what it's all about. It ain't it ain't making us a genius in the word. It's just it's just giving us the authority and giving us the ability to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so glad for that. Uh the musicians can be dismissed and it is uh certainly good to be in the house of the Lord and to see everyone. Amen. Good to have our visitor. God bless you. And um uh we're just thankful to be in the army of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a soldier. &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be a soldier? &gt;&gt; We could just be laying down and just letting the devil just run all over us, but I'm I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord. And um uh if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn first of all to the book of Matthew, the ninth chapter. And um I want to just say thank you for praying uh for Sister Martha and um as well as Sister Crystal and both having some complications and um I think they've discovered it's a virus that Sister Crystal has, but she's very weak and so uh but she is home and so um we want to uh just keep her in our prayer. And um u sister Martha is in the hospital and u they're going to um they did a biopsy today and u just trying to figure out what to do next and uh they've got a a team of a team of doctors together and um uh I asked the doctor, you know, is something that they're going to be operating and she said that will be the the least thing at this point. Uh they want to uh go in and and try to get the mass smaller as much as they can. And so um so you know uh but they've done the biopsy so she'll get the results within two I think three days something like that. Uh but the uh uh this mass has intertwined itself around her colon I believe it is and u and around her intestines some of her intestines and so she's been in just a lot of pain and um and so just just for them to touch her uh really hurts and so we want to keep her in prayer. They've kept her under morphine all day today and she has just felt so she said this makes me feel horrible, you know, and just kind of buzzed a little bit and um and so but the the vomiting has stopped. They've given her some medication for that. Uh they more than likely if she is they see her improving, they're going to let her go tomorrow uh with some uh medication to keep the nausea down as well as the pain. And so we're we're thankful, you know, for that. Uh she was very dehydrated. Um uh when I was well I was there most of the day today and they were giving her all day uh fluids just pouring fluids in her and so she she must have been pretty pretty bad dehydrated but she is feeling better uh just really tired and uh can't sleep right now. And so we want to just pray that God will help her get some rest and u and just uh be with them, her and brother Tim and but they really appreciate uh your your prayers, your thoughts and Amen. And so and I know sister Crystal does as well. You know, Satan is fighting, but that's okay. We're fighters. &gt;&gt; Amen. He picked the wrong people. &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not sitting here and uh falling apart, but uh we're just looking at that devil and just thinking, why would you even pick on us? You know, we're going to get you. And so, uh we love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Matthew the 9th chapter and uh the 18th verse. We're going to start there. So while he spake these things uh unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter is even now dead. But come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live." And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples. And behold, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the hymn of his garment. For she said within herself, "If I may but touch his garment, I shall behold." But Jesus turned him about. And when he saw her, he said, "Daughter, be of good comfort. Thy faith, everybody say, "Thy faith hath made thee whole." And the woman was made whole from that hour. Amen. If you'll turn also Mark uh the 11th chapter, we're very familiar with these scriptures, but uh but these are our scriptures. Amen. And we're going to break in the story here. But uh the 22nd, Mark 11:22, and Jesus answering sith unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe, that those things which he saith, shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore, I say unto you, what things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, what would we do if we didn't have your word to stand upon? For you have declared that heaven and earth will pass away, but your word will never pass away. And father, we don't want to stand on things that are just temporal. We don't want to build our hope and our our faith and our life around the temporal things. But may Lord, we we build it upon your word, eternal things. Father, for if we build it upon that, then we too shall last. We too shall endure. Oh God, we're so thankful that you have given us your word in this hour. And I pray, Father, that as we administer this evening, that you would not only anoint myself, but anoint the people, anoint my lips to speak, Father, and anoint the people's hearts to receive. Father, I just uh ask that you would have your way and and in this service and we commit it into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can have your seats this evening. Amen. Maybe if you could turn these up just a little bit. Um so um I I want to uh my title I guess would be receiving the word and acting upon it. And um I I have talked about the gentile woman uh who came to Jesus and uh when she got to him, the Lord insulted her by calling her a dog, which that's what the Gentiles basically were considered to be, just the lowest of loaves. They were heathens. But here is another woman that um had a need and and she had this issue of blood um for uh 12 years and u the Bible says in another place that she had suffered many things from uh of many muh physicians. She had spent all that she had and the prophet would tell us that she was a farmer's wife. and that she uh helped her husband and and just wasn't really wealthy, but um and so but but she she needed something because uh she needed help, but the doctors couldn't help her and uh so she'd spent all of her money and the Bible says she just continued to get worse and worse and worse. So, no doubt that she was getting really weak and and um uh the doctors just didn't know what to do for her and they were maybe perplexed at the situation and I I have no doubt that you know and and this is just my thinking but is that she probably began to worry Satan probably putting worry in her mind about the future and you what are you going to do? Uh you're just going to waste away. um you know um eventually you're going to die and da da da and you know that's that's just the way of humanity uh to where worry sets in um when things um aren't getting better and um um and then you know certain certain demons and I call it demons we disease demons they they have this reputation that follows them and uh and they tend when they strike they tend to build fear in in people and um uh but that is the way of humanity uh is to worry. But I I want to make it really clear because the prophet did so &gt;&gt; and he said worry has no value in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, a prophet when he came, you know, I I thank the Lord for the the the the great mysteries that have been opened up to us. And I I you know, you you thank the Lord for the the seals being opened and and they all play a key. They all they have an important part for us going in the rapture and things like that. But I also thank God for sending a prophet to change to change our attitude about things, &gt;&gt; to change our outlook about things that you may not understand the depths of the word, but one thing we must understand is the simple things of of life that we must put to practice. And that is worry does not have value in it. And and so so God would send a prophet to tell us, "Don't worry. Don't worry. It's the natural thing to do, but don't worry." &gt;&gt; Then then that means we must fight worry. We must fight against it and look to the promise of God. Now, if we didn't have the word of God, I just don't think that a prophet would labor on such thing as worry. But we do have the word of God. And so worry worrying isn't going to help you. He says it isn't going to make you feel better. It isn't going to change the situation. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Now again, it's typical to worry. We worry about our children. Parents worry. If you if you are a godly parent and you love the Lord and you love your children, you worry about your children. You worry about who they're going to marry. You worry about, you know, what direction they're going to take in life. You worry about, you know, uh um you know, when they're when they're having financial struggles, you worry about that. Uh uh when they're maybe if they're sick, you worry about that. You know, you you worry about things. Even the grandchildren, you worry about them. You know, well, how they're going to grow up in this evil age. uh uh you know and and you uh you know for me I'm just thinking about these things uh you know as as they're watching them grow up you know they're going to have to go to school and the the things are changing in this so it's easy to worry about those things it worrying is something that uh uh and and you know it's but when when we're thinking of these things it isn't going to change the situation I can't change the situation by worrying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can call my children up and say, "Hey, I'm worrying about you." Amen. But that ain't going to help them. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to help any of their situation. It ain't going to help my situation. You You understand what I'm saying? I can worry about you all as a church, but that ain't going to help. Y'all can worry about one another, you know, but that ain't going to help. Ain't that right? So So worrying isn't going to get you feeling better. It isn't going to change the situation. So, we would be better off, everybody say, I would be better off &gt;&gt; to believe God's word &gt;&gt; than to worry and to fret over things. Can you say amen? Now, we know that doctors, they can prescribe medicine and and uh they they they do a a good job in that, but they cannot heal. Ain't that right? They can they they what I call practicing physicians. That's that's all they are. They're just practicing men and women who practice medicine. So, it's best not to put all our faith in in medicine. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And and and I know in this age that's not really popular to say. Uh because then people think, well, you're against doctors. Well, we're not against doctors. I I I thank God for what they do, but I don't We're not to put all of our, as they say, put your eggs all in one basket. You're not to put all your faith upon doctors because doctors are limited in what they can do. A &gt;&gt; ain't that right. And if they're a good doctor, they'll tell you that. So then then we find uh um uh that the prophet tells us that doctors now they can only work by what they feel and what they see. Ain't that right? And and so uh uh a doctor, he has certain instruments that help him seize things. They got these CT scans. They've got um you know uh well they got all kinds of things these days. They'll they'll make you take a drink and you know some liquid and then they you know uh take you through something and then they can see all your veins and everything. They got X-rays. They got all that and then they they they start feeling around. They want to check things and because that's all they can work with is what they see and what they feel. Amen. See. And so, uh, doctors can cut things out of our body, uh, you know, with with their surgical knife and all these things, but they can't they can't really find they can't find that demon that's laying there. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And it uh you know I was uh thinking of uh listening to the prayer lines uh the other day and and uh uh you know and I'm sure you you've went and listened to them but you'll hear brother Brandham tell a person well you know you've got this situation and he said you probably didn't know that. He said the doctors uh it's this demon has been hid from the doctors. See, because the doctors, you know, they they can only work in a certain they're limited in how they can work. But a a demon Amen. And we're I'm we're thankful for a prophet that goes beyond the medical uh the medical name and he just calls it for what it is. It's a life. It's a demon. It's it's a tormentor. It's something that is to try to destroy you and to take your life. And so doctors a lot of times can't find that. Amen. that demon. And sometime we get disappointed in doctors. Well, why didn't they try this or why didn't they see that? Why didn't they do this? Well, it's a demon and it lays there. It it just it lays there. But see, uh uh so doctors are limited in what they can do. We thank them for their service. But the church, the church has a greater position than doctors. And you don't have to go to college to learn uh uh uh to be a part of the church. You you don't have to have a degree uh to do what the church is called to do. Ain't that right? But Jesus gave the church a commission. Mark 16:15, he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." How easy is that, right? Amen. Just believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they shall be saved. We have seen the worst drunks, the worst alcoholics. Amen. And just preach to them and somehow they're able to believe it and be able to put away the the the drugs, the whiskey. Their lives have been changed simply. They we've been able to do what doctors can't do. We've been able to do what professionals can't do is because we've been given the greatest thing and that is to preach the gospel. And if that person can just believe the gospel, it doesn't matter where they're at. It doesn't matter what hell they've been through. It doesn't matter what kind of scars they carry. Amen. The gospel can deliver them, set them free, heal them, save them, answer the prayer just by believing the gospel. Can you say amen? So, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. I've I've told you before, you know, uh there was a a man uh in Kenwood, Oklahoma, uh Cherokee. He was a tall guy, but he was just a brute. and everybody around was scared of him. He was an alcoholic and he he he was terror uh in that community and uh uh he had a little boy I don't know of maybe six seven I I don't know where uh I he must have not been married he was just by himself and but he had his boy and they were just um you know dirty uh no no running water no it's just filthy you know and and Um he had old just scraggly little beard. What he had hardly no teeth and his nose had been flat and broken and uh uh just just a mess. But everybody was scared of him. Oh, Mitchell. And so Wendell uh uh we were young. Uh Wendell, I don't know, he probably was 18, so that would have left me at 14. Um something like that. But, uh, Wendell said, "Uh, Sean, you want to go with me to witness to Mitchell?" And I'm, "Yeah, I'll go." you know. So, so we went and and uh we arrived at this shack and um you know, it was just boarded up a little place and and trash all in the yard and grass all high and weeds and you know and so uh uh we went and we knocked on the door and uh uh no one answered at that point. So we knocked again and we heard this. Well, who is it? You know, just real Bruss. And he didn't open the door. So, so you know, Wendle's like, "Well, uh, Mitchell, this is u, uh, I'm I'm Wendle and this is my brother Sean. We're talking to a door. You know, this is my brother Sean. You know, what do you want?" Well, we we wanted to come and just talk to you about the Lord. You know, get out of here, you know. So, we did. We left and and uh went home to our safe haven and thankful to be alive and um but a few days later we felt to go back and so we did and same story. Get out of here, you know, but we didn't. And and uh we said, you know, we're not leaving until we're able to talk with you. We got something you want you you need. And finally, after a little bit, he says, come in. And so when we come in, it was just stunk, trash everywhere. His floor was all crooked. You know, he must have built it when he was drunk. And um uh it was a mess. But as we began to talk to him about the Lord, you see the tears begin to trickle down his face. &gt;&gt; And we led that man to the Lord that day and that man was forever changed. God just so touched him and he'd just go around the the community toothless, you know, but he just had a smile on his face, you know, and everybody just couldn't understand what happened. Well, it was the gospel that was preached &gt;&gt; and he believed it. &gt;&gt; He just simply believed it. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So Jesus gives this commission. Go to go into all the world, preach the gospel, and he that believeth shall and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. Everybody say, "These signs shall follow them that believe." Now, we're not wondering what the gospel is. We've got something to preach. Ain't that right? We We've got something to say. We We've got the word of God. And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick. and they shall recover. Ain't that right? So God didn't command the church to pass out medication and and essential oils and you know and and recipes for this and that and you'll get better and foot massages and you know maybe that corn will fall off your toe and and and all these things. And we're not against any of these things. But that's not what Jesus had had commissioned you and I to do. He didn't commission the church to to build hospitals and and and and all of these things. Uh uh he didn't teach us or command us commission us to go out and to learn how to operate on people and and and all of these things. That is not our specialty as the church of the living God. Amen. Our job is to preach the gospel, lay hands on the sick, cast out the devils. Our job is to see people delivered and set free. And I believe that is still in our commission today. Do you believe that? And so this woman, now this woman didn't know Jesus and had never seen him before. Amen. Uh but she had heard of him and and she had heard of the miracles that he had done and had been performing and and these things. And and the prophet said something just burned within her heart and and she believed it. She just believed it, church. Now she just heard of what he was doing. Didn't understand who he was. Didn't need to understand who he was. She just believed what was happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and faith come alive. And of course, you know, the Bible says that that faith cometh by hearing. I don't know these monitors are going down or something but uh faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. And so she knew that if he was healing others then he could heal her too. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; She knew that. We talked about it, I believe, last Wednesday, that that uh uh that faith, amen, come alive in that woman uh uh uh that had that daughter that was uh uh uh possessed of a devil. And and but she had heard what God was doing. And and and the prophet said she knew that if if they could get it, they could get their healing, she could get what she needed. And so this same woman, see, I believe it's just the same type of faith. Anytime a person has faith, amen, they'll look at the other stories and say, "Well, if God did it for them, he'll do it for me, too." Amen. They don't look at it as, "Well, that's just God of history. That's just been too far. We're living in another day." No. If God can roll back the Red Sea, then he can roll back my Red Sea. If he can deliver and shut the mouths of the lions, he can still do it today. Can you say amen? If he can bring people out of a fiery furnace, he can still bring me out. That's what faith is. Faith is is alive and dwell. Can you say amen? So, so faith comes by hearing. See, then it becomes a personal faith. Amen. It's not just, well, I'm glad God does it for them and I'm glad what he's doing. But now it becomes a personal faith. Amen. I believe he can do it for me. I know he can do it for me. Can you say amen? So, so it was a personal faith. And the prophet said when she saw him, there came an understanding right then that he was the Messiah. She recognized that the God of heaven was now living on earth in a body of a man. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, she said within herself and we talked about saying the right thing. You know, I think she said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; She said within herself, I can just touch him. &gt;&gt; If I can just touch the hym of his garment, I don't have to have an audience with him. I don't have to have an appointment to where he sits down and he looks at me in the eye &gt;&gt; and addresses me by my name. &gt;&gt; If I can just touch him, &gt;&gt; I know I shall be made whole. &gt;&gt; It don't have to be anything special. &gt;&gt; I don't have to have anything special from him. Amen. And to where he recognizes me, but if I can just touch him. Now, she wasn't just wondering if she could be made whole. Well, I'll just go touch him and just see what happens. No, in her heart, she knew that the situation would be taken care of. Can you say amen? She knew within her heart. See? And so, the prophet said she knew that the God of miracles was in that man. Ain't that right? Now, the prophet says that wherever God is, the supernatural takes place. And when you recognize that God is here, when you recognize that God is among us, then you automatically know that the supernatural is going to take place. &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against me is going to prosper. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. See, now Jesus was there to do the miracle. &gt;&gt; He was anointed to do it. &gt;&gt; He read the scripture there in Isaiah. But here in Luke 4:18, he quotes Isaiah. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Ain't that right? See, so he was there to heal the lepers. He was there to heal the blinded eyes. He was there to cause the lame to walk. He was He made himself accessible. He made himself available. And the God that was in him had the power to raise the dead. Have the power to turn water into wine. Have the power to do whatever man would believe him to do. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He's still God. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; He's still God. For he says, "I am that I am." Not that I was, but that he's presenting God today. And the prophet said, "I want you to listen now. It ain't just a quote. It's a promise to you. &gt;&gt; He is always here to heal those who believe." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Say that with me. He is always &gt;&gt; always &gt;&gt; here &gt;&gt; to heal those who believe. &gt;&gt; Always. Not sometimes, not part of the time, not maybe. He is always here. &gt;&gt; He is always here to heal anyone who would just believe. &gt;&gt; Now he says, "But only those who believe are the only ones that's going to be healed." Regardless, &gt;&gt; everybody say, "Regardless." &gt;&gt; He didn't just throw that word in there just regardless just to throw it. He's telling you, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter your situation. &gt;&gt; Regardless of your situation, if you just believe it, he'll heal you. He didn't tell you what time it'll be. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell you, Amen, that you won't have to go through things. But this is one thing. If you'll just believe it, he'll heal you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you've got to believe it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, notice it was her faith that made her whole. Now the prophet as he says about this woman as he did the other woman, she had no promise. &gt;&gt; Now think of that. She had no promise that she would get well. &gt;&gt; There was no scripture for her to refer to &gt;&gt; of someone touching another person and getting well. &gt;&gt; But her faith She just so believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That if I just touch the hymn of his garment, I will be made whole. &gt;&gt; God honored that faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; She didn't need a teaching &gt;&gt; on how to touch somebody. Right. &gt;&gt; Her faith, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; calls her to say within herself, &gt;&gt; if I can just touch him, &gt;&gt; I know that's a little odd. Nobody's ever done it before, but I really don't care. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; See, her faith made her whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't even see a vision of her like he did Lazarus coming out of the grave. &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus saw Lazarus coming out of the grave. He had a vision of that, but he did not have a vision of her being made well. Her faith. &gt;&gt; It was just her faith. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Prophet says it was a different. You could tell it. He didn't get weak at Lazarus grave cuz God was using that gift. &gt;&gt; God used that gift, &gt;&gt; but he got weak at this woman because she was the one using the gift. Right. &gt;&gt; He said, "I feel virtue. I felt strength leave me because she pulled on the gift." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet says he never Jesus never said, "I saw a vision. You're going to be well." He said, "Thy faith have saved thee." By faith, not what the father showed me, but what you acted on. &gt;&gt; That's what hurt him. Other words, that's what made the strength leave him and made him feel weak. &gt;&gt; You don't need a vision. &gt;&gt; You don't need a dream. &gt;&gt; You just need a belief. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So he says, now here it is. All right. You jump up. Look, that's what the woman's doing. It pulls. It strains. Somebody comes to the platform. Stand there. You're straining. It's a gift. Who's using it? Well, it ain't me. you are. You're the one that's doing it. You sit there and you say, "I believe that." And down in your heart, you really mean it. Then that's pulling the strength. And what happens? I'm pulling up. You have cancer. &gt;&gt; So, something's working now. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram didn't know who who was who out there, &gt;&gt; but somebody had faith. Somebody said, "That's right." &gt;&gt; What he said is the truth. I believe that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that faith begin to pull. &gt;&gt; To where a lot of times he's standing here talking to this person. He said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I see that light going out. It's over you." &gt;&gt; And he begins to tell that person, "Your faith made you whole. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Didn't need a prayer card. Didn't need to stand there. Her faith done it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See her faith of this woman, this the faith of this woman caused her to do whatever she needed to do to touch the hymn of his garment. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; now Bible says she pressed through the crowd. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, if you're in a crowd, um, it can get really hectic. People can press. People can push. Especially if it's a real tight crowd. &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful, you get knocked down. You're going to get stomped on. &gt;&gt; People have been stampeded in crowds &gt;&gt; because they fell and it was such a tight crowd and people were just pressing. They weren't worrying about what's here. But the Bible says she pressed. &gt;&gt; She pushed. No doubt she got on her hands and knees and begin to get go between her legs. Whatever she had to do, &gt;&gt; faith says, "I'll do it." &gt;&gt; Because if I can touch him, I know I'll be made whole. &gt;&gt; She had nothing else to depend on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we can't have faith because we've got everything else to depend on. But when the money is gone, when the doctor says no way, when everybody gives up hope, there's still a hope. if you could just believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, she did not have any promise that it was going to work for her. But you know what? Here we sat with promise after promise after promise. &gt;&gt; She didn't have the word like we have it today. She was on the other side of Calvary and yet believed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The blood of Christ had not been shed. &gt;&gt; No one had been loosed by his own blood as of yet. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Satan hadn't been defeated yet. &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't yet went to hell and taken our sins down there and and and and grabbed the the keys of death, hell, and the grave from Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan hadn't yet been rendered toothless. and hopeless &gt;&gt; and helpless. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had not yet been stripped of his power. The chasm that had separated man from God was still there. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The seals hadn't been open. The word, the mysteries hadn't been revealed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There wasn't a a voice that cried, "Worthy is the lamb &gt;&gt; to take the book and loose the seals thereof." &gt;&gt; And yet her faith got what she needed. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh yes. She was still under the blood of bulls and goats, &gt;&gt; but yet her faith &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She believed in who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of it now. The Holy Ghost hadn't even yet come into the man. &gt;&gt; So, she didn't even have God living in her. &gt;&gt; All she saw was God living in a man. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He hadn't made an expression yet. Jesus hadn't yet said, "You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She didn't hear them words. &gt;&gt; She didn't have that promise as of yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. She didn't hear Jesus say, "If you say to this mountain and doubt not, &gt;&gt; you shall have whatever you say." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; She didn't hear him say, "The works that I do shall you do also, even greater than these." &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; she yet didn't have that word. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world. &gt;&gt; She didn't have these promises that we have today. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hello. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She didn't have the promise, no weapon formed against you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; She didn't have that promise. Amen. That I am persuaded that neither death nor life or principality or tribulation shall separate me from the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Here we are on the other side of the Calvary. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Satan has been defeated. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm waiting for him to be defeated." You're you're you you must be on the other side of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Your brain is over there &gt;&gt; because I've heard he's already been defeated. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he's afflicting me, so he still must have the keys of death, hell, and the grave." That's not what the Bible says. He ain't got no right over you. &gt;&gt; He lost his legal right over you at Calvary. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're not on the other side. We're on this side of Calvary where the scripture is made clear to us that if you speak to this mountain, be thou removed and doubt not, you shall have whatsoever you &gt;&gt; sayest. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're on this side of Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ. How many have you been loosed? &gt;&gt; We've heard the loosening. What kind of a loosening is? If it's perfect blood that has loose you, then it's a perfect loosening. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She didn't have that promise. &gt;&gt; She didn't have that revelation. &gt;&gt; But what she knew, she says, "If I just touch him, &gt;&gt; I'll be made whole." &gt;&gt; Did it without a promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet we got promise after promise after promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're on this side of Calvary. We have been justified. &gt;&gt; How many believes you've been justified? &gt;&gt; Where she was, Christ hadn't even died yet? &gt;&gt; Been hadn't been buried. Hadn't risen. &gt;&gt; But we're standing on this side where he was died. He was buried and he rose again for our justification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope that means something to you. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; She was on that side where hadn't even heard about the manifestation of sons of God. &gt;&gt; But yet within her faith, she said, "If I can just touch him, I'll be made whole." &gt;&gt; Think about that. Can I ask you this? The promises that we've been hearing that have that have been loosened to us, is it building any kind of faith? &gt;&gt; Does it have that faith to where we can look at the promises and say, you know what, I I understand why they were all that way down down them ages and all that and thank God for all them and what they've done, but this is a different age &gt;&gt; and there's never been a time outside of this time for the manifestation of sons of God. And I'm part of that. I am a son of God. She never heard the promised blood. Now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; She never heard that. We hear it. We heard a prophet say, "We're not going to be sons. We are sons and daughters of God." &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; She was looking at deity in a man. &gt;&gt; But how much better is it now? Deity is not in heaven. It's in you. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ has the keys of death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; She never even heard the fact that she was an heir of the promise. &gt;&gt; But we hear it. &gt;&gt; We've been told over and over that we're possessors of all things. &gt;&gt; If you need healing, you possess it. If you need salvation, you possess it. If you need deliverance, you possess it. If you need victory over something, you possess that. Whatever demon is troubling you, you possess that. Can you say amen? We have been hearing the promise that Satan is under our feet where he belongs. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; You've been raised, you've been elevated in a position of authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; there ain't no need to cry. &gt;&gt; There ain't no need to be moaning the mountain. &gt;&gt; You already know that the mountain's going to be coming. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; show one scripture where it says that the mountain ain't going. You ain't going to face your mountain. It ain't there. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I'll show you a scripture where Jesus said, "If you'll say to that mountain, &gt;&gt; be thou removed and cast into sea." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Doubt not in your heart, but believe what you have said, you shall have what you've said. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I can show you a scripture in Zechariah, I believe it is, where where the headstone came down. They cried, "Grace, grace unto it, and there was a mountain there." And their voice said, "Who art thou, oh mountain?" &gt;&gt; You standing in our way. You realize that's this age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That mountain standing there and says, "Who art thou, oh mountain? &gt;&gt; Thou shalt be made a plain." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Why? The word has come to us. Grace, grace has come to us. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and look at the mountain and worry over the mountain. It ain't going to do you any good. &gt;&gt; Get out of worry and get in the faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what it takes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; We are redeemed. &gt;&gt; The chasm's gone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's no chasm. &gt;&gt; She got her healing when a chasm was still there. &gt;&gt; But her faith caused her to say, "If I can just touch it, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's all I need. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Her faith caused her to where she wouldn't just sit there and say, "Man, if I can just last until that man dies &gt;&gt; and buried and raised again, &gt;&gt; then I know I can get my healing." &gt;&gt; No, she acted on it right then. That's right. &gt;&gt; She pressed her away right then. &gt;&gt; I don't have to have a good report from the doctor to know that I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I don't have to have the symptoms gone to know that God has touched me. If I can just believe in the promise, &gt;&gt; you'll hear it. And and maybe next Wednesday we'll get into it. But brother Bram constantly telling people, "Go your way. Start thanking the Lord. Start thanking the Lord. Start thanking the Lord. One lady, one lady says or man, one of the two, he goes, "I'm going to pray. I'm going to pray for you that you'll get over this fear and that you'll leave and start praising God for your healing." &gt;&gt; I think a lot of time we need to pray for one another that we can get over the fear of things and the worry of things and start praising God for the answer. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now is the hour. the word. So, we have to have faith just as this woman did. And it ought to be easier for us to believe. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, that we do have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; She didn't. &gt;&gt; But we do. How many's got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; See, you've got something that that woman didn't have. And the Bible says that his spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; So you you understand that I know we all have feelings and I understand we all get low and I understand sometime we don't feel like we're Christians. We're word not worthy and we're just this and we're just that. But the Holy Ghost inside of us starts bearing witness that we're still sons of God. There's just something there that just won't let us sit there and in the dumps and pout and whine and and and all the there's something in there. When the word starts being preached, there's something starts striking our soul. That's right. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we start just drying up our tears. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; We start casting down reasonings. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Because faith now strikes our heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; I hope this all right &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; It's so important for us to believe. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Mark 9:23, "If thou canst believe, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to them that believe." All things. Everybody say, "All things." &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham says, and I'll read you a few quotes, but he says, "As your faith moves, as your faith moves, so does the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Think about that. Another place he says, "Now I'm watching." He's he's in discernment. He said, "I'm watching a scene take place. Little lady there crying right over to my right. In your eyes, that gallbladder, that's what you had, wasn't it? It just left you just now." &gt;&gt; Are you happy? Say amen. Mhm. I don't know you. I've never seen you. What was she doing? She's pulling on the gift. I've never seen you, but he knows you. I'd just seen it go. &gt;&gt; Your food's been souring and everything else in your stomach and cramping and hurting. Don't worry now. Your faith did it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, if brother Brandon was here, it would be okay." You got the same message. &gt;&gt; You got the same message. You got a greater understanding than that woman did in the audience. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry now. Your faith did it. &gt;&gt; See, you were weeping. You were sincere. You were praying, too, wasn't you? God will take it away. He did. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; How would I know what you was praying about? Now, this is this about I just about shouted. He said, "I heard it at the throne." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. you were praying. It's over now. &gt;&gt; Now you think of that. The prayer of a believer, &gt;&gt; a prophet heard it at the throne of God. &gt;&gt; He didn't hear it on earth. He didn't hear her vocally say it. &gt;&gt; He didn't verbally hear physically hear her praying. &gt;&gt; He was at the throne &gt;&gt; and he heard her prayer over there. How does that happen? I have no idea. But I'm telling you, you mothers keep praying. Your prayers there at the throne. You fathers keep praying. Church, keep praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Good preaching. That's right. &gt;&gt; Her prayer was heard at the throne because of her faith. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Hallelujah. Now, notice what brother Brandham says. It's not the size of the dog in the fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the size of the fight that's in the dog. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's not how spiritual you feel. It's just the faith that you have. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to have a mountain full of faith. Just faith is the grain of a mustard seed. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he said that's right. That's what it takes. It's somebody who's got that courage and faith in God to stand there and say, "Thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do we have to feel something in order to say, "Thus sayaith the Lord." No. Do we have to have a a prophecy spoken over us in order to say thus sayith the Lord? No. Do we need a dream or a vision? Do we need to feel good to say thus sayith the Lord? No. You already have thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; For as we've read before, but Paul said the word of faith is nigh thee, even in thine heart and in thy mouth. That is the word of faith which we preach. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important to hear the preaching of the gospel. &gt;&gt; It's so important to be at church. &gt;&gt; So important to hear play them tapes. &gt;&gt; So important to to grasp in every word. &gt;&gt; We're not just sitting here gaining knowledge. &gt;&gt; You're being equipped &gt;&gt; to speak to your mountain. And one of these days we all going to face our mountains. We've already been facing our mountains. But some of these mountains are going to be big. &gt;&gt; And you need thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You need to know what is yours. You need to believe what a prophet said about you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; To speak, thus sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So the word has come to us in this day, you are only confessing. So when you say, "Well, thus sayith the Lord," it's not just God coming down and giving you something. You've already got it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So now when you speak thus says the Lord, it's a confession. &gt;&gt; You're only saying what's already been said. &gt;&gt; Now we know that he is the high priest. Christ is the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brown says Christ can't do nothing for you until you confess it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you understand that, right? &gt;&gt; You say, "Poor me. You ain't moving him." &gt;&gt; That don't get him to start working as a high priest for you. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; But the moment you start confessing what he said about you, &gt;&gt; right? Well, I'm not sick. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Thank God for healing me. &gt;&gt; You You You got all these symptoms there to saying you're sick. You say, "Well, well, how am I supposed to do ventury? Uh uh uh you know, uh uh look like I'd be lying. Looks like I'd be not telling the truth." &gt;&gt; God's word is more true than your sickness is. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God's promise is more real than what you're feeling. The truth was more real God of what God said than what Sarah and Abraham was going through. &gt;&gt; God said, "You're going to have a son." That was more real to Abraham than his own condition and Sarah's condition. &gt;&gt; So therefore, he just started confessing what God said. &gt;&gt; He had thus said the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because God had promised him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so then we're confessing. Now, as brother Brandham was preaching, he said, "Oh, brother, this is like cornbread and beans. It sticks to your ribs. &gt;&gt; It'll hold you some way. You can go and do a good day's work for the Lord tomorrow and go out and meet the devil and say, "I know where I'm standing. Not because a chill run down my back, but because thus sayith the Lord, "Move off, Satan. I'm taken over now." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Move off, Satan. So the preaching of the gospel was equipping the people to go out live their daily lives and when the devil comes and tries to wreck up their home, wreck up their life, whatever he comes in, whatever form he comes in, they would have thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just say Satan move off. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm moving in now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I'm taking over. Man had a dream one night. He dreamed that the devil was a little bitty old thing. And this little devil got after this man. And that devil would say, "Boo." And the man said in the dream, he he would he would cower, move back, the devil would come up closer. Boo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The man would jump back. Boo. Man would jump back. Get driving. That devil just having his heyday. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Little old thing. &gt;&gt; Boo. &gt;&gt; The man would cower and jump. The man says, "I I knew I knew I had to fight him. I going to have to deal with him someday." Can I say that here today? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we're going to have to deal with him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so he says, "I I just grabbed that Bible. I reached over and got the Bible and and and he said he just kept backing up and the devil kept coming in. Then the man made a hit at him." I think in one place said, "Boo back." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we did that. He got big because every time the devil said boo, the devil got bigger and bigger and bigger and he got smaller and smaller and smaller. &gt;&gt; When he said boo back, the devil got smaller and he got bigger and bigger and the devil got smaller and smaller. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "See, every time, brother, every time he hollers boo and you jump back, he'll just keep getting bigger. But when you take God's word and stand there and say, "Thus sayeth the Lord, it's written." &gt;&gt; He will take his flight and he will get littleer. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Just by thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "No matter how much the gospel is preached, how present God was, if you draw back and don't believe it, they can never help you." &gt;&gt; Amen. They might anoint you with oil, put hands on you, or do anything in the world. It would never help you until your faith moves from here down into here. And you just say, "Yes, God. &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; I just believe it." Can you say, "Amen. &gt;&gt; I just believe." So, see, our job as ministers, the the one important thing that we've got as ministers is to get you to believe. That is the desire of my heart is to get every one of us just to believe. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then rest. &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to worry over it. Don't don't fret over it. You say, "Well, then then it should maybe I'm not caring if I don't worry over it." No, you you're of no value. that worry is not making you any money, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's no value to you. But if we really care, then let's believe the word of God &gt;&gt; and confess the word. Brother Brown said, "If I can just get you to believe me with all your heart, that's what moves God and then you're healed. &gt;&gt; Your faith has saved you." him speaking to a woman. He says in in you is a spirit of darkness or something. And whatever it is, it knows this spirit, it knows if I can get you to believe, it's got to leave you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason it fights. So that's what makes it such a pull. It's got a kindred spirit out there. Now he's dealing with this this lady, but you hear many times that he looks down in the audiences, "Ah, you got that same thing." &gt;&gt; He said, "Because I hear this spirit's calling out for help." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's fighting because he knows if if the person can just start believing that devil's got to leave, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's got to leave. So he said, "See, he knows that he's troubled for you're already healed." &gt;&gt; You had a female trouble, didn't you? But you're healed. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Your faith has saved you, sister. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, we're in a warfare. So, you're going to have to fight. Everybody say, "I'm going to have to fight." You're going to have to fight for whatever you need. &gt;&gt; If it's healing, you got to fight it. &gt;&gt; So, you may say, "Well, I by George, I am going to I'm going to start confessing." That's good. But what it's going to be tomorrow if the doctor tells you I don't know. There must not be much. You know, I don't know. This is a It's beyond us. What if the symptoms start getting worse and worse and worse? &gt;&gt; Don't look at them symptoms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might just be so tired and wore out and that's all real. &gt;&gt; But don't look at it. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the question is is do we have the faith to press beyond the negative reports and press beyond the symptoms that we're having? In another case, as I get ready to close, brother Brown says, "If I can only get you to believe, it's going to leave you. If I can't, it can hold you. Now it lays in your faith in the finished work of Calvary." &gt;&gt; So we must not cry about it. We must not worry about it. We must not fred over it. We got to believe. Brother Bram said, "This has been the greatest thing that I found among Christian people throughout the world has been a fear. They're always afraid. When a little sickness strikes, they're afraid." Many I wonder sometimes. And now I'm along with you. Now notice what a prophet saying. I'm along with you. But now what I'm trying to do tonight in this week and in this week to come is to drive that fear away by God's word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come &gt;&gt; another place he says the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost. that Christ died at Calvary to free his church from superstitions and fear and doubt and trembling. He lives today. How many believes that he rose from the dead? He's alive tonight. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Say, "But the doctor told me I couldn't live, but hear ye him." &gt;&gt; The pastor exccommunicated me and said I'd be lost forever. Hear ye him. say, "Well, Brother Brandham, I haven't got it. I don't know what I will do if well, the doctor said I couldn't live. The hospitals turned me out. But hear ye him. I'm the Lord who heals all your diseases." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; What do I hear? A little while and the world seeth me no more, but you shall see me. Because I live, you shall live also. The world won't see me, but you will. And the things that I do, the works that I do, you'll do also. I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. Hear ye him. He's the one that can save you. He's the one that can heal you. He's the one that's responsible for this. He's the one responsible to his word. If I be lifted up, I'll draw men unto me. Oh, preach it from the pulpit. Wherever you are, lift him up and give him to the people. Hear ye him. Can you say amen? Do you have ears to hear to hear him? &gt;&gt; Said one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear. Everybody's scared to death of what's going to happen, who and what, and all these things. He said the greatest hindrance in the church is fear. They're afraid that it just won't work. They're afraid that the promise won't work. Well, it just won't for you that way. It will not work that way. It must be absolutely believers. Not make believers, but believers from your heart. Another place he says, "I'm trying to show you people that there's no need of being scared." The worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear. Even if you had a cancer and didn't fear and believe God would heal you, you wouldn't be in too bad of a shape. &gt;&gt; God take care of that if you were sick, whatever it is, if you didn't fear. So fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon a person. Think of that. One of the worst. It's worse than it's worse than anything. He He put a little sickness on you, but fear is worse than that. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Cuz we can sit here and be afraid. It ain't going to help us. But if you can believe, &gt;&gt; take God at his word. Can you say amen? So, we should do our best to get people to believe. &gt;&gt; We should do our best just to talk about the promises of God. When you're talking to sick folk, tell them about the promises of God. Don't cower down. Don't get into their migrs. Take them to the promise. If that woman by hearing what God had done and was doing in her day and faith could be quickened her just by hearing it and she get her healing. What about us? Just tell them about the promises of God. Can you say amen? You love him. &gt;&gt; He says, "No matter what it looks like here, we don't look at what we see. We look at what we do not see." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Any anyhow to see doesn't mean to look at. The word see means to understand. Jesus said, "Except a man be born again uh or born of water and spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God." In other words, he can't understand the kingdom of God until he's born again. You have to accept it by faith. And then when he comes into you, you understand it. You accept the healing the same way. Stay right with it. Everybody say, "Stay right with it." Stay right with it. Not what you look at, but what you believe, what you understand to be the truth. So, what do you understand to be the truth is where you're going to set your faith at. Doctor says, "Well, there's no hope for you. Is that the truth? Is that what you understand to be the truth? You're going to look at God's word and understand this to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, now see, he said, we're looking at the unseen. Then stay with that. That's why all these visions I just laid my life right on on any for it never fails. I have faith in it. I believe it. If I can get you to believe the same thing, it's over. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen. My God is so much bigger than troubles I face. Shen, I won't be moved. [Music] Our God is faithful. His promise is true. [Music] I'll speak to this mountain. It's time to move. [Music] Oh, why would I worry when giants come calling my name? [Music] My God is so much bigger than the troubles I face.

[Music] We've been made victorious [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ. Second verse. Oh, hold on. We're getting stronger every day. [Music] There's no reason for you to be afraid. faith. Don't you lean to your understanding. Just lean on him and proclaim. We've been made more than conquerors, [Music] overcomers in this life. We've been made victorious [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ. [Music] Now you think of that that lady didn't have a song like that to sing. Never even probably heard that we've been made northern concourse cuz she was on that side of Calvary. But we have heard it. We've heard that we're made more than conqueror. It's finished. It's over. It's done. Now just go whoop your devil. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? All of heaven is behind you. You know it. All of heaven's behind you. When you start confessing God's word, all of heaven stands behind you to make it come to pass. Let's stand to our feet. God bless you is our prayer. We love you and we want to [Music] we want to keep Sister Martha in our prayer as um she's going to be having quite a more test to be done and um you know and as they determine what they're going to need to do uh for this. And so, um, we want to just really just keep keep, uh, our prayer before the throne of God. And, um, she has no appetite, does not want to eat. And, um, so we just need to pray that God will give her her appetite back and she can start getting strength. And um, so anyway, we're prayer warriors, aren't we? And uh we're holding to a promise. We want to keep Sister Lisa uh I just Sister Crystal in our prayer and that the Lord will just help her. Uh Sister Lisa uh Acres's daughter uh Rebecca just really needs a deliverance and um you know I just believe that God can do it. I believe that God can set that girl free from the drug addiction, from all the things that she's gone through. I've seen it and it's it's been witnessed. There's a couple, well, several, but when Jonathan was pastoring a church, that church, there was a couple that had uh gone astray, and they they got out in the wrong crowd, become druggies. They they were out there, but somehow God got a hold of them. Jonathan baptized them, that couple, they're serving the Lord. They actually moved from Ohio to get away from that crowd and they in North Carolina going to brother Josh Spennett's church. It's been a couple years now and and God is just doing a great work in their life. And so God is still testifying that even a drug addict can be set free. And I I believe that I've got my own cousin that he he was a mess and a half and and u drugs and con man gangs. Uh had a gang looking for him. Had to go in uh witness protection. Uh the guy should be dead and him and his wife ended up homeless in Florida and somehow they made a trek all the way back to Oklahoma. They gave their heart to the Lord 5 years ago, I believe six years ago or something to that effect. God so touched them people, wiped their slate clean. They were won by the law in several places. God totally wiped their slate clean. That that that girl, she didn't know nothing about God. I mean, Jesus loves you type. She didn't know nothing. And she had a record, a rap sheet. And when she gave her heart to the Lord, she told uh my brother, she says, "I need to go and make that ride." She said, "They're probably going to take me to jail and I, you know, got up there." He went with her, got up there and they couldn't find a rap sheet. Couldn't find, she said, "I'm there. I know I'm there. We can't find you in the database." She walked out of there a free woman. God so fought her battles. Amen. God bless you. Love you. Remember each one another. Brother Andrew will be ministering for us Sunday, Brother Glover. And so, uh, looking forward to that. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Brother Beiel, do you want to dismiss this or [Music]
