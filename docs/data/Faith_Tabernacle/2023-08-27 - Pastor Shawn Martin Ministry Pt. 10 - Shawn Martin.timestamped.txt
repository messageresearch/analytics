[46:32] Alves and brother Amos delivered their
[46:36] heart and the people uh just seemed to

[46:41] blessed and and so we're we're thankful
[46:45] for that and you know it's good to be
[46:47] around the people of God
[46:49] and uh um I think it was brother
[46:53] Matthew's first time leading songs amen
[46:56] so he done a good job
[46:58] there and
[47:00] so we thankful thankful to the Lord and
[47:05] um
[47:05] I don't guess I ever ever done a meeting
[47:08] with brother Amos before so it was an
[47:10] honor to to do a meeting with brother
[47:14] Amos and brother Steve and but also
[47:18] heard it's uh David's birthday
[47:21] saying man is it your birthday today
[47:23] well happy birthday
[47:25] you know we ain't got no music but we'll
[47:28] do it acapella how about that
[47:30] uh versus my leaders
[47:33] happy birthday to you
[47:37] happy birthday

[47:47] happy birthday
[47:49] to you
[47:51] [Music]
[47:55] amen
[47:57] so he's turned three today
[48:00] what is it oh eight okay I figured I'd
[48:05] get a reaction
[48:07] so David's eight years old praise the
[48:11] Lord amen well we we appreciate these
[48:15] young people
[48:16] amen well uh as we go to the word of the
[48:21] Lord before we read let's just bow our
[48:23] heads and talk to our Lord father
[48:29] we come to you Lord just
[48:33] anticipating for you to speak to us
[48:38] and Lord the only way you have done it
[48:40] is is you work through the agency of men
[48:44] and father we don't take our position
[48:46] lightly Lord and
[48:49] that we just humbly asked that you would
[48:52] just now come and
[48:54] use the gift that you placed with the
[48:57] Enemy Lord and help me just to get
[48:59] myself out of the way
[49:01] and I pray Lord that you would just
[49:04] speak to your people and may the people
[49:07] be anointed Lord to hear and to
[49:10] understand and to receive father
[49:13] Lord take what simple words that we
[49:16] would have today and just multiplied in
[49:19] our hearts that we could be drawn closer
[49:22] to you and better prepared for the
[49:25] Rapture at hand we ask it father and we
[49:29] just Commit This service into your hands
[49:32] in Jesus Christ's name and everyone says
[49:37] amen and amen Hosea the 12th chapter we
[49:43] read this
[49:44] here recently but it says I have and the
[49:47] tenth verse I have also spoken by the
[49:50] prophets and I have multiplied visions
[49:53] and used
[49:55] similitudes by the ministry of the
[49:59] prophets amen you can have your seats
[50:02] this morning
[50:05] and again just looking at Ministry
[50:09] God having a Ministry today
[50:13] and as we have said that this ministry
[50:17] is the agency by which God's purpose is
[50:21] accomplished and today by the message of
[50:26] the hour we we have come and are still
[50:30] coming to understand
[50:33] uh God's purpose and what was in his
[50:37] mind
[50:38] from the foundation of the world
[50:41] and we can spend much time talking about
[50:44] the purpose of God and and what he has
[50:47] in his mind but again most of us know
[50:50] his his what his purpose is of course if
[50:54] you uh listen to the message uh
[50:59] Christ is the mystery of God revealed uh
[51:02] brother Branham goes into it and and
[51:05] it's a if you haven't listened to it or
[51:07] been a while you ought to go back and
[51:10] listen to it and
[51:12] just sit down and really listen you
[51:16] don't ask the Lord to reveal it to you
[51:19] but brother Branham says it's a
[51:21] threefold purpose and he says number one
[51:25] God wanted to reveal himself to the
[51:27] people he couldn't do it as a great
[51:31] Jehovah God who covered all space Time
[51:33] and Eternity could not he is too great
[51:36] to ever be revealed to people because it
[51:39] would be too mysterious
[51:41] but he what he wanted to do he loved
[51:44] fatherhood so for he was a father and
[51:48] the only way he could express it was to
[51:51] become a son of man that's the only way
[51:54] he could express himself was to become
[51:56] son of man he wanted to express himself
[51:59] and that was one of his great threefold
[52:02] purposes was to express himself
[52:04] identify himself with human beings to
[52:08] reveal himself in Christ amen but then
[52:12] he said the second uh uh of his
[52:16] threefold purpose was to have the
[52:18] preeminence in his body of Believers
[52:21] that is his bride that he might live in
[52:26] people amen and he says he could do that
[52:30] in Adam and Eve but sin separated them
[52:33] so now there had to be some way to get
[52:36] it back again ain't that right now he
[52:39] asked the question why didn't he just
[52:41] keep Adam and Eve from sinning and and
[52:44] that's been a question uh I'm you know
[52:48] that that the world has and it's been a
[52:51] a mystery but then brother Branham opens
[52:54] that to us and and how simple it is but
[52:57] uh profound but but he says he God would
[53:00] have never been able to express his
[53:02] fullness and his full attributes if if
[53:06] he uh uh kept them from sinning for he
[53:10] is savior he's not only father and uh
[53:13] but he's savior he's healer he's
[53:15] Redeemer and deliverer and Etc so only
[53:20] through Christ only through Christ could
[53:23] he Express these attributes in his
[53:26] fullness only through Christ could it be
[53:28] a son uh could be a Healer could be a
[53:31] deliverer a redeemer only through Christ
[53:34] good God to even have a bride it was
[53:37] only through Christ and so uh Paul would
[53:41] tell us in Colossians 2 and 9 that all
[53:44] the fullness of uh the godhead dwelt
[53:48] bodily in Christ amen it was all in him
[53:52] and and and then the prophet says then
[53:56] to bring that fullness of godhead bodily
[54:00] now you think of that then to bring that
[54:03] fullness of godhead bodily into a people
[54:06] so it isn't just all in Christ uh in
[54:11] that body but now it's to bring that
[54:14] that all the godhead in fullness bodily
[54:18] into a people that he could have the
[54:21] preeminence the oversight the leading
[54:23] till he could express himself through
[54:27] them aren't you glad for that there is a
[54:31] reason that God called us to this
[54:33] message I I man and and the more it
[54:36] unfolds the more happy we we we we
[54:40] become the the more uh uh grateful that
[54:45] we become uh because it is not just we
[54:49] didn't come from one brother Branham was
[54:53] not a reformer he did not come to take
[54:57] us out of one thing into another thing
[54:59] and but this is to make us part of God's
[55:03] mystery it's an unfolding of God's
[55:06] mystery that he had in the beginning you
[55:09] are why Christ died you are why I mean
[55:12] God uh all of these things but then the
[55:16] third part of of this threefold ministry
[55:19] is to restore the kingdom to its rightly
[55:23] position that failed by sin by the first
[55:25] Adam back to where he walked in the cool
[55:28] of the evening with his people talked
[55:30] with them and fellowshipped with them
[55:33] ain't that right
[55:34] now in the message the Masterpiece
[55:37] brother Branham says when God the great
[55:40] sculptor uh seemed the fall of of his
[55:44] family uh the Masterpiece he wasn't
[55:46] willing just to leave it lay there face
[55:50] down and ruin he went to work
[55:52] immediately to build it up again amen he
[55:56] wasn't willing that it should perish and
[55:59] lay there like that all the time because
[56:01] he is God and he will not be defeated
[56:05] you know brother Brown said we are his
[56:07] victory amen God will not be defeated so
[56:12] he went to work immediately and began to
[56:14] build again unto his own image amen
[56:18] ain't that right see when Adam and Eve
[56:21] listen to the LIE of the devil the
[56:23] prophet said the holy image of God left
[56:26] them a man their Fellowship was broken
[56:29] with God The Fellowship of Oneness with
[56:32] God was broken they and then the message
[56:36] the seed shall not bear with the shot
[56:38] man fail like the seed has to fall and
[56:42] then God began to brood over that after
[56:45] the fall he brought up an Enoch he
[56:47] brought up an Elijah he brought up a
[56:49] Moses he brought a prophet after Prophet
[56:52] trying to restore that image again and
[56:56] finally upon the Earth came the genuine
[56:59] image of God himself again which was God
[57:04] the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[57:08] amen and I'm so glad for that aren't you
[57:10] glad for that a man that we can identify
[57:13] I we were driving down for church and I
[57:17] saw a sign on the on of the Church of
[57:20] the of a title of a message for this
[57:23] morning and it was uh uh deity but yet
[57:27] man and and and I I thought well I would
[57:30] change that and I would put man but yet
[57:33] deity amen man and and I tell my wife
[57:37] you know I'd kind of like to hear what
[57:38] he's got to say about that or she I
[57:40] don't know these days but uh uh you know
[57:43] are they going to dwell on the deity are
[57:45] they going to dwell on the man part but
[57:47] I I tell you there is only a prophet
[57:50] that come to really let us know what was
[57:53] in that man and and that was the deity
[57:55] of God and without that deity you
[57:58] wouldn't be here today without that
[58:00] deity you you wouldn't be called the
[58:02] sons of God can you say Amen you would
[58:05] be called a church member you would be
[58:06] called a religious guy you would be
[58:08] called a theologian or whatever but we
[58:11] are called the sons of God because all
[58:14] of God was poured into that man and it
[58:17] you're saved by the blood of God you're
[58:19] Redeemed by The Works of God it's all
[58:22] about God ain't that rhyme amen and
[58:25] we're so glad for that that God would
[58:27] send a prophet and really focus on the
[58:29] deity side and what that really means to
[58:32] us but notice he says now that's same
[58:35] logos has a part A man he's got a bride
[58:39] and the same logos this word cannot be
[58:43] tampered with is brooding over the
[58:46] churches today trying to bring back the
[58:50] word to its full
[58:52] manifestation aren't you glad for that
[58:55] not not in Christ in that physical body
[58:58] but now in the bride amen the the the
[59:02] the mystical body the spiritual body of
[59:06] Jesus Christ amen so again trying to
[59:10] bring back the word to its full
[59:13] manifestation you know uh uh people
[59:16] today are are deceived into thinking
[59:19] that God doesn't mind you staying a
[59:21] sinner amen and and he loves you the way
[59:25] you are and and how how perverted uh uh
[59:29] man's thinking has become of God's love
[59:33] amen and and they just you know they
[59:35] they believe it doesn't matter what you
[59:37] do as long as you love Jesus and but yet
[59:40] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[59:42] Commandments ain't that right amen but
[59:45] but they say well God knows I I you know
[59:47] knows us and we just can't help it and
[59:50] da da da but this is why Christ died is
[59:53] to pour His fullness inside of you in in
[59:57] the in the Church of today and if you're
[1:00:00] part of that church then you're part of
[1:00:02] God ain't that right amen see so uh God
[1:00:06] does not have to accept our worship amen
[1:00:10] just because we worship just because a
[1:00:13] man says he loves God does not mean that
[1:00:16] God has to accept that on that basis
[1:00:18] just because uh uh the people come
[1:00:21] together and they begin to sing
[1:00:23] Christian songs and and and and and
[1:00:25] preach from out of this Bible and and go
[1:00:28] through the religious things of of what
[1:00:31] Christian does a man in the duties and
[1:00:33] all that does not mean mean that God has
[1:00:36] to accept it amen there's there's many
[1:00:39] times that God would tell this uh well
[1:00:42] in one place I believe that that that
[1:00:43] God told Israel Israel not a heathen
[1:00:46] Nation but Israel your sacrifices are a
[1:00:50] stink unto me a man you have pluted the
[1:00:53] table you have pluted the altars you
[1:00:55] have you you've you see and so all their
[1:00:59] worship have become formal all their
[1:01:02] worship all their duties had just become
[1:01:04] without sincerity and and all these
[1:01:07] things and God did not have to accept it
[1:01:09] and he did not accept it ain't that
[1:01:12] right amen he does not have to accept
[1:01:15] our beliefs just because we say it's
[1:01:18] right amen see true Christianity is not
[1:01:21] a bunch of Sinners running around living
[1:01:24] filthy and disrespectful to the word of
[1:01:28] God it does not consist of people a uh
[1:01:32] uh uh you know ignoring the word of God
[1:01:35] and being your irreverent to his plan
[1:01:38] and his way amen and this is where the
[1:01:42] Deception comes in is people all around
[1:01:45] the world is is is uh coming to a church
[1:01:48] they're worshiping and and and they're
[1:01:51] singing Christian songs and and I guess
[1:01:54] most of them are Christian a lot of them
[1:01:56] taking the blood out and a lot of them
[1:01:57] taking the power out and and I don't
[1:02:00] know what you know so but but you know
[1:02:02] and then they they preaching from a
[1:02:04] Bible where and they got through all
[1:02:06] kinds of translations to make sure that
[1:02:08] they get it right and and all of these
[1:02:10] things see but but but yet it's a
[1:02:13] deception of the devil amen and and you
[1:02:16] just have to say it because the prophet
[1:02:18] said it that way it's it's they're
[1:02:21] deceived amen but see God is trying to
[1:02:24] bring back a man his full manifestation
[1:02:28] uh uh uh to bring back the word to its
[1:02:31] full manifestation can you say Amen amen
[1:02:35] yeah uh uh there so you see God wants to
[1:02:38] have fellowship with you amen that's
[1:02:40] what a prophet says he Longs for you he
[1:02:44] Longs for you amen God has passions God
[1:02:47] God has desires amen just if you've been
[1:02:50] away a man from your spouse for for for
[1:02:53] whatever length of time and and and you
[1:02:57] know uh maybe uh months you know and and
[1:03:00] you can't wait to get back uh and and
[1:03:03] see her and and and and uh talk with her
[1:03:07] or and you're even your children just
[1:03:10] just to be around them and you've been
[1:03:12] away and and and maybe you hadn't got to
[1:03:14] talk to him maybe having uh you know uh
[1:03:17] uh but but you know you're coming home
[1:03:19] to see them and and man uh I've been
[1:03:22] there you know and and and just the the
[1:03:25] idea of getting to be with them again
[1:03:27] and my heart just aches for home and the
[1:03:31] fellowship and well that's what God does
[1:03:34] amen and that's what the prophet said he
[1:03:37] Longs for you amen God Longs amen see so
[1:03:41] he wants to transform you by the
[1:03:45] renewing of your mind amen see a man not
[1:03:49] to transform you to the church a man or
[1:03:52] to a denomination but to transform you
[1:03:56] to his word ain't that right amen see
[1:04:00] and so uh brother Branham said see
[1:04:02] transformed from the church and the
[1:04:05] world into Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:09] Amen that's what God's after he wants to
[1:04:12] transform you uh from the world from the
[1:04:16] church from the denominations and and
[1:04:19] and and and and and traditions and all
[1:04:22] of that into Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:24] and if that desire is in you then that
[1:04:30] shows that you're part of that word can
[1:04:34] you say man amen now there's a lot of
[1:04:36] people that just stop at being religious
[1:04:38] and they have no desire to go on but a
[1:04:41] real Christian a real true predestinated
[1:04:44] seed of God desires to move on desires
[1:04:48] to go on desire the more I I tell my
[1:04:52] wife today you know I I I I I just I the
[1:04:56] reason I get ministers in that just just
[1:04:59] so solid on this message and preaches
[1:05:02] this message and because it not only
[1:05:04] challenges you it challenges me as well
[1:05:08] amen because if you're not careful you
[1:05:11] get you get complacent you get
[1:05:13] complacent but then when a minister
[1:05:15] Rises up and he's preaching that message
[1:05:18] and he's directing us to the message and
[1:05:20] and and the anointing is there and all
[1:05:23] that it it brings an Enlightenment it it
[1:05:26] just it wants me to go further into this
[1:05:28] message it just wants me to go deeper
[1:05:31] into this message and study more pray
[1:05:34] more or give more to it you understand
[1:05:36] what I'm saying amen see and so now
[1:05:40] notice the prophet said True
[1:05:41] predestinated Believers will stay with
[1:05:44] the word because they're part of that
[1:05:47] word ain't that right amen True
[1:05:49] predestinated Believers will stay with
[1:05:51] the word because they are part of that
[1:05:54] word there is what the Bible called
[1:05:57] wandering stars and and and you know
[1:06:01] what they are they're wandering out in
[1:06:02] the world and they're going from one
[1:06:04] denomination to another one Church to
[1:06:06] another one idea to another and and
[1:06:09] they're never stable and and the prophet
[1:06:12] locking them like a leaf that is blowing
[1:06:15] in the wind as is falling to the ground
[1:06:17] and and you never know where it's going
[1:06:19] to end because the wind is just blowing
[1:06:21] it it's so unstable it's just at the
[1:06:24] wind's Mercy if you want to call it that
[1:06:26] amen and that's the way the wandering
[1:06:28] stars are in in the world today ain't
[1:06:32] that right but God does not want us to
[1:06:34] be be a Wandering Star a man God wants
[1:06:37] us to stay with that word and to become
[1:06:39] part of the word and to reflect the word
[1:06:42] and to be the word can you say Amen not
[1:06:45] ideas not not theories not doctrines in
[1:06:48] in the intellectual but down in the
[1:06:51] heart the word becoming part of us and
[1:06:54] we becoming part of the word so then we
[1:06:58] we find that we have talked about the
[1:07:00] ministry of angels and how that they are
[1:07:03] there with the Believers a man and they
[1:07:06] they are with us to minister spiritual
[1:07:09] blessings to us to help us along the
[1:07:11] road that too to to help fulfill God's
[1:07:15] purpose in our lives amen they encourage
[1:07:18] us the prophet said as we see the uh
[1:07:22] Zion you know uh up yonder in sight you
[1:07:26] know and and and the Comfort us they
[1:07:28] energize us with faith and and move us
[1:07:31] along see they are with every three
[1:07:35] predestinated seed of God Amen now you
[1:07:39] don't have to see the Angels a man to
[1:07:41] know that they're with you
[1:07:43] ain't that right amen you you don't now
[1:07:47] Elisha did not see the angels and yet he
[1:07:50] said more are they that are with us than
[1:07:53] they that are with them amen and I I
[1:07:56] thought all along that he was seeing
[1:07:58] angels and that little old servant
[1:07:59] wasn't seeing nothing and and and then I
[1:08:03] hear a prophet say Elisha never saw one
[1:08:06] Angel amen but he knew they were there
[1:08:08] because God promised that them Angels
[1:08:10] would be there can you say Amen so you
[1:08:13] don't have to see Angels now I know
[1:08:16] there are our brothers that that talk
[1:08:18] about it and and they've seen an angel
[1:08:20] the angel visits them and and maybe on a
[1:08:22] daily basis the prophet talked about
[1:08:25] seeing the angel of God and all that and
[1:08:27] and and you know you say well I don't
[1:08:29] see nothing is God for me is god with me
[1:08:31] you don't look at that I think God if if
[1:08:34] men can see Angels that's wonderful amen
[1:08:37] I'd love to see the pillar of fire
[1:08:39] there's other people that say they've
[1:08:40] seen the pillar of fire and at different
[1:08:42] times and and I'd like to say man I'd
[1:08:45] like to see that you know but I'm glad I
[1:08:47] got a picture there that we can see it
[1:08:50] there amen and and know what head uh uh
[1:08:53] who's who's it's over right amen but but
[1:08:56] uh so so there there are Supernatural
[1:08:59] things and people do see things but that
[1:09:02] doesn't mean that they're any more than
[1:09:04] what you are you just have to believe
[1:09:07] that them angels are with you you just
[1:09:10] have to believe it that little servant
[1:09:12] couldn't believe that so so God uh
[1:09:15] Elisha the prophet prayed that God would
[1:09:17] open his eyes and and then he saw what
[1:09:20] Elisha did not see but Elisha was
[1:09:23] already declaring that they were there
[1:09:24] because he believed it he believed the
[1:09:27] promise of God can you say amen amen say
[1:09:30] so so uh uh uh uh Psalms 34 7 the angel
[1:09:35] of the Lord in campeth round about them
[1:09:37] that fear Him and delivereth them amen
[1:09:41] you have to believe that ain't that
[1:09:43] right see so when people of God come
[1:09:46] together do you realize the angels of
[1:09:48] God are there I believe the angels of
[1:09:51] God are here right now amen I I I just
[1:09:54] believe that you realize that when you
[1:09:56] talk of God the angels are there
[1:09:59] amen when you talk about God and this is
[1:10:01] why the prophet said clean your house up
[1:10:03] amen because you you want the angels to
[1:10:07] entertain your home you clean it up you
[1:10:10] know hey clean it up because uh angels
[1:10:13] are there with you ain't that right now
[1:10:15] notice the prophet of God says and this
[1:10:18] ought to encourage us the angel of the
[1:10:21] Lord everybody say the angel of the Lord
[1:10:23] accompanies this message always
[1:10:26] amen if you're a believer of this
[1:10:28] message the angel of the Lord are with
[1:10:30] you
[1:10:31] now now he does not accompany a man's
[1:10:34] gift
[1:10:36] ain't that right amen he accompanies
[1:10:39] this message
[1:10:41] you know they're they're I I've said it
[1:10:44] last night say it again but there are uh
[1:10:47] uh Ministries or ministers I've seen
[1:10:49] ministers that that got too big for
[1:10:51] their britches if you want to say it
[1:10:53] that way and and and uh I I see
[1:10:56] ministers a lot of times that that can't
[1:10:58] you know can't submit to the message
[1:11:00] because they got their they they got
[1:11:02] their Ministry to promote they got their
[1:11:05] ideas to promote they've got amen
[1:11:08] they're following that they want you
[1:11:10] know and and so it's it's above them or
[1:11:13] beneath them what they're insulting to
[1:11:15] them if we could say it that way just to
[1:11:17] quote what a prophet said they want to
[1:11:19] do away with the quotes they want to do
[1:11:21] away well you're quoting the prophet too
[1:11:23] much and all I'm not afraid to quote a
[1:11:25] prophet I I just ain't because it's it's
[1:11:28] there and and and so but then they'll
[1:11:31] walk away from this message and they
[1:11:32] become nobodies
[1:11:34] they become nobodies because they
[1:11:37] thought it was them that was making
[1:11:38] their Ministry and they didn't realize
[1:11:40] it was the message of of the hour and if
[1:11:43] you want an approval of God if you want

[1:12:26] message of the hour you you begin to
[1:12:29] testify of the message of God Amen I
[1:12:31] know people are scared and Afraid and
[1:12:33] ashamed Amen to talk about the message
[1:12:36] to people amen but you begin to talk to
[1:12:38] the the people about this message and
[1:12:40] watch the presence of God God show up
[1:12:42] amen the presence of the Lord the angel
[1:12:44] of the Lord will be with you amen when
[1:12:47] you talk about this message can you say
[1:12:49] amen amen so so the uh uh uh uh people
[1:12:53] have been mistaken Amen to believe that
[1:12:56] that will we're Baptist so God has to
[1:12:59] prove it God doesn't have to prove of
[1:13:00] that he doesn't have to prove that
[1:13:02] you're dancing and you're shouting and
[1:13:03] you're screaming and you're crying and
[1:13:05] you're slobbering and he doesn't have to
[1:13:06] improve of nothing amen may you stay
[1:13:09] with the message he'll approve of it
[1:13:13] amen because the angel of the Lord stays
[1:13:15] with the message can you say Amen do you
[1:13:18] love the Lord and you don't have to see
[1:13:20] the angel of the Lord to believe it just
[1:13:22] believe it
[1:13:23] just believe it and watch him go to work
[1:13:26] ain't that right now we find that
[1:13:28] there's the ministry of the holy spirit
[1:13:30] amen Psalms 18 32 it says it is God that
[1:13:35] girdeth me with strength and maketh my
[1:13:38] way perfect
[1:13:40] amen aren't you glad for that he makes
[1:13:43] my feet like kine's feet he set us me up
[1:13:46] on my high places he teaches My Hands to
[1:13:49] War so that a bowl of Steel uh is broken
[1:13:52] by my arms amen thou Hast also given me
[1:13:56] the shield of thy salvation and thy
[1:13:59] right hand hath Holden me up and thy
[1:14:02] gentleness hath made me great thou Hast
[1:14:04] enlarged my steps under me that my feet
[1:14:08] did not slip this is the ministry of the
[1:14:12] holy spirit amen it's 40 uh verse 47 it
[1:14:16] is God that Avengers me and subdueth the
[1:14:19] people under me he delivers me from my
[1:14:22] enemies yea thou Lift Us me up above
[1:14:25] those that rise up against me thou Hast
[1:14:28] delivered me from the violent man amen
[1:14:32] see there's Deliverance in the ministry
[1:14:34] of the Holy Spirit there's not
[1:14:36] Deliverance in the ministry of
[1:14:38] denominations a theologian a
[1:14:39] psychologist just are just a plain old
[1:14:41] preacher amen but there is a Deliverance
[1:14:44] in the holy spirit amen that's why we
[1:14:46] want the Holy Spirit to back us up we
[1:14:49] want the holy spirit in our churches we
[1:14:51] do not want to grieve the Holy Spirit we
[1:14:53] want the holy spirit in our homes we
[1:14:55] want it in our car we want it in our lab
[1:14:57] we want it here this morning amen
[1:15:00] because the Deliverance comes from the
[1:15:02] ministry of the Holy Spirit not from a
[1:15:05] preacher amen not from the pope not from
[1:15:08] a deacon or whatever it comes by the
[1:15:11] Holy Spirit May the Holy Spirit have his
[1:15:14] way Amen to break loose the shackles and
[1:15:17] the fatters amen to find every demon of
[1:15:19] Hell amen that would try to come upon
[1:15:22] the children of God it's by the Holy
[1:15:24] Spirit
[1:15:25] now Romans 8 33 it says who shall lay
[1:15:29] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:15:32] it is God that justifieth oh aren't you
[1:15:35] glad for the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:37] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[1:15:40] that died yea rather that is risen again
[1:15:43] who is even at the right hand of God who
[1:15:47] also maketh the intercession for us it's
[1:15:51] the ministry of the Holy Spirit can you
[1:15:54] say Amen oh do you believe that he
[1:15:57] maketh intercession for you even Paul
[1:16:00] says that we don't even know a lot of
[1:16:01] times what we're uttering what to groan
[1:16:03] and the Holy Spirit within us begins to
[1:16:06] utter and make intercessions
[1:16:09] can you say amen amen that's right see
[1:16:12] so there's a lot that we can say about
[1:16:14] the ministry of the Holy Spirit but seek
[1:16:18] God's purpose is what he had in his mind
[1:16:20] before the world began he wrote those
[1:16:23] names in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:16:26] foreknew them he called them he
[1:16:28] justified them he glorified them he
[1:16:31] predestinated them to be conformed to
[1:16:33] the image of his dear son he
[1:16:35] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:16:37] sons he predestinated that they would be
[1:16:40] his church without spot wrinkle or
[1:16:42] blemish he predestinated them to be his
[1:16:45] bride and you know what he is their
[1:16:47] father he is their bridegroom
[1:16:51] ain't that Ryan he is their redeemer he
[1:16:54] is their deliverer he is he he is there
[1:16:57] all in all ain't that right so now
[1:17:00] listen
[1:17:01] um as as we go in the beginning and and
[1:17:05] you can find this in in Satan's Eden but
[1:17:08] but by having faith in all his word his
[1:17:13] seeds God brought and Eden of Holiness
[1:17:17] and love and eternal life
[1:17:21] faith in all of God's word brought an
[1:17:24] Eden of Holiness love
[1:17:28] understanding Perfection
[1:17:31] eternal life
[1:17:32] ain't that right well that's God's law
[1:17:35] was faith God believed his own law ain't
[1:17:39] that right so he was able to create an
[1:17:43] Eden he was able to create a uh I don't
[1:17:46] know if Utopia if that would be the
[1:17:48] right word I don't know but he was able
[1:17:50] to a place of perfection an an
[1:17:53] atmosphere that was incredible that
[1:17:55] Satan could not penetrate Satan could
[1:17:57] not touch them and all of these things
[1:18:00] but but and it was done because faith in
[1:18:03] all of God's word brought this Eden see
[1:18:06] but then the prophet tells us it was
[1:18:09] surrendered by a woman Eve and now Satan
[1:18:14] has succeeded in perverting and taken
[1:18:17] over taking over this world and making
[1:18:19] it his kingdom that were that man was
[1:18:22] put on by free moral agency to choose
[1:18:25] for themselves of what kind of Life they
[1:18:27] desire notice by unbelief everybody say
[1:18:30] by unbelief by unbelief in all of God's
[1:18:34] word has brought the seed of unholiness
[1:18:37] in Satan's Eden so so by belief in God's
[1:18:41] word it God was able to to make an Eden
[1:18:44] a Perfection but by unbelief in all
[1:18:47] God's word now Satan is able to work and
[1:18:50] and he's able has brought the seed of
[1:18:53] unholiness in Satan's Eden we are now
[1:18:56] entering in where Satan has taken the
[1:18:59] throne as the Antichrist in an Eden of
[1:19:02] this Earth an Eden of sin perverted
[1:19:05] religion how did it come by unbelief
[1:19:08] amen he started not upon saying I am
[1:19:11] Satan I'm the great Angel no not upon
[1:19:13] that but upon perverting God's word and
[1:19:16] that's how he's brought his kingdom in
[1:19:18] every age and now in this great
[1:19:21] deceitful age he's ready to take his
[1:19:24] throne by his people by unbelievers he
[1:19:29] has built himself an intellectual
[1:19:32] education it is scientific Eden right
[1:19:35] scientific preacher scientific Church
[1:19:37] scientific theology everything is
[1:19:40] scientific everything is based upon
[1:19:42] knowledge amen the whole church is built
[1:19:45] upon knowledge it ain't built upon faith
[1:19:48] Satan's church is built upon knowledge
[1:19:51] not Faith Can you say Amen so that means
[1:19:54] if Satan is able to create his Eden by
[1:19:57] Faith by by knowledge not upon Faith
[1:20:00] than it God a man builds his church upon
[1:20:04] faith and faith is a revelation can you
[1:20:07] say amen that's right so now notice what
[1:20:10] the prophet says a genuine everybody say
[1:20:13] genuine a genuine son or daughter of God
[1:20:17] takes God's word first I don't care what
[1:20:21] anybody else says about it they take
[1:20:23] God's word first see there's poison in
[1:20:26] the cut they believe it right and it
[1:20:29] that's and it that's what God is
[1:20:31] planting his word his seed that's what
[1:20:34] his church will be at the end it will be
[1:20:38] the same thing it'll be the same thing
[1:20:42] they just take God at his word and
[1:20:44] that's it ain't that right so God's Eden
[1:20:49] was surrendered by a woman Eve but it
[1:20:53] was redeemed the prophet said by a man
[1:20:55] the man Jesus Christ which is the word
[1:20:59] so God brought the prophets that God
[1:21:02] will take it back someday by a man
[1:21:06] surrendered by a woman amen and so has
[1:21:09] it been the church today surrendered it
[1:21:12] all the uh the blessings of Pentecost a
[1:21:15] man that fell on on the day of Pentecost
[1:21:18] it was surrendered all of that
[1:21:19] surrendered over by the church a woman
[1:21:22] ain't that right but God promised he's
[1:21:25] going to restore it back
[1:21:27] ain't that right now notice of course
[1:21:30] this man is Jesus Christ and Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ he says I go to prepare a place
[1:21:35] for you amen now notice uh uh uh hear
[1:21:40] Isaiah 65 17 it says behold this is God
[1:21:44] speaking behold I create a new Heaven
[1:21:47] and a new Earth and the former shall not
[1:21:50] be remembered nor come into mind but be
[1:21:53] ye glad and rejoice forever in that
[1:21:56] which I create for behold I create
[1:21:59] Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a
[1:22:03] joy ain't that right amen so it tells us
[1:22:07] that we're not going to be here much
[1:22:09] longer amen that he's already been
[1:22:12] creating something new for us amen it's
[1:22:15] a prepared City for prepared people amen
[1:22:18] Revelations 21 1 and I saw a new Heaven
[1:22:21] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[1:22:24] the first Earth were passed away and
[1:22:26] there was no more sea and I John saw the
[1:22:29] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[1:22:32] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[1:22:34] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[1:22:37] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[1:22:39] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:22:42] will dwell with him and they shall be
[1:22:44] his people and God himself shall be with
[1:22:46] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[1:22:51] away all tears from their eyes and there
[1:22:53] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:22:55] nor crime see it's a total Eden than
[1:22:58] what you're in right now uh we're in
[1:23:00] this Eden and we have sorrow we have
[1:23:02] pain we have amen uh Agony and and all
[1:23:06] of these things but he says I'm the
[1:23:08] thing that I'm going to create I'll wipe
[1:23:11] your tears to where you'll never shed a
[1:23:12] tear again there'll never be any death
[1:23:15] sorrow crying neither will there be any
[1:23:17] more pain for the former things are
[1:23:19] passed away and he that set up on the
[1:23:22] throne said behold I make all things new
[1:23:24] and he said right unto me right for
[1:23:27] those were these words are true and
[1:23:30] faithful now we know uh from uh uh the
[1:23:34] future home brother Brown said it's not
[1:23:36] going to be a total annihilation of of
[1:23:39] this Earth but it's going to be a
[1:23:41] completely restored Earth
[1:23:44] a man just like it's not a total
[1:23:47] annihilation of you a man when he said
[1:23:50] you're a new creature or a new creation
[1:23:52] amen but it's a new something new amen a
[1:23:56] complete restoration amen it's a
[1:23:59] transformation do you believe that and
[1:24:02] guess what it's going to be a restored
[1:24:05] by the elect
[1:24:07] believing the word of God
[1:24:09] God is going to establish his Eden again
[1:24:13] not by him just believing his word but
[1:24:17] now him coming from the heavens dwelling
[1:24:20] in you impersonating himself in the
[1:24:23] church by his own faith believing his
[1:24:25] own word and what he is believing in you
[1:24:28] he's creating
[1:24:31] then you say man this Eden it will be
[1:24:34] restored by an elect believing the word
[1:24:37] of God and and in in church this
[1:24:40] transformation is already happening do
[1:24:43] you believe it amen do you feel it
[1:24:46] amen it's already happening amen notice
[1:24:49] amen Romans 12 2 and be not conformed to
[1:24:53] this world but be ye transformed
[1:24:56] yes
[1:24:57] can you say that with me be ye
[1:24:59] transformed who's that you
[1:25:03] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:25:05] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:25:08] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:25:10] will of God ain't that right now notice
[1:25:13] what the prophet said going from your
[1:25:15] own carnal mind to taking on his mind to
[1:25:20] do the perfect and acceptable will of
[1:25:22] God
[1:25:23] you're being transformed right now amen
[1:25:26] you were born with the carnal mind you
[1:25:28] was born with carnal ways you was born
[1:25:31] without understanding of God Amen but
[1:25:34] now has come a transformation that has
[1:25:37] taken place in a group of people amen
[1:25:40] the carnal mind is becoming more subdued
[1:25:43] and they're taking on the very mind of
[1:25:45] Christ and while they're taking on this
[1:25:48] mind he is becoming more known to them
[1:25:50] amen the Mysteries that were hidden in
[1:25:53] his mind is now becoming aware and known
[1:25:56] into this bride Hallelujah you taken on
[1:26:00] his mind amen you're understanding who
[1:26:02] you are he's already understood who you
[1:26:05] were
[1:26:07] he's the one that predestinated you he's
[1:26:09] the one that called you but now you're
[1:26:11] taking on that very same mind and now
[1:26:14] you're Awakening to he is a mystery
[1:26:16] revealed in you your Awakening to what
[1:26:19] he's already had in his mind you're now
[1:26:22] being transformed and your mind is being
[1:26:25] renewed that how could it be renewed
[1:26:27] without a prophet
[1:26:32] brother Brown says now we have been
[1:26:34] saved as we are or now that we have been
[1:26:38] saved as we are and that we have been
[1:26:40] filled with the Holy Spirit as we have
[1:26:42] now everybody say now what's the next
[1:26:46] thing now we want the mind of that was
[1:26:49] in Christ to be in us that we might be
[1:26:52] transformed from the Natural Things of
[1:26:54] life you see that the Rapture is
[1:26:57] happening already
[1:27:02] it's taken place in you
[1:27:05] there's a preparation going on
[1:27:08] it ain't it ain't just a three-week
[1:27:10] Revival it's not just a one-night
[1:27:11] Revival it's not just a preacher coming
[1:27:14] to excite us it's happening for a reason
[1:27:18] it's an eternal thing that's working in
[1:27:20] us that you might be transformed not
[1:27:23] just come to an altar and then go back
[1:27:24] smoking again not coming up here and
[1:27:27] said oh I believe I believe and then
[1:27:28] going back to the way you used to be
[1:27:30] this is a transformation that has taken
[1:27:33] place the last thing that is going to be
[1:27:35] transforming this is old body can you
[1:27:38] say Amen that you're taking on the mind
[1:27:40] of God right now
[1:27:42] you're seeing as God you're believing as
[1:27:45] God you're confessing as God Amen this
[1:27:47] world ain't got no hold on us I don't
[1:27:49] care what Trump does I don't care what
[1:27:51] the Democrats do I've got another
[1:27:53] kingdom
[1:27:54] and it's become a known to me how else
[1:27:57] would we really understand there's a
[1:27:59] heaven out there and a future home if we
[1:28:02] had not the mind of Christ but be ye
[1:28:04] transformed
[1:28:06] by the renewing of your mind
[1:28:13] that we might be transformed from the
[1:28:15] Natural Things of life
[1:28:17] and be brought in to do the perfect will
[1:28:19] of God by transformation of God's spirit
[1:28:21] by his word
[1:28:24] aren't you glad for that
[1:28:26] John 5 24 Jesus said verily verily I say
[1:28:28] unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:28:31] believeth everybody say believeth see
[1:28:34] it's not just hearing that this you say
[1:28:36] well I I hear it amen but anyone can
[1:28:39] hear it but he that heareth my word see
[1:28:42] how is this transformation going to come
[1:28:44] how is this Eden going to be restored
[1:28:47] how is your body going to be restored
[1:28:49] how's the translation going to take
[1:28:51] place it had to be by the renewing of
[1:28:53] your mind
[1:28:55] and the word had to come forth the word
[1:28:57] had to be restored
[1:28:59] pure word of God balance word of God
[1:29:02] Vindicated word of God can you say amen
[1:29:05] and you're now taking upon the mind of
[1:29:07] Christ and he that here is my word and
[1:29:10] believeth everybody say believeth on him
[1:29:13] that sent me hath everlasting life amen
[1:29:17] see you cannot help when you meditate
[1:29:19] upon the word of God when you believe
[1:29:20] that word of God when you receive the
[1:29:22] word of God you can't help but have a
[1:29:24] bright future
[1:29:28] shall have everlasting life and shall
[1:29:31] not come into condemnation but it's
[1:29:33] passed from Death unto life
[1:29:35] if you believe this message as a
[1:29:37] Believer you will not be disappointed in
[1:29:39] the end
[1:29:40] I just have to tell you you will not be
[1:29:42] disappointed Amen in the end when the
[1:29:44] tribulation comes you ain't going to be
[1:29:46] here when a Rapture takes place you'll
[1:29:48] be there can you say amen for it says it
[1:29:51] shall not come into condemnation that is
[1:29:53] already passed from death into life yes
[1:29:56] the tribulation is nothing but the
[1:29:57] judgments of God falling on those that
[1:30:00] have rejected this message
[1:30:02] can you say Amen
[1:30:04] that's why the prophet said it's grace
[1:30:06] to you that God would send a prophet
[1:30:07] it's grace to you that you would believe
[1:30:10] this message it's Grace
[1:30:14] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:30:16] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:30:18] and shall not everybody say shall not
[1:30:21] shall not see God cannot judge that body
[1:30:23] not his body he cannot judge it it's
[1:30:26] already been judged he put her judgment
[1:30:28] upon himself at Calvary see shall not
[1:30:32] come into condemnation but is passed
[1:30:34] from Death unto life and what is he he
[1:30:38] is the Living Word of this hour
[1:30:42] now brother Branham says I believe again
[1:30:45] in Satan's Eden he says today we don't
[1:30:48] try to establish the word of God in the
[1:30:50] people's heart
[1:30:51] see that's why the people can't be
[1:30:53] transformed and in in by the renewing of
[1:30:57] their mind if we do not establish the
[1:30:59] word of God
[1:31:00] and I'm not talking about a Baptist word
[1:31:03] Pentecostal word I'm talking about the
[1:31:05] message of this hour
[1:31:07] then then the people cannot be
[1:31:10] transformed by the renewing of their
[1:31:12] mind I just that's just the way I
[1:31:14] believe it amen if if if if God
[1:31:17] established his first Eden and
[1:31:19] established everything at that time amen
[1:31:22] by faith in all of his word it's got to
[1:31:25] be a requirement today that a people on
[1:31:27] this Earth are going to believe all of
[1:31:29] his word or why would God restore the
[1:31:31] word why would God take the time to send
[1:31:34] a prophet in this age and the lamb to
[1:31:37] open the book and give that open book to
[1:31:39] his Prophet that seventh angel to reveal
[1:31:41] it to the people if there ain't going to
[1:31:42] be no believer but he would do it in
[1:31:44] this time because it's time for a
[1:31:46] Rapture it's time
[1:31:49] we're at the end of everything it's time
[1:31:55] didn't Jesus say when you see these
[1:31:58] things begin to happen
[1:31:59] lift up your head
[1:32:01] don't don't don't put your head in the
[1:32:03] in the voting booth booth
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:06] lift up your head
[1:32:08] get your head out of the out of the
[1:32:10] television and lift up your head get
[1:32:13] your head out of politics and lift up
[1:32:15] your head I don't think it's just a
[1:32:17] literal head I think it's your mind
[1:32:21] everything about you get your mind out
[1:32:23] of the gutter and lift your thinking up
[1:32:27] get your vision off the future of
[1:32:29] America and and lift your head up
[1:32:32] there's a bright future
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:37] ain't that right
[1:32:40] isn't that what John after wrote in
[1:32:42] Revelations 4 1 after these things after
[1:32:46] the church ages
[1:32:47] amen I Heard a Voice in heaven
[1:32:49] saying come up hither John and he saw a
[1:32:52] door open
[1:32:54] can you say Amen church the church ages
[1:32:57] are over
[1:32:59] here
[1:32:59] this layout of cnh is ending out in
[1:33:03] complete apostasy
[1:33:04] ain't that right amen you know the
[1:33:08] question was asked uh uh I I think by
[1:33:11] one of my children or so about
[1:33:14] um uh why why doesn't the world know
[1:33:17] about brother Branham today if he had a
[1:33:19] worldwide Ministry why doesn't the
[1:33:22] people know I'll tell you why they know
[1:33:24] there's a lot of people that know about
[1:33:26] this but now what you're what you're
[1:33:28] into is complete apostasy gross Darkness
[1:33:31] gross Darkness where the devil has so
[1:33:34] hovered over them to where they don't
[1:33:36] know it's just like it it ain't been too
[1:33:39] long ago that women got out of dresses
[1:33:41] and started wearing their pants
[1:33:43] and and yet we go remember most of us uh
[1:33:47] I guess when we went to a couple years
[1:33:49] ago to Golden Corral
[1:33:51] and and the whole church was there and
[1:33:54] and so I was standing at the cash
[1:33:56] register watching every counting
[1:33:57] everybody to go by and and that little
[1:34:00] young lady she says wow I've never seen
[1:34:04] such she said you you you you you you
[1:34:07] remind me of Bible days
[1:34:10] I said well thank you
[1:34:13] but I said really it hadn't been just
[1:34:15] long ago
[1:34:16] I said that's the way they all used to
[1:34:18] dress
[1:34:20] but what is it and I'm not down in the
[1:34:22] the girl I'm just saying why people
[1:34:24] can't remember these things is gross
[1:34:26] Darkness has come on their intellect has
[1:34:29] come upon them to where they can't
[1:34:31] really think anymore people are going
[1:34:33] insane like crazy amen but God did
[1:34:36] vindicate this message it's gone seven
[1:34:38] times around this world can you say Amen
[1:34:40] that the only people that really see and
[1:34:43] understand what took place is the elect
[1:34:45] of God for it wasn't for the world it
[1:34:48] was for that he left thank you
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] thank you now he says today we don't try
[1:34:54] to establish the word of God in the
[1:34:56] people's hearts we are trying to
[1:34:58] establish ourselves churches are trying
[1:35:00] to establish the doctrine of the church
[1:35:02] in a person's heart we are commanded to
[1:35:05] establish the word of God Paul said I
[1:35:08] didn't come to you with enticing words
[1:35:10] of man that your faith might rest up in
[1:35:12] the knowledge of man but I come to you
[1:35:15] in power everybody say power in
[1:35:18] manifestations of the Holy Ghost that
[1:35:21] your faith your faith might rest in God
[1:35:25] Amen your faith is that what not has
[1:35:28] happened in our day
[1:35:36] he come in power and in manifestations
[1:35:40] that are Faith
[1:35:42] might rest in God
[1:35:44] why
[1:35:45] it's time for restoration
[1:35:48] not partial
[1:35:50] but complete
[1:35:51] full restoration brother Brown said man
[1:35:54] mustn't establish yourself
[1:35:57] find it amongst he said let God do
[1:35:59] something for a person and send him out
[1:36:01] and you find every man trying to
[1:36:03] impersonate it see they're trying to
[1:36:04] establish themselves one man has a gift
[1:36:07] everybody wants that gift one prophesies
[1:36:10] everybody wants to prophesy one sees
[1:36:11] Angels everybody wants to see Angels one
[1:36:13] sees Visions everybody wants to see a
[1:36:15] vision you understand what I'm saying
[1:36:17] and it's happening in the message just
[1:36:19] as well you see one starts Discerning
[1:36:21] and and then you got a whole bunch of
[1:36:23] guys trying to discern
[1:36:25] and and and but they're finding out it's
[1:36:28] it's you know uh uh one you know uh he
[1:36:33] had a meeting and discernment was going
[1:36:36] on you know so this young this young uh
[1:36:39] uh preacher you know he thought he got
[1:36:41] so wrapped up in it you know and he went
[1:36:42] to a little lady and said you got a
[1:36:44] lesbian spirit and she said I do not
[1:36:47] what in the world's wrong with you
[1:36:50] but see everybody wants to do something
[1:36:52] yeah you know what is it you're trying
[1:36:55] to establish yourself and not God
[1:36:59] hello
[1:37:01] I hope that's okay
[1:37:03] see every man saying I did this me I
[1:37:06] mine my denomination it's me see
[1:37:09] establishing themselves what are we
[1:37:11] preaching about ourselves or the kingdom
[1:37:13] of God
[1:37:14] establish the word of God take out the
[1:37:17] unbelief and establish the kingdom of
[1:37:20] God in a man's heart and the kingdom of
[1:37:22] God cannot be established in a man's
[1:37:24] heart lest God made that man thus
[1:37:29] it's not up to us to decide who is who
[1:37:33] just preach the message
[1:37:38] establish the word in the people's
[1:37:41] hearts
[1:37:44] that's right
[1:37:46] well I might offend The Sinner what if
[1:37:48] there's an elect in that crowd
[1:37:51] and you become so embarrassed about the
[1:37:53] message
[1:37:54] afraid you're going to run somebody off
[1:37:57] and the only thing that's going to grab
[1:37:59] this elect is this message
[1:38:02] can you say Amen they want to hear our
[1:38:05] opinions
[1:38:06] if it's just opinions they got opinions
[1:38:08] all over this world
[1:38:11] if it's just prophecies that's going to
[1:38:13] get there they got prophecies everywhere
[1:38:15] that's running rapid
[1:38:19] preach the message
[1:38:24] now if you notice God in Christ
[1:38:26] fulfilled his part
[1:38:28] of the unconditional Covenant that he
[1:38:31] made
[1:38:32] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:38:35] to fulfill his part of the Covenant
[1:38:38] is that right
[1:38:40] first God revealed himself in Christ the
[1:38:44] fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in
[1:38:46] Christ Jesus but notice again then to
[1:38:49] bring that fullness of godhead bodily
[1:38:52] into a people that he might have the
[1:38:55] preeminence the oversight the leading
[1:38:57] now everybody say now it's Christ in you
[1:39:03] fulfilling the second part
[1:39:06] of the Covenant
[1:39:10] ain't that right see what is the holy
[1:39:13] spirit Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:39:16] then what takes place you become a
[1:39:19] prisoner of Christ the prophet said
[1:39:21] see uh uh yeah I believe it's
[1:39:24] Philippians 2 and 13. for it is God
[1:39:26] everybody say it is God which worketh in
[1:39:29] you both
[1:39:32] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:39:36] ain't that right see when God gets you
[1:39:39] to be his prisoner then you can't do
[1:39:41] nothing the prophet said but what the
[1:39:43] spirit says do ain't that right at one
[1:39:47] time Paul the Apostle had high Ambitions
[1:39:50] and and with that he was taught by a
[1:39:53] great intellectual Man game and and Paul
[1:39:56] was studying to be a great priest a
[1:39:59] rabbi he he had real just he was very
[1:40:03] ambitious and high high dreams and
[1:40:06] intellectually Paul was the the greatest
[1:40:09] uh one of the great men in in the nation
[1:40:12] with great Authority the prophet said
[1:40:15] but notice but he had to sacrifice every
[1:40:18] bit of it to become part of the word to
[1:40:22] express Jesus Christ
[1:40:25] say that again he had to sacrifice every
[1:40:28] bit of his Ambitions his dreams his
[1:40:31] goals because it didn't line up with the
[1:40:33] word of God
[1:40:34] he sacrificed every bit to become part
[1:40:37] of the word to express Jesus Christ
[1:40:40] I I want to just say this because uh uh
[1:40:44] you know it really bothers me when when
[1:40:47] I hear ministers putting the message
[1:40:49] people down
[1:40:50] as though you know they're stuck up as
[1:40:54] though you know uh uh they're ignorant
[1:40:57] dumb and and I've heard it quite a bit
[1:41:00] and it really just it gets my
[1:41:03] Christian feathers ruffed
[1:41:06] uh because
[1:41:08] I don't think you have to belittle
[1:41:11] people in the message to make you look
[1:41:13] good
[1:41:14] you don't have to I don't think no you
[1:41:18] know I'm I'm speaking to the Core group
[1:41:20] of message Believers but they're not
[1:41:23] stuck up
[1:41:25] they're a humble group of people
[1:41:28] that ain't gullible
[1:41:31] we used to be gullible in the mess in in
[1:41:33] Pentecost
[1:41:35] if someone shook a leg we followed
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:40] it's if someone you know spit right we
[1:41:43] followed
[1:41:45] if someone had a dream we sucked it in
[1:41:47] we were gullible people
[1:41:50] but we're not gullible people
[1:41:52] this message took the VA the the
[1:41:55] vulnerability out
[1:41:57] this message took the gullibility out
[1:42:00] we don't follow just anybody
[1:42:05] can you say Amen the Bible says prove
[1:42:09] them
[1:42:10] prove them brother Brian said give them
[1:42:12] a word test
[1:42:13] ain't that right so if you don't see
[1:42:16] that people jumping high when you say to
[1:42:18] jump high it's not because they don't
[1:42:19] like you and it's not because they're
[1:42:21] they're stuck up and and all that they
[1:42:24] just want to see what the fruit of this
[1:42:26] thing is where is it going to lead me
[1:42:28] when I jump
[1:42:32] can you say Amen you see we've had to
[1:42:35] sacrifice every bit of us
[1:42:38] to come into this message
[1:42:40] and you say Amen if a man has not
[1:42:44] sacrificed every bit no wonder he
[1:42:46] doesn't see it can't really conjoin with
[1:42:49] the message people even though they say
[1:42:51] well I message the prophet and all this
[1:42:52] stuff if he can't sacrifice his own
[1:42:55] Pentecostal ideas his own Baptist ways
[1:42:58] his own Apostolic or whatever ways to
[1:43:01] really sacrifice it all to become part
[1:43:04] of the word he'll never be able to
[1:43:06] become part
[1:43:10] yes sir that's good
[1:43:13] he had to become part of the word to
[1:43:15] express Jesus Christ
[1:43:17] brother Brahman said see Paul was such a
[1:43:19] prisoner that he had a notion to go over
[1:43:21] to some place some brethren and called
[1:43:23] him had called him but he was forbidden
[1:43:25] by the spirit to do his own will if
[1:43:27] people have spiritual can pick that up
[1:43:29] he was forbidden to do his own will
[1:43:33] ain't that right see the spirit forbid
[1:43:36] me why he was a prisoner to Christ
[1:43:40] see there's another time that Paul knew
[1:43:42] that he had the power to cast The Devil
[1:43:45] out of that fortune teller amen she
[1:43:47] followed him around for for days and and
[1:43:51] and Paul never done nothing he allowed
[1:43:52] her to do what she was doing and and say
[1:43:55] what she was saying and all of that and
[1:43:57] yet he knew it was it was of the devil
[1:43:59] amen see and and so Paul did not
[1:44:02] question as to whether he had the power
[1:44:05] he knew that he had the power ain't that
[1:44:07] right but he waited everybody say he
[1:44:09] waited he waited till the spirit gave
[1:44:12] him permission to cast that thing out
[1:44:16] ain't that right see the power is in the
[1:44:19] church but it doesn't work on our own
[1:44:22] timing
[1:44:23] it doesn't work just because we say it
[1:44:25] works and we believe it works we we we
[1:44:28] believe that we have the power of God we
[1:44:31] believe that the holy spirit is working
[1:44:33] in us we believe Amen in the ministry of
[1:44:36] angels that they're with us all the time
[1:44:37] but it doesn't happen instantly Miracles
[1:44:41] don't happen instantly we don't just
[1:44:43] that we don't operate it on our own we
[1:44:45] are now becoming prisoners to the word
[1:44:49] and you have to have to be a believer of
[1:44:51] the word you have to be a faith believer
[1:44:53] in the word to believe all of God's word
[1:44:55] in order to be a prisoner because your
[1:44:58] sacrifice and your own notion you're
[1:45:00] sacrificing your own Ministry your
[1:45:02] sacrifice and your own ideas
[1:45:05] your own thoughts and becoming a
[1:45:07] prisoner and you say man so he's going
[1:45:11] to have full preeminence in the church
[1:45:13] you believe it young people who's going
[1:45:14] to have full preeminence and young
[1:45:16] people he's going to have full and
[1:45:17] preeminence in the preacher he's going
[1:45:19] to have full preeminence in the deacons
[1:45:20] he's going to have full preeminence in
[1:45:21] the musician he's going to have full
[1:45:23] preeminence in everybody that belongs in
[1:45:26] his church
[1:45:29] because it's all right
[1:45:31] say you'll never know the power of God
[1:45:33] until you become a prisoner to Christ
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:38] we don't have to try to make things
[1:45:40] happen it will happen in God's timing
[1:45:43] can you say that with me it will happen
[1:45:45] in God's timing do you believe it it
[1:45:49] will happen in God's timing just wait on
[1:45:53] him
[1:45:55] just wait see you just have to be
[1:45:58] yielded to him the prophet said Moses
[1:46:02] had to lose his intellectuals had to be
[1:46:04] a prisoner in order to find Christ
[1:46:05] brother Bram says when God got all the
[1:46:08] world beat out of him and all of his
[1:46:10] mighty man that he was and standing in
[1:46:13] the presence of that Pillar of Fire that
[1:46:15] day he found just he was found just
[1:46:17] speechless he didn't have he didn't he
[1:46:20] couldn't even talk he said see God had a
[1:46:23] prisoner then you won't try after your
[1:46:25] own searching see then God had to undo
[1:46:28] this man endow him with power enough
[1:46:30] that he could go down there and he said
[1:46:33] Lord I told Pharaoh what you said and he
[1:46:35] wouldn't do it and he says then God says
[1:46:38] take this Rod then and see thy rod see
[1:46:41] God speaking that's God's word go out
[1:46:43] there and point it towards the east and
[1:46:44] call for flies and flies come into
[1:46:46] creation because everybody say because
[1:46:49] he had a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't
[1:46:53] pay off with nothing nobody else could
[1:46:56] turn him no way he was a complete
[1:46:59] prisoner in the chains of God's word
[1:47:01] bound only bound up only everybody say
[1:47:06] only to thus saith the Lord
[1:47:10] see if God can get his prisoners like
[1:47:12] that that's when he can express the
[1:47:14] preeminances you see he's got the man or
[1:47:17] the person so that he knows nothing but
[1:47:20] Christ and Christ is the message
[1:47:23] do you believe that
[1:47:25] now you know people may think an
[1:47:28] old-fashioned to be led by the spirit
[1:47:29] but that's the kind that his church has
[1:47:32] made up
[1:47:33] that's what makes up the Church of the
[1:47:36] Living God is a people that can be led
[1:47:37] they that are sons of God are led by the
[1:47:40] spirit of God ain't that right so the
[1:47:43] Holy Spirit has always been God's agent
[1:47:45] what what else you know how else can the
[1:47:48] world be created amen God spoke it and
[1:47:52] the Holy Spirit began to brood over the
[1:47:54] Earth ain't that right to make love and
[1:47:57] things began to appear but not only God
[1:48:00] spoke his word concerning the earth and
[1:48:02] the universe he also spoke a word
[1:48:05] concerning his bride his church and the
[1:48:08] church is his body as as the prophet
[1:48:11] said it we know the quote uh uh you know
[1:48:14] she is bone of his bone life in his life
[1:48:17] flesh of his flesh power of his power
[1:48:19] she is him ain't that right see so the
[1:48:23] bride is the Church of the Living God
[1:48:24] and those whose names were written in
[1:48:26] the Lamb's Book of Life are the ones who
[1:48:28] make up this bride and everyone that is
[1:48:31] in the bride of Christ he was is in
[1:48:34] God's thinking ain't that right as we
[1:48:36] talked about that he what he thought of
[1:48:39] you is predestinated is predestinated
[1:48:42] amen uh uh what he predestinated you to
[1:48:45] be and as we said his thoughts are
[1:48:48] Eternal and they are real so what he
[1:48:51] allowed you to be is only temporary
[1:48:54] ain't that right it's only temporary so
[1:48:58] there are things about us that must
[1:49:00] change because they are not Eternal only
[1:49:03] what
[1:49:05] was in his thinking is eternal and will
[1:49:09] remain see so the world in its current
[1:49:12] condition is not going to remain our
[1:49:15] body is not going to remain the way it
[1:49:18] is now aren't you glad for that
[1:49:20] corruption is not going to remain our
[1:49:22] sicknesses is not going to remain our
[1:49:25] failures are not going to remain one of
[1:49:28] these days you're going to see it for
[1:49:29] the last time
[1:49:32] one of these days you're going to see
[1:49:34] yourself the way you are right now for
[1:49:37] the last time
[1:49:39] you believe it
[1:49:41] I believe it's any day now
[1:49:43] ain't that right for God's Eternal
[1:49:46] thoughts shall reveal uh prevail
[1:49:48] so what is what is the word of God it's
[1:49:51] not a Creed or Dogma as we know it's not
[1:49:54] a theology it's not your thinking the
[1:49:57] word of God is God's thoughts expressed
[1:50:00] ain't that right so then to be an
[1:50:03] expression of God's thinking you must
[1:50:05] become the word
[1:50:06] everybody say I must become the word
[1:50:09] amen you know we talked about it God is
[1:50:12] preparing his people you've got to be
[1:50:14] the prophet said a real word bride
[1:50:19] a real word bride brother Branham and
[1:50:22] speaking of the city now prepared he
[1:50:23] says the Heavenly beings who have
[1:50:25] prepared her watch breathlessly for she
[1:50:28] glistens and shines with the glory that
[1:50:31] is unearthly every facet of her beauty
[1:50:34] tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus
[1:50:38] love she is a prepared City for a
[1:50:40] prepared people she only awaits she
[1:50:43] awaits only for her inhabitants and soon
[1:50:45] they will thrown her streets with joy so
[1:50:49] can you become the word
[1:50:51] if you're in his thinking amen amen you
[1:50:54] can become every bit of the word why
[1:50:57] because brother Branham said it's
[1:50:58] through his holy blood that we have
[1:51:00] access to life and our sexual blood is
[1:51:03] dismissed
[1:51:06] don't cry over your Hang-Ups
[1:51:11] look at what you are becoming the word
[1:51:15] God gave you the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:18] Ghost showing that he's approved your
[1:51:19] faith
[1:51:20] showing that he your confession your
[1:51:22] repentance was true
[1:51:24] ain't that right
[1:51:25] and at that time he dismissed
[1:51:29] your sexual blood
[1:51:34] so we have the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:35] that stands for an atonement make an
[1:51:37] atonement for our sins
[1:51:39] brother Brandon says Jesus the word took
[1:51:42] my place he become me that a sinner see
[1:51:44] that I might become him the word let me
[1:51:48] hold true to it not the church the word
[1:51:51] oh that spiritual union of Christ and
[1:51:54] his church now when the flesh is
[1:51:56] becoming the word and the word is
[1:51:59] becoming flesh manifested and Vindicated
[1:52:03] just what the Bible said would happen in
[1:52:05] this day it's happening day by day why
[1:52:08] it's accumulating so fast out there in
[1:52:11] those deserts and things taking place
[1:52:13] that I couldn't even keep up with it
[1:52:15] we're nearing the coming of Jesus to be
[1:52:18] United with his church where the word
[1:52:21] becomes the word
[1:52:24] becomes the word
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:29] written Epistles read a known of all men
[1:52:34] this Bible's already spoke of you
[1:52:36] you can become the word
[1:52:40] you love him
[1:52:43] see something in you is calling for it
[1:52:46] David described it as the Deep calling
[1:52:49] unto the Deep
[1:52:50] it calls to live
[1:52:52] amen it calls to do right ain't that
[1:52:55] right
[1:52:56] notice I believe it's in
[1:52:58] um well I can't I can't remember the the
[1:53:01] certain things that are to be then God
[1:53:03] will call somebody on the platform or
[1:53:06] the pulpit that will preach the absolute
[1:53:08] truth
[1:53:09] why see it shows you then if you're a
[1:53:12] real child of God you begin to cry out
[1:53:14] God take it away from me circumcise me
[1:53:17] from this take these things away from me
[1:53:20] why it's needed everybody say it's
[1:53:22] needed for your heavenly home
[1:53:24] that you're going to where he's gone on
[1:53:27] to prepare
[1:53:28] another place it was God's purpose to
[1:53:31] bring forth a people like unto himself
[1:53:33] that would be a word bride she was
[1:53:36] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:53:38] world in him she was foreknown and
[1:53:41] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:53:44] forth during these ages upon the Earth
[1:53:46] she was Redeemed by his blood and can
[1:53:50] never come into condemnation she could
[1:53:52] never be in the Judgment because sin
[1:53:55] cannot everybody say it cannot be
[1:53:57] imputed unto her exactly right so this
[1:54:02] is the age
[1:54:06] to bring back the word
[1:54:09] this is the age to bring back the word
[1:54:13] amen you love him
[1:54:16] give me just another five minutes
[1:54:18] Hebrews 12 25 see that you refuse him
[1:54:21] not you realize this is prophetic of
[1:54:24] this age
[1:54:25] see that you refuse him not let's
[1:54:27] speaketh for if they escape not who
[1:54:29] refused him that spake on Earth how much
[1:54:31] more shall we not escape from him that
[1:54:34] speaketh from heaven whose voice then
[1:54:36] shook the Earth but now he has promised
[1:54:38] saying yet once more I shake not the
[1:54:40] Earth only but also the heaven him and
[1:54:43] this word yet once more signified the
[1:54:45] removing
[1:54:46] now this ought to excite us the removing
[1:54:49] of those things that are shaken as the
[1:54:52] things that are made that those things
[1:54:54] which cannot be shaken May remain
[1:54:57] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[1:54:59] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[1:55:01] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:55:04] reverence and godly fear ain't that
[1:55:06] right so everything that can be shaken
[1:55:09] will be shaken and we'll be done away
[1:55:12] with but everything that cannot be
[1:55:14] shaken will remain
[1:55:17] why why is that happening in this state
[1:55:19] because it's time for the word to come
[1:55:21] it's time for a word bride to come
[1:55:24] it's time for a word Kingdom to come
[1:55:26] it's time for a word Eden to come back
[1:55:29] it's time that everything that God had
[1:55:32] in the beginning by his word would be
[1:55:35] restored back and it'll take the word to
[1:55:37] restore you
[1:55:39] do you believe it for heaven and Earth
[1:55:41] shall pass away but my word shall never
[1:55:43] pass away let God's word be true in
[1:55:45] every man a lie ain't that right notice
[1:55:49] Isaiah 40 and 6 All Flesh is grass and
[1:55:52] all the goodness thereof is as the
[1:55:54] flower of the field the grass withereth
[1:55:56] the flower fadeth because the spirit of
[1:55:58] the Lord bloweth upon it
[1:56:02] ain't that amazing
[1:56:04] the spirit of the Lord bleweth upon it
[1:56:07] surely the grass is people
[1:56:09] the grass withereth the flower fadeth
[1:56:11] but the word of the Lord of our the word
[1:56:13] of our God shall stand forever
[1:56:15] so what's going to remain the word shall
[1:56:17] remain
[1:56:18] that which remain cannot be shaken shall
[1:56:21] remain and what is it the word
[1:56:24] they which are alive and remain
[1:56:27] shall be caught up
[1:56:29] what is it it's a word people
[1:56:31] that are still standing through all the
[1:56:34] shake and through all the deception
[1:56:36] through everything that they go through
[1:56:37] the word will remain the trials are only
[1:56:41] to take that which is temporal away from
[1:56:43] you to take the doubt away from you to
[1:56:45] take the criticism away from you to take
[1:56:48] the unbelief away everything that is not
[1:56:50] of God to take it away from you that you
[1:56:53] may remain as the word
[1:56:55] [Music]
[1:56:57] you believe it
[1:57:00] it was in this day that a prophet stood
[1:57:02] and said House of hell
[1:57:04] give way
[1:57:05] to the name of Jesus
[1:57:07] that which can be shaken
[1:57:11] will be done away with
[1:57:13] and the prophet said all the creaking
[1:57:15] and the popping
[1:57:17] and the rocks are rolling and the bars
[1:57:20] have fallen
[1:57:21] why because that which can be shaken
[1:57:24] will be shaken are you with me now the
[1:57:27] other things that have held Japan is
[1:57:29] shaking
[1:57:33] and people running and screaming
[1:57:35] delivered and screaming at the top of
[1:57:37] their voice and all
[1:57:40] all was delivered
[1:57:42] can you say Amen is this all right
[1:57:46] notice the prophet said they'll say
[1:57:48] Odyssey in church ages the grandest of
[1:57:49] all Church ages because it's the ending
[1:57:51] of time
[1:57:52] and the blending of Eternity you're
[1:57:55] standing at the blending
[1:58:01] what's making it happen your faith
[1:58:04] in all of God's word
[1:58:06] your faith in all of God's word
[1:58:11] we flew to New Zealand
[1:58:14] a few years back
[1:58:16] and we actually got to a place
[1:58:19] somewhere in the air
[1:58:22] that you can look out one window and it
[1:58:24] was all bright
[1:58:26] you can look it out the other window it
[1:58:28] was all dark
[1:58:30] we were right there
[1:58:34] church if you could only see where
[1:58:36] you're at
[1:58:38] darkness is here
[1:58:40] it's gross Darkness
[1:58:42] and there's a people there
[1:58:44] that girl's Darkness has covered them
[1:58:47] but if you look
[1:58:49] the fruits was bright
[1:58:52] and what got you there
[1:58:54] is God is bringing us over now
[1:58:57] there's people that cannot come over but
[1:58:59] you're coming and you're stepping in
[1:59:00] more into eternity one by one day by day
[1:59:03] Moment by moment
[1:59:05] do you believe it the transformation is
[1:59:08] actually taking place it's brought you
[1:59:10] to a place that you can see both dark
[1:59:12] and Light
[1:59:14] at the same time
[1:59:16] can you say Amen you love him what is it
[1:59:19] it's the ending of worldly kingdoms and
[1:59:22] the ushering end of Eternal Kingdom
[1:59:24] it's the ending of Satan's Eden and the
[1:59:27] restoration of God's Eden
[1:59:29] so we can understand as to why the
[1:59:32] change is happening we can understand
[1:59:33] why the turmoil and all these things are
[1:59:36] happening in the in the earth it's not
[1:59:39] to our detriment
[1:59:42] uh
[1:59:43] the laws that are being passed is not to
[1:59:46] our detriment the chaos that is
[1:59:50] happening is not to your detriment the
[1:59:53] pressure that you're feeling is not to
[1:59:55] your detriment can you say Amen but
[1:59:58] rather for our benefit because
[2:00:01] corruption is changing from to
[2:00:03] incorruption
[2:00:06] uncleanliness is changing to Holiness
[2:00:08] the Earthly things are changing to
[2:00:11] Heavenly things the carnal mind is being
[2:00:14] changed to the mind of Christ
[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:18] why the trumpet of Jubilee has sounded
[2:00:21] do you believe it do you believe that
[2:00:24] this message is the trumpet of Jubilee
[2:00:26] it's the trumpet of Jubilee and if you
[2:00:28] can believe it you can walk away and be
[2:00:31] free and everything that has been been
[2:00:34] binding you is only to be shaken by The
[2:00:37] Voice
[2:00:40] be shaken by The Voice
[2:00:42] to where you can walk away free
[2:00:46] and be transformed
[2:00:48] by the renewing of your mind
[2:00:51] oh do you love him the Prophet Daniel
[2:00:54] said in every one that shall be found
[2:00:56] written in the book
[2:00:58] shall be delivered
[2:01:00] can you say Amen
[2:01:02] we all know the the prophecy of
[2:01:05] ezekiel's dry bones their valley of dry
[2:01:08] bones Ezekiel 37 1-10 I won't read it
[2:01:12] but but you know the prophet gave the
[2:01:15] stages Lutheran age and Wesley and
[2:01:17] Pentecostal but it would be in this time
[2:01:21] that God would Breathe
[2:01:23] God would Breathe the breath of life
[2:01:27] and that the the winds yes they're
[2:01:31] blowing that which can wither
[2:01:33] they're blowing that which can fade that
[2:01:35] wind of God is blowing
[2:01:37] but upon the people of God that elect
[2:01:40] its breathing Breath of Life into them
[2:01:43] it's quickening I thank God for the
[2:01:46] ministry of the prophet of this age
[2:01:49] I thank God that God has allowed us to
[2:01:52] hear the voice
[2:01:53] amen and not us be shaken but everything
[2:01:56] about us that has been temporary is now
[2:01:59] being shaken away from us and we can
[2:02:01] lift up holy hands we can lift amen of
[2:02:04] holy hands and worship and there's no
[2:02:07] doubt in our heart it's been shaken away
[2:02:09] it's been removed amen the traditions of
[2:02:11] man that has held us have been removed
[2:02:13] amen everything is being removed and
[2:02:16] we're being restored back to a word
[2:02:18] bride what he thought in his mind by the
[2:02:22] ministry of a prophet in this age
[2:02:25] do you love him
[2:02:27] it's the word bride living again
[2:02:29] nothing nothing nothing has been able to
[2:02:32] make the word live
[2:02:34] amen the prophet said see he died so he
[2:02:36] could come himself into that word he is
[2:02:39] the quickening life that makes that word
[2:02:41] live again that was his purpose of dying
[2:02:44] that he could still project himself
[2:02:46] through his church and make every word
[2:02:49] through every age at just exactly the
[2:02:53] way it's supposed to act
[2:02:55] can you say Amen in our natural birth we
[2:02:58] were just like everyone else sinful men
[2:03:01] and women and and many of us and and I'm
[2:03:04] going to close but many of us were
[2:03:06] caught in the snare of religion
[2:03:08] the and the Harlot her daughters
[2:03:11] prostitute daughters but it's the grace
[2:03:14] of God that we've gotten out of it
[2:03:17] you you look at Revelations the 13th
[2:03:20] chapter the third verse through fourth
[2:03:22] it says I saw one of his heads as it
[2:03:24] were wounded to death and his deadly
[2:03:27] wound was healed and all everybody say
[2:03:29] all the world wandered after the Beast
[2:03:35] and they worshiped the dragon which gave
[2:03:39] power unto the Beast and they worshiped
[2:03:42] the Beast saying who is likened to the
[2:03:45] Beast not who is likened to the Lord Our
[2:03:47] God but who is likened to the Beast who
[2:03:51] is able to make war with him you realize
[2:03:54] that we should have been in that number
[2:03:56] all the world we should have been one of
[2:04:00] them that wanders after the beast but
[2:04:02] we're not
[2:04:05] Revelations 13 8 tells us who this is
[2:04:08] that worships the beasts all that dwell
[2:04:10] upon the Earth shall worship Him whose
[2:04:13] names are not written in the Book of
[2:04:16] Life of the lamb slain from the
[2:04:18] foundation of the world those whose
[2:04:21] names are not written in that Lamb's
[2:04:23] Book of Life One Day somehow someway are
[2:04:28] going to follow
[2:04:30] and worship the Beast
[2:04:33] they've already taken on his name
[2:04:38] can you say man
[2:04:40] but it's the grace of God that we're not
[2:04:42] caught in that system
[2:04:44] yeah
[2:04:45] and you say Amen
[2:04:47] and God determined to deliver us ain't
[2:04:51] that right
[2:04:52] if the musicians will come
[2:04:55] Revelations 18 3 all nations All Nations
[2:05:00] think of it all nations have drunk of
[2:05:03] the wine of the wrath of her fornication
[2:05:05] and the kings of the Earth have
[2:05:07] committed fornication with her and the
[2:05:09] merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich
[2:05:11] through the abundance of her Delicacies

[2:09:19] God an attribute a Son of God then the
[2:09:22] word of God is sown in you

[2:09:37] Earth by Prophets
[2:09:39] how does God bring you the bride upon
[2:09:42] the Earth by prophet

[2:10:05] ordained us for it we were the names
[2:10:07] written in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[2:10:09] just had to identify us now he said a
[2:10:12] prophet and out of that prophet's
[2:10:14] message here comes a bride rising up
[2:10:16] hallelujah hallelujah now we're not
[2:10:19] identified as church members churchgoers
[2:10:21] we are identified with him as the word
[2:10:25] bride and the prophet would stand on the
[2:10:27] earth and say now you are Miss Jesus

[2:10:32] misdenomination not miss Pentecost not
[2:10:35] miss Baptist but miss Jesus Christ we
