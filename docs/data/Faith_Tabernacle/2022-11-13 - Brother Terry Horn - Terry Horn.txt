appreciate the Lord we're good glad to be here and love the Lord thank God for he sent us a message here to shed the light on the word for this hour good morning to you class brother Joe told me Wednesday night I said I'm going to be looking for I'll be ready for class Sunday morning so I'm just the substitute teacher you know the Holy Ghost is a teacher so I'm just a substitute but we want to look into a different subject but and and and talking about and studying this subject we're going to look into actually uh uh maybe for the younger generation of people who may not really understand what happened back then which is going to explain in detail but um it will actually answer help answer a couple of questions that we'll try to answer at the end of of the lesson this morning and it'll help us to understand even in Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the of the of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers and you know in the because the Pentecost was the last Revival that always wants to lap over into the present Revival which is a word Revival and so understanding that and it'll actually will answer a couple of questions so we're going to talk about this miracle and we're going to sort of turn to Luke 24 49 and most of you know where we're going with that but this miracle we're going to talk about is not just any Miracle uh it's not just Miracles but it's a very somewhat of elusive Miracle to Christianity in general it's mostly misunderstood by the Pentecostal people because they take a couple of words in there and and they actually apply a different meaning to it because they don't really understand what really happened during that time but to understand this miracle to help us understand some of the focuses today so we're going to talk about this miracle and we'll read it and we'll explain it and the Lord will help us we're going to have church this morning enjoy it the Lord bless you okay Luke 24 49. and very short scripture very simple Jesus speaking and behold I sin the promise is one of the last words Jesus spoke before he ascended behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now of course this is Jesus as I said speaking and now he's speaking to us 11 plus the others that was with him before he ascended and at this point the disciples didn't know have a clue what they were going to receive what they were going to experience he just said go up to the city of Jerusalem and tarry wait and they didn't know but it would be a very very great miracle so we're gonna look about this I want to call it the miracle of Pentecost but not just to look at what happened at Pentecost which a lot of people really really don't know unless they've studied it out the details of what happened it's very important to details because in the details it really explains some some misunderstandings so we want to look into that this morning so if your bar has let's pray Lord Jesus we're thankful Lord to be here we're thankful Lord to be have this understanding dear Gods you've given us we thank you that you sent us a prophet a word Messenger to give us Enlightenment of the word for this hour we so appreciate that with all of our heart Lord where would we be we would be deceived like laodicea but Lord because we're not part of laodicea we've been called out of that and we're so thankful and we appreciate it Lord speak to us through your word hide me behind the cross Lord and this little teaching that we have this morning may it be a help and a blessing and and uh be fruitful Lord that we might have a little bit better understand ending and gain more a little bit more insight Lord and and weapons read the fight the enemy God may you grant it we ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus and everybody says amen you can be seated God bless you amen our visitors and each one that's here now I'm going to take my I don't like it amen speaking on this miracle at Pentecost it's really one of the most misunderstood subjects in the Bible and uh really the church was birthed on the day of Pentecost and most a lot of people just don't really understand what really happened on the day of Pentecost the miracle of Pentecost now I'm going to read a lot of quotes and the reason especially at the beginning because brother bam goes through this especially on the question answers on the on the Holy Ghost and he tells in details that there's three or four details in there that it's really really not known that really needs to be known that really helps us understand really really what happened so everybody ready Amen brother them said he said now Pentecost after they had walked with the word after they had seen the word Christ after they believed the word Christ but before they could see the miracle of Pentecost they had to obey the word see go up to the city Jerusalem said the word and wait there until you've been dude with power now there's a sermon all within that just that verse there or that quote there and he goes on to say and brothers going to kind of dramatize this a little bit he said I can hear Peter say you know something tells me that it is just it right there in the upper room now it is it right that ain't just exactly obeying the word see if we expect to see the miracle they've been there a couple of days now he's dramatizing said if we expect to see the miracle that God promised up of sending this a promise of the father upon us we've got to wait here until something happens and then he continues to say brethren uh you know stealing this little drama we couldn't walk out of here like that without even seeing any experience at all see we've got to have something because he said wait here until you be endued with power now I haven't got it now Peter speaking I haven't got any more power than I did when I come I've been here all night I've been here the next night I've been here nine nights I'm just the same I was when I come here and he told us we would receive power so let's just keep waiting another place where the man says then all of a sudden when the they and I like this he said then all of a sudden when they fully obeyed the word then they saw the miracle of Pentecost they saw the fire falling to build him the pillar of fire came down amongst the People Big licks of fire Cleveland tongue set upon each of them now even in this what we've covered so far I'd say probably the very first principle and the most important principle and that is to obey the word fully obey when they as he said when they fully obeyed that's when the miracle happened that's when God's blessing happened when they fully obeyed the word of God and as the Bible teaches us in the book of Acts God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey so it it really boils down first of all first the most important principle is to fully obey the word of God so we find that to be true now in understanding what really happened on this day uh we'll find out really at first now the Azusa Street Pentecostal Revival 1906 it really had little resemblance of really what happened on the day of Pentecost now also the Pentecost Revival brother man said won't mix with this now this is a word Revival it's all together different from the last Revival the Pentecostal Revival we we know these things but you're going to see this is going to be helpful as we get especially down to them but as we go through this I want you to get a mental picture as you picture what really happened as they were going through this you know as the Bible condenses uh it's it's verses and so forth it doesn't tell in detail it just condenses his word so I want you to try to get a mental picture as we go through this and brother M said now and the rapture What mo what if Moses would have come and brought Noah's message we'll build art float down and out it would not have worked and neither would Jesus message have worked of Moses neither will Wesley's message even work in Luther and so forth and vice versa and today we our last Reformation was Pentecost and today we're moving from that and the Pentecostal message won't work with this this because this is another day it's all God's word but it's building like the feet arms coming up it's forming a bride for the Rapture and hold that feet arms coming up we'll get to that in a minute now Jesus told them to tarry and wait until they're being dude with power now as president goes on to say he says now notice Jesus had commissioned him to go into up at Jerusalem and await the word Terry means wait he said it don't doesn't mean pray it means to wait they was not fit subjects now remember there was 11's with him as well as the other it was 120 all in total but the 11 disciples were with him um uh he said they was not fit subjects to preach because they only knew his resurrection by his person now that's that's very interesting important because even Jesus speaking to Peter and he asked him who do you say that I am and we we know that he said Flesh and Blood did not reveal this you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this and Upon This Rock I'll build my church it's a spiritual revelation of who Christ is that's the Capstone Revelation the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ but you don't find him and you don't know him they didn't know him just by walking with him and fishing with him and and even seeing his miracles and so forth they didn't know God by his person it came by revelation and it always come by racism Paul Paul didn't see the person but he got the revelation same same thing amen he commanded them not to preach anymore or do nothing until they first had been endued with power from on high now if God would not let them preach until they went to Pentecost and received the Pentecostal experience no man unless some deep desire of his own or some organization has commissioned him has a right to enter the pulpit until he has been filled with the Holy Ghost that's exactly right and we can all say Amen to that how can how can he be a spiritual leader if he don't have the spirit within him amen now you know it's like the Pharisees they they knew the the the Miracles of Moses but they didn't know the god of Moses they could read all about him you know in the law but they didn't know the god of Moses now the first instructions were to wait and I it's difficult to wait well the hardest thing for people to do his way so it's just a way I mean especially uh patience is a is almost a bygone thing but they told him to wait now we know Eve wrote that first example she just couldn't wait and brother bam said but now there are 120 up there both being in a weapon in this upper room now let's notice something really kind of different about this upper room as we begin to kind of break this down the prophet God said the origin of the Oriental country seldom had stairway inside the stairway was outside now begin to get this mental picture what happened in the upper room one day of Pentecost the stairway was on the outside outside the temple we were told there was a Stairway that led up to a little room way up go up up up until you get to a little room up there like a storage room on top of the temple some kind of a little room Upper Room the Bible said they were in there and the doors were shut because they were afraid of the Jews they were afraid of the Jews they were afraid of the Jews that's the reason they closed the door probably barred them and locked them he goes on to say there they hid themselves because they're afraid of the Jews Jesus didn't tell them go to the upper room he just said wait in Jerusalem now if they were down here in the house say on the first floor somewhere hard to tell what would take place they'd come in and get them so they went into a little old room in the upstairs way up there in the attic and there barred the room down so the Jews couldn't get to them and they sat there waiting for 10 days quite a different picture and he says now all right we'll go to Acts 2 now and start reading a little bit Acts 2 and 1. and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues now the of course the King James says Club in tongues but the original Greek emphatic dialogue says divided tongues and we'll speak a little bit more of that in a minute clothing tongues are divided tons like of a fire like as a fire and it's sat upon them or the original says rested on them each one of them so first we have now we have the sound from heaven and then they're appeared unto them these cloven tongues like as a fire and then it rested on each one of them okay now what happens next and Acts 2 and 4 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now this Acts 2 and 4 the Brotherhood goes to his early Ministry you know talked about the Pentecostals and the one that's in the UPC and all I mean they just quote Acts 2 and 4 Mishawaka Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2 and 4. now this is really the the Clincher you might say the most misunderstood verses of these scriptures and because the way it's worked as I said the Bible condenses its the scriptures and it doesn't say it it doesn't give the specific details as of time spans lapse between uh secrets of Advance is this a sequential of men or did something else happen in between this see there's lots of there's lots of variables in there that's why you know it takes especially a higher day word Prophet to tell us what these things happen and we're thankful that a word Prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word we're just we're just blessed to have that amen okay and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now watch the prophet of God brother man says these tongues were like these tongues were in the room like fire and it said on each they were filled with the Holy Ghost second thing and then after they were filled with the Holy Ghost notice after they were filled with the Holy Ghost after they were filled with the Holy Ghost they spake with tongues and then Brothers says not with tongues with languages did you notice that they began to speak with other languages now as the spirit gave them utter now and this was noise abroad now of course I have a copy of the dialogue another man said ever a preacher ought to have a dialogue because this is really this is New Testament and this is actual Greek word for word of course now we don't read Greek but they actually put it in the flowing language so we could understand it but it's not an interpretation it's it's just actually word by word what was said so the actual original rendering as I spoke in other languages now it's not incorrect it's not the King James is not incorrect but it doesn't give you a real clear understanding because of the way it's been interpreted down through the Pentecostal Revival they spoke in tongues instead of languages okay so as we begin to see some things here oh unfolding they speak they began to speak with other languages as the spirit gave them to uttering now this now this was noised abroad okay they speak they were filled the Holy Ghost and then it says you know and then they began to speak with other tongues and the spirit gave upris it says and this was noisy brought now it sounds like this just happened boom boom boom just like that but we find out that's really not actually what happened this this is just I mean I've known this for a time but studying out I just I was so glad that I studied out to really see and understand and and to be able to bring it to all of us really what happened now we don't have a lot of these issues in the message because tongues interpretation getting people giving tongues interpretation you know during service or you know even in order because I know people don't like to hear this but that's not the season and it's not the season for because let's face it there are like Brother band was a discipline sanctions he believed in changing the dispensations I mean God with this has a pillar fire above us uh God uh above us rather the pillar fire God With Us Jesus Christ God in us the Holy Spirit the last 2000 years so and and like the healing Revival the healing Revival we still believe in Divine Healing but this is not this season of the healing Revival it's actually changed after the opening of the seals it's changed with dispensation God don't deal with them organizations anymore as a whole but he deals with the bride he called the bride out that's where he's dealing so we we understand that God uh changes discipline say there are seasons so and president said just putting this in him he said anyone that speaks with the unknown tongue now see this is where the Pentecostals come from anyone speaks with an unknown tongue upon receiving the Holy Ghost does it contrary to the Bible it's not unknown known they knew what they were saying as we'll get to I'm going to show you in a few minutes and I'll prove to you I believe in speaking in unknown tongues but not receiving the Holy Ghost that's a gift of the Holy Ghost now in Acts 2 and 5. now look at let's look at verse 5. and there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men out of ever Nation Under heaven now we begin to understand a little bit of the explanation now let's look at verse 6. this one's I really really like verse six this is very very interesting to me just tremendous now when this was noised abroad first of all we asked what was noise abroad number what was okay we had a mighty Russian wind a sound from Heaven as a mighty Russian Pillar of Fire came down broke itself up in the licks of fire then they were filled with the Holy Ghost then it says and then they this was noisy bro now what was noised abroad now that's the question now the Bible does it say it does not explicitly say what was noise abroad we didn't know that what the prophet of God does know I love it and this and when this was noise abroad the multitude came together now they were they were not assembled together before this happened said but after this was noise abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in their own language so something stirred something happened and the multitude gathered together now what stirred them what what what brought this multitude together and this is just really really important when and and the question is this is really an important verse when when was this noise abroad now the big question is what was noise abroad and what were they saying now after this was noise umbrella then the multitude came together now I'm going to read verse 6 out of the dag law now you I want you I guess they'll have it on the board in the um but in the King James as we just read it now when this was noise abroad the multitude came together and we're confounded because that every man heard them speak in their own language but notice the way it's actually in the original Greek it's the same understanding just much clearer it says verse 6 and this report having been circulated that's the original wording and this report having been circulated the multitude came together and were perplexed because every one heard them speaking in their own language and when this report having been circulated so they were in the upper room filled with the Holy Ghost fire came they saw the fire licks if I arrested on each one of them fill the Holy Ghost then they begin to speak in other tongues language but we want to find out when did this happen before we get to that only a prophet could tell us what did they say what if I what did they say brother man says the question answers now I want to ask you something when was this rumor started remember after this was noise abroad okay he says when was this rumor started they called it a rumor you know if they had to come out of the upper room and go down them steps and get out into the palace course or into the temple courts rather which was probably a city block from where they were at upstairs and down out into the courts where all the people were gathered together and when they come out of their drunken like on the spirit for the people said these men are full of full of new wine they've never seen anything like it now in this get this picture okay they're coming out of the upper room they come down this stairwell from the outside and they begin to I guess mingle if you will because it has drawn a crowd of people we want to well what were they saying brother that tells us what they're saying and each one was trying to say the Holy Spirit has come the promise of God has come upon me I've been filled with the spirit so you can imagine how these guys These Guys these brothers and sisters 120 in the upper room how they were so excited because he said go you up in the city of Jerusalem and Terry and tell you being dude with power they didn't know what he was really talking about what is this power that they're supposed to receive so now they receive the Holy Ghost they come out of the upper room and they're now what are they doing they're actually testifying of what actually happened in the upper room because they said look I've been I've seen I've received the Holy Ghost I've been filled with the Holy Ghost I've been endued with power the Holy Ghost has come upon me of the Holy Ghost has come in me uh the promise of God is upon me I've been filled with this spirit can you imagine how they felt that time no wonder they acted like they acted you can understand why they acted the way they did this was a this was a brand new transformation they didn't know anything about about this this was the the first time ever that God had taken up resonance in the human heart before as we just said it was God above us and it was God With Us when Jesus Christ walked the streets of Galilee and so forth but now it's that same God that same fire that same Holy Ghost which was a pillar fire broke up in licks of fire which was anointing of God the life of God the presence of God the very God himself that same God has now taken up resonance in the human heart the first time ever no wonder they was excited about it no wonder they was and and and and the multitudes they were perplexed because they didn't they never seen anybody act like that now I don't know you know it's not for me to to decide if they were just you know staggering around like a drunk man you know and you know just like like they just you know I don't know it doesn't really matter but one thing for sure we know this because it was such an unusual thing that happened to them just if they were just running up to somebody brother this is what happened to me this is what happened to me God gave us the Holy Ghost the spirit of God is to come upon me you would act strange just doing that much of it you know so it doesn't really matter what if they were drunk or staggering or just so excited about what happened they thought it was drunk that's that's what they thought because we never seen anything like this that's that's one thing for sure they were they were trying to express and tell everyone you know just what they experienced and what did they experience they actually experienced the nature change they got a change of nature they were now filled with the Holy Ghost now that that same power that uh that that same power that they were to receive was a neighborhood a nature change and they went up into the upper room and waited there for 10 days and shut the door because they were afraid of the Jews they came out of the upper room with a brand new power a new nature a new revelation a new realization that the the spirit that the spirit of that same man Jesus Christ that they crucified is now living inside of my soul it was a change it was a nature change it was a a real experience brother it had nothing to do with emotion it had nothing to do with Sensations had nothing to do with any of these uh of feelings and and and and vocalists vocal sensation or anything is we'll get to if you had nothing to do with that it was a total nature change something they'd never experienced before amen that's no wonder they act as strange amen and brother man said you will too when you get a nature change don't if you could take the nature of a of a of a lamb and put it into a pig he's gonna act different too if he changes nature when you we get a nature change we do act different that's why because we're a brand new creation we're all together new different yeah now again don't miss these happenings first sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind And probably this that sound from heaven like a Russian might even probably was the same sound that brother remember you know he had dramatized many times when that pillar fire would would whirl around him and he did blow on the microphone like that probably the same cell same Pillar of Fire Flame Holy Ghost and there appeared into them divided tongues like unto fire notice what brother M says again he says didn't it uh did anyone out here ever see Cecil the Mill's Ten Commandments did you notice the Commandments when they're written he caught that I did know there was two or three things I seen that I really like first thing it was that Emerald light that yellow green light that's exactly what it looked like and another thing was the command was written and after it was over did you notice flying away from that big pillar fire there was little Elixir fire flying away did you notice that now that's what I think this was at Pentecost there appeared unto them so they could so so they could see it it didn't say it fell on them but it appeared unto them and it rested upon them they actually saw those little licks of Fire how long ago is breaking up they actually saw those licks of fire and it sat upon each one of them rested on each one of them they was all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other languages that the spirit gave utterance now now let's look this yeah Acts 2 and 4 again when they were spilled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues that the spirit gave utterance now I want to ask you a question how much time you think elapsed between the time that they were filled with the Holy Ghost and the time that they began to speak with other languages immediately five minutes ten minutes half hour how much time the Bible doesn't say but the prophet of God tells us not in minutes but he gives us a little understanding now he goes on to say here and I listen I really like this next quote this is this is very very good to the understanding very essential now listen let me read here before the question of the next coming brother I'm actually I'm going to read this he actually reads it out of this book lexicon it's actually a footnote and I'm going to read the footnote that he actually reads and question answers on the Holy Ghost and the footnote is it says it is difficult to determine whether it was the voice of those people speaking in a foreign language or the reporter rumor of the transaction of the supernatural wind rushing that excited the crowd now we don't know which one it was but they couldn't understand it now watch whether the brother man says whether it was the people I'll just illustrate now here's illustrating what happened here's a bunch of poor ragged galileans 120 of them okay and they were all out there in the street now they come out of the upper room they never seen anything like it their hands up in the air come from that upper room down the steps out into there just filled and he goes on to say they had never spoke yet I wish I had up on the screen so you could see it I mean he's either they come out of the upper room so I'm asking how much time was elapsed not important how much time was elapsing minutes but you have to understand and separate the sequence of what happens they were filled with the Holy Ghost up there they came out of the upper room then something was known as broad with it was the wind or the or what they were testifying about that Drew the crowd and they said after they came out of that room then they began to speak in other languages he said they come down the steps out into there just filled never had spoke yet see here they come down through there and now let's just say they was out there stagging around this and the people said a Greek Runner run up to me say I speak you gotta land you know what I'm saying now what's the matter with you boy but I like the way he you know he uh dramatizes that he said I've been filled with the Holy Ghost the power of God has felt up there in the upper room something happened to me oh glory to God and one over here and he was talking in Arab and him a Galilean said up in Arab in Arab language now they can't tell was it the Russian wind that drawed the people together when the multitude come together or was it the speaking in the foreign language that they were speaking now the Bible doesn't exactly say he said you've got two things here to watch The Outsider said how is it that we hear every man in our own language we're in we were born it did not say they were speaking it they didn't say that 120 were speaking it they just said we are hearing it but they were hearing it now you believe like I believe I believe what the prophet of God said so we understand that they come out of the upper room then they begin to speak another tongues or other languages as they come out testifying as we just read the quote before testifying what God had done in the upper room change their nature given them the Holy Spirit Christ now dwelling in the heart of human beings so we find out now that they never spoke other languages in the room but after they come outside they came outside all speaking Galilee and testifying of what they had just experienced inside now they were 17 different dialects we call up different nations represented there all 120 Believers speaking the same gotta Lynn the Apostle the disciples and then the others that went up there Mary was with them also men and women now they wasn't preaching because there's women up there they were testifying they were testifying of what God had just done as I said they weren't preaching this testified and they were testified of the works of God now it read it it's right there in the Bible let's look at Acts 2 and 9. parthians and put it on the board parthians and medes and elamites and the Dwellers of Mesopotamia and Judea and Cappadocia and Pontius and Asia and frigia and and pamphilia in Egypt and all the parts of Libya about Cyrene and strangers of Rome Jews and proselytes I love this leavened verse cretes and Arabians we do hear them speak in our own talk now what did they hear the wonderful works of God the wonderful works of God now he's telling them what what were they hearing they were the the 120 was testify of what happened up there which was the wonderful works of God which you shall be endowed with power and we'll get to the second one what is this power but he said you're going to be in new power and he and and as we read the quote brother man said they're not those 11 disciples were not fit to preach until they received this power I mean look at Peter before Pentecost look at Peter after Pentecost a different man changed all together changed oh it's a beautiful picture 17 different languages Representatives 17 different and they were understanding perfectly them speaking Galilean there's your Miracle of Pentecost there's your Miracle of Pentecost they were speaking Galilean and every one of them was understanding in in medes and Persians and Mesopotamian all the different nations represented under the known world at times they were here to him speak in Galilean but understanding in their lone language a miracle that's the miracle of Pentecost A great miracle one of the greatest Miracles that's ever happened and acts in Acts 2 and 7 and they were all amazed and marveled and you can see why they marveled saying behold are not all of these 120 or not all these galileans and how is it we understand I'm from I'm from Mesopotamia I'm from Crete I'm from here there in Yonder but I'm not of Galilean but from my native language I'm understanding what they're saying uh A great miracle A great miracle brother man says he says now how here we ever met our own language we're in we were born how here we not an unknown tongue how here we every man and the tongue where we were born not all of these were speaking are not all these speaking galileans um and was perhaps speaking Galilean but when they heard it it was in a language that they were born in if any brothers going to ask the question now if not so I want to ask you a question how and this is really I never really thought about this a lot myself okay Peter gets up after that and preaches his sermon and brother man says how was it that Peter got up and spoke in Galilean and a whole bunch heard what he was saying three thousand Souls came to Christ right there and Peter's speaking in one language sure it was God performing a miracle like I said part of that 3000 was saved from different places from around the world all speaking a different language but they were all understanding Galilean uh oh what what a beautiful beautiful picture it wasn't speaking in an unknown tongue it was speaking in a it was speaking in a unknown language which Galilean would have been unknown to the the uh the creatures in the different languages but God miraculously made it he was their interpreter it was I would say this probably the the the only great Mass interpretation that ever took place around the world at one time 17 different dialects uh you know the 3000 was saved on the you know on that same date and they all heard him speak one language 17 different languages there that was you talk about a a a a mass interpretation amen now when I say that you know what I'm talking about like when when we go to preach and we go down to uh wherever we go you know like if we go down to uh you know if I would make a sentence you know in English and brother remember like in brown boat and Bombay you know I'd have 10 or 12 different dialects and he'd speak you know a phrase in English and then the first one we he would uh uh interpret it in one dialect and the next one would interpreting it in his dialect and go right on down you know it take them three hours to preach a 30-minute sermon you know because you have to go for the East dialect you know just like if you know if I was saying you know in English we go to the house in Spanish to be vomitos a la casa and if I was French it'd be dealing you know whatever French is and you know all of this but see but they heard it in their own language but they were speaking Galilean or we would say English amen just uh oh it's just beautiful when like when I was in Africa and I would be speaking in English you know an interpreter he was uh translating into Swahili I had no clue what he was talking about he could have been told and I was a a false prophet for all that matter of you know but I didn't know what he I don't know Swahili but he was thinking what I said and interpret it to the people that's what exactly God did on the day of Pentecost he he he interpreted the Galilean language to everyone there that was gathered together no wonder they were perplexed and wonder what does all this mean now as Jesus said go to Jerusalem and Terry and and he we're going to talk just a little bit about that power and then we're going to answer a couple of questions so in Acts 1 uh down let's read let's go to acts 1 and read four five verses here he says now the former treaty I have made o theopolis of all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day of which he was taken up after that through the Holy Ghost was given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion that's now that word passion actually means his sufferings by many infallible proofs now this is too loud turn this down I don't want anybody to be you know I hope it's not too loud by many infallible proofs uh being seen them of 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God verse 4 and being assembled together with them commanding them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which said he ye have heard of me now this is Jesus own words verse 5 for John truly baptized the water but ye shall be baptized now this is what Jesus said he said now Luke 24 49 you're going to receive power but look over here in Acts 1 and 4 Jesus same words he said for John truly baptized the order but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost so he's telling them what this power is he didn't tell them in Luke 24 49 you said go up there you're going to be endued with power but here he said you're going to be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days since of course Jesus knew it would only be 10 days he knew that but they didn't know that and verse six and when they and when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore the kingdom and he said to them it's not it is not for you to know the times and the seasons we're talking about Seasons before which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power now he's going to say repeat what he said you shall receive power after after the Holy Ghost has to come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses now see what we just said just they came out of the upper room what were they doing they were witnessing you shall be Witnesses and this is really interesting why he said this you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all of Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and why did he word it that way and divide it down into three because his brother teaches us that's the three different groups you've got your Jews Jerusalem that was the Jews Judea and Samaria that's the Samaritans and to the other most parts of the earth I said Gentiles so there's your three races right there verse nine and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and received uh out of their sight so so what did he say when Jesus said they would after they received the Holy Ghost they would receive the ghosts receive the Holy Ghost excuse me and they would be Witnesses and they all what did 120 do after they received the Holy Ghost and came out of the upper room they began to witness and they witnessed what had just happened now as we said earlier before they went into the upper room they was scared of the Jews but you know what they got a nature days when they come out of the upper room the Jews were scared of them it's all together different the Jews was afraid of them they had a they had a different boldness they had something that entered in them they wasn't the same people and that's the same thing is when we received the Life of Christ the token the very Life of Christ we're different we're different person we don't we're not ashamed we're not worried we're not confounded we're not we're not confused we know where we're standing I know my redeemer liveth you know so then what is this power uh to be Witnesses your your life is a witness your speech is a witness your dress is a witness your actions is a witness your desires is with everything has changed about us that's how we witness we don't have to be preachers your life is a witness and you receive power to overcome you see a power to resist temptation to sustain do you receive power to to believe and if you receive power to be able to receive the word of God I mean of course we know God put that Gene in you before the foundation of the world but once that light strikes that and that Gene has actually been uh activated if you will you know it was dormant before but now it's come to life now you're a different person all together different oh brother man says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a personal experience he said I've seen people speak in tongues I've seen witches Wizards and any Visionary knows that that's ever dealt with witchcrafts and Devils I've seen them stand and speak in tongues and throw dirt over their back cut themselves with the Lance and speak in tongues interpreted you say that's the Holy Ghost certainly isn't that's the devil Jesus Never Said by tongues you should know them but by their fruit you know she'll know them and what is the fruit love joy peace long-suffering jonest pieces of uh faith and Temperance and so forth and brother man said uh this is getting into another part of it I really want to get to you might speak with tongues and you might not in other words when you receive the Holy Ghost you might speak with don't you might not he said you might dance you might not you might shout you might not but it's one thing you will do you will bear the fruit of the spirit because it's the Life of Christ this is what brother man said you might speak in tongues and you might not but why did the Pentecostals do such a horrible thing talk about what was a horrible thing when they took that in denominator and said you got to speak an unknown tongue as evidence initial evidence you receive the Holy Ghost why did they do that horrible thing why did Pentecostal do that because in the beginning when God began to restore back Yonder 40 years ago bringing back the gifts someone began to speak in tongues and speaking in tongues is the least gift right according to Paul's teaching and of the entire bunch of gifts the least of all the gifts is speaking in tongues and as soon as they did it they all got excited and made a denomination to go out of it and called it the general counsel and the prophet God said that's where they died right there when they made a dime and they said okay this is what you got to believe you've got to be one God three person speak in tongues and initial evidence the Holy Ghost we believe this period don't put a period right over put it in the Articles of faith if you don't believe this you're not going to Rapture so to speak you know but they made an organization out of it but the man said if they would have put a comma and said we believe this plus everything that God will uh will reveal to us of course those two doctors I just quoted to you are not correct to begin with but you know it's got to be a further Revelation this is an unfolding revelation interesting speaking in tongues is the least of all the gifts The General Counsel of the Pentecostal declared is speaking in tongues was initial evidence and and it's a lease of the gifts it's the least of the gifts they said now you've got to do it but that's the least of the gift the whole denomination of Pentecostal Christian made it a man-made Doctrine if you might that you must speak in tongues are an unknown tongue as initial evidence of receiving a Holy Ghost and they all lack revelation they all lack Revelation thank God he sent us a prophet now let me ask you a question we know speaking in tongues is the least of all the gifts where are we today okay first pull second pull third pool we all know this third pool okay brother man preaches Christ the mystery he looks up at the the clock over there it's two o'clock he said I just happened to look up at the clock he said it's two o'clock the ending of the second pool the third pull is at hand 1963. so we know we're in the third pool we don't have to preach on that saw been the evidence we understand so the first pull is so we know that the first pool was the least of the three pulls speaking in tongues was the least of the gifts all right we got nine spiritual gifts we've got three pulls nine spiritual gifts so since the gift of tongues is at the bottom I ask you a question if the tongue is on the bottom which gifts are on the top um that's why I want to begin to understand a little bit of this first Corinthians 12 and 4. now there's the verses yes now we're going to read these nine spiritual gifts as we all know them but I want you to notice as he said speaking in tongues is a lease of yes as the way it's recorded and he knew what he was talking about he said now verse First Corinthians 12 and 8 4 to 1 is given the spirit of the word of wisdom one another word of knowledge two to another Faith three as by the spirit to another Gifts of healing for to another working of Miracles five to another prophecy six and and to another Discerning of spirit seven another diverse kinds of tongues eight and interpretation of tongues nine there's your nine spiritual gifts tongues interpretation recorded at the bottom so we find these we've got nine spiritual gifts we got three pools so what's this the bottom seven eight nine Discerning us Spirits tongues interpretation of tongues now we know that Tom's interpretation or have to go together and that's the reason we know that tongues most being the last in their and they are actually listed right together because they have to be together Tong's interpretation going that's the way it said in into the Bible and a lot can be said about tongues and brother man said after after the seals brother man said one of my uh one one Thorn and I that's the way he said it he said one Thorn I have in the flesh is what I'm trying to preach and somebody will stand up while I'm preaching and give a message in tongues and then give it even if they give the interpretation to us he said that's always a been a thorn in my face she said because it's out of order he said God is not the altar of confusion if they you know you've got to wait till the end of the service you know and they did it many times its own even on tape but he said God's not the author of confusion he's got one train Authority go one Focus you've got to stay with that Focus until the end of the surface that man will be the proper time the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets said hold your hold if you have the urge to speak in tongues that you hold and if there's no interpreter don't speak and oh we could get into that but we're not going that direction today so the second pull if you want to and this isn't tight now it's not you know I'm I'm showing you a type we got nine gifts we've got three pulls so if speaking in tongues interpretations the least of the is the least of the gifts and we know that the first pull is the least of the three pulls because we're in the third pool now it's very very obvious type here so what would be the second pull healing Miracles and prophecy so then what it's at the top that's where we are at and this it's so beautiful why we can regulate what is at the top what is the what is the anointing for our day what is the focus for our day what is this uh what is this uh season that we're in right now it's wisdom knowledge not worldly knowledge Godly knowledge and faith and faith is a revelation those are the three top gifts there's your type of the third pull faith is a revelation now let's just look at this just a little bit and we'll go to another question we want to answer wisdom knowledge and Faith put very simple what what is wisdom I'm just going to give you a simple explanation of this wisdom is a special ability to understand and apply doctrinal truths of life just very simply put that's wisdom what's knowledge Godly knowledge that's special insight and possessing and understanding doctrinal truths and faith is a revelation and that's a special ability to receive and believe doctrinal truth just a very a very simple explanation of wisdom knowledge and faith and Faith of the Revelation and since the spirit of wisdom is come back into the church and we could go and we preached a whole message on Statue of a perfect man then after you got and he said Spirit the spirit of wisdom is come back into the church because that's the anointing for our day he said now you can know how to add to your faith these Seven Virtues I add the faith virtue of knowledge Temperance patience goddess and brotherly kindness and charity what is it then it's the statue of a perfect man only can come in this day statue of a perfect man because the perfect word has come we understand what age we're living in third pool Ministry right God God is building a house all the way from the feet up to the arms all the way up through and look at that just in a minute God's building a house a house of Flesh I'm the house that God lives in that's what God's Building is a tabernacle he could live in for six thousand years since the fall God has desired that he could come back and have perfect Fellowship live inside a human being live inside his children you know with the fullness of the word that they could have the full word not partial word but have a full revelation of the of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ what is the Capstone Revelation all these wonderful truths God could God could now be pleased to take up residence residence inside the believer after the full word has come amen now brother remember what did Brother man say about the gifts in his order I'm going to read a couple of quotes about that he said the gifts are here but as I said this morning we hold so much on speaking in tongues in interpretation he said now watch it he said speak it in tongues that's the last and the least of the gifts and notice what he says here he said the first gift was wisdom the second gift was knowledge and what good is it for you to have knowledge if you haven't got a wisdom know how to take care of your knowledge I mean you know that's very Elementary but it's very important you know if you don't have wisdom to be able to understand what knowledge you have you know what what good is it going to be to you that's why I said the spirit of wisdom has come back into the church amen uh wisdom to take care of your knowledge what goes it to speak in tongues if you if you haven't got wisdom to know when and how to place it see that's where the Pentecostals failed they didn't have wisdom to know where and how to place it and even what the focus was and even what happened on the day of Pentecost they didn't understand thank God for truth thank God for true now here's another look at this this is tremendous I mean the whole Pentecostal charismatic Apostolic the whole emphasis is on speaking in tongues interpret every service is still back to the Pentecost Revival tongues interpretation tongues interpretation I mean that was good for his day but that's not the season today it's still it's still we believe it's just like Luther's message the just shall live by faith we believe that just shall live by faith but that's not the emphasis or the focus today listen what brother M said this tremendous statement he said the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom that pretty much settles it right there don't it the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge and again if you haven't got wisdom then to control your knowledge what good is your knowledge going to do see what I mean seek the first things first now and we could even talk about this scripture but we're not going to go into it even the Bible in Revelation 13 18 says here is wisdom to him that wisdom not to him count the number of the Beast the denomination of people they don't know what who the be the Beast is they're in the very beastly system and don't even understand it don't realize it but he that has wisdom the bride has wisdom let him count the number because we know Revelation 17 the the mystery Babylon her daughter's the denominator we know these things why wisdoms come back into the church sense of focus on the third third pool not the first pull not the second pull but the third pull I can show you I can show you this is really interesting brother man said one place he said I can show you he said one day I'll tell you I don't know if he ever did actually but he said one day I'll tell you the first and second pull was not the perfect will of God it's only the permissive will of God the third pull was really the perfect will of God he said how could he say that well I'm not really Liberty to explain that but I can say this when God actually created Adam and Eve in their form the perfect will of God for children come by Spoken Word not bisexual desire that was perfect will but he permitted the permissive will you know because he actually had attributes of being a healing or Savior and Redeemer to come he had he he had those attributes those attributes had to be displayed but he said his perfect will was spoken word children he said Isaiah should have come through the womb of Mary that's what he said Isaiah it said all of us should have come through the womb of Mary by a spoken word but his permissive will God permitted because he had to display this attributes so you know why why this was you know we understand we're thankful for that now brother man said tongues interpretations earned his spirits was the least of the gifts so we know that wisdom knowledge and faith is the top three gifts we're thankful for that so it gives us a little understanding where are we today I mean what's the focus today Revelation faith is a revelation brother then said Above All Things pray for revelation sure amen just a few more minutes and the spirit of wisdom come to the church to brother man said the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Spirit bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in so why is it important the spirit of wisdom come to the church know what they were living in so we'll understand the focus what is the focus today amen so and he says uh like Daniel said the Holy Spirit come to the church in the last day to reveal these great deep secret things aren't you glad about that and you know when as I said before when you read through the Bible and said the mystery of this uh the mystery of God should be finished it's I think it's 23 times in the Bible the word mystery is actually mentioned every time the word mystery is mentioned in the in the King James in the Bible in the New Testament it's not even the Old Testament at all but in the New Testament of all 23 times and 24 times the word mystery actually in this in the emphatic diaglo is the word Secret The Secret of God the sacred of God the sacred of God the Seeker of God the only place that's actually mystery is Revelation 17 where it says mystery Babylon actually uses the word mystery but every other place in the Bible where it says mystery the original Greek is secret so it's actually God's secrets to his bride not everybody knows it it's not for everybody God Only God only to Whispers his secrets to his bride to his wife his chosen is elected brother man said another place not all these flirters only to his bride now I want to I want to cover this and then we'll we will we will stop very interesting statement brother bam says about receiving the genuine Holy Ghost without sensation very simple it's very simple you know when you study it out it's very simple as I said the Pentecostal believe you got to speak in tongue upon receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost that we know the prophet of this age said that one of the Mysteries was to receive the genuine baptism Holy Ghost without sensation without sensation without sensation now first of all if people would take time to just to look up the definition of sensation you know they would have a little more understanding so I looked it up let me tell you what it means it's really amazing it's amazing the word sensation comes from the word sensate now what does the word sensate mean look it up in the dictionary the word sense8 means what registering on the senses are felt by the senses sense8 registered on the senses are felt by the senses okay it's felt by the senses what's a sense what is your senses five on this body five on the spirit or five on the body rather you got five others on the spirit on your second realm there what does this is what's the definition of a sense you'll like this one the ability of the brain and nerves to react to Impressions from the five faculties of the body which is see taste feel smelling here it's right there so what is what is the win what does the word sense8 mean what does it come from it's a it's actually a ability of the brain and Earth to react to impressions in other words it's it's red it's registering in your brain something coming from your five senses that's what Sensei means so then what is what is the word sensation actually mean the process of receiving conscience sense Impressions through direct stimulation of the sense organs which are C taste feel smell and hear so if you can receive the genuine Holy Ghost without see taste spill field smelling here guess what that's without sensation now look at this look at this so then we receive the Holy Ghost without any conscience sense impressions of sea taste fill spelling here when you get when you receive the Holy Ghost you didn't it's not that you felt it I assist it all that all that might come but that's that's not what that's not what you're relying on that's at the Pentecostal they rely on speaking in tongues you've got to speak in tongue that's not it you know shouting jerking uh back in the healing of hours all in the forehead blood in the hands and this and that all these Sensations it's not it's not scriptural and it has nothing to do with receiving the genuine Holy Ghost so wow that's really deep in it so how to receive the Holy Ghost how to receive the genuine Holy Ghost by Revelation by Revelation he said Revelation it's a it's a personal revelation of God revealing himself to you you accepting that that revelation of who Christ is into your soul acceptance believe in it obeying it God seals you with the Holy Ghost them that obey and that's why he said go up to the city of Jerusalem and Terry when they fully obeyed after 10 days then they were endued with power so we God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey so it's not an emotion it's Christ personally revealed to you it's not a feeling it's not a sensation but the person of Christ taking up residence inside the soul of man has nothing to do with Sensations now somebody tell me I'm asking you a very simple question we got 10 senses senses five on the body see tastes feel smell here five on the spirit realm conscience imagination reason infection memory and then you got one on your soul which is Free Will which is Faith or doubt okay five on the body five on the spirit now as I said you got one on the soul Faith or death now we've got these ten senses and the people said well you know he says Hey brother I'm saying you receive the Holy Ghost without sensation is there any sense on your soul as far as what we just read the definition of sense or sensation or sense of not on your soul on your soul all there is there is no there is no senses on your soul it's just faith free moral Age of Faith to receive or faith to to to not receive but there are no senses on your soul the senses are on your body and and those senses that contact the Earthly home on our spirit realm that's why brother man said you can receive you can have the genuine holy ghost on your spirit realm and still not be saved why because it's got his brother Sean been preaching the last four or five Services it's got to be on your soul it's down where the soul is and a lot of the a lot of the the Pentecostal Brothers especially the old-timers they just have a hard time accepting in fact you did not get a word birth back in Pentecost you can't get a word birth until the full word is come I don't care how much you spoke in tongues and prophesied and had dreams and all these wonderful things that's fine and damning but that's not evidence of the Holy Ghost brother Ben said when you can receive the word and you can obey the word receive you've got a receiver you got representation God had to put that representation in there before you could ever receive the word and if you don't have it you can't receive it and you can't make somebody receive it it's got It's either there it's not there we don't know who who isn't who is it but God knows but it but that receiver that representation must be down in that soul so thank God we can receive the Holy Ghost without Sensations no there's no senses on your soul oh that's on the flesh oh thank are we glad for Revelation for truth so receiving the genuine holy ghost on your soul has nothing to do with those ten senses it's your soul it's all together your soul not feeling it's not sensation not emotions it's all faith faith faith revelation God by Revelation amen musicians you come on on I'll finish this up now I want to ask you this question this is actually uh not direct or related to what we're preaching but I just wanted to bring this in right before we close I thought it was very interesting when I I learned that I learned this why is our nation in such a mess well there's lots of answers but I want to give you one big answer why we're in such a mess brother man preaches a message a warning then judgment so he gives warning and after warning what's left okay why is there such a rapid deterioration even since 1956 he said I predict this year he'll they'll either receive or turn it down said I predict they'll turn it down they did and if you study even back in American history in the last since 56 there's been certainly a rapid deterioration starting at the in the 60s The Beatles and all the sexual Revolution all you talk about going downhill and it's even it's accelerating even more today we understand that why didn't this nation rally around that gift that's that Messiah sign that second pool why didn't they rally around that gift well somebody might say well the government didn't know it they knew it how many knows or when did Brother Brown preach the message deep calling to the Deep precedent in 1954 I think he preached it also in 56. we preached in 1954 and he actually priested in the Constitution Hall in Washington D.C and we know that demon shakiring who was head of the Christian businessman was at that meeting and there's somebody else that was at that meeting a real importance his name was Richard Nixon we know who Richard Nixon was 15 years later Richard Nixon become the 37th President of the United States Richard Nixon saw that Messiah sign Richard Nixon Nixon witnessed that second pull and saw that gift in operation why didn't he when he become president why didn't he at least try to bring that before the people said you know what I was in a meeting 15 years ago and I saw a man perform a messiah sign tell people the secrets of the heart you know what if I was president and I would be a believer I'd do this if I was President then and I saw that I'd have I'd say brother random I want you to have an office right next to mine here in the White House you can tell the secrets of what they're doing in their bed chamber of the enemy you know that would be a wonderful thing to have of course God God don't misuse his gift but I mean you'd sure feel like doing that you know but brother man said if they'd rallied around that gift we wouldn't need a hospital we wouldn't need an army we wouldn't need hardly anything if they'd rallied around that gift and the same thing happened with Israel and Israel would would go back into going into idolatry then their Nation would begin to deteriorate they'd lose battles and on and on and on until they repent and get back with God but the sad part of it is today this nation ain't going to get back to God curse has been put on it she ain't coming back but God has got a little bride where's your mind come on up God's got a little bride that's going to receive the word it's going to believe the word it's going to act on the word it's going to obey the word Hallelujah aren't you glad you got an ear to hear this this nation had opportunity to Rally around that gift it had opportunity the man was there he witnessed that Messiah sign but as I said would they received it probably not but at least he could have tried he could have tried but I'll tell you what Richard Nixon did do he did one of the greatest things for Israel in The Six Day War about in the third or fourth day Israel was losing the war they'd run out of Munitions they'd run out of and they were losing the battle and go to my ear she called Richard Nixon about three o'clock in the morning and said Mr President if you if you want to see Israel save we need help and we need it right now there's one thing he did and I hope he's rewarded for that Richard Nixon did for the land of Israel at first Nixon he hung up the phone he said I just let him bleed for a while then he got to thinking his old mom told him so now and his mother told him Richard one day one day you're going to have the opportunity to help Israel and when you do when you realize that you help Israel with all your mind and Richard Nixon remember that what his mother told him so you know what Richard Nixon did because they needed armed they needed tanks they needed Munitions they needed help Richard Nixon organized and what even the historians will say was the greatest airlift of Weaponry to Israel in just in two days time or less than that from the United States to Israel and they won the war that's what Richard Nixon did to help Israel thank God for that amen God bless you Saints let's stand [Music] it was a tiny simple stable hardly a place [Music] special to reveal stay so I know [Music] in the
