[42:54] going all the way and I trust that your
[42:57] heart's desire I address that's your
[43:00] resolve amen is to keep pressing on
[43:04] we've um gone too far you can turn that
[43:08] down a little ringing uh too far to turn
[43:12] back amen and the musicians can be
[43:16] dismissed I've been enjoyed sister

[43:46] anyways she's uh
[43:48] she's special that's for sure and
[43:51] certainly appreciate her very much amen
[43:55] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[43:57] turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter
[44:00] amen
[44:04] Psalms 23
[44:14] .
[44:18] says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[44:21] want.
[44:22] you maketh me to lie down in Green
[44:24] Pastures he leadeth me
[44:27] beside the Steel Waters
[44:29] and he restoreth my soul
[44:33] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[44:36] of Prayer
[44:38] father
[44:40] your word is the most important thing to
[44:43] us
[44:44] the Lord as it's been said that we can
[44:49] open the book and turn the pages with
[44:53] our natural hands but it takes you to
[44:56] open our understanding
[44:59] and father that's that's the important
[45:02] thing
[45:03] and we ask that you would do that
[45:05] tonight Lord
[45:07] we humbly Lord just ask that you'd
[45:10] forgive us of all of our sins and our
[45:12] failures
[45:14] Lord if we've done anything said
[45:16] anything
[45:18] acted Lord in any way that would not be
[45:21] pleasing in your side we ask that you'd
[45:25] forgive us
[45:26] and Lord may you feel welcome here
[45:30] tonight
[45:31] Lord just to move Among Us in any spirit
[45:35] that would try to hinder your people I
[45:38] pray that you would drive it away
[45:40] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[45:44] amen
[45:45] you can be seated
[45:48] this evening
[45:49] and um
[45:52] I'm just going to continue with that
[45:55] thought and
[45:57] um
[46:00] and if we notice David says here in
[46:04] these verses for one he says the Lord is
[46:06] my shepherd
[46:08] and to me this statement tells us many
[46:11] things as to what the Lord is to us
[46:16] he is my protector he is my provider
[46:20] he is my peace he is always present I
[46:27] think you you could consider that all
[46:30] the seven Redemptive names
[46:33] are wound up right there the Lord is my
[46:36] shepherd
[46:36] for he's all of these things to us
[46:40] and I am his possession
[46:43] and another thing is is
[46:47] he is obligated
[46:49] I think that's a good word he is
[46:52] obligated so I am his obligation
[46:56] and so David goes on to say that he
[46:59] makes me to lie down
[47:01] and as we talked about this before David
[47:04] is not forced this is not a situation
[47:08] that one is forced against his his will
[47:12] that's not the kind of relationship that
[47:15] exists between uh King his sheep to lie
[47:19] down a man by supplying the needs of his
[47:24] Shepherd or of his sheep for David said
[47:27] I shall not want
[47:29] and and if you look he goes on he leads
[47:33] me beside the Still Waters he restores
[47:36] my soul he leads me in the paths of
[47:41] righteousness so this is the shepherd
[47:45] fulfilling his obligation to his Sheep
[47:49] amen uh for the shepherd is bound to the
[47:53] Sheep as as well as the Sheep to the
[47:56] shepherd and so God obligated himself to
[48:00] us when he made a covenant with his
[48:03] church ain't that rhyme a man and this
[48:07] Covenant is to everyone that is a part
[48:11] of the Church of the Living God this
[48:14] Covenant is to to everyone and as we
[48:17] talked about before it's an
[48:19] unconditional Covenant amen uh uh which
[48:24] makes it an eternal Covenant uh an
[48:28] Everlasting Covenant and and
[48:32] um uh in in other words you know
[48:36] um this Covenant exists by the grace of
[48:39] God that's that's all it is is it's just
[48:43] the grace of God in the Covenant exists
[48:46] only because of who God is and what God
[48:49] is and it's all about God and and we are
[48:54] the recipients of that Covenant but God
[48:58] is the one that initiated ain't that
[49:00] right it's the Covenant of Grace uh the
[49:04] prophet called her to Grace Covenant and
[49:06] and uh you know God Saves Man by his
[49:11] grace he calls a man by his grace he
[49:15] delivers a man by his grace ain't that
[49:18] right so everything is is by the grace
[49:21] of God we find that God made a covenant
[49:25] with Adam as well as with Noah and it
[49:29] was the conditional Covenant but then we
[49:32] find that man was not able to keep that
[49:35] Covenant uh and so by All rights God
[49:38] could have walked away and should have
[49:41] walked away and and said well you know
[49:44] man just can't keep his end of the
[49:46] bargain and and so therefore I'm not
[49:49] going to make any any Covenant with him
[49:52] but all the while God was searching and
[49:56] looking if we could say it that way uh
[49:59] in how to make a covenant a man that uh
[50:03] uh that that would be so secure that it
[50:07] would put men to rest it it would put
[50:11] man at peace it would you know and and
[50:14] so we know what the conditional Covenant
[50:17] is like it's it's based upon conditions
[50:20] of both parties
[50:22] uh uh so so one party says well I'll do
[50:26] this if you'll do this and the other
[50:29] party says well I'll do this if you'll
[50:31] do this and then they come into
[50:32] agreement and it becomes a conditional
[50:35] party and the Covenant is as good as
[50:38] both parties uh uh act upon their
[50:42] promise and fulfill their part of the
[50:45] the Covenant a man but man couldn't keep
[50:48] his end of the bargain he just couldn't
[50:51] do it so then then the Covenant that God
[50:54] would make with Abraham uh uh is not
[50:58] well Abraham I'll do this if you'll do
[51:01] this uh but it was Abraham I've already
[51:04] done it amen God found the solution to
[51:08] keep that Covenant as an Everlasting
[51:11] Covenant can you say man so God said
[51:14] I've already done it so therefore we
[51:17] don't have to worry we don't have to
[51:20] struggle we we don't have to fret God
[51:24] has already taken care of it amen do you
[51:29] believe that a man so acts 15 and 18 it
[51:33] says known unto God are all his works
[51:37] from the beginning
[51:38] of the world Amen known unto God so then
[51:43] let's look at one of his Works amen
[51:45] Romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for no
[51:49] amen he also did predestinate to be
[51:53] conformed to the image of his son that
[51:55] he might be the firstborn among many
[51:58] Brethren moreover whom he did
[52:00] predestinate them he also called in whom
[52:03] he called them he also justified in whom
[52:06] he justified them he also glorified amen
[52:10] so notice there is a class of people a
[52:13] group of people that God called he
[52:17] predestinated and he already Justified
[52:21] and glorified and so Paul would go on to
[52:25] ask well what shall we say to these
[52:28] things amen this is this is a a a a
[52:31] great mystery it's something that is
[52:34] profound amen and and and yet it's it's
[52:38] an unexplainable amen but yet God did it
[52:41] amen in the beginning and so Paul would
[52:45] just say what can we say to these things
[52:46] if God before us who can be against us
[52:50] there's nothing to argue about there's
[52:53] nothing to present to God to change it
[52:55] you understand what I'm saying you
[52:58] cannot change God's love to you and you
[53:00] cannot change God in any way you you
[53:03] just can't do it it's already settled
[53:05] ain't that right you can't be a a
[53:08] Christian good enough a man to get God's
[53:11] attention amen and you cannot be in in
[53:14] in one that that that that that is so
[53:18] bad to get God's attention it it's just
[53:21] not that way it's God all you already
[53:23] had God's attention from before the
[53:25] foundation of the world and and he
[53:28] established and he made a covenant with
[53:31] you ain't that right so you didn't have
[53:33] to be there to make a deal with God Amen
[53:37] uh concerning your salvation Nation
[53:39] concerning your destiny amen you you
[53:41] didn't have to be that it was according
[53:43] as Paul would tell us according to his
[53:46] own uh uh good pleasure his own
[53:50] Eternal purpose that he would make a
[53:53] covenant with you ain't that right so
[53:55] God purposed within himself to save you
[53:59] to heal you to deliver you to fill you
[54:02] with the Holy Ghost and he did this
[54:05] before the foundation of the world and
[54:08] that's why the the prophet would tell us
[54:11] today you was already saved you was not
[54:14] saved on any given day you was saved
[54:17] then because in the mind of God God
[54:21] thought of you as saved God thought of
[54:23] you is healed God thought of you amen uh
[54:27] as as his son and daughter of his now
[54:31] the word testament means Covenant amen
[54:35] and and so the Old Testament is the old
[54:38] Covenant which is the law that's that's
[54:42] the old Covenant whereas the New
[54:44] Testament is the New Covenant uh uh
[54:48] Grace ain't that right and and brother
[54:50] Branham called the New Covenant the
[54:53] spirit Covenant it's it's the spirit
[54:56] Covenant amen and and so notice even in
[55:00] the Old Testament God looking a man uh
[55:03] uh ahead and he says there I believe in
[55:07] in Isaiah or Ezekiel and and said I will
[55:11] pour out my spirit ain't that right amen
[55:15] and and he goes on I will give you a new
[55:18] heart and will put within you a new
[55:21] spirit and I will put my spirit within
[55:26] you and will cause you to walk in my
[55:29] statues and you shall keep my judgments
[55:32] and do them and not no law to it no
[55:35] demands no commands amen no oh you
[55:39] better or or else it was simply I will
[55:42] put give you a new heart a new spirit
[55:45] and then I'm going to give you my spirit
[55:48] and when I give you my spirit it's going
[55:51] to cause you to walk in my judgments it
[55:53] it's just going to do that and you're
[55:56] going to keep my judgments and statutes
[55:59] and do them ain't that right notice
[56:01] first John 4 and 13 hereby know that we
[56:06] dwell in him and he and us because he
[56:09] hath given us his Spirit he hath given
[56:14] us his Spirit see it's a spirit Covenant
[56:17] amen you couldn't keep that Covenant on
[56:20] your own ain't that right amen Romans 8
[56:23] and 11. we we know this but Paul said
[56:26] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[56:29] Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you
[56:32] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[56:35] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[56:37] why what
[56:39] his Spirit not by law not by rules not
[56:43] not by anything you do not by an order
[56:46] but by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[56:51] can you say man so then we find it's
[56:55] this spirit it's the spirit of life amen
[56:59] uh uh uh uh Paul would I believe call it
[57:02] the spirit of the law of life amen but
[57:06] it's it's it's it's it's the spirit of
[57:09] life and it and it quickens that
[57:12] predestinated Gene seed of God in you
[57:16] before the foundation of the world ain't
[57:18] that right now brother bran talks about
[57:21] that spirit and of the Holy Ghost Holy
[57:23] Spirit and and he talks about it in the
[57:26] restoration of the bright tree and and
[57:28] remember he talks about there's a law in
[57:30] the fish there's a law in the bird and
[57:32] then there's a law in you as the
[57:35] believer as as the bride of Christ and
[57:38] then that spirit the holy spirit is the
[57:41] one to enforce that law ain't that right
[57:43] now you just think of that Amen to
[57:46] enforce that law amen now you know uh as
[57:50] the prophet would tell us you know that
[57:53] that uh uh if you come home from a
[57:56] vacation and someone's living in your
[57:57] home and and you've got the title to
[58:00] that home and and all of that you you've
[58:03] got every right to go to the law amen
[58:06] the enforcement amen and tell them said
[58:09] this is my home I want them out of my
[58:12] house and and and and and they are to
[58:15] enforce that law ain't that right amen
[58:18] they are to enforce that law well so
[58:21] then that's what the spirit Covenant is
[58:24] it's it's the spirit of God coming to
[58:28] enforce the law how many believes that
[58:30] amen it's to enforce the law now Romans
[58:34] 8 and 15 it says for you have not
[58:37] received the spirit of bondage again to
[58:41] fear if you are now listen God does not
[58:44] put his people into bondage a man is the
[58:47] devil that puts people into bondage can
[58:50] you say amen and and fear is a bondage
[58:53] ain't that right a man doubt is a
[58:56] bondage unbelief that all of these
[58:59] things it's it's nothing but a spirit of
[59:02] bondage but you have not received that
[59:04] type of spirit ain't that right but you
[59:08] have received the spirit of adoption
[59:11] ain't that right amen whereby we cry
[59:14] Abba Father and notice what he says in
[59:17] the 16th verse the spirit itself beareth
[59:21] witness with our spirit that we are
[59:25] children or the sons of God ain't that
[59:29] right amen his spirit is bearing witness
[59:33] with our spirit that we are sons of God
[59:36] Amen I I just think that's awesome a man
[59:40] that when Satan would try to come in
[59:42] with unbelief the spirit of God would be
[59:45] there to say oh no no no don't you
[59:48] listen to that amen because you've not
[59:50] come into uh to receive that spirit of
[59:53] fear to come into bondage again amen but
[59:56] but you have received the spirit of
[59:58] adoption amen see now notice Romans 8
[1:00:03] and 11 or 8 and 1. Paul says there is
[1:00:08] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:00:13] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:00:17] flesh but after what
[1:00:19] the spirit ain't that right amen now now
[1:00:22] notice you're you're not walking after
[1:00:24] the flesh the prophet says the world
[1:00:27] doesn't bother you anymore amen you see
[1:00:30] it and you walk away from it you've got
[1:00:33] something better to think of can you say
[1:00:35] man now listen Church we've got
[1:00:37] something better to think of we've got
[1:00:40] the Covenant to think about we've got
[1:00:41] the promises of God to think about and
[1:00:44] notice of how the spirit of God will
[1:00:47] direct our minds to the word of God Amen
[1:00:51] any anointed preacher would want you
[1:00:53] right back to the word of God Amen any
[1:00:56] any any uh the spirit of God that's
[1:00:58] exactly what he does Amen Even in our
[1:01:02] own cells a man Satan will come and
[1:01:05] start just telling us this and telling
[1:01:07] us that and whatever but we're not
[1:01:09] walking after the flesh amen we're
[1:01:12] walking after the spirit can you say man
[1:01:14] why the spirit itself it's the spirit
[1:01:17] Covenant and the spirit is bearing
[1:01:20] witness with our spirit that we're
[1:01:22] different we're not of this world we are
[1:01:24] the sons of God Amen see so we've got
[1:01:28] something to better to think about the
[1:01:30] prophet said everything you see with
[1:01:32] your eyes is Earthly but it's the things
[1:01:35] that you see in your spirit through the
[1:01:38] word then you say man amen we got to
[1:01:42] look at through the word amen see amen
[1:01:46] and that's what we got to see that's
[1:01:48] what we got to meditate upon a man's
[1:01:51] seat and he says the word is God's
[1:01:53] looking glass or mirror that reflects
[1:01:57] what he is and what you are can you say
[1:02:01] amen amen this word reflects what he is
[1:02:04] and what you are amen you're in this
[1:02:07] Bible amen that's right see it tells you
[1:02:10] a man so brother Branham would tell us
[1:02:12] he said this is the only book in the
[1:02:15] world that tells you where you come from
[1:02:17] who you are and where you're going going
[1:02:19] show me any page of literature anywhere
[1:02:22] with all the science and anything else
[1:02:25] every good book that's been written none
[1:02:28] of it can tell you that none of it will
[1:02:30] tell you where you're going where you
[1:02:32] came from who God is and who you are
[1:02:35] amen he'll tell you about your
[1:02:37] destination there's no other book
[1:02:39] there's no other Spirit that'll tell you
[1:02:42] but God in his word can you say man so
[1:02:46] the word of God being God's mirror it
[1:02:49] shows you what he is and what you are
[1:02:53] and then brother Brown says there's a
[1:02:56] bloodline a man between in between there
[1:03:00] is a bloodline that shows what you can
[1:03:02] be if you want to make the choice can
[1:03:06] you say amen amen are you listening now
[1:03:08] amen it tells you what you can be the
[1:03:11] blood tells you what you can be the
[1:03:15] blood's got a voice can you say amen
[1:03:17] amen and it's a it's the blood of Christ
[1:03:20] speaks better things than that of Abel
[1:03:22] ain't that right Abel's blood spoke
[1:03:25] condemnation amen but this Blood speaks
[1:03:28] life it speaks peace it speaks Mercy it
[1:03:31] speaks Grace amen and that bloodline
[1:03:33] tells you that you can be a man what
[1:03:37] God's called you to be ain't that right
[1:03:41] you can be if you want to make that
[1:03:44] choice amen that's right see so then
[1:03:47] look at that second verse for the law of
[1:03:50] the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
[1:03:54] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:03:56] death can you say amen amen see we
[1:03:59] couldn't do it we could not obey the
[1:04:01] Covenant we couldn't keep our part of
[1:04:03] the Covenant amen we were Sinners we
[1:04:05] were bound we were no good so the spirit
[1:04:08] of God would come in amen the spirit of
[1:04:12] the Covenant amen would come into us and
[1:04:16] set us free amen ain't that right no
[1:04:19] more condemnation free from sin how many
[1:04:22] is free from sin amen free from unbelief
[1:04:25] free from all doubt free from all these
[1:04:27] things free from the cares of the world
[1:04:30] ain't that right now you say well how
[1:04:32] can that be well he says they're there
[1:04:35] the blood of the Lamb has been applied
[1:04:39] can you say man now listen Church we're
[1:04:42] talking about the Lord being Our
[1:04:43] Shepherd we're following him how can you
[1:04:46] follow a holy God how how how can your
[1:04:48] soul be restored how can you walk in the
[1:04:51] paths of righteousness as a sinner
[1:04:54] can you say man how how can you lead be
[1:04:58] led by such a a a a a God in that way
[1:05:02] amen you know where he's leading you to
[1:05:04] he's leading you in the Covenant that he
[1:05:06] promised what you're doing is you're
[1:05:08] fulfilling the very Covenant that he
[1:05:10] made but it's not you
[1:05:13] it's the spirit of God in you
[1:05:16] ain't that right so the the blood of the
[1:05:18] Lamb has been applied and the god of
[1:05:21] Heaven has accepted you his life in you
[1:05:25] and you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:29] Amen so Jesus would even tell us my word
[1:05:33] is spirit and they are life ain't that
[1:05:37] right so to walk after the spirit is to
[1:05:41] walk after the word
[1:05:42] don't walk after your feelings don't
[1:05:44] walk out of your imagination don't walk
[1:05:47] after what your flesh is telling you
[1:05:49] amen you walk after that word you follow
[1:05:51] that word you obey that word you believe
[1:05:54] that word you confess that word why
[1:05:57] you're walking after the spirit and not
[1:06:00] after the flesh can you say amen amen
[1:06:03] that's right see well you know see
[1:06:06] people say well I can't live that word
[1:06:08] that word's too hard but you know what
[1:06:10] the Bible does tell us that where the
[1:06:12] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:06:15] now they they say well that means that
[1:06:18] you know you get to dancing you get the
[1:06:20] shouting and that's the spirit and
[1:06:22] that's all fine and that's all good and
[1:06:24] I I believe in every bit of it amen but
[1:06:27] the spirit of the Lord goes deeper than
[1:06:29] that because we've seen them dancing
[1:06:31] they're still bound we've seen them
[1:06:32] hollering they're still bound amen they
[1:06:34] can sing the old hymns of the church and
[1:06:36] they're still bound amen they can sing
[1:06:38] new songs that are coming in the church
[1:06:40] that people don't like and they can
[1:06:42] still be bound it doesn't matter on that
[1:06:44] and and people fuss and fight and they
[1:06:46] argue and they do all these things as if
[1:06:48] that really makes them something amen
[1:06:51] but hear what we're talking about is a
[1:06:53] deeper Liberty a greater Liberty and
[1:06:56] that is the spirit of the Lord amen
[1:06:59] coming upon an individual amen and
[1:07:02] bringing a liberty in that individual's
[1:07:05] life can you say Amen to where they are
[1:07:07] free to believe they are free to Rejoice
[1:07:09] they are free just to amen just to have
[1:07:12] a good time amen they're free Amen to
[1:07:15] just enjoy amen their salvation they're
[1:07:19] free Amen to live the word can you say
[1:07:21] Amen they're free Amen to walk in the
[1:07:24] paths of righteousness amen see what is
[1:07:28] it the spirit is there in that
[1:07:30] individual confirming the Covenant a man
[1:07:35] confirming the Covenant and that's what
[1:07:37] we all have I pray this evening is the
[1:07:40] spirit of the Lord bringing a Liberty in
[1:07:44] our soul amen can you say man now that
[1:07:47] don't mean you're not going to have your
[1:07:48] doubts that don't mean you're going to
[1:07:49] gonna have the fears amen tried to come
[1:07:51] upon you amen but there's a spirit of
[1:07:54] the Lord there that'll keep you a man
[1:07:57] from coming into that bondage Amen to
[1:07:59] where you're warped and you're you're
[1:08:01] you've come into like the world is and
[1:08:04] you're fearing and and all of these
[1:08:06] things yes you've got to overcome
[1:08:07] Spirits amen but you ain't going to
[1:08:10] overcome without the spirit of the Lord
[1:08:12] giving you that Liberty to do so can you
[1:08:14] say amen amen that's why we couldn't
[1:08:17] obey this Covenant amen because if we
[1:08:19] had fear how are you going to obey that
[1:08:21] Covenant amen so many people are afraid
[1:08:23] just to step out and take God at his
[1:08:26] word because of fear amen that they're
[1:08:28] they're afraid to accept the promises of
[1:08:30] God because of fear amen but when the
[1:08:34] Liberty comes abandon that gives you a
[1:08:37] freedom no matter what your uh your
[1:08:39] flesh says no matter what you feel you
[1:08:42] have the Liberty to press on Amen
[1:08:46] because the spirit of the Lord has given
[1:08:48] you that Liberty
[1:08:49] and he's there confirming confirming the
[1:08:52] Covenant to us it's there to make that
[1:08:55] word live ain't that right now brother
[1:08:58] Branham in talking about the Life of
[1:09:00] Christ I want you to listen to this now
[1:09:02] the spirit life amen he's talking about
[1:09:05] the Life of Christ and he said instead
[1:09:07] of a human being amen it was a super
[1:09:10] super human being amen now that's what
[1:09:14] they came that's what they saw in the
[1:09:16] life of Jesus Christ a man in flesh a
[1:09:19] man that was getting old older Beyond
[1:09:22] his his natural age he looked what to be
[1:09:25] 50 55 and he was only uh 30 you know and
[1:09:29] and and so so gray-haired and and and
[1:09:32] stoop shoulder wrinkles and and and and
[1:09:36] and uh all of these things amen but they
[1:09:39] saw more than just a human being the
[1:09:42] life made more than just a human being
[1:09:44] because it wasn't a natural life it
[1:09:46] wasn't a human life it was the life of
[1:09:49] God living in that body now notice that
[1:09:52] now instead of a human being it was a
[1:09:55] super super super human being and that
[1:09:58] makes the human being now not only a
[1:10:00] human being but he's a son and daughter
[1:10:03] of God of the super super super super
[1:10:06] super live that was in him and it comes
[1:10:10] back upon you and changes you from a
[1:10:13] sinner and the things of the world from
[1:10:15] a church member and a denominational
[1:10:17] goal to a born-again Christian filled
[1:10:20] with the spirit and the life of God just

[1:10:46] therefore there's no condemnation at all
[1:10:50] oh I hope you understand that amen no
[1:10:54] condemnation God does not want

[1:11:58] that here is God Of Heaven that could
[1:12:01] cast his vote for you and has made you a
[1:12:05] super super human being by his own

[1:20:09] that ain't a picnic and they ain't
[1:20:12] dreaming that up
[1:20:13] we already know what's happening hey we

[1:20:53] Rapids of Glory can you say amen and

[1:20:57] be in the voice of a politician that
[1:21:00] voice in there come on church that voice
[1:21:02] ain't in the voice of some church
[1:21:04] denomination that voice was in the voice
[1:21:06] of Malachi 4. can you say man we don't
[1:21:10] need another Prophet on the scene we've
[1:21:12] already got Malachi for Amen to give us
[1:21:15] rapturing faith
[1:21:18] we're hearing the voice
[1:21:21] and his church will be taken away on the
[1:21:23] wings of his salvation

[1:21:41] because we're all going to be changed in
[1:21:43] a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're

[1:21:47] spirit of truth that revealed that can

[1:22:01] Covenant see it's our Advocate an
[1:22:04] advocate is an intercessor or a consoler
[1:22:08] so so Webster says an advocate is one
[1:22:12] who defends or maintains a cause one who
[1:22:16] promotes or supports the interest of one
[1:22:20] one who pleads the calls of another oh
[1:22:24] my so God Not only would make a covenant
[1:22:28] but he would become our Advocate not
[1:22:31] just trying to show you how sure this
[1:22:34] Covenant is to put us at rest amen see
[1:22:38] our Advocate does things that we cannot
[1:22:40] do it stands in your place interceding
[1:22:44] to God on your behalf now you think of
[1:22:47] that on your behalf when you don't seem
[1:22:50] to get anywhere with God your Advocate
[1:22:53] is with God interceding on your behalf
[1:22:56] can you say man and when it doesn't seem
[1:22:59] that God understands where you're at
[1:23:01] your Advocate is with God interceding to
[1:23:05] God on your behalf when you're in the
[1:23:07] worst trial of your life and it doesn't
[1:23:09] look like you're going to make it there

[1:23:14] pleading on your behalf he is caught
[1:23:16] he's bringing up to God your calls amen

[1:23:24] bad it all is about God you remember the
[1:23:29] Covenant you made with them people God
[1:23:31] you can't destroy them people God you
[1:23:34] brought a blood a man to where them
[1:23:36] people can be cathered at all times amen
[1:23:40] he's advocating your calls
[1:23:45] and notice your Advocate your Advocate
[1:23:48] brother Brown said it has Mercy
[1:23:51] it is your righteousness
[1:23:54] it is a propitiation for your sins it's
[1:23:59] your healing it's your life

[1:24:11] can you say man oh that means ever felt
[1:24:15] your faith getting so weak you just
[1:24:17] didn't know what to do and your Advocate

[1:24:33] but they've turned him down
[1:24:35] they rejected their pardon they they
[1:24:37] didn't want nothing about him but we
[1:24:39] receive him and here we are just the
[1:24:42] common-born people that we're still
[1:24:43] pressing when we should have been under
[1:24:46] we're still moving

[1:25:03] intercession
[1:25:05] when you forget to pray he's making
[1:25:07] intercession

[1:25:12] don't understand maybe what you're
[1:25:14] reading he's an intercessor
[1:25:17] amen you may be listening to a tape and
[1:25:19] you don't understand what the prophet
[1:25:21] means by that he's your intercessor when
[1:25:23] the world is coming against you and
[1:25:25] these religious demons are are are
[1:25:27] trying to Prevail over you he's our
[1:25:29] intercessor hallelujah how else are you
[1:25:32] going to make it how else are these
[1:25:33] young people going to make it there's

[1:25:43] flood of our life our biggest failure of
[1:25:45] our life he's still interceding for you
[1:25:48] why there is a covenant
[1:25:53] Spirit of the Covenant
[1:25:56] and there is a blood keeping us covered
[1:25:59] all the time
[1:26:01] brother Brown said we're going to make
[1:26:02] mistakes
[1:26:04] and yet we don't do it willfully
[1:26:07] Brown said you're trapped in anything
[1:26:09] you're trapped into or do something that
[1:26:10] you don't mean to do it it's not sin yet
[1:26:13] because you'll repent in the minute you
[1:26:15] see that you're wrong
[1:26:16] you'll turn quickly and say I didn't
[1:26:18] mean it I didn't see that and you'll say
[1:26:20] that all through life
[1:26:24] and you say Amen
[1:26:26] so he makes intercession for our
[1:26:29] ignorance
[1:26:30] brother Brown said sometimes we got the
[1:26:32] Holy Ghost

[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:54] he's our attorney he stands there and
[1:26:57] pleads for us we don't plead for
[1:27:00] ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US
[1:27:02] pleads for us the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:27:04] Spirit giving utterance sometimes with
[1:27:06] words you cannot understand he makes
[1:27:09] intercessions for us that's what the
[1:27:11] Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything
[1:27:13] I walk like a little kid you walk like a
[1:27:16] little fella we're walking in the dark
[1:27:18] world full of enemies full of sin full
[1:27:20] of traps full of everything and you say

[1:27:38] an advocate amen oh he stands by us he
[1:27:43] is in us and he makes intercessions for
[1:27:45] us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly
[1:27:49] making an advocate for us all the time
[1:27:52] and if God before us who can be against
[1:27:55] us there is no weapon that can prosper
[1:27:58] against us can you say man amen you're
[1:28:02] going to make it he calls there's an
[1:28:03] advocate oh God's already provided you
[1:28:06] the attorney
[1:28:12] the judge
[1:28:13] became
[1:28:15] your attorney
[1:28:25] there was a man
[1:28:26] speaking in Oklahoma a minister from
[1:28:29] England and he's talking about the wig
[1:28:33] and how did they still wear the wigs in
[1:28:35] England
[1:28:37] and
[1:28:39] that one day the judge's daughter showed
[1:28:42] up in court and stood before him
[1:28:46] and she had a fine
[1:28:52] and here you know
[1:28:56] he asked her
[1:28:58] are you guilty yep I'm guilty
[1:29:02] he said well I sentence you
[1:29:04] or this this you're going to have to pay
[1:29:06] so much and her her eyes just got big or
[1:29:09] her jaw just dropped like
[1:29:12] how could you
[1:29:17] say he was a judge
[1:29:22] and he judged by the law
[1:29:28] and when she's about to turn away she's
[1:29:29] in tears
[1:29:31] about to turn away he just takes off the
[1:29:33] wig
[1:29:35] s off the robes
[1:29:37] and he stood up and went around
[1:29:39] now he's her father
[1:29:42] and he pulls out a checkbook
[1:29:46] and he writes the check
[1:29:49] and said here you are paid in full
[1:29:52] she went out that court all happy and
[1:29:54] excited
[1:29:56] but that's what God done
[1:29:58] our judge became our attorney
[1:30:02] the judge
[1:30:05] that that said you that can com told us
[1:30:09] that we were Sinners that the judge
[1:30:12] that condemned us
[1:30:13] also became our attorney he also became
[1:30:16] our lamb he he became everything that we
[1:30:20] needed him to be can you say Amen
[1:30:23] but now notice
[1:30:25] he cannot do one thing for you everybody
[1:30:27] say he cannot do one thing for me
[1:30:31] he cannot make intercession for you
[1:30:35] until you first confess that it's done
[1:30:39] so you have to believe him to be your
[1:30:41] intercessor
[1:30:43] can you say man
[1:30:45] and you have to confess it he's my he
[1:30:48] he's my Advocate he's my intercessor
[1:30:50] he's advocating for me
[1:30:53] I I'm I'm not worthy I understand that
[1:30:56] see but he but but he said it can you
[1:30:59] say amen and when you begin to confess
[1:31:01] the word he becomes the intercessor and
[1:31:04] the prophet said he can only act when we
[1:31:06] confess can you say amen that's why you
[1:31:09] you shouldn't let just just let your
[1:31:11] mouth just go numb and let the devil
[1:31:13] fight your little mind amen but you
[1:31:16] speak the word speaking the word is it
[1:31:18] very important can you say Amen confess
[1:31:21] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and thou
[1:31:23] shalt be saved you say well I'm thinking
[1:31:24] of scriptures talk scriptures can you
[1:31:27] say man talk them scriptures talk them
[1:31:29] quotes amen say what the prophet said
[1:31:32] say what the Bible says amen and you may
[1:31:34] have to say it a thousand times but say
[1:31:36] it again amen bro the more you say it
[1:31:39] he's constantly making intercession for
[1:31:42] you ain't that right then the Holy Ghost
[1:31:45] is our seal a man and a seal is a
[1:31:48] finished work so this is The Testament
[1:31:50] that God cannot lose you
[1:31:55] amen see the infinite God who saves you
[1:31:58] here knowing he's going to lose you next
[1:32:01] week next month next year the prophet
[1:32:03] said while he's defeating the very
[1:32:04] purpose he can not lose you
[1:32:09] so God gave you the Holy Ghost as a sign
[1:32:12] that he recognized you at his own as his
[1:32:16] own in the beginning and he has laid
[1:32:19] claim to you can you say Amen so I want
[1:32:21] to say it this way if you're walking in
[1:32:24] a legalistic way tonight and if you're
[1:32:26] following after walking out the flesh
[1:32:28] you are not walking in the New Testament
[1:32:32] are you with me because the New
[1:32:34] Testament the New Testament is is the
[1:32:37] New Covenant
[1:32:39] ain't that right we are not to walk in
[1:32:42] in the law under law we are not to walk
[1:32:45] under the legalism and we're not if that
[1:32:47] condemnation is bothering you you're not
[1:32:50] walking in the after the newness of the
[1:32:53] Covenant the New Covenant the New
[1:32:54] Testament amen the New Testament is
[1:32:57] God's grace to you can you say Amen the
[1:32:59] New Testament is the product of calvary
[1:33:05] a man the New Covenant see the new
[1:33:07] covenant's got to be effective in you
[1:33:10] ain't that right the new covenant's got
[1:33:12] to be effective in you see so God
[1:33:15] fulfilled his part of the Covenant in
[1:33:16] Christ and now God comes inside of you
[1:33:19] given his own spirit in you to fulfill
[1:33:23] your part
[1:33:25] of that Covenant I think it is important
[1:33:29] as to how we introduce God to the people
[1:33:33] some make him out to be a tyrant ready
[1:33:35] to kill anything and everything that
[1:33:36] moves
[1:33:37] ministers have portrayed God in in such
[1:33:40] a horrible way
[1:33:42] to where fear resides in the hearts of
[1:33:45] the people instead of faith
[1:33:47] can you say man
[1:33:49] I think it's important to preach the
[1:33:51] promises
[1:33:52] because you see you may not be there
[1:33:55] tonight it you you may not you you may
[1:33:57] not but what we're doing is we're waving
[1:34:00] the promises over you
[1:34:02] we're waving them over you can you say
[1:34:04] man sure it would be easy to pull down
[1:34:06] all the faults and the failures
[1:34:09] and and I'll be honest with you it
[1:34:11] doesn't take a genius to come up with
[1:34:13] some problems
[1:34:15] can you say man because we're all human
[1:34:17] and and and we can start naming problems
[1:34:20] weaknesses and all everything and then
[1:34:22] it'll it'll hit a lot of you can you say
[1:34:24] Amen but that's not what we're meant to
[1:34:26] do that's not what we're called to do
[1:34:28] amen but we're called to wave the
[1:34:30] promises over you that's why we ought to
[1:34:32] study this message
[1:34:35] that's right preachers ought to study
[1:34:37] this message
[1:34:38] to wave it over the people
[1:34:42] can you say man wave it over the people
[1:34:45] see amen so so they have they've been
[1:34:48] ministers have portrayed God in such a
[1:34:51] way that it doesn't build faith it
[1:34:53] builds fear and its anchors and a fear
[1:34:56] into the hearts of people and it takes
[1:34:58] the grace of God to deliver them people
[1:35:00] from it
[1:35:02] and I ain't talking about fear that is
[1:35:04] connected with respect and reverence
[1:35:07] the fear that I'm speaking of drives
[1:35:09] people away from God
[1:35:11] drives them as as Adam ran and hid from
[1:35:14] the presence of the Lord Adam had every
[1:35:17] right though too to to hide because he
[1:35:20] was using his own covering to approach
[1:35:21] God can you say Amen but notice when God
[1:35:26] God made a way to where Adam wouldn't
[1:35:29] have to run from him again
[1:35:31] Hallelujah
[1:35:33] he took off that old covering he took
[1:35:35] off that man-made theology
[1:35:37] amen and he and he made a covering for
[1:35:40] Adam himself to where Adam didn't have
[1:35:43] to run he could run to God with an
[1:35:47] atonement can you say amen amen see God
[1:35:51] took the bloody skin of an animal and
[1:35:53] wrapped at him with it and it showed
[1:35:55] right there that one day he would be
[1:35:57] wrapped up in skin and he would take his
[1:35:59] own blood and cover the church with it
[1:36:01] amen and he would perfect them forever
[1:36:04] that are Sanctified he would take his
[1:36:08] own blood and would loose us from our
[1:36:10] sins he would pour himself into us and
[1:36:14] and his life in us would be a token to
[1:36:17] us amen that we are redeemed
[1:36:23] how many beliefs you're redeemed
[1:36:27] you got to believe it by faith
[1:36:29] I'm redeemed
[1:36:31] yeah but you don't know where I'm at but
[1:36:33] I'm redeemed
[1:36:35] you got to believe it
[1:36:37] you can't walk you can't follow the
[1:36:39] Shepherd in doubt
[1:36:43] can you say man
[1:36:45] if you if we're living in doubt and
[1:36:48] we're letting doubt rule our lives and
[1:36:49] it shows you're not eating in the Green
[1:36:51] Pastures
[1:36:54] and you say man
[1:36:56] see and and so there is therefore now no
[1:37:00] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:37:03] brother Brown said when God accepted me
[1:37:05] and baptized me with the Holy Ghost he
[1:37:07] had confidence in me
[1:37:09] that I would not sin willfully
[1:37:12] God help us
[1:37:15] he kept us in that body of corruption
[1:37:17] hello
[1:37:19] kept us in that body that had a sticky
[1:37:21] nature
[1:37:23] brother Brown said as long as you're in
[1:37:24] that body you'll always have a sticky
[1:37:26] nature but it showed that God had
[1:37:29] confidence in us that we would not do it
[1:37:31] willfully
[1:37:32] amen he had confidence in me that I
[1:37:34] would not sin willfully a man I would
[1:37:37] not sin willfully therefore his son made
[1:37:40] an atonement for me and I cannot be a
[1:37:43] sinner as long as I'm Justified and he's
[1:37:46] took me into his body I'm redeemed with
[1:37:49] him not what I do but what he did for me
[1:37:54] that's the gospel
[1:38:01] Hallelujah
[1:38:03] so the Bible tells us that the lamb was
[1:38:06] slain
[1:38:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:12] that's all right
[1:38:14] your name was written in the Lamb's Book
[1:38:16] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:38:18] world
[1:38:19] now the legalists will teach that your
[1:38:21] name can be taken off that book
[1:38:23] off that Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:26] but that's an error
[1:38:28] brother Brown said that church is a
[1:38:30] predestinated church
[1:38:31] and every name that was ever put on that
[1:38:34] book Jesus came to redeem
[1:38:36] every name that was ever put on that
[1:38:38] book Jesus came to redeem
[1:38:41] and you were chosen before the
[1:38:43] foundation of the world or you wasn't
[1:38:44] chosen at all he just come to redeem
[1:38:49] that name on the book
[1:38:51] can you say Amen
[1:38:53] amen see now now it's by faith that we
[1:38:56] accept it by faith can you see men now I
[1:39:00] want you to notice how secure we are
[1:39:02] Ephesians 4 30. it says grieve not the
[1:39:06] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:39:10] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[1:39:15] oh God
[1:39:18] now brother Brown said you're sealed
[1:39:20] into the body of Christ by the baptism
[1:39:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:23] not from one Revival to another one
[1:39:28] but until the day of the body of
[1:39:31] redemption
[1:39:32] that's what you are so there's no way
[1:39:35] for you to be lost
[1:39:37] you get scared
[1:39:39] and that's the reason scare a scare fear
[1:39:43] company's doubt
[1:39:45] love companies faith
[1:39:47] I love my father I'm not afraid of him
[1:39:50] because I love him he wouldn't hurt me
[1:39:52] he will do good for me if I was scared
[1:39:56] of him and oh I don't know whether he
[1:39:58] will do it or not see
[1:40:00] but if I love him yes Father I love you
[1:40:02] and I know you're my father and you love
[1:40:05] me
[1:40:07] and I'm not afraid but what you'll keep
[1:40:10] your word
[1:40:11] get your promise to me then you say man
[1:40:14] that's what love does it makes the
[1:40:16] promise of God personal
[1:40:19] it's your promise to me
[1:40:22] how how can we wake up
[1:40:25] next in the morning without knowing them
[1:40:27] promises are to us
[1:40:29] where would we stand
[1:40:32] when we know that the wrath of God is
[1:40:34] coming any moment
[1:40:36] the the Rapture is coming the changing
[1:40:38] of our body
[1:40:40] oh God help us to get it in our soul
[1:40:43] that we can wake up with confidence and
[1:40:46] a song and a heart a praise on our lips
[1:40:50] this is your promise to me
[1:40:53] can you say Amen
[1:40:55] oh yes sir he said see that's the way
[1:40:59] the spirit of God does but oh he said if
[1:41:03] I did this and if I did that see there
[1:41:06] you come to the legal side again
[1:41:08] never go to the legal side
[1:41:13] everybody say that never go to the legal
[1:41:18] side
[1:41:19] it's negative
[1:41:22] don't let your mind well I wish I could
[1:41:24] have done that I should have gotten up
[1:41:25] and prayed more I should have this and I
[1:41:27] said you know you can tear your mind up
[1:41:29] doing that you could tear yourself
[1:41:31] totally up well I prayed an hour I
[1:41:33] should have prayed an hour and five
[1:41:34] minutes
[1:41:36] Satan will work your mind up
[1:41:40] can you say Amen but never go to the
[1:41:43] legal side it's negative
[1:41:45] should you pray yes or you should pray
[1:41:47] should you read yes you should read your
[1:41:50] Bible should you listen to them tapes
[1:41:52] you should be in them tapes all the time
[1:41:56] but never let it become illegal yes you
[1:42:02] never go to the legal side it's negative
[1:42:04] the positive side is what you want what
[1:42:08] is the positive side it's already a
[1:42:12] finished work
[1:42:13] that's what the prophet said that's the
[1:42:15] positive it's a finished work
[1:42:18] the positive I am saved the positive I
[1:42:22] am healed the positive is is my child is
[1:42:25] coming back home the positive is God's
[1:42:28] working this all out the positive is I'm
[1:42:31] going to make it the positive is the
[1:42:34] Satan you cannot touch me
[1:42:38] the positive
[1:42:40] see he said the positive side is what
[1:42:43] you want it's already a finished word
[1:42:45] Christ died and the sin was killed when
[1:42:47] he died and if God for ordained you to
[1:42:50] eternal life all the father has given me
[1:42:52] will come to me there you are you cannot
[1:42:54] be lost
[1:42:57] somebody confess it I can't be lost
[1:43:00] I can't be lost
[1:43:02] amen see why you're secured forever for
[1:43:06] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:43:09] one body and by one sacrifice he has
[1:43:12] perfected forever there you are there's
[1:43:14] no way for us to lose
[1:43:17] on
[1:43:18] now notice I hope it's okay
[1:43:22] but notice he restoreth my soul
[1:43:25] that we've talked about it you're an
[1:43:27] outside person that has five senses
[1:43:29] and them senses are given to you to
[1:43:31] contact your Earthly home not God
[1:43:34] not contact God but your Earthly home
[1:43:37] then the inside of that is your spirit
[1:43:39] it has five senses by which you can
[1:43:41] contact the spirit world
[1:43:43] brother Brown said your physical
[1:43:45] contacts the physical your spiritual
[1:43:47] contacts the spiritual you can't think
[1:43:50] with your body you have to think with
[1:43:52] your spirit you can you can't have
[1:43:54] conscience in your body it has no mental
[1:43:56] faculties at all your body doesn't so
[1:43:59] you have to think with your spirit you
[1:44:01] have to reason you can't reason with
[1:44:03] your physical being because reason
[1:44:04] doesn't see taste fail smell or hear see
[1:44:08] reasoning is what you can make in your
[1:44:10] mind if you're asleep or you're out your
[1:44:13] body is lying they're dead but your
[1:44:15] spirit still can reason see and so
[1:44:18] there's five senses that can control
[1:44:20] that inside man right and we talked
[1:44:22] about that see but what David is
[1:44:25] speaking of goes so much deeper than
[1:44:27] your flesh or your spirit
[1:44:29] can you say amen amen and and that last
[1:44:32] man the prophet would say it's the soul
[1:44:34] and only has one sense that controls it
[1:44:37] and that is free moral agency
[1:44:40] ain't that right man's free will to
[1:44:43] reject her to choose now notice what he
[1:44:46] says that soul is a gene that come from
[1:44:50] God
[1:44:52] ain't that right
[1:44:54] so remember the outside man can be
[1:44:56] Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:45:01] your spirit man can be anointed
[1:45:05] and still you're so be lost
[1:45:07] we've talked about it how the soul is
[1:45:09] the nature of your spirit your spirit
[1:45:12] controls your your soul controls your
[1:45:14] spirit your spirit controls the flesh so
[1:45:17] no matter what happens on the outside
[1:45:20] your desires come from your soul
[1:45:24] ain't that right you can come in here
[1:45:27] cry be anointed dance and woohoo Hong
[1:45:30] all that but you can leave with the same
[1:45:32] desires and never be changed
[1:45:37] ain't that right Prophet said people can
[1:45:39] live in this Spirit they could dance in
[1:45:41] the spirit they shout in the spirit they
[1:45:44] go to church in the spirit they can
[1:45:45] absolutely have the real spirit of God
[1:45:48] anointed on that Spirit but still be
[1:45:50] lost and just as devil possessed as they
[1:45:52] can be with that spirit
[1:45:54] now notice in another place he said that
[1:45:57] spirit is of a worldly nature because it
[1:46:01] was not given from God but it was given
[1:46:05] or permitted by God
[1:46:08] now you got that for every child that's
[1:46:11] born in the world is born in sin shaped
[1:46:13] in iniquity coming to the world speaking
[1:46:15] lies that right so that person inside
[1:46:17] there is a sinner to begin with
[1:46:21] but listen but when our old Nature has
[1:46:25] died you become a new creature or
[1:46:30] creation
[1:46:33] ain't that right
[1:46:34] not your spirit being anointed that
[1:46:36] doesn't make you a new creation not your
[1:46:39] flesh
[1:46:41] being all going through all the forms of
[1:46:43] religion rituals orders of the church
[1:46:48] even though they could be good good
[1:46:49] orders too
[1:46:51] they don't make you a saint
[1:46:54] second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any
[1:46:57] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:46:59] creation old things are passed away
[1:47:02] behold all things are become new and
[1:47:05] notice Church listen there is no such
[1:47:08] thing as a sinner saint
[1:47:12] can't be the same thing
[1:47:14] you're either a sinner or you're a saint
[1:47:17] but don't play the game
[1:47:19] He Loves Me He Loves Me Not He Loves Me
[1:47:22] He Loves Me Not
[1:47:26] that's that's your reasoning
[1:47:29] if you are if you ever have an inkling
[1:47:33] that God loves you
[1:47:35] Hallelujah well the devil ain't gonna
[1:47:37] tell you that he loves you
[1:47:39] that'll ain't gonna tell you God loves
[1:47:41] you hell ain't gonna tell you God's for
[1:47:43] you
[1:47:46] can you say Amen
[1:47:48] amen and if you ever have that little
[1:47:50] England that God cares about you
[1:47:53] then you stay with that England
[1:47:56] because the devil's going to come and
[1:47:57] try to take that away from you but you
[1:48:00] just remember Jesus Christ to sing
[1:48:02] yesterday today and forever he cannot
[1:48:05] change
[1:48:10] so let's look how secure we are if you
[1:48:12] don't mind for just a few moments then
[1:48:15] I'll let you go
[1:48:16] First John 3 9 whosoever is born of God
[1:48:19] doth not commit sin
[1:48:22] now the legalists have jumped on this
[1:48:24] scripture and bashed the people up
[1:48:26] for his seed remaineth in him
[1:48:29] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:48:33] God
[1:48:34] oh do you love that
[1:48:37] now notice before Prophet said before
[1:48:39] God can come down in the person of the
[1:48:41] Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down
[1:48:44] and dwelling in the human heart it first
[1:48:46] must be repented it must be baptized in
[1:48:49] water in his name to show who it belongs
[1:48:51] to then it must be cleansed by the blood
[1:48:54] of Jesus Christ and then the Holy Fire
[1:48:57] and Holy Ghost come from God comes down
[1:49:00] and burns out all the desire of sin
[1:49:05] hello
[1:49:07] people used to love to drink
[1:49:09] love to party
[1:49:11] lived for it spent their checks on it
[1:49:16] people love to gamble
[1:49:19] they'll spend their whole paycheck with
[1:49:21] it for it
[1:49:22] they love pornography
[1:49:24] they'll spin their whole paycheck on
[1:49:27] them magazines and internet websites
[1:49:31] oh they love video games and they'll
[1:49:34] spend all of their time with that and
[1:49:36] all their energy
[1:49:37] they love the things materialistic
[1:49:40] things and look where they put all their
[1:49:42] time invest their money and invest all
[1:49:44] of it
[1:49:45] Church set still everything just just
[1:49:48] comes to a halt when it comes to God
[1:49:51] why because that love is there
[1:49:55] out in the world
[1:49:57] can you say man
[1:49:58] watch he comes and burns the desire of
[1:50:02] it out
[1:50:03] all the nature of the world
[1:50:05] therefore he that sins willfully after
[1:50:08] receiving the knowledge of truth then
[1:50:10] then again the Bible says it's
[1:50:12] impossible for a man that's born of God
[1:50:15] cannot sin he does not sin there's no
[1:50:20] way for him to sin how can he be a
[1:50:22] sinner and redeemed at the same time how
[1:50:25] can I be in the pawn shop and be out of
[1:50:28] the pawn shop at the same time oh he
[1:50:31] redeemed Us by his blood by his Spirit
[1:50:33] he cleansed us and then comes to dwell
[1:50:36] in us the church not the denomination
[1:50:38] now the church
[1:50:40] so notice what David says he restoreth
[1:50:45] my soul
[1:50:48] I'm not in the pawn shop no more
[1:50:50] I'm not a slave to sin anymore I'm not a
[1:50:54] in bondage to fear anymore can you say
[1:50:57] man so this restoration begins in the
[1:51:00] soul and that is by the new birth
[1:51:01] quickening power can you say man now
[1:51:05] notice as as we get ready to wind down
[1:51:08] Jehovah's Witness talks about the breath
[1:51:11] and they say you know that that the
[1:51:14] breath of you that you breathe is the
[1:51:16] soul but that's not true
[1:51:19] see brother Brown says if that be true
[1:51:23] then your one time you're one kind of a
[1:51:26] soul the next time you're somebody else
[1:51:28] and has breathed that soul
[1:51:31] and look where you'd be
[1:51:33] breath is the wind and wind is what you
[1:51:36] breathe into your nostrils
[1:51:39] ain't that right
[1:51:40] if the breath that you breathe is your
[1:51:43] soul then every animal is a living Soul
[1:51:46] because they breathe a human soul and
[1:51:49] our soul and all together
[1:51:51] if breath is your soul right
[1:51:55] but he says then Jesus wouldn't have had
[1:51:58] to Die the animal sacrifice wouldn't
[1:52:01] have been or would have been sufficient
[1:52:06] but notice what Genesis 2 7 says and the
[1:52:10] Lord God formed a Man Out of the Dust of
[1:52:13] the ground and breathed into his
[1:52:16] nostrils
[1:52:18] the Breath of Life
[1:52:20] and Man became a living soul
[1:52:24] notice God breathed the breath of
[1:52:28] eternal life
[1:52:29] then Man became a living soul
[1:52:33] a soul that cannot die
[1:52:37] oh see he breathed the breath of eternal
[1:52:41] life into his nostrils and he became an
[1:52:45] eternal soul
[1:52:48] and brother Brown said yes Adam died but
[1:52:52] remember before he died he had a lamb
[1:52:55] that redeemed him
[1:52:58] can you say Amen
[1:53:00] God got a lamb to redeem them why
[1:53:04] for whom he foreknow he also called and
[1:53:09] Justified and glorified
[1:53:11] So Adam was breathing the breath of the
[1:53:15] Eternal God for he was a son of God
[1:53:21] listen
[1:53:25] brother Bram goes on to say the Church
[1:53:27] of God is born by the Breath of God
[1:53:31] God breathed breath into the nostril
[1:53:34] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:53:36] living soul
[1:53:37] and the true Pentecostal church is born
[1:53:39] of the Breath of God
[1:53:41] ain't that right
[1:53:43] John 20 21 then said Jesus to them again
[1:53:46] peace be unto you as my father has sent
[1:53:49] me even so sinned I you
[1:53:52] and when he had said this he breathed on
[1:53:54] them and saith unto them receive ye the
[1:53:57] Holy Ghost brother Brown said he
[1:53:59] breathed on them the promise
[1:54:03] thy Lord amen that's why it's important
[1:54:07] to preach the promise
[1:54:09] that's why we needed a prophet in this
[1:54:11] age with thus said the Lord
[1:54:15] can you say amen he said see now the
[1:54:18] African word for wind is a Moya
[1:54:21] remember brother I'm talking about that
[1:54:23] which means the wind and unseen Force he
[1:54:27] said animals breathe the Moya
[1:54:29] Sinners breathe a Moya
[1:54:32] but God especially upon Adam breathed
[1:54:35] the breath of eternal life and he become
[1:54:37] an eternal person with god listen he had
[1:54:41] power like God he was an amateur God he
[1:54:45] was God of the earth not God Of Heaven
[1:54:47] now but God of the earth and someday the
[1:54:50] sons of God will again become gods
[1:54:56] oh if we could understand where we're
[1:54:59] living at today
[1:55:03] oh don't get quiet on me
[1:55:06] don't let the devil take you away listen
[1:55:09] to what I'm saying
[1:55:11] they're going to come Gods again
[1:55:14] sons of God will be Gods again I believe
[1:55:17] with all my heart we're here at that
[1:55:19] position again in adoption
[1:55:24] we're at a place where the devil don't
[1:55:26] know what to do with us
[1:55:29] can you say Amen
[1:55:31] see someday the sons of God will again
[1:55:34] become Gods Jesus said so is it not
[1:55:37] written in your law you are Gods then if
[1:55:39] he can call you those if you if you can
[1:55:42] call those who he called God who God
[1:55:44] visited how can you condemn me and say
[1:55:47] or when I say I'm the Son of God so
[1:55:50] notice the spiritual man has a spiritual
[1:55:53] soul that can never die
[1:55:55] and the carnal man has a religious
[1:55:57] atmosphere around him and wants to
[1:56:00] worship and so forth but it's carnal not
[1:56:02] an unbeliever but a carnal believer and
[1:56:05] that's the kind that was rejected but
[1:56:07] you are a new creation
[1:56:12] you are a new creation of God
[1:56:15] ain't that right
[1:56:17] we did not become seed by rebirth we
[1:56:19] were seed him therefore we were Reborn
[1:56:22] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:56:25] because we received as the reason we
[1:56:28] could be quickened can you say Amen in
[1:56:30] unseat there's nothing to Quicken
[1:56:32] they'll just continue on being religious
[1:56:34] but I pray that every one of us has a
[1:56:37] quickening
[1:56:40] that God could breathe the Breath of
[1:56:42] Life
[1:56:43] can you say Amen
[1:56:45] oh do you love him
[1:56:47] we could go on and on
[1:56:49] other people being anointed Amen in
[1:56:52] their flesh anointed in their Spirit but
[1:56:54] they're not anointed to the word
[1:56:56] a man because the soul is the gene seed
[1:57:00] can you say Amen
[1:57:02] amen that's right see they're not in
[1:57:04] order of the word but he says they're
[1:57:05] real ordained of God that real Gene that
[1:57:08] real germ of a a soul of God that was in
[1:57:12] God before the foundation of the world
[1:57:13] see now that's the one that can be quick
[1:57:15] and that's the thing that's being
[1:57:17] restored amen he said like a baby when
[1:57:20] it enters into the womb of its mother it
[1:57:22] comes by a little germ and crawls into
[1:57:25] the egg he said it doesn't form one cell
[1:57:27] a human the next a dog and the next the
[1:57:30] cat and the next the horse that's not
[1:57:32] what this restoration is
[1:57:35] it's all human cells
[1:57:38] because it's building off of an original
[1:57:41] human cell
[1:57:44] you understand what I'm saying
[1:57:45] it's not part Son of God part church
[1:57:48] member part this and part that
[1:57:54] oh God
[1:57:56] you wasn't born a human being with an
[1:57:58] intelligence of an ape
[1:58:02] with the face of a giraffe
[1:58:05] and legs like a hippo
[1:58:09] no you came from a human Sail
[1:58:12] and it was human sale adding to human
[1:58:14] sale and human sale adding to human sale
[1:58:17] till it formed a baby
[1:58:21] right
[1:58:23] and when a man has been born again by
[1:58:26] the word of God predestinated to eternal
[1:58:29] life called the elected
[1:58:31] it'll be word of God on top of word word
[1:58:35] on Word
[1:58:37] that's what's building the sons of God
[1:58:40] word on top of word on top of word on
[1:58:43] top of word give me the word
[1:58:48] can you say Amen not a denominational
[1:58:50] Creed and then a word and a Creed and it
[1:58:53] won't work you can't have that leaven in
[1:58:56] it only one eternal life in Jesus Christ
[1:58:59] the word can you say man in the
[1:59:02] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:59:04] God see where your origin starts with
[1:59:06] the word of God the Eternal thought of
[1:59:09] God can you say Amen see and you've come
[1:59:12] down here as a fallen attribute but
[1:59:13] there was a word seed laying down inside
[1:59:17] of you
[1:59:19] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:59:21] was with God the Word was God and the
[1:59:24] Word was made flesh
[1:59:26] and dwelt Among Us
[1:59:28] oh isn't he wonderful
[1:59:31] oh my my if the musicians will come I
[1:59:34] pray it's been a help to you tonight
[1:59:36] word on top of word word on top of word
[1:59:40] amen amen amen Hebrews 6 1. through six
[1:59:45] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:59:47] doctrine of Christ let us go unto
[1:59:50] perfection
[1:59:52] not laying again the foundation of
[1:59:54] repentance from dead Works into Faith
[1:59:57] toward god of the doctrine of baptism
[1:59:59] and of laying on of hands and of
[2:00:02] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[2:00:04] judgment and this will we do if God
[2:00:06] permit
[2:00:08] listen for it is impossible for those
[2:00:10] who were once enlightened and have
[2:00:12] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[2:00:14] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[2:00:16] have tasted the good word of God and the
[2:00:19] powers of the world to come if they
[2:00:20] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[2:00:24] repentance now you know what the prophet
[2:00:25] says about that
[2:00:27] it ain't talking about someone that is
[2:00:29] part took of all that and then and then
[2:00:32] left and now they can't come back
[2:00:35] Rob said that don't mean that at all
[2:00:38] Prophet says it's impulse further to go
[2:00:40] back
[2:00:42] you can never come a sinner again
[2:00:47] that's just how secure you are
[2:00:54] say brother Brown said now he goes now
[2:00:58] he's beginning to talk about what is it
[2:00:59] let's go on to perfection
[2:01:04] not laying not Colonel laying the
[2:01:07] foundation here of doctrines baptism
[2:01:09] reformations and so forth let's not do
[2:01:11] that let's go into Perfection the
[2:01:13] subject is perfection
[2:01:16] and Perfection comes by Christ
[2:01:21] how did we get in Christ by joining the
[2:01:24] church
[2:01:25] by one Spirit we're all baptized in one
[2:01:27] body not by one tongue talked in one C
[2:01:32] shook one shook hand hand shook in and
[2:01:35] you know water baptized in but by one
[2:01:38] Spirit we're baptized into one body you
[2:01:40] get it and that's the perfection
[2:01:45] aren't you glad for that see we are then
[2:01:48] perfect through Christ
[2:01:50] and we are free from judgment through
[2:01:52] Christ we shall never die through Christ
[2:01:56] we have lost death and found life
[2:01:58] through Christ not through any church
[2:02:01] not through any denomination not through
[2:02:03] any fantastic not through speaking with
[2:02:06] tongues shouting shaking or dancing in
[2:02:09] the spirit but by grace
[2:02:15] restoreth my soul
[2:02:18] Hallelujah
[2:02:21] I love the Lord
[2:02:24] for the brand says see it's not him that
[2:02:27] wants to be saved not him that willeth
[2:02:28] or him that runeth it's God that showeth
[2:02:31] Mercy
[2:02:33] and no man can come to Jesus except God
[2:02:36] draws him first
[2:02:38] so what you got to do with it anyhow you
[2:02:41] haven't got nothing to do with it you
[2:02:43] are out of the picture all together
[2:02:49] you say well how do I know the grace of
[2:02:51] God
[2:02:51] you know it was the grace the prophet
[2:02:53] said it was Grace to us that God sent us
[2:02:55] a prophet
[2:02:57] and I'm going to just go further because
[2:02:58] why would God send the prophet if the
[2:03:01] elect doesn't hear it
[2:03:03] so I say it's also Grace that God would
[2:03:06] bring us to this message
[2:03:10] yes the grace of God I believe that
[2:03:12] young people can grow up in this message
[2:03:15] it's the grace of God that we can hear
[2:03:18] the message
[2:03:19] foreign
[2:03:23] God loves you that's his love
[2:03:27] look at the world today look at people
[2:03:30] and don't even know
[2:03:32] what we know
[2:03:36] look at the people in the world today
[2:03:38] all their hope is in a politician
[2:03:41] all their hope is in what some church
[2:03:44] tells them
[2:03:45] and you say man
[2:03:48] and church you know there's so many
[2:03:51] these so-called ministers standing you
[2:03:54] know getting on YouTube prophesying
[2:03:56] revivals come in the great move is
[2:03:59] coming
[2:04:01] and all the people following
[2:04:05] but here we are Grace to us that God
[2:04:07] would send a prophet
[2:04:10] and let us know what time that we're
[2:04:12] living in and we know the time it is
[2:04:15] lift up your head
[2:04:17] your Redemption draweth mine
[2:04:21] that's Grace
[2:04:23] you love him can you lift your hands
[2:04:25] into the Lord and worship me
[2:04:28] oh he's so wonderful to us
[2:04:32] I thank God for his love to us
[2:04:36] how else can our soul be restored
[2:04:40] it couldn't be restored by Creeds it
[2:04:42] could not be restored by ideologies of
[2:04:45] men
[2:04:46] it couldn't be restored by money in the
[2:04:49] bank it couldn't be restored by nothing
[2:04:51] else God would send a prophet because
[2:04:53] our origin came from the word
[2:04:56] and God would build that bright word on
[2:05:00] top of word on top of word on top of
[2:05:03] word
