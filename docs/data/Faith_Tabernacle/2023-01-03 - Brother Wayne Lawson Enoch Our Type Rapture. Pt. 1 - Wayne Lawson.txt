Conference with Brother Scott and Lighthouse Tabernacle and and we covered uh the Rapture a little bit from what what prophet taught on it and um and that's it's been several years back some of you may have been there during that time we just just been uh did another one out in Branson Missouri and the lord gave me some things uh on it and I actually re redid pretty much the entire series uh and just a little bit deeper and a little bit of different directions and and looking into it and we've just been praying about we've got three four five nights here in a row so I thought it might be okay if I share some of those things with y'all it is it would you think it'd be okay I know um I know you're interested in the Rapture I know we're all interested in the Rapture amen that's our that's our view and amen I do want to say God bless you and thank you all for being here tonight and this hey man it's a real blessing brother Mark I didn't even get a chance to shake your hand last night and

we'd love to heard from him tonight and sing it and he's been a real blessing and I I just uh it's always such a blessing to see the children of God gather together and Saints of light precious faith and hearts and I've seen Haley's setting back there in a crowd back there God bless you and Tanya and amen I remember a long time ago when that doctor said there wasn't no way amen she'd ever have that baby and there she stands holding one's night amen there's a there's a sign that there's a miracle working God Amen right in the midst of us amen and amen is Mercy and do you love him tonight amen isn't he a mighty God it's just about our hearts for a moment father it is certainly an honor to be here tonight with your children and Lord the brother Sean would have a confidence to bring us here and to put us in this platform to be able to speak on things and Lord not just an evangelistical service or just a a thought but Lord he's open to complete Liberty and these doctrinal areas and Lord about these things of the Rapture and and Lord we have a complete Liberty to teach your word here and and father we thank you for a man of God that believes these things and stands for them Lord and and we ask that you would encourage and strengthen him and Lord this entire congregation and all that is gathered here the the men of God that stand with him and Lord those here in the area that Lord that make it possible that the children of God hear this message and lord they're they're taught it on a basis Lord we need to ask you now that you would just come in and lead us Lord take this meeting and use it for your glory now we pray in Jesus name amen and amen and amen and God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight we'd like to go into first Thessalonians chapter four uh and we'll just read from there amen first Thessalonians chapter 4. I'd like to bring you greetings from Brother Erickson and the church there true word Tabernacle and amen uh first Thessalonians chapter 4. for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord we ask the Lord to bless his word tonight shake somebody's hand and have yourself a seed and amen y'all pray for us and amen I want to if I can to speak to you a little bit tonight on this subject and uh we have a little bit of things to share with you and uh and uh so we just want to get right into it if it's okay with you I believe that this specific subject of the Rapture is my favorite subject it's my favorite subject to talk about it's my favorite favorite subject to preach about uh because I believe uh that this is the generation of of the Rapture and I believe it's the time that we have and I believe it's supposed to be taking place I believe we're the generation for this to happen and uh so we're we're trusting tonight that something could be said and that would be a blessing to it and I just happened to look back here and sing Barry Coffey said it was you in here when I walked out no okay I was gonna say man I completely missed him God bless you brother Barry amen it's good to have him here tonight I actually heard a little bit of your sermon there at Brother Paul's the other day and I was going to text you today and tell you how much I enjoyed it I I don't know if you all have heard it but he talked a little bit about the time of Esther and the delay uh that that she had to wait and I thought that was phenomenal brother Berry it was a blessing amen it really blessed our heart and God bless you for that amen and uh I think it's a tremendous thing to see that God has delays for a reason and as a church waiting on a Rapture uh it sure helps to explain sometimes why we've been so long between the time that a prophet preached something and uh to the time that we're living now amen and uh so God's not slack concerned his promises now when you think about Rapture tonight you have something that you think about when someone says to you the word rapture you there's there's there's a definition that comes there's a thought there's something that rises up in your mind and you think Rapture now if you're if you're if you're listening to that word now there's a a myriad of ideas and many conclusions that will pre-exist uh brother random speaking on the subject of the Rapture uh there's right now in the world we're living there's movies there's sermons there's books there's media there's words it's like a rain or a flood of ideas concerning the Rapture if you do much secular studying on the Rapture most everyone will tell you that it's pretty much a 20th century doctrine that is not something that was taught much in the early ages up throughout the church ages but it but but most people will say they're in the charismatic and Pentecostal moving that that's where the that's where the main thrust of lots of people talking about something was during that time and so of course it's been in the Bible the whole time but it's when it's become a part of the focus and so there's so many so much being said about it now so many people so that of course everyone has a different definition concerning this and uh I think if there's a there's a I think if there's a word and there's a need then God has a way to define something and there has to be an authority on that definition and so what we needed to as a church was a definitive Revelation or a definitive uh a definition concerning the Rapture to know what is the expectation of the church now the word rapture brother Bram says is not even in the Bible it's not even used at all and we just put that word in there but the Bible actually says caught up or being caught up and we read in first Thessalonians it is order of the great Rapture that will take place in the last days now of course when we read first thesalonians in chapter 4 and verse 17 you'll find out the Bible says and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up so that's where the word the Rapture is put in scripture is that they that alive and remains shall have Rapture Brothers actually talks about the difference between catching up and being caught up he's you know a man so catching up and caught up but there'll be a Rapture now if you go to the definition of the actual word rapture or the root meaning of the of the of the word we use Rapture it's derived from a middle French word rapture or a medieval Latin raptura which means a seizure or a kidnapping which derives from the Latin raptus a carrying off so if we're going to define the word rapture we're going to Define it as a seizure as a kidnapping or a carrying off now this is a little different than what many people use about the Rapture because a lot of people are thinking the Rapture is something that if you work hard enough you're going to get to be a part of it but what brother Branham was representing to the church or saying to the church is that this is more of a kidnapping or a seizing or a carrying off of something that belongs to God it's not something where that if you pray hard enough or you fast hard enough or that you're going to get to be a part of this but one solid point that William Branham made over and over and over is that the Rapture is by election and predestination according to Matthew 25 there are five wise virgins so this is not someone that we can just uh we could if we just jump hard enough or we work hard enough or if we pray hard enough that we're going to get to be a part of this but this Rapture is for an elected people amen God is not going to be unjust in kidnapping somebody else's kid he's just going to take his own children home amen that's what's about to happen destruction is falling upon this Earth and God is going to take his own children home I say this that God Amen is is going to carry off amen it it changes the way you view that automatically doesn't that God's going to carry somebody off or he's going to see someone or he's going to catch him or he's going to take a hold of them look in John 6 44 or brother random uses this over and over throughout his ministry that no man can come to me except the Father which sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day amen uh the word there draw him actually means to drag off amen by an inward power and isn't that powerful it's so much different than what we would think that if we if we could work our way into this if we could do it somehow amen it be done but do you recognize that this is not at all that way this is a work of the grace of almighty God for a seed that has been ordained before the world has ever begun the Rapture is for those who are in the Lamb's Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life is not names being added to it and it's not names being taken from it but it's those that are already elected upon it amen now this is a dragging off a seizing a kidnapping of those who have their names already written in that book I want to start up by saying this brother Branham says this we believe there will be a Rapture and all Christians believe that the Bible readers that pair will be a Rapture Amen brother Brandon believe there's a Rapture I believe there's a Rapture and anybody that believes the Bible believes there's going to be a Rapture now there's a lot of people with a lot of ideas and brother Adam says it like this I'm not up here trying to just say something I think that's going to uh maybe please the people he said but I'm going to take a different Avenue and I've always loved this paragraph 30. he said I'm going to take a different Avenue and boy many Bible teachers will approach the Rapture of the church he said or the catching away he was going to approach it differently now if you think about this amen since the time that Paul wrote about the Rapture in first Thessalonians 4 Paul said it's according to the word of the Lord I say unto you by the word of the Lord which he's speaking of Revelation because there's nothing in the Old Testament that actually speaks about the Rapture per se but but Paul is putting together Elijah and Enoch and the resurrection and he's taken all that together in a revelation and putting it together and saying I say unto you by the word of the Lord then then again in the book of Corinthians he'll call it a mystery so what we're looking at then is that that Paul is teaching this in scripture but from the time of Paul unto the time of William Branham what we have is a lot of different ideas being spoken about something amen without an understanding of what they're talking about so all these ideas the root bases of them come from what Paul said but this denomination took it this way and that denomination took it another way but according to Malachi chapter 4 the Bible said the Lord would return the children back to the faith of their Apostolic fathers or the Pentecostal fathers uh Revelations 10 and verse 7 says the seventh angel which is the seventh angel of the laodicean Church of Revelations 3 the seven star are of Revelations 1 that his ministry would be to unfold The Mystery of the Bible in the end time which would restore what Paul said in the beginning somebody said well it might be something different than Paul had then Paul was wrong when he said if an angel would come from heaven and say any other thing then what I have said let him be a curse so Paul had put the Revelation there now just as Jesus amen come out of the scripture he began as the woman's seed in Genesis 3 and then became Abraham's seed in Genesis 12 and Genesis 15. it was only an unfolding of the original word that was spoken what Paul spoke originally was not fully made known or revealed in the days of Paul but under the Seven Seals there would come a full revelation of the rapturing of the church which would be the ministry of the seventh angel or Elijah which by Grace we have today by Divine vindication we know that man's name is William Miriam Branham there's no question in our heart God has Vindicated this ministry and proved it to us and he had a right to take a different avenue than the Baptist did than the Pentecostals did than the Lutheran did amen and he took an Avenue come on Church The Avenues of denomination would not lead you to the Rapture in other words they're not uncovering a path that's going to lead you to the Rapture but if you'll stay with a message of this hour the prophet of God has revealed a path that will lead this church back to an even condition and we will walk from one dimension to another on the Avenue that has been preached by the message of Malachi 4. somebody said brother Wayne this guy's going this way and this guy's going this way which way are you going to go I'm going to stay with the message of Malachi 4. I'm going to walk the path that William Branham taught us to walk that's where I'm walking that's where I'm staying and you say preacher amen what about things that are coming up well by God's grace we took the last corner of redemption amen justification Made A Way sanctification we made a corner didn't we baptism the Holy Ghost we made a corner back there in Azusa but then the word returned to the church and the last Corner was made and I say today that there is no there's nothing between the bride and the Rapture today I don't know when it'll take place but I know this when we get there we'll get there by the word of the Lord according to Malachi 4 in the last days now I know there's going to come something to upset this there always is when the prophet preaches the Rapture he begins by saying know this verse scoffers shall come in the last day he spends the first 20 minutes of the Rapture take talking about scoffers and he's showing you the reason that there will become scoffers is because they're looking back to what denominations have said about the Rapture so when the truth on the Rapture came they have all these different doctors and Dr so-and-so said this and this man said this and this professor said this and so they're going to scoff at this man with such a low-grade education having this idea of the Rapture that's been ministered to him by an Angel so the prophet of God said the scripture says as it was in the days of Moses the scripture says they'll come in the last days again Janice and Chambers wished Moses so with these men of reprobate mind concerning truth impersonations and everything to upset these people now notice this scoffer shall come that's the book of Peter right now we're in the book of Timothy so he shows the scoffers in the book of Peter are also the impersonators in the book of Timothy now somebody said how is impersonation how is that scoffing I'll tell you how it is in the days of Moses when God sent Moses in the first Exodus to take I've prepared people into the out of the Egypt you remember what happened Moses's first sign is he throw down a staff and it turned into a serpent now he had done that in the presence of God and God sinning to deliver the people and I'm sure Moses thought if I throw down this staff it turns to a serpent everybody's going to follow me and out we're going to go but as soon as he threw down his staff amen there was some magicians stood up beside him and did the same very thing and this is what hardened the heart of pharaoh and it devalued what Moses was doing and made it look like any cheap magician trick so the impersonators actually were scoffing and devaluing what the prophet was doing and it reduced the value of that sign that was being made so the Bible tells us that Pharaoh's heart was hardened by the scoffing see amen he didn't believe it because anybody could do it now the prophet is clear and I don't want to take a lot of time but I think it's powerful he said where did those uh he said where did those other where did those other sticks end up he said Moses is sticks ate them is that right they swallowed them up amen it's like he said there was a group of Ohio ministers wrote me the other day and he said they got on to me for preaching amen predestinated sons and he said they said well that we've seen guys that were saved and they went and done this and we've seen guys that were saved and done that how can you say that when a man was saved he's always saved and brother Bram said well see he said but where did they end up at he said there was an original before that was the impersonation he said but you're looking at the impersonation saying there's no real thing he said but see the real the empire impersonation is swallowed up in the real do you hear what I'm saying to you amen the the real was first the other is only an impersonation of the real but it's given to cause a mocking and an intimidation so you won't preach the message every hour it'll make people back away from believing the message and devalue the word of a prophet amen but I thank God Amen that if the Satan's gonna throw something in the way of God God has another level for the church and every time the devil ever tried to follow God he just swallowed him up and brother Adam says see what it is all these things but this Rapture which is coming to pass anything that God has in the line of his word there's always something to come out and upset that it's Satan's purpose to do it it's Satan's purpose to do it see now watch in in anything too hard for the Lord Brother man says sometimes when things are going wrong We Know by Nature it's the darkest before the day and many times we see during disastrous things like that especially to Believers we must bear this in our mind it's Satan trying to block the blessing that's on the road listen why is all these isms rise up in the message of the hour and to your point I honestly almost text you today beautiful thought on delay it allowed time for the seeds all to come out why is all the isms why is everybody seem like they have their own Direction now it's either they're in one ditch or the other amen half of the I'm not trying to be a a a critical it just seems like people are one ditch or the other what happened to just preaching the message of the hour what happened to just saying what the prophet said and then let the grace of God lead the church into the into the Rapture see sometimes amen it seems like amen that Satan is doing these things to brought the blessing to get the people's minds on this thought or on that thought or is this guy riders that guy right amen I think we ought to just all stand up together and say we're all wrong the message is Right amen we're all wrong the message is right let's just follow the message of the hour amen I have young ministers ask me I said brother Wayne what do you think about this teaching what do you think about that teaching I said I think if you'll study the message and just preach the message what God reveals you'll be a blessed man that's what I believe and I know that we are to know scoffers are coming we ought to know that it's in the scripture that there's men that have been raised up to intimidate people by the mocking of the truth they'll scoff it they'll mock it they'll make fun of it and by doing so they're intimidating you to not follow after it that's exactly y'all know what I'm talking about and the funny thing is is look at those that are talking it's funny Tanya sometime ago Chris and I were down at the mall and we're walking down the mall and I see two old girls standing over there I shouldn't say it like that two women standing there and there and they they look like they walked through a jewelry store with a magnet on they got earrings from the top I mean they just pierced all up and the hair colored weird and hey man one of them I better not get into all this but anyhow they ain't got enough clothes on the water shotgun and and they're standing it's a horrible sight and I'm standing off to the side kind of waiting on my wife to come out of the store and when she come out both of them just turned and looked at her like she was the weirdest thing that had ever hit the planet and I thought that is the oddest thing to me that is looking at that is weird somebody changed normal I mean your normal used to be a certain way and somebody changed normal but now you're going to Market to intimidate people to not follow after the word of God well I'm not intimidated I'm not intimidated you can mock me you can mop this message you can mock the way of life I am not intimidated by mocking amen I will believe this message see because the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's been revealed to her the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for this revelation of the Rapture now it is a Rapture of the Revelation we'll be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture now I don't mean to intrude on anybody's ideas but I'll just say this amen if you're studying the message and you want to know what the revelation of the Rapture is brother Ram says here in paragraph 65 we're waiting on the Revelation and many people stopped right there and now they're still waiting on the Revelation if you will just continue reading a couple Pages he takes first Thessalonians 4 and divides the Rapture into three parts a shout of voice of trump the Rapture Revelation is the message is the shout the people become the voice of the message by moving into the Flesh and then when that flesh has been brought by the word there's a carrying away of the Bride it's a shout it's a voice it's a trump right it's the Revelation it's a revelation and that Revelation is Faith now you cannot have Revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that is revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that you could call anything contrary to what had been called revealed as though it was not see Faith that's what faith is it's the revelation of God the church is built upon the revelation of the entire body it's faith faith is a revelation somebody said well brother Wayne Amen I think there's a revelation coming brother banham says it like this he said now listen he said the first poll was a healing the second pull is a prophesying the third pull is the opening of the word the Mysteries that are revealed now there is no more higher order to reveal the word than a prophet and the only way a prophet can be Vindicated is Bible word and remember the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word so either we have received the Revelation for Rapture or we're waiting for a prophet to come and give it well I don't believe we're waiting for a prophet to return I believe it's already in the word amen now somebody I better explain this because I can feel it somebody said well brother Wayne how in the world could you get that you remember when God came to Elijah he gave him three things didn't he he commissioned him to do three things how many knows what Elijah did he only did one of those things and then he anointed Elisha's the only part he did and Elisha fulfilled the next part and Elisha himself didn't even fulfill the next part somebody he anointed went and done it himself so but it all came to Elijah and all of it came to a prophet but the prophet might not even be here when it is fulfilled but it's came to him and now it's coming into the Church of the Living God now this Rapture we're talking about is only for the bride the Rapture other people are talking about is probably for anybody the Rapture we're talking about is for the bride is that right the bride the one that's going to be in the Rapture is nothing but the bride the elected ones the foreknown of God from the beginning the father's spiritual genes now that's how God's Gonna kidnap somebody he's taking his own kids he's taking it it's not somebody else's son it's God's son that he's taken it's his own children and he's taken this is the problem many people around the message get caught up in this because the Rapture is only for the bride so then they get to thinking salvation is only for the bride that's the problem there's a lot of people that'll be saved has nothing to do with this Rapture but the Rapture is for the elected and the Bible said the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years and then they'll come up in the great white judgment right and then been judged out of the books and many of them will be saved Matthew 25 said they'll be separated left and right even people who were never had a new birth will be there because they were good to the Brethren right so there's a lot of people saved that don't even know about the message so don't treat them like that they're they're junk they might be a penny in your silver dollar don't worry about them being a penny just thank God he made you a silver dollar this this focus on the idea of what you are but if you hear somebody in the message preaching it almost sounds like we don't believe anybody else will be saved well we really don't believe that or at least anybody that studies brother Branham don't really believe that because he said the blanket covers a lot more than you think it does right but we're talking about the Rapture the Rapture amen somebody said well what amen there's actually in the mouth of three Witnesses let everything be established there's three that bear record Amen in the Old Testament we have Enoch amen remember we have Elijah and then we have Jesus so there's three raptures in the Old Testament now I want to maybe say this there's three of them and and the Rapture in the Old Testament can I just take one of them for a little while tonight Enoch is our type I I love Enoch Enoch is a tremendous character if you like to study Enoch how many knows Enoch is a type of the raptured church in the end time sure Enoch is a type of the Rapture church now if he's going to be my type I want to know what does the man's name mean if he's my type you know the prophet said you'll never outlive your type so what kind of type is he his very name has a meaning so brother Amos we ask the question what does the name Enoch mean it means dedicated trained and disciplined now that's pretty powerful isn't it amen the very name of Enoch means dedicated trained and disciplined amen this bride will be dedicated to a message trained by a message and disciplined by a message now that'd be about a three-hour sermon if I had time to preach it tonight but dedicated trained and disciplined dedication time y'all heard the sermon brother man preached dedication time that was the time you built the temple there's a Time the word come in the temple amen there's a Time the temple is dedicated right now we're here dedicating ourselves to a message that's already come we're not trying to wait for a message we're not trying to create a message we're dedicating our lies to a message and we're disciplined by it amen and we're trained by it I I'd like to preach a whole sermon right now dedicated trained and disciplined training y'all know what I'm talking about child training for the placing of sons that's exactly what the prophet says now in Genesis chapter 5 we'll read this in the 18th verse and Jared lived 162 years and he begot Enoch and Jared lived after he began to Enoch 800 years and begot sons and daughters and all the days of Jared with 960 in two years and he died and he not lived 60 in five years and begot Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah 300 years and he begot Sons and Daughters now that's an important thing to me he begots Sons and Daughters 300 years of life and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God that's the second time that it says this and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him that's a pretty good way of saying it isn't it God took him to the definition of what we believe Rapture is God took him amen he was walking with God and God took him he caught him he seized him he meant he stole him away out of the middle of things because he's your type amen he took him amen don't you think God is snatching this bride out of the hands of this evil and wicked generation he snatched you like a like a man snatches a child out of a fire God has snatched us out of laodicea he's snatching us out out of denominationalism God is snatching now you've been leaving one take him one thank God he's taking the church amen he walked with God and God took him amen and God took him in Hebrews 11 and 5 New Testament Paul talks of this figure and he said by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death now there's brother Adam's Revelation the Rapture is a revelation by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him and before his translation I got to say that again before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God what's the next verse without faith it is impossible to please God so whatever Enoch needed for translation he had it before translation is that right he had it before translation and whatever the bride needs I'm talking about your type whatever the bride I need she will have to have it before translation she has to have faith before translation how many knows that Jesus always done that which pleased the father brother Brown said God's going to raise up a child until he gets one that pleases the father now we're talking about adoption aren't we so Enoch's faith is Jesus Faith it's also abrahamic faith and that is the faith that is the faith that God is restored in this age unto the message of Malachi 4. if you don't have faith where does faith come Faith cometh by the hearing and by the hearing of the word of God wraps your faith is not coming through CNN Rapture faith is not coming through Fox News Rapture faith is not coming through your local denominational Church Rapture faith is a revelation that is released under the message of this hour and by God's grace there is a five-fold Ministry and it's been raised up under this messenger I know we're in a generation they don't even want us to preach anymore I get it but let me say this amen we finally have a group of ministers that have something to preach they finally have a message to preach amen I believe in all of my heart that this bride is perfected under the word preached in the hour of the that we're leaving today without faith it is impossible to please brother man said God will keep raising one till he gets one that pleases God Amen what is it it's a pleasing that this Rapture is a revelation he had it before his translation he had it before his translation I think that's a powerful thing church he had it before his translation I'll get to the point in the morning Jude 1 and 14 Jude writes of Enoch and said Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied now watch this Enoch the seventh from Adam now there's your timing of the church Enoch is the seventh from Adam we are the seventh from the second Adam that first Enoch took the Rapture being the seventh showing that allowed to see a church takes the Rapture is that right the bride comes out of the loudest seal church you can read Revelations 3 as well as I and the Bible tells you the condition of laodicea and John has no way out of laodicea until he hears the voice and says come up here John and the door opened up in heaven it was the word that gave him a way out watch this every other age they went from one age to another brother Mark they just kept changing ages but when it come to the seventh age there wasn't anywhere to go all remember Revelations 18 4 called you out of laodicea but you can't go out to another age the bride's going out of layout to see it into the rapturing of the church amen I believe I believe this message is calling the bride to change bodies we're not being called to go to another church age we're not being called Amen to just build another church or build a kingdom or just preach a message we're being called to walk with God and our bodies might be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we're the seventh from Adam the second item showing us we are at the time I'm Vindicated tonight to say I believe this is a generation to do it the timing is here the message is here we are on the scene hey can I say this Sister Kim the troubles here the scoffer's in place right they're everywhere scoffers are everywhere I meant that the scriptures are true everybody's in their place well the bride getting in position is the time of change y'all know the adoption the fullness of adoption is the change of the body right it's the fullness of it it's the change of the body Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied to these things preached these things prophesied preached these things isn't that powerful the man was preaching the Rapture Revelation before he changed he said the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints if you'd like to study the prophet brother random over and over said when Jesus went down and preached the souls in prison according to Visions before he ascended he descended to preached the souls in prison he said Jesus told them he said why didn't you receive me when Enoch preached of me why didn't you take me when Enoch was preaching to preacher what are you talking about he's our type scoffers shall come in the last day they will hear the message of the Rapture and scoff at it and go into judgment the same as the days of Noah Enoch preached the Rapture Revelation and they scoffed at it and went into the floods of Noah they went into the Judgment rather at an end to the Rapture of the church Enoch had the Revelation before he was changed it's a preacher what are you preaching on I'm telling you if it's your type the message has give it to us it's it's it's here and Satan's trying to distract you with everything in the world to get your eyes off that it's here it's it's right here it's here the Revelation is here it's already in the books it's already there and he's trying to get us to look this way and look this way and look at that and this is happening that's happening why that's happening amen but there's somebody going to keep their eyes somebody's going to walk somebody's going to dedicate somebody's going to translate because of the grace of God Enoch of course is a type brother Madam I'm just going to read a couple of his quotes here when we've seen Enoch was taken up he said Noah it was time to start he knew that would be a sign at the beginning of the end of the near Enoch of course was a type of the Rapture church if you take Enoch's life Enoch actually he he actually takes a Rapture 57 years after that Adam died somebody didn't like me saying that the other day that Enoch took a Rapture so I'll just call it translation I don't know folks are different aren't they hey man I'll call it translation so if somebody hears this they'll know that I was well corrected you know but he took a translation amen so but it happened 57 years after the death of Adam so can I just say it to you like this amen Adam and Enoch were on the earth 300 years together can you imagine the conversations can you imagine here is one man that walked out of the Garden of Eden and here's a man gonna walk back in here's a man in the same generation one atom came out and Enoch's gonna walk back in he's going to walk into immortality are you hearing me at the same the state they're the live at the same time God was testifying somebody came out but somebody's going to go in this bride amen she's not returning back to the Garden of Eden beaten and broken come on she's not returning that way there's been a blood that this bride can walk back into the Garden of Eden in victory robed in the blood of Jesus Christ amen I got to thinking about the other day and y'all got to forgive me I'm an old hillbilly and I get to thinking about a couple guys walking along game Trails you know and talking and fellowshipping and walking along and and Enoch's Walking with God and I you know I can just imagine him phoning uh Adam uh or maybe texting him or whatever it means a devices they had in that generation uh it was a pretty civilized place at that time uh I don't know what means they had you know but I'll say this can you imagine them getting together and Enoch explaining to Adam what experience he had with that Pillar of Fire that afternoon and he's asking him is this something like it was when you were back there in the garden can you imagine the questions of Enoch to Adam about how was The Fellowship there is it something like what's happening here with me hey man I I I got to think about this you know now this is unveindicated this is just one Lawson so y'all don't have to you don't have to carry it home you can forget it but I got to think about this I got to think about how how Enoch and Adam can you imagine maybe maybe Enoch says to Adams Adam you know we've been walking by this same place uh for days the Lord just keeps walking me by this same little little dim Trail heads up over the mountain there and you know every time we walk by there I see the Lord just kind of looks over that way you know he just keeps looking over that way what did that path look like that y'all took out of Eden what was the what was the trail what was it like can you imagine he he could literally describe to him the very thing that had happened and how it happened and what took place Enoch's Revelation was greater than you think Enoch had the revelation of the Garden of Eden he knew what happened come on church he can I just say it he had the whole thing right the bride will have the entire story before she changes Dimensions the message has gave us you'd even know what color eyes that she had who else knows that Eve was blonde-haired in blue eyed who knows it the world thinks she was a nephe Android said the most beautiful woman in the world you've been told so much in this generation you've been told so much of course Enoch is your type now the prophet of God said Enoch was a type of the real message of translation of the church brother Brandon says it like this he said God wanted to show a type how he could do it if he didn't want Enoch to die so he made a translation for him he just made a Rapture for him in case that brother's watching I want to read this for you he made a Rapture for him God had to do it in order to make a type out of Enoch in other words can you imagine this God God picture you by the market he said look I've got a bride coming to the end and I'm going to I'm going to Rapture her before they endiluvian or before the great fire falls upon the Earth and I'm going to Rapture her but to do it she's a word bride so she can't do anything that's not in the word so I'm going to use you and I'm going to translate you and you'll be the type I'll use in the end because she will have to fulfill something in the word this bride don't do things that's not in the word folks everything this bride does is in the word every step of this bride is already in the word of God we are not a headless Church come on we're not walking around without a head wondering how to handle this and how to handle this and how to handle this we've had a message among us we know how to walk we know how to talk we know how to have church we know what should be done and shouldn't be y'all know I'm telling you the truth he was a type of the raptured church Enoch want with God and had a testimony that he pleased God I like this brother bam said Enoch's whole body was transformed to make a type his whole body was transformed to make a type Enoch was a prophet ah isn't that powerful Enoch was a prophet now I had to tell you that to tell you this he knew he was a type so somebody's asked me said well how did he not know he was the type he was a prophet so he was saying he was saying the revelation of the end time and he put it in the Revelation he was preaching back there before the flood amen I I think Enoch seen all the way to the new heavens and the Earth I think he sing the whole thing you say what are you talking about Enoch knew it that the flood's coming and he had to have an example so one afternoon it was becoming to him to take a walk it was becoming to him that he should take a walk with God I think it's beautiful somehow that day they changed past instead of going around the side of the Hill God took him on the King's Highway and he just kept walking amen it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness brother Adam says it like this he said listen he said I see Enoch as he knowed it was becoming to him he was a prophet he knew what was going to happen so I can see him kiss his wife goodbye and say darling I'll see you later take up his children and kiss them goodbye and go down to his marriage son and daughter and kiss them goodbye and they said where are you going father he said are you going for a little walk he said yeah I'm going for a little stroll he said never took that old familiar path that day he took the King's Highway and went on to the glory it was becoming to him he didn't want to leave all right wow he didn't want to leave but it was becoming to him to fulfill righteousness because he was a type of the church today he said preacher what are you getting at I'm saying that he wasn't a Superman he was a normal man he had sons and daughters and he lived 300 years with a wife I'm sorry folks but a man lived 300 years with the same woman I guarantee you that was intense Fellowship manly like brother Charlie said about her about your mom he said we never had a fight one brother Ron said there's an intense Fellowship then he grew up in the house 300 years this man was not a Superman he was a normal man he was like you right he had an everyday life he's like you he had discussions he had issues he had problems he had he had blocks he had things that got in his way but every day he walked with God he every day he walked with God he had a normal life he had children he had to feed so he would have had to have worked it's the nature of God they wasn't all on vacation back there when Adam left the garden God told him remember he said you'll earn your living by the spread of your sweat of your brow so they had to work they had to make a living they had to they had to function normal life had to live had to y'all know what I'm talking about because we got this image of Enoch that he just strolled out one day and there he went away you know he didn't have no troubles he didn't have no problems there wasn't no situations that's not a Biblical image of Enoch at all you say what do you think he not was like a whole lot like you he was your type he had to overcome he had to struggle through he had to shake loose of ideas and feelings and he had to die out to decide well I am I'm mad at my neighbor I'm not going to walk with God today yeah well that old boy down there he said this about me and that guy said that about me and this person over I just can't get through it I don't think I'm gonna walk with God today but he walked With God all day every day for 365 years because he was our type telling us somebody is going to walk with God in this evil generation they're going to break through they're going to push through they're going to press through they're going to overcome they're going to put one foot in front of the other and somebody's gonna say you can't make it but they're going to go anyhow they're going to be broke or poor but they're going to go anyhow they're going to be uneducated maybe Blue Collar maybe White Collar who knows but they're going to go anyhow because it is your type it's who you are not just watching it's who you are you got to understand that God has a type you was first that was that this was first God was making a tight to represent what was going to happen amen Enoch testified of the Lord Before the Flood amen Jesus actually demonology said why didn't you listen to Enoch he was talking to the people and souls in prison why did you listen I am he that Enoch had a spiritual revelation of are you I'm the one Enoch had a spiritual revelation of all the way back there somebody said brother Wayne I don't know if Enoch really had the Revelation prior to his change maybe he maybe he got it the day he changed you know that's a good idea that's the way some people teach the message like we're going to just be living and you're you're you're you're not going to have any fellowship with God and you don't know nothing about the word but one day this Supernatural Miracle is going to happen and you're just going to step from one dimension to another wow you can live a certain way all this time and then all no he had it before he had it before and watch this brother Brandon says see God's first Bible he ever wrote was in the sky as a zodiac starts with a Virgin Goes to the line the second coming written in the first Bible the second Bible written was written by Enoch now Enoch wrote his Revelation in the pyramid before his change so he must have had it more in a day he must have had it more in two days I don't know how long it took him to Mill that pyramid but I guarantee you it was some time consuming work but he built his Revelation in the pyramid and then Vindicated his Revelation by a body change amen the pyramid is not an unvindicated message it had the Vindication of a man walking from one dimension to another now if I'm going to listen to a man it's that man the one that preached a Vindicated message that's the one I'm gonna amen I believe we're following Vindication church amen and Enoch put it in a pyramid and the third Bible were ever written was the one written in paper of course one we're reading now and all of them holds the revelation of the Rapture amen Enoch wrote it and put it in a pyramid brother Adam says he built the built it before the flood as a memorial of reason it was never destroyed in the flood isn't it amazing Enoch's pyramid was built amen probably 100 years amen after the Finish after his death amen the flood don't come for uh several years and it survived the entire flood and here we are amen uh what with three thousand years four thousand years the other side of the flood and it's still standing there it was 2140 BC they they believed the Finish date of the pyramid amen so you're you're looking at something that is a memorial that has withstood the test of time and watch it starts out as a as a as a as a pyramid and somebody says well why is it a pyramid brother man said if you'll watch the dimensions he said it'll draw you down to the very hour you're living in amen that pyramid actually it's a powerful thing it was built in a pyramid it's Enoch sign amen of the future home is that right it's not only the Rapture in it it's the future home testified of Revelations 21 what John writes of the new Heaven and the new Earth is being testified before see God don't do like we do we start and then progress God finishes and then he goes back and tells you how he got there God before he ever Justified the Earth he had the finished product in Enoch's testimony before the sanctification of the blood before the Holy Ghost purges the Earth it was already in the pyramid and before God ever started with you he started with a seed on the inside of you and then he justified it and then he Sanctified it and then he filled it with the Holy Ghost God does not work like man God begins with the finish and then Works toward it so amen that's why the Bible said he is the author and the finisher and God never started something he can't finish I don't care how long it takes God started this God will finish this and if you go before the Rapture he'll raise you up out of the ground and change your body to finish this Rapture amen I'll tell you this message is true have this pyramid coming down upon the Earth it's the Gospel Church brother man says spoken word Original Seed he said it represents what Enoch built is what's taking place it's like the god Gospel Church coming of course it starts wide in the bottom and goes to the top you got that first picture of the pyramid hey I I hijacked these off of the internet so I hope it's okay with y'all if somebody sees this and they belong to y'all please forgive me and if I had to pay for it I'll give them Sean's number you can just call the church here and he'll pay you royalties that pyramid right there is just a picture of the Pyramid of Enoch It's the Great Pyramid it's just a pyramid and brother man will say watch the capstone's not there right looking at just a nice building now if you go to that next picture you'll see that this picture shows that it's built in a way that it divides the mass of the Earth in four quarters in other words the mass of the earth is not directly in the center of the earth it divides the mass of the Earth perfectly in four quarters amen now I don't know about y'all I really don't think Enoch probably was that good of a mathematician but I'm believing the man was under some kind of inspiration hey let the one that created the Earth knew exactly how big the land masses were and set it in the right place now you see that this thing's being set in the right place gives it something of a positioning telling the church positioning is everything God knows just how to position a man a woman a church now this this next picture let's start with this one this next picture there's a lot on the pyramid I'm not going to preach to you I got a few things I want to bring to you this next picture is actually a tremendous picture it's okay if I just slow down and talk to you a minute about this okay this next picture is pretty amazing if you look down here this is the entrance that was first found when they discovered the Great Pyramid and they were they were actually treasure hunting and a lot of the pyramids back there actually were destroyed now most people who study the pyramids amen they think that it was all Egyptian but it's amazing to me that I'm just sorry but I'm the guy I believe there was more than one boat in the days of Noah but I believe he had the first one and I believe there is a lot of a lot of pyramids in Egypt right but there ain't none of them like this one so if you impersonate something you devalue it right right do you see do you see the the beginning of it now this guy that was that discovered this and blew this hole in this pyramid worked his way in he he was treasure hunting they were looking for gold and silver the thing the beautiful thing about the pyramid is that most pyramids were actually Tunes to Great Kings and they had a lot of gold in them and they were gold hunting and they were looking for them and they blowed a hole but it's amazing in this pyramid they didn't find treasures isn't it amazing the treasure that when they was disappointed when they found this because it didn't hold any gold or no silver or no monuments it wasn't rubies and it wasn't but the treasure that it held was a treasure they didn't understand see some things are a treasure above the money it's a treasure above the silver it's a treasure above the gold the message of the hour when you found it you didn't find wealth you didn't find gold but what you found was The Treasure of the understanding of the changing of our body and and inside this pyramid held the revelation of how a man walks from one dimension to another with God now it's amazing when you look at it when they entered right here of course this was the entrance but the actual entrance that they built that Enoch built was up here and when they finally discovered this entrance you can see that man began on a downward path of course I could preach a message of redemption from here but he began on a downward path now look here a little time and then man begins on a downward path showing the fall of mankind you can see it pretty plain he falls down here to a bottomless pit do you know that bottomless pit at some point it falls in it's literally done away with and there is a and emptying a paradise but you can watch this entrance right here as man comes down but look right here at this point it's called the ascending passage to the Grand Gallery right here when they first discovered this pyramid there's there's a couple Granite blocks right here in this part and they don't know this is here for a long time all they know about is this downward path but some words about Calvary man discovered that there's a place that could be unlocked and there could be a path made that a man could begin to ascend unto God Amen that path was blocked until Calvary it's beautiful that it was red granite blocks I thought it was pretty powerful but anyhow when they unblock that man begins begins to ascend unto God now here's the thing if you're studying this brother by Adam talks about the grand gallery and he talks about the steps that go up there in the Ascension passages uh when when we're when we're actually studying this you can look from a distance and see that it goes to the Grand Gallery when it gets up here it goes to this called The King's chamber which is actually an inlaid red granite there's not another tomb in Egypt that is inlaid red granite because this is not a tomb this is not a place of the Dead this is a place of the living when you start studying it actually has air vents in it but when you when you go up to this gang gallery of course you're looking at the church ages in their Ascension going up to the the the the the going up to the king's chamber uh if you go to the next if you go to the next pitcher we're going to get closer on the king's chamber as you were seeing that at the top of the Ascension pattern now brother Adam said Enoch completed this in his day or back in the day the Pyramid of course we haven't got time to background and show the pyramid come up through the chambers and so forth but it speaks right straight to the end time now theirs in the king's chamber Now by measurement so a prophet is telling you if you're looking at this picture the Church of the Living God is now to out 30 entrance we're not up in the Ascension chamber we are at the king's chamber that by measurement tells the bride where she's at in this pyramid in this generation now brother Branham will tell us in the future home he'll tell us like this he said this is what an answer Enoch sign of Egypt and pyramid of course he's talking about the new Heavens but the antelope destruction justification was coming he brought forth a sign the pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber now if you're looking at the Ascension it's got a bunch of steps and you think well what was he talking about but those steps were put in there by man but when they built the Ascension chamber there's seven layers of stone and they get you you you Builders know what that is you lay one short and then you lay the next blocks higher and you lay the next blocks higher well there's seven layers of rock that leads to the king's chamber as you're going up the Ascension when you get to the seventh it brings you to this What's called the Great step right here is the end of the Ascension chamber some some estimate this to be about three foot tall I thought that's pretty good being we're talking about third pull that this is three foot tall now the thing is is a man coming to the king's chamber didn't just come up in the chamber from the Ascension by himself but what's the prophet says it like this he says now in the seven steps watch on that seventh step that's what you're looking at if you've ever studied the dimensions of the pyramid what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king watch the station that is where that is standing there you'll see the day you're living in the pyramid the day you're living in the pyramid is that step right there that was in brother Adam's time now look what he's talking about he said something has to come to introduce us to the Messiah in other words somebody had to come out and meet a man on that step and bring him up in the chamber into the presence of the king how many knows brother Brown says that we got justification we got sanctification we have the baptism of the spirit he said the next thing is the word itself the Messiah that's what we're talking about the word itself brother bam actually calls it the divine presence of God that's exactly where the church is coming into divine presence now look what he's doing he's coming right back up there to introduce the Messiah see he said people believe in him how will they know it unless they're constantly in the word the wise he said they shall know remember last year's series he said how would he appear in the last day the people to bring them back to the word so the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen that's why this has to happen we are living in the ages coming we'll be in amenities talking about the word coming and a prophet introducing the church to the word which is the Messiah come on Friends the Messiah is here amen what's leading the church is not a man come on there's not some man over the churches we're not under a bishop come on folks we're under some man somewhere out here telling you believe the message like this and you believe the message like this and you do this and you do that that's not where this bride is she's not in a denomination she's under the Messiah the anointed word of God has come into this generation to lead the church the last thing is the divine presence Jehovah Jireh 1964 paragraph 195. the last thing is the divine presence the word itself he is the word the head it's coming to the body paragraph 196 not some man here is the Messiah it's the holy spirit is the Messiah cry Christ the Holy Spirit the same thing is here now working in the flesh getting the bride ready for Rapture and Grace oh brother I tell you man when you talk about how you're going to walk with god without the word come on folks God is his word a prophet brought his word how do you walk with God you can walk a denomination you can walk with the Baptist you can walk with a Lutheran you can walk with him but till God sends a prophet you can't walk with a word but in this generation there is building utterance of a prophetic word that has gave us the ability oh my goodness amen I'm sorry preacher coming out here amen you watch this what God did amen God did Brother Adam said they want a messiah he'd send them one he said what would he be he'd be the same he's always been he'd be the word of God made manifest what would the Messiah be in this age the word of God made manifest he would be the word of God he's the word of God he is the word of God he's forever the word of God sounding forth he's with always the prophets who the word came to hear the word has come in his fullness if he would come today he would be a word of God and manifested word a Vindicated word god living among us that's the Messiah he promised it he would be that Pillar of Fire again he would be that same Messiah that led Israel he would be that same come on church that picture of the pillar fire we got here is not about the man brother random he ain't even here tonight amen but the one he introduced us to he said he would always accompany this message the pillar of fire is still with the Church of the Living God the same one he said who is this he said it's the same one that led the children of Israel out of Egypt into the promised land he has come for another Exodus he's come to lead the bride to lead us through the through the Scallywags and the impersonations and all the intimidation and a bride could walk with this word amen you say Amen what are you talking about this God's Messiah is the anointed word the anointed word amen there he is brother bam said them predestinated people is going to receive it too preacher what are you talking about let's go back to us let's go back to our chart a minute here there's the great step and a prophet comes to meet to bring us in the king's chamber and he's saying the Messiah will be in that chamber let's go to the next picture the Messiah will be in that chamber it's odd that there's just an empty box there isn't that odd just the empty box but if you check it out this box has the same volume as the Ark of the Covenant that Moses builds thousands of years later somebody said what are you talking about you remember Noah's you remember when Moses built a ten of meeting and the people would go into divine presence and in that divine presence was the Ark of the Covenant and the Word was in the Ark of the Covenant which was no more than a box like this one but it was made of of wood over of recovered but gold but up on top of it remember there was a lid on top that was The Mercy Seat and it was blood put on The Mercy Seat and it was a covered word with the blood between the people but when this end time amen now we're not looking oh God we're not looking at a word that is covered up we're not looking at a book that is sealed we're looking at something that the the the historians say that it never was a lid on this amen that Enoch was showing us when the bride gets to the last step she'll be brought into the presence of an open word do you know that the revelations to him that Malachi for is to open the word to this generation the secret of the rapture is that the word will be opened up as the bride can walk with God Amen she can go back to the mind of God where she came from it's an ark of the covenant with a lid that's been opened according to Revelations 10 it will be the open word no wonder we're not living under the first pool no wonder we're not living under the second Paul come on church this is a third pool administration of the son of man amen what are we talking about the third pool is the opening of the word that's why we're a part of it we're not a part of the first pull we're not a part of the second poll it was brother Adam's Ministry to the church but the third poll was the creation of a bride and a groom to make him one unit the bride has become Christ in this generation she's walking with him talking with him amen but he ain't just with us brother Mark he said yet a little while and the world see me no more but I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age that's why that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the word and the age you're living in how can you deny this message and say it's the Holy Ghost come on Friends it's got to be that word can I can I can I continue a minute go to the next one this one right here blew me away look at this one this Granite Leaf right here which is in the entrance of the king's chamber you saw it while ago here's the back side of it's a granite Leaf they actually call this the Boston go to the next one you have got to climb all the way to the top to get the key to the entire thing Nobody Knows the measurements of this pyramid until you get to the king's chamber when you get there they've actually they've actually drawed this for you but it looks like a loaf of bread cut doesn't it but it measures five by five five pyramid inches so you you ever seen a set of plans and they got a scale on them this is the scale of the pyramid but it was hid all the way in the end if you get the key now you can turn around and look at the entire thing you can go down and measure out the beginning and you can measure out what happened here you can measure out what happened here see the message comes to the end and once you get the message now we understand Luther we understand the fall we understand Redemption we it's the boss Stone it gives you the key to the measurements of the entire Temple uh this this this art of the Covenant now if you're using this let's go to the next one if you're using this you will see 2140 BC is when this is built if you come into that you remember that entrance I showed you all ago you come down that line if you're going down that line just after you enter in there is actually on the wall is Big scored lines and they didn't know what they meant but after they found that key they come back and measured it this thing was built in 2140 BC 2140 inches pyramid inches down that Hall that line scored if you follow that line it goes directly and ties into the Stars which is the first Bible and it ties into Pleiades which is the Throne of God if you tie in the actual descension chamber which we've been looking at if you look at the dissension it comes out and ties in directly with dragon which is the alpha draconis it's draconius so so you have you have showing here Enoch in the pyramid is telling you about leadership it matters what you follow if you want to go in a Rapture you've got to understand leadership I'm on Church somebody said well by the way what is true leadership brother Brown said leadership was following the Vindicated word of the hour direct quote 1965 leadership we must follow he meant to have eternal life Leadership of God is to follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost you can't go in this Rapture without leadership somebody's got to lead this bride I can't do it you can't do it you can't do it God said I'll send the Messiah and he will lead this bride then that means you might not ever met me and we can meet in the rapture there's this uh I probably leave that off it's okay if I say yeah I just appreciate there's a a big teacher there in Ohio years ago and and there's a group got in behind him and sometimes the group does more than the teacher you know but a group got in behind him and they got they got it spread over a certain part of Ohio I'm in that if you don't hear this certain teacher you can't even go in the rapture so one day I met some of us real famous followers you know and I was friends with some of them they introduced me to this fella and he's talking to him and I said hi my name is Dwayne Lawson he said I never heard of you I said that's a shame brother he said why is that I said didn't you know if you didn't hear me preach you can't go into rapture he said well that's silly I said it ain't no more silly than what you believe that we had to hear a certain preacher see there you go what's your leadership is it some fellow is it some man is it some personality come on Church he said what do you follow the message of the hour so don't you believe in pastors yes I do brother Brown said and a pastor will lead by the word we must follow it now watch this this building somehow is built True North let's take the next level next picture this building is built True North at that some reason that's not coming up I've got it on a it you have a pyramid on a compass you don't have it I got it down here sorry as it actually shows a true north this pyramid is the most True North built building I think in the entire world there's nothing you know like if you're trying to build a directly north you ever build a building you go out there and you go how do we lay that out it's going to be cockeyed to the highway or is it going to be you know how do you lay it out in the somebody laid this thing out where it was true north with the entire world that's pretty powerful but being that it's built so truth there it is amen being that it's built True North the pyramid look what it's actually built true north how did that man do that how did he built that true north sister hope he's got the entire file and you can have it amen it's built true north and and and the thing about it is because it's built this way you can tie it into the heavens take that next take that next uh slide and you're going to go into the Orion's Belt now the one the one with the guy standing there in the build on Orion's belt there he is Orion's Belt this is this is Orion's Belt which is the consolation you can see it's called Orion's Belt because of the three major Stars here because this thing's built so true north now the next one you can take and if you were looking down through Orion's belt from the heavens they lay over the three pyramids exactly the three stars hit exactly and look they get brighter with the size and their exact distances between them now how did how did this man Enoch get that so perfect was it it was like the man was above Orion's Belt looking down a little left no no back back right just a little bit folks this is not accidental it's it's so perfectly accurate with the heavens now go to that go to that next one now it's amazing because this king's chamber is built it's built with Vince if it's a if it's a tomb there's no need no vent in there but the king's chamber was vented it was actually had a southern vent now the beauty of this Southern van is in the Book of Joel 9 and 9 it said which maketh our Arcturus Orion and Pleiades and the chambers of the South can you imagine that job talked about the chambers of the South in Orion all the way back during the Book of Job now can thou Job 38 canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleadies remember that one 2400 BCS points straight up where is it pointing please and job says can thou bind the sweet influences the Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion and why is he mentioning these consolations watching Amos 5 and verse 8 seek him that maketh the Seven Stars and Orion do you know Pleiades is actually the the Pleiades consolation is the consolation of the Seven Stars the influence of the Seven Stars is what the leadership he was trying to get the church to the leadership of the Seven Stars Pleiades is a consolation of seven stars now friends I don't believe that these things are just accidents but I believe the Enoch wrote a revelation and then God Vindicated it with a body change and left it as a memorial to you and I that it ties with the Bible and it ties with the heavens of the Walk of a man that walked upon the earth now when the prophet preaches his Revelation the next one when the prophet preaches his revelation it's also a pyramid Revelation stand to your feet with us tonight we'll start that tomorrow night it's also a pyramid revelation just keep on walking you don't know how far you've come friend let's keep on walking it's your time we get weary 300 years he had every situation that you have he was not a Superman he was a man that walked with God brother Brown said this is thing he never turned down nothing God asked him to do he'd done the word if the word said it he was dedicated he was trained he was disciplined Amen brother I believe in it I believe that's what the Church of the Living God ought to be tonight Lord that's my type I wonder how many tonight's brother
