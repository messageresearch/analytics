[50:42] bestowed upon us that we should be
[50:45] called sons of God
[50:47] and REM told us we're not going to be we
[50:51] are now sons of God Amen and I'm so glad
[50:54] for that amen the musicians can be

[50:59] house of the Lord today and what a
[51:02] beautiful day that we have and
[51:06] uh it's good to have uh Brad I believe

[51:14] to have them this brother Terry and
[51:16] sister Alice's son I hear so uh been
[51:20] good to have you all
[51:22] uh today and um
[51:25] we also just to remind you about brother
[51:28] Joe Greene's uh youth banquet
[51:32] coming up in October
[51:34] and uh I think we've got the information
[51:37] in the back and then also our fall
[51:40] festival is coming up November 5th and
[51:44] so looking forward to that brother Isaac
[51:48] Hatfield uh will be ministering the Lord
[51:51] willing for us that day and
[51:53] that's brother Wayne Lawson's son-in-law
[51:56] and uh but he is a uh just a fine young
[52:02] man and
[52:06] just coming along uh here in in his
[52:09] ministry and so I've been looking
[52:12] forward to
[52:14] having him and a good time there
[52:18] together but also good to have sister
[52:21] Jane back amen and trust your sister is
[52:24] doing well
[52:26] and thanks praise the Lord and Sister
[52:28] Kim weeks doing good amen and uh so we
[52:36] we thank the Lord for that as well and
[52:39] and
[52:40] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[52:42] turn back to the book of Jose the 12th
[52:45] chapter
[52:47] and um
[52:50] also the deacons have asked me to
[52:55] to remind you
[52:58] um you know the the the the traffic uh
[53:02] you know is it can be dangerous out here
[53:04] coming in and things and so they you
[53:09] know they're they want they're standing
[53:10] out there to to help make sure that
[53:13] there ain't no accidents but sometimes
[53:17] when cars are coming they're coming
[53:18] pretty fast this direction I guess it's
[53:21] this direction it's that direct it's
[53:23] both directions
[53:25] foreign
[53:26] s
[53:29] and so sometimes when they when they
[53:32] when they tell you there's no car coming
[53:35] they really mean that but uh it's
[53:38] because they don't see a car coming and
[53:40] so when they wave you to come and then
[53:43] you take your time uh a car is coming
[53:46] and and so you have to be really careful
[53:49] so when they do wave you uh kind of step
[53:52] on the gas a little bit and don't take
[53:56] your time
[53:57] you know it's kind of one of these
[53:59] things you can pill out if you need to
[54:02] and to make it on the other side and
[54:06] they even might take you out for a
[54:09] dinner or something I don't know I might
[54:11] be speaking ahead but
[54:14] but anyway so uh just just be careful
[54:18] and because we certainly don't want no
[54:22] accidents and someone get hurt but uh so
[54:27] anyways uh Hosea the 12th chapter
[54:30] and before we go into the word may we
[54:34] just bow our heads and talk to our Lord
[54:37] I
[54:39] we certainly need him don't we
[54:41] every day that we live
[54:43] and I just you know we can't get enough
[54:46] of him today
[54:48] let's pray father
[54:51] we're your people here
[54:54] this morning and we find it in our
[54:57] hearts how needy we are
[55:00] Lord
[55:02] we tried the world we tried things
[55:05] and just never been able to satisfy us
[55:09] but Lord when you called us and you've
[55:12] done an inside work
[55:14] Lord we found heard that you're
[55:17] everything that we need
[55:19] and we're just here asking for more of
[55:23] you
[55:24] father the pressures of Life the things
[55:27] that we all go through
[55:29] we realize that we're no match for the
[55:31] devil
[55:33] but Lord if you could just come and give
[55:35] us strength that you'd pour yourself
[55:38] more and more into his father and may we
[55:42] be more yielded to you
[55:44] and I pray father that you would come in
[55:46] a special way this morning and you know
[55:49] the needs of your people
[55:51] but not only that you know how to meet
[55:53] the needs help me just to get myself out
[55:56] of the way father and Lord that you
[55:59] could speak through me and I pray Lord
[56:02] that any spirit that would try to hinder
[56:04] your people from receiving and
[56:06] pray Lord that you would drive it away
[56:08] from them and as your Prophet many times
[56:12] would ask you Lord that you would send
[56:15] your angels Lord by the people father to
[56:19] help them believe and I pray that you
[56:20] would do it this morning
[56:22] father may this service be divinely
[56:26] orchestrated by you father that when we
[56:29] leave this place we'd know that we'd
[56:31] been in your presence
[56:32] I ask it father in Jesus Christ's name
[56:36] and the church says
[56:38] amen and amen
[56:41] Hosea the 12th chapter
[56:44] and
[56:46] we looking at the 10th verse
[56:49] it says I have also spoken by the
[56:52] prophets
[56:53] and I have multiplied visions
[56:56] and use similitudes by the ministry
[57:00] of the prophets
[57:02] also
[57:03] [Music]
[57:04] um
[57:04] I just felt uh to use another scripture
[57:10] and and we all know it I'm sure by Heart
[57:12] by now but Malachi 4
[57:16] and um
[57:18] Malachi the the fourth chapter
[57:24] and
[57:26] um
[57:30] the fifth verse says behold I will send
[57:33] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[57:36] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[57:38] Lord
[57:39] and he shall turn the heart of the
[57:43] fathers to the children
[57:45] and we understand that that was
[57:47] fulfilled with John the Baptist but then
[57:52] it also speaks of another Ministry of
[57:56] his and the Heart of the children to
[57:59] their fathers
[58:01] lest I come and smite the Earth with the
[58:03] curse and we know that last part is
[58:07] for this day that he would turn the
[58:10] heart of the children to the apostolic
[58:13] fathers
[58:14] and we we understand that the Elijah is
[58:18] the Holy Ghost the spirit of Elijah is
[58:21] the Holy Ghost for he is the prophet
[58:24] amen you can have your seats
[58:26] this morning
[58:30] we are living in a
[58:33] a very crucial time
[58:37] and
[58:39] the enemy is fighting on every hand
[58:44] and we know that there's no future
[58:47] outside
[58:48] of the rapture
[58:51] the Earth is is
[58:56] in labor pain the world is is falling
[59:01] apart
[59:03] on every front every hand whether it be
[59:07] on the religious civilization whether it
[59:09] be political
[59:12] um
[59:13] nations are against Nations Bible
[59:16] prophecy is being fulfilled like never
[59:19] before
[59:21] it's happening
[59:22] and there's only one way that the future
[59:28] to be bride and that is to be part of
[59:30] the body of Christ
[59:32] and and and I'm so glad that our future
[59:35] is bright
[59:37] the world is as as Jesus predicted men's
[59:40] Hearts failing them for fear
[59:43] and uh there's never been a time where
[59:46] fear has been on the earth and uh uh
[59:50] anxiety and and uh just things that are
[59:54] that are happening and men's minds are
[59:58] leaving them and and these things but
[1:00:01] God has left us a promise
[1:00:03] and and and that's that's what we look
[1:00:07] to but the ministry of a prophet is so
[1:00:12] important to the believer
[1:00:13] and uh because whenever God has
[1:00:17] something to say to his people
[1:00:20] he sends a prophet
[1:00:22] and um
[1:00:25] and and because a a prophet uh doesn't
[1:00:29] Express his own thoughts or ideas but
[1:00:32] rather expresses the thoughts of God
[1:00:36] and God chose the way his word would
[1:00:40] come God is Sovereign he does what he
[1:00:42] wants to do whether man believes it or
[1:00:44] not
[1:00:44] but God has always used prophets
[1:00:48] um it's it's been he as as I've said
[1:00:51] before that you know uh when God created
[1:00:54] the world and the Earth and and all the
[1:00:57] creation it was God speaking himself
[1:01:00] but uh when the people there in in in uh
[1:01:04] the Old Testament uh uh decided they
[1:01:07] didn't want God to speak uh to them
[1:01:10] um so he says all right he says I won't
[1:01:13] do that he because they said let Moses
[1:01:15] speak and uh to us and so
[1:01:18] um God says all right he he adhered to
[1:01:21] that but he says I'll raise up prophets
[1:01:24] and so it's it's the same word the same
[1:01:28] power of that word uh but it's it's
[1:01:32] through a man and so prophets are
[1:01:36] predestinated and foreordained and being
[1:01:39] part of God's word they they declared
[1:01:42] the the revelation of his word to the
[1:01:46] age and the time that God would
[1:01:48] predestinate them to and because the
[1:01:52] word of the Lord comes to a prophet then
[1:01:55] Jesus called them Gods the Bible even uh
[1:01:58] they're called them gods and Jesus
[1:02:00] referred to it and and there they it
[1:02:05] made them a God to the people that they
[1:02:08] were sent to and of course never a man
[1:02:13] worship never never amend any any True
[1:02:16] Believer never worships the man
[1:02:19] but what it is is that man when he has
[1:02:21] thus saith the Lord then the people are
[1:02:25] to adhere to that word because that word
[1:02:28] cannot fail you can kill the man but the
[1:02:31] word still lives it's just like uh the
[1:02:35] prophet Isaiah when he said behold a
[1:02:37] virgin shall conceive he didn't even
[1:02:38] know how a virgin would conceive never
[1:02:40] been done before history says that he
[1:02:43] was killed
[1:02:45] Saul to Sunder they they chased him and
[1:02:48] and he crawled up in a hollow log and
[1:02:51] they stopped the log and they and they
[1:02:53] sawed him asunder and and and martyred
[1:02:55] him for what he said but it did not they
[1:03:00] silenced the voice of that man but it
[1:03:03] did not stop the word because it was God
[1:03:06] it was God speaking through that man and
[1:03:09] so it was totally different man's word
[1:03:11] is is a failure the Bible says call
[1:03:14] every man every man's word is a lie but
[1:03:18] God's word is true
[1:03:19] and so uh therefore Moses being a
[1:03:23] prophet was a god Joseph was a God the
[1:03:26] prophets were gods and the Bible says
[1:03:28] they were and and
[1:03:30] um uh in Jesus said it it is written
[1:03:34] that they they were called Gods to whom
[1:03:36] the word of the Lord came and so they
[1:03:39] they were Gods because they had
[1:03:41] completely surrendered themselves to the
[1:03:44] spirit of God that they were working for
[1:03:47] the glory of God uh the prophet said
[1:03:50] when a man is Anointed of the spirit of
[1:03:52] God he has habits his actions and
[1:03:56] everything is God moving in him and
[1:03:59] sometimes he's misjudged and and so is
[1:04:03] it so but uh just reading quotes uh here
[1:04:07] but it says God does his own choosing by
[1:04:10] predestination chose the prophets for
[1:04:12] every age notice it he he he fixes the
[1:04:16] nature of that Prophet to fit that age
[1:04:18] he it's his style whatever he does he
[1:04:22] fits him whether he's educated or Not
[1:04:24] educated he fits the gifts the manner
[1:04:26] that he'll preach in the gifts he'll
[1:04:28] have and the message for that certain
[1:04:31] age God's predestinated that certain
[1:04:33] thing to happen and there's not another
[1:04:36] thing can take its place I don't care
[1:04:38] what it is how many man-made
[1:04:40] achievements nothing can take its place
[1:04:42] he's predestinated the man may be
[1:04:45] ignorant an ignorant man he might have
[1:04:48] predestinated him another kind of a man
[1:04:50] but whatever he is he gives him his
[1:04:52] class his gifts his nature his style
[1:04:55] whatever it is how he expresses himself
[1:04:57] and whatever he does he makes the man of
[1:05:01] the hour to catch the people of the hour
[1:05:06] and so another place he says all but
[1:05:09] those the elected whom he has sinned
[1:05:12] hate him amen only the elected love him
[1:05:16] but all the others uh uh uh hate him he
[1:05:20] said examine every instance and see if
[1:05:23] it's not right or see if it's right or
[1:05:25] not the only the ones that he has sent
[1:05:28] to he came to his own and his own
[1:05:30] received him not but as many as did
[1:05:34] receive him to him gave to them gave he
[1:05:37] the power to become sons of God and so
[1:05:41] again whenever a prophet speaks and thus
[1:05:44] saith the Lord and a Vindicated prophet
[1:05:47] he has thus that the Lord then his word
[1:05:50] has the same creative uh Power uh effect
[1:05:55] that was exhibited when God created the
[1:05:58] world ain't that right Genesis 1 1 it
[1:06:01] says in the beginning God created the
[1:06:03] Heaven and Earth ain't that right and so
[1:06:06] we would also call the power of the word
[1:06:10] uh transforming power it was the power
[1:06:15] of transformation uh because in the
[1:06:18] second verse Genesis 1 and 2 and the
[1:06:20] Earth was without form and void and
[1:06:25] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:06:27] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:06:31] face of the waters ain't that right and
[1:06:34] so the world was without form it was
[1:06:37] chaotic it was void Darkness was upon
[1:06:40] the Earth it was nothing but a complete
[1:06:43] chaos there confusion and and whatever
[1:06:47] and yet when the world was in that
[1:06:51] condition God spoke his word and the
[1:06:55] spirit of the Lord moved upon the face
[1:06:58] of the water and noticed this power of
[1:07:01] transformation the entire picture of the
[1:07:04] world was changed changed from a total
[1:07:08] chaos to a Garden of Eden and and so it
[1:07:12] was God's transforming power that could
[1:07:15] take something that was nothing and
[1:07:18] transform it and and make something
[1:07:20] wonderful out of it aren't you glad for
[1:07:23] that a man God could do that everything
[1:07:26] amen we don't understand the bleakness
[1:07:28] and how chaotic the world was because we
[1:07:32] we now we're living enjoying that what
[1:07:35] God was able to do
[1:07:37] transformed this this world to to where
[1:07:40] the trees could live and the flowers
[1:07:42] could bloom and and everything that we
[1:07:45] see is comes from God's spoken word
[1:07:47] ain't that right amen but you see uh
[1:07:51] God's plan it seeds in the earth and and
[1:07:54] then we know what he said uh there the
[1:07:57] law of God was let every seed everybody
[1:08:00] say let every seed bring forth of its
[1:08:04] kind ain't that right in all other words
[1:08:06] don't change your nature don't change
[1:08:09] your nature a man you bring forth what
[1:08:12] I've called you to to bring forth and so
[1:08:15] uh God God had planted apple seeds in
[1:08:19] the earth and he didn't want them
[1:08:22] growing up to be something else but what
[1:08:24] he had called it to be and he called uh
[1:08:27] this seed to be a certain kind and he
[1:08:29] planted this seed and he planted that
[1:08:31] seed in and they were all to bring forth
[1:08:34] of its kind every seed at that time was
[1:08:37] perfect do you believe that every seed
[1:08:40] was perfect it was laying in the ground
[1:08:42] in the beginning uh the palm trees the
[1:08:45] oak trees the Evergreens and and all of
[1:08:48] that the birds and the animals and
[1:08:51] everything was in perfect order with the
[1:08:54] word of God the Commandment of God Amen
[1:08:57] and it was to be such brother Branham
[1:09:00] said he had spoke the word and his great
[1:09:02] creating power had formed these things
[1:09:05] that come up even the man and woman for
[1:09:09] the Bible says let us make man in our
[1:09:12] own image male and female created he
[1:09:16] them ain't that right why what was it by
[1:09:19] the spoken word of God Amen and sold
[1:09:22] every word the Bible says that the word
[1:09:24] of God is a seed ain't that right it's a
[1:09:28] seed and so uh God when he created man
[1:09:31] and and woman he designed them to be a
[1:09:34] certain way and that seed was to bring
[1:09:37] forth of its kind amen and and they were
[1:09:41] the head because they were super to all
[1:09:44] other other creation other races uh the
[1:09:48] birds and the the flowers and the the
[1:09:51] trees and even the sun and the winds and
[1:09:55] and all of that man was Superior to all
[1:09:58] of that for God had made him an amateur
[1:10:01] God ain't that right that he would have
[1:10:04] dominion over God God's creation and so
[1:10:08] God would put man under the care that he
[1:10:12] put trees and animals and so forth and
[1:10:15] that would be his word man was under the
[1:10:18] the headship of the word of God Amen and
[1:10:22] they must never by no means break that
[1:10:24] word they must stay there don't take
[1:10:27] anything from it or add anything to it
[1:10:29] you must live by the word of God ain't
[1:10:33] that right now trees could not add to
[1:10:35] the word of God the flowers could not
[1:10:37] add to the word or take away from the
[1:10:39] word the the the grass and and the sun
[1:10:42] nothing could take away from or add to
[1:10:45] the word of God only man could do that
[1:10:47] because he was a he would he is a free
[1:10:50] moral agent ain't that right so he could
[1:10:53] choose and he could he he could choose
[1:10:55] to obey he could choose not to obey he
[1:10:58] could choose to add he could choose to
[1:10:59] take from and all of these things but
[1:11:02] yet man even though a free moral agent
[1:11:04] he was still under the same command as
[1:11:07] as all creation every seed must bring
[1:11:10] forth of its own kind and and and bring
[1:11:14] forth and and so uh uh so then we could
[1:11:17] ask this if every seed is to bring forth
[1:11:20] of its own kind and what preacher or
[1:11:23] anybody else has a right to make that
[1:11:26] word say something else other than what
[1:11:29] God intended the word to be ain't that
[1:11:32] right amen what good would it do what
[1:11:34] what good is it amen to change the word
[1:11:37] of God Amen God's already laid that word
[1:11:39] there and it has the power to bring
[1:11:42] forth of its own kind so why would we
[1:11:45] want to change it ain't that right a man
[1:11:48] say so so if if Mark 16 is God's word
[1:11:52] then it's got to bring forth of its own
[1:11:55] kind if Malachi 4 is God's word it'll
[1:11:58] bring forth of its own kind if Acts 2 38
[1:12:02] is God's word it's going to bring forth
[1:12:04] of its own kind you believe that if man
[1:12:07] if first Thessalonians 4 and 16 is God's
[1:12:10] word and 17 then it's got to bring forth
[1:12:13] of its own kind if if Matthew 25 talking
[1:12:17] about the the foolish virgin and the
[1:12:19] wise virgin and and the the the the the
[1:12:21] the the sounding of the the voice of the
[1:12:24] bridegroom calling and and there's that
[1:12:26] wise virgin that has the all inner lamps
[1:12:29] it's got to bring forth of its own kind
[1:12:31] for it's a seed it's the word of God
[1:12:34] ain't that right every promise must
[1:12:37] bring forth of its kind and you see this
[1:12:41] is how God established his Eden amen
[1:12:44] what a beauty it must have been what a
[1:12:47] paradise it must have been in the Garden
[1:12:49] of Eden how perfect and how beautiful
[1:12:51] and sin didn't have to have the ha what
[1:12:54] didn't have the chance yet to tomorrow
[1:12:57] all it must have been a beautiful
[1:12:59] Greenery it must have been a beautiful
[1:13:00] tree it must have been beautiful grass
[1:13:03] it must have been beautiful amen no sin
[1:13:05] was able to touch it the Birds must have
[1:13:07] had just such a a glorious uh uh uh uh
[1:13:11] uh uh uh thing about it and and the and
[1:13:15] the the all these animals and what peace
[1:13:17] and what joy and what scenery it must
[1:13:20] have been a man because God would
[1:13:23] established his Eid and he established
[1:13:25] it by his word every seed must bring
[1:13:28] forth of its own kind and it was perfect
[1:13:31] seed under the law of God ain't that
[1:13:34] right and so this is not only does he
[1:13:37] establish his Eden that way but this is
[1:13:40] how he establishes his church amen every
[1:13:44] word after its kind ain't that right and
[1:13:48] Matthew 4 4 Jesus says it is written man
[1:13:52] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:13:55] every word and that proceed us out of
[1:13:58] the mouth of God ain't that right but
[1:14:01] notice Satan always takes something else
[1:14:03] than the word of God in it's just his
[1:14:06] his way he he does it he's done it from
[1:14:09] the beginning he does it today and and
[1:14:12] and so the majority it's just like the
[1:14:15] majority of the people today are
[1:14:17] confused as to what the evidence of the
[1:14:19] Holy Ghost is amen and and you know uh
[1:14:23] uh uh and and I'll stay with my thought
[1:14:26] but but in Matthew 5 45 Jesus says the
[1:14:29] father maketh his son to rise on the
[1:14:32] evil and on the good and sendeth Reign
[1:14:35] on the just and on the unjust ain't that
[1:14:37] right and and so what it it tells us and
[1:14:41] and and we could only really understand
[1:14:42] it by the message is that the that that
[1:14:45] that that the that a child of the devil
[1:14:48] can be anointed just as much as a Son of
[1:14:52] God can amen uh uh uh the blessings of
[1:14:56] God falls on on on Satan's Children as
[1:14:59] it does on God's children gifts are used
[1:15:02] by the devil's seed as they are by God
[1:15:04] seed ain't that right not tongues the
[1:15:07] interpretation of tongues and prophecy
[1:15:10] and the nine fruits of the spirit the
[1:15:12] nine spiritual gifts and can be
[1:15:14] impersonated by the devil ain't that
[1:15:16] right amen they can all be impersonated
[1:15:19] brother Branham says he can impersonate
[1:15:21] any kind of gift that God is God but he
[1:15:25] cannot bring that word word by word
[1:15:29] ain't that right amen he cannot bring
[1:15:32] the word word by word that's where he
[1:15:34] felt in the Garden of Eden and that's
[1:15:36] where he always fails a man is bringing
[1:15:41] the word word by word amen so that tells
[1:15:46] us that people can be Anointed with the
[1:15:48] spirit speak in tongues interpret the
[1:15:51] tons dance in the spirit preach the
[1:15:55] gospel and still be a devil ain't that
[1:15:58] right a man see and so brother Brown
[1:16:01] says this just like the corn in the
[1:16:03] field and the weed in the field and
[1:16:06] that's just in the natural uh of uh
[1:16:09] Faith wanted to plant a garden and and
[1:16:11] so we we've done that you know we're
[1:16:12] planting the garden and and I tilled it
[1:16:15] I I got out there and we tilled it up
[1:16:17] and and got all that grass and all that
[1:16:19] totally uh you know it looked dirt just
[1:16:22] it's just dirt so she goes and starts
[1:16:24] planting things and the corn and all
[1:16:26] these things and and and before you know
[1:16:29] it grass is coming up just as well well
[1:16:32] I know she didn't plant that you know uh
[1:16:34] she planted other things but not that
[1:16:36] but somehow in that Garden in that same
[1:16:39] dirt amen other stuff come up that we
[1:16:42] didn't want you understand what I'm
[1:16:43] saying and it got started getting away
[1:16:45] with her and she's like I need help help
[1:16:47] help you know uh uh uh because uh
[1:16:51] realizing that you can plant one thing
[1:16:53] but other things are going to grow up
[1:16:55] just as much well that just this it's
[1:16:58] just the nature to show what it is in
[1:16:59] the church God plants Sons and Daughters
[1:17:01] of God and other things come up and and
[1:17:04] and I have to say it you know there was
[1:17:06] things that got around that corn that
[1:17:08] that corn did not grow just right amen
[1:17:11] it just didn't grow didn't look like
[1:17:12] corn either and and you know when you
[1:17:15] got little bitty old knobs like that and
[1:17:17] and and and she says Dad to have it had
[1:17:19] taste it you know and I ain't no way I'm
[1:17:21] tasting that it just don't look right
[1:17:24] and I I just hate to tell you you know
[1:17:26] uh uh so someone tasted it and it it
[1:17:29] didn't taste like corn you know uh uh
[1:17:32] but that that's just the way it is well
[1:17:34] it's the same way in the spiritual you
[1:17:36] got you got God's unit got God seed that
[1:17:39] he planted and and and then you got weed
[1:17:42] in the field and they can be Anointed
[1:17:44] with the same Spirit a man of the Holy
[1:17:47] Ghost and that's a real believer is
[1:17:49] Anointed with ain't that right it can
[1:17:52] happen amen don't you you the same Sun
[1:17:55] that was shining on uh well the the the
[1:17:57] the the garden and the seeds that she
[1:18:00] planted the same sun was calling that
[1:18:02] grass out just as well uh uh the rain
[1:18:05] that fell upon her stuff fell upon the
[1:18:07] other stuff too amen that's what was
[1:18:09] making everything grow in that same
[1:18:10] Garden amen it was just that way well
[1:18:13] you know brother Brandon said the
[1:18:15] Antichrist will be Pentecostal to the
[1:18:17] DOT it'll be Pentecost to the dot and
[1:18:21] and you know why because the bride in
[1:18:24] this last day will not be cold formal
[1:18:26] dry and and that that's not the bride at
[1:18:30] all God never planted his sons and
[1:18:33] daughters to sit there in a church
[1:18:35] without an experience with God he he
[1:18:37] never planted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:40] to where they sit in a church and
[1:18:42] they're so dead and they're so dry and
[1:18:44] the spirit of God can't move upon them
[1:18:46] God never did plant such a thing ain't
[1:18:50] that right well Satan he's an
[1:18:52] impersonator a man and and so uh but
[1:18:55] this bride she will have all nine
[1:18:58] spiritual gifts in operation she will
[1:19:01] have all nine fruits of the spirit in in
[1:19:04] in operation she will have the spirit of
[1:19:07] God working in her midst ain't that
[1:19:10] right amen they try to tell us we're
[1:19:12] Beyond Pentecost and and because we're
[1:19:14] in a different age and the word that was
[1:19:16] back at Pentecost will not work for this
[1:19:18] this day what brother Brown did say that
[1:19:20] he said the word that fell on the day of
[1:19:22] Pentecost will not work for this day no
[1:19:24] sir that was for Pentecost this is for
[1:19:27] the bride going home of the Bride but
[1:19:29] they take that out of context of what
[1:19:32] brother Branham really meant because in
[1:19:34] that same sermon brother Brown said If a
[1:19:36] woman won't have a baby for her husband
[1:19:38] she'll take a dog or a cat or something
[1:19:41] she's got the mother something it's a
[1:19:43] nature but to Bear a child for her
[1:19:46] husband and raise it to the service of
[1:19:48] God that's entirely out of her line
[1:19:50] seeds should be so disgraced if she did
[1:19:53] by her sin loving Society of this 1965
[1:19:56] type of women see it's a true picture of
[1:20:00] the modern church today neither does the
[1:20:03] modern Church want any of these here
[1:20:05] screaming shouting tongues speaking Acts
[1:20:07] 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah yeah
[1:20:10] see she don't want any of them hooping
[1:20:13] and crying and screaming amen hallelujah
[1:20:16] while such a child with a mean
[1:20:18] immediately put her out of her
[1:20:19] denomination see they they had one like
[1:20:22] that and one of these churches and
[1:20:24] they'd throw her out real right quick
[1:20:26] why are you letting such stuff as this
[1:20:28] goal goal alone see you see she's
[1:20:31] pregnant with something because she's
[1:20:32] bringing forth members all the time but
[1:20:35] she don't want none of them screaming
[1:20:37] hollering blabber in Acts 2 38 miserable
[1:20:39] creatures that she thinks they are it
[1:20:41] would certainly embarrass her it would
[1:20:43] ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:20:45] scientific Society Church that she
[1:20:48] belonged to here they would throw her
[1:20:51] out at next Council she can't have it
[1:20:53] see so she don't want to be impregnated
[1:20:55] with the word because that's the only
[1:20:58] kind that the word can bring forth see
[1:21:01] born of the spirit of God it has the
[1:21:04] spirit of God in it no intellectual
[1:21:06] Church John and Creed going bobbed hair
[1:21:09] fainted a painted face and there's no
[1:21:11] such thing as that in in the word in it
[1:21:14] all of that see you don't find that in
[1:21:16] the word of God see you find an
[1:21:19] old-fashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost
[1:21:21] Field child born of the spirit of God
[1:21:23] screaming holler and shouting praising
[1:21:25] God but that's all together out of the
[1:21:27] reaches for her she don't want that can
[1:21:30] you say Amen so brother Branham
[1:21:32] identifies as the only person that does
[1:21:35] not want such a thing like that as the
[1:21:37] modern Church of today amen but you find
[1:21:41] that Jesus was the word how many
[1:21:43] believes that Jesus was the word and the
[1:21:46] prophet says that that that that that
[1:21:48] the word uh uh uh that he if he would
[1:21:51] have come with Moses's word it wouldn't
[1:21:53] have worked if he would have come with
[1:21:55] Noah's work word it wouldn't work the
[1:21:57] word for their day wouldn't work in his
[1:22:00] day there ain't that right but the thing
[1:22:02] is here's the thing is Noah reflected
[1:22:06] Christ David reflected Christ Moses
[1:22:10] reflected Christ all of them prophets
[1:22:12] reflected Christ and do you believe that
[1:22:15] brother Brandon said they all reflected
[1:22:18] the coming of the perfect bridegroom so
[1:22:22] then therefore he was everything that
[1:22:25] they reflected amen what Moses reflected
[1:22:29] Jesus reflected what David reflected
[1:22:31] Jesus reflected what what Moses and and
[1:22:35] and and and all of them reflected he was
[1:22:39] and he reflected that can you say Amen
[1:22:42] well brother Branham says Luther and
[1:22:45] Wesley and even the Pentecostal age
[1:22:47] reflected the coming of The Perfect
[1:22:50] Bride amen go listen to The Harvest time
[1:22:53] he says it there see she's and and and
[1:22:56] so then today she is everything that
[1:23:00] they reflected amen everything amen and
[1:23:04] and if she isn't then she isn't the
[1:23:06] perfect word Jesus could reflect Moses
[1:23:09] because he was a reflected word or the
[1:23:11] perfect word you understand what I'm
[1:23:13] saying see he could reflect Noah he
[1:23:15] could reflect David he can reflect all
[1:23:18] of him because he was the perfect word
[1:23:21] with church we've come back to a perfect
[1:23:23] word that whatever they reflected we are
[1:23:27] today in its entirety in a Perfection
[1:23:32] can you say Amen so again the Antichrist
[1:23:35] will be Pentecost through the dot
[1:23:37] brother Brian says of all the ages of
[1:23:40] Deceit from the Garden of Eden all the
[1:23:42] way down there's never been an age so
[1:23:44] deceptive as this age false prophets
[1:23:47] will rise and show signs and wonders if
[1:23:50] possible to deceive the very elected now
[1:23:52] just a cold formal starchy church and so
[1:23:56] forth of man-made theology that wouldn't
[1:23:59] the elect would never pay no attention
[1:24:01] to that but it's up there almost like
[1:24:03] the real thing just leaving one word out
[1:24:07] is all you have to do promised of the
[1:24:10] age
[1:24:11] see a very great time Christians
[1:24:13] everywhere take heed to the hour We're
[1:24:16] living mark down and read and listen can
[1:24:19] you say Amen so then uh uh so so there's
[1:24:23] so much confusion as to what the Holy
[1:24:24] Ghost is uh today but it should not be
[1:24:28] in the bride that we should not be
[1:24:30] confused John 16 13. uh it tells us what
[1:24:34] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is how be
[1:24:37] it when he the spirit of Truth has come
[1:24:39] he will guide you into all Truth for he
[1:24:42] shall not speak of himself but
[1:24:44] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:24:46] speak and he will show you things to
[1:24:49] come can you say man so when a man
[1:24:51] receives the holy ghost that the the
[1:24:53] spirit of God begins to reveal things
[1:24:55] not outside the word inside the word he
[1:24:59] shows him things he speaks of the uh of
[1:25:02] of things to come and and guides him
[1:25:05] into all truth so the prophet said the
[1:25:08] evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you
[1:25:10] can receive leave the word amen when you
[1:25:13] can receive the word not some system
[1:25:15] notice but have a clear understanding a
[1:25:20] clear understanding how do you know the
[1:25:21] word is clear and understand it watch it
[1:25:24] vindicate itself see we have a clear
[1:25:27] understanding of what Malachi 4 is we've
[1:25:30] seen it vindicate itself we have a clear
[1:25:32] understanding of these things a man that
[1:25:35] is happening in the day because we have
[1:25:37] seen it vindicate itself ain't that
[1:25:38] right so he says see it's always been
[1:25:41] every age if you can receive the word
[1:25:44] those priests had Jesus beat a million
[1:25:47] miles when it come to the fruits of the
[1:25:49] spirit gentle peaceful meek and lowly
[1:25:51] and yet he tore up the churches kicked
[1:25:54] them over you know and toward the people
[1:25:56] out and call them Snakes in the Grass
[1:25:58] and everything but he was that word he
[1:26:02] was that word that's it believe God God
[1:26:04] is the word and you just believe it
[1:26:06] ain't that right so notice the seed was
[1:26:09] to bring forth the sea need was to bring
[1:26:12] forth now the seed can only come forth
[1:26:15] with the power of life within it a man
[1:26:18] to transform it from a seed to a plant
[1:26:22] amen but it was already in the seed amen
[1:26:25] and whatever it was brother Branham says
[1:26:28] each one of those seeds has power in
[1:26:31] itself to transform it into the species
[1:26:35] that I've desired it to be ain't that
[1:26:37] right amen see he said that's what it
[1:26:40] must be everybody say that's what it
[1:26:42] must be that's what it must be whatever
[1:26:44] God planted and he's he put the power
[1:26:48] within that seed to be exactly what he
[1:26:51] commanded it to be ain't that right I
[1:26:53] want to say this for a moment you don't
[1:26:55] have to try to be a Christian you don't
[1:26:57] have to try to make it in a Rapture you
[1:27:00] don't have to try to be a a Son of God
[1:27:02] you don't have to try nothing if if God
[1:27:06] planted a seed in you it's going to
[1:27:08] happen it's going to be can you say amen
[1:27:12] I I I just believe that now we ought to
[1:27:15] be able to rest amen we ought to be able
[1:27:18] to rest can you say amen that's right
[1:27:21] see so it must be that's what it must be
[1:27:24] because I've given every seed
[1:27:25] transforming power to make out of itself
[1:27:29] in its potentials now to make out of
[1:27:32] itself exactly what I want it to be
[1:27:35] ain't that right so God has never
[1:27:37] changed do you believe that God has
[1:27:41] never changed his purpose is going to be
[1:27:43] fulfilled his purpose is not just uh
[1:27:46] he's not coming up with the plan as time
[1:27:48] goes like like we do we don't know
[1:27:51] tomorrow so we plan a little bit today
[1:27:53] and then we step in tomorrow and we
[1:27:54] learn a little bit more so we plan to
[1:27:56] maybe change our routes and change this
[1:27:59] and change that to our bitter
[1:28:00] understanding that God doesn't get a
[1:28:02] better understanding he's infinite he
[1:28:04] knows so he could plan before the
[1:28:07] foundation of the world even to this day
[1:28:09] he knew you would be sitting here today
[1:28:11] it's no accident that you're here today
[1:28:13] because God already decreed it in the
[1:28:16] beginning ain't that right he decreed
[1:28:18] you for this age you might say well why
[1:28:20] why do I have to live here amen why it's
[1:28:22] so horrible it's so hard it's so rough
[1:28:25] amen it's part of God's plan
[1:28:27] ain't that right it's part of God's plan
[1:28:30] so God is determined to fulfill his
[1:28:33] purpose and he'll do it and there's
[1:28:35] nothing everybody say nothing it's going
[1:28:37] to stop him nothing is going to stop him
[1:28:40] he gave that seed power to be
[1:28:44] transformed ain't that right so so and
[1:28:48] and hopefully we can bring it all
[1:28:50] together here but in the Garden of Eden
[1:28:52] the word of God was to hit you amen uh
[1:28:56] the word of God everything lived by the
[1:28:58] word of God the word of God was the The
[1:29:00] Authority in the garden every seed bring
[1:29:03] forth of its kind and as long as Man
[1:29:05] live by the word of God under that
[1:29:07] headship he could have dominion he could
[1:29:09] speak he could and it would happen he he
[1:29:12] didn't have to worry about sickness
[1:29:13] didn't have to worry about uh death
[1:29:15] didn't have to worry about you know the
[1:29:17] codes that you and I get and he didn't
[1:29:19] have to worry about you know the
[1:29:20] Temptations the Mind battles he didn't
[1:29:23] even know none of that existed because
[1:29:25] the word of God provided for him a a
[1:29:28] headship ain't that right but then he
[1:29:32] left her headship uh the word and listen
[1:29:35] to the LIE of the devil now notice
[1:29:38] brother Brown said the biggest lie ever
[1:29:40] told has 99 or 95 or whatever percent
[1:29:44] truth in it amen there's a whole lot of
[1:29:47] Truth so he says you know somebody could
[1:29:49] say well they was at the Tabernacle up
[1:29:51] here this certain night yes the people
[1:29:53] all gathered in yes they sung hymns yes
[1:29:56] the minister spoke yes that's right and
[1:29:59] then you know what they passed the
[1:30:00] bottle around and all them got drunk
[1:30:02] wrong he said see it was just the spirit
[1:30:05] fell down and they all got drunk see so
[1:30:08] it's just that much different when they
[1:30:11] not passing the bottle around see uh but
[1:30:14] a spiritual blessing of God fell upon
[1:30:16] the people they did stagger they did
[1:30:18] fall they did cut up like that but it
[1:30:20] wasn't a bottle that did it it was the
[1:30:22] Holy Ghost confirming his word with
[1:30:24] signs following see all of it seemed
[1:30:26] right is just but the bottle see and now
[1:30:30] I'd say was you up there oh yes was
[1:30:32] people there yes did they stagger yes
[1:30:34] see that's all right but that one thing
[1:30:37] ain't that right so that's how close it
[1:30:39] is just one word see and all these
[1:30:41] things so the first lie that was told in
[1:30:44] the garden had 99 truth in it see Satan
[1:30:47] admitted that what God Said was true but
[1:30:50] notice what he said you surely will not
[1:30:52] die but God said you surely will die but
[1:30:55] he just out of that one word right there
[1:30:58] and it changed the whole course of
[1:31:00] Nature and and this is where we got so
[1:31:02] brother Brandon said see the unbeliever
[1:31:04] will have to have a little bit of God's
[1:31:07] word to twist it around to make it fit
[1:31:10] the Creed and to make it more deceitful
[1:31:12] he'll say oh I believe Jesus Christ is
[1:31:15] the Son of God I believe God is the
[1:31:16] father of Jesus Christ I believe all
[1:31:18] these other things but when it comes
[1:31:20] down to this other part oh that's for
[1:31:23] another day see there's the LIE of it
[1:31:25] ain't that right that's right see he's
[1:31:27] trying trying to twist a little of the
[1:31:29] word of the right word around to make it
[1:31:32] deceiving to the people ain't that right
[1:31:34] so this is this is and you just pardon
[1:31:36] me but this is what makes me leery of
[1:31:39] men who say they believe in the message
[1:31:41] brother Brandon being a prophet and all
[1:31:43] that but then they tell us but but you
[1:31:46] know you got to watch some of what he
[1:31:47] says because that's his opinions you you
[1:31:51] understand then and and and he got this
[1:31:53] certain subject from uh Darwin and and
[1:31:56] and he was you know uh this this little
[1:31:59] portion you know come from the Civil War
[1:32:01] and all that and brother Brandon was
[1:32:02] just caught up in all that and and so
[1:32:05] that that was his inspiration and and
[1:32:07] things like that see well to me that's
[1:32:10] where the LIE is you understand what I'm
[1:32:12] saying either you believe it or you
[1:32:14] don't believe it you know and and so or
[1:32:16] you know they they tell us that brother
[1:32:18] bran was the prophet of Malachi 4 but
[1:32:20] would turn around and willfully teach
[1:32:22] things contrary to what he taught such
[1:32:25] as adoption seven Thunders and the
[1:32:27] godhead and Etc or they teach that the
[1:32:31] wise virgin in Matthew 25 isn't the
[1:32:33] bride of Christ and and and and and
[1:32:35] these things well see that's where the
[1:32:37] LIE becomes that's that's where that
[1:32:39] little twisting up and and that's what
[1:32:42] causes the confusion ain't that right
[1:32:44] well see that's what Satan does he he
[1:32:46] sure we believe in tongues but when they
[1:32:48] when they when they take it out of
[1:32:50] context and they and they and they're
[1:32:52] not doing it way brother Brown I'm
[1:32:53] taught it something's got to be wrong
[1:32:55] with that sure we believe in
[1:32:57] interpretation of tongues but but when
[1:32:59] they do it outside of what brother
[1:33:01] Branham taught us then there's something
[1:33:03] wrong with that yeah you understand what
[1:33:04] I'm saying and and so uh uh if you
[1:33:08] notice the seed that God planted in the
[1:33:11] garden became deformed a man uh uh
[1:33:15] because Eve believe Satan's lie a man
[1:33:20] and anything that is deformed uh uh is
[1:33:24] taken from its original state in other
[1:33:27] words is there something wrong with it
[1:33:29] and and at deform means to to pervert to
[1:33:32] be changed over uh you know brother Ram
[1:33:35] talked about uh uh you know the farmers
[1:33:38] you know they're in Kentucky and I'm
[1:33:39] sure here too but uh uh uh where they
[1:33:42] they plant their whole fields of corn
[1:33:45] and all that and but after a while they
[1:33:48] have to get that hole and they start
[1:33:49] going around digging digging and and
[1:33:52] because what what it is is there's
[1:33:54] creepers that are growing up and they're
[1:33:56] trying to wrap around that corn and
[1:33:59] calls it to lean a certain way and and
[1:34:02] so they have to go out there and chop
[1:34:03] them with creepers out because they want
[1:34:06] a straight corn they they know what they
[1:34:08] planted they they know and they that's
[1:34:11] what they're after whatever I planted in
[1:34:13] the ground that's what I'm after and
[1:34:16] this creeper is trying to go in there
[1:34:17] and choke the life of it a man to deform
[1:34:20] it to not make it to wealth the farmer
[1:34:22] wants it to be you understand what I'm
[1:34:24] saying amen see you you can't just plant
[1:34:27] some thing and then just leave it you
[1:34:29] got to cultivate it amen and that's
[1:34:31] every one of us here amen just because
[1:34:33] you're in the message don't mean you
[1:34:34] just sit there and says well I just
[1:34:36] believe in a prophet no you've got to
[1:34:37] cultivate this thing every day of your
[1:34:39] life
[1:34:42] that's right you got to cultivate it
[1:34:45] because things creep in very easily so
[1:34:48] he says see if you didn't get those
[1:34:49] Creepers out where the corn was in the
[1:34:52] road like this then the creeper would
[1:34:54] reach over and grab a hold of that corn
[1:34:55] wrap itself around gradually so easy so
[1:34:59] slightly that you would hardly tell it
[1:35:02] was wrapping and finally it gets
[1:35:04] stronger and stronger and it pulls that
[1:35:05] core until it's deformed pulls it
[1:35:08] against itself wraps it around its own
[1:35:10] Vine deforming it from what it was to
[1:35:13] something else yet it's corn
[1:35:17] but he's before it's deformed corn can
[1:35:20] you say man well this is what's happened
[1:35:22] is God planted his sin see his seed of
[1:35:25] Sons and Daughters of God but the
[1:35:28] creeper was able to wrap itself around
[1:35:31] and deform sons of God you understand
[1:35:35] what I'm saying deform it see to where
[1:35:38] they now sit in denominations and bound
[1:35:41] by the Creeds and traditions of men they
[1:35:43] have no power to be sons of God they
[1:35:45] have no Liberty to be sons of God they
[1:35:47] can't be what God created them to be you
[1:35:50] understand what I'm saying to where that
[1:35:52] that when we talk about man being God it
[1:35:55] just foreign to us when we talk about
[1:35:57] overcoming it's foreign to the people
[1:36:00] when we talk about these things see
[1:36:02] because it's it's still the same seed
[1:36:05] but yet made in another way ain't that
[1:36:09] right so well what what done it what
[1:36:11] what deformed the the seed of Sons and
[1:36:13] Daughters of God by twisting the word
[1:36:17] by twisting the word Satan preached his
[1:36:19] Gospel of knowledge in the Garden of
[1:36:21] Eden and brother Brown said he has took
[1:36:24] that knowledge perverted knowledge
[1:36:26] contrary to the word and will and plan
[1:36:29] of God ain't that right he says now he
[1:36:33] has had 6 000 years to do just exactly
[1:36:36] what God did only in a perverted way and
[1:36:41] took the same amount of time to bring
[1:36:43] his own Eden we're not living in God's
[1:36:46] Eden we're living in Satan's Eden amen
[1:36:50] that's right it's it's an age it's a
[1:36:52] time of perversion now he has got an
[1:36:55] Eden here on Earth it's filled with
[1:36:57] wisdom and knowledge that was his gospel
[1:37:00] at the beginning knowledge wisdom
[1:37:02] science and God never did cater to such
[1:37:05] as them things no sir so now notice the
[1:37:09] prophet said now Satan could not dig up
[1:37:11] them seeds he couldn't dig them up and
[1:37:14] and Destroy them he could not destroy
[1:37:16] them so so what he done is he sprayed
[1:37:19] them with poison and it deformed the
[1:37:22] seed it didn't bring forth Its Right
[1:37:25] Kind it deformed The Original Seed and
[1:37:29] and that's what all religious programs
[1:37:32] are doing today a man programs of
[1:37:35] religion see they're still Sons and
[1:37:38] Daughters of God but it's being deformed
[1:37:40] they go to church wanting to do right
[1:37:42] and none never enters a nunnery to be a
[1:37:45] mean woman a minister never goes to
[1:37:47] school just to be a bad man you never
[1:37:50] join Church shake hands and put your
[1:37:52] name on the book or whatever you do in
[1:37:54] your church to be a bad person you do
[1:37:56] that to be a good person but it's the
[1:37:59] deception it's the deformity that does
[1:38:02] it Satan sprayed it God never had an
[1:38:06] organization and there is no such thing
[1:38:08] found anywhere in the words of God can
[1:38:11] you say man so see so these things that
[1:38:15] we just mentioned Bible schools sin and
[1:38:18] denomination they're not making
[1:38:19] Christian people they're not making Sons
[1:38:22] and Daughters of God they're not making
[1:38:24] them back into a Powerhouse for God look
[1:38:27] at people look at the Pentecost even on
[1:38:29] Azusa Street we just take that of the
[1:38:33] power of God that fell well even Wesley
[1:38:35] demonstrated the power of God Luther
[1:38:36] just demonstrated the power of God and
[1:38:39] now look where they set today just an
[1:38:41] old dried up 30 minutes sermon and and
[1:38:43] and they take the blood out they take
[1:38:45] the power out they take the Holy Ghost
[1:38:47] out they take the move of God now God
[1:38:49] can't do anything in them churches
[1:38:51] anymore amen and the people now they
[1:38:53] they are more it's about entertainment
[1:38:55] now they're more involved in sports
[1:38:57] they're more involved in television
[1:38:58] they're more involved in this why why
[1:39:01] why would they do it because there ain't
[1:39:02] no power of God to arrest their hearts
[1:39:05] and the young people are leaving the
[1:39:07] churches and and they're going out and
[1:39:09] doing their own thing and getting caught
[1:39:10] up in all kinds of sin begin and the
[1:39:13] prophet blame the church he blamed the
[1:39:15] weakness of the pulpit preachers don't
[1:39:17] preach against sin anymore and all that
[1:39:19] see it's only leaving the people
[1:39:21] deformed oh I'm a Christian or well
[1:39:23] they've even got to where they don't say
[1:39:25] I'm a Christian anymore I'm Baptist I'm
[1:39:26] Pentecostal I'm I'm Methodist I'm that
[1:39:29] I'm this and I'm the no relationship
[1:39:31] with God anymore that's a deformed
[1:39:34] Society can you say Amen so they're not
[1:39:37] making people Christians and bringing
[1:39:40] them back to original but rather
[1:39:41] deforming them making them something
[1:39:44] other than what God has called them to
[1:39:47] be
[1:39:48] oh my ain't many anymore coming to
[1:39:52] church is just a duty more than just a
[1:39:55] desire and an expectation to see God
[1:39:57] move they just come because it's a it's
[1:40:00] a religious Duty let's do it you know
[1:40:01] Justice let's clock into our time and
[1:40:04] let's move on you understand what I'm
[1:40:05] saying amen see but but notice now
[1:40:08] they're making them something other than
[1:40:10] what God called them to be Matthew 15
[1:40:13] and 6 Jesus told the religious teachers
[1:40:16] of this day you have made the word of
[1:40:18] God or the Commandment of God of none
[1:40:21] effect by your Traditions Mark 7 13 make
[1:40:24] him the word of God of none effect
[1:40:26] through your Traditions which you have
[1:40:28] delivered and many such thing like
[1:40:30] things you do ain't that right see so so
[1:40:33] they're making the word of God of no
[1:40:35] effect God wants his word to prosper God
[1:40:37] wants his word to succeed and it will
[1:40:40] succeed it will everybody say it will
[1:40:43] succeed but it ain't going to succeed by
[1:40:45] denomination it ain't going to succeed
[1:40:47] amen by Seminary you can read this Bible
[1:40:50] backward and forward to a thousand years
[1:40:52] of your time name and it still don't
[1:40:55] make you a Christian
[1:40:57] oh but God's going to have his word
[1:40:59] Prosper
[1:41:01] can you say Amen but notice Satan made
[1:41:04] the word of God of no effect in the
[1:41:05] beginning
[1:41:06] that's exactly what happened unbelief
[1:41:09] and doubt that was his poison spray his
[1:41:12] unbelief and doubt he sprayed the seed
[1:41:14] with poison unbelief and doubt and Satan
[1:41:17] filled that cavity with knowledge and
[1:41:19] Science and civilization and it formed
[1:41:22] the whole entire creation of God
[1:41:25] now I I have to be honest we're living
[1:41:27] in an ages of of science technology but
[1:41:31] but but any of us again surely we can
[1:41:34] say that it's not better to us it's not
[1:41:37] made us better at all oh yeah we got we
[1:41:40] got fast cars yeah we we can instead of
[1:41:43] you know sending smoke signals to send a
[1:41:45] message we we you know we can email now
[1:41:48] and and like reading westerns you know
[1:41:51] and how they had to send that by
[1:41:52] telegram you know or or they had to send
[1:41:55] a message and wait for months to get it
[1:41:56] back and and now we just get on our
[1:41:59] computer you know and and push the
[1:42:01] button and they already got it you know
[1:42:03] you're talking did you get it yeah I got
[1:42:04] it yeah yeah okay good we didn't have to
[1:42:06] wait for a year you know but but and and
[1:42:09] we say oh that's made us better but look
[1:42:10] at the deformity today we we're more
[1:42:13] involved in sin and pleasures and
[1:42:16] ungodliness than ever before so science
[1:42:19] technology and all these things have not
[1:42:21] helped us movies have not helped us
[1:42:24] television does not help you it it only
[1:42:26] takes your children and deforms their
[1:42:28] minds and to where they're killing now
[1:42:31] and they're this and they're that and
[1:42:32] they're it's and it's it's just proven
[1:42:35] the more scientific we become the more
[1:42:37] technology The More Everything yes we we
[1:42:40] do Drive we're not like some that just
[1:42:42] stay with the horse and buggy and old
[1:42:43] Betsy and all these things so we we are
[1:42:45] appreciative of them things but at the
[1:42:48] same time we understand that that that
[1:42:50] these things will kill you we're more
[1:42:52] softer than than we don't have to go you
[1:42:54] know we don't have to walk to school you
[1:42:57] know uphill both ways anymore you know
[1:42:59] we drive to school
[1:43:01] yeah
[1:43:03] you know you know I I we don't have to
[1:43:06] thumb you know uh to go see your
[1:43:08] girlfriends anymore we just Dad hey Pops
[1:43:10] can I can I use your vehicle you know
[1:43:12] yeah you better take care of that thing
[1:43:13] too you know and and ZIP down the road
[1:43:16] we don't know any you know the pressures
[1:43:18] and all that that they had as far as the
[1:43:21] old ways you know I mean I'm thinking of
[1:43:22] camping you know and and you know I this
[1:43:25] was this was really nice you know and
[1:43:28] and and and I was telling the children
[1:43:29] we really have a luxury here you know uh
[1:43:32] uh because when we want to build a fire
[1:43:33] we don't have to rub sticks you know
[1:43:36] come on now I mean this is the this is
[1:43:37] the good old days you know we don't have
[1:43:39] to rub sticks and and and we just you
[1:43:42] know put a little coal there and spray
[1:43:43] it with with lighter fluid and I didn't
[1:43:46] want to tell you all my secrets but I
[1:43:47] want to you know and then put wood on
[1:43:49] top and it just catches Rod off you know
[1:43:51] I mean it was just great you're sleeping
[1:43:53] at 10. y'all thought we were really
[1:43:54] rubbing it oh no no no no we brought our
[1:43:56] mattress you know put it right in that
[1:43:58] tent it was just it was just a way of
[1:44:01] life you know so we had it a lot easier
[1:44:03] than they did back then you know and and
[1:44:06] these things but but it's technology
[1:44:08] everything has moved up and but it
[1:44:10] hasn't helped us in in we become softer
[1:44:13] ain't that right but but see in the
[1:44:16] beginning Satan sprayed it with doubt
[1:44:18] and believe unbelief and and so
[1:44:22] corinneathon made the word of God of no
[1:44:24] effect to Israel by exalting themselves
[1:44:27] over the real revealed word of God when
[1:44:30] Jesus came to the Earth the world lay in
[1:44:33] utter chaos and and and the prophet said
[1:44:36] it lay in all kinds of religion washing
[1:44:38] pots and washing hands wearing different
[1:44:41] robes and bonnets and so forth all of
[1:44:43] these things and the he says the genuine
[1:44:46] Israel of God had been so perverted from
[1:44:49] the laws and statues of God and and and
[1:44:52] John 8 and 44 Jesus said you're of your
[1:44:56] father the devil and the lust or the
[1:44:58] works of your father you will do he was
[1:45:01] a murderer from the beginning and bold
[1:45:02] not in the truth because there is no
[1:45:05] truth in him ain't that right and so uh
[1:45:08] uh uh to be honest Jesus identifies uh
[1:45:12] uh them as being children of of Satan
[1:45:15] who who who killed the effects of the
[1:45:18] word to the people amen they they taught
[1:45:20] for uh Doctrine traditions of men and it
[1:45:23] killed the effects of the word to the
[1:45:25] people and so today the churches are
[1:45:28] exalting itself over the word of God and
[1:45:31] look what they are producing a people
[1:45:33] who are ignorant of God's promised word
[1:45:36] for this age
[1:45:37] religious yes very religious Church
[1:45:40] going and and doing religious Duty yes
[1:45:43] but God promised a word for this age
[1:45:46] can you say amen he promised a word for
[1:45:48] this age and so brother Brown says in
[1:45:51] her deformed seat of knowledge program
[1:45:52] has caused the whole race to be
[1:45:55] scientifically ignorant of the word of
[1:45:57] God God right here on Earth doing the
[1:46:00] things that he is doing by his promised
[1:46:02] word and they ignore it and walk away
[1:46:04] because they are scientifically ignorant
[1:46:07] scientifically ignorant so they are
[1:46:09] willfully ignorant amen so today if you
[1:46:13] just pardon me as we we go and and I
[1:46:16] won't keep you much longer but today men
[1:46:18] have crucified the effects of the word
[1:46:20] today how do they do it well Hebrews 13
[1:46:24] and 8 says it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:46:26] yesterday today and forever you believe
[1:46:28] that but then they will come along and
[1:46:31] say well in a way he is see Jesus said
[1:46:35] in Mark 16 15 through 18 go ye into all
[1:46:38] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:46:39] Creature he that believeth then is
[1:46:40] baptized shall be saved and he that
[1:46:42] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:46:44] signs shall follow them that not believe
[1:46:47] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[1:46:49] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:46:52] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:46:53] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:46:55] and they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:46:58] they shall recover and what do men say
[1:47:01] well that was for another generation
[1:47:03] that was for another time God doesn't
[1:47:05] know do them things today and because
[1:47:07] we've got medicine and we've got this
[1:47:09] and we've got science and and all these
[1:47:11] things so there's no need for all of
[1:47:13] that see and right there they make the
[1:47:16] word of God of no effect to the people
[1:47:18] they crucified the effects of that word
[1:47:21] to the people can you say amen amen see
[1:47:24] so people doesn't think that it it
[1:47:26] matters well what teaching they said
[1:47:29] under and all that but to the elect it
[1:47:31] does matter it does matter amen why
[1:47:34] would God or why would Satan bring come
[1:47:37] into a form of religion and have his
[1:47:39] ministers to preach it and take that
[1:47:41] word has been ministered all over the
[1:47:44] the world today and yet they inject
[1:47:47] their own ideas and inject this why
[1:47:49] would he take the time to do this
[1:47:51] because it kills the effects of the word
[1:47:54] to the people it kills the Revival it
[1:47:56] kills the move of God it kills the
[1:47:58] experience of God to where we've got a
[1:48:00] generation amen rising up that is full
[1:48:03] of infidels they don't know the power of
[1:48:05] God and they're going into our elected
[1:48:08] offices and they're going in and they're
[1:48:10] passing laws against the move of God
[1:48:11] they're passing law against such a thing
[1:48:14] why because Satan was able to come in
[1:48:16] and spray his poison of unbelief and
[1:48:19] doubt when it come to the word of God
[1:48:24] denominational teaching kills the
[1:48:26] effects of the word every time
[1:48:28] theological teaching kills the effects
[1:48:30] of the word intellectual teaching kills
[1:48:32] the effects of the word and what does it
[1:48:34] do it kills it in the people
[1:48:36] kills it in the people can you say Amen
[1:48:39] right at the time of Jesus coming to the
[1:48:41] Earth the world again it lay in just
[1:48:44] utter chaos
[1:48:45] and because Satan's Children were doing
[1:48:49] exactly what he did in the Garden of
[1:48:50] Eden spraying spraying the poison of
[1:48:54] unbelief and doubt
[1:48:56] amen but if you notice the spirit of God
[1:49:00] moved
[1:49:01] again upon the seed that was
[1:49:03] predestinated
[1:49:05] moved upon the seed can you say Amen
[1:49:07] aren't you glad for that amen why is it
[1:49:10] that the spirit of Satan hates the
[1:49:12] spirit of God moving among the people
[1:49:14] oh my it's because the word lives when
[1:49:18] the spirit of God moves upon him see the
[1:49:21] power of transformation lays in that
[1:49:23] seed all it needs is the spirit of God
[1:49:26] to move upon it amen the prophet said
[1:49:28] the spirit of God moved upon the seed
[1:49:31] word he transformed translated and
[1:49:34] transformed Isaiah 9 6 of its promise he
[1:49:38] God was made human flesh to save that
[1:49:41] chaos time and when man was made in the
[1:49:45] image of God here comes God by the
[1:49:47] prophet for seeing it now remember the
[1:49:49] word the the prophet foresaw it just the
[1:49:52] same Prophet that seen Satan in his this
[1:49:54] last day of this educational program and
[1:49:57] things he has religious program the same
[1:50:00] prophet Isaiah 9 6 said unto us a child
[1:50:03] is born unto us a son is given his name
[1:50:06] Shall be Called counselor the Prince of
[1:50:08] Peace Mighty God the Everlasting father
[1:50:10] and of his Reign there will be no end
[1:50:12] and that word is God's word aren't you
[1:50:16] glad for that and the spirit moved upon
[1:50:19] that word and it formed in the womb of a
[1:50:23] virgin and a man a son is born not
[1:50:26] created he was born ain't that right and
[1:50:29] so we see that Jesus was that
[1:50:32] predestinated seed Behold a son he was
[1:50:36] that son when when Isaiah prophesied to
[1:50:39] hold a son a virgin shall conceive and
[1:50:42] shall bear forth a son then and all that
[1:50:45] Jesus didn't leave that scripture
[1:50:46] randomly he already had Jesus in mind
[1:50:50] ain't that right so the seed was laying
[1:50:53] right there in Prophecy in the word of
[1:50:55] God and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:50:58] that seed and it brought the the the the
[1:51:01] the seed from seed to plant it brought
[1:51:04] it from from word to reality Jesus was
[1:51:07] the reality of the scripture
[1:51:10] what God intended what God had in his
[1:51:14] mind Jesus was
[1:51:16] ain't that right
[1:51:17] see and so therefore the word that had
[1:51:21] come to the prophet spoke of him Satan
[1:51:24] during Jesus's time he tried to destroy
[1:51:26] and and deform that seed like he did the
[1:51:29] others in the beginning by spreading his
[1:51:31] poison of unbelief and doubt but the
[1:51:34] thing is he couldn't do it aren't you
[1:51:36] glad for that he he couldn't he couldn't
[1:51:38] do it he tried it he tried to destroy
[1:51:41] that seed uh when Jesus was on the boat
[1:51:44] asleep and Satan calls the winds and the
[1:51:47] waves to start trying to sink that boat
[1:51:49] but he couldn't destroy the seed he
[1:51:51] tried to deform that seed there at The
[1:51:53] Temptations uh when Jesus out in the
[1:51:56] wilderness I think for 30 40 days and
[1:51:59] and and and and and Satan kept trying to
[1:52:01] put a question mark If thou be the Son
[1:52:03] of God if thou be if thou be it's just
[1:52:05] like Jesus like Satan does us he puts a
[1:52:07] question mark in our mind are you really
[1:52:10] saved if you are saved then do this if
[1:52:12] you really believe then do this and if
[1:52:14] you really this and you did right and
[1:52:16] and if we're not careful we saw fallen
[1:52:18] for it trying to prove that we are sons
[1:52:20] of God you don't have to prove that
[1:52:22] you're a Son of God for nothing Jesus
[1:52:24] didn't have to prove that he was the son
[1:52:26] of God he knew he was the son of God he
[1:52:30] knew that the word spoke of him and so
[1:52:33] as as he would Satan would say well it
[1:52:36] is written it is written Jesus come back
[1:52:38] well it is written it is written but
[1:52:40] Satan had a knowledge of the word but he
[1:52:43] could not put the word in its right
[1:52:45] place
[1:52:46] he he would take that word full of
[1:52:48] unbelief and he would just scatter that
[1:52:51] word Jesus had faith in the word and he
[1:52:53] had the ability to put that word where
[1:52:56] it belonged
[1:53:01] so why why couldn't Satan destroy the
[1:53:03] seeds you know what brother Brown said
[1:53:06] Jesus had been sprayed
[1:53:09] with repellent of predestination
[1:53:13] so he couldn't use his deception
[1:53:15] Jesus had a repellent
[1:53:20] go back to Camping you you any of you've
[1:53:23] been camping you know you got to have
[1:53:26] some repellent
[1:53:29] yeah
[1:53:30] and Judah you know I mean he was ate up
[1:53:33] just bumps all over
[1:53:36] he didn't stay in the tent with us he he
[1:53:38] wouldn't do the hammock thing and he had
[1:53:41] his little net but somehow the little
[1:53:43] bug found the hole in the net
[1:53:47] so he kept with him a bottle of
[1:53:48] repellent
[1:53:50] that stunk
[1:53:52] but Jesus had been sprayed with
[1:53:54] repellent too
[1:53:56] and Satan couldn't use his deception
[1:53:59] and so brother Brian said see the word
[1:54:02] said he would be here amen and there
[1:54:04] ain't no devil going to bother him and
[1:54:06] no other Son of God that's predestinated
[1:54:09] to take his place aren't you glad you're
[1:54:12] predestinated take your place
[1:54:14] you're predestinated church now I I hope
[1:54:17] I'm making a little sense to you today
[1:54:19] but brothers and sisters there's a
[1:54:21] Rapture coming

[1:54:52] message

[1:55:02] cannot do nothing about it
[1:55:04] he's trying he's trying to destroy you
[1:55:07] young people but he will never do it
[1:55:09] he's trying to take you out but he'll
[1:55:11] never do it he'll put sickness on you
[1:55:13] try to make you curse God but it'll
[1:55:15] never do it he tries every which way to
[1:55:17] get you to turn your back upon God in
[1:55:19] this message but he'll never do it he'll
[1:55:22] never weaken the faith of a
[1:55:23] predestinated seat we've got the
[1:55:25] repellent of predestination
[1:55:27] [Applause]
[1:55:29] and you say Amen
[1:55:31] so he sprayed you see he has sprayed
[1:55:33] with the repellent every Son of God is
[1:55:36] sprayed with a repellent Satan's
[1:55:37] poisoned denominational doctors don't
[1:55:39] even touch him at all he moves right
[1:55:42] along nothing going to bother him it
[1:55:44] didn't have any effect upon Him Jesus
[1:55:47] knew he was he had the faith in what he
[1:55:50] was he knew what the word said what he
[1:55:54] was and he had faith in the word of God
[1:55:55] can you say man why he was the word seed
[1:56:00] he didn't need Sensations he didn't need
[1:56:03] emotions he didn't need somebody babying
[1:56:06] him he didn't need somebody to
[1:56:09] prophesying over him yeah I hope you
[1:56:11] understand now I ain't against prophecy
[1:56:13] it ain't against all that stuff but I'm
[1:56:14] telling you we ain't on the emotional
[1:56:16] roller coaster Jesus could go through
[1:56:19] anything that he went through and still
[1:56:21] believe that he was a Son of God he can
[1:56:24] go through hell or high water and still
[1:56:26] stand on the word of God because he was
[1:56:29] a word seed
[1:56:30] foreign
[1:56:33] one day the spirit moved Upon Jesus
[1:56:35] again
[1:56:37] because there was some word about him to
[1:56:39] be fulfilled
[1:56:40] so the spirit of God moved upon him and
[1:56:43] the word come through the prophet notice
[1:56:45] Isaiah 53 and 7 he is brought as a lamb
[1:56:48] to the slaughter and as the Sheep before
[1:56:49] her shears is dumb so he opened not his
[1:56:52] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[1:56:55] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:56:57] generation for he was cut off out of the
[1:56:59] land of the living for the transgression
[1:57:01] of my people was he stricken so the
[1:57:04] spirit of God moved upon him because the
[1:57:06] word had to be fulfilled and it led him
[1:57:09] to Calvary amen and there he died and
[1:57:13] everything that was spoken of that seed
[1:57:16] if for that age was fulfilled in him
[1:57:19] there at Calvary can you say Amen but
[1:57:23] notice his death was not in vain it
[1:57:25] brought light in it life to all other
[1:57:29] predestinated seed that God had upon the
[1:57:32] Earth amen and he says here is the seed
[1:57:35] the spirit brings life transforming Sons
[1:57:38] and Daughters of God from the world in
[1:57:40] this dark chaos and to be Sons and
[1:57:43] Daughters of God and notice he redeemed
[1:57:47] us to every promise

[1:58:02] were caught up in Satan's a little old
[1:58:04] creeper Amen to where it was all
[1:58:06] enticing we tried to be a Christian and

[1:59:00] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:59:02] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:59:04] pleasure of his will Romans 8 19 for the
[1:59:08] external expectation of the creature
[1:59:10] Wade is for the manifestation of the
[1:59:12] sons of God for the creature was made
[1:59:14] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:59:16] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:59:19] in Hope because the creature itself also
[1:59:22] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:59:24] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:59:27] the children of God aren't you glad for
[1:59:29] that do you realize that word right

[1:59:49] elect of this day I say to you the word
[1:59:52] seed is here on Earth today
[1:59:56] do you believe it now if you give me
[1:59:58] just a little bit more time now amen but
[2:00:01] God took four thousand years to make his
[2:00:03] bridegroom masterpiece
[2:00:05] and the prophet said he has taken
[2:00:07] another 2 000 years to make his bride
[2:00:09] masterpiece and notice what he says in
[2:00:12] the Masterpiece it can only be a
[2:00:15] masterpiece when it's the perfect word
[2:00:18] it can only be a masterpiece when it's a
[2:00:21] perfect word so in other words couldn't
[2:00:23] be a masterpiece while them creepers
[2:00:25] were bringing us saying oh he got you in
[2:00:27] sin yes he did and and and we were we
[2:00:30] got scars of our past and what we've
[2:00:32] done and our failures and all of these
[2:00:35] things but then there came a redeemed
[2:00:38] Redeemer Amen to redeem us amen the
[2:00:41] Bible says we are Washed by the blood
[2:00:44] God's Own Blood Brother Brown says that
[2:00:47] word washed means loosed we are loosed
[2:00:50] by the blood of Jesus Christ and Prophet
[2:00:54] said if it's perfect blood then it's a
[2:00:56] perfect loosening

[2:01:02] loose from your past loose from the
[2:01:04] condemnation loose from the Mind battles

[2:01:13] to him I don't have to be a slave to him
[2:01:15] I don't have to be a slave to my path I
[2:01:18] am free as a Son of God why because I've
[2:01:22] got to be a masterpiece for this age and
[2:01:24] it can only be a masterpiece if it's a
[2:01:27] perfect word I say your past is
[2:01:30] counseled
[2:01:31] all right can you say amen amen your old
[2:01:34] flesh is canceled amen the prophet said
[2:01:37] your sexual blood has been dismissed
[2:01:42] coming back to perfect word
[2:01:45] I hope it's all right
[2:01:47] Joel 2 25 and I will restore unto you
[2:01:51] the years that the locusts hath eaten
[2:01:53] the canker worm and the caterpillar and
[2:01:55] the Palmer worm
[2:01:57] oh my
[2:01:59] God so listen to the restoration of the
[2:02:01] bright tree
[2:02:02] Brent talks about it in other places too
[2:02:04] but that bug it was one bug
[2:02:08] a man in four different stages
[2:02:11] and and it ate up amen throughout the
[2:02:14] church ages until the church was nothing
[2:02:16] but a stump that tree that bride tree
[2:02:18] was nothing but a stump brother Brian
[2:02:20] said what the Romans left they
[2:02:22] Lutheran's eaten what the lutherans left
[2:02:23] the Methodist eating and what the
[2:02:25] methodists left the Pentecostals eating
[2:02:26] until she's down to a stump he said the
[2:02:29] church is dwindling down amen but I will
[2:02:33] restore saith the Lord what will I do I
[2:02:36] will bring her back to her original
[2:02:39] condition
[2:02:41] what was your original condition as a
[2:02:44] little baby in in your mother's arms no
[2:02:47] no there's a far greater condition that
[2:02:49] you were in amen you you were full of
[2:02:52] stench he has a little old baby you
[2:02:54] might have been cute and cuddly cuddly
[2:02:56] brother will but you were as a stinker
[2:02:58] amen there was that old rotten nature
[2:03:01] that old rotten carnal adamic nature
[2:03:04] amen and as you grew up you begin to
[2:03:06] reflect that you begin to manifest it
[2:03:08] biting and hitting and pulling hair and
[2:03:11] screaming and letting to throw in the
[2:03:13] temper tantrums and all of that but
[2:03:15] there was a greater condition amen and
[2:03:17] that was in the mind of God ain't that
[2:03:19] right and so God says I will restore
[2:03:22] I'll bring her back to her original
[2:03:23] condition I'll bring her back to her
[2:03:26] original Doctrine I'll bring her back to
[2:03:28] the original word I will break every
[2:03:31] denomination into pieces and I will
[2:03:33] bring her back to my word
[2:03:37] and I say to you God is going to have a
[2:03:40] word bride in this age and I say to you
[2:03:42] she is here being made manifest as a
[2:03:45] word bride not reflecting our own ideas
[2:03:48] not reflecting tradition and doctrines
[2:03:51] of man but reflecting the original
[2:03:53] thoughts of God
[2:03:55] all right
[2:03:57] amen she is going to be an expression of
[2:04:00] his thoughts and it's happening
[2:04:01] we are living in the age of full
[2:04:03] restoration
[2:04:04] the restoration of the Bright Tree the
[2:04:06] restoration of God's Eden the
[2:04:08] restoration of Faith amen the
[2:04:10] restoration of the power of God in the
[2:04:12] church the restoration of what God
[2:04:14] planted on the day of Pentecost amen
[2:04:17] Luther's age did not bring the full
[2:04:19] restoration neither did Wesley's age
[2:04:21] neither did the Pentecostal age bring a
[2:04:23] full restoration amen they each had a
[2:04:26] restoration amen a restoration of this a
[2:04:29] restoration of that a restoration of the
[2:04:30] gifts amen all these things amen and and
[2:04:33] and and we went from one Church age to
[2:04:36] another from one denominational age to
[2:04:38] another and all these things but it's
[2:04:40] only in this age everybody say it's only
[2:04:43] in this age only in this age we hear a
[2:04:46] voice we've heard of us and come out of
[2:04:49] her my people come out of her my people
[2:04:51] can you say Amen don't you be damaged by
[2:04:54] them don't you be contaminated with it
[2:04:56] come out of her my people you didn't
[2:04:59] hear that in Wesley's age you didn't
[2:05:00] hear that in Luther's age you didn't
[2:05:01] hear that in any other age but in this
[2:05:04] age the because this is the age that God
[2:05:06] will bring full restoration to his
[2:05:09] church
[2:05:10] amen you realize we're not entering
[2:05:13] another denominational Church age
[2:05:15] the denominational ages are over
[2:05:18] if we could only grasp what that really
[2:05:20] means to us
[2:05:22] denominational agents is over
[2:05:25] why it's time for the word seed to bring
[2:05:28] forth of its kind
[2:05:30] and how is God restoring it all back
[2:05:33] the word returning in its pure form
[2:05:36] amen you realize that Malachi 4.
[2:05:40] is a work of restoration
[2:05:42] and when God promised I will restore
[2:05:44] saith the Lord he already had a prophet
[2:05:47] in mind behold I sin unto you Elijah the
[2:05:49] prophet before the coming in the great
[2:05:51] Dreadful day and it would be by the
[2:05:54] Malachi 4 that he would bring a full
[2:05:56] restoration amen see and so if sin and
[2:06:00] death and the fall of Man Came about by
[2:06:03] disbelieving the word if these
[2:06:05] denominations are cursed by God because
[2:06:07] they have accepted man's Creed instead
[2:06:09] of the word of God if the seed of God
[2:06:12] has been deformed because there was
[2:06:14] something added or taken away from the
[2:06:16] word of God then the original word has
[2:06:19] to be restored in order to bring
[2:06:21] everything back to its original
[2:06:23] condition amen and now we see why the
[2:06:28] angel Mighty angel of Revelations 10 1
[2:06:31] has come the spirit of God moving upon
[2:06:35] the seed word amen why because God had
[2:06:38] some Sons and Daughters Amen in his mind
[2:06:41] when he spoke about Rapture he already
[2:06:43] had us in mind and the spirit of God now
[2:06:46] is moving upon the word and now we are
[2:06:49] coming forth we are coming forth as the
[2:06:52] manifestation of the word can you say
[2:06:54] man amen now it's not just word on Bible
[2:06:57] it's now word made flesh as Jesus Took
[2:07:01] the word he become the word that was on
[2:07:03] the Scrolls amen and everything that the
[2:07:05] word said he would be he was the word
[2:07:08] became flesh living in a body and so is
[2:07:11] it today the restored word is not just
[2:07:14] where we understand the word the
[2:07:16] restored word is when it comes into Sons
[2:07:19] and Daughters of God and they come and
[2:07:21] reflect what God had in his mind in the
[2:07:24] beginning
[2:07:25] amen the mighty Angel has come to anoint
[2:07:28] that word see to anointed to the word
[2:07:30] anointed amen the anointing does not
[2:07:34] take us outside the word can you say man
[2:07:37] amen this is why the bride checks
[2:07:39] everything with a word every move these
[2:07:42] days we're not vulnerable people we're
[2:07:43] not gullible people no more amen we we
[2:07:46] we we why because we're word seed
[2:07:49] amen we checking everything we're
[2:07:52] Discerning Spirits brother Brian said
[2:07:54] you don't judge the man but you can't
[2:07:55] judge the spirit discern the spirit of
[2:07:58] something and see what's what's
[2:07:59] happening what's working behind the
[2:08:01] scenes okay and if you're gullible if
[2:08:03] you're sitting here and you're just
[2:08:04] gullible it's your fault because the
[2:08:06] message has come to expose every tactic
[2:08:09] of the enemy every tactic of the devil
[2:08:12] can you say amen amen so what deformed
[2:08:16] the seed in the first place the
[2:08:18] Antichrist teaching
[2:08:20] amen first John 2 and 18 Little Children
[2:08:23] it is the last time and as you have
[2:08:26] heard that Antichrist shall come even
[2:08:29] now are there many antichrists whereby
[2:08:31] we know that it is the last time ain't
[2:08:34] that right
[2:08:35] so the first thing that he was he's an
[2:08:37] antichrist Spirit he's an antichrist
[2:08:40] because he's against the word amen and
[2:08:43] that's what started the whole thing in
[2:08:44] the beginning brother Brown said that's
[2:08:46] exactly what done the whole thing was
[2:08:48] turning from God's word not because Eve
[2:08:50] might have given Cain a spanking one day
[2:08:53] see that wasn't what done it the first
[2:08:56] thing that done it done the whole thing
[2:08:59] was that she turned from the word she
[2:09:01] turned from the word and the first thing
[2:09:03] started the prostitution in the Church
[2:09:05] of the Living God Christ's bride she
[2:09:07] turned from the word and accepted Roman
[2:09:09] Roman Dogma in the stead of God's word
[2:09:12] what's happening to every organizations
[2:09:14] that done the same thing can you say
[2:09:17] amen and so John said that that Spirit
[2:09:20] was working in in the church uh in his
[2:09:24] day shortly after the day of Pentecost
[2:09:26] and and and the the Antichrist Spirit
[2:09:28] deformed the seed by being against the
[2:09:31] word so brother Branham says this in
[2:09:33] order to get back to the original God
[2:09:35] God has to speak again
[2:09:39] God has to speak again so to bring the
[2:09:43] restoration brother Branham said the
[2:09:45] word of the Lord would drop on the earth
[2:09:47] as he did it in the beginning and always
[2:09:50] and will restore back what what started
[2:09:53] it against the word and what does this
[2:09:56] fella supposed to do when he comes
[2:09:58] Anointed with God's spirit talking about
[2:10:01] Malachi 4 he just brings the faith of
[2:10:04] the children back to the fathers that's
[2:10:06] how he restores he brings our faith back
[2:10:10] to original original belief in the
[2:10:13] original word of God
[2:10:15] can you say man do you love him it isn't
[2:10:18] because you know a lot of people expect
[2:10:20] him to be in a Rapture while they're
[2:10:21] just sitting there on the television you
[2:10:23] know flipping through the channels and
[2:10:25] and and these things and and they say
[2:10:28] well I'm going to be in a Rapture and
[2:10:29] yet you're sitting under a false
[2:10:30] teaching a false doctrines and false
[2:10:32] this there is a reason God sent us a
[2:10:35] prophet
[2:10:36] to restore our faith back to an original
[2:10:40] word
[2:10:42] can you say man do you love the Lord
[2:10:45] isn't he wonderful
[2:10:47] see then that's why it would take the
[2:10:49] seventh angel that's why my prophet of
[2:10:51] Malachi 4 is connected with the seventh
[2:10:54] angel for Revelations 10 7 and when he
[2:10:57] shall begin to sound all the Mysteries
[2:11:00] shall be finished all those things why
[2:11:03] did it become Mysteries because men
[2:11:05] would insert their own doctrines and
[2:11:07] bring a mess of confusion to where we in
[2:11:10] this age it was just Mass confusion it
[2:11:12] was just total total chaos but God would
[2:11:15] send a seventh angel and he'd have to be
[2:11:17] a prophet so that's why we can identify
[2:11:20] that to be a prophet of Malachi 4 Amen
[2:11:23] to restore the faith he would restore
[2:11:25] the Faith by restoring the original word
[2:11:28] opening these truths up can you say amen
[2:11:31] and yes his message sounds weird sounds
[2:11:33] odd because he did not come with the
[2:11:37] same old school of thought he come with
[2:11:39] thus saith the Lord he come with the
[2:11:42] original mind of God and he would not
[2:11:44] come the way of a denomination he would
[2:11:47] not come the way of a seminary wouldn't
[2:11:49] come with just
[2:11:50] theology message of theology or whatever
[2:11:54] intellectual amen it would be amen the
[2:11:58] prophet said that the Malachi 4 would
[2:12:01] restore the faith he would change the
[2:12:03] thoughts of the people and brother Brown
[2:12:05] says this the end time message should
[2:12:07] meet in time conditions where they've
[2:12:10] got off the message ought to bring it
[2:12:12] back always end time message meets end
[2:12:15] time conditions all the way through
[2:12:17] scriptures it'll have to do at this time
[2:12:19] a call back to the original word
[2:12:23] he says why all while all them Scruples
[2:12:26] of denominations arguing their
[2:12:28] difference about their Creed and notice
[2:12:30] where they're coming they're coming all
[2:12:32] back to Unity now they're coming to
[2:12:33] Unity but where's it at not taking us
[2:12:36] through the word of God they're taking
[2:12:38] all of their followers through the World
[2:12:40] Council of churches come come come with
[2:12:43] let's all be United let's drop our
[2:12:45] differences let's all just be brothers
[2:12:47] let's be Brotherhood but how can two
[2:12:50] walk together except they be agreed the
[2:12:52] Unity comes by the word of God
[2:12:55] can you say man see so God promised that
[2:12:58] he would send us a true prophet of the
[2:13:00] true word with the message to return to
[2:13:03] the original word of God and the faith
[2:13:05] of the fathers to bring down the power
[2:13:07] of the Holy Ghost amongst the people
[2:13:09] with the power that will raise her up
[2:13:12] above these things and take her in at
[2:13:15] the same time do you love him if the
[2:13:19] musicians will come
[2:13:21] I got so much more to go but brother
[2:13:24] Brown said God isn't making Sons and
[2:13:26] Daughters you realize that
[2:13:28] this message isn't making Sons and
[2:13:31] Daughters it's not no you you just like
[2:13:35] I I couldn't make my son
[2:13:37] and daughter I I couldn't do that they
[2:13:40] were already in me
[2:13:42] right they were already in me
[2:13:46] we were in God's thinking before the
[2:13:48] foundation of the world
[2:13:50] see I cannot bring forth your son I
[2:13:53] cannot bring forth your daughter I can't
[2:13:54] I can't do that I have to only bring
[2:13:57] forth what was in me
[2:13:59] right
[2:14:01] and so is it today I can only bear my
[2:14:04] own sons that would bear my likeness and
[2:14:06] brother Brown says if you are a son and
[2:14:08] daughter of God then you were in God at
[2:14:10] the beginning you're his attributes if
[2:14:12] he wasn't there then then you never was
[2:14:14] or never will be
[2:14:16] but he said if you've got eternal life
[2:14:18] that life that's in you always was and
[2:14:21] you were in the loans of God before
[2:14:22] there even was a world
[2:14:24] see so what it means is you are a word
[2:14:27] seed
[2:14:29] God would send this Prophet for you
[2:14:32] [Music]
[2:14:35] and it would rest your heart
[2:14:37] and you would believe it and would begin
[2:14:39] to restore your faith back
[2:14:42] and before you know it you see
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:50] there's nothing that can destroy the
[2:14:52] creepers in your life
[2:14:56] except a prophet God's sending a prophet
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:03] as much as
[2:15:06] you know
[2:15:07] [Music]
[2:15:10] good as people do
[2:15:14] but Dr so-and-so can't destroy the
[2:15:16] creepers in your life
[2:15:18] some intellectual preacher cannot
[2:15:20] destroy
[2:15:23] the creepers in your life
[2:15:25] [Music]
[2:15:27] these conferences cannot destroy
[2:15:31] the creepers in your life
[2:15:33] you might have creepers in your own self
[2:15:36] you may have creepers in your home
[2:15:38] you may have creepers in your mouth in
[2:15:40] your marriage
[2:15:42] your children may have creepers that are
[2:15:44] deforming them a certain way
[2:15:47] [Music]
[2:15:50] that all the good as I've told you all
[2:15:52] the good the literature and all the
[2:15:55] books and all these things to train you
[2:15:56] how to do this and this and all their
[2:15:58] steps of programs that they have for you
[2:16:00] to do
[2:16:01] will never change and never loosen them
[2:16:04] creepers never break the power of them
[2:16:06] creepers in your mind
[2:16:07] God sent a prophet
[2:16:10] to bring a restoration of faith
[2:16:12] a faith
[2:16:14] that you could have in the word of God
[2:16:18] and as you begin to believe in that word
[2:16:20] something begins to take place
[2:16:24] one creeper loses its hold and another
[2:16:26] creeper loses its hold
[2:16:28] and another creeper loses its hold and
[2:16:31] you're finding yourself back to being
[2:16:33] sons of God
[2:16:34] with the power and authority
[2:16:37] that you can speak over the situation
[2:16:41] that's what you need is not intellectual
[2:16:44] what you need is the power of God to
[2:16:48] sweep over the sea to break them
[2:16:49] creepers in your life
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:16:53] can you say man
[2:16:57] so you were in the loans of God and in
[2:16:59] this day the word the word is taking
[2:17:01] flesh again in this age
[2:17:04] aren't you glad for that the word to be
[2:17:07] brought back the manifestation of the
[2:17:09] word and today we're not in the seed
[2:17:12] stage
[2:17:15] as when locking a farmer goes out and
[2:17:18] plants seed in the dirt
[2:17:20] we're not in that stage
[2:17:24] we already been planted
[2:17:27] God planted that seed there in his
[2:17:30] church on the day of Pentecost God
[2:17:32] planted us as sons of God in his mind
[2:17:34] before the foundation of the world
[2:17:38] so then what are we back to seed yes
[2:17:40] seed Original Seed not deformed seed
[2:17:44] and we're maturing in the presence of
[2:17:47] God
[2:17:48] can you say Amen we're maturing
[2:17:52] or bearing witness of what seat we are
[2:17:55] you love the Lord
[2:17:56] isn't he wonderful
[2:17:58] appreciate your patience this morning I
[2:18:00] trust it was a help
[2:18:02] I love the Lord
[2:18:04] amen what song
[2:18:07] amen sing it now oh consume
[2:18:12] [Music]

[2:19:33] Bless The Broken Pieces Of My Life
[2:19:39] Let Me Be You
[2:19:44] say Brother Martin I've got a long ways
[2:19:46] to go that's okay
[2:19:50] God's power can change in a moment's
[2:19:52] time
[2:19:53] just keep believing
[2:19:56] take every word believe it
[2:19:59] get away from the world
[2:20:02] you'll watch the habits just begin to
[2:20:04] die I thought of how that you know in
[2:20:07] the fall
[2:20:09] leaves fall from a tree but not every
[2:20:11] leaf falls from that tree
[2:20:15] he's like well how's that all dead leaf
[2:20:18] how's it going to drop off for New Life
[2:20:21] if you watch
[2:20:22] when the spring comes that life begins
[2:20:25] to push them old leaves off
[2:20:28] and I thought that's so true
[2:20:30] just because you give your heart to the
[2:20:32] Lord doesn't mean that you still ain't
[2:20:34] got things that God has to deal with
[2:20:37] but as that life that new life begins to
[2:20:39] press itself and you begin to yield to
[2:20:42] that life and that life begins to take
[2:20:44] over it just begins to push that old
[2:20:47] stuff out of you it just begins to push
[2:20:49] it off
[2:20:51] I believe that's where we're at today
[2:20:54] just let the life of God just keep
[2:20:56] pushing it out
[2:20:58] before you know it you come back to
[2:21:00] original seed
[2:21:01] at original word you love him isn't he
