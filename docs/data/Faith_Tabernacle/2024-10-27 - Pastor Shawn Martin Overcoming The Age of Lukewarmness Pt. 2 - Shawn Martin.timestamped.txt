[33:37] just worked everything out we we had a
[33:39] place to stay we didn't have to stay in
[33:41] a hotel because that would have you you
[33:44] could just about imagine for 10 11 days
[33:46] it would have been a huge but uh brother
[33:49] open brother and sister open up their
[33:50] sweet for us and we were able to stay in
[33:53] a really nice place comfortable slept

[33:59] meetings and uh total of five actually
[34:02] six Services five of which I was able to
[34:05] speak at and uh the Lord just really
[34:08] come on the scene uh I I can't tell you
[34:12] how the Lord just come down in a mighty
[34:15] way uh I had prayed and I asked God to
[34:18] preserve my voice I was really concerned
[34:21] about that the change of the weather you
[34:23] it was warm up there just as warm there
[34:27] I I couple day few days that warmer than
[34:30] even here while you were all having a
[34:32] freeze they were having a a warmup but
[34:36] anyway uh God was good in the fact that
[34:39] I didn't lose my voice and uh one of the
[34:43] things that I prayed about which which
[34:44] can happen every evangelist every
[34:47] preacher that goes somewhere to preach
[34:49] and you got a bunch of meetings that are
[34:51] Clos
[34:52] together my desire was Lord may not May
[34:56] the inspiration flow as strong as it
[34:59] does at the
[35:01] beginning that the last sermon that I
[35:04] had to bring on last Sunday afternoon I
[35:07] had two Services 1 in the morning at one
[35:09] church and then that afternoon in the
[35:11] city of Winnipeg but God just come on
[35:14] the scene and he was able to I I felt
[35:17] the anointing come down on me the
[35:19] inspiration the word open up Divine
[35:22] illumination struck the congregation and
[35:25] several folks come up for prayer last
[35:28] Sunday in both Services asking God for

[35:45] said you know in one way I am but in
[35:47] another way I'm I would have liked to

[35:52] greatest satisfaction on I have is
[35:56] bringing consolation an encouragement to
[35:59] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and doing
[36:01] what I can in my little way that God has
[36:05] given me may I never fall short on
[36:09] anything even though I feel many times
[36:11] like a teaspoon compared to some
[36:13] Ministries and I don't want to compare
[36:15] myself we should never compare oursel to
[36:17] other Ministries but sometimes I feel

[52:53] and looking forward to a wonderful time
[52:56] in the Lord a wonderful time of
[52:58] fellowship and um amen and so um we
[53:04] always just have a a wonderful time and
[53:06] it's uh we get U different ones come in
[53:10] and and get to fellowship with them and
[53:13] you know uh there's no place uh no other
[53:16] people really to Fellowship uh that I
[53:18] like uh most of all and that's just a
[53:22] fellowship around the bride of Christ
[53:25] and uh we' got friends everywhere that
[53:28] we love to fellowship with and I'm sure
[53:30] you got co-workers and things that you
[53:33] like to fellowship with but there's just
[53:36] something that when you can Fellowship
[53:38] around Believers and have uh among like
[53:41] Precious Faith ain't that right and so
[53:45] uh but Revelations the 3
[53:48] chapter and uh the 14th
[53:53] verse and it says uh unto the angel of
[53:56] the Church of the lay Osan write these
[53:59] things saith the amen the faithful and
[54:02] true witness the beginning of the
[54:03] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[54:07] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[54:09] Thou Art cold or hot so then because
[54:12] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[54:15] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[54:20] amen then if you'll turn with me the
[54:23] Romans we read this actually last
[54:26] Wednesday Romans the 12th
[54:29] chapter and
[54:36] um going to read uh the first two
[54:46] verses says I beseech you therefore
[54:49] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[54:52] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[54:55] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[54:59] your reasonable
[55:00] service and be not conformed to this
[55:05] world but be ye transformed by the
[55:08] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[55:12] what is that good and
[55:14] acceptable and perfect will of God Amen
[55:19] you can have your
[55:23] seats and um
[55:29] I uh just had this uh thought on my
[55:33] mind and
[55:37] um um if I could use the title again
[55:41] overcoming the age of
[55:43] lukewarmness and it's um been just a a
[55:47] thought that has been on my heart and so
[55:51] I want to just bring it to you and um
[55:57] but we know that that God has uh seven
[56:01] allotted to the Gentiles seven Church
[56:04] ages and uh which is a a span of time in
[56:08] which God uh has set aside to uh form a
[56:15] bride um and and this time is not our
[56:20] time but it's God's time it's it's God's
[56:24] set time that he has allotted himself to
[56:29] to uh make a bride for Christ and you
[56:33] remember he promised that he would take
[56:35] a a people out of the
[56:38] Gentiles uh for for his name and so as
[56:42] we know it is it it it took God 4,000
[56:46] years to to make the Masterpiece the
[56:50] first Masterpiece which was Jesus Christ
[56:54] and um uh of course Adam uh was was the
[56:59] Masterpiece but uh we're talking about
[57:01] the bride of Christ and and and the
[57:03] bride groom and so uh the then the the
[57:08] Bride is a masterpiece just as Jesus was
[57:12] the Masterpiece and as it took God 4,000
[57:16] years to make the the the the groom
[57:19] Masterpiece it has taken him the prophet
[57:22] said nearly uh 2,000 years uh to make
[57:26] the bride
[57:28] Masterpiece and so the church ages is
[57:31] God's
[57:32] time um that uh he will fulfill his
[57:36] purpose and plan and it's it's not about
[57:40] our time to fulfill our plans and our
[57:44] purpose that's why we we didn't need to
[57:48] be in in all the church ages ourselves
[57:51] because that's not our time but but
[57:54] God's been through all the churches ages
[57:56] it and he's been working through all the
[57:58] church ages because it's his time and
[58:02] and so it it takes a spiritual insight
[58:05] to understand that that through the
[58:08] church ages God has been doing something
[58:12] he's been uh uh carrying out his purpose
[58:16] and his plan and uh if if if a man
[58:20] doesn't know what God has been doing
[58:22] then it it just looks like church
[58:24] history it just looks like like world
[58:27] events world history um you know and and
[58:31] that that would just be a carnal view of
[58:34] things and well then you know uh uh
[58:38] history doesn't have a spiritual
[58:41] significance to the unbeliever at all he
[58:45] just looks at what's been done and and
[58:48] and you know uh and more than likely
[58:52] well he just continues in a cycle and
[58:55] and we see that's what's been happening
[58:57] is just a cycle uh uh of of uh Church
[59:01] cycle of of things and and so uh but we
[59:05] know we know that that if if we're
[59:08] looking at what God's plan is and God's
[59:10] purpose history is not repeating itself
[59:14] uh not not with God but God is actually
[59:17] making something it's so so the church
[59:20] ages isn't just about man uh wandering
[59:24] in time just just you know happy
[59:27] go-lucky and doing the best we can but
[59:30] actually God is coming up to something
[59:32] he's he's he's doing something and so
[59:35] time time is not just going to continue
[59:39] on as as though we you know not not we
[59:43] per se but man human Humanity just lives
[59:48] as though time is just going to continue
[59:51] and there there's no stopping point and
[59:54] and so uh um
[59:57] and and and so uh uh and and and the
[1:00:00] unbeliever somehow thinks that America
[1:00:03] is just going to continue on and and
[1:00:06] they they think that there's hope for
[1:00:08] the world meaning that it can and will
[1:00:11] be a better place and and so they
[1:00:14] they're that's why they're indulging in
[1:00:17] in politics and they're they're saying
[1:00:19] this is the the the most important uh
[1:00:22] election that uh ever in history because
[1:00:26] because they know that it's you know
[1:00:28] it's a we're at a pivotal point and and
[1:00:30] they're wanting to keep America going
[1:00:33] they want to keep everything you know
[1:00:35] and and they know that that uh we're at
[1:00:38] the verge of crumbling and and and they
[1:00:40] know that but they don't know why they
[1:00:43] they know and they so so they're
[1:00:45] spending all their Investments and and
[1:00:48] putting in billions of dollars for the
[1:00:51] right candidate that they think is the
[1:00:53] right candidate uh so they can keep
[1:00:56] uh uh democracy and and preserve things
[1:00:59] and this and that and and it looks fine
[1:01:02] it looks good and and as and how true it
[1:01:06] is uh we've heard brother Braham say it
[1:01:08] but how in real true it is uh now that
[1:01:12] everybody's looking for a messiah
[1:01:15] they're they're looking for a messiah
[1:01:16] but why are they looking for a messiah
[1:01:18] to fix America to fix World governments
[1:01:21] to fix things to fix home life to fix to
[1:01:25] fix the problem s man's going insane we
[1:01:27] need somebody to fix this you know and
[1:01:30] and so so they they they want to fix it
[1:01:33] so we can keep on living in time and
[1:01:37] that cycle of time just to keep on going
[1:01:40] see but they don't know that God is
[1:01:44] finishing up his bride that's what the
[1:01:47] church Ages was about that God could
[1:01:50] have a bride for Christ and and and so
[1:01:54] God is Not concerned about America
[1:01:57] continuing to be a super Nation he's
[1:02:00] he's not concerned about who who gets in
[1:02:03] politics and he already knows who's
[1:02:06] going to be in politics he already knows
[1:02:08] who's going to be the president and that
[1:02:10] and whoever is going to be is going to
[1:02:11] fulfill his plan but I guarantee you
[1:02:14] it's not going to affect what he's doing
[1:02:17] it it's it's just not it's going to go
[1:02:19] right along with what he's doing and
[1:02:22] this is why we as Believers are de
[1:02:24] prayed thy kingdom come come thy will be
[1:02:27] done in in Earth as it is in heaven not
[1:02:31] my will but thine be done because God's
[1:02:33] will is what's important not my will not
[1:02:37] your will you you you could have plans
[1:02:39] and dreams and all that but you know I
[1:02:41] was thinking of of brother Anthony that
[1:02:43] just passed away 45 years old young man
[1:02:47] my wife 30 years old that passed away
[1:02:50] and plans and dreams and and these
[1:02:53] things but that doesn't matter God has a
[1:02:56] plan and and we we have to build our
[1:02:59] lives around God's plan God's will God's
[1:03:02] desire and and we don't want to walk
[1:03:04] outside of that see we want to be part
[1:03:07] of his plan I I I I don't want to be
[1:03:10] part of my plan and and you don't want
[1:03:12] to be part of my plan I don't want to be
[1:03:14] part of your plan you if you understand
[1:03:16] what I'm saying I I want to be part of
[1:03:18] God's plan that is the most important
[1:03:21] thing that we must be part of is we want
[1:03:25] to be part of this bride because when
[1:03:27] it's all said and done those that are
[1:03:29] not part of that bride is going to be
[1:03:31] Canon fod it's just facts there's some
[1:03:34] billions of people on this Earth that
[1:03:35] are just Canon fod you know they they
[1:03:38] just they're going for tribulation
[1:03:40] that's that's the facts and only those
[1:03:42] that are in this bride part of God's
[1:03:45] plan is is going to be in the Rapture
[1:03:50] and and so God is not concerned about
[1:03:53] some politician or religious organiz
[1:03:56] ation bringing World Peace amen that's
[1:03:59] not the peace you know they're crying
[1:04:01] for World Peace but you know what every
[1:04:04] believer should already have peace they
[1:04:06] should already have that anchor in their
[1:04:09] soul you know you uh you know what I
[1:04:12] mean he says I give you peace that the
[1:04:14] world cannot give so so you know so then
[1:04:18] the church ages is known as the fullness
[1:04:21] of the Gentiles the chch seven churches
[1:04:24] that John addressed as we talked
[1:04:26] Wednesday night were Gentile churches uh
[1:04:29] he did not address John didn't address
[1:04:32] uh the the the church at Jerusalem for
[1:04:35] that was a Jewish church mostly made up
[1:04:37] of Jews and and God had already turned
[1:04:41] to the
[1:04:42] Gentiles uh uh and and and uh turned his
[1:04:46] back to the Jews see and and so um uh
[1:04:50] now we we find that the Jews were
[1:04:53] allotted by God 71 weeks and and the
[1:04:57] prophet tells us that one week is seven
[1:05:00] years one week equals 7 years and so
[1:05:03] with in that 70 we period uh uh then
[1:05:07] then God deals with the Jewish people it
[1:05:10] it's a it was a time of Grace for them
[1:05:14] and and as we know the prophet said that
[1:05:16] 69 of those 70 weeks were already used
[1:05:20] up uh when when Christ come up on the
[1:05:23] earth and and then
[1:05:26] Christ and and Daniel even talked about
[1:05:28] that Messiah would be cut off in the
[1:05:30] middle of the week well Messiah uh
[1:05:33] Christ uh he prophesied for three and a
[1:05:35] half years and then was cut off and and
[1:05:39] and then uh uh uh uh God turned to the
[1:05:43] Gentiles which leaves uh the Jews uh uh
[1:05:48] uh three and a half years left of time
[1:05:52] of Grace ain't that right but see the
[1:05:54] three and 1/2 years does not start until
[1:05:57] the times of the Gentiles is fulfilled
[1:06:01] and and see as the prophet taught us
[1:06:03] that God doesn't deal with the Gentiles
[1:06:06] and the Jews at the same time even when
[1:06:09] Jesus sent his disciples out in the time
[1:06:12] that he was ministering to the Jews and
[1:06:14] part of that 70 weeks he told the
[1:06:16] disciples don't even go to the Gentiles
[1:06:19] don't don't go there it wasn't their
[1:06:21] time yet uh uh uh go to the Jews and and
[1:06:25] and uh uh these things so he never
[1:06:27] performed the Messiah signed to the
[1:06:29] Gentiles amen but but ain't that amazing
[1:06:33] that in the time of the Gentiles we have
[1:06:36] received the same sign that the Jews
[1:06:38] received that's to me that's that's
[1:06:41] that's that's Grace that's just Grace
[1:06:44] and and so uh uh and and and so we we
[1:06:48] find uh that that uh uh it was a time of
[1:06:52] Grace for the Jews at that time
[1:06:56] and so now the seven Church ages is the
[1:06:59] dispensation of grace in which God deals
[1:07:02] with that Gentile race that's us that's
[1:07:05] a that's who we are the gentile people
[1:07:08] and and it's a time of Grace for the
[1:07:11] Gentiles think of that now a time of
[1:07:14] Grace it's not a time of legalism it's a
[1:07:17] time of Grace it's it's not a time of
[1:07:20] law it's a time of grace and the prophet
[1:07:24] said as long as as that last as long as
[1:07:27] that time of Gentiles lasts God will
[1:07:29] still call men and women to his service
[1:07:33] amen and that's what we're believing
[1:07:35] that that there's still a little Grace
[1:07:37] somehow that that causes that's why we
[1:07:39] go out and try to win souls that's why
[1:07:41] we try to tell people about God Amen
[1:07:44] because we're believing that there's
[1:07:46] still Grace for them the Gentile church
[1:07:49] amen see uh but but we we know that uh
[1:07:54] uh the Le oosa
[1:07:56] age is the last Church Age and and uh
[1:08:00] you know um and and and seven is God's
[1:08:04] completed number it's seven is God's
[1:08:08] number of completion it's not our number
[1:08:12] it's God's number ain't that right and
[1:08:15] and and so we we find that it's been
[1:08:18] God's countdown every Church age God's
[1:08:21] countdown Amen brother brah said you
[1:08:24] know man counts down down to 10 you know
[1:08:26] and he goes from 10 backwards but God
[1:08:28] started from one all the way to seven
[1:08:32] amen countdown now uh Church we're we're
[1:08:35] at the end of that it's no more numbers
[1:08:38] to be counted they've been counted it's
[1:08:41] time for Blast Off amen see astronaut
[1:08:45] age that's that's the thing see and and
[1:08:48] so uh uh but the Rapture takes place
[1:08:52] when the church ages have run out Amen
[1:08:56] brother Bram said see the Rapture will
[1:08:58] come and the Gentile age will cease see
[1:09:02] so let me ask you why does the the
[1:09:06] Rapture take place well there's going to
[1:09:08] be billions of people still with their
[1:09:10] own ideas and they're plan and they're
[1:09:12] not looking for Rapture they don't want
[1:09:14] Rapture really uh uh if it was up to
[1:09:17] them they like I said would continue on
[1:09:20] living life trying to fix world problems
[1:09:22] you know and trying to pick the best
[1:09:24] candidate and and and and and and and
[1:09:26] these things that so so why does the the
[1:09:29] the Rapture take place is it because man
[1:09:32] is finished with his work on Earth no I
[1:09:36] I is it because the politicians have
[1:09:38] solved the world problems no is it
[1:09:42] because the church amen has been able to
[1:09:45] convert the whole world no see so that's
[1:09:49] not why the Rapture takes place the
[1:09:52] Rapture takes place when God is finished
[1:09:55] with his project not when man is
[1:09:59] finished with his there's not going to
[1:10:01] be one part of God's plan left undone
[1:10:05] when this Rapture takes place in other
[1:10:08] words every predestinated seat of God is
[1:10:11] going to be in that body when the
[1:10:14] Rapture takes place it won't come any
[1:10:16] sooner it won't come any later amen it's
[1:10:20] just because the the there see when God
[1:10:23] gets his plan finished there's no need
[1:10:25] need to hang around you understand what
[1:10:27] I'm saying amen you might have been
[1:10:30] saved 20 years ago but but God didn't
[1:10:32] take you then amen he's waiting for that
[1:10:35] last one he's waiting for the Perfection
[1:10:37] of the Saints amen that body to come to
[1:10:39] what he is after and then God will take
[1:10:42] us home a ain't that right so so the New
[1:10:46] Birth the prophet said is Christ is a
[1:10:48] revelation God has revealed to you this
[1:10:51] great mystery and that's a new birth and
[1:10:54] now what are you going to do when you
[1:10:56] get all that group together where the
[1:10:58] Revelation is perfectly in harmony not
[1:11:02] when everyone is perfect in Harmony on
[1:11:04] the on the uh political candidate amen
[1:11:08] that they want not when everybody is is
[1:11:11] perfectly in Harmony in what church they
[1:11:14] belong to or such and such perfectly in
[1:11:17] harmony see uh uh uh where the
[1:11:21] Revelation is perfect perfectly in
[1:11:24] harmony and God expressing it through
[1:11:27] his word by the same actions the same
[1:11:30] things that he did making the word
[1:11:33] manifest oh if the church only knew its
[1:11:37] position it will one day amen now I
[1:11:41] think he said that in 63 now look where
[1:11:43] we're at today I I have to tell you I
[1:11:46] just believe that there is a church that
[1:11:49] is knowing their position I just believe
[1:11:52] that and and uh uh it it it really
[1:11:55] struck me um uh with on a Minister's
[1:11:58] chat and someone put a minister put up a
[1:12:00] quote aen I think brother brandom said
[1:12:03] when you get to the when uh I I don't
[1:12:06] want to uh I'm going to paraphrase but
[1:12:09] he says basically when you get to God
[1:12:11] and and when you really get sold out to
[1:12:13] God then God can use you and and uh
[1:12:17] something to that effect and and and
[1:12:19] another brother he you know he just put
[1:12:22] up and he says well I'm I'm so glad that
[1:12:25] I am sold out to God I'm so glad I and
[1:12:28] at first it took me back like oh man
[1:12:30] that's pretty bold but I thought no
[1:12:33] that's the way we ought to be that's the
[1:12:34] way every believer ought to be is I'm so
[1:12:37] glad I'm sold out to God in other words
[1:12:40] God is using me in this age God is using
[1:12:43] me amen that wasn't a proud statement
[1:12:45] that wasn't boasting that's exactly
[1:12:47] where we're supposed to be if the church
[1:12:49] only knew its position it will one day
[1:12:53] then the Rapture will go when it knows
[1:12:56] what it is can you say amen amen if God
[1:12:58] uses you you ought to know that ain't by
[1:13:01] accident that's exactly what he called
[1:13:03] you for amen and whatever uh uh uh uh uh
[1:13:08] a plan that he has for you and so see
[1:13:11] she knows she knows she's coming to that
[1:13:14] realization of who she is in God she
[1:13:18] knows she doesn't belong out in that
[1:13:20] world she knows that this word is to
[1:13:22] manifest in her life she knows it and
[1:13:25] she stands by confident that she is
[1:13:28] called for this age see the bride is the
[1:13:31] only one out of this age that is not in
[1:13:34] confusion amen see amen she's the only
[1:13:38] one that's out of this confusion look at
[1:13:40] the confusion that we have today amen
[1:13:42] the home is full of confusion men
[1:13:45] doesn't know their place women don't
[1:13:47] know their place children don't know
[1:13:49] their place and and and and so uh uh man
[1:13:53] and and and wife woman they they they
[1:13:56] they refus to know their role in the
[1:13:58] home they they they brought such a
[1:14:01] confusion motherhood and and and
[1:14:04] fatherhood is is such confusion Society
[1:14:08] is full of confusion women want to be
[1:14:11] like men men want to be like women you
[1:14:13] know I we we uh and and by the way I
[1:14:16] really enjoyed the uh brother's
[1:14:17] Fellowship uh thank you for those that
[1:14:20] have come that came last night it was
[1:14:22] wonderful but on the way to to the place
[1:14:26] I I literally I just you know that it
[1:14:28] blew my mind had saw this tall guy with
[1:14:32] a miniskirt on with lit Tarts and and
[1:14:35] dress totally dressed like a woman and
[1:14:37] he was walking with a beautiful girl a
[1:14:39] real pretty girl and it and she just
[1:14:41] laughing with him just like like it was
[1:14:43] no problem you know and I'm like you
[1:14:45] know something wrong here you know used
[1:14:49] to we wouldn't want to be identified
[1:14:51] with that stuff you know you get across
[1:14:53] the street I'll stay over here but but
[1:14:55] it's coming to a confusion people's
[1:14:58] minds are confused see and so so uh you
[1:15:02] know Prophet talked about women wanting
[1:15:04] to be like men they they they they want
[1:15:06] to cut their hair they want to wear in
[1:15:07] the men's clothing and men going around
[1:15:10] wearing the women's arm uh undergarments
[1:15:13] you know what a woman's undergarment is
[1:15:14] it shorts that's what a prophet said so
[1:15:18] so when someone tells you that that's
[1:15:20] not what that means you better listen to
[1:15:21] what a prophet said men aren't to wear
[1:15:24] shorts
[1:15:25] it's a woman's
[1:15:28] undergarment can you say amen and and so
[1:15:32] but but see it has opened up a door of
[1:15:36] confusion and and to where the children
[1:15:39] you know uh we have children identifying
[1:15:42] themselves as a cat or or some other
[1:15:44] animal and and and you know we we have
[1:15:47] men identifying as a woman and and women
[1:15:50] identifying as a man and and they're
[1:15:53] they're getting into the sports and you
[1:15:55] know the problems that they're having
[1:15:57] today men you know identifying as a
[1:15:59] woman wanting to play in women's sports
[1:16:01] and and and they're taking all the
[1:16:03] medals and all of these things I mean
[1:16:05] come on man it it's sick you know but
[1:16:08] but that's that the world is crazy it's
[1:16:11] confusion you don't know who to believe
[1:16:14] anymore I I don't anyways and the
[1:16:17] prophet said that's where we've come to
[1:16:19] is we don't know who to believe wh which
[1:16:21] candidate do you really believe come on
[1:16:23] now I mean they're given the promises
[1:16:25] but how can they fulfill them amen and
[1:16:29] and and what this and what that see but
[1:16:31] the church is so full of confusion the
[1:16:34] doctor has become their absolute
[1:16:36] politicians have become their savior you
[1:16:39] know and the Sinners want to identify as
[1:16:42] a Christian but but nothing has changed
[1:16:46] them it's it's it's like the man putting
[1:16:49] on a a mini dress and and skirt and all
[1:16:52] that thing and and but it doesn't make
[1:16:54] him a woman and so is it when Sinners
[1:16:58] try to be Christians and and it's the
[1:17:00] same perversion it's a spirit of
[1:17:03] perversion you know and and uh uh I I
[1:17:07] just you
[1:17:08] know anyways it it just it's sickening
[1:17:11] you know and and so you you got Sinners
[1:17:14] that are you know claiming to be
[1:17:17] Christians but they act like the world
[1:17:18] smell like the world talk like the world
[1:17:21] and church we we got to a place the
[1:17:23] church is is full churches are full
[1:17:26] there's no rugged Faith anymore there's
[1:17:28] no prayer life anymore there's no
[1:17:31] Holiness anymore and and and even in our
[1:17:34] message ranks amen Holiness is dying
[1:17:37] it's dropping slowly amen and I'm not
[1:17:40] talking about you know being so far over
[1:17:43] there I'm just saying pre preach what
[1:17:45] brother Brandon preached live the way he
[1:17:48] lived amen if you just do that you you
[1:17:51] you'd put your skirts down a little
[1:17:52] longer amen you you would raise up the
[1:17:55] the the blouse a little little higher
[1:17:57] you know uh uh these things but there's
[1:18:00] no Zeal for the word of God everybody's
[1:18:03] got excuses today as to why they can't
[1:18:06] come to church and why they can't do
[1:18:08] this and why and they expect you they
[1:18:11] expect you to believe it well I don't
[1:18:13] have to believe your excuse I've got a
[1:18:15] Bible right here that tells me I've got
[1:18:18] a message that tells me that your
[1:18:20] condition is backslid condition you
[1:18:23] understand what I'm saying amen I had a
[1:18:25] man tell me just out the door that the
[1:18:27] Lord told him it was okay to smoke and
[1:18:29] it was okay to drink I told him you're
[1:18:31] just a liar I mean let's just look at it
[1:18:33] he I've been in the message all these
[1:18:35] years for 10 years I said you're a liar
[1:18:37] God would never tell you to do something
[1:18:39] like that when a prophet says that even
[1:18:42] a woman or a person that is smoking
[1:18:44] cigarettes got a very slim chance of
[1:18:46] making it and he says and you watch it
[1:18:48] watch that watch the Holy Ghost when
[1:18:50] every time a Spirit uh a nicotine
[1:18:53] someone smoking it always calls that
[1:18:55] thing out and condemns it you understand
[1:18:57] what I'm saying but we've got to a point
[1:18:59] in which it was Wednesday night and I
[1:19:01] told him I said you're exactly the
[1:19:03] living proof of what I preached tonight
[1:19:05] didn't even know you was coming amen but
[1:19:07] you're nothing but a lukewarm believer
[1:19:09] you're you're you're listening to a
[1:19:10] devil I said I ain't trying to be mean
[1:19:12] I'm trying to help your soul amen but
[1:19:15] but but there's something that's not
[1:19:16] right let's get back Amen to what has
[1:19:18] been taught us you you understand but
[1:19:21] it's the age that we're living in see
[1:19:23] it's an age of confusion usion it's an
[1:19:25] age of everybody wants to be relaxed
[1:19:28] everybody everybody it's it's an age of
[1:19:30] people's rights don't tell me what to do
[1:19:32] don't tell me how to live Don't Preach
[1:19:34] at me anymore I've got my own right I've
[1:19:37] got my own religion I've got my own way
[1:19:40] you understand why I'm saying it's a
[1:19:41] it's people's rights I've got a right to
[1:19:44] stay home if I want to stay home I've
[1:19:46] got a right to dress the way I want to
[1:19:47] dress I I've got a right I'm a Christian
[1:19:50] just as much as you are you understand
[1:19:52] what I'm saying but if the fruits ain't
[1:19:54] there something is wrong you understand
[1:19:57] what I'm saying and and so now see so
[1:20:00] the bride is not confused and becoming
[1:20:03] more confused as to who she is amen
[1:20:06] notice she has been given the spirit of
[1:20:09] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[1:20:13] of him to know everybody say to know
[1:20:16] amen see she's been given the spirit of
[1:20:20] wisdom not worldly wisdom Spirit of
[1:20:23] wisdom to know and Revelation amen if
[1:20:27] you if if you're getting wisdom and you
[1:20:29] ain't getting the Revelation it's of the
[1:20:31] wrong spirit amen because when the
[1:20:33] spirit of God came he came he's the
[1:20:36] spirit of wisdom and Revelation Spirit
[1:20:39] of Revelation Spirit of wisdom and that
[1:20:41] wisdom will line up with this word right
[1:20:43] here amen it's a revelation that gives
[1:20:46] us wisdom ain't that right amen see so
[1:20:49] so this bride is not like the people of
[1:20:51] Le osia age who claim to have need of
[1:20:55] nothing and know not that they're blind
[1:20:58] wretched miserable and naked now now
[1:21:00] think of this know it not brother
[1:21:02] brandom in the message knoweth or not he
[1:21:05] if you ought to go listen to it amen but
[1:21:07] he says if a man on the street was poor
[1:21:11] miserable blind and wretched and if that
[1:21:14] man knew he would try to hide himself
[1:21:18] ain't that right he would try to fix the
[1:21:21] condition he would try amen and if you
[1:21:24] gave him a pair of clothes and he knew
[1:21:27] that he was naked and knew that he was
[1:21:30] miserable knew about wretched and he
[1:21:33] knew that he would thank you for
[1:21:35] providing him some clothes he would
[1:21:37] thank you amen for giving a blanket or
[1:21:39] something to let him know and to cover
[1:21:42] him up you understand amen but see if he
[1:21:45] was naked he would try to get some
[1:21:47] clothes he would try to make things
[1:21:48] better and that would be a most pitiful
[1:21:51] sight to see a man on the street that
[1:21:53] thinks he's well dressed amen and and or
[1:21:57] dressed well and that he's rich and he
[1:21:59] has need of nothing and yet miserable
[1:22:02] necked just enough religion to make him
[1:22:05] sick and don't know it well that's where
[1:22:08] we're at amen and and brother Bram said
[1:22:11] you know what it is it's a sign of
[1:22:14] insanity now you know one of our
[1:22:16] problems today that you keep hearing in
[1:22:19] the news when someone commits a crime or
[1:22:21] whatever and they always put mental
[1:22:23] health problem mental health mental
[1:22:25] health mental health amen when when they
[1:22:28] when they do rape a per it's mental
[1:22:30] health when they when they kill
[1:22:32] something or kill someone these children
[1:22:34] were going into schools or or or killing
[1:22:37] their families and all it's mental
[1:22:39] health amen and and well the prophet
[1:22:41] already warned us that this age this Le
[1:22:44] odsan age will go in complete Insanity
[1:22:48] well see that's what the scripture says
[1:22:51] they don't know it they're in a
[1:22:53] condition but they don't know it amen
[1:22:57] they're not meaning to be that way but
[1:22:59] they don't know it you understand what
[1:23:01] I'm saying see and he says it's a sign
[1:23:04] of insanity so what we are seeing is
[1:23:06] both mental and spiritual Insanity see
[1:23:11] and so the bride by the message of the
[1:23:14] hour by the message of the hour has
[1:23:16] recognized who she is she knows that she
[1:23:20] is the original word of God she knows
[1:23:23] that she is an eagle not a
[1:23:27] hawk remember the hawk is too lazy he's
[1:23:31] too soft and lazy to fly into the
[1:23:34] heavenlies and kill fresh meat well that
[1:23:36] that eagle knows that she's not a hwk so
[1:23:40] so she knows the better than to follow
[1:23:43] and sit on a CL on on a line with a hawk
[1:23:46] and just sit there and be lazy amen
[1:23:49] she's got it within her to move up
[1:23:51] higher she's got you understand what I'm
[1:23:54] saying we do not compare ourselves with
[1:23:56] the church natural we don't compare
[1:23:59] ourselves with the religion of the world
[1:24:01] and religious doers and religious people
[1:24:04] amen we are eagles and we know we are
[1:24:07] eagles and if we know we are eagles then
[1:24:09] we do something about it it's those that
[1:24:13] don't know amen they don't know they
[1:24:15] have no idea and they don't do anything
[1:24:18] about
[1:24:20] iten but the Bible says she does know
[1:24:23] because she hath made her herself ready
[1:24:25] Hallelujah she's identified she's not
[1:24:27] confused identifying herself as a
[1:24:29] sparrow as a crow a buzzard amen a
[1:24:32] peacock hawk or whatever she's
[1:24:35] identified her with the word of what the
[1:24:38] word says she is an eagle no matter how
[1:24:42] hard the winds are she takes them winds
[1:24:44] of adversity and she Rises amen not
[1:24:47] going to let her beat her down not let
[1:24:48] the trial beat her down not let this
[1:24:51] skepticism beat her down amen not even
[1:24:53] let heart preach and beat him down amen
[1:24:56] she Rises on it amen if God has giv it
[1:24:59] to me then let me have it I want to rise
[1:25:03] amen I'm not going to be here I know the
[1:25:05] spirit of perversion tries to get up us
[1:25:08] amen maybe not to try to act like a
[1:25:10] woman you men amen but let us act like
[1:25:13] the what a world is and what the the
[1:25:15] world is doing going to church with one
[1:25:18] foot in church and one foot out in the
[1:25:20] world Amen I don't want to identify like
[1:25:22] that I am an eagle I am one I'm not an
[1:25:25] Earthbound creature I am an heavenbound
[1:25:28] creature and I will rise I am Rising
[1:25:32] spread your wings
[1:25:36] Eagle she have made herself ready she is
[1:25:40] the Overcomer Hallelujah now see we've
[1:25:43] never had a day like the one we're
[1:25:45] living
[1:25:46] in you know brother Ram said it is true
[1:25:50] that there has been greater days of
[1:25:53] persecution when the children of God
[1:25:55] were put to death on every hand he said
[1:25:58] yeah so so as far as that you ain't
[1:26:01] going to see a a greater day of
[1:26:03] persecution for the bride as it was in
[1:26:05] the with the apostles amen uh uh see
[1:26:09] that that's that was better greater days
[1:26:11] of persecution but notice how more
[1:26:14] treacherous it is today but to see the
[1:26:17] deceitfulness of the enemy we've never
[1:26:20] had a day like this that we're living in
[1:26:21] now it's the most cunning deceitful day
[1:26:25] and when I see that it brings this that
[1:26:28] the Christian has to be more on his toes
[1:26:31] today than he ever was in any age can
[1:26:34] you say Amen not that you have to be
[1:26:36] scared of your religion and and and and
[1:26:39] hide your testimony oh you don't have to
[1:26:41] do all that amen but see you have to be
[1:26:44] on your toes because the spirit of
[1:26:47] perversion amen deceiving amen can you
[1:26:51] say amen amen to where people think
[1:26:54] think they're right and they're totally
[1:26:56] wrong amen see the only way you can know
[1:26:59] you're right is when you have the spirit
[1:27:01] of Truth within you that's taking you to
[1:27:04] this word and you're living this word
[1:27:06] word by word and it ain't a preacher
[1:27:08] having to preach constantly to you on
[1:27:10] the dos and the don't there's something
[1:27:12] in you that is boiling up within you
[1:27:15] saying I got to do what God tells me to
[1:27:17] do amen I don't care what the doctor
[1:27:19] says I don't care what mama says I don't
[1:27:21] care what husband says or my wife says
[1:27:24] or the children say parents say it
[1:27:27] doesn't matter what they're doing out
[1:27:28] there amen I'm going to follow amen the
[1:27:31] word I'm
[1:27:34] identifying see now brother Bram said
[1:27:39] see back in the
[1:27:40] days back in the days of persecution of
[1:27:43] Rome to the church a Christian make a
[1:27:45] mistake he went into the arena and was
[1:27:49] fed to the Lions or something like that
[1:27:50] when they found him of being a Christian
[1:27:52] for his testimony but his soul was saved
[1:27:54] because he was purely unadulterated
[1:27:56] believer in God and gladly sealed his
[1:27:59] testimony with his blood as the veins
[1:28:01] let loose or holes in his body or and
[1:28:04] the blood bleed out he would scream up
[1:28:06] with real loyal faith and say receive my
[1:28:09] spirit Lord
[1:28:11] Jesus amen but notice this is a worse
[1:28:15] age than even the days of
[1:28:18] persecution he says see but now the
[1:28:20] cunningness of the devil now see makes
[1:28:23] the people people believe that they are
[1:28:25] a Christian when they're not see there's
[1:28:27] the thing you don't have to see it's
[1:28:29] more cunning a a more cunning day than
[1:28:32] it would be than when you had to seal
[1:28:34] your life away with your testimony see
[1:28:36] the devil has set every cunning trap
[1:28:39] that he can he's a deceiver and Jesus
[1:28:42] told us in Matthew 24 how this day would
[1:28:46] be that we're living in the most
[1:28:48] deceitful day that ever lives so close
[1:28:50] so close everybody say so close so close
[1:28:53] that it would deceit the elect if
[1:28:56] possible if it were possible can you say
[1:28:58] Amen see so so you can see the miracle
[1:29:01] of overcoming in this age it's it's a
[1:29:04] miracle for Overcomers and and because
[1:29:08] then if if if we're to overcome now
[1:29:10] God's already addressed the Overcomer in
[1:29:12] this age so there's going to be an
[1:29:13] overcomer how many Overcomers do we have
[1:29:16] huh yes sir Trials come your way your
[1:29:18] battled minds and and things just
[1:29:21] hitting you left and right but you're an
[1:29:22] overcomer amen well God's already
[1:29:24] written you in the book that you will be
[1:29:27] an overcomer ain't that right see and
[1:29:29] and but but don't take that overcoming
[1:29:31] for Grant it and and and attribute that
[1:29:34] to a natural Gene seed or well my dad
[1:29:37] was a preacher my mom was a real devout
[1:29:39] Christian and and well I just raised up
[1:29:41] in the mess of church don't don't you
[1:29:43] take that for granted amen you are an
[1:29:45] overcomer amen because it's a miracle
[1:29:48] amen it's a miracle that you overcome uh
[1:29:51] uh uh brother Matthew see see so so now
[1:29:54] you have to you have to know that you
[1:29:57] need to overcome before you can overcome
[1:30:01] ain't that right if you're in that spot
[1:30:04] that I have need of nothing and and and
[1:30:07] you know I've got it all well then what
[1:30:10] happens you don't know you need to
[1:30:12] overcome and and then then when then
[1:30:16] then you start getting your stickers out
[1:30:18] a little bit and you get offended and
[1:30:19] you get this think you think I need to
[1:30:22] overcome what you know and and these
[1:30:25] things but but see if if you know that
[1:30:28] you need overcoming then when the word
[1:30:31] strikes and the word is preached or you
[1:30:33] hear a prophet saying something and and
[1:30:36] and you know that it's not your life
[1:30:38] ain't lining up with that all of a
[1:30:40] sudden you think oh I got to overcome
[1:30:43] God helped me to overcome amen you ain't
[1:30:45] going to blame Mama for it you ain't
[1:30:47] going to blame everybody else for
[1:30:48] getting on to you you you just know
[1:30:50] there's something in your life that you
[1:30:52] can actually tell
[1:30:54] that hey this ain't right I'm I'm not
[1:30:57] you know and there's times Amen brother
[1:30:59] Terry I have that in my own life when
[1:31:00] I'm listening to a message and or I'm
[1:31:02] hearing someone preach and it Raks my
[1:31:04] hide amen and and you know sure the
[1:31:07] first thing you want to do is like you
[1:31:08] know
[1:31:10] well you know doesn't he know I mean why
[1:31:14] is he doing that for you know uh but
[1:31:17] then I I begin to check my life you see
[1:31:20] the very first thing you ought to do
[1:31:22] when something is preached and maybe you
[1:31:24] don't like it or maybe it's you think
[1:31:26] it's hitting you amen the thing you
[1:31:28] ought to do is say Lord is that really
[1:31:30] for me is that really for me I was
[1:31:33] listening to the the message this
[1:31:35] morning on straight As the gate and uh
[1:31:38] uh you ought to go listen to that one
[1:31:40] but brother brandom he came up and he
[1:31:41] said you know I don't have nothing you
[1:31:44] know he said but just the Lord just kind
[1:31:45] of struck a little something he said but
[1:31:47] I don't know what to say and in his pray
[1:31:49] said now Lord I'm just going to rely
[1:31:51] upon you amen and man he preached a hide
[1:31:54] burner you know and and and but but see
[1:31:58] the the the thing to do is is said
[1:32:01] saying well uhhuh I'm sure he you know
[1:32:04] we ate coffee you know we drank coffee
[1:32:06] two weeks ago so he knows a little bit
[1:32:08] maybe maybe you ought to just say Lord
[1:32:11] you know you put a gift in that man's
[1:32:13] life you know and and and and if if that
[1:32:17] if that is really hitting me God I want
[1:32:19] to know about it Lord maybe I don't see
[1:32:22] everything and maybe I don't understand
[1:32:24] understand it all but God I just want to
[1:32:26] know you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:32:29] not not lean to people's rights how dare
[1:32:32] you you you understand what I'm saying
[1:32:34] see and so you you have to know amen
[1:32:37] that you need to overcome before you
[1:32:40] overcome see it's a fight to overcome
[1:32:43] how many believes that it's a fight to
[1:32:45] overcome you're not in a picnic church
[1:32:49] it's a fight to overcome that's why you
[1:32:52] come to the house of God because when
[1:32:54] you draw yourself out and you're not
[1:32:56] among Believers you're like that little
[1:32:58] you're like that little old uh uh uh
[1:33:00] that little bull cow or what what
[1:33:03] Buffalo cow whatever that's out there
[1:33:04] and there's Lions all around amen and
[1:33:07] when you get away from the herd amen
[1:33:09] that old line knows your weakness and
[1:33:11] that's where he's headed is your door
[1:33:13] you understand what I'm saying that's
[1:33:15] why we need a body of Fellowship that
[1:33:18] that's why we need one another these
[1:33:19] people that think they can stay home and
[1:33:21] still be a Christian brother Braham said
[1:33:22] you can't you can't do it can you say
[1:33:25] amen and and brother Brown never amen as
[1:33:28] far as I know searching the scriptures
[1:33:31] and and and the message both Bible and
[1:33:33] message never promoted people staying
[1:33:36] home amen streaming and and not having a
[1:33:39] body Church to go to it's just the facts
[1:33:43] can you say Amen but what is it it's
[1:33:45] more easier to do these things because
[1:33:48] it's Le oia it's a spirit it doesn't
[1:33:51] take you totally out in the world but it
[1:33:53] takes you into to a state of
[1:33:54] lukewarmness that's the age we're living
[1:33:57] in a state of lukewarmness where you
[1:33:59] have the you have the form of godliness
[1:34:02] but there ain't no power in your life to
[1:34:04] back it
[1:34:06] up you understand what I'm saying so so
[1:34:10] now this bride she is the full
[1:34:12] manifestation of the vision that God had
[1:34:16] for his bride Masterpiece this is where
[1:34:19] we're at God's put the final touches on
[1:34:21] this bride oh yeah you got to go through
[1:34:24] the fire do you realize
[1:34:26] that how many knows that you got to go
[1:34:29] through it Church don't belly ache about
[1:34:31] it don't whine about it but instead of
[1:34:35] handling the trial the way you would
[1:34:36] want to handle the trial get on your
[1:34:38] knees get get get get on the message
[1:34:41] start listening to that message start
[1:34:43] reading that Bible and saying God now
[1:34:45] how do you want me to handle this trial
[1:34:47] how do you want me to do it I know my
[1:34:48] way I'll get bitter about it I'll go
[1:34:51] knock their you know the socks off you
[1:34:53] know I I'll I'll whatever but now we
[1:34:56] we're in an age this bride is now coming
[1:35:00] to the place of God how do you want me
[1:35:02] to handle it God what do you want of me
[1:35:05] you're sending this thing for me for a
[1:35:07] reason now God I want to handle it the
[1:35:09] way you want me to handle it can you
[1:35:10] sayen why because the the prophet said
[1:35:14] this bride will not be like the first
[1:35:17] Eve amen she will not be deceived she
[1:35:20] will not give in amen but so you've got
[1:35:22] to be tried in you've got to be proven
[1:35:25] let the devil you just come amen you you
[1:35:27] try her you do whatever I'll show you
[1:35:30] she's not like Eve amen don't you belly
[1:35:32] ache about it just say God I'm so
[1:35:35] thankful that I'm in your plan devil you
[1:35:38] will not have me amen for the prophet
[1:35:41] says I never done it in the
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:44] beginning Prophet said you never did
[1:35:47] fall that's right Hallelujah can you say
[1:35:50] amen amen glory amen remember you were
[1:35:53] not part of them that
[1:35:56] fell ain't that right so now the
[1:35:59] testings are
[1:36:01] coming the trials are coming what are
[1:36:04] you going to do about it how are you
[1:36:05] going to handle it give up sit in a weak
[1:36:08] State well God you understand where I'm
[1:36:10] at I can't overcome I'm having this
[1:36:12] problem they you know whatever and then
[1:36:15] you just just back off and your prayer
[1:36:18] life back off and your love life back
[1:36:20] off and your your uh dedicated life and
[1:36:23] back off and H I've seen a lot of people
[1:36:25] amen they get discouraged and before you
[1:36:27] know it they start listen to stupid
[1:36:28] devil and before you know it Holiness
[1:36:30] starts going down amen the tubes and and
[1:36:33] they start getting a little bit more LAX
[1:36:35] as though they've got an
[1:36:38] excuse you realize the Bible says
[1:36:41] there'll be many excuses in this
[1:36:44] day
[1:36:49] yeah see so the rapture
[1:36:54] after the Rapture has taken
[1:36:56] place the
[1:36:59] people that are left
[1:37:01] behind will continue on with their
[1:37:05] life continue on with their own plans
[1:37:08] fulfilling their own
[1:37:11] desires whatever the plans are get rich
[1:37:15] have enough money to where I get old I
[1:37:20] retire you know make sure the money's in
[1:37:22] the bank
[1:37:24] they'll still have them thoughts they'll
[1:37:25] still just be continuing
[1:37:29] on but the rapture's
[1:37:31] gone the people
[1:37:33] gone because there was that group of
[1:37:36] people that lined it up with God's plan
[1:37:39] and not their plan they lined it up to
[1:37:42] God's will instead of their
[1:37:45] will can you say Amen now see the
[1:37:48] Rapture is going to be a secret
[1:37:52] coming Lord the the unbeliever and the
[1:37:54] professed
[1:37:57] believer will never know brother brandom
[1:38:01] said see people will go right on
[1:38:02] preaching saying they believe they're
[1:38:04] getting saved and adding in the church
[1:38:06] and building churches and going just on
[1:38:09] just like they did in the days of Noah
[1:38:10] and so forth and not know it and the
[1:38:13] Rapture done
[1:38:14] P can you say Amen so those who make up
[1:38:18] the bride are the only ones who will
[1:38:21] know because the Rapture is for them
[1:38:24] amen can you say Amen you got to
[1:38:26] remember the bride everybody say the
[1:38:28] bride the bride is the pattern that God
[1:38:32] is working on remember he cuts out
[1:38:35] there's the P there's the there's the
[1:38:38] pattern and then he cuts out in the
[1:38:40] shape that he's wanting it the so the
[1:38:42] the the seamstress or whatever and and
[1:38:45] then she there there's that whole
[1:38:47] pattern but she cuts out of that pattern
[1:38:49] what she's after right and then she
[1:38:51] rolls up that other pattern and and lays
[1:38:54] lays it aside for another time that
[1:38:57] Remnant church that's going in
[1:38:58] Tribulation amen but now she starts
[1:39:01] working on this what she has cut out
[1:39:05] amen now we've heard The Voice come out
[1:39:07] of her my people come out of her my
[1:39:09] people don't you dare stay in there
[1:39:12] church come out of her my people can you
[1:39:16] say Amen why if you're wanting to be
[1:39:18] part of this body if you're wanting to
[1:39:19] be part of that bride cut out you better
[1:39:22] come out while there's a spirit of Grace
[1:39:25] upon you to do
[1:39:27] it and you say well I'm not
[1:39:29] denominational all that I'm not talking
[1:39:31] about all that come out of
[1:39:35] her remember it it's
[1:39:39] worldliness it's not only religion it's
[1:39:42] a worldliness it's it's a spirit that
[1:39:44] gets a hold of people that makes them
[1:39:46] lukewarm amen amen so the bride is the
[1:39:50] pattern so those who make up the bride
[1:39:53] are are the ones who have their name on
[1:39:56] the Lamb's Book of Life and they are the
[1:39:58] ones that Jesus came to redeem so when
[1:40:01] the bride fully manifests the plan and
[1:40:05] purpose of God there will be no more
[1:40:07] need for time to
[1:40:09] continue and and I understand time will
[1:40:12] continue all the way through the
[1:40:13] Millennium so that's not what I'm trying
[1:40:16] to say but let's put it this way the
[1:40:20] time of the
[1:40:21] Gentiles there will be no need for it to
[1:40:27] continue
[1:40:29] am see because God's Vision in what he
[1:40:32] had of a bride has
[1:40:35] materialized it's standing there in
[1:40:37] reality yeah before him amen so what's
[1:40:42] the
[1:40:43] point
[1:40:47] amen 120
[1:40:50] years God just shows 120 years Noah
[1:40:54] preached and of all that eight SS went
[1:40:58] the
[1:41:00] ark that's
[1:41:02] it 120 years was given a chance and
[1:41:05] there was no one else out of all the
[1:41:06] millions of people there there's no
[1:41:09] point finally God when that last one
[1:41:12] that he has predestinated for Saul forn
[1:41:16] to be the bride part of that Bride Comes
[1:41:18] In It's
[1:41:21] Over Now Church were close
[1:41:25] amen amen can you say Amen see the word
[1:41:29] has been made flesh in a many membered
[1:41:32] bride the same word that was made flesh
[1:41:35] in that body bridegroom body now has
[1:41:39] taken on flesh in a bride
[1:41:43] body so now we're at Daniel's vision of
[1:41:47] the stone being hewed out without hands
[1:41:50] striking the Gentile kingdoms
[1:41:54] that's fulfilled at this time lord
[1:41:57] Paul's prophecy in Hebrews
[1:42:00] 12:25 through 28 is fulfilled at this
[1:42:03] time see that you refuse not him that
[1:42:06] speaketh for if they spake Escape not
[1:42:09] who refused him that spake on Earth how
[1:42:12] much more shall we not Escape if we turn
[1:42:15] away from him the
[1:42:17] message that speaketh from Heaven whose
[1:42:20] voice then shook the Earth but now Heath
[1:42:22] prom saying yet once more I shake not
[1:42:25] the Earth only but also heaven and this
[1:42:28] word yet once more signify the removing
[1:42:32] of those things that are shaken as
[1:42:34] things that are made as that those
[1:42:37] things which cannot be shaken May remain
[1:42:40] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:42:43] cannot be
[1:42:45] moved that's our
[1:42:47] scripture that's where we're
[1:42:50] at can you say Amen
[1:42:53] yes sir so so there's many other
[1:42:55] scriptures that are fulfilled when the
[1:42:58] church ages are finished now notice it
[1:43:00] was after the church Ages were over that
[1:43:04] John in Revelations 4 was summons up
[1:43:07] into heaven and brother brandham now
[1:43:09] that's the
[1:43:11] Rapture and brother Bram says now John
[1:43:14] was a type of every True Believer that
[1:43:16] will be summons by Christ on high that

[1:44:40] eyes of their spiritual understanding
[1:44:42] have been enlightened we know that the
[1:44:46] world is falling

[1:45:34] political party to come and fix what the
[1:45:37] opposing political party has
[1:45:39] destroyed the world is falling apart
[1:45:43] because God is ushering in his
[1:45:47] Everlasting
[1:45:49] Kingdom
[1:45:51] amen right
[1:45:54] hello amen now aren't you glad that when
[1:45:57] God predestinated you to be his
[1:46:01] bride and he predestinated you for this
[1:46:04] age to be the final finale the final
[1:46:06] touches the final completion of all that
[1:46:10] aren't you glad that he looked beyond
[1:46:13] this world and had a place for
[1:46:18] you man if we had hope in this life only
[1:46:22] as Paul said we'd be of all men most
[1:46:24] miserable could you imagine being bride
[1:46:26] and yet having to fight every devil all
[1:46:28] the time and and and living weary all
[1:46:32] the time and I'm not talking in
[1:46:34] depression all that but you know what
[1:46:35] I'm saying it's it's there spirits that
[1:46:38] we deal with constantly could you
[1:46:40] imagine being the bride and for
[1:46:42] eternally living like that but God has
[1:46:46] prepared a
[1:46:48] place so this is why the world's got to
[1:46:51] fall apart he's already finished the
[1:46:54] bride he's got her where she he wants
[1:46:57] her he's he's able to have preeminence
[1:46:59] in a people they're they're able to do
[1:47:02] like Jesus did the first Masterpiece not
[1:47:05] my will but thy will be
[1:47:08] done my me is to do the will of the
[1:47:11] father can you say Amen not living their
[1:47:14] own life their own dreams their own
[1:47:16] Ambitions but everything is lining up to
[1:47:18] the word of God they're they're they're
[1:47:21] not living by excuse after excuse after
[1:47:23] excuse that they're living by the word
[1:47:26] of God they're lining their life up with
[1:47:29] this
[1:47:30] Worden that's right can you say Amen see
[1:47:34] so this this layout of see a bunch see
[1:47:38] they're they're full of carnal
[1:47:40] understanding understanding great
[1:47:43] understanding we we've achieved a lot in
[1:47:45] this age smart smart natural wisdom
[1:47:49] carnal wisdom understanding but they
[1:47:52] don't know what condition they're
[1:47:55] in ain't that right they don't know the
[1:47:58] sign of the time or the sign of the end
[1:48:01] time the prophet would call it see that
[1:48:04] that kind of wisdom comes from the Tree
[1:48:06] of knowledge now notice what the prophet
[1:48:09] said we're at the consummation of the
[1:48:10] church ages the LA leoan Church age the
[1:48:14] consummation of all ages we're at the
[1:48:16] consummation of of political the
[1:48:18] political world we're at the
[1:48:19] consummation of the natural world we're
[1:48:21] at the consummation of all things we're
[1:48:24] at the end of every natural thing ready
[1:48:26] to enter in amen well look at what the
[1:48:29] consummation is I looked it up it means
[1:48:31] completion it means the ultimate end or
[1:48:33] the Finish we're at the end we're at the
[1:48:36] ultimate end of church religion we're at
[1:48:39] the ultimate end of politics we are at
[1:48:43] the the the ultimate end of world
[1:48:45] government we're at the end of all of
[1:48:47] these
[1:48:49] things can you say amen amen now notice
[1:48:53] now what the prophet said God is
[1:48:54] finished with the church ages
[1:48:58] amen see the world is just keep on
[1:49:00] moving on just like everything just
[1:49:02] going on see and they're they're they're
[1:49:05] they're asking everything's continued on
[1:49:07] just like it was from the
[1:49:09] beginning but a prophet stood here by
[1:49:11] the grace of God to let us know God's
[1:49:14] through with the church
[1:49:18] ages another place the book of
[1:49:20] redemption is only revealed after the
[1:49:21] church ages and denominational ages have
[1:49:24] run out and there's time no more now we
[1:49:26] know that the book has been revealed
[1:49:28] we're not sitting here
[1:49:31] waiting we have another place we have
[1:49:33] come through a denominational age but
[1:49:35] now we but we we come now to a free age
[1:49:40] where the Holy Spirit himself comes down
[1:49:42] and vindicates himself and makes himself
[1:49:44] known makes every promise that he
[1:49:46] promise come to pass see so what was the
[1:49:49] denominational age well Wesley uh uh
[1:49:52] Luther Wesley and and Pentecost brother
[1:49:55] Bram says see those the three
[1:49:56] denominational ages carriers see which
[1:50:00] also must die and dry up just like the
[1:50:02] shuck and so forth does to give room for
[1:50:04] the seed can you say Amen they had to
[1:50:08] Die the church age had to finish off to
[1:50:11] give room for you to grow under this
[1:50:13] light don't mess with this message don't
[1:50:16] you put a Baptist Doctrine Pentecostal
[1:50:19] Doctrine or whatever else to this
[1:50:21] message
[1:50:23] we ain't got time for that God has done
[1:50:26] away with that to give you time to
[1:50:30] grow prise can you say man give room for
[1:50:32] the seed the seed cannot get right
[1:50:35] cannot get ripe until the shuck stalk
[1:50:38] and leaves are all dry dead see formal
[1:50:42] see dead dry that's right it it saps
[1:50:45] every bit of life of the life in them

[1:50:52] say Amen amen that's right where's it at
[1:50:54] all the life is in the
[1:50:59] seed glory to
[1:51:01] God so he said sees the second 2,000
[1:51:04] years is finishing there's no more

[1:51:09] rain Brethren couldn't start another
[1:51:10] organization there's there there's going
[1:51:12] to be no more that's right it's at the
[1:51:15] end can't be no more Church ages it's
[1:51:18] all over and another place we're not
[1:51:20] living in a Pentecostal age we're living
[1:51:22] in another age we're not living in a
[1:51:23] Methodist age we're living in another
[1:51:25] age we're living on up here to the
[1:51:27] bright age the calling out of the church
[1:51:31] and getting it ready or together for the
[1:51:33] Rapture another place we're entering the
[1:51:35] Rapture age not Church age Rapture age

[1:51:48] Lord so he says see the morning star has
[1:51:51] come out to hell the day coming see and
[1:51:54] the Holy Spirit showing its light see
[1:51:57] it's coming a time when the light and
[1:51:59] darkness will have to be separated one
[1:52:01] from the other church and its order will
[1:52:03] take the order of the day and Christ and
[1:52:06] his light word promise will go in the
[1:52:10] Rapture now what order are you going to
[1:52:13] take the church natural is just going to
[1:52:15] take the order of the day lukewarm blind
[1:52:18] wretched miserable poor and don't know
[1:52:23] it but Christ and his light L capital L
[1:52:27] light word promise you I bride is going
[1:52:33] to inter
[1:52:35] Rapture that's the only thing that's
[1:52:37] left for them to do it's a day today is
[1:52:40] the dawn of a new day for many who are
[1:52:43] looking for his coming and notice this
[1:52:46] leot of seean age goes into complete
[1:52:49] chaos and is it not going there today
[1:52:53] you bet it is you love
[1:52:56] him isn't the Lord
[1:52:59] wonderful now notice brother brandham
[1:53:02] was asked the question after the Rapture
[1:53:04] has been taken place will any of the
[1:53:06] church be saved in the end who was not
[1:53:08] taken in the Rapture no that's right
[1:53:11] because the blood's done left amen you
[1:53:14] see there will be no more
[1:53:16] intercessions the Gentile age is
[1:53:20] finished you say oh man and I know human
[1:53:24] human sympathy for people and human
[1:53:26] carnal understanding oh that's
[1:53:30] horrible really God's given them Seven
[1:53:33] Ages amen if you've got one day to to
[1:53:36] repent and and to ask for forgiveness
[1:53:39] and to accept what God has done that's
[1:53:41] grace to you that ought to be enough
[1:53:43] that's right but God has given us weeks
[1:53:46] after weeks years after
[1:53:48] years you understand what I'm saying
[1:53:50] there will be no EX excuse and no man
[1:53:54] can find Injustice in God for taking his
[1:53:57] people home and leaving the rest
[1:54:01] here true you understand what I'm saying
[1:54:04] brother Bram said Jesus Christ has had
[1:54:06] more success in my Ministry than his
[1:54:10] own why to let the world know that this
[1:54:13] message is
[1:54:15] Right
[1:54:17] amen so he said the Gentile ages
[1:54:19] finished there will be no one saved
[1:54:21] after the rapt none of the church so
[1:54:25] then is Revelations 2211 fulfilled he
[1:54:30] that is unjust let him be unjust still
[1:54:32] he that is filthy let him be filthy
[1:54:34] still and he that is righteous let him
[1:54:36] be righteous still and he that is Holy
[1:54:38] let him be holy still can you say Amen
[1:54:41] now as we wind it up here uh on the day
[1:54:44] of Pentecost God planted he planted a
[1:54:48] Pentecostal seed a Pentecostal Church
[1:54:55] according to the parable that Jesus gave
[1:54:57] it was a good
[1:54:59] seed it had signs wonders Miracles
[1:55:03] non-spiritual gifts it had the
[1:55:05] manifestation of the spirit of God then
[1:55:08] as we know Satan came along and he
[1:55:11] planted his seed the carnal
[1:55:14] Church according to Matthew 13th chapter
[1:55:17] we we talked about it Wednesday night
[1:55:20] that the the seed that God planted are
[1:55:22] the children of the
[1:55:24] Kingdom the seed that Satan planted are
[1:55:27] the children of the wicked one see and
[1:55:30] so the children of the kingdom are those
[1:55:31] that make up the bride of
[1:55:34] Christ the seed that God planted amen is
[1:55:38] is called the True Vine or the true
[1:55:41] church it's what the prophet called it
[1:55:43] the True Vine or true church yeah the
[1:55:46] seed that Satan planted is called the
[1:55:48] false Vine or the false
[1:55:50] Church shortly after the day of
[1:55:52] Pentecost when God planted that seed
[1:55:55] Pentecostal seed that inaugurated his
[1:55:58] church in in seed form amen Satan
[1:56:02] planted his seed the false Vine the
[1:56:06] prophet said shortly after the day of
[1:56:07] Pentecost the false Vine got
[1:56:10] intertwined uh itself around the True
[1:56:13] Vine and we find the Deeds of the
[1:56:16] nicians he says that Spirit has fought
[1:56:19] the True Vine all the way through the
[1:56:21] church ages and will do so until it is
[1:56:25] destroyed by
[1:56:27] God religious spirit will fight
[1:56:30] you L it it what it's trying to do is
[1:56:33] get you into a lukewarm state to where
[1:56:36] you compromise on the word to where you
[1:56:37] have no convictions where you have
[1:56:42] nothing someone sneeze that becomes a
[1:56:45] big trial to you it about blows you off
[1:56:47] your feet
[1:56:52] see and and so in the Book of
[1:56:55] Revelations as we know that God
[1:56:57] addressed each Church false Vine True
[1:57:01] Vine and he talks about each one Prophet
[1:57:04] said he calls them the church see and
[1:57:08] only the elect will really know which is
[1:57:11] the true Spirit only the elect will not
[1:57:14] be
[1:57:15] deceived now notice for the true church
[1:57:19] brother brandham said Pentecost was was
[1:57:22] our
[1:57:23] pattern another place he says from the
[1:57:25] beginning until this time the real true
[1:57:29] church has been a Pentecostal Church it
[1:57:32] is true God has
[1:57:35] reserved this church aren't you glad
[1:57:39] God's reserved
[1:57:41] you now the spirit of God will always
[1:57:44] remain the same you cannot tell me that
[1:57:46] the spirit of God That Came Upon them on
[1:57:48] the days of of on the day of Pentecost
[1:57:50] and you got a different spirit
[1:57:52] can't tell me that you got the different
[1:57:54] Spirit than what Paul had or even what
[1:57:55] brother brandham had it's the same
[1:57:58] Spirit he Remains the Same do you
[1:58:01] believe that brother brandom or the Book
[1:58:03] of Revelations talks about the seven
[1:58:05] spirits of God as we know now that
[1:58:07] doesn't mean that God has seven spirits
[1:58:10] and and and he's divided in seven you
[1:58:13] know personalities and and seven gods
[1:58:16] and and and all these things that that
[1:58:18] doesn't mean so so and it doesn't mean
[1:58:21] that God changes his ways seven
[1:58:23] different times doesn't mean that at all
[1:58:26] brother BR said see the spirits was the
[1:58:28] angels that went to the Stars which were
[1:58:31] Messengers seven spirits seven different
[1:58:33] times the Holy Spirit would anoint a
[1:58:35] anoint a messenger which was a star in
[1:58:38] his day another place seven spirits of
[1:58:40] God are the seven fruits of the spirit
[1:58:43] that would reflect back in his people
[1:58:46] ain't that right so seven Messengers
[1:58:49] reflecting the spirit of God in in Seven
[1:58:52] Ages One messenger to each age seven
[1:58:55] Messengers seven Church ages seven
[1:58:58] spirits of God in other words it wasn't
[1:59:00] just one spirit in of God in the other
[1:59:03] age or in the first age and everybody
[1:59:05] else was devoid of it but God was
[1:59:07] letting them know letting us know his
[1:59:09] spirit's been through every age that's
[1:59:12] exactly right God will always be the
[1:59:14] same and act the same amen now notice
[1:59:18] brother Bram says see the seven
[1:59:19] Messengers will have the same spirit
[1:59:22] teach the same word have the same power
[1:59:24] and if the church is the true church
[1:59:27] it'll have it it will have the very same
[1:59:29] spirit and word and acts of power that
[1:59:32] they had at Pentecost by experience it
[1:59:35] will be a Pentecostal Church there will
[1:59:38] be tongues and interpretation and
[1:59:41] prophecy and healings God will be in the
[1:59:43] midst of her and God will declare
[1:59:45] himself in the midst of her as he always
[1:59:48] has another place the real genu genuine
[1:59:51] AR article of God was Pentecost was is
[1:59:54] and will always be that's where the
[1:59:56] church began right here with Pentecostal
[1:59:59] power another place take the take the
[2:00:02] histories and look down through the
[2:00:03] stream of time to hear and find out if
[2:00:06] every one of those real true children of
[2:00:08] God didn't hold on to that Pentecostal
[2:00:10] blessing spoke in tongues interpret
[2:00:12] tongues had signs and wonders baptized
[2:00:14] in the name of Jesus Christ everything
[2:00:16] that the apostles did they did too right
[2:00:19] on right down through there see so then
[2:00:22] we find that the Apostle Paul being the
[2:00:24] first church age messenger and all the
[2:00:26] others uh uh uh Martin uh irus Columbus
[2:00:32] Luther Wesley uh uh you know all all the
[2:00:34] way Amen brother BR said they had signs
[2:00:37] and wonders why because the same God
[2:00:40] reflecting the spirit through them for
[2:00:42] that age amen now uh brother Bram said
[2:00:47] see the nickan church turned it down
[2:00:50] that false fine
[2:00:52] that carnal Vine that carnal Church see
[2:00:55] amen turned it down because of these
[2:00:58] things they were spiritual see and he
[2:01:00] says as I've drawn here he says the
[2:01:02] church was being squeezed out and the
[2:01:05] nickan doctrine was in the majority and
[2:01:07] the true church was in the minority and
[2:01:10] has always been the true church has
[2:01:13] always been in the
[2:01:16] minority you believe it and you
[2:01:19] remember the Capstone that brother the
[2:01:22] brand pyramid started out like this and
[2:01:25] it didn't go like
[2:01:26] this it goes like this so it's coming
[2:01:29] more in minority more in minority in
[2:01:32] other words more bride less bride
[2:01:34] members coming into the body as each Age
[2:01:36] come
[2:01:38] amen
[2:01:39] hello amen that's right see so now even
[2:01:44] Jesus followed the pattern of
[2:01:48] Pentecost for here acts 10:38 God
[2:01:51] anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
[2:01:53] Ghost and with power with
[2:01:55] power who went about doing good healing
[2:01:58] all that there were oppressed of the
[2:01:59] devil for God was with him amen so the
[2:02:03] prophet said Jesus followed that pattern
[2:02:07] and as he went away he told his
[2:02:08] disciples to tar in the city of
[2:02:10] Jerusalem until they be in be ued with
[2:02:14] power from on high think of it in this
[2:02:18] age they'll have a form of godliness and
[2:02:20] deny the power
[2:02:24] yes see so they were wait to wait until
[2:02:28] Pentecost Don't Preach don't sing don't
[2:02:32] go out and witness don't do nothing
[2:02:35] until you get indued with
[2:02:39] power amen ain't that right and and what
[2:02:43] is Pentecost the spirit that was in him
[2:02:47] now come upon the
[2:02:49] believer The Same Spirit the same power
[2:02:53] the same works the same everything now
[2:02:56] come into that
[2:03:00] church true church church and when it
[2:03:03] returned to them what did it do it
[2:03:06] quickened Quicken their mortal body what
[2:03:09] did he Quicken them
[2:03:12] to the word that's why that that's why
[2:03:16] see people thought that the day of ausa
[2:03:18] Street the holy ghost that fell on in
[2:03:21] amen they thought that that was the days
[2:03:22] of Acts again that was the day of
[2:03:25] Pentecost again brother Bram said no
[2:03:27] that's not that's not true what looked
[2:03:29] to be like the return of Pentecost it
[2:03:33] really wasn't because they left the word
[2:03:35] and
[2:03:36] denominated true can you say amen that's
[2:03:40] right see so then it quickened their
[2:03:43] mortal body now see it was the only way
[2:03:47] for that called out body the true church
[2:03:50] to stand in his place in his stead on
[2:03:54] the earth taking his place that's what
[2:03:57] brother Bram said the church could not
[2:03:59] take his place except that spirit that
[2:04:02] was in him would return upon them and
[2:04:06] Quicken their mortal
[2:04:08] body you understand what I'm saying see
[2:04:11] so brother Bram said because that same
[2:04:13] spirit that was in him would be in them
[2:04:16] and they would do the very same Works he
[2:04:19] says and any people that is truly the
[2:04:21] body body of Jesus Christ the true
[2:04:23] church WIll manifest the same works as
[2:04:25] Jesus did and the Pentecostal church
[2:04:28] because the same spirit will be in them
[2:04:30] any other church that does not have the
[2:04:32] spirit and manifestation is going to
[2:04:35] have to account to
[2:04:39] Goden I hope it's just ain't words that
[2:04:42] you're hearing I hope it I hope it's
[2:04:43] helping you CU you got to understand any
[2:04:47] any church any church see that does not
[2:04:50] have the spirit and the manifestations
[2:04:53] is going to have to give an account to
[2:04:55] God yes sir this layot ofan age that
[2:04:58] claims they have need of nothing it's
[2:05:00] going to give an account to God they're
[2:05:02] religious yet they're lukewarm they
[2:05:04] without a spirit and
[2:05:06] manifestation they're as weak as we can
[2:05:10] get that's why we have to overcome the
[2:05:14] age can you say
[2:05:16] Amen now one would think that it would
[2:05:18] be easy to keep that spirit that
[2:05:20] Pentecostal experience alive
[2:05:22] and that everybody would want it but
[2:05:24] that's not true see the false Vine is a
[2:05:26] product of the tree of knowledge and
[2:05:28] that tree produces death just like Cain
[2:05:31] killed his brother Abel he was a product
[2:05:33] of the tree of knowledge and brother
[2:05:35] Braham said see the wicked killed the
[2:05:37] righteous it it set a pattern it will
[2:05:40] keep that pattern until the restoration
[2:05:42] of all things as spoken by the prophets
[2:05:45] can you say Amen do you love him amen
[2:05:49] amen see so the Catholics claimed to be
[2:05:51] the original church and they were the
[2:05:54] Catholic Church began at Pentecost but
[2:05:56] it wasn't too long after Pentecost they
[2:05:58] began to drift away see and the Catholic
[2:06:01] church now is made up of those who
[2:06:04] drifted away amen from Pentecost at the
[2:06:08] beginning Paul even spoke about it he he
[2:06:10] he said men coming in and speaking
[2:06:13] perverse things and would turn the
[2:06:15] people away from God see because they
[2:06:18] weren't speaking the word of God
[2:06:21] ain't that right amen see and so we we
[2:06:26] find that we could go on but but you all
[2:06:29] know amen about about what what has
[2:06:33] happened uh uh through the church ages
[2:06:35] but brother brandom says what what was
[2:06:37] the spiritual climax of that church in
[2:06:39] the first church age it had left its
[2:06:41] first love of the word of God it had
[2:06:44] fallen from its origin fallen from its
[2:06:47] origin a man which was Pentecost and he
[2:06:51] said says this means uh that means this
[2:06:54] church was in danger of being taken away
[2:06:56] from the leading of the Holy Spirit and
[2:06:58] the control of the spirit can you say
[2:07:00] Amen so we we we see that and and this
[2:07:03] is exactly how that the first church a
[2:07:06] started just skipping through things but
[2:07:08] brother Bram says and it will get worse
[2:07:11] and worse everybody say it'll get worse
[2:07:14] and worse until the holy spirit is
[2:07:18] completely rejected and God Must Destroy
[2:07:23] the
[2:07:24] people now Church we're
[2:07:31] here nanism started as a deed then it
[2:07:35] become a Doctrine then it become a a
[2:07:39] standard brother Braham said it became
[2:07:41] the unbending way it finally took over
[2:07:43] and God's God was pushed aside oh it
[2:07:46] started so small so quietly so
[2:07:48] inoffensive and it does it to everyone
[2:07:50] now you remember now it started that way
[2:07:52] in the church age and it'll started in
[2:07:55] you if you're not
[2:07:59] careful it'll start with maybe an
[2:08:02] argument maybe a
[2:08:04] disagreement it'll start with just some
[2:08:07] little little thing maybe something
[2:08:08] happened in your life or something going
[2:08:12] on it starts so easily
[2:08:16] yeah and if you don't take care of it
[2:08:19] and you don't recognize it
[2:08:22] before you know it it starts winding its
[2:08:24] way around and winding and intertwining
[2:08:27] and
[2:08:28] intertwining and the excuses become
[2:08:30] greater than the word of God and and
[2:08:33] you're trying to get away and it's hard
[2:08:35] to get away you understand what I'm
[2:08:37] saying well see that that's the way it
[2:08:40] is see you let someone do you wrong you
[2:08:43] let someone say something against you
[2:08:44] and we all been there I'm sure oh
[2:08:48] yeah maybe they didn't even mean to do
[2:08:50] something wrong but you took it wrong
[2:08:53] yes sir and you Fester on that you dwell
[2:08:57] on it or maybe they did say something to
[2:08:59] you how easy it is to get
[2:09:02] offended how easy it is to Harbor it how
[2:09:06] it easy it is to hold it
[2:09:08] in but what you don't know comes as a
[2:09:12] little bitty
[2:09:13] thing and then it starts growing and
[2:09:16] growing and growing you understand what
[2:09:19] I'm saying well that's what happened
[2:09:20] with the church
[2:09:21] and I'm talking about all of us that
[2:09:23] have had these things we we could do
[2:09:25] just anything you know maybe it's just a
[2:09:28] little thought of maybe that the brother
[2:09:30] Brandon missed it in one little place
[2:09:32] and if you don't take care of that
[2:09:34] thought it'll
[2:09:38] linger and I just keep on and on and
[2:09:41] before you know it it start showing
[2:09:42] little excuses and start showing little
[2:09:44] things and get you start yeah and before
[2:09:47] you know it you'll start questioning the
[2:09:49] prophet over everything
[2:09:51] because you didn't stop it anytime that
[2:09:55] that I don't understand something about
[2:09:57] the prophet and the devil starts talking
[2:09:59] to me about it that maybe brother
[2:10:00] Brandon missed it you know what I just
[2:10:02] start doing I just verbally thank God
[2:10:04] you sent a prophet father I thank you
[2:10:06] for sending a prophet I believe he's
[2:10:08] right Lord I Thank you I base my whole
[2:10:11] life upon
[2:10:13] him I will not let the devil put
[2:10:16] something in my
[2:10:17] mind ain't going to do
[2:10:20] it well see see that so that's what
[2:10:22] happened it came as a little bitty thing
[2:10:24] but then it it it come it became an
[2:10:26] unbending way it finally took over and
[2:10:28] God was supposed to decide see oh it
[2:10:30] started so small so quietly so
[2:10:33] inoffensively it looks so good it seems
[2:10:35] so sound see then it caught a hold and
[2:10:38] like a python it squeezed out the very
[2:10:41] breath and killed all the spirituality
[2:10:43] there was in the church and oh that
[2:10:45] false Vine is subtle it is like an angel
[2:10:48] of Light until it gets a hold of you say
[2:10:51] so to see the beginning of the church
[2:10:53] age in another place he says and to see
[2:10:55] how the apostles and the doctrines and
[2:10:57] the things that they taught the
[2:10:58] principles of the Bible then to see that
[2:11:00] church about the second round of
[2:11:01] Apostles how it began to fade away the
[2:11:03] real true teaching the third round
[2:11:05] getting away see Way Away by the fourth
[2:11:08] round it had faded uh out and and the
[2:11:11] church brought forth a lukewarm church
[2:11:13] and now look where we're
[2:11:15] at ain't that right so here God out of
[2:11:19] all that church age now God is confr run
[2:11:21] in that age that carnal chur says I
[2:11:24] would that you were hot or cold but
[2:11:27] because you're lukewarm I'll spew you
[2:11:29] out of my mouth can you say man and
[2:11:33] remember what are they lukewarm
[2:11:35] about Rah says they have gotten away
[2:11:37] from the word they are no longer F
[2:11:39] fervent about it they are lukewarm about
[2:11:41] it ain't that right now brother
[2:11:46] brandham he says from the beginning I
[2:11:48] think we've read it but he says from the
[2:11:50] beginning till this time the true real
[2:11:53] true church has been a Pentecostal
[2:11:55] Church it is true God has rever reserved
[2:11:59] this
[2:12:00] church now talking to us as we get ready
[2:12:03] to wind it down now but Jesus talks
[2:12:06] about 10
[2:12:07] virgins the five wise and the five
[2:12:10] foolish ain't that right and notice
[2:12:13] Matthew 25 and3 don't think I gave you
[2:12:15] the scripture but he says they that were
[2:12:18] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[2:12:21] with them but the wise took oil in their
[2:12:25] lamps in their vessels with their lamps
[2:12:29] and while the bridegroom carried they
[2:12:30] all slumbered and slept and at midnight
[2:12:33] there was a cry made behold the
[2:12:35] bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him
[2:12:38] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[2:12:40] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[2:12:43] the wise give us of your oil for our
[2:12:44] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[2:12:47] saying not so lest there be not enough
[2:12:51] for us and you but go ye rather to them
[2:12:54] that sell and buy for yourselves and
[2:12:56] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[2:12:59] came and they that were ready went in
[2:13:02] with him to the marriage and the door
[2:13:04] was shut and afterward came also the ver
[2:13:08] other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us
[2:13:11] and he answered and said verily I say
[2:13:13] unto you I know you not now we know that
[2:13:16] the oil is the Holy Ghost amen and
[2:13:18] brother brandom likened it to a coal
[2:13:20] lamp you put put the oil in in at the
[2:13:23] bottom of the lamp and then there is a
[2:13:25] wick that that dips into the coal the
[2:13:29] oil and and then the other end is where
[2:13:32] you and uh light light the uh light the
[2:13:37] fire and and you know he he was talking
[2:13:40] about that Wick he said it has to be
[2:13:41] made up of a special material because
[2:13:44] that Wick is to draw the oil right draw
[2:13:46] it up to the fire to keep feeding that
[2:13:49] fire you understand what I'm saying and
[2:13:51] then and you and and you got to keep
[2:13:53] that oil you got to keep the oil in it
[2:13:55] get the supply of oil that's right so
[2:13:58] the fire will stay lit ain't that right
[2:14:01] that's right see and and and so now
[2:14:03] brother brandham brother Bram says now
[2:14:05] that fire amen the fire that every
[2:14:07] believer must have is Pentecostal fire
[2:14:10] Pentecostal fire and he said see the
[2:14:13] fire is the Gospel Light on that oil God
[2:14:16] said so see that's the vessel the oil is
[2:14:18] in the vessel and the fire burn burning
[2:14:21] it see shows that it's reflecting the
[2:14:23] light of what the word said that's the
[2:14:26] reflection that wise virgin could do
[2:14:28] that but that other foolish virgin was
[2:14:30] on the side outside had no oil they
[2:14:33] couldn't reflect nothing but their
[2:14:35] church and their
[2:14:38] denomination can you say amen amen and
[2:14:41] he tells us in one place he says the
[2:14:43] wick is
[2:14:45] Faith another place he said the wick is
[2:14:48] the real genuine believer amen in other
[2:14:51] words we are the one that's keeping that
[2:14:54] fire
[2:14:55] lit we're the one not drawing from the
[2:14:59] world not drawing from the entertainment
[2:15:02] and and trying to find joy out there to
[2:15:04] sustain our
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:07] joy our
[2:15:09] joy is coming from the
[2:15:14] oil and it's a Pentecostal fire that's
[2:15:17] being lit in us can you say Amen
[2:15:21] you love him amen Oh my he said see the
[2:15:26] people of this age doesn't need
[2:15:29] Faith they have intellect they have
[2:15:32] scientific knowledge and wisdom see so
[2:15:34] they don't need that Faith therefore
[2:15:37] they have nothing to draw even if they
[2:15:40] did sit in a holy ghost meeting yeah
[2:15:42] there's nothing to draw from it but God
[2:15:45] help us today to know who we
[2:15:49] are you cannot be bride and mingle out
[2:15:52] there and when I say mingle out there

[2:15:57] bringing on their bearing their
[2:16:00] characteristics bearing their
[2:16:02] nature bear having their
[2:16:05] standards and expecting God to deal with
[2:16:08] that and accept that it ain't happening
[2:16:10] it

[2:16:16] come praise God thank you Lord the ones
[2:16:19] that had oil in their lamp Trimm their
[2:16:22] lamp the fire was a burning and they
[2:16:25] went out to meet the
[2:16:28] bridegroom Jesus here in Matthew 7:13
[2:16:31] said enter ye in at the Straight Gate

[2:16:36] way that leadth to
[2:16:38] destruction and many there be which go
[2:16:40] in there at because straight is the gate
