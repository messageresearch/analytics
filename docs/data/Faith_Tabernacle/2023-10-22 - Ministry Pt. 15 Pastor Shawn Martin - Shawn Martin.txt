adoration for him as the world hasn't taken its place and the pleasures and all of these things and um we certainly love the Lord amen and the musicians can be dismissed it's good to be here today uh with you and um as it was said good to have Brother Sam back amen with us amen and um brother Matthew amen having to work a little bit but uh good to have him back as well and just everyone amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Acts the sixth chapter and we want to just be remembering um brother Donnie and sister Carol the Parker family and the church today I'm sure is going to be a rough one for them and um so we want to keep them in prayer amen good to have brother Tim back amen sister Martha I don't see her but anyways good to have them back as well uh the book of Acts the sixth chapter we're going to start at the the first verse but it says and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a m murmuring of the grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration then the 12 called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it it is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve table wherefore Brethren look you out among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word amen let's just bow our hearts and talk to our Lord father as we come to this place that has been set aside and dedicated for you your presence to meet with us father we are assured that your presence is here and Lord you come to do a work within us Lord and we certainly as your people we want you to have your way way father we're so honored that you would come so many people meeting in different places and don't know you don't don't even know what your presence is like but you had just grace us with your presence here and we're so thankful father we want you to have your way now you be Lord over our lives you be the Creator you be whatever you want to be and whatever you are Lord may you display it here before us today that when we leave here we would know that we had been in the presence of the supernatural pray that you'd forgive us of our sins and our failures Lord and may your blood cover us today I pray just a special prayer for the Reagan family the Parker family the church Lord as they go through this time bearing their loved one father I know it's got to be hard but I pray that you would strengthen them now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord you can have your seats today and um I want to continue on this subject of ministry and um of course as we said Ministry is the agency in which the purpose in this case the purpose of God is fulfilled and we read there where they said we will give ourselves to the ministry the ministry and of course this is the ministry of the disciples we've been talking of the ministry of the prophets and um namely um the prophet of Malachi 4 but this is the ministry of the disciples and it's not just the original disciples the 11 uh because um uh we read that it the number of disciples multiplied so it wasn't just those that had walked with uh Jesus when he was on Earth but this is showing that the ministry of Christ uh continuing even after he has ascended up into heaven I am glad that God is determined to fulfill his purpose and and not his whole purpose wasn't entirely fulfilled uh when Christ was upon the Earth and so therefore there has to be a Ministry to complete the purpose and I'm glad that there is a people living today on earth that is wanting him to fulfill his purpose and we are praying as Jesus taught us to pray thy will be done thy kingdom come and uh and so uh but if his will is to be done uh then it's got to be done in us and through us uh his will and and I believe that there is a people that the will of God is being accomplished in Earth and vessels and through and by uh these Earth and vessels and so the will of God is being not only done in me but it is uh uh being worked through me as uh as as Ministry Ministry and so uh uh we are we are as the ministry is being affected uh uh we are being affected by the ministry then we are realizing that we are Sons and Daughters of God and we're being placed we are positionally placed in the word of God for this age and and we are heirs and Joint heirs with Jesus Christ and and it's because Ministry that we not only recognize who we are but we're actually able to uh uh enter and and and uh practice or uh participate become active as heirs as Sons and Daughters of God not not just hearing about it but the ministry has actually uh uh put us in action that now we live as Sons and Daughters of God now we live as heirs and Joint HS with Jesus Christ we act upon it we and and this is because the ministry has affected us amen and and that's the way it ought to be amen but then the ministry is being done through me because I'm part of his ministry and that's that's with every one of us uh uh here a a servant what it is it's it's the ministry it's the servant of God uh uh called into action uh about the father's business so we we are not just uh uh recipients beneficiaries uh by the ministry of God but now we are put into action uh uh by uh doing uh the father's business and so again God has a Ministry and it's an agency by which his will is accomplished as I have said that this ministry has uh different offices or different branches if we could say it that way and uh we've talked about the ministry of angels uh for example and and we know that angels are servants and God sends them to help us to protect us to to help us to believe and and they are sent to give us messages from God and and uh even there in Acts 22 it tells how that Cornelius uh Gentile he was a centurion and the Bible says a man that was just and feared God was warned of God by an Holy Angel to send for Peter and to hear his words so so God has Angels uh by us and brother Brown said they never leave us uh uh angels are with us on a daily basis they go home with us and and we're talking about a Believer now and so but then there is the ministry of the Holy Spirit and and the Holy Spirit has always been God's agent from since the beginning uh uh of of creation and and he's still an agent of God today amen and we've seen how he has worked and uh you know the Bible there in even in in the Book of Genesis that the Earth was dark without form and Waters covered the Earth and and and you you know the scripture but the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep and and brought a transformation so so God would bring this transformation through the agency of his spirit amen but then we see that man is God's agent as well well and and again uh uh prophets uh they they are agents of God um and and they have a Ministry and we we've read it several times now the ministry of the prophets and and there in Hosea and uh you know uh Moses was God's agent Elijah was God's agent um uh Noah uh was God's agent the prophet even said Jesus was God's agent and so the the prophets were called Gods because the word of the Lord uh came to them and and the word they they spoke as thus sayith the Lord see it came to pass and is still coming to pass all this turmoil that we are seeing the things that are happening uh uh well it's it's all prophecy that prophets years and years thousands of years uh ago prophesied would come uh but it's it's coming to pass because it wasn't their word it was the word of the Lord and it's an eternal word ain't that right well then in in Matthew 16 as we know God promised uh to build his church uh Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it well then years later in Ephesians 1:23 uh it it tells us Paul tells us that the church that God promised to build is his body the church is the body of Jesus Christ the fullness of him that filth all in all ain't that right so so again the church is the body of Jesus Christ and and it's as Paul would teach us it's a many membered body uh uh uh men and women uh boys and girls uh uh they're part of of this body of of Jesus Christ and and so now the prophet now we thank God for the prophet and and uh I can never overemphasize the the the the appreciation the importance of God sending us a prophet but he was not the member of the body he was just a member of the body he was not the body he was part of the body ain't that right and and so uh just as the prophet said Moses wasn't the children of Israel he was just one of them ain't that right and so but but we know that that that the prophet had a uh important uh uh message to bring and and uh um and and and so uh brother brandham he he was sent as we believe with a Divine message to lead us into the land of promise just as Moses was sent with a message to lead the people into the land of promise so has this message and the prophet's message is still leading the church do you believe that it's still leading the church and and because it it was not brother branham's message it was God himself it was it was The Headstone it it was our headship amen so you'll you'll never you'll you'll you you'll never surpass the message that God has sent to us we will we will never ever ever need a new message amen uh to take us further in God this message is an eternal message and it is taking us home it and it's and it's calling us this message is calling us to come up higher amen and and so it it it it it's so important for the body of Believers amen this message is but the ministry of Christ isn't just to lay dormant just because the prophet has left the scene but it the ministry of God is still in operation and and and uh uh and and this ministry is in is is working by the members of the body of Christ it's it's in operation in the members of the body uh uh Ephesians 4 and8 uh Paul would tell us wherefore he saith when he ascended upon on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts everybody say gave gifts unto men he gave gifts unto men so so looking at these gifts uh within the body of within the body of Christ uh is the fold Ministry uh there's the prophets the evangelists teachers Apostles pastors and evangelists ain't that right I believe that there's prophets uh that are still upon the Earth today I I believe that brother brandom told us that there's Major Prophets and then there's Minor Prophets and uh uh but but even as Paul Paul was a prophet he was the church age messenger he was an important uh Prophet if you know what I mean he's the one that would set the church in order and and and get it get it going in the right Direction and things like that and and and and no one no one could preach against or or different than what Paul preached and here we are thousands of years later uh uh hundreds or whatever and and down to the seventh Church age and the prophet would tell say I preached what Paul preached he said I never wavered from what he preached because Paul laid that foundation so he was important but then there was the prophet Abus uh that was that was uh that the Bible me itions uh uh that was in Paul's day and and and and and and so so there there are I believe prophets within the fful ministry uh uh but they they don't have that importance of of what brother brandham had to us they are not um uh someone that we you know I I don't believe that we're just following one individual anymore I I in other words I don't believe that God raised raes up another prophet and so we ignore what brother brandham was and we follow this guy I I don't believe that amen but but there there is a fold Ministry and and Prophets are included in that and so but then uh uh we find that God himself placed that these gifts in into the church in his church and and and and we'll see that there in Ephesians 4:12 that Paul gives the description of the purpose of this fful ministry and it's for the perfecting of the Saints it's for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro ain't that right and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness and whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ ain't that right so so we we uh uh this is the purpose of of the five-fold ministry that uh and why the five-fold ministry is important uh uh uh today uh but but then we find that in the body of of Christ is the ministry of the Saints according to first uh Corinthians 16 and5 I believe and and uh uh Paul mentions the ministry of the Saints so it's not just a fifo Ministry but it's a Ministry that operates uh through the B amen uh uh now brother Bram talked and we'll get into it more but how that God ordained uh the fivefold ministry these a pastor just God just just doesn't come and say well I'm going to be a pastor today you know they are ordained gifts and and predestinated gifts and and so but then there's the ministry of the Saints so if you are in the body of Christ uh then you are part of the ministry in some way or another it's it's not that anyone in in the body of Christ uh any member doesn't just sit on the sidelines and watch everybody do the work I if you are part of the body you are part of ministry in some way or another brother Bram said see God has put us each one in the body to do certain things amen so then that puts a responsibility to us all that that no man liveth to himself no man dieth to himself but but every one of us will be held responsible to God for what he's called us to do and and so uh um you know uh uh we we find here in First Corinthians 12 and 27 it says now you are the body of Christ and and I'm I'm so glad that that that that uh uh God has given us an identity that it's not Faith Tabernacle you know and it's not such and such and it's not this one or whatever but we are the body of Christ amen anyone can come to Faith Tabernacle but not everybody can come into the body of Christ and so you are the body of Christ and members everybody say members in particular see God ha set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues see well also in the body now God has placed nine spiritual gifts and and uh brother Brown said there's nine spiritual gifts promised to the body that is the body of Believers another place they work through the body in another place he says it circles through the body it it circles notice it's not a Praying individual uh uh it it it it'll be uh on this one here tonight let's let let's say it it comes on you know uh uh uh you know s Sister Kim weeks it it comes on her this morning and and she could give a prophecy and and and and or or whatever and and then he says then it'll be on another one here here you know it'll be on this one here and it'll be on another one the next night so it could it could go from Sister Kim weeks to Sister Kim Brumfield or sister Hannah or it it it so so it it it circles through the body nine spiritual gifts it in such so he said see the person can pray the prayer of faith tonight or this person can pray the prayer of faith tonight and maybe it's on this one over here the next night over on that see it's a gift that's in the body working around to all of you Milling through the body nine spiritual gifts so this one might prophesy tonight now that's where we get in trouble he said see one might prophesy and tell the truth that doesn't make you a prophet see it might never come to you again now in in the Pentecostals you know it was always certain individuals prophesying always certain individuals speaking in tongues always certain individual but but and so so it it was like well if if they ain't going to be here well we ain't going to have no prophecy tonight you know if if they ain't going to be here cuz it seemed like they are the gifted one but but then the prophet teaches us that's not true brother be God could move up on you Amen to prophesy and and it would be accurate and never use you in that way again see and then someone else see and and so what that does it it puts us in anticipation and and God if you want to use me tonight use me you know uh uh uh I'm I'm at your bidding ain't that right not to say well I ain't got the gift they're the one that's the spiritual one I'm just sitting here no no no no no if you're part of the body then the gifts will circulate through the body that's why then then no one has a drawing no one says well see I'm the spiritual one y'all need to come follow me no no no it's not that it's a body can you sayen it operates see so being being now in the body is so important Amen to be in the body do you realize the prophet said no man has a right to worship has no right to worship outside of being in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ now you think of that worship is only accepted before God when a person is in the body amen another place he said there is no Fellowship outside of the body of Jesus Christ you can't have fellowship with God Amen no wonder the world is has no idea idea that God is present today and has no relationship because you have to be in the body of Christ to have True Fellowship amen so in the body of Christ is where the bride uh brother brandham said where the bride Church word will unite we've been talking you know brother Bram talks about the uniting of of the word and and the word seeing the word the word uniting with the word and all that well it does not happen unless you're in the body of Christ because it is a word body ain't that right it's a word body now so brother brand says see get Christ in your heart Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing Holy Spirit Christ means the anointed one see and the Holy Spirit is that anointing and you are the one that's anointed see in the body now see and it's Christ in you anointing you so don't put limits on God if Christ is in you don't put limits on God and say well I I really can't do that and I don't know I I I just ain't I'm nothing oh yes you are if you're part of the body if Christ is in you then he's got something for you to do it's a Ministry ain't that right yes sir I mean if you're anything if your body goes dead you're going to know it you know if your nerve goes dead you know it if your feelings go dead you know it if if your liver goes dead well you know it right if your heart goes dead you go dead you know uh uh uh whatever goes dead and and if the member of your body says well I ain't going to function today you know then then the rest of the body says what in the world just happened to my hand you know I can't get it to move I I'm wanting to play the guitar but I can't do it I want to play drums I can't do it you know the stupid thing won't work you know well you going to go to the doctor doctor what just happened you know uh uh my hand don't work it's just you know and and and these things well could you imagine the body of Christ doing the same thing well I'm body but you ain't going to work you know uh uh well I'm part of it I know I am but I ain't doing that ain't no way well then you either are part of the body or not and God's body is not a sick body can you say man not in this day anyways so he said see he said see it's it's it's Christ in you anointing you then you got the right thing then he can use you to anything see he wants to use you in because you're in the body and subject to any of those gifts ain't that right but see to have one of the gifts and I want you to notice this as we go but to have one of the gifts outside the body it wouldn't do you any good ain't that right though I speak with tongues of men and and and angels and and have not charity it profit me nothing though I have faith and can understand all the mysteries of God profiteth me nothing though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice give all my goods to the poor though I have faith to move a mountain I am nothing see don't depend on those things the spirit the holy spirit is a being it's God God in you you the person God that's lit your whole entire being you're changed you're a new creature and and little thing that that that's uh wrong he'll tell you that's wrong then quit don't do it see then you say father I didn't mean to do that see forgive me and you you understand what I'm saying see uh then it shows that there's something working in you well I don't have to do that bless God I I don't care you know well then it shows that God can't deal with you it it shows you know you keep holding him grudges well it shows God can't deal with you you know because if you're in the body then there's there there's something there that's going to tell you you're wrong you shouldn't do that you you shouldn't be living half backslid you you you you shouldn't be doing these things you should be on fire for me you should you should be giv more your your all to to to to the to the the the message the word to the Lord instead of to the world you're putting all that and see well then if if Christ is in you he begins to convict you right amen and not to not to condemn anyone that's anyone that brings if if if if the gospel brings condemnation to a person to where they get bitter they get hard and say well I ain't doing it I don't you know well then it shows that there's something not right because if Christ is in you amen well the Bible says the spirit of a prophet is subject to a prophet amen and so the The Same Spirit that is upon a prophet is upon a an individual then all of a sudden there's a connection there and and and and the spirit that's upon that fivefold Ministry amen and they begin to start just uh uh uh uh dealing with things in a man's life a woman's life a boy girl's life amen and that spirit of God is upon them amen instead of bringing a rebellion then then then it brings a submission it it brings a a contriteness because the same spirit that is talking behind the in in in in in the ministry of the fivefold ministry or the prophet or whatever is the same spirit that is upon the individual uh uh hope you understand what I'm saying now amen see so so but but then then you see what what is it then God God does these things to bring because he wants to work his gifts in the church he wants to work himself in the church ain't that right so now brother brandham said see you receive the Holy Spirit and think well that's just as that's as much as I can go well see you're just ready to go to work for God then when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother BR said Pentecost thought well that's it that's that's as far as I got to go brother said that's not true when when you get the Holy Ghost you're just starting cuz now now you're baptized into the body and now you're ready to go to work for God then ain't that right see he said when you're when you receive the Holy Spirit by Believing on Jesus Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit then you're just a candidate to go to work for God then notice then go to yielding your members to him yield your members to him see what he will have you to do he might have you to preach sing testify pass out tracks talk to people bring someone to church all kinds of gifts and helps that's in the Body of Christ some are called for one thing some for another ain't that right but it has to be in the body or it does you no good ain't that right see and in the body he says in another place we are subject to the nine spiritual gifts in the body ain't that right see so now we know that that a person can have a Ministry outside of being in the body of Christ uh but he is working independently on his own because he's not joined with the members of the body he's not under the headship that all the members are in the body he's outside the body ain't that right yes sir see and so so he's working independently he he might be under the body of a Baptist or a body of a Pentecostal or a body of whatever see and and and and and and this might be just a little uh different uh of to say but but I've got members in my body brother Tim you've got members under in in your body you you know I don't control your members because they're not part of they're not part of the body of my body and and you don't control my members because I that they're not part of your body and and so God gave a head for this body God gave a head for your body and and there's an intelligence there that your members come under and there's an intelligence that my members come under you understand what I'm saying and and so it works just that way so so a Ministry outside the body of Christ is under another intelligence it could be a Baptist it could be a Pentecostal it could be it could be whatever his own inspiration but when it's in the body there's only one intelligence and that's God ain't that right see so then then he's working independently on his own outside the body so to have one of the gifts outside the body it it it it will not do you a bit of good see so so the ministry of God can you say that with me the ministry of God is for the body of Christ the ministry of God is for the body of Christ see and and so the body why because the body Christ's body is God's agent here on Earth and that body is made up of human beings ain't that right see so now notice uh brother brandom would tell us in this last day there is again another people and I believe you and I are the people that he was talking about in the land who under their messenger see will be the final voice to the final age ain't that right well see if you're in the body you become the final voice us to the final age ain't that right see and so he said yes sir the church is no longer uh the mouthpiece of God denominations and and a lot of Independence either you see it's its own mouthpiece it has a Ministry but it's its own Ministry it it's saying things but it's it's it's it's under the inspiration of its own see and and he says see the the uh it's it's its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her the voice of God can you say Amen it and you don't have to preach to be the voice of God you don't have to prophesy to be the voice of God Amen brother Brandon brought it down to every one of us he says how we need thousands of lived voices lived voices thundering out the voice of God can you say Amen so so you you you living according to this message and walking not according to some legalist not according to some calvinist not according to some Theology and theologian or or uh whatever see but but you're living according to the message of the hour your life is now becoming a thunder a living voice ain't that right talking about ministry right and and so uh uh now we know the and and thank God for the message cuz we wouldn't have known it but a man can be absolutely anointed of the Holy Ghost and still be a devil he can prophesy speak in tongues interpret tongues see Visions have dreams dance shout you know cast out Devils perform Miracles and still be a devil Matthew 7:21 see not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth my will which is in heaven Prophet said his will is his word ain't that right his will is his word now many will say unto me in that day see Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works notice they had a Ministry but it was outside the body they had a ministry right see and so he says then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity it therefore whosoever heareth these things of mine and do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock now now we know that's the bride of Christ that's every member that's belongs in the body see and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat up on that house and it fell not for it was founded up on a rock ain't that right so notice what the prophet said Jesus never did anything until seen of the Father the father first showed him see and and Harmony between God and Christ see so will the bride he shows her his Word of Life notice how the ministry functions in the body he shows her his word of life he shows her she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen he said I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride the word is in the body can you say Amen see and the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose they do only his will they prophesy they prophesy in his will according to his will ain't that right when they preach when they sing when they whatever it's in the body they do only his will see he says amen I believe that no one can persuade them different they have this they they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still ain't that right see so now we all know how do we get into the body 1 Corinthians uh two I think or 12 13 says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body by one Spirit everybody say one Spirit we are baptized into one body ain't that right whether we be Jews Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all been made to drink into one spirit so notice the purpose of this body brother Ram says it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like un to himself that would be a word bright so that that's the ministry that that's that's why God the Min the purpose of of the the the ministry of the Holy Spirit the purpose of the ministry of the prophet in this day the purpose of the ministry of the angels and and the purpose of is to bring a people forth like unto himself that will be a word Bride Can you say amen amen now that's the focus is a word bride now now we we we ain't focusing on our ministry we're not focused on well I got to speak in tongues I got to do this I got to do that and and all these things no no no that belongs in the body but the the the goal is God's purpose is to bring a word bride ain't that right because if you're not in that word body if you're not in that word bride you can have gifts and be a loose cannon with it can you say Amen liking to believe anything say anything do anything believe anything see so it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like un to himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation aren't you glad to be part of that body she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her Romans 4:8 see blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members see each of her members was written in the section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world world so as we we're looking at this body uh uh only only the predestinated will go into the body and and you know several quotes here but brother Bram said no man ever sought God God sought the man and the reason he knowed him he saw it before the foundation of the world and predestinated it he predestinated you here to come into the body of Christ he says in another place I'm I'm thankful for a church Universal Triumph already predestinated called and sealed and ordained to the body aren't you glad for that there's a reason that God would call you into this message there's a reason why there's something in you that is is just just draw to this message and wanting to be more like God you were ordained to be that amen sir after being born he says we are predestinated unto the adoption to be placed in the body of Christ another place he says Jesus said all the father ha given me has has given me to redeem all that the father ha given me given me to redeem they died with me at Calvary they raised with me in the resurrection all that he has given me will come to me they'll be placed in the body where foot arm nose mouth whatever it is they'll be placed in there can you say Amen yes sir whatever part of the body God puts you in and has ordained you to be you're still subject to all these gifts you're part of the ministry take your legs away you can't walk so God's got people to be the leg part can you say Amen right every part of the body every remember to the least to the most important whatever that seeth to be important to the very seeth to be the least whatever you're important to God or God would have never ordained you for this we are ordained to that body notice when the last Soul comes into the body the door will be closed for the body will be complete now we're close somewhere amen I believe that yes we're close when that last member comes into the body it's over see God the prophet said is not going to have a freak body or a freak bride right he's not going to have 20 fingers on the hands one hand he's ordained that body to be perfect ain't that right so so if if God's called you to for an little bitty part Rejoice that you're still part of the [Music] [Applause] body sir ain't that right you might be the toe that gets stepped on all the time not the hand not the nose but at least you're part of the body there's a reason Hallelujah brother Braham said see the body will just have so many members whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world which Jesus come to take like Adam walk right out to save his wife so God again has ordained gifts to the body why because the prophet said gifts magnify gifts magnify notice he sends gifts into the church to make his presence known it ain't about you it ain't about me it ain't about my Ministry this is a body Ministry this is a bride Ministry and if you're placed in the body and subject to gifts it's only to make his presence known another place he said we don't believe these Cults and clans we believe God is the word but he embodies himself taken your body my body and gives you gifts gives me gifts and through these gifts He makes himself known so this is why gifts are given to the body of Christ through that Ministry He makes himself known now uh uh brother brandom says what is the body of Christ this is kind of a lengthy quote but he said some are Apostles some are prophets some are teachers some are evangelists some are pastors is that right see we're called to others has Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom knowledge Miracles working of Miracles all these different gifts now what what what do they do what did they do now he's going to talk about uh the Pentecostals uh what did they do they practiced that a little bit what let it run loose they let it run loose like I don't know why see one raised up speaking tongues and the other one go to talking so brother brandom IM imitates the sound of disorder and confusion preachers a preacher will be preaching making altar call and and somebody raise up and speak in tongues Hallelujah glory to God and if the preacher happens to go on with his message being anointed then the people say oh that backslider it's because they're not taught in other words the preacher ignores that that that one that is trying to do the prophesy and speaking in tongues he's out of order to begin with God does not move upon the minister to start preaching and then move up on someone else to stop him brother brandom said that's an disorder that's confusion I'm going to say it's the ministry outside the body so he says see the Bible said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the Prophet God is no author of confusion when I'm standing here I Minister here under the anointing of God no matter how much you want to speak with tongues hold your peace till God's finished here then if you speak with tongues it cannot be everybody say it cannot be some repeating of [Music] scripture but you see he says see because God said don't use vain reputation repetition ain't that right see but it's a message directly to somebody ask me one time put your finger on one time that the Holy Spirit ever under the discernment told somebody repeated a scripture over and over we don't need someone to raise up in the church and say oh well America is finished America is finished God is coming come on we know that right see it see it it and we'll get more into it but it has to be something that it has to be judged hello so now see asked me one time he says see Ever Told repeated a scripture over and over see it told him something that was wrong with them and something that they had had done and something that they must do and something had to happen or something like that see is that right so so is speaking in tongues and interpretation if there's one in the church that speaks with tongues and another interpret it let let it say this let brother Neville raise up and speak with tongues and this brother here give the interpretation say tell this man that yesterday he went out here and done something wrong that that you done see and and now the doctor told him he had cancer go make that thing right come back here and get right with God and then the man would say truly that's the truth then you know God's with you that's what gives her for is to make the presence of God known then you know well then then when it's so precise and so directly then you can judge it that's right that's right on is that right if I you know if if I go you know the prophecy Goes Forth and and here's the way it should be is that the prophecy Goes Forth and we just called you know brother Doug for example you know and not let you done anything okay but but but you go and and say you know brother you know brother Doug y I say to you that a week ago you were out in the bar drinking and you had your arms around a uh uh 21 Oney old girl and and and You' done this and this and this and and you need to go make that right now that is so precise that he can say yes that that is true or that no it isn't am it it has to be judged ain't that right actually brother Brown said it has to be judged before even the church receives it right but it's in the body right why not to magnify the individual that's doing the prophecy or the interpretation that's right is to let the people know that God's with them can you say Amen so then a gift must not be operated in the wrong way or used for the wrong purposes for it will cause confusion well you know 1 Corinthians 14:23 tells us that God is not the the author of confusion ain't that right so then if a gift is m is to make the presence of God known then it must be used according to Bible Doctrine so as not to bring confusion if it brings confusion and God is not the author of confusion then you're not declaring the presence of God among you ain't that right and that that that's the same way from from any anything any gift see so Babylon is confusion ain't that right so when there is confusion people don't know what to do people don't know what to believe people don't know where to go PE PE people don't know where you know God is really moving see they they don't know what signs to believe in they they don't know what preacher to listen to they they don't know whether they should believe in gifts or not they they it's it's a mass confusion well God did not send this message to bring confusion can you say Amen it it's not and so uh uh when it's in the body there should not be that confusion well brother BR said Satan throws confusion upon the people to keep them from having faith to keep them from having faith so now we've been chopped out of Babylon aren't you glad for that by the word of the Lord and and why we been chopped out to be part of this body because God promised that he would get a people out of the Gentiles for his name's sake for that bride and it's in this day that God has chopped out a people chopped out you and I get us away conf from all the confusion and and and well he said and she said and this said and and and we don't know what to believe you know I'm so glad the prophets settles [Applause] it whether we should have a beard or not whether we should have open toe shoes or not whether whe whether you know he even got to settled to where whe whether we should have women should have braided hair or not if it was okay or not you got one one you know here a while back that said well you know told his church you can't have braided hair that's sign of prostitution go back to what a prophet said he said that don't that that ain't anything for today but all of a sudden you listening to this you start listening to that you start listening to that you start listening to that start and before you anoint you're back into confusion can you say Amen see so so then then but God would send a prophet to chop us out of Babylon yes sir ain't that right to be part of this body and then why are we part of this body because we are called to show to the world that Jesus Christ is here he is among the people on this Earth they're saying he's dead but God's got a people on this earth that is part of his body that he has tacing in that body declaring that no he's not dead he is the same yesterday today and forever ain't that right so as members of the body of Christ we are messengers brother BR said you are a messenger this morning you are a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news and he said isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors that we are angels The Messengers of the Resurrection what are we messengers of the Resurrection ain't that right now if you got a Ministry outside outside the body you'll never Proclaim amen it'll never manifest that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it usually exalts the individual ain't that right big Ministry listen to me it's all about me right big name big this big that and usually it's a denomination that support in words something this and something that and they're denying uh uh that God is has sent a prophet they're denying the resurrection that has happened in this age can you say Amen but God has preserved a people ordained them to his body that he can in Tabernacle with and dwell in Amen to show to the world amen we are messengers brother Bram said we are God's Messengers to the sinful world that Christ lives so are we Messengers to the world that Christ lived 2,000 years ago so are we going to give them a history lesson of of what happened and every Easter is our best sermons because we can sure point it and tell the people what happened 2,000 years ago and if we can't get that over then we'll have Easter Plays and and yada yada yada I I don't think that God put put us as his body for this day to give the world a history lesson of what he used to be but notice brother brand said we are God's Messengers to this sinful world that Christ lives in our Spirits he lives in our hearts he lives he brings us from the low debok life of sin and exalts us up and gives us a Hallelujah in our soul and makes us new cre uh new creatures we are messengers angels of the Covenant we are we're part of that body Hallelujah now John 14:17 we've read this many times but it's our scripture even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him so you you have a total different relationship uh with Christ and the the church average church member because you're part of the body he's in the body right you see him in a different way than what the world sees him as see so so he says see neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you see he was dwelling with him now but he said he'll come and he'll be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little world the while the world see me no more but you see me because I live you shall live and at that day and we all know the prophet said this day you shall know that I'm in my father you in me and I in you where's he at in his [Applause] body man he lives forever more he lives forever more and notice this recognition of him being in the father and we in him and he and US did not come in the Pentecostal age and yet they had the gifts in operation they shouted dance wrote on the floor prophesied but notice they misused the gifts speaking in tongues brother brah said and just fly loose any time and he says notice and he's talking about the gift of healing just healing he says healing is a marvelous thing but if it's misused placed in the wrong position I then it becomes a reproach and he said all other gifts are the same but put it in its place and let it be used exactly everybody say exactly the way God intended it to be it'll bring down the power and the blessings of God but out of place out of place that gift out of place that Ministry out of place it'll cause confusion this is why God sent to us a stonemason cuz brother Bram said what good is a stone if there isn't a stonemason to shape him into a Son of God you're just piling a bunch of rocks he said is that right it isn't doing a bit of good see the water wearth away the stone that's right that's the people see what good is Stones if you haven't got a True Stone Mason with a good sharp tool to shape him into The Fitting Place in the house of God just want to ask you what's good the decision what what good you putting your name on the book what good is it to come join the church if the stone Mason isn't there that'll shape that and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians that sits in the house of God with signs following the Believers what what good would it be to have gifts and to be a gifted person if there wasn't a stonemason to shape us we've seen it we've seen guys preachers come through great gifts but it's just po rocks see he said now that's the end time evangelism is taking the stones and shaping them what good would the stones be if you just pile them let them lay where they're at might a little better out there then they would pile them up together see they might be needed out there and none of them out out there see so that's right he said see stone is no good without a stone Mason Jesus counts characters not members you know that he counts characters God has always tried to get one man in his hand that's all he needs is one man and he'll do his work through the years just think he can only find one righteous man in the time of Noah the time of Moses he only found one righteous man ain't that right and in this day in this day when Time and Eternity is blending together they're they're blending now God has a handful of people brother BR said that Bride is a minority very few but but he's got her in his hand and he's able to work his ministry still yet through that group of people do you believe that yes do you love the Lord even though mortal people make up this body the ministry and the operation of this body is the working of the Holy Spirit brother Ram says see God doesn't fall on denominations he doesn't fall upon man uh Mechanical Devices but in the form of the Holy Spirit God fell upon men right so then then then what what Ministry is is that not only are you a Son of God but now you become a servant of God a servant see and you cannot be part of ministry without being a servant even Jesus says there in Mark 10:43 I didn't I don't think I gave this to you uh uh brother Matt but uh whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of of men came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many ain't that right so he's got to be a servant amen any any individual that is part of the body amen has to be a servant amen the heart of a servant a uh uh there and and and because you know you can say well I'm a son I'm I'm a daughter I'm bless God praise the Lord but if you ain't got a servant's heart then then you'll not be for Ministry ain't that right amen and we'll get into it more later on but see so so servant amen it's it's not a servant of the people but it's a servant of God not a servant of people a servant of God not yield it to the people that's not what God wants in a servant not yield it to the people but yield it to God hello well sure you can do all kinds of stuff for people and not be yielded of God then everything that you do is no good because everything that we're doing is counting for eternity we want eternity we we want people to be brought into the kingdom we're working for the kingdom can you say Amen so so the ministry in the body is Anointed with the Holy Spirit and and and and again that means that every member every member no matter how great from the pulpit all the way down has to be anointed or under the control of the Holy Spirit ministers amen Ministry in the body right every member now notice 1 Corinthians 6:19 know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God's ain't that right so so you if you're a part of the body amen then then your plans don't count it's God's plans your dreams don't count it's God's dreams can you say Amen your goals don't count it's God's goals ain't that right notice First Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are ain't that right so here just a few more minutes now but man being God's agent does not do away with the the ministry of the Holy Spirit and and the agency see you know Jesus was God's agent as we had said before and yet the spirit of God anoint wanted him and worked through him do you believe that Bible says that as Jesus was coming out of the water amen that John saw the spirit of God descending upon him as like unto a dove ain't that right the heavens of God open and Luke 3:20 and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape uh like a dove upon him and a voice Came From Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved Son in thee I am well pleased brother Brown said the original translation says in whom I am pleased to dwell in so here was Jesus Christ God's agent and we think oh he's the predestinated to be the Redeemer he's predestinated to do what he was oh praise God glory to God but he had to be anointed for this and according to scripture that as soon as he left there the holy Spirit led him into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil LED so he was the son of God and was a man human flesh yet he was on Earth to do nothing but the will of the father ain't that right but he couldn't do it on his own notice in in Luke 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor Heath sent me to heal the brokenhearted he to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty to them that are bruised to preach the acceptable of the year of the Lord he was he was to do these things it was predestinated for him to do these things but he had to be anointed by the spirit of God to do it in Acts 10:38 it says God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him ain't that right so here here he was and and yet yet being the Redeemer being predestinated to be that lamb before the foundation of the world yet he could do absolutely nothing unless the father showed him first for he says that John 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise ain't that right so now not not not trying trying to diminish who Jesus Christ was in any way amen but just to show you what I'm getting at Jesus was a man couldn't have died unless he was a man he died as a man he hungered as a man he cried as a man he wept as a man he he and and and weary as a man and as a man he was even Limited in his knowledge think of it the Bible says that when the woman with the issue of blood touched him he didn't go right to her and say ah he said who's touched me then he began to look around finding out and Peter I think it was Peter that rebuked him said what what do you mean who touched you we're trying to keep everybody off of you he wouldn't have even went to Lazarus grave if the father hadn't showed him first that Lazarus was going to raise from the dead ain't that right even the disciples asked him to let let Let Them Sit uh I think it was James and John maybe let them sit on his right hand one on the right and one on his left they wanted to sit with him you know and and notice what Jesus said it is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father so see he being God's agent was totally dependent upon the father can you say Amen had to be led of the Father John 8:28 it says then Jesus say unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then you shall know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for I always do those things that please him and because of this he manifested God you with me I I I I want to say this as we close his life was disciplined yes sir he disciplined himself to the father's will he didn't say well you know the spirit of God's on me I now he knew what he was brother brand says that he knew he knew he was Messiah he knew he he even said all all all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but with that he disciplined himself he could have said well I'm going to go empty all the hospitals in I'm going to go out and do this and I'm going to go out and do this and and and and in a lot of cases if it was like us when when they would have came uh uh to to to crucify him I mean even him in the garden was asking the father to let this thing pass from him keep me from this ain't that right but nevertheless thy will be done he was able to discipline himself to the will of the father he said I could have called to 12 Legions of angels and the father would have heard me he had the power to do it but he didn't use that power to do that he used that power Amen to be disciplined to the father's will well that's what the ministry in the body is doing it's a discipline Ministry there is a people that is disciplining themselves well I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God bless God that we just go do anything live any old way act any old way it ain't happening not in the body you say Amen John 3 and 2 it says the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him he was so disciplined his life was a life of discipline not legalistic discipline to walk the father's will that's right to where that the people could see God in him you say Amen in John 14:14 Jesus said the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works so then if you if you look on the day of Pentecost God planted a Pentecostal seed and the Church of the Living God was birthed into existence on that day there was 120 people that were in in the upper room they were scared for their lives they were trembling didn't know what to do and Peter the one that denied Christ three times was among them he hadn't changed just too much and yet he was there he was scared and but notice what Jesus would tell them after he raised from the dead he was fixing to ascend into heaven and here he talks to his disciples Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but T ye in the city of Jerusalem T ye in the city of Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high ain't that right they were not to preach they were not to go out and hold revivals they were not to go out and hold healing campaigns they were not to go out and cast out Devils he didn't want them going out and prophesying and give an interpretation of Prophecy and tongues you didn't want them trying to be the the deacons and this and that everything else he didn't want them to have a Ministry until they were ued with power from on high ain't that right why why why why did they have to wait why because Judas Judas proved that a man can do all of that he could cast out Devils he could heal the sick he could work signs and wonders he could perform Miracles he he proved it and still betray our Lord still be a devil can you say amen he done it all without having the Holy Ghost but Jesus tells them in why in Acts 1 and8 you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me can you say Amen see a man can hold healing campaigns without having the Holy Ghost you can prophesy and have the interpretation of tongues see dreams Visions preach cast out devils and still not be a witness of Christ but when a man is baptized into the body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he becomes a witness of Christ ain't that right he becomes a witness his life is changed his motives are different amen you love the Lord if the musicians will come true Ministry Works within the body of Christ true gifts work within the body are are effective and when I say effective effective toward God's
