father and I pray that just an anointing would just sweep across this building as our prayer for Lord we're your people we desire to meet with you and Lord you promise that we're two or three if it's just two or three gathered in your name you would be here Among Us and father we're under expectation to meet with you we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen we find uh here uh second or Psalms 23 and I'm just going to read the first verse but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen you can have your seats for just a few moments I want to just continue along the lines that um maybe I spoke on last Wednesday just a simple subject but uh the Lord is my shepherd and you know the word Shepherd I'm just looking up the shepherd and it means to feed to tend to flock to keep sheep to rule govern to furnish pasture for food to nourish to cherish one's body to serve the body to Supply the requisites for the Soul's need and then one says the task of a near Eastern Shepherd uh was they were to watch for enemies trying to attack the Sheep to defend the sheep from attackers to heal the wounded and sick sheep defined and saved lost or trapped sheep to love them sharing their lives and so earning their trusts so this was the the shepherd and we we know that sheep must have a Shepherd ain't that right and as we talk in the last you know Wednesday and which the Bible uh confirms it but without a shepherd these sheep will scatter if they don't have one and so in our opening scripture David reckons himself as being a sheep and uh of course he recognizes that the Lord is his Shepherd I think it's important that sheep recognize who the shepherd is right and David is saying the Lord is my shepherd um so he knew who he was following and and so David is when he's saying the Lord is my shepherd he's not he's he's not claiming something that he has no knowledge of I mean you know what good is to say well he's my shepherd and yet we don't know the responsibilities of a Shepherd we don't know the the the what a sheep is or or the role that a sheep would play and and it just becomes a massive confusion but David understood the role of a Shepherd he understood the role that a sheep was because because he was a shepherd and he he he was a Shepherd over his father's sheep ain't that right and so he knew the relationship that the Sheep would have with the shepherd or the shepherd would have with the sheep and he knew how valuable the shepherd was when it came to sheep so there was a bond that existed between the shepherd and the Sheep I was listening to the prophet today and he's talking about the shepherd and how the shepherd He was an unlearned man he he a very uh more ignorant because that's all he'd done in his life was to be a Shepherd I mean he stunk like the the Sheep he smelled like him he he actually the prophets said he began to laugh as a sheep you know just had to ah you know I I don't know how the shepherd laughed but uh uh but the prophet said he he was so at one with the Sheep because that's all he knew he was out there in the field with sheep he wasn't he didn't belong in the civilization he didn't uh uh uh Corrals the towns and all that he was a shepherd effort and so people looked at them as very ignorant but his heart was with the Sheep that's uh that's just what he was and there was an allo the Loyalty that existed between the shepherd and the sheep and and there was a trust a confidence that the Sheep had in the shepherd and so when David is saying the Lord is my shepherd then we're we we understand that this was the type of relationship that David had with the Lord it was a trust it was a confidence it was a it was a bond that existed it was a loyalty that was undying and and so it for example Psalms 31 and 3 this is David and again we look at him as what he describes himself as being the sheep for thou art my rock and my fortune address therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for thou art my strength sheep talking to the shepherd right and he's writing this amen and so David understood that as a a sheep is helpless without the shepherd so was he helpless without the Lord and and as a Shepherd David had to go after uh uh the lamb and in in a couple cases that we know that is found in the Bible the lion had come a greater prey or a predator um uh strong and mighty and he had come after David's sheep and he snatched one uh from the the the the the the flock and and took off with it and and David so loved the Sheep David so loved them that and and David didn't have nothing he was just a boy but he had faith in God and and all he had was just that slingshot but we know the story that he went after that land am and and he delivered that lamb from the the lion's mouth think of the courageous the courage heart amen because he was a Shepherd the Sheep wasn't um the the the the the the Sheep wasn't uh having their confidence in David for nothing uh and then it happened again that that he rescued the lamb from the bear and and uh and and so David again as being the shepherd and acting as a defense for that sheep and and and a leader for the sheep and making sure that the Sheep get fed and and all of these things then he knew that the Lord was his Shepherd and and and notice Psalm 63 and 1 it says the psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek them my soul thirst is worthy My Flesh longest worthy in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory now David wasn't trying to exalt himself he's he's in a need he's he's in a desperate situation ain't that right and he's looking to the shepherd I'm longing for thy power I'm I'm longing for the manifestation of thy glory and and he's not writing to to many Shepherds he's not riding to many gods he's he there's one that is singled out Thou Art my God and early will I seek thee early and and I'm longing for thee I'm Longing To See thy power for my soul thirsteth for thee ain't that right so David is looking for the Lord to come on the scene for the Sheep knows no other power than that of the shepherd it leaves on no other power than that of the shepherd it leans on no other might than that of the shepherd can you say Amen you see for it belongs to the shepherd it's the it's the shepherd's duty to take care of the flock it's the shepherd's Duty a man to protect the Sheep ain't that right so so this is an unknown or whatever you want to call it but it's a bonding it's it's something that the Sheep begins to develop the trust of the shepherd amen and it bleats and waits for its Shepherd when it is lost and so here's the psalmist again Psalm 62 and 1. truly my soul weighth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense and I shall not be greatly moved ain't that right another place Psalm 71 and 5 for thou art My Hope O Lord God for thou art my trust from my youth amen I've trusted you all the way for since my youth amen by thee have I been hold up from the womb Thou Art he that took me out of my mother's bowels and my praise shall be continually Of Thee I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge so there was a strong attachment that David had to the Lord his Shepherd a man as he would begin to express his feelings to the Lord it wasn't just a song that he wanted to sing I know you know there are songwriters that can just come up with songs in in a heartbeat and they'll do it for maybe a certain group or they'll write a song for this and that and that but David was writing songs that was expressing from his heart amen what he really thought of the Lord and his relationship between between him and and his Shepherd ain't that right and I think that all of God's sheep has that attachment I understand we live in a world where there's so much enticements and so many distractions and there's so many voices and and so many promises where you know we got the politicians giving us of promises and jobs that'll give us promises and great men giving Promises of position in and things like that but David he he was a sheep that was looking to his Shepherd can you say Amen the shepherd became his all in all the shepherd ain't that right he wasn't just looking to the shepherd for one thing and looking for this stuff for something else and this for something else the shepherd was everything to him and he's saying Lord you are my shepherd the Lord is my shepherd so so if I need help the Lord is my shepherd if I need strength the Lord is my shepherd if I need guidance the Lord is my shepherd if I need provision the Lord is my shepherd if I need fed the Lord is my shepherd if I'm if if I'm stranded if I'm lost the Lord is my shepherd if I'm in a position that I don't know what to do the Lord is my shepherd can you say amen and and it's an attachment that the the sheep have with their Shepherd and and so we we find you know that that even the the Psalms 20 and 7 some trust in chariots some trust in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord see this this is the attachment everybody else that ain't sheep they they're trusted in this they're trusted in that they're trust they don't know the strength of the shepherd they they don't know the ability of the shepherd they don't trust the abilities the shepherd and and it goes on they are brought down and Fallen but we are risen and stand upright attachment to the shepherd I I think of the time that when Jesus turned to his disciples and asked him will you go also remember the crowd left and he said where will you go also and and and and and and and Peter you know uh another of God sheep he he said Lord to whom shall we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life can you say man so so that Peter may have not understood everything about the Lord he may have not understood everything that Christ was and and the events that were going on but one thing that become clear to him the Lord was my shepherd I I don't know where else to go he had come an attachment there was an attachment I think there's an attachment to Christ I think to that real believer there's an attachment how else do we go where else do we go how can we turn to anything as that attachment what a difference experience that people have with the Lord who are not the Sheep of his pasture and you know we we have one example among many but that's the people of Israel in the wilderness and I'd like to read it and and I won't I won't keep you long the Lord willing but it's just a simple subject but Psalms 106 13. I want to just start there they soon forgot his works they waited not for his counsel but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert and he gave them their requests but seen leanness into their soul they envied Moses also in the camp and Aaron the saint of the Lord the Earth opened and swallowed up days and uncovered the company of a Abram and the fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked they made a calf in horb and worshiped the molten image thus they changed their Glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass they forgot their they forgot God their savior which had done great things in Egypt wondrous works in the land of ham and Terrible Things by the Red Sea therefore he said that he would destroy them had it not been or had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness to overthrow their seed also among the Nations and to scatter them in the lands they joined themselves also unto Baal and and ate the sacrifices of the Dead thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague break in upon them they stood up uh finance and executed judgment so the plague was stayed or then stood up finayas and and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore but notice they angered him also at the Waters of strife so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips they did not destroy the Nations concerning whom the Lord commanded them but were mingled among the Heathen and learned their work see there was no attachment that their story is a totally different story than what David had can you say Amen they they were mingled among the Heathen and learned their worst they served their Idols which were a snare unto them yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils so so you could go on in that scripture that chapter there but it it clearly shows that the Lord was not their Shepherd can you say Amen the Lord you know he might have he he might have just been uh you know just a a second um um a getaway for him if you could say it that way but he certainly wasn't their Shepherd there there was no attachment uh uh there at all there there was no loyalty there at all and and any time that that something appeasing came they went and snatched it up and they would forget God and that's the way the churches have today that's why America's done it today ain't that right see so so we find that David knew the voice of a shepherd and followed him so much that that the psalm 68 and or 63 and 8 David would say my soul followeth hard after thee that he wasn't passive about it he was intent about it everything about him was to follow the lord amen he was a sheep afraid to get to get get lost he had to keep that Shepherd near near him right following the shepherd the Lord is my shepherd you see it's it's not just talk it's a reality to every believer The Lord Is Our Shepherd do you have him as your Shepherd tonight see the Lord was his comfort it was his guide it was his his protector and he says I will not fear because he knew that the shepherd was with him every son and daughter of God are sheep no if ends butts about it we're all sheep if we're Sons and Daughters of God the Bible says we are the Sheep of his pasture ain't that right and even Jesus claims us as being his sheep for he said my sheep know my voice my sheep know my voice ain't that right and so we can say as David said the Lord is my shepherd and I am his sheep he belongs to me as my shepherd and I belong to him as his sheep and when we say that then we come to the realization that I am his responsibility it's up to him to take care of me it's up to him to provide for me it's it's up to him to to keep me safe it's up to him to to go on a defense for me it's up to him can you say Amen to keep me from the enemy it's all up to him for he's the shepherd and that's what God wants us to be as the shepherd or or the Sheep ain't that right amen that that's the relationship that he wants us to have not us trying to get the steering wheel and tell God what to do and how to do it and and and and and and put all the second plans together just in case his plan doesn't work but we come totally lenient upon him and at his Mercy now in John chapter 10 Jesus tells us what he is I am the Good Shepherd I'm the door of the Sheep the sheep hear my voice I call my sheep by name and lead them out I go before my sheep and they follow me for they know my voice is all in the 10th chapter Jesus speaking and establishing himself as the shepherd He was David Shepherd was he not amen that's right and and then Jesus goes on to say a stranger they will not follow a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers and did you notice sheep walked by faith and not by wisdom sheep ain't walking following the shepherd said now you know what I I think I know you're going that direction but I think I would go this way if I was you no they walked by faith totally lenient upon the shepherd totally trusting the shepherd total confidence in the shepherd ain't that right see and and so they I go before my sheep and they follow me for they know my voice they're acquainted with my voice they do not lean upon their own understanding but they follow the shepherd ain't that right yes sir see and so then we find that Jesus not only tells us in the 10th chapter of John that he is the Good Shepherd but he also mentions some other things and he tells us that there's a thief and that Thief is out to kill to steal and to destroy I think him by mentioning that sheep or the the thief and what he's intending or intentions to do it it ought to magnify the greatness of the shepherd can you say Amen the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy John 10 10 and I am come that they may have life and might have it more abundantly and you say Amen so the Good Shepherd he knows who this thief is and he sets himself to protect the Sheep now I I be honest we see the thief working overtime in this age and he's leaving a path of destruction ain't that right just leave it a path of Destruction to where to where when when he's done with families they no longer resemble a family when he's done with individuals they no longer resemble the individuals that they were born as they they he just leaves us such a a path of Destruction that they're left so demoralized they're they're left lower than than an animal many times in their morale can you say man and and so he's working and as that you know the the prophet talking he said as that Land The Lion and the bear that David faced the enemy has come and calls God sheep to Bob off their hair and to wear their makeup and to look like things that the Bible condemns ain't that right amen and and this is that Thief he's he he he he's he's Robin of everything he's his whole intention is to destroy and if you don't have the shepherd to protect you amen and and and the thing is is Satan thinks that he's got the people you know but I like what brother Branham said we've got the slingshot of Prayer ain't that right we got the slingshot of prayer and you know the the prophet in his prayer he tells the devil he says I place and I think this is powerful I place between this habits and tempers and immorals and whatever it may be I place the blood of Jesus Christ by faith between them and that thing hello I think that's what the Good Shepherd does don't you think so he places something between us and the enemy that's right and he says and you'll not catch them anymore they're in the father's pasture they're they are his children keep them keep from them in the name of Jesus Christ Our Jersey can you say Amen so we we find that this is what we're we're dealing with the thief that is out to kill steal and destroy but then Jesus also speaks of the hireling in the same chapter as he's speaking of him being the the shepherd he's speaking of the thief but then he speaks of that hireling he's not a shepherd and the Sheep are not his own he's a paid servant and works for someone else ain't that right entirely and he doesn't have a Shepherd's Heart ain't that right he doesn't care anything about the sheep that he's watching over amen the prophet said when he sees the sheep or the Jesus said when he sees the the wolf coming amen after the Sheep the shepherd rungs or or that howling rooms he's fearful for his own life ain't that right and then the wolf catches the sheep and scatters the and scatters them but see God doesn't leave his sheep in the hands of a hireling God's going to make sure that sheep is protected and I you know this may not even make sense to you tonight but all I I want to just assure you that if you're God sheep you don't have to fear nothing he's he's the great Shepherd if if you're in the hands of God God's going to take care of his sheep if you're following the voice can you say Amen that's right see there's a nature of the shepherd there's a nature of the Sheep amen the the shepherd calls calls his Sheep by his voice utters his voice and the Sheep by Nature follows the voice because he knows the voice he's not questioning the voice he's not scared of the voice he's not trying to shun from the voice that voice is his comfort for it's the voice of his Shepherd amen now so we we find that Jesus the Good Shepherd he said I laid down my life for the Sheep look at David running willing to sacrifice life for that sheep that he was a type of Christ I laid my life down for the Sheep ain't that right now John 10 27 he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me not my follow they follow me and I give unto them eternal life now how are you gonna how are you going to be despaired in that the great Shepherd gives you the greatest thing that you could ever have and that's eternal life and they shall never everybody say they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand that's the great Shepherd that's speaking to us every one of us tonight can you say Amen when it seems like it's all just chaos and it seemed like we don't know what to do remember sheep you're in his hand And he as the shepherd made the promise there's nothing that'll plucked you out of my hand ain't that right so he's obligated himself to you yes sir you believe that yes sir I I believe that amen nothing nothing and my father which gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand so you're in you're you're in the great Shepherd's hands but you're in his father's hands how are you gonna how are you gonna lose with that one praise God so what it telling us is there's no way there's absolutely no way that the sheep can ever be separated from the shepherd there's there's no way that the Sheep could ever be so far from that Shepherd that the shepherd can't reach down with his hand and pull him back and you say man now there is there there is a way to know if we are sheep John 10 25 Jesus said just break it in here the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me and he tells them but you believe not because you are not my sheep you're not of my sheep so you don't believe the works that I do the very works that testifying of who I am you don't believe them simply because you're not of my sheep so this tells us the opposite that if you are a sheep and the works are displayed you're going to believe them works right and you say man so now Jesus is that good shepherd he's the chief Shepherd he's the he's the as the prophet would call him the king shepherd we also see that God has placed men in the church to be his little Shepherds Jeremiah 23 and 3. and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries wither I have driven them and will bring them again to their Folds and they shall be fruitful and increase and I will set up Shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the Lord the flock will not no longer fear no more be dismayed neither will they be lacking because God would shed us set up his Shepherds and you say man and I I believe this correlates with what Jesus tells Peter Peter do you love me yeah I love you feed my Lambs is that right second time Jesus tells him Peter do you love me yeah I love you feed my sheep right what's he doing the prophet said Christ is the shepherd He was going away and he was leaving the commission of his sheep which any Shepherd feeds which is his flock his church and he was leaving the commission with these disciples to continue to feed the flock to be a Shepherd to feed the sheep ain't that right I thought of the Prophet how he told us this he says it was the father's good will before the foundation of the world descend me to preach the gospel and Lead his sheep so brother Branham even knew that his responsibility was a shepherd over the Sheep of God and that it would please God it was the father's Good Will to place him a man in this world for this age to feed the sheep of God even the angel told Brother Brown said you were born on Earth to be a leader not a dictator not a king a shepherd a Shepherd can you say Amen so we find that Moses was a prophet Shepherd God Vindicated that Prophet Shepherd the prophet said to be The Shepherd of the Sheep but notice Moses as a prophet had the word in his mouth showing that he had the voice of God right my sheep know my voice my sheep know my physical looks nope see they're trying to make Jesus into a physical thing of today and they paint him all kinds of things but but we found out that the sheep can only know their Shepherd by The Voice ain't that right so here Moses had the very word of God the voice of God in his mouth and when he began to speak the Sheep recognized The Voice God was speaking through that Prophet so they recognized the voice of the great Shepherd and any true sheep of God can identify where the great Shepherd is or identify the great Shepherd by his voice and notice the prophet would tell us it's a scriptural voice amen praise the Lord amen can you say Amen because we want to be led right do we not we want to be led right because there's a thief out there and if we get fired from the shepherd the thief is going to kill us there's hirelings out there that if if the wolf comes the hurling is going to leave us but if we stay with the shepherd ain't that right so God would give us a prophet as our Shepherd as a shepherd and and we recognize that it's God's Shepherd because it's the voice of God speaking through him ain't that right that's why I don't have any qualms about this message I believe it's thus saith the Lord I believe this message is the voice of God my confidence is in there and and I'm attached to that message because it's the voice of the shepherd it's more than just the voice of a man it's not just a voice of a prophet it's the voice of the great Shepherd speaking through that prophet and I found I have an attachment to it I found that I'm safe with it I found I'm secured with it I find he's providing for me with that message can you say amen and and the enemy is all around the enemy is lurking all around but I'm safe I'm safe following the shepherd I'm safe because I know his voice it's a scripture voice can you say Amen also according to God's word God has placed the pastor in the local church as his Shepherd over the local flock Acts 20 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and do all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers defeat the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this after that after my departing shall Grievous wolves full surprise Apostles enter in among you not sparing the flock can you say man so here we find that God would set Paul as the Apostle of that first church or the or I'm going to put it The Shepherd of the first church age the voice of God speaking through him he said I did not receive this of man nor did I receive it of myself I received this of God and he became the voice of God to that age you believe that but now he's getting ready to leave and and and the Wolves all around knowing that he's getting ready to leave and they're just waiting for him to leave to where they can just come in and to Devour the the flock but then God would set pastors Ministry can you say amen and Paul knowing this see after my departing shall Grievious Wolves and the prophet said false apostles nicolaitanism right will enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speak and perverse things in other words the prophet said their own word everybody say their own word their own ideas see they're speaking their own words so they're not the real Shepherd speaking their own ideas and not gods and the whole point is to draw away disciples after them acts 28 and 20 and 30. now brother Brandon would say we Brethren and ministers we tried to live as close to God as we can because we have a sacred duty to watch over the flock of God which the Holy Spirit has made us overseers and I I I I I don't just attribute it just to pastors I I attributed to the faithful Ministry we as feeders of the flock of God and you say man we we have this sacred duty to watch over the flock of God which the Holy Spirit hath made us overseers we watch the flock to keep them in order to feed them sheep's food and sheep eats from the Bible the Lambs of God and you say man now notice another place brother Brown said it's the duty of we as pastors to see that this flock is fed and fed right because God Almighty will require your blood in our hands at the day of the Judgment we'll answer for you so seeing this great tremendous responsibility that's placed upon us and God has given us people who love us and come to hear us then we should spend our time constantly watching for your souls and when the first little thing we see raise it up that's not right it's our duty to come to that person because we are Shepherds watching that sheep and you say man not not now notice what a Shepherd sees that's not right not sheep picking on sheep not sheep trying to be Shepherd the shepherd can you say Amen see so he says see we should spend our time and then when the first see we're watching we're Shepherds watching that sheep so if I see a sheep eating on a weed that will kill it I better drive it away from that weed jerk the weed right away from it so it can't get to it because it'll kill the Sheep yeah ain't that right he said there's known in the Western countries a weed an animal can eat is called Loco wheat I don't know whether anybody's ever heard of it or not it's a loco weed a horse can eat that and you can't do anything with him he just becomes an outlaw you can't put a saddle on him you can't do nothing with him it's called Loco wheat you must keep your stock away from that weed because if it'll if it'll cause a horse to eat something like that a horse it'll eat it'll throw him in this condition to the spasm you'd be a very poor Cowboy to let your horse eat a weed local wheat it shows that you don't care and a real Pastor a real servant of Christ would be a poor example of Christ to see the sheep eat something that's going to drive him away or make him an outlaw before God a breaker of his word a breaker of his Commandments you shouldn't do that you should watch very closely can you say man now so we we find that Shepherds and sheep they're they're such a relationship such a responsibility thinking of shepherds brother Brown says you know in preaching the message why why it had to be Shepherds brother Branham gives the answer to that very question that he's asking why did it have to be Shepherds he said because God's lamb Jesus being God's lamb was born in a manger ain't that right and it couldn't be kings that would come to him it had to be Shepherds Kings wouldn't Rejoice about a lamb being born but a Shepherd would a Shepherd felt at home with the lamb ain't that right and he was the Vindicated word and he says the Shepherds fell completely at ease in that place with God's lamb now what was God's lamb the Vindicated word any time where there's a vending the vending the words Vindicated the shepherd always feels at home can you say Amen and any good shepherd does the same thing see they found that place with God's lamb and any good shepherd does the same thing when a Good Shepherd over the sheep can see the word made plain and Vindicated of what he promised to do that Shepherd's right at home if God's not vindicating it then the shepherd's not at home the shepherd's not going to lead his sheep in that direction the shepherd doesn't lead his sheep into psychology the shepherd doesn't lead his sheep into theology the shepherd ain't going to lead his sheep into things that that God has never Vindicated can you say Amen that's why we feel at home with the Vindicated word of the age ain't that right I I know I you know I I know that there's great commentators and they were they're great men and they had great things to say and great preachers of the past had great things but I'm just not at home in their field but I'm I'm at home with the Vindicated word of God now he says see I don't care what anyone else says see there's where God promised it and God did it and that's where the Shepherds at home at they say well the days of Miracles is past there's no such thing as a baptism of this Holy Spirit there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy spirit that was for the apostles but let a true Shepherd of the word preach it in the power of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's what a true Shepherd will preach because that's where he's home at it's the thing that's promised Peter said on the day of Pentecost he said the promise is is unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call where every calls the promise and the blessing is true and let a genuine word-feeding Shepherd see that Vindicated and all the theologians of the world can't take it away from him because he know God said so and it happens I still believe that God feels with the Holy Ghost do you still believe that why we've seen it that's why we ain't going to bypass that that's why we're not going to water this thing down I believe in a in a power Deliverance [Applause] I've seen the drugs delivered I still believe he can do it today I've seen the people that had cigarette problems I've seen them delivered he can still do it today that's where we're at home at can you say man where the word is being Vindicated is where we are at home we feel at home why see it's just God's word always his word was made flesh and dwelling among them see now the prophet said see he promised the same thing in this day what the word made flesh the word going to become flesh in this day he says I wonder if we would recognize it the proud and the wise had never received such a thing as that they believed that if there was such a thing as the Messiah on the earth it would certainly have come to their denomination it would be their group that would receive it see or it wasn't right just think hard now he said if it ended their group see did you notice then God never chose any out of the group that he chose that who wasn't connected with any of it because one group would say well you see what we did and and they'd do the same thing today but God chooses the nobody that's the reason he chose the shepherd because the Shepherds was completely at home with God lamb in their Mists oh my his word made flesh among them well I love him so any true Shepherd stays with the message of the hour ain't that right because you know that's where the Lamb of God is amen that's right and notice the prophet says that correct Shepherd will feed his congregation on the word the lamb right now I'm going to close here that Revelations 2 17. he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden manna ain't that right so God promised hidden manna aren't you glad they're still hidden manna not local weed hidden manna that's right see and brother Raymond speaking of that scripture says this the hidden Manna it's a little something special what is the special he said see it's not not the blessing of the Holy Ghost see no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden manner was a special Revelation because he had to teach the others see it was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others he's supposed to be see you'll never live no higher than your pastor you just remember that see because he's the Shepherd that feeds you if the if he's the shepherd he's got to know where the Manna is to feed the sheep ain't that right see sheep will only grow as you feed the sheep sheep food ain't that right he says if you try to fire fry up a big Hamburg and give it to the Sheep he couldn't grow on that see that's not cheap food try to try to try to fix a nice T-bone steak fix it up give it to the Sheep it's not sheep food so it can't grow sheep like sheep food sheep must have sheep food are you with me hey man there there's a certain food there's a certain diet that sheep God sheep got to have ain't that right and God promised a hidden manna for his sheep it's not for anyone else it's for his sheep and it's true so a true Shepherd ain't gonna feed the sheep of God some man-made idea and you say man see so Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone the great Shepherd my sheep cannot live by just bread alone but they're going to live by every word everybody say every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God now look how lean the church has been All Through the Ages because he could not live by every word there was too much dogmas in it there was too much interpretations of man this book was a closed book then you say Amen it would only be in this day amen praise God hello brother Brown said there ain't you know uh uh talking about faith is going to take more faith than it ever was in any other age right well if we're gonna have to have more faith than any other age then there has to be the right food to give us the right kind of faith and brother Brandon said it's rapturing faith ain't that right why because this is the age of a rapture and not one sheep of God is going to miss the rapture so that great Shepherd has been watching over his sheep All Through the Ages yes sir and his sheep is going to thrive they can only Thrive off the word of God the hidden manna ain't that right now we know what the matter is in the Old Testament the man that came from heaven and it landed upon the Earth right it was a bread certain kind of a bread that's right yeah now they all ate that bread but they were told you cannot store that bread up you try to save it it'll get all maggoty worms be horrid and no doubt some of them unbelievers try to do it make a denomination out of it and set a final life they found death ain't that right but there's only one place that that manner live forever and that was in The Presence of Jehovah and it was known as The Hidden manner it wasn't for everybody it was only for those that was chosen to go in and those that were chosen to go into that place could testify that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever and God promised the fact would be the manner that he would feed his sheep amen now let's look at that Manna Jesus 6 32. I just love the great Shepherd are you I'm glad the Lord's my shepherd then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God which he uh is he say that again for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world so the bread has now become a person can you say man and notice he says it's the true bread remember going to church age book and and notice how brother Branham partial realization and true realization Jesus says I am the true bread I am the True Vine I'm the true he always put himself as the truth the true the true and the prophets at Sea notice partial realization versus true perfect realization the Old Testament was like like that hidden manner that they ate in the Old Testament that was partial realization in other words they would eat of it but it was not the thing that God had provided them as a permanent uh uh uh uh permanent thing but as they would eat they would look and and that bread testified of another bread to come that if you would ever eat that bread you'd never have to hunger again man can you say Amen the natural lamb spoke of a true lamb to come now we're not living in the parcel we are living in the perfect realization God not sinning God not sending bread from Heaven as he did in Israel Amen to the people of Israel he sent the true bread and Jesus is saying I am that true bread so the bread is a person yes it is then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread sheep crying for bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life what was he then he was the Vindicated word the word made flesh can you say Amen no wonder Shepherds were at home with Vindicated words sheep are at home in Vindicated word as well sheep grow from the Vindicated word sheep food hope is all right I am the bread of life he that comes to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst now go to the 54th verse whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me he sent by the same God that sent the partial the same God that sent Israel bread here's the true bread sent from God [Music] as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever now did you notice it's in this day that God promised us in the matter and God has sent the manor John 14 18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yeah a little while the world seeth me no more but you'll see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in my father you and me and I in you ain't that right at that coming what a revelation that that happens to us that we realize he's not only in the father he's in us and we are in him Revelations 10 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven what is it it's the true bread it's the hidden manner hello Jesus promised he that he liveth beareth of me will live by me he had eaten my place you'll never eat a third Hunger again can you say amen I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven only Christ it could be so now what are we looking at him as not only are chief Shepherd but we're looking at him as our sheep food in this age something that most ministers ain't got hello I'm telling you people think you can just listen to any kind of a minister and just all that and get fed sheep you better watch it sheep sheep's got to have sheep food clothed with the cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet his pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little open book see what is it God sending Manna From Heaven hidden manner ain't that right he's the man that comes from Heaven I like this brother Branham in his prayer said oh lamb come tonight in our midst and take the book and open the seals thereof and loosen the word to us and feed it to us as our great Shepherd and we your sheep so Desiring sheep food what is it it's the opening of the seals it's the opening of the word it's the message of the hour that we're feeding upon and yet is the unfailing bodied word of the son of man that we're feeding off of the Vindicated word can you say man if the musicians will come what makes a sheep because we go to church no because we we say God sent a prophet no we become sheep when we receive the Holy Ghost ain't that right and if you're a Believer then God gives you the Holy Ghost brother Brian said if you say you're a Believer and you don't receive the Holy Ghost then something's wrong because God promised that to every believer he would feel with the Holy Ghost God gives everybody every believer the baptism of Holy Ghost Holy Spirit that's right for that's the confirmation of your faith and it's then that we become Sheep by Nature because we receive the nature of the Lamb can you say man and then we become willing to eat I know there's a lot of folks that say they've got the Holy Ghost but are they willing to follow the shepherd home are they willing to eat the Sheep food that God's sins has sent in this day not not personality not Charisma you can't eat off of personality you can't eat from Charisma you can't eat man's theology man-made Doctrine God sent sheep food for his sheep and we begin to realize that there is this connection there's this attachment that we have with him we find that it's it's the whole it's it's it's it's everything everything the mighty angel coming it's the presence of the great Shepherd him crying with a loud voice is the voice of the great Shepherd we find the words that's coming and of course it's the the the the the the the the seventh angel comes and is given the book to reveal to the people so the sounding of the seventh angel is the voice of the great Shepherd and the and the food that has been given remember he he was told to store up food spiritual food in due season we're realizing that this message is everything we need I don't need this message plus I just need the message I I I I I find that the great Shepherd has made himself known through his voice can you say amen and as long as we stay with that voice and as long as that voice is sounding Out the Sheep will follow the Sheep will be fed the Sheep will know can you say Amen God bless you what song [Music] greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me [Music] greater is he that is in me
