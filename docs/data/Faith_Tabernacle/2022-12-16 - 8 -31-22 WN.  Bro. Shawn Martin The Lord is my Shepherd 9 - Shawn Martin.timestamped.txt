[0:08] man why David was King and there was a
[0:12] prophet in the land
[0:13] and he that prophet
[0:15] amen should have been the one bringing
[0:17] the word back not David
[0:19] ain't that right the word should have
[0:21] been brought back to the prophet brother
[0:23] Brown said the reason that God sends
[0:25] prophets is because they have the word
[0:28] of the Lord now I hope this is all
[0:30] making sense to you tonight
[0:32] Amen to show you amen these things the
[0:35] word of the Lord comes to the prophets
[0:37] and if he doesn't have the word of the
[0:39] Lord then he's not a prophet
[0:42] ain't that right and the prophet is the
[0:45] Divine interpreter of the word
[0:48] yes sir so as we talked about it uh or
[0:51] just mentioned it about the he the lamb
[0:54] taking that book
[0:56] amen and opening the seals or loosening
[0:59] the seals opening that book and sending
[1:02] it down to his angel that seventh angel
[1:04] ain't that right to reveal it to his
[1:07] people and brother Brown said the seven
[1:09] Angel has to be Prophet for the word of
[1:11] God to come to no priest popes
[1:17] your young people don't don't get
[1:19] confused as to who you need to listen to
[1:22] you might have friends
[1:25] that trying to get you to listen to this
[1:27] radio preacher in this television
[1:29] evangelist
[1:30] you may have preachers leave this
[1:32] message and they might send a tape to
[1:33] you
[1:36] they've never been a prophet
[1:39] I ain't got time to listen to them
[1:42] hello I gotta live
[1:45] I need that food to live
[1:48] and so no priests popes or anything else
[1:51] can get it the word don't come to such
[1:53] the word of God comes only to a prophet
[1:56] always Malachi 4 promised such and when
[2:00] you would come forth he had take the
[2:02] mysteries of God where the church had
[2:05] got all scrupled up in all these
[2:07] denominations and restore
[2:10] restore the faith restored the life
[2:14] see restore the faith of the children
[2:18] back to the fathers then the world
[2:20] judgment will strike and the Earth would
[2:23] be burned up and and then the righteous
[2:26] will walk out upon the ashes of the
[2:28] wicked in the Millennium ain't that
[2:30] right oh we got a bright future
[2:33] yes sir see and and so but notice now
[2:37] amen what what how did it affect John
[2:41] when the book was open now this is all
[2:45] personal to us
[2:46] amen uh how did it affect him brother
[2:49] Branham he's saying this uh everything
[2:53] in heaven everything in Earth everything
[2:55] beneath the Earth every creature
[2:58] everything else heard me speaking of
[3:00] John was John is saying this in
[3:02] Revelations amen blessings Glory wisdom
[3:05] power might and riches belongs to him
[3:08] amen and then brother Branham would ask
[3:10] why why why would he do this why why is
[3:14] he so excited and what what happened
[3:17] when this book was open well brother
[3:19] Brown said the Revelation had come to
[3:22] John that the lamb the Redeemer our
[3:25] Kinsmen had come back from the Throne of
[3:29] minitorial and it walked out here to
[3:32] take his possession
[3:35] Hallelujah
[3:37] he had walked out to take his possession
[3:41] and that's what that open book meant to
[3:44] him
[3:45] now Church John represented you and I
[3:48] that's what the prophet said he was a
[3:50] type of us
[3:51] amen and and I know they want to
[3:53] criticize our shouting they want to
[3:55] criticize the way we we get excited
[3:58] about this word but see if you're eating
[4:00] from the open book
[4:02] one thing is going to come clear to you
[4:05] that you are his
[4:06] hello you were in his mind before the
[4:10] foundation of the world and if there's
[4:11] anybody that he come to redeem it was
[4:14] you
[4:15] ain't that right and we are in
[4:17] Redemption claims and if there's every
[4:20] anyone that he's going to claim it's me
[4:23] I'm the one that's going to be in the
[4:25] Rapture I don't know about everybody
[4:26] else but I know this the book has been
[4:29] opened and has become a personal thing
[4:32] to me I am feeding off of it I'm going
[4:36] in a rapture all right yes sir
[4:40] and notice when the book was open he
[4:43] wasn't weeping
[4:44] he wasn't sad
[4:47] you know he was he was weeping sad
[4:49] before the book came open
[4:52] but the lamb came forth
[4:54] and opened the book
[4:56] ain't that right
[4:58] amen and and instead of weeping instead
[5:01] of being sad and down face he entered
[5:04] into worship
[5:06] he entered into praise can you say amen
[5:09] he is wearing his fretting was over
[5:12] ain't that right he knew that his future
[5:16] was settled
[5:18] [Applause]
[5:19] amen he was at rest
[5:23] is that what the green pastors
[5:25] he maketh me to lie down
[5:28] isn't that what it's typifying
[5:31] I'm at rest I'm contented
[5:33] he leads me by the Steel Waters
[5:37] brother brother Andrew said he looked it
[5:39] up in that in his in his Bible there and
[5:41] it said Waters of rest
[5:45] it's rest
[5:47] the food that we're eating is giving us
[5:50] rest
[5:51] the word from our bridegroom is nothing
[5:55] but a word that gives us rest
[5:57] can you say Amen
[5:59] I I know the world is falling apart but
[6:02] I'm at rest
[6:03] I know judgments are coming all around
[6:05] but it does not concern me I'm in the
[6:08] book of redemption can you say Amen I'm
[6:11] eating a different food
[6:15] resting in his word
[6:18] think of it I saw another Mighty Angel
[6:21] come down with an open book and he cries
[6:24] out with a loud voice
[6:27] Paul would say for the Lord himself
[6:29] shall descend with a shout voice and
[6:31] Trump
[6:32] what is it this is Our Redeemer
[6:35] claiming
[6:37] what he has redeemed
[6:40] pouring life into his redeemed
[6:44] bringing a restoration
[6:47] ain't that right
[6:49] did not the words of Boaz put Ruth's
[6:54] thrust
[6:56] hello
[6:58] for he said unto her fear not
[7:02] that's what Boaz said to his bride fear
[7:04] not
[7:05] I will do to thee all that thou
[7:09] requireest
[7:12] I will redeem thee
[7:17] and them words put her at rest
[7:20] oh
[7:22] Hallelujah I've noticed that of all the
[7:26] seminaries that have produced preachers
[7:28] they still can't give the people rest
[7:32] that's right amen the God would send the
[7:35] prophet to us
[7:37] to reveal the open book
[7:40] and through this message it puts us at
[7:42] rest because we realize it's more than a
[7:45] prophet it's the voice of a bridegroom
[7:48] speaking to us
[7:50] Redemption
[7:55] now if you'll notice David said he leads
[7:58] me beside the Still Waters
[8:02] water is a type of the Holy Spirit
[8:05] water is also important because it it
[8:09] represents life
[8:11] ain't that right
[8:13] if you're thirsty for fresh water
[8:16] you have to know where it is
[8:19] in order to get a drink
[8:23] you can't also you can't water anything
[8:26] if I say well I'm going to
[8:28] I'm going to go water
[8:31] the grass
[8:34] I gotta have water first
[8:36] in order to water
[8:39] that's right ain't that right
[8:41] so water is important but God made sure
[8:44] he's always made sure that there's water
[8:47] when the children of Israel were dying
[8:49] of thirst God calls water to come from
[8:51] The Rock and that rock was Christ Paul
[8:54] said
[8:55] ain't that right
[8:57] and so David was led by The Still Waters
[9:02] showing that Christ was present
[9:05] that rock where else would the water
[9:08] come from
[9:10] but Christ the Rock
[9:13] then you say Amen so wherever the water
[9:16] is you'll find Christ and wherever
[9:18] Christ is you'll find the water
[9:20] ain't that right
[9:22] in the Old Testament there were two
[9:24] kings that led both their armies out
[9:26] into the desert Jehoshaphat and maybe
[9:29] ahab's son or Ahab I don't know but but
[9:32] they they LED their armies out into the
[9:34] desert and and someone forgot to bring
[9:37] the water Jack
[9:38] right and and and so they were dying of
[9:41] thirst and they didn't know where to
[9:43] find the water
[9:45] now to think of that you're thirsty but
[9:48] you don't know where the water is you as
[9:50] far as they were concerned there was no
[9:52] water
[9:53] but but one was you know had enough
[9:56] sense to know there's a prophet in the
[9:59] land
[10:02] let's inquire of him surely he will know
[10:05] where the water is
[10:07] can you say man
[10:09] see the water was hidden to them
[10:12] that's right see amen so they consulted
[10:16] the the the the prophet and he told them
[10:19] where the water was
[10:22] and our Prophet tells us it was the same
[10:25] water that flowed out of that rock for
[10:29] the previous generations
[10:32] same water
[10:34] not a new water same water
[10:38] can you say amen I I thank God for uh
[10:42] sending us a prophet
[10:44] because it's in this day that he would
[10:46] show us where the water is
[10:49] can you say Amen it's that same spirit
[10:52] that was in Christ that fell on the day
[10:55] of Pentecost is here with us today and
[10:58] that's where the water is
[11:01] the water
[11:03] amen
[11:05] see so hidden food hidden water
[11:08] it takes a profit
[11:11] to tell us
[11:14] take so profit to bring us our food
[11:17] takes the profit to reveal where the
[11:20] water is
[11:22] ain't that right
[11:23] so you must must not never underestimate
[11:26] the prophet in his message
[11:29] I know people you know Satan's got them
[11:31] always you got them you know uh down on
[11:35] the prophet and all that and then you
[11:36] got them worshiping the prophet there's
[11:39] always two ways of it in two extremes
[11:42] but the rats stand right in that middle
[11:45] can you say Amen we're not one
[11:47] worshiping the prophet we worship the
[11:50] god of that prophet
[11:52] yes sir you know Israel was blessed
[11:57] because they had a prophet among them
[12:02] brother Branham said they were not an
[12:04] organized Nation like the other nations
[12:05] but they prospered
[12:08] They Came Upon the Nations and took them
[12:11] anything that came in the way he said
[12:13] they they took it
[12:15] because they had a prophet
[12:17] and this is balak's words the king of
[12:21] Moab when he looked down upon Israel
[12:23] he says they lick up all that are around
[12:26] about us
[12:27] as the ox lift licketh up the grass of
[12:31] the field
[12:32] and they cover the face of the Earth
[12:36] and and and this is balak that was
[12:39] looking at the people of Israel and he
[12:41] didn't understand why
[12:43] ain't that right he didn't understand
[12:44] why they prospered he just knew they did
[12:47] he didn't understand the the the key of
[12:50] them conquering but he just knew they
[12:53] did
[12:54] but brother Brandon would tell us the
[12:56] key was there was a prophet among them
[12:59] someone that led them
[13:03] can you say Amen the key to their
[13:06] prospering was a prophet being among
[13:08] them
[13:09] the key to them looking up Elder enemies
[13:12] was because a prophet was among them
[13:18] I think that applies it today
[13:20] and brother Brown said that Prophet was
[13:22] a Divine called leader ain't that rocked
[13:26] so notice David would say the Lord is my
[13:29] shepherd He leadeth me beside the Still
[13:33] Waters
[13:34] and a lot of people say well I don't
[13:36] need a prophet I got the Holy Ghost to
[13:37] Lead Me
[13:38] you've got to go the way God does it
[13:41] [Applause]
[13:44] can you say Amen
[13:45] now he told Moses I'm going to send mine
[13:47] Angel to go before you he's going to
[13:49] lead you but who was there before the
[13:51] people a prophet
[13:54] wherever that Prophet was the people
[13:56] needed to be
[13:58] and wherever the spirit of God was the
[14:00] prophet was
[14:01] he was the key to the spirit of the Lord
[14:03] he won't say it that way I just believe
[14:06] that amen but see is this not what
[14:09] happened Amen to Rebecca in the Old
[14:12] Testament being led to the waters
[14:15] brother Brown said it was in the evening
[14:17] time when she was led to the Water of
[14:19] Life
[14:20] about the time she had to make a
[14:23] decision
[14:23] [Applause]
[14:24] and the angel of the Lord told her to go
[14:28] and at the evening time she was led to
[14:33] the Waters of life
[14:36] ain't that right
[14:38] now Romans 8 14 says as many as are led
[14:41] by the spirit of God these are the sons
[14:45] of God
[14:46] ain't that right
[14:48] so these these these Sons again have a
[14:50] sheep like nature and Rebecca is a type
[14:53] of the uh of the Bride in these last
[14:56] days the evening time and notice what
[14:58] the prophet says the evening lights are
[15:00] here it's the time that the angel of the
[15:03] Lord in a Supernatural is revealing
[15:06] himself to the Rebecca the Bride of
[15:09] Isaac and somehow or another she's moved
[15:13] to go to the Waters of life
[15:16] amen oh my heart is turning over with
[15:20] joy I can hardly preach when I think of
[15:22] that the evening time is here it's come
[15:26] the angel of the Lord is in the message
[15:31] Goes Forth and Woos the Rebecca to come
[15:35] to the Waters of life
[15:39] is that not what the message is doing
[15:43] the Lord
[15:44] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters
[15:48] and it would be so happened that it
[15:50] would be in the evening time
[15:52] that the angel of the Lord in the
[15:54] message of this hour is leading us to
[15:57] the waters
[15:58] can you say man and notice now I think
[16:01] this is important I'm not going to keep
[16:03] you much longer but I believe this is
[16:04] important because what did Rebecca do
[16:07] with that water
[16:09] what did she do with the water she took
[16:11] the water and watered the very Beast
[16:13] that was going to take her away from
[16:16] where she was to meet her Isaac
[16:20] Hallelujah
[16:22] isn't that wonderful she was sustaining
[16:25] the life of that power of that Beast
[16:28] brother Branham says power Beast
[16:30] represents power can you say man in
[16:33] other words she ain't gonna let that
[16:34] power die she wasn't going to let that
[16:36] Beast get so famished amen that it
[16:38] wasn't able to take her where she needed
[16:40] to go
[16:42] hello church amen and we are watering
[16:46] we've been led to the Waters of Life
[16:48] what are you going to do to the waters
[16:50] what are you going to do with that water
[16:52] you're going to water the power
[16:56] that's right now notice the prophets
[16:59] that Jesus wants a good drink of uh
[17:01] wants a drink of good old Pentecostal
[17:05] not some old Baptist dried up dead
[17:08] formalism
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:11] contaminated water he said Jesus is
[17:15] thirsty for a good old Pentecostal
[17:19] fresh drink of water
[17:22] can you say Amen who is able to give him
[17:25] that water
[17:26] those that is led to the water
[17:29] those that have been planted by the
[17:31] water
[17:32] those that have been predestinated to
[17:35] eternal life they've got eternal life
[17:37] they know what to do with that eternal
[17:39] life
[17:39] not just sit on a Pew like a not on a
[17:42] log and
[17:43] don't know what's going on and wish that
[17:45] they were out of the outer church and
[17:47] it's just boring and you know I guess we
[17:50] just go go to church for a little bit
[17:51] and then we'll go do our own thing get
[17:53] more excited at a baseball game at a
[17:56] tennis ball game or or at a soccer or
[17:58] football whatever you want to call it
[18:00] get more excited about fishing talking
[18:03] about the fishing talking about hunting
[18:05] more than we do about the Lord Jesus
[18:07] Christ
[18:07] [Applause]
[18:11] Jesus wants a drink of good old
[18:15] Pentecostal fresh water
[18:18] so then I guess when David is saying he
[18:21] leads me beside the Still Waters he was
[18:24] led to the good old Pentecostal
[18:26] freshwater
[18:32] he said see these denominational
[18:34] stagnant Waters is sickening to him
[18:38] now you think of it aren't you glad for
[18:39] his leading
[18:42] well some of us aren't you glad for his
[18:44] leading
[18:46] you could have been one of those that
[18:48] all you had was that a a stagnated
[18:50] denominational water to give him that
[18:53] would make him sick
[18:55] but you are one that's been LED
[18:58] to the waters
[19:02] and you say Amen
[19:04] now he says take the word of God and
[19:07] pull it you got sustaining strength
[19:10] so don't just I don't know if I can pull
[19:12] it no strong bride
[19:17] that's been inoculated from all these
[19:20] diseases and germs you've got sustaining
[19:23] strength in you pull that word out
[19:27] and start cutting through every demon of
[19:30] unbelief
[19:32] cut through all these Creeds and things
[19:34] till we can hit that place where there's
[19:37] fresh drink for him a real true worship
[19:42] a genuine heart
[19:44] [Applause]
[19:46] God have mercy
[19:48] where he can pour down his and make his
[19:51] word live in this day
[19:52] and he will have it
[19:56] he will have it is there someone going
[19:58] to give him fresh water tonight amen he
[20:01] will have it
[20:02] well I've been raised in this message
[20:04] all my life I don't see anything excited
[20:06] oh you got to get to the waters
[20:08] let him lead you to the water can you
[20:11] say Amen don't just be led to the church
[20:13] that's what the pro now that's what the
[20:15] prophet was saying too many people get
[20:17] him to the church instead of to Christ
[20:19] but there was a prophet in this day that
[20:22] would take a people to Christ to The
[20:25] Living Water to where they could take a
[20:28] drink and begin to pour water and praise
[20:31] him
[20:32] [Applause]
[20:33] [Music]
[20:34] yes sir
[20:36] see the bride today has what it takes
[20:41] to take that Water of Life and water the
[20:46] very power
[20:48] that's going to take her to her Isaac

[20:53] that's it praise God you say well I've
[20:57] been in the mess but I just don't know I

[21:13] and you keep watering her in power don't
[21:16] you just sit there like a a a log on a a
[21:20] knot on a log don't you just sit there
[21:22] amen and pretend like nothing is
[21:24] happening there is something happening
[21:27] there is a power and it's up to you to
[21:30] water it
[21:33] [Music]
[21:35] now listen
[21:36] brother Brown says the very power that
[21:39] we're watering now now how are you going
[21:41] to water it how do I water it by coming
[21:43] to church and just sitting there now you
[21:45] ain't doing nothing

[22:16] that we're watering now with praises
[22:18] everybody say Praises Thanksgiving
[22:22] Glory power might is the very Holy
[22:27] Spirit that'll pack us up to see Jesus
[22:30] someday and I tell you that power is
[22:33] here through the open book
[22:36] that's what John saw he saw himself in
[22:39] the book and he began to water he began
[22:42] to praise he began to glorify he knew
[22:45] that it was going to take him home
[22:48] come on
[22:50] could you imagine if God would lead you
[22:52] out in the middle of a desert with no
[22:53] water but God was good enough
[22:56] to Lead You By the Waters to bring you
[22:58] to the Waters of life that you could
[23:01] take a drink that means taking a drink
[23:03] of that Waters of life that spirit of
[23:05] God upon that word to make that word and
[23:07] you live amen but now you've got that
[23:10] water and you're watering it back
[23:12] watering the power with your praise
[23:16] [Applause]
[23:26] where does this water come from
[23:29] there was a little old lady that wanted
[23:30] to know where the water was
[23:35] John 4 5.
[23:38] then cometh he to the city of Samaria
[23:41] which is called psychar
[23:43] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[23:45] gave to his own son Joseph or to his son
[23:48] Joseph
[23:49] now Jacob's Well was there
[23:52] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[23:54] journey
[23:55] set thus on the well
[23:57] and it was about the sixth hour
[24:00] and there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[24:03] draw water
[24:04] and Jesus saith unto her give me to
[24:06] drink
[24:07] for his disciples were gone away unto
[24:09] the city to buy meat
[24:11] then set the woman of Samaria unto him
[24:15] how is it that thou being a Jew asks a
[24:18] drink of me
[24:20] which I'm a woman of Samaria
[24:22] for the Jews have no dealings with the
[24:24] Samaritans
[24:26] Jesus answered and said to her
[24:28] if thou knew us the gift of God
[24:31] and who it is
[24:33] that saith to thee give me a drink
[24:37] thou would ask of him
[24:40] and he would have given thee Living
[24:43] Water
[24:45] and you can imagine she's looking around
[24:47] for that water
[24:48] I don't see anything but my water
[24:51] on the water I got is to give you is
[24:53] that from this well of Jacobs and he's
[24:56] talking about living water
[24:59] now notice and the woman said to him sir
[25:03] thou has nothing to draw with
[25:06] and the well is deep
[25:08] from Winston hast thou that Living Water
[25:12] art thou greater than our father Jacob
[25:14] which he gave us the will and drink
[25:16] thereof of this well himself and his
[25:18] children and his cattle and Jesus
[25:21] answered and said unto her whosoever
[25:23] drinketh of this water shall thirst
[25:25] again
[25:26] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[25:28] I shall give him shall never thirst
[25:31] but the water that I shall give him
[25:33] shall be in him a well of water
[25:36] springing up into everlasting life
[25:39] and notice what the woman says there's
[25:41] something beginning to strike her heart
[25:43] and she sits her give me this water
[25:47] that I thirst not neither come hither to
[25:49] draw
[25:50] notice now Jesus is going to give her
[25:52] the water
[25:54] Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband
[25:57] and come hither
[25:59] and the woman answered and said I have
[26:02] no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast
[26:04] well said I have no husband for thou
[26:07] Hast had five husbands and he whom thou
[26:11] has now has is not thy husband and in
[26:14] that sentence thou truly and the woman
[26:16] said unto him sir
[26:19] sir I perceive that thou art a prophet
[26:23] oh she's starting to drink
[26:26] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[26:28] and you say that in Jerusalem is the
[26:30] place where men ought to worship
[26:33] Jesus saith unto her woman believed me
[26:36] the hour cometh when you shall neither
[26:39] in this mountain nor yet had Jerusalem
[26:41] worship the father
[26:42] ye worship ye know not what we we know
[26:46] we what we worship for salvation is of
[26:49] the Jews but the hour cometh now is when
[26:52] the true worshipers shall worship the
[26:54] father in spirit and in truth for the
[26:55] father's sake of such to worship Him God
[26:58] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[27:00] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[27:03] and the woman saith unto him I know that
[27:07] Messiah cometh
[27:10] which is called Christ and when he is
[27:13] come he will tell us all things
[27:17] that he's going to give her the water
[27:19] Jesus saith unto her eye that speak unto
[27:23] thee am he
[27:25] a oh my now let's look he the Fountain
[27:29] of Living Waters was talking to her and
[27:32] he proved it by the Messiah sign
[27:37] and you say Amen the water was right
[27:40] there and he proves it to her by the
[27:43] Messiah sign and gives her a drink
[27:47] ain't that right now now we're going to
[27:49] show you why she got how she got drink
[27:51] uh uh and now the prophet said when that
[27:54] predestinated seed struck that Water of
[27:56] Life she said sir you must be a prophet
[27:59] I know that when the Messiah cometh he
[28:01] will tell us all things so you knew that
[28:04] she took a drink of water of life
[28:06] because all of a sudden it's her ass
[28:09] came open and said sir
[28:12] that must be a prophet and we know when
[28:15] the Messiah cometh he will do these
[28:18] things now look at all the others that
[28:20] kept after when he would do them things
[28:21] they would say oh that's of the devil
[28:23] that's Beelzebub that's this that's that
[28:26] all right they didn't drink of the water
[28:28] of life but she took of the Water of
[28:30] Life
[28:32] and it opened her eyes
[28:34] can you say Amen now notice this living
[28:38] water is divine revelation
[28:42] that's it right there brother yeah
[28:43] everybody say Living Water
[28:45] is divine revelation
[28:48] now notice brother Brown says that woman
[28:51] left her pot water pot and ran into the
[28:54] city with a heart full of Revelation
[28:58] she took a drink and got a Heart full of
[29:01] Revelation
[29:04] oh my god well do you love him
[29:08] you know remember the time that Elijah
[29:11] went into the cave after preaching to
[29:12] the White House of his day
[29:16] he had preached and brother Brown said
[29:18] they had been rejected and so he
[29:19] preached the White House they rejected
[29:21] him and then he went off the scene the
[29:23] Lord took him off the scene his voice
[29:24] become quiet
[29:26] ain't that right
[29:27] brother Brown said God called him off
[29:29] the scene and said you've Elijah you've
[29:32] done major message known to all of
[29:33] Israel they know it now come up here in
[29:35] the wilderness get away from them
[29:37] separate yourself
[29:39] because I'm going to do something I'm
[29:41] going to show them what it is to turn my
[29:43] message down and what set in war famine
[29:47] and starvation
[29:49] then brother Branham says thus saith the
[29:52] Lord watch what's coming
[29:54] what's what's what's going to follow
[29:56] there was a famine there will be a
[29:59] famine oh maybe not for bread but for
[30:02] the hearing of the word of God and his
[30:04] truth all the churches will socialize
[30:07] and go right on in it just the same just
[30:10] like they've already been swallowed up
[30:11] with it ain't that right
[30:13] but notice when Elijah left he found a
[30:17] Hidden Spring
[30:19] all right up in the mountain found a
[30:21] little spring
[30:23] and brother Brandon says see he got some
[30:26] Water of Life
[30:27] Divine Revelations from God as he set up
[30:31] there under the power of God
[30:34] so when David is saying he leadeth me
[30:36] beside the Still Waters
[30:39] he was led to Divine Revelations
[30:44] can you say Amen
[30:45] and that's exactly where we've been LED
[30:48] in the evening time
[30:50] amen do you believe that sold them
[30:53] Revelation the revelations that that
[30:55] Elijah that was receiving was a little
[30:59] Hidden Spring that he was drinking from
[31:01] while the rest of them were famishing
[31:04] that's what the prophet said
[31:06] ain't that right I'm gonna close
[31:10] now he has led us
[31:12] by The Still Waters
[31:15] if you look at Revelation 6 6.
[31:20] John would write in I Heard a Voice in
[31:22] the midst of the four beasts say a
[31:24] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[31:26] measures of barley for a penny and see
[31:30] thou hurt not the oil and the wine man
[31:34] all right ain't that right
[31:36] we know what the wall is it's the Holy
[31:38] Spirit
[31:39] and what is the what is the wine it's
[31:42] stimulation of Revelation
[31:47] when that Revelation comes you get
[31:48] stimulated
[31:50] ain't that right and brother Brandon
[31:52] said oil and wine is always connected
[31:55] with Worship in the Bible
[31:58] and so what stimulates the church
[32:00] revelation
[32:02] ain't that right now that that word
[32:05] stimulate means to excite to activity
[32:08] sir growth to Quicken
[32:12] ain't that right
[32:13] now notice what brother Brown would tell
[32:15] us and I'm closing the wine is the water
[32:20] the Revelation that reveals that
[32:23] interpretation of the word
[32:27] which stimulates the believer
[32:33] so what are you watering the power with
[32:36] you got the water
[32:38] right
[32:39] and you're worshiping now there's a lot
[32:41] of people worshiping today but what did
[32:44] the prophet say their awards are being
[32:46] the devil Satan thinking they're
[32:49] worshiping God
[32:50] they're worshiping without revelation
[32:54] can you say Amen
[32:56] they're playing their music they've got
[32:58] their choirs they've got it all but it's
[33:00] all in a worship that they're thinking
[33:03] they're worshiping God but they're
[33:05] actually worshiping Satan
[33:07] [Music]
[33:08] can you say Amen but now is the time for
[33:12] King lamb worship foreign
[33:18] the bride
[33:20] she has been eating off of the open book
[33:24] she has been partaking of the water of
[33:27] Revelation amen
[33:31] and with that water she is worshiping
[33:34] and watering
[33:38] the very power
[33:40] the very power that's going to take her
[33:43] home
[33:45] well do you love it
[33:47] if there's ever a people
[33:50] whose worship means something to God
[33:52] it's this bride
[33:54] it's the people that believe this
[33:57] message the people that's got a
[33:59] revelation of this message
[34:02] it don't mean that you know it all
[34:04] I don't understand all this message but
[34:06] all I know that Revelation that I have
[34:08] come is from God
[34:09] [Applause]
[34:11] well do you love him
[34:13] my my mind if the musicians will come
[34:17] taking that water
[34:19] that we have received the Water of Life
[34:22] that's what it is
[34:24] it's a fountain of life it's Waters of
[34:27] life
[34:28] a man that has been made known to us
[34:32] through the message of this hour
[34:35] and the same sign that Jesus performed
[34:38] for that woman at the well
[34:41] he's done it again today
[34:43] and brother Bradham said it's more of a
[34:46] supernatural act than a man was getting
[34:48] out of the wheelchair
[34:50] he said because a man that gets out of
[34:52] that wheelchair he could get rise up on
[34:54] emotions
[34:56] they said there ain't no emotion
[34:58] that can do this
[35:00] there ain't no psychologists that could
[35:03] do this
[35:04] there ain't no soothsayer that could do
[35:07] this
[35:08] and we all have to say this is God
[35:11] this is God
[35:13] can you say bad
[35:15] do you love him
[35:16] aren't you glad you've been LED
[35:19] to the Green Pastures
[35:21] The Still Waters
[35:23] how about we water the word tonight
[35:26] let's lift our hands unto the Lord and
[35:28] just worship Him

[35:49] been opened we've got a bright future I

[36:05] Revelation that you're one of them that

[36:13] world don't know what to do they they
