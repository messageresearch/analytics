[28:26] I come up here a lot of times and want
[28:28] to give a testimony and then I always
[28:29] get nervous and forget. So while I
[28:31] remember there's two things I just want
[28:33] to thank the Lord for. I had sent this
[28:36] message out to the sisters, but my
[28:38] brother is a policeman in Dallas area
[28:42] and the other day someone had ran a red
[28:44] light and he said he, you know, he just
[28:48] saw out of the corner of his eye enough
[28:49] time to slam on the brakes, but it was
[28:51] still close enough. It hit the front of
[28:54] his car and tore it up. And
[28:57] um I'm sure it could have been a lot
[28:59] worse, but all he had was a cut on his
[29:00] finger and just bumped his head and he
[29:04] went right back to work after they
[29:05] cleared him. So just thank the Lord for
[29:07] sparing his life. And
[29:11] I have had um an umbilical hernia for a
[29:14] while and sometimes it was given me a
[29:18] lot of pain um with just a lot of issues
[29:22] in um anyway back in um March I think
[29:27] whenever we went to Arizona the meeting
[29:29] there I went up for prayer and um it's
[29:33] still physically there in the sense of
[29:35] seeing it but I believe it's completely
[29:37] healed because had no more pain, no more
[29:39] issues out of it. So, that's gone and I
[29:42] know the rest is going to follow. And I
[29:43] just want to thank the Lord for that.
[29:49] There's no name Jesus.
[29:55] I have tasted. I have seen
[30:01] nothing better than his presence.
[30:07] a friend when I'm in need.
[30:13] [Music]
[30:15] There's no sweeter name than Jesus.
[30:20] [Music]
[30:21] He's the savior of my soul.
[30:28] And by his blood, I am forgiven.
[30:33] He calls me now his own.
[30:39] And I will declare
[30:43] his goodness.
[30:46] I will declare
[30:49] his love.
[30:52] My life will testify
[30:56] forever.

[31:05] All that he is and what he's done.
[31:12] [Music]
[31:14] There's no greater name than Jesus.
[31:18] [Music]

[31:32] and heaven glorifies

[31:37] and I will declare
[31:42] his goodness.

[39:53] believe?
[39:55] Amen. That Amen. It's not just an
[39:58] intellectual faith, but it's the God's
[40:01] own faith working through us.
[40:04] God believing his own word. Amen. And
[40:07] we're glad for that. Amen. And apologize
[40:11] for the um the AC being out, but uh uh
[40:17] it's just backslid. So, you pray for it
[40:20] and get it working.
[40:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um,
[40:28] if you have your Bibles, we're going to
[40:31] just go right on into the word. Um,
[40:34] going to go to two places. First of all,
[40:36] Psalms 107.
[40:38] We read this last
[40:40] um,
[40:42] Sunday. And it's good to have Brother
[40:44] Amos and Sister Lisa back with us. and
[40:47] trust they had a good service and all.
[40:50] And um brother Andrew asked me to greet
[40:54] you all. He's there in Colorado
[40:57] ministering uh this evening. And so uh
[41:01] we want to keep him in our prayer.
[41:04] And um brother Josh uh Bennett
[41:08] uh will be having his meeting uh next
[41:12] week. So, actually be a week from
[41:14] tomorrow, next Thursday through Sunday.
[41:19] And so, um, I think Brother Wayne Lawson
[41:23] and Brother Matthew McGary will be
[41:26] ministering. And so, if you're able to
[41:28] make it, I know you'll be blessed and
[41:30] I'm sure you'll be a blessing to them as
[41:32] well. So, um, uh, again, June 19th
[41:37] through the 22nd.
[41:39] Amen. And um also uh brother Andy
[41:44] Schuler, I think that's how you'd say
[41:46] his last name, uh from Tucson. He's a a
[41:50] minister there with brother Doug Baker.
[41:53] Uh they're coming through. Uh he and his
[41:57] family um on July 13th on a Sunday. And
[42:02] so he'll be ministering for us at that
[42:05] time. And um so we want to keep that in
[42:09] mind and um I'm sure you'll be blessed
[42:13] uh by his ministry.
[42:15] And um then also uh a brother from
[42:18] Africa, Brother Jeffrey Johnson. I'd met
[42:21] him a few years back and and um he um
[42:26] just a real real humble brother. loves
[42:30] the message and um we have actually
[42:34] prayed for his wife uh
[42:37] a little while back um going through a
[42:40] lot of things. But this this brother is
[42:42] just constantly doing things u for the
[42:46] Lord and um going in places that are
[42:50] very dangerous and um uh going places
[42:55] where probably people don't go. but he's
[42:57] starting churches and uh just a a real
[43:01] good brother and loves the message. But
[43:04] he had text me today and said he's going
[43:07] to be coming through and uh wanted to
[43:10] stop by on July 2nd on a Wednesday. And
[43:14] so um uh we want to keep that in mind
[43:17] and and I'm sure we'll be blessed uh by
[43:20] his ministry and and um uh I'm sure
[43:24] you'll you'll enjoy the brother. And so
[43:27] uh anyways, we'll keep reminding you on
[43:29] these dates, but um uh it's it's good
[43:33] that God's got a bride around uh the
[43:37] world. Amen. Is believing the message.
[43:40] Amen. And so before we go into the word,
[43:43] let's just bow our heads and and talk to
[43:46] the Lord. Father,
[43:49] Lord, we're just so thankful that we can
[43:52] bask in your presence
[43:54] and knowing, Lord, that um you've got
[43:57] our lives in your hands. You've you've
[44:00] got our future secure.
[44:03] And Lord, uh we're just at rest in that.
[44:06] And we're just asking now that you would
[44:08] move tonight. And Lord, may what words
[44:12] we would have to say be edifying and be
[44:16] uh uh something that would help your
[44:19] people, Father, for we want to draw
[44:22] closer to you. And Lord, we want to be
[44:25] ready for that soon event that is
[44:30] uh imminent, Lord. and we just love you
[44:34] and we thank you for the promises in
[44:37] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[44:40] Psalms 107:19,
[44:43] we'll start. Then they cry unto the Lord
[44:47] in their trouble, and he saveth them out
[44:50] of their distresses. He sent his word
[44:53] and healed them and delivered them from
[44:56] their destructions.
[44:58] And then uh Romans the 4th chapter
[45:04] uh we're going to
[45:07] read the
[45:09] few verses here starting at the first
[45:11] verse
[45:13] Romans 4 and 1.
[45:16] It says, "What shall we say then that
[45:18] Abraham our father as pertaining to the
[45:20] flesh hath found? For if Abraham were
[45:23] justified by works, he hath whereof to
[45:26] glory, but not before God. For what
[45:29] saith the scripture, Abraham believed
[45:31] God, and it was counted unto him for
[45:33] righteousness?
[45:35] Now to him that workketh is the reward
[45:37] not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But
[45:40] to him that workketh not, but believeth
[45:43] on him that justifieth the ungodly, his
[45:46] faith is counted for righteousness.
[45:49] Even as David also describeth the
[45:51] blessedness of the man unto whom God
[45:54] imputth righteousness without works,
[45:57] saying, "Blessed are they uh whose
[46:00] iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
[46:02] are covered. Blessed is the man to whom
[46:05] the Lord will not impute sin." Cometh
[46:09] this blessedness then upon the
[46:11] circumcision only, or upon the
[46:13] uncircumcision also. For we say that
[46:17] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[46:19] righteousness. How was it then reckoned?
[46:22] When he was in circumcision or in
[46:25] uncircumcision?
[46:26] Not in circumcision, but in
[46:29] uncircumcision.
[46:31] And he received the sign of
[46:32] circumcision, a seal of the
[46:34] righteousness of the faith, which he had
[46:37] yet, being uncircumcised,
[46:40] that he might be the father of all them
[46:44] that believe. though they be not
[46:46] circumcised, that righteousness might be
[46:49] imputed unto them also. That and the
[46:52] father of circumcision to them who are
[46:55] not of the uh circumcision only uh but
[47:00] who also walk in the steps of that faith
[47:03] of our father Abraham which he had being
[47:07] yet uncircumcised.
[47:09] Amen. You can have your seats.
[47:13] Amen.
[47:15] And um
[47:18] so um I want to uh maybe if I were to
[47:22] use a title would be nursing off the
[47:25] promises
[47:26] by faith. And um of course we don't know
[47:30] too much about Abraham
[47:33] uh uh before God uh came in to his life
[47:37] came into the picture. I I I'm sure that
[47:40] you could read history and it could kind
[47:43] of give you an idea historical uh point
[47:46] of view of of the land and the the uh uh
[47:50] u ancestry or whatever that Abraham came
[47:54] out of. But uh we we know that he was
[47:57] living in the land of we know that he
[48:00] was an idoltor. He was basically a
[48:04] heathen and uh pagan and and he was just
[48:08] an ordinary man. A man with no talents.
[48:11] A man that you know um um you know
[48:15] probably didn't have much fame. I don't
[48:17] know but u uh anyways uh but uh so so we
[48:23] don't know much about him you know other
[48:26] than that uh but you know uh what a man
[48:30] does in his past really doesn't matter
[48:34] uh too much uh before God gets a hold of
[48:39] him you know uh you know that's neither
[48:43] here or there and apparently God didn't
[48:45] see it just really important for us to
[48:48] know all about Abraham. Uh because when
[48:51] a God gets a hold of a man, he he erases
[48:54] his past anyways.
[48:57] And and so uh and his new life begins.
[49:01] And so um of course, God is the only one
[49:05] that can change a person and make him
[49:07] new and uh start him on a new path. And
[49:12] and so we we must never consider a man
[49:17] to be beyond hope or beyond help. Um
[49:22] because we know that God can save the
[49:24] vilest sinner. Um uh change their life
[49:29] um to where their past is just seems to
[49:32] be maybe uh what you'd call a nightmare
[49:35] that they had or or whatever. But it was
[49:38] God who came to Abraham. And it wasn't
[49:42] Abraham that came to God. Abraham wasn't
[49:45] seeking God. Abraham wasn't desiring
[49:48] God. Abraham wasn't, you know, uh um uh
[49:54] praying to God and asking for his help
[49:56] or anything like that. And and and you
[49:59] know, that's always the case. Amen. That
[50:02] we we didn't seek God. Amen. But God
[50:05] sought us. God God wasn't the one that
[50:08] was lost. We were the one that was lost.
[50:11] And so, uh, uh, John 15:16, Jesus said,
[50:15] "You've not chosen me, but I have chosen
[50:18] you." Before we even knew, before we
[50:20] were even aware, we had already been
[50:23] chosen. And he says, "I've chosen you
[50:27] and ordained you that you should go and
[50:28] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[50:31] should remain and that whatever you
[50:34] shall ask of the father in my name, he
[50:36] may give it to you." And of course, Paul
[50:38] would say in Ephesians 1 that uh uh for
[50:42] according as he has chosen us in him
[50:45] before the foundation of the world that
[50:47] we should be holy without blame before
[50:49] him in love having predestinated us unto
[50:52] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[50:55] to himself according to the good
[50:57] pleasure of his will. So, so the
[51:00] choosing was sovereignly done by God. uh
[51:04] nobody to force him to do these things
[51:06] and and all these things. So we are
[51:10] Christians simply because God took
[51:12] action first. Amen. We we did not uh
[51:16] bargain with God. We didn't deserve God.
[51:20] Abraham didn't deserve God. Uh and and
[51:23] all these things. It was God came to
[51:26] him, called him out, and then gave him a
[51:30] promise. Amen. God called Abraham.
[51:34] Amen. Called him out, elected him, and
[51:37] then gives him a promise. And And so
[51:40] there was nothing that Abraham could do.
[51:43] Uh it was just done. It was just that
[51:46] way. But God's word is a promise. You
[51:49] believe that? God's word is is is a
[51:53] promise simply because God cannot lie.
[51:58] Whatever God says, he's going to make
[52:00] come to pass. That's that's just the way
[52:03] it is. It's impossible for God to lie.
[52:06] So, he has to bring his word to pass.
[52:10] Therefore, we can rest in God's word.
[52:13] And I I think that's what God wants us
[52:15] to do is just rest in in his his word.
[52:19] Amen. And and not try to understand him
[52:23] per se, but just just rest in it. And
[52:26] and so, you know, people may think that
[52:28] God can do anything he wants to and and
[52:31] you know, uh uh think, man, if I was
[52:34] God, I would just do all kinds of things
[52:36] and but but God cannot do anything he
[52:40] wants to because he's obligated to his
[52:43] word. Amen. And his word, amen, is only
[52:47] an expression of his thoughts. So, so he
[52:50] just can't do anything that he wants to
[52:53] do. uh he cannot act contrary to his
[52:56] word. He cannot talk contrary to his
[53:00] word. He cannot uh speak anything
[53:03] contrary any language any word any
[53:06] action contrary to what he has already
[53:09] spoken. Uh he cannot do that. And and
[53:12] and now that's that makes us secure. If
[53:15] we could really understand that. Abraham
[53:18] began to understand just how secure he
[53:21] was when he began to realize how
[53:24] faithful God really is. See, God's
[53:27] faithful to his word. God cannot lie.
[53:30] God cannot make mistakes. God cannot uh
[53:33] uh retract his his word. He cannot he
[53:36] cannot go contrary. So if his word says
[53:39] he loves you, then he cannot hate you.
[53:43] Amen. and and and to think all of this
[53:46] was settled before you ever was born.
[53:49] Ain't a ain't that right? So So if he
[53:52] showed his love to you once, then he
[53:55] cannot retract that in in any way
[53:58] because God is is faithful to his
[54:01] promise. So if if his word says that he
[54:04] came to save you, then you can know
[54:06] beyond a shadow of a doubt that that he
[54:09] never can come, never will come to
[54:12] destroy you. Amen. He's He came to save
[54:16] you and and that's his intent. Can you
[54:19] say amen? He He cannot speak good of you
[54:23] uh uh today and then a month later in
[54:25] your failures and in your weaknesses or
[54:28] in your in your uh uh when you're just
[54:31] all down and and got the blues or
[54:34] whatever and and he cannot turn around
[54:36] and speak evil of you. See, so if he
[54:39] spoke good of you, Amen. then then that
[54:42] will always remain no matter what. And
[54:46] and so uh uh God cannot work against
[54:49] himself. And as we know, he is the word.
[54:52] Ain't that right? The word is God. The
[54:55] word was God. The word is God. See? And
[54:57] so, Brother Brandham says when you're
[54:59] really saved, God don't save you here
[55:02] and know he's going to lose you there.
[55:04] If he did, he's not the infinite God.
[55:07] He's defeating his own purpose. He can't
[55:09] do that. If you're saved, you're saved.
[55:12] If you're not, you're not. Can you say
[55:14] amen? So, so there is no such thing as
[55:17] straddling on the fence. And God, help
[55:19] us to to really get get confident in in
[55:23] in the work that God has done and and
[55:27] confident in his promises. Amen. You
[55:29] see, God's word is an expression of his
[55:33] attitude. It's it's an expression of his
[55:36] love. It's an expression of his his
[55:39] devotion. Uh uh uh expression of his
[55:43] will. And so when God gave the promise
[55:46] to Abraham, it wasn't just throwing it
[55:48] out there to entice him. God God was
[55:52] expressing his desire toward Abraham by
[55:55] giving him the promise. God was
[55:57] expressing his attitude and his will to
[56:01] Abraham uh uh in that uh he was going to
[56:04] bless him. If he didn't intend to bless
[56:07] him, he would have never gave him the
[56:08] promise that he would bless him. If he
[56:11] didn't really intend to give him the
[56:13] son, then he wouldn't have promised to
[56:15] give him the son. Amen. So, so when God
[56:18] promises something, you can you can see
[56:20] God's intent in his promises. You you
[56:24] can see God's attitude and motive and
[56:27] objective and his will in his promises.
[56:31] Ain't that right? See, so God God
[56:34] wouldn't have called Abraham and elected
[56:36] him if he wasn't interested in him. See,
[56:40] God doesn't do things grudgingly. We We
[56:43] may do things grudgingly, but God will
[56:45] never give a promise grudgingly. He He
[56:48] would never save you grudgingly. He
[56:50] never he never heals anyone grudgingly.
[56:54] You know, uh he didn't just grudgingly
[56:57] send his son to die for us. I I believe
[57:00] that when when he uh uh uh had had the
[57:04] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[57:06] world, there must have been an eagerness
[57:08] in his heart, amen, to know that when
[57:11] all this plan of redemption is done,
[57:13] he's actually going to have redeemed
[57:16] subjects, amen, and be able to walk with
[57:18] him and talk with him and they're going
[57:20] to trust him and and believe him and and
[57:23] they're going to accept what he says.
[57:25] And it must have been an eagerness uh to
[57:28] God. Amen. instead of, "Oh, I guess I'll
[57:30] do it," you know. No, no. It It was It
[57:33] was an eagerness. Amen. So, he didn't
[57:36] grudgingly promise to heal our body or
[57:38] to save our soul. Everything that God
[57:41] has done for you, he does it with
[57:43] eagerness. Ain't that right? And and not
[57:46] only that, the prophet said he wants to
[57:48] fuel you with the Holy Ghost more than
[57:49] you want it. He wants to heal you more
[57:52] than you want it. He wants to everything
[57:54] that you desire of God, he wants it a
[57:57] thousand times more than what you would
[57:59] want. Amen. See, and so if if he didn't
[58:03] want that, then he wouldn't have he
[58:05] wouldn't have given the promises. He he
[58:07] wouldn't have ordained these things. But
[58:09] see, God obligated himself to Abraham uh
[58:13] uh when he gave the promise to Abraham.
[58:16] Amen. God knowing that that uh uh uh
[58:20] Abraham couldn't do it uh uh and and and
[58:24] so he he he uh um uh obligated himself
[58:28] and and we know why God would do that.
[58:31] It was simply an act of grace. It was
[58:33] the desire of God. It was the longing of
[58:36] God. It it was all on God's part.
[58:40] Abraham was just the recipient of it.
[58:43] Amen. the recip. Aren't you glad that
[58:45] you're just the recipient of God's
[58:48] blessings? You don't deserve it. You
[58:50] there there's nothing that you deserve
[58:52] of this. You couldn't sit down at the
[58:54] bargaining table with God, but God so
[58:57] loved you that he secured your end. And
[59:00] and and that to me that he he obligated
[59:04] himself to us when he gave us the
[59:06] promise. Can you say amen? So the
[59:09] promise as we know it's an act of grace
[59:12] and it was given to Abraham
[59:15] unconditionally
[59:16] and and this word unconditional it means
[59:19] not conditional not determined by
[59:22] someone or something else and not
[59:24] restricted by reservation. So in other
[59:28] words Abraham if you'll do this then I'm
[59:30] going to do this and and it all depends
[59:32] how you handle this and all depends on
[59:34] what you do and then if you'll do this
[59:36] right then I will come and do this. No,
[59:38] no, it it wasn't at all that at all. And
[59:41] and so, Brother Brham says God didn't
[59:43] say to Abraham, "Well, if you'll do this
[59:46] and if you'll do that." He just said,
[59:47] "Abraham, I've already done it. It ain't
[59:50] nothing you've got to do. I've done it
[59:54] myself." See, so God's already taken
[59:56] care of it. Amen. That's why he could
[59:59] die. Amen. For us and and and and say,
[1:00:02] "It is finished way before we got here."
[1:00:05] Because the covenant isn't based upon
[1:00:07] what I do, what you do, what you don't
[1:00:09] do. It's just simply based on what he's
[1:00:12] promised and what he has accomplished in
[1:00:14] himself. Ain't that right? God knew that
[1:00:17] he had the ability, amen, to save you.
[1:00:20] He knew he had the ability to keep you.
[1:00:23] He knew that he had the ability to to to
[1:00:26] to
[1:00:28] make that promise live. Amen. For
[1:00:30] Abraham, he knew that. He knew all about
[1:00:33] Abraham. He knew he was a shyer. He knew
[1:00:36] that there was uh something within him
[1:00:38] that would maybe when he get in trouble,
[1:00:40] he would lie. Amen. These things wasn't
[1:00:42] a surprise to God. Satan, I mean, God
[1:00:45] already knew these things. And and we
[1:00:47] see that it come out when Abraham got in
[1:00:49] trouble. Amen. It looked like he was
[1:00:51] going to be uh killed. Amen. He lied.
[1:00:54] Amen. He backslid. And he he he he was
[1:00:58] something else. Ain't that right? See,
[1:01:00] and he gave up his own life. Amen. for
[1:01:02] his own life, you know, and and and uh
[1:01:05] all these things. And yet God knew that,
[1:01:08] but yet God gave the promise to him
[1:01:11] anyways. Now, you think of that. See,
[1:01:14] and so uh uh but God wanted Abraham to
[1:01:17] understand, Abraham, you're secure
[1:01:20] because I'm doing it, not you. Can you
[1:01:22] say amen? So, see, God knows uh uh that
[1:01:26] that man will break his promise. Amen.
[1:01:29] So Abraham had nothing uh not one thing
[1:01:32] to do with the promise, amen, that God
[1:01:35] had given him. Amen. And and so the
[1:01:38] prophet said, "See, so to give the
[1:01:40] assurance that the promise would not
[1:01:42] fail. You may fail." Abraham failed, but
[1:01:46] to make sure to give that assurance that
[1:01:49] the promise would not fail, God made the
[1:01:53] covenant with himself. Ain't that right?
[1:01:56] And we all know that that covenant and
[1:01:58] how that God put Abraham to sleep and to
[1:02:01] let him know you ain't got nothing to do
[1:02:03] with it. You're out of this thing. I'm
[1:02:05] going to make that covenant. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:08] That's right. You can't be there to tell
[1:02:09] me how it's done. You can't be there to
[1:02:12] tell me whatever. Amen. I'm doing it on
[1:02:14] my own. Ain't that right? So, the
[1:02:16] promise was sovereignly given to Abraham
[1:02:20] without him having to do one thing.
[1:02:22] Amen. And because we are the children of
[1:02:25] Abraham, well then we have been given
[1:02:28] that same promise. Amen. And it has been
[1:02:31] given to us the same way. Unconditional.
[1:02:35] Amen. I'm so glad for that that it's
[1:02:38] unconditional. Our sa salvation, it
[1:02:41] began with God. It will end with God.
[1:02:43] Everything about us, Amen. that started
[1:02:46] from God, it will end with God. Amen.
[1:02:50] It's not that God begins it and then we
[1:02:52] finish it. You can't finish it. There's
[1:02:54] not one thing that you could do to
[1:02:57] finish the promise. God will finish it
[1:02:59] in you. Ain't that right? Amen. Even
[1:03:02] Philippians uh uh 16, Paul would say,
[1:03:05] "Being confident of this very thing,
[1:03:08] that he which began hath began a good
[1:03:10] work in you will perform it until the
[1:03:13] day of Jesus Christ." Ain't that right?
[1:03:16] Now you know people uh take this and I
[1:03:18] know this is simple but they they they
[1:03:21] seem to take this that that we can do
[1:03:23] anything that we want. It gives us the
[1:03:25] license and all that being that the
[1:03:27] covenant is unconditional and and you
[1:03:29] know I I say this we've said it before
[1:03:32] Christians always do what they want just
[1:03:35] as much as the sinner does what they
[1:03:37] want to do. Sinners always do what they
[1:03:40] want to do. Christians always do what
[1:03:42] they want to do. Amen. and and but
[1:03:44] define the Christian. A Christian is one
[1:03:47] that's got been saved and got the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost and and and got the life of Christ
[1:03:52] living within them. Ain't that right?
[1:03:54] But we don't serve God by going by being
[1:03:57] afraid of going to hell. And and we do
[1:04:00] not serve God. Wouldn't God if you're if
[1:04:02] you're serving God that way, then then
[1:04:04] you you've you're not you're not seeing
[1:04:07] God. You're in the way that you should
[1:04:09] see him. Amen. You're serving him
[1:04:11] actually the wrong way. and it ain't
[1:04:13] going to help you in the end. See, you
[1:04:15] you you got to have confidence in God.
[1:04:18] Amen. So, you can't serve God, Amen, by
[1:04:22] being afraid of him sending you to hell
[1:04:24] at at the at the end of the road. And
[1:04:27] and God doesn't want us being afraid of
[1:04:29] him. God doesn't want us serving this in
[1:04:32] this Christian life, being filled with
[1:04:35] dread, being scared to death, and
[1:04:37] wondering if and and uh we're going to
[1:04:40] make it and all these things. It's just
[1:04:42] like uh you know uh us guys don't live
[1:04:45] true to our wives uh because we're
[1:04:47] afraid that they're going to they
[1:04:48] divorce us. You know I'm not afraid of
[1:04:51] my wife divorcing me. See? Amen. But
[1:04:54] believers, you know, uh don't serve God
[1:04:57] by being afraid of him and afraid of
[1:04:59] what he will do. So So we're free.
[1:05:01] Everybody say we're free. We're free to
[1:05:04] do whatever we want to do. Amen. And and
[1:05:07] that's that's the that's the beauty.
[1:05:10] Christians. Now, Christians have no
[1:05:12] desire to dress like the world. How many
[1:05:14] believes that? Amen. Christians just
[1:05:16] don't have that desire. They have no
[1:05:17] desire to act like the world. They they
[1:05:20] have no desire to to conform themselves
[1:05:23] uh uh to the world. They they have no
[1:05:25] desire. Amen. Uh uh to to to get
[1:05:29] involved in in the things of the
[1:05:31] pleasures of life. And like like Paul
[1:05:33] would say, "Lay aside every weight and
[1:05:36] sin that so easily beset you." Well,
[1:05:38] will Christians listen to that and say,
[1:05:40] "Yes, that's me. That's what I want to
[1:05:42] do." They have no desire for the
[1:05:44] television. They have no desire to get
[1:05:46] wrapped up in worldly uh uh movies and
[1:05:49] and uh uh the rock and roll and and and
[1:05:52] you you know all these things. See,
[1:05:54] amen. Uh first Peter 2:11 says, "Dearly
[1:05:58] beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
[1:06:00] pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lust,
[1:06:03] which war against the soul." Ain't that
[1:06:06] right? 1 Thessalonians 4:3, for this is
[1:06:09] the will of God, even your
[1:06:10] sanctification, that you should abstain
[1:06:12] from fornication, uh uh that every one
[1:06:15] of you should know how to possess his
[1:06:17] vessel in sanctification and honor.
[1:06:19] First Thessalonians 5:22, abstain from
[1:06:22] all appearance of evil. Ain't that
[1:06:25] right? See, well, these scriptures,
[1:06:27] believe it or not, are not written for
[1:06:28] the unbelievers. They're actually
[1:06:31] written for the believer. See? Amen.
[1:06:34] They they weren't they weren't written
[1:06:36] to put people under law, you know, to
[1:06:39] where it makes church people, oh, I just
[1:06:41] so hard. It's just so hard living a
[1:06:44] Christian life. Well, why is it hard?
[1:06:46] Well, uh because I'd like to do those
[1:06:48] things, but I I just don't know. Well,
[1:06:51] see th that if if we look at these as
[1:06:54] written to put us under a law, then then
[1:06:58] you you you're not you're not right yet.
[1:07:01] You're you're not there. Amen. where you
[1:07:03] need to be. Ain't that right? Amen. See,
[1:07:06] if you try to make a sinner to live
[1:07:08] these these scriptures, he's going to be
[1:07:10] condemned all the time. It It's going to
[1:07:13] be like putting him uh the lion in the
[1:07:15] zoo and and and putting all these kinds
[1:07:18] of bars around him. Well, no matter what
[1:07:20] you do, he's still a lion. He's still
[1:07:23] got that nature within him. He's still a
[1:07:25] beast. Ain't that right? So, so why
[1:07:27] would why would God put scriptures in
[1:07:30] there? Amen. uh for the sinner if if he
[1:07:34] knows that that sinner's a wild by
[1:07:36] nature, his his nature's immunity
[1:07:38] against God cannot come subject to the
[1:07:40] law of God and and all of these things.
[1:07:43] Well, it it wasn't written for the
[1:07:45] sinner. Yeah, the sinner is going to be
[1:07:47] judged by these things as as we know.
[1:07:50] Amen. But but God doesn't write
[1:07:52] scriptures for Christians to be
[1:07:53] miserable and sinners to come to the
[1:07:56] church and be miserable, too. Amen. I I
[1:07:59] just don't believe that. But these
[1:08:01] scriptures were written to teach the
[1:08:03] believer what to do and what not to do
[1:08:06] because believers want to know how to
[1:08:09] please God. How many wants to please
[1:08:10] God? Amen. Well, could you imagine if if
[1:08:14] we know that God doesn't like sinful
[1:08:16] things and unholy things and he doesn't
[1:08:18] like movies that where women and men are
[1:08:21] kissing and they're not even married and
[1:08:23] and and yet we didn't know them things.
[1:08:25] See, and and and women undressing and
[1:08:29] they're using the Lord's name in vain
[1:08:31] and and mockering God and Christianity
[1:08:33] and all these things and we're sitting
[1:08:35] there just laughing at it and enjoying
[1:08:37] it and all these things and we don't
[1:08:39] know how to please God. See? Amen. But
[1:08:42] then we find, amen, that God would put
[1:08:45] scriptures and says, "Now, this is the
[1:08:46] way to please me. This is the way I want
[1:08:48] you to walk. This is the way." But
[1:08:50] there's something in here that says,
[1:08:52] "God, I want to walk like that. God, I
[1:08:55] want to be pure like that. God, I I want
[1:08:58] to be holy. Whatever pleases you, I it
[1:09:00] pleases me. Ain't that right? It's just
[1:09:02] we want to please our wives and they
[1:09:04] want to please us and it because it's a
[1:09:06] love relationship. So God never put
[1:09:08] scriptures in there for us to be so beat
[1:09:11] down and and even for the the preacher
[1:09:13] to beat people up over either you want
[1:09:16] to do it or you don't want to do it.
[1:09:18] Ain't that right? Amen. See, and and so
[1:09:20] but the word is an excitement to us.
[1:09:23] Amen. See, so the Christian see has has
[1:09:27] has had a nature change. A Christian
[1:09:29] lady doesn't want to wear wear pants. A
[1:09:31] Christian lady doesn't want to doesn't
[1:09:33] want to wear the makeup. Once they know
[1:09:35] that God doesn't like them things, they
[1:09:38] don't want to do that. Ain't that right?
[1:09:40] Now, we've all been there. We've all
[1:09:41] done things that wasn't godly. And and
[1:09:43] and maybe we just didn't know. Amen. Uh
[1:09:46] uh we didn't know until a preacher come
[1:09:48] along and started using these uh the
[1:09:51] scriptures and it it's just like you
[1:09:53] know in Pentecost we didn't have a lot
[1:09:55] of things uh uh we didn't know that that
[1:09:58] sex glands was in the lips and we didn't
[1:10:00] know uh uh uh you know u a lot of things
[1:10:04] that brother Brandham taught we just
[1:10:06] didn't know those things but then when
[1:10:08] we come into the message of the hour it
[1:10:10] was like an eye openener oh wow amen you
[1:10:14] know uh uh then we started pattern our
[1:10:16] lives after what we've been hearing
[1:10:18] because we realize it's God's word. It
[1:10:21] wasn't condemnation. It wasn't
[1:10:23] something, oh, I just don't think I'm
[1:10:25] going to teach my kids that and I just
[1:10:26] don't think I'm going to do that. Bless
[1:10:28] God. I dare him to say something about
[1:10:30] me. You know, it's not that at all. We
[1:10:32] want to please God because there's been
[1:10:34] a nature change. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:10:38] A a Christian woman doesn't want to
[1:10:39] dress in modest and she has no desire to
[1:10:42] dress in a way where men that would
[1:10:44] cause men to lust after her. A Christian
[1:10:47] man has no desire to to to be in the
[1:10:50] company of immodest women and uh uh uh
[1:10:54] to to where and I know you got to work
[1:10:56] and all these things. Amen. But but
[1:10:58] there there's you you wouldn't want to
[1:11:00] be in a in a room with a woman. Well,
[1:11:02] period. you wouldn't want to be, but you
[1:11:04] wouldn't want to put yourself in a
[1:11:05] situation where there's an immodest
[1:11:07] woman there and and and these things
[1:11:09] there. There's just something about it
[1:11:12] that that you say, "No, I I don't want
[1:11:14] to go that way. I ain't going to go to
[1:11:15] the beach." Amen. Where all these half-
[1:11:17] naked women are out there. You
[1:11:19] understand what I'm saying? Amen. We'll
[1:11:20] go sometime when they ain't there. You
[1:11:22] know what I mean? Amen. But see, because
[1:11:25] we want to live godly. Amen. We we we
[1:11:28] want to live pure. We we want to keep
[1:11:30] all that temptations down as best we
[1:11:32] can. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:11:34] See, and and so uh uh because the desire
[1:11:38] ain't there. It ain't because the
[1:11:39] preacher is is is we're afraid to get to
[1:11:42] church and preacher find out we've done
[1:11:43] something and he going to blast us and
[1:11:46] all these things. Well, if that's the
[1:11:47] relationship, I don't want to serve God.
[1:11:49] I don't want to serve your God and and
[1:11:51] and all these things. That's not the way
[1:11:53] we do things. That's not the way God
[1:11:55] wants it. Yes, we have to be corrected.
[1:11:57] Yes. But there's something down inside
[1:11:59] that says, "Yes, Lord. That's what I
[1:12:01] want to be." Can you say amen? See, so
[1:12:04] we find that we have no desire, amen, to
[1:12:07] to do those things. We have one desire,
[1:12:10] and that's to please God. And every true
[1:12:12] Christian has the desire to be
[1:12:15] transformed. How many wants to be
[1:12:16] transformed? Amen. We hear the we we
[1:12:19] read the scripture. Amen. Be not
[1:12:21] conformed to this world. Well, that's
[1:12:23] not putting anyone under law. There's
[1:12:25] going to be people that don't want to
[1:12:26] listen to it. And God says, "Okay, well,
[1:12:28] go ahead. Do you what you want to do,
[1:12:30] that's just fine. But there's people
[1:12:31] that says, "God, if you don't want me to
[1:12:33] be conformed to the world, then help me
[1:12:36] watch out what I'm looking at, what I'm
[1:12:38] listening to, what I'm hanging around,
[1:12:41] what I'm enjoying, what I'm
[1:12:43] fellowshipping with. Help me. I don't
[1:12:45] want to take on habits that is
[1:12:47] displeasing to you." Amen. But that's
[1:12:50] the desire uh uh in the Christian. We
[1:12:53] want to be transformed. Ain't that
[1:12:55] right? Now, you know, there are no doubt
[1:12:59] there are many people who want to please
[1:13:01] God, but Satan has taken advantage of
[1:13:04] it. Amen. He's convinced women to become
[1:13:06] nuns. And and he's convinced many people
[1:13:09] to join a church. He's convinced many to
[1:13:11] become priests. He he's and and he's
[1:13:14] convinced men to become monks. And he's
[1:13:17] convinced uh uh uh you know, men and
[1:13:20] women to be become legalists. He's he's
[1:13:23] convinced preachers. He's made legalist
[1:13:24] out of preachers and and all of these
[1:13:27] things. And what he has done, he's made
[1:13:29] it all about sacrifice. He's made it all
[1:13:32] about penitence. He's made it all about
[1:13:35] rules of dos and don'ts and and all
[1:13:38] these things. and and and his agenda has
[1:13:41] been is to take the people's faith off
[1:13:44] of God's promise and unconditional
[1:13:47] promise and put it on theirelves on what
[1:13:51] they do what they don't do just even
[1:13:54] church joining. Do you realize people
[1:13:55] think they're Christians by joining a
[1:13:57] church? People think they're Christians
[1:13:59] by just shaking a preacher's hand. Amen.
[1:14:02] Satan's got and they're good people that
[1:14:04] Satan's got them so twisted up to where
[1:14:07] they they they don't recognize that
[1:14:10] God's covenant is unconditional. Amen.
[1:14:13] See, and they forget about the grace of
[1:14:15] God. Can you say amen? Amen. Brother
[1:14:18] Brandon talks about he says in the world
[1:14:20] today where all this isms rises up watch
[1:14:23] when all the cults of non-meat eating
[1:14:26] and illegalists that I've got to do so
[1:14:28] and so and if I don't speak with tongues
[1:14:30] if I don't do this if I don't shout if I
[1:14:32] don't dance there's something wrong with
[1:14:34] me. Well that's legalism. We are saved
[1:14:36] by grace through faith. Nothing what
[1:14:39] you've done. It's what he did. He did
[1:14:41] what you couldn't do. If he could have
[1:14:44] save if you could have saved yourself
[1:14:45] then he wouldn't have had to die. But he
[1:14:47] died in order to save you where you
[1:14:49] could not save yourself. Ain't that
[1:14:51] right? So there's so much legalism in
[1:14:54] the in the world today. Touch not and
[1:14:56] taste not and and all these things, but
[1:14:58] you don't do things legally. Brother
[1:15:00] Brandham says, "I didn't come to this
[1:15:01] church tonight legally. I feel tired.
[1:15:04] I've been nervous. I'm upset. I'm I'm
[1:15:07] wondering about something that's out
[1:15:08] before me. My heart's burning even as
[1:15:11] such as as much till my heart's
[1:15:14] fluttering. I got a cramp pain right at
[1:15:17] this moment. Uh minute just shooting
[1:15:19] back and forth up and down through here.
[1:15:21] Weak, nervous, trembly. Catch hold here
[1:15:24] and squeeze. See, got my toes squeezed
[1:15:27] up in my shoes. I felt anything but come
[1:15:29] down here. But why did I come then?
[1:15:31] Because I love God. Can you say amen?
[1:15:34] Amen. Because I love God. Live or die, I
[1:15:37] must stand here for him. It's not
[1:15:40] because I have to. He wouldn't care
[1:15:42] about whether I did or not. If I die,
[1:15:44] I'd go to heaven anyhow. But I'm coming
[1:15:47] because I love him. You serve God
[1:15:50] because you love him, not because you
[1:15:53] just got to do it. Can you say amen?
[1:15:55] See, so we find that that that get away
[1:15:58] from all this. I've got to I've got to
[1:16:00] and just fall in love with God. Just
[1:16:04] fall in love with him. And and it it
[1:16:07] just it it takes all the pressure. It
[1:16:09] takes all the worry. It takes all the
[1:16:12] condemnation. It just takes it all away.
[1:16:14] Amen. We don't That's why we don't come
[1:16:16] to church and sleep. Amen. Because
[1:16:18] there's something in us that we love God
[1:16:20] and we hang on to every word. Amen. That
[1:16:23] God has to say. Amen. And we know that
[1:16:26] it's a promise to me. It's a it's a
[1:16:29] reality. If I can just get it, if I can
[1:16:31] just believe it, if I could just accept
[1:16:34] it. Can you say amen? Amen. See, but but
[1:16:37] it's it all stems by love. Amen. Now
[1:16:40] within Christianom there's two factions
[1:16:43] and that's Armenianism which is legalist
[1:16:46] and and Calvinist uh which leans toward
[1:16:49] grace. Now I will say brother Brandham
[1:16:51] said I lean more to Calvinist than I do
[1:16:53] the Armenianism. Amen. But they both run
[1:16:57] out on a limb in what they believe. Now
[1:17:00] brother Brown said there is no scratch
[1:17:02] of legalism in the Bible. Can you say
[1:17:04] amen? There's no scratch of legalism in
[1:17:07] the Bible. Amen. Abraham did not live
[1:17:11] under legalism. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:17:14] See, so the promise that God gave him
[1:17:18] had nothing to do with the law. It had
[1:17:21] nothing to do and notice uh uh uh here
[1:17:25] Romans 4:13. For the promise that he
[1:17:29] should be heir be the heir of the world
[1:17:32] was not to Abraham or to a seed through
[1:17:34] the law, but through the righteousness
[1:17:37] of faith. For if they which are of the
[1:17:40] law be heirs, then faith is made void
[1:17:44] and the promise is made of no effect.
[1:17:47] Ain't that right? So if we can become
[1:17:49] heirs of the promise through what we do
[1:17:52] and what we don't do and all these then
[1:17:54] faith faith doesn't matter to us. Can
[1:17:57] you say amen? Amen. Our show of faith,
[1:18:00] our works of faith and all it doesn't
[1:18:02] matter to us. See, it would all be void
[1:18:05] and and we would just do everything
[1:18:07] under a law. Uh uh a a have to and and
[1:18:10] and these things. See, uh Galatians
[1:18:13] 3:17. And this I say that the covenant
[1:18:16] that was confirmed before of God in
[1:18:18] Christ, the law which was 430 years
[1:18:23] after cannot disenol, that it should
[1:18:26] make the promise of no effect. For if
[1:18:29] the inheritance be of the law, it is no
[1:18:32] more a promise, but God gave it to
[1:18:34] Abraham by promise. Can you say amen?
[1:18:37] Gave it to Abraham by promise. So then
[1:18:40] you'll never be able to inherit the
[1:18:42] promise by the law. Amen. You you'll
[1:18:45] never be able to do it. Amen. Through
[1:18:47] through what you do and what you don't
[1:18:49] do and and all of these things. Uh
[1:18:51] keeping the law never gives us Amen. the
[1:18:55] the the the promises. Amen. Well, that
[1:18:58] legalistic age didn't start until after
[1:19:01] God brought Israel out of Egypt. And
[1:19:04] then Israel wanted a law. They wanted
[1:19:06] something that they could do for
[1:19:08] themselves. They wanted to be able to
[1:19:10] measure up to God and and and and show
[1:19:13] God that they've got some power in this.
[1:19:15] They've got something to do with it and
[1:19:16] all these things. But see, when God gave
[1:19:19] the the the promise, the covenant to
[1:19:21] Abraham, he didn't raise up a law. It
[1:19:24] was a magnifying of his grace. of the
[1:19:27] grace of God, not not of law. Amen. See,
[1:19:31] so then that legalistic dispensation
[1:19:35] lasted until the real royal seed of
[1:19:37] Abraham came. Amen. The prophet said
[1:19:40] then he took all the legalism on himself
[1:19:43] and paid the price of redemption and
[1:19:46] brought the church, God's church, back
[1:19:48] in grace again. Aren't you glad you're
[1:19:50] under grace? Amen. See? And so then then
[1:19:54] the true seed of Abraham is not under
[1:19:57] law. Amen. But it's under grace the way
[1:20:00] their father Abraham was. Under grace.
[1:20:04] Amen. Nothing that we have to do. We
[1:20:06] have nothing to do with it. It's just
[1:20:08] God gave the promise. And that promise
[1:20:11] is so sure because he swore by himself.
[1:20:15] He made the covenant with himself and
[1:20:18] not with us.
[1:20:20] Praise the Lord. So the prophet said
[1:20:22] Christ taken the law upon himself and
[1:20:25] the law nailed him to the cross of what
[1:20:27] we must do and must not do and must do
[1:20:29] and must not do. You know the thing of
[1:20:32] it is today is when a sinner comes to
[1:20:34] the Lord we don't treat them like Paul
[1:20:36] did when the Philippian jailer said what
[1:20:39] must I do to be saved. He said now what
[1:20:41] we would say today he said see you got
[1:20:44] to quit smoking. You got to quit
[1:20:45] drinking. You got to quit doing this.
[1:20:47] Well that wasn't what he asked. He
[1:20:48] asked, "What must I do to be saved?"
[1:20:50] Notice, and Paul said, "Just believe on
[1:20:53] the Lord Jesus Christ." And the prophet
[1:20:56] says, "If you can believe for yourself,
[1:20:59] you can believe for your house also."
[1:21:01] Can you say, "Amen." Well, see, that's
[1:21:02] the kind of faith that the the seed of
[1:21:04] Abraham needs. Amen. That's the one
[1:21:07] Abraham had was just a faith just to
[1:21:09] believe God. Amen. It ain't all about
[1:21:11] the dos and don'ts and all of these
[1:21:13] things. Amen. It's just simply
[1:21:15] believing. And if you can believe for
[1:21:17] yourself, you can believe for your
[1:21:19] household. Amen. See, if you can believe
[1:21:22] for yourself, you can believe for your
[1:21:24] house also. Have enough faith in God.
[1:21:26] Everybody say, "Have enough faith in God
[1:21:29] to believe for yourself."
[1:21:31] Amen. Then believe for your children
[1:21:33] also. That same faith will save your
[1:21:36] children that saved you. How many
[1:21:38] believes you're saved? How many believes
[1:21:40] you're saved, church? Amen. Why are you
[1:21:42] saved? Because God made a promise. You
[1:21:45] may not feel saved, but you are saved by
[1:21:48] faith. You believe you're saved. Amen.
[1:21:50] You may not see that you're saved. You
[1:21:52] may not everything just around you going
[1:21:54] crazy, but you know you're saved because
[1:21:56] God made an unconditional covenant. He
[1:21:59] didn't base it upon what I felt. He
[1:22:01] didn't base it whether I'm on the
[1:22:02] mountain top or in the valley. I'm saved
[1:22:04] because he made a covenant with me. And
[1:22:07] if I can believe that for myself, I can
[1:22:09] believe it for my weward children. No
[1:22:11] matter how lost they are,
[1:22:15] Can you say amen? That same faith will
[1:22:18] save your children that saved you if you
[1:22:20] just keep praying. God will answer
[1:22:22] prayer. Don't worry. I'll say that
[1:22:24] again. God will answer prayer. Don't
[1:22:27] worry.
[1:22:29] Just ask him and believe it and get it
[1:22:31] anchored in your heart and just keep
[1:22:33] moving on.
[1:22:36] Can you say amen? God help us just to
[1:22:38] keep moving on. Don't build a mailbox
[1:22:41] around your problem.
[1:22:43] Keep moving on. You prayed about it. You
[1:22:47] believed God to do it. Now just keep
[1:22:49] moving on. He said that's the way it's
[1:22:52] done.
[1:22:54] You see, there's a power laying in the
[1:22:56] church and it's in the seed of Abraham.
[1:23:00] That power, the prophet said, is
[1:23:03] controlled by law. But that law isn't a
[1:23:07] isn't a bunch of keeping a bunch of
[1:23:09] commandments. It's not about keeping uh
[1:23:12] rules of dos and don'ts. That law is a
[1:23:15] law of faith. Can you say amen? Amen. I
[1:23:19] I I know I I don't I feel people sorry
[1:23:22] for people that get so twisted up and
[1:23:23] they move from faith. Amen. And they get
[1:23:26] into works, get in their own works. But
[1:23:29] one of these days, see people get mixed
[1:23:31] up into them works and then they quit
[1:23:33] relying upon God and they rely upon
[1:23:34] themselves. And then when you make your
[1:23:36] mistakes, then the condemnation comes
[1:23:38] and you can't believe anymore because
[1:23:40] you've looked at yourself and you see in
[1:23:42] yourself in a mirror of what a failure
[1:23:44] you are, what a wretched, undeserving
[1:23:46] you are. But if you could get your eyes
[1:23:48] back upon the covenant of Christ, that
[1:23:51] covenant still remains.
[1:23:55] Do you believe it? Amen. So it's by the
[1:23:58] law of faith, not by the law of works of
[1:24:01] legalist. By that law
[1:24:05] we can speak a world into existence and
[1:24:07] go out and live on it. Prophet said
[1:24:10] Jesus said all things are possible to
[1:24:12] them that believe. How many believes
[1:24:13] that not all things are possible to them
[1:24:16] that join the church or or that that
[1:24:19] that you know that that shines their
[1:24:21] shoes every day. Man uh that that never
[1:24:25] that never makes a mistake that all
[1:24:27] things are possible to them that
[1:24:28] believe. And if you can believe it,
[1:24:31] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:24:33] believe, that is yours. I say, God, lead
[1:24:36] my soul to believe every bit of this
[1:24:38] Bible.
[1:24:40] Lead my soul to believe it for me
[1:24:44] and for my house. Can you say amen?
[1:24:47] Believe it for the church. Believe it.
[1:24:49] Believe it for others.
[1:24:51] Whatever God leads your soul to believe,
[1:24:54] that's what you can have. Don't limit
[1:24:56] God. Can you say amen? Yes, sir. See,
[1:25:00] every place the souls of your feet can
[1:25:02] set upon by faith. By faith. Every time
[1:25:07] you're reading these promises in this
[1:25:08] Bible, Amen. you set your foot upon that
[1:25:12] by faith. In other words, you claim it.
[1:25:15] If God says by his stripes you were
[1:25:17] healed, I claim that. I'll put my foot
[1:25:20] on that by faith. That's my promise.
[1:25:24] Amen. See, he said, "Then God gives it
[1:25:28] to you. Every place the souls of your
[1:25:29] feet can set upon by faith, God gives it
[1:25:32] to you. It's yours. You possess it. If
[1:25:35] you can find the key to this law of
[1:25:38] faith, that opens it to you. Ain't that
[1:25:40] right?" Amen. And and listen, church,
[1:25:43] we've said it before. You can pray, you
[1:25:45] can beg, you can plead, but if it ain't
[1:25:46] a prayer of faith, if there ain't a
[1:25:48] faith there to claim that word, to claim
[1:25:50] them promises, it ain't going to do you
[1:25:52] any good. I you can cry, you can beg,
[1:25:55] you can plead, you can you you can blow
[1:25:57] your nose 20 times a day. You can you
[1:25:59] you you can you can you know whatever
[1:26:02] you you can do whatever. Amen. But
[1:26:04] without faith, you ain't going to get
[1:26:06] nowhere. Faith is what unlocks the door
[1:26:08] to these promises. Ain't that right? And
[1:26:10] that's what God was trying to get
[1:26:12] Abraham to do. Abraham, I just want you
[1:26:14] to believe me. I want you to trust me. I
[1:26:17] want you to know that I'm the God, amen,
[1:26:19] that can make this this promise live.
[1:26:21] I'm the God, amen, that can give you
[1:26:23] every answer. I'm the one that came to
[1:26:25] you. You didn't come to me. I'm trying
[1:26:27] to show you my desire. I'm trying to
[1:26:29] show you that I love you. I'm trying to
[1:26:31] show you that I've got an inheritance
[1:26:33] for you. And I give this promise to you.
[1:26:36] Don't look to yourself, Abraham. Look to
[1:26:38] me.
[1:26:41] Hallelujah. Ain't that right? See, so he
[1:26:44] said, see the power. He said, if you're
[1:26:47] a son of God, you're a daughter of God
[1:26:48] that never leaves you. that power. It's
[1:26:51] with you all the time, but your faith
[1:26:52] gets away from it, but it's still there.
[1:26:55] Ain't that right? So, notice faith
[1:26:57] cometh by hearing the word of God or
[1:27:00] hearing the promises of God. And and
[1:27:02] I've said it before, that's why we wave
[1:27:04] the promises over the people. We wave
[1:27:06] the promises over I You don't need to
[1:27:08] know what I think. You need to know what
[1:27:11] God thinks. Waving them promises over
[1:27:13] you. Can you say amen? Amen. Say, "Faith
[1:27:16] cometh by hearing the word of God." Now,
[1:27:19] men take this Bible and and and preach
[1:27:22] from a legalistic standpoint. I've been
[1:27:24] in it. I've seen people like it. I know
[1:27:26] it. And and and every time legalism is
[1:27:29] preached, faith is void among the
[1:27:31] people. People got so lack of faith.
[1:27:34] Amen. Because they're looking to a
[1:27:36] preacher. They're looking at what he
[1:27:38] thinks and what he wants and what he
[1:27:40] expects. And and the word becomes
[1:27:42] interpreted through the preacher. Amen.
[1:27:44] Of for everybody's lives. Amen. instead
[1:27:47] of for them just taking the promise.
[1:27:49] Amen. And saying, "God, I just claim
[1:27:51] it." Can you say, "Amen." That's right.
[1:27:53] See, and and and and I tell you this,
[1:27:56] we're not preaching. We don't preach to
[1:27:57] perfect people. Amen. This preacher
[1:28:00] knows that. Amen. And you know this
[1:28:02] preacher ain't perfect. That I'm not
[1:28:03] requiring you to be perfect. You're not
[1:28:05] requiring me to be perfect. We're just
[1:28:07] looking at the promises of God, knowing
[1:28:10] that God will make this word perfect in
[1:28:12] us. God's going to fulfill the word.
[1:28:15] Ain't that right? Amen. See, so so then
[1:28:19] we find out, Amen. We can disappoint one
[1:28:21] another many times. Amen. And we can
[1:28:24] look at in and each other and say, "My
[1:28:26] goodness, what in the world is wrong
[1:28:27] with them people?" You know, and and you
[1:28:29] can look and say, "Well, what's wrong
[1:28:31] with that preacher?" And and all of
[1:28:32] these things or what's wrong with my
[1:28:34] husband? What's wrong with my children?
[1:28:36] But don't you look at all of that. Look
[1:28:38] to the promise of God. Amen. The promise
[1:28:40] of God. God has showed that he is able
[1:28:43] to take a man, amen, and bring him out
[1:28:46] from the depths of the ocean, amen, and
[1:28:49] spare his life. God has shown that he
[1:28:51] can take a man that's been dead four
[1:28:53] days and bring him back to life. God has
[1:28:56] shown that he can deliver such a man,
[1:28:59] amen, that had 2,000 demons in him and
[1:29:02] the world didn't know what to do with
[1:29:04] him. Society had kicked him out, but
[1:29:07] God's power showed up because he was a
[1:29:10] predestinated son of God. Even the woman
[1:29:13] at the well, that was an outcast. That
[1:29:15] was a scarred life. But when she met the
[1:29:18] redeemer, he had the power to deliver
[1:29:21] her. Amen. And that's what we're looking
[1:29:23] to. I don't have the power to help you.
[1:29:26] You ain't got the power to help me. But
[1:29:28] God has the power. And he made the
[1:29:32] promise.
[1:29:34] He made the promise. That's right.
[1:29:36] Aren't you glad he made the promise? If
[1:29:39] we keep the promise before us. Amen.
[1:29:42] See, so faith faith doesn't come by the
[1:29:47] law of commandments.
[1:29:49] It comes by the word of promise. Amen.
[1:29:51] And Paul called it the word of faith
[1:29:53] which we preach. And that same word of
[1:29:56] faith is in thy mouth and in thine
[1:29:58] heart. Ain't that right?
[1:30:00] So God come to Abraham, gives him this
[1:30:04] unconditional covenant and it inspired
[1:30:07] faith in Abraham.
[1:30:09] Oh my. It had become personally revealed
[1:30:12] to Abraham. Oh, amen. That God was God.
[1:30:17] That God was faithful. Can you say amen?
[1:30:20] Amen. The Bible says he believed God and
[1:30:22] it was counted unto him for
[1:30:24] righteousness. See, so see the seed of
[1:30:26] Abraham is just like their father
[1:30:28] Abraham. They just simply believe. They
[1:30:31] just simply believe. They're not looking
[1:30:33] to the flesh. They simply believe. Ain't
[1:30:35] that right? Are we Are we Well, are we
[1:30:37] in are do we have uh uh you know, do we
[1:30:40] believe in holiness? Uh of course we
[1:30:42] believe in holiness. Well, why would we
[1:30:44] believe in holiness? You trying to you
[1:30:46] trying to gain something with God? No.
[1:30:47] No, not at all. Amen. I'm just simply
[1:30:50] following what he said. I believe his
[1:30:52] promise. That that means that's keeping
[1:30:54] me out of hell. Can you say amen? that's
[1:30:56] keeping me out of the Satan's grips.
[1:30:59] Ain't that right? Amen. I've got a Holy
[1:31:01] Spirit living in me. God's holy. Amen.
[1:31:04] And that same holy God is now living in
[1:31:06] me. He directs my thoughts. He directs
[1:31:08] my my actions. He directs everything.
[1:31:11] Amen. There's just something about it.
[1:31:13] Ain't that right? Now, legalist takes it
[1:31:16] takes it and then and then they take it
[1:31:18] to the extreme
[1:31:21] and then they put the people in bondage
[1:31:22] again.
[1:31:26] Ain't that right?
[1:31:28] But see, all you do is just believe the
[1:31:30] promise. God, he said he'll take care of
[1:31:33] us. That's right. Just believe the
[1:31:35] promise.
[1:31:37] I hope that's all right.
[1:31:39] There are two different kinds of seed
[1:31:41] that Abraham had and that was the
[1:31:43] natural and spiritual.
[1:31:45] Natural seed was Israel of a natural
[1:31:49] bloodline.
[1:31:50] But the seed of Abraham, the the true
[1:31:53] seed of Abraham is the spiritual seed.
[1:31:56] Romans 2:28 says, "For he is not a Jew
[1:31:59] which is one outwardly,
[1:32:02] neither is that circumcision which is
[1:32:04] outward in the flesh." God required the
[1:32:07] Jew to have a natural circumcision of
[1:32:10] the flesh.
[1:32:13] And and every every male child had to
[1:32:16] have circumcision.
[1:32:19] And circumcision was a type of the Holy
[1:32:21] Ghost. Ain't that right? But Paul is now
[1:32:24] telling us that just because they had a
[1:32:26] natural circumcision had nothing to do
[1:32:29] with being heir to promise. It being
[1:32:33] being the seed according to the flesh
[1:32:35] had nothing to do with being heir to the
[1:32:37] promise. Because look look at the
[1:32:39] natural seed when it came to the full
[1:32:41] word made manifest. The natural seed
[1:32:43] failed and they crucified their
[1:32:45] inheritance. They crucified Amen.
[1:32:48] They've done exactly what Esau done.
[1:32:52] Despise the inheritance. Can you say
[1:32:54] amen? But he is a Jew which is one
[1:32:58] inwardly and the circumcision is that of
[1:33:01] the heart. Amen. In the spirit, not in
[1:33:04] the letter, whose praise is not of men,
[1:33:07] but of God. So only God can do this
[1:33:09] circumcision.
[1:33:11] Ain't that right? And what does he do?
[1:33:14] He cuts off the surplus of the world.
[1:33:18] out of our hearts. He takes that little
[1:33:20] desire that we used to have that crave
[1:33:22] for things. He takes that out and and I
[1:33:26] believe I believe and and as we grow,
[1:33:29] you know, as we grow and he's still
[1:33:31] doing operation on us, cutting things
[1:33:34] out. Can you say amen? Amen. That's
[1:33:37] right. See, but but we find so so the
[1:33:40] circumcision of the natural seed was of
[1:33:42] the flesh, which was nothing. The
[1:33:44] prophet said it had nothing to do with
[1:33:45] the promise being given to Abraham.
[1:33:49] So, so in other words, God didn't
[1:33:51] require Abraham to be circumcised and
[1:33:53] say, "I give you the promise now." No.
[1:33:55] The promise was before circumcision.
[1:33:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:59] Amen. Ain't that right?
[1:34:02] It isn't because you have the Holy
[1:34:04] Ghost. Amen. That God gave you the
[1:34:07] promise.
[1:34:09] Amen. It had nothing to do with that.
[1:34:12] God gave you the promise way before
[1:34:14] then. Lord, it's by grace. Amen. Now,
[1:34:17] I'm I'm not going to take much longer,
[1:34:19] but Romans 4:15,
[1:34:23] the law workketh wrath. For where no law
[1:34:26] is, there is no transgression.
[1:34:29] Therefore, it is of faith. Everybody
[1:34:31] say, it is of faith. That it might be by
[1:34:34] grace. So, grace of God provides the
[1:34:37] faith of God.
[1:34:40] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:34:43] all the seed, not to that only which is
[1:34:46] of the law, but to that also which is of
[1:34:49] the faith of Abraham who is the father
[1:34:52] of us all. As it is written, I've made
[1:34:54] thee a father of many nations before him
[1:34:57] whom he believed, even God who quickenth
[1:34:59] to death, and calleth those things which
[1:35:01] be not as though they were. Now, Abraham
[1:35:05] could already call those things that
[1:35:06] were not as though they were because it
[1:35:08] didn't depend on him. It depended upon
[1:35:10] God. And he he understood that God was
[1:35:13] faithful, that God would honor his word,
[1:35:15] his own word. He understood just how
[1:35:18] sure this word was. Therefore, he didn't
[1:35:20] worry about his condition. Didn't worry
[1:35:22] about Sarah. Didn't worry about nothing.
[1:35:24] He just said, "We're going to have him.
[1:35:25] We're going to have our child. We we
[1:35:27] we're going to have the seed. We You
[1:35:29] understand what I'm saying?" He called
[1:35:30] those things that are not as though they
[1:35:32] were because the covenant was
[1:35:34] unconditional. That's what makes us call
[1:35:37] those things that are not as though they
[1:35:38] were because we realize my healing is
[1:35:41] unconditional. My my salvation is
[1:35:44] unconditional. Everything about me and
[1:35:47] God is unconditional. Therefore, I can
[1:35:50] call my healing before it ever happens.
[1:35:52] I can I can call my body changed before
[1:35:55] it ever happens. I I can call my
[1:35:57] children in being saved before it ever
[1:35:59] happens. I I can see I can call my
[1:36:02] spouse Amen. in and serving God before
[1:36:05] it ever happens because I'm not looking
[1:36:07] at him or her. I'm not looking at me.
[1:36:10] It's beyond me. Amen. When my back is
[1:36:12] against the wall, it does not change
[1:36:14] what my confession is. I'm still calling
[1:36:17] those things that are not as though they
[1:36:19] were because the promise
[1:36:22] is unconditional. That's right. And he
[1:36:26] based it upon himself, not upon me.
[1:36:28] Amen. Can you say amen? That's right. So
[1:36:32] he's now 19th verse and being not weak
[1:36:35] in faith, he considered not his own body
[1:36:38] now dead. Didn't even consider it. When
[1:36:40] he was about 100 years old, neither yet
[1:36:43] the deadness of Sarah's womb. Didn't
[1:36:44] consider that. He staggered not.
[1:36:47] Everybody say, "Stagger not." Stagger
[1:36:49] not at the promise of God through
[1:36:51] unbelief. Ain't that amazing? Amen.
[1:36:55] Now, we know we know otherwise that he
[1:36:58] did he did go into Hagar,
[1:37:01] right? We know otherwise that he did
[1:37:03] lie. We know otherwise he did do some
[1:37:06] things. But when it come through the
[1:37:08] blood, he didn't do none of it. That's
[1:37:10] right. He staggered not at the promise
[1:37:13] of God. Can you say amen? That's right.
[1:37:15] Oh my. Praise the Lord. Staggered not at
[1:37:18] the promise of God through unbelief, but
[1:37:20] was strong in faith.
[1:37:24] giving God glory to God and being fully
[1:37:26] persuaded that what he had promised he
[1:37:28] was able also to perform and therefore
[1:37:31] it was imputed unto him for
[1:37:32] righteousness. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:37:35] Now let me ask you, how did Abraham keep
[1:37:37] his faith strong? 25 years he waited and
[1:37:42] everything was against him. He was
[1:37:44] getting older. Sarah was getting more
[1:37:46] older. Everything was looking more
[1:37:49] impossible as the day goes.
[1:37:52] But he was strong in faith, fully
[1:37:53] persuaded. How did he get there? How did
[1:37:55] it happen? Well, you see, he nursed off
[1:37:59] the promises of God. And what I think,
[1:38:03] you know, I was telling my son, uh,
[1:38:07] Seth, he he's he had gotten a he's got a
[1:38:09] bad report on his eyes and it's not
[1:38:12] looking good.
[1:38:14] And
[1:38:16] uh but I told him, you know, I was just
[1:38:19] telling the family, I guess,
[1:38:21] isn't it isn't it wonderful though
[1:38:25] that we have the same opportunity that
[1:38:27] Abraham had the Lord
[1:38:31] that we don't have to despair.
[1:38:34] We've got promises to nurse from. That's
[1:38:36] right. We don't have to look at the
[1:38:39] situation. And I told him, I don't
[1:38:41] believe the doctor's report. I've got
[1:38:42] another report.
[1:38:44] I'm leaving what God says about it. I'm
[1:38:47] leaving for a miracle.
[1:38:49] But see, we can we we we don't have to
[1:38:51] fall apart when the doctor says this and
[1:38:53] gives all the negative and and it looks
[1:38:55] impossible. It looks like you'll go
[1:38:57] blind
[1:38:59] and and you know, of course, that's got
[1:39:01] to be a worry. a dad of three three
[1:39:02] youngans and a mother, his wife, you
[1:39:05] know, and what do you do for a living
[1:39:06] and all these things get to a point that
[1:39:08] he can't even drive in daytime and and
[1:39:11] it just looks like he it it's just
[1:39:13] hopeless. You know, he's got all of his
[1:39:14] bills and all these things and and and
[1:39:16] if you look at all that, you'd fall
[1:39:18] apart. But there's a promise and we are
[1:39:21] the children of Abraham. And God is
[1:39:23] giving us the same opportunity that he
[1:39:25] gave Abraham, and that is nurse off the
[1:39:28] promise. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[1:39:32] knew it was going to happen way before
[1:39:34] he was born. But he left a promise just
[1:39:38] as much as God knew about Abraham and
[1:39:40] Sarah, but he gave a promise. Now all
[1:39:43] they had to do was just nurse. And all
[1:39:45] we have to do is nurse off of God's
[1:39:47] promises. Can you say amen? The prophet
[1:39:50] said, "God appeared to Abraham in the
[1:39:52] name of God Almighty." in in in the
[1:39:55] Hebrew it's El Shadi which means
[1:39:58] properly the breast of a woman and said
[1:40:00] Abraham I'm appearing to you now as the
[1:40:03] breasted one. Oh God see I I am the
[1:40:06] mother. You're old. Your strength is all
[1:40:08] gone but I'm the breasted God. In other
[1:40:10] words, your strength is gone, Abraham,
[1:40:12] but I am the one who can nurse you back
[1:40:14] to strength again. God Almighty, if he
[1:40:17] was that to Abraham, he's got to be it
[1:40:19] to Abraham's seed for the same promises.
[1:40:22] No matter how sick you are, how far
[1:40:24] you've gone, you're gone. Lay a hold on
[1:40:27] God's eternal promises and nurse your
[1:40:30] life back again. How far you are in sin,
[1:40:32] how black you are, you may be a
[1:40:34] prostitute from the street, but that
[1:40:36] same promise is to you if you'll dare to
[1:40:39] take a hold of God. Can you say amen?
[1:40:43] Amen. That's exactly right. Amen.
[1:40:45] another place he said God said Abraham
[1:40:48] though you're old and your strength is
[1:40:50] gone and Sarah's womb is dead and the
[1:40:52] milk veins are no more but I am the
[1:40:54] breasted God just lean over on my bosom
[1:40:57] and nurse from my promises and I'll give
[1:41:00] you your strength he's still El Shadi
[1:41:04] the breasted God though the doctor says
[1:41:06] the cancer's going to kill you he's the
[1:41:08] breasted God lean on his bosom he's got
[1:41:11] two the new and old testament see just
[1:41:13] lean on every promise promise that he
[1:41:15] made and nurse your strength back again
[1:41:18] out of God's eternal promises. He's just
[1:41:20] the same today as he was when he made
[1:41:22] the promise to Abraham. He's the
[1:41:24] breasted God. Ain't that right? You see,
[1:41:27] God's strength is his word. So, when
[1:41:30] you're believing God's word and you're
[1:41:32] laying claim to God's word above
[1:41:33] everything else and you're putting God's
[1:41:35] word as the preeminence, you're you're
[1:41:37] you're you're nursing from that word.
[1:41:39] Amen. That's his breast, the the new and
[1:41:41] old testament. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:41:43] And and as you're believing that word,
[1:41:45] you're you're nursing from that word.
[1:41:47] There's strength in that word. And that
[1:41:49] strength is coming from the word into
[1:41:51] you. Amen. You don't have to say, "Well,
[1:41:54] I wonder when it's going to happen." You
[1:41:55] don't have to worry. You just know it's
[1:41:57] going to happen. Well, it may take a
[1:41:58] hundred years. Oh, I just don't know. I
[1:42:01] may be dead and gone. It doesn't matter.
[1:42:03] God's able to raise you back up again.
[1:42:05] Did he not do it? Has he not done it?
[1:42:10] Yes, sir. See? So, see, when you're
[1:42:12] nursing on God's promise, then you're
[1:42:14] nursing his strength into you. That's
[1:42:18] better than any medicine you can take.
[1:42:20] Amen.
[1:42:22] And brother Bram says, "What is this?
[1:42:24] How you nursing it?" You're not taking
[1:42:26] your own thoughts about it. Right.
[1:42:29] Hello. Amen. You're just believing.
[1:42:32] That's right. So, you're not putting a
[1:42:34] time limit. You're just believing. Yes.
[1:42:36] You're not saying, "Well, it's going to
[1:42:37] happen, you know, well, it better happen
[1:42:39] or I'm just going to whatever." No, you
[1:42:41] just believe it. See, and notice, a real
[1:42:44] child of Abraham, a born again of the
[1:42:47] spirit is satisfied. Yeah. Just like a
[1:42:50] mother when when it's nursing from its
[1:42:52] mother, it it's satisfied.
[1:42:55] It's not just drawn strength, but it's
[1:42:58] pacified. It's satisfied.
[1:43:02] Hallelujah. And brother Brown said,
[1:43:03] "That's a true believer with the Holy
[1:43:05] Ghost." When he's nursing off the
[1:43:07] promise, he's satisfied.
[1:43:13] He's satisfied that God is going to keep
[1:43:16] his word while he's waiting on his
[1:43:18] strength.
[1:43:20] Amen. He doesn't fret. He just lays
[1:43:24] there and nurses his little way right
[1:43:26] back to strength again. Amen. So if
[1:43:29] you're weak and you can't give up this
[1:43:32] and give up that, just take God's
[1:43:35] promise and lean and nurse.
[1:43:39] If you're sick, just take his promise
[1:43:41] and nurse from it and be satisfied
[1:43:45] that God said so. How many satisfied
[1:43:48] that God said so?
[1:43:52] Not ftting about it, not worrying about
[1:43:53] it. God knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:43:56] If the musicians will come satisfied,
[1:44:01] I'm satisfied that God said so. Amen.
[1:44:06] The world can't give me this
[1:44:08] satisfaction.
[1:44:10] Cuz they can't guarantee me nothing,
[1:44:14] but oh, God's guaranteed it to me cuz he
[1:44:18] swore by himself.
[1:44:21] I have nothing to do with it at all. You
[1:44:23] have nothing to do with it. Just nurse
[1:44:27] and be satisfied. Amen. And draw
[1:44:30] strength from it. Can you say amen?
[1:44:33] Hallelujah.
[1:44:34] I love the Lord. Amen.
[1:44:37] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:41] Hallelujah. What song?
[1:44:46] Oh, he's got it all
[1:44:50] in control.
[1:44:56] He's got it all
[1:44:59] in control.
[1:45:04] He put that reassurance
[1:45:09] way down in my soul.
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:17] He's got it all.
[1:45:21] Oh, do you believe it now? Sing it. He's
[1:45:25] got it all.
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:30] Glory to God. Glory to God. He's got it
[1:45:33] all.
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:39] Oh yes, he
[1:45:42] put that reassurance
[1:45:47] way down in my soul. Oh,
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] he's got it all.
[1:45:58] I put my life in his hands.
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:02] I put my life I gladly put my life. I
[1:46:07] don't begrudgingly do it. I gladly put
[1:46:10] it in his hands.
[1:46:12] Hallelujah.
[1:46:15] His hands.
[1:46:19] So every road I walk down,
[1:46:23] I'm sure it's in his plan.
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:30] I put my life.
[1:46:34] My father knows.
[1:46:39] My father knows.
[1:46:43] Hallelujah. Yes, he does.
[1:46:47] My father knows just what I need.
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:47:03] Glory to God.
[1:47:06] My father knows
[1:47:09] what I need.
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] He's got it all.
[1:47:17] in control.
[1:47:21] Praise the Lord. He's got it all in
[1:47:26] control.
[1:47:30] Put that reassurance
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:35] way down in my soul.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:41] He's got it all
[1:47:44] in control. Oh,
[1:47:48] they just play softly. Daniel, you want
[1:47:51] to come and sing that? I can't remember
[1:47:54] the song, but it's the one I showed you
[1:47:55] from Brother Doug Bakers. Uh, do you
[1:47:58] know the title of that?
[1:48:01] Ain't nothing.
[1:48:05] He put that reassur
[1:48:10] in my soul.
[1:48:16] He's got it all
[1:48:19] in control.
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:28] Oh, it ain't nothing.
[1:48:32] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:48:35] I may falter, stumble in everything I
[1:48:40] do. Oh, I may worry.
[1:48:43] Hold my breath till my face turns blue.
[1:48:47] But it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:48:50] for you.
[1:48:53] Oh, the children had their backs to that
[1:48:56] Red Sea.
[1:48:58] And old Pharaoh looked like he had the
[1:49:03] victory, but the waters rolled on back
[1:49:07] with the breath you blew.
[1:49:10] And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:49:13] for you.
[1:49:15] Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:49:18] for you.
[1:49:21] Oh, I may falter, stumble in everything
[1:49:24] I do. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath
[1:49:29] till my face turns blue. But it ain't
[1:49:33] nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:49:37] Now, oh Joshua took a walk around
[1:49:41] Jericho
[1:49:43] and you told him, Lord, you told him
[1:49:46] that the wall would go. Oh, and it
[1:49:49] crumbled at the shout when the trumpets
[1:49:52] blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't
[1:49:57] nothing for you.
[1:49:59] Now Elijah,
[1:50:01] all them prophets said he was wrong.
[1:50:05] send the fire down to their gods. They
[1:50:08] prayed all day long. Then Elijah prayed
[1:50:12] and down came the fire.
[1:50:15] And then they knew that it was nothing
[1:50:18] for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't
[1:50:24] nothing for you.
[1:50:26] I may falter, stumble in everything I
[1:50:30] do. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till
[1:50:35] my face turns blue. But it ain't
[1:50:38] nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:50:42] Now I was lonely. Sin had broken my
[1:50:46] heart into
[1:50:48] all the pieces I couldn't men with the
[1:50:51] strongest glue. Oh by Lord Jesus, you
[1:50:56] took the pieces and made me new. And it
[1:50:59] ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:51:04] Now this body slowly dying without and
[1:51:08] within.
[1:51:10] But I ain't worried though. The skin
[1:51:13] worms eat my skin. Cuz you'll
[1:51:17] heaven's doors and I'll walk right in.
[1:51:20] And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:51:24] for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't
[1:51:29] nothing for you.
[1:51:31] I may falter, stumble in everything I
[1:51:35] do. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath till
[1:51:40] my face turns blue. But it ain't
[1:51:43] nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh,
[1:51:48] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for
[1:51:51] you.
[1:51:53] Oh, I may falter, stumble in everything
[1:51:57] I do. Oh, I may worry, hold my breath
[1:52:01] till my face turns blue. But it ain't
[1:52:04] nothing.
[1:52:06] Sing it one more time. Oh, it ain't
[1:52:10] nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:52:14] Oh, I may falter, stumble in everything
[1:52:18] I do. And I may worry, hold my breath
[1:52:22] till my face turns blue, but it ain't
[1:52:26] nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:52:30] Well, can you give the Lord a hand clap
[1:52:32] of praise? How great is our God?
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:38] How great
[1:52:41] is our God?
[1:52:44] Sing with me. How great
[1:52:48] is our God.

[1:53:05] is our God.

[1:53:13] above all things?
[1:53:16] Ruler over all.
[1:53:18] Hallelujah
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:22] is our God.
[1:53:25] Oh, the splender of the king,
[1:53:32] clothed in majesty.
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:37] Let all the earth rejoice.
[1:53:41] Let all the earth rejoice.
[1:53:46] He wraps himself
[1:53:48] in light.
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:53] Darkness tries to hide
[1:53:57] and trembles at his voice.
[1:54:01] Trembles at his voice. Oh, how great
[1:54:08] is our God.
[1:54:11] Sing with me. How great
[1:54:15] is our God.
[1:54:17] And all will see how great,
[1:54:22] how great
[1:54:25] is our God.
[1:54:28] Oh, from age to age he stands.
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:36] Time is in his hands.
[1:54:40] He's the beginning and the end.
[1:54:44] Beginning and the end.
[1:54:48] Oh, the Godhead three in one.
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:55] Father,
[1:54:57] spirit, son. He's the lion and the lamb.
[1:55:03] Lion and the lamb.
[1:55:07] Oh, how great
[1:55:11] is our God.
[1:55:13] Sing with me, how great
[1:55:17] is our God,
[1:55:19] and I will see how great,
[1:55:24] how great
[1:55:27] is our God. One more time. How great
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] is our God.
[1:55:39] Oh, he's so wonderful.
[1:55:43] And all will see how great,
