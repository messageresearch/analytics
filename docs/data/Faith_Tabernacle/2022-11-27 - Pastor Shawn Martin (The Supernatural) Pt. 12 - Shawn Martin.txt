dismissed and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians and um I trust that everyone had a good Thanksgiving and didn't eat too much and all right looks like everyone about the same so that's good this is a plus and I ate some and made sure I didn't gain so I went to the gym praise the Lord and I even got Seth down there with me and and we've done five miles praise

brother John and so Kim was sick and uh be good to see that she's doing better amen and if I've missed anyone that's here that was gone we're just really glad to have you too amen but it's always good to have the people of God amen and the book of Ephesians the first chapter and um I want to just start maybe the 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints he's not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him everybody say the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen you can have your seats praise the Lord and um we uh want to just again take a little thought on the supernatural and um I have been studying the subject that I'm going to be speaking on for nearly a month or so and I just felt a time to speak on it and the direction and so um uh you know I as your pastor I'm going to take my Liberty and sing what I believe to be the truth and um and what I say will be from the message and so um and of course I it's a it's a long subject day so I'm not going to get my thought complete today but I do ask that you just listen and let me speak to you and um I I again it'll be from the message and because I I believe that's the only way a man can be balanced is not taking someone else's word but to to look at it in in the light of what the prophet has said so we're going to read a lot of quotes because I feel it of necessity and it is important that we know the truth because as the Bible says know the truth and the truth so set you free and we certainly want to remain free I I think the Prophet come with a message to set the bride free and we've heard the the uh The Voice come out of her my people and we have come out I I hope you have and and so therefore we were going to remain out we're going to remain free and so brother Branham said no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of an adherence to the pure word of God as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament and and we can look and say today that we could look and say as well as the New Testament uh uh so your strength your uh um your your your your spiritual healthiness and aliveness uh uh is is as strong as your knowledge and adherence to the word of God and notice he said pure word of God can you say man so last Sunday I had made a statement that there is no difference uh between the church today and I'm I say the True Church of the Living God uh when uh from today uh than it was in the in the first church on the days of in the days of Acts and and that is true there is no difference and yet there is a difference uh uh between us and the church uh back then so today I'm going to deal with the comparison of what we are versus what the the first church is there I'm going to deal with the comparison not the difference and um and so I believe that the the church today is the mightiest force on the Earth today it's the mightiest force uh on Earth I don't I don't care what government power whatever the church is the mightiest force and yet she is the uh the the smallest uh uh entity or or whatever on the Earth today very few minority and uh compared to uh uh uh What uh whatever but um yet God is with her and and so the prophet would tell us that she's a super race and one she realizes who she is and that she can discern uh the the spirits within the framework of the church and she can discern them things then she'll become an invincible Army and I believe that's where the church stands today is because we are Discerning we are recognizing the two Spirits uh that are in the within the framework of the church today and and so uh the church uh is the body of Christ in the Supernatural God dwells in it and uh uh it's not just the body of Christ but it is the bride of Christ it's the only bride of Christ today many many uh uh who claiming to be bride a man of Christ but this bride this church is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power Spirit of his spirit and and then the prophet just finalizes it with she is him she she is him can you say man she is Christ on Earth today you believe that amen she is the body a man that Christ uh uh lives in and she is the fullness of him that dwelleth in all in all so now this church is a predestinated church uh which which means that it is a word church uh the origin of this church is the word of God it's in in in anyone that's part of this church um of course you've got to be born into this church by one Spirit you're baptized into one body therefore you are predestinated you are a word individual a man and and so but before it can be word then it has to be a thought that's what brother Branham talked uh told us and and it had to be a thought first before it could become a a word ain't that right and and and we know that all of God's thoughts everybody say all all not one on the tube and all of God's thoughts are Eternal they're Eternal thoughts ain't that right and so it cannot change because God cannot change God his thoughts are God God is his thoughts it's it's one and the same ain't that right God is Holy that's why his thoughts are holy God is pure that's why his thoughts are pure God is righteous his thoughts are righteous and and and so uh he can't have an evil thought he can't have an impure thought because his thoughts are what he is amen and so he is eternal so his thoughts are Eternal well we know that God cannot change because he is eternal well then his thoughts cannot change because he they they are Eternal well then the thoughts of God are expressed in word form and the word cannot change because it is eternal know ain't that right so in the Eternal God were Eternal thoughts that was expressed into Eternal Word and now it's come into Eternal manifestation that's why you cannot be a Christian today and lost tomorrow amen that you you you were an eternal thought you started as an eternal thought in the mind of God ain't that right now you stand here as a manifestation of them Eternal thoughts that's why the devil can't take you out he can't defeat you he can't destroy you there is a word concerning you and that is an eternal thought ain't that right well so this word and and we could go on and on and about these words that that that make up the church but in Matthew 16 Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it do you realize that's that's enough scripture right there to defeat the Devil Anytime Anyplace under any circumstance any condition you name the trial that you're going through and that scripture right there is enough to defeat the Devil if you can really believe it amen because Jesus said I'm going to build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so that was the Eternal God speaking through human lips ain't that right amen uh it wasn't a man building the church it was God promising to build that church and that church was born on the day of Pentecost as we said it started as a seed and remember in Luke 8 11 Jesus said the seed is the word of God and the sower is the is uh the is the one that sold ain't that right so the sower sowed good seed and that good seed is the word word of God Amen well now brother Branham and we've read these quotes but last Sunday but brother Branham said God planted a holy ghost seed on the day of Pentecost he called it that little seed of Pentecost the grain another place he said the grain was planted at Pentecost another place there uh in the Masterpiece God started to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word ain't that right he goes on to tell us how it took him four thousand years it took God 4 000 years to build a masterpiece and and we know what that Masterpiece was that was Jesus Christ amen and and and and and he says he has taken nearly 2 000 years to build this other Masterpiece a man which is a bride for Christ or the Church of the Living God ain't that right so this is what we are a part of we are a part of what God started in the beginning amen that is our genes that's our inheritance that's that's that's our family tree ain't that right remember the mule the mule don't know who his daddy is he don't know his Beginnings but brother Brown said a pure pedigree does he knows where he started from he knows who his daddy is he knows who his mama is he can go and and so is a pedigree Christian we can take it all the way back to to where God started a man on the day of Pentecost and we can say I'm one of them I'm one of them can you say amen that's right see so the prophet says at the beginning it was Pentecost not an organization as I said before the word Pentecost is is such a scary word to people in this message and I don't understand why amen uh uh uh because when you think of Pinnacle people think of Pentecost they automatically go organization organization all the nonsense and all of that but as as the prophet tells us right here it started at Pentecost it was Pentecost not an organization but a Pentecostal experience that brought the seed of God down by the Holy Ghost it made men and women speak in tongues and stagger like drunk men Spirit operating in the church showing signs and wonders can you say Amen so that church a man that that at the day of Pentecost it started down as the original the original ain't that right amen so we find that this was the only original Church original is the only one right so it was the only church a man at that time on the day of Pentecost there was no sex uh uh uh sex uh other churches and and other uh uh there was only one Lord One Faith one baptism one Doctrine can you say Amen it started as the original Amen on the day of Pentecost amen now notice what brother Branham said if the vine ever ports puts forth another Branch it'll be the same kind of branch that acts was wrote on it'll have the same Doctrine everybody say the same Doctrine it'll have the same power same power it'll show the same signs because that's the kind of church that they had at the beginning can you say man so notice what brother Branham said to the people amen back then uh uh in in his day uh uh and and and and and and and you have to understand that brother Branham was speaking to people in his day as well as he was to us but but don't when you come up to quotes like this I personally feel that you cannot apply it to people that's already been called out so here's what he said today since the blood of the uh of the Jesus Christ has been shed and you've been interbred by all different kinds of ideas the holy spirit is here this morning to breed you back to the original brings you back to Pentecost breeds you back can you say man well see what was he talking about there had been so many ideas and indoctrination and all of that a man just like it did on at when God planted seeds in the very beginning amen and then Satan began to hybrid them seeds ain't that right and anything hybrid a man is a work of the devil ain't that right amen but here we find that brother Branham is telling the people the holy spirit is here today why is he here he's here today to bring you back bring you back to the original and what was the original Pentecost can you say man well I believe there's a people already been bred back in this day here if not amen then somehow I don't know what's going on Amen uh uh but it just shows just how few this bride is really going to be amen because the Holy Spirit has been working the prophet's been off the scene for 60 some years amen and if the Holy Spirit can't breathe a people back now if he hasn't already bred that people back now amen then what in the world are we going to do can you say man when the world is signs and of the time Russia is finding her position Israel's in her place amen America look where she's at homosexuals transgender everything is falling in place can you say Amen if the Holy Ghost can make them fall in their place unconverted heathens evil that don't even believe in the name of Jesus Christ that would accept everything that is ungodly then why can't God the Holy Ghost take a holy people that he's called out for his name and read them back to Pentecost can you say Amen well I tell you what he's doing it and he has done it he's breeding them back and he has bred him back can you say amen that's right see now brother Branham goes on turn back to the original turn back to the Bible get away from the organization and denomination and go back to the first go back to the original Pentecost to the original feeling of the Holy Ghost to the original Power the word testifies that it will happen do you understand that now he's he's speaking from the word go back why is he telling us go back because the word said it will happen and this word cannot pass away it is an eternal word can you say man so when God thought of his church he thought of a Pentecostal church when God thought of his church he thought of a church with power amen with gifts amen with the in operation with the supernatural God living in that body he can speak through them he can talk to them he can hear through them he can see through them he can act through them he can live through them can you say amen that's what happened on the day of Pentecost and that's what's happening in this bride today praise the Lord now he is telling the people go back to the original which fits now notice what he's telling us to go back to he's telling us because it fits with the ministry of Malachi 4. brother Brown says notice the first Elijah was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the old Orthodox to the new message was going on that he was given and then and is he says is a conjunction to tie the verse together the hearts of the children back to the fathers then the message of John in the last days or the message of Elijah the spirit that will be in the church will take the hearts of the people that's Fallen away from the Pentecostal fathers and turned their hearts back to the original message of Pentecost again as it started can you say man so that's what the message is to do that's what brother Brown was to do so now we can understand why he was calling out to the people calling out go back go back to the original if he didn't tell us to go back to the original he wouldn't have fit Malachi 4. you understand what I'm saying and any preacher any any parent any young person that cannot tell the world to go back to Pentecost amen don't believe this message you understand what I'm saying if we believe this message and we're speaking this message it'll be us to tell the people go back to Pentecost go back don't you take intellectualism don't you take just some little old whatever amen some idea amen don't just sit there and say well I believe the word so I'm okay you go back to Pentecost and make sure you have an experience like they did at Pentecost praise the Lord and if we're message people we'll Echo that go back to the original now what is in the seed will always be do you believe that what is in the seed will always be the only way it can change if it has been hybrid with something else ain't that right so the only way that a branch can bring forth something other than what is in the seed is for it to be a grafted branch so that's what brother Brown was talking about when he saw the orange trees that had I think it was orange trees that it had tangelos grapefruit had something else on there and he said well I thought this was a orange tree said it is but these gr these have been grafted and they're living off the vine or the life they're living off the life of the tree so brother Brown said okay so when it's fall and everything falls and the winter comes through and then they start bringing forth again he said then they'll all bring orange orange tree orange fruit and he said no no the the or the the branch that is tangelo will bring forth Angelo the the branch that is grapefruit will bring forth grapefruit but that when when that tree brings forth another Branch it'll be orange tree can you say Amen so so we find that that the only way that it can tell be be messed up is by a grafted Branch or a a hybrid seed ain't that rhyme so we find that the Church of the day of Pentecost was a Pentecostal church and brother Brandon said it will always be a Pentecostal Church it will always be a a Pentecostal church now brother Branham in another place he says if they would have let the Lutheran Church go on and not organize it it would have been Pentecostal Satan not the denomination I mean the real Pentecostal can you say man so then we find that anyone that studies the message amen knows that the Pentecostal age is not the seed it was not the seed can you say Amen the Pentecostal age is a laodicean age as we know that it was not the seed that was planted on the day of Pentecost when you use again the word Pentecost it seems most people get hung there hung up there and and they want to tell us that we're beyond that we we're beyond that and I will agree that we're beyond the Pentecostal age but you'll never be beyond the Pentecostal experience totally different can you say man amen totally different see so so we find that any branch a man cannot go beyond what was started as a seed amen you cannot the branch cannot go beyond the sea Amen in other words what I'm trying to get to now uh uh is the seed let's say the seed is an apple seed you plant that seed a man in the ground and then the tree starts coming up and it starts bringing forth up branches and and before you know it little apples start coming up on there but then you find as it gets bigger than them big branches say hold it now you know we've been in this a long time I I just don't think we need to be seen anymore we're Beyond seed so we're going to start bringing forth other things well you can't do that if if you're of the original you cannot bring forth something else amen because you're tied to the seed you're tied to what we in the ground you're tied to what was started can you say man so I don't care how big the tree is I've got a big apple tree at home and that that tree is huge that I I can always depend on it it'll bring forth apples I don't have to question about it because it'll never outgrow what started it it'll never outgrow what it was in the ground can you say amen that's exactly right well that's the same thing yes we are beyond that Pentecostal age amen but we still have a start and that was the seed amen and that was at Pentecost can you say Amen you'll never outgrow Pentecost you'll never outgrow a Pentecostal experience you'll never outgrow what God put in that church you just won't now Jesus said that he is the root and The Offspring so how are we going to do that one he was the roots of it he's The Offspring can you say man he is the alpha he is the Omega so now I will tell you this that what was in Luther's day and what was in Wesley's day and what was in the Pentecostal age we still have sure can you say Amen we still have then notice what brother Brown says Plus everybody say Plus Plus so now I hope to get more into that we're going to get more into this in in this subject as as we go but I want to mention this right fast Luther was a carrier of life and that life produced what little bit Luther had do you believe that a lot of nonsense went on Luther did not did not reflect the the the the the the the the the full seed because he was only a sprout right and so we find then that that life that Luther had went on up in into Wesley now when when that done that what happened Luther died and dried up and that's where she stands today ain't that right she don't even resemble what she had back then in Luther's day she is so messed up confused and dead it ain't even funny the lutherans have become a laughing stock it's hard to even believe that God used them at one time but God did but the life has moved on up now into Wesley ain't that right amen and what did it produce It produced a a a a greater part of life amen loser had a a portion of Life Wesley had a greater part can you say amen and what Luther had Wesley had Plus ain't that right so we find that that uh uh then the life moved up into the Pentecostal age a man and and Luther was a carrier of the life Wesley was the carrier of the life none of them both of them did not represent the seed at all did not even look like the seed it's true so we find that the life goes up into that Pentecostal age and what happens when the life left remember it didn't just give life to the Pentecostal age amen but the life literally left Wesley the life literally left it all ain't that right Wesley's dead today the Methodist sits dead they're even allowing homosexuals in that they're so messed up in their doctrines and their teeth it's even hard to believe that God used the Methodist that one time what is it the life is gone he'll never revive again it'll go off under into whatever chaos that's right and it has can you say amen amen but what happened the life moved up in that Pentecostal Age and what Luther had the Pentecostals had and what Wesley had the Pentecostals had plus can you say man now and yet now the prophet says now we're getting to look like seed again the Pentecostals look like the seed and everybody said that seed but it wasn't seed can you say Amen think of that now why because they had the restoration of the gifts they had the spirit of God moving you know the prophet said that the Holy Ghost spake in tongues to them people a lot of nonsense yes but there was a life there in there that there's so much life amen that when the people looked at it they thought that that was the seed that it wasn't the seed then you say amen and now we find out that all the life that was in that Pentecostal age has been gathered up in the seed in seed can you say amen amen it's there's no life it in the Pentecostal age they are dead they're dried up and I'm look at the Pentecost today I don't care what you call them Apostolic uh uh Assemblies of God Oneness or or whatever you want to look at today it it is hard to believe that God would use a Pentecost a man for a Revival but he did it and and Prophet said just give it a little bit more time they'll be worse off than the Catholic Church and they are because they're dead can you say man so where do we stand what Luther had what Wesley had what that Pentecostal age had we now have Plus can you say Amen plus amen I'm so glad that God sent a prophet all the life that what Luther had that Wesley had in the Pentecostals had all that life is now gathered in the seed and now they want to tell us we can't speak in tongues they want to tell us we can't run the aisle amen they want to criticize us for our worship amen that is nonsense [Music] the life is in the seed brother can you say Amen that's where we are look at it we're back to the original seed ain't that right brother Brown said this is seed time so the Lutheran age was once a carrier of the true word justification sanctification was once a carrier of the word sanctification Wesley the Pentecostal age became the carrier of the true word uh uh restoration of gifts but what we're not the carrier we're not the carrier of life we are we're the seed that's why brother Brown called it not just a Revival it's a brad Revival we're back to see time again aren't you glad for that we're back to seed time so we are the original seed you believe that well I know you do we are that Original Seed so now brother Brown said now listen now it's seed time or bright time now that's where we get the bright age it's bright age now they want to tell us that there's always been a bright age that's a lie brother Brown never taught that this is bright time now this is sea time now can you say Amen but what's the difference it's Harvest Time [Music] so the shuts are dead Pentecostal shucks they're dead the Virgin word time not touch it's a virgin remember a virgin word time there will be no denominational manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride can you say Amen now we've got men that has come from the Pentecostal ranks and they've come into the messenger drinks and they want to bring all their nonsense Pentecostal ideas Pentecostal nonsense into this message and mix this message up with it you cannot let it mix or you'll die with it can you say man you you'll die you'll just be a Pentecostal uh uh uh well you'll be a hybrid is one but you'll be just like the Pentecost of having to work everything up can you say man that's right but they want to try to mix all this amen but also we've got church of Christ we've got the Presbyterians we've got the Baptists we've got Apostolic legalists and we got them all that come into this message amen saying oh I've come out but then they want to mix their ideas they want to mix Church Christ Doctrine they want to mix up Presbyterian Doctrine Methodist Doctrine Baptist Doctrine and all of that with this message you can't do that can you say Amen well that that's true look at it they want to hold us in bondage they want to tell us what kind of music we can play they want to put us on what kind of instruments we can play in the church people will split hairs yeah over different kinds of instruments in the church that tell us what songs we can sing they want to control our worship so we don't get out of hand they want to tell us that the gifts are of no importance to us anymore you understand what I'm saying you know what and I'm going to just be as honest as I can it's the same demon that has been trying to tell us that there ain't no miracles in the church anymore either I sit there and talk to a preacher last year amen uh in in in another state I'll just say it that way and he sat there and told me that God doesn't work miracles anymore sat there and told me that so sir you're you're you've come too late buddy what in the world are you talking about you really I mean I've heard brother random talk tell these things I never I never I never had I never run into one but he literally told me that Mark 16 is no longer inspired that's a circle you look at all these young people out here playing [Applause] I said I can tell you everyone that has had Miracle after Miracle after miracle I said what are you going to give them young people in the day that is so evil and so perverse what are you going to give them a god that is just history lesson can you say Amen that's right see but you know what it's the same devil that wants to take the blood out of the church you know what brother Brown says about it amen that that they were trying to take the blood of Christ or out of the church we ain't gonna let them do it are we we're not gonna let them take Miracles and healings and signs and wonders we're not going to let them take the supernatural out of the church we're already back to seed again [Music] [Applause] we're seen so the bride of Christ will not fall for such nonsense why because brother Branham say it again there will be no denominational manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride now listen Church what are we in third pool third pool you know what brother Brandon worked the second and third pool or at first pull in the third pull but what is the third pull the opening of the word ain't that right third pool opening of the word so what does that mean to us we see that the blood is in the word it's open to us see in the word we see that God set the nine spiritual gifts in the New Testament Church in the word we see it in the word of them speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues we see it in the word of shouting and dancing and glorifying God in the word we see that there's laying hands on the sick and they shall recover can you say Amen Miracles are in the word casting out Devils is in the word and when that third pool came open it opened our eyes to where we could see it in the word and no man can take it or explain it away from us because it's opening of the word third pull ain't that right and we see that these things are supposed to be so we we find do you realize that it's under the third pool Ministry that we find that the only thing the word can produce is screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 tongue-speaking people can you say Amen under the word under the opening of the word third pull amen that's what the prophet was telling us now he's letting us know he said there's one thing you'll never find in the word and that's a painted face bobbed hair woman can you say man that's right see intellectual Church John and Creed going amen Bob pair a painted face you'll not her find that in the word ain't that right see but we find that the church natural the prophet says things set them blabbering hollering scream in Acts 2 38 tongue talking people she thinks they're miserable creatures and the prophet said she don't want to be impregnated with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it can you say Amen so we find that if the word is truly open to an individual they'll see it they'll sit in the word then they won't talk about and make fun of people amen getting a holy ghost slobbering it's not swinging I don't know amen can you say Amen it's true now I realize as we said and and we'll talk more about it as we go we've seen so much fake so much impersonations ain't that right or actually you wonder what is real I remember we've been in Pentecost we saw a lot of nonsense that when we come into the message we shut it all down shut it everything down because we had so much nonsense that we just shut it down but then we realized as the prophet began to teach us if there's a middle of the road and that just because there's impersonations don't mean that everything's impersonation and I want to tell you just because you see Hypocrites in a church don't mean that there ain't bride so don't fall apart [Music] can you say man don't don't fall apart when you see troubles in the church and when you see just nonsense going on and and you see people just so worldly bound and and and and this and you see all these Hypocrites and all of that amen and and believe me there's probably more Hypocrites than there are the genuine but that doesn't take away genuine then you say man that's right there's more people going in the world Council of churches than there are in this Rapture that don't mean that there ain't going to be a rapture didn't you say man there's more people that we're looking at that are Christians that ain't even got an experience with God but that doesn't take away that there is a bride on this Earth with her genuine experience of the Holy Ghost can you say man that's that's right now notice see so so there's going to be a fake in impersonations but you know what here's the thing and I want to tell you young people just the same don't focus on that don't focus on impersonations don't focus on Hypocrites you're that they'll be just a diamond doesn't then you say amen and there ain't nothing you can do about it you make sure you're genuine you make sure you've got an experience with God ain't that right so all of these things I'm not here focusing on the faith and the impersonations and the frauds and and all of that if we've done that we'd spend all of our time with that but there's more message to preach than that and I believe I've got a bride I've got to believe there's a people here and I'm believing all of you are here as the Bride of Jesus Christ and that's why I can preach the way I preach and you amen at the way I eat you a man [Applause] gives me hope to study because I know there's a bride here [Music] so we're not focusing on on Fool's goat we're focusing on the genuine thing right remember Judas followed Jesus all the way till Pentecost and it was at Pentecost he showed his colors I'm going to read this it's a little lengthy when it come to Pentecost for Judas to receive the Holy Ghost and so forth he showed his color he denied Jesus he become a traitor to him and that's just exactly what where that Spirit come right up through Luther Wesley brought that church up to sanctification with the Virgin alive Pure Clean holy nights finest people you ever met but when it came when it go to speaking in tongues and receiving the Holy Ghost the Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Free Methodist then says that's the devil and right then is when you blaspheme the Holy Ghost and shut yourself off forever for whosoever speak a word against the son of man shall be forgiven uh but whosoever speaks against the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven remember all the disciples spoke in tongues Jesus died on the cross speaking in tongues see so if you can't deal with them here and be friendly with them here what about over there if these are devils so was them see so you see where there where it showed its colors there comes that virgin clean the rest as the rest of them Pure Life I'll take the old-fashioned knit Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness churches who really believed in sanctification you can't lay a finger on their lives clean as they can be it's a good thing that we'd all live like that see that's right you have to see now he said we know we got a lot over in Pentecostals as impersonators that's true but as long as you see a bogus dollar you know that was made off of a good one a real one that's right there's a real Holy Ghost a real one that speaks in tongues and shows signs and wonders and it's been since Pentecost down so we have to have the impersonators we have to have an evil woman that's no good to make a real woman shine out we have to have a nighttime black darkness to show the sunlight is glorious that's right you have to be sick in order to enjoy good health and it's all see it's a law of pro and con it's always been and always will be as long as time is can you say man another place brother Brown said speaking of the rest of the disciples you know he was telling about Judas showing his colors at Pentecost and he he called him a traitor he he called Judas a traitor and and he said but the rest of the disciples he said they went out and had spiritual gifts they healed the sick they preached they were thrown in jail they were willing to suffer for the word sake ain't that right and so now then brother Branham explains what a traitor is and listen he says if you went to another Nation as a wishy-washy you wouldn't make a very good American if you went over there see he said if you was going in now to Japan and you slipped around behind the line and say listen fellas I'm for you and you know what I'm for you but I'm over on the other side he said you traitor you ought to be shocked that's right you're a traitor sure he said see and then that's the same way it is a man that knows the word of God and will compromise on it because some organization tells him he has to do it that way that's a traitor ain't that right he said notice what he talks about these men at Pentecost but these men weren't traitors they didn't care how much well How They carried on how their Church manners was screaming and crying and shouting and jabbering off languages that seemed like they was talking to one another and couldn't understand them men out there in the audience of other nations and other tongues begin to hear what they were saying now see they didn't know what they were saying talking about those that were speaking it they were jabbering but other people out there understood it can you say Amen see what was it it was a Pentecostal experience the Holy Ghost was speaking through the am another language that them men didn't even have the idea of what they were speaking they didn't know how to speak them but they were speaking it one might have been speaking English another an Arabic another one Japanese you understand what I'm saying and they didn't know it but it wasn't them speaking it these weren't Scholars with seven languages these were dumb ignorant men unlearned the Bible says but when the Holy Ghost got hold of him he wanted to send a message to them people out there isn't that wonderful so we find that what happened on the day of Pentecost was a supernatural act of God ain't that right now brother Brown spoke of Hal the hawk has long ago Lots disidentification and he said see he goes back goes on and keeps on going back trying to eat something Manna From Another Day it's rotten it's no good a genuine Eagle of this day knows that was all right but we got that Plus can you say man until Jesus Christ is made and manifest in the fullness of his power as he promised to be in this last day can you say Amen in other places said this Aid this last stage is what they were plus this the church today is that light plus what it has received today see another place it's Christ now taking the rags of yesterday the Lutheran the Methodist Presbyterian and so forth and he is putting it through a process what kind of process a process of the Holy Spirit what they had plus making it feel he is pressing his own image think of it he had to have Luther in order to make his image shine he had to have Wesley in order to make his image shine he had to have Pentecostal in order for it to shine but now we are here with that plus to where the fullness of Jesus Christ is pressed into the church the full power the full the goodness of God's glory is in the seed the church today [Music] you see Jesus was Solomon plus David plus Elijah plus Isaiah plus Moses you hit it he just didn't reflect one part he reflected it all he was the masterpiece he was what they were saying David had a little bit of life and look what he done perfect he reflected Christ Solomon had a little life and he reflected Christ amen Moses had a little life and he reflected Christ all the way down we see portions of God's life but then the fullness of God dwelt bodily in Jesus Christ and he was all the prophets he was all the songs he was all of the whole story it was in Christ can you say amen and here we are back at the Masterpiece again not just a portion but we have all of the word and you cannot take part of it out and make a masterpiece it took it all can you say Amen he was the fullness of it all God's Masterpiece and so were we are the fullness of it all another Masterpiece but where do the Masterpiece come from it come out of Jesus Christ it come out of Jesus Christ so that's our hope that's our and that's our foundation that's our expectation is what he was we are what he is we are and we will be can you say Amen now notice the real article or the real genuine article of God was Pentecost brother REM said it was and will always be and I believe that brother Brandon believed that with all of his heart in his prayer he said bring them back to original Pentecost bring them back to the blessings bring them back like the Pentecost that fail in A.D 33. give them the Pentecostal blessings May the power of God come into the church May there be Divine Healing gifts give to the church May there be speakers with tongues interpreter of tongues May there be Gifts of Prophecy and all different manifestations not make believe or try to believe or put on but may it be real genuine coming with the word the word of God made known prophesying things that comes to pass can you say Amen another place he said that's where the church began right here with Pentecostal power he says down through the stream of time the real true children of God held on to that Pentecostal blessing they spoke in tongues they had interpretation of tongues they had signs and wonders and they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and everything that the apostles did they did too right down through there can you say amen that's right you realize the reason why brother Branham named the men that he did as The Messengers of the ages was not because of what they were in in in the eyes of the public they uh you know influential men or whatever but it was because of the supernatural that was in these men's lives the signs and wonders that they had they had Supernatural manifestations of God many years ago a minister had a radio program and on there he told the people that the Pentecostal religion was just a sham and he told the told his audience not to listen to them because it's unstable he said any man that spoke in tongues and these things and claimed to be healed the sick and so forth by prayer that the people were to stay away from it and to pray for those poor decrepit people because if they were in an illusion that there was something wrong with them and he told his audience that that was only given for the days of the Apostles at Pentecost but we find that 30 years or so later that brother that Paul from the day of Pentecost Paul sat in the church the gifts nine spiritual gifts he sat within there speaking of tongues Miracles and all these other gifts so brother Branham said this he said there is a true one of real genuine a gift of speaking in tongues that's always everybody say always supposed to be in the church you say Amen so has this man you know talking it reminded me of of balak when he when Israel he was the king of Moab and Israel had come to uh cross over they were going into the promised land and Israel thank you buddy uh wanted to go through the land of Moab to get there and they told they sent a note to the king balak and said we would like to pass through your land he says anything that is taken off your land as far as eating um water food whatever we will pay that we will we will give you the money for that if you just let us cross over and and so now brother Branham says that Israel was God's chosen people for that day and he also said they were the Pentecostals of that day they had taken Refuge under the blood they had all been baptized in the Red Sea they came up out of the water singing in the spirit dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost while Miriam the prophetess played her tambourine see and so when they came up to this brother Branham said King balap got very excited about Israel coming across in their land he said that head of that that head of the nicolaitan bunch was not about to let the church come through come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd brother Brown said that's the same thing it is today and so there are too many that criticize these things and tried to explain them away and they want to put it all on Sensations if you dance Sensations if you speak in tongues that's sensation if you if you shake that Sensations if you run around the church that Sensations if you jump up you're working the people you know if the young people dancing shouting in the spirit see you're working them up there's that's sensation see they ain't got nothing real they better watch what they're saying about that they better watch what they're saying about it and they're criticizing because that could be the genuine thing it's true if you're crying boohoo that's just working them up see and so so many have have quoted me on these things where brother Brandon mentions about the mystery of receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation so they go send no sensation no sensation so they get a dead church if they have their way they'll have a dead Church where they just get up and do a little sermonette teach and all that and everybody amen amen and then they go home but everybody you know that believes the words got the Holy Ghost you know they just believe the word or just do what they say they want them to do you know just control but see so they they say well it's it's receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation that's what brother Brandon was getting to I got to ask you this on the day of Pentecost was that Sensations that they received they spoke in tongues they shouted they danced they staggered they staggered everybody say they staggered you know what staggering is we ain't dumb you know what staggering is staggering like a drunk man have you ever seen a drunk man much longer have you ever seen a drunk man they just stagger just staggering everywhere us you know everything looks nice to him but they were just staggering you know and some of them can be sweet and kind and actually loan you some money at that time because they're drunk they're they're intoxicated they don't know what they're doing they're just happy staggering you know the prophet said they staggered so much did they stagger that they thought they were drunk I I can talk to you about the Lord but you wouldn't think I'm just drunk but these men thought they were drunk they staggered you understand what I'm saying bet it wasn't Sensations you know what the Bible promised them you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost come upon you can you say man did Jesus lie or did he was he lying to him did they receive a sensation or did they receive power they received power and that power that they received made them act like that that power can make you roll on the floor it can make you act like a nut it can make you sit there amen and just laugh in the spirit have you ever seen someone just laugh in the spirit and just laugh and they laugh and they laugh and they're just laughing they're just having a ball they're caught up in somewhere you say oh that's fanaticism you better watch what you're saying about it hello remember brother Brown talked about that John Ryan there with that big old long beard and that shaggy hair you all remember that and he's sitting there at his table and asked him to pray over the food and he starts praying on food speaking in tongues start speaking in tongues and he started laughing said I didn't have a clue I don't know what was going on the man just started laughing then came over and started prophesying over him foreign at the dinner table you see they received power not Sensations hello see so if they done them things by sensation then we have to be careful about Sensations because if they've done that under sensation God approved of it and said that's my church and then he would send the prophet zealous go back to the original but I'm here to tell you I don't believe it was some sensation I know there's people that receive sensation and they really think they got the goods but I'm talking about a genuine Pentecostal experience they had something more than just a sensation it changed Peter's life it changed them can you say Amen so you shall receive power now notice Acts 2 and 1 and when the day of Pentecost was full to come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing might of the wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it's set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy ghosts and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance can you say Amen now notice what the prophet said was the Pentecostal Church a noisy church back at the beginning when the Holy Ghost fell first he said the Virgin Mary like she was drunk staggering under the power of God and all of them like that and the people said they're full of new wine that's the way the church was ordained that's the way every church was ordained and every time God has a church it'll be the same kind of church because it ain't no got no uncertain sound can you say amen he says in another place while they were influenced by the Holy Ghost they went into action staggering like drunk men screaming speaking in tongues out in the street they went oh church can you say Amen so we we find amen that that's what they've done under the Pentecostal power of God amen bro if we've got the fullness of God's power in this day don't tell me that you're just going to sit there be religious fighting devils no power it ain't gonna happen I I'm just I'm gonna be frank my name ain't Frank but I'm gonna be frank with you there's stuff about just you know guys having a hard time overcoming that pornography something wrong with that experience now don't get me wrong I know there's Temptations I understand a man will fall you know I I don't know how to that extent I'm not here can a man go out and get drunk take it take a drink and come back you know I'm not into all the depths of that at this point and today but I'm just telling you a man can fall and man makes mistakes and I don't know where all that borderline is and and so I'm not going there today but I'm just telling you this if he can't get out of the gutter you need the power of God if you can't be a Christian you need the power of God can you say Amen now that's what that Pentecostal experience was all about was the power of God do you believe that here's the power of God I'm not saying everybody has to speak in tongues that's not it but they did speak in tongues and then tongues are still in this church you say well I didn't speak in tongues well you know what God God used Israel one time to March around the city and then the next Generation God used him not to March around the city so they couldn't say well you know we got to do it the way Joshua did it we got to run around the city you know we got to March around seven days no God had a choir up there to sing song and he defeated the quiet or defeated the Enemy by that choir just singing so you understand what I'm saying God works in mysterious ways but that generation that sung them song couldn't look back and say well God won't do that anymore if God wanted them to march around the city they'll do it if God wants us to do it today we'll do it and God can do whatever he wants to do praise the Lord thank you we don't put limits to God whatever God wants to do he's going to do it and we welcome it you understand what I'm saying there's people that dance because they got victory they got liberated other people get liberated and they cry I'll tell you one thing about it when when they get to live liberated no matter what they do when they get liberated they all live like Christians you understand what I'm saying but see it's a supernatural God so you can't put barriers you can't put God in a box if God is Supernatural in this body this church is the body of Christ let God be God [Music] then you say man so here we find the prophet said and when they was filled with the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit they went into action right quick out into the streets screaming dancing acting like drunk people speaking with other tongues and what a carry on notice they was in action right quick as soon as they humbled themselves went in and closed the door and waited on the word of God oh do you love him all right I'm not going to keep you much longer I've only got one service though but we won't keep you much longer now we find even in the Bible First Corinthians 14 35 wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tunnels is that Bible or not so we see there's a lot of confusion about tongues but there's a truth about speaking in tongues speaking in tongues are part of the nine spiritual gifts that belong in the church tongues are the least of the gifts not everyone speaks in tongues they're not the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost hello tongues are not an infallible Act of God that you have the Holy Ghost is that right so that's the truth about tongues brother Brown said which is Wizards snake handlers Devils everything else speak in tongues so therefore I say to you that tongues I want you to repeat after me tongues are not to have the preeminence in the church I'm gonna say that again tongues are not supposed to have preeminence in the church it's not to have preeminence over the word of God can you say Amen now the truth about tongues the Bible tells us that there are tongues of angels and there are tons of men which tells us there's known and unknown tongues right truth when the 120 spoken tongues at Pentecost they were not speaking in unknown tongues they were jabbering they didn't even know what they were saying hello but the others did amen true brother Brown said it wasn't an unknown tongue it was a language ain't that right Acts 2 6 verifies that and says every man heard them speak in his own language it was tongues to the man that was saying it because he didn't know but the man that was hearing it was his own language is that right remember the man Danny I think it was Danny that spoke in tongues I wasn't he going to go wasn't he going to go Shake brother Brown's hand or meet him or something like that when he got up there he just started speaking in tongues out loud when the church was over service is over had no idea what he was speaking wow three three French interpreters and all of them said that's French the man was speaking in tongues he didn't know French the Holy Ghost was speaking through him but these three people said it was French he was speaking in and brother Brown said okay don't say a word y'all all three write it down and it was the same exact thing they all heard the same exact thing so we we find that it is not scriptural to say that unknown tongues was at Pentecost it wasn't in it's not in Scripture unknown tongues was not at Pentecost can you say Amen when the Holy Ghost fell in the house of Cornelius the Bible says they spoke in tongues brother Brown said but the tongues were understood by those who heard ain't that right so for the apostles said the Holy Ghost fell on them as it fell on us at the beginning is that right so Lord willing I want to get more into that and and and and and and and study on these things but I dare not stand before you today and tell you that them things do not happen today because they do happen they can happen the more you humble yourself the more you yield yourself and get your doubt out of the way watch what will take place that's the point of the message does take us back to the original to where we can stand there and let God just pour himself into us not intellectually you can become intellectually about this Bible about this message because God God ain't glorified in your intellectualism God's glorified when he can have his way through you and the supernatural takes over your human body man praise the Lord and you say Amen so we find that the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues and that's that's where the genuine gift comes from it's a supernatural working of the Holy Ghost ain't that right so I say to you that tongues are important when the Holy Ghost is speaking them right now brother Brandon says modern Pentecostals say that they can receive the Holy Ghost speaking in unknown or Angelic tongues that's that's what modern Pentecostals say brother Brown said they have the cart before the horse for in Acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect dialect which even unbelievers heard and understood ain't that right he goes on I hope there's all right brother Brown says tons of angels that's the man in private prayer out yonder somewhere speaking to God speaking to God in Angelic tongues yeah he said I could just call you a case right now that water is good he said you remember when the woman come to the auditorium there and where Dr Alexander dowey's from Zion said you remember me down there and Billy come after me down there to get me to go to the meeting and I said Billy going back he said what you crying about somebody been here and I said no sir you go on back tell brother Baxter to preach tonight and I got down on the floor and I said Lord what's the matter with me and all of a sudden I heard somebody at the door speaking in other languages and I thought it was German and I thought well that fellas come up to get him and he said I stopped you know praying and I listened at him standing there like this and I thought well how that guy will ever understand that because I know the man that run the that Motel about five miles out of the city you know and I had to get out of out there so many people around a small town and I said well that's strange and I said there but well boy did you ever hear that he said God don't even get his breath hardly see I was thinking that hard as he was speaking well I said well why it was me it was him the one that was speaking in tongues and I just kept Real Steel and he didn't say any just kept Real Steel after a while he got through speaking he got through speaking and when it did it felt like I could run through a troop and leap over a wall foreign and I went out and Billy was going out the gate and I hollered at him wait a minute and he come back he had been drinking a soda pop and he said Daddy what's the matter and I said just wait just a minute I'm going with you he said I started washing my face real quick he said what's the matter he knows better than talk to me see going through the meeting and he said what's the matter I said nothing nothing not at all just go ahead do the meeting we went on to the meeting brother Baxter was sitting there playing nothing between my soul and the savior he come in he said I thought you wasn't going to make it you're coming and I said you know and went on up and started just started preaching and when I got through about time I got through preaching well boy somebody like took the back of the building back there in that back Auditorium running extension mic back there and there was a woman back there just walking up and down that aisle shouting as hard as she could come to find out she had TB and they left Twin Cities Saint Paul the ambulance wouldn't bring her because they was afraid she would burst her lungs the doctor said anything her lungs was like Honeycombs if they ever broke should be dead that'd be all and some saints took an old 38 Chevy Chevrolet car and took the back seat and fixed it up and put her in there and was over the on the road over and they hit a little bump or something another down there and she started hemorrhaging and she just started spurting the blood right out it was going through her nose and everything like that and she got weaker and weaker finally she didn't want to die in that car she told them to stop and she put her and put her on the grass on the on a grass plat and they picked her out and and uh and they was all standing over her praying and all of a sudden she said something struck her and up she got and away she went shouting down that road as hard as she could here she was at church just walking up and down the aisle and I said sister what time was that and it was exactly the same time the Holy Spirit was speaking through me what was it gifts can you say Amen yes sir see that was the Holy Ghost making intercession Ryan speaking in tongues through brother Branham making intercessions for that lady see said God sent a gift to the earth and the Holy Spirit just couldn't wait any longer so he just come took me over and began to speak back himself like that see making intercessions himself and as we check the time that very same minute they put her on that plaque like that they wanted to see because they know she was dying they'd have to say the time she died it was that very minute that the Holy Spirit fell upon me up there and began to make intercession utterance words they can't understand them see giving like see giving utterance that's the Holy Spirit speaking and you say man but we find out that unknown tongues are not to be spoken in the church unless there's an interpreter that can give the interpretation to them tongues ain't that right First Corinthians 4 20 14 28 if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church someone say well you know they asked brother Branham well can can if if I've got something to say you know and I just got to say it he said you can wait you can wait remember they all jumped up every time I was trying to preach he said that's that's out of order it's disorder he said you can wait because the holy spirit's a gentleman and he wouldn't be up here on the platform anointing the prophet a preacher and then anoint them to interrupt you say well I can't remember what I was going to say it ain't you anyways you just yelled yourself in the Holy Ghost remember he'll know him speaking with the infinite mind right So speaking of unknown tongue does not edify the church unless it is interpreted can you say man but rather it edifies the individual that's speaking it that's what brother bran was saying that there and then you go to First Corinthians 14 and 4. and I'll close here but he says he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifyth himself but he that prophesies edify the church the whole point in the church is to be edified if you sing songs Let It edify If You Preach let it edify if you prophesy Let It Be edifying you hold an office in the church Let It Be edifying everything that is done in the church it has to be for the edification of the church can you say Amen or if if it's not then it's it's not profiting so he says see I would that you all speak with tongues but rather that you prophesy for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speak with tongues why would he say that I believe it was the prophet that said because he that prophesied edify at the church it's edification so he said see uh except he he said for he greater is he that prophesieth than he that speak with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying you go to the 13th verse break it in let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret for if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful amen amen you love the Lord I love him so here just to go on for a moment John 15 5 Jesus says I am the vine and you are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same brings forth much fruit for without me you can't do nothing so brother Brown says every church that rises out of that vine will be a Pentecostal Church he said the prophet of God said this Pentecost began without an ending everybody say Pentecost began without an ending it's to be to every creature old times at all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people and what are what is the Pentecostal blessings it's the confirmation of Jesus Christ and you say Amen or it's the confirmation of the Resurrection so the Pentecostal blessing is the confirmation of the Resurrection you see why we want to always keep that Pentecostal act uh uh uh experience with us keep that Pentecostal blessing with us because it's the confirmation of the Resurrection you can go to church and and just go to church and be acting intellectual but that has nothing to do with the confirmation of Resurrection Jesus Christ is risen do you believe it this message is a it is a message that he has risen from the dead and this church has the Pentecostal blessings to show confirmation to that the true church and you say man so I read this last Sunday the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that first early that early first one and The Messengers to the churches have the having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who was free of all men sowed out to God and gave forth the word of God to only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would do see so you have to work from the original as light begets like the true church will always be uh the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age can you say Amen if the musicians will come so the way that we can judge what the true church was at Pentecost and what she was in in the apostolic age is by what we see in the word in the book of Acts and by what we see that's what the church today will try to approximate she will be just like that original she will believe in them things can you say Amen and it's so valuable so valuable today to listen to these things and to know this because here we are 60 years you would have never found message preachers in brother by Adam's age well brother Brandon was alive or even a little bit after trying to convince the people that there's no such things as gifts anymore there's no such things as emotions anymore there's no such thing one man told the church in Ohio the other day you know how how he received it and he talking about how that these people on the floor that's just emotional that's just show I thought buddy you wouldn't have lasted along with a prophet on Earth but here at 60 years now so these men are creeping in why because they feel like they have enough backing now to get us away from that original just think of it now the Nicolaitans came in just shortly after Pentecost true hello but here we are 60 years or so since brother branham's been gone close to it and now they're trying to pervert our young people this Young Generation now you don't need that well until you can show me where brother Brown said you don't need that I'll believe what brother Branham said and he said the birth is messy Annie birth is messy any birth but I will tell you you get a birth it'll be a genuine thing like it was on the day of Pentecost and tell us gifts ain't in operation show me verbatim where brother Brian said that brother Amos where did he say it and yet I'll show you ever even in the third pool brother Jesus died rejected at third pool ministry right it's because of his third pool Ministry he's hanging on the cross because his third book of ministry and yet he's spoke in tongues unknown tongues so the polls have nothing to do with the Pentecostal experience what I'm talking about is a Pentecostal experience can you say man and if we're in the fullness of the word fullness we ain't picking and choosing Wayne Got A Part here and a part there and leaving this out and all that out no fullness of the word takes it all and that's why brother Brown said well Paul preached I preached the same well Paul's the one that set the gifts in the church and I can guarantee you brother Brandon preached the same then you say Amen we got that Plus you love him isn't he wonderful Hallelujah I love the Lord brother random says here he says if if the holy spirit that you profess to have is not making you live like they did in the book of Acts and your life could write another book you better take warning if the first Vine brought forth the Pentecostal Church the second Vine or Branch rather out of the vine will bring forth another Pentecostal church with the Pentecostal experience bearing the same fruits that the first church had it'll speak in tongues and have power in the signs of the resurrected Christ in it if you're going to be a Christian now I'm just reading different quotes but he said if you're going to be a Christian you have to go back and the first church that God ever ordained was at the day of Pentecost it was a Pentecostal believing church with the Pentecostal experience the first church was a Pentecostal Church filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders and miracles accompanying it and if God is an infinite God and set his church in order like that on the day of Pentecost every time he sets the church in order will be the same thing has to be because he's infinite and cannot change our doctrines and theology has taken us off to one side till we're wandering in the wilderness then another place go back to that original Pentecost don't get away from there if when you do you're lost stay with that blessing didn't you see man there's an original Pentecost there's an original in feeling with the Holy Ghost there are original signs and wonders there is an original Church [Music] and that's what we are part of is that original seat can you say man do you love the Lord I trust it was a help to you today amen praise the Lord what song I want to live
