removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Sal amen you can have your seats this morning and um I guess the past few Services we just kind of talked upon or use the title he is a present help in trouble and I'm glad that he is and um that uh it is written that we could be reminded of it amen that God is a help a present help when we think of times of trouble maybe we can think of many instances in the Bible where uh God was a present hell and we could go all the way back in the beginning after that Adam had fallen and um the holy image of God left him and and there he was U become a sinner um because of his Disobedience no hope um ever getting back to God no hope of Fellowship he was under that the law of god of death and yet God was a present help in the time of trouble and God provided an atonement we could look at Noah and how that God was fixing to um uh destroy the Earth and bring judgments upon the land that God was a present help to that righteous group that had elect Amen in Noah's day you can look at shamard and how that the enemy had been coming in and taking his crops and and and but God was a present help in the time of trouble and and shamard the Bible says he he just took an ox gold and slew 600 I believe Philistines that day amen you could look at Rahab the Harlot and of how that um um Joshua coming in and and uh um they're going to take that City and the walls you know uh the people in that city is under judgment and uh and and they all knew it they they were quaking scared but there Rahab the Harlot and she didn't deserve Mercy but she was kind to uh the Servants of the Lord and God God was a present help in the time of trouble for her and and her and her family under that token amen was spared the three Hebrew children God was a present help the Apostle Paul when he was Shipwrecked there and out on that island God was a a a present help in the time of trouble see it's always been that God has has always been there and and I'm I'm sure that we could all look and and in our personal lives and and think of instances of where God was a present help in the time of our trouble amen and in the Old Testament we look and how that uh uh uh God was a present help to the nation of Israel and uh God had uh uh told you know uh uh Abraham that that he seed uh him and his seed would possess the gates of their enemy and here Israel was in bondage for 400 years to the Egyptians and and uh uh uh hard hard labor uh uh great stress and their backs beaten and all of these things but God had made an unconditional Covenant to to Abraham that that they would sojourn into this land for 400 years but at that time I would deliver them and so uh uh uh uh God had made this Covenant and and not only that uh uh he had given them a land of inheritance before they had ever become slaves and and uh you look at Deuteronomy 15:4 it says the Lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance an to possess it amen and and under this promise that God would give Abraham uh uh they would become a mighty nation and they would possess the gates of their enemy and and God also promised that uh uh the the the that they wouldn't just remain they wouldn't be slaves uh uh forever but that he would come and and deliver them and and so uh uh it was after the 400 years the 400 years somewhere in there that uh the Bible says that Israel began to cry out unto God uh for deliverance and and and God God uh the Bible says here in Exodus 2 24 God heard their groaning God heard their groaning now they weren't crying for you know uh a a a new house or a new pickup truck or they weren't crying about little things that maybe we cry about but they were crying for the right purpose they they wanted Deliverance amen from the bondage that they were in they they wanted a living God to come and and to to deliver them and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them aren't you glad for that amen so God was a present help in the time of trouble and God delivered them from the hand of of the enemy amen now they they after they had come through out of Egypt now they had to make their Journey uh uh to the land of inheritance that God had given them and and so uh but you look at Israel Israel didn't come out of Egypt a well equipped Army a military might a military power uh they they were just Shepherds they they were defenseless and and and they they come out they they didn't have doctors they didn't have nurses they didn't have Medical Aid they didn't have anything even brother BR said they didn't even have Red Cross amen uh uh that would follow them they didn't even have clothed stores that that they could pass uh as they're they're they're you know going going to the the the the Homeland amen but the thing of it is they didn't need it any of these things for God was a present help in the time of trouble amen he was a present help Exodus 23:20 God would tell them behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared amen now that was enough God didn't have to go through detail of how he was going to do it he just said I'm going to bring thee into the land which I have prepared amen and whatever it takes to bring you there I will be a present help in the time of trouble and we find that God God preserved their clothes and and how he done it I don't know but we know good and well that they were years uh traveling in the promised land and and there was children that started out maybe babies that had had started out of Egypt and and and they as they grew somehow or another their clothes were preserved there and their clothes either grew with them or or whatever but God clothed them God took care of them when they needed food God fed them amen sent food out of the heaven Amen to to sustain them when they needed water amen uh God provided a rock and the Bible says that rock followed them through the Wilderness and that Rock Paul says was Christ amen and it wasn't just a little trickle of water coming out it had to water not only 2 and a half million people but it had to water all the livestock and all of these things and it was such a great force of water that come out of that rock that even the the the Nations amen uh uh uh that were maybe downhill from it or whatever amen benefited from the water that flowed unto them amen see God was a present help to his people amen see and and so he sent that angel and and that angel was the angel of the Covenant which we know was Jesus Christ amen and that angel God kept them from being destroyed he kept them from being cursed by balum he kept them from dying of thirst and hunger amen even when sickness come into the camp God was present there amen and provided an atonement amen uh uh that they could recover from their sickness think of that amen God wasn't there just as a as a a judgment that they would be destroyed like uh uh like so many other nations amen but this was a people of God that and and we know why God you know why the the fiery serpents came God sent fiery serpents into the of Israel for their murmuring and they complaining and they griping against Moses and against God and and all of these things and he sent fiery serpents that and and admit the people that many of them died amen and if God had not been there as a present help to show Mercy unto them amen all of Israel would have been wiped out but God was there as a present help amen I'm so glad for that amen see so God made sure that the people made it amen to to wherever he was leading them amen now notice that Jesus left us a promise in John 14 And1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you aren't you glad for that and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also amen now that's a promise that is what God has determined is that he would go to prepare a place that where you he is you may be there also now in the journey there there's been sickness there's been all kinds of things Amen to try to stop us and to destroy us amen but I'm so glad glad that God is a present help in the time of trouble amen see God is going to keep his word amen concerning us do you believe that he kept his word for a natural people and he's going to keep his word for his spiritual people amen amen now that natural people was a natural Seed of Abraham but we are of the faith Seed of Abraham of that rawal seed a super seed a super race a super super Church ain't ain't that right so God is going to keep his word and everything that we have need of uh is ours that's right amen that's what a prophet said everything that you have need of is yours and notice where he takes that scripture mark 11:24 whatsoever what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them aren't you glad for that amen I I'm I'm glad that there is a people amen that that is not looking for the now but they're looking for the future and they're saying God you promised me you you you you've given me a place you've you've given me a direction you've given me a destiny father amen I'm not looking for the now I'm not just looking for all around I'm looking for that amen and I need the grace Amen to get there I need the strength to get there I I I I need whatever amen it takes to get me there I need it amen see now God has given us the strongest weapon there is in all the world and that's prayer amen the prophet said the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them as any or anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believeing amen now as Believers we we realize that we're living in the mill ofcs of time amen church we ain't got much time Amen to to be uh playing around amen we ain't got much time to be holding grudges we ain't got time Amen to to to be looking at the world and being entertain AED and enticed by the things of the world we're living in the middle ofcs of time if there's ever a time that we need to be prayed up it's now if there's ever a time that we need to get serious with God and serious with our Christian faith and serious about this message and serious about our personal lives amen it is now amen we ain't got time to be LAX we ain't got time to be lukewarm we ain't got time amen trying to decide what we want to do amen whether we want to follow God all the way or or or or whatever see amen see and just uh I I believe that we're living in such a time I I maybe we don't even realize how late we uh uh the hour is but but we're really living in in the milliseconds amen and just as it was in in uh the last few hours of Jesus's uh mortal life a uh uh more prophecies are being fulfilled in uh uh today then then uh any other of the six Church ages uh uh uh you know all the prophecies concerning Jesus's life there was more fulfilled in the hour the last hour of his life here on this Earth than there was the rest of his life see and I believe that's the same way prophecy after prophecy after prophecy is being fulfilled in this in this time that we're living in amen and so one of the prophecy sees that that speak of this day is found in uh Daniel 12 and 1 it says and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble everybody say a time of trouble there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since before uh the uh since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people Amen brother Braham said thy people 144,000 Jews shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book now now think of that no there there's never going to be a time of trouble like coming amen you think you've got trouble amen there ain't no trouble like the trouble that is is coming amen the time of trouble amen now that time of trouble is the Great Tribulation uh which is at at hand and and and so uh uh uh this time of trouble amen is not just a personal trouble that maybe you go through we all have personal troubles we we go through things that we've got to overcome we've got to ask God for help amen we've got to ask God to to deliver us to to to keep us to preserve us and all of these things I uh you know but this time of trouble is going to be for the whole world Amen Ain ain't just one nation going to go through it not just one group of people but the whole world is going to be affected by this time of trouble amen you see in this time of trouble The Mercy Seat now becomes the Judgment seat because there's no blood upon the altar there's no blood left uh uh upon the seat amen now another scripture for us to ponder is found in in Psalms 27 1-5 it says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail though and ho should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble everybody say in the time of trouble amen he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock now believe uh here we read where Daniel's talking about a time of trouble like never before uh coming upon the Earth amen and I believe that David is talking about that same time of trouble amen see uh speaking of the same thing that Daniel is and and Daniel is speaking of the elected group of of Jews being delivered in the time of trouble amen uh uh at that time all thy people which is written in the book shall be delivered amen but notice David is speaking of another group amen and that is the Gentile bride being hid away at the time of trouble in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion amen I'm going to be safe in this time of trouble amen I'm going to be protected from it can you say amen amen see so now brother brandham took this prophecy for that was a prophecy that we just read amen he took that prophecy and he used it as an opening his opening scripture when he preached on the Rapture amen the Rapture he tied the Rapture of the Bride to that scripture being hid away in the time of trouble amen he's going to hide me amen and and so now brother brandham says Any teacher uh that that uh knows that the church Church goes in the Rapture before the tribulation sets in aren't you glad for that amen a time of trouble amen is coming church amen like you've never seen before amen and you don't want to be left behind amen but thank God he's a present help in the time of trouble amen that he will cide us away amen and keep us now what is the Tribulation it is a time of purification purification it means cleansing sanctifying uh uh uh purifying see and so it's it's a getting rid of all the filth and all the ugliness and and all the things that are unpure see and so we find that the Earth has to go through purification amen the church not the bride but the church has to go through purification the foolish virgin see amen and remember uh uh brother Brown said she doesn't go through the tribulation to get saved because she already is saved notice he said the sleeping virgin the Gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride and she only goes through the tribulation see period for the time of purification because she has rejected Christ the word for her purific then she has to suffer for her Deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of Christ because he is the word can you say Amen So speaking of the the foolish virgin she is not saved during that time she's saved now from Eternal death but she'll have to go through the tribulation period for the purification ain't that right so then we find that the the 144,000 Jews must go through purification as well see so the bride of Christ is the only one that does not go through the tribulation amen she's the only one that does not have to be purified and God is a present help in the time of her trouble trouble coming but God shows himself to be a present help I'm so glad for that amen the prophet said the reason why she doesn't go through it is the bride is Forgiven aren't you glad you're forgiven amen I the bride Is Forgiven so she goes straight to glory in a Rapture amen well what purifies her she is purified the prophet said by the blood of Jesus Christ she needs no purification see Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Jesus Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death so there is no condemnation against her in her upon her amen She is totally free from the condemnation amen John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is pass from Death unto life oh I'm so glad for that see that's a promise there amen God knows exactly what he's doing amen now church he knows what all the trouble is in this world he knows it the the people may not know it amen the politicians don't know it the sinner doesn't understand everything they know trouble's coming they don't understand it but God knows amen God knows see and he he's not about to fix it all amen but what he is going to do he's going to take you out of this amen he's here as a present help Amen in the time of trouble to hide you away amen now brother Brown said see would you choose a woman you had to purify before you married her well see Christ's bride is chosen and she is elected and she is God's bride the Bride of Jesus Christ another place God gave the promise that we would not eat even stand at the Judgment so freely did he take my place until I'm absolutely free and when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned how can he take me out of the pawn shop I've got a clear receipt see how can he be my redeemer and take me from the pawn shop and the broker still say I belong to him amen you understand that amen Satan will lied to us and so so sad that many of us believe he lies but I'm telling you amen Jesus Christ is your Redeemer he's got the receipt that he paid the price and now Satan has no claim upon you you're you're Justified you're free how many's free you believe that you're free Hallelujah see amen see so he says see uh uh uh how can he be my redeemer Jesus and take me from the pawn shop and the broker of the devil still say I belong to him he said I've got a written receipt amen I've got this I've got the message that tells me that I'm Justified I never did it in the first place I've got a re written receipt wrote by the blood of Jesus Christ now Church you know the the the prophet said that the word is a bloody bleeding word amen that receipt amen is dripping with blood amen yes sir see so we're living in a time of trouble today we're living in a time of trouble and and brother brandham would call it a dark day the time of trouble it's a dark day amen and and so a day of Darkness now the Bible has already prophesied of it Isaiah 60 and2 be before Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people so this is a time of trouble amen Darkness covering the Earth gross Darkness covering the people it's over the people it's possessing the people the people are blinded it's a time of trouble and and and a trouble a time like never before known upon the Earth amen see and so what is this gross Darkness amen the prophet would call it dark hearts or unbelief amen see and it's speaking of this leodys and age brother Bram said this Le oysan age goes into total darkness see and it isn't going to get brighter there is no politician that's going to make it brighter for you amen the only thing that can make it brighter is the word of God Amen for this age do you believe that amen so then it's only going to get darker and darker and darker amen it it's just that way amen and what is it the prophet said the Gentiles are shutting their hearts from the message amen they sit in unbelief you know we have the biggest churches and when I say we I'm talking about just christiandom amen but we have the biggest churches than ever before amen I think Oklahoma just toss so Al's got you know two or probably three or four churches with no less than 5,000 members in it and and you know we we've got these things we've got the best dressed people the best fed people the you know more money than we've ever had before and yet the prophet says we've got more sickness than ever before we have more ad adultery than ever before we've got more sin than ever before amen and and brother Bram said it's because we've got more unbelief than there ever was in this day why because gross darkness is come uh and and and the Darkness is cover the Earth gross Darkness the people and the people are sitting with more unbelief than in in in the time of History amen and the prophet says that you know he's talking about Satan uh I think it's the God of this evil age amen uh Satan the God of this world says he is making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of God Amen they're preaching their own knowledge they're declaring their own knowledge apart from this word but this is the knowledge you ought to be conscious of this is the knowledge that you ought to know not not the knowledge of news not the knowledge of science not the knowledge of a politician not the knowledge of of education but the knowledge of this word can you say amen amen he said see uh uh uh he's he he says he's making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never-failing word of God but by his coming together in denominations and Creeds and intellectual and scientific and so forth he is making a better world for man to live in and ignoring the promise of God that the only time the world will be fit to live in is in the Millennium do you understand that church the only time for this world to be fit to live in is in the Millennium that's right see you know my opinion he's made a better world to sin in instead of to live in amen another place he says he's made it a better place to die in than to live in sir what is it it's gross Darkness so what's caused the unbelief and and well in one place he says denominational seeds being planted brought forth more unbelief all the time another place ministers has organized themselves and got great denominations and taken in anything and so forth and just anything making a church member see and so then then we find that according to Isaiah's prophecy that we just read Isaiah UH 60 and2 two things are happening at the same time so let's just read that again and start at the first verse Isaiah 61 arise shine everybody say arise shine sh arise Shine for thy light is come oh a present help in the time of trouble arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord everybody say the Lord see shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee now we know what this is It's the revealing of the son of man the light that is risen upon thee amen uh uh and His glory being seen upon thee is the son of man being revealed promised in Luke 17:30 so not everyone is is part of this dark day or this time of trouble amen see they're not part of this see because there is a light shining in the darkness in the time of trouble amen oh aren't you glad for that amen yes sir see great lack the prophet said is breaking forth from the kingdom of God to take its place of this gross Darkness coming upon the Earth amen thinking of this light first John 1:5 tells us that God is light so this light that Isaiah is talking about is not coming from any other source than God himself God is light amen Jesus said I am the light of the world now it's not two lights two different lights it's it's one light can you say amen God is light amen see and it was God in Christ the Bible says reconciling himself at the world to himself God in Christ manifesting himself to the world the Bible would also say in him in Christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily amen therefore the light had become flesh in the body of Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that now Isaiah 49 and6 God for told of Jesus coming to the Earth he said it it is a like thing that you that thou should us be my servant uh uh to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the Earth think of that I will give thee a light to the Gentiles amen Not only was he going to restore Israel amen and and uh uh uh the elect of Israel but he would be given as a light to us Gentiles that he may be the Sal ation amen unto the end of the Earth amen now when Simeon saw the Christ child there in uh Luke 2:30 we read that he said mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel oh my so in this day of of Darkness this this time of trouble amen see that's coming upon the the face of the Earth Christ is a present help Amen to us amen if you notice what David said there in Psalms 27 and one again the Lord everybody say the Lord the Lord is my light and my salvation which when he came it was in Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that the Lord is the strength or sustainer of my life of whom shall I be afraid amen so the light that is shining upon thee in this age is the Lord himself Jesus Christ amen now if you look at it in Psalms 119 and 115 it says Thy word everybody say Thy word is a light is a light unto my path you see the prophet would tell us today the light of God is the word of God made manifest that's the light made manifest see the Lord is my light that's what the psalmist said and then he turns around and says Thy word is is my light the Lord is my light and thy word is my light see not the letter of the word amen that that's not it the prophet would tell us it's the spirit of the word which is the Lord himself can you say Amen it's the spirit of the word that is quickening the letter of the word quickening that word into us and making it live aren't you glad for that trying to show you the Lord is our present help amen people wondering where the Lord is I'm telling you where it's at he's your present help in the word made manifest in this age for he is our light gross Darkness covering the people gross Darkness on the Earth but there is a light that is keeping the darkness away from you aren't you glad for that now so brother Braham said see the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form then when you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts and acts can you say Amen so many people in churches today serving a god of history but God is a present help in the time of trouble how do we know that he's present is because this word is being made manifest now think of it 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen the spirit of the word is the Lord himself amen not just some emotion not just something that gets us excited but the spirit of the word comes upon the word and it quickens it to our hearts if that same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ and raised him from the dead if that dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal Spirit or your mortal body ain't that right so the light that is shining in this dark day in this time of trouble is the word being manifested by the spirit of the word the Lord this is why we can say that brother brandham was beyond the shadow of a doubt the prophet of Malachi 4 can you say Amen why the light came and it manifested the the the word of Malachi 4 and it become flesh we're not looking for a prophet of Malachi 4 we can truly say he's come and we can identify it as brother brandham being Malachi the prophet of Malachi 4 amen we're not looking for names brother brandham was that one he was the prophet that God promised the sin he was the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 so so we're not looking for a seventh angel to come we're not there and there's no scripture for an eighth angel either to come amen so we're not looking for eighth Angel eighth messenger the angel the seventh angel has come and we're not looking for a name to place it upon we know who it was it was brother brandom he was the seventh angel can you say Amen see the light has come the scriptures have been manifested to us and fulfilled his ministry fulfilled Luke 17:30 it fulfilled Zechariah 4 it fulfilled Daniel 2:45 and so many other scriptures in the Bible that we could just keep going going going amen his message was connected to Matthew 25 amen the voice of the bridegroom for brother brandom said The bridegroom's Voice or the the the the the call of the bridegroom will come out of this talking about the message can you say amen amen amen it was also his ministry was connected to first Thessalonians 4:16 can you say amen that's right see so now how do we know all of this how do we know that God had come in this time and took a a a a a a man by the name of William brandham and fulfilled the the scriptures by his ministry well the same Supernatural sign that was performed before uh uh to to Abraham and to Sarah to prove that God was present with them that it wasn't just an ordinary man standing there but it was God himself can you say Amen that same sign was also performed in our day to let us know that it was more than just a prophet that came to us it was God manifesting himself through that body can you say amen God performed that sign the first time in a word body brother Bram called it a theophany amen then he Al then he come down later and formed that same sign in a body that was created in the womb of Mary then he he died he he shed his blood and now all the way down to this age he's been able to take a redeemed body come into that body and perform the same sign that he did to Abraham and Sarah aren't you glad for that it was God in flesh we do not believe that brother Brandon was God that's right some some goofballs do and and they are deceived of the devil to worship brother brandom and to say that he was God that's that's false brother Bram hit against that you know good and well he did right we don't believe in such a thing but we do believe that he was the vessel that God used to identify himself as a present help in the time of trouble you believe it this is why we hold to this message with everything that's within us we're not looking for no new message we're not looking in being entertained by everything else God sent us a prophet God identified himself in that Prophet not just to tickle our fancy but as a present help in the time of trouble can you say Amen brother Braham said today that we're now living in God has come on the scene to vindicate and prove his promises so is the light of the hour so we can Rise and Shine the light shines upon us again today the word is being made manifest it's the promised light aren't you glad for that oh my not a star light not electrical light but a Divine Light the very light that God promised to send in the age of Darkness amen darkest age the most time of trouble than ever before and God would send a light to shine upon us so we can truly say he is here as a present help in the time of trouble can you say Amen now if he is present and he's here as a help in time of trouble what kind of a help is he is he here to help to get America running again is he here to help you in this time of season to help you fulfill your wish list is he here to help you know uh us As Americans to conquer the other nations what kind of a help is he he's a present help in time of trouble so you know if you looking a lot of people looking at thing life and these events and all these things in so many different directions so is is God a present help to help us as a America to become respected again among the Nations well I'll tell you what kind of a help he is because if you can identify him that he come and you can see him through the eyes of the message and what he is here what this message had to do what it was for how it is to affect us 1 Thessalonians 4:16 says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a what a shout and the prophet said that's the message and you say Amen so the prophet didn't come to get us wrapped up in politics I know we all use that well brother Randon was in politics you know he voted and he done this you missed the whole stinking point most people that are voting is for America to becom Great again but God isn't a help for that because the prophet said the world is getting darker and darker and darker it's going to continue to get dark this world he's already preached the messages this world is falling apart he said you can put Abraham Lincoln's in every County you can put George Washington's and every whatever it will never help so if you're looking for God to be a present help in that way you're going to be disappointed but it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout he's going to come to help he sent a message with a shout with the voice of the AR AR angel with the Trump of God and notice now what is this going to do is it going to make the economy work is it going to bring the inflation down again no the dead in Christ are going to rise again the dead in Christ shall rise first then we everybody say we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord I say he is a present help in time of trouble hiding us away if you don't know the time and season you're living in God does God never sent this message before time in other words so we got you know a hundred years left or uh 200 years left and so he brings a message to get us Rapture Ready to get out of here and now what do we do we just waiting for America to become great and we looking for all peace in the world and we're looking for Unity in the Nations no you realize the events that are taking place is simply because the world is falling apart hello so we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord you see he is here everybody say is here do you believe he's here well if you believe the message then you got to know he's here because brother Braham said I'm here to declare his presence that he's here that's what his ministry was to do to let us know Jesus Christ is here not a god of History this Prophet brought him out of history and if we put him as a god of History it's our fault if we put him as a god of yesterday a god of brother brandham and cannot be a god for us it's our fault because that's not true the god of brother brandham should be a god of you should be the god of sister Melissa weeks as much as it is to brother brandham it should be a god of Shawn Martin as much as it was to brother brandham can you say Amen so what is he here for he's here as a present help to bring on the first resurrection ction he's here as a present help to change our vile bodies like unto his own body he's here to catch us away hello as a present help notice Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring brother br so that's the tital Ws that's happening these that that scripture fulfilling for our day you're living in prophetic scriptures being fulfilled today men's Hearts failing them for fear looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man or we'll call it the Lord himself hello you can call it the Lord himself the son of man the mighty angel coming down from heaven but it is the revealing of the son of man then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud not a Thunderhead Cloud now we know it's not a Thunderhead Cloud it was a cloud of seven angels can you say Amen coming in a cloud with what power and great Glory that's right what was the power for to cause you to speak in tongues no what was the power for what what was it that cause you to run over the floor and feel good no hello coming with power and great Glory notice and when these things begin to come to pass look up look up everybody say look up and lift up your head for your re Redemption draweth nigh so in 1963 he come in a cloud of angels he came in a cloud with power everybody say with power and great Glory ain't that right now so if you look at and in the Old Testament there was a type and that was Rebecca she was the type of the bride of Christ for today and remember when eler came to her home Hometown to get a bride for Isaac which he was a type of Jesus Christ Isaac see she was she was the one she was the only one that met the qualifications that elaser had notice what she did she watered she watered the camels that elaser brought with him and and the prophet said animal represents power see the animal represented power the very animal that she was watering was the very animal that packed her to see her bridegroom El eer came equipped he came with something to take her with him could you imagine him just coming on his own camel look look look look look Rebecca you want to go yeah I'll go sorry we both can't fit on this animal we both can't fit on this camel but he brought something with him to carry her to take her wherever he's going can you say amen that's right and the son of man did not come alone he didn't come to get a bride and not have something there to take her with him are you with me but he came with power as elaser come with a camel so he came with power hello now notice because brother BR said the very power that we're watering you're watering oh come on Church Rebecca had to do something too that's right she had to water the camel amen your camel is the power that he that the son of man has come with he came with power and you're not just to sit there as a not on a log and just say well I know you you know and and and I don't believe that we got them here but you you you get people that just feel qualified to pick a church apart that they just feel that's their job they'll pick the preacher apart they'll pick the singing apart they'll pick the musicians apart they'll pick the sound apart the sound guys the deacons they'll pick they'll pick the person they're sitting with theart it just it's just it's just constantly they can't be satisfied but see what if Rebecca had that attitude what if she come look at at camel what did she come and looked at elaser he's got long nose hairs I don't like that guy I ain't going with him I don't like his accent right he can't say Pulpit right picking them apart but you know what the prophet said that the Angel Beat eler there a half hour before eler got there to that well the angel of the Lord beat him and half an hour before he got there and begin to talk to Rebecca and prepare her heart go to the well go to the well that's what the prophet said the angel tell go to the wh go go preparing her that when elaser got there she wasn't there scrutinizing him she wasn't there picking his gifts apart and his animals apart and you should have shampooed that you know that Camel I ain't getting on that Fleet bitten bum hello well church he came with power that's right we ain't here to pick things apart we're like a Rebecca was you've got to water it so the prophet said the very power that we're watering now with praises and Thanksgiving and glory and power and might is the very Holy Spirit that'll pack us up to see Jesus someday another place that the Church of the Living God today is rejoicing and watering the power of the Holy Ghost that'll pick her up someday and take her Yonder to meet the Isaac in the air for the wedding supper another place the power of the Holy Ghost that the church is watering and worshiping that is the thing that'll pack it from this Earth to meet the bridegroom no other age has the son of man come with power like he has in this age it was the son of man was not revealed on the day of Pentecost the son of man was not revealed in Paul's hour the son of man was not revealed only in this day just as it was in Jesus Christ same Ministry same power same life same anointing in this age the son of man revealed he came with power and the very power that he came with we're watering with our praises and our Thanksgiving and our worshiping why it's the very thing that's going to take us home come in this age in the time of trouble I hope this all right for you what what if he did not come equipped to take us home can you say Amen but he is a present help in time of trouble Isaiah 45 and 22 we know it God says look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I God and there is none else do you realize the prophet would take that scripture when he preached on look and and and he would take that and he would show us that that scripture is actually prophetic of this age we're at the ends ends plural of the earth we're at the end of time we're at the end of politics we're at the end of government we're at the end of mortal life we're at the end of everything everything has come to its end and at that time God would say look unto me I am the present help in the time of trouble look unto me and be ye saved yes sir amen and you sayen you see we see the Nations uniting the prophet said the churches are uniting communism is uniting in that message uniting time and signs I believe that's how he put it amen the title of it everything is uniting politics uniting Nations uniting you know e everything coming together it's all uniting but notice what a prophet said it's time everybody say it's time it's time that the Saints shall arise to unite with those that are living to go and Unite with Jesus Christ for eternity that's the time that we're living in church he is a present help in the time of trouble don't discount him don't short Change God like he doesn't know what he's doing God why are you allowing all this trouble why are you allowing the discomfort why are you allowing our taxes to go up and the inflation and everything else to go up why are you allowing it if you could only know that he's here as a present help not to make you comfortable in this life this world's got to fall apart but he's here he's came with power to take you home notice what God promised to do in this time Ezekiel 34 and12 as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the Cloudy and dark day so now God is Promised I'm going to seek out my sheep and I'm going to deliver them out of all places where they've been scattered in the cloudy and dark day now this is speaking of the elect being gathered together both the Jew and the Gentile see during the tribulation period God is going to call out his elect a Jew you know brother Braham said according to the election there will be 144,000 according to the election that will believe the message out of literally million that'll be there isn't that amazing and he said the same thing it is in the Gentile Church there is a bride and she is elected and he will be called according to the election so so notice he said this all types the church perfectly the elected Believers others do not believe you can just tell it you tell a man a truth and let it be proven by the word and then Vindicated well I don't believe it but see all that is written in the book shall be delivered there's not going to be one one predestinated seed Left Behind hello that's right we understand what's happening in the Jew in the Jewish the Jews have been scattered for what 2,000 years but all of a sudden that fig tree is starting to bloom amen it's starting to come and and the the blooming the budding of that that fig tree is the prophet would say was Israel becoming a nation so they have been been a nation since 19 what 48 46 something like that I think 48 may be declared but she's been a nation and just the other day the San Hedon Sanhedrin uh Council courts um uh joined together or came together and they all voted that all Jews must come home and they have sent out worldwide for all the Jews come home it's time come home whether you're American Jew Russian Jew polish jew all these things come on home it's time now church I don't know where all that is but I do know there's a prophecy that God promised he would bring all those his sheep back that's been scattered he's going to bring them back but also there's an elected bride that is going to be gathered too and she is being gathered under this message can you say Amen see it's a time of Deliverance amen a time of deliverance we know that you know the the the 144,000 God's going to visit them again their eyes are going to be opened and they're going to see the atonement they're going to see what you've been seeing they're going to see that that Christ was that true atonement and they're going to be brought back to that true atonement see and and but that's that's in the tribulation but God has been dealing with the elected Gentile that briad and he's been Gathering them and it's a time of Deliverance for them but not only just for her but also the earth the earth will be delivered and it's been in birth pains you go listen to birth pains brother Bram talks about the Earth it's it's starting to be in birth pains and it started showing the birth pains its first show of birth pains was in the world first world war and and he said it was one of the first birth Pains of her going into labor and he said because of that time for her we we had brought forth the bombs and we had machine guns and poison gas and he said everybody was scared to death of that great weapon of poison gas he said you know that was the first birth Pains of the Earth but then we had a second world war uh yeah second world war and and the Earth P the birth Pains of the earth become more greater and and it was at that time that the atomic bomb was invented and he said the Earth had to almost give way because it would destroy an entire city he said it was much greater pain of destruction of the earth than the Pains of the first world war and he said she knows that her time of Deliverance is at hand that's the reason she's so nervous flustrated as she is is because that there is an hydrogen bomb and missiles of the air that could destroy of the whole world not just a city the whole world and he said one nation is scared of the other no matter how little it is they got those missiles that they claim uh one of them they can direct them by the stars and drop them anywhere in the world they want to Russia he says as I've heard on the news the other day she claims that she can destroy this nation and keep the atoms or things from breaking up her Nation we don't know what to do about it everyone is making these claims and it's so see so people science has broken into God's Great laboratory until they're going to destroy themselves God lets always lets wisdom destroy himself see God doesn't destroy anything man destroys himself by wisdom and as he did at the beginning taking Satan's wisdom instead of God's word now she knows she must give way she cannot stand so the Earth knows that she can't stand any much longer we we've got missiles R Rush is even saying they've got they've got a what a bomb or a missile or whatever I can't remember what they even call it that is so fast that we can't even detect it and and and and and everything is being set up now they're talking about peace peace through strength but you remember what a prophet said Jesus said himself when they cry peace peace certain destruction can you say Amen but in the time of trouble he's a present help no wonder Satan attacks this message no wonder he gets our eyes looking at all the other things and maybe the negatives and maybe the things that we don't understand instead of looking at the positive things that is been made clear to us amen can you say Amen so here people and I won't take much longer but to think that people are looking to a political genius to stop the birth pains and bring peace to the earth I will tell you right now it will not happen whatever happens it will not stop the Perth paines it's time to go home it's time for this old corrupt world to give way to an eternal thing it's time for mortality to give way to immortality it's time for the governments of the earth that has been controlled by Satan to give way to a new government to a new kingdom and that's an eternal Kingdom can you say Amen now the prophet says the world knows that her birth pains are so great she's got to give away there's going to be a new birth born at hand and I'm thankful for that he said I'm tired of this one how many's tired of this one I'm tired of this one and anyone knows that here is the place here is a place of sorrow and death why would we want this to continue it's a place of corruption sh it's a place of evil it's a place that Satan controls all nations he's in control of it it's his these kingdoms of the Earth are Satan's right so anyone knows that it's a place of death and sorrow and all kinds of discrepancies and so forth but I'm glad that she has to give way I'm glad that the time is at hand as John said of even so come Lord Jesus can you say Amen oh to think of it a time of trouble and a time of Deliverance a time of trouble for the world but a time of Deliverance for God's elect Amen brother Bram said Jesus is here now and this is your opportunity this is the day of salvation now is the time call upon him this is the hour this is the time of Deliverance this is the time God's calling out his people not another time now is the day he's manifesting himself showing himself and we can truly say he is a present help in the time of trouble Hallelujah now if you look at it if you want to see how that God is a help to us in this day it's important to see how he works and brother Braham said when God is just about to do something to deliver his people God sends a message to the people it's so simple he says as we'll catch in the breaking of the seals he said but we find out in the breaking of the seals it's so simple that the smart miss it a million miles can you say Amen when God got ready to deliver his children from Egypt he sent a man named Moses to deliver them Moses was just an ordinary man that came from an ordinary Jewish Family his parents were just ordinary slaves nothing special about them they were just out there making brick for the enemy they were their backs were just as beaten as the others and scarred and all that but see from that family the prophet said God brought forth an order ordinary child a simple human being but that child was foreordained to be a deliver for God's people can you say Amen which shows us and brother Brandon would say this God had to let Moses be trained in all the wisdom of the world so that he would fall and make a mess of himself God had to let Moses be trained in all the wisdom of the world and become a a a man of might in in the in the nation of Egypt and all these things so that he would fall and make a mess of himself now why was this brother Brown said to show us that Deliverance does not come by the wisdom of the world don't look to a politician for deliverance that's right don't look for a denomination for deliverance don't look to yourself for deliverance can you say amen God had to let Moses fall so that we wouldn't be looking to some intellectual giant to bring Deliverance in this day brother Bram said God today is not going to deliver his people by education he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by theology he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by science he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by denomination he never promised to do it but he will deliver them by the power the supernatural power of the changing their lives and molding them into children of God aren't you glad for that you love the Lord amen as the musicians come God is a present help in the time of trouble God is a present help I'm so glad for that amen not only is he a present help in your in your person personal life when you're going through trials but if we could see him as a present help now as a way time of Deliverance is this what this message is is to bring us into a place to get us ready for Rapture to build
