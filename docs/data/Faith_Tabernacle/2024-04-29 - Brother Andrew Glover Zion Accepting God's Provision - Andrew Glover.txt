to look here and amen we want to just say God bless our pastor brother Sean here this morning for the vision of these meetings and the burden amen I believe there will be many many testimonies on that day for lives that's been touched and amen in the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and the first verse maybe before we read the word let's just bow our heads together for a word of prayer let's just ask the Lord to come how many would just say Lord come by my way and speak to me one more time amen Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this morning on this Resurrection Sunday father to the world it's not Easter on the calendar but Lord to every believer standing before me this morning oh God it is Easter for Lord you're not in a tomb but you are alive and well you're right here in the hearts of your children Lord you're right here today declaring your works and declaring you're the same yesterday today and forever and Lord we know that as we come to the close of these meetings today Lord we're so thankful that we're not serving a God that just visits with us in conventions or special meetings but Lord we have Assurance this morning that because you live We Live also and father when we leave these meetings you're going with us Lord you're going to continue to work through US father and Lord we want to thank you this morning just take a moment right now Lord

Holy Ghost in fire lord every vessel that received a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord we just want to take this moment right now and say thank you Lord father I pray that as we Endeavor to look into your word this morning Lord may you send the spirit of Revelation into the Tent today dear dear God lord may you break the strongholds of the enemy oh God and Lord if there be any Spirit still lingering around we're asking you this morning take your word and drive them out of the midst of your children oh God lord may we not leave here Lord father just thanking you Lord temporary but Lord

but Lord we're leaving here change for the future Lord men women boys and girls leaving these meetings it'll never be the same Lord we thank you this morning have your way among us and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory and the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen Psalms the 23rd chapter a very familiar verse here in Psalms 23:1 David here speaking of his confidence in God's grace he says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen the Lord is my shepherd he's making it personal I shall not want that word want means to diminish for the lack of need so David is saying I will not diminish because there's not a supply of what I have need of now in the Book of Psalms chapter 132 I have a couple other places I like to read this morning with you in Psalms chapter 132 and beginning there in the 13th verse David again writing says for the Lord hath chosen Zion I love that because it's past tense the Lord hath chosen Zion and he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will I dwell for I have desired it I will abundantly bless her provision I will satisfy her poror with bread I will also clothe her priest with salvation I love this and her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy there will I make the Horn of David to Bud I have ordained a lamp for m anointed I love this right here and his enemies will I clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish amen I believe this morning that God of David is our God here this morning one place in the New Testament in Philippians chapter 4 Philippians the 4th chapter and then the 19th verse Philippians 4 you love the Lord this morning amen Philippians chap 4: 19 I believe every one of us could read this from heart this morning the Bible says this but my god let's just read this together Philippians 4:19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus it that a beautiful promise God shall supply all of our needs we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this morning I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to speak to you today and if I I titled this today I want to speak to you on Zion accepting God's provision amen Zion accepting God's provision before we go any further I want to clarify that I am speaking to Zion this morning prophet of God said in the future home he said any time Zion is referred to he's ref referring to the Bride of Jesus Christ now uh brother bradam preaches a sermon I was listening to it the other day accepting God's provided way at the end time and he's opening there and he says now for a text I would like to speak from on this is accepting God's provided way for the end time he said let me quote that again because on the tapes I believe they're taping these messages and on the tapes that we have some 500 texts that I guess I've preached from he said they've got something similar to that but not exactly this so he's saying there's a lot of tapes out there and there's some that's similar to what I'm speaking on he says but not exactly this see accepting God's provided way at the end time he said you know there's many ways that people take but there's really only two ways that a man can go so there's many ways we can take but there's only two ways a man can go that's the right way and that's the wrong way and all of us here tonight he said we're on one of those roads the right or the wrong one see there's no middle ground Jesus said you cannot serve God and Mammon meaning the world Amen we're either right or we're wrong see if we'll just get away from our own way is the only way that we can get into God's way so amen I'll say this our way is wrong but God's way is right and the only way that we can get into God's way is we've got to get out of our way and God has made a provided way for everything amen God has made a provided way for everything amen he has provided the way so God Amen has not only made the way but he has provided the way he said where we get in trouble is not following that way and injecting into it our own ways and that makes a perversion and anything that is perverted is not Dependable amen so God has a way amen can I say this morning that the ways of God are not imperfect amen but the ways of God are perfect amen Proverbs 14:12 the Bible says there is a way amen which seeth right unto a man amen but the end thereof are the ways of death so if you're in a way amen the way is leading to a destination and there is a destination of death but there's also a destination of life and I say this morning there is a vast difference Amen in something that seems right and knowing that something is Right amen there's a big difference in thinking something is Right amen but then knowing that what you're walking in is right and I'll say this denominations are walking in the way amen which seeth right unto a man think about that they're walking in a way thatth right unto a man they are walking without an absolute amen so what they have to do is they have to choose amen which way that seems right unto their leader I want to say this morning we are not walking in our choice we are not walking in a man's choice we are not walking in a Bishop's choice we're not walking in a Pope's choice we're not walking in a district prp's Choice amen but we are walking in God's choice this morning amen therefore we're not baptized in a way that seems right amen we're not believing according to a way that seems right amen we're not shouting according to a way that seems right amen but this morning by the grace of God Amen we are testifying that we're walking in the way amen and it is a god-given way it is God's provided way brother said all the denominational ages of 900 and something different Protestant denomination He said Each one then of course you see their idea he said I can't blame them but each one claims that they are the truth amen 900 different denominations and every one of them amen are claiming that they are the truth and they have the truth amen and the people that belongs to those churches amen should believe that because they have stake their destination now watch this their Eternal destination amen upon the teaching of that church amen and there's so much different one from the other amen till it makes some 900 different questions amen therefore being 900 some questions there's got to be one correct answer amen and I would like for us tonight being that we're trying to go to heaven amen and to meet our lord Jesus who we all love he said I would like to search in the scripture Amen to find that answer amen can I just stop and say this we're not just having meetings amen we're not just going to church we're not just building churches and amen getting together amen but we're going to heaven amen we're going in the Rapture we're going Amen to everything that God has promised us amen and I'll say this we're going to meet the Lord Jesus who we love amen but better than that he loves us amen we don't just love him amen but he loves us and I'll say this morning tribulation is not my destination amen another church age is not my destination amen another planet is not my destination amen but

with them amen because of their driving amen but this is one driver that I'm not afraid to ride with amen he knows just how to steer he knows just how it's coming out amen so we don't have one thing to fear but just be a lovely little Carefree child who is looking up to the father every minute and depending on him to lead us amen and to guide us amen and to take us into our destination amen by his grace and I say this there is a direct connection amen between your destination and the grace of God you will not get to your destination by works you you will not get to your destination by money you will not get to your destination by how much you can memorize amen but a way that you will get to your destination is by the grace of almighty god listen they can sing about Grace being amazing but I'm looking this morning at what makes the grace of God amazing amen that he can save a sinner he can deliver a drunk he can redeem a lost son he can bring us back into our rightful position if anybody got a righteous shout about the grace of God is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we're not going to get there on how we feel but we're going to get there on his grace we're not going to get there on how good we can preach or how good we can sing or how loud we can shout amen we're going to get there to our somebody shout Grace I'm not talking about works I'm talking about Grace I'm talking about the grace of God that moved a man out of his office into the street and the first person he met he said do you know Grace well I want to say this morning I know Grace and I believe I'm looking at a group of people this morning amen that knows Grace you know the power of the grace of God and you're going to your destination by Grace amen can I can I lay that in there is a fundamental point of this message amen you're going to your destination by Grace you're going to your destination by Grace listen if there's a Bible question we should have a Bible answer well I'll say this morning we don't have an answer we have the answer we don't have a answer have the answer Amen to the devil's question he Christ is risen and is paid the price and is raising up the body and the devil can't stand it there's a reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up and they're all coming into what they're doing now amen there's a reason the devil's howling the way is is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity amen through his church having the preeminence in the church oh my what amen the anointed man amen but now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom amen anointed by what amen by accepting what Eve turned down amen and Adam coming back with the anointing the word because he said my word is spirit see amen Anointed with the word oh God what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept come on John amen you're not here trying to make your own provision you're not here trying to find a provision you're not here trying to pray up a provision amen but Eve turn your provision down in the beginning but there would be a second Adam and there would be a second Eve and the same word would come across the path of this second Eve and when she seen this word it would be the headstone and she would be crying Grace Grace and listen friends amen I can't make Grace a disgrace it's the only way I'm going to get out of this evil age amen is the grace of God has come over our lives and we have accepted what Eve turned down what Eve turned down he comes right back again and we accept it somebody say we accept it we accept what God has provided in Philippians chapter 4 I love the Amplified Bible in this verse it says my God Amen will supply my God will liberally Supply I love this he will fill until full he will F unto full your every need according to his riches Amen in the glory in Christ Jesus so he's not going to fill you with enough to get by he's not going to fill you with enough just to get to the next service or to come on church amen I'll say this morning amen if we never have another church service I believe what you got in you right now amen is enough to take you in the Rapture amen if the Rapture comes in the morning I believe the word that is come back in your path amen Eve turned it down but you didn't turn it down you accepted it and when you accepted it it did more than just stimulate your flesh it did more than just move your spirit amen but it filled your soul with every promise of God listen I think it's high time to tell that devil I'm not leaving these tent meetings the way I came I might to come in here full of Pride and full of anxiety and full of nervousness and full of depression amen but there's a God in heaven who has come by my way in the power of his resurrection and he has liberated me and he has filled me with joy unspeakable he has given me peace Beyond human understanding he has given me an abundance of Revelation I'll say these meetings amen we have seen the Lord Jesus how many can testify in these meetings I have seen the Lord Jesus who raised from the dead amen come into our midst amen and Grant the desires of our hearts according to his riches amen that he died to purchase this for us amen I want to say this Christ Jesus amen is the god of our needs amen he's the god of our needs amen which means he knows what we need and he knows what we don't need he knows what we need but he also knows what we don't need and according to Matthew 5 amen God promised Amen to supp the need he said and if God has given us that blessed promise then the only thing that would keep us from being filled with everything we thirst for would be because we do not believe it amen we could just believe now that God will give us the very thing we're here for amen we'll all go home tonight happy and satisfied he said I'm so glad he supplies our every need he promised he would do that now he never promised he would Supply our wants he never promised he would would Supply our wants but it was our needs he would Supply he said I'm so glad of that because there's many times that we want things amen that's not good for us so God did not promise to supply our wants but he promised to supply our needs you say well Psalms 23:1 David said the Lord is my shepherd amen I shall not want amen well look at the Greek word and the want there is a need so David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not need but I love but he also said he said now listen amen he's not just my shepherd who has it but he's going to make sure that I do not decrease I do not diminish I do not reduce from where I should be amen he has to oh come on Amen some of y'all right now the devil saying now you had a good camp meeting and you had a good feeling and you went through the prayer line amen but you just wait till Monday morning you just wait till Tuesday morning you just wait till you get back home you know when I tell that devil I say devil you just wait till we get back home home amen because we didn't come in contact with the personality we didn't come in contact with a feeling but we have come in contact with the shepherd of all Shepherds and his name is Jesus Christ and he's the king of kings hey he owns the cattle on the Thousand Hills he put the water in the river he put the mountains in the come on and if God can do that he can take care of every one of our needs right brother tells us he was shaving one morning there with a straight razor and his little boy Joseph come back he said now brother he said he said now brother little Joseph wanted that razor he said but he was 5 years old and he cried because I wouldn't let him have the razor but you see I knew better than to do that and I say this it wasn't that Joseph didn't need the razor it just wasn't the time he had need of it come on now amen there was a time coming that he would need the razor but a 5-year-old boy would know how to handle that razor so a prophet had to wait until an appointed time when he would come to an age that he could handle a razor listen amen years ago God couldn't release the things to the church that he's releasing now amen but now there's a people on the face of the Earth who has come to maturity and they know how to handle the word they know how to handle the Revelation hey I think it's high time Amen to get out of childhood immaturity and come into the fullness of the word of God it's your season to do it he said that's the way God is sometimes we think we must have certain things and we would only hurt ourself with it so if we'll just be submissive and humble like little children before him amen God Will Supply what we have need of can I say this God has always somebody say always God has always been the God Amen to meet the need when there was a trouble God has always been there amen you know that and God promised he would Supply the need in the face of every difficult amen God Will Make A Way of Escape amen he will do it if you'll just have faith and believe him another place he said God has promised Amen to meet the need of the hour he always he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time we're living in amen listen to this word provision I love the definition of it amen it is the action amen of providing or supplying something for use so God is not giving this to us amen just to look at it amen just to talk about it but he's actually given it to us to pick it up and use it is an amount or thing supplied or provided it means to supply with food amen drink or equipment amen especially for a journey amen can I say this we are on a journey and a journey has a way and the way has a destination in Psalms 32 David said the Lord amen have chosen Zion and he said I will abundantly bless her provision I will satisfy her poor with bread I love this word provision because it means food supply the prophet of God said if we're going to have an understanding of God it must come out of God's word for the word is what God gave us to feed our hungry souls and the Holy Spirit was sent to take the word of God and to feed us by the word you see amen the holy spirit is sent from God to take the word of God and to give it to us as we have need he said now I'm so glad amen that God made a provision like that that he would feed us you know what David goes on to say he said he will satisfy amen her poor with bread that word satisfy means to be fulfilled it means to have one's F love it means to have an excess so in other words this bride is not going to be living in poverty she's not going to be living on just barely getting by amen but she's going to be living in the Overflow she's going to be living in excess she's going to be living in an abundance amen I love this here the prophet of God said I pray that you will bless today amen that you would break to us the bread of life amen now what is the bread of life he said is the revelation of Christ hey is the revelation of Christ so we are promised an abundance of Revelation in our journey to our destination we are promised in Abundance of Joy Amen in our journey to our destination we are promised an abundance of Peace Amen in our journey to our destination listen we don't have to leave these meetings amen saying oh I wish I could have got the and I wish I could have got B amen can I say this this is a tent meeting it's not feel so than so amen this is a place of reality I know we've had six services and you say brother Andrew there's just a little something I want from God Amen can I say this you don't have to leave amen with that desire but the same God that was here on Wednesday that was here last night is here this morning and he's the god of his word and he said if you will believe me I will satisfy you I will F you I will provide for you you listen we're on a journey in a way to our destination now brother B says it very beautiful he said see there was a natural Israel he said but there is a spiritual Israel he said what Israel was in the natural amen we are in the spiritual how many knows that Israel is God's time pieace what Israel is in the natural he said is what we are in the spiritual he said now God Amen is leading Israel naturally amen I I I'll stop here and preach for a long time and I can't amen God is leading Israel naturally he said but watch what he's doing for us spiritually today so when you look at Israel and you see what God is doing in the natural for Israel you can look and see what he's doing in the spiritual for you you know what he's doing for Israel right now amen she's in a war amen devils are encroaching in on her land they're trying to take over things they're trying to take what rightfully belongs to her amen I just say this somebody sent me something the other day and it said that that somebody made a statement said Israel needs to quit occupying the land and somebody wrote back and they said we don't occupy it we own it we don't occupy it we own it and you know what I say I say the devil is telling you you need to quit occupying joy and occupying the anointing and occupying these meetings listen here devil we're not occupying this meeting we all miss meeting we're not occupying the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost owns US hey we're not a bunch of trespassers we've got RS in the Holy Ghost we've got watch in the message of the AR and you're looking at one preacher that will not lay down my sword I will not lay down my weapon and let some devil come in and occupy something I own I own my joy I own my victory I own my testimony I own everything that God has done for me and Satan take your hands off of it cuz we ain't going nowhere if God is fighting for Israel in the natural he's fighting for Israel spiritual in the spiritual can I say this the battle don't belong belong to you it belongs to the Lord I don't know what battle you're going home to I don't know what situation you're going home to but hear ye the word of the Lord the battle don't belong to you it belongs to the Lord and when the devil picked a fight with his bride he picked a fight with General Jesus and he is a five-star general he will not come into a battle and leave defeated he will not walk into a meeting and leave defeated he will not walk into a camp and leave defeated but he will carry out every victory in the face of every adversary because the Lord is fighting our battles oh I thank God this morning that God has chosen us amen God has chosen us as the bride Amen to fulfill his promise through US amen therefore we are his responsibility fully can I get this in your heart amen you're God's responsibility fully brother said like this when we come and separate from the world I love this when we come out and separate from the world Amen God supplies our Good Times somebody say well if I leave the world I ain't going to be able to dance no more and if I leave the bar I ain't going to be able to drink no more and if I leave the world I ain't going to be able to smoke no more and get high amen I'm going to lose my good times oh no brother sister amen if you come out of Babylon and come into the provision of God he will supply your good times and you know what I want to say we've had here this weekend we have had a good time amen we have had a good time in the presence of God we have seen healings we have seen Miracles we have seen deliverances because God said I will liberally supply all of your needs according to my riches and Glory he supplies our bread he supplies everything that we have need of Amen I say this morning the Bride of Jesus Christ has found amen the provisions of God for this age amen by God revealing to her amen the secrets in the age can I can I pick up a little bit from last night if that's okay amen God has made a provision in every age amen for both physical and spiritual healing Do You Believe last night that we've seen manifestation after manifestation after manifestation of healing I believe we saw it I believe we seen cancers leap bodies I believe we' seen diseases Defeated come on church I believe it I believe we' seen depression fall at the feet of Jesus Christ I believe we seen chains of addiction amen drop off of the lives of God's children you know why because God said I will supply amen all your needs according to my riches and Glory said now watch if God made a provision in every age amen would it not he has amen can I can I say what a prophet of Jesus Christ he said if it's so broke up in so many different denominations and fractions amen so we're trying to do our best amen by the gospel Amen to heal that broken body that all the people might come together with one great Unity amen can I say this the days of division are over I'm going to just put on my boots and preach here for a minute the days of division are over and you know what causes division amen it's Personalities in different directions amen that are different from the message come on church because what happens is you got unity and then somebody decides no amen this seems right amen so let's follow this way and you got a whole group of people standing for what they know is right and you got a group of people following what's seems right and then somebody stands up and points to what is right and now the whole body has been divided but you know what Paul said he said we ought to Endeavor Amen to keep the unity of the spirit amen in the bond of Peace come on you say well brother Andrew amen it ought to be easy it's not going to be easy you're going to have to Endeavor well we might as well preach right here you're going to have to Endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace in other words that word endeavor means to labor I love this brother Nathan the word endeavor means to labor to keep the unity of the spirit you know what else it means it means to study to exert oneself amen so if you want to keep unity in the message amen quit studying what somebody else thinks about it and study what a prophet said and just say what he said and it'll bring a unity in there and it'll Bond it together in the Peace of Jesus Christ are y'all hearing me this morning listen sometimes we're going to have to become more than just just picnickers in church and start being some Warriors because our feelings are going to get hurt somebody's going to take our parking spot somebody's not going to shake our hand somebody's going to miss us in a part oh it's Sunday morning I shouldn't be cleaning house but here we are amen somebody's going to go out with somebody and didn't invite somebody amen the devil's always going to be working Amen to bring division into the body of Jesus this morning I say we are the Warriors of almighty God and we are sick and tired of the devil taking our Unity and taking our Brotherhood and taking our fellowship you know what I do this morning brother Malachi I declare war on every Spirit of division on every Spirit of Discord on every spirit that seems right I declare war on it and I say this morning we will not bow our knee we will not follow some way that seems right we will endeavor we will exert oursel Amen to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace you know why because Paul said there is one b body I love that there is one body and there is one spirit and you are called in one hope of your calling brother very beautiful he says and it takes conventions like this where men of different denominations amen can set together as brothers that's what does the healing to the sickest body I know of another place the body of Jesus Christ it needs a healing and it can only be healed by brotherly love that's the sickest body I know of all broke up into pieces amen you're members of that body so God heal you both physically and spiritually and make you what you should be another place you said there's only one bomb that I know that will heal and that's the word and that's the sick body we want to stand up in the strength and the vitam and power of the Gospel that's why I use so much of my time in trying to strengthen the church amen by the word so a prophet knew the only thing that would strengthen the church over the devil of division has manifested his action his word brother Mark will not reject it she will accept it and the prophet says it very plain he said God's attitude towards the people amen from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in those seven read Eden is wrapped in those seven names I love how brother B says this he said see when Abraham took Isaac on the mountain he said I know thou fearest God see brother said God wasn't looking for Abraham's son I'm going somewhere he was looking for Abraham's obedience obedience is what God wants see obedience produces more than we realize now here Abraham nowhere a ram come into existence but said see if God made a promise amen God can provide he was then can I say this is my point I want to bring out of this amen Abraham was up there on the mountain there amen was the sacrifice when Abraham men fell off the bridge he did not go over there and say now I'm not sure the pillar of fire amen come into your cabin because he did not go over there and say are you what what denomination are you at amen when the supply of what he had need of come into existence there was only one thing he could do and that was accepted there was only one thing he could do and that was believe it there was only one thing he could do and that was receive it listen friend and my God said he would Supply me a Rapture listen I don't need a new home I don't need a new truck I don't need a new car what I need is a body change hey and God has provided a word to change our bodies in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you know what I say I say get your eyes off of your troubles get your eyes off of your issues and get you are closer to your destination than you are to the situations of your life there is a provision Zion that has come up upon you brother said many have fell by the wayside and they don't know the way of God no more they've been darken and blacking their hopes has failed but may they view again Calvary where you caught the fire in your bosom and broke the way and down through the dark shadow you preaching like you are because I can see home why are you believing like you are because I see home am me can I say something we've looked at the hinder Parts long enough we've looked at the issues long enough we've looked at he said he preached he sung she went they moved they done they believe they left they came we've looked at all that long enough and you know what it's got us it's got a little narrow-minded View and we're so Nar oh I'm going to get in trouble we're so narrow-minded we can't see outside of that but you know what I say I say God give us Peter's perspective give us Peter's Outlook this morning y'all remember Peter whatever the Lord's destination was that's Peter's destination and Church of the Living God I'm sorry I know there's a tribulation coming I know there's an end time upon us but I can't keep looking at every issue and every problem I'm following the message of the hour and I refuse I refuse to stand in the presence of the provision of God and not accept it the way of God is to lead by The Cloud of fire prophetic utterance Miracle signs and god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by God selected God ordained and God equipped and God sent man where a whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move God said I am the way I am the truth I am the life and no man cometh un the father but by me look at this word way it is a traveler's way it is a journey brother Josh it is a course of conduct it is a manner of thinking of feeling and deciding can I say this morning amen Christ is the way now we have access to God Amen through the priesthood of Christ listen in other words we're not living by the Old Law no more we are living amen by The Promise of God and the prophet said if the churches would forget their Creeds and forget their dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the promise then it would come effective to them can I give you a little some can I give you some equipment Amen to take home with you we know the problem is there but plead the promise that can change the problem come on Friends the problem don't change the promise but the promise can change the problem so quit pleading what can't change nothing oh God the problem is only taking you on an roll emotional roller coaster up one day down the next in one day out the amen I say this morning it's high time church amen to quit pleading the problem and start pleading the promise and you know what the promise is I am the Lord thy God and shall supply all your needs according to my riches and Glory I am God and there is no God beside me there is no God with me I am God and I'm God Alone come on church I pray when you leave these meetings you start pleading the promise over your babies plead the promise over your church you said the church is going through a hard time amen will plead the promise amen Endeavor Amen to plead the promise over the situation what are you saying I'm saying we are not carried about by every wind we are resed on the Promises of God Amen can I can I say this amen the problem is going to be here but the promise can change it there's a promise coming down the dusty road amen there's a promise are you hearing me there's a promise and if I can get your eyes off the problem and get your eyes back on the promise it don't matter what tomorrow holds because you know who holds tomorrow if I can get your eyes on the promise it don't matter what happens to the body it don't matter what happens to the spirit listen I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to preach that devil pum out of this tent this morning we're tired of problems we're tired of talking about the problems and looking at the problems and thinking about the problems somebody this morning rise up as said Joshua generation with an Elohim Revelation and plead the promise of God over that situation and tell that devil you fought long enough you fought long enough I fought my battles I fought my battles but today the god of Israel has come into the camp I'm not figh my battles no more he's going to fight them for me he's going to save my babies he's going to save my home he's going to deliver my church he's going to restore the ministry he's going to restore the vision hey I'm talking about Z step out of the problem get in the problem seen the problem long enough it's time to plead the promise of God brother somebody shout that devil out of here I said somebody shot that devil out of here no I'm not a Pentecostal I am a holy ghost filled message of the hour following PF fire believing Son of God and I refuse I refuse I refuse to let the prop defeat me in the promise come through too many troubles cross too many mountains gone through too many deserts to lay down now and feed on the problems come on church you've fed long enough on the bread of Affliction it's time to feed on the bread of Revelation until it changes your outlook eat the bread of Affliction eat the bread of Affliction eat the problem eat the situation well why don't you eat the problem now Christ has done paid the price we heard that last night so just come to him and rest if he's Jehovah Rafa Matthew rest on it if he's the Lord that saves Us by his grace if he's the Lord that saves Us by his grace and we're going to make our destination by his and he saves Us by his and we're going to make our destination by his then just rest on it if him from heaven with 10,000 of his Saints then just rest on it if the dead in Christ shall rise first amen rest on it everything is rest can I say this everything was finished and complete and we rest our faith in the finished work can I say this to you amen what brother Wayne said last night amen don't just leave it there last night amen don't just put your faith in the finished work amen just for a prayer line put your faith in the finished work for your future come on he wasn't preaching that just for a temporary prayer line he was preaching that because there was a charge of the anointing of Jehovah Rafa upon his life to hold up the finished work of healing but Church of Living God if he can heal your body I said if he can heal your body then can he not change your body if he can heal your mind can he not change your mind any gift that says anything did from that don't you believe it it's not of God CZ there's where the price was paid there's where everything was finished can I say this to you amen the true Minister and gifts of God this week have pointed us to the finished work amen by preaching the word that was not energized by man's idea but was energized by the spirit and here's what Zechariah 4:6 says he answered and said this is the word of the Lord and his rable saying amen not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord Brother said see the disciples had it swed into them then the Spirit come to energize the word can I say this it's the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God and brother Joe that's what makes it work the water of the word energizes the word of faith and makes it work can I say this you've seen people shouting this weekend you seen people stand up and scream and holler and rejoice you know what I say that's not emotion that's not that's not a sensation come on now let me preach this morning we believe predestination don't we then we got to believe what a prophet said he said the disciples had the word already swed into them the only thing they needed was the water to energize the word that was sown into their soul listen friends amen I'm going to go ahead and say it amen we did not put the seed in you with these meetings the seed was already in you before you got here come on that's why you don't have to sit down and look at all the meetings to the ear and say which one can I go to and have a good time if they're preaching the message and you you're carrying your own Revival hey then wherever you put bride wherever you put Z amen she'll turn in the house of God you can put her in a building and she'll turn in the house of God you can put her in a barn and she'll turn into the house of God you can put her in Walmart and she'll turn it into the house of God listen we're not waiting on a Revival we're not told there is a word that has been sold in this bride listen if you can accept the water you can accept the Rapture if you can accept the water you can accept the future home if you can accept the water you can accept a body change if you can accept the water you can accept the resurrection it's God I feel like shouting right now it's already in you it has to be God energizing our heart to believe and mind to yield amen amen can I can I finish this meeting out here said as I yield mine to you for a mouthpiece I yield my my eyes to you Lord for the vision I yield my seed what are you saying I'm saying when Jesus therefore received the vinegar he said it is finished now brother Andrew the days have looking at the promise and not the promise finished no the days of you telling me it's finished just finished I'm a part of the provision of God well brother Andrew things can't change things can change orander I can't come out of this situation you're coming out of it [Applause] you're coming out of it can I say this you're not staying in it you're coming out of it listen if I was looking at the problem I'd be looking at the valley of dry bones I'd be condition but you know what the Bible says the Bible says that they actually said brother Mark there is no hope there is no hope for these bones they're beyond hope I was out at brother mat other day andin got the preaching on that word hope you know what the word hope means it means an outcome it means an expectation of good things it means the grounds of hope so when the de the devil says you're finished he better hope there's not a vision over your life when the devil says there's no way you can make a Rapture he better hope that a prophet didn't see you Amen on the marsh to Glory if he says you can't overcome he better hope that a prophet didn't see a vision over you and say you can live so close to God that the devil you know what I say I say there is hope I say there is hope I say there is hope can I say this there is an outcome I say there is an outcome I say there isn't push all you want to devil we'll push back there is an outcome you want some good oldfashioned East Tennessee Country Boy theology you want some good old some old country boy theology take the word outcome and turn it around you know what it says come out Sister Janet that's pretty good for a boy from hills Beast Tennessee a it turn the word outcome around and it says come out so in other words it says you're coming out it don't matter what condition you're in if the vision of God has been spoke over your life you're coming out of it well you know what I say I say we're coming out of way y to see we're coming out of this age we're coming out of this world listen there's a vision over our lives hey the waters are running clear the waters are running clear I said the waters are running clear you know where they're not running for the end they're not running behind us and they're not running beside us they're running before us which means we are walking in a journey to a destination and the devil cannot stop it I'm I'm I'm going to tie this together and I'm going to go to the house amen God requires you to come his provided way remember said see there's a law of acceptance if there was artisian well over there that was giv water I love him there was an artisian well over there giving water and I was over here and the crop was burning up and I just walk over there and say now Great Well Spring your water over to me and water my crop so I can have food you could holler until you couldn't holler no more it wouldn't act but if you'll work if you'll Endeavor if you labor come on Church according to the laws of gravitation you can bring that water right around to your crop if you walked into a room and there was no electricity and you said oh light up the room amen I'm conscious you're here light up the room you've got to work according to the laws of electricity and then it'll light up the room listen and as your faith accepts the finished work all things are possible to them that believe as you accept the finished work come on some of y'all last night accepted it for your body you accepted it for your healing can I say this I'm here this morning to tell you this if you accepted it for the natural change then accept it for the Rapture you know what I stand here today and say I say every devil of fear is defeated of missing this Rapture I say it's time to quit living in fear of missing the Rapture it's time to quit going to meetings and leaving meetings and another meetings and trying to get a little hope you're going to make the Rapture if you will accept what Eve turned down it will release to you amen of confidence that on your bad days you can say I'm a child of God and on your good days I can say I'm a child of God and when I'm on the mountain I'm a child of God and when I'm in the Valley I'm a Child of God when the bank account is full I'm a child of God and when the bank account is empty I'm a Child of God my conditions does not change who I am I am Zion and my father is my provider and he said I'll never leave thee I'll never forsake thee you know what else he said he said I'll never see my seed forsaken or begging for bread and I say this morning if you believe this message don't you ever worry about begging for a good service don't you ever worry about begging for a good sermon preachers amen there's an abundance of bread there's an abundance of Revelation if we'll just accept it can I leave you a f Zion accepting God's provision look at this word accept to receive something offered willingly to be designed to take a hold of to endure without protest to regard as proper normal or inevitable to recognize his TR to believe to make a favorable response to to receive Fai favorably can I say this you are a special designation of Christ he is the creator of the church and the Heavenly bridegroom has created his own bride see the bride then this morning is predestinated to be accepted in the Beloved oh God what is the answer to the devil's question in there there will be a time come forth that the Christ revealed word will have preeminent listen Church Paul said it you've heard it this week having predestined under adoption by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise and the glory of his grace we made us accepted in the Beloved that word accepted means to be highly favored it means to be great made graceful it means to be agreeable it means to pursue with Grace oh God it means to pursue with Grace then you're on a journey you're in the way you have a destination and the grace of God oh God the grace of God is pursuing you the grace of God is following you the grace of God Is Watching On Come On Church the grace of God is going to make sure you make it to your destination the grace of God is going to make sure you make it in the Rapture the grace of God is going to make sure your babies are there with you the grace you you see your loved ones the grace of God is going to make sure you sit by the River of Life and eat off of the tree of life and sit at the marriage supper of the Lamb the grace the grace of God is going to make sure that you step out of time into eternity come on I feel like just taking off and shouting right now the grace of God is going to make sure everything the devil tries against you it's not going to defeat you the grace of God is going to save your family the grace of God is going to save your daddy the grace of God is going to save your mama the grace of God is going to save the family I'm talking about the grace of God has pursued you it has tracked you down the grace of God has hunted you down and made you agreeable come on Church before the message of Grace come over your life you couldn't agree with these things you couldn't say Amen to what you shouted to this weekend but when the grace of God when the grace of God [Applause] when the grace of God found you pursued you come on Mary you didn't know how it was going to happen but the grace of God pursued [Applause] you brother Sean and brother said that Grace is a woo and power come on Rebecca wasn't looking for Isaac but Isaac was was looking for Rebecca through elaser Isaac was looking for Rebecca elaser to the whale oh God Amen and got Rebecca agreeable I feel like dancing got Rebecca agreeable before elaser come way he spent some time and got her agreeable that when he be to tell her about Isaac she wouldn't question she wouldn't argue he wouldn't say well I don't think I'm worthy I don't think I'm good enough amen but the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord brought Rebecca into agreement with eliezer's message that she could marry Isaac well listen amen they may make fun of us but I really don't care because I was born in sin I was shap in iniquity but God didn't give up on me God didn't give up on me there was things in my first nature that did not agree with this message there was things in your first nature that did not agree with this message but when you heard the voice of the Beloved when you heard the voice of the Beloved there was something in your heart said that's my Lord that's my lover that's my husband that was the grace of [Applause] God highly favored agreeable pursued with Grace compass with favor honor with blessings so the grace of God hovered over you and hovered over you brother Sean can I say something this morning we say I accepted the message and that's partly true but can I say this the message accepted you the message come on Church there was 900 different denominations there was 900 different answers there was 900 different questions but in the evening time according to Zechariah 14 there shall be a l and it'll be a hovering light and it'll begin to hover over you and it'll begin to weaken your flesh amen can I just say it can I just say it the message of the hour is weaken in your flesh to where there's nothing else but you can do is but agree with the message I said the message of the hour has so weakened your flesh there's nothing you can do but agree with it come on sisters amen you remember when you had the short hair and he was wearing the wake up amen the Lord's moving right here right now amen you was in all kinds of Fashions amen the preacher got up and preached against it and you said I'll never do that I'll never do that you know why because your flesh was still speaking for your soul but when the quickening power of the Holy Ghost come across that Soul the quickening power made your flesh come subject to the word and the only thing your soul could agree with was it's me it's the truth I know this crosses theology but I'm going to say it brother said then just by accepting it won't only do God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you that's the thing you can accept him but then if he accepts you stay right there until he does accept you and then when he does he seals you into his King om by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then you're secure until the day of your Redemption are y'all ready for this there's no ups and downs there's no ins and outs you really get into God if you're really in him not just impersonating something but you're really in Christ you're one alternative you're one motive you're one objective your whole heart sold out every bridge is burnt behind you and you got your affection set on things above and you run the race with patience that's set before you can I just go ahead and say it when Christ accepted you there is therefore now no condemnation see you don't accept it it accepts you can I leave you this quote this morning then how see it through the blood washing of the blood taking away separating of sin that the Holy Spirit Woos the believer through the blood cleansing of the Soul into the fellowship into this Spirit life inside with Christ shut out the world come God help me this morning and the Very nature of God is in you you're still subject to mistakes but God can't see it but God can't see it because it's covered by the blood so when God looks at you the only thing he can see is the blood when God looks at you he sees what through the blood so if God was pleased with Christ to us dead our own thoughts and ideas being born of the spirit of God walking not after theology but after the spirit inside of us then left the dead in Christ walk not after the things of the world but after the things of the spirit see you're inside of Christ walking you're inside of Christ walking can I say this and I'm done condemnation is finished guilt is finished the past is finished hallelujah it's finished this morning can I close by saying what David said David said that God would provide for Zion that God would fight her battles can I say what he said in closing he said this he said and her enemies her enemies will wear her shame are y'all hearing me you're not wearing shame this morning there has been a blood provided and the prophet of God said the blood took the sin off of you and put it back on the head of the devil can I say this morning if anybody got a right to shout if anybody got a right to dance if anybody got a right to scream if anybody got a right to run the aisles if anybody got a right to have a good time in the house of God is the dollar of Zion because her enemy is wearing her shame her enemy is wearing her shame brother Caleb you ain't wearing it the devil's wearing it and you know what I say it looks a lot better on him than it does on you it looks a lot better on him than it does on you but you know what you're wearing you're wearing the message you're wearing Freedom you're wearing Revelation you're wearing Joy you're wearing the power of God you're wearing the word of God in the age you're living somebody shout I am accepted in the Beloved I didn't accept him he accepted me and because he accepted me I have accepted him Hallelujah Rejoice shout aloud Z shout aloud the shame is on your enemy The Devil is defeated s man is paid for it's not held against you if it makes every devil of Hell mad it's not just us taking the Rapture it's the Rapture taking us it's not just us taking the Rapture it's the Rapture taking us we are a part of the provision of God let our musicians come this morning Elijah took a Rapture Enoch took a Rapture Jesus Took a rapture Rapture took Enoch Rapture took Elijah Rapture took Jesus can I say this and Rapture is going to take me Rapture is going to take you no wonder they can't understand why you don't cluck up with him because there's a power and div Vision behind it a word of God that's been revealed to get the church in order for the Rapture and the going home what Eve turned down has come back in this generation and we have accepted it and by accepting it we have moved from living in and living out in and out can I say this this Christ is sealed in us and this morning I say stay in the way of God it's the way of abundance it's the way of provision listen it's a Vindicated gospel It's The End Time Believers now I I I'll say this don't leave this message at these meetings don't fall in love with this message one one meeting out of the year but take this meeting home with you and plant it in your house and let your children eat on it yes God has provided a way of Escape can I can I say like brother Ram says it in the message when he talks about the the Infidel remember brother Ram said he went hunting that day and he said so we went down there so we got out you all know the story by heart we got out of the truck and he said you know he's an atheist don't just wait here brother brother I think it was Banks Woodsman up and started talking to him amen he said don't mean you got slow you got to carry a preacher with you and you know brother BR said I stood there for a second he said I finally got out and walked up where I could tell it was time and he said not much on you guys y'all are barking up the wrong tree you know lying dogs brother said well might say that if you want you know brother BR very nice he said now I'm not big on you preachers you said but there is one I'd like to meet Grace had pursued [Applause] him Grace had pursued him he said there's one i' like to meet oh God he said there's one I like to meet he came up here I think it was the acting Campground he said and he prayed for a woman who we were taking care of he said she was laying on a bed pan we had to change the sheets every day she was a dying woman he said but he stood on that platform Grace was pursuing he stood on that platform and he stood there and he said he told her her name he told her where she lived he told her the color of clothes and the the prayer cloth and everything he said and when she come back he said about 2:00 that night we heard some Screaming up on the mountain she'll shout aloud for joy we heard some Screaming up on the mountain he said we ran up there the next morning and she was completely well she was completely well oh God thank you Lord It's coming right here she was completely well he said now listen he said I want to know who told that man who'd never been in this part of the country what that woman's condition was Grace was pursuing I want to know what told

spring come back up and brother ra looked at him brother Ronnie and he said when you tell me the intelligence that does that I'll tell you how I knew about that woman Nathaniel Grace was pursuing that man that man had a destination that man's destination was not to live there as an Infidel it was not to live there as an atheist he had an destination and it was in heaven it was in eternity brother R

correction he has been willing to take correction when needed he's been willing to pattern his life and and to set under oak trees you have heard many uh uh several of these Elders preach to during this week and and brother Andrew has humbled himself under that Ministry Amen to to study and to to look at things and and and and so God has blessed him for that you've seen this man young man anointed preaching this message he doesn't do it for Glory in your ministry no no matter what you may not be a world evangelist like brother Andrew but God will bless you just the same way if you
