a testimony um it was in March the last of March um I went for a regular mamogram and um they called me and said that uh they needed me to come back that they needed to do another one and they would have a doctor there in uh then they would do a ultrasound that my L nose were swollen and um so in the meantime um it would be about a month later uh that I would do that but uh around that time I got really sick and couldn't go so then they put it off till uh June it was last week but in the meantime the first week uh around that time after I found out I I kind of worried about it and was real concerned and brother Sean preached one night and after he preached uh someone had come up for prayer and he was praying for him and I felt lad to go down and be prayed for and I did and after that it really didn't bother me I really rested and I felt like everything was okay so they set it up after i' had gotten sick they set it up for last week well this past Thursday well I went and they just took every picture they could take I think they was doing an album and um uh they would take two a three and they'd come back and they'd say the doctor says that we need to take uh two or three more and they'd take two or three and they'd go back and they' uh come back out and they'd say the doctor says we need to take two or three more and um then they come back out and they said the doctor feels like something's hiding they need to take two or three more and I thought there is nothing hiding and the song kept going over in my mind uh you know everything's okay you know um and so finally they came back out and you know during that time I was supposed to have that and then have a ultrasound but they came back out and said uh everything's okay you can come back uh in a year for your regular checkup so I just wanted to give praise to God God I believe you should do that and I I just wanted to do that and I thank the Lord for it I lean on you Lord I lean on you Lord for the things

we're living in and brother brah said the reason why we we sing that song is to because this is our prayer is that as they grow that the Lord would keep them from sin and that he would use them in a special way and I know that's the desire of uh the parents here and uh so this is my fourth grandchild and um brother Mark and sister Crystal's third fourth fourth amen so we all got four here so and

give them to us in the natural sense but he's promise them to us amen that we can claim every one of our children amen and this is something that we rest in uh even at a very young age when we're dedicating them to the Lord is um you know because as they grow especially in this age they're going to face many challenges and at an early age even and um Satan doing all that he can to work on them and trip them up and Scar them but oh my we have a promise don't we as parents that we can claim our children amen and I know that's the way with all of us here this morning amen as we resting upon

uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the one who wrote it Lord Jesus it is a special honor Lord to be gathered with your people and to be able to know Lord what you have done in the age that we're living in and to know that you're finishing it all up with us what you have planned what you had purposed what you have spoke about in word prophecy song poetry all of these things Lord even to men and women of the Old Testament living out their lives testifying of this age and here we are today it being fulfilled in us how thankful we are Lord and may we never lose our appreciation for these things may we always counted un sacred and honor Lord may we walk with humility father now I pray Lord that you take what simple words that we would have Lord and that you would Minister to your people father I need you this morning I pray Lord that you just help me to get myself out of the way and may the people get themselves out of the way and we just forget about everything and focus upon you just for a few moments now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and amen Daniel the 3 chapter and uh we'll start at the first verse read a few verses here Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits the breath thereof six cubits and he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of Babylon then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes of the governors the captains the judges the treasurers counselors sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded all people Nations and languages that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sack butt sultry uh duel Simer uh dheer uh and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up and whosoever who so falleth not down and worship uh shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet flute harp sack butt and Sultry and all the um kinds of M music all the people the Nations and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at that time certain childin came near and accused the Jews they spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever thou oh King has made a decree that every man shall hear that shall hear the sound of all that music shall fall down and worship the golden image very would save time there and who so falleth not down and worshipthe should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews whom thou H has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach meach and abedo these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and abedo then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and abedo that you uh do ye not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if you be ready at that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sack butt Sultry and du Simer um and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you not worship you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands what a question eh Shadrach Meshach and abedo answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou H has set up amen you can have your seats I may go ahead and continue reading finish this chapter up but it says in the 19th verse then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage was changed against Shadrach meach and abedo therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times hard more than it was um want to be heated in other words they they they they made it seven times hotter than normal and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach meach and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats and their hoses and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and abedo and these three men Shadrach mesach and abedo fell down into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was Aston and Rose up and in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true oh King he answered and said lo I see four men loosed walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of God amen I think that's very powerful and not only just powerful but fitting for our day and age that we're living in and here these men were in captivity um due to the sins of the nation and um God had allowed them to go in into captiv ity but you know um thinking of what a challenge that would have been um for them I mean here's it's not just a little uh little meeting uh that uh the king had called but he had called for all nations this was like a superpower the ruler of of the world at that time and yet he uh being a wicked king um and we know that uh the brother randam teaches us that that image was Daniel actually it was he made an image unto a holy man and and he' made that image like an unto Daniel uh but uh but yet it it was a forced worship of um you know and this was the the how the Gentile dispensation I guess come in into play the Gentile kingdom was by a forc worship and so here here the pressure that these men must have felt um it it's you know I mean it says nothing about their friends standing up it says nothing about you know their families standing up says nothing I mean you know and you know uh uh and all of us you you you know good and well they had to have had some friends they had to have some type of family uh I know they they worked in the palace but uh you know and things like that but we all get around somehow you know and we we have friends we have uh Communications you know uh with people but uh and yet uh so here's all these people bowing down every one of them bowing down and the pressure of that that uh must have been pretty great to make them think what in the world am I doing am I stupid you know is this is this you know is this something that you know am I being a little too hard am I being a little too uh dominant here and am I being too narrow-minded you know uh all of these things uh might must have been in their minds but they kept the promise that thou shall not have no other God before me and and they kept that word in their heart and no doubt they kept meditating upon these things because they had had uh given themselves over to the Lord many years ago they had decided to serve God and you know when you make a decision to serve God you don't know what you're going to Face Tomorrow you're not going to know what you face going to face 10 years from now right when you feel the call to preach when you feel the call to to whatever or maybe even you young people when you find your the mate that you believe that God has has uh given you to marry and and you're going to start out in life and you're going to move on in in life and you know and and and you make these decisions you know of love and commitment and and all these things but you never know what's down the road you never know what challenges you're going to face and what things you're going to meet and and and that's just the way it is with all of us when we make a decision to serve God and this is why uh uh and and and the this these boys here even though they they they were Jews by nature and they were God's people by nationality if you want to say it that way uh but it was more than just well I'm a Jew so I'm just this what I'm going to do because they weren't the only Jews in that in that Kingdom uh there there was a lot of Jews a whole nation in captivity and all of them even though they were Jews they they forgot they forgot that they were you know what kind of a people they were they forgot that they had there was Commandments they forgot that they were to serve one true Living God but but these these men young men they they had purposed in their heart that you know what I I I gave my heart to the Lord I I I I know I'm just a Jew by I'm a Jew by person you know nationality and I know my history and and all these things but there was something down in them that they wanted to be more than just that they they really I believe they they wanted to serve a real living God they they wanted to to please God they they wanted to to walk with God they wanted to honor God lord and and I I think that's I think that's a real Christian it's it's more than just being raised in message and their message ranks it's more than just you know well my parents were message and I've always been message and I've you know I've raised in a Christian home it it's more than that there's got to come a time where you know uh we purpose in our heart I'm glad for what Mom and Dad was but I had to make a purpose I had to make a decision to serve God and when I made that decision I didn't understand the trials that I'd be facing I I had no idea you know the things that I would go through uh but I purposed in my heart not because I was forced to do it Nebuchadnezzar was forcing people to do it to to worship this image but uh but neb or these these boys they they they weren't serving God by force they they weren't serving God by tradition this was something that was just in their heart to do they love the Lord and always kept God be before their face they always kept God in their heart I thinking of the time of even Daniel you know when when you know the Daniel and the three Hebrew you know we call them well Shadrach mesak mot these boys they they all were uh required to eat the king's meat and they were required what it was against their Jewish Traditions or religion they weren't to eat all of that stuff and and so the King was trying to get them to do it there again the pressure because there was other men that were doing it and and the King was offering them the best the best that he had to give and and and these things but they they they purposed in their heart I'm a Christian that's right I'm not just Jew by Nature I I purpos to serve the Lord I purpos to honor him I've I made a decision to give him everything that I have you know it's in them times that your decisions are really going to count it's in these times that your faith is really going to be challenged as to really why you're serving the lord you know uh you say well I've never been out in the world well why have you been out in the world is it because you were just taught not to do them things or is it because you purposed in your heart I'm not going out there because there's always going to be chances there's going to be the pressures and and as time goes on the pressures are going to mount the the the the the the the the weight of being a Christian is really going you're going to feel it because the world is Shifting so much away from the the standards of this Bible it's it's actually shifting so far from the standards that a prophet taught us that if you really ain't purposed in your heart to serve God and you're serving God because mama said it and daddy said it and you believe in a prophet because the the mom and dad and the preacher and well I'm just I'm a message kid I was raised in a message bench you on a message bench you understand what I'm saying well then the pressure is going to come the questions are going to start com in your way the the adversity is going to is going to come and you will not be able to stand against it if there ain't something in your own heart that you purpose to serve god with everything it has to be your choice it has to be something you purpose within you when you're when you're on that internet and and them pornography and them pictures of them dirty women and and your flesh wants to look at them things you got a purpose in your heart when when you're alone away from Mom and Dad and some of you have grown up your your young men your young women and and Mom and Dad have no doubt they could give you advice but they can't tell you what to do and the places to go and the time to return home and and what to look at what to listen to and the friends to hang around and all that you you're grown up and I I pray that you purposed in your heart to serve God and to know God as a personal savior someone that is not just a god of my mom and dad not a just a god of a prophet not just a god of the pastor not just a god of the Elders of the church but I want him to be my God can you say amen and this is where they were this wasn't Pastor you know standing up there with them and saying uh uh these are my these are my favorite boys now and they've been loyal church members they PID their tithes and and their offerings and they they help me out in the church you leave them alone no that the pastor wasn't there to help them mom and Dad wasn't there to help them amen not nothing was there to stand they had to stand on their own and all the millions out there amen could have understood exactly why if they would have recanted and said okay okay I I understand and then they all would have said see oh yeah see yeah yeah I knew you'd come to your senses I knew that see that's way all of us were we you know of course we'll serve God later on but right now let let's just give the king let's just satisfy is a little fancy you understand what I'm saying but no no they they understood they weren't trying to stand down they didn't want to try to be different they weren't trying to be some holier than thou but they had convictions they they had purposed in their heart they had purposed in their life their life had purpose and it wasn't to give into a king it it wasn't to bow down to some Idol it was to serve the Living God amen yes sir we're living in a time uh where the pressures are mounting like never before right and I'll tell you young people it's not just it's not just you it's it's parents it's it's ministers it's it's in every facet every age just about of living where the the the pressure is mounting to bow down to bow down right you understand what I'm saying and and and and he's trying to take the the the the magnitude of this message out of our hearts he's trying to to take the the the the importance and how sacred uh uh uh this message is to us you see this message is a guideline to every aspect of Our Lives it isn't just to tell us about church order it sets our homes in order it it sets our lives in order it sets our our conduct in order it sets our belief system in order it it gives us a balance to everything and and it's something that we live by when we say we're message people it's something that we live by this messages are absolute I'm not here to argue the message I'm not here to dissect and pick and choose what I I want and and then you know uh uh uh leave the rest of it to whoever else wants the left the remaining part amen that comes back to well you know what's right for me is good for me and what's right for you is good for you and what's wrong with me or for me may be right for you so you know well that that ain't the case with here amen it's the message or not yes can you say Amen well then when we come here and I I want you you young people to understand that don't just serve God by by well I was raised in a message church so that's all I know about God well if that's all you know you'll never get the benefit of God and you'll always be Wayward you'll never understand the emphasis of this thing amen this message is power this message is reality this message will show you Christ a living Christ but you got a purpose in your life to serve it you see if if he would have never served him what what if the Hebrew boys what if the Hebrew boys would have bowed down to that image what if they would have given into the pressure the threats the adversity now and church I I have to tell you they were only a a a type of us in this day true that was a natural thing we're facing a whole far bit greater enemy than than that and I have to tell you young people parents preachers we all are facing it we may not be standing before a literal Idol that we may we we may be Satan wanting to put in a television before us yes wantan to bring in filthy women before us wanting to bring in in in in all kinds of of uh doctrines and Creeds and things that are totally wrong right before us can you say amen I I understand everybody's making this well brother brandom brother brandham being the holy man and and we're making him an image I I I think people are totally missing that that point yeah there are people that are worshiping him and deifying him and they're just as far and cuckoo as as the day is long you understand what I'm saying but but more than that what what are we worshiping that's right what are we bringing in what what I mean even the the the Bible David says I have set no evil thing before mine eyes can you say say Amen what about brother Bram talking about women being the the object of worship in these days guys on can you say amen I mean there there's all kinds of images there's all kinds of worship brother BR said you can worship your car you can worship your family you can worship your children you you can worship your job you can worship your money you can worship you you can worship anything amen can you say amen and and and we know that men are becoming lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they're becoming self- lovers of self so they can even worship themselves the pet the pet feelings and pet ideas and and all of this thing it becomes a worship can you say amen amen and and and we as they we have to purpose in our heart but what if they did not purpose well they would have never seen the revealing of the son of man they would have never seen the son of man come can you say Amen the others didn't see it amen them were sitting there giv in and and and and worshiping the image they would they didn't see nothing but it was because they purposed in their heart to stand there can you say Amen they purposed in their heart to to serve God no matter what it takes true they even said if it be so King if you're able to carry out the threat that that you claim to to carry it out remember seven times harder and you're living in an age that is seven times worse than any other age you're dealing with demons far greater hello it's far worse than any fire true if God never did did deliver them how long would have taken them to die instantly from just from the heat because did not the Bible just did we not just read that the guys that threw him in there they perished they they didn't even go into the Flames it was so hot ain't that right so it would have been an instant death but we're not just instantly dying I mean we're facing things day after day day after day day after day day after day trial after trial trial after trial Tri it'd be far easier just to give up and go on can you say Amen it'd be just so much easier have you ever just tried to swim upstream have you ever tried to float Upstream so much easier just to set the paddles down and quit The Strokes and just lie back and and let the let the stream take you so much easier to go that way but if they wouldn't have stood they would have never saw God In His glory but because they stood there was a one in the a son of man amen that stood there with them in the fire and I say to you the son of man has come in the greatest evil age to stand with you he's standing with you protecting you keeping you from discouragement keeping you from quitting keeping you from destrction keeping you we ought to just raise our hands unto the Lord and thank him for keeping us in this hour Hal Hallelujah isn't it wonderful keeping us keeping our marriages intact can you say Amen keeping our families keeping our minds intact keep keeping us same many people are leaving losing their convictions I I was thinking of the Methodist and how they were you know they they had they had they had sanctification packed down man uh uh you know and and you hear Brother Bram talking about even no rings and and uh uh no jewelry whatsoever and all that and I sh the boys downstairs you know uh they had the oldtime fashioned tent meeting uh that going on Methodist Church you know and and so showing them what their Revival is a man in shorts you know and and uh is a mess you know and and all that and that's their Revival of today amen people that used to they're the one that brought in sanctification Wesley did a ain't that right he's the one that brought in sanctification and now look where how far they've drifted amen and if we're not careful we'll be people that'll drift too but God will never let his elect drift because there's somebody that's going to say I'm going to stand I'm going to stand I'm going to declare the word of the Lord I'm going to believe this message I don't care what pressure it comes my way I don't care what it takes I'm going to stand to believe God's word that's where we're at today we're going to stand to believe God's word and if you don't stand God will be dead to you but if you will stand there will be a living Christ a living reality walk with you Hallelujah sir y the test are there come on now the trials are there amen the heat is on can you say amen amen but they had such a display of Faith such a confidence amen that we're going to serve God lord and here it was even if you are able to do it even if you are able to carry out your threat oh King let it be known we're not going to Bow but they said he will Deliver Us am he will deliver us can you say that he will deliver me he will deliver me amen you might be feeling the pressure to just to just to bow down to the pure pressure of the world young people but stand there with all confidence he will deliver me he will deliver me they didn't have the answers they did not know that that Fourth Man was going to come in that fire they had no idea but they were so confident in their God that he would show up in time and he did show up in time Hallelujah and he will deliver you he will deliver you you don't have to be scared you don't have to be afraid he will deliver you yes sir believe it I just believe it he will deliver he will we stand here today knowing that he will deliver he shall because he promised it am they'd been resting upon the word of God they had been feeding on the word of God no doubt living in that in that Palace Church it wasn't easy for them to do that they were living in a palace that was a wicked Palace it wasn't the Palace of King David it was a palace of a heathen Heathen Gods Heathen atmosphere Heathen ways yes amen Heathen worship amen everything Heathen everything went against what they believed but they live there I guarantee you they were feeding off that word they were listening to that Prophet Daniel No Doubt Daniel would share things that would come to him amen from God and they would listen to it and their hearts would yearn for it can you say amen amen I think how gracious God was to send them a pro give him a prophet in that age in that time of living in Babylon God would give him a prophet amen Daniel Daniel had to face his problems too but he stood but God would show up and close the miles of the lion for him amen and yet all of them were our types every type of the Bible amen more all of them of Daniel and and and well Esther I believe and Ruth well all of them amen Ruth and Boaz and they they all fit our type and if you wonder if God will ever show up on the scene for you go back and read the Bible if you ever wonder if God will ever fail or be faithful to you go back I can read this Bible God is faithful if he done it for natural people what will he do to his own elect that stand for him that's true that'll serve him with all that's within him have you purposed in your heart I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to serve the Lord ain't giving in to the pressures of life this world's got totally different standards they've got totally different IDE they got totally different ways just like Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians and everyone else they had their own standards and there was the Hebrew boys with their standards well where did them boys get their standards by a prophet's message that's exactly right they follow the prophet Moses they follow the prophets of the Old Testament amen and they they St I I guarantee you their mama read them I I hope she did anyways but but somehow they knew God in in some way that that in a greater way than the rest of the people knew God Amen but they're they they knowing god kept them with standards kept them with a purpose amen and when the world Amen wanted them to Bow under that pressure they stood ain't going to Bow I may not understand everything but I ain't bowing I I I may not have all the question or answers to all the questions that are floating but I ain't bowing I I may not understand everything and and and yes the Bible says that the children of the world are wiser and smarter than the children of of of the righteous the children of the light so they could take this Bible and a lot of them can twist this Bible in such a way that leaves us Amen to where we just Spellbound amen but it doesn't matter I'm standing on a Vindicated prophet of God a Vindicated message it I ain't bowing I'm G to stand true to the word of the Lord can you say amen that's right you love the Lord
