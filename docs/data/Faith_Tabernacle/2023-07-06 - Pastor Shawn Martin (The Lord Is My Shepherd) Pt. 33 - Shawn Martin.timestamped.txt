[39:45] yea though I walk through the valley of
[39:47] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[39:50] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[39:54] staff they comfort me
[39:55] thou prepare us the table
[39:58] before me in the presence of mine
[40:02] enemies amen you can have your seat
[40:09] and um
[40:11] we have
[40:12] um
[40:14] been on this chapter for a while
[40:17] and um
[40:19] but I uh tonight I I wanted to look at
[40:24] that maybe that fifth verse
[40:26] he prepares a table
[40:28] before me in the presence of mine the
[40:31] enemies and of course it doesn't take
[40:34] much to
[40:36] um
[40:37] to know who the real enemy is
[40:40] and that's the devil and he's the
[40:43] greatest enemy and if I could say it
[40:45] this way he's the only enemy that that
[40:48] we have
[40:49] and if there is ever a people
[40:53] that Satan hates
[40:55] it's the children of the most time gone
[40:59] he is an oppressor
[41:02] and his presence is an evil presence his
[41:07] work is an evil work
[41:09] everything about him is evil he is the
[41:12] one who instills fear in people he is
[41:16] the one who calls his people to to go
[41:20] into depression
[41:22] he is the one who puts sickness upon us
[41:27] he is the one who gets us the feeling as
[41:30] though we are unfit for heaven
[41:34] is the one that gets us to thinking that
[41:38] God doesn't love us and that we've
[41:41] crossed the line of mercy and he's one
[41:44] that gets us to thinking all kinds of
[41:46] things he is he he's one that tries to
[41:50] get us distracted from the promises of
[41:52] God and every negative thought comes
[41:56] from the devil there's no negativity in
[42:00] Christianity that's what the prophet
[42:02] told us and so everything about God is
[42:06] is uh uh positive so so anything that is
[42:10] negative comes from the devil and he's
[42:12] not just a thought
[42:14] he's a real being he is is is uh demons
[42:20] his angels are real angels and so uh
[42:27] um his presence is real and he is our
[42:30] enemy so he's a real enemy that we're
[42:34] we're up against
[42:36] today there is so much ungodliness in
[42:39] the world we're living in an age to
[42:41] where there is no respect for the word
[42:43] of God or for the people of God
[42:46] they make fun of God they make fun of
[42:48] his elect and we're finding that laws
[42:52] are being passed today uh
[42:55] um uh rapidly and that is trying to
[42:59] restrict the the religious freedom of of
[43:03] sons of God and and it's a Godless age
[43:08] uh everything and and and sad to say but
[43:11] churches are even becoming Godless and
[43:14] and so uh we're seeing all of this
[43:18] around us and and uh and and but it's
[43:22] not all dark
[43:24] it's not all dark because David said I I
[43:28] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[43:31] of of death and
[43:34] um so then we're walking in the shadow
[43:38] of the valley of death and and as we
[43:41] we've talked that that uh if there's a
[43:44] shadow then it's not all dark because it
[43:47] takes it takes light and it takes
[43:48] Darkness to make a Shadow ain't that
[43:51] rhyme and so Satan's presence Satan is
[43:55] the power of Darkness he's the ruler of
[43:58] darkness and all of these things but
[44:01] David would tell us yea though I walk
[44:03] through the valley of the shadow of
[44:05] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[44:09] with me ain't that right amen so then
[44:13] we're uh uh the one that is with us our
[44:17] shepherd He is the light for the Bible
[44:20] says God is light and in him there is no
[44:23] Darkness this ain't that rain and so
[44:26] because he is with us then it cannot be
[44:29] all dark now now it it doesn't it
[44:33] doesn't say that doesn't go to save that
[44:35] uh uh there's a lot of Darkness because
[44:38] we're seeing Darkness on every hand
[44:41] we're seeing the the dark uh uh the dark
[44:44] works of the enemy we're seeing the dark
[44:46] presence of the enemy we're we're seeing
[44:50] it all it's it's all around us but we do
[44:52] not fear about that because we realize
[44:55] that he Our Shepherd is with us and he
[45:00] is light so we're not just in the
[45:02] presence of our enemy but we are also in
[45:06] the presence of Our Shepherd ain't that
[45:08] rhyme a man and in his hand a man uh is
[45:13] his rod and staff by which we are
[45:17] comforted and we talked about this the
[45:20] the the the past few uh times we've
[45:23] dealt with this chapter but for David
[45:26] says thy rod and thy staff they comfort
[45:28] me and we know it's a rod of Deliverance
[45:31] it's a rod of protection it it has power
[45:35] over the enemy and and it keeps him at
[45:38] Bay ain't that rhyme amen and I'm so
[45:41] glad for that but it's also a rod of
[45:44] Correction a man uh uh he corrects us
[45:48] when we stray we are his sheep ain't
[45:51] that right and he deals with us uh
[45:54] differently than he would anyone else
[45:56] there's there's the Bible talks about
[45:59] that uh uh he he has turned men over uh
[46:03] to a reprobate mind to do at what they
[46:07] will and we're seeing that uh all over
[46:09] but but when it comes to his sheep he's
[46:12] got a rot and and that Rod is a rod of
[46:15] correction that keeps us and and uh in
[46:18] the past ain't that right and and so the
[46:21] the Bible says here in Hebrews 12 and 6
[46:25] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[46:28] Scourge us every son whom he receiveth
[46:31] and if you endure chastening then God
[46:36] deal is with you as with sons saying
[46:39] that right and so we as his sons are
[46:43] comforted by his correction amen and and
[46:47] the prophet says that his correction
[46:49] lets us know that he's with us a man to
[46:54] think of it that we we want his
[46:56] correction because if we don't have his
[46:59] correction then we don't know that his
[47:01] presence is with us amen there are
[47:05] sometimes that way people are led by
[47:07] Sensations they're led to well I feel to
[47:10] do this and I feel led to do this and
[47:12] they'll go by a dream or they'll go by a
[47:14] vision or they'll go buy a prophecy or
[47:16] they'll go by and they'll put their
[47:18] whole life based upon that they'll
[47:20] they'll they'll act upon all of that
[47:23] based upon a dream dream or or whatever
[47:25] and it could be totally contradictory to
[47:27] the word of God and they'll call that
[47:30] God Amen but but we find out that we
[47:33] know him by his presence with us by his
[47:37] correction that he doesn't allow us to
[47:39] do what we want to do all the time can
[47:42] you say man he keeps us in his word and
[47:46] and and corrects us and so that's his
[47:49] love to us as the shepherd uh over his
[47:53] sheep ain't that right and you know what
[47:55] brother Brown said the rod is the heart
[47:57] preaching gospel but it's a comfort to
[48:01] let me know that God is speaking to me
[48:04] when that type of gospels being preached
[48:08] to correct me it shows he loves me ain't
[48:11] that right he wants me to come and walk
[48:14] with him now amen he will walk with me
[48:17] in that hour I walk with him he walks
[48:21] with me ain't that right amen but see we
[48:23] meet his correction because we don't
[48:26] know the way we don't know exactly we're
[48:29] just learning our enemy you understand
[48:31] that church he is so deceptive and and
[48:35] and and and even in religious form a man
[48:39] that if we don't have God's correction
[48:42] Upon Our Lives a man we would be devired
[48:45] by the enemy amen that's right a man
[48:49] Hebrews 12 8 says if you be without
[48:52] chastisement then where of all are
[48:55] partakers in other words if you refuse
[48:58] to be corrected by the Shepherd in and
[49:01] and and reject his his correction his
[49:05] chastisement then your bastards and not
[49:08] Sons ain't that right a man so the proof
[49:12] of a son is one that can take the
[49:15] correction of the word of God Amen but
[49:18] then we find a man here in our scripture
[49:21] reading a man that he Paris a table
[49:25] before me in the presence of my enemies
[49:29] now one might think that is strange that
[49:33] David would put this in there he's
[49:35] talking about being the the Lord being
[49:37] Our Shepherd and we being his sheep and
[49:40] and and and the Lord Our Shepherd
[49:42] guiding us he's leading us and we went
[49:45] through all of these things but now
[49:47] David is saying that now he prepares a
[49:49] table before me in the presence of our
[49:53] enemy and and we find that it's not
[49:56] strange when we consider the context of
[50:00] the whole chapter the chapter is
[50:02] speaking of redemption restoration it's
[50:06] speaking of protection of Deliverance it
[50:09] tells uh uh constantly uh tells us of
[50:12] the shepherd's constant care for his
[50:15] sheep he leads them to a place of life
[50:18] he leads them to where they're at rest
[50:21] ain't that right they have peace for he
[50:24] leads them beside the Still Waters it's
[50:26] it's not a a Troublesome water uh a
[50:31] swift water uh uh a real strong current
[50:34] that's going to take everything out but
[50:37] it's a a steel water amen it's it's a
[50:41] place of rest it's a place of Peace it's
[50:44] a place of Life can you say man amen
[50:48] that's right see and then David would
[50:50] say he restoreth my soul so it's it's
[50:53] talking of redemption of restoration and
[50:56] and then you've got the shepherd with
[50:58] his staff where he ain't going to let
[51:00] the enemy just come in and do what he
[51:02] wants to with this sin and and the
[51:04] enemies at intent is to destroy us and
[51:07] and and and to totally devour us but the
[51:11] shepherd stands there with that Rod a
[51:14] power amen and won't let him do it ain't
[51:16] that right but now there's a table now
[51:19] David isn't speaking of the Millennium a
[51:22] man uh uh we're saying is bound and
[51:25] we're walking on the ashes of the wicked
[51:27] amen for that's what's going to take
[51:29] place in in in the uh Millennium but he
[51:33] is speaking of now present tense when
[51:37] the enemy is right there a man for he
[51:40] says he prepares a table in the presence
[51:43] of mine enemy in the time that the enemy
[51:47] is on the Rampage and darkness is all
[51:50] around in a time where Satan is walking
[51:54] about like a roaring lion in a time
[51:57] where Satan is resisting God's sin and
[52:00] fighting us on every hand and yet it's
[52:03] in that time that God prepares a table a
[52:07] man before us in the presence of our
[52:10] enemy now we know that there is going to
[52:13] be a table at the Millennium it's it's
[52:15] going to be a thousands of thousands of
[52:18] miles long and I I can't even imagine
[52:21] what that table is going to be and and
[52:23] but yet everyone that sits at that table
[52:26] is going to be those that have overcome
[52:29] the world and the things of the world
[52:32] and they're going to sit at that table
[52:34] for the wedding supper the Bible talks
[52:37] about it that that it'll be at the
[52:39] wedding supper and this that the prophet
[52:41] of God says that this this great table
[52:44] is going to be stretched across the
[52:46] canopies from eternity to Eternity and
[52:49] the redeemed of all ages a man will be
[52:53] sitting at that table amen and and who's
[52:57] them that's going to be sitting there
[52:59] but men and women and children that are
[53:02] battle scarred and they're they're going
[53:04] to be veterans amen and and you young
[53:07] people you're going to be in that number
[53:09] as well amen because see I've got my own
[53:13] eye problems and and challenges and and
[53:16] and all of this of all ages have got our
[53:19] own challenges that you're you're
[53:21] meeting the devil every day you'll meet
[53:23] them at school you'll meet them on the
[53:25] job you'll meet them at the store you'll
[53:27] meet them you'll meet him everywhere
[53:29] that rap amen and
[53:32] say that he even even children of 8 and
[53:35] 10 years old are are fighting their
[53:37] battle Satan is no respecter of persons
[53:40] amen but there is going to be a people
[53:42] of all ages that will be at that table
[53:45] that will have overcome that that enemy
[53:49] ain't that right and I'm so glad for
[53:51] that a man say and and and and we're
[53:54] going to look across the table at one
[53:57] another amen and and and there's going
[54:01] to be something that's going to be in
[54:02] common because a man they will be just
[54:06] like us that have overcome amen the
[54:09] world we'll see Paul there but he
[54:11] overcome the world and we'll see the the
[54:13] Saints of old they had overcome the
[54:16] world then and there ain't going to be
[54:17] no skeptic there there ain't going to be
[54:19] no deadhead there there ain't going to
[54:21] be no make-believer there there ain't
[54:23] going to be those that have just played
[54:25] around with Christianity that there's
[54:27] going to be real true soldiers amen
[54:30] that'll stand there that are overcome
[54:32] they had to stand alone they had to
[54:34] stand in faith they had to deny it all
[54:36] amen they had to leave their friends
[54:38] they had to forsake their family they
[54:40] had to forsaken all but they'll be there
[54:43] on that day at that table
[54:45] amen that's right and everyone that is
[54:49] going to be there is going to have
[54:50] everything in common amen there'll be no
[54:52] imminental City to deal with there will
[54:55] be no jealousy no envy and no
[54:57] make-believers it'll be nothing but true
[54:59] genuine believers who took God at his
[55:03] word over everything else
[55:05] ain't that rhyme a man and brother
[55:08] Branham uh uh he said this he says no
[55:10] doubt a man at this table Amen in the
[55:14] Millennium amen uh no doubt there will
[55:17] be a little tear trickle down our cheeks
[55:20] remembering the meanings and the times
[55:22] we'll remember the all that the battles
[55:25] will remember the Gatherings will
[55:27] remember the hardships will remember the
[55:29] things that we had to overcome and there
[55:32] we're going to shake one another's hands
[55:33] and grip it with brotherly and sisterly
[55:36] love and then that great king will come
[55:38] out and whip wipe all the tears from our
[55:41] eyes and say don't cry children it's all
[55:44] over enter into the joys of the Lord
[55:46] that's been prepared for you since the
[55:48] foundation of the world aren't you
[55:51] aren't you looking for that time amen
[55:53] there at that table amen and and while
[55:56] he is drying our tears amen the Great
[55:59] Tribulation is taking place amen and and
[56:03] those that have let were left behind and
[56:05] didn't make it in that Rapture a man
[56:07] that had just played church and just
[56:09] played around and refused to move on
[56:12] into the things of God Amen they're the
[56:15] one that's going to be left here and the
[56:16] Bible says there will be weeping wailing
[56:19] and gnashing of teeth ain't that right
[56:22] and and to think of that there will be
[56:24] nobody to comfort their tears wipe their
[56:26] tears there'll be nothing there to
[56:28] comfort them there'll be nothing there
[56:30] to a man to encourage them you know to
[56:32] keep moving on or whatever but it's on
[56:35] that end or at that table amen where he
[56:38] will wipe away our tears ain't that
[56:41] right and at that place there will be no
[56:43] enemy there Amen to bother us we'll be
[56:47] alone in the presence of our King who is
[56:50] now our Shepherd ain't that rhyme amen
[56:53] and those that will be left behind will
[56:55] be in the presence of Satan amen alone
[56:58] amen and he will have his way with him
[57:01] in whatever way imaginable ain't that
[57:05] rhyme a man but see we're talking about
[57:08] a table that God prepares in the
[57:11] presence of our enemy now there's
[57:14] several things that that this implies
[57:16] that maybe I'd like to just talk about
[57:19] for a few moments amen first of all a
[57:23] table being prepared a man is a sign of
[57:27] Welcome Amen brother Branham called it a
[57:31] the welcome table and and to welcome is
[57:35] to greet Hospitality uh hospitably
[57:37] whatever with courtesy to accept with
[57:42] pleasure
[57:43] to receive gladly into one's presence or
[57:46] companionship
[57:48] received with gladness or Delight amen
[57:52] so this is the type of table that the
[57:55] Lord Our Shepherd prepares before us in
[57:58] the presence of our enemy amen it's a
[58:01] welcoming table a man and and how uh uh
[58:05] it's a stark contrast a man in in the
[58:09] way that our enemy uh is toward us and
[58:13] and acts toward us and thinks about us
[58:16] and all of these things but also uh this
[58:19] this prepared table is the sign of peace
[58:22] a man it's a sign of peace and and in
[58:26] other words we're no longer an enemy to
[58:28] God a man and he's prepared a table to
[58:32] welcome us and it's a sign of peace I I
[58:35] looked at at second Samuel nine and one
[58:37] and I'm just going to uh uh read a few
[58:41] verses here but it says and David said
[58:43] is there any yet any that is left of the
[58:47] House of Saul that I may show him
[58:49] kindness for Jonathan's sake and there
[58:52] was of the House of Saul a servant whose
[58:55] name was ziba and and when they had
[58:58] called him unto David the king and said
[59:00] unto him our thoughts and he said thy
[59:04] servant is he and the King said is there
[59:07] not yet any of the House of Saul that I
[59:10] may show the kindness of God unto him
[59:12] and ziba said unto the king Jonathan
[59:16] hath yet a son which is lame on his feet
[59:19] and the King said unto him where is he
[59:22] and zebra said unto the king behold he
[59:26] is in the house of of so and so there
[59:30] makira uh the son of amio in lodibar
[59:34] whatever I don't know if I'm correcting
[59:37] or sound uh pronouncing that correct but
[59:39] then King David sent and fetched him out
[59:42] of the house of Mercure the son of amuel
[59:45] from lodibar and now when uh meth uh
[59:50] meth this uh when the son of Jonathan
[59:54] the son of Saul was coming to David he
[59:58] fell on his face and did reverence and
[1:00:00] David said unto him uh uh uh called him
[1:00:04] by name and he answered Behold thy
[1:00:06] servant and David said unto him fear not
[1:00:09] now think of that here was Dave here was
[1:00:12] this this man uh with a long name and uh
[1:00:16] uh he he comes from David the house of
[1:00:20] David's enemy and now he's afraid David
[1:00:24] is a king and by All rights he he could
[1:00:28] have slayed this man he could have uh
[1:00:30] done whatever but David now looking at
[1:00:33] him and saying fear not everybody say
[1:00:34] fear not
[1:00:35] for I will surely show thee kindness for
[1:00:39] Jonathan thy father's sake and notice I
[1:00:44] will restore thee all the land of Saul
[1:00:47] thy father and thou shalt eat bread at
[1:00:51] my table continually
[1:00:54] now David was doing everything that he
[1:00:57] knew to do to show unto this man that
[1:01:00] I'm not your enemy I'm your friend and
[1:01:04] you say man and to prove that you're my
[1:01:06] friend or that I'm your friend and not
[1:01:08] your enemy you're welcome to come and
[1:01:10] eat at my table you're going to eat at
[1:01:13] my table I'm going to make a place for
[1:01:15] you at my table and you'll eat there
[1:01:17] continually and I'm going to restore
[1:01:20] ain't that right well is that not what
[1:01:21] Our Shepherd has done for David's
[1:01:24] already said he restoreth my soul amen
[1:01:27] and now he prepares the table and the
[1:01:30] Lord is showing that you're not my enemy
[1:01:33] I am not your enemy amen I understand
[1:01:37] that the presence of the enemy is all
[1:01:39] around but my presence is that you're
[1:01:42] feeling is not the presence of an enemy
[1:01:45] that I am your Shepherd can you say amen
[1:01:48] and to show this see amen so therefore
[1:01:51] David is letting this man know that he
[1:01:54] has nothing to fear and I'm here to tell
[1:01:57] you that the Lord has spread the table
[1:01:59] Amen to let us know that we have nothing
[1:02:02] to fear it's your enemy that is telling
[1:02:05] you you're unloved it's your enemy that
[1:02:08] is telling you you ain't going to make
[1:02:10] it it's your enemy but the Lord has
[1:02:13] prepared a table before us to show us
[1:02:16] it's not him putting him thoughts in
[1:02:18] your mind it's not him saying that
[1:02:20] you're not loved it's not him saying
[1:02:23] that heaven is not for you it's not him
[1:02:26] telling you that the promises are not
[1:02:28] for you that's the enemy
[1:02:32] for he hath prepared
[1:02:34] a table
[1:02:38] David's not out to destroy him
[1:02:42] and you say Amen
[1:02:44] this man may have had a lot of enemies
[1:02:48] being kin to Saul
[1:02:51] but David was not one of them
[1:02:55] ain't that right
[1:02:57] so the Lord showing he's not our enemy
[1:03:01] by preparing the table
[1:03:03] Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he hath
[1:03:06] chosen Us in him
[1:03:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:03:14] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:03:17] before him in love
[1:03:19] church when did he do it when you got
[1:03:21] saved at an altar
[1:03:23] when did he choose you
[1:03:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:03:30] how do we know that he's prepared a
[1:03:32] table
[1:03:37] having predestinated us
[1:03:41] right
[1:03:42] well for one he says uh uh chosen Us in
[1:03:46] him before the foundation of the world
[1:03:47] that we should be holy
[1:03:49] everybody say I should be holy
[1:03:52] Without Blame
[1:03:54] before him in love
[1:03:56] having predestinated us
[1:03:59] me you and do the adoption of children
[1:04:02] by Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] can you say Amen how did was he forced
[1:04:07] to do it that's not what Paul says
[1:04:09] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:04:12] will
[1:04:14] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:04:17] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:04:21] Beloved church is not your enemy
[1:04:24] can you say Amen he's actually gone and
[1:04:27] taken steps to make you accept it in his
[1:04:30] sight
[1:04:33] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:04:36] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:04:39] to the riches of his grace
[1:04:43] no demands
[1:04:45] not nothing to demand that he did it
[1:04:47] it's according to the riches of his
[1:04:51] grace
[1:04:53] man
[1:04:54] now
[1:04:55] My Real Enemy your real enemy is Satan
[1:05:00] and he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:05:03] right so could you imagine what this
[1:05:06] scripture really means
[1:05:09] the he the Lord prepareth the table
[1:05:12] before me in the presence of my enemy
[1:05:17] the enemy's our accuser
[1:05:20] the the accusers there telling the Lord
[1:05:23] everything about us
[1:05:26] and by legal standpoint he's right
[1:05:29] by moral standpoint he's right
[1:05:32] we are no good
[1:05:34] we are worthless
[1:05:37] but something causes the shepherd not to
[1:05:40] look at that
[1:05:42] and he still prepares the table
[1:05:45] and he doesn't prepare the table in a
[1:05:47] secret place
[1:05:49] he prepares the table right in the
[1:05:51] presence of our enemy
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:58] so he prepareth a welcome table
[1:06:01] in the presence of our accuser
[1:06:05] so again that feeling of rejection isn't
[1:06:08] coming from God is coming from your
[1:06:09] enemy you realize your enemy despises
[1:06:12] you
[1:06:13] he hates the righteous things you stand
[1:06:16] for he is out to destroy you
[1:06:19] he does not want you to exist now now
[1:06:22] Satan as we can see Satan can barely
[1:06:25] tolerate the fact that we're living and
[1:06:27] breathing in this physical body
[1:06:29] and he's destroying he's calling people
[1:06:31] to commit suicide he's he's people are
[1:06:34] getting more weaker dying more faster
[1:06:36] it's it's it's it's incredible but but
[1:06:39] Satan hates life period
[1:06:42] but the fact that there is a eternal
[1:06:45] life within you he hates that he
[1:06:48] despises it more than your natural life
[1:06:51] ain't that right so he's out to destroy
[1:06:54] you out to to to to to to make you
[1:06:57] lifeless and and these things and and
[1:06:59] he's the one that is constantly again
[1:07:01] telling us that that we we're without
[1:07:04] Mercy we've crossed the line and in the
[1:07:06] middle of all of this accusation in the
[1:07:09] middle of all this negativity
[1:07:11] God prepares the table
[1:07:16] a welcome table
[1:07:19] so it's him telling you
[1:07:22] that everything that the devil has told
[1:07:24] you is a flat lie
[1:07:27] every negative thought that the devil
[1:07:29] puts in your mind it's a flat lie
[1:07:32] for he hath prepared a table
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:40] another thing about this table is
[1:07:46] he prepares the table because he wants
[1:07:50] to Fellowship
[1:07:55] he wants to fellowship with me I
[1:08:01] so he's not just wanting to be my leader
[1:08:06] we've had presidents that I've never met
[1:08:09] never will I'm sure
[1:08:12] I'll never have an intimate
[1:08:14] Fellowship
[1:08:15] and know him as a friend
[1:08:18] and that's not because of maybe
[1:08:21] political differences
[1:08:24] it's just he probably don't even he
[1:08:25] don't know I exist unless the IRS tells
[1:08:28] him
[1:08:32] and
[1:08:35] but see there's no relationship and yet
[1:08:37] he's my president I call him my
[1:08:39] president out of respect
[1:08:43] we follow the laws of the land
[1:08:46] but but her Shepherd
[1:08:49] is not just as our president
[1:08:53] he prepares the table
[1:08:56] for me to come
[1:08:59] and he wants to know me
[1:09:01] and he wants me to know him
[1:09:05] he wants to sit down and and talk it
[1:09:07] over
[1:09:09] amen it's one thing just for me to be a
[1:09:12] Christian and and treat God as as I
[1:09:16] would a president well I respect him
[1:09:18] he's God he's all powerful all that but
[1:09:20] I don't know him and then I live life as
[1:09:23] though he don't know me
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:25] it's not the way God wants it
[1:09:29] he takes the initiative to prepare a
[1:09:33] conference table the prophet would call
[1:09:34] it a conference table it's not just a
[1:09:37] welcoming table it's a conference table
[1:09:42] you see man was born to Fellowship
[1:09:45] and it's because God wanted Fellowship
[1:09:49] it's not because you just desired to
[1:09:51] Fellowship it's it's God the Creator he
[1:09:54] had a reason for creating you
[1:09:56] had a reason for creating mankind
[1:10:00] if he wanted just to create he created
[1:10:02] the draft he created the hippopotamus
[1:10:04] secrete
[1:10:05] he ever realized that
[1:10:08] he's made so many different species of
[1:10:11] fish
[1:10:13] and we don't even know about
[1:10:16] we're just still discovering these these
[1:10:19] creatures
[1:10:20] and that one looks alike
[1:10:23] not one's the same shape
[1:10:25] not not one and and he does it just to
[1:10:28] do it so if he made man just for
[1:10:30] creation well he could have done
[1:10:32] anything like that
[1:10:34] but he didn't just make us for just to
[1:10:36] create and say look I mean they they say
[1:10:38] there's not a thumbprint not one of us
[1:10:40] has the same thumbprint
[1:10:42] now only god with his wisdom and his
[1:10:44] imagine whatever you want to call it
[1:10:46] imagination creativity or whatever can
[1:10:48] can make billions and billions of people
[1:10:51] without a a same thumbprint
[1:10:56] I don't know how they know this but but
[1:10:58] but they say that the snowflake never is
[1:11:00] the same that's right I don't understand
[1:11:02] that I don't know who keeps up a board
[1:11:04] with that one but
[1:11:08] but let's just say it is true
[1:11:12] ever just thought of it
[1:11:14] it's all these billions of snowflakes
[1:11:18] that's only going to melt
[1:11:22] but God just does it differently
[1:11:25] proves it that he just makes things
[1:11:26] different
[1:11:29] and yet it's it's who's to notice that I
[1:11:32] don't notice them things
[1:11:33] maybe some guy just bored with a
[1:11:36] telescope or microscope I don't know
[1:11:38] that he just decides to look at these
[1:11:40] things
[1:11:42] but but but but here we are things
[1:11:44] things that go so secretly by us
[1:11:48] that it had to only come from the
[1:11:50] intelligence of God
[1:11:52] he's so mighty he's so powerful that it
[1:11:55] surpasses our little old finite peanut
[1:11:57] brain
[1:11:59] and yet yet and here we are just on a
[1:12:02] little called the sack of of the space
[1:12:06] there's other Earths there's other stars
[1:12:08] and Suns and all that that we don't even
[1:12:10] know about the sun is is huge compared
[1:12:14] to so much huge compared to the Earth
[1:12:17] they say the Earth is like a quarter
[1:12:20] to the Sun
[1:12:23] and yet God would choose to put man on
[1:12:27] the Sun or on the Earth
[1:12:29] for fellowship with him
[1:12:32] that's what blows my mind he prepared a
[1:12:36] table
[1:12:37] amen for insignificant me
[1:12:44] not only to let me know that Satan is
[1:12:46] nothing to him all of his accusations be
[1:12:49] nothing to God he still welcomes me
[1:12:52] all right
[1:12:53] but also to have fellowship with me
[1:12:56] that I may know him
[1:12:59] and he would know me
[1:13:01] can you say man
[1:13:04] he wanted to have Fellowship brother
[1:13:06] Branham said see that's the Crave that's
[1:13:08] the reason it's a Crave in your heart
[1:13:10] it's a longing for something for a
[1:13:12] contact
[1:13:13] it's not just something by your
[1:13:15] personality it's something that God made
[1:13:18] now Satan just tries he's perverted that
[1:13:21] he's perverted all of that to where we
[1:13:23] want to we we don't want God we want
[1:13:26] something else and we're longing for
[1:13:27] something that's what drives people to
[1:13:28] drink and sex and and all that and yet
[1:13:31] it's never satisfying
[1:13:33] they just miserable people are miserable
[1:13:36] it's because God made man for fellowship
[1:13:40] with him
[1:13:44] in the Garden of Eden God would come
[1:13:46] down and fellowship with this company of
[1:13:48] men and women every evening
[1:13:51] and he would Fellowship think of that in
[1:13:54] the evening time
[1:13:57] the prophet said in the call of the
[1:13:59] evening God would come down under the
[1:14:01] big palm trees perhaps his sacred light
[1:14:04] that Pillar of Fire
[1:14:06] as it was and Shining down on Adam and
[1:14:09] Eve in that great cathedral in the
[1:14:11] opening
[1:14:13] see it was just fellowship with God had
[1:14:16] nothing to worry about as long as they
[1:14:17] were fellowshipping
[1:14:19] so you see what this table means
[1:14:23] in the presence of our enemy
[1:14:28] the greatest Fellowship that man could
[1:14:30] have any man could have is with Christ
[1:14:35] and so here he is he's preparing this
[1:14:37] table
[1:14:39] table I looked it up table
[1:14:42] in one place it's on which food is
[1:14:45] placed
[1:14:46] an eating place it's a banquet a feast
[1:14:50] and
[1:14:53] the prophet would tell us eating goes
[1:14:55] with Fellowship
[1:14:57] I think that's significant
[1:14:59] eating goes with Fellowship it's not
[1:15:02] just an empty table
[1:15:04] he's not just putting a table then you
[1:15:06] come up there and then but he's now he's
[1:15:09] going to make you comfortable
[1:15:11] and he prepares the table
[1:15:13] and he puts the food he puts the the
[1:15:16] wine he won't say it that way right
[1:15:19] King always has wine
[1:15:21] and and at his table
[1:15:25] and and so we we find that that you know
[1:15:29] the Bible tells us that enclosing of
[1:15:32] Jesus's life here upon the Earth that he
[1:15:35] wanted a little time of fellowship with
[1:15:37] with his disciples
[1:15:39] so he called them apart and set a table
[1:15:42] and broke the bread and blessed it and
[1:15:45] they ate and they and they they drank
[1:15:47] the wine he blessed the wine and they
[1:15:49] drank it and it was a longing in his
[1:15:53] heart just to talk with his disciples
[1:15:58] just before you go back to God
[1:16:03] the home to to to be the high priest
[1:16:08] just one of that that that place
[1:16:10] fellowship with him
[1:16:12] so he'd prepare a table in a room
[1:16:16] the fellowship
[1:16:18] and the prophet of God says the Holy
[1:16:20] Spirit then likes to eat and fellowship
[1:16:22] with the believer you believe that
[1:16:25] he likes to Fellowship he likes to eat
[1:16:28] with you what a time we're all gathered
[1:16:32] around the great table now see where the
[1:16:35] good things of God is just piled up
[1:16:38] and I'm talking of a literal table now
[1:16:41] but but see it's it's just symbolic of
[1:16:44] something
[1:16:45] God's got in his bounties of blessings
[1:16:48] everything everybody say everything
[1:16:51] everything that you have need of
[1:16:54] everything on this table
[1:16:57] he's prepared everything you have need
[1:16:59] of brother Bill yeah the presence of
[1:17:01] your enemy
[1:17:05] think of what Satan does he wants to
[1:17:07] Devour the Bible says he seeks to kill
[1:17:09] steal and destroy
[1:17:11] divide I mean you know reading about the
[1:17:14] church ages and what the prophet says
[1:17:16] about the church ages and and these
[1:17:18] things and about Satan has come in and
[1:17:19] he stole the joy he stole the he stole
[1:17:22] the fellowship he stole the peace he's
[1:17:25] he's taken he's destroyed everything
[1:17:26] remember the prophet Joel uh talks about
[1:17:30] it you know how he would the canker worm
[1:17:32] the Palmer worm the caterpillar and and
[1:17:35] and and and we find it's it's the four
[1:17:37] stages of the same insect it's just that
[1:17:40] evil devil
[1:17:42] and he's taken life from the church he's
[1:17:45] taken the doctrine from the church he's
[1:17:47] taken everything the gifts from the
[1:17:49] church he's taken it all to where we're
[1:17:51] just an empty shell
[1:17:53] but God promised I will restore saith
[1:17:56] the Lord
[1:17:59] everything that we needed
[1:18:02] God has provided at this table
[1:18:08] everything that we have need of all the
[1:18:10] vitamins everything that we have need of
[1:18:12] to make us fully sturdy healthy
[1:18:14] Christians
[1:18:16] filled with the spirit washed in his
[1:18:18] blood and what a time that we can
[1:18:20] Fellowship
[1:18:22] you see by Nature
[1:18:26] there's there's certain type of food
[1:18:29] that calls for a certain kind of
[1:18:31] Fellowship
[1:18:32] you ever thought of that
[1:18:34] by Nature you study in nature there are
[1:18:38] certain kinds of food that calls for
[1:18:40] certain kinds of Fellowship
[1:18:44] it's just you know we heard of the old
[1:18:46] saying many times birds of a feather
[1:18:48] flock together
[1:18:51] so let's look at just the bird life
[1:18:53] you don't see the dove and the scavenger
[1:18:56] that old crow
[1:18:58] fellowshipping together
[1:19:00] why
[1:19:02] their diets are different
[1:19:05] is that right that old scavenger he'll
[1:19:08] eat off of anything
[1:19:09] he can he can hop from this and hop from
[1:19:12] that and hop from that reminds me a lot
[1:19:14] of church hoppers
[1:19:15] they just go from place to place to
[1:19:17] place and they can eat off of anything
[1:19:19] no discernment no nothing
[1:19:21] it's just whatever go floats the boat
[1:19:27] ain't that right
[1:19:30] see prophesied her old crow can sit on a
[1:19:32] dead rotten carcass and eat
[1:19:35] but if that Dove ever done that it would
[1:19:38] kill her
[1:19:40] ain't that right she just can't eat it
[1:19:43] so she has to go over to the wheat field
[1:19:45] and eat the wheat
[1:19:47] she has to eat something that won't kill
[1:19:50] her
[1:19:54] and if she's if she's got a certain diet
[1:19:56] she's got to have a certain kind of
[1:19:58] discernment
[1:19:59] to know what is good and what's not
[1:20:05] ain't that right
[1:20:06] and brother Brandon talking about that
[1:20:08] Dove she Associates with her own kind
[1:20:12] talking about Fellowship
[1:20:16] amen Abraham said you have to watch them
[1:20:18] fellas that type that can sit in a
[1:20:20] meeting and pretend enjoy the meeting
[1:20:22] and go back out and take the things of
[1:20:24] the world
[1:20:25] you have to watch them
[1:20:29] they can enjoy the meetings
[1:20:32] and they have to have meetings or they
[1:20:33] can't survive
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:36] they go from one meeting to another
[1:20:38] meeting into another meeting into
[1:20:39] another meeting meetings are good but
[1:20:42] they ain't giving you life
[1:20:44] you can't just live off meetings
[1:20:47] your personal experience with God
[1:20:52] is what makes you thrive
[1:20:55] feasting off of friends ain't gonna help
[1:20:58] you
[1:20:59] feasting off this word is what's going
[1:21:01] to help you
[1:21:02] getting into the message yourself is
[1:21:04] what's going to help you
[1:21:07] can you say Amen see and so therefore
[1:21:10] that Dove has got to have discernment
[1:21:12] now the crow don't need discernment he's
[1:21:14] just going to need anything that feels
[1:21:16] good
[1:21:17] that is good see but to see but you have
[1:21:21] to watch them fellas that can sit in a
[1:21:24] type of needing see and pretend to enjoy
[1:21:27] the meeting go back out and take the
[1:21:28] things of the world that's the way
[1:21:30] social Believers are today God didn't
[1:21:33] call you to be a social believer God
[1:21:36] didn't call you young people to be a
[1:21:38] social believer
[1:21:41] can you say amen he didn't call you to
[1:21:43] be that
[1:21:45] that's not how you're going to grow
[1:21:48] so he says see but we have to congregate
[1:21:51] ourselves together with those who have
[1:21:53] separated themselves from the things of
[1:21:56] the world called out and been made new
[1:21:58] creatures in Jesus Christ and
[1:22:00] fellowshipping around the blessing of
[1:22:03] the Holy Spirit
[1:22:05] ain't that right
[1:22:07] so then we find deep back by looking
[1:22:10] then at the scriptures and compared them
[1:22:13] to the day in which we live we see what
[1:22:17] Believers are to Fellowship around and
[1:22:20] what food they are to eat
[1:22:23] I hope it's all right
[1:22:25] but let's look let's look for just a few
[1:22:28] moments before we close
[1:22:31] but we we know that we're living in the
[1:22:33] time of Exodus
[1:22:35] the prophet preached the message the
[1:22:37] Third Exodus
[1:22:38] and he brings it down you go go listen
[1:22:41] to the token
[1:22:42] and he shows and he compares the time of
[1:22:45] the first Exodus to this Exodus and
[1:22:46] shows the comparison ain't that right
[1:22:50] and so we're living in a day just like
[1:22:52] the first Exodus so if we're living in
[1:22:55] the day like the first Exodus then we
[1:22:58] can be able to look at the scriptures in
[1:23:00] the first Exodus and and and see what we
[1:23:04] are to do in this Exodus
[1:23:07] ain't that right now we we find that
[1:23:11] that that that the death angel was going
[1:23:13] to strike in the land of Egypt in the
[1:23:16] first Exodus well look what we're doing
[1:23:18] we're experiencing today the death angel
[1:23:21] is striking in this hour today back then
[1:23:26] it was a natural death today is a
[1:23:28] spiritual death
[1:23:30] ain't that right but before the angel
[1:23:34] came God required them to do something
[1:23:38] first
[1:23:40] now this would be a symbol of Fellowship
[1:23:44] now another word for Fellowship is
[1:23:46] communion
[1:23:48] can you say it with me communion
[1:23:51] but the fellowship the communion had to
[1:23:54] be on a certain basis we're still
[1:23:56] talking about the table
[1:23:58] see being prepared God instructed them
[1:24:02] on what to eat
[1:24:05] God didn't just tell Moses now Moses the
[1:24:07] death thing is going to strike so now
[1:24:09] you just grab something to eat and put
[1:24:10] it on the table
[1:24:12] and then y'all just sat around the table
[1:24:14] and eat whatever have potluck that's
[1:24:16] okay you know
[1:24:18] that's not the way it was
[1:24:20] there was a divine order
[1:24:22] there was a Divine destruction
[1:24:24] instruction on the diet that they were
[1:24:27] to eat
[1:24:28] why it was time for Exodus it was time
[1:24:32] to leave
[1:24:34] can you say Amen see so thou they
[1:24:38] couldn't just Fellowship around anything
[1:24:42] ain't that right Psalms 104 27 these
[1:24:46] wait all upon thee that thou art Mass
[1:24:49] give them their meat in the season
[1:24:52] into season where it comes from God God
[1:24:56] orders that God prepares it
[1:25:01] and notice it the instructions came by a
[1:25:05] prophet through a prophet
[1:25:08] ain't that right Moses was the prophet
[1:25:11] of God led to lead the people out
[1:25:14] and God told Moses there in Exodus 12
[1:25:17] and 3 they shall take to them every man
[1:25:20] a lamb everybody say a lamb according to
[1:25:23] the house of their fathers a lamb for a
[1:25:26] house
[1:25:27] every house must have the lamb
[1:25:30] can you say Amen every house
[1:25:34] we've spent a lot of money on
[1:25:35] televisions people do all the time on
[1:25:38] movies and Xboxes and I don't know video
[1:25:41] game whatever they all got but the lamb
[1:25:43] God requires the lamb
[1:25:45] can you say man everybody just rejects
[1:25:47] the lamb these days but if you got to
[1:25:49] have the lamb it's time for Exodus ain't
[1:25:53] that Ryan she's and if the household be
[1:25:56] too little for the lamb let him and his
[1:25:59] neighbor next unto his house take it
[1:26:01] according to the number of the souls
[1:26:03] every man according to his eating shall
[1:26:06] make your count for the lamb
[1:26:09] notice the requirement how the food is
[1:26:12] to be your lamb shall be without blemish
[1:26:17] a male of the first year you shall take
[1:26:20] it out of the sheep uh uh out from the
[1:26:22] sheep or from the goats and you shall
[1:26:25] keep it until up until the 14th day of
[1:26:28] the same month the whole assembly or and
[1:26:32] the whole assembly of the congregation
[1:26:33] of Israel shall kill it in the evening
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:38] and they shall take of that blood of
[1:26:41] what
[1:26:42] not your neighbor
[1:26:44] the blood of the Lamb
[1:26:47] and they shall put it see up and strike
[1:26:50] it on the two side post of the door and
[1:26:54] on the upper part of the door upper door
[1:26:57] post of the house wherein wherein they
[1:27:01] shall eat it
[1:27:03] ain't that right and they shall eat the
[1:27:06] Flesh of what the cow the lamb
[1:27:11] see eat the lamb in that night the same
[1:27:15] night rose with fire fire is a symbol of
[1:27:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:20] don't you try to take this word on a
[1:27:23] formalism spirit
[1:27:26] it's got to be mixed with fire
[1:27:29] ain't that right roast with fire and
[1:27:33] unleavened bread no sin in it and with
[1:27:36] bitter herbs shall they eat it eat not
[1:27:39] of it raw nor sodden at all with water
[1:27:42] don't you water it down
[1:27:44] but roast with fire his head with his
[1:27:47] legs and with the pertiness thereof
[1:27:50] ain't that right now the prophet of God
[1:27:52] says this shows what Israel did when
[1:27:56] they had Fellowship
[1:27:58] that night of of of Exodus they the time
[1:28:03] of Exodus there was a kind of Fellowship
[1:28:06] that they had to have and that was
[1:28:08] around the lamb the blood had to be
[1:28:11] around the door they had to be under the
[1:28:13] blood with the lamb
[1:28:17] can you say Amen every family of the
[1:28:21] house was to go under the blood and eat
[1:28:24] the body of the Dead sacrifice that died
[1:28:27] in their stead aren't you glad we have a
[1:28:32] something that died in our Stead
[1:28:36] see they were to Fellowship around the
[1:28:40] roasted lamb
[1:28:43] now notice he says the death's Angel
[1:28:45] could not touch them
[1:28:47] remember he couldn't touch him
[1:28:50] why because the blood of the Lamb
[1:28:54] God told Moses when I see the blood
[1:28:57] I will pass over you
[1:28:59] ain't that right the blood of the Lamb
[1:29:02] was over the door and they were in here
[1:29:04] having communion fellowshipping around
[1:29:07] the lamb that's the only that's the only
[1:29:10] kind of Fellowship that is acceptable to
[1:29:12] God
[1:29:13] he's already prepared the table you
[1:29:15] don't have to wander around for the
[1:29:17] fellowship you don't have to go to
[1:29:19] denomination for Fellowship you don't
[1:29:21] have to go out in the world for
[1:29:22] Fellowship he's prepared the table God
[1:29:25] wants to fellowship with you
[1:29:30] and you say Amen
[1:29:32] see and notice it's not a fellowship of
[1:29:34] condemnation
[1:29:38] there's blood
[1:29:40] he's put out a welcoming table
[1:29:44] now brother Brown said that's the way it
[1:29:46] is in our heart when we applied the
[1:29:47] blood of Jesus Christ taken away all sin
[1:29:51] then we can have Fellowship eating the
[1:29:54] word of God around the table of God
[1:29:56] fellowshipping upon The Godly things how
[1:30:00] do we Fellowship he says You Preach
[1:30:02] Divine Healing and every one of them
[1:30:03] cries amen
[1:30:05] that's right preach that we should lay
[1:30:08] aside all sin malice strife and things
[1:30:10] and thou whole congregation says amen
[1:30:13] what is it we're fellowshipping around
[1:30:15] the word of God
[1:30:19] amen see he says this the True Believer
[1:30:22] fellowshipping around the word see he
[1:30:25] prepared a table in the presence of our
[1:30:29] enemy
[1:30:31] in the time where where where the lid of
[1:30:34] hell is is is lifted off and demonic
[1:30:37] power is is filtrating in the world and
[1:30:40] possessing people
[1:30:43] ain't that right in the time that it
[1:30:46] would seem to consume us
[1:30:48] in the hour of the most deceptive age
[1:30:51] where it would deceive the elect Jesus
[1:30:53] said if it were possible God prepares a
[1:30:57] table
[1:31:01] think about a statement what what what a
[1:31:04] statement
[1:31:05] David is sand see man at one time had
[1:31:08] perfect fellowship with God
[1:31:12] Adam and Eve's Soul wasn't marred
[1:31:15] Adam didn't have anything to worry about
[1:31:17] when God was Fellowship one with him
[1:31:21] see everything was running smooth it was
[1:31:23] running right and all that Robert said
[1:31:26] he didn't have to worry about his
[1:31:27] clothes he didn't have to worry about
[1:31:28] what he was going to eat he didn't have
[1:31:30] to worry about sickness didn't have to
[1:31:32] worry about the sorrow and the death he
[1:31:35] didn't have to worry about all that why
[1:31:37] he was in Failure perfect fellowship
[1:31:39] with God
[1:31:41] ain't that right amen he he had freedom
[1:31:45] like a child he he was just worry free
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:50] ain't that right
[1:31:52] see why he had a Heavenly Father
[1:31:55] that he fellowshipped with on a daily
[1:31:58] basis
[1:31:59] and the father watched over him
[1:32:03] ain't that right yes sir then what
[1:32:06] happened the enemy came along
[1:32:08] and marred the soul and caused a
[1:32:12] fellowship to be broken
[1:32:14] now man is defending for himself
[1:32:17] running from cover
[1:32:20] trying to you know running for cover
[1:32:23] trying to hide from the enemy
[1:32:25] but we're finding out you can't run out
[1:32:27] in the mountains too too deep and the
[1:32:29] enemy's still there
[1:32:33] because it's an it's a it's an unseen
[1:32:35] enemy
[1:32:37] it gets in your mind
[1:32:39] ain't that right
[1:32:41] but God still wanted Fellowship
[1:32:43] it didn't change the it didn't change
[1:32:45] his heart didn't change his desire
[1:32:48] so God had to come up with an agreement
[1:32:51] something an arrangement so that
[1:32:54] Fellowship could be restored again and
[1:32:57] the prophet said God found the plan and
[1:32:59] it was through the blood of an innocent
[1:33:01] victim
[1:33:03] through an innocent lamb ain't that
[1:33:06] right see Isaiah 1 18. we're going to
[1:33:09] try to hurry up now but Isaiah 1 18 it
[1:33:13] says come now let us reason together
[1:33:14] saith the Lord though your sins be as
[1:33:18] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:33:21] God found the remedy
[1:33:23] he found the remedy that you don't have
[1:33:25] to come and fellowship with God as a
[1:33:27] sinner as an old rotten no good filthy
[1:33:30] scumbag but now though your sins be a
[1:33:34] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:33:38] ain't that right though they be red like
[1:33:40] Crimson they shall be as wool see the
[1:33:43] prophet says when God looks through the
[1:33:45] blood of Jesus Christ amen to we who are
[1:33:48] Scarlet Red with sin and covered by the
[1:33:51] blood all he can see is us white as snow
[1:33:55] he can't see your sin he can't see how
[1:33:58] bad you are he can't see your faults
[1:34:01] against see your failure and therefore
[1:34:03] he's provided a way to make a welcome
[1:34:07] table
[1:34:09] yes he hates him yes he hates the feel
[1:34:12] for the world yes he hates what man is
[1:34:15] doing but there is an atonement for the
[1:34:18] elect that if they could get under the
[1:34:20] blood there can be a fellowship
[1:34:24] thank you
[1:34:26] you see God looking through the blood he
[1:34:29] doesn't see you as a sinner no more
[1:34:31] he sees you redeemed
[1:34:33] can you say that with me he sees me
[1:34:35] redeemed
[1:34:36] he sees me redeemed you say well I got
[1:34:39] all these faults but if you're under the
[1:34:40] blood he sees you as redeemed there is
[1:34:43] no such a thing as being saved today and
[1:34:44] lost tomorrow the Bible says that the
[1:34:47] Holy Ghost is the seal he sealed you to
[1:34:50] the day of your Redemption a seal is a
[1:34:53] finished work can you say amen amen so
[1:34:56] we're not talking about just fellowship
[1:34:57] with the God as saved today and then you
[1:35:00] know running from God as a sinner to
[1:35:02] Myra amen there's no such thing when he
[1:35:05] saved you he saved you when he called
[1:35:07] you he called you he well that's what
[1:35:10] the Bible says he Sanctified them once
[1:35:12] and for all
[1:35:16] once and for all
[1:35:21] ain't that right
[1:35:22] so now notice he said you're redeemed
[1:35:24] because he always sees you through
[1:35:25] Christ
[1:35:27] that's the reason we can be perfect not
[1:35:30] perfect in the sense of sinless we're
[1:35:32] perfect in the eyes of God when we're in
[1:35:35] Christ
[1:35:36] ain't that right so under the blood is
[1:35:39] where we have access to God
[1:35:43] ain't that right
[1:35:45] look at job
[1:35:46] under the blood fellowship with God
[1:35:51] and what did he do he had access
[1:35:53] and he interceded for his children
[1:35:57] and God answered
[1:35:59] why he had he had blood
[1:36:02] you say well but that was the blood of
[1:36:04] an animal yes it was
[1:36:07] and that blood spoke of better things
[1:36:09] ain't that right it was just a chemistry
[1:36:12] blood
[1:36:13] but that's what God required and because
[1:36:15] the Lamb of of God hadn't been slayed
[1:36:17] yet so he required the blood of an
[1:36:20] innocent lamb and when job amen killed
[1:36:23] that life it was a substitute it was
[1:36:25] showing that I should have died on this
[1:36:27] altar God but this lamb has taken my
[1:36:30] place and God accepted that and now job
[1:36:34] could have Fellowship by the dripping
[1:36:36] blood of that lamb
[1:36:42] if we could have access to God under the
[1:36:45] shed blood of an animal
[1:36:46] if job could how much more should we be
[1:36:49] able to have access to God under the
[1:36:50] blood of the Lamb of God
[1:36:54] and by the blood of the Lamb he has
[1:36:57] prepared a welcome table
[1:37:01] that we could come and have Fellowship
[1:37:05] ain't that right
[1:37:07] and notice he does it at the same time
[1:37:10] the death Angels coming
[1:37:12] ain't that right
[1:37:14] and see it's not just that God is having
[1:37:17] Fellowship
[1:37:19] not not just having fellowship with
[1:37:21] Mortal beings
[1:37:25] but God we know as the prophet taught us
[1:37:28] God dwelt Alone in the beginning before
[1:37:31] man he's eternal
[1:37:33] Gods Eternal self-existent one always
[1:37:37] been
[1:37:39] God is not a just a myth he's a person
[1:37:43] with a personality with thoughts
[1:37:46] he didn't just make this world random
[1:37:49] he didn't just create randomly he
[1:37:52] created it by thought
[1:37:54] the Bible says that he he wrote names
[1:37:57] down in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:02] they were in his thoughts
[1:38:05] in them name them names were his elect
[1:38:07] them names were his sons and daughters
[1:38:10] and he dwelt alone in the beginning with
[1:38:12] his thoughts
[1:38:14] but today he's not dwelling alone he'll
[1:38:17] never do that again
[1:38:19] ain't that right he'll never do that
[1:38:21] again because his thoughts those that
[1:38:23] was in his mind are now being made
[1:38:25] manifest in this age and God is
[1:38:29] fellowshipping with his thoughts being
[1:38:31] made manifest can you say amen and what
[1:38:34] are we eating we're eating the lamb
[1:38:37] aren't you glad for that yes sir dad and
[1:38:41] close and see Israel was under the blood
[1:38:43] of the natural lamb and they partook of
[1:38:46] a natural lamb they fell as shipped
[1:38:49] around a natural lamb they were brought
[1:38:51] out of Egypt by a little natural lamb to
[1:38:54] go to another Nation they had a prophet
[1:38:56] at that time they had the pillar fire
[1:38:58] leading them amen during that time and
[1:39:02] yet they murmured they complained they
[1:39:05] grabbed amen all of these things and the
[1:39:09] prophet said they'd done it to show that
[1:39:11] it was all under the blood of an
[1:39:13] ordinary lamb foreign
[1:39:18] God was showing the power of our
[1:39:20] bleeding but that was only a testament
[1:39:23] of what he was going to do in this age
[1:39:26] by his lamb that he would provide for
[1:39:29] you and I
[1:39:32] brother Bradham said see but today this
[1:39:34] election that is coming now see it's not
[1:39:37] it's just not going to another Nation
[1:39:39] it's going to Glory
[1:39:41] how many is going to Glory I'm going to
[1:39:43] Glory see you're going to Glory where
[1:39:46] their names are wrote on the Lamb's Book
[1:39:48] of Life not under the natural little
[1:39:51] animal lamb that brought Israel out and
[1:39:55] that yet they could backslide from there
[1:39:56] and go back but this can't everybody say
[1:40:00] this can't you cannot go back and
[1:40:04] backslide
[1:40:07] if you can't
[1:40:10] amen this is under the blood of the Lamb
[1:40:14] of God that was slain before the
[1:40:15] foundation of the world and their names
[1:40:18] were put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:40:19] before the foundation of the world and
[1:40:21] there in their elected
[1:40:25] and when that light flashes over them
[1:40:27] like that you know them denominational
[1:40:29] walls drop away from them and here they
[1:40:31] come come out from them from among them
[1:40:34] saith the spirit in these last days
[1:40:37] thoughts not their unclean things and
[1:40:39] I'll be a God to you and you'll be my
[1:40:42] sons and daughters to me
[1:40:44] ain't that right so it's not my natural
[1:40:48] lamb a man but it's by the genuine lamb
[1:40:51] under the genuine atonement under the
[1:40:54] bloody bleeding word
[1:40:57] ain't that right
[1:40:59] oh isn't he wonderful
[1:41:02] now let's look at it Revelations 5 and 9
[1:41:04] and they sung a new song
[1:41:07] saying the Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:41:10] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:41:12] thou was slain and has what
[1:41:16] redeemed us to God
[1:41:19] by thy blood out of every Kindred and
[1:41:24] tongue and people and Nation
[1:41:28] aren't you glad for that
[1:41:30] by the blood of an animal no by thy own
[1:41:33] blood
[1:41:34] by God's blood
[1:41:37] has he redeemed us
[1:41:41] I think that's wonderful
[1:41:44] and notice
[1:41:45] Moses was the anointed leader under the
[1:41:48] pillar of fire and the pillar fire only
[1:41:50] Vindicated his message with signs and
[1:41:54] wonders
[1:41:55] and that Pillar of Fire LED them to the
[1:41:58] land that God had promised them to where
[1:42:02] he himself
[1:42:03] would become flesh among them
[1:42:07] but in this age this time
[1:42:10] the pillar of fire that we see Among Us
[1:42:13] the pillar of fire is leading us to a
[1:42:16] millennium
[1:42:20] where he will return to his people in
[1:42:23] that great Millennium Reign after this
[1:42:25] Exodus and we'll live eternally with him
[1:42:29] glad for that
[1:42:31] so what a table that we have today
[1:42:35] eating off the good things of God
[1:42:38] eating the word of God
[1:42:40] that Bloody bleeding word
[1:42:43] if the musicians will come
[1:42:49] Prophet said the son of man is Christ
[1:42:51] he's the one you're feeding on
[1:42:53] you're not feeding on a man the man his
[1:42:56] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:42:57] the unfailing body word
[1:43:00] of the son of man
