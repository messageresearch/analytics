========================================

Mr Lisa Mr Faith a man and that was able to come out on a Thursday I know we changed the service on you but I know several several had to work and just wasn't able to get off but we're here and I know it's a service has probably been a little bit different but that's okay you know uh uh we don't have to have just everything just right uh uh get out of the rut sometimes and and uh the Lord will be with us amen the point is is we're here and he promised that he would meet us if we would come in his name and and I believe we've come in his name and and so uh we're we're just under expectation and um I'm gonna turn on this light here but uh the I want to if you want to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter I want to thank sister Cindy for directing and getting the food together for the funeral yesterday for after the funeral and and thank all you sisters who had cooked and served yesterday and helped and it it was a tremendous blessing and and I'd heard that some of the sisters from the surrounding churches cooked and brought food and we I think that was just really wonderful to to see everyone all the churches working together Amen in time like that and I know it meant a lot to the Week's family and good to have brother John with us on a week night and so we were just keeping him and brother Kevin and the family their mother in prayer that the Lord would just continue to um Comfort them and bless them amen and before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and just talk to our Lord father indeed you have been faithful and Lord we are so humbled that you would call us and that you would choose us to walk with you in this age and to have that intimate relationship with you Lord that's our heart's desire is to have a deeper walk with you a greater relationship and Lord as that is your desire for us too you put that desire within us and you're pulling and Lord we feel that pool and to walk in this world how blessed we are to walk through this world and to realize of who you are so many people are blinded to that fact they're relying upon other things in this world Lord that only lets them down that father you are a true source of Happiness our true source of joy you're our life Lord and we're just asking that you would just come Among Us and minister to every heart anoint Lord myself father I pray that you would help me to get myself out of the way and may the people be anointed their hearts their ears and wanted to receive we ask it Lord those that are sick father I pray that you would touch them in Jesus Christ's name we pray a man and a man we didn't take up an offering tonight but if you have an offering you're wanting to give you can just give to Bro Sam brother Josiah we only got one Deacon for Sam tonight so appreciate him being here amen and uh brother Jill saiz in Oklahoma and of course brother Chris is at where they're at so anyways but um uh we we want to look at this and it's good to have Sister Mariah here too I I guess she was here when we were gone but first time for us to be here when you're here so amen that baby's just a Dandy's growing I think brother uh uh Andrew said he's over nine pounds now why yeah he like his daddy eight nah he don't brother Hendrick don't eat much but he's growing anyways amen so all right Psalms 23 1 and 2 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures eliteth me beside The Still Waters amen you can have your seat this evening and again my title would be the Lord is my shepherd and and I I know this is a a simple thought and uh the these Brethren here the ministers could do a far better job than I could at bringing this but I I pray it'll be a help to you and uh I pray that you're enjoying the the thought on this um 23rd chapter and I've enjoyed it just studying it and it's actually kind of just um uh illuminated uh to me as well and so but I I want to deal with that second verse and that is he makes me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters and and and I I believe that this is dealing with the position of the believer of every believer this is the position and and and surely we we can see that the believer is one who believes this message that that does not add to or take away but but just just believes and David Likens the believer uh uh as being God's sheep uh for he says the Lord is my shepherd and we've talked about you know there that that David is seeing that uh uh there's a relationship you know that that exists between the shepherd and and his sheep uh uh and of course David was a shepherd and and so he understood that relationship it's it's a it's a relationship that that you you wouldn't have with any I guess other animal uh per se um and so he's saying the Lord is my shepherd and and showing that that same relationship exists in even a greater relationship exists between the Lord and his children the believer and the Lord is the great Shepherd of our soul and and we as his sheep follow and and hear his voice we follow it and Obey it uh the believer doesn't tell God what to do right because you never find the Sheep telling the shepherd what to do uh the the believer doesn't rebel against the word of God or the voice of God as as the Sheep you wouldn't find the the the the Sheep rebelling against the voice of the shepherd now he has to be corrected as we know that brother Branham taught us that even a lamb as as a baby lamb He he'll wander away and that that Shepherd has to find him and and that Shepherd will you know if if he keeps wandering off that Shepherd will break its leg you know and then it'll hold it you know and nurture it and cater it and talk to it and and all along what seems to be a tragedy is actually a lesson it goes that that a bonding is taking place that the sheep that little lamb is is learning the voice of the shepherd and uh when that leg heals that's that little lamb follows that Shepherd everywhere and you ain't gonna find that lamb going off uh somewhere else you understand and so the believer doesn't just eat anything uh because sheep doesn't just eat anything they've got to have a special diet a man a special place and so uh the Lord our great Shepherd is in control and he's the one that's leading his Believers amen the believer knows nothing outside the leadership of the Holy Ghost ain't that right and the believer knows the believer knows just as the Sheep knows whether it's the shepherd or not because it knows its voice so does the believer know whether it's it's the Lord leading or not not ain't that right I know there's a lot of confusion out here everybody's saying the Lord told me this the Lord said this the Lord said this is going to happen and it don't happen and the Lord said that and the Lord said that so many people are disappointed because they thought the Lord said something when he really didn't say anything but see the sheep have a relationship they they're they're have that bond with the voice of the shepherd uh to where they know if it's the Lord speaking they they know if it's just somebody just blowing and going or or somebody that's really got the goods and and I I think that's a deal because uh uh uh the shepherd the Lord leads uh his Sheep by his voice ain't that Brian and Jesus said my sheep hear or know my voice Amen brother Branham talking he said the natural sheep was born under the tudorship of the Shepherd he learns that voice he will never pay attention to anybody else's voice he learns that Shepherd's voice and another Shepherd might call they might do whatever they want to but there's some little something about that Shepherd that the Sheep recognizes now we're living in a day of of great deception it's the greatest deception age ever to be amen the Bible talks about false Christ rising up a man talking about false anointed ones false teachers false prophets Amen brother Branham said a false Spirit has risen up in this last day showing signs and wonders deceiving millions millions billions of people are being deceived by this false Spirit ain't that right it's a false voice false signs false wonders false everything false Christ false anointed ones but when it comes to the Lord leading his sheep every one of his sheep is going to recognize that voice ain't that right amen that's why we we're not looking for signs and wonders as the world is we're we're not we're not gullible people we may be what the world would call boring people amen they say well maybe they're just not much moving in in the church today well what it really is is you're not just seeing a lot of commotion in the church today because the message has weeded a lot of that out amen because you go in the Pentecost everybody had a tongue everybody had a dream everybody had a prophecy everybody had a word from the Lord and it was such confusion it was such a mess and and and and and people just running here from one Revival to another Revival to another Revival and and we all looked for feelings and if the if if it was something like tonight where the Lord just wasn't you know uh uh where everybody just wasn't jumping the top of the pews and we would leave home to this uh the church disappointed and well I just don't know if we're ever going to make it but see all of that was just nonsense it was a lot of commotion we believe in dream but when the Lord gives the dream we'll believe that we believe in Prophecy when the Lord gives the prophecy we we believe in thus saith the Lord when the when the Lord gives thus saith the Lord we we believe in them things we believe in the move of God when the Lord is in the move of God ain't that right and so so then when when it comes to the Lord leading a sheep can I tell you there's no competition the shepherd don't have no competition with his sheep could you imagine the shepherd trying to lead his sheep somewhere and all these other Shepherds over here and and and and drawing them sheep out and the shepherd's like no no no shut up you know I'm I'm trying to get these sheep together I'm no no no it could be a line of other Shepherds it could be a line of other voices and the shepherd and they'll have to worry one bit about it he just calls his sheep and the Sheep follow can you say amen and that's the same way there's so many voices in the land today but there is a voice that the Sheep of God recognized ain't that right for Jesus said a stranger they will not follow ain't that right now so do you realize that the tudorship of the Holy Spirit comes through the message of the hour now you think of that uh because the brother Brown said see as we had read that the natural sheep was born under the tudorship of the shepherd and he learns that voice and he'll pay attention to no other voice well then if that's the case with the with with the natural sheep and Shepherd then God has the tutor which is the Holy Ghost a man to tutor us for us to learn his voice and that tutorship comes through the message of the hour do you believe that amen when a man is truly tutored by the Holy Spirit then he learns the voice of the great Shepherd amen that's right see then that man becomes the most stable the most established the most solid individual on Earth ain't that right amen so when the winds come when prophecies come when different ideas and doctrines come and when they try to convince us that the Holy Ghost is the greatest psychologist ever amen divorce we the Sheep says I know Siri why we've been tutored by the Holy Spirit through the message of the hour amen God would never tutor us under a voice of confusion ain't that right when they tell us that God ain't working when they tell us to quit the prayer line when they tell us all of these things amen we we ain't going to pay we're established because we've been tutored by the Holy Spirit spirit in the message of the hour ain't that right amen so he's the most solid individual he's no longer a child that's tossed to and fro he's he's not stable in all of his ways like a double-minded man now he's not carried about with with every wind of Doctrine ain't that right see and and so we find Amen brother Brown talking of Jesus when he was here on the earth he says that every every all of the or the people left their affiliations left their churches left left their dogmas and the traditions and amen to follow him amen that's right they followed him even Peter Peter told Jesus he said Lo we have left all to follow thee we've we've left all you understand what I'm saying and that's the Sheep that's the believer amen following the the great Shepherd amen see and the prophet said the reason why amen that they were able to recognize him and and come out of that church affiliation is they were spiritual inside and when they seen him they recognized that he was different from them priests and teachers and so forth so they followed him wherever he went and they loved him and you say Amen we're convinced I don't know what your fight why you're following the message of the hour but I'll tell you why I'm following is because I'm convinced I see something different than the than psychology I see something different than the seminaries have produced I've seen something different than a churches have produced I've seen something different and I see God made manifest in this age ain't that right amen and so as as there's that strong bond that develops between the shepherd and the Sheep so as it is with the Lord and his Sheep amen a strong bond a strong Fellowship now there are a few things about this second verse that I want to look at amen and we've talked about it the last time I spoke on it uh here but uh uh of course the pasture is green he says he he he he uh makes me lie down in Green Pastures so it's showing that there's a freshness there a freshness it's not old and stale David's not in a place where it's old and stale and dead and dried up uh but but it's Green Pastures and and and the prophet said it's the Green Pastures where we eat so that's where your food is is in Green Pastures showing that our food has life in it it ain't that right even Jesus says that John in John 6 63 the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life ain't that right amen but another thing David also says is that he is Led he leadeth me beside the Still Waters and and this this I don't know you can take it for whatever but as I've just been studying this well water represents the prophet said the water represents life a man represents the Holy Spirit he said that one water is Christ his holy spirit so when you're looking at that verse uh you you know that the shepherd is leading his sheep the Lord leading us to where life is ain't that right life that that's where life is it's it's it's uh it's telling us that spiritual death cannot come to this place spiritual death can't touch me because I'm in a place of Life the food that I'm eating has life the water that I'm drinking is not dirty stagnated is it's life to me can you say Amen he's he's leading us now I I to me this is very special Amen to know that God is leading Us in life amen it's the place where the token is amen and that's life ain't that right amen yes sir remember the prophet said in foodless pastures are where the spiritually dead are held amen they're held in foodless pastures and that's where the spiritually dead are ain't that right but notice as I'm going to go here amen they were bitten to come but they refused to do so they were bitten to come to the feast but they were bitten to or or they refused to and Matthew 22 and 2 Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son now I want you to listen to this and send forth his servants to call them that were bitten to the wedding and they would not come ain't that right they were bitten but they weren't coming amen and and again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bitten behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways and one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and and treated him spitefully and slew them and but when the king therefore heard he was Wrath and sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City then he saith unto his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bitten were not worthy ain't that right now the prophet speaks of this a man in the uh uh uh is your life worthy of the Gospel amen but but he goes here the prophet says this he says notice they don't do it they they won't do it they in other words they won't come now think of this now what what kind of a people you you are and what kind of people have refused this amen see they have their excuse maybe their Church don't believe it in it see well but Jesus said you know what say to a man tonight he said you know speak to his heart and say I want you to go and preach the Full Gospel and he said but that man will say well my church don't stand for it Lord excuse me if you will see I've got a fine charge you know I'm a pastor one of the greatest churches in the city oh Lord we praise your name down there yes sir we sure do but I just can't do that see see it's the same excuse the same thing so they don't come to the spiritual Feast of his promise Vindicated word can you say Amen so I want you to understand that green pasture is a spiritual feast hello of his promise Vindicated word see so he says did not just say where the carcass is the Eagles will gather see Eagles not buzzards Eagles see where the slop is and they carry on then the then the buzzards gather there but where the fresh clean meat is the Eagles will gather certainly where the word Eagle food sheep Food they'll gather ain't that right so they don't come to the spiritual Feast that they're invited to amen he said now do you believe that God is give America an invitation these last 15 years to a great Revival to a spiritual Feast see well that's what was doing that's what this message was all about the prophet traveled the world uh seven times and it was an invitation come to the feast get out of your tradition get out of your your your your carnal ways get up quit following man-made ideas come to the spiritual fees and they refuse to come ain't that right now you know what here's the important thing God knows we need food ain't that right God knows we need food the prophet said every time that you eat your food you put new life into your body every time you eat you're you're putting food in you're putting life in can you say Amen you're putting life in and and and and we're realizing how important it is for life to be in our body amen not just natural we're talking spiritual now amen you see the prophet would tell us that the church is an anemia amen that's what he says anemia amen the church is anemia because they're not getting enough spiritual food ain't that right they're sick they're weakly amen they they they can't fight off them germs they they can't fight off them diseases uh spiritual diseases and all that amen they ain't got enough Faith to stand alone on God's word amen because they're not getting spiritual food can you say man now look we've had earthquakes we've had we we've had wars and rumors of wars we've had distress of Nations we've had things happen all around the world men's hearts are failing for fear amen and we've had all that because the Bible says it would happen but notice the last plague and this is the prophet saying this a man quoting the prophet the last plague that is to fall is death amen we've had all these things around in the world but the last plague is death and it's falling it's it's a spiritual death that is falling in this nation ain't that right it's spiritual death that has fallen in the nation fallen in the world uh today amen you see death was the last plague a man that fell in Egypt right at the time of Exodus ain't that right right at the time of Exodus and the prophet would tell us and notice it was amongst the sons that it fell on death came to the sons amen and he says the church has got more members than it ever had thriving better than it ever did and yet the weakest in spirit that it ever was ain't that right he said that's just like it was in Egypt amen death in the land as it was fallen on the Suns back then it's falling upon the churches in this hour today amen oh yeah more members great big empires of churches and and professional musicians professional choirs professional preachers well-trained uh audience and everything just right amen but they're the weakest ever can you say Amen they're the weakest ever amen why amen they're they're they're they're they're they're caught up in their Traditions caught up in ruts amen when when the ruts get when we get out of ruts people don't know what to do [Music] it's true you know they used to have church without music you understand what I'm saying they used to add just a good old time old-fashioned Holy Ghost just beating the tambourine all right but we get so used to things amen and and then when it doesn't go that way we all just we go freeze hello well when the spirit of God began to move in this nation the churches begin to freeze up they they weren't used to this spirit of God they they weren't used to the move of God so they called it up the devil ain't that right see but it was actually what they didn't know it was an invitation to come to the feast amen amen that's that's right see and so the prophet said the churches are spiritually dying they're drying up and they're blowing away why are they dying he would say why are they dying because they threw their own wisdom has strangled everybody say strangled they have strangled the holy spirit away from them now think of that they have strangled and I thought well why in the world you know uh they they he would use that word strangle well see they now I know they're saying they got the Holy Ghost but you and I let's just face facts they ain't got the Holy Ghost if they had the Holy Ghost it would straighten their lives up like it did on the day of Pentecost it would change their thought pattern it would change their ways it it would change the habits it it would change the desire it they would just but they would beat the door down to come to church they would beat the doors down just to get together and have Christian Fellowship amen but they'd there's more people more comfortable with the sinner than they are with the church I've always wondered about that when people claim to have the Holy Ghost and they're more at home with the sinner than they are with the saints of God they they'll point the they'll Point all the faults out in the church the preacher all the way down and they won't want to they want that yet they don't see any Fault With The Sinner that what you don't know a man is the blood is covering the people of God the blood is covering the saints of God Amen where is The Sinner they're under a wrath of God can you say amen that's right see now they're saying that they've got the Holy Ghost but they don't amen that's right Satan now notice the Bible says uh there in Revelations 3 19 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me ain't that right so this prophecy now we all know that this prophecy has been fulfilled it is not we're not waiting for it to be fulfilled it's not being fulfilled it has been fulfilled Christ has been kicked out of the church notice brother Branham uses that same word strangled again he said Jesus had been strangled from his church well I thought of that so I looked up word strangle it means to seriously or fatally obstruct the normal breathing now now that's important and now I understand why he was using that word strangled that they strangled him they got him by the throat and strangled him where he couldn't breathe anymore well you see now now remember how did Adam become a living Soul the Bible says that God breathed the breath of life into him that's exactly right Genesis 2 7 and the Lord for him Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the Breath of Life ain't that right and Man became a living Soul man's life came to him by the Breath of God Amen notice John 20 and 21 then Jesus said to them again peace be unto you as my as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them he breathed upon them now someone asked brother Branham what in the world did that mean he breathed upon them and then said receive ye the Holy Ghost the prophet said he was breathing the promise on them breathing the promise God have mercy that Breath of God is something we need today ain't that right the Breath of God Amen is the one that's giving life to the church breathing the promises of God to us ain't that right the prophet said the Church of God is born of the Breath of God he says in another place the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God he says in another place when you become a child of God Amen you are born by the Breath of God ain't that right so no wonder he would use this word strangled Jesus was strangled to where he could no longer breathe upon them he could not give them life so now they're sitting dead in their Pew they're sitting dead Amen to a religious form because they have strangled him from his church can you say Amen we don't want to strangle the Lord can you say Amen if anything we want him to breathe the breath of life upon us amen so we see why the death is the last plague of death the church has brought it upon themselves they kicked him out they didn't want him breathing the breaths of promises on them they didn't want the breath of life amen well you know the prophet said the word can only produce a tongue talk in Acts 2 38 blabbering amen uh uh man I wished I had the quote before me but they in other words he at what what the word produces the world thinks is crazy what the word produces the church don't like so God come in this age to breathe the Breath of Life amen ain't that right now notice though God made a way of Escape just before the last plague hit right what does he do he requires a token when I see the blood I'll pass over you that token had to be put on display ain't that right and he's requiring the token today brother Brown said no other time in in the church ages did god require a token amen it's been the lamb the lamb the lamb the lamb all the way through but in this age God is requiring a token ain't that right yes sir and the prophet says that life that was in the lamb see uh uh has returned back and is publicly sealed in there that everybody passing by talking to you has any Associates with you seeing that the blood has been applied and the token of the life that was in the blood is upon you you are safe from the Wrath ain't that right amen that's right see so this is why we needed the spirit of God in the church today we needed that Prophet amen God through that Prophet now this is just what I'm thinking and I believe is God through that Prophet was breathing the Breath of Life to the church putting life into the church and the life is the token do you believe that not the natural blood the natural blood the chemistry of that blood of the Lamb had to be applied upon the door amen but now we ain't got no blood of Jesus Christ that all went into the ground that even if you had the the physical literal blood of Jesus Christ it could do you no good hello it's what the prophet teaches us now it could do you no good what the token is today is the life of the blood the light see the animal life could not come back the the the the life of that natural lamb could not come back up on the believer so they had to use the the natural blood to put it up on the door and then had to be on display now the life of Jesus Christ has to be put on display in your life can you say amen and notice in the Green Pastures in where that water it's all speaking of life that's where we're at it's sustaining life to us not displaying life today and tomorrow you don't know what you're displaying and then the next day you know you play it just play a little bit of life and you know it's it's not that way at all it's everyday life everyday life you're on display life on display life on display can you say man so what a joy it is to know that we're not in a spiritually dead condition I am safe how many believes you're safe I am safe no weapon formed against me is going to prosper I look look at the wrath of God all around but he's placed Us in Green Pastures he placed Us by the rivers of water that's right now notice this Green Pastures must be in a valley because in the valley is where you find the water it is also where you find the best soil is in the valley in the valley is also where the Lily grows ain't that right so it's in the valley you find water and so David says he leadeth me beside the Still Waters now you all know this scripture but I'm going to read it Psalms 1 and 1. blessed is the man that walketh not in the council or the wisdom of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor Sith in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law or the word of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night ain't that right and he shall be like a tree planted by what rivers of water that man will be planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season notice his Leaf also shall not wither he may go through different seasons in his life but his Leaf will not wither that life will be on display all the time no matter what season he's in no matter what trial he's going through that life is in on display his Leaf shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that's the man that's planted like a tree he's planted brother Graham said he's not planted on a Dusty desert rock but he's planted in the valley beside Rivers plural rivers of water singular and he says the river speak of the nine spiritual gifts that Paul speaks of and the water speaks of one Spirit the Holy Spirit ain't that right so nine rivers of the same water ain't that right and the thing that man is planted right there all right oh Hallelujah I know people don't believe in the gifts today but if a man is planted by the rivers of water he's planted by them gifts and you know what he's doing he's drawing strength from them Waters ain't that right yes sir now in our opening scripture David said they're still waters and I'm going to get to that later on Still Waters but this man is planted by the rivers of water and the prophet said he's not there by chance I want you to think of that it's not by chance that you're there it's not by chance you come into this message it's not my chance that you something pricked your heart see God planted you there when would you planted the prophet said before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in his book he planted you then then by the rivers of water he said that thought before the that that thought of God before the foundation of the world placed him there he's not stuck out just stuck there he's planted there then you say Amen you realize that you're predestinated to be there every aspect of your life you do you realize that you're just we're just coming to what we were predestinated to be we we were never predestinated to be Sinners God allowed us to be Sinners but it wasn't his perfect will we weren't predestinated to be what we were drunks Liars thieves whatever we were the Bible never tells us that we were predestinated for that we we understand that was his permissive will amen but now we're looking at his perfect will ain't that right that we were predestinated before the foundation of the world to be conformed to the image of his son come on that's right so you're coming now to what you've been ordained to all right from your birth all the way up to the end of your life you think of what God has been doing even though you didn't even know God even though you didn't understand him and it may be nothing about church or you could have been religious whatever but God had been directing your path your path aren't you glad that God been directing your path even when he's a sinner even when you was walking in that bar God was still protecting you God was still guiding you hello now he may have not predestinated you to be in that bar but he had a predestination for you he had a destination for you he had a plan for you and he begins to direct you and he somehow you didn't just by chance begin just happened to walk by a church and hear song sung you just didn't happen to amen just to have a religious thought and say you know what I'm just tired of the way I am I just want to give my heart to God that wasn't by chance God had been directing you and leading you all the way through your life to come to that point ain't that right you gave your heart to God now that's what you were predestinated to do you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you realize he predestinated the point the time the place the very second that he would come into your heart and there was no devil that could ever stop that can you say Amen if we can only realize just how planted we really are all right not a church plant this is a Heavenly plant now if you come to the altar by predestination you realize the Millennium is there waiting on you everything is waiting the table's ready even your body is waiting on the other side your theophany it's all this ain't by chance you were planted can you say Amen and then there comes that time in our life where we go to what we were predestinated for brother Brown said he was predestined talking about that man that's planted he was predestinated to catch that word when it was sold means they'll be right there when it sticks she is there he's planted not just stuck down he's actually planted that's right a lot of difference see sticking a stick in the ground then planting something it's different the seed was planted it found its own root hole when the water begins to come in and Break Forth its life the spirit and it began you say well there are nine spiritual gifts and he says amen Let Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen why he's planted so this experience if I can if I can let you know this experience of being in the Green Pastures and by The Still Waters it's not just a passing thing it's the place where you belong can you say Amen it's the place you belong so therefore you're you're not you're not looking at the word and accepting part of the word and denying the other part amen and you're so mixed up in your mind that that ain't it you're planted in there and that's what the prophet is saying see someone says well he still heals just like he always did and that plant a tree that man will say amen amen amen we got so many people that are just stuck in the message but then there are people that are planted [Applause] well do you love him he said he's planted by the rivers rivers coming from every side rivers of water no wonder he can't weather no wonder he's planted some of them seed fell over there he can't die it's right in the Stream of life it keeps producing that's right it's drawing its life out of them Rivers can you say Amen the new the Old Testament see just being fed right on through there but notice another thing as we get ready to close but another thing that David says notice he lead he maketh me lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the Still Waters one thing that stands out to me about this verse is that it speaks of peace contentment rest hello it speaks of a state of being satisfied he may give me lie down the Sheep ain't Nancy it ain't nervous looking around it's actually been able to lay down and rest it's able it's got peace about it hello now that means a lot because it's showing us that wherever the Sheep's food is and the water supply is there's rest there's peace there's contentment the Sheep ain't nervous and antsy we got that Spirit of anxiety that's dominating the world today you know why it is because judgment's coming and that same spirit is trying to get up on this bride and is trying to dominate this bride hello you ain't gonna deal with that you ain't gonna be able to deal with that Spirit by medicine as they're trying to do with these young children it's a spirit [Music] hello but here David is telling us that that Spirit of anxiety cannot touch us I'm made to lie down in Green Pastures I ain't worried about the future I'm right where I belong I I ain't running to and fro trying to find peace I'm laying in the Green Pastures I'm beside the waters that are steel you know still waters are not ripped they're not making a lot of noise hello that's right see see the judgments of God are falling now this ought to make something to us because I believe this scripture applies for our day but that the judgments are falling but while it's falling David is made to lie down now it ain't God getting him and said lying down lie down lie down no no no this saying the Sheep is satisfied his belly is full he ain't thirsty the fruits of the water supply of the air so he's not trying to looking around and all this and the shepherd don't know what to do the shepherd has provided the place for him now the believer's not worried for he's safe also in the Green Pastures was it not the Green Pastures in the Green Pastures that the power of God was manifested when the bear came after the Sheep God manifested his power when the lion came after the Sheep the supernatural was manifested to deliver the sheep and you say Amen I I don't know but just why why was the supernatural manifested in this age to bring Deliverance to the Sheep to deliver that sheep can you say Amen as we talked about from the mouth of the Baptist from the mouth of the Pentecost from the mouth of sickness and disease the supernatural but notice where the supernatural came from it came from where the food is hello you might think me crazy but I just I I don't know I I just believe as we see the supernatural taking place and if you look that's where your Green Pastures are that's where we've been placed that's where we've been brought to spiritually speaking can you say Amen see now the prophet now notice in this Green Pastures the prophet said in his prayer said you set them talking about to the Lord you set them your sheep your children by The Still Waters and the Green Pastures and they have a wonderful time rejoicing and praising God in any time and I know this might be a paradox in it well it is it's it's definitely different when everybody is depressed everybody is so negative everybody is so unthankful everybody wanting to write everybody thinks they've been done wrong everybody been thinking they they they just uh you know underprivileged and it's going on and on and on and on yet there is a people that is just simply praising God and rejoicing because their needs have been supplied they're in a place in a condition where they shall not want so they're not in need God has already provided that they're eating of life life is being sustained in them it's being renewed in them can you say Amen they're drawing from the Waters of Life why can't you just praise the Lord why can't we just be thankful ain't that right do you realize that fits with Revelations 5 and 1 through 13. I I could read it to you but you all know it where John Salva the book that was closed sealed with Seven Seals and the The Voice began to cry who is worthy to open the seals or the book The Loose the seals thereof and John says I'll begin to weep I I cried and and then I hear this uh voice uh say you know we've knocked John behold the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's worthy to open the book thereof and to loosen them seals turned around and looked and there was a bloody bleeding lamb ain't that right and the lamb come and the Bible says he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and notice it changed the atmosphere it changed the it changed the service it changed everything it brought it from weeping to rejoicing it brought it from down-hearted to worship hey can you say amen I tried see and they sang a new song talking about the four beasts and the Four and Twenty elders and they began to praise him and glorify him and they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people in nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth ain't that right and he says the number of them was ten thousands times ten thousands and thousands of thousands of angels and beasts and elders and they were rejoicing and as saying Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power riches wisdom strings and honor glory and blessings ain't that right but then John being the type of the Bride as he's washing this watching the worship take place in the atmosphere he enters into that and says every creature which is in to heaven and on Earth on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I sing blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever can you say Amen see oh I tell you now I'm hoping we can identify with them Green Pastures are amen John saw something here and the prophet said we're in them Green Pastures by The Still Waters secondary rejoicing and praising God and and and having just a good old time and the world all around us is in depression anxiety amen they're blowing their brains out they don't know what to do they're they're facing Doom and Gloom the wrath of God is upon them and right in the middle of it all there is a church there is a people amen that the Lord is their Shepherd amen they're smack dab where God wants them to be their plan entered there the devil can't take them out they're planted there no sin is great enough to take you out your plan is there you're rejoicing having a good time can you say Amen now what kind of food are we eating there's got to be a kind of food that makes them lay down because they're satisfied right it must be the right food and I'll close great according to Revelations 10 8 9 it's the open book that's our food it's the open book not a closed book so where do we get the open book at where do we get our food at Revelations 10 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven only Christ it could be Prophet said cold with a cloud and a rainbow is upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet is pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little open book no longer closed open book and he set his right foot upon the sea in his left foot on the earth we didn't know that that book was open but he came down with the open book and he cried with the loud voice as when a lion roared and when he cried seven Thunders out of their voice you know this story this event correlates with Joseph of the Old Testament Joseph was betrayed by his Brethren sowed as a slave you know be it Joseph is called the son of prosperity because wherever he went wherever he was things prospered and he was the type of Jesus Christ and God showed Joseph God showed Joseph that there would be seven years of plenty the gifts would be there in operation it'd be an abundant dreams and visions and healings healing campaigns she's going to put it that way the word being brought years of plenty but then he showed him that it would after them seven years they would follow a famine in the land so Joseph by this time he was now living in the palace ruling over the Kingdom right and Joseph's stored up food in the years of plenty thank you stored up them years of plenty while he was preparing for famine is that right and brother brim says it was the only place in the world that had food hello and Joseph had the keys to the food he had the power to give food for there was no other that could give the food ain't that right and brother Brown said it's the perfect of the church today the only place spiritual food is given out is in the Kingdom of Jesus Christ you can go and take some old church Creed and recite a few Apostles Creeds or whatever you want to but brother the spirit lays in the born-again Church of the Living God is only where there's food can you say Amen now here is Christ coming down and what looks to be just the symbol a book is our food hello he's the son of prosperity amen the seventh verse but in the last days uh but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets notice he took the book opened the book tore up the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people to reveal it to who his people it's hidden to the rest of the world there you are notice he asked this question oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation that's what came from the open book amen an old John who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything on Earth everything in heaven uh uh everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessings honor and might and power be to him that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when themselves broke John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there's John and he was so happy I don't know what that does for you but the revelation of the open book that open book allowed John to see himself in the future beyond the curtain of time Beyond this Mortal life he saw himself in that Millennium he saw himself in the new Heaven and new earth he saw himself that death could not oh death death could take him to the grave but there was something coming up yonder he already saw himself no wonder there is peace contentment and satisfaction can you say Amen the open book that's our food if the musicians will come got a lot more but we'll we'll just close sustaining life this food is revelation are you eating it are you seeing yourself in the future and you're seeing yourself already there don't have to rub the rabbit's foot no more don't have to cross your fingers good luck anymore you're eating food that you're seeing it's it's it's allowing you to see beyond to where you see yourself in the book then you say Amen no more wondering about this no more wondering about that no more wandering as to who I am no wondering if I'm going to make it or not nope I'm at rest he maketh me to lie down in the Green Pastures oh my the people of God are at rest and you can tell it by the food they're eating now for those that are not eaten that don't listen to these messages and you're feeding off of everything else you're listening to all the gossip Christians don't listen to gossip Christians don't have ears and let their ears be garbage cans Christians feed off the word of God [Music] you can listen to all the complaints of those that have left this church and let your ears be the garbage cans you'll never get anywhere with God you can listen to the complaints of the world you can listen to complaints of everything and that's up to you that you'll never find strength that way [Music] I'm talking about Green Pastures that God has provided a sustaining strength for a Rapture at hand a food that will build rapturing Faith a food that brings about that perfect love not not human love perfect love God love it's a food that that strengthens our faith the Bible says that that Abraham got stronger in faith he considered not the body of uh the the deadness of Sarah's womb he considered not his own body being dead getting weaker and weaker and weaker more frail all the time he just kept nursing off the promise now he had only one promise to nurse from when we've got an open book to eat from and as we're eating of this open book we're getting stronger we're being able to defy the enemy that comes our way every demon of hell that we used to be scared of now we're looking at them Square in the eye and we're bringing them down by The Sith the Lord because we're nursing or we're eating out of an open book can you say Amen you love him isn't the Lord wonderful amen let's just sing this song I'm Standing on the Promises of God [Music] oh I'm still I'm standing I'm standing standing all Standing on the Promises of Christ my savior
