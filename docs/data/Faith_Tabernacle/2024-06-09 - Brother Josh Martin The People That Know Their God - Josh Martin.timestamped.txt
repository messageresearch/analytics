[36:34] the Lord amen I trust that's your desire
[36:37] amen if you have your Bibles this
[36:38] morning let's open our scriptures to
[36:41] Daniel
[36:43] 11:32 it's good to be here this morning
[36:46] count it's an honor and a a privilege to
[36:48] be ministering I pray something could be
[36:50] said to be a blessing amen uh we have
[36:53] been watching some of the services there
[36:55] in New Mexico looks like they're having
[36:56] a good meeting there at brother em
[36:58] manuels so we we thank the Lord for that
[37:01] amen amen Daniel
[37:05] 1132 the Bible would say and such as do
[37:07] wickedly against the Covenant shall he
[37:10] corrupt by flatteries but the people
[37:13] that do know their God shall be strong
[37:15] and do exploits amen can we bow our
[37:18] heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly
[37:20] Father Lord what an honor Lord it is to
[37:23] come into your house father God as we've
[37:26] sang songs of worship Lord and we've
[37:28] created an atmosphere father we ask that
[37:30] you would come and inhabit the Praises
[37:32] of your people this morning Lord as we
[37:34] come into this part of the service I ask
[37:36] that you would anoint me Father anoint
[37:38] your word Lord see this thought that
[37:40] you've placed upon my heart God I ask
[37:42] that as the word would come forth Lord
[37:44] there be Hearts to receive it father
[37:46] Lord meet the needs touch the hearts
[37:48] Lord we ask these things in your
[37:50] precious name amen you may be seated
[37:53] this
[37:54] morning if I had a subject it would be
[37:57] the people that know their God and
[37:59] brother brandham would place this
[38:01] scripture in the end time and he would
[38:03] say and all that Daniel said about the
[38:05] last days and how they that know their
[38:08] God will do exploits and just so many
[38:11] scriptures tying in this day that we're
[38:13] living in how that these evil deceiving
[38:15] times would be on the earth and and just
[38:18] exactly what we're having now fulfills
[38:21] it he says they had been given their
[38:23] chance to see him but they rejected
[38:25] their very Messiah and today it's the
[38:28] same thing the very same thing we are
[38:31] given the opportunity he would say in
[38:34] another place Daniel said in that day
[38:36] they run to and fro knowledge shall
[38:38] increase and he said they the wise shall
[38:40] know their God in that day and do great
[38:42] exploits in that day but the wicked
[38:45] would not know the god of Heaven they
[38:47] know him in a form and in a ritual so
[38:50] knowing god in a form or a ritual is not
[38:53] the realities of God but I believe it's
[38:55] got to go from just what nominal church
[38:57] members have just more than just a form
[39:00] to the realities and the Bible would
[39:02] tell us that the mystery of God should
[39:04] be finished and I believe we're living
[39:06] in a day where the understanding of who
[39:08] God is has been poured out where God is
[39:11] no longer veiled by traditions and by
[39:14] Creeds and by dogmas but the realities
[39:16] of who God is has been opened up to us
[39:19] in this generation where we can see God
[39:22] not through a Creed but see God as who
[39:25] he is God didn't want to be seen as a
[39:27] Creed or as a tradition God wanted to be
[39:29] seen as a person you can't see a person
[39:32] in a form all you see is a shadow but
[39:35] once you see it in a reality you see a
[39:38] person that this word is Jesus Christ
[39:41] and you see brother Brandon would tell
[39:42] us that God was veiled behind Badger
[39:45] skins and whenever Christ was being
[39:47] crucified upon the cross he says the
[39:49] veil was ritten from top to bottom and
[39:52] there stood The Mercy Seat for everybody
[39:54] to see but but then he would say not
[39:57] every body could see him because of
[39:59] their traditions because of their form
[40:02] and I think many times we can be in a
[40:03] message church but come the church out
[40:06] of a form instead of a reality and we
[40:09] don't know God when we come out of a
[40:11] form but I believe we can come with the
[40:13] Revelation knowing where two or three
[40:15] are gathered in my name I will be in the
[40:17] midst of the people and I believe that's
[40:19] what we're Gathering under today not a
[40:21] form but a revelation that God has
[40:24] promised to meet us in this place this
[40:26] morning and you see brother the Brandon
[40:28] might tell us that the Gentiles have
[40:30] veiled him up again not by a natural
[40:32] Veil but by a spiritual veil by Creeds
[40:35] and by Traditions again but brother
[40:37] Brandon M tell us in the first thing
[40:38] they went to Methodist Baptist
[40:41] Presbyterians Pentecostals and so forth
[40:43] It's organized tradition till a man
[40:46] don't know where he stands but glory to
[40:48] God he promised in the last days what he
[40:51] would do he would show his word in plain
[40:54] view open before us see open it up so
[40:58] just like Christ was unveiled when he
[41:00] was walking on Earth it's been promised
[41:02] in this day that he would unveil himself
[41:05] again where we could see the person
[41:07] Jesus Christ not an idea but a person
[41:10] and brother Brandon would tell us that
[41:12] the Holy Ghost has been bound by
[41:14] denominational Rivers for 2,000 years
[41:17] but is to be loosed by an evening time
[41:20] message and then he would tell us the
[41:22] Holy Spirit Christ himself back in the
[41:24] church again and I believe that's what
[41:27] we're wanting today it's Christ in me
[41:29] the hope of glory that's what I want if
[41:32] I don't have God living on the inside
[41:34] why serve him but I believe it's been
[41:36] promised there's a message that is going
[41:38] to unveil God where we don't just see
[41:41] him but we know him we don't just see
[41:44] him but we can experience the realities
[41:47] of it and brother Brandon would tell us
[41:49] we've had many fine preaching many fine
[41:51] evangelists and pastors but he says the
[41:53] main thing I'm trying to bring to you is
[41:56] the reality of the presence of Christ oh
[41:59] my not just an idea of the presence of
[42:01] Christ but he says I'm bringing the
[42:03] reality of the presence of Christ and I
[42:06] believe that's what this message has
[42:08] done in this generation it's brought the
[42:10] realities where it was once a sealed
[42:13] book of just of just potentials but no
[42:16] longer is the potentials but now it's
[42:18] realities inside of a body but you see
[42:21] if you want to see God you have to
[42:23] understand God if you want to see the
[42:25] supernatural you have to understand the
[42:28] Supernatural and the Bible would tell us
[42:30] in Psalms 119 and 27 make me to
[42:33] understand the way of thy precepts so
[42:35] shall I talk of thy wondrous works so in
[42:38] order to declare his works we first have
[42:41] to understand and brother Brandon would
[42:43] tell us that it's only a special class
[42:46] of people that is going to understand
[42:48] God he would tell us you recall that I
[42:51] mention at the beginning of this message
[42:53] that this book we are studying is the
[42:56] actual revelation of Jesus himself in
[42:59] the church and his work in the future
[43:01] ages then I mentioned that it takes the
[43:03] Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we
[43:07] fail to get it bringing these two
[43:09] thoughts together you will see it won't
[43:11] take just ordinary study and thinking to
[43:13] make this book real it is going to take
[43:16] the operation of the Holy Ghost that
[43:18] means this book can't be revealed to
[43:21] just anyone but a special class of
[43:23] people he will take one with prophetic
[43:25] Insight he will require the ability to
[43:28] hear from God it will require
[43:30] Supernatural instruction not just
[43:33] student comparing verse with verse
[43:35] though that is good but a mystery
[43:37] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[43:40] it never becomes clear so that's why
[43:42] it's only a special class of people cuz
[43:45] it takes one with a prophetic Insight a
[43:47] prophetic Insight only comes to a
[43:50] prophetic class of people and oh my that
[43:52] class has to be predestinated and I'm so
[43:55] glad God predestinated me in this hour
[43:58] not just to see a form but to see a
[44:01] reality you see the church world can
[44:03] only produce what they see they can only
[44:05] produce what they understand but this
[44:07] bride produces what he understands which
[44:10] is Jesus Christ we can't help but see
[44:12] that the word made flesh in this hour is
[44:15] no longer just Jesus but now it's inside
[44:18] of a body it's inside of me and inside
[44:20] of you and brother Brandon would tell us
[44:22] that so many people have different
[44:24] opinions of Christ and he would say as
[44:27] he travels around the world you'll be
[44:29] surprised at the opinions that people
[44:32] have he says you'll be surprised to know
[44:34] what they think he says some says he's a
[44:36] philosopher talking about Christ he says
[44:38] some says he was just a great teacher
[44:40] some say he was just a prophet some say
[44:42] he was just a great man and brother
[44:44] brandom says he was all of those things
[44:46] but he was what that was plus oh my so
[44:50] that's why it's a prophetic Insight
[44:51] because you can see the same things that
[44:54] they're looking at but you look past the
[44:56] veil you see they're looking at a veiled
[44:58] book and all they see is a philosopher
[45:00] all they see is a prophet all they see
[45:03] is a great man but a prophetic inside of
[45:05] prophetic people look past that and see
[45:08] a prophet more than a prophet but
[45:11] there's a word in this generation a
[45:13] greater than Solomon is here it's a
[45:15] prophetic word that has come to a
[45:18] prophetic people that is receiving the
[45:20] word that they can know their God oh I
[45:22] want to know my God this morning not
[45:24] just a form but a reality I want to
[45:27] experience a person when I'm going
[45:29] through trials I can feel him when I go
[45:32] through heartaches I can feel him I want
[45:34] to know my God in the power of the
[45:37] Resurrection oh Hallelujah but you see
[45:40] it's a people that is understanding and
[45:42] identifying him cuz identifying him is
[45:45] to recognize where he's at today not a
[45:48] god of yesterday but a god of today not
[45:51] just justification sanctification not
[45:54] just 1906 but today he's in the for
[45:57] of his power coming to a people so it's
[46:00] somebody that is identifying him
[46:02] recognizing him where he is at today you
[46:05] remember when Nathaniel had met Jesus it
[46:07] wasn't what Jesus was wearing that
[46:09] revealed it to Nathaniel it was what
[46:12] Jesus was producing it was when
[46:14] Nathaniel would come to Jesus and Jesus
[46:16] would would start to reveal his heart
[46:18] let him know who he was and something
[46:20] would spark on the inside of Nathaniel
[46:23] but this was the Messiah it wasn't what
[46:25] he was wearing and brother Brandon would
[46:27] tell us he didn't have any credentials
[46:29] he didn't have a certain array of dresss
[46:31] but what he would have was the works of
[46:34] God that was spoken of that was his
[46:37] credentials and so when Nathaniel he
[46:39] looked past the veil he looked past the
[46:41] dress he looked past these things and
[46:44] seen the credentials which was the word
[46:46] of God and brother Brandon would tell us
[46:49] he's bringing the reality of the
[46:51] presence of God that we can identify him
[46:54] by the scripture and so that is what's
[46:57] going to identify him today is the
[46:59] scripture made manifest in this
[47:02] generation and that's what Nathaniel
[47:04] would see is the scripture being made
[47:06] manifest and you know like I said it
[47:08] wasn't the Garment that what he was
[47:10] wearing and too many people today you
[47:12] focused on a garment they get focused on
[47:15] a man the only time they're going to see
[47:16] God is when a certain man is preaching
[47:19] that's not the case if it's the word
[47:21] coming across the pull pit then that
[47:23] mean God is coming across the pull pit
[47:25] if the message is being preached
[47:27] that means the Supernatural is coming
[47:29] inside of the midst it don't matter
[47:31] who's preaching it don't matter who's
[47:32] teaching it don't matter if it's a
[47:34] convention all I want to hear is the
[47:36] word of God and that will bring the
[47:38] results it's the word of God that is
[47:41] going to change our bodies it's the word
[47:43] of God that is going to take us in the
[47:44] Rapture and it's the word of God today
[47:47] that changes situations it changes
[47:50] circumstances it brings Miracles it
[47:52] brings healings so that's what we need
[47:54] to focus on today is the word of God God
[47:57] identifying him where he is at oh
[48:01] Hallelujah and so the mystery of God is
[48:04] going to unveil who God is but inside of
[48:07] the mystery of God is going to be who
[48:09] you are you know inside of the mystery
[48:11] of God is going to be who the devil is
[48:14] so once we understand who God is we
[48:17] understand that the devil's a whoop hup
[48:19] come on now we understand that every one
[48:21] of his tricks will not work against the
[48:23] bride of Christ we understand who we are
[48:26] I'm not serpent seed but I'm the bride
[48:29] of Christ so knowing god brings an
[48:32] understanding of the entire plan of who
[48:35] God is oh Hallelujah that's why we
[48:37] needed a message to show us who God was
[48:40] because we went through church ages of
[48:42] church members not knowing who they were
[48:45] not knowing how to overcome but God
[48:47] would bring an understanding and let you
[48:49] know that I'm the God of all
[48:52] possibilities in your flesh I'm the God
[48:55] of all possibilities in your
[48:57] circumstances I'm the God not just of
[48:59] yesterday not of tomorrow but a god of
[49:02] today in your present time circumstances
[49:06] I'm the God in it oh Hallelujah but the
[49:10] only way to be the people the no God is
[49:13] to recognize his word and brother
[49:15] Brandon would tell us the scriptures is
[49:17] what testifies of him so that's what
[49:20] identified him was the scripture he says
[49:23] you believe that that's what we have to
[49:25] identify him today
[49:27] then we will know whether we are right
[49:29] or not whether it was him he was the
[49:32] same he would do the same and I just
[49:34] love that quote brother brandom says
[49:36] once you identify him then you know if
[49:39] you are right or if you're wrong and you
[49:41] know how many's ever been in in an
[49:43] argument before and you just know that
[49:45] you're right you know that you're right
[49:47] but somebody pulls up Dr Google and
[49:50] Google has all the answers right and
[49:52] then Google tells you that you're wrong
[49:53] you lose all your confidence you start
[49:55] second gu everything because you just
[49:58] knew that you was right but if it
[50:00] identifies and proves that you are right
[50:03] then there's a confidence on the inside
[50:05] that what you were saying is right and
[50:08] that's what brother Brandon was saying
[50:09] once you identify him then you know if
[50:12] you're were right or if you're were
[50:14] wrong and then that's when the bride
[50:16] becomes Fearless oh brother brandom says
[50:18] when something gets revealed to you you
[50:21] become Fearless you don't matter what
[50:22] the Skeptics say you don't matter what
[50:24] the naysayers say you don't matter what
[50:26] the devil says if something is revealed
[50:29] to you that you all right there's nobody
[50:32] that can take it away from you oh that's
[50:34] why we need to know God in this
[50:35] generation because you become Fearless
[50:38] with the promises of God then that
[50:40] changes our expectation I'm not just
[50:42] coming to church out of a form I'm
[50:45] coming to church out of a revelation I'm
[50:48] fearless I'm bold with my expectation
[50:51] but God is going to meet my need if I
[50:52] need healing in my body God's going to
[50:55] heal my body if I got lost loved ones
[50:57] God is going to save them you see
[50:59] somebody is becoming Fearless because
[51:01] they know in whom they have beli oh but
[51:04] the Brandon would tell us that David all
[51:06] he had was a little piece of leather but
[51:09] it was revealed to him and since it was
[51:11] revealed to him he was bold and it's so
[51:14] incredible brother Brandon would he
[51:15] would start to tell us that Saul was
[51:17] Head and Shoulders above the Army
[51:19] David's Brothers was more able to do it
[51:22] but then he says it was not revealed to
[51:24] them and that really struck me that here
[51:26] they were they had more to offer than
[51:28] what David had they had more gifts they
[51:31] had more talents they was more capable
[51:33] of being an overcomer but it wasn't
[51:35] revealed to him oh so that means to me
[51:38] you don't have to have anything to offer
[51:40] as long as you know you're God oh come
[51:42] on now you might not be able to sing you
[51:44] might not be able to preach you might
[51:46] not be a deacon but if you know you're
[51:48] God that makes the difference then
[51:51] there's more of an authority that is in
[51:53] your life than the Pope that is over in
[51:56] Rome because you know you're God oh
[51:58] hallelujah it's more than somebody that
[52:01] thinks they're A Gifted Man if you know
[52:02] they're God there's more of a Authority
[52:05] in your life and brother Brandon would
[52:07] tell us that that that David's Brothers
[52:10] knew God could do it but they didn't
[52:12] think they can do it in them oh my
[52:15] that's a tactic of the devil the God can
[52:17] heal but he can't do it for you oh come
[52:20] on now that God can save but God can't
[52:22] save you that there's going to be a
[52:24] Rapture but it ain't for you you see
[52:26] what that Revelation you start to cow
[52:28] down but with Revelation it's David
[52:31] saying where's the uncircumcised
[52:33] Philistine where is he he's calling out
[52:35] the armies of the Living God where is he
[52:38] you see when somebody gets a revelation
[52:40] you're not afraid to stand against the
[52:42] challenge oh we're living in a day where
[52:45] the devil's challenging everything that
[52:47] is right challenging everything we
[52:49] believe but with a boldness we're not
[52:52] afraid to stand up against the challenge
[52:54] oh I'm preaching now we're living in a
[52:56] day of pressure where the devil wants
[52:58] you to feel like like like you're a
[53:00] nobody wants to get you to feel like
[53:02] you're the minority you're going to
[53:04] stick out if you stand up for the things
[53:06] of God we're living in a day of pressure
[53:08] but we need somebody that is bold we
[53:11] need somebody that is fearless that
[53:13] ain't afraid to stand on the Promises of
[53:16] God let the doubter say what they want
[53:18] to but I've got something on the inside
[53:20] that I'm standing for I'm not standing
[53:22] for a Creed I'm standing for the word of
[53:25] God oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon M
[53:29] Contin wand in that quote if it's
[53:31] absolutely revealed to you that God is
[53:33] going to heal you you're going to get it
[53:35] you're going to get it I don't care
[53:37] what's wrong with you what the what the
[53:39] odds are it may be worse than David and
[53:42] Goliath but if it's revealed to you oh
[53:45] Hallelujah that's when exploits starts
[53:47] to come into come into into action when
[53:50] it's revealed to you it don't matter the
[53:53] odds that are stacking against you it
[53:55] don't matter what is coming against you
[53:57] if it's revealed to you it don't matter
[54:00] the odds but you see it's recognizing
[54:03] God that is going to bring forth
[54:05] exploits and you remember the two that
[54:07] walked on the road to EMAs they were
[54:09] talking about a Jesus of yesterday and
[54:11] they fa to identify him as a Jesus of
[54:14] today and we know that what the Bible
[54:16] tells us they were walking on the road
[54:18] talking about Jesus of yesterday and
[54:21] here Jesus would come on their midst and
[54:23] say who you're talking about and they
[54:24] would look at him and say are you a
[54:26] stranger
[54:26] in these parts you see that Jesus was a
[54:29] stranger before they could identify him
[54:32] but once they could identify him he was
[54:35] no longer a stranger but a reality oh
[54:38] come on now before you identify him he's
[54:41] a stranger but once you identify him
[54:44] that's somebody that knows their God you
[54:47] see what would happen after brother B
[54:49] tell us they invited Jesus in and then
[54:51] when he broke the bread their eyes was
[54:54] open what was their eyes open to the
[54:57] same way he broke the bread yesterday
[54:59] he's doing it today and so they realize
[55:02] that he's the same yesterday today and
[55:05] forever oh and little church once you
[55:07] identify him you realize that the god of
[55:10] my past is the god of my present the god
[55:13] that brought me this heart is going to
[55:15] take me through oh let me say this God
[55:17] ain't done with you God still has a plan
[55:19] on your life God ain't done with this
[55:21] church God still needs you God still
[55:24] needs Ministry God still needs deacon
[55:26] God still needs singers it's somebody
[55:29] that knows him and is saying the same
[55:31] God of yesterday is the god of today oh
[55:35] Hallelujah the god of yesterday is the
[55:38] god of today oh what did what did the
[55:41] burning tell Moses when he asked
[55:43] him who do I tell sent me the I am not
[55:46] the I was not the I'm going to be but
[55:48] the I am and that's what we need to say
[55:50] is the I am oh Hallelujah and I believe
[55:55] that's what Daniel is talking about the
[55:57] people that know their God or recognize
[55:59] their God will be strong and do exploits
[56:03] we'll be strong cuz brother Brown would
[56:04] tell us that the revelation of God is
[56:07] what gives the authority over the
[56:09] devil the revelation of God is what
[56:12] gives the authority over the devil and
[56:14] brother Brandon would tell us that
[56:16] nobody through the church ages should
[56:18] have to look back and wish they was with
[56:20] the apostles and and and I and I love
[56:23] the quote cuz brother Brandon would say
[56:25] there's no need to look back but look up
[56:27] he says Behold Him who is even now
[56:30] walking in the midst of the last AG's
[56:33] golden Candlestick he says the same God
[56:35] that was walking in the first golden
[56:37] Candlestick is walking here in the last
[56:40] and he would say there was no need to
[56:41] look back but look up Behold Him who is
[56:45] even now walking in the midst of the
[56:48] churches to all ages Behold Him who was
[56:51] the same yesterday today and forever who
[56:54] never changes either in essence or in
[56:56] his ways where two or three are gathered
[56:59] together in his name there he is in
[57:01] their midst not only in their midst as a
[57:04] complacent onlooker or as a recording
[57:07] Angel but there he stands expressing
[57:09] exactly what he is oh Hallelujah not
[57:13] just as a recording angel or a
[57:15] complacent onlooker but he's in the
[57:17] midst in the middle and I love that word
[57:19] midst in the midst is not just in the
[57:21] beginning not just in the ending but
[57:23] he's where you're at he's in the middle
[57:26] and when he comes in the midst that
[57:28] changes everything oh when he comes in
[57:30] the midst it changes every every aspect
[57:33] of the circumstance but you got to
[57:35] Behold Him and the word behold means to
[57:38] look oh brother Brandon would preach a
[57:40] message you got to look and live quit
[57:42] looking around at the serpents look at
[57:45] the brass serpent that was judged for
[57:47] you and is brought an atonement you got
[57:49] to get your eyes off of everything
[57:51] around you and behold him oh brother
[57:54] Brandon was saying Behold Him who is
[57:56] even now walking in the midst and you
[57:59] see John the Baptist would say in John
[58:01] 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus
[58:04] coming unto him and saith Behold the
[58:06] Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[58:09] the world or in other words look the
[58:11] Lamb of God and you see it was
[58:14] prophesied that there was going to be a
[58:16] redeemer cuz we know that the that
[58:18] through the Old Testament there was they
[58:20] were under the atonement of bulls and
[58:22] goats right and the blood of bulls and
[58:24] goats could never bring a remission of
[58:27] sins it just brought a forgiveness of
[58:29] sins right the Bible would tell us there
[58:31] in in in Leviticus Leviticus 4:35 for
[58:35] his sins that he hath committed and it
[58:37] shall be forgiven of him it's telling
[58:40] him if you go and slay a lamb the blood
[58:42] is going to forgive you so that would
[58:44] cover their sin or push the sin back but
[58:47] there was no remission you see a
[58:49] forgiveness forgives you but a remission
[58:52] separates you the word remission means
[58:55] to be separated or to be loose from
[58:57] prison or from the binds that bound you
[59:00] oh my so when Christ comes we didn't
[59:02] bring a forgiveness he brought a
[59:04] remission oh Hallelujah so when John
[59:07] looked and said Behold the Lamb of God
[59:10] he says look here's our remission you
[59:12] got to Behold Him you've got to identify
[59:15] him he's not just bringing a covering
[59:17] he's bringing a separation oh Hallelujah
[59:21] cuz the blood of bulls and goats if you
[59:22] would come to the Tabernacle and slay a
[59:25] lamb for lying you leave with that lying
[59:27] nature right so there was no atonement
[59:29] there was no Deliverance in that type
[59:32] but when Christ come brother brand would
[59:34] say all of the types in the Old
[59:36] Testament was met in Jesus so everything
[59:39] that Abraham had was in Jesus everything
[59:42] that the brast serpent had was in Jesus
[59:45] the Mana in the wilderness was in Jesus
[59:48] The Rock in the wilderness was in Jesus
[59:51] the the uh the the uh the Shak Glory was
[59:54] in Jesus everything thing that they had
[59:57] in the Old Testament in types or in
[59:59] portion was now in the fullness of Jesus
[1:00:03] Oh Hallelujah in a little church we've
[1:00:06] went through sanctification brother
[1:00:07] Brandon would tell us sanctification
[1:00:09] made way for justification or
[1:00:11] justification made way for
[1:00:12] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:00:15] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:00:17] there's another step of it but he says
[1:00:19] but the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:00:21] way for the Holy Ghost himself the
[1:00:23] perfect word to come in perfection oh
[1:00:26] Hallelujah and so everything the
[1:00:29] justification had is in this fullness oh
[1:00:32] come on now everything the
[1:00:34] sanctification had is in this fullness
[1:00:37] everything the 1906 had is in this
[1:00:40] fullness so in other words what they had
[1:00:43] in portion we got in fullness we don't
[1:00:45] just got a glare of another day we got
[1:00:48] the light we got the fullness in the
[1:00:50] evening time it shall be like we're not
[1:00:53] in a glare we're in the fullness the has
[1:00:56] been given us so whenever whenever John
[1:00:58] looked and said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:01:01] he was pointing them to somebody and
[1:01:03] brother Brandon would tell us that John
[1:01:05] was the attraction but whenever Christ
[1:01:08] come he says the attraction went from
[1:01:10] the prophet to the prophecy oh
[1:01:13] Hallelujah and we know brother brandom
[1:01:15] would come and forun the second coming
[1:01:17] of Christ he was pointing to something
[1:01:19] and brother brandom will tell us he's
[1:01:21] bringing to you the reality of Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ brother Brandon will tell us
[1:01:26] there's a difference between the
[1:01:27] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:01:29] Christ he says the appearing is he is
[1:01:31] here in the fullness of his power so
[1:01:34] here come brother the brand I'm telling
[1:01:36] you Behold Him who was walking now in
[1:01:39] the midst oh little church we're not
[1:01:42] walking this road by yourself we're not
[1:01:44] walking this road in confusion but the
[1:01:47] very word that said let there be light
[1:01:49] is the very word that has been given to
[1:01:52] us in the midst of your circumstance oh
[1:01:55] I believe the God of all possibility
[1:01:57] goes to work with you the God of all
[1:01:59] possibility is in the kitchen with you
[1:02:02] when you're preparing food for your
[1:02:03] family the God of all possibility ain't
[1:02:06] a God of yesterday but he's a god of
[1:02:08] today he's not in Jerusalem he's not in
[1:02:11] Jeffersonville but deity the God of all
[1:02:13] possibility is living inside of a
[1:02:16] housewife he's living inside of a mother
[1:02:19] oh Hallelujah it ain't a God in our
[1:02:21] imagination but we know him we beheld
[1:02:25] him we see him we've experienced the
[1:02:28] realities of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:02:33] it's Bri a separation oh this message
[1:02:36] has separated us has separated us from
[1:02:38] the rest of the church members and Has
[1:02:40] Lifted us up into a bright age where
[1:02:42] we're not just walking in confusion but
[1:02:44] we know who we are where the Brandon
[1:02:46] would tell us this is the fourth light
[1:02:49] and he would say what is the fourth
[1:02:50] light he says it's the word made
[1:02:53] manifest oh Hallelujah he says it's the
[1:02:56] word made manifest it's the proof of the
[1:02:59] Resurrection sign and what was the
[1:03:01] resurrection sign brother the or the
[1:03:03] Bible would tell us that they come to
[1:03:05] Jesus and would say give us a sign and
[1:03:08] Jesus would tell them as as Jonah was in
[1:03:11] the belly of the well for three days and
[1:03:12] nights so will the son of man be in the
[1:03:15] belly of the Earth for three days and
[1:03:17] nights and so we know whenever Christ
[1:03:19] went into the grave God never died the
[1:03:21] body died right cuz brother Brandon
[1:03:23] would tell us that Jesus he would go to
[1:03:26] go to hell and would preach to the souls
[1:03:28] that were in prison he would go to
[1:03:30] paradise and would set them free from
[1:03:32] from from the the blood of bulls and
[1:03:34] ghosts there was a remission now that
[1:03:35] they could go up with Jesus right and so
[1:03:38] in order for the resurrection sign to
[1:03:40] take place and there to be proof the
[1:03:43] body had to come out of the Tomb and in
[1:03:45] order for the body to come out of the
[1:03:47] Tomb life had to come back to it oh come
[1:03:51] on now so whenever life come back to the
[1:03:53] body then the body would come out of the
[1:03:56] Tomb proving that the resurrection sign
[1:03:59] is being fulfilled and brother Brandon
[1:04:02] would say the fourth line is the proof
[1:04:04] of the Resurrection sign today it's the
[1:04:07] same life that brought Christ out of the
[1:04:09] Grave is the same life that has brought
[1:04:12] us out of ideas out of traditions
[1:04:14] hallelujah it's the same life comeing to
[1:04:17] a body saying you are the resurrection
[1:04:19] sign your proof that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:22] alive and well inside of your skins it's
[1:04:25] the word made manifest inside of a bride
[1:04:28] body oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would
[1:04:30] say that the Old Testament and the New
[1:04:33] Testament his husband and wife and he
[1:04:35] would say Jesus fulfilled the Old
[1:04:37] Testament and his bride fulfills the New
[1:04:39] Testament oh you've got scripture to
[1:04:42] fulfill and you know you're God you
[1:04:45] can't help but fulfill the promises that
[1:04:48] God has for your life oh what I say is
[1:04:50] it's time to defy the pressure defy all
[1:04:54] of the naysayers the comes against you
[1:04:56] all the doubters that comes against your
[1:04:58] mind I say it's time to throw them out
[1:05:01] come on now let's throw out those evil
[1:05:03] thoughts let's throw out the complexes
[1:05:05] let's throw it out so that we can see
[1:05:08] God who he really
[1:05:10] is oh hallelujah it's proud of
[1:05:14] Separation oh my brother Brandon would
[1:05:16] tell us whenever whenever uh uh whenever
[1:05:20] Mary recognized Jesus at Simon's house
[1:05:23] remember when she washed his feet
[1:05:24] brother brandom says when she recognized
[1:05:26] him it released to her forgiveness of
[1:05:29] sins oh my forgiveness of sins and so in
[1:05:32] other words whenever he whenever she
[1:05:35] recognized him it opened up a channel
[1:05:37] for her Deliverance oh it's opened up a
[1:05:40] channel for her deliverance and little
[1:05:42] church there's been a channel that has
[1:05:45] been opened up in this generation where
[1:05:47] we're on talking terms with God you
[1:05:49] don't got to go to a pope somewhere and
[1:05:51] try to talk to God there's a channel
[1:05:54] that has been opened up you know with
[1:05:55] the Brandon would tell us that stepen
[1:05:58] was so full of hidden power that
[1:06:00] whenever he was being stoned he says
[1:06:02] that spirit that was upon him would go
[1:06:05] through the stars go through the mist
[1:06:07] and go all the way up till he could see
[1:06:10] Jesus standing at the right hand of the
[1:06:12] father and so so the spirit that was
[1:06:15] upon him would defy his natural
[1:06:18] circumstances come on I'm preaching now
[1:06:21] it would def even though he was being
[1:06:23] stoned even though he was being
[1:06:25] persecuted
[1:06:26] what was on the inside would break into
[1:06:28] the realities of who Jesus was oh you
[1:06:31] might go through some hard times you
[1:06:33] might go through some circumstances
[1:06:35] where you don't feel like you can press
[1:06:37] on but there's a channel that has been
[1:06:39] opened up to the throne room of God
[1:06:42] where you can get on your knees and say
[1:06:44] God I'm in need of some of some healing
[1:06:47] I'm in need of some encouragement I'm in
[1:06:51] need oh hallelujah it's somebody that
[1:06:54] knows their God and channel has been
[1:06:56] opened up I say it's time to defy the
[1:06:59] ODS and start claiming the promises of
[1:07:02] God this ain't time to lay down the word
[1:07:04] it's time to pick it up it's time to
[1:07:06] pick up this word and say my mind is
[1:07:09] mine my body is mine oh Hallelujah the
[1:07:12] Holy Ghost is mine a renewing is mine a
[1:07:15] sound of mind is mine oh I don't care
[1:07:18] what the devil will stole from you
[1:07:20] there's a channel that has been opened
[1:07:22] up there might be depression that is
[1:07:24] upon your mind there's a channel that
[1:07:26] has been opened up there might be
[1:07:28] oppression that is coming against you
[1:07:30] there's a channel that has been opened
[1:07:32] up oh Hallelujah all the way to the
[1:07:35] throne room of God once this lady
[1:07:38] recognized Jesus there was a channel
[1:07:41] that was opened up and brother Brandon
[1:07:43] would tell us that she was redeemable
[1:07:46] from before the woman up the whale was
[1:07:48] redeemable from before the foundation of
[1:07:50] the world and whenever she recognized
[1:07:53] Jesus brother brandom says it redeemed
[1:07:55] her back to that image oh Hallelujah God
[1:07:58] didn't see her as a prostitute he had an
[1:08:01] image of perfection oh come on now God
[1:08:04] didn't see her as somebody that had a
[1:08:07] lot of blame against her he seen her
[1:08:09] blameless and whenever she recognize who
[1:08:12] Jesus was that image that was in God's
[1:08:15] mind would be brought back to that body
[1:08:18] oh little church we've identified who
[1:08:20] this word is and it's brought the image
[1:08:23] of who God is inside of life he didn't
[1:08:26] see you Bound by depression he seen you
[1:08:29] free in the spirit he didn't see you
[1:08:31] Bound by complexes he seen you with the
[1:08:33] freedom of worship and when you identify
[1:08:36] him that channel brings the thoughts of
[1:08:39] God inside of your body and you manifest
[1:08:42] it oh that's why we're here on Earth is
[1:08:44] to manifest the thoughts of God oh the
[1:08:47] devil likes to tell you that you're an
[1:08:49] accident you're a nobody you're a cast
[1:08:51] away but you are the very fulfillment of
[1:08:54] scripture for this generation the very
[1:08:57] purpose of you being on Earth is to
[1:08:59] fulfill your part of scripture oh don't
[1:09:02] let complexes take away the certainty of
[1:09:06] what God has done for you in this
[1:09:08] generation amen oh brother the Brandon
[1:09:11] will tell us the body of Christ is one
[1:09:13] Spirit where every member from Pentecost
[1:09:16] to this time drinks of the same new wine
[1:09:19] the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the
[1:09:21] same results how do we do it by one
[1:09:24] spirit it's God God's open door oh
[1:09:27] hallelujah it's God's open door and he
[1:09:29] says the Holy Spirit he says what is it
[1:09:33] it's God's open door it's a sign it's a
[1:09:36] seal it's a comforter it's an advocate
[1:09:39] it's an assurance it's a rest it's a
[1:09:41] peace it's goodness it's healing it's
[1:09:43] life it's God's open door to all of
[1:09:46] these things oh so there's a channel
[1:09:49] that has opened up in the Bible it tells
[1:09:51] us that God opens doors that no man can
[1:09:53] shut and shuts doors that no man can
[1:09:56] open so if God has opened up a channel
[1:09:59] has opened up a door to the bride that
[1:10:02] means nobody can shut it oh come on now
[1:10:06] that means all of Heaven has been poured
[1:10:08] out upon this bride there's an open door
[1:10:11] there's a channel that has brought you
[1:10:13] to the throne room of the king you
[1:10:15] remember Esther for such a time as this
[1:10:18] you have been placed here and what would
[1:10:20] Esther do she would have to defy the
[1:10:22] odds oh come on there's too many Esters
[1:10:24] today that has the potential of her word
[1:10:27] being materialized but she can't defy
[1:10:30] the odds little Esther had complexes and
[1:10:33] insecurities they were telling her now
[1:10:35] if you go before the king you're going
[1:10:36] to be denied if you go before the king
[1:10:39] you're going to be disappointed if you
[1:10:41] go before the king he's going to kill
[1:10:43] you but once she step past that and come
[1:10:45] before the king the king have the golden
[1:10:48] scepter and when see whatever you ask it
[1:10:50] will be given to you oh somebody had to
[1:10:53] defy the odds for such a time as that
[1:10:57] was her fulfillment the very reason she
[1:11:00] was placed in the kingdom was for her to
[1:11:02] come before the king oh little church
[1:11:04] the very reason that you've been placed
[1:11:06] here is because there's a channel that
[1:11:09] has been opened up there's an open door
[1:11:11] you can come before the king with your
[1:11:14] petition you can come before the king
[1:11:16] with your
[1:11:18] request
[1:11:20] Hallelujah even now he's walking in the
[1:11:22] midst of the candlesticks in the midst
[1:11:25] oh Hallelujah not as going place an
[1:11:27] onlooker but he's walking in the midst
[1:11:30] and when he comes in the midst it
[1:11:32] changes
[1:11:33] everything you remember the three Hebrew
[1:11:35] boys that were thrown into the fiery
[1:11:37] furnace we know the story it's a simple
[1:11:39] story but the Bible says they were bound
[1:11:41] hand and foot and thrown in the midst of
[1:11:44] the fire and the Bible would say that
[1:11:46] the king will look and say did we throw
[1:11:48] four three men bound into the midst of
[1:11:51] the fire three men bound but then he
[1:11:54] looks again says how come there's four
[1:11:56] men loosed in the midst in the midst
[1:12:00] whenever God come in the midst then that
[1:12:03] bounds that were that were binding them
[1:12:05] would be loosed oh that's what happens
[1:12:09] when he comes in the midst nothing could
[1:12:11] hold your mind that's what happens when
[1:12:13] he comes in the midst there's a liberty
[1:12:16] a freedom of worship oh come on now you
[1:12:19] remember the the little woman that was
[1:12:20] caught in the act of adultery the Bible
[1:12:23] says they threw her at the feet of Jesus
[1:12:25] Jesus and so that they could accuse him
[1:12:27] they were trying to accuse him but the
[1:12:30] Bible would say he was the perfect lamb
[1:12:32] even pilot would say I find no fault in
[1:12:34] him right he was Perfection there was
[1:12:37] nothing against him and here would come
[1:12:39] a prostitute that was caught in the act
[1:12:41] of adultery that didn't that have blamed
[1:12:44] against her but then Jesus will look
[1:12:46] down and will start to write in the hand
[1:12:48] and will look up and would say where
[1:12:50] were thine accusers hath no man
[1:12:52] condemned thee Oh hath no and God didn't
[1:12:55] a condemn her man condemned her oh and
[1:12:58] too many times we're condemned what men
[1:13:00] say say about us come on now people's
[1:13:03] words can condemn our heart where we are
[1:13:06] we're scarred we don't got we have no
[1:13:08] courage we've got no Authority I'm
[1:13:10] preaching now but what God what what
[1:13:12] what God thinks of you is different than
[1:13:14] what complexes think of you have no man
[1:13:17] condemned thee and so he looked at her
[1:13:20] and would say neither do I condemn thee
[1:13:22] so the Perfection that he would have in
[1:13:25] himself he would bestow to a prostitute
[1:13:28] that needed to be stoned oh and the
[1:13:31] Bible would say when he stood up he says
[1:13:33] he was alone in the midst in the midst
[1:13:36] all of the accusers were gone all the
[1:13:38] ones that condemned her was gone and she
[1:13:40] stood in the midst of him oh that's what
[1:13:43] happens when he comes in the midst
[1:13:45] complexes what people say against you
[1:13:47] are gone oh Hallelujah I don't care what
[1:13:50] words have been coming against you he's
[1:13:52] in the
[1:13:53] midst he's in the midst the Bible would
[1:13:56] say us if a heart condemn us not then we
[1:13:59] are boldness that's why the Devil comes
[1:14:01] with words and with with complexes with
[1:14:04] with bitterness and with gossip against
[1:14:06] you trying to take away your confidence
[1:14:09] but he has com in the midst that there's
[1:14:12] no condemnation against your heart
[1:14:14] there's no complexes Hallelujah I say
[1:14:17] it's it's time to Behold Him let's
[1:14:20] recognize him let's see him as who he is
[1:14:23] we're a people that know our God we're
[1:14:26] not somebody that is condemned we're
[1:14:28] somebody that knows Our God hallelujah
[1:14:32] there's a separation he's brought a
[1:14:35] remission of
[1:14:36] sins Hallelujah he's brought a
[1:14:40] separation that separation ain't just
[1:14:42] for sins that separation is for
[1:14:45] complexes that separation is for a
[1:14:47] condemned heart that is brought by
[1:14:49] naysayers the separation has come to let
[1:14:52] you know that I am in the mid
[1:14:56] you can behold
[1:14:57] me hallelujah hallelujah you can behold
[1:15:02] me oh Hallelujah I've come in the midst
[1:15:06] the Bible would say in Romans 3:25 for
[1:15:08] the remission of sins that are passed oh
[1:15:11] Hallelujah the remission of sins that
[1:15:13] are passed not just present Sins Not
[1:15:16] Just sins you might commit tomorrow but
[1:15:18] the sins you've committed yesterday
[1:15:20] there's a remission you see that that's
[1:15:22] another spirit that comes against you is
[1:15:24] condemn
[1:15:25] that says I know what you did yesterday
[1:15:27] I Know What You Did 10 years ago I know
[1:15:29] how you done that and how you done this
[1:15:31] there's a remission of sins of the past
[1:15:33] and not just the sins of today but the
[1:15:36] sins of the past there's a separation if
[1:15:39] you can be ho
[1:15:40] him oh Hallelujah so recognizing him
[1:15:45] brother brandom says recognizing him
[1:15:47] releases his power recognizing can
[1:15:50] releases his power because we know that
[1:15:52] the soldier smacked Jesus and felt no
[1:15:55] virtue smacked him and said tell us who
[1:15:57] hit you but then there was a woman with
[1:15:59] the issue of blood that would touch the
[1:16:01] same vessel but released to her the
[1:16:04] resurrection what released to her virtue
[1:16:07] you see you got to recognize him oh my
[1:16:09] too many people get become so critical
[1:16:12] that they fa to recognize him oh my I'm
[1:16:15] feeling good up here too many people
[1:16:17] become so critical that they fail to see
[1:16:20] that the one that the preacher preaches
[1:16:22] about is a god of today and he's my
[1:16:26] god oh hallelujah it's time to throw the
[1:16:30] critic on this up the door let's throw

[1:16:56] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:16:58] the Rich Young Ruler didn't recognize
[1:17:00] who Jesus was he heard the same words of
[1:17:03] life that didn't do nothing for him but
[1:17:05] here here Legion would hear the same
[1:17:08] life the same words and would set him
[1:17:10] free oh Hallelujah brother the Brandon
[1:17:13] would tell us the pilate didn't
[1:17:15] recognize who Jesus was and would later
[1:17:17] on go insane and commit suicide one was
[1:17:20] bound the other was free what what made
[1:17:23] the separation what made the difference
[1:17:26] recognizing oh Hallelujah we we we we've
[1:17:29] got something in this generation but the
[1:17:31] Brandon would tell us here he says when
[1:17:33] he is not recognized his power is always
[1:17:36] not revealed when he is not recognized
[1:17:38] no matter how much God Is Standing
[1:17:40] present you got to believe it like the
[1:17:43] woman with the issue of blood with the
[1:17:45] blood issue all of them were passing by
[1:17:47] all of them were standing up saying
[1:17:49] there goes the rabbi that's the guy that
[1:17:51] claims to be a prophet that's the
[1:17:53] fanatic all all such as that but what
[1:17:56] happened the little woman had a blood
[1:17:58] issue had issue of blood and she had
[1:18:00] heard about him and when she come down
[1:18:02] there regardless of what anybody said
[1:18:05] she recognized who he was regardless of
[1:18:09] what anybody said hey words are
[1:18:12] powerful come on now words are powerful
[1:18:15] words can uplift words can destroy words
[1:18:17] can heal words can bruise words are
[1:18:20] powerful but she didn't care what the
[1:18:22] words was she recognized him
[1:18:25] come on now she didn't care what the
[1:18:27] words was she recognized him and he
[1:18:30] would continue on to say and she said if
[1:18:32] I can only touch His Garment see and
[1:18:34] when that genuine faith in God become a
[1:18:37] positive thing to her what did it
[1:18:39] release it released to her his power to
[1:18:41] heal her oh Hallelujah it released her
[1:18:45] his power to heal her it touched him in
[1:18:47] such a way he turned around and told her
[1:18:50] what was wrong with her your faith has
[1:18:52] saved you what did Faith other standing
[1:18:55] there might have been sicker than she
[1:18:57] was but you see she recognized his
[1:18:59] presence she know that that was her
[1:19:02] opportunity amen she know this was her
[1:19:06] opportunity oh I know it might be just a
[1:19:08] Sunday morning this morning but
[1:19:09] recognize this is your
[1:19:11] opportunity oh words that have hurt you
[1:19:14] this is your opportunity complexes that
[1:19:16] have kept you this is your opportunity
[1:19:19] hurts and bitterness that has kept you
[1:19:21] this is your opportunity others might
[1:19:24] not care the one across the aisle might
[1:19:26] not care but the woman that had a need
[1:19:28] she cared she cared she wasn't going to
[1:19:32] let this moment pass by little church
[1:19:34] it's time to start caring again I care
[1:19:36] this service is my service I don't care
[1:19:39] who's preaching I don't care who's
[1:19:40] singing this is my opportunity I want to
[1:19:43] see Jesus I want to see the power of God
[1:19:46] I want to see the hurts in my life
[1:19:48] healed I want to see the bitterness that
[1:19:50] was brought by words healed Hallelujah I
[1:19:53] want to know my God not just in a form
[1:19:56] not just in a a ritual but I want to
[1:19:58] know the
[1:20:00] realities I want to know the
[1:20:02] realities this is my
[1:20:05] opportunity I'm recognizing God oh
[1:20:09] Hallelujah whenever jeras recognized the
[1:20:12] presence of God and released to him the
[1:20:13] resurrection power oh his daughter was
[1:20:16] dead but he recognized something and
[1:20:19] want say I'm a man I'm a man of
[1:20:21] authority I'm a man if I say I say
[1:20:23] Allegiance they go they come they go but
[1:20:26] you speak the word you speak the word
[1:20:28] and my servant will be healed oh
[1:20:31] Hallelujah it was the words it was
[1:20:33] somebody recognizing God and so the
[1:20:36] exploits of faith is going to come by
[1:20:38] understanding who God is not a god of
[1:20:40] yesterday but a god of today not a god
[1:20:44] of tomorrow but a god of today then that
[1:20:46] produces exploits then the people shall
[1:20:49] be strong we're living in a day of
[1:20:52] weariness come on we're living in a day
[1:20:54] of Mind batt battles we're living in a
[1:20:56] day where we're hard it's man I wake up
[1:20:58] in the morning and I'm tired my goodness
[1:21:00] it's the spirits of the enemy that
[1:21:02] fights the mind but the people that know
[1:21:04] their God shall be strong oh shall be
[1:21:07] strong spiritually they know their God
[1:21:09] they're not just a weakling but there's
[1:21:11] some Faith muscles come on now there's
[1:21:13] some Faith muscles that can take the
[1:21:15] word of God it's somebody that knows
[1:21:17] they're God and they're strong oh
[1:21:20] Hallelujah but you see the Bible tells
[1:21:22] us of two different people and what's
[1:21:24] going to separate these two is
[1:21:26] understanding who God is cuz if you read
[1:21:28] the the Daniel 11 it's it's it's an
[1:21:31] incredible scripture because it's
[1:21:33] painting a dark story of what's going on
[1:21:36] how there's judgment how's there's this
[1:21:37] but then he stops and he says but the
[1:21:40] people he makes a separation that
[1:21:42] they're going to do their thing they're
[1:21:44] going to go on in their sins they're
[1:21:46] going to go on but the people that know
[1:21:48] my God and I believe that this is
[1:21:50] talking about a literal people not just
[1:21:52] a figurative people not just an imag Ary
[1:21:55] people but brother Brandon takes this
[1:21:57] scripture in the end time and says now
[1:21:59] is the time he says the church world has
[1:22:01] been given their opportunity to see him
[1:22:04] but they rejected their very Messiah but
[1:22:06] the people there's somebody that is
[1:22:08] going to know him and I believe it's not
[1:22:11] just a random people but it's a chosen
[1:22:13] people cuz if it wasn't a chosen people
[1:22:16] you would have rejected your chance as
[1:22:18] well but because you're chosen you've
[1:22:20] identified him and brother Brandon would
[1:22:22] tell us that there's only one who can
[1:22:24] seek him that's the one who is
[1:22:26] predestinated to see him or he says
[1:22:29] otherwise you'll never see him and he
[1:22:31] talked about the Jews he says their very
[1:22:33] Messiah was in their midst and they fell
[1:22:36] to see him but it's because of
[1:22:38] predestination you can't help but seek
[1:22:40] him oh Hallelujah brother Brandon going
[1:22:42] talk about Abraham and said no us God
[1:22:44] when he called Abraham he didn't say
[1:22:46] Abraham if you would do a certain thing
[1:22:48] I would do a certain thing he says
[1:22:50] Abraham I had already done it not what
[1:22:53] you did what I did God said he says now
[1:22:55] when he made made a covenant with Adam
[1:22:57] if you'll not touch that tree you'll
[1:22:58] live forever Adam broke it Moses and
[1:23:01] them if you keep the Commandments I'll
[1:23:03] do so and so if you break the
[1:23:04] Commandments I'll do so and so when God
[1:23:06] makes a covenant with man man breaks his
[1:23:09] Covenant with God but so that the
[1:23:11] elected the church the elected people
[1:23:14] the called out separated group of people
[1:23:16] would sure to be saved God called them
[1:23:19] by his grace oh God wanted to make sure
[1:23:23] you are sure to be saved he called you
[1:23:25] by Grace he knew oh Hallelujah he knew
[1:23:29] words were going to hurt you but he
[1:23:30] would say my grace is sufficient you
[1:23:32] remember the Apostle Paul he was he was
[1:23:34] praying about about what was coming
[1:23:36] against him and he says I asked the Lord
[1:23:38] three times take this from me and he
[1:23:40] says each time God come back and says my
[1:23:43] grace is sufficient for thee your
[1:23:45] weakness is made in your weakness my
[1:23:48] strength is made perfect in other words
[1:23:50] my grace is going to bring forth
[1:23:53] exploits in your weakness oh my you see
[1:23:56] God can't God can't perform Supernatural
[1:23:59] things if there's nothing to perform
[1:24:01] right how would you know God could heal
[1:24:03] if you never was sick how could you know
[1:24:05] God can deliver if you never was bound
[1:24:07] so God's grace takes the weakness and
[1:24:10] perfects his strength in it oh he brings
[1:24:13] a perfect perfect strength in human
[1:24:15] weakness that's why God has come to
[1:24:18] humanity he wanted to get glory in the
[1:24:21] midst of it all he couldn't get glory in
[1:24:22] the Angels they were perfect he couldn't
[1:24:24] get Glory but he come to Fallen human
[1:24:26] beings he come to somebody that had mind
[1:24:29] battles and through them he would reveal
[1:24:32] to them who he was so that there could
[1:24:34] be exploits oh Hallelujah cuz everybody
[1:24:38] is trying to be the people everybody
[1:24:40] wants to be the bride of Christ but you
[1:24:42] can't choose the body God has to choose
[1:24:44] you and you see it's the favor of God
[1:24:47] coming to election it's because God has
[1:24:49] chose you this message will pour out
[1:24:52] God's favor upon you the Bible would
[1:24:54] tell us while Daniel he was praying for
[1:24:56] 21 days y'all remember that and he felt
[1:24:59] like nothing was coming but then the
[1:25:01] angel would say this in Daniel 9:22 and
[1:25:04] and and he informed me this is Daniel
[1:25:06] speaking and he informed me and talked
[1:25:09] with me and said oh Daniel I have now
[1:25:11] come forth to give thee skill and
[1:25:14] understanding at the beginning of thy
[1:25:16] supplications the Commandment came forth
[1:25:19] and I am come to show thee for thou were
[1:25:22] greatly beloved therefore understand
[1:25:24] understand the matter consider the
[1:25:26] vision oh I just love that since you
[1:25:29] were greatly Beloved the word beloved
[1:25:31] means greatly loved dear to the heart of
[1:25:33] God since he was dear to the heart of
[1:25:35] God God would send an angel with a
[1:25:37] message and would say consider the
[1:25:39] vision consider the vision and I say
[1:25:42] little church consider the vision this
[1:25:44] ain't your end you're not going to go
[1:25:45] down in discouragement you're going up
[1:25:48] you're going up as The Virtuous
[1:25:49] blood-washed bride of Jesus Christ but
[1:25:51] you got to consider the vision you see
[1:25:54] people like the vision but they don't
[1:25:55] want to consider the vision they don't
[1:25:57] want to get in the vision they don't
[1:25:59] want to dig in the tapes God has sent us
[1:26:01] a message in this generation to bring
[1:26:04] ausing to bring him in the midst that we
[1:26:07] can seek Him who he is but I just love
[1:26:09] that nobody else was getting an angel
[1:26:12] but the one that was dear to the heart
[1:26:13] of God did nobody else has got an angel
[1:26:16] in this generation but the one that was
[1:26:18] dear to the heart of God you have got an
[1:26:20] angel in this generation but you see the
[1:26:23] bride has been separ ated by your
[1:26:25] understanding the Bible would tell us in
[1:26:27] John 15:6 you have not chosen me but I
[1:26:31] have chosen you so when when you was
[1:26:33] unable to choose God God still chose you
[1:26:36] when you was uncapable you remember
[1:26:37] Peter Peter said oh yeah God I'll stick
[1:26:40] with you Jesus I'm not going to deny you
[1:26:42] I'll go with you to the death I'm not
[1:26:44] going to deny you but in the time of
[1:26:46] pressure sometimes the pressure just
[1:26:48] gets to us come on now sometimes the
[1:26:50] bitterness just gets to us sometimes
[1:26:52] hurt feelings just get to us us and we
[1:26:55] we we just can't defy it but it's not
[1:26:57] over there's still a Grace for you cuz
[1:26:59] you remember after Peter denied Jesus
[1:27:02] says I I don't know him I never heard of
[1:27:04] him I I'm not one of us followers we we
[1:27:06] know the story whenever Christ went to
[1:27:08] the Grave come back up he met the two
[1:27:10] ladies that were walking to the to the
[1:27:12] to the tomb I believe and he would tell
[1:27:14] them go tell my disciples and tell Peter
[1:27:18] and tell Peter the one that's that lied
[1:27:21] the one that cursed the one that is in
[1:27:23] bitterness right now come on little
[1:27:25] church the one that is in hurt feelings
[1:27:27] right now the ones that is in complexes
[1:27:29] right now go tell them go tell them my
[1:27:32] grace is sufficient oh Hallelujah and
[1:27:35] I'm letting you know you might have
[1:27:36] fallen but get back up you might have
[1:27:38] fallen in bitterness but get back up you
[1:27:41] might have fallen in hurt feelings but
[1:27:43] get back up you might have fallen in
[1:27:46] criticalness but get back up he's
[1:27:49] resurrected and has come in the midst it
[1:27:51] says my grace is sufficient I have
[1:27:54] called you by what you can do I called
[1:27:56] you by what I can
[1:27:58] do it's not over my grace is for you
[1:28:02] I've called you by my grace
[1:28:04] Peter I know you might be out on a boat
[1:28:06] naked right now but my grace still
[1:28:08] called you before you lied my grace
[1:28:11] called you before you blasphemed my
[1:28:13] grace called you and before you was in
[1:28:15] bitterness his grace had called you oh
[1:28:18] Hallelujah his grace had called
[1:28:22] you oh Hallelujah the Lord whenever the
[1:28:26] Apostle Paul was denying Christ God
[1:28:28] still chose him oh Moses whenever he he
[1:28:32] he he was running running from his
[1:28:34] calling Grace still chose him Grace
[1:28:37] still chose him but it's when he met God
[1:28:39] face to face that he could perform
[1:28:41] exploits brother Brandon would tell us
[1:28:43] the burning bush had what he lacked what
[1:28:45] Moses needed was in the burning bush oh
[1:28:48] my and what we needed is inside of this
[1:28:50] message it has brought the same Pillar
[1:28:52] of Fire that was in the burning bush has
[1:28:55] been restored in this generation has
[1:28:57] been brought back in our midst you know
[1:28:59] brother brand of mat tell us the same
[1:29:00] Pillar of Fire the wrot the Old
[1:29:02] Testament wrot the New Testament is the
[1:29:05] same Pillar of Fire that is here
[1:29:07] interpreting what those other ones wrote
[1:29:10] oh we're not blind leading the blind
[1:29:12] we're following the pillar of fire it's
[1:29:14] briad an
[1:29:16] interpretation oh my I spoke about
[1:29:18] Nathaniel a few minutes ago but what did
[1:29:20] Jesus say to Nathaniel in John 1:47
[1:29:23] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and
[1:29:25] saith of him behold an Israelite in whom
[1:29:28] is no G Nathaniel saith unto him whence
[1:29:31] knowest thou me and Jesus answered and
[1:29:34] said unto him before that Philip called
[1:29:36] thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I
[1:29:39] saw you man that spoke to me you know
[1:29:42] you hear that all the time you read it
[1:29:44] all the time but when I was studying on
[1:29:45] these things that really spoke to me
[1:29:48] before he ever had a chance to see Jesus
[1:29:51] Jesus saw him oh Hallelujah now you I
[1:29:54] might be crazy but I believe it was
[1:29:56] inspiration that Phillip would go to
[1:29:58] Nathaniel and would say hey the
[1:29:59] messiah's here and God still pours out
[1:30:02] inspiration God still has a fivefold
[1:30:05] Ministry God still has a pastor that
[1:30:07] will come up and bring to you that God
[1:30:09] already saw you oh Hallelujah while you
[1:30:13] was still in your circumstance I saw you
[1:30:16] H Nathaniel while you was under the tree
[1:30:19] you might have been under the tree
[1:30:20] brokenhearted you might have been under
[1:30:22] the tree confused you might have been
[1:30:24] under the tree whatever put yourself
[1:30:26] under that tree this morning while you
[1:30:28] was under that tree with bitterness
[1:30:30] while you was under that tree with
[1:30:32] criticalness God already saw you and
[1:30:34] because God saw you he would bring a
[1:30:36] remission oh Hallelujah because God saw
[1:30:39] you he will bring a separation but you
[1:30:42] notice Jesus didn't just reveal to him
[1:30:45] that he already saw him but then he
[1:30:47] would say this in John 1:50 Jesus
[1:30:49] answered and said unto him because I
[1:30:51] said unto thee I saw thee under the fig
[1:30:53] tree believest thou Thou shalt see
[1:30:56] greater things than these in other words
[1:30:59] because I saw you you've got some
[1:31:01] greater things to produce since I saw
[1:31:04] you you've got exploits to produce and
[1:31:07] this message didn't just bring us that
[1:31:09] we was predestinated before the
[1:31:10] foundation of the world but he lets you
[1:31:12] know you're the briad body of Christ to
[1:31:15] manifest the word so you're not just God
[1:31:17] don't didn't just see you but he has
[1:31:19] fruits for you to produce he has
[1:31:22] exploits to for you to produce it's
[1:31:24] brought to you the power of the
[1:31:27] Resurrection oh Hallelujah many people
[1:31:30] want to perform the great big wonders
[1:31:32] wonders of the supernatural but they
[1:31:34] fail to see the little things you see
[1:31:36] exploits you know then like I said this
[1:31:38] has really been speaking to me I I
[1:31:40] remember you know as a minister I I've
[1:31:43] never seen a vision I've never
[1:31:44] prophesied before God's never never used
[1:31:47] me in that aspect but if that was the
[1:31:50] the the the the definition of exploits I
[1:31:53] would be left out
[1:31:54] you would be left out so exploits ain't
[1:31:57] always the great Supernatural exploits
[1:32:00] is the fruits oh come on now if God's
[1:32:03] working through you in Visions hey do it
[1:32:06] but if God's working through you through
[1:32:07] just the life don't fail to see the
[1:32:09] exploits don't fail to see God's working
[1:32:12] in you don't fail to see that I might
[1:32:15] not sing I might not preach but what God
[1:32:17] has given you something to do you might
[1:32:19] be a prayer Warrior you might be
[1:32:21] somebody that testifies maybe you're
[1:32:23] just a wife that is raising up paradoxes
[1:32:26] come on now maybe maybe that's the way
[1:32:28] God sees you don't fail to see the way
[1:32:31] God sees you cuz you remember Gideon the
[1:32:34] Bible would tell us that Gideon would
[1:32:35] come to or the the angel of the Lord
[1:32:37] would come to Gideon and would say

[1:35:57] Supernatural is the life that's what's
[1:35:59] going to produce it oh my hope this is
[1:36:02] okay this morning I'll bring this down
[1:36:04] to a close here in a minute just bear
[1:36:06] with
[1:36:06] me but something that really was speak
[1:36:09] speaking in my heart as I was studying
[1:36:11] on these things but a lot of times
[1:36:13] mothers feel left out right I'm not a
[1:36:16] mother so I wouldn't know but watching
[1:36:18] my wife you know as we as we evangelize
[1:36:20] she's the one that's we're fighting with
[1:36:22] the children you know getting ready for
[1:36:24] church you know and I remember brother
[1:36:25] Danny steaman was preaching at brother
[1:36:27] Bryce Collins this past year and he says
[1:36:29] when he was evangelizing he said he
[1:36:31] preached man he felt good he come back
[1:36:33] to the car feeling great and he says his
[1:36:35] wife looked at him and says we need to
[1:36:36] get our lives right he says I was
[1:36:39] feeling great but she was fighting twins
[1:36:41] all service you know and sometimes the
[1:36:43] wives feel left out but you know brother
[1:36:45] Brandon would say You're The Fifth
[1:36:47] Gospel he was say it's Matthew Mark Luke
[1:36:49] John mothers you know cuz how come it's
[1:36:53] it was my Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:36:55] that brings the Life of Christ right
[1:36:57] it's the gospels that that bring the
[1:36:59] Life of Christ and it's the mothers that
[1:37:01] brings the The Life of Christ to the
[1:37:03] children brother Brandon would say that
[1:37:06] John would make the connection whenever
[1:37:07] he was on the boat with Jesus and he
[1:37:09] started to testify but the Brandon must
[1:37:11] say that John made the connection
[1:37:13] between Jesus and Jehovah because of the
[1:37:16] mother oh my so God has exploits from
[1:37:19] others brother brandom says God hides
[1:37:21] himself in Housewives he said says he
[1:37:23] hides himself from Little virgin girls
[1:37:25] he says he hides himself from the daddy
[1:37:27] that goes to work with his lunch under
[1:37:28] arm under his arm and he says they would
[1:37:31] do something that the Archbishop knows
[1:37:33] nothing about he says it's
[1:37:35] Simplicity it's God coming to the simple
[1:37:38] folks it's God coming to somebody that
[1:37:40] they don't know they're anything brother
[1:37:41] brandom says it's because they know
[1:37:43] they're nothing but God can do something
[1:37:45] through them oh man it's because your
[1:37:47] mothers feel like you're nobody but God
[1:37:50] can work through you you remember blind
[1:37:52] bmus it was blind B brother Brandon
[1:37:54] would tell us that his little his mother
[1:37:56] would set him on her knee and would tell
[1:37:57] her stories of Elisha of Elijah how
[1:38:01] Joshua would March around the walls and
[1:38:03] the walls would come fall down and all
[1:38:05] of a sudden I could just imagine you
[1:38:07] know here here here blind B ofus that
[1:38:09] have these stories growing up from his
[1:38:11] mother from The Fifth Gospel then he
[1:38:14] would hear a commotion right and brother
[1:38:15] Brandon would tell us there was a little
[1:38:17] girl that would say hey Jesus is coming
[1:38:19] by and now those stories that he heard
[1:38:22] of his mama he would make a connection
[1:38:26] with Jesus The Fifth Gospel would bring
[1:38:28] blind Bas she may have been off the
[1:38:31] scene but that Fifth Gospel brought a
[1:38:33] connection to his remission brought a
[1:38:36] connection to the separation of his
[1:38:39] blindness oh M don't get tired don't get
[1:38:43] discouraged don't get weary and wello
[1:38:45] because in due season you will reap if
[1:38:47] you faint not I know it's hard I know
[1:38:49] it's wearisome but keep on fighting keep
[1:38:52] on pressing on on there's a connection
[1:38:54] being made you see when you look at your
[1:38:57] children it's a paradox that your
[1:38:59] children are sitting in church we're
[1:39:01] living in a day of
[1:39:02] insanity it's a miracle nowadays if your
[1:39:05] kid don't turn to be a lesbian or a
[1:39:07] transgender we're living in a day where
[1:39:09] the pressure is so great but sitting on
[1:39:11] the pews this morning it's paradoxes but
[1:39:14] the random says the Paradox is something
[1:39:16] that that's impossible but yet it's true
[1:39:19] it's something that don't don't look
[1:39:20] fathomable but yet it's true to have
[1:39:23] children that love God they have
[1:39:25] children that lift their hands and
[1:39:26] worship God it's paradoxes because of a
[1:39:29] Fifth
[1:39:30] Gospel it's a paradox it don't seem
[1:39:33] possible but yes but yet it's true oh
[1:39:37] Hallelujah brother Brandon will talk
[1:39:39] about we'll talk about amram and jbed
[1:39:42] and you know and and it's the the
[1:39:44] message is called the teaching on Moses
[1:39:47] and I just encourage parents to listen
[1:39:48] to it if you get the time and it really
[1:39:50] I loved it because brother Brandon would
[1:39:52] say here jocked he was working and that
[1:39:55] the Lord would give him a vision that he
[1:39:57] was going to have a he was his his his
[1:39:59] son was going to be a redeemer and what
[1:40:02] really spoke to me because I've had
[1:40:03] these thoughts myself but jocked would
[1:40:06] say but this ain't the right time for a
[1:40:08] child because all the children you know
[1:40:11] it was such a it was such an evil time
[1:40:13] and he would say this ain't time to have
[1:40:15] a child and that really spoke to me I
[1:40:17] remember that when I got married I was
[1:40:19] said man this is an evil time it's why
[1:40:21] have children now you know know but here
[1:40:23] the Lord would speak to him and say I've
[1:40:25] got something for him to do and here
[1:40:28] here he would come here would come Moses
[1:40:30] and this part of the story really really
[1:40:32] struck out to me really stood out to me
[1:40:34] brother Brandon would say Pharaoh would
[1:40:36] get the get his courts together and you
[1:40:39] know they would come together and
[1:40:40] Pharaoh would say we got all these
[1:40:42] children that are coming up what should
[1:40:43] we do you know instead of wiping out the
[1:40:46] elders they went out to the children and
[1:40:48] you see that's what the devil's trying
[1:40:50] to do he can't get the elders he's going
[1:40:52] after the Next Generation
[1:40:53] that's why we need fifth gospels come on
[1:40:56] now whenever Jesus was upon the Earth
[1:40:58] who did Herod go after the gener the
[1:41:01] Next Generation he knew the promise was
[1:41:03] at hand the Deliverance was at hand so
[1:41:05] he would go to the Next Generation and
[1:41:07] here we are on the Third Exodus right
[1:41:09] it's time to go home who's he after the
[1:41:11] Next Generation but what stands in his
[1:41:14] way the Fifth Gospel it's the Fifth
[1:41:17] Gospel that stands in the way from the
[1:41:19] pressures of the world and the children
[1:41:20] at
[1:41:21] home oh man the brother Brandon mat tell
[1:41:24] us you know here jocked goes to work
[1:41:25] he's working on the he's working on the
[1:41:27] YK and he's singing I'm one I think it's
[1:41:29] I'm one of them he's singing he's
[1:41:30] singing he's working on this and brother
[1:41:32] Brandon would say he had a hiding place
[1:41:35] a secret place for Moses and he says in
[1:41:38] this court there would be some witches
[1:41:40] that would come up and would say I know
[1:41:41] what to do and he dramatizes it you hear
[1:41:43] you hear the kids laughing and and the
[1:41:45] mothers you know and he and he would
[1:41:47] come the Witch and say Lord leave king
[1:41:49] Pharaoh you know and he said I got
[1:41:50] something for you to do go after the
[1:41:52] children
[1:41:53] and here brother Brandon would say here
[1:41:55] come the soldiers the those witches the
[1:41:57] long-nosed witches he would call them
[1:41:59] banging on the door and he would and
[1:42:01] they would say I know you got a baby in
[1:42:03] there and brother Brandon makes a
[1:42:04] comment that I just love he says not one
[1:42:07] not one for you to have and oh I just
[1:42:09] love that I'm not saying we don't got
[1:42:11] one but we don't have one for you to get
[1:42:14] oh Fifth Gospel you the the devil might
[1:42:16] be taking this home he might be taking
[1:42:18] that teenager he might be taking this
[1:42:20] one and taking that one you don't got
[1:42:22] one to give this ain't time to give up
[1:42:25] this ain't time to lay down this ain't
[1:42:27] time to get discouraged this is time to
[1:42:29] stand somebody knows they God they're
[1:42:32] performing exploits you got paradoxes
[1:42:35] you've got exploits don't don't Del

[1:42:42] Hallelujah we don't got one for you to

[1:42:47] attitude Satan I don't got one for you I
[1:42:49] don't got one for you go to the next
[1:42:51] house and mother brandom said they would
[1:42:53] leave and say okay we'll come back and
[1:42:55] as they come back well the BAM says they
[1:42:56] had a hiding place they would hide that
[1:42:59] they would hide Moses in this hiding
[1:43:01] place and they would come in but
[1:43:02] couldn't find him cuz he was in The
[1:43:04] Hiding Place oh man there's a secret
[1:43:07] place that we can live in but the Bible
[1:43:09] will tell us there's a Peaceable
[1:43:11] habitation that we can dwell in a
[1:43:14] Peaceable habitation we're living in a
