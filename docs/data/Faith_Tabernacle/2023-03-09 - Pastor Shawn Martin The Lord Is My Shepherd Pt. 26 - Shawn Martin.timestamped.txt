[35:06] the paths of righteousness for
[35:09] his name's sake praise the Lord let's
[35:12] just bow our heads and talk to our
[35:15] father Lord Jesus
[35:18] we're so glad that you are on your
[35:20] throne Lord and
[35:22] that you alone are God
[35:25] father and that you reign in your
[35:28] kingdom your throne

[35:33] father and time doesn't stop it
[35:37] Lord situations that come up doesn't

[35:54] we're your people
[35:56] Lord and that we're in your hands
[35:59] and I pray father that you would come in
[36:03] a supreme way this evening and move Lord

[36:34] would subdue it here tonight and may
[36:37] your word Reign Among Us in Jesus
[36:40] Christ's name we pray and the church
[36:43] says
[36:44] amen and amen you can have your seats
[36:48] this evening
[36:49] and I'm going to continue along the
[36:52] subject and
[36:53] just failed to go this direction some
[36:57] more and that is he leadeth me in the
[36:59] paths of righteousness
[37:01] and um
[37:03] we know that God in every age has
[37:06] allotted his word from the beginning
[37:10] he's not trying to draw out a plan uh
[37:14] today but he's already drawn that plan
[37:17] out it's it's from the beginning
[37:20] and we've read this scripture there the
[37:23] prophet Isaiah
[37:25] 46 and 9. it says God says remember the
[37:30] former things of old for I am God and
[37:34] there is none else
[37:36] I am God and there is none like me
[37:40] declaring the end from the beginning
[37:44] and from ancient times to things that
[37:46] are not yet done saying my counsel shall
[37:50] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[37:54] calling a ravenous bird from the East
[37:56] the man that executeth my counsel from a
[37:59] far country yeah I have spoken it I will
[38:02] also bring it to pass I have purposed it
[38:06] I will also do it
[38:10] amen so we we find as as we've uh just
[38:15] uh been looking at this that brother
[38:17] Branham said righteousness is the word
[38:20] of God Amen so he leads us in the paths
[38:24] of righteousness in the paths of the
[38:26] word of God the Bible talking of Noah
[38:30] said he was a preacher of righteousness
[38:33] he was in other words he he preached the
[38:37] word for his day amen and so it was he
[38:42] was considered a preacher of
[38:43] righteousness and and you know I would
[38:46] say that as preachers that are preaching
[38:48] this message are we're preachers of
[38:51] righteousness amen and uh I I that's an
[38:54] honor to be uh hold that title amen and
[38:58] I believe that for a man to walk the
[39:01] paths of righteousness is to fulfill the
[39:05] word of God for this day or for his day
[39:10] and and so we we know that the word of
[39:13] God that God has allotted for this day
[39:17] it must be fulfilled it's it there
[39:20] there's no if ands or buts about it it
[39:22] must be fulfilled and and so Jesus said
[39:26] there uh uh I believe uh dwelled to John
[39:30] maybe in Matthew but he said it becometh
[39:33] us to fulfill all righteousness as it is
[39:37] it becometh a doctor to work in medicine
[39:40] and it becomes an electrician to work
[39:43] with electricity it becomes the painter
[39:46] to work with paint amen then it becomes
[39:49] the Believers to fulfill all
[39:52] righteousness it's it's just something
[39:54] that we do and so Jesus knew that when
[39:58] he had come uh that that he was to
[40:01] fulfill the word uh uh uh for his day
[40:05] there was a portion of word allotted a
[40:09] man for for him and so he knew uh uh and
[40:14] I think this is important that he knew
[40:17] that he was the sacrificial lamb he he
[40:21] knew that and so he had to fulfill every
[40:24] type of of a natural lamb uh that the
[40:29] natural lamb spoke of he was born at the
[40:31] same time uh Lambs were born he was born
[40:35] in the same environment that Lambs were
[40:38] born in as a sacrificial lamb he had to
[40:42] be washed before presented uh he had to
[40:45] be killed in the evening time and it had
[40:48] to be done before the high priest for he
[40:52] was the lamb and and so he had to
[40:55] fulfill uh all righteousness and he he
[40:59] also knew that he was the high priest
[41:01] and and so he he had to fulfill every
[41:04] type of the high priest in the in the
[41:07] Old Testament he had to be washed with
[41:09] water water before he could be anointed
[41:12] and he had to be anointed before he
[41:15] could offer the the sacrifice in the
[41:18] presence of God Amen and he knew these
[41:22] things and I think that's important he
[41:23] was aware of this he knew that he was to
[41:27] preach the gospel to the poor and to
[41:29] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[41:31] he knew that he was sent to heal the
[41:34] brokenhearted and to preach Deliverance
[41:37] to the captives and the recovering of
[41:39] sight to the blind he knew that he was
[41:43] to sit at Liberty them that are bruised
[41:46] the prophet said he knew that he he was
[41:50] sent for a Divine Purpose and he was
[41:52] determined to fulfill it for he knew
[41:55] what the Lord had said so he could place
[41:59] himself in the scriptures and knew that
[42:02] his life was to fulfill the prophecy he
[42:06] did not stumble along trying to figure
[42:09] it out trying to to figure out his
[42:11] purpose and wondering amen what the will
[42:14] of God was for his life he didn't walk
[42:16] around you know walk blindly and
[42:19] ignorantly not knowing the will of God
[42:21] for his day a man at the prophet said he
[42:25] believed what God Said was truth and he
[42:28] believes what God Said is the truth amen
[42:31] he believed a man what God Said was the
[42:34] truth and the words must be fulfilled
[42:38] and he knew what his life was to fulfill
[42:43] them see he was anointed and and so he
[42:46] was there for a Divine Purpose a man and
[42:51] so John even bore record of that saw the
[42:54] spirit of God like in the uh unto a dove
[42:58] descending down upon him and he heard a
[43:01] voice saying this is my uh beloved Son
[43:05] in whom I am pleased to dwell in a man
[43:09] and the prophet Prophet said it was God
[43:11] and man becoming one uniting together
[43:15] for Redemption so so as as Jesus was
[43:20] fulfilling the purpose of God for his
[43:23] life yet he knew that it was for a
[43:27] greater purpose a man and so there it
[43:30] was God and man God and human uh uh
[43:35] flesh uh uniting as one for Redemption a
[43:41] man and Redemption of who it would be
[43:44] his elect he come to redeem his elect do
[43:47] you believe that a man and so we we find
[43:51] that the
[43:56] the god of SP of all that covers space
[44:00] in time he he bottled himself into a
[44:03] human being amen and so that he could
[44:05] taste death amen for for the human race
[44:08] and and so it was as the prophet said it
[44:11] was the creator dying for his creation
[44:15] and and that was the purpose everything
[44:18] that Jesus done was to uh to open up the
[44:22] way and uh for Humanity for God to
[44:26] reconcile with man a man and so the
[44:30] prophet said God and man became one so
[44:33] that he could dwell in man and
[44:36] fellowship and it was God condescending
[44:40] trying to get uh to get to his man ain't
[44:43] that right so Jesus he had a direct
[44:46] purpose he knew he was the lamb he knew
[44:49] that he was the offering and the
[44:51] sacrifice the substitute and everything
[44:54] he'd done was for that purpose us a man
[44:57] to reconcile to show God unto human
[45:01] unto man and so he knew what his life
[45:05] was to fulfill now as we look at that
[45:08] day and we look at this day because we
[45:10] say that he's the same yesterday today
[45:13] and forever amen then then we find that
[45:17] he still knows the purpose amen he's
[45:20] still for this day amen and and I
[45:23] believe the bride understand and in his
[45:26] uh through the message of the hour uh
[45:29] the redeemed of the Lord is
[45:31] understanding their purpose and has the
[45:35] same understanding that Jesus did back
[45:37] then and has the the uh uh and and has
[45:41] that purpose a man for the prophet said
[45:44] she is flesh of his flesh he is bone of
[45:47] his bone she is life of his life she is
[45:50] him power of his power amen so as as he
[45:55] understood good and and his purpose so
[45:58] does the bride today understand their
[46:01] purpose amen now the churches don't
[46:04] understand their purpose because they're
[46:06] not part of him a man but every
[46:09] individual that makes up that bride they
[46:11] understand their purpose and their
[46:14] calling a man and and they they have
[46:17] this understanding and I'm so glad that
[46:19] God sent us a message to to to give us
[46:22] that understanding now the prophet said
[46:25] notice the harmony of the father and the
[46:28] son Jesus never did anything until it
[46:31] was first showed him by the father a man
[46:35] he said now this harmony is now to exist
[46:39] between the groom and the bride and his
[46:42] bride he shows her his Word of Life she
[46:46] receives it she never doubts it so think
[46:49] of that now and he reveals to her his
[46:52] Word of Life this this word that is for
[46:56] today and she receives it and never
[46:59] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[47:02] not even death for if the seed be
[47:04] planted the water will raise it up again
[47:07] and notice what he says here is the
[47:11] secret the word is in the bride the word
[47:15] is in the bride see as it was in Mary a
[47:20] man see it was revealed to Mary a man
[47:22] what her purpose was and what was
[47:25] happening and she said that be it unto
[47:28] me according to Thy word and so as it
[47:32] was in Mary so is the word in us the
[47:36] bride has the mind of Christ ain't that
[47:38] rhyme and she knows what he once done
[47:42] with the word and notice she performs
[47:45] the command of the word in his name for
[47:49] she has thus saith the Lord amen so how
[47:53] blessed we are to live in the this day a
[47:57] man not a people uh without
[48:00] understanding not a people that is
[48:02] groping in the darkness a man but a
[48:05] people that has understanding for he has
[48:09] shown us his word of life amen and she
[48:15] performs it in his name amen I truly
[48:19] believe that what Paul had prayed a man
[48:22] has now been made uh fulfilled a man for
[48:26] our eyes the eyes of our understanding
[48:29] has been enlightened Amen to know what
[48:34] is the hope of his calling we're too
[48:37] late in the game to be wondering what
[48:39] God has amen for the church what God has
[48:42] for this bride amen we're too too late
[48:45] in the game to be playing games and and
[48:48] and and all of these things amen but you
[48:52] see the entire Church of the Living God
[48:55] not in entire fake Tabernacle not in
[48:58] time entire evening like Tabernacle but
[49:00] the entire Church of the Living God is
[49:05] built upon the revelation of Jesus
[49:07] Christ ain't that right for we know that
[49:10] all the word for our day must be
[49:13] fulfilled we know that it's it's not
[49:16] guesswork we know amen that this word is
[49:20] going to be fulfilled in our day but
[49:22] what's the most beautiful thing is is we
[49:25] have an understanding that we're part of
[49:27] this age amen and we're part amen of the
[49:31] word for this hour amen just as Jesus
[49:34] knew the word he knew what was to be
[49:37] fulfilled in his day he ain't that right
[49:40] amen that's why he didn't go and stagger
[49:42] over you know uh uh to the the Pharisee
[49:45] trying to get his purpose amen from the
[49:48] Pharisee amen the father had showed him
[49:51] amen it was revealed to him in the Bible
[49:54] ain't that right amen see the Pharisee
[49:57] didn't understand his uh Jesus's purpose
[50:00] and and many mom the multitude didn't
[50:03] understand the purpose that Jesus had
[50:06] but it was divinely revealed to him of
[50:09] what his life was to fulfill and so do
[50:13] we know what is to be fulfilled in our
[50:16] day that's why we're not listening to uh
[50:18] to the traditions of man we're not
[50:20] listening to the doctors and of divinity
[50:23] that's why we don't we're not finding
[50:25] our purpose in the colleges and
[50:27] seminaries and the theologians and all
[50:30] the books that they're writing that's
[50:32] that we're not finding our purpose in
[50:35] there can you say man amen and Jesus
[50:38] knew I I thought of that he so knew how
[50:42] that that his purpose for the day that
[50:45] he knew how to place the scriptures now
[50:48] notice Isaiah 61 speaks of Christ the
[50:52] spirit of the Lord is upon me because
[50:54] the Lord has just anointed me to preach
[50:57] the Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[51:00] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[51:02] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[51:05] opening of the prison to them that are
[51:08] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[51:11] the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our
[51:14] God to comfort all that mourn so this
[51:18] scripture this this passage of scripture
[51:20] speaks of Christ ain't that right but
[51:23] notice when Jesus quotes this scripture
[51:26] there I believe it's in Luke amen he
[51:29] stops he say he he pre he says to
[51:32] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[51:34] and then he stops he did not go any
[51:38] further a man because he understood a
[51:42] man that the rest of that scripture did
[51:44] not apply to him at that time ain't that
[51:48] right amen so here was a prophecy a man
[51:51] here was a scripture that was speaking
[51:54] of two events it was speaking of the
[51:56] same person Christ but it was speaking
[51:59] of two events but God or Jesus and
[52:02] knowing their wisdom and understanding
[52:06] amen how to place the scriptures ain't
[52:09] that right a man see so uh because when
[52:12] he come the day of Vengeance wasn't for
[52:15] that day the prophet said that's for his
[52:17] second coming ain't that right so here
[52:20] Jesus I could stop and and place the
[52:23] scriptures exactly where they belong a
[52:27] man and and so he knew what scriptures
[52:30] to apply for his date and he knew what
[52:33] scriptures to apply for another time a
[52:36] man see and so we we find uh how could
[52:40] he do this it's because they're Isaiah
[52:43] prophesied in Isaiah 11 and 2 saying the
[52:47] spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him
[52:49] speaking of Christ a man and the spirit
[52:52] of wisdom and understanding the Spirit
[52:56] of counsel and might the spirit of
[52:59] knowledge and of the fear of the Lord
[53:02] and shall make him of quick
[53:05] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[53:07] ain't that right so when Jesus come he
[53:11] had wisdom he had understanding he had
[53:14] that that ability you see that anointing
[53:17] but look at Ephesians there in in one in
[53:22] 16 Paul wrote saying about the church he
[53:25] says I ceased not to give thanks for you
[53:28] making mention of you in my prayer that
[53:31] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[53:34] father of Glory may give unto you the
[53:37] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[53:41] knowledge of him ain't that right amen
[53:43] so so the Same Spirit of wisdom The Same
[53:46] Spirit of Revelation and understanding
[53:49] that was upon Christ is upon the church
[53:52] today
[53:53] amancy and and and and to give us he
[53:57] says see that the spirit of wisdom and
[54:00] Revelation in the knowledge of him and
[54:02] he is the word ain't they right amen so
[54:06] so there is a people that could look at
[54:08] that word today amen and place the
[54:11] scriptures exactly where it belongs amen
[54:15] that's right Amen to think of it that we
[54:17] used to be confused we didn't understand
[54:19] where to place the scriptures amen and
[54:22] no wonder the devil could work on us and
[54:24] beat us up and and and and have us
[54:27] convinced that we're going in a
[54:28] tribulation and have us Convent amen
[54:31] that we could actually cross the line of
[54:33] uh to where uh commit the unpardonable
[54:35] sin but through the wisdom and
[54:37] revelation of understanding the word of
[54:41] God for this day we realize that a
[54:43] Believer cannot cross that line uh a
[54:46] Believer will never go into the
[54:48] tribulation a Believer amen will never
[54:51] amen see uh so but but we're
[54:54] understanding that the scriptures there
[54:58] are scriptures that belong to us that
[55:01] must be fulfilled can you say Amen could
[55:04] you imagine how can you have rapturing
[55:06] faith if you don't know if you're really
[55:08] going in a Rapture amen if the scripture
[55:10] ain't made known to you amen and you
[55:13] don't know you read about the Rapture
[55:15] you read about the tribulation you read
[55:18] about Hell Fire and Damnation you read
[55:20] about heaven you read about the white
[55:22] Throne judgment and if there's no quick
[55:24] understanding and Revelation in you amen
[55:28] how can you build faith upon if you
[55:30] don't know what's what can you say amen
[55:33] and Satan was good at working on our
[55:35] feelings when you don't feeling them
[55:37] scriptures of of damnation come alive to
[55:40] us when you're on the real on the
[55:42] Mountaintop and in Revival then these
[55:44] scriptures of Heaven Come Alive to us
[55:46] and it's just a topsy-turvy amen but
[55:49] this bride today has got a quick
[55:51] understanding the spirit of Revelation
[55:54] and the spirit of wisdom and
[55:57] understanding is upon her now in
[56:00] Proverbs 2 and 10 when wisdom entereth
[56:03] into thine heart and knowledge is
[56:06] Pleasant unto thy Soul discretion shall
[56:09] preserve thee ain't that right now
[56:12] that's what that's what we need ain't
[56:14] that right
[56:15] understanding shall keep thee amen think
[56:18] of that now amen see when you're in the
[56:20] trials and when you're going through
[56:22] things and and and your your flesh is
[56:25] and your feelings and your senses are
[56:28] backsliding on your hand and and and and
[56:31] and you once felt God now you don't feel
[56:33] him he's on the Mountaintop now you
[56:35] don't know where you felt is love now
[56:37] you don't know and all of these things
[56:39] it's just topsy-turvy topsy-turvy that
[56:43] notice when wisdom enters into thine
[56:46] heart and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy
[56:49] Soul discretion shall preserve thee can
[56:52] you say man whether you're on the
[56:54] Mountaintop or whether you're not
[56:55] discretion shall preserve thee and
[56:58] knowledge or under standing shall keep
[57:01] thee ain't that right so this is why
[57:03] Jesus when he didn't always feel I don't
[57:06] believe he always felt God I don't
[57:08] believe that he always felt like he was
[57:10] uh uh uh called I mean because he was he
[57:13] was tempted just like all of us he went
[57:16] through the trials just like you and I
[57:17] he knows what a preacher feels like he
[57:19] knows what a daddy feels like he knows
[57:21] what a mama feels like he he knows amen
[57:24] what the laity feels like he knows what
[57:27] the weakest Christian feels like amen
[57:30] there he was he had his headaches he had
[57:32] his trials he had his Temptations He had
[57:35] all of that ain't that right that one
[57:38] thing that never left him is he knew who
[57:40] he was he knew that he was to fulfill
[57:43] the word amen even in golgoth or at at
[57:46] the Garden of Gethsemane he would say
[57:49] father if it be thy will let this cup
[57:52] pass for me he didn't want to go that
[57:54] way the flesh was crying out amen but he
[57:57] knew enough to know that nevertheless
[58:00] thy will be done he knew he was called
[58:03] for it amen now you think of it the
[58:06] scriptures are like a jigsaw puzzle a
[58:09] man and if a man doesn't uh uh get the
[58:13] the the the pieces placed in the right
[58:15] position see then he will get the scene
[58:18] all mixed up ain't that right brother
[58:22] Brown says what if you had a picture of
[58:24] a great beautiful countryside and a cow
[58:27] picking grass up in the top of the tree
[58:29] he's now see that wouldn't be right
[58:32] would it because she don't pick grass in
[58:35] the top of a tree well he says in
[58:38] another place the holy spirit is the
[58:40] only one who can reveal reveal it ain't
[58:43] that right amen see we're talking about
[58:45] the paths of righteousness now the Holy
[58:48] Ghost is the only one that can reveal it
[58:50] to us for it is hid from the eyes of the
[58:53] wise and prudent it's revealed to babes
[58:56] such as with learn so if you don't watch
[58:58] you you don't if you don't use the mind
[59:01] of the Holy Spirit to put it together
[59:03] you'll have your scene all mixed up can
[59:07] you say man you'll have the bride going
[59:09] into tribulation instead of uh on a
[59:12] Rapture you you'll just have everything
[59:14] just topsy-turvy it'll all just be
[59:17] messed up ain't that right amen so thank
[59:19] God Amen that that we have the spirit of
[59:23] wisdom and Revelation amen see we got to
[59:26] know what Paths of righteousness a man
[59:28] that is leading us on amen that's right
[59:31] see and so Jesus was the word made flesh
[59:35] so he he was anointed a man to make the
[59:40] scriptures come together so to make the
[59:43] picture come out right ain't that right
[59:45] amen he was anointed a man to fulfill
[59:49] every scripture pertaining him and he
[59:52] made the picture turn out right amen see
[59:56] and so it is it today the Bride is a
[59:59] word word bride do you believe that amen
[1:00:02] see Jesus think of it now he knew he was
[1:00:04] amen now the priest they just kept on
[1:00:07] offering sacrifices like normal but
[1:00:10] Jesus didn't go that way did he because
[1:00:12] he knew he was the lamb he knew that he
[1:00:16] had a scripture to fulfill amen that's
[1:00:19] right see so he didn't get it mixed up
[1:00:21] he didn't get everything all just uh uh
[1:00:24] uh uh uh confused there and so you being
[1:00:28] a word bride you are anointed for this
[1:00:31] age to fulfill every scripture to make
[1:00:35] the picture turn out right can you say
[1:00:38] amen amen you know that this is the
[1:00:41] church has had the cow eaten on the top
[1:00:43] of the tree too long amen that the
[1:00:46] church amen is has got everything
[1:00:48] confused amen for too long but there is
[1:00:51] a bride that is not confused she's not
[1:00:54] confused in this age for she knows she's
[1:00:58] been given the spirit of Revelation and
[1:01:01] of understanding so so as Jesus
[1:01:05] fulfilled his part of the word so you're
[1:01:07] here to fulfill your part of the word in
[1:01:10] this age ain't that right now notice the
[1:01:14] word being fulfilled Abel we talked
[1:01:16] about I believe last uh a couple weeks
[1:01:19] ago but uh uh Abel fulfilled the word
[1:01:22] that was revealed to him and and showing
[1:01:26] that he was righteous Noah fulfilled the
[1:01:30] word that was revealed to him showing
[1:01:33] that he was righteous Abraham fulfilled
[1:01:36] the word that was revealed to him
[1:01:38] showing that he was righteous a man all
[1:01:41] the way down they they fulfilled the
[1:01:44] word that was revealed to them ain't
[1:01:46] that right but then in Jesus's day all
[1:01:50] the word that had been revealed to the
[1:01:52] prophets a man had spoke of him here he
[1:01:57] come fulfilling it all ain't that right
[1:01:59] amen he fulfilled it all amen that's
[1:02:02] right see amen see so it it showed see
[1:02:06] what had been revealed to Abel what had
[1:02:09] been revealed to Ezekiel a man what had
[1:02:12] been revealed to Isaiah what had been
[1:02:15] revealed to Moses to David to Noah to to
[1:02:18] all the prophets amen Jesus came to full
[1:02:22] feel because he was the Revelation a man
[1:02:28] that came to them ain't that right he
[1:02:31] was the Revelation no or Abel he he had
[1:02:35] the Revelation that it was a lamb amen
[1:02:38] but what it was that lamb was speaking
[1:02:40] of Jesus Christ and so when Jesus come
[1:02:43] he fulfilled amen what Abel had Saul
[1:02:47] amen see so he was the Revelation in the
[1:02:50] lamb he was the Revelation in the
[1:02:52] building of the Ark he was the
[1:02:54] Revelation in the in The Mercy Seat he
[1:02:57] was the Revelation in the high priest he
[1:02:59] was the Revelation in the altar he was
[1:03:01] the Revelation in the moment he was the
[1:03:04] Revelation in the in the Passover he was
[1:03:07] the Revelation in it of it all ain't
[1:03:09] that right amen and here he comes to
[1:03:12] fulfill all righteousness oh there was a
[1:03:15] lot for him to fulfill
[1:03:17] ah my he he there and he did not skip
[1:03:21] one of them he fulfilled everyone to the
[1:03:24] letter ain't that right amen but to
[1:03:26] think of that it didn't just speak of
[1:03:28] his day this Bible speaks of us as well
[1:03:32] do you believe that now a man sees so so
[1:03:35] Jesus was the Revelation in Isaac being
[1:03:38] offered up amen he was the Revelation in
[1:03:41] David being rejected as as king and
[1:03:45] coming back into Power he was the
[1:03:47] Revelation in Joseph's life he was the
[1:03:50] Revelation in boaz's life he was the he
[1:03:53] was the Revelation amen and sold the
[1:03:56] time now had come for the Revelation to
[1:03:59] be made manifest and fulfilled ain't
[1:04:02] that right hey man all that they lived
[1:04:04] out in in their lives amen they were
[1:04:07] speaking of one to come amen and here he
[1:04:10] was now amen not talking of something to
[1:04:12] come but he was saying I am the one I am
[1:04:15] the one Abraham saw my day and rejoice I
[1:04:18] am he ain't that right everything down
[1:04:20] amen they saw him he was the will in the
[1:04:23] middle of the wheel
[1:04:25] that Ezekiel Saul ain't that right amen
[1:04:29] that's right see so he knew Jesus knew
[1:04:32] that he was the Revelation amen that
[1:04:36] they of of what they had amen Saul he
[1:04:40] knew that every type and Shadow amen uh
[1:04:43] uh of Messiah of the Lamb of the altar
[1:04:46] all these things spoke of him he knew
[1:04:49] that and so he was there to fulfill all
[1:04:52] righteousness think of that now how
[1:04:54] perfect a word was the Revelation that
[1:04:57] came to the prophets was so perfect amen
[1:05:00] and yet a man would come and so perfect
[1:05:03] was his life amen that he fulfilled
[1:05:05] every one of them
[1:05:07] hey man that's awesome ain't that right
[1:05:09] what was it no man could do that it was
[1:05:12] God in Christ a man that was living the
[1:05:14] word out amen and so is it today there
[1:05:17] cannot be one scripture that pertains
[1:05:20] this bride go undone it cannot be messed
[1:05:23] up and it won't be messed up can you say
[1:05:25] amen for the same God that was in Christ
[1:05:28] is in this bride amen how is it going to
[1:05:31] do it I don't know but this word will be
[1:05:35] fulfilled in human flesh
[1:05:38] it will be
[1:05:41] now
[1:05:43] the prophet said when with Jesus when he
[1:05:45] came he said he'd come to fulfill the
[1:05:47] word of God what the prophets had said
[1:05:49] he come to fulfill the prophecy of the
[1:05:52] Old Testament now
[1:05:55] the holy spirit is here
[1:05:57] to fulfill the prophecy of the New
[1:05:59] Testament ain't that right amen think of
[1:06:02] that now amen now now this is why you
[1:06:06] are the Revival
[1:06:08] if you're part of the Bride you're
[1:06:10] you're of the Revival you're the thing
[1:06:12] that's going on
[1:06:13] can you say man no one can take your
[1:06:15] place amen I don't care how low you feel
[1:06:18] how insignificant you feel amen uh if
[1:06:21] you're part of this bride you're here to
[1:06:23] fulfill it and you will fulfill it amen
[1:06:26] you're not too insignificant for God
[1:06:29] ain't that right yes sir amen so John 14
[1:06:33] and 16. Jesus says that I will pray the
[1:06:36] father and he shall give you another
[1:06:38] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:06:41] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:06:43] the world cannot receive because it
[1:06:45] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[1:06:48] you know him for he dwells with you and
[1:06:53] shall be in you I will not leave you
[1:06:56] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:06:58] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:07:00] more but you see me because I live you
[1:07:04] shall live all soul and at that day and
[1:07:07] we always say it but the prophets had
[1:07:08] put it to our day this day ain't that
[1:07:11] right aren't you glad that we can place
[1:07:12] that word now amen not for some far off
[1:07:15] not some past event but it's for this
[1:07:18] day right now thank God for Spirit of
[1:07:21] wisdom and Revelation amen at that day
[1:07:24] you shall know that I am in my father
[1:07:27] you in me and I in you my you know the
[1:07:32] prophet talking about people prostrating
[1:07:34] themselves before Idols they prostrate
[1:07:37] themselves before a god of stone marble
[1:07:41] wood or whatever it would be and and
[1:07:44] they they do that because they believe
[1:07:46] that God is in there and and and and and
[1:07:50] in that in that title but the prophet
[1:07:52] says and we all know it by experience
[1:07:54] that God is not an idol he is a spirit
[1:07:57] and the spirit don't come into some Idol
[1:08:00] as some so-called Christians would have
[1:08:02] us to believe but the spirit comes into
[1:08:05] you you are God's house living walking
[1:08:09] around manifesting the Living God for
[1:08:12] God dwells not in temples made with
[1:08:14] hands but a body hast thou prepared me
[1:08:18] ain't that right you are God's letter
[1:08:23] you are God's letter think of that all
[1:08:25] the prophecies that was written in the
[1:08:28] Scrolls Jesus now become that Living
[1:08:31] Word
[1:08:32] ain't that right now he's looking at you
[1:08:34] and saying you are God's letter
[1:08:37] God's letter see oh my God's not needing
[1:08:40] to write a new Bible he has taken his
[1:08:42] spirit amen and coming into you and
[1:08:45] making this word amen live through your
[1:08:47] flesh
[1:08:48] see God is in you see you're a written
[1:08:51] epistle God is in you manifesting
[1:08:54] himself through if you could prostrate
[1:08:56] yourself before God and say God I'm a
[1:08:58] sinner come into me and then the Holy
[1:09:01] Spirit comes in then you're a living
[1:09:03] Idol of God living representative of God
[1:09:07] walking around with God speaking through
[1:09:10] your lips to others think of it your
[1:09:12] hands are his hands your feet are his
[1:09:15] feet your eyes your ears are his eyes
[1:09:18] and ears amen everything see God long
[1:09:22] for amen Christ fulfilled it amen
[1:09:26] through his Redemptive work amen to show
[1:09:29] that he was that true sacrificial lamb
[1:09:32] now God has that that made a way for God
[1:09:35] to come into you and I as mortal beings
[1:09:38] and fulfill an eternal perfect Divine
[1:09:41] word amen through our mortal bodies
[1:09:44] First Corinthians 6 19 what Paul says no
[1:09:48] you not that your body is the Temple of
[1:09:51] the Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[1:09:54] have of God and you are not your own for
[1:09:58] you are bought with the price therefore
[1:10:01] glorify God you'll either glorify God or
[1:10:05] you'll glorify the devil amen that's
[1:10:07] exactly right you'll be a slave to the
[1:10:09] enemy to the devil or you're going to be
[1:10:11] a slave to God you'll be a prisoner to
[1:10:14] hold a negative and everything that the
[1:10:17] world has or you'll be a prisoner to God
[1:10:19] in his word and his promises that he
[1:10:22] says therefore glorify God in your body
[1:10:25] and in your spirit which are gods ain't
[1:10:29] that right but notice the world knoweth
[1:10:32] him not they don't see him they don't
[1:10:35] understand him they don't know the
[1:10:37] purpose that God has a man for them as
[1:10:40] far as they're concerned God is just a
[1:10:42] god of History amen he's not moving
[1:10:45] anymore he's not you know and so they
[1:10:48] have presented to the people a god of
[1:10:50] yesterday because they don't know him of
[1:10:53] today can you say amen and and they're
[1:10:56] looking they are now they're looking for
[1:10:59] a messiah they're they're looking for
[1:11:01] the promised one as the Jews did back
[1:11:04] then but what are they doing they're
[1:11:06] looking for him not in the word but in
[1:11:09] their Creeds and their traditions and
[1:11:11] their interpretations and their own
[1:11:13] understanding can you say Amen but when
[1:11:16] Jesus come that day it was just like it
[1:11:18] is today but he didn't come to fulfill
[1:11:21] their Creeds he didn't come to fulfill
[1:11:24] their traditions and their ideology he
[1:11:27] come to fulfill all righteousness which
[1:11:30] is the word of God
[1:11:33] can you say Amen now look in Romans 10
[1:11:37] and 1 Paul wrote of Israel saying
[1:11:40] Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[1:11:43] God for Israel is that they might be
[1:11:44] saved for I bear them record that they
[1:11:47] have a Zeal of God but not according to
[1:11:50] knowledge
[1:11:51] now now that that's the same picture
[1:11:53] that the Gentile church is today the
[1:11:56] carnal Church the natural churches they
[1:11:58] have a Zeal for God Amen but not
[1:12:01] according to knowledge a man that got a
[1:12:04] zealed to save Souls but they passing
[1:12:06] out the donuts and and they're sending
[1:12:08] their preachers to to the seminaries and
[1:12:11] to get better educated and and and they
[1:12:15] they they've got to uh go to win souls
[1:12:17] and to fill the church up amen but
[1:12:19] they're leaning to psychology and
[1:12:21] they're leaning to technology and
[1:12:23] they're leaning to personality and all
[1:12:26] of these things amen see they have a
[1:12:28] Zeal of God but not according to
[1:12:31] knowledge for they being ignorant of
[1:12:33] God's righteousness see going about to
[1:12:37] establish their own righteousness have
[1:12:39] not submitted themselves unto the
[1:12:42] righteousness of God ain't that right so
[1:12:45] again they are ignorant a man of God's
[1:12:48] righteousness and hath not submitted to
[1:12:51] the the the righteousness of God now I
[1:12:54] you look up that word ignorant it means
[1:12:57] without understanding to to not know to
[1:13:00] not perceive or understand see that so
[1:13:04] so they've got a Zeal of God but they
[1:13:07] don't know how to fulfill it they they
[1:13:09] don't know the right path they don't
[1:13:11] know what God really expects of them can
[1:13:14] you say Amen well the prophet talked
[1:13:16] about it you know they're their their
[1:13:18] goal was back then a million more and 44
[1:13:21] and I think that was the Baptist slogan
[1:13:23] and Pentecostals got their own slogan
[1:13:25] and this slogan and that slogan Azeal a
[1:13:28] man but not for but but ignorant of the
[1:13:32] righteousness of God see so the
[1:13:35] righteousness of God is not known to
[1:13:37] them so therefore they are without
[1:13:41] understanding now Jesus said except a
[1:13:44] man be born again he cannot see or
[1:13:48] understand the kingdom of God ain't that
[1:13:51] right amen now we're still talking about
[1:13:53] the paths of righteousness now he
[1:13:56] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:13:58] see we're we're not following our own
[1:14:00] way we're not stumbling in the dark
[1:14:03] we're we're we're we're we're not
[1:14:05] groping and trying and and all of these
[1:14:08] things ain't that right there is an
[1:14:10] understanding to the word of God Amen
[1:14:13] that the the bride that did not say it
[1:14:17] the bride does have a man it's here the
[1:14:20] understanding the spirit of Revelation
[1:14:22] the spirit of understanding is here can
[1:14:25] you say Amen it's here and so a man that
[1:14:29] walks blind blindly in the world today
[1:14:31] he does it well brother Brown said
[1:14:33] they're willfully ignorant that that
[1:14:35] that's just all you can say God has
[1:14:37] showed himself in such a way in this
[1:14:41] hour ain't that right now remember if if
[1:14:44] you look at it it took a prophet to
[1:14:47] introduce Christ to the world John the
[1:14:50] Baptist was that Prophet that may the
[1:14:52] introduction and he presented the church
[1:14:55] to Christ
[1:14:56] amen and and and he took a prophet and
[1:15:00] it took John a man to reveal Christ uh
[1:15:03] uh to to present Christ to the world it
[1:15:06] it just had that's just God's way amen
[1:15:09] see and and and a lot of people didn't
[1:15:11] understand it but nevertheless it was
[1:15:14] God's way but just as John was
[1:15:17] introduced the Messiah of the first
[1:15:21] coming of the Messiah so is it a man
[1:15:24] that that there there has been a prophet
[1:15:28] to introduce Christ again to this age
[1:15:31] ain't that right there has been we're
[1:15:33] not looking uh uh uh uh we're not
[1:15:37] looking for something uh uh but but we
[1:15:40] we're looking at it we we know that that
[1:15:43] God has sent a prophet in this age and
[1:15:46] what his ministry was Amen brother Brown
[1:15:49] said as John was sent to wind up the Old
[1:15:51] Testament and to bring forth the
[1:15:53] introduction of Christ a message will
[1:15:56] wind up the Loose Ends and will
[1:15:58] introduce the Messiah just before his
[1:16:01] coming the message of the last days
[1:16:04] ain't that right now I know people say
[1:16:07] well you know we need to get people to
[1:16:09] Christ price Christ if you don't see
[1:16:11] Christ in the message you're missing it
[1:16:13] amen for that's what the message was is
[1:16:16] to introduce Christ amen it was a
[1:16:19] personal and and and brother Branham uh
[1:16:22] understood that that he was to introduce
[1:16:25] Christ to the world today he realized
[1:16:29] that his message amen was was just as
[1:16:32] important as John the Baptist was back
[1:16:35] then and and and not only does brother
[1:16:37] Branham understand that we understand
[1:16:39] that or at least I hope you do amen now
[1:16:42] brother Brown said the Holy Spirit has
[1:16:44] been bound by these denominational
[1:16:46] Rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to
[1:16:49] be loosed in the evening time amen by
[1:16:53] the evening time message the Holy Spirit
[1:16:56] back in the church again ain't that
[1:17:00] right twice himself
[1:17:02] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[1:17:05] time amen another place he says the
[1:17:09] seventh seal brings him back to Earth
[1:17:13] again ain't that right amen now this is
[1:17:16] important because we find that when we
[1:17:19] see him amen what was he revealed as
[1:17:22] amen the son of man amen that's what
[1:17:25] Luke 17 30 told us that he when we see
[1:17:28] him he would be revealed as the son of
[1:17:31] man a man and he comes why does he come
[1:17:35] he comes to claim what he has redeemed
[1:17:40] aren't you glad for that he comes to
[1:17:43] receive what he has redeemed and we know
[1:17:46] what redeemed means it means to bring
[1:17:48] back to its original condition bring
[1:17:51] back amen what is it back to the word
[1:17:54] back to the original thoughts of God
[1:17:57] back to being the attribute of God back
[1:18:00] to the power of God back to being the
[1:18:03] manifestation of the sons of God that
[1:18:06] shouted and rejoiced before the
[1:18:07] foundation of the world can you say amen
[1:18:10] amen that's what he's come to do to
[1:18:12] redeem us back amen and oh I hope we get
[1:18:16] this really down into our soul a man of
[1:18:19] what this message is all about is to
[1:18:21] take us back to the word ain't that
[1:18:24] right you hear Brother Branham crying
[1:18:26] out back to the word back to the word
[1:18:28] back to the word what was he saying amen
[1:18:31] go back to the very Mind Of God Amen the
[1:18:34] way God thought of you before the
[1:18:36] foundation of the world Amen that's what
[1:18:38] he's come to redeem we were slave to the
[1:18:41] enemy we were slaved Amen to whatever
[1:18:44] trapped in sin trapped in denomination
[1:18:47] trapped in everything else amen but in
[1:18:50] this day it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:18:53] righteousness can you say amen amen not
[1:18:56] the order of the church not the not not
[1:18:58] not the order of some Bishop not some
[1:19:01] order of whatever but to come back and
[1:19:04] fulfill all righteousness well we didn't
[1:19:07] know what was in the was in the word the
[1:19:09] word was closed up to us amen we didn't
[1:19:12] understand what it was but it's in this
[1:19:15] day under that third pool Ministry that
[1:19:17] the word has been opened up to us and we
[1:19:20] begin to understand what the paths of
[1:19:23] righteousness really is it didn't have a
[1:19:26] beginning in a church our origin is in
[1:19:28] the mind of God can you say Amen your
[1:19:32] life ain't amen didn't start with God
[1:19:35] Amen at an altar you was always with God
[1:19:38] the prophet said you wasn't saved on any
[1:19:40] a given day you was always saved get
[1:19:44] back to that word get back not living
[1:19:46] not we're not trying to serve God as
[1:19:49] some slaves and and vagabonds and and
[1:19:52] all that there's been a Redemptive price
[1:19:54] made for us
[1:19:56] can you say amen amen we come into this
[1:19:59] world not even recognizing not even
[1:20:01] acting like sons of God we were acting
[1:20:04] like sons of the devil you understand
[1:20:06] what I'm saying we were Liars drunks and
[1:20:09] miserable creatures and all of these
[1:20:11] things having a carnal nature that was
[1:20:13] enmity against God but think of what
[1:20:16] David said he restoreth my soul
[1:20:18] he restores my soul he gave the
[1:20:22] something back to me amen where the
[1:20:24] devil can no longer claim me the devil
[1:20:27] can no longer boss me around and Lead me
[1:20:29] around God come to redeem my soul and he
[1:20:33] said he is South he is thrown in the
[1:20:35] soul of my heart
[1:20:37] can you say Amen why he gonna lead us in
[1:20:40] the paths of righteousness he's going to
[1:20:42] lead us back to where he re where we
[1:20:44] came from the uh uh in the first place
[1:20:47] back to where we fell from ain't that
[1:20:50] right so it took now it took now he's
[1:20:54] not in that now now you you all know
[1:20:56] that that the Bible never says that
[1:20:58] Jesus will come to the Earth amen and
[1:21:01] and put his feet upon the Earth Amen in
[1:21:04] a physical body
[1:21:05] before the rapture
[1:21:07] right see we're not off the wall
[1:21:11] we know what we're talking about and
[1:21:12] this is what brother Branham said
[1:21:14] so when he says he's coming back to
[1:21:16] bring him back to Earth amen now we know
[1:21:19] that the the seventh seal has a has a
[1:21:21] threefold purpose and and that seven
[1:21:23] seal involves the Millennium and it
[1:21:26] involves the new new Earth and it
[1:21:28] involves all that but I'm talking about
[1:21:30] right now amen that it brings Christ
[1:21:32] back to Earth again amen and where is it
[1:21:36] in a church in a in your body brother
[1:21:38] Bill in your body Faith that's in your
[1:21:41] body it brought Christ back into the
[1:21:44] church again Amen to fulfill amen the
[1:21:47] rest of his ministry
[1:21:52] he leads us in the paths of
[1:21:54] righteousness
[1:21:55] now notice as the first Forerunner came
[1:21:58] from the Wilderness and cried the Holy
[1:21:59] Lamb of God the second Forerunner will
[1:22:03] probably do the same by pointing the
[1:22:05] people to a word born bride
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:09] where's Christ
[1:22:11] in a word born bride
[1:22:15] where's messiah in a word born bride
[1:22:19] ain't that right
[1:22:20] go go go listen to the message brother
[1:22:23] Brandon preaching on Messiahs
[1:22:25] you're that anointed one
[1:22:27] The Works that I do shall you do even
[1:22:29] greater than thee shall you do
[1:22:31] ain't that right as the father has sent
[1:22:34] me so send I you brother Brown said how
[1:22:36] did the father send him he went with him
[1:22:40] that's right see so he sent us a man
[1:22:43] into this Earth by being in us a man see
[1:22:46] so he says now the second Forerunner
[1:22:49] will probably do the same thing and do
[1:22:51] the same by pointing the people to a
[1:22:53] word born bride the bride of Christ will
[1:22:55] be pointed to the skies at the peering
[1:22:57] of Jesus scream and Behold the Lamb of
[1:23:00] God will come forth from his lips ain't
[1:23:03] that riding so now how will the people
[1:23:06] know how will the people that's
[1:23:08] believing him know that it's the Messiah
[1:23:11] the prophet said unless they are
[1:23:13] constantly in the word to know what he
[1:23:16] is ain't that right amen we're not got
[1:23:20] our nose in the Creeds we're not God our
[1:23:22] knowledge all mixed up in all these uh
[1:23:24] the the the the the traditions of men
[1:23:27] and and all the Babbling and the
[1:23:29] backblatting and the fussing and the
[1:23:30] griping and all of that you'll never
[1:23:33] know him by that way you got to know him
[1:23:35] by having your your your your your your
[1:23:37] eyes upon the word of God Amen
[1:23:40] constantly in the word to know what he
[1:23:43] is amen and notice Daniel 11 and 2 32 it
[1:23:47] break it in it says the people that do
[1:23:49] know their God shall be strong and do
[1:23:54] exploits or great exploits who is it
[1:23:57] who's gonna do that the people that know
[1:24:00] their God and how will they know him
[1:24:03] except they're constantly in the word to
[1:24:06] know what he is ain't that right amen
[1:24:10] and how will they know him when they
[1:24:12] can't accept the prophet of this age
[1:24:14] they can't accept his ministry so how
[1:24:17] are they going to know him but there's a
[1:24:19] people that do know him and that have
[1:24:21] the understanding
[1:24:23] Daniel 12 and 10 breaking in none of the
[1:24:27] wicked shall understand but the wise
[1:24:29] shall understand ain't that right
[1:24:32] now I'm not going to keep you much
[1:24:33] longer but he says now how how shall he
[1:24:36] appear in these last days is to bring
[1:24:38] the people back to the word
[1:24:41] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:24:43] know her mate the revealed word
[1:24:47] ain't that right remember when he come
[1:24:50] to the Earth he said my meat is to do
[1:24:51] the will of the father
[1:24:53] the will of him that sent me and so is
[1:24:56] the is the heart of the Bride to do the
[1:24:59] will of him that sent sent her amen why
[1:25:03] she's flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:25:05] bone so that there there is more
[1:25:07] relation between the the the the people
[1:25:10] of God the elect of God and and God in
[1:25:15] Christ than there is of just Flesh and
[1:25:17] Blood there's more relation can you say
[1:25:20] man you've got a greater relation a a
[1:25:23] greater lineage with Christ amen than
[1:25:26] you do which is just natural a family
[1:25:28] that's right see and so he appear in
[1:25:31] this last day to bring the people back
[1:25:34] to the word so that the bride will know
[1:25:36] her husband know her mate the revealed
[1:25:38] word that's why this has to happen
[1:25:42] ain't that right that's why this message
[1:25:45] had to be
[1:25:47] so that we would know who he is
[1:25:50] amen see it wasn't in the reformers was
[1:25:53] it in Luther Wesley in the Pentecostals
[1:25:55] and then scribcy and then the scripture
[1:25:58] says it wasn't but it will come and come
[1:26:00] that that is his promise for this age
[1:26:03] we're living in the age that his coming
[1:26:05] will be in she the bride must be
[1:26:09] identified in him any woman must be
[1:26:12] identified with her husband for the two
[1:26:15] are one and Christ's bride has to be
[1:26:18] identified with him for the two are one
[1:26:23] he is the word can you say that now he
[1:26:26] is the word not a denomination he is the
[1:26:30] word and we are to be the children of
[1:26:33] light and the light is the word which is
[1:26:36] made light for this age how do we know
[1:26:39] light except it comes from the word of
[1:26:42] God can you say man so we're not
[1:26:45] following traditions and saying we're
[1:26:46] walking in the paths of righteousness
[1:26:48] because there is no path that there is
[1:26:51] no righteousness in Traditions amen
[1:26:53] there is no righteousness increase there
[1:26:55] is no no righteousness in theology amen
[1:26:59] but we know that we're walking in the
[1:27:01] paths of righteousness because we see
[1:27:04] him as being the word can you say amen
[1:27:06] that's right the word made flesh is the
[1:27:09] light of the age he says when you see it
[1:27:12] and the Bible said so
[1:27:15] Hallelujah
[1:27:16] so he the spirit of Truth has come
[1:27:20] has loosed the seals
[1:27:23] the spirit of Truth is going to lead you
[1:27:24] and guide you
[1:27:25] so he ain't gonna lead you to some
[1:27:28] you know some Daddy and if you're you're
[1:27:31] in a dead end you've LED yourself there
[1:27:34] and God
[1:27:36] amen God leads us right in the paths of
[1:27:38] righteousness
[1:27:40] ain't that right the spirit of Truth
[1:27:42] come he's loose the seals and and and
[1:27:45] the and has revealed the Mysteries to us
[1:27:48] that we may know him
[1:27:52] now notice what first John 5 20 it says
[1:27:55] we know that the Son of God has come and
[1:27:58] hath given us an understanding
[1:28:01] that we may know him
[1:28:03] amen the word
[1:28:05] we may know him I'm gonna put it this
[1:28:08] way the revealed word
[1:28:10] why why because that's where we're at
[1:28:13] today
[1:28:14] David had a portion of him through the
[1:28:16] revelation
[1:28:17] all the way down the prophets but then
[1:28:19] he became the word made flesh every
[1:28:23] prophecy that was spoke was made flesh
[1:28:25] right then and church we ain't got no
[1:28:27] more other age we are at the climax of
[1:28:30] this Gentile dispensation amen there is
[1:28:33] no other bride to come you're that bride
[1:28:35] there is no other woman to take on his
[1:28:38] name but you can you say amen amen
[1:28:41] everything that he has longed for in his
[1:28:43] heart from the foundation of the world
[1:28:45] this is it amen I know it doesn't look
[1:28:48] like much I understand that you may not
[1:28:50] feel like much but honey you are the you
[1:28:53] are the apple of his eye you you are you
[1:28:56] are everything that he died for you are
[1:28:58] everything that he lived for amen you
[1:29:00] are everything that he fulfilled amen
[1:29:03] the word for it's for you can you say
[1:29:05] man God came down and joined one with
[1:29:08] man to bring a Redemption that he could
[1:29:11] come into you and have Fellowship amen
[1:29:14] so here we are no even though you feel
[1:29:17] insignificant and even though you may be
[1:29:19] going to the greatest battles of your
[1:29:21] life and you don't feel like you're ever
[1:29:23] going to make it there is a word
[1:29:25] concerning you that must be fulfilled
[1:29:28] and he is going to fulfill it through
[1:29:31] you it's the same God it's the same
[1:29:34] Divine Purpose it's the Eternal purpose
[1:29:36] of God that cannot fail I don't care oh
[1:29:40] I hope you understand that your trial
[1:29:42] can annul it your doubt can't annull it
[1:29:44] your discouragement can and all it if
[1:29:46] God has ordained you for this age to
[1:29:49] fulfill the word you're going to fulfill
[1:29:51] it
[1:29:54] it becomes us
[1:29:57] so we're not just sitting around here
[1:29:58] twiddling our thumbs
[1:30:01] notice what he says we know that the Son
[1:30:05] of God has come and hath given us an
[1:30:07] understanding that we may know him
[1:30:10] that is true
[1:30:12] aren't you glad you're not you don't
[1:30:14] you're not sitting in a church that that
[1:30:16] you have just a figment of imagination
[1:30:20] of who he is
[1:30:21] think of that
[1:30:25] he's come and given us an understanding
[1:30:29] that we may know him that is true
[1:30:32] you believe he's true
[1:30:34] if you go read the church age book
[1:30:35] brother Brown talks about the true and
[1:30:37] the uh the realities
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:40] of God
[1:30:42] which is the true bread
[1:30:45] what they had back then
[1:30:47] partial did he call that partial
[1:30:51] partial realization
[1:30:53] all the Old Testament had partial
[1:30:55] realization
[1:30:56] why because they were speaking of
[1:30:59] something to come that natural lamb that
[1:31:02] Abel offered up was just partial
[1:31:03] realization but he was the true
[1:31:07] he Jesus said I'm the true bread what
[1:31:10] was he saying well there was the bread
[1:31:11] that come down from heaven and manna
[1:31:14] that was the partial realization but it
[1:31:16] was only talking of him and when he come
[1:31:19] he says I am that true bread so we could
[1:31:21] look at he was the true lamb he was the
[1:31:23] true bread he was the true high priest
[1:31:25] he was the true Mercy Seat he was the
[1:31:27] true altar everything was realized in
[1:31:30] him and so is it today we ain't got just
[1:31:34] partial we ain't serving God through a
[1:31:37] partial realization we are that
[1:31:39] realization
[1:31:41] we are the realization
[1:31:43] Ruth was the the partial realization we
[1:31:46] are that realization we are the true
[1:31:49] amen can you say Amen he's given us an
[1:31:53] understanding that we may know him
[1:31:58] that is true
[1:32:01] and we are in him
[1:32:04] that is true even in his son Jesus
[1:32:07] Christ and this is the true God and
[1:32:09] eternal life amen
[1:32:11] so he leadeth me
[1:32:13] in the paths of righteousness
[1:32:16] every person
[1:32:18] every person that is a part of this
[1:32:20] bride
[1:32:22] has this same testimony
[1:32:25] that God has led them to this message
[1:32:29] God has now you say well I was raised in
[1:32:32] it so I was always been no no that's not
[1:32:34] true
[1:32:35] how many people have been raised in this
[1:32:36] message and don't believe it
[1:32:39] or that just sit in a church and it just
[1:32:41] never Dawns on them the light bulb don't
[1:32:43] come on for them
[1:32:46] God has to lead you to this message
[1:32:49] whether you're born born in a message
[1:32:51] Church raised in a message church or
[1:32:53] just come off Skid Row God had to lead
[1:32:57] you to the message
[1:32:59] ain't that right
[1:33:01] and so we can say and and I can say I
[1:33:04] know you can I am what I am
[1:33:07] by the grace of God
[1:33:10] ain't that right
[1:33:11] and so in our natural birth we did not
[1:33:14] start out the way God intended us to be
[1:33:16] we were liars cheaters and had a carnal
[1:33:19] nature that defied the very word of God
[1:33:22] we all had dreams and Ambitions that
[1:33:25] came from the carnal nature
[1:33:27] and yet we may have even had a desire to
[1:33:30] serve God but it would come from a
[1:33:32] carnal nature a carnal mind
[1:33:35] hey like brother Brown said the nuns
[1:33:37] don't go to none read
[1:33:39] to be bad
[1:33:41] there's something in them wanting to be
[1:33:44] right but they're serving it they're
[1:33:46] doing it through carnal nature
[1:33:49] carnal understanding carnal things
[1:33:51] talking to an individual today and
[1:33:54] saying oh my says I've I've been
[1:33:57] everywhere and people just kind of kind
[1:33:59] of may be questioning
[1:34:01] me uh uh but said you know says I I went
[1:34:05] to a Baptist for a little bit I went to
[1:34:07] this denomination for a little bit and I
[1:34:09] gave my all for it you know I was
[1:34:11] teaching Sunday school I was this I was
[1:34:14] that I I was doing everything I got
[1:34:16] discontent with that so I went to this
[1:34:18] other denomination and I put them all
[1:34:20] into it and and I I I I left that one
[1:34:24] and something still and so I went
[1:34:26] somewhere else and put my all into it
[1:34:29] you know and then says I come to the
[1:34:31] message and I'm satisfied
[1:34:34] and and says you know it seemed like I
[1:34:37] was so Rocky and so unstable and that
[1:34:40] maybe people just saying well we'll just
[1:34:42] see how this goes you know and and but I
[1:34:45] was telling them you know but but the
[1:34:47] the the thing the difference is that you
[1:34:50] couldn't be satisfied in that because
[1:34:51] that was just that that was man-made
[1:34:54] that God was leading you
[1:34:57] and and we all can uh well most of us I
[1:35:00] guess all of us can can say that God's
[1:35:02] been leading us
[1:35:04] God God has led us to the message I come
[1:35:06] out of the Pentecostal uh uh uh back
[1:35:09] background and and all that and and and
[1:35:11] to think where I am today from what I
[1:35:15] used to be I have to say God led me
[1:35:18] you understand what I'm saying and and
[1:35:20] so why because we have a purpose and we
[1:35:23] couldn't find our purpose outside this
[1:35:25] message
[1:35:28] hello we couldn't find the purpose
[1:35:31] outside this message we didn't know that
[1:35:33] we were part of the body of Christ
[1:35:36] not not in the way no traditionally we
[1:35:39] could say that but not in the way that
[1:35:40] the Bible says it
[1:35:43] and you say man
[1:35:44] and and so therefore you know uh um
[1:35:47] we're here today A man walking in the
[1:35:51] paths of righteousness because he has
[1:35:53] led us and he is continuing to lead
[1:35:56] now now notice Proverbs 16 and 9 a man's
[1:36:00] heart deviseth his way but the Lord
[1:36:02] directeth his steps
[1:36:05] now have you have you been there and God
[1:36:07] God so arrested you God's got so
[1:36:10] apprehended us to where he could lead us
[1:36:14] in in this in the paths of righteousness
[1:36:17] that this isn't our determined will that
[1:36:19] we have nothing to do with it except
[1:36:21] yielding to him
[1:36:23] can you say man and and then even Paul
[1:36:26] said this he he declared himself to be
[1:36:28] the prisoner of Christ
[1:36:30] and is this not what we are
[1:36:33] prisoners of Christ because he's leading
[1:36:36] us contrary to our own will he's he's
[1:36:38] leading us contrary to our own ambitions
[1:36:42] he's actually changed his 360 degrees
[1:36:48] why because the Lord directeth his steps
[1:36:51] Psalms 37 23 the steps of a good man or
[1:36:54] a righteous man or ordered of the Lord
[1:36:57] and he delighteth in his way and and and
[1:37:00] I looked at that word ordered it means
[1:37:02] established
[1:37:04] so that the steps of righteous man are
[1:37:06] established
[1:37:08] by the Lord
[1:37:10] ain't that right
[1:37:11] now when were the steps of the righteous
[1:37:13] established
[1:37:15] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:19] look at this judge God said to Jeremiah
[1:37:22] and Jeremiah 1 5 before I formed thee in
[1:37:24] the belly I knew thee and before thou
[1:37:26] camest forth out of the womb I
[1:37:28] Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a
[1:37:31] prophet unto the Nations
[1:37:33] when did he do that before uh uh before
[1:37:37] uh Jeremiah was even formed in the womb
[1:37:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:44] so these paths that were walking has
[1:37:47] been ordained before the foundation of
[1:37:48] the world our steps are ordered by the
[1:37:50] Lord
[1:37:53] look at this Romans 8 30 it says Lord
[1:37:55] over whom he did predestinate them he
[1:37:57] also called whom he called them he also
[1:37:59] Justified whom he justified them he also
[1:38:01] glorified
[1:38:03] Ephesians 1 3 according as he hath
[1:38:05] chosen Us in him before the foundational
[1:38:07] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:38:09] Blame before him in love
[1:38:11] how in the world could we walk these
[1:38:13] paths without him leading us
[1:38:17] Jeremiah 10 23 says oh Lord I know the
[1:38:20] way of man
[1:38:22] is not in himself
[1:38:25] it is not in man
[1:38:28] that walketh to direct his steps
[1:38:33] it's not in men
[1:38:35] it's not in him to choose his own ways
[1:38:37] it's God's
[1:38:40] if we could understand that this evening
[1:38:41] before we close but to understand that
[1:38:44] that our steps were ordered by God
[1:38:48] these Paths of righteousness was it come
[1:38:52] from the heart of God
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:58] 's purpose God's Divine will
[1:39:03] and then he would choose us to walk
[1:39:05] these paths
[1:39:07] how can you fail how can you lose
[1:39:12] Philippians 2 and 13 says for it is God
[1:39:15] which worketh in you both too will and
[1:39:17] to do
[1:39:18] according of his good pleasure
[1:39:21] James 1 18 it says of his own will beget
[1:39:25] he us
[1:39:26] with the word of Truth
[1:39:29] he begat us with the revealed word
[1:39:34] that we should be a kind of firstfruits
[1:39:36] of his creatures
[1:39:38] creation
[1:39:40] so notice that of his own will everybody
[1:39:42] say of his own will
[1:39:44] he begat us of his own will he began us
[1:39:47] there is no other reason that he begot
[1:39:50] you
[1:39:50] outside of his own will
[1:39:55] nothing
[1:39:57] his dealings with you is purely divine
[1:40:01] it's it it purely comes from his heart
[1:40:05] his love for you is not is not
[1:40:08] influenced from anything outside of him
[1:40:11] it's all coming from from him to you
[1:40:16] right
[1:40:17] so so he chose you he beget you of his
[1:40:22] own will and there was no external
[1:40:24] influence
[1:40:25] to cause him to do it
[1:40:27] his will determine the matter
[1:40:30] therefore you're saved
[1:40:32] therefore you're secure
[1:40:35] therefore these Paths of righteousness
[1:40:38] that you're walking on
[1:40:39] was divinely ordered for you
[1:40:43] and you say man
[1:40:45] I thought of this this phrase he began
[1:40:48] us
[1:40:50] which means bring forth he brings us he
[1:40:53] to bring forth just like James 1 and 15
[1:40:58] it says sin bringeth forth death
[1:41:01] sin is the beginning the start the calls
[1:41:04] and death comes from it
[1:41:07] he of his own will beget us
[1:41:10] by the word of Truth
[1:41:12] didn't you say Amen so see
[1:41:17] the word of Truth didn't just bring us
[1:41:21] as a creation
[1:41:23] see he didn't just bring us forth as a
[1:41:26] creation but the word of Truth is the
[1:41:28] seed or germ of life that brought us
[1:41:30] forth
[1:41:33] you understand
[1:41:36] it's not just that God says okay I'm
[1:41:39] going to create sister Bethany push
[1:41:41] and there you are
[1:41:44] then you're left to your own devices and
[1:41:46] you're just like well okay I'm a
[1:41:48] creation of God by his spoken word
[1:41:52] but you were begat by the word of Truth
[1:41:55] showing that the word of Truth was the
[1:41:57] seed
[1:41:59] it was your origin
[1:42:01] and that word of Truth goes all the way
[1:42:03] back to the mind of God it's an eternal
[1:42:05] word an eternal purpose
[1:42:08] and we didn't come expressing that at
[1:42:10] all
[1:42:11] but he redeemed us
[1:42:14] that he could bring us back to what he
[1:42:16] began us from back to our origin
[1:42:19] can you say man and this is the Prophet
[1:42:22] this was the whole purpose of the
[1:42:23] prophet of this day it's not just to
[1:42:25] take us like Moses all the way to the
[1:42:27] beginning but he took us beyond the
[1:42:29] beginning
[1:42:30] he took us not just to Creation in the
[1:42:33] Garden of Eden but he took us all the
[1:42:35] way in the mind of God and said you were
[1:42:37] there in the beginning and you never did
[1:42:39] it in the first place
[1:42:41] he's showing our origin
[1:42:43] and it was all by the Divine will of God
[1:42:46] now here we are in in in our mortal
[1:42:50] beings here we are with all the the
[1:42:52] human element and yet we we have to look
[1:42:55] at it that we're walking in Paths of
[1:42:58] righteousness that is impossible to walk
[1:43:01] by man himself because we would have
[1:43:03] never chose these paths
[1:43:05] but he chose them
[1:43:08] he ordered our steps
[1:43:10] and he's the one that leads us
[1:43:16] we have such a hope
[1:43:19] such a hope can you say Amen
[1:43:21] if the musicians will come
[1:43:28] Psalms 40 and 2 he brought me up also
[1:43:31] out of an horrible pit
[1:43:33] out of the Myra clay and set my feet up
[1:43:35] on a rock
[1:43:37] and established my Goings
[1:43:41] speaking in the sense of going someplace
[1:43:44] going forward moving taking steps
[1:43:48] he's established my steps in other words
[1:43:52] and I like here Psalms 119 133 it says
[1:43:55] order or establish my steps in thy
[1:44:01] can you say man
[1:44:04] so God has his word set in all ages
[1:44:08] and the prophet said his foreknowledge
[1:44:10] has caused him to set in the church and
[1:44:12] in the people certain things that he did
[1:44:14] from the beginning
[1:44:16] and then the gospel that's being
[1:44:18] preached to that age is only revealed to
[1:44:20] that certain people and the rest of them
[1:44:22] don't see it
[1:44:24] that's predestination
[1:44:26] and that's what Jesus said he said
[1:44:28] father I thank thee that thou has hid
[1:44:30] these things from the wise and the
[1:44:31] Prudence but has revealed them unto
[1:44:33] babes as would learn
[1:44:35] ain't that right
[1:44:37] and so we we know what the prophet said
[1:44:39] about it he didn't choose his
[1:44:41] predestination didn't didn't well I'm
[1:44:43] going to choose this one and not choose
[1:44:44] this one amen but he already knew he had
[1:44:47] an infinite mind
[1:44:48] and and so him being infinite he knew
[1:44:51] every flee that would be on the earth he
[1:44:53] knew how many times each flea would back
[1:44:55] their eye he knew how much Tallow or fat
[1:44:57] that each flea would have he knew every
[1:45:00] blade of grass that each flea would set
[1:45:02] upon that's the infinite mind
[1:45:05] and the Bible talks about Christ being
[1:45:07] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:45:10] ain't that right and then the prophet
[1:45:12] asked when was he slain before the
[1:45:15] foundation of the world when was this
[1:45:17] and he says way back in the beginning
[1:45:19] when he first thought of this redeemed
[1:45:22] body
[1:45:24] see you were already thought of in the
[1:45:27] mind of God
[1:45:28] now here you are walking in the very
[1:45:31] steps and the Very paths that God
[1:45:33] ordered for you
[1:45:35] Hallelujah
[1:45:37] young people you can't lose
[1:45:41] you can't go down
[1:45:43] steps have already been ordered
[1:45:46] by God
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:50] that's why you didn't stumble getting
[1:45:51] the Holy Ghost you didn't stumble into
[1:45:53] this message you didn't stumble at the
[1:45:55] altar you just didn't stumble into these
[1:45:58] things
[1:45:59] he had been leading you all along
[1:46:01] leading you all along can you say man
[1:46:05] how many times has the devil tried to
[1:46:07] stop it
[1:46:08] I thought of Jesus's life here he's made
[1:46:10] that declaration it becometh us to feel
[1:46:13] all righteousness and yet as he's on his
[1:46:16] way to fulfill all righteousness on that
[1:46:18] boat the devil stares up a storm stares
[1:46:21] up the winds trying to get them waves to
[1:46:24] sink that boat
[1:46:25] trying to stop the purpose of God
[1:46:29] Jesus having God within him he was God
[1:46:32] could stand up on the bow of that ship
[1:46:36] speak to the storms peace be still
[1:46:40] and the winds and the waves obeyed their
[1:46:42] master
[1:46:44] but then we see that same God in a
[1:46:46] redeemed body there on the mountain
[1:46:49] where Colorado or New York or wherever
[1:46:52] that was when the snowstorm was coming
[1:46:54] the blizzard was there amen and the same
[1:46:57] God spoke to that storm and it caused it
[1:47:00] stopped it ain't that right now church I
[1:47:04] just believe that if you're ordered of
[1:47:06] God if you've got a path that you've got
[1:47:09] to walk I don't care how many Devils try
[1:47:11] to sink your ship
[1:47:13] you have every right to stand on that
[1:47:16] bow of that ship and say peace be still
[1:47:19] peace be still Satan you can't take me
[1:47:22] down Satan you can't destroy Satan you
[1:47:26] have no hold on me I'm here to fulfill
[1:47:29] the righteousness of God I'm here he's
[1:47:33] leading me in these Paths of
[1:47:35] righteousness I have an understanding of
[1:47:39] what I am to do you love him
