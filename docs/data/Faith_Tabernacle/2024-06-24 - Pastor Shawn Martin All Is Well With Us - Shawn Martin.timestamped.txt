[41:37] well and uh I think the the attitude her
[41:41] attitude is is of all of that
[41:46] uh of of the bride of Christ today and U
[41:52] here of course she wasn't able to have a
[41:55] child and uh but she uh if you noticed
[42:00] um and we didn't read it but um she had
[42:05] U
[42:06] found uh something special about this
[42:09] man and uh no doubt had heard about him
[42:13] and maybe even listen to some of his
[42:15] sermons I don't know but she knew that
[42:19] this man was a prophet and that uh God
[42:23] was with him and so she knew that he
[42:26] would come
[42:27] by uh their way and she wanted to do
[42:30] something special for him and so um she
[42:34] had asked her husband and if they could
[42:37] build a room or something for him to to
[42:40] come uh when he was through the area and
[42:44] so it was that they done that the Lord
[42:47] and so uh the prophet uh wanted to do
[42:51] something for her because uh she had
[42:54] been kind and so
[42:57] as we know uh she said nothing you know
[43:00] of course then she wasn't doing it for
[43:03] something she just out of a good heart
[43:05] wanted to do something for the Lord and
[43:09] um um so the servant said well she's
[43:13] Barren she can't have child and then the
[43:16] Lord spoke through that Prophet you will
[43:18] have a child and of course if you uh
[43:22] read there she she when when he told
[43:26] this the lady lady that she said now
[43:28] don't lie to me you know don't don't lie
[43:31] to me and and he said well you shall
[43:33] surely have a child and um and she took
[43:37] that to heart I'm going to have a child
[43:41] and so this is where we're at in in the
[43:43] the deal but also uh when the child got
[43:48] sick if you notice she did not give up
[43:52] she didn't say well the Lord did give me
[43:54] a child and and so you know I'm just
[43:57] happy with what he gave me and allowed
[43:59] me to have but she thought no no if God
[44:03] gave me that child then I can still that
[44:05] child should live death ain't going to
[44:07] take that child away from me and because
[44:11] the prophet was still in the land she
[44:15] she knew that if I could get to that
[44:17] Prophet if I could just you know and and
[44:21] I think it's interesting that uh you
[44:25] know the prophet said well why why you
[44:27] know when she got to the prophet then
[44:29] she just she said all is well and he
[44:33] said well what would make her say that
[44:35] and and he says because she got in the
[44:38] presence of the prophet and she knew
[44:41] that everything's going to be
[44:43] fine and well why is that is that
[44:46] because she was worshiping a man is it
[44:48] because that uh you know uh uh you know
[44:53] whatever no it wasn't that it was that
[44:55] she knew that the word of of the Lord
[44:57] come to a prophet and and she knew that
[45:01] you know a prophet had more and I I'll
[45:04] say it this way Prophet has more
[45:06] superiority over anything over a king
[45:10] over over a doctor over um uh uh a
[45:16] preacher a bishop uh whatever because
[45:19] the words that a prophet would speak
[45:21] would be the word of God so it's coming
[45:24] from a Supreme Being and more than just
[45:28] a a prophet ain't that right amen and so
[45:31] she knew that if if she could just get
[45:34] to that Prophet now I I there a lot of
[45:37] things that we could say out of this uh
[45:39] text and and things and uh but but one
[45:44] of the things that I I I think of is of
[45:48] of of of the respect that she had uh
[45:52] toward the man of God she but also in
[45:57] the situation that she had no was in
[46:00] look at the the the response and the
[46:04] attitude that she had uh toward him she
[46:08] she could have went all kinds of ways
[46:11] when she got to that Prophet she could
[46:12] have said man you lied to me you know or
[46:15] or you know I you just let me down and
[46:19] and on and on and on she could have
[46:21] berated the prophet of God she she could
[46:23] have done anything but instead of doing
[46:27] these things her her respect amen caused
[46:31] her uh uh uh to say all is well all is
[46:36] well everything's going to be fine I
[46:38] mean her baby's dead laying laying at
[46:41] home her husband don't know what to do
[46:44] uh the prophet described in one place
[46:46] that he's just walking the floors
[46:48] ringing his hands and and and and you
[46:51] know I mean their son just died and yet
[46:54] uh uh her Fai
[46:57] stayed in contact and stayed intact
[47:00] because of her respect now you
[47:04] know the word of the Lord comes to us
[47:08] and we've we've had a prophet in this
[47:10] age say many many things uh gave us many
[47:15] promises uh we were we were kind of like
[47:18] that woman baren uh in many ways and and
[47:23] uh I I think uh we we were in in worse
[47:26] shape in a lot of ways because of of uh
[47:31] that was in a natural sense but here we
[47:33] were caught up in in all kinds of things
[47:37] whether it if you come from a
[47:39] denomination if you were taught in in
[47:42] the ways of the world or the ways of of
[47:45] man and and false doctrines and things
[47:49] like that and and you know uh uh what
[47:53] hope did we have but then you know we
[47:58] hear the words began to come from a
[48:02] prophet's mouth in this age a word
[48:05] Prophet not just any Prophet but a word
[48:07] prophet and and he began to speak
[48:10] promises over our
[48:12] lives uh you you you are the bride of
[48:15] Christ uh you you got a future
[48:19] home man he he wasn't just describing
[48:22] the home he was describing it for a
[48:25] people right and I believe I'm one of
[48:28] them he he was trying to show us what
[48:31] our home is what our future is it's one
[48:35] thing for a man to talk about it but
[48:37] then when he starts pointing and making
[48:39] it personal you know to you and you know
[48:43] and and and I think like I you know uh
[48:46] Elisha could have just told a woman well
[48:48] a woman's going to have a child well
[48:50] okay a woman's going to have a child but
[48:52] it didn't make it anything personal to
[48:53] her but when he said you're going to
[48:55] have that child
[48:57] then that's different and this is what
[48:59] this message does is to us I think I
[49:02] take the message in a personal way
[49:05] because I believe it's promises for me
[49:08] and and you know like to say is
[49:10] listening to brother brandom talk of the
[49:12] uh uh uh going beyond the curtain of
[49:15] time he is having brother Neville to
[49:17] read the vision and I don't know as as I
[49:20] was just listening you know something
[49:22] just began to just rise up in my heart
[49:24] and I thought oh God I want to press the
[49:27] battle and I want to do all that I can I
[49:32] uh I want to make it I I just do and
[49:35] well why because to me that's personal
[49:38] to me that he's telling of where I'm
[49:41] going and and he's describing uh a place
[49:45] that I long to be and there's just
[49:48] something that starts connecting me with
[49:51] that and and and I yearn so so there's
[49:54] promises here that that come from a
[49:57] prophet not speaking of any age but your
[50:01] age us we are that people do you believe
[50:05] that we are the people that all the
[50:08] promises of God have given I the the
[50:11] Rapture Who who how many would have
[50:13] longed to to be part of that as a group
[50:17] of people that never go taste death
[50:21] never and actually have a changing of
[50:24] the body amen and yet we are that people
[50:27] here on Earth we are seeing things like
[50:31] like never before but yet because we
[50:34] have these promises and we feel good
[50:37] when we hear them uh uh maybe a a
[50:41] minister preaching and and talking about
[50:44] them or we're hearing it on tape and
[50:47] whatever and it's good when the Lord
[50:48] just comes and he and he and he just uh
[50:52] uh excites us it the word of God should
[50:55] always excite us
[50:58] uh no matter how many times we've heard
[51:00] it it it should do something for us
[51:03] because it's always a reminder of where
[51:06] we're going and what's happening and
[51:08] that we're not in the world and but yet
[51:11] yet the word of the Lord is always um
[51:15] we're going to go through things in life
[51:18] that's that's and this is where this
[51:20] lady was is God had given her the
[51:23] promise yes the promise come uh she had
[51:27] that baby but now Satan was death was
[51:30] trying to take the child but but she
[51:33] just would not look at that and just
[51:35] call it quits she wouldn't call it that
[51:39] and but she would hold to that promise
[51:42] yeah she kept that promise dear to her
[51:45] and I think that's where we're at today
[51:48] is that that uh uh yes God gave you know
[51:52] the prophet's been gone a long time now
[51:55] uh uh I don't know how many years been
[51:57] been quite a while and and we just it
[52:01] just seemed like it's just one trial
[52:03] after another it's just one thing after
[52:06] another and now God does answer our
[52:08] prayers we've we I think all of us and
[52:11] hearing sister Brenda uh today give her
[52:14] testimony and and then uh uh brother
[52:17] shemiah and sister Bethany and her
[52:20] testimony sister Jane's got her we've
[52:22] all got our testimonies of what God has
[52:24] done for us and that's that's that's
[52:27] wonderful but but when the Trials come
[52:29] you you you just can't call it quits and
[52:33] and and and just say well God's been
[52:35] good to me this far and so now you know
[52:38] and then we just accept what a lot
[52:41] allotted to us that maybe Satan's trying
[52:43] to give to us I just don't think we we
[52:46] ought to say no to the devil I I think
[52:49] if if God gave us a promise we ought to
[52:51] hang on to it I I'm glad that I've
[52:54] enjoyed my Christianity this far but
[52:57] uh I don't expect the de I ain't going
[52:59] to let the devil take my joy from me now
[53:02] I I'm glad for everything up to this
[53:05] point that God has done for me but I
[53:07] don't see that my future's too dark I'm
[53:10] not going to let the devil paint me a
[53:12] dark future uh uh I I just feel like
[53:16] every word is is mine every promise is
[53:19] mine and if he if God can heal me and he
[53:22] has healed me then why can't I just
[53:25] accept that op option is mine and and if
[53:28] adoption is mine why can't I accept for
[53:30] a Rapture and a body change and why
[53:33] can't I accept everything that God has
[53:36] for us but the testings the
[53:39] trials everything is going to be there I
[53:43] I was thinking of a scripture uh there
[53:46] in Psalms
[53:49] 10519 and I think it was talking of uh
[53:53] uh Joseph here Joseph was given Visions
[53:57] dreams and Promises of everything and
[54:01] and uh you if yall know the story of
[54:03] Joseph uh God had given him quite a bit
[54:06] of promises and it just seemed you know
[54:09] ridiculous really and when he even told
[54:11] his Brethren they laughed at him and
[54:14] thought this was crazy and his even his
[54:16] father you know thinking man you know
[54:19] maybe he's stretching this out a little
[54:21] too far but God had given him to him and
[54:24] and Joseph clinged to them and of course
[54:27] it got him in trouble for for even
[54:29] talking about them promises just like a
[54:32] lot of times us Satan hates it when you
[54:34] talk about the promises God gave you he
[54:37] hates it ain't that right but but you
[54:40] got to you got to tell it anyways amen
[54:43] tell tell what God has done for you tell
[54:45] what God has revealed to you tell if you
[54:48] feel like you're a child of God tell
[54:49] people about it if you if you feel like
[54:52] you know you believe in your heart that
[54:54] God has revealed to you that that you're
[54:56] going to make it in a Rapture tell
[54:58] somebody about it don't be ashamed of it
[55:02] well they say they might say well that's
[55:04] stretching a little too far no it's not
[55:07] when when you're a Son of God when God
[55:10] reveals these promises it's more real
[55:13] than anything on this Earth because the
[55:16] word of the Lord must come to pass and
[55:20] well well and so anyway uh Joseph had
[55:23] these Pro uh promises given to him but
[55:26] it didn't come right away the word of
[55:29] the Lord the Bible says the word of the
[55:31] Lord can you pull that up Psalms 105 the
[55:34] word until the time that his word came
[55:38] can you say that with me until the time
[55:40] that his word came the word of the Lord
[55:43] Tried Him think of that the word of the
[55:47] Lord is going to try us and and for you
[55:51] young people
[55:53] especially uh uh life is not
[55:56] uh uh a
[55:58] cakewalk and if if you're looking for
[56:00] things that are easy you know we we're
[56:03] living in an age where everybody wants
[56:05] get rich quick you know and uh they're
[56:08] willing to gamble their house and
[56:10] everything just to just to win that
[56:13] million dollars people spend money just
[56:16] to for the lottery so just hoping that
[56:19] they can come a millionaire overnight
[56:21] everybody wants something fast everybody
[56:23] wants something quick everybody want
[56:26] like the the magic one you know to to
[56:29] wave over them and then their whole life
[56:31] changes well that ain't going to happen
[56:34] but I will tell you uh uh you don't have
[56:36] to gamble your life away on these
[56:39] promises amen every promise of God is
[56:42] sure it's steadfast and you're not
[56:45] gambling you don't have to lose your
[56:47] home you don't have to lose your money
[56:49] you don't you don't have to lose your
[56:50] mind your marriage or anything amen just
[56:54] to stand up on the word of God
[56:56] can you say Amen see because because
[56:59] they're true but but it's not it's it's
[57:03] not get rich quick it's not always the
[57:06] word of the Lord is going to try us
[57:09] right can you say Amen it's going to try
[57:12] us but you've got to stand upon that
[57:14] word of God you got to stand knowing
[57:17] that God had promised it knowing that
[57:20] God is is is true to his word how many
[57:23] beli that God is true God is true to his
[57:27] word another thing in in just uh
[57:31] thinking here uh and that is that when
[57:35] she got to the pro the prophet of God
[57:38] that she had a respect for that man she
[57:41] had respect to the words that he would
[57:43] say and have respect and I I thought you
[57:47] know now I understand that the prophet
[57:49] is gone and and so it would have been
[57:52] nice to be in his presence and not that
[57:55] he's God but as brother Brandon would
[57:57] say that a prophet of God that prophet
[57:59] of God was a representative of God so
[58:03] this little lady could not see God but
[58:06] she knew that God was working through
[58:09] that
[58:10] individual and so that she found comfort
[58:13] in his presence to know that that he
[58:17] he's he can get in touch with God maybe
[58:19] when she couldn't get in touch with God
[58:22] you understand what I'm saying and and I
[58:24] I thought of even Martha uh in in her
[58:27] situation uh there her brother Lazarus
[58:30] had died and and uh it was an impossible
[58:33] situation but when she heard that Jesus
[58:37] had come there to visit there was such a
[58:41] respect toward him that she ran out and
[58:45] and brother Brown says she could have
[58:47] berated him she could have given him the
[58:49] cold shoulder she could have uh done
[58:52] anything but instead of doing something
[58:56] negative she fell at his feet and she
[58:59] called him Lord Lord if I would have
[59:03] been here my La my brother Lazarus
[59:05] wouldn't have died but see the fact that
[59:08] she showed him respect in what he was he
[59:13] was her Lord and and brother Ram said
[59:17] now if she would have approached him in
[59:19] any way other way then she would have
[59:22] never got what she asked for that's
[59:24] right but she was in need
[59:27] and she recognized that there was
[59:29] somebody that was that could get in
[59:32] touch with God there was God in flesh
[59:37] can you say Amen you know I I think of
[59:41] of and you might think I'm stretching it
[59:44] and I don't think I am uh but I I think
[59:48] well what about Representatives here
[59:51] today in on the Earth today yes it would
[59:55] have been nice to have have have uh you
[1:00:00] know the prophet like I said to be here
[1:00:03] to where we could drive to Indiana many
[1:00:06] people drove to Indiana just to have him
[1:00:08] to pray and and they got they got what
[1:00:11] they asked for a lot of them just would
[1:00:14] call him on the phone I thought of uh
[1:00:17] that that young man Luke Garrett uh
[1:00:19] brother BR talks about him of how that
[1:00:21] every time he got a cold anything that
[1:00:24] happened to him they just called
[1:00:26] uh brother Bram brother Bram just pray
[1:00:28] over the phone and God would just
[1:00:29] instantly heal uh uh and not that
[1:00:33] brother brandham was God but he was a
[1:00:35] representative it was a prophet of God
[1:00:38] the word come to a prophet ain't that
[1:00:40] right amen and so it would have been
[1:00:42] nice in that way but I it would have
[1:00:44] been nice uh to be there with Mary or
[1:00:47] Martha Mary to uh you know uh to where
[1:00:50] we could just have that physical contact
[1:00:53] with Jesus Christ uh and to know to know
[1:00:57] that everything's okay because he's come
[1:01:00] think of that if you come to your house
[1:01:02] and Jesus coming to your house or
[1:01:05] walking into the church in his physical
[1:01:09] stature what it been nice to be able
[1:01:12] just to sit down and talk to him and
[1:01:15] just to have a one-on-one conversation
[1:01:18] or um if you have needs I mean people
[1:01:21] even gave Jesus their babies to just to
[1:01:24] bless to touch and and that was a
[1:01:26] blessing right uh I thought of uh you
[1:01:30] know the the Catholics of how that when
[1:01:33] that uh when the pope you know he goes
[1:01:36] downtown or wherever he goes and there's
[1:01:38] a big old line and they're passing
[1:01:40] babies you know holding their babies out
[1:01:42] so he just touches them and they figure
[1:01:44] that's a blessing you know and so uh but
[1:01:48] but they they want some representation
[1:01:51] and they think that the Pope's a
[1:01:52] representative of God but in this age we
[1:01:55] know that the Bride is a representation
[1:01:58] of God they're they're a representative
[1:02:02] every one of us is a representative of
[1:02:05] Jesus Christ do you believe that I I I
[1:02:08] just believe that I I think when we come
[1:02:12] together am among a body of
[1:02:15] Believers uh uh we we ought to show and
[1:02:19] and know that that that God is with us
[1:02:23] God is with us I I I believe God's with
[1:02:26] brother Amos I I believe God's with
[1:02:29] brother Tim faith I believe God's with
[1:02:31] you and sister Jane and sister Brenda
[1:02:35] brother Branson brother Cole you know
[1:02:39] and and and and all of us we we we are a
[1:02:43] body of Jesus Christ amen and and with
[1:02:47] that being said we ought to find comfort
[1:02:49] in one another's presence not that we
[1:02:52] would ex exalt one another I I think
[1:02:55] some times we're too afraid of
[1:02:57] exaltation that we belittle one another
[1:02:59] and and we shouldn't belittle one
[1:03:01] another we we shouldn't get to the place
[1:03:04] that well I ain't I ain't exalting
[1:03:06] anyone you know because they get lifted
[1:03:08] up and all that well you you're missing
[1:03:11] the point just like everybody misses the
[1:03:13] point by not having the picture you know
[1:03:15] I'm not saying everybody but some don't
[1:03:17] have the picture in in in the church
[1:03:20] they don't think it's right A fitting
[1:03:22] place but uh because they afraid that
[1:03:25] everybody think that we're lifting
[1:03:26] brother brandom up well that's just so
[1:03:28] far from the truth but because we you
[1:03:31] know we ain't going to let negativity I
[1:03:34] mean there might be some people think
[1:03:35] that but I'm not going to let their
[1:03:37] negativity keep me from uh having a
[1:03:41] picture of really why I have that
[1:03:43] picture you know and and same way is it
[1:03:46] today we don't exalt one another just
[1:03:49] like we don't exalt brother brandham so
[1:03:51] so people say well you read too many
[1:03:53] quotes and and you're just exalt brother
[1:03:56] BR well that's not true uh you know
[1:03:58] we've been accused of of uh being deity
[1:04:02] you know deifying the flesh because we
[1:04:04] just believe what brother Brown says is
[1:04:05] the truth and that's it and shouldn't be
[1:04:07] debatable and but but just because they
[1:04:10] believe them things don't don't uh keep
[1:04:13] us from believing what we believe and so
[1:04:15] is it today you know Satan would tried
[1:04:18] to put a a a stumbling block of of of
[1:04:23] maybe getting us to where we don't look
[1:04:27] at one another the way we really should
[1:04:29] look at one another we we are
[1:04:32] representatives of God and we ought to
[1:04:35] have such a respect for one another a
[1:04:38] faith in one another that we really have
[1:04:41] confidence in one another's prayers you
[1:04:44] believe that I I think that's actually
[1:04:47] scriptural is that we could have
[1:04:49] confidence in one another's prayers and
[1:04:52] and know that if I'm in need if if uh uh
[1:04:57] you know if if I'm down if I'm here and
[1:05:01] or whatever that we could ask someone
[1:05:03] say Hey you know I'm I'm really needing
[1:05:05] prayer you know and and when someone
[1:05:07] says I'm praying for you that should
[1:05:09] really mean something to us can you say
[1:05:11] Amen why because we're not just
[1:05:14] churchgoers we're not just church
[1:05:16] members we are representatives of Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ on this Earth I just believe that
[1:05:23] can you say amen and and if we can we're
[1:05:27] we're so anyways I that's just what I've
[1:05:30] been thinking uh today is is that you
[1:05:33] know um uh I believe that God is for
[1:05:36] us're we're not just beggarly people
[1:05:39] we're not just we're not victims to the
[1:05:42] enemy at all God has given us promises
[1:05:47] can you say Amen he's given us the word
[1:05:50] of God that we can stand on Amen and so
[1:05:55] I wanted just encourage you to keep
[1:05:57] pressing the battle amen and whatever
[1:06:00] you do press the battle take take your
[1:06:03] Christianity take what God has done for
[1:06:05] you in all seriousness be sincere amen
[1:06:10] be sincere in what you do be sincere in
[1:06:13] your worship be sincere in your prayer
[1:06:16] be sincere in your life be sincere
[1:06:20] always watch what you do watch what you
[1:06:23] go where you go watch what you say
[1:06:27] always just just let the presence of God
[1:06:29] be with us because we realize that we
[1:06:32] are representatives of Jesus Christ can
[1:06:36] you say Amen you love the Lord if the
[1:06:38] musicians will
[1:06:40] come amen the
[1:06:43] Lord representatives of Jesus
[1:06:46] Christ that's right
