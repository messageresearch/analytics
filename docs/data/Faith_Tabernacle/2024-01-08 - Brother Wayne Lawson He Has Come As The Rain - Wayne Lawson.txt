the AIS and begins to minister to the needs and we as we've been taught we it's not it's God puts the gift in a minister but he does not bring the Revival it takes the people to pull on the the gift

we know the Lord's going to do wonderful things if we can just get out of his way amen amen and so we just want to take a few minutes tonight in the word Psalms 139 and amen and I seen da Sneak in back there it's sure good to see her tonight and amen I won't call everybody's name now aren't I amen amen just it's so good to see everybody amen it feels kind of feel like coming home nearly sister Heather it just am man just a good feeling in the church tonight and amen we love him Psalms 139 verse 14 to verse 17 and I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth th eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all all my members were written a't that amazing amen that David was all written out in the scripture before he ever come to the Earth and in thy book was all the members written which in countenance were fashioned when as yet they were none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them let's also look in the book of Hosea the 6th chapter Hosea chapter 6 and verse one come and let us return to the Lord he have torn and he will heal us and he has smitten and he will bind us up and after two days will he revive us and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now brother Bram said we're well into that third day now it was about 2700 years ago this prophecy was made brother said here we are moving into that third day and of course this is speaking Hosea to Israel but I love how that the fellowship between Israel and the Gentiles are tied together in Prophecy because the Gentiles had to fulfill certain portions before the Israelites can fulfill their portion and so they moved together in Prophecy amen now he says then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and the former rain unto the earth now tonight I would like to speak to you a little while I'm going to take that last portion of that and I'm just going to say it like this he has come unto us as the rain let's just bow our hearts father we thank you tonight tonight for your word we thank you for these men of God that have gathered in this building Lord for these saints that have gathered around your word we thank you Lord that there's a place established Lord that still believes you and loves you and Lord as your message is being sent into all the Earth lord it's catching hearts and lives and father we have gathered in this building tonight to assemble ourselves around that Lord father maybe some even watching tonight on the video and things Lord and maybe later they'll see these things but dear God we're asking you that may you come here in this visible audience tonight Lord and may you touch the needs these people have driven they've put aside their time through this week Lord and we just ask you now that you would take your servant Lord you would use us for your glory and your honor and Lord that you would speak to the need now Lord we ask you bless this community and all that Lord is in the reach of this word we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and God bless you as you could be seated tonight I want to take just a few minutes here amen for he has come unto us as the rain um I I certainly trust that uh that we uh realize that this is such a beautiful hour of the hour of the great bride's Revival amen and I uh am one of those who contend to the reality that we're not looking for Revival that we are the Fulfillment of Revival and I love how brother bam said and how could I overcome he said now I chose this because I think that it's time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die right we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we must never let this this revival die within us now this revival is not dying but we don't know what to die within us we got to constantly brother BR said keep this in Revival now I believe specifically that this is a season uh that would be a chance or an opportunity for the believer some are the church age brother Brandon will say this he said here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest In the Flesh there thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn somebody say our turn in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest In the Flesh and these Eternal thoughts now manifest in his flesh are the sons of God even as we are soall we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborned for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened nonseed there is nothing to Quicken now David says in Psalms 139 that my substance was not hid from thee and I was made in secret and I was curiously wrought my substance there was something of David that was existent in God there was something that was not hid from God and brother Ram said it was in our turn that we become the many membered spoken word be in other words that there was a turn the church has a turn to become that part of God that would be expressed and David would say here that my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously rod in the lowest parts of the Earth for Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect but in thy book all my members were written and in countenance were fashioned as it were none of them how precious are thy thoughts unto us how precious are thy thoughts now what's David is saying Lord I was in your mind eternally because brother B going tell us this that the elect have an eternal quality under them that the thoughts of God are real and they are Eternal amen so as in the mind of God you are Eternal in the mind of God and and David begin to say Lord that thought of me oh how precious Lord are thy thoughts unto me when you begin to see it now I I realize this I realize that there is no such thing as Eternal sunship amen how many knows hey brother maram said see there's no thing s such thing like that there's no Eternal sunship he said that's where the Roman Catholics went into error he said they tried to make Eternal son he said the word son he said think about it it's a created being it's not amen it's not an eternal son he said it never was eternal sunship amen but you see it's not the Eternal son Eternal sunship like but there is an eternal son in other words sons are Eternal amen now watch because the scripture will tell us amen that the Eternal son see there cannot be Eternal because you have beginnings and endings that which beginning is not Eternal and if you maybe but if you would mold it out of something Eternal then you would have an eternal substance in other words other words if you could look at something you take a brother Bam's thought on Michelangelo and you look at that great uh uh substance that was made Moses was made now now that that was not even made till am me you know in the late hundreds and and brother bam saw it and then he told us about it but he couldn't look at that and say that was an eternal image or he couldn't say that was a a thousand years old or a million years old because Michelangelo made it right amen but you see but the granite that he made it out of that Granite was as old as the creation of the heavens and the Earth and you recognize tonight that as Sons maybe well I'm but just take me I'm 50 years old amen but what I'm created out of is as Eternal as the god that created me brother said the sons of God are made out of Eternity they are as Eternal as God is eternal amen because they've been formed from Eternal substance the thoughts of God are real and they are Eternal you're not just you're not just an afterthought of God this isn't like the second thought of God this isn't just something that he come up with but in the beginning he B you in his mind and you're as Eternal as God is eternal but the word has now form that eternity into a human being and now I'm 50 year old and I'm Eternal amen because there's two beings and don't you ever forget amen I know we're 50 years old maybe however old you are and you look at your own self and you think about amen your age and you think about all these things that's happened in your age amen but don't you ever forget about the deity part of your life don't you forget about the Eternal part of your life amen that which had no beginning and had no end that part that was eternal before the foundations of the world I love it when the prophet of God begins to tell us about being predestinated in the mind of God and not only we were predestinated but we are a part of God and that's why we are a many member spoken word seed bride amen I I say this part there is an eternal soul in every believer and I believe that that is substance is an eternal substance amen if we had about an hour on that it'd be beautiful Eternal thought substance That's What You're Made Of is eternal thought substance do you recognize now somebody said well brother Wayne what then is the difference between us in Jesus I'm glad you ask brother randam says it like this he says we bypassed arth theophany he said and we come to the Earth he said but here is where we are tempted amen and brother man will teach us he'll say he'll say things like this he say see we were supposed to been born there he said but we wasn't born there we were born in this time element He said and we bypassed our theophany amen but what is the word come for the word has come to birth us and put us back in the same place amen that we should have been before we fail in the Garden of Eden friend the way back amen is that Eternal logos come on church and that Eternal logos is not the second person of the godhead it is God himself known to you as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're as Eternal as God as Eternal when eternity has come into you I know amen that just tears the legalist up but listen amen there's a soul inside of you that come from God and it will return to God you are the Eternal Gene attribute of almighty God that's why you believe this message that's why you believe this word that's why you're here tonight that's what settled in your soul that's why you made up your mind and that's why you will not fail to get back to where God made you to be because the word of God will never fail because God who is rich in Mercy has made these things for you and I and distribute Us in the power of God I think of this I think of God dealing with us in this age that there is no Eternal sunship of course but there is an eternal God living in his sons so what you're made out of I ain't made out of granite you're made from eternity that's a quote by the way what God does off of God when he created in the beginning what do he have to work with eternity see the Eternal sunship see now do you see that that is an eternal God in his son I love it how precious are thy thoughts unto me can you imagine amen seeing yourself in the scriptures the same as God created the heavens and the Earth your substance is in the Eternal Word of God When I See This I see David knowing the power of the thoughts of God no wonder Jeremiah and 29 you you all love this one it's a a great favor to many people Amen in the 11th verse he said I Know Thy thoughts that I think toward the sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end isn't that beautiful y'all remember this is Jeremiah amen This is Jeremiah 29 now you know they've been carried off into Babylon they've been carried out of their home country and it seems like that God must have bad intentions toward Israel because they've lost a place of worship everything's went wrong amen it just looks horrible it looks like that God wouldn't be for them but then he causes Jeremiah to say to them I know the thought I think hold you you you see because now watch this because we always give motive to other people's actions right and and and if if y'all's like me usually you give a bad motive I had to totally retrain my way of thinking you know if I see two people stand talking I used to I used to be so uh what they call complexed I used to have such a complex I couldn't go to a football game cuz every time they huddled I thought they talking about me but you you know what the prophet said he said when you see people doing that he said just assume they're getting talking about what they're going to get you for your birthday or what they're going to get you for Christmas or he man that they're talking about something good they're going to do to you see you got to turn that thinking around and and when something happens in your life you're just sure that God's upset with you or that something's going to happen but don't never forget the scripture and the scripture tells us that we're sons of prosperity we're Daughters of prosperity and the Bible said all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called according to their purpose you tell that Old Devil amen listen I ain't got no time to fool with you amen God's thoughts towards me are peace and of good and not of evil for he said so in his own word amen and his thoughts are precious unto me because when God begins to reveal his thought that's when love begins to strike your heart to know that he had you in his mind before the foundation of the world and everything that's ever happened in the world has happened happed around the revelation of who you would be in this generation and when you would come listen church I think it's beautiful for I know the thoughts that I think towards you do you know God before they left before they see see you you yall know the history lesson of course it it was when Israel left Jerusalem to they tore down the walls and They carried them into Babylon they're going to be there for 70 years right amen but before they ever left Jeremiah had already prophesied their return before they ever left I Isaiah had already prophesied the return Jeremiah had already told him you'll be there for 70 years and then you shall return do you see but God already had in his mind that the glory that you have now will not even be compared with the glory you'll have at a later time when I'm done with you you'll see my thoughts every thought that I have had has been for your good and it has been for your prosperity and God's purpose and will in your life is to prosper you in health is to prosper you in life it's the will of God that you would have life and truth and you would have an abundantly in his presence for I know the thought I think towards you saith the Lord thought of peace and not of evil to them amen to give them expected in this is the area when they come back when they come return to the to the temple this is where it is said and he guy remember when they're restoring the temple some people are disappointed with it remember that and they're disappointed with it and they said well the glory of this second temple is not quite as good as the glory of the first temple but the Bible said the glory of this lighter house shall be greater than the former amen sayith the Lord of hosts and in this place I will give peace sayith the Lord of hosts the glory of the second temple was greater than the glory of the first temple now people talk about three temples but just for Bible History there's only actually two temples there was Solomon's Temple tore down and then rebuilt again amen but that Temple that was rebuilt and in the days of zerubabel that Temple was not as glorious in its look amen but later it was kind of spruced up amen amen and and then they called it uh what's his name King King herod's Temple and they restored that Temple so they call it three actually it's only two temples but it was remodeled the last time but he was telling us that the glory of the latter would be greater than the glory of the first now what was the glory of that Temple of Solomon this was the glory when they said the word in the house of God the Bible said the glory of the Lord filled the temple where they were s so they couldn't even Minister and the shakol light came down and it dwelt as a midst in the children and back there where they couldn't see it hid behind the curtains over the word of God there was a glory that settled there over that word and it remained there but it was hidden from the eye of the people but in that latter Temple the Bible said in the Book of Malachi I think it's powerful things in the book of of Malachi it said for the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple and one day they knew that that same Shak Glory was going to take a flesh body and they said and we beheld him as the only begotten and the glory of God the word became flesh and when the word became flesh it was the visible glory of the almighty God and Jesus was the glory of God oh but Church of the Living God this Bri is the glory of Jesus Christ amen we are not looking at the pillar of fire tonight as a light above the crowd but I see the word that is joined with the power of God and now the glory is greater than it was before and we beheld his glory they saw it amen as the only begotten Son of God they have Jesus said if you have seen me come on you have seen my father oh my the glory of the latter was greater than the glory of the first for the Lord whom you seek just suddenly come to this Temple and when he stepped into the door they didn't even know him but the glory of the latter house was the word had become flesh oh my come on church we look back there and we see that first day of Pentecost and we see him filled in the upper room we see the power of God come and we talk about it and we talk about it and we look at what's happening today and we don't see it as glorious as what it was in that day but let me let me say this to you tonight the glory of this latter house it shall be greater than the glory the former house amen because the word that was given to the Thessalonians that the Lord in say should descend from a heaven and there'll be a change in our body in the Corinthians it was prophesied that they would rais up in death will be swalled in Victory and the glory of the lateral house that first church it come to its Perfection but God put it in the ground as a seed and they were planted in the ground but that latter house the glory of this latter house is the word would be fulfilled in the house of God oh Church of the Living God I tell you tell the devil get out of the way amen the darkness has come upon the Earth and gross Darkness but his thoughts they are precious unto me because I know what God is thinking oh these bad things happening Brother Wayne God must hate us to put us in this age I know what he's thinking he's already told the devil I got one I can trust you can try this eve every which way you can try amen but I got an eve that will not fail because she is the word itself Hallelujah you talk about a precious thought tonight how precious how precious are his thoughts unto me oh my for my word my word my thoughts they're known unto me he says don't tell me how I feel about you I know how I feel about you isn't that powerful the thoughts of peace and not of evil now there's some uh uh some people I don't know I'm not picking on anyone specifically I just mean thoughts there are thoughts that somehow the message is different than the Bible right which has been a great insult to the message people say well had you rather take the message or had you rather take scripture well then you're suggesting that the message is somehow outside the scripture amen come on which is a great insult and people say well you want Paul's gospel or brother bram's gospel well let me say this Jesus amen don't have another gospel and Paul said I'm I'm surprised that you've been removed to another gospel being there is not another gospel there isn't another gospel somebody said well then do we understand P Paul didn't listen there were things revealed in Paul's day that light didn't come on it to this day but the same as in Genesis 3 when Jesus was being prophesied as the woman's seed the prophecy was already there but later it was told to Abraham he would be Abraham's seed it was not a different prophecy it was a furtherance of the Revelation and whatever Paul spoke in the gospels is the same thing we believe tonight but the seven seal has opened up and showed us the Revelation that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world then this Bible is the complete Cannon of the revelation of Jesus Christ and with a prophet standing there as an anointed eye we can see every action of the Bride is already written in the Bible this is a Bible bride this is a word believing bride we are not some illegitimate come by the side denomination we're the only real word church that's left on the earth don't have to tear out one page of the Bible I don't have to make one word of the Bible my baptism is Paul's bapt ISM predestination is Paul's predestination I preached the Rapture the same way Paul preached it come on church but we didn't understand it until God sent an anointed Eagle in this [Applause] age so I put an idea out there that somehow this message is different than the Bible it's probably the greatest insult ever given to William Brandon could you give me just a few minutes and anything brother brand priest I can show it to you in scripture and if I can I'm going to pray till I can cuz I know it's there I don't mean that arrogantly I mean that I know what the prophet taught amen now here's how he would teach the Bible every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form now if you can see that it's a seed form then you recognize the maturity the seed was not always spoke of okay Abraham I will deliver thee with a mighty hand they didn't know Moses's name when God told Moses to go down and deliver the children he didn't know Janice and jambers was going to show up it was in the seed though but as it began to develop you seen a fuller revelation of what had been laid in seed now watch the scripture for every word in the Bible is God thoughts laid in seed form that it received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible it brings the thing to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible said let the mind that was in Christ be in you amen and as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts they become expression the water of Separation he says you got to die to every thought of the flesh so that you can receive the mind of Christ and walk from hence forth not of your own but of his mind the mind of Christ in you that's the only way to stay alive woo that's the only way for you to remain alive in this age is the word has got to live in you it's the only living Force there is listen what he says that's the only way I can stay alive all I live by is by the Holy Spirit God said Jesus said man shall not live by let alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God brother man will say in 1954 he'll say if your heart and mind is so and filled with the God's spirit until your thought become his thought there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving the Mortal being what kind of people would we be the Holy Spirit has embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion oh God he he's bringing her down there ain't it now folks that's that's the real that's the real line right there the word our thought and it takes a lot of dying to stay on that word he said tell your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would be we what kind of people would be be this morning if brandom Tabernacle was so filled with the presence of God when you didn't even use your own mind didn't use your own thoughts you didn't have an alternative of your own you were just led by the spirit amen my goodness amen what's he saying you got to die to every thought of your flesh so that you can receive the mind of Christ and walk henceforth not of your own but of his mind the mind of Christ that's in you that's the only way see that's the only way that you can stay alive now somebody said well brother Wayne but I got I got some ideas here I love how brother Bram says this he says you think question mark he said see but you ain't got no think coming come on sounds sounds pressure don't it you ain't got no think coming he's not he's not trying to belittle you he's trying to exalt you because it's your thinking that keeps you out of the Eternal part of God's mind everything God thinks about you is eternal everything that you think about you is through your expressions and your family and your failures and your human life amen but you see if you don't got no thought coming and God's expressed his thoughts and you ain't got no right to think then let the mind of Christ come into you and he purposed and done the will of God if I do not the works then don't believe me see you ain't got no think coming he's the one that does the thinking let his mind come into you the same as it's in that word woo Glory I tell you what we're going to have to do we got to get outside of our own thinking now I know we could take this in a lot of directions but let's get down to the basis of the real faith that God put you on this Earth for you got to get away from what you think about yourself what your family thinks about you what individuals think about you and you've got to solely base your thinking on what the word of God has spoke concerning your life brother B said see we've got to go beyond the camp now we've got to go be on the camp of our own thinking woo Glory isn't that something that our own thinking becomes the denomination and if you don't agree with me you're out come on watch this amen we can get our own thinking and then we won't qualify anybody who don't get into that thinking pattern but I say every one of our thinking is wrong I say every preacher is wrong I say every denomination is wrong I say the message of the hour is right and the thoughts of God are right amen concerning you come on Church y'all know I speak the truth concerning the church the prophet of God said the denomination has crucified this word and from this day forward it is the word and the word only that I don't have to go ask no State presor I don't have to go ask no Bishop I don't have to go ask no certain church I don't have to go ask no certain people we have received the thought of God concerning our lives and this word we've got to get beyond the camp of our own thinking let this mind be in you that was in Christ you see what he done right there get beyond the camp of your thinking let this mind be in you so when you hear the scripture let this mind be in you it's automatically a call out of your own life see it's a call out of your own thinking let this mind be in you isn't it odd that's not that's not a it's not a forceful command it's a request let the word speaks of letting something happen it's letting something in the door kind of like behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man will open up can I say it I'll come in and give him my thinking let my thinking come into you now watch this because brother bam in the message Christ he'll say it like this he said you're not using your own thoughts you're using his thoughts let the mind that was in Christ be in you think his way of thinking what he says confession means say the same thing to confess is to say the same thing now carries the mind of Christ to your confession in other words when you begin to confess something you don't confess what you think about that you confess what the word of God says about that you can feel any way but you've got to hold the confession of the word over your life he is the high priest of our confessions is that right amen now here's the thing we cannot alter the word of God we have to alter our thinking let the mind of Christ come in you then you'll think like he thinks and begin to think on these things he says I can see him become all tore up see you got to think on these things now we can read it from the scripture Philippians chapter 2 let the mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and made in the likeness of men what was it the mind of God come into humanity and brought the glory of God into a human being amen look at this amen we've got it let it be formed into us the scripture in 1 Corinthians 2 watch how Paul say it for who hath known the mind of the Lord that's a good question for who hath known the mind of the Lord he says but we have the mind of Christ isn't that something who's got the mind of the Lord does the Baptist have it does the Lutheran have the mind of the Lord come on does the atheist have the mind of the Lord does the priesthood have the mind of the Lord who's got the mind of the Lord Paul said I've got the mind of Christ can I say this to you tonight we have received the mind of Christ when the message of the hour came to us it was the mind of Christ descending into the age by a prophetic word to give us divine rection upon mentality and life and the aspects of our homes our churches we have the mind of Christ can I say this this is not the fleshly mind of a man this is not the fleshly mind of a man we have received the mind of Christ and if we receive it as the word do you see the effectuality it would have in our lives we would receive an efficient and beneficient effect of the word of God because the message is not the thoughts of William brandham W Glory that's not the thoughts of brother bandam it is the thought of God spoken over the church it's the word it's the word of the age see we see this and we realize that in the unveiling brother Bram said the word manifested or revealed in the Revelation he said then what does that put me if he is the Shak of Glory I'm part of it amen the word itself revealed reveals itself my goodness Lord you see what brother Bram said I'm revealing myself by doing this he's saying I'm a part of this shakana and by me doing this I'm revealing to you I'm a part of this see the mystery reveals the son right uh Daniel uh somebody interpret this dream all them people and nobody could do it but because there was a mystery when Daniel interpreted it set him apart from the others and see because there is a message it sets you apart when it lives in you it divides the church from the bride see the mysteries of God made known unto us in this day by that same Heavenly messenger was made known to them in that days the same Pillar of Fire that sent Moses the pillar of fire that was Moses wrote this Bible the same Pillar of Fire met Paul on the road to Damascus amen that see that same Heavenly messenger is revealing the word today now the scriptures tells us in Isaiah chapter 55 Amen in the 10th verse for as the rain cometh and the snow from heaven and returneth not tither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth food forth and Bud it may give seed to the so and bread to the eater so shall my wordl as the rain cometh so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it will not return unto me void God cannot come and return void his word cannot come and not have an effect up in the earth there is a purpose of this message coming there is a purpose of this word coming to this earth listen when Jesus when y y'all know the scriptures and and it was prophesied a virgin shall conceive Isaiah's words went out brother man said 700 years circling the earth looking for a womb finally Anchored In the Womb of that little woman Mary and when it Anchored In the Womb it took flesh and was birthed and lived upon the Earth for 30 something years and he stood there and said I have come from God and I returned to God how did he come from God he came from the lips of Isaiah Behold a virgin shall conceive and how could that word that had come from a prophet returned until it took the Flesh of the Messiah let me say this there shall be a bride in the latter days there will come upon the earth a bride with that's spto Rico I say Paul prophesied I say Jeremiah prophesied I say William Brandon prophesied but I'm looking at the Fulfillment of Prophecy tonight this word has come to take flesh and return back into Heavens can I say to you tonight the book has been opened the Lamb's Book of Life has been opened it's what you know is the message of the hour but God ain't coming back after a book Church God's coming back after for a bride a bride that has become the book in this generation thy words the precious unto me oh God Eternal is the substance of this church words that have been spoken over you not the fleshly mind of a man but the Eternal thought substance of almighty God has set upon you like the rain comes upon the Earth the word has come upon the church and brought a dynamite in their soul glory to God I feel like shouting a spell hallelujah hallelujah the word it cometh down but it will not return amen I love how he says in Deuteronomy 32 give ear oh ye Heavens I will speak here oh ye Earth the words of my mouth for my doctr shall drop as the rain and my speech shall distill as the Dew and smell rain upon the tender herb and showers upon the grass my I say Lord pour the doctrine on our churches I say like a showers on the grass Lord pour it out oh God Joel chapter 2 and verse 21 fear not oh ye land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things GL in the Book of Joel there's been some problems going on but a little turnaround happens right here and he begins to tell the church fear not I tell you that's a powerful statement fear not oh ye lands and I love how he says it's a command fear not don't let fear get you for the Lord will do great things be glad and rejoice listen I I can I say this if there wasn't another place in the Bible come on that said for you to be glad and rejoice I don't think we would need two places I don't think we would need four or five or six or8 10 different scriptures but if the Bible told me to fear not be glad and rejoice I believe that one scripture ought to be enough for me to tell that Old Devil of fear I don't want nothing to do with you my God commanded me to not let fear take it out of my heart but to be glad and rejoice and with expectation great things are coming upon the church isn't that beautiful tonight isn't it beautiful that I can prophesy good things to this bride I know we have no good prophecy for this world but to this bride great things is coming to you Church great things is going to happen in this church great things we got to expect great things Hallelujah come on expectations are built by the promise and if God made promise there ought to be expectation if God said there' be a perfect bride I'm expecting to be a part of a virtuous Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ if God said there'll be a body change I expect the change of my body if God said there would be Miracles Among Us where blinded eyes are going to open amen that lame will get up and walk amen if the prophet of God said that he'll begin to bring to pass the thought of my mind to reveal deity in humanity I expect it to take place I expect lims to be added back I expect eyes to be opened I expect Revival to strike lies because God said it I expect it I have an expectation brother Amos

God to tell this bride great things are coming people get upset at us preaching like this I know they do but if I was a devil I wouldn't like it either but you know what brother Bram said we're already glorified he said let the devil have every temper tantrum pit he wants to have he can't change [Music] it brother do you do you know that there was actually men of God in the days of Moses there were two mountains when they come into the promised land and mount garam amen was a mountain of blessing and he actually appointed men to stand on that mountain and to bless the children of Israel when they come in there were others appointed to stand there and curse the children of Israel when they come in but listen God never chose me to stand on a mountain of cursing to curse this church he put me on a mount of blessing he put me on Mount Calvary and through the Transfiguration showed me that God sent a message of glorification to his church in the last days now is my hour come father glorify thy name I shall glorify it and I will glorify it again and somebody thought it was just a thunder come on the Thunders glorified the name of Jesus Christ no wonder them Pentecostals don't know the name we're praying in when the Thunders revealed a new name it glorified not the god of History it glorified the message of the hour and today there's a tabernacle of the glory of God this word has a home this word has has a dwelling place right on the glory has returned to the temple amen amen what them Thunders have revealed in this age don't tell me that there's something for ancient days or they belong to some some some hypocrite preacher that changed it all up these Thunders were in the Bible before they made a false Doctrine out of them and you'll never keep me from

Hallelujah we are not serving a dead God we're serving the god of Solomon and Abraham and David my James 5: 7 and 8 watch this be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husband man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he receiveth the early and the latter Lane patience until the rain look at this be also patient and establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh now what is that husband man amen it actually interprets behold the judge stands at the door amen isn't that something at the door y'all know those scriptures right amen watch in Matthew 13:30 you've all heard brother bam type himself as one of the Reapers of the end time and he said let us therefore grow until the Harvest and in the time of the Harvest will I say to the Reapers gather first the tears and bind the bundles and burn them but gather the wheat into the barn patience patience until there's something that can separate the seed in the husk patience until the lter rain begins to fall and the rapturing faith will begin to divide the seeds come on church amen what is it the judges at the door the one that can tell the Eternal seed from the tassel and the hustle and in that day in Amos chapter 9 here you are brother Amos I'm in your book now in Amos 9 chapter of the 11th verse and the day will I raise up in the Tabernacle of David that is fallen and I'll close up the breaches thereof and I will raise up the ruins and I will build it as in the days of old God the Tabernacle of David's coming back y'all remember that Tabernacle they had a tabernacle of Moses but David moved moov the word from Moses's Tabernacle up into the city of David to be put under a tent in the middle of that he did it outside the will of God and a man died and it had to be put on pause for a while but at the end of that pause the Holy Spirit spoke to him and said David seal up the breaches which you have made and take the word down to the tent and then they begin the sacrifices and they begin to put are y'all with me the denominations come to a breach but then the prophet took the word on over amen and placed it in tents he put it in a tent you know what happened in that tent there was no more law they were outside of Pentecostal laws they were outside of Baptist Traditions you know what they did at that tent of David amen they worshiped and praised daily sacrifices were made not under Mosaic law but under davic worship where they raised their hands and shouted and danced and played instruments of all kind because the word was in the tent listen Len that wasn't about that day that was about a day when there would be a continual praise a sacrifice of praise that would come from the Tabernacles of David the tent of the Lord come on Church the tent Vision which Moses built represented a tent vision of the Bride of Jesus Christ and the word has been placed in the bride and the Shak glory is in there and she's shouting and dancing and lifting hands and playing instruments and it's not a Sunday worship and it's not a Wednesday worship amen but it's an everyday worship it's a worship of the Lamb the day when the breaches have been closed up and the word has returned to the Tabernacles of David the Bible said in that day they that possess the remnant of Edom and the children of the Heathen them which are called by thy name sayith the Lord behold the days come sayith the Lord I just love this that the plow man is going to overtake the Reaper and The Treader of grape him that Seth seed and the mountain shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall me and what the world we're talking about a season that when the planter and the reaper are be in the field at the same time I'm talking about a moment that when the latter rain and the former rain are dropping in the same season I'm talking about when the plant rain you put a seed in the ground and there's a former rain that Waters the planting and then there's a lighter rain that brings a harvest to the planting but there is a season coming and may I say is now that the planter and the reaper in the the same field at the same time amen we have taken the seed of this word and we are sewing it into heart and while the word is being sown there is a rain falling upon that seed and at the same moment there's a harvest rain do you recognize the spoken word in the season we're living brother B said it'll flash like Lightning prise God come on now you watch it amen amen back there brother Ronnie said something the other day and I I I don't remember exactly what he was talking about but I want to say this it's a little bit about Pentecost but I thought it was pretty powerful that the first Pentecost was 50 days from the time of the first fruits until Pentecost they moved from Egypt and they went to the Mount SII where the fire came down and rode on tables of stone right amen but then when Jesus amen prophesies amen of the outpouring to Pentecost they went into the upper room they waited 10 days brother B said they waited up there 10 days to get all the fussing and stewing and all the indifferences and get it all out amen it took them two days look how the timing increased yeah went from 40 days to 10 days but isn't it amazing that brother man said in this hour he said a man could receive the Holy Ghost while he's sitting in his Pew that you wouldn't even have to come to an altar but while the word of God is being preached it is a moment of an instant work of almighty God people can be healed in the preaching of the word under the third pool there could be total healing a praying and a watering and a reaping in the saint Serv in the same moment people can receive the Holy Ghost lives could be changed the power of God could be real I'm talking about God coming as the rain in this generation Hallelujah both farmer and latter praise the Lord if you look at it as a rain I know I'm I'm running out of time so I got to preach it but if you look at it as a rain let's take Elijah and remember when he prophesied on on Mount Carmel that there was going to come rain remember after he destroyed the prophets of baale he said I hear the sound of the abundance of rain and he went up on the mountain after prophesying after three and a half years rain's coming and he went up and sat on the mountain but he was wore out and tired right but he was expecting and you know what he did he said to his servant G he was tired he couldn't even get up and go look he said Gaza go over there and look toward the sea and tell me what you see and guy got up went over there and he said oh Lord Elijah I know you prophesied rain but they ain't a cloud in the sky I don't see nothing so he went back and told the story and I love I love Elijah's perseverance he knew it was the word of the Lord amen go look again and he sent that man back Seven Ages looking for that Revival That was supposed to be coming the Lord amen and when he got back there you know what he done that last time he circles back and he looks at Elijah and he said I see I seen something finally he said what was it that you saw he said I seen the cloud but it was just about the size of a man's hand can you imagine that's all he saw one little cloud in the sky the size of a man's hand and Elijah got into Revival Elijah saw he was coming as the rain he saw the first moving of rain was not just the prophecy of the word but now there was a cloud he had a physical sign in the sky what has happened up there is about to happen down here and he begin to cry out and he began to shout aloud amen oh god brother Bram said he got so carried away that old man outrun the Chariots down to jezrael come on preacher how how many miles was that it was 26 miles wasn't it my memory says me it's 26 if it's wrong y'all forgive me it was a long ways it's like a marathon down y especially tired wasn't it amen you see what he done he got out and he outrun
