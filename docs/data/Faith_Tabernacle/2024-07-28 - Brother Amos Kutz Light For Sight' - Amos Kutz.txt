service amen amen let's look to the Lord in prayer this morning Our Kind gracious Heavenly Father God we thank you Lord for Lord you're alive this morning there wasn't One Moment One Split Second during the night that you were not observant of your children like an eagle watches over her nest father God you watch over your little ones oh God and we thank you Lord for your Divine protection many times we don't understand the politics of the land we don't understand why things are the way they are but one thing for certain that if we walk in your perfect will no matter what happens out there ultimately at the end of the book it tells us we win and so God we're not on the losing side father God today but we're on The Winning Side we ask you would help us Lord this morning to as we open up the word and break the bread of life father that you can only you can break it I can't stand up here father God in my own intellect Lord as limited as I would be anyway father father God to try to bring forth the truth but dear God we ask for your Divine mind Lord to over over overpower our minds oh God May the eyes of our heart being enlightened oh God may you Enlighten all of our eyes this morning Lord no matter what level we may be at Lord may we just maybe we we received you received your Plan of Salvation but Lord there may be some others Lord who are matured father God in you and received the imparting of eternal life your precious life Lord the life of the blood within their life and soul dear God and there's been a transformation so I pray dear God that this word would be a blessing Lord father God to them as it was to me when I studied it Lord and may you give me the empowerment dear God I pray to bring it father father God we remember that again those who are sick we remember brother shemiah sister Bethany Lord little Shel father God we pray Lord that You' continue to give the little fellow strength in his body Lord give him nourishment oh God and Father God we ask you bless the nurses and doctors oh God that's caring for them and be with our brother and sister in this long long journey but father God it's for Life dear God and we thank you for the promise that you gave them and you will certainly keep that promise Lord to them and God we ask your blessing now over each and every heart now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's turn in our Bibles as we don't want to want to make sure that we utilize all of our time here this morning on the word as we possibly can I'd like you to turn with me to the book of uh Luke Luke's gospel and chapter 11 and verse 34 Luke 11:34 to 36 and then we'll be turning back to uh Zechariah 146 and 7 all right the Luke 11:34 Jesus says these words the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light as when the bright shining of a candle does give thee light when wait a minute I'm think I'm kind of getting ahead of myself there forgive me let's start over the light of the body is the eye therefore when thy eye is single thy whole body thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of Darkness take heed therefore that the light now listen to how he says this it's very peculiar take heed there for that the light which is in thee be not Darkness H almost sounds like a a paradox or something verse 36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light Zechariah 14 and 7 very familiar scripture to all of us I'm sure some of you can quote it without even having a turn there by memory it's it's interesting when we read this where this is found in the circumstances events that are to surround this uh I find that very peculiar that all scripture has a compound meaning and me many times more more than just a compound meeting it can go several different ways that's just that's just the word of God it's uh anyway Zechariah 14:6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light notice in the evening time when darkness is going to be setting in then there's going to be light doesn't say anything about Darkness it does say in the evening time it shall be light but notice no reference brother will is given to Darkness that's that's very good key point to remember amen you can be seated this morning I want to call this thought light for sight light for Sight let's let's talk about light and read a few scriptures those of you who want to follow along I'm going to move quite quickly through these scriptures so you'll have to really be with me if you want to turn in your Bible Psalm 18 and 28 Psalm 18 and 28 for thou wil light my candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness I'm going to read that again for the Lord will light my candle the Lord my God Amen thank you will Enlighten my darkness I appreciate that amen Psalms 112 and 4 Psalm 112 and 4 unto the upright there ariseth light notice how he says that the psalmist here unto the upright there ariseth so it just isn't just like turning on a light switch but it's a gradual like the sun rising up in the East over from The Horizon the light arises in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous now Isaiah 9 and2 Isaiah 9 and2 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light seen seen a great light I boy I could stop right there but I won't it it it's I've got other things to read they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them has the light shine I noticed they're living in the land of the shadow of death but it's not a land of total darkness because if you have a shadow of death that means there's some light there but notice in the middle of the shadow of death that's where light starts to shine well you say I thought light was already there that's true there was but now the light has begun to shine as Jesus will say here in the scriptures if we can get to it in its fullness so years ago sister Heather those of you who have been in biology classes in your school days remember there was a time when men could just look and he he all he had was uh he he had just his natural side he had maybe glasses whenever they come into existence magnifying glasses and so forth and light you know I need a pair of glasses for me to read up here now I could do a fairly good somewhat good but I might miss pronounce my words lose my place without my glasses I can I have trouble reading a newspaper but if I put that newspaper up under a lot of light I'm going to be able to read it so it tells you something now I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here because we do have a lot of ground to cover in a short period of time Isaiah 4 42 and 16 maybe I'll skip some of these uh uh scriptures I wrote down because I am just trying to bring this out to you a few laying a little bit of a foundation here Isaiah 42 and16 he says this and I will bring the Blind by way that they know not I will lead them in paths that they have not known I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them Hallelujah now John 3:19 John 3 and9 let's read what Jesus says about light he says in John 3:19 this is the condemnation that light is coming into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because they're Deeds were evil now everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved now notice everyone that doeth evil now they're already doing Evil by a light they see evil they hear evil they feel evil and whatever the other senses a taste I guess if you have a taste for alcohol or some other whatever and you're but you're introducing yourself to Darkness and you're a man that smokes a cigarette he's introducing death to himself he's introducing Darkness under which the devil who takes advantage of that he introduces harmful tars and nicotine that go into his lung cells and then the devil takes opportunity that and brings in cancer and ultimately unless he has got a body full of Darkness I'll read a few quotes here later what the prophet says about sickness cancer and all of that and it is actually Darkness he says let's read another scripture John 812 John 8 And1 12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life he shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life he says I am come a light I have come a light into the the world that whosoever believeth on me that's John 12:46 sorry John 12:46 I come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness period he he said believeth on me should not abide in darkness Bible says in so many places God is light amen let's see what else we got here now I I also well let's uh I've got a few more scriptures here I I want to uh I Ephesians 1:18 I believe that's the eyes of your understanding being enlightened now there's only one way that that can be brought about now in in in Bible days in the days of the Apostles some people could read and some people couldn't and so Paul when he was preaching to the Gentiles you got to remember the Gentiles don't know Hebrew so I don't know if Paul used an interpreter if God gave him the gift about me it's it's a thought I don't don't Bill not known it but don't know if God gave him a gift to tongues where he spoke it in Hebrew or Aramaic or whatever and they heard it in their own language I don't know but that gift was certain there somebody had that gift he may have used an interpreter I don't know but that's really not anything but you see they're seeing was really hearing because I don't know how many of you know this but many of these New Testament books did not come into existence for for quite some time until the church was already established these letters of Correction the Corinthians and Galatians and Ephesians did not were not accessible to the Believers until many years after the church had already been established so what did they have to go on some of them had copies of the text of the Old Testament the Torah what have you and but for the most part of it you had to take what the man was saying as gospel truth and go God confirmed that word with signs following with all 12 the apostles that's all they had to go on now you stop and think about that if you were a cyan from Central Asia from one of the lands of the way up in the lands of the north of Central Asia you didn't know the first thing maybe about Hebrew or maybe you did so what do you have to go on these men stumbling around like drunken men they were they were drunk in the Holy Ghost but they believed and they some of them carried that after they received the Holy Ghost carried that back to their own land without even having this New Testament in existence stop and think about that hearing was believing and God confirmed it supernaturally with signs following prise the Lord I never thought of that myself up until a few years ago when did that new testament actually come together it wasn't even known as a new testament as time went on people started putting it all together the cannon of scripture the different the gospels the writings of John and Peter and Paul the letters and so forth they finally begin to put that all together but that came a long time down the road and remember the Book of Revelation didn't come into existence till many many many years later we're talking about faith a revelation of Faith why there had to be a representation in that soul for them to believe something like that amen come on amen now the Jews had the writings the Jews and no doubt they went down to Corinth they went down to the Ephesus they went to all these places there was Jewish and many of the apostles were they were all Jewish and no doubt they could expound from the Hebrew but they could only give the Old Testament references to Jesus the prophecies and then they could only do it brother Terry by inspiration ation they didn't have bookstores and well where's the prophecies about Jesus I'm not making a mockery but they say where's the Prophecies of the him being beaten and his face was Mar as nor how did they even know that there was no books and theologians or anything like that but by inspiration of preachers who knew those Old Testament scriptures could bring them out said Why That's speaking of Christ what did they have to go on brother Terry they believe by faith that the the God was giv enlightening their eyes to the Old Testament scripture and through the preaching of Paul the Apostle he said If any man preach any other thing and you know what they were scattered so Paul wasn't the pope saying oh okay preacher come on up here and preach beside me before the people and I'm going to put a check mark that you're all right well Paul said If any man preach any other gospel let him be a cursed but Paul didn't go around trying to put his seal of approval on everybody's Ministry he said you got to belong to me I'm the founder of this thing nope he didn't go around telling Matthew Mark Luke or John he didn't go around trying to tell Bartholomew Thomas or any of the rest of them who had their own Ministries but there's one thing about it men of many many different backgrounds Jewish backgrounds go out to all these different places and they're preaching to same thing some of them might not given this slant you see it in the four gospels they say different things about Jesus and don't confuse me they're giving it from their standpoint every one of them 12 go out wherever their Ministry took them some Thomas goes to India Persia wherever rest of them go I Lord I don't know where they went they all had their Ministry but there's one thing for certain when Paul and Peter met they found out they were preaching the C same thing now they had their differences of the circumcision and all of that and little things petty little things that was going to happen and God knew that was going to happen to start with now I'm going to stop right there cuz I need to move into some more stuff let's see I want to read second Peter 1 and9 if you can pull that up and of course Revelation 3:18 most of us could quote that one second Peter 1:9 and then we're going to we're going to move into something a little bit different I wrote I wrote unto the church let's see that's not exactly okay second peter9 I'm sorry second Peter 1 and9 I give you a chance to get that up there I really appreciate them doing that that that takes skill you could hit the wrong key and all of that very easily done I can imagine I try to do that I'd probably be be in Webster's Dictionary somewhere second Peter 1:9 but he that lacketh these things is blind but notice how Peter goes on to say this and cannot see a far of and hath forgotten that he was purched from his old sins now what is Peter saying here was this man totally Stone blind no he was blind in the fact that he could not see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins now this is what we're going to be focusing on how did he get into that state light for sight definition of sight what is the full meaning of sight I pulled this I believe it's from Webster something that is seen the process power or function of the the function of the five basic physical senses by which light stimuli received by the eye and constructed into a representation of the position shape and brightness of objects in space that sounds a little scientific for some of us let's break that down a light stimuli received by and constructed into a representation of the position shape and brightness of the eye of objects in space for some reason when I printed this it cut some of that off I had some trouble this morning with my printer but it is being able to with light is a stimuli that's the thing that provokes sight that encourages sight that causes sight to happen you got to have light or you're not going to see you have all the eyes in the world all the telescopes you want or most powerful microscope in the world but if you don't have light it will will absolutely not not work I wondered about that I wondered about that brother will I've been I've been meditating on a lot of things on that in relation to Zechariah 14:7 I've got this laying here and I want to go ahead and read it as quick as I can I'm not sure what sermon I took this from but it was either 54 or 55 I didn't get the uh Dayton sermon title uh printed off with it excuse me through this time did you ever see a day that was dark and drizzle dismal like day that's the day that we've lived it through well they got enough light that they can see that Jesus was the Christ he ought to accept him as Savior but all of his great powers and things that's been h hit from them they can't see it all through the day are y'all following me is somebody going to preach with me this morning we just going to sit here like a bump on a pickle that's the words of the Prophet you want to sit here like a bump on a pickle you belong in a jar with pickle juice I like eating them but don't we don't want to turn into them and I don't want to eat you up he said well we've but all of his great Powers they all through the day they said the days of Miracles has passed all them things they had on the Pentecost ceas that's where the Sun was shining back there in the East notice how he said that that's he said that was past tense he's he's simply stating what they say 55 paragraph 55 but geographically speaking watch the son has done cross over now in in other words over the uh 12:00 knob so to speak the 12:00 point on the clock is crossed over by human theology Church organization denomination it's darkened these things from the Christian's eyes darkened not not extinguished not completely invisible but darkened that's why Pentecostals today Baptists and so forth certain Baptists certain other denominations will stay away from Ephesians chapter one exactly what the devil wants and they fail to recognize it their eyes are blinded by the devil who is good at causing Confusion by the way now it's darken these things from the Christian ey that's right it's darkened Divine Healing notice how I said that darken it why some of us said been around a long time you've had grandparents grandparents been back in Pentecost for years and and you know uh you know some folks hey I'm new to this thing too so I'm not above you I'm right with you but some of our grandparents and I I speak of brother Monro really over here at Short C he told me this and I can believe it cuz he told me he he got he was a Pentecostal for many many years before he come to the message and back in 19 and 50 some he ran into a man I think it was either 50 or 60 in in the Baltimore area who had been under the isua Street Ministry and had been a partaker of the Gospel at that time now many people today there aren't that many people living anymore that you know has brother gy is for one he's up in years that's still living that know about these things but long before brother bram's Ministry really started FF Bosworth was holding healing campaigns in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the 1930s now I'm saying that because these things were still going on but it was darkened to the denominational and they rejected that asusa street Minister I remember Brother Louis BV telling me because the revelation of the water baptism in Jesus Christ's name came to the isua street people from a man in K called mallister and that brother got a revelation of the water baptism that if the scriptures seem to indicate and teach that why aren't we doing it well to make a long story short that was preached and many people went under the water the second second time that was under the isua Street Ministry and got re-baptized renouncing the Trinity and that created quite a stir and that's where many the Pentecostals back in the day in 19 in the 19s you had the formation of the Assembly of God Church and the formation of the apostolic Oneness Jesus name and they parted ways some of the Assembly of God when they heard about water baptism went and got re-baptized in Jesus Christ's name become part of the apostolic movement others held back didn't realize they're putting the brakes on God see what I'm talking about so most people today you talk about FF POS words well first of all I I never heard of it never heard he had a Healing Ministry but no doubt in Pittsburgh I don't know if any every body still be living I'd say there's probably a few that yeah my grandfather was in those meetings and they're probably won advance in years but because of the darkness that set in even after the isua Street Ministry that's why men like Charles price on the Pentecostal Ministry who's he I don't know who he is why because a Church of God Assembly of God they rejected these men they put the quietus on it so to speak as brother Bob would say they threw a wet blanket on it they're scared of it that's why because their deeds of unbelief were evil the Foolish Heart was dark and they couldn't see a fire off that's why when brother random came even in early 50s preaching things on predestination in Florida people Church of God man Pentecostal Church of God man Pentecostal Holiness whoa he was bald as a lion yet he was a very accommodating man in his ministry he reaches out trinitarian Oneness tries to pull them together amen matter of fact one of the great things of brother R's Ministry was the fact that Gordon linday who was trinitarian I believe in the Assembly of God man and uh what was his name down in sh Port yeah Jack Moore was a died in the wool Oneness baptized in Jesus Christ name preacher but you know what brother Brown's Ministry brought two people together now I understand and they were actually somewhat acquainted with each other before brother brandom even came on the scene but there was one thing that cemented their relationship and friendship with one another despite the fact one trinitarian one Apostolic was brother R's Ministry you can read it it's there go back and read those books again amen he says it darkened the Divine Healing it's darkened the power of God it darkened all gifts they applied it back there where the Sun was shining they applied it back there and what did it do it caused clouds of unbelief to roll in the sun was still shining now God knew this was all going to come I think many times we got to be careful how we preach these things we we almost make it look that the Church of thy Tyra and the Church of all these the seven Church ages you know the Middle Ages there the middle Church ages that irus Columba that there was much going on there but I beg to differ with you guess what in the middle of that pyramid like City that's going to come down out of Heaven there's going to be one level designated for the thyroid thyroid Church age Believers history doesn't say a whole lot about him the reason being said is just what I told you before the current wave of that time was to smother the news of spiritual events yes they happened but the Catholic church was right there to stifle IE any news and they kill it dead in its tracks if they could and they did and they burnt people at the state and that made more headlines when they were burning people at the Stak it was a big show of forest just like the death does today create a big show of force yet God is over here miraculously many and women are serving God living Godly lives seeing the hand of Miracles move and the church stifled that they didn't want that get out but they couldn't stop God now that was part there the plan of God it's going to be a lot of palaces on the level of that pyramid for the th retiring Church age cuz they were there but we think oh it's such a dark time oh politically religiously morally it was but there was light in Goan it was light to that th entire church AE believer I'll show it I I already showed it to you that's why he that's why that Preacher Brother Louie was telling me he come in there preaching baptism in Jesus Christ's name and they shot up down in Tennessee I don't know what year that was brother Terry but Brother Lou told me that they killed that man shot into the church where he was at and killed him cuz he believed in a water baptism in Jesus Christ name he was preaching think of that do you see now how Darkness likes to try to smother these things now brother Bram goes on to say here it is but the prophet it's darkened all the giftes they have applied it back there where the Sun was shining here is but the prophet said it shall be light in the evening time the sun rises in the East it sets in the west we are the Western People Western Hemisphere we're here in the west and as it Rose over y in the beginning was showed that the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost and the things accompanied in the church there very things happened back there in the last days in the last 20 or 30 years has fell here in the Western World showing the same signs here that it get back there it'll be light in the evening time by the way I'll just stop right there by the way you know FF Bosworth had both of his wrists broken for preaching Divine Healing down in Texas was that Christian that's a force of Darkness to stifle even a man who was preaching Divine Healing back in the early early years of the 19th century just thought of that done alone showing a s it'll be light in the evening time the clouds broke back denominations are broke he says hallelujah and the people has entered into the baptism of the holy spirit with signs and wonders just like they did at the beginning it'll be light in the evening time now I hope you all don't mind if you do shut your ears Zechariah 146 and 7 I wondered about this for a long time I wondered about this where did that come from where did the thought brother brand mentions this back in Way Way Back in 1949 by the way first time he ever mentioned it and it's he mentions it about 170 some times plus plus or minus probably plus more times throughout the message when I was growing up before I God enlightened me to the message used to listen to an Apostolic preacher dad turn him on every Sunday morning I don't know why he turned them on if he didn't want to go there and they started off the radio program with that old song it shall be light in the evening time way to you know your black choir singing you can imagine boy they know how to sing it the way to Glory you will surely find in the Waterway is the light today baptized in Jesus name young and old on and on every Sunday morning they started broadcast like that for one hour Bishop es mile Shelton used to be Bishop SCC Johnson in Philadelphia Pennsylvania who started that movement so uh you know this come into play later on thought now thought where who where I mean I ask you consider come on brothers and sisters preach with me if you don't understand something I I'll say okay you don't I don't have to ask you to say Amen but he's talking about near the end of the tribulation period in Zachariah if you study that Jerusalem is going to be taken the hous is rifled and the women ravished you know I read that here brother Terry and I thought oh Lord Jesus I I don't want to see that happen Israel's been through so much but the last he said then he said they'll flee over into the valley of azil and there's going to be Jesus will return his feet shall sand on the Mount of Olives one part of the mountain move off this way in another part of the mountain and he said they're going to flee like there's going to be survivors he said they're going to carry some off into captivity they're going to kill people they're going to do all these terrible terrible things to people but he said there's going to be a Remnant he said you'll run like you did in the days of Uzziah the king of the earthquake over into the land or the valley of AEL for safety and then it says then the Lord God will go to fight against those Nations who have come against Jerusalem and there while they stand on their feet their flesh will consume away now going back to Zechariah 14:6 let's just stop with that it's interesting he deposited that thought and no doubt that will mean something to the Jews at that time no doubt in the coming days where those two ministries of the prophets they're going to read that and apply that to their day it really weak I kind of expected that well I stand to be corrected if I'm wrong but somebody picked up the inspiration this also applies to this day of the Gentiles we to read Benson's commentary Zechariah 14 and6 and 7 listen how he words this this is a man who don't even believe I don't know I don't know when this was written I I take this back long time ago he says this it shall come to pass in that day namely when the Lord shall come forth to fight against the enemies of his church the Nations that fought against Jerusalem as foretold Zechariah 14:3 or in that day when he shall come to convert and restore the Jews has spread his gospel throughout all the world now some of this this man needs prophetic correction what he wrote Because I don't quite agree with all of this and restore the Jews spread his gospel throughout all the world the light namely of knowledge Holiness happiness in his church shall not namely at first be clear like that of the perfect day nor dark as perfect night but shall be kind of a Twilight a mixture of light and darkness of knowledge and ignorance as of as to Divine things of Hol Holiness and sin of happiness and misery or prosperity and adversity but it shall be one day one continued day there shall be no setting of the sun to make it quite night but God will invariably pursue the end that he has in View and always act in order to it namely the full salvation of a spiritual Jerusalem remember that we Are Spiritual Jerusalem which shall be the events of it he will continually take notice of them and Order and dispose of all the dispose of all for the best according to the counsel of his own will goes on to say when the natural Days end and when perhaps the shades of the evening may appear to be coming on there may be an apprehension of returning Darkness listen if it shall be light this spiritual day shall be full of light and Glory he quotes Isaiah 488 Isaiah 161 19- 21 Mr Scott considers these verses as containing a compendious prophecy of the state of the church from its establishment in the apostles days to those glorious times which are expected a prophecy foretelling for a long season the light would neither be clear nor dark it would be greatly obscured listen we all know what that means by ignorance heresy Superstition idolatry yet not holy exting which side are you living on and the consolation wait a minute my printer was acting up this morning printed fine print on me and I don't know what happened yet not wholly extinguished and the state of the church would be much deformed where did I hear that one before Satan is a deformer deformed by sin and calamities yet some Holiness yet some Holiness and consolation would be found this period could neither be called a clear Bright Day cheered and illumined by The Shining of a summer Sun nor would it be dark as if the sun were set or totally eclipsed but would contain a great mixture of Truth and error listen to that of Holiness and sin of happiness and misery yet it would form one day and never be interrupted by a night of total darkness it would also be known unto the Lord as a degree of it light and the term of its continuance and he would watch over and take care of he's causing people all the time of it he's saying it better than I could say it but his people would hardly know whether to call it day or night or a compound of both yet at length toward the evening of the world the son of righteousness would break forth and shine with unclouded Splendor it has arrived to those of you who had your eyes open and being enlightened by the Holy Ghost the evening time is making history now just unclouded splendor dispelling the Gloom brother ter of ignorance heresy idolatry Superstition Illuminating the church and the Earth with knowledge righteousness peace and consolation let the devil pull all the night shades he wants let the devil turn off all the lights he wants there is a man here who has already turned on the light right the devil might have trying to turn the light off on us but God's turning the light back on again why ain't the rest of the world in light because their deeds are evil they ain't like a cloudy day you don't like a cloudy day I don't like a cloudy day but they like it because it's a preparation of for total darkness the tribulation period and ultimately sadly the regions the damed Putin's patience is going to run out one of these days I had I'm going to stop right here and say something I'm going to move on but I had a little bit of respect for for France I think you know where I'm going with that I always think the majority of the people they don't want that trash but to think of it the way they portrayed that Lord's Supper father I hate to say it those poor souls are lost they are groping in darkness and the people that are all that are just as guilty he's got he's got a bomb a missile Warhead with their name on it you wonder why brother R said that I'll tell you why in World War II they write things on those bombs the the pilots and so forth of those planes this one's for Berlin this one's for Hitler this one's for the SS this that's where this thought comes he's got a bomb with your name on at Louisville I hardly think at the end of all of that there's even going to be a rush here because it's going to be a suicidal move on their part and that man out there in the law Salos told me some years ago he said yeah he said I believe what brother R said they're going to throw it at us and he said we'll be a sming pile of debris but he said I can assure you there's going to be a lot of stuff go back it's not going to be a win-win situ it's not going to be a win and loser situation it's going to mean an Annihilation it'll be done out of spite and out of hate it'll be done out of anger and devil anointing and fulfilling the prophecy of the word of the Lord the Earth won't be a fit Place once that happens that's the end that's setting up for the Millennium the Earth ruptures volcanic activity Colorado is sitting on a time bomb out there right now with volcanic they say that thing could blow and when it does it's going to affect the entire Continental North America that volcano it'll be an explosion unlike these bombs can loosen that crust up and penetrate on down there there's coming stuff that's a 100 times stronger than what was dropped on Nagasaki well I just had to say that I kill some of my time sorry the song I wrote to you here on Benson's commentary and know that there's others there's others that's not just there's others and that was that was wrote many Benson did his commentary and the rest of them did their commentary many many years ago some back in the 1800s by the way throw that out there too well anyway it means something to me that's right it it sure does I do want to mention this the song where did the song come from to my knowledge I don't we don't know who the writer who pinned the words we do know according to history Man by the name of GT Haywood I I know he lived out of our time frame one of the early Pentecostals among the African African Brothers and sisters of black people man by the name of GT Haywood was preaching Apostolic Oneness Doctrine Pentecostal to his church down y Tennessee I believe it was some sister got the inspiration and I I would say venture to say it was probably from him preaching Zechariah 14:6 and 7 and that sister penda words I don't know if you knew this but that sister penda those words and the verses to it you don't know the name she was a member of his congregation that's all we know GT Haywood you can look you can research GT Haywood man of God man of God by the way I'll just stop and say this because we don't give no credit many times because we get to thinking that the bride age is the only people in that that's going to be living in there in that level of the new city you got it all wrong there's going to be penic Apostles from isua Street FF pawor from the 1930s and all these other ministers are going to be living in that new city because there were the part of the pride of the leot dean Church whether you want to believe that or not we don't often mention that we get too narrow minded and ttle minded the first thing you know we convey the wrong thought to people they weren't all false anointed ones many Believers God saw to it that there was Believers that's why I said th TI Church AG there were Believers there it's really tell you God help us yeah there'll be Believers there brother Brown said there's even going to be people there I don't know where they're going to come up that he led to the Lord Jesus but they never accepted this message as far as I know I've been trying to friend Bert Call's obituary way up yonder in New England and still looking forward I think I may have stumble on where where he passed away but brother Bram said he got saved out there on a snow bank become a Baptist in a I believe it was a deacon or something in a bapti church if I'm not don't have that right but that's what he said now he got saved hello he's probably one of them John 3:16 people hello aren't you glad aren't you glad I am that's why I say when we get over there you're going to be surprised you're going to see out there in that new new Earth you're going to be surprised who you see out there that Paul said watched out for you and stood for you when it looked like the tables were turned against you he'll be there that woman in the neighborhood that looked after you when you didn't have a penny to your name and and gave you Grace on your rent payments and all of that and she was good to you very good chance she'll be there aren't you glad aren't you glad and brother randam said your name will be associated with them throughout eternity you're the expression of God that's the only expression that they'll ever see sister Alice the god knew God knew this was going to happen God it didn't take God by surprise that after ireneus the Martin there was going to come a grade falling away he knew it all along that didn't just helpen per se God lost control of his program he never lost control of his program God knew it was going to go that way that's why in the beginning God knew that he was going to eat the apple just saying it met metaphorically he knew that all along he let it happen to prove he's a savior except the corn of weat wide brother randam say they were fed to the lies they were thrown into their Arenas Savage beasts store them from limb to limb and they become dung on the face of the Earth as being consumed by the Beast why except the corn of wheat fall brother Ram said in a b of theone he knew it was going to happen and it was BL that way I don't feel sorry for Joon of Arc I don't I don't feel sorry for all these other people got burned at the steak see that sounds cruel humanly speaking if IID lived in yeah but with the mind of God I feel sorry for the people that did it for to them I feel sorry for the Pope the popes who ordered their Annihilation the Pope that ordered the Inquisition in Spain that killed Christians and Jews in the Aaron Maiden Woman made of spikes and in the darkness the person walked into it it was spring-loaded they didn't know until it was too late those spikes come together and that thing collapsed like a spring and literally penetrated and killed the person that walked into it called the Aaron Maiden Church devil Church Darkness but God H his people God knew it all along didn't take him by surprise didn't take God surprise they put Isaiah in a log and sought him into too that was awful I mean that was aw you look at the sister Heather look at the book of Isaiah you all know the prophecies that Isaiah pinned what a gracious man his noble character and I I feel bad I can't imagine a rough and those saws aren't fine cutting saws like they today as it literally ripped his bowels out of his body and he's bleed massive bleeding until the life finally leaves his body and it it literally cut him in half I feel sorry for the ones that did it if they never repented they're the ones I feel sorry for I'm running out of time but I'll say this too brother Ram said unless you have perfect love you'll never get there and unless you feel sorry for Adolf Hitler in the regions of the Damned and feel badly for him you're not a candidate to enter the presence of the Lord over there in heaven or walk on streets of gold because you've got to have character of gold to walk on streets of gold buy a meat what did he say and Le see gold as of tried in the fire he rebuked them he said you're blind naked miserable you have many riches but your riches you allow your love your riches more than you love me and that's why you're blind that's why pastors won't receive this message in the denomination they know it's true but it's going to cost them their riches cost them their pension their retirement pension all those years of studying in school they think go down the drain well well well praise God where are we brother Bram says in the message Redemption by power I thought I brought my phone up here I need a clock I really do anyway so many just wave when I get I want to read 1954 brother Brown says Redemption by power all right put on your shock proof jackets here it comes look every man that rejects light goes blind and walks in darkness because you don't accept light did you hear how he said that yeah look every man that rejects light goes blind so he's got sight and then he goes blind because he rejects it what did what did Brother say the light that you have will be taken from you says put on your shockproof jackets here it comes those who rejected light receive Darkness now I'm only about halfway through here I've got a lot more but I'm going to have to find a place to helicopter out of here as brother juel used to say I was going to mention this the the vision of sight the sense of sight sister Faith you raise uh dogs and puppies and so forth like that so you're you're you're very familiar with these things when the puppies are born what I remember correct me if I'm wrong I'll give you that permission sister just say it no no no no no they can't see they got their eyes closed is't that right okay so brother Bram I like what brother Shawn was preaching here the other night and he brother brandom I've got quotes up here and I'll not get to him because we were running out of time but he said for the last 2,000 years well I'm paraphrasing that but for the last he said we probed at these things and sometimes got everything confused and then he says in one other quote he says we actually did pretty good and I I've got I've got an explanation for both of those statements I'm not trying to explain the prophet but I want to break that down to you now Jesus said Moses gave you a writing a divorcement h but because of the hardness of your heart he done that but from the beginning it was not so now sister Faith you know and the rest of all of you pet owners have mothers uh I love puppies my goodness some of them German shepherd pups you that one was already promised I had it was hard for me to offer her up some big money that thing was so cute oh don't your heart melt those of you who like pets you my heart melts I remember picking up little puppies back at the farm years ago and the mother anxiously sometimes she let out a growl because she wasn't sure what you were going to do with them oh my it just melt my heart she's there checking them all out mother's love and so anyway uh they're born they can't see they're born with their eyes closed so they're probing so that little mama mother dog or cat or whatever well cats I think are born blind too I think they're they can't see if I'm not mistaken I think that's right I may be wrong but anyway puppies they the mother will lay herself out to where they find the glands the nipples of the glands on the teeths where she's got mother's milk and they by Instinct it's in them it's part of their genetics they can't see but they start probing something deep down there's a deep resonating to the Deep to find the teachs and nurse but they don't see but they probe they probe they might run into hair they might ran into feet might even run into a tail might run into each other but ultimately they all find I like what brother randam said he's Jehovah uh the double breasted one you're nursing I thank God for those stages it was all part of our Christian walk I thank God for the early ages when all they could do was probe but God saw to it there is light there for you and I'll help you get there and they got there no matter how dark it got there was still light and God saw to it said see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you're not going to take all the light away but I'll prove that I'll get brother will every one of my children God didn't miss a one in the th tiing age not a one didn't matter how many you know I could tell you stories but I won't go into that you read their history there's Histories on all of that how they stood in different places now I wondered about something for years down in the caves of the earth total pitch black darkness cats I got a bunch of them God has enabled a cat plus other animals owls Birds who are creatures of the night nothing against that brother random types that spiritual wicked things evil things C crawl around prowl around at night crawl around at night to bite people spiders and so forth demons typing demons hello notice the environment that they like to Carl around and do you got that kind of environment in your mind that's why demons feel so welcome to come into some of our minds because we got so much darkness in our minds wooo so if your eye is single as Jesus said you go might have a double eye you're taking all you but I like I like to walk in a nons surrendered State before the Lord guess what you're letting a lot of darkness in and I can prove to you that you're looking at Darkness you say looking at Darkness yes because all those things that take us away from God's word lead us to total darkness and will'll cause you to go blind so down in these M shafts mind's caves can catch sea study notice what I said from the beginning it takes light for the eye to operate it takes light the seven Church ages it was a valley of the shadow of death now but there was still light there but where there is total darkness outer Darkness think of it that way kid a cat an animal now typing natural to back to the spiritual can a cat see in a pitch black cave well I thought maybe they could too the answer is no uh cut the stars of the night natural lighting the stars of the night the moon of the night illuminate there's enough a light that when a cat looks out there what they probably see just to give you some idea is like a cloudy day for us what they see at night now is it 100% what they see during the day no but it's very very good that's why Jaguars tigers lions hunt at night their their Vision it's just like a cloudy day they're putting it that way to you that's how they find their prey ows they oh my they got a l whoa that's why they can do what they do at night I'm saying this so what happened to the little fish you children in the animal kingdom what happened to the little fish that got trapped down there in that cave in that Lake of water that pool of water that stream of water and there's no light from the beginning he had eyes and he still has eyes but he went blind from the beginning it was not so if there's an eye then an eye is there to see now God through his Mercy I could say a whole lot more about the human body there's some things that changed I think we didn't have to deal with before the fall I won't get into that somebody might get the wrong idea but I can tell you this that little fish Lost His sight and the cat can't see in the dark that's why he's got whiskers you know that don't ever cut him that's a keep him from going into a hole that he can't get out of he can really wriggle wriggle in swiggle to get in a tight spot get it I've seen them crawl out of stuff my Lord they like their bodies turn turns into water and they come out the other side it's like one of them things they'll make a way they'll find a way and make it they get scared boy I tell you one to who they're fast anyway he had sight it one time but because of total darkness and Paul brings this out why you let your your feeble hands hang down he said you need to raise them up exercise exercise Your Eyes by looking at the gospel of light in the evening time the light has come don't let this world become your focus even of your natural eye but read and listen goes for for me too listen because the darkness of this night will take you away from the light and it will produce a life of Darkness thy eye being single means your whole body will be full of light if you look at good things you'll have good things in your body if you look at bad things you're going to have your body full of Darkness period same is true of the spiritual eye right here what do we have here they're not artificial right those are real plants right guess what this light that light that light that light is not sufficient because that's a cloudy day temporarily it'll preserve that but not forever it'll die that's why you all still put them lights over these things right what is it ultraviolent light and they need ultravid which replicates the sunshine so you don't have to set them out there on the POR you can put an UltraViolet artificial ultraviolet light over it and they just ooo but without it Devil's lie is I'll separate you from the Sun but not all at one time I'll gradually choke you down by not letting you get any sunlight at all let's stand thank you for being attentive this morning I know it was a little bit long I had to find a place to quit I had to bring that in there I don't know if I'll maybe in the future I'll have a time I think I started something I think I started a subject I can't quit for a while kind of like the book it was a blessing to me I don't know about you but I'm not bragging on myself I'm just bragging on the Lord I have never I spoke at brother Paul Griffin's church here here two weeks ago or so on this same topic that subject had struck me I don't know where I was I was sitting up here in the front row somebody was preaching or I was somewhere and a thought come to me about the light this scripture has has been a little bit of a flooring scripture to me I was I have to confess some of you Brothers like brother josi there and brother Daniel and brother Shawn I I stumbled over that SC I thought that's a head scratcher it's just a matter of going in and studying it uh and even looking at some material that well let's just save that to really find out what he's talking about because the English language is it doesn't give you a very good description of what the scriptures were originally wrote in so I had to do a little bit of research and I just thank the Lord i' I've had scriptures like this that have suddenly come into my life it's not that hey don't get me wrong I don't want to make no excuse for ignorance don't want to make no IGN excuse for being lazy but sometimes there's been scriptures I just thought unless the Lord opens my eyes on that one I'm I can't really preach on that cuz I don't know I I don't know the answer you know what that's become a milestone to me a mile marker now and it and it's still unfolding and no doubt somebody else is going to preach on it and bring out even more and more more and more from it I would have liked to got into the message excuse me to show you the evening light has come I've got quotes scripture brother BR said breach foreal about the probing now the light has come brother brand there's always one quote that I I as I'm shutting it down I I don't think I can pull it up here to read it I don't got time but he said the light of the hour is the word made flesh when you see it you can't be looking back to 1965 you got to see the word made flesh right now right now is a product of 1965 what Jesus Christ the revealing of the word the opening of the word today I am the product of the opening of the word am I looking at products of the opening of the word tell me are you a product I don't like to say

is brother Terry correct me if I'm wrong Jesus Christ was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks what does that mean Jesus Christ was in every single age previous age to this one we've now gone into the bright age the last part of the lean Church age the bright age but Jesus Christ was in every one of them those Believers of those Martin's age ireneaus age all the ones in between they could all sing that same song God recognized their faith in the light they reive for their day and they're going to be it's not just going to be this age come up in the resurrection there's going to be Believers and catacombs the dust bones that turned to dust the dong of the Lions hey it don't have to be the very very same ones God could replicate one celling [Music] molecule people have fussed
