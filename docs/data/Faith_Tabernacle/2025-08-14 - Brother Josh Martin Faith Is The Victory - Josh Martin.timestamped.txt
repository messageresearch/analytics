[35:14] and true. Won't forget his own. Do you
[35:18] believe that?
[35:20] Oh, you're your companion.
[35:24] Oh, your best friend, the only true God.
[35:28] There's no one greater, a wonderful
[35:32] savior
[35:34] is Jesus, the lion of Judah. Sing it
[35:38] from your heart with
[35:42] us. It never faileth. He'll go through
[35:45] the fire just to save a sinner. Yes,
[35:49] he's almighty. He sends his angels
[35:55] to guide me.
[35:57] [Music]
[35:58] There's no storm too powerful. Our God
[36:02] cannot handle. Our God in simplicity
[36:06] revealed in you and me came down from
[36:09] his glory to give us the victory. The
[36:13] greatest love story.
[36:17] Well, can you give the Lord a hand clap
[36:19] of praise?
[36:21] Hallelujah. Do you believe he's
[36:23] tremendous?
[36:25] He's glorious. Praise the Lord. Well, I
[36:29] I don't think there's just I don't
[36:31] believe there's anything greater to
[36:33] serve. Amen. Than our God Almighty.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people serving many other
[36:41] things and uh you know, and they end up
[36:44] disappointed and they'll continue to be
[36:47] disappointed. Amen. But God has never
[36:50] forsaken us. There ain't no believer
[36:52] ever disappointed in God. Amen. For he
[36:56] is truly faithful. Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you can be seated for just
[37:01] a moment. Amen. certainly love the Lord
[37:04] and want to say it's uh uh good to have

[37:29] anyone uh to go and listen to them uh uh
[37:33] services, all four of them, brother uh
[37:36] Andrew Glover and brother Josh Bennett,
[37:38] they just outdone themselves and uh God
[37:41] used them in a mighty way and um uh you
[37:45] know heard of deliverances uh there
[37:47] Saturday night and there was some major
[37:50] deliverances that took place and um uh
[37:55] there's this you know and I guess you
[37:58] know it's there's something going around
[38:00] you know among
[38:02] just u young uh women. Um and I guess
[38:07] it' be all right to say it online, but
[38:09] the doctor does telling Jonathan it's
[38:12] it's just happening everywhere. And uh
[38:15] but uh where they just um uh they're
[38:19] passing out, they're figning, they they
[38:21] they uh losing strength. Um it's like
[38:25] going into a seizure and and um uh every
[38:29] doctors are just perplexed and it's been
[38:31] hitting some of the the girls in the
[38:33] message and uh they're just passing out
[38:36] just you know and uh can't get up to
[38:40] continue on through the day and just um
[38:44] you know and and uh it's just a real
[38:47] strange thing. we know what it is, but
[38:50] uh several were delivered Saturday night
[38:54] in that prayer meeting prayer line. And
[38:57] we just really thank the Lord for that.
[39:00] And I tell you, we've got victory over
[39:02] that devil. And no matter what what
[39:06] takes place, no matter what happens, we
[39:09] have got the victory. And I'm I'm just
[39:12] really thrilled uh to see what God done
[39:16] in the meeting. And um it's uh good to
[39:20] have brother Bill back with us. Amen.
[39:22] and been sick and and uh in his body and
[39:27] so uh several of the elders and just
[39:30] really good to have each of our elders

[39:38] to have brother Amos back and I've heard
[39:40] the the services were just tremendous uh
[39:44] uh in the the meetings that he had
[39:46] ministered and so we're we're just
[39:48] really thankful for what God is doing. I
[39:51] believe that God is alive and well and
[39:54] he is moving among his people.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have nothing to be discouraged
[39:59] about, nothing to be worried about,
[40:01] nothing to be afraid about. Amen. God is
[40:04] truly moving. Amen. And um and so and
[40:08] Sister Brooke um I saw her earlier, but
[40:12] uh good to have her back with Felicity
[40:15] and the baby doing doing a lot better.
[40:18] So, we thank the Lord for that. I wanted
[40:21] to read a quote before we have brother
[40:22] Josh out. But um uh brother Brandham,
[40:26] he's talking about uh when Eleazar had
[40:30] come to get uh Rebecca and and he says,
[40:34] "And Rebecca, which was to be the mother
[40:37] of this noted, promised wanted son
[40:41] uh talking of Isaac there. when she was
[40:44] called to that final test of a strange
[40:47] man that she had never seen before. Only
[40:50] she seen the working of the Holy Spirit.
[40:53] And when her parents could not fully
[40:55] decide whether she should go with this
[40:58] stranger or not to be the wife of a man
[41:01] she had never seen, she was brought to
[41:04] the final test. And they said, "We'll
[41:07] get the damsel and let her speak. We'll
[41:10] hear from her mouth whether she will go
[41:13] yes or no. Right. Amen. Wanted her to
[41:16] speak. It was time for her to speak
[41:19] &gt;&gt; and make her decision. Right.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And and he says that's the way it's
[41:25] brought to all the seed of God. It's got
[41:28] to be your mouth.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Everybody say it's got to be my mouth.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; God wants to hear from you. And so when
[41:36] she was put to the test, she never
[41:38] hesitated a minute. She said, "I will
[41:41] go."
[41:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I like that." Not, "Well,
[41:45] let me make up my mind. Let me study it
[41:47] over." She was fully persuaded. That's
[41:51] the people that God can use. When you're
[41:53] fully persuaded that God will keep his
[41:56] promise, and she said, "I'll go." Ain't
[41:59] that right? Amen. And so, how many's
[42:02] fully persuaded that God is going to
[42:05] keep his promise? Now, we're not just
[42:07] saying we're going in a rapture. We are
[42:10] fully persuaded.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Fully persuaded that God will take care
[42:15] of us, that God will provide for us. I'm
[42:18] per I'm I'm just fully persuaded that
[42:20] God will will heal our bodies.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; How many's fully persuaded of that? I
[42:25] I'm fully persuaded that God will answer
[42:28] our prayer. I'm fully persuaded that
[42:30] God's going to save your children.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; He's going to save my children. Can you
[42:35] say amen? I'm fully persuaded that I'm
[42:37] going in a body change. I'm fully
[42:40] persuaded. I said I'll go. I'm I'm God
[42:43] wants to hear from us. Ain't that right?
[42:45] I'll take him. I want him. I I want the
[42:48] Lord Jesus Christ. I Amen. And And you
[42:51] know, it's uh I believe that there's a a
[42:54] people in this this building. I believe
[42:56] we're just fully persuaded. Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going all the way. Amen. You
[43:02] love him.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, it's just a real honor to
[43:05] have uh my nephew uh brother Josh here
[43:08] with us uh tonight and and um I was
[43:12] supposed to be in Alaska and uh uh and
[43:16] so I had asked him uh to come and uh so
[43:20] I'm I'm glad I'm be here to be able to
[43:23] hear him and to minister and uh I sure
[43:26] appreciate brother Josh and his ministry
[43:29] and you know uh uh just uh he is he has
[43:33] uh given his life to this gospel and
[43:36] loves this message as as we do. And so I
[43:40] know you're going to be blessed and uh
[43:43] uh you'll hear from God tonight. Amen.
[43:46] And and so let's just stand to our feet
[43:48] and and um
[43:51] uh we want to just invite him to come
[43:55] and and take his liberty and preach
[43:58] whatever the Lord has laid upon his
[44:00] heart. Amen. Let's just sing uh all the
[44:04] way. I'm going all the way.
[44:08] Amen. I'm so glad to be the Rebecca of
[44:11] this age.
[44:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh, all
[44:18] the way.
[44:20] I'm going all the way.
[44:24] Oh, all
[44:27] the way.
[44:29] I'm going. Yes, I am
[44:33] all
[44:35] the way.
[44:37] I'm going all the way.
[44:41] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[44:47] I've made my decision.
[44:50] I've made my decision.
[44:55] I'm going all the way. Oh, I've made
[45:00] my decision.
[45:02] I'm going all the way. Oh, I've made my
[45:08] decision.
[45:10] [Music]
[45:17] Away with the Lord. I've drawn the line.
[45:21] Oh, I've drawn
[45:24] the line.
[45:27] I'm going all the way. I've made my
[45:30] choice.
[45:32] Made my choice.
[45:35] I'm going all the way. I've drawn the
[45:38] line.
[45:41] Oh yeah. I'm going all the way.
[45:47] I'm going all the way with the Lord.
[45:55] Amen. And I trust that your confession
[45:57] tonight, I'm going all the way with the
[45:59] Lord. Whatever his will for my life is,
[46:02] his desire, I'm going to surrender my
[46:05] life to it. My desires, my ambitions,
[46:09] whatever it may be, Lord, I'm going all
[46:11] the way. And I believe that's what God
[46:13] wants in his people. There's a desire of
[46:16] Lord, not my will, but thy will be done.
[46:18] Surrendering to the call of God and let
[46:21] him lead us and direct us. Amen. Well,
[46:24] if you would have your Bibles tonight,
[46:26] I've got two passages of scripture. 1
[46:29] John 4:9.
[46:31] Read that down to the 10th verse and 1
[46:33] John 5 and2. It's good to be with y'all
[46:36] this evening. Um, like Uncle Sean was
[46:40] saying, he was supposed to be there in
[46:41] in Alaska. And so, he's which he's not
[46:44] in Alaska, so you might be a little
[46:46] disappointed that he's not ministering,
[46:47] but I pray something can be said tonight
[46:50] to be a blessing and to strengthen you
[46:51] in some way. Amen. But first John 4 and9
[46:59] you love the Lord this evening.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; In this was manifested the love of God
[47:06] towards us because that God sent his
[47:09] only begotten son into the world that we
[47:12] might live through him. Herein is love.
[47:15] Not that we loved God, but that he loved
[47:18] us and sent his son to be the
[47:20] propitiation for our sins. In 1 John
[47:24] 5:2,
[47:26] by this we know that we love the
[47:28] children of God when we love God and
[47:31] keep his commandments. For this is the
[47:33] love of God, that we keep his
[47:35] commandments, and his commandments are
[47:37] not grievious. For whatsoever is born of
[47:40] God overcomemeth the world, and this is
[47:43] the victory that overcometh the world,
[47:45] even our faith. Amen. Can we bow our
[47:48] heads here this evening? Dear gracious
[47:50] heavenly father, Lord, we're thankful
[47:52] for your grace, your mercy, Lord, your
[47:54] your spirit that we feel here among us
[47:56] tonight. Father, we ask that you would
[47:59] just feel at home here among us, Lord.
[48:02] just have your liberty, Father, to speak
[48:04] to the hearts and to the needs, Lord. If
[48:06] you need to convict us of things, Lord,
[48:08] convict us, Father. But we ask that you
[48:10] would just have your perfect way among
[48:12] us, Lord. Just anoint your your speaker
[48:14] tonight and the hearer, Father. May
[48:16] everything that is said and done be
[48:19] according to your will. Lord, we love
[48:21] you and we're thankful for all these
[48:22] things in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be
[48:26] seated this evening. I have just a
[48:28] simple thought but I pray it can all
[48:31] come together and and make some sense
[48:33] but it would be faith is our victory and
[48:36] brother Brandham would tell us that
[48:38] faith and love uh works together. He
[48:41] would say here in perfect faith here
[48:43] just like a young couple you can take a
[48:45] young man and a young woman they love
[48:47] they fall in love with the one one with
[48:49] another and as they go along they begin
[48:52] to know one one another more. Their
[48:54] hearts just begin to beat as one. See,
[48:57] they're not husband and wife, but their
[48:59] love binds them together. They have
[49:02] confidence one in another. Now, if they
[49:04] really love one another, really love,
[49:07] and you know that this girl loves you
[49:08] and she and and she knows that you love
[49:11] her, you've got confidence. He says,
[49:13] faith in one another. And you've got to
[49:15] have faith in one another. If you
[49:17] didn't, you better not marry her. See,
[49:19] notice you've got to have faith. And you
[49:21] separate them. Put one in the extreme
[49:24] south, one in the extreme north. There's
[49:26] still that love that beats one for
[49:28] another. No matter where they are at,
[49:30] they're just as true to one another as
[49:33] they can be because they love one
[49:35] another. And if you love the Lord, not
[49:37] just trying to dodge hell, but you love
[49:40] the Lord, then you have faith in God.
[49:42] See, if you love him, and I think that's
[49:45] a a powerful quote that we're not just
[49:47] trying to dodge hell, but there's a love
[49:50] for the things of God. And and I believe
[49:53] that that no man can love God unless God
[49:56] puts the love there. And so I believe
[49:58] that God has predestinated us to to have
[50:01] a love for his word, to have a love for
[50:03] for his characteristics. And I like how
[50:05] brother Brandham would put it. When your
[50:07] wife knows that you love her and you
[50:10] know that she loves you, there's a
[50:12] confidence in one another. So it ain't
[50:15] just words or a lip service that I love
[50:18] you and you love me, but love has
[50:20] actions. And I believe that the love of
[50:22] God has actions as well. It's it's more
[50:25] than I just love God, but there's a life
[50:27] behind it. And it's more than just God
[50:29] loves me, but there's a confidence that
[50:32] God loves me and is going to walk with
[50:34] me even if I go through the valley of
[50:36] the shadow of death. And brother Brandon
[50:38] would would talk about the couple that
[50:40] would get married and and and the lady
[50:42] was a was a Christian for some time now,
[50:45] but the man was a new Christian. And she
[50:47] would tell him, "If you ever fall into
[50:49] sin and make a mistake," she would say,
[50:52] "Don't run away from home, but come back
[50:54] to me and we'll we'll pray and weep our
[50:56] way back to Calvary." And the man would
[50:58] be eating lunch with his buddies and
[51:00] would see, "How can I do anything wrong
[51:02] with a love like that?" He realized that
[51:05] her love was more than just words, but
[51:07] there was an action behind it. And I
[51:10] believe love is expressive, and the
[51:12] Bible will tell us, "If you love me,
[51:14] keep my commandments." And I believe
[51:16] that there's a actions behind our love
[51:19] for the things of God. And brother
[51:21] Brandon would say, "We are men and
[51:22] women, but we're also Christians. And if
[51:25] he's our example, let us completely
[51:28] deliver ourselves into the hands of the
[51:30] Holy Ghost that we might be subjects of
[51:34] the kingdom of God." And so, if we love
[51:36] God, there's going to be a delivering
[51:38] up. There's an action that we place that
[51:41] we're taking our life and we're putting
[51:43] it into the hands of the Holy Ghost. And
[51:46] and I like it, brother Brandham says
[51:48] that we're men and women, but we're also
[51:50] Christians. And that really spoke to my
[51:52] heart because many times we use our
[51:55] humanity as excuses. You know, we all
[51:57] have mistakes. We all have flaws and
[52:00] failures. We're human beings, but too
[52:02] many times we use that as an excuse. We
[52:05] we lose a temper. Well, I'm just human.
[52:07] You know, you you you tell a little lie.
[52:09] Well, I'm just human. You you you do a
[52:11] brother wrong. Well, I'm just human.
[52:13] Brother Brandham says, "We are men and
[52:15] women, but we're also Christians." In
[52:18] other words, if you love me, keep my
[52:20] commandments. There's if you really love
[52:22] God, there's going to be actions. We
[52:24] make mistakes, but we don't fall into
[52:27] sin. And I believe that that we forfeit
[52:30] all of our rights to the kingdom of
[52:32] God's sake. Even when we have the the
[52:34] the the the whenever the sa when Satan
[52:37] comes and pulls on our flesh, I believe
[52:39] there's a total deliverance. And brother
[52:41] Brandham would talk about Moses and how
[52:44] that he was believing for a total
[52:46] deliverance. And he would come to
[52:47] Pharaoh and would say, "Let my people
[52:49] go." Brother Brandham would say that
[52:52] Pharaoh was okay with him going up and
[52:54] worshiping, but he had to leave some
[52:56] things behind. He had to leave some
[52:58] children behind, some cattle behind. But
[53:01] brother Brandham says Moses wasn't a
[53:02] compromiser. He says we're not leaving a
[53:05] hoof behind. He says he wanted a total
[53:08] deliverance. And I believe this bride is
[53:11] not a compromiser. There's a love on the
[53:13] inside for God. And so we're not
[53:16] compromising when sin flies up when we
[53:19] lose a temper or or when this Tim says
[53:22] we're loving God and there's actions.
[53:24] Lord, I'm surrendering myself to the
[53:27] hands of the Holy Ghost. And brother
[53:29] Brandon would talk about Moses and would
[53:31] say he was totally delivered from sheep
[53:34] hurting to heard God's sheep. Then he
[53:37] would say that he he so surrendered
[53:40] himself to the hands of God till God
[53:43] could trust him. And I love that because
[53:45] once we surrender oursel to the hands of
[53:48] the Holy Ghost, then we're entrusted
[53:51] with the kingdom of God. And we know
[53:53] what the kingdom of God is. It's it's a
[53:55] kingdom, a spiritual kingdom that is
[53:57] birthed on the inside of the believer.
[54:00] Brother Brand, I'm going to preach the
[54:01] Messiah message, the Messiah, and would
[54:03] say, "What is the Messiah?" It's the
[54:05] kingdom of God inside of the believer.
[54:08] So once Moses would deliver himself into
[54:11] the hands of God, he would be entrusted
[54:14] with the kingdom of God. No wonder he
[54:16] would God would speak to Moses and would
[54:18] say, "Why cry unto me? Speak and go
[54:21] forward." In other words, I've entrusted
[54:23] you with something. Operate faith and
[54:27] speak the word over your life and march
[54:30] on forward. And I believe God has
[54:32] entrusted us with the kingdom of God.
[54:35] That no matter what we come against, the
[54:37] trials we face, all we have to do is
[54:40] speak the word and go forward. And I
[54:43] believe that God trusts us. It ain't
[54:45] that we're just trusting God, but God is
[54:47] trusting us as well. But the Brandon
[54:49] would tell us that God knew that he
[54:52] could trust Job. And he says God knows
[54:54] how much he can trust you. So before
[54:57] that that Job would be on the ash heap
[55:00] before Job would have his family taken
[55:02] away and his his livestock taken away,
[55:05] God trusted him enough to know he was
[55:08] going to come out on the other side. And
[55:10] before we ever go through anything, God
[55:13] trusts us enough to know that we can
[55:16] endure when we go through the trials.
[55:19] You see, so it's a love. God knows we
[55:21] love him. We know that God loves us. So
[55:24] there's a trust in one another. And so
[55:27] Job wasn't only tr God wasn't only
[55:29] trusting Job, but Job was also trusting
[55:33] God. He would say, "I he knoweth the way
[55:36] that I take." And since there was a
[55:38] trust in one another, there was a
[55:40] confidence. There was a faith to endure.
[55:44] Even when his friends turned against
[55:45] him, he would say, "I'm not a secret
[55:47] sinner. I'm under the blood of the
[55:50] sacrifice." Even when his wife would
[55:52] say, "Curse God and die." He would say,
[55:54] "You speak like a foolish woman. The
[55:57] Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
[55:59] Blessed be the holy name." There was a
[56:02] trust producing a faith in the word of
[56:05] God. It was David that would say,
[56:07] "Though God slay me, yet I will trust
[56:09] him." And I believe that there can be a
[56:12] trust on the inside of every one of our
[56:14] lives. Though God slay me, yet I will
[56:17] trust him. There's a kingdom that God
[56:20] has entrusted me with. And brother
[56:22] Brandon would tell us, many people think
[56:24] that the love of God is like a parental
[56:27] love with no suffering. But he says his
[56:30] love is an elective love. And the line,
[56:33] the proof of his love is election. So
[56:35] the proof of his love is not not keeping
[56:38] us from going through things but it's an
[56:41] elective love that can keep us when we
[56:44] go through those things. Oh hallelujah.
[56:46] The Bible would say uh Esau have I hated
[56:48] and Jacob have I loved. There was a
[56:51] there was an election because of the
[56:54] love of God. And I believe there's an
[56:56] elective an election that God has chosen
[57:00] us because of the love of God. And you
[57:03] see, maybe God won't pull us out of the
[57:06] trial sometimes, but he's going to give
[57:08] us grace to endure. You know, he didn't
[57:11] pull Job off of the ash heap, but he
[57:13] gave him grace and would show him that
[57:15] his redeemer liveth. So even while he
[57:18] was on the ash heap, there would be
[57:20] grace to endure the hardships that he
[57:23] was going through. God wouldn't pull the
[57:26] three Hebrew boys out of the fiery
[57:28] furnace, but grace would come and be the
[57:30] fourth man in the fire and would show
[57:33] them even if you're in the midst of it,
[57:35] my grace is sufficient for when you're
[57:38] in the time of need. Hallelujah. God
[57:41] then'll pull Daniel out of the lion's
[57:42] den, the grace would come and would
[57:45] shield him from the mouth of the lion.
[57:48] So, there's a trust that God has placed
[57:51] inside of our life. Brother Brandon
[57:53] would say, "Times may be hard. God has
[57:55] not promised us a flowery bed of ease,
[57:58] but he's promised grace sufficient for
[58:01] every trial that can hit you." That's
[58:03] right. Yes, indeed. Grace is sufficient.
[58:06] Not Not he's on a flowery bed of ease,
[58:09] but he's promised grace to overcome in
[58:12] every temptation. And so every time we
[58:15] go through the valley of the shadow of
[58:17] death, we fear no evil because grace is
[58:21] walking with us. Hallelujah. We're
[58:23] trusting God that his rod is guiding us
[58:26] that that he prepare us the table in the
[58:29] midst of our enemy. There's a trust that
[58:32] we have in God. And then brother Brandon
[58:34] would tell us that he can totally
[58:37] deliver him both body, soul, and spirit.
[58:40] when he's talking about when if we go by
[58:42] the way of the grave, he says he can
[58:44] deliver both body, soul, and spirit
[58:46] because he has trusted in me. Oh,
[58:50] hallelujah. So once if we can only trust
[58:52] God, he's going to be the friend that
[58:55] stickketh closer than a brother. So
[58:57] brother Brandham then would tell us that
[58:59] that we were all sinners alienated
[59:01] without God in the world and the m the
[59:04] the muck of the world. And he says, I
[59:06] talked about this morning God come to
[59:08] us. God sought us. You never saw God. No
[59:12] man come to me except the father draws
[59:15] him first. And God come down to that
[59:17] muck where you was and sought you out.
[59:20] Brought you out. That ought to create a
[59:23] perfect love. Look where you was and
[59:26] look where you are now. What did that?
[59:28] Somebody loved you. Can't you have faith
[59:31] in what he promised you then? Real
[59:34] genuine love will create confidence in
[59:37] his word. Oh, hallelujah. Look where you
[59:40] was and look where you are now. What was
[59:43] it? Somebody loved you. Oh, the color
[59:45] lady would say, "I'm not what I ought to
[59:47] be and I'm not what I want to be, but
[59:49] thank God I'm not what I used to be."
[59:52] But the Brandon Matella, she knew
[59:54] somebody brought her from that place to
[59:57] this place. So, what was it? Somebody
[59:59] loved us. When we was unlovable, God
[1:00:02] loved us. When we was in sin, shape and
[1:00:04] iniquity, God still loved us. No wonder
[1:00:07] the Apostle Paul could say, "Who shall
[1:00:10] separate us from the love of God?" None
[1:00:12] of these things, persecution, distress,
[1:00:15] famine, peril, short, nothing present,
[1:00:18] nothing future to come, nothing can
[1:00:20] separate us from the love of God. And
[1:00:23] with that trust, we know that God will
[1:00:26] keep us no matter what we go through.
[1:00:29] And so God's love is a personal love.
[1:00:32] You can look there in Revelations 3:19.
[1:00:34] As many as I love. Brother Brandon would
[1:00:37] say the emphasis is on the eye. He says,
[1:00:40] "Not as many as loves him, but as many
[1:00:42] as I love." And so the God's love is a
[1:00:45] personal love, not a human love. Brother
[1:00:48] Brandon Matt tell us there's two
[1:00:49] different kinds of loves, right? There's
[1:00:51] a human love and then God's love. He
[1:00:53] says human love, if somebody done your
[1:00:56] wife wrong, he says you go and you box
[1:00:58] him, right? you go box his jaw in cuz
[1:01:00] that that's a human love. But then he
[1:01:02] says God's love, he says, "Well, pray
[1:01:05] for the man." And so God's love that the
[1:01:07] the the as many as I love is not a human
[1:01:10] love where you do me good, I'll do you
[1:01:13] good or you do me wrong, I'll do you
[1:01:15] wrong. The love that God has for us is
[1:01:18] an elective love. It it's not a love
[1:01:21] that loves you today and and don't love
[1:01:23] you tomorrow. But even if we make
[1:01:25] mistakes, the elective love still
[1:01:28] stands. It ain't a human love that if
[1:01:30] you pray to God once a day, he's going
[1:01:32] to love you back. But he's a it's a love
[1:01:35] that is an everlasting love. You can
[1:01:37] look at Jeremiah 31 and3. The Lord hath
[1:01:40] appeared unfolded unto me, saying, "Yay,
[1:01:43] I have loved thee with an everlasting
[1:01:46] love. Therefore, with loving kindness, I
[1:01:49] have drawn thee." And so his love is the
[1:01:52] everlasting love. And what I love about
[1:01:54] that scripture is the Bible says, "The
[1:01:56] Lord of old hath appeared unto me." In
[1:01:59] other words, the the same one that loved
[1:02:01] him from before the foundation of the
[1:02:04] world is still loving him this present
[1:02:06] day. And so, the same God that called
[1:02:09] you and put your name on the lamb's book
[1:02:12] of life is still loving you with an
[1:02:14] everlasting love. Even if you feel like
[1:02:17] you've hit rock bottom, even when you
[1:02:19] feel like your friends forsaken you,
[1:02:21] your family has forsaken you, it's an
[1:02:23] everlasting love that is never going to
[1:02:26] be diminished. Hallelujah. And with
[1:02:29] loving kindness have I drawn thee. So in
[1:02:32] other words, it ain't your merits that
[1:02:34] has brought you to me, but it's my
[1:02:36] loving kindness. And David would say,
[1:02:38] thy loving kindness is better than life.
[1:02:41] So there's something there's something
[1:02:43] more than a human love, but there's a
[1:02:46] godly love that has called you and has
[1:02:49] poured upon your heart. That's what we
[1:02:51] have got in this generation was a
[1:02:54] perfect love to come and remove all of
[1:02:56] the doubts to give you a perfect faith
[1:02:59] in a perfect word that you can believe
[1:03:01] that all things are possible to them
[1:03:04] that believe. You can look at
[1:03:06] Deuteronomy 7 and 6. For thou art a holy
[1:03:09] people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord
[1:03:12] thy God hath chosen thee to be a special
[1:03:15] people unto himself above all people
[1:03:18] that are upon the face of the earth. The
[1:03:20] Lord did not set his love upon you, nor
[1:03:23] choose you, because you are more in
[1:03:25] number than any other people. For ye
[1:03:27] were the fewest of all people, but
[1:03:30] because the Lord loved you, because he
[1:03:33] would keep the oath which he has sworn
[1:03:35] unto your fathers. Hath the Lord brought
[1:03:38] you out of the mighty hand and has
[1:03:40] redeemed you out of the house of the
[1:03:42] bondman and from the hand of King
[1:03:45] Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. It's not
[1:03:48] because we're mighty. It's not because
[1:03:50] you have a bunch to offer. It's not
[1:03:52] because you have a nice car or a nice
[1:03:54] bank account, but because the love of
[1:03:56] God is an everlasting love. It will
[1:03:59] bring you out of the hand of bondage and
[1:04:02] will place you into an everlasting
[1:04:04] kingdom that will never be diminished.
[1:04:07] Oh, hallelujah. This kingdom is not a
[1:04:09] kingdom that's here today and gone
[1:04:11] tomorrow. But Jesus would say, "This
[1:04:13] kingdom, there shall be no end to it.
[1:04:16] We've seen kingdoms rise and we and they
[1:04:18] fall. But this kingdom is an everlasting
[1:04:21] kingdom that we've been placed into. But
[1:04:24] because the Lord hath loved you. And so
[1:04:27] it's the love of God and and it's
[1:04:29] because that that God has loved us that
[1:04:32] he's given us a message and and has
[1:04:35] opened himself up and has revealed
[1:04:37] himself to you and has placed you over a
[1:04:40] spiritual dominion and has placed you as
[1:04:42] kings and as priests. And brother
[1:04:44] Brandham would say, "He hath made us."
[1:04:46] Oh, there are certain truths that we
[1:04:49] need to emphasize, and this is one of
[1:04:51] them. He He hath made us. Salvation is
[1:04:55] his doing. Salvation is of the Lord. All
[1:04:58] grace, he redeemed us for a purpose. He
[1:05:02] bought us for a purpose. I love that the
[1:05:05] emphasis is on. He hath made us kings
[1:05:08] and priests. You didn't make yourself
[1:05:10] worthy. God made you worthy. You didn't
[1:05:13] bring God's elective love to yourself.
[1:05:15] God bestowed his love upon you and have
[1:05:18] made you kings and priests. You can look
[1:05:21] at 1 Peter 2:9. You're a chosen
[1:05:23] generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
[1:05:26] nation, a peculiar people, that you
[1:05:28] should show forth the praises of him who
[1:05:30] have called you out of darkness into his
[1:05:33] marvelous light, which in times past
[1:05:36] were not a people, but are now the
[1:05:39] people of God, which have not attained
[1:05:41] mercy, but now have obtained mercy. We
[1:05:45] were in times past nobody. But brother
[1:05:48] Brandon would tell us there's three
[1:05:49] different nationalities of people,
[1:05:51] right? There's the Jews, the Gentiles,
[1:05:53] and the Samaritans. God would reveal
[1:05:55] himself to the Jews when he would speak
[1:05:57] to Nathaniel, the Messiah sign. He
[1:06:00] would, Brother Brandon then would tell
[1:06:01] us, God would re would reveal himself to
[1:06:03] the Samaritans at the woman at the well.
[1:06:06] But he says that the Gentiles were a
[1:06:08] heathen people. They weren't looking for
[1:06:10] God. And God only comes to those who
[1:06:12] were looking for him. So, we were in
[1:06:14] times past, not a people. But now, we
[1:06:17] are the people of God. It's not because
[1:06:20] you chose him, but God chose you over
[1:06:23] the denominations. God chose you over
[1:06:26] all the people that are upon the world
[1:06:28] today. We were in times past not a
[1:06:30] people, but now the people of God.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, we once were a heathen people, but
[1:06:36] through the love of God, he would show
[1:06:39] us the Messiah sign. He would show us
[1:06:41] that the Messiah is upon the earth
[1:06:44] today. How come we could recognize the
[1:06:47] Messiah is because we was redeemable.
[1:06:50] Oh, hallelujah. Remember the woman up
[1:06:51] the well, brother Brandham says she was
[1:06:53] redeemable. And when she recognized the
[1:06:56] Messiah, it would bring the image that
[1:06:59] God had in his mind to her. What was it?
[1:07:02] She was redeemable. Then brother Brandon
[1:07:04] would say this. You put yourself into
[1:07:07] position by recognizing him. He says,
[1:07:10] "You're now subject now to see greater
[1:07:14] things." Oh, hallelujah. By recognizing
[1:07:17] him, you're subject now to see greater
[1:07:20] things. Daniel would say, "The people
[1:07:22] that know their God shall be strong and
[1:07:25] do exploits." In other words, you're
[1:07:28] going to see some mighty things. You're
[1:07:30] not just going to see this one fall away
[1:07:32] and that one fall away, but you're going
[1:07:34] to see a kingdom that is never
[1:07:36] diminished. You're going to see a young
[1:07:38] people that can strive in the midst of
[1:07:40] Leoa. You're going to see a marriage
[1:07:43] that can that can be kept together by
[1:07:46] the hand of God. You can see a bride
[1:07:48] that it can go through the valley of the
[1:07:50] shadow of death, but there's still
[1:07:52] somebody trusting him. Oh, you can see
[1:07:55] Faith Tabernacle that has been through
[1:07:58] some hardships, but you're still
[1:08:00] standing. There's a people that know
[1:08:02] their God and they're seeing some mighty
[1:08:05] things. They shall be strong and do
[1:08:08] exploits. What is it? We've been
[1:08:10] delivered from the power of darkness and
[1:08:13] has been translated into the kingdom.
[1:08:16] You look at Colossians 1:13. Who have
[1:08:18] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:08:20] and has translated us into the kingdom
[1:08:24] of his dear son. So, we're still walking
[1:08:26] among darkness, but we've been delivered
[1:08:29] from the power of darkness. You're still
[1:08:31] walking in your flesh, but you've been
[1:08:33] delivered from the power of your flesh.
[1:08:35] You're walking in legosa, but you've
[1:08:38] been delivered from the power of Leoa.
[1:08:41] And we've been translated. The word
[1:08:43] translated means to be moved from one
[1:08:46] place to another. The the Bible will
[1:08:49] tell us about John that he got in the
[1:08:52] spirit on the Lord's day. Brother
[1:08:54] Brandham says he got into the spirit and
[1:08:56] was translated or transported. So even
[1:08:59] though he was still in his flesh, he was
[1:09:02] seeing mighty things. His body was still
[1:09:05] on the aisle of Patmas, but in the
[1:09:07] spirit he could see there was an open
[1:09:09] book. And my name is written upon that
[1:09:12] open book. That's why he could rejoice.
[1:09:15] Oh hallelujah. He was weeping because
[1:09:18] nobody was found worthy to open the
[1:09:20] book, even look upon the book. But then
[1:09:23] he heard a voice saying, "Weep not,
[1:09:24] John, for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:09:27] hath prevailed to open the book and
[1:09:30] loosen the seals." He went from weeping
[1:09:32] to rejoicing. What did brother Brandham
[1:09:34] say? He must have saw his name upon that
[1:09:37] book. So his body was still on the
[1:09:40] outmas, but he was translated into
[1:09:43] another position. Your body is still
[1:09:46] walking in legacy, but you've been
[1:09:49] translated into a bride age. You're
[1:09:51] walking in Leodysa, but you've been
[1:09:53] delivered from the power of Leodysa.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; There's a kingdom that we've been placed
[1:10:00] into. And I believe we are victorious
[1:10:03] people. Not just somebody that's
[1:10:04] victorious on a Wednesday or upon a
[1:10:07] Sunday, but we are victorious for faith
[1:10:10] is our victory. Oh, we once was a
[1:10:13] people, not a people, but now the people
[1:10:15] of God. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon
[1:10:18] would say, Paul said, "My flesh wants to
[1:10:20] always yield to that. Your flesh does
[1:10:22] too. But the law of the spirit of God in
[1:10:25] the heart overcomes the flesh and makes
[1:10:28] the body obey what the heart says do."
[1:10:32] So the kingdom which is upon your heart
[1:10:34] brings your body into subjection. Even
[1:10:37] when it feels like you don't want to
[1:10:39] come to church, brother, I don't got the
[1:10:41] quote in front of me, but brother
[1:10:42] Brandon would tell us that there's the
[1:10:44] law of the spirit and the law of the
[1:10:46] flesh. He says, "Many times," I hope
[1:10:48] this is okay. He says, "Many times you
[1:10:50] don't feel like coming to church." He
[1:10:52] says, "What is it?" That's the law of
[1:10:54] the flesh. Oh, but then there's another
[1:10:56] law. There's a kingdom that pressures
[1:10:59] you that that causes you to keep going
[1:11:01] on even when you don't feel like you can
[1:11:04] go on. You see, there's a kingdom that
[1:11:06] we've been placed into. And brother
[1:11:08] Brandon would say, "But the hour has
[1:11:10] come that every kingdom has to give way
[1:11:13] because there's a kingdom of God that's
[1:11:16] established in the human heart by the
[1:11:19] baptism of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:11:21] presence of Jesus Christ. And Christ
[1:11:24] will come to his bride and will set up a
[1:11:27] kingdom here on the earth that will
[1:11:29] never be diminished." Oh, so he's coming
[1:11:32] upon the earth inside of a bride body. I
[1:11:36] believe this is the bright coming of
[1:11:38] Jesus Christ. We are we become the
[1:11:40] literal spoken word of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:43] What does that mean, brother Josh? The
[1:11:45] message of the hour is not in tape form,
[1:11:48] but it's living in people that have
[1:11:50] mistakes, that has failures, but they're
[1:11:53] not bound to them. They have
[1:11:54] temptations, but they've been delivered
[1:11:57] from the power of it and transported or
[1:12:00] translated into the kingdom of Almighty
[1:12:03] God. Hallelujah. That's why God told
[1:12:06] Moses, "Why cry? Speak. You're walking
[1:12:08] in your flesh, but you've got authority
[1:12:11] behind you. Speak the word." Oh, I think
[1:12:14] it's time that we stop crying about the
[1:12:16] hard times and get some grit about
[1:12:18] oursel and pick up the word of God and
[1:12:21] see. I'm not crying about it, but I'm
[1:12:23] speaking the word of God over my
[1:12:25] situation. I'm speaking the word of God
[1:12:28] over my family. I'm speaking the word of
[1:12:30] God over my church. Oh, hallelujah. I'm
[1:12:34] walking in the flesh, but I'm not a part
[1:12:36] of the flesh. Brother Brand, I'm going
[1:12:38] to say now if you go out here and say,
[1:12:40] "Mountain move, I want to show you I can
[1:12:42] do it." He says, "It won't do it." But
[1:12:45] if it's in the line of duty when God has
[1:12:48] commanded you to do something like he
[1:12:50] said to Moses, why cry to me? Speak to
[1:12:53] the children. People today is crying all
[1:12:56] the time, Lord, what next? Lord, what
[1:12:58] next? Just speak and go forward. That's
[1:13:02] right. God has commissioned us to do
[1:13:04] something. Let's do it. Don't stand
[1:13:06] around and think about it. How can it
[1:13:08] happen? Well, this is that don't make
[1:13:11] any difference. If God said it, he can
[1:13:14] do it anyhow. He is still the God of
[1:13:17] miracles. I believe that the God of
[1:13:20] miracles is still walking amongst us in
[1:13:23] this generation. Oh, brother Brandham
[1:13:25] would talk about Joshua and we say that
[1:13:27] God told Joshua to go and slay all of
[1:13:30] the enemy and there want to be one enemy
[1:13:32] stand before him. Brother Brandham says
[1:13:34] as the sun started to go down it was the
[1:13:38] evening time but then Joshua would stop
[1:13:40] and would say son stand still. Brother
[1:13:42] Brandham says he didn't have to pray
[1:13:44] about it ask about it but he was tied to
[1:13:47] an absolute with the commission. So
[1:13:50] while he was tied to an absolute, he
[1:13:52] would speak the word over his situation
[1:13:55] and his situation would be brought into
[1:13:57] subjection by the kingdom that he was
[1:14:00] established in. Hallelujah. You don't
[1:14:03] got to come to the pastor and say, "Is
[1:14:05] it possible for me to receive my
[1:14:07] healing?" God promised that you can
[1:14:09] receive him. You don't got to come and
[1:14:10] ask, "Can God heal my children? Can God
[1:14:13] save my children? Can I live in
[1:14:15] revival?" If God said him, he's still a
[1:14:17] God of miracles. All you got to do is
[1:14:20] pick up the word of God and speak the
[1:14:23] word and go forward. We're tied to an
[1:14:26] absolute. We're not tied to a a pastor's
[1:14:29] word or an evangelist's word. We're tied
[1:14:32] to heavens and earth will pass away. But
[1:14:34] my word will never fail.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He's still the God of miracles. I love
[1:14:39] that quote. He's still the God of
[1:14:41] miracles. It don't make any difference.
[1:14:43] If God said it, he'll do it anyhow. Just
[1:14:46] speak the word. Brother Brandon, I'm
[1:14:48] going to say use our armor. We've got
[1:14:49] armor. God works with us and gives us
[1:14:52] gives us the armor. The whole armor is
[1:14:54] supernatural. See, love, joy, peace,
[1:14:57] longsuffering, godliness, meekness,
[1:14:59] gentleness, patience is all in the
[1:15:02] supernatural. And if you let your faith
[1:15:04] loose to God's spirit, it brings your
[1:15:08] body into subjection to God's redemptive
[1:15:11] blessings to you. Oh, I said, let's let
[1:15:14] our faith loose this evening.
[1:15:17] Whatever you have need of, let your
[1:15:18] faith loose and let God bring your body
[1:15:21] into subjection to every blessing that
[1:15:25] he promised that you can have. I believe
[1:15:27] this message is full of your promises.
[1:15:30] Oh, I will restore unto you, saith the
[1:15:33] Lord. It's a heritage that we've been
[1:15:35] given. And the word heritage is it means
[1:15:38] inheritance. And brother Brandham would
[1:15:40] would would type Joel's prophecy if I
[1:15:42] will restore, sayeth the Lord, to the
[1:15:45] heritage of the Lord. In other words,
[1:15:48] everything that was lost in the fall,
[1:15:50] lost through the church ages, is your
[1:15:52] heritage. And if you're born into the
[1:15:55] family, whatever the heritage is, is
[1:15:58] given to you by birth. And we've been
[1:16:00] placed into the kingdom of God by the
[1:16:02] birth of the Holy Ghost. And this
[1:16:05] heritage is restored back to you. Oh,
[1:16:08] that's why the angel would tell John, go
[1:16:10] to the angel that has the book open,
[1:16:12] book in hand, and say, "Give me the
[1:16:14] book." It was John's heritage. Oh, come
[1:16:16] on now. And John is your type. That's
[1:16:19] why we're getting into this book and
[1:16:21] saying, "Give me give me my mountain.
[1:16:23] Give me my my revival." Whatever it is,
[1:16:26] it's our inheritage.
[1:16:28] Hallelujah. And as we take the word for
[1:16:30] our life, brother Brandham would would
[1:16:32] would tell us that the word of God is
[1:16:34] like a conductor. He would say, "Which
[1:16:37] it channels the electricity." And I love
[1:16:39] it because he would say, "See, here's
[1:16:41] the thing that delivers the word." The
[1:16:43] word goes right out and the Holy Spirit
[1:16:46] follows the word wherever the word is
[1:16:49] preached. And I love this part of it. He
[1:16:51] says, "You see, your pastor preaches
[1:16:53] it." And the first thing you know, he
[1:16:55] goes, "Whoop!" Brother Brandham makes a
[1:16:57] blowing sound. Across the building goes
[1:17:00] the Holy Ghost. You see, that's right.
[1:17:02] It's the conductor of the word. And he
[1:17:05] says the word is the conductor of the
[1:17:07] spirit because where the word is
[1:17:09] preached the spirit follows it. And
[1:17:12] wherever it goes, why the spirit follows
[1:17:15] the word and I love it how he mentions
[1:17:17] the pastor cuz many times we think that
[1:17:20] the spirit of God can only come whenever
[1:17:22] it's a meeting or an evangelist. But he
[1:17:24] says when your preacher or your pastor
[1:17:26] preaches the word, he goes, "Here comes
[1:17:28] the Holy Ghost." Oh, and I believe it
[1:17:31] can happen in a church, in a home, in a
[1:17:34] marriage. You want a revival, put the
[1:17:36] word as the head of your home. You want
[1:17:39] to see revival for your children, play
[1:17:41] the tapes and watch the revival, the the
[1:17:43] the spirit of the almighty God come into
[1:17:46] a home, come into a marriage, come into
[1:17:49] a family and watch it bring a revival
[1:17:52] greater than ever before. That's what I
[1:17:54] want. Don't you? I want not I I don't
[1:17:56] want to be just among the bride revival.
[1:17:59] Let me be a part of it. I don't want to
[1:18:01] just quote the bride's revival. I want
[1:18:03] to be the bride's revival. Oh,
[1:18:06] hallelujah. It's a kingdom. Hallelujah.
[1:18:09] Brother Brand, I'm going to say this
[1:18:10] here. We are kings, spiritual kings. Oh,
[1:18:13] we are going to be kings upon the earth
[1:18:16] with him when he sits upon his throne.
[1:18:18] But right now, we are spiritual kings.
[1:18:21] And we reign over a spiritual kingdom.
[1:18:23] Right now we reign with Christ having
[1:18:26] dominion over sin, the world, the flesh,
[1:18:29] and the devil. Showing forth his praise
[1:18:32] and glory, showing forth himself. For it
[1:18:35] is Christ in us. Oh, hallelujah. What is
[1:18:38] this dominion? I love it. It's over sin,
[1:18:41] the world, the flesh. Oh my god.
[1:18:44] Sometimes the flesh gets the best of us,
[1:18:46] don't it? Sometimes we make mistakes,
[1:18:48] but this dominion is over the flesh.
[1:18:51] It's over the devil. Brother Brand, I'm
[1:18:53] going to tell us who's your greatest
[1:18:54] enemy. Yourself, right? Not the devil,
[1:18:57] not your brother, not not the preacher,
[1:18:59] not your wife, but you are your greatest
[1:19:02] enemy. And it's incredible because
[1:19:04] whenever you get dominion over your
[1:19:06] flesh, then the devil starts to scatter.
[1:19:09] You remember whenever uh the Philistines
[1:19:11] were were boasting over the children of
[1:19:13] Israel because they had Goliath. Brother
[1:19:16] Brandon would tell us that the devil
[1:19:17] always comes and boasts when he thinks
[1:19:20] he has the upper hand. Right? But what
[1:19:22] would happen whenever Goliath would be
[1:19:24] brought into subjection? Then the
[1:19:26] Philistines would begin to run. Then the
[1:19:29] Israelites started to chase them. How
[1:19:32] come their greatest weapon was brought
[1:19:34] into subjection? Oh, when you bring your
[1:19:37] body into subjection, which is the
[1:19:39] devil's greatest weapon, then watch
[1:19:41] there be a revival. Watch every devil
[1:19:44] have to scatter out of a home, scatter
[1:19:46] out of your marriage, scatter out of
[1:19:48] your house. You're bringing your your
[1:19:50] your greatest enemy into subjection.
[1:19:54] Hallelujah. And I believe that we can
[1:19:56] bring our body into subjection. And
[1:19:59] what's incredible when you look at the
[1:20:01] story of Joshua, the Bible tells us that
[1:20:04] the sun stood still until the people
[1:20:06] avenged themselves upon the enemy.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; So as long as they were still fighting,
[1:20:12] the supernatural was there. As long as
[1:20:15] they were still needing victory, the
[1:20:17] supernatural was there. What is it? He's
[1:20:19] still the God of miracles. As long as
[1:20:22] you're still fighting in this warfare,
[1:20:25] the God of miracles is here. Oh, come on
[1:20:28] now. As long as you're still in your
[1:20:29] flesh, fighting mind battles, fighting
[1:20:32] discouragement, fighting the things of
[1:20:34] the world, the supernatural God is still
[1:20:37] here. And what's incredible, you can
[1:20:39] look at Joshua 10 and 19. And the Bible
[1:20:43] tells us that that there were some kings
[1:20:45] that that that that Joshua had put into
[1:20:48] a cave. And he would say this here to
[1:20:50] his men, "Stay ye not, but pursue after
[1:20:53] your enemies, and smite the highmost of
[1:20:56] them, suffer them not to enter into
[1:20:59] their cities, for the Lord your God have
[1:21:02] delivered them into your hands." I love
[1:21:05] that because the promise was given to
[1:21:07] Joshua. But now Joshua is just echoing
[1:21:10] the promise that was given to him. So
[1:21:13] even though Joshua had five kings into
[1:21:16] the in the cave and he he may have been
[1:21:19] victorious, that wasn't good enough for
[1:21:21] his men. Oh, hallelujah. Our prophets
[1:21:24] went off the scene and he's entered into
[1:21:26] his reward. But we've got some enemies
[1:21:28] we got to fight. Come on now. Brother
[1:21:31] Brandham had to fight his own enemies.
[1:21:33] He had to be victorious over his own
[1:21:35] flesh. But the supernatural is still
[1:21:38] here among us. The Lord your God have
[1:21:40] delivered them into your hand. You might
[1:21:43] have never seen the angel of the Lord
[1:21:45] like brother Brandham has. But we're
[1:21:47] under the same promise that the
[1:21:50] supernatural is going to be with us
[1:21:52] until the enemy is destroyed.
[1:21:56] Hallelujah. You believe that this
[1:21:58] evening that the promises of God ain't
[1:22:00] an imagination but is something we
[1:22:03] possess. Brother Brandon would say
[1:22:05] notice it is something that you possess.
[1:22:07] Not an imagination. If you really have
[1:22:10] it, it's just as real to you as any
[1:22:12] other thing could be. It's just as real
[1:22:15] as you know like you're riding an
[1:22:16] automobile. It's just as real to you
[1:22:19] know you're sitting in church. It's just
[1:22:21] as real to you hear my as you hear my
[1:22:23] voice. It's a substance, not an
[1:22:26] imagination, not an emotion, but it's
[1:22:28] something that you have. And it comes by
[1:22:31] hearing the word of God. And faith
[1:22:33] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:22:36] of God. I love that because he's he's
[1:22:38] telling us the promises of God is not an
[1:22:42] imagination, but they are substance.
[1:22:45] It's something tangible. It's something
[1:22:47] you can experience. And he would tell us
[1:22:49] later on in that quote, he says, "You
[1:22:52] can see somebody else get a word from
[1:22:54] the Lord and act out the promise of God
[1:22:57] in their life." And then somebody else
[1:22:59] says, "I can do that, too." Brother
[1:23:01] Brandham says, "That's just an
[1:23:03] imagination." He says, "That's
[1:23:05] potentially faith, but that's just an
[1:23:07] imagination." He says, "Then you find
[1:23:09] them wrecked up somewhere." So, we're
[1:23:12] not just following the word because our
[1:23:14] parents say it. That's just an
[1:23:16] imagination. But we're following this
[1:23:19] message because it's my substance. Oh,
[1:23:22] hallelujah. We're not making a rapture
[1:23:24] because the our pastor is making a
[1:23:26] rapture. That's just an imagination. But
[1:23:29] we're making the rapture because it's
[1:23:31] substance to me. It's substance to you.
[1:23:34] It's not just for the evangelist. But
[1:23:36] it's your substance. It's your faith
[1:23:39] that is overcoming the world. It's your
[1:23:42] revelation that is causing you to keep
[1:23:44] marching on.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's more than imagination, but it's
[1:23:49] a reality. But you remember the the man
[1:23:51] that come to Jesus that would have the
[1:23:53] lunatic son and and he would say, "Your
[1:23:56] disciples couldn't cast out a spirit,
[1:23:58] you know, and what would Jesus say? It
[1:24:00] was because of their unbelief." And
[1:24:03] brother Brandham says, "Now remember,
[1:24:05] they have the word. The word was flesh
[1:24:07] them and the word told them, I give you
[1:24:10] power." Amen. I give you power. And they
[1:24:13] had the power, but they didn't have
[1:24:15] faith to operate the word that was in
[1:24:19] them. Ain't that powerful? They had the
[1:24:22] power, but they only had an imagination
[1:24:24] of it. Oh, hallelujah. I said, Lord,
[1:24:27] don't let me come to church and have the
[1:24:29] power among us, but only have an
[1:24:32] imagination, but let me have substance.
[1:24:35] What would Jesus say? Jesus would look
[1:24:36] at that boy and would cast that spirit
[1:24:39] out. There was no there was no
[1:24:40] second-guing it. There was no I hope
[1:24:43] this works. But there was a substance.
[1:24:46] There was a confidence knowing if I
[1:24:48] speak the word over this situation, that
[1:24:51] spirit has to leave. Oh, and I believe
[1:24:54] that's not just for for Jesus Christ,
[1:24:57] but that is for you this evening as
[1:24:59] well. You see, who's going to win
[1:25:01] victories for you? I hope this is okay
[1:25:02] this evening. Who's going to overcome
[1:25:04] the devil for you? Your pastor can do
[1:25:06] it. Your wife can do it. your husband
[1:25:09] can't do it. You've got to give victory
[1:25:11] for yourself. Come on now. What are you
[1:25:13] going to do whenever it's midnight and
[1:25:15] your child gets sick? You got to pray
[1:25:17] the prayer of faith over that child and
[1:25:20] watch God come on the scene. What's
[1:25:22] going to happen? You know, I was telling
[1:25:23] Uncle Kashan earlier that that uh last
[1:25:26] year sometime that Ethan was scared by
[1:25:29] by one of the the the one of the young
[1:25:32] girls at our church would put a mask on.
[1:25:34] It would jump out and would scare him.
[1:25:35] He was terrified. And then ever since
[1:25:38] that that time, everything startled him.
[1:25:40] He he was scared of everything. Scared
[1:25:42] of the dark, scared when he would go to
[1:25:44] bed. And and one night and we always
[1:25:47] prayed with him and that that that would
[1:25:48] calm him down and things like that. But
[1:25:51] we forgot to pray with him one night.
[1:25:53] And we was out on the road and and I was
[1:25:55] sleeping there in there in bed and and I
[1:25:58] was awake. I guess I I think I was or
[1:26:01] then I seen a form come out of the out
[1:26:04] of the darkness, come up to Ethan. would
[1:26:06] grab him and would start to shake him.
[1:26:09] And you may say, "Well, that's just your
[1:26:10] imagination." But then Ethan woke up
[1:26:13] screaming, this blood curdling scream.
[1:26:16] And and and just to be honest, I got
[1:26:18] scared myself. You know, I I know of the
[1:26:21] supernatural warfare, but that was my
[1:26:23] first time seeing something real like
[1:26:25] that, but I couldn't get up and call dad
[1:26:27] and say, "Hey, Dad, come pray with me."
[1:26:29] I was across the country. I had to get
[1:26:32] victory. Oh, come on now. So I would get
[1:26:35] up and as I would pray with Ethan, that
[1:26:37] would go away and he would go right back
[1:26:39] to sleep. What was it? I had to find
[1:26:41] victory myself. Come on. I couldn't rely
[1:26:44] on somebody else. I couldn't rely on the
[1:26:46] preacher, my pastor, my dad, my uncles,
[1:26:48] my grandpa. I had to rely on the
[1:26:51] confidence God gave me. Not my
[1:26:54] imagination, but my substance that God
[1:26:57] has given me. Hallelujah. We need some
[1:27:01] parents that has victory for themselves.
[1:27:03] some mamas and daddies that can get in
[1:27:05] the trenches whenever whenever your
[1:27:07] children are fighting spirits. You get
[1:27:10] in the trenches with them and know what
[1:27:12] it's like to have victory. Not in an
[1:27:14] imagination because if you just have an
[1:27:16] imagination, your children can never get
[1:27:18] victory. But once you get victory for
[1:27:21] yourself,
[1:27:22] hallelujah. You remember the the story
[1:27:25] brother Brandham Mattel of the vision of
[1:27:27] the black mamba and it's incredible
[1:27:29] because he he would wake up and there
[1:27:31] was a demon there in the corner and what
[1:27:34] was that demon doing? Brother Brandham
[1:27:36] says it was accusing him saying he has
[1:27:38] no you have no power over me. He says
[1:27:41] you have no power with God. You're just
[1:27:43] a bluff. You have no power. And what's
[1:27:46] incredible is brother Brandon would tell
[1:27:47] us in perfect faith. He says there he
[1:27:50] says in order to have perfect faith you
[1:27:52] have to know who you are and have no
[1:27:55] condemnation against you. And that
[1:27:57] wasn't just for us. That was for brother
[1:27:59] Brandham as well. Because here's the
[1:28:01] prophet of God that has stood in
[1:28:03] discernment line after discernment life.
[1:28:06] Uh prayer line after prayer line. And
[1:28:08] yet the devil was still accusing him,
[1:28:11] trying to get his heart to condemn him
[1:28:13] because he knew if his heart would
[1:28:15] condemn him, he had no power over him.
[1:28:18] Oh, that's why the devil tries to get us
[1:28:21] to trip up and make mistakes because if
[1:28:24] your heart condemn you, how can you
[1:28:25] believe? But what would brother Brandham
[1:28:27] say? He says, I said, Satan, you're an
[1:28:30] offense to me. And I thought, glory to
[1:28:33] God, we need some more people like that.
[1:28:35] Too many times we get offended of this
[1:28:37] one, offended up that one, offended up
[1:28:39] this one, and we forget to get offended
[1:28:41] at the devil. But the Brandon woke up
[1:28:43] and didn't look at his wife and say,
[1:28:44] "Honey, you offend me." But he looked
[1:28:46] straight up at the enemy and said, "You
[1:28:48] are an offense to me." What would he
[1:28:50] say? Get out of my way in the name of
[1:28:53] Jesus Christ. And he left. Oh,
[1:28:56] hallelujah. I say it's time that we get
[1:28:59] offended at the enemy. Get offended at
[1:29:01] bitterness. Get offended at your
[1:29:03] complexes. Get offended at your
[1:29:05] insecurities and say, "Satan, you're an
[1:29:08] offense to me." What would Jesus do when
[1:29:11] he didn't look at he didn't look at
[1:29:12] Peter and would say, "You're an offense
[1:29:14] to me." But he says, "Satan, get behind
[1:29:16] me. For you are an offense to me." Oh,
[1:29:19] we need some people that knows how to
[1:29:21] fight. Not fighting one another, but
[1:29:24] we're fighting the spiritual enemy that
[1:29:26] comes against us. We know who we're
[1:29:29] fighting. Hallelujah. He's He's a
[1:29:31] conquered enemy already. Hallelujah.
[1:29:34] Then what would happen after that? He
[1:29:36] would say this here. And I laid there a
[1:29:39] little bit in the bed and started to
[1:29:41] raise up. I felt a re a real sweet
[1:29:43] feeling come over me. I thought I wonder
[1:29:46] if the Holy Spirit now Holy Spirit is
[1:29:49] now as close. And over in the corner, he
[1:29:51] says, "So help me. Here is my Bible over
[1:29:54] my heart." The sweetest voice I ever
[1:29:56] heard in my life said, "Don't fear to go
[1:29:59] anywhere. Don't fear to do anything. For
[1:30:02] the neverfailing presence of Jesus
[1:30:04] Christ is with you wherever you goeth."
[1:30:08] Oh, what a comfort to know that whenever
[1:30:10] he was standing in prayer lines, the
[1:30:12] never failing present presence of Jesus
[1:30:15] Christ was walking with him. And that's
[1:30:18] a comfort that we all have. Oh, don't be
[1:30:21] afraid to do anything for the word of
[1:30:23] God. For the ever the neverfelling
[1:30:25] presence of Jesus Christ is walking with
[1:30:29] you. You see, little did the devil know
[1:30:32] that not only Peter had the keys of the
[1:30:33] kingdom, but but brother Brandham had
[1:30:36] the keys of the kingdom. And I believe
[1:30:38] we have the keys of the kingdom. And and
[1:30:42] these keys ain't just a natural key that
[1:30:44] you put on your side that opens up a
[1:30:47] natural door, but it unlocks another
[1:30:49] dimension. Right? What what did Jesus
[1:30:51] say to to Peter? Matthew 16 and 18. And
[1:30:55] I will give unto thee the keys of the
[1:30:57] kingdom of heaven. Whatsoever you shall
[1:31:00] bind on the earth shall be bound in
[1:31:02] heaven. Whatsoever you shall loose upon
[1:31:04] the earth shall be loosed in heaven. So
[1:31:07] it's a key to the supernatural. And what
[1:31:10] enemy are we facing is not a natural
[1:31:13] enemy but a supernatural enemy.
[1:31:16] Hallelujah. So once we get the keys of
[1:31:19] the kingdom, we unlock the supernatural
[1:31:22] for our lives. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:31:25] Brandon, I'm going say now faith is the
[1:31:26] substance of things hoped for. the
[1:31:28] evidence of things you do not see,
[1:31:30] taste, feel, smell, or hear. But by
[1:31:33] faith, when he catches the word, it
[1:31:35] sends him into another dimension that
[1:31:38] makes it so real to him.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Oh. So, what is the what is the word of
[1:31:43] God? It's a power that unlocks the other
[1:31:47] dimension that you can step into
[1:31:49] heavenly places. And every enemy that
[1:31:52] comes against is defeated. Every mind
[1:31:54] battle that comes against is defeated.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah. Every little thing that
[1:31:59] comes between a spouse is defeated.
[1:32:01] Every little spirit that comes against
[1:32:03] teenagers, there's a key that has
[1:32:05] unlocked the supernatural. Hallelujah. I
[1:32:09] don't believe this king is just for New
[1:32:11] Life Outreach or just for TWWT or or
[1:32:14] just for whatever church you want to put
[1:32:16] in, but it's for Faith Tabernacle.
[1:32:18] Wherever you are, there's a key that I
[1:32:21] can unlock the supernatural. Brother
[1:32:23] Brandham must say and any church that's
[1:32:25] anointed with the same Holy Spirit is
[1:32:28] the Messiah at a a little smaller God.
[1:32:31] And someday when this body is
[1:32:33] resurrected, he says, I hope beforehand
[1:32:36] that God can get a hold of a bunch of
[1:32:38] people that'll manifest his power in
[1:32:41] every dimension that it's supposed to be
[1:32:45] in. Not just in this dimension, but in
[1:32:47] every dimension. Brother Brandham tell
[1:32:49] us there's many different dimensions but
[1:32:51] once there's a Messiah walking upon the
[1:32:54] earth a miniature Messiah there's
[1:32:57] authority in every dimension the
[1:33:00] authority is for over the dimension of
[1:33:03] Facebook social media television over
[1:33:06] the over the the dimension where demons
[1:33:08] live over the dimension whatever it may
[1:33:10] be there's an authority over every
[1:33:13] dimensional
[1:33:15] oh hallelujah see too many time we want
[1:33:17] to fight emission dimension, but you
[1:33:19] fail to look. There's another dimension
[1:33:21] that is coming against him, coming
[1:33:24] against your mind, coming against your
[1:33:26] spirit and man, but yet there's
[1:33:27] authority over every dimension.
[1:33:31] Hallelujah. There's authority over every
[1:33:34] dimension where we don't have to live an
[1:33:36] underprivileged life. Hallelujah. We
[1:33:39] don't have to live without joy, without
[1:33:41] peace, without our love, without grace
[1:33:43] one for another. We don't have to live
[1:33:46] under privileged life. Brother Brand,
[1:33:47] I'm going to say there's no need for us
[1:33:49] to live in underprivileged people.
[1:33:51] There's no need for us to live in a
[1:33:53] defeated state because he defeated the
[1:33:55] devil and took all principalities, all
[1:33:58] powers, and subdued them under his feet
[1:34:01] and they have no legal rights over you.
[1:34:04] He says, "We are Christians filled with
[1:34:07] the Holy Ghost. We don't have to have
[1:34:09] the devil dictate us. Christ delivered
[1:34:12] us a total deliverance." That's our
[1:34:15] heritage. That's the inheritance that
[1:34:17] has been given to us by the keys of the
[1:34:20] kingdom is we can battle and defeat
[1:34:22] every dimension that comes against us.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I don't believe that
[1:34:28] that we have to have to live here
[1:34:30] without peace and love one for another,
[1:34:33] but I believe that there's a key that
[1:34:35] has unlocked it for us. Brother Brandon
[1:34:37] would tell us this was the confidence
[1:34:39] that brother Brandon would have in the
[1:34:41] word of God. He would say if God told me
[1:34:43] to go to the presidential graveyard,
[1:34:45] right, and say raise George Washington
[1:34:47] from the dead, he says I would get the
[1:34:49] whole world, all the critics, everybody
[1:34:52] that that they had something negative to
[1:34:54] say and get them a chair and say, "Wait
[1:34:56] a little while. George Washington's
[1:34:58] going to come out of that graveyard."
[1:34:59] That's the kind of faith that we have.
[1:35:02] Hallelujah. That's the kind of faith
[1:35:03] that brother Brandon would tell us.
[1:35:05] That's conquering faith. He says, "We're
[1:35:07] not just imagining it, but we're
[1:35:09] believing it." And that's the difference
[1:35:12] between faith and imagination. Stack up
[1:35:14] the critics. Stack up all the believer
[1:35:17] sign people and say you just watch.
[1:35:19] There's going to be a bride that's going
[1:35:20] to make a rapture. There is a bride
[1:35:22] right now without spot and without
[1:35:24] wrinkle. They're walking in the flesh,
[1:35:27] but they're but they're not they're not
[1:35:29] they're being delivered from the power
[1:35:31] of that flesh. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:35:33] Brandham would say this here and he knew
[1:35:35] it would happen. Talking about Jesus. He
[1:35:38] could predict that it would happen
[1:35:39] because he knew it would hap would
[1:35:41] happen. And whatever he predicted come
[1:35:44] to pass. Now watch. Whatever he said,
[1:35:47] God honored what he said. Think of that.
[1:35:50] Whatever Jesus said, God brought the
[1:35:52] past. So he knew his words were God's
[1:35:55] words. He says, "Now look, the same
[1:35:58] scripture comes right back to us again."
[1:36:01] If you say to this mountain, he says,
[1:36:03] "Oh my, just let that soak just a little
[1:36:06] bit." And it's incredible because Jesus
[1:36:09] would would would pick up the the the
[1:36:11] scripture there in Isaiah, I believe,
[1:36:13] the spirit of the Lord is upon me. And
[1:36:15] what's incredible is Jesus would know
[1:36:18] who he was. And brother Brandon would
[1:36:19] tell us, he would tell us that he knew
[1:36:21] who he was by a prophet by a prophetic
[1:36:24] word. And I thought if if Jesus could
[1:36:27] find himself in scripture from a man
[1:36:29] with fallen human with with with
[1:36:31] mistakes and failures, what about us in
[1:36:34] this generation? We had a prophet that
[1:36:36] would speak over our lives and say,
[1:36:39] "There's going to be a bride marching in
[1:36:40] step." And who is that bride? I'm thy
[1:36:43] bride. That's conquering faith. Oh my.
[1:36:46] He says God honored what he said because
[1:36:48] he knew who he was.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. We know who we are.
[1:36:53] We're not some castaway, but we're the
[1:36:55] bride of Jesus Christ. Come on now.
[1:36:57] You're not some serpent seed, but you're
[1:36:59] the bride of Jesus Christ. You're not
[1:37:02] some wannabe. You see, the devil likes
[1:37:04] to throw complexes on us and
[1:37:06] insecurities and say we're a nobody that
[1:37:08] nobody likes us. Nobody loves us. But
[1:37:10] God loved you so much that he would give
[1:37:13] you an open book. And I'm going say you
[1:37:16] are the revelation of this word in
[1:37:18] flesh. You are the spotless bride
[1:37:21] walking in the day of Leoa.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Brother Brandon would
[1:37:28] say this here. Now, they didn't have a
[1:37:29] Bible that we got to help us along in in
[1:37:32] our crippled condition. They were rugged
[1:37:34] men was revealed to them by God and they
[1:37:37] stood right there. Nothing moved them.
[1:37:40] He says, "Now, do you think that we can
[1:37:42] still have that rugged faith?" He says,
[1:37:44] "If it's revealed to you, hallelujah." I
[1:37:47] believe there's some rugged Christians
[1:37:49] with some rugged faith. Oh my. You know,
[1:37:52] John would would tell us that that we
[1:37:54] have victor. Faith is our victory. And
[1:37:56] brother Brandon, and I won't hold you
[1:37:57] much longer, but brother Brandon would
[1:37:59] tell us, you may say that that John
[1:38:01] didn't didn't say that I have victory
[1:38:03] over the things I'm going through. He
[1:38:05] says he may have didn't say your
[1:38:07] troubles, but he says your faith is your
[1:38:09] victory. He says, you're right. He
[1:38:12] didn't he he didn't go through those
[1:38:14] things, but he also didn't exclude them.
[1:38:17] Oh, hallelujah. Because if he would say
[1:38:19] if John would say faith is the victory
[1:38:21] over your headache, what about cancer?
[1:38:24] You know, faith is the victory over
[1:38:25] cancer, but what about sugar diabetes?
[1:38:27] Faith is the victory. A victory over
[1:38:29] sugar diabetes, but what about anxiety?
[1:38:32] Brother Brandham was telling us the John
[1:38:34] Maloo all together. Faith is the
[1:38:37] victory. So you can put in that space
[1:38:40] whatever you're going through, faith the
[1:38:42] victory. Whatever the mind battles,
[1:38:44] faith is the victory. Whatever the
[1:38:46] sickness, faith is the victory. Oh,
[1:38:48] hallelujah. We've got a key. Let us
[1:38:50] unlock the supernatural. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:38:54] my. We know what we are, what we're
[1:38:56] doing here. A and and as I as I close on
[1:38:59] this scripture, I I just love this
[1:39:01] scripture. You can look at 2 Chronicles
[1:39:03] 14:11. And Asia cried unto the Lord his
[1:39:06] God, and said, Lord, it is nothing it is
[1:39:10] nothing with thee to help, whether with
[1:39:12] many or with them that have no power.
[1:39:15] Help us, oh Lord our God, for we rest on
[1:39:19] thee. And I thought that's the way to
[1:39:21] start a prayer. You know, it is nothing
[1:39:23] for thee to help us with them that have
[1:39:26] power or them that don't have power.
[1:39:28] We're resting upon thee. And then the
[1:39:31] next verse, 2 Chronicles 14:12. So the
[1:39:34] Lord smoked the Ethiopians before Asia.
[1:39:38] I thought, oh my, that ought to make God
[1:39:40] proud. He wasn't coming and saying, oh,
[1:39:42] this is going on, that is going on. What
[1:39:44] are we going to do? But he came and he
[1:39:46] says, Lord, it is nothing for you to
[1:39:48] deliver us. So, we're resting in that.
[1:39:50] Then God delivered him from the hand of
[1:39:53] the Ethiopians. And I said, let's let's
[1:39:55] open our prayers that way. Lord, it is
[1:39:58] nothing for thee to heal my body. It is
[1:40:00] nothing for thee to save my children. It
[1:40:02] is nothing for thee to give us a revival
[1:40:04] greater than ever before. It is nothing
[1:40:07] for thee to to heal a marriage. It's
[1:40:09] nothing for thee to save a rebellious
[1:40:11] teenager. It's nothing for thee to to
[1:40:13] get my body in a rapture. And we're
[1:40:16] resting in it. Hallelujah. We're resting
[1:40:19] in it. You remember the bron go beyond
[1:40:21] the curtain of time and was say I only
[1:40:23] preached what Paul preached and they all
[1:40:26] said together we're resting in it.
[1:40:28] That's what we're resting upon is the
[1:40:31] solid word of Jehovah. The rock of
[1:40:33] revelation. Heavens and earth may pass
[1:40:36] away but this revelation has produced us
[1:40:39] a rugged faith. And faith is my victory.
[1:40:42] It's rugged in the in the midst of
[1:40:44] circumstances. It's still standing like
[1:40:47] a stone wall.
[1:40:48] Hallelujah. Like Stonewall Jackson. He's
[1:40:50] standing like a stonewall. And I believe
[1:40:53] this pride is standing like a stonewall
[1:40:55] this evening. Let our musicians come
[1:40:58] this evening.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; There's a confidence. I believe there's
[1:41:04] a confidence inside of the bride of
[1:41:07] Christ. And it's incredible because you
[1:41:09] can look at the Apostle Paul. The
[1:41:11] Apostle Paul would say that he was on
[1:41:14] upon a ship and the Lord already told
[1:41:17] him that he was to stand before King
[1:41:19] Agria, I believe, or or before one of
[1:41:21] the kings or or something. And here he
[1:41:24] would be upon that ship and there would
[1:41:26] be a storm that would toss that ship
[1:41:28] back and forth. But he was already given
[1:41:31] a word that he was to stand and as he
[1:41:34] would go and pray, what would the Lord
[1:41:36] tell him? I believe an angel would come
[1:41:38] to him and would say, "If you stay with
[1:41:40] this ship, everybody, if whoever stays
[1:41:44] with this ship, they're not going to
[1:41:46] lose their life."
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And oh, it may get rocky, but stay with
[1:41:50] the ship.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's incredible because
[1:41:53] the Bible would tell us there in Acts 27
[1:41:56] and 42, "And the soldiers council was to
[1:42:00] kill the prisoners lest any of them
[1:42:02] should swim away and escape. But the
[1:42:05] centurion willing to save Paul kept them
[1:42:08] from their purpose. And I thought, oh
[1:42:11] my, the Lord has given us a word over
[1:42:13] our lives. And sometimes the enemy comes
[1:42:16] in like a flood, but the spirit of the
[1:42:18] Lord raises up a standard. He say, he he
[1:42:21] raises up a pastor or an evangelist that
[1:42:24] when the enemy comes with the purpose to
[1:42:27] destroy your life, there's someone that
[1:42:29] is willing to save you. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:32] There was a centarian that was willing
[1:42:35] to risk his life for Paul. And there's a
[1:42:38] pastor of an there's a five-fold
[1:42:40] ministry that is willing to get into the
[1:42:42] trenches with you. Whenever your faith
[1:42:45] might be beaten down, maybe your body
[1:42:47] might be beaten down. Maybe your your
[1:42:49] mind is having mind battle after mind
[1:42:51] battle. There are still men of God that
[1:42:55] is willing to save you and get up when
[1:42:57] they're fighting mind battles. still
[1:42:59] preach the message because there's a
[1:43:01] purpose over your life. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:43:04] And they're preaching a faith message
[1:43:06] that is producing faith muscles.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon must say
[1:43:11] faith believes that the word of God can
[1:43:13] never change. Faith believes that faith
[1:43:16] only rests in the word of God. So as the
[1:43:20] as the men of God preach the word, it's
[1:43:23] saving you from the purpose of the
[1:43:25] enemy. Hallelujah. and not one of them
[1:43:28] was destroyed. Every man was saved. And
[1:43:31] I don't believe it's going to be one of
[1:43:33] us that is left behind. It was it was
[1:43:35] Moses that was say, "We're not leaving a
[1:43:37] hook behind." He wasn't a compromiser.
[1:43:39] And neither is this five-fold ministry.
[1:43:42] They're not compromisers. These mamas
[1:43:44] and daddies ain't compromisers. These
[1:43:46] teenagers ain't compromising. We're not
[1:43:49] leaving a hoof behind. Hallelujah. God
[1:43:52] already said that the nation was going
[1:43:54] to come out with great substance. So
[1:43:56] Moses knew, we're coming out with great
[1:43:58] substance. We're not leaving one child
[1:44:01] behind. We're not leaving one hoof
[1:44:03] behind. And little church, we're coming
[1:44:05] out with great substance. You're not
[1:44:08] going to go without your joy. You're not
[1:44:10] going to go without your peace. But
[1:44:12] whatever the word has promised us, we're
[1:44:15] going out with it.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. uh those who've been to
[1:44:20] Pawne, we have a a lady or church called
[1:44:23] Sister Carol and she calls herself the
[1:44:25] Odin sheep and and Uncle Sean was was
[1:44:28] there in the earlier days and how that
[1:44:30] that the the church there in Pawne
[1:44:32] before they came into the message, you
[1:44:34] know, it was expanding and growing and
[1:44:36] good musicians and and singers and but
[1:44:39] when dad and uncle Sean would come into
[1:44:40] the message and start preaching holiness
[1:44:42] and everybody would leave, you know, and
[1:44:45] there's only one person that is left of
[1:44:47] the original church and that is sister
[1:44:49] Carol and she had told dad one day you
[1:44:51] know that you know whenever I step on
[1:44:53] the other side I'm going to be bruised
[1:44:55] and I'm I'm beaten down I'm going to be
[1:44:58] scarred and I'm just going to walk
[1:45:00] across the walk across into heaven and
[1:45:02] just follow you know and she was
[1:45:05] discouraged a little bit and dad would
[1:45:07] say Carol I don't think that's the way
[1:45:10] it's going to be because once we step
[1:45:12] into the rapture you're going to be in a
[1:45:14] new body you're not going to have your
[1:45:17] aches and your pains, all of the
[1:45:20] discouragements that you're facing right
[1:45:22] now is going to be all left behind. He's
[1:45:25] going to wipe away all of our tears.
[1:45:28] He's going to lift up the he the heads
[1:45:30] that are that is hanging low. Oh, little
[1:45:33] church, there's a promise that we've
[1:45:34] been given. You might feel low right
[1:45:37] now. You might feel weak right now, but
[1:45:40] keep on striving for he that has begun
[1:45:43] the work is going to be faithful to
[1:45:45] complete it. Oh, I say though we walk
[1:45:48] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:45:49] death, we fear no evil. For thou grace
[1:45:54] is walking with us.
[1:45:57] Oh my, little did Job know that God had
[1:46:00] confidence in him. And God don't put
[1:46:03] more on us than we can bear. But God's
[1:46:05] got confidence in you, little bride.
[1:46:08] God's got confidence in you, brother
[1:46:09] Amos. God's got confidence in you,
[1:46:12] brother Tim. Sister Martha, God's got
[1:46:14] confidence in you, Mindy. God's got
[1:46:16] confidence in you, Sister Jane. God's
[1:46:18] got confidence in you. He'll never put
[1:46:20] more on you than you can bear. He
[1:46:23] probably never promised that the cross
[1:46:25] wouldn't be heavy, but he promised he
[1:46:27] would be with you. He didn't promise
[1:46:29] that you wouldn't fight discouragement,
[1:46:32] but he promised he would be with you.
[1:46:35] David would say, "If the Lord, if it
[1:46:36] wasn't for the Lord on my side, where
[1:46:38] would I be?" Many of us can say that
[1:46:41] this evening. If it wasn't for the Lord
[1:46:43] upon our side, where would we be? We'd
[1:46:46] be in a nursing home or in a tomb
[1:46:48] somewhere in a grave or or in a prison,
[1:46:51] but it was because grace was upon our
[1:46:53] side. He had trust in us. Amen. What are
[1:46:58] you playing for?
[1:47:01] I am a child
[1:47:05] of God. Can we stand and sing this
[1:47:07] tonight?
[1:47:08] I'm no longer
[1:47:11] a slave.
[1:47:14] Can you just lift your hands and worship
[1:47:16] him tonight?

[1:50:32] through it.
[1:50:34] My fears are drowned. Hallelujah.
[1:50:38] Perfect love casts out all fear.
[1:50:42] You rescued me so I can stand and say
[1:50:49] I am a child. Can we sing that again?
[1:50:53] You split the sea of God.
[1:50:58] You split the sea so I could walk right
[1:51:04] through it.
[1:51:06] My fears are drowned and perfect for
[1:51:10] love.

[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:49] Brother Brandham said, "So all of our
[1:53:52] intellectual means nothing if there
[1:53:54] isn't a hidden power of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:56] there." Hallelujah. To break the hold of
[1:53:59] the devil. But we are wrestling match.
[1:54:04] We're not wrestling with fine dressed
[1:54:06] intellectual psychology,
[1:54:08] but we're wrestling with the power and
[1:54:10] the promise of God, which can break any
[1:54:14] hold on the devil at any time.
[1:54:19] Jesus, our Lord, proved it when he was
[1:54:22] Emanuel, God himself made flesh among
[1:54:24] us. And when he met Satan to show that
[1:54:28] Satan could be defeated by the word,
[1:54:31] every time Satan would come to him, he
[1:54:34] said, "It is written." Everybody say,
[1:54:38] "It is written." Can you say, "Amen."
[1:54:42] Amen. Another quote, he said, "God said,
[1:54:45] this is a man-sized job." So, he just
[1:54:48] brought it all down and come down
[1:54:51] himself. They won't have to do nothing
[1:54:54] about it. Just let them surrender to me
[1:54:58] and I will walk in them, talk in them,
[1:55:02] speak in them, work in them thoroughly.
[1:55:07] Amen. He said, "Oh my, that's it. I will
[1:55:11] do the work. Just let them humble
[1:55:14] themselves.
[1:55:15] Just let them empty up and I will defeat
[1:55:19] my enemy out there through them.
[1:55:24] Aren't you glad for that? God defeating
[1:55:27] his enemy
[1:55:30] through you.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; So when we the enemy's coming, we don't
[1:55:39] have to worry and fret.
[1:55:42] God has promised he's going to take us
[1:55:45] and defeat that enemy. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:51] I think it's how what did brother
[1:55:52] Brandham talk about Richmond and and
[1:55:54] Grant? How did Grant take Richmond or
[1:55:57] something like that or
[1:55:59] uh he said as he came to it. And I
[1:56:02] thought that's exactly right. How we
[1:56:05] defeating our enemy as we come to it.
[1:56:08] Amen. As we come to it. You say, "Oh
[1:56:11] man, these enemies I just don't know. I
[1:56:13] just trial." But see, you're just
[1:56:16] pressing on. You're just moving. It
[1:56:19] shows you're gaining ground. And so, as
[1:56:22] you as the enemy keeps coming, just
[1:56:24] defeat him as you as you come to it and
[1:56:26] just keep pressing on. Can you say amen?
[1:56:29] You love the Lord.
[1:56:31] His love to us shouldn't fluctuate. We
[1:56:34] should be so settled in on that love.
[1:56:38] Amen. for love come by faith. Amen. We
[1:56:41] certainly enjoyed the the word of the
[1:56:43] Lord. Amen. And uh love it when
[1:56:48] uh the minister studies the message and
[1:56:51] you can hear it because he's preaching
[1:56:54] it. Preaching what a prophet told us.
[1:56:58] And you know, as Josh said, there's this
[1:57:02] message is just a a boatload, if you
[1:57:06] want to say it, of promises to us. Amen.
[1:57:10] And I'm so glad for that. Amen. And uh
[1:57:14] I'm just looking forward to great
[1:57:15] things. I'm looking forward to Sister
[1:57:18] Hope coming in
[1:57:20] soon. Amen. And I believe it could be
[1:57:24] Sunday. coming in and just giving praise
[1:57:25] to God for healing in her back. I'm
[1:57:29] believing for Sister Martha to come with
[1:57:31] that testimony that there's no tumor
[1:57:33] there. Amen. I'm believing that. Amen.
[1:57:36] And and you know uh mom several of you
[1:57:40] have asked about mom. Mom uh had a
[1:57:44] consultation and a phone call yesterday
[1:57:49] and um
[1:57:51] uh doctor has given her a a good report
[1:57:56] said that the the thing her when when
[1:58:00] they first looked at the ovaries look
[1:58:02] just really bad and um the tumor or
[1:58:07] whatever looked you know was enlarged
[1:58:10] and all that. She said, "Your ovaries
[1:58:13] are good." Um u just just great. And um
[1:58:19] said the she said whatever that is. She
[1:58:22] said, "You can call it a tumor if you
[1:58:24] want." She said, "I don't know what it
[1:58:25] is, but she says it's just very little.
[1:58:28] It's just a little old thing." And she
[1:58:31] says, "It's not cancer." She goes, "I I
[1:58:34] can't 100% tell you it's not cancer, but
[1:58:36] if you put a gun to my head, I'll tell
[1:58:38] you it's not cancer." And so, uh, she
[1:58:42] said, "Don't worry about it." And she
[1:58:44] said, "Well, I think," and she did tell
[1:58:45] mom, she said, "Now, I I think you need
[1:58:48] to get it have operation. They want her
[1:58:50] to have a hysterctomy." And mom said,
[1:58:52] "No, I'm not doing that." She said,
[1:58:53] "Well, then don't worry about it then."
[1:58:55] And u said, "Come back in 3 months.
[1:58:58] We'll look at it and um if it's if it's
[1:59:02] not, then just start doing a yearly
[1:59:04] thing." But she said, "You're fine." So
[1:59:06] we just thank God for the report of of
[1:59:11] that. And um believing God just to u
[1:59:15] keep her and and u you know even sister
[1:59:19] uh Janice saying you know the doctor
[1:59:22] gave her a good report the other day and
[1:59:24] and uh on her colon and and uh the
[1:59:28] things that she was uh had been dealing
[1:59:31] with. And so we really thank the Lord
[1:59:33] for that. I just believe there's victory
[1:59:35] in the camp. Amen. I I just believe
[1:59:39] that. And and um
