[26:12] morning forus if you would uh just
[26:15] remember our pastors as he comes that
[26:18] the Lord would just use him in a mighty
[26:20] [Music]
[26:23] way I guess you could say there's
[26:25] probably nothing more unpleasant and to
[26:28] have a house full of insects that's
[26:30] tormenting you mosquitoes
[26:33] flies bugs of all types you know stink
[26:36] bugs we got to deal with them seem like
[26:39] year
[26:40] round and uh all these ear wigs and
[26:44] stuff like that you know and that's
[26:46] that's one side of it and then you think
[26:48] about this house that we live in all the
[26:51] pests that come around to torment God's
[26:54] children and we know that they're
[26:56] messengers of the devil
[26:58] uh really to trouble us and this human
[27:01] body is susceptible to these things it's
[27:03] got some built-in defenses but Satan
[27:06] just knows how to navigate around those
[27:09] defenses sometimes and attack our bodies
[27:12] but we're thankful for the power that we
[27:14] have the protection of the blood I
[27:17] believe there's power in the blood
[27:19] there's the life of the blood to
[27:21] certainly Deliver Us and to heal us and
[27:24] uh I also want to say that means this is
[27:27] a time of year that we
[27:29] certainly really I'm glad we've seen a
[27:32] star in the east we certainly have come
[27:35] to worship him let's look to the Lord
[27:38] this morning and also remember our
[27:40] brother as he prepares to bring the word

[28:01] there Co still hanging around Lord and
[28:05] still tormenting people Lord we've got
[28:07] all kinds of things on our houses to
[28:10] clean our houses to keep our houses tidy
[28:12] and Lord to disinfect oh God and Lord
[28:17] and raid and and so forth is that that
[28:19] we use maybe against insects but dear

[28:28] kill every devil lord to kill back the
[28:30] influences of the devil dear God the the
[28:33] life of the blood dear Jesus hasn't got

[28:45] Persuader against the devil it's a

[29:34] it from us Lord but we know still yet
[29:37] Lord we can wake up in the morning be
[29:39] sick but Lord that's not the final final

[50:31] for that first Christmas where would we
[50:33] be
[50:34] today amen and and Christ was nothing
[50:38] but the manifestation of God to declare
[50:41] his presence
[50:43] and uh I'm I'm so glad for that amen
[50:47] nothing like the presence of the Lord
[50:50] man there have been prophets come along
[50:53] throughout the ages and and they had a
[50:56] portion of the word but something
[50:58] different about this one amen for it was
[51:01] God manifested able to Incarnate himself
[51:05] Amen in in human flesh and boy the
[51:08] angels of heaven declared him amen they
[51:12] sang at his birth amen declaring to the
[51:15] world Amen what was able to happen amen
[51:19] I'm so glad for that and you know the
[51:22] prophet described it of how that that
[51:24] little baby there in that manger amen
[51:27] and all the Angels peing
[51:29] over to see God in human flesh to see
[51:34] what God looked like amen it was the
[51:37] beginning of of something that God would
[51:39] declare his mystery in his mind amen and
[51:43] they have no idea amen they just seen
[51:45] God as a light amen but never had they
[51:48] seen God as a human amen and they all
[51:51] just stood there breathlessly looking at
[51:53] the banners of Heaven to see that baby
[51:55] be there you know and I think of

[52:02] unfolded and it must be must be unique
[52:06] even to the angels to see what God
[52:09] really had in his mind amen that they
[52:13] just looking over and seeing us amen as

[59:09] she speaking of Mary said she just
[59:11] borrowed a womb that God used amen or
[59:15] she was just borrow a borrowed womb that

[1:07:11] chapter and I just want to read one
[1:07:13] verse there and then we're going to look
[1:07:14] in the Book of Luke the first chapter
[1:07:17] but in Romans
[1:07:18] 10 and verse 17 we've been speaking uh
[1:07:22] here out of these uh passages scripture
[1:07:24] but this morning I just want to read the
[1:07:25] 17th verse Paul says so then Faith
[1:07:28] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:07:32] word of God brother BR said or by the
[1:07:34] word made manifest Faith cometh by
[1:07:37] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:07:41] made manifest now in the Book of Luke
[1:07:44] the first chapter I want to read uh the
[1:07:46] beginning in the 26th verse I know this
[1:07:48] is a very a very familiar reading to the
[1:07:52] church as Believers here this morning in
[1:07:55] Luke 1 and verse 26 the Bible said and
[1:07:58] in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[1:08:01] sent from God unto a city of
[1:08:03] Galilee and to a city of Galilee named
[1:08:07] Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man
[1:08:10] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[1:08:12] David and the virgin's name was Mary and
[1:08:15] the angel came in unto her and said hell
[1:08:18] brother B said that means stop Thou Art
[1:08:21] highly favored the Lord is with thee and
[1:08:24] blessed art thou among women and when
[1:08:27] she saw him she was troubled at his
[1:08:29] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[1:08:31] of salutation this should be and the
[1:08:34] angel said unto her fear not Mary for
[1:08:37] thou Hast found favor with God isn't
[1:08:39] that beautiful words amen and behold
[1:08:43] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[1:08:45] bring forth a son and shalt call his
[1:08:47] name Jesus and he shall be great and
[1:08:50] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:08:52] and the Lord shall give unto him the
[1:08:53] Throne of of his father David and he
[1:08:55] shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:08:57] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:08:59] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[1:09:02] how shall this be amen seen I know not a
[1:09:06] man and the angel said unto her the Holy
[1:09:09] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:09:12] of the highest shall overshadow thee and
[1:09:15] therefore also that Holy thing which
[1:09:16] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:09:18] The Son of God and behold thy cousin
[1:09:21] Elizabeth she also shall conceive a son
[1:09:23] in her old age and this is the sixth
[1:09:26] month with her who is called Baron for
[1:09:28] with God nothing shall be
[1:09:32] impossible now I love verse 38 and Mary
[1:09:35] said behold the hands made of the Lord
[1:09:39] be it unto me according to Thy word amen
[1:09:44] be it unto me according to Thy word and
[1:09:47] the angel departed from her amen we ask
[1:09:50] the Lord this morning to add the
[1:09:51] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:09:53] you can have your seats here today I
[1:09:55] want to by the help of the Lord for just
[1:09:57] a few moments uh speak to you here out
[1:09:59] of these scriptures and just maybe to
[1:10:01] Contin on I think this will be the third
[1:10:03] part on faith cometh by hearing but this
[1:10:05] morning I want to just pull a portion
[1:10:07] out of that amen I want to talk to you
[1:10:09] about moving forward by Faith's power
[1:10:12] amen moving forward by Faith's power you
[1:10:15] know uh I want to read to you Romans 10
[1:10:17] and verse 17 out of the Amplified Bible
[1:10:20] I think it's a very powerful reading it
[1:10:22] means in Romans 10:17 the Bible said out
[1:10:25] the Amplified Bible so faith comes from
[1:10:28] hearing what is told amen faith comes
[1:10:31] from hearing what is told and what is
[1:10:33] heard comes by the preaching of the
[1:10:36] message concerning Christ amen Faith
[1:10:38] Comes By by what is being told and it's
[1:10:41] heard by the preaching of the message
[1:10:43] concerning Christ now in the message
[1:10:46] Faith 1953 brother said if we are God's
[1:10:48] children by Heir amen then Heirs of the
[1:10:51] kingdom and we're Heirs of Abraham then
[1:10:53] we should walk as our Father Abraham
[1:10:55] walked how many agrees we should walk
[1:10:57] amen as our Father Abraham walked and
[1:10:59] call those things which are not as
[1:11:02] though they were if God had said they
[1:11:04] were see if God said that they are then
[1:11:07] we don't know how it's going to be but
[1:11:09] God said so so we just believe it and
[1:11:12] move forward walking by faith we don't
[1:11:14] know how we don't know when but we just
[1:11:16] know it's going to happen so we believe
[1:11:19] it amen and we move forward walking by
[1:11:21] faith brother said what a beautiful life
[1:11:24] just think that Abraham and a hundred
[1:11:26] years old yet many disappointments many
[1:11:29] upsets he had like all the Christians do
[1:11:32] amen waiting on the promise but yet the
[1:11:34] Bible said that he staggered not at the
[1:11:36] promise of God through unbelief he said
[1:11:38] there's many things taking place famine
[1:11:40] and distress and things happen amen but
[1:11:43] Abraham did not stagger he still
[1:11:46] believed that God was going to give him
[1:11:48] that baby amen Abraham received the word
[1:11:51] of the Lord and moved forward under
[1:11:53] under the promise of God Amen calling
[1:11:56] things that were not as though they were
[1:11:57] and things that were as though they were
[1:11:59] not now the last time we spoke to on
[1:12:01] this subject if you remember we spoke
[1:12:03] about how that Faith amen from the
[1:12:05] innermost from the heart is the way that
[1:12:07] God Amen will bring things to past not
[1:12:10] from the outside but from the inside and
[1:12:12] I believe this morning that face power
[1:12:14] amen resides not in our intellects amen
[1:12:17] but it resides in our heart and I
[1:12:19] believe that it's not an intellectual
[1:12:21] Faith amen but I believe that it's a
[1:12:23] heart faith I believe that it's a Faith
[1:12:25] from the heart amen that brings God's
[1:12:27] word to pass now in the book of Hebrews
[1:12:30] 11th chapter you all are very familiar
[1:12:31] with this verse the Bible said that
[1:12:33] faith is the substance right of things
[1:12:35] hoped for it's the evidence of Things
[1:12:37] Not Seen he said for by it the elders
[1:12:40] obtained a good report and through faith
[1:12:43] we understand amen that the worlds were
[1:12:46] framed by the word of God so that the
[1:12:49] things which are seen were not made of
[1:12:51] things which do appear brother said what
[1:12:53] is faith is God by the spirit amen
[1:12:57] revealing to you something that he's
[1:12:59] going to do or he's promised how many
[1:13:01] will sayen right there that faith is God
[1:13:03] by the spirit revealing to you something
[1:13:06] that he's going to do or he's promised
[1:13:08] now if you only hear amen see Faith
[1:13:10] cometh by hearing but hearing is not
[1:13:12] Faith seed amen a loaf of bread is
[1:13:15] purchased for 25 cents but 25 cense is
[1:13:18] not the loaf of bread see hearing only
[1:13:21] brings the word that produces is the
[1:13:23] faith see when faith is the substance of
[1:13:26] things hoped for it's the evidence of
[1:13:28] Things Not Seen then you see you hear
[1:13:30] the word amen and God reveals it to you
[1:13:33] that it is the truth amen and by Spirit
[1:13:36] reveal truth can we say that together
[1:13:38] Spirit reveal truth God confirms your
[1:13:41] faith to God then that's the church that
[1:13:43] God built upon the rock amen that the
[1:13:46] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:13:49] amen I love this powerful quote brother
[1:13:51] said face power amen brings to pass
[1:13:54] God's revealed Revelation how many will
[1:13:57] agree amen that face power amen is not
[1:14:00] built upon the way things are not built
[1:14:02] upon the way things are looking but it's
[1:14:04] built amen upon God's word amen that
[1:14:07] he's not just able but he is more than
[1:14:09] able Amen to bring to pass the promise
[1:14:12] of his word Amen brother I'm speaking
[1:14:14] one time of a farmer how amen that that
[1:14:16] farmer will go out and sew a wheat field
[1:14:19] he said if he keeps digging it up
[1:14:20] looking at it he will never have wheat
[1:14:22] he said so you just got to sew it and
[1:14:24] let it alone amen you just got to sew it
[1:14:28] and let it alone see if you go out there
[1:14:30] every day and dig it up you're never
[1:14:31] going to have a harvest amen but here's
[1:14:33] a prophet giving you instructions you
[1:14:35] sew the seed amen and move forward amen
[1:14:38] amen you don't go back and dig it up and
[1:14:40] check it and and analyze it amen but
[1:14:43] when the seed is in the ground amen then
[1:14:45] you rest in the seeds ability amen that
[1:14:48] through the sunlight and the water that
[1:14:50] that seed amen is going to bring forth a
[1:14:53] heart Harvest and I believe amen that
[1:14:55] God has sent a message in this
[1:14:56] generation amen that we're not still
[1:14:59] going back and analyzing it and trying
[1:15:00] to pick it apart amen but that message
[1:15:03] is sown Amen in the heart of every
[1:15:06] believer in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:08] amen and we're not looking back we're
[1:15:10] not looking to the left or we looking to
[1:15:12] the right amen but we are moving forward
[1:15:14] this morning Amen in the power of God
[1:15:17] knowing he's able to bring to pass amen
[1:15:19] the promise behind the seed he said just
[1:15:22] let it alone and move move forward see
[1:15:24] amen it's up to God to bring it forth
[1:15:26] it's up to God to send the rain and if
[1:15:28] you it's up to you to accept God on his
[1:15:30] word amen and it's up to God to bring
[1:15:33] his word to pass amen that's a preaching
[1:15:35] point for an hour amen it's up to God to
[1:15:38] bring his word to pass it's not up to me
[1:15:41] it's not up to you it's not up to the
[1:15:43] pastor not even up to the prophet it's
[1:15:45] up to God Amen to bring his word to pass
[1:15:49] no man's worth any more than his word
[1:15:51] and God's not worth a bit more than what
[1:15:53] his word is and I say this with a
[1:15:55] challenge of faith that every promise of
[1:15:58] God Amen will be brought to pass amen
[1:16:01] that's a challenge of faith that every
[1:16:03] promise of God Amen will be brought to
[1:16:06] pass if you take the right mental
[1:16:08] attitude towards it amen and the right
[1:16:11] mental attitude is not a negative
[1:16:13] attitude it's not a questionable
[1:16:15] attitude amen but it is a positive
[1:16:18] attitude that God's word is able to
[1:16:21] bring to pass what he said it would do
[1:16:23] now you all know these things but
[1:16:25] brother takes time in 1965 Amen to lay
[1:16:28] out a beautiful Point amen that faith is
[1:16:31] a revelation from Goden you all agree
[1:16:35] that faith is a revelation from God and
[1:16:38] the anointed once at the end time he
[1:16:39] said what is Faith amen faith is
[1:16:42] something that's revealed to you that it
[1:16:44] is not yet but you believe it will be so
[1:16:47] you can't see it you can't feel it you
[1:16:49] can't see it you can't smell it you
[1:16:51] can't touch it amen but you believe
[1:16:53] believe it amen and because you believe
[1:16:55] it it's not yet but you know it will be
[1:16:57] amen see faith is a revelation of the
[1:17:00] will of God so by Revelation and the
[1:17:03] churches today he said they don't even
[1:17:05] believe in spiritual Revelation amen
[1:17:07] they believe in a dogmatic teaching amen
[1:17:10] of some system again in works is Faith
[1:17:12] Express 65 he said now Faith is a
[1:17:15] revelation from God right amen there's
[1:17:18] where I want to stay just a moment it's
[1:17:20] a revelation he has revealed it to you
[1:17:23] by his grace it's nothing you did you
[1:17:26] didn't work yourself up into Faith you
[1:17:28] ever have faith it's give to you by the
[1:17:31] grace of God and God reveals it to you
[1:17:34] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[1:17:37] whole Church of God is built upon the
[1:17:40] Revelation Amen in an audience of people
[1:17:43] he said when a prayer line comes through
[1:17:45] you'll find some and they're all good
[1:17:47] people amen but there's some that's
[1:17:49] trying hard to believe it they're trying
[1:17:51] to work themselves into it amen and some
[1:17:53] just can't do it at all and others is
[1:17:56] just by Grace it's just given to them
[1:17:58] amen now see there is a difference amen
[1:18:01] so you don't work your way into a
[1:18:02] healing you don't work your way into
[1:18:04] salvation come on let me just go ahead
[1:18:06] and preach to you amen Mary did not work
[1:18:08] her way in Amen to bring forth the
[1:18:11] promised son amen but Mary was
[1:18:13] predestinated amen by the faith of God
[1:18:16] from before the foundation of the world
[1:18:19] Amen to bring to pass God's desire Amen
[1:18:22] to provide an atonement come on church
[1:18:25] amen Mary didn't have the ability amen
[1:18:27] but God give her the ability amen Mary
[1:18:30] didn't have the position but God give
[1:18:32] her the position amen I'm way ahead of
[1:18:34] myself but I feel it here amen and
[1:18:36] there's another Mary on the Earth today
[1:18:39] amen we don't have the abilities we
[1:18:41] don't have the positions amen but we got
[1:18:43] a womb amen we got a heart and we got a
[1:18:46] faith to believe that if God said he
[1:18:49] chose us there ain't enough devils in
[1:18:51] Hell Amen to reverse the the choice of
[1:18:53] God let me just go and put that devil on
[1:18:56] notice amen I don't know how it's going
[1:18:57] to happen but it's going to happen I
[1:18:59] don't know when it's going to happen but
[1:19:01] it's going to happen I can't see how
[1:19:03] it's going to happen but I believe by
[1:19:05] faith through the grace of God that it's
[1:19:08] going to come to pass because God said
[1:19:11] so and I'm just going to move forward
[1:19:13] that's right I'm just going to move
[1:19:15] forward now amen that does it that's the
[1:19:18] real Revelation because faith is a
[1:19:21] revelation from God Amen brother will
[1:19:24] faith is a revelation from God it must
[1:19:27] be revealed first so before you get the
[1:19:30] Fulfillment you must get the
[1:19:33] Revelation before you see the
[1:19:35] Fulfillment of the promise you must
[1:19:37] receive the Revelation that is going to
[1:19:40] happen that's why the prophet said that
[1:19:42] the Rapture is a revelation and that's
[1:19:45] why the bride amen must have rapturing
[1:19:48] faith and rapturing Grace it's going to
[1:19:51] take Faith and and Grace to take a
[1:19:53] Rapture not rapturing works amen
[1:19:56] rapturing faith and rapturing Grace and
[1:19:59] you don't work your way into Faith amen
[1:20:01] if you got faith it's because God by his
[1:20:04] Sovereign Grace give you that Faith how
[1:20:06] about the reason why you got faith to
[1:20:08] believe that you're going to change your
[1:20:10] body is because God by his grace has
[1:20:13] deposited into your soul amen the
[1:20:16] ability to believe that with God Amen
[1:20:18] all things are possible I don't see how
[1:20:21] it can happen I don't see how gray hair
[1:20:23] can turn back back again I don't see how
[1:20:25] stoop shoulders amen can come straight I
[1:20:28] don't see how that loved ones that's
[1:20:30] been in the ground for years are going
[1:20:32] to raise Incorruptible but I have a
[1:20:35] promised word and that word is swn into
[1:20:37] my heart and regardless of how I feel
[1:20:40] regardless of what I see I'm going to
[1:20:43] let that word reveal I'm going to let
[1:20:45] that word take predominance into my life
[1:20:47] and I'm going to move forward brother BR
[1:20:51] said to the church the bride he in the
[1:20:53] Rapture is a revelation to her it's
[1:20:55] revealed to her see faith is something
[1:20:57] that's been revealed to you like it was
[1:20:59] to Abraham that could call anything
[1:21:02] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:21:04] him as though it wasn't so amen now you
[1:21:07] know Matthew 16 amen Jesus come there to
[1:21:10] the disciples and he said who do men say
[1:21:12] that I the son of man am right and the
[1:21:15] Bible said that Jesus asked him amen who
[1:21:17] do you say I am and out of all the ones
[1:21:19] that answer brother Tim amen Peter spoke
[1:21:22] up and said listen Thou Art the Christ
[1:21:24] amen the son of the Living God brother
[1:21:27] said now how did he get that he said the
[1:21:29] very next verse Flesh and Blood had not
[1:21:31] revealed it to him amen but my Father
[1:21:34] which is in heaven had revealed it he
[1:21:37] said and I say unto thee amen that thou
[1:21:39] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[1:21:42] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:21:45] amen shall not Prevail against you oh
[1:21:48] come on church amen the prophet said
[1:21:50] what is that rock it's a spiritual
[1:21:52] revealed revelation of the word of God
[1:21:55] Amen Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:21:57] church amen and the Gates of Hell amen
[1:22:00] could not Prevail against it he said
[1:22:02] down Through the Ages we've had Creeds
[1:22:05] and denominations and what more amen but
[1:22:07] the Church of the Living God just moves
[1:22:10] the same we've had Creeds but we're
[1:22:12] still moving we've had dogmas but we're
[1:22:14] still moving we've had divisions and
[1:22:17] fers amen but we're still moving amen
[1:22:19] because that someday amen the church in
[1:22:22] the minority now amen will come into the
[1:22:27] majority how's the church going to come
[1:22:29] in the majority he said when the
[1:22:31] redeemed of all ages amen rise to go
[1:22:34] with her to meet Jesus amen it's the
[1:22:36] Church of the Living God can I say this
[1:22:39] those who live by true Revelation amen
[1:22:42] will always be in the minority those
[1:22:45] that live by true revelation will always
[1:22:48] be in the minority Amen brother said a
[1:22:51] Baptist Minister call me of the day he
[1:22:52] said I want to straighten you out on
[1:22:54] your godhead he said you're teaching it
[1:22:56] wrong he said well sometime brother said
[1:22:58] right now is a better time than anytime
[1:23:00] he said cuz I got time to be right he
[1:23:02] said listen here Mr Brandon he said
[1:23:04] listen you teach it there's just one God
[1:23:06] he said I believe there's one God but
[1:23:08] it's one God in three persons I said sir
[1:23:10] repeat that again he said it's one God
[1:23:13] in three persons I said where did you go
[1:23:15] to school at and he told me the Bible
[1:23:17] College I said I could believe that amen
[1:23:19] you cannot be a person without being a
[1:23:22] person ality and if you're a personality
[1:23:24] you are a personality to yourself see
[1:23:27] you're a separate individual being he
[1:23:29] said well the theologians can ever
[1:23:30] explain that I said it's by Revelation
[1:23:34] amen it's by Revelation he said I cannot
[1:23:37] accept Revelation amen think about that
[1:23:39] a preacher amen said I cannot accept
[1:23:42] Revelation I said then there's no way
[1:23:44] for God to ever get to you amen because
[1:23:47] it's hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:23:49] prudent but it is revealed un babes am
[1:23:52] men revealed to babes as we'll accept it
[1:23:55] amen as we'll relearn it amen let me
[1:23:57] just say this I'm happy this morning to
[1:23:59] be a babe in Jesus Christ I don't know
[1:24:01] it all I don't have it all figured out
[1:24:04] amen but I'm like my sister Mary amen be
[1:24:07] it unto me Lord according to my word the
[1:24:10] only thing I can do is accept amen the
[1:24:13] message that the angel has
[1:24:15] sent Hallelujah the only thing I can do
[1:24:18] is accept amen the Angel's message has
[1:24:21] the power to bring the promise to pass
[1:24:24] in my life amen listen he said revealed
[1:24:26] the babes amen such as will learn I said
[1:24:29] there be no way for God to get it to you
[1:24:31] amen see watch the whole Bible is the
[1:24:33] revelation of God the whole church is
[1:24:36] built upon the revelation of God there's
[1:24:39] no other way to know him only by
[1:24:41] Revelation Amen to whom the son will
[1:24:44] reveal him amen Revelation brother said
[1:24:47] everything is
[1:24:49] revelation everything is revelation not
[1:24:52] to accept the Revelation now now let me
[1:24:54] preach you're just a cold
[1:24:58] Theologian and there's no hope for you
[1:25:01] amen if you cannot accept the revelation
[1:25:04] of the will of God Amen concerning your
[1:25:06] life you're just a cold Theologian and
[1:25:09] there's no hope for you amen but I say
[1:25:11] this Matthew said it like this he
[1:25:13] recorded Jesus words and Jesus said the
[1:25:16] the Pharisees are blind he said now
[1:25:19] watch in Matthew 15:14 let them alone
[1:25:22] they be blind leaders of the Blind and
[1:25:24] if the blind lead the blind they will
[1:25:26] fall into the ditch amen the leader and
[1:25:29] the follower will fall into the ditch
[1:25:32] you know what that word blind means it
[1:25:34] means mentally blind so they can see my
[1:25:37] education they can see by theology they
[1:25:39] can see by intellect amen but when it
[1:25:41] comes to the spirit realm they could not
[1:25:44] discern amen the word of God concerning
[1:25:46] their life now listen what the prophet
[1:25:48] said while the Pharisees were blind what
[1:25:50] made them so blind is they would not
[1:25:53] accept Revelation or the Vindication of
[1:25:56] the word the rejection of the Vindicated
[1:25:59] word is what caused them to move into a
[1:26:02] blind condition he said and that's the
[1:26:04] reason today amen that the churches are
[1:26:06] blind is because they won't accept the
[1:26:09] Revelation that's being Vindicated if
[1:26:11] the word says so amen and it's revealed
[1:26:14] and it's proven and still they won't
[1:26:16] accept it amen but I want to announce to
[1:26:18] you that we are not blindly out of sins
[1:26:21] we are not Bri Pharisees amen but we are
[1:26:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ that is
[1:26:26] following the message of the hour and we
[1:26:29] can say with everything in us today amen
[1:26:31] that Christ is not hid amen but he's
[1:26:34] been unveiled and he's in plain view
[1:26:36] he's in full view the Mighty God has
[1:26:39] been unveiled and is in the view of
[1:26:41] every believer here today and if you can
[1:26:44] see him you can accept him Hallelujah if
[1:26:48] you can see him you can accept him in
[1:26:50] the power of who he
[1:26:53] is now the Propet of God refers to this
[1:26:55] scripture Romans 16 amen out of him is a
[1:26:58] power to establish you somebody stay
[1:27:00] established according to my gospel and
[1:27:03] the preaching of Jesus Christ according
[1:27:05] to the revelation of the mystery which
[1:27:08] was Kept Secret since the world began
[1:27:11] the revelation of the mystery was Kept
[1:27:14] Secret since the world began amen but
[1:27:17] now is made manifest amen the revelation
[1:27:20] of the mystery was kept secret amen
[1:27:23] until now but it's now manifest and by
[1:27:26] scripture of the Prophet according to
[1:27:28] the Commandment of the Everlasting God
[1:27:30] made known to All Nations amen for The
[1:27:33] Obedience of faith can I say it to you
[1:27:36] like this the Revelation was being
[1:27:38] revealed so you could see it and by
[1:27:41] seeing that Revelation it would bring an
[1:27:43] obedience into your life of Faith to the
[1:27:45] word of
[1:27:46] God is that okay would bring an
[1:27:49] Obedience of faith into your life now
[1:27:52] you all know the scripture Colossians
[1:27:53] 1:27 to whom God would make known what
[1:27:56] is the richest of the glory of this
[1:27:58] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:28:01] Christ in you the hope of glory brother
[1:28:04] BR I cannot accept Revelation then
[1:28:06] you're a cold
[1:28:08] Theologian and there's no hope for you
[1:28:11] but look at Colossians 1 amen but this
[1:28:13] is the mystery among the Gentiles which
[1:28:16] is Christ in you amen the hope of
[1:28:20] glory oh God when the church had closed
[1:28:23] the door of Hope the power of God
[1:28:26] through the seventh angel revealed the
[1:28:29] mystery of God with Christ amen and
[1:28:31] opened the door of Hope to the believer
[1:28:34] and if you can see him and accept him
[1:28:37] that is your hope for your future the
[1:28:40] revelation of Jesus Christ is the only
[1:28:42] way we're going to overcome this layout
[1:28:45] of sin age brother said what is the
[1:28:47] mystery of God Amen God in
[1:28:50] you the Myst of God is God in you the
[1:28:54] hope of glory shining forth the baptism
[1:28:58] of the Holy Spirit again in Des Herman
[1:29:00] of spirit he said now watch and see
[1:29:02] where the gates of hell is against it
[1:29:03] ain't against the denomination the
[1:29:05] government recognizes that the world
[1:29:08] recognize his denomination but listen he
[1:29:10] said what's it against it's against the
[1:29:13] spiritual revelation of Christ being
[1:29:16] here now the same yesterday today and
[1:29:19] forever amen that's what it's against
[1:29:22] amen the gates of hell is against amen
[1:29:25] the revelation of Jesus Christ being
[1:29:28] here now amen in Bride form amen
[1:29:32] manifesting Jesus Christ the same
[1:29:34] yesterday today and forever amen what
[1:29:37] are you trying to get at I'm trying to
[1:29:38] say this amen Satan hates Revelation
[1:29:42] because when Revelation comes hope comes
[1:29:45] when Revelation comes Vision comes when
[1:29:48] Revelation listen Revelation destroys
[1:29:51] the plans of the Devil Revelation
[1:29:53] destroys the devil's agenda Revelation
[1:29:55] destroys the devil's plans for your life
[1:29:58] amen it opens a whole new picture a
[1:30:01] whole new outlook uh come on church amen
[1:30:03] because this message is not an education
[1:30:06] it's a revelation I've had people tell
[1:30:08] me brother Kevin they said man this
[1:30:10] message attracts all kinds of people it
[1:30:12] attracts some pretty strange ones and I
[1:30:14] have to agree I have to agree but you
[1:30:16] know why I say that is because this
[1:30:18] message is the only message that gives
[1:30:21] everybody a chance
[1:30:22] come on it's the only message that'll
[1:30:24] give everybody a chance that's why
[1:30:26] there's some strange ones that's why
[1:30:28] there's some high class and low class
[1:30:29] and that's why there's black and white
[1:30:31] and red come on church amen because this
[1:30:34] is a message of hope it's a message of
[1:30:36] Revelation it's a message of moving
[1:30:39] forward we've Stood Still why
[1:30:41] denominations argued the Revelation for
[1:30:43] years but now there's a bride on the
[1:30:45] earth who is moving by the pillar of
[1:30:49] fire she's moving forward in Faith amen
[1:30:53] Satan hates Revelation can I say why
[1:30:56] because he cannot Prevail over
[1:30:58] it brother Mark he can come against it
[1:31:01] but he cannot get over it he can come
[1:31:04] against the church but he cannot get
[1:31:06] over the church because the Revelation
[1:31:08] is in the church listen what the prophet
[1:31:11] said remember Christ in the true church
[1:31:13] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:31:15] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[1:31:17] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:31:19] church and defile it making it lukor
[1:31:21] formal and Powerless amen I might as
[1:31:23] well preach there amen defile the church
[1:31:26] making it lukor formal and Powerless
[1:31:29] amen but listen I think if there's some
[1:31:31] Revelation in there there ought to be
[1:31:33] some power I think if there's some
[1:31:35] Revelation in there there ought to be
[1:31:36] some fire I think if there's some
[1:31:38] Revelation in there there ought to be
[1:31:40] some movement of the Holy Ghost now come
[1:31:42] on I know why I'm talking about church
[1:31:43] amen cuz we go through some things and
[1:31:45] if we're not careful we'll just settle
[1:31:47] down and say well this has happened and
[1:31:49] this has happened and that is happening
[1:31:51] that's happened and this is the this is
[1:31:53] the outcome of the situation and if you
[1:31:55] receive the devil's interpretation of
[1:31:58] your trials and your situations then you
[1:32:01] will settle down and say I've gone as
[1:32:03] far as I can go I've done as much as I
[1:32:05] can do but if you will look me on the
[1:32:07] devil's interpretation and hear the
[1:32:10] voice of Revelation he will give you a
[1:32:12] new outlook he will change your
[1:32:14] perspective I know what I'm talking
[1:32:16] about amen cuz we just got well it's
[1:32:18] Sunday morning we might as well preach I
[1:32:20] say God bring back the spirit of
[1:32:22] perseverance in the church amen to learn
[1:32:25] how to move forward amen regardless of
[1:32:27] what's going on regardless of What's
[1:32:29] Happen I say what a prophet said he said
[1:32:32] God forgive our past amen and bless our
[1:32:34] future and I'm going to say this you'll
[1:32:36] never meet your future as long as you're
[1:32:38] trying to relive your past well if I
[1:32:41] would have done this different and if I
[1:32:42] would have said that different and if I
[1:32:44] would have handled this different amen
[1:32:45] you'll sit there and become a cold
[1:32:48] Theologian trying to discuss the
[1:32:50] statistics of your past amen rather than
[1:32:52] receiving the revelation of your future
[1:32:55] but there is a man here that can turn on
[1:32:57] the light this morning he can forgive
[1:32:59] the past and he can introduce you to
[1:33:02] your future by the
[1:33:06] Revelation I know what I'm talking about
[1:33:09] amen I'm not going to back up to that
[1:33:10] devil I refuse to back up I refuse to
[1:33:13] settle down and say well we've gone as
[1:33:16] far as we can go we've done as much as
[1:33:18] we can do come on church amen I'm just
[1:33:20] going to preach to you am me we may be
[1:33:22] fewer in number but we're greater in
[1:33:25] power come on the protag God said as she
[1:33:28] nears The Headstone is it okay to preach
[1:33:31] as she nears The Headstone she will
[1:33:33] become In His Image and the Very works
[1:33:36] of Christ will be manifested in her what
[1:33:39] are you saying brother Ander I'm saying
[1:33:41] amen the devil wants to take his
[1:33:43] interpretation and interpret your
[1:33:45] situation and make you formal and
[1:33:48] Powerless and lukew but if Revelation
[1:33:51] comes in that Revelation exposes Satan
[1:33:54] and Reveals His works the attempted
[1:33:57] destruction of God's people and the
[1:33:59] discrediting of God's word amen sister
[1:34:02] an I think that's a powerful Point amen
[1:34:04] I love how the prophet humiliates Satan
[1:34:06] and says the attempted destruction of
[1:34:09] God's people amen the devil would have
[1:34:12] destroyed amen but the Revelation amen
[1:34:15] caused his plans to fall oh God the
[1:34:19] Revelation caused his plans to full amen
[1:34:22] right in his face he attempted to
[1:34:25] destroy you he's attempted to destroy
[1:34:27] your testimony he has attempted to
[1:34:29] destroy your church he has attempted to
[1:34:31] destroy your family come on church amen
[1:34:34] but I want to say this he failed the
[1:34:37] devil failed that Devil's plans fall as
[1:34:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ exposed
[1:34:43] that devil and the prophet said the
[1:34:46] right down to the time he's cast in the
[1:34:48] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[1:34:51] stand in because he knows that if the
[1:34:53] people get the true revelation of the
[1:34:55] true church and what she is and what she
[1:34:58] stands for and that she can do the
[1:35:00] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[1:35:05] Army have we forgot that church have we
[1:35:08] forgot that we are not a sleeping Army
[1:35:10] we're an invincible
[1:35:13] Army we're not a defeated Army we're an
[1:35:16] invincible Army we're not a weak people
[1:35:19] we're a strong people we're not the
[1:35:21] overcome we're the Overcomers we're not
[1:35:24] the defeated we're the defeaters come on
[1:35:26] Church we're not the whipped we're the
[1:35:28] whippers come on it's time to put a
[1:35:30] weapon on that devil it's time to remind
[1:35:33] that devil who you are you are the
[1:35:35] manifested revelated sons and daughters
[1:35:38] of God that have been sent in this age
[1:35:41] Amen to expose the devil's plans come on
[1:35:43] church amen the devil started in the
[1:35:45] Garden of Eden and he had a plan for the
[1:35:47] human race brother will he had a plan
[1:35:49] for Humanity he had started through the
[1:35:52] fall in the garden amen but one day
[1:35:54] there was a little virgin named Mary who
[1:35:56] went to the whale and the prophet said I
[1:35:59] wish had an hour to preach on that whale
[1:36:01] he said she went to the whale he said
[1:36:02] when she got down there to the whale he
[1:36:04] said the problem was amen she had been
[1:36:07] oh God what can I preach he said the
[1:36:10] problem was amen that the devil's plans
[1:36:12] have been defeated you know what I'm
[1:36:14] talking about amen the devil put a cold
[1:36:16] Theologian in the pull pit one morning
[1:36:18] and he got up there and said the days of
[1:36:20] Miracles is over
[1:36:21] come on go listen to your Mery belief
[1:36:23] tables or sermons on the table Heen he
[1:36:25] said the preacher got up the rabbi and
[1:36:27] said now Jehovah fed us in the
[1:36:29] wilderness he was good to us in the
[1:36:31] desert amen but that Jehovah is not The
[1:36:33] Miracle Worker today he said he's just
[1:36:35] wanting us to come to church and just
[1:36:37] pay our ties and just be faithful to a
[1:36:39] church brother said when Mary and Joseph
[1:36:41] sat on the porch he said there was
[1:36:43] something swept over Joseph and said
[1:36:45] that was a good sermon until he denied
[1:36:47] the Revelation that Jehovah still works
[1:36:50] miracles he said and I just can settle
[1:36:52] for that I say thank God that Joseph and
[1:36:54] Mary could not settle down and accept
[1:36:57] the interpretation of some Co Theologian
[1:37:00] that for days of Miracles has passed
[1:37:02] well listen you may not like it amen but
[1:37:04] I'm not a cold Theologian I'm a Holy
[1:37:06] Ghost Field fire baptized message of the
[1:37:09] hour preacher and I refuse to let some
[1:37:12] dumb devil shut the door the miraculous
[1:37:14] in my face I may be laughed at made fun
[1:37:17] of but I still believe that's the
[1:37:19] Jehovah of the old the Jesus of the new
[1:37:23] I believe he still heals I believe he
[1:37:25] still saves I believe he still revives I
[1:37:28] believe he still works on situations
[1:37:30] that looks
[1:37:33] impossible Hallelujah I believe it
[1:37:35] because I'm not a CO Theologian I've
[1:37:38] accepted the
[1:37:40] Revelation now you all know probably God
[1:37:42] said she got to thinking and he said I
[1:37:44] just couldn't go there with him I say
[1:37:46] thank God I just couldn't go there with
[1:37:48] him and the devil's plans was in the
[1:37:52] midst of being folded he didn't even
[1:37:53] know
[1:37:54] it she went to the
[1:37:57] whale if the devil would have got his
[1:38:00] way she would have went to that well
[1:38:02] believing the days of Miracles was
[1:38:04] passed but when she got down there she
[1:38:07] believed that God was still
[1:38:10] Supernatural and Out of Heaven A light
[1:38:13] appeared and listen I believe it was the
[1:38:16] same light that you see in that picture
[1:38:18] out of Heaven A light appeared and said
[1:38:21] Hil Mary amen now the part of God said
[1:38:23] that means stop he said stop Mary here's
[1:38:26] what's going to happen the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:28] going to overshadow thee see what
[1:38:30] happened what she was carrying was the
[1:38:33] cancellation to the devil's plans
[1:38:35] without an atonement there was no
[1:38:38] salvation but if there was an atonement
[1:38:41] then there was a way being prepared for
[1:38:43] the Salvation of the human race he said
[1:38:45] now listen the devil's tempted
[1:38:47] destruction discrediting of God's word
[1:38:49] now listen what the prophet said he said
[1:38:50] he hat hates that he fights that he said
[1:38:52] but when they get the true Revelation he
[1:38:54] said Satan will be powerless before her
[1:38:58] he will be as definitely forwarded today
[1:39:01] as when Christ with stood his every
[1:39:02] effort to gain him over in the desert
[1:39:04] yes Satan hates Revelation but we love
[1:39:08] it Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:39:12] with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:39:16] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:39:19] brother Daniel but we will prevail over
[1:39:22] them brother said there is nothing of
[1:39:24] such prevailing power as the revelation
[1:39:27] of the word he said may God by his
[1:39:30] Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving
[1:39:33] and prevailing Revelation oh if the
[1:39:36] church can only get a fresh Revelation I
[1:39:39] say That's What Faith Tabernacle needs
[1:39:41] this morning is a fresh Revelation amen
[1:39:44] we've let our Revelation get stale we've
[1:39:46] let trials and we've let tribulations
[1:39:48] and persecutions and this happen that
[1:39:50] happen we've let it all get our
[1:39:52] Revelation so stale but I say this
[1:39:54] morning amen I'm not a cold Theologian I
[1:39:57] believe there's a Door of Hope I still
[1:40:00] believe there's a door of hope that can
[1:40:01] be opened up this morning and Christ the
[1:40:04] Revelation can step into the building
[1:40:07] and he can start at to pull pit and he
[1:40:08] can go pum to the back door he can go
[1:40:11] from the left to the right and he can
[1:40:13] refresh our Revelation come on y'all
[1:40:15] know what I'm talking about amen get
[1:40:17] that Revelation back to where no matter
[1:40:19] what you was going through you could
[1:40:21] raise your hands in the house of God get
[1:40:23] that Revelation back that no matter what
[1:40:25] the devil was throwing at you you still
[1:40:27] believed you was going to make it get
[1:40:29] that Revelation back that this message
[1:40:31] is the truth and everything else is
[1:40:33] false I say oh God Amen renew our
[1:40:37] Revelation this morning in the power of
[1:40:39] the Holy
[1:40:40] Ghost a fresh Revelation and become by
[1:40:44] it yeah a fresh Revelation and become by
[1:40:49] the fresh revelation The Living Word
[1:40:52] manifested we would do the Greater Works
[1:40:54] and glorify God our Father brother said
[1:40:57] very plain he said more than
[1:40:59] anything pray for Revelation now when it
[1:41:03] comes to prophecy I say this we cannot
[1:41:06] lean to our own
[1:41:08] understanding when it comes to prophecy
[1:41:11] we cannot lean to our own interpretation
[1:41:15] if we do we'll find ourselves subjected
[1:41:18] to the devil's plans now the Bible said
[1:41:20] in Matthew 7:14 therefore the Lord
[1:41:23] himself amen shall give you a sign the
[1:41:26] Lord himself shall give you a sign now
[1:41:29] watch this Behold a virgin shall
[1:41:31] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:41:35] his name Emmanuel now let's just go for
[1:41:39] a few moments back to Isaiah's sermon
[1:41:41] that morning let of you preachers know
[1:41:43] what I'm talking about amen Isaiah gets
[1:41:44] up and he starts preaching and while
[1:41:46] he's preaching the spirit of Prophecy
[1:41:48] drops in the meeting and takes over his
[1:41:50] mouth and he screams out these words
[1:41:53] Behold a virgin shall conceive let's
[1:41:56] just say it like this brother amamos
[1:41:58] amen I know I know you understand this
[1:41:59] cuz you're a fiery preacher amen you
[1:42:01] imagine Isaiah preaching and the whole
[1:42:03] church on fire and then he says
[1:42:05] something
[1:42:06] amen you all imagine Isaiah says
[1:42:09] something and then all of a sudden he
[1:42:11] says something and the whole church
[1:42:12] tightens up and he just takes off
[1:42:17] shouting y'all imagine like I say get up
[1:42:19] and everybody this Glory God hallelujah
[1:42:21] glory to God Amen preach and Isaiah says
[1:42:23] something and everybody sits down he
[1:42:24] says well glory to
[1:42:27] God is that okay is that are you with me
[1:42:32] when he said it there was a spirit of
[1:42:34] opposition that settled in the building
[1:42:37] listen now come on but he didn't stop
[1:42:40] preaching brother Bill he didn't stop
[1:42:42] when he looked back and the whole crowd
[1:42:44] was looking him like he lost his mind he
[1:42:46] didn't stop preaching brother Sean he
[1:42:49] went right back at it and said a virgin
[1:42:51] shall conceive and she's going to Bear a
[1:42:53] son and she's going to call his name
[1:42:56] Emmanuel he will be the savior of the
[1:42:58] world he will be the Mighty God he will
[1:43:01] be the Everlasting father he will be the
[1:43:04] Prince of
[1:43:05] Peace Judah you imagine Isaiah got done
[1:43:08] preaching he walked out the back door
[1:43:10] and there was Miss
[1:43:12] Isaiah Mrs Isaiah and she looked at him
[1:43:15] said Isaiah that was a good sermon but
[1:43:17] listen that's a little far out there
[1:43:18] don't you think you prophesied a lot but
[1:43:22] what you said this morning was a little
[1:43:24] that's a little ways out there a virgin
[1:43:26] shall conceive but see Isaiah just stay
[1:43:29] with
[1:43:30] it he said well listen the same God that
[1:43:33] brought the other prophecies to pass can
[1:43:35] bring this one to pass we're just going
[1:43:37] to Keep On Believing do you know what
[1:43:39] happened amen the opposition against
[1:43:41] Isaiah could not stop him from preaching
[1:43:44] because there had to be a recorded
[1:43:47] scriptural description of the Messiah
[1:43:50] when he come into fulfillment in other
[1:43:52] words when the Messiah come there would
[1:43:54] be no room for private interpretation
[1:43:56] there would be no room for question
[1:43:58] because everything that he was would be
[1:44:01] recorded in the scripture and he could
[1:44:03] say believe me or look in the scripture
[1:44:06] for they testify of who I
[1:44:09] am right they testify of who I am watch
[1:44:13] what the prophet of God said he said 715
[1:44:16] years before this ever happened Isaiah
[1:44:18] prophesied a virgin and shall conceive
[1:44:21] and shall bear a child listen there's no
[1:44:24] doubt that everyone in that age thought
[1:44:26] their daughter would be that woman
[1:44:28] because Isaiah said it think about how
[1:44:31] many young girls went home amen that day
[1:44:34] and their daddy said you're never
[1:44:35] getting married you're that virgin
[1:44:37] you're that girl amen but here's the
[1:44:39] problem amen before Isaiah prophesied it
[1:44:43] the Virgin womb was already
[1:44:46] selected before Isaiah spoke it in the
[1:44:49] mind of God the womb was already there
[1:44:52] it was already prepared you could not
[1:44:55] make yourself that virgin you could not
[1:44:57] work yourself into that position that
[1:44:59] was a position chosen by God now watch
[1:45:02] what the prophet says he said see 700
[1:45:04] years later and God didn't need nobody
[1:45:07] interpret his word Mary was the
[1:45:10] interpretation God had already by
[1:45:12] predestination brother Sean was all over
[1:45:15] this when I coming up amen already
[1:45:17] reserved to borrow Mary's womb amen and
[1:45:21] to establish the super sign amen the
[1:45:23] world was without hope but God by his
[1:45:26] word through the spirit of Prophecy
[1:45:29] chose a girl named Mary and reserved her
[1:45:32] womb by predestination to manifest the
[1:45:36] super sign he said he cried like a baby
[1:45:38] in a Manger he play like a boy in the
[1:45:41] street amen he toed like a man but yet
[1:45:44] he was Emmanuel and what is Emmanuel God
[1:45:48] With Us this is the super sign amen God
[1:45:51] dwelling in the creation he created the
[1:45:55] super sign he was so poor when he come
[1:45:58] to Earth he come to a borrowed womb of a
[1:46:00] borrowed womb of a woman and had to
[1:46:02] borrow a grave to be buried
[1:46:05] in come on church amen when he come in
[1:46:08] the world he come to a borrowed womb
[1:46:10] when he left the world he left in a
[1:46:12] borrowed grave listen a virgin shall
[1:46:14] conceive amen without sexually
[1:46:16] interception Jehovah borrowed the womb
[1:46:19] of Mary woman to perform that Duty he oh
[1:46:24] god Jehovah who owned
[1:46:27] everything are you hearing me he owned
[1:46:30] the Stars he owned the moon he owned the
[1:46:33] Earth but yet he still had to borrow a
[1:46:36] WB he said see to give an everlasting
[1:46:39] sign can't you see the real sign it's
[1:46:41] Jehovah become one of us Jehovah God on
[1:46:45] Earth as a fugitive a pilgrim in the
[1:46:47] land that he created he was rejected
[1:46:49] push laugh that scof that stumbling
[1:46:51] Stone the unbeliever a rock of offense a
[1:46:54] devil to the religious world but an
[1:46:56] eternal
[1:46:58] sign to the believer God With Us the
[1:47:03] super sign I think that God had in his
[1:47:05] mind it would be appealing the human
[1:47:06] being it is to the believer it is
[1:47:08] appealing when our God becomes one of us
[1:47:11] it is appealing to us when our God
[1:47:13] becomes one of us but to the starchy
[1:47:16] ungodly a stumbling
[1:47:19] block so when you preach this Revelation
[1:47:22] to the
[1:47:23] believer it appeals to the
[1:47:26] believer yes it does when you preach it
[1:47:28] to the
[1:47:30] unbeliever well it just makes him more
[1:47:32] unbeliever makes him more starchy now
[1:47:35] watch a prophet another thing the word
[1:47:37] was made dust right flesh and dwelt
[1:47:39] Among Us the Jehovah the word became
[1:47:42] human became dust and tabernacled with
[1:47:46] us the Everlasting sign shall never end
[1:47:49] now watch
[1:47:50] he said then I'm going to bring it to
[1:47:52] another point he's brought it now down
[1:47:53] to John 1 now let's bring it down to
[1:47:55] Abraham he said then again he must be
[1:47:58] the Seed of
[1:47:59] Abraham Abraham of course was the seed
[1:48:02] of Eve he was the woman's seed that was
[1:48:05] to bruise the Serpent's head but Abraham
[1:48:08] if you can catch it he had faith in God
[1:48:11] Abraham had faith in God now watch this
[1:48:14] which United the spirit of God with the
[1:48:17] Flesh of man that's where Faith come
[1:48:20] from
[1:48:20] what is Faith it is God by the spirit
[1:48:24] revealing something he's going to do or
[1:48:26] he's promised to do and oh God and
[1:48:29] Abraham was the first body that those
[1:48:32] two things made in and produced a
[1:48:34] manifestation of a miracle that's the
[1:48:36] why he could be the Abraham seed not all
[1:48:38] flesh but the uniting of the spirit and
[1:48:41] flesh together god making himself
[1:48:44] tearing out rooting out all evil amen
[1:48:47] bringing in the submission the flesh the
[1:48:50] dust that he created and live with you
[1:48:54] as a
[1:48:56] partner Jehovah coming down through a
[1:48:58] borrowed womb bringing your flesh come
[1:49:01] on Church bringing your flesh into
[1:49:05] submission oh God Amen and rooting out
[1:49:08] all evil and tearing out everything
[1:49:10] unlike himself Amen to live with you as
[1:49:13] a partner are you all hearing me if God
[1:49:17] is going to dwell in you the first thing
[1:49:19] he's going to do is bring our sorry
[1:49:21] stinking rotten flesh into submission to
[1:49:25] the word of God come on that's what he
[1:49:26] did when he appeared to Mary brother
[1:49:28] Matthew he appeared to Mary and Mary's
[1:49:30] flesh was against her she said it cannot
[1:49:33] happen it cannot be but when he appeared
[1:49:36] oh God when the angel appeared the angel
[1:49:39] told Mary these things shall be oh are
[1:49:42] you ready for this the Angel's message
[1:49:45] brought Mary's flesh into submission to
[1:49:48] produce the promise of the Messiah
[1:49:52] oh God think of it that God was
[1:49:55] borrowing Mary's
[1:49:58] body come on church that's a powerful
[1:50:01] fault God was borrowing Mary's body not
[1:50:05] making her God now he just borrowed the
[1:50:09] womb of the
[1:50:12] woman brother Timmy was not making her a
[1:50:15] God he was borrowing her womb the same
[1:50:19] as he bored borrows this body to preach
[1:50:21] the gospel from and the same as he bores
[1:50:24] your body to do the work that he wants
[1:50:26] to do through you because he still is
[1:50:29] Emmanuel assigned god with his people
[1:50:33] God living among his people the super
[1:50:36] Everlasting sign can I say this you're
[1:50:39] not the first one to need to borrow
[1:50:42] something come on you're not the F come
[1:50:44] on church God had to borrow a body to
[1:50:47] get on this Earth he didn't have one so
[1:50:51] he borrowed one now come on I love the
[1:50:53] definition of borrow it means to take
[1:50:56] and to use something that belongs to
[1:50:58] someone else so it does not belong to
[1:51:01] you it belongs to someone else but you
[1:51:03] ask to use it with the intention of
[1:51:06] returning it I could preach here for a
[1:51:09] second amen are you hearing me I
[1:51:12] remember one time brother Ian England he
[1:51:13] told me spander he said there's a book

[1:51:58] come back and I went up brother Ivan's
[1:52:00] house prend and I said brother Ivan I
[1:52:02] got you something it's like a kid in the
[1:52:04] candy
[1:52:05] shop he said I just love this book I
[1:52:07] love studying it it's got so many
[1:52:09] nuggets and I said brother Ian I got a
[1:52:11] question when I seen what the book was
[1:52:13] it was marriage and divorce I said
[1:52:15] brother Ian I said I got a question you
[1:52:17] know who borrowed it why can't you go
[1:52:19] get it he said I can't ask for it back
[1:52:20] he said
[1:52:21] I he said now listen now watch somebody
[1:52:24] borrows something and they say I'm going
[1:52:26] to return it now listen they have the
[1:52:28] intent to return it sometimes they don't
[1:52:31] sometimes they can't are you hearing me
[1:52:34] but watch this but it when you borrow
[1:52:36] something it means also taking in
[1:52:38] consideration the condition of it when
[1:52:41] it's returned oh God and there's also an
[1:52:45] agreement made that if it's returned in
[1:52:47] a lesser condition than it was when it
[1:52:49] was released that it will be repaid for
[1:52:52] oh god there will be a repayment come
[1:52:55] upon it listen my God will owe no man my
[1:52:58] God will owe nobody if my God borrows
[1:53:01] you oh God if my God borrows your body
[1:53:05] if he borrows your testimony if he
[1:53:07] borrows this church he's going to use it
[1:53:10] and when he gets done using it he's not
[1:53:12] going to hand it back falling apart he's
[1:53:15] not going to hand it back in a terrible
[1:53:17] condition he's going to hand it back in
[1:53:19] a better condition he's going to hand it
[1:53:22] Oh Glory to God come on church amen Mary
[1:53:26] was just a young girl going to school
[1:53:28] are you hearing me he come on now I'm
[1:53:31] not preaching against borrowing things
[1:53:32] we all have to do it but listen Mary was
[1:53:34] a girl going to school she didn't have
[1:53:36] no cares she didn't have no problems but
[1:53:39] brother Bill one day
[1:53:42] God one day God borrowed her body and
[1:53:46] when God borrowed her brother said the
[1:53:47] Angel's message changed the whole of
[1:53:50] course oh God in just a few seconds
[1:53:53] brother Sean she went from just being
[1:53:55] another girl in the local school in the
[1:53:58] local community to be in a spectacle to
[1:54:01] be an oddball to be a ridiculed To Be A
[1:54:05] persecuted to being a criticized
[1:54:08] individual and you know what caused that
[1:54:11] come on Church you know what caused that
[1:54:13] is God borrowed her
[1:54:15] body if oh god brother Branson if God
[1:54:18] had never bought borrowed her body she
[1:54:21] would have never found herself in that
[1:54:23] condition but when God borrowed her body
[1:54:26] he said Mary I'm going to use you to

[1:55:03] of the Holy Ghost he repaid her for all
[1:55:06] that he went
[1:55:08] through oh somebody shout hallelujah
[1:55:11] when God got done with her she had the
[1:55:13] Holy Ghost when God got done with her

[2:18:12] when you come on the earth you believed
[2:18:15] the word of God you knew knew that God
[2:18:18] would keep his word that's the reason

[2:18:27] neither will I suffer my Holy One to see
[2:18:29] corruption you believe the word of God
[2:18:32] on that one promise and went down into
[2:18:35] the dungeons of Darkness CZ you know God
[2:18:38] would keep his promise for David was a
[2:18:41] prophet and the prophet would not lie
[2:18:43] under the inspiration and I thank the
[2:18:46] heavenly father that that now we accept
[2:18:48] and I believe it and I go forward to
[2:18:50] challenge not for a show but for the
[2:18:52] glory of God that the men women boys and
[2:18:55] girls who are sitting here this little
