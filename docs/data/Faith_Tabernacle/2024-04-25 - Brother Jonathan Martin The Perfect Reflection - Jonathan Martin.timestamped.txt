[0:02] come forth on the Sabbath day which was
[0:04] the seventh day of the week which is
[0:05] Saturday but did you notice in this
[0:08] Memorial to wave it on the first day of
[0:12] the week the sheath which was the first
[0:15] of your seed that you planted when it
[0:17] comes up and ripen you cut down this
[0:19] sheath and take it to the priest and let
[0:22] him take it and wave it before the Lord
[0:23] for your exception that you are accepted

[1:17] evening time at the s o n amen s o in
[1:24] day when the son of man is revealed when
[1:28] all of the ages have ran out uh amen but
