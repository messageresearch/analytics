[6:42] And maybe we could sing that uh
[6:50] song. Oh, you have heard of little Mo in
[6:54] a bull
[6:55] rush. You have heard a fearless David in
[6:59] his
[7:00] slate. You have heard the story told of
[7:04] drinking. Can I get my monitors
[7:06] on the well? We often
[7:10] see there are many many others through
[7:14] the
[7:14] Bible. I should like to meet them all. I
[7:18] do
[7:19] declare by and by the Lord will surely
[7:23] let us meet them at that meeting in the

[8:07] air. Many things will there be missing
[8:10] in that
[8:11] meeting. For the mourers's bench will
[8:14] have no place at
[8:16] all. There will never be a sermon
[8:19] preached to
[8:21] sinners. For the sinner had refused to
[8:24] heed the call.
[8:26] There will be no mourning over wayward
[8:29] loved ones. There will be no lonely
[8:33] nights of pleading
[8:35] prayer. All our burdens and our anguish
[8:38] will be
[8:40] lifted that meeting in the air. Oh,

[9:16] the leading one at that meeting in the
[9:21] air.
[9:22] There the doubters will be missing all
[9:25] together. Oh, all the skeptics will be
[9:29] option on that
[9:30] day. There will be no grumblers present
[9:34] to disturb us. And the achans will be
[9:38] busy far
[9:39] away. There the saints will have his
[9:42] seal upon their foreheads. Dressed in
[9:46] rain and none but ransom ones will wear.
[9:50] Oh, all who have the wedding garments
[9:52] will be
[9:53] present at that meeting in the air.
[9:57] You're looking forward to that day.
[9:59] There is going to be a meeting in the
[10:03] air in the sweet, sweet by and
[10:07] by. I am going to meet you, meet you
[10:12] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[10:17] touching you will hear. Never heard my
[10:20] mortal ear will be glorious I do
[10:25] declare. Oh and God's own son will be
[10:29] the leading one at that meeting in thee.
[10:33] Can you turn around and shake your
[10:34] neighbor by the hand? When to be a
[10:38] meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by
[10:42] and
[10:43] by. I am going to meet you, meet you

[11:30] heard by mortal ear will be glorious I
[11:34] too declare.
[11:36] And God's own son will be leading one at
[11:41] that meeting in the
[11:44] air. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[11:47] of praise?
[11:55] Amen. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus.
[12:01] Sing his mercy and his grace. For in the
[12:07] manions bright and blessed, he's

[19:40] that sickness is getting around. Dad has

[19:45] but I think he's doing a lot better.
[19:47] Amen. So, uh let's just pray for for all
[19:50] those, keep them in our hearts this
[19:51] morning that the Lord would just touch
[19:53] them. How many has an unspoken request,
[19:55] but lift your hands? Amen. The Lord sees
[19:58] every need. We want you to remember our
[20:00] pastor that the Lord would just move in
[20:02] a special way this morning.
[20:05] [Music]
[20:11] Amen. Amen.
[20:14] Just before we pray, I would just like
[20:16] to uh just pass on a little comment. Uh
[20:20] as you know, of course, the meetings and
[20:22] much will probably be said about it, but
[20:25] uh driving the uh people around the golf
[20:27] cart, um I usually will ask if I don't
[20:30] know them, you know, where they're from,
[20:31] where's your home church, the pastor,
[20:33] and so forth. Kind of breaks ice and
[20:35] opens up a little conversation while
[20:36] we're going to and fro. But I just like
[20:39] to say that from a perspective of
[20:42] hearing many many many
[20:45] comments, the people are so blessed. I
[20:47] mean the the the mothers, the fathers,
[20:50] they our children just look forward to
[20:52] it every year. Uh it's just much has
[20:55] come out of it. I'm sure much will be
[20:56] said uh in the days to come,
[20:58] testimonies, but just from a perspective
[21:01] of what I've heard from the people, I
[21:04] just in behalf of the people, I want to
[21:06] say thank you to you all. all of you who
[21:08] have untirely put in hours and hours and
[21:11] hours of labor and the people, they
[21:13] really appreciate it. So, I just want to
[21:15] pass that on to you, Lord Jesus. How
[21:18] thankful we are in this generation to be
[21:21] showered with your blessings. Not only
[21:23] just the natural, the carnal blessings,
[21:25] but most of all, you've given us the
[21:27] word of life for this hour. And Lord,
[21:29] I'm sure much will be said, some will be
[21:31] said about the prophecy and the pope and
[21:34] so forth. God, we see we're when we look
[21:36] and we see events uh transpiring, modern
[21:40] events made clear by prophecy. We look
[21:42] back, we say, "Yep, that's what the
[21:44] prophet said. Yes, that's what the
[21:45] prophet said." So, we're just thankful
[21:47] to be living out the the days of
[21:49] prophecy. We know it's correct. We know
[21:51] it's absolute right on time. We're
[21:53] thankful, Lord, to be part of it. So, we
[21:55] just ask, Lord, that you'd give us
[21:57] further revelation and understanding. We
[21:59] We don't want to try to figure it out.
[22:01] The prophet said when you do, you might
[22:02] as well know you're wrong. But we we do
[22:04] see the signs of the time, the uniting
[22:06] times and sign. We're thankful to be
[22:08] part of it. Lord, each one of these
[22:10] requests much sickness here in the local
[22:12] assembly. But God, I know that you
[22:14] receive those 39 stripes on your back
[22:16] that each one of them could be made
[22:18] well. Touch them and deliver them. Lord,
[22:20] if they're streaming this morning, may
[22:22] they have be encouraged, receive faith,
[22:24] Lord. Bless brother Sean as he brings
[22:26] the morning message. Pray, Lord, it'll
[22:28] be spiritual food in due season. Lord,
[22:30] that we pull on the gift and may we be
[22:32] challenged. baby be en enhanced,
[22:34] enlightened, and further a revelation to
[22:37] us. We're so thankful, Lord, to be part
[22:38] of that end time bride. We love you.
[22:41] Thank you, Lord, for sending us Malachi
[22:43] 4. We love you in Jesus' name.
[22:45] [Music]
[22:49] Amen. Oh, there's nothing like the
[22:54] presence. There's nothing like the
[22:58] presence.
[23:00] There's nothing like the presence of the
[23:04] Lord. You can be seated. Sister Lisa K.
[23:07] Oh, I'm
[23:11] healed in his
[23:13] presence. Oh, I'm
[23:19] safe in his presence.
[23:24] Oh, I'm
[23:28] forgi and
[23:30] I'm the
[23:32] same. I'm
[23:34] changed
[23:36] forever in his presence.
[23:42] [Music]
[24:08] [Music]
[24:17] Some people talk of
[24:21] mansions and
[24:25] angels, glory lands,
[24:28] beauties untold.
[24:34] Walls made of
[24:36] shining
[24:41] jasper, streets paved with pure
[24:48] gold. But that's not what draws me to
[24:53] that
[24:56] city, but it's
[24:58] who I'm longing to see.
[25:05] When I
[25:06] finally make it
[25:12] through, just take me to the one who set
[25:17] me
[25:19] free and just let me look
[25:24] into his
[25:29] face for a
[25:33] million
[25:34] [Music]
[25:37] years and it will be worth it in
[25:45] all the
[25:47] trials and the tears.
[25:54] Just give me my crown long
[26:01] enough so I can
[26:04] lay it at his feet.
[26:08] [Applause]
[26:11] As
[26:12] long as Jesus is
[26:16] [Applause]
[26:17] [Music]
[26:19] there, that will be
[26:22] heaven for
[26:26] me. Don't
[26:29] talk to me of reward.
[26:33] [Music]
[26:36] for more than my reward. It will
[26:43] be to
[26:45] worship through any
[26:49] [Music]
[26:51] sages the one who gave his life for me.
[27:00] For
[27:01] since I came to
[27:05] know
[27:07] him, it's been my heart's longing. You
[27:14] [Music]
[27:15] see to
[27:17] kneel at the feet of the
[27:24] savior and thank him for all he's done
[27:29] for
[27:30] me. So just let me look
[27:36] into his face.
[27:41] at
[27:42] least a
[27:44] million
[27:47] [Music]
[27:49] years. And it will be worth it in
[27:55] [Music]
[27:57] all the
[27:59] trials and the tears.
[28:06] Just give me my crown long
[28:12] enough so I can
[28:15] lay it at his feet.
[28:21] [Music]
[28:22] As long as
[28:25] Jesus is
[28:30] there, that will be
[28:34] heaven for
[28:36] me.

[28:43] heaven for me.

[42:28] uh uh if if if you don't have people
[42:32] that are willing to labor and do things
[42:35] for the Lord, then then I guess it just
[42:38] all falls on the pastor and you become a
[42:40] one-man band. But, uh, I appreciate, uh,
[42:45] well, then if the pastor ain't willing
[42:46] to labor, then what do we do? We just

[43:25] Lord. Amen. I mean that that takes a lot
[43:29] just
[43:30] itself. Amen. Especially when you're
[43:33] driving a long ways away and uh but we
[43:36] certainly appreciate everyone here. Um
[43:40] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[43:42] prayer and then we'll just go into the
[43:44] scripture and I'll have you to have your
[43:47] seats.
[43:49] Father, we're so thankful for your love
[43:52] and your
[43:53] mercy that you have given to us, Lord,
[43:57] and in our lives. And we can look back
[44:01] since the time of birth, Lord, and see
[44:04] that you have kept us. You've watched
[44:07] over us, Lord. And many of us shouldn't
[44:11] be here this morning, but Father, you
[44:15] were always protecting us, Father, and
[44:19] guiding us. And here we set this morning
[44:22] with a heart to serve you a love and
[44:26] setting, believing the message, Lord,
[44:28] that you have sent in this day. And
[44:31] we're having the the hearts of
[44:35] anticipation for when we'll leave this
[44:37] old world. and be united with you
[44:42] forever. And Father, we just thank you,
[44:45] Lord, for all that you've done for us.
[44:48] Pray that you would anoint this morning
[44:50] and help me just to get myself out of
[44:53] the way, Lord, and that you would speak
[44:55] through uh these lips of clay. And
[44:59] Father, I pray that the words that would
[45:02] be said would find a resting place in
[45:05] each heart. and Lord that you would
[45:07] multiply the food and Lord that we could
[45:11] eat uh from your table today. We ask it
[45:16] father in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And
[45:19] amen.
[45:21] Um, if you'd like to turn with me to the
[45:25] book of Matthew, the 24th
[45:30] chapter, and
[45:37] um and then uh we'll read the 35th
[45:41] verse.
[45:45] And
[45:48] um very familiar scripture, but it says,
[45:51] "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
[45:54] my words shall not pass away." Amen.
[46:00] Praise the Lord. You can have your seats
[46:02] this
[46:04] morning. And
[46:08] um we um I trust everyone is feeling
[46:12] good. We uh the sickness is is going
[46:16] around. I uh I guess it was uh Sunday in
[46:20] church. I uh it hit me pretty hard. And
[46:26] um so of course Sunday evening you know
[46:30] after the meeting we always um um
[46:33] entertain the uh all the ministers uh
[46:36] from our that have ministered and
[46:39] uh and different uh ones and of course
[46:43] in our whole family and there's a lot of
[46:45] our family and uh so anyways uh but I
[46:49] snuck off while everybody was visiting
[46:51] and I just went up and laid in the floor
[46:54] and uh uh just slept. I felt bad. Didn't
[46:57] even get to say bye to hardly any of
[46:59] them, but uh I just wasn't feeling good.
[47:02] And then uh mom and uh Levi got it. And
[47:06] then uh uh different ones I'm hearing. I
[47:09] think brother Joe hadn't been feeling
[47:12] good. And then brother Shmayiah text and
[47:15] uh the whole uh household over there are
[47:18] pretty sick and brother Branson's sick
[47:21] and uh just just different ones and um
[47:25] so it's just Satan um you know he's just
[47:29] working over time. He knows his end is
[47:32] up and uh so let him do whatever he
[47:34] going to do. We we're all right. Amen.
[47:38] And we have the authority over him. And
[47:41] uh but uh you know uh the crowd uh there
[47:44] in the uh was uh not as big as in the
[47:48] past but uh the atmosphere was
[47:51] electrifying and uh uh the people came
[47:55] to um uh just to uh have a good time in
[48:01] the presence of the Lord. And uh the
[48:04] Lord didn't disappoint. Um he was there
[48:08] from beginning to end and um uh many
[48:12] lives were changed and it was just good
[48:15] to hear the testimony of brother Doug.
[48:18] Amen. And uh we we certainly don't take
[48:21] those things lightly. Our life is just
[48:24] but a vapor. And uh but to uh see that
[48:29] God uh done a miraculous thing for him,
[48:33] we thank the Lord for that. And uh but
[48:37] um you know there were some that found a
[48:40] deliverance. Um uh some received
[48:44] salvation, others received healing and
[48:48] um you know a pastor from Arizona text
[48:51] me and uh thanking uh us for the meeting
[48:56] and and all the labor and said that you
[48:59] know group of his young people several
[49:02] from his church came and uh uh there's a
[49:06] young man uh that needed the Lord in a
[49:09] in a real bad way and uh God just
[49:14] changed him. And he says he's just a
[49:17] changed young man. And another brother
[49:21] uh told his pastor said, "You know, I I
[49:25] had felt that I had crossed that line of
[49:29] mercy." And and said, "I just, you know,
[49:32] I've been coming to church, but just a
[49:35] just the ritual of it." M and he said,
[49:38] "I've just been so condemned and heavy
[49:42] burdened." And um he said, "But uh" and
[49:45] I I know the the man that that was
[49:47] there. Uh but he come through the prayer
[49:50] line and and uh I I've known him for
[49:53] years, and I've never seen him
[49:57] uh emotional, but he just come right in
[50:00] that prayer line. And you know uh uh
[50:04] brother Wendell you know told him says
[50:06] you know uh I I I love you and he says
[50:10] but most of all God loves you and the
[50:14] presence of the Lord just came and the
[50:16] man just dropped on his knees and wept
[50:18] and wept and he says just uh uh the Lord
[50:22] just came for him. And so we we thank
[50:26] the Lord for that. And um you know uh
[50:30] God delivered Sister Mindy uh Friday
[50:33] night and um uh going through you know
[50:37] things and and I'm telling you that
[50:40] Satan is fighting. I don't know what's
[50:42] uh happening. Um except a lot of our
[50:46] younger mothers
[50:48] um uh well I say a lot. Several that I
[50:52] know of in the message are fighting a um
[50:57] nervous uh about to have nervous
[50:59] breakdown and um uh losing weight and
[51:04] and so weak. uh two of them had to be
[51:07] carried out of the tent um uh this
[51:11] meeting and uh they're claiming you know
[51:14] their healing but Satan is trying so
[51:17] hard to take their lives and um and
[51:21] Mindy was fighting such a spirit as that
[51:25] and trying to uh but uh God intervened
[51:30] Friday night and delivered
[51:33] her and
[51:35] Um, I am believing with all of my heart
[51:39] that God's going to deliver these other
[51:40] young ladies, sisters, and and I won't
[51:44] mention the names, but if you if you
[51:46] ever find a heart to pray, pray for
[51:49] these these sisters. Uh, they got young
[51:53] families and and
[51:56] uh, Satan is just trying to destroy
[51:59] them. And uh but another young lady um
[52:04] uh sent word uh to my daughter that she
[52:07] had been fighting a a spirit of
[52:09] depression for quite a while. And uh God
[52:14] set her free uh this uh this meeting.
[52:18] And so we we're so thankful to the Lord.
[52:22] a young man that had received the Holy
[52:24] Ghost two years ago. Uh was at the
[52:28] meeting uh he received it two years ago
[52:32] at our meeting and he was here this time
[52:35] and brother Wendell was talking to the
[52:37] mother and and says I want you to
[52:41] introduce you to my son. And so as she
[52:44] got the the son and says, you know, two
[52:47] years ago, uh God just so delivered him
[52:51] and set him free and he's still serving
[52:54] God and he's still on fire for the Lord.
[52:57] And so we we thankful for that. I think
[53:02] uh the things uh that God is doing is
[53:06] eternal eternal things and I'm glad to
[53:09] be a part of that. And um I want to
[53:13] thank uh those of you who labored before
[53:18] the meeting. I know it was hard work and
[53:21] um uh and and then during the meeting uh
[53:26] to make the meeting go smoothly.
[53:29] uh you know just as brother Terry said,
[53:34] you know, just people were full of
[53:37] compliments and and just
[53:40] appreci that that we would uh have a
[53:44] meeting and and uh but all the labor
[53:47] that went in it and you know there may
[53:50] be those that didn't have money to eat
[53:53] and afterward and things like that and
[53:56] uh but we were able to provide the food
[53:59] for them and where they could come and
[54:01] enjoy
[54:03] um uh the the meeting. And so, uh
[54:06] received so many compliments this year
[54:09] on the food, the cooking, and um uh I uh
[54:15] I don't know who made the gravy. I can't
[54:17] remember, but brother Andrew says, you
[54:19] Glover, he said, "I never like gravy,
[54:21] but this was this this was good." And uh
[54:25] so whoever made the gravy, you you got
[54:28] brother Andrew Glover in your corner. Ah
[54:31] Brittany Daniel wanted Let me know
[54:34] Britney. So uh this explains this
[54:38] explains why he's having a hard time on
[54:41] a
[54:44] diet. I uh but no uh so uh just just
[54:49] everything
[54:51] uh uh the people just thoroughly enjoyed
[54:55] and I I hope you feel their
[54:58] appreciveness of everything uh that you
[55:02] do and um uh brother Will outdone
[55:06] himself this year and on that chicken
[55:09] and on that uh that smoked meat and I
[55:13] mean I now I had a a lot of guys uh you
[55:16] know and they're really into that
[55:17] barbecue thing but they really
[55:19] complimented that meat and so uh
[55:22] appreciate everything that you you all
[55:26] have done. I pray that you have gotten
[55:28] some rest and uh u uh and uh continuing
[55:34] to get your rest. Amen. And I certainly
[55:38] uh love you very much and thank you.
[55:41] Thank you for taking it on your heart
[55:44] for a vision. Uh the vision that u I
[55:49] have and um appreciate all those that
[55:53] were in in uh um if you could say charge
[55:57] of different things. um you know uh
[56:00] Sister Martha and I know she hadn't been
[56:02] feeling good and yet um uh taking on
[56:06] that task willing to do it without
[56:08] complaining or just uh and we I
[56:12] certainly appreciate that Sister Kim
[56:14] made it through. Amen. And uh uh with
[56:18] her knees uh hurting and and uh all the
[56:22] sisters really helped her very much and
[56:25] and uh she uh was able to just be the
[56:30] supervisor and uh make sure it all went
[56:33] well. And so this is good. And uh you
[56:37] know if anyone that have helped outside
[56:39] of our church you know and they're
[56:41] listening I certainly
[56:43] appreciate all the hard work. I mean,
[56:47] you know, Sister Mahala, you know, she
[56:49] just got married not too long ago and um
[56:54] but uh she she told Sister Kim, she
[56:57] says, "I'm coming and I'm going to to
[56:59] help you and um I'm going to work in the
[57:03] kitchen and um you know, and I I think
[57:06] maybe her husband, Brother David, didn't
[57:09] know if he could get off or not." So, it
[57:12] was kind of unsure thing, but uh he was
[57:15] there in that kitchen and uh he must
[57:18] have got off and they worked hard. Uh
[57:21] both of them guys and and you know, now
[57:24] if you know brother David, he's quiet
[57:27] and he's kind of laidback, you know, he
[57:29] just kind of sits in the corner. You
[57:30] don't know he's there. And but he's
[57:33] changed and uh I mean, he's just a
[57:36] different fella. and and and he was
[57:38] happy, you know, just smiling and and uh
[57:41] so I told him Sunday I I said, "David, I
[57:44] just really let you know I really
[57:46] appreciate." He goes, "I am so glad to
[57:48] do this." And uh he said, "I didn't
[57:50] realize just how much work was
[57:53] involved." And uh well, now you do. And
[57:56] thank you so much, Amen. for your help.
[58:00] and and it was a delight for them uh to
[58:03] be able to help as it is with the the
[58:06] others. And so we thank them very much.
[58:10] And um um and I uh also while I'm
[58:14] thinking of it, it is good to have
[58:16] Sister Brooke. And uh congratulations to
[58:20] Brother Junior, Sister Brooke for that
[58:22] baby
[58:23] girl. Amen.
[58:26] And uh uh God has just blessed them uh
[58:30] uh there and uh so we just congratulate
[58:34] them very happy for them and uh you know
[58:40] uh they she was having contractions at
[58:43] very early in the meeting and I think mo
[58:46] for the most part she come uh they
[58:49] wanted to be at the service and they
[58:51] would come to the service and while
[58:53] she's having contractions And uh you
[58:57] know I'm like man that's
[58:59] tough. And uh so none of us have any
[59:03] more reasons to complain. Amen. And uh
[59:07] but we appreciate them very much and and
[59:12] uh just everyone that that worked and
[59:15] and labored. And I I do uh I I want to
[59:19] say happy Mother's Day to you mothers
[59:22] today. And um I can't say enough I don't
[59:27] think enough can be said uh to you
[59:30] mothers of what you really mean um uh
[59:35] for uh in this generation. You are a
[59:39] rare, if I could say rare breed, a rare
[59:42] a rare thing. Uh, and I want to thank
[59:46] you for keeping motherhood alive,
[59:49] keeping it sacred, keeping it a a uh the
[59:53] way God made it to be. And um God will
[59:57] reward you for it. I promise you. And uh
[1:00:02] you may may feel like, well, I ain't
[1:00:05] done much. And you know, behold, you
[1:00:08] have you raising your children in the
[1:00:11] ways of God. And you, some of you may
[1:00:14] have your children that have way are we
[1:00:16] wayward, but you remember God would give
[1:00:19] you that promise that no matter how
[1:00:22] wewarded they are, uh God somehow will
[1:00:26] even if he has to put them on the
[1:00:28] deathbed, they will be there. They'll be
[1:00:31] saved. And uh so God gives that gives
[1:00:35] that to you as a promise to you mothers
[1:00:38] that have been faithful and true and and
[1:00:40] so don't get discouraged. Um uh and it's
[1:00:44] becoming less less um uh popular. Uh
[1:00:50] most women are looking for career.
[1:00:52] They're career-minded. They they they
[1:00:55] don't they're not interested in raising
[1:00:57] their children. Um, and then if they are
[1:01:00] raising their children, they're doing
[1:01:02] it, you know, without God. But, uh, God
[1:01:05] bless you very much. And I know the
[1:01:08] devil's after you. And, um, because if
[1:01:11] he can get you, then you become just
[1:01:13] another statistic out in the world. But,
[1:01:16] um, uh, but God promised that he would
[1:01:18] have a bride. He promised that he would
[1:01:21] have a people, a man, that would live
[1:01:23] his word. Ain't that right? So, I pray
[1:01:26] that God will bless you today. And uh
[1:01:30] but I'm going to I'm not going to deal
[1:01:32] with Mother's Day today. And um uh but I
[1:01:36] do want to look at something maybe that
[1:01:41] uh is going on in the world today. And
[1:01:45] if I have a title, it'd be recognizing
[1:01:47] prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:01:50] And um we know that every word of God
[1:01:54] must be fulfilled. Ain't that right?
[1:01:56] That's what Jesus said. He says, "Heaven
[1:01:59] and earth will pass away, but my word
[1:02:01] will never ever ever pass away."
[1:02:05] I think that's what makes us rest in the
[1:02:08] in this morning is to know that no
[1:02:11] matter what comes our way, no matter
[1:02:13] what trial, what storm that we are going
[1:02:17] through, God never
[1:02:20] fails and his promise remains true.
[1:02:23] Ain't that right? There have been
[1:02:26] critics down through time that have
[1:02:30] looked at God's word as just being a
[1:02:32] fairy tale. They've treated it as a
[1:02:35] fairy tale and and I I be honest,
[1:02:38] they're anointed of the devil to do
[1:02:40] that. Uh but Satan himself knows that
[1:02:43] God's word is true. Satan knows that. I
[1:02:47] mean uh uh he has seen God's word
[1:02:49] through every age fulfilled and and he's
[1:02:53] always been rebuffed uh in the timing of
[1:02:57] of when God's in the time of God's word
[1:03:00] being fulfilled. And so, but Satan is a
[1:03:03] deceiver. That's that's his deal. He's a
[1:03:06] deceiver. And so, he deceives the people
[1:03:10] in thinking that God's word ain't true,
[1:03:13] that it that it isn't going to be
[1:03:14] fulfilled and and all these things. And
[1:03:17] so, he gets people to looking at time,
[1:03:21] you know, time. Well, that, you know,
[1:03:23] that that happened a thousand years ago.
[1:03:25] God said it a thousand years ago.
[1:03:27] Where's it at?
[1:03:29] Uh uh then he gets the people looking at
[1:03:32] the impossibility of the situation,
[1:03:35] impossible for for the dead to be
[1:03:38] raised, impossible uh uh for for my my
[1:03:42] situation to change and and all of these
[1:03:45] things. But but God has proven time
[1:03:47] again that his word will be fulfilled no
[1:03:51] matter how impossible it is. and and so
[1:03:54] he's gotten the people, Satan's gotten
[1:03:56] the people so educated and
[1:03:59] scientific. Uh so to where that he can
[1:04:02] easily anoint them with
[1:04:05] unbelief. And and no wonder more more
[1:04:08] and more as I get older, I understand
[1:04:12] why brother Brandham said education and
[1:04:14] sciences of the devil. It's his tool.
[1:04:17] And we're we're this generation that is
[1:04:20] raising up uh so educated that but but
[1:04:23] in that education they're taught that
[1:04:26] God doesn't exist. They t they're taught
[1:04:28] that you know that there is no God that
[1:04:31] that you know it's all back in the days
[1:04:33] of yesterday and and such and and so
[1:04:36] they're they're leaning to the
[1:04:37] scientific and the achievements of
[1:04:39] mankind and all of these things. But you
[1:04:43] know throughout the Bible uh all the
[1:04:46] prophets that God sent uh to the earth
[1:04:50] were
[1:04:51] uneducated and so uh educated people and
[1:04:54] and and for the majority of them can't
[1:04:57] understand or can't accept uneducated
[1:05:00] things just like Moses you know uh uh or
[1:05:04] Noah Noah's message it it was an
[1:05:07] uneducated message. It it went against
[1:05:09] everyone that was educated and and it
[1:05:12] went against it was brother Brown said
[1:05:14] it's an unscientific unscientific
[1:05:17] message. So it went against everything
[1:05:19] that science was saying but but yet
[1:05:22] God's word was right. Amen. And it took
[1:05:25] 120 years for it to happen. But God
[1:05:28] fulfilled his word. But it was hard for
[1:05:31] the people to believe the prophets and
[1:05:33] their message. And it's still hard for
[1:05:36] them to believe this. Amen. But second
[1:05:39] Peter 3:3, it tells us, knowing this
[1:05:42] first, that there shall come in the last
[1:05:45] days scoffers walking after their own
[1:05:47] lust, saying, "Where is the promise of
[1:05:50] his coming? For since the fathers fell
[1:05:52] asleep, all things continue as they were
[1:05:55] from the beginning of creation." Ain't
[1:05:57] that right? So, so it's scoffers that
[1:05:59] are looking and and they're looking and
[1:06:02] saying, "Where's the prophecies?" Amen.
[1:06:04] Where's the promise of all this? and and
[1:06:06] and these things and and and uh uh
[1:06:10] Satan, you know, gives the people a
[1:06:12] carnal view of all the events that are
[1:06:15] happening around the world and and uh
[1:06:18] maybe uh they look at the political
[1:06:21] events that are happening or the
[1:06:24] religious events that are happening uh
[1:06:26] the events even in nature and even
[1:06:29] scientific events and they look at it by
[1:06:32] a carnal perception and they have a
[1:06:35] carnal interpretation. ation and yet
[1:06:38] they're saying, "Where is God?" You
[1:06:39] know, if God said he's going to do this,
[1:06:41] then where's it at? And and all of these
[1:06:44] things. And so, uh um uh they might have
[1:06:48] a political explanation or they might
[1:06:50] have an education educated explanation
[1:06:54] or scientific or maybe a a religious
[1:06:58] explanation without having a true
[1:07:01] revelation of what's happening. And so
[1:07:04] it causes the people to miss what God is
[1:07:07] doing. Ain't that right? But
[1:07:09] nevertheless, God is fulfilling his
[1:07:11] word. He promised he would. And so he he
[1:07:15] it will. Amen. Now, prophecy, as we
[1:07:18] know, isn't always fulfilled the moment
[1:07:20] that God that God speaks it. He declares
[1:07:24] that he's going to do something. It it
[1:07:26] it took uh what 4,000 years before
[1:07:29] Christ came. But but God fulfilled the
[1:07:32] word anyways. Yet that prophecy was
[1:07:35] laying there all them years. But God
[1:07:38] remembered the prophecy. Now you know
[1:07:42] um Ecclesiastes 3 and1 it says to
[1:07:46] everything there is a season and a time
[1:07:48] to every purpose under the heaven. So,
[1:07:51] there's a time to be born, a time to
[1:07:53] die, a time to plant, a time to pluck up
[1:07:56] that which has been planted. A time to
[1:07:59] kill, a time to heal, a time to break
[1:08:01] up, a time to build, a time to weep, a
[1:08:04] time to laugh. You understand what I'm
[1:08:06] saying? It's not all time to build
[1:08:09] there. There's times to break down.
[1:08:11] There's not every season is uh a time of
[1:08:14] laughter. There's a time of weeping.
[1:08:17] There's a time to mourn, a time to
[1:08:19] dance, a time to cast away stones, and a
[1:08:22] time together the stones together. See,
[1:08:25] so there's a season for all things.
[1:08:28] Ain't that right? And prophecy must be
[1:08:32] fulfilled in its right season. Amen.
[1:08:36] Prophecy must be fulfilled in its right
[1:08:39] season. God promised to scatter Israel.
[1:08:42] Amen. That was a season, a season of
[1:08:44] scattering. But he also promised to
[1:08:46] gather Israel. And so you couldn't look
[1:08:49] at Israel and try to gather him in a
[1:08:51] season of scattering. It wouldn't have
[1:08:54] worked. Ain't that right? But when the
[1:08:57] season is right, watch the supernatural
[1:08:59] come and the gathering becomes a
[1:09:02] supernatural thing. Even though God uses
[1:09:05] natural events and he uses whatever,
[1:09:08] it's a supernatural behind the natural.
[1:09:12] Do you believe that?
[1:09:13] But so prophecy must be fulfilled in the
[1:09:17] right season. You know those who love
[1:09:20] Jesus uh when he walked the earth and
[1:09:22] well they tried the prophet said they
[1:09:24] tried to force him to take the throne
[1:09:27] and and and remember thou uh uh blind
[1:09:30] Barnameus and thou son of David and the
[1:09:32] the the cifan woman or whatever you how
[1:09:35] you'd pronounce that uh you know called
[1:09:38] and s thou son of David. He said, "Well,
[1:09:40] they were trying to force him to take
[1:09:42] the throne." He said, "Even Pilate asked
[1:09:45] him, "Art thou the king?" and and these
[1:09:48] things, but Jesus knew the scriptures
[1:09:51] and knew that it wasn't the season to
[1:09:54] take the throne. It was a different
[1:09:57] season. Ain't that right? It was a
[1:09:59] season that he would take u uh uh give
[1:10:02] up the throne and and and go to Calvary.
[1:10:05] It was a different season. But
[1:10:09] see, just as he knew, Amen. when Satan
[1:10:13] offered Amen uh him to uh the kingdoms
[1:10:17] of the earth, Jesus was the one that
[1:10:19] knew it wasn't the season to inherit the
[1:10:21] kingdoms of the earth, but he knew he
[1:10:24] would inherit the kingdoms. It just
[1:10:26] wasn't the season for it. Can you say
[1:10:29] amen? So, the prophecies had to be
[1:10:33] fulfilled in its right season. Now,
[1:10:37] Brother Brandham said, you know, when
[1:10:39] you see something in the Bible that
[1:10:40] sounds just a little bit mystic and a
[1:10:43] little superstitious to you, just give
[1:10:45] God a little bit of time. Give God a
[1:10:48] little bit of time. God's in no hurry.
[1:10:51] We're the one that gets in the hurry.
[1:10:53] Just give God just a little bit of time
[1:10:56] and you'll see the old prophetic wheels
[1:10:59] cogs run right up into the picture.
[1:11:02] It'll develop just like the bringing up
[1:11:05] of a pitcher. Ain't that right? See, so
[1:11:08] then God always fulfills his word when
[1:11:12] the season is ripe. It It didn't look
[1:11:14] like God was going to fulfill his word
[1:11:16] in Noah's day, but he did. It didn't
[1:11:18] look like he was going to fulfill his
[1:11:21] word. Amen. In in uh uh um Abraham uh to
[1:11:26] Abraham. But he did. It didn't look like
[1:11:28] he was going to fulfill his word to Job.
[1:11:30] Amen. But he did. Amen. it it didn't
[1:11:34] look like he was going to fulfill his
[1:11:35] word uh to Eve. Amen. When he spoke to
[1:11:39] her and said, "Thy seed shall bruise the
[1:11:42] serpent's head." Amen. Uh and it didn't
[1:11:45] look like it would ever be fulfilled,
[1:11:46] but it was. Amen. See, it didn't look
[1:11:49] like he was going to fulfill his word to
[1:11:51] Joseph, but he did. And the Bible tells
[1:11:54] us that the word of the Lord tried
[1:11:57] Joseph until, everybody say until. until
[1:12:01] the time that his word came. Ain't that
[1:12:05] right? See, it had to be in the right
[1:12:08] season. Amen. Many years ago, God
[1:12:11] foretold of the different seasons that
[1:12:13] the church would go through. Amen. This
[1:12:16] New Testament church. And and so the
[1:12:19] message that we have received of God in
[1:12:22] this last day uh of uh through the
[1:12:25] prophet of Malachi 4 has enabled us to
[1:12:29] understand the seasons of the past.
[1:12:32] Amen. And as well as the season that we
[1:12:36] are living in. The church ages have been
[1:12:39] revealed to us. So we're not looking at
[1:12:42] symbols and we're not looking at it
[1:12:44] through a glass darkly anymore. But we
[1:12:47] can look back through time and say, "Oh,
[1:12:49] it was a season for this. It was a
[1:12:51] season for this. A season of planning, a
[1:12:54] season of dying and rotting." Amen.
[1:12:56] Ain't that right? A season of coming up
[1:12:59] out of the ground. A season of maturity.
[1:13:02] It it was seasons and and and so but we
[1:13:05] were able to understand what Satan done
[1:13:09] and what God uh has done in each age.
[1:13:14] The opening of the seals has revealed to
[1:13:16] us the meaning of the four different
[1:13:19] colored horses. Uh and of course,
[1:13:22] brother Brandon, you know, these were
[1:13:23] beast u uh uh which represents power.
[1:13:27] Four different powers. And and that
[1:13:30] there was a a horse rider, a rider that
[1:13:33] rode each of these horses. Ain't that
[1:13:36] right? And and and we know that through
[1:13:39] the opening of the word now that it
[1:13:42] wasn't Christ riding, amen, that went
[1:13:44] forth to ride. It was the antichrist
[1:13:48] that had went forth to ride through the
[1:13:50] ages. Ain't that right? And so we have
[1:13:53] seen the effect. Amen. Uh uh that each
[1:13:57] of these powers had on the people. Amen.
[1:14:01] uh that that Antichrist, he he the
[1:14:03] spirit of antichrist, he rode uh the
[1:14:06] white horse, amen, a power for a season.
[1:14:09] And then he switched and went to the
[1:14:12] black horse, another power for a season.
[1:14:15] And then he went to the other beast uh a
[1:14:18] leopard with a man's uh head uh uh for a
[1:14:22] season. And then uh uh and each of these
[1:14:25] powers had different uh effects. Ain't
[1:14:27] that right? Now he's riding uh uh the
[1:14:31] pale horse. How many believes that?
[1:14:33] Amen. He's riding the pale horse. And we
[1:14:36] have this understanding by the message
[1:14:38] of the hour. And we see the season that
[1:14:42] we're in. Amen. And death and hell
[1:14:45] followed him.
[1:14:47] Ain't that right?
[1:14:50] And so, but then there's also four
[1:14:52] different beasts that God sent to the
[1:14:54] true church. the lion, the ox, the
[1:14:57] leopard with the face of a man, and the
[1:14:59] eagle. Amen. Uh um and and so um uh we
[1:15:05] look at that, the the the the
[1:15:06] antichrist. Now, he rode the white
[1:15:08] horse, the red horse, the black horse,
[1:15:10] and the the and he's riding the pale
[1:15:12] horse today. But God would send uh four
[1:15:15] beasts, the lion, the ox, the leopard
[1:15:17] with the face of a man, and the eagle.
[1:15:19] Ain't that right? And the prophet said
[1:15:21] that God would do this. He sent it to
[1:15:25] combat that that spirit of
[1:15:28] antichrist been riding down through the
[1:15:30] ages. And so God sent the the first his
[1:15:34] first power was the lion and then the ox
[1:15:37] and then the leopard and then then the
[1:15:39] eagle. Ain't that right? Now the
[1:15:42] according to the message of the hour.
[1:15:43] How many believe the message of the
[1:15:45] hour? Well then the last beast is the
[1:15:48] eagle. Amen. That's that eagle
[1:15:51] anointing. and and it's been sent to
[1:15:54] this last stage. The prophet said we are
[1:15:56] living in the eagle age. Not the ox
[1:15:59] anointing, not the lion anointing, not
[1:16:02] the but this is the eagle anointing. He
[1:16:05] said is the age where the word is
[1:16:08] revealed. Ain't that right? He said
[1:16:11] notice the ministry of the lion, the
[1:16:12] word and then the ox, the laboring
[1:16:15] sacrifice, the cunningness of the
[1:16:18] reformers. See, and the eagle age coming
[1:16:21] in, that's to reveal and pick up these
[1:16:24] things and show them. So God likens his
[1:16:27] prophets unto eagles. And and he says in
[1:16:31] the eagle age, the last age, the
[1:16:33] prophetic age, where there is to rise
[1:16:36] prophetic utterance to whom the secrets
[1:16:39] always comes. Ain't that right? This is
[1:16:43] the season for God's secrets to be made
[1:16:46] known in this age. Everything that had
[1:16:49] been hidden down through the ages, all
[1:16:51] the way before time in God's mind is now
[1:16:55] made known through the prophet eagle
[1:16:57] age. That eagle anointing. Aren't you
[1:17:00] glad for that? And and and so, Brother
[1:17:03] Bram says before God moves to action
[1:17:06] like he did in the days of Noah, he sent
[1:17:08] forth an eagle. when he brought Israel
[1:17:12] an ar Pharaoh's army was ready to go. He
[1:17:16] sent an eagle. See, every time he sends
[1:17:19] an eagle at the last end of it. And here
[1:17:22] he sends an eagle again. That's exactly
[1:17:25] with the word. So, how can you make it
[1:17:28] anything else? He sends an eagle. Why? A
[1:17:31] revealer of the truth that's been fallen
[1:17:34] all through the age. So, how in the
[1:17:36] world could the ox or the man or
[1:17:38] whatever beast was riding, how could it
[1:17:40] ever be revealed until the eagle come?
[1:17:44] They had their place. They were godly
[1:17:46] sent bees just the same as anybody else
[1:17:49] was. The lion, that was the original.
[1:17:52] That's where the antichrist come up in
[1:17:55] uh the combat. Then he raised up another
[1:17:57] power and God sent another power to meet
[1:17:59] it. Then he raised up another power and
[1:18:01] God sent another power to meet it. Then
[1:18:03] at the last power, he brings down the
[1:18:06] eagle to restore the
[1:18:09] children back to the original faith
[1:18:12] again of the fathers, the eagle age. Did
[1:18:15] you notice there's no more beast? That's
[1:18:18] all of it. That's it. It's the end. Can
[1:18:20] you say amen, church? We're at the end.
[1:18:24] Amen.
[1:18:26] So, so we now now the people under
[1:18:28] Luther and and all them other
[1:18:30] anointings, they didn't understand
[1:18:32] everything. We're here understanding
[1:18:35] what is this message? Why is it that we
[1:18:38] love this message? Why is it that we we
[1:18:40] we we give everything up for this
[1:18:43] message? What is it doing to us? We can
[1:18:46] understand it's restoring us back to
[1:18:50] Eden. It's the season for it. For this
[1:18:54] is the end time prophecy that had been
[1:18:57] laying there all of this time. It's now
[1:19:00] the season. It's time for the
[1:19:03] manifestation of sons of God. It's time
[1:19:06] for a rapture. It's time to leave
[1:19:08] corruption behind and take on
[1:19:11] immortality to where we can be around
[1:19:14] the the the throne of God forever. Amen.
[1:19:17] To be with our bridegroom. Brother Brham
[1:19:20] said, "See, in the last message that
[1:19:22] went forth, there came a flying eagle."
[1:19:25] It's eagle time. How many believes that?
[1:19:28] Revealed time. The word of God made
[1:19:30] manifest. The word of God proved. Amen.
[1:19:34] See, that's the time that we're living
[1:19:36] in. Ain't that right? See, brother
[1:19:38] Brandon, another place, when the eagle
[1:19:40] finally comes, now notice what he says.
[1:19:42] When the eagle finally comes, it'll be
[1:19:46] 100th of 1% that'll listen.
[1:19:52] I'll say that again. When the eagle
[1:19:55] finally comes, it'll be 100th of 1% that
[1:19:59] will listen. Now, that's a small
[1:20:02] percentage.
[1:20:04] So then he knew people would walk away
[1:20:06] from this message. He knew people wasn't
[1:20:09] going to understand you when you say God
[1:20:11] sent a prophet of Malachi 4 and they
[1:20:13] look at you. He's telling you
[1:20:16] so that you wouldn't be shocked.
[1:20:22] Come on now. There will only be 100th of
[1:20:25] 1% that's going to listen. It's the
[1:20:28] eagle age.
[1:20:31] Can you say amen? Amen. Now, this tells
[1:20:34] us that only a very few very few, right,
[1:20:39] will truly know the season that we're
[1:20:40] living in.
[1:20:42] You see, it is the carnal
[1:20:45] nature,
[1:20:47] sinborn
[1:20:49] man. It's it's it's his nature of man to
[1:20:55] ignore prophecy when it's being
[1:20:58] fulfilled. They go about their daily
[1:21:00] activity as though nothing's happened.
[1:21:04] They go unconcerned.
[1:21:06] They're so wrapped up in in in the
[1:21:08] things of life and in their daily tasks
[1:21:10] and all of these things that they don't
[1:21:13] even understand prophecy being
[1:21:14] fulfilled. Many people sitting in
[1:21:17] churches all around the world today and
[1:21:19] don't know prophecy is being fulfilled.
[1:21:21] They have no clue. I I you know uh one
[1:21:25] uh uh young lady was asked you know uh
[1:21:30] uh the other day you know what do you
[1:21:31] think about you know this uh the the
[1:21:34] election of the the the pope and all
[1:21:36] that. Well it had nothing to do with us
[1:21:38] and we're not Catholic. Has nothing to
[1:21:40] do with us. So I'm not concerned about
[1:21:42] it or you know good glad you know. Well
[1:21:45] see that's where a lot of people are
[1:21:47] today is they're not looking at a
[1:21:50] prophecy. Amen. They're just looking at
[1:21:52] just another event. Time just ticking
[1:21:55] here. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:21:57] But those that are listening to the
[1:21:59] eaglemen,
[1:22:02] they're understanding the season that
[1:22:04] we're living in, they're understanding
[1:22:06] that it's time for scriptures to be
[1:22:09] fulfilled. When Messiah come, all the
[1:22:13] scriptures that pertain to his first
[1:22:15] coming, now was the time.
[1:22:18] And yet it none of it or or a lot of
[1:22:21] them the majority of prophecy concerning
[1:22:23] Jesus's was not fulfilled until the last
[1:22:27] hour of his life.
[1:22:29] That's what brother Brown said. The last
[1:22:31] hour of his life, most of prophecy was
[1:22:34] fulfilled right then that spoke of him.
[1:22:37] Ain't that right? And the world
[1:22:39] continued on like nothing. He was dead.
[1:22:42] He He died. He was buried. Rose again.
[1:22:45] And the world knew nothing about it. And
[1:22:48] the greatest event just took place.
[1:22:53] Come on now.
[1:22:55] True.
[1:22:57] So we we find that it's they just go
[1:23:01] unconcerned today. People are looking
[1:23:04] for something to come and yet they can't
[1:23:07] see what God has already done or is
[1:23:11] doing.
[1:23:12] Now
[1:23:14] example, you know, the Bible foretold
[1:23:16] that there would be an awakening of the
[1:23:18] bride. Talked about the the virgins
[1:23:21] being awoken by the midnight cry. It
[1:23:24] talked about there in in Ezekiel uh of
[1:23:28] of life coming into the bones. There was
[1:23:30] four stages and the last stage was life
[1:23:33] coming into them bones. Only a prophet
[1:23:36] could tie the bride to that vision.
[1:23:39] Amen. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:23:42] And so people have been looking for this
[1:23:44] awakening and and also God said, "I will
[1:23:47] restore saith the Lord." Brother
[1:23:49] Brandham used that and preaching the
[1:23:52] restoration of the bride tree. Ain't
[1:23:53] that right? And told us that the
[1:23:55] restoration comes under this eagle age,
[1:23:59] eagle message, the full restoration.
[1:24:02] Amen. Ain't that right? So, so people
[1:24:06] have been looking for this awakening.
[1:24:07] They've sung about it, preached about
[1:24:09] it, you know, uh, talked about it,
[1:24:11] testified about it, wrote about it. Now,
[1:24:14] in the third seal, Brother Bram said,
[1:24:16] "We have we have denominational
[1:24:18] revivals, but we haven't had a real
[1:24:21] stirring." No, no, no,
[1:24:23] no. Sir, don't think we got revival. We
[1:24:27] haven't. Oh, they've got millions and
[1:24:29] millions and millions of church members,
[1:24:31] but not a revival nowhere. No, no. See?
[1:24:34] And and so he said the bride, now we're
[1:24:37] getting there. The bride hasn't had a
[1:24:39] revival yet. The bride, right?
[1:24:42] Denominational revivals are going on.
[1:24:45] All kinds of revivals are going on, but
[1:24:48] the bride hasn't received a revival.
[1:24:50] See? Uh uh so he says, um he said
[1:24:55] there's been no revival there. And what
[1:24:57] is the revival? Notice how he puts it.
[1:24:59] No manifestation of God to steer the
[1:25:01] bride yet. See, we're looking for it. It
[1:25:05] will take those seven unknown thunders
[1:25:07] back there to wake her up again. Ain't
[1:25:10] that right? So, not just a gathering of
[1:25:13] people, not fast music, and not
[1:25:15] professionalism, not choirs, not even a
[1:25:19] preacher. It would take the seven
[1:25:21] unknown thunders, the voice of God to
[1:25:25] wake her up.
[1:25:27] Amen. Now, that was in ' 63 at at the
[1:25:31] seals. Now later on in 1964 he said
[1:25:35] everywhere now there's no revival. No
[1:25:38] revival. Now think of this now. Listen.
[1:25:40] Everywhere now there's no
[1:25:42] revival. Everybody is complaining.
[1:25:45] Ministers, they're realizing their
[1:25:47] denominational revivals didn't work.
[1:25:50] They're realizing that the protractive
[1:25:52] meetings didn't work. They're realizing
[1:25:54] that everything that they have been
[1:25:56] doing, all their dancing, rolling,
[1:25:58] shouting, and and the loud music and the
[1:26:01] uh hip-hop or whatever they were doing,
[1:26:03] you know, it wasn't working. We're still
[1:26:06] needing something. So, he says,
[1:26:08] "Everywhere now, there's no revival.
[1:26:11] Everybody's complaining. Ministers
[1:26:13] crying." I was reading one of the
[1:26:15] outstanding paper that comes here to the
[1:26:17] church, a very fine paper. I know the
[1:26:19] editor. I know the people. They're godly
[1:26:21] people. very fine brother and sister
[1:26:23] Moore, Jack Moore of the Herald of His
[1:26:26] Coming. One of the finest papers of on
[1:26:28] the field, Herald of His Coming. But
[1:26:30] they will hardly print anything unless
[1:26:32] it's about fast pray, fast pray, sound
[1:26:35] the trumpet. How many reads it? See, you
[1:26:37] know, you see it all the time. Fast
[1:26:39] pray, fast pray. It's all you hear. Fast
[1:26:42] pray. See, we're going to have a break,
[1:26:45] great breaking of the day. There's a
[1:26:47] great thing going to happen. All of you
[1:26:49] pray, pray, pray. We're not too late
[1:26:51] yet. Why do they do that? Why do they do
[1:26:54] that? Well, they want a great awakening.
[1:26:59] Right? See, and the
[1:27:01] Pentecostalism wasn't working.
[1:27:05] See, so they're crying believing that
[1:27:08] there will be a great uh be an
[1:27:10] awakening. They're good people. Why is
[1:27:12] it? What have they done? They have not
[1:27:14] recognized the awakening of the
[1:27:17] bride. Amen. He's telling us something's
[1:27:20] happened. Prophecy was fulfilled and
[1:27:23] they didn't even know it. They didn't
[1:27:26] know it. See, good people. And they're
[1:27:28] praying for revival, but it wasn't to
[1:27:32] them.
[1:27:33] It was to the bride. She's the one that
[1:27:36] was awakened.
[1:27:38] I hope you understand. That's true. See,
[1:27:42] so he says by being a Christian, they
[1:27:44] feel the pull of the hour, but they
[1:27:46] haven't recognized what's been done.
[1:27:48] That's what's making them feel that way.
[1:27:50] They know something's supposed to
[1:27:53] happen. But see, they're looking for it
[1:27:55] way off in the future to come when it's
[1:27:58] already happened right by you. That's
[1:28:00] the same thing they did in the old days.
[1:28:02] They was believing in the coming of the
[1:28:03] Messiah. They believed that there would
[1:28:04] be a forerunner to come, but it was
[1:28:06] right on them and they didn't know it.
[1:28:09] They didn't recognize it. Can you say
[1:28:11] amen? So I'd say to you, we're living in
[1:28:13] the eagle time and the world don't know
[1:28:16] it. We're living in the astronaut age
[1:28:19] and the church world don't know it.
[1:28:21] We're living in the rapture age and the
[1:28:23] church world don't know it. We're living
[1:28:26] in the bride age and the world doesn't
[1:28:28] know it. Can you say amen? Prophecy is
[1:28:32] being fulfilled. things that could not
[1:28:34] be fulfilled that had to wait for this
[1:28:37] time is now taking place and the world
[1:28:40] knows nothing about it.
[1:28:44] You realize the shuck has pulled away
[1:28:45] from the seed and the world knows
[1:28:47] nothing about it. Church world knows
[1:28:49] nothing about
[1:28:50] it. Can you say amen? The word is in the
[1:28:54] bride and the world knows nothing about
[1:28:56] it. The tears have been gathered in the
[1:28:58] garner to be burned and the world knows
[1:29:00] nothing about it.
[1:29:02] Hello. The wheat is now laying in the
[1:29:06] presence of the sun and the church world
[1:29:08] knows nothing about it. The bride has
[1:29:11] become the final voice to the final age
[1:29:13] and the world knows nothing about it.
[1:29:16] It's prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:29:19] And we're part of that prophecy.
[1:29:26] The world doesn't know that prophecy was
[1:29:29] fulfilled the other day. That's right.
[1:29:32] Many go about their daily lives
[1:29:35] unconcerned. They don't believe it it to
[1:29:37] be of any
[1:29:40] importance. Some even are praising this
[1:29:44] new pope.
[1:29:46] As though he's going to do something
[1:29:47] good for the
[1:29:49] world. Of course, the pope represents
[1:29:51] the Catholic Church.
[1:29:54] The Catholic Church is what John saw in
[1:29:57] the book of Revelations. Yes, sir.
[1:30:00] setting uh or the Remember, he
[1:30:04] saw the setting on the scarlet-c
[1:30:05] colored beast, right?
[1:30:08] Amen. I I I honestly don't believe that
[1:30:12] John knew that what he was looking the
[1:30:14] woman that he was looking at was the
[1:30:16] Catholic Church. He just saw the symbol
[1:30:19] of it. that God would send an eagle in
[1:30:23] our day to let us know that woman that
[1:30:26] John saw and he saw her beauty and he
[1:30:29] marveled at her. And yet he said and and
[1:30:33] he says, "But what it is, it's the
[1:30:35] Catholic
[1:30:36] Church." Ain't that right? That's right.
[1:30:39] See, so we understand that the woman is
[1:30:41] a church. Amen. Revelation 17:6, John
[1:30:45] said, "And I saw that woman, saw the
[1:30:47] woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:30:49] saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:30:51] of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wandered
[1:30:54] with great
[1:30:56] admiration." Right? Even John looking at
[1:31:01] this woman was admiring her,
[1:31:04] but he saw her drunk with the blood of
[1:31:07] the saints and the blood of the martyrs.
[1:31:10] Saint, what is a saint? Sanctified one.
[1:31:12] It ain't them dead ones. It It ain't
[1:31:15] them dead ones that cath, you know, if
[1:31:17] you're a Catholic, can't come be a
[1:31:18] saint, be a saint until you're dead.
[1:31:21] Saint means sanctified one, holy,
[1:31:24] cleansed,
[1:31:26] set
[1:31:27] apart. And this church is guilty
[1:31:31] of the blood of those saints, Christians
[1:31:35] elect. Can you say amen? And the pope is
[1:31:38] part of that church and he's the head of
[1:31:40] it. Yeah.
[1:31:43] Hello. Brother Bramman says when pop
[1:31:46] pagan Rome was changed to papa Rome,
[1:31:48] they set up a pope to be the head of it.
[1:31:50] Ain't that right? So, and and the
[1:31:53] Catholic Church believes that his word
[1:31:56] is law and order and that he is
[1:32:00] infallible.
[1:32:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:06] Anyone, Brother Bram says, anyone who
[1:32:09] would not agree or we'll put it, who
[1:32:12] disagreed with the Catholic doctrine was
[1:32:16] put to death, burnt to the stake, and
[1:32:19] everything else. If you want to go look
[1:32:21] at the Fox's book of martyrs, you find
[1:32:23] out just what she done to the saints
[1:32:28] down through the dark ages. Amen. 68
[1:32:31] million is it 68 million Christians were
[1:32:36] killed at her hand.
[1:32:38] That's right. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:32:41] Now, I believe uh as I guess we all do
[1:32:44] here, I believe that the election of
[1:32:47] this pope was more significance than all
[1:32:49] the rest of them because there was
[1:32:52] prophecy concerning this one. That's
[1:32:54] right. Brother Brandham in
[1:32:56] 1954 said, "I believe one of these
[1:32:59] glorious days when this United
[1:33:01] Confederation of Church goes together
[1:33:02] and the new pope is brought out of the
[1:33:05] United States and put over there
[1:33:07] according to the prophecy, then they'll
[1:33:09] form an image like unto the beast." This
[1:33:12] prophecy, I believe, was spoken 71 years
[1:33:15] ago. Didn't look like it was going to be
[1:33:18] fulfilled. Everybody started guessing a
[1:33:20] little different on well it could be
[1:33:22] this and it could be that but a prophet
[1:33:24] said that it would happen.
[1:33:27] Absolutely right. So so it it didn't
[1:33:31] seem like it would be
[1:33:33] fulfilled but God is always true to his
[1:33:35] word. Amen. And to think that we're
[1:33:39] living in this time of fulfillment.
[1:33:42] Amen.
[1:33:44] Hallelujah. Now then it tells us that
[1:33:47] God is getting ready to do something. I
[1:33:50] was listening to brother Brandham I
[1:33:52] think in the second
[1:33:54] seal and he said God is fixing to pour
[1:33:58] his wrath out.
[1:34:01] I thought of that. Yeah. Now that's been
[1:34:05] what 60some years ago I guess that he
[1:34:09] would say that God fixing to pour his
[1:34:11] wrath out. judgment is coming and and
[1:34:16] you know
[1:34:17] now everything had to fall in place
[1:34:21] right
[1:34:23] from what I read no one thought that the
[1:34:26] next pope would come from the United
[1:34:28] States even even the Catholics a lot of
[1:34:30] the Catholics didn't even believe that I
[1:34:34] from what I'm hearing that the nine men
[1:34:37] that were of the top running did not was
[1:34:40] not from the United states
[1:34:43] and we were just talking about it and me
[1:34:45] and my brother Win uh just talking about
[1:34:48] it and he said, "You know, I've read on
[1:34:50] Fox News
[1:34:52] that there ain't any highly a chance at
[1:34:55] all that the Pope will come from the
[1:34:58] United States." He says, "They're
[1:35:00] declaring from another country." And
[1:35:03] says, "So it may not even be this." I
[1:35:06] said, "Well, I don't know, you know."
[1:35:08] and and get home and then declared then
[1:35:11] it was declared and everybody was
[1:35:13] shocked. They said this is the fastest
[1:35:17] election fastest that the cardinals have
[1:35:20] come one day and they decided this pope
[1:35:23] and a and a bishop or a priest or
[1:35:25] whatever. He said that just shows
[1:35:28] there's unity among them cardinals
[1:35:31] that they all come to an agreement for
[1:35:33] this guy. And and you
[1:35:36] know they say there was only 1% chance
[1:35:40] of that happening.
[1:35:45] There was a 20% chance of the next pope
[1:35:48] coming out of Asia, a 70% chance of the
[1:35:51] pope coming out of Europe, but only 1%
[1:35:54] of him coming out of the United States.
[1:35:56] That's right. Now, what tells us this is
[1:36:00] that when God speaks something and it's
[1:36:02] the season for it, I don't care
[1:36:06] who. Amen. Now, I'm telling you, yes,
[1:36:10] all now they say that when the popes or
[1:36:13] when all them cardinals go into that
[1:36:14] building, the Cessene Chapel, they
[1:36:18] should they already know. They should
[1:36:19] already have an idea of where they're
[1:36:20] going with this. And no telling all them
[1:36:24] guys might have said, "Well, we're going
[1:36:26] to pick one from here from Germany, or
[1:36:28] we're going to pick this one here." And
[1:36:29] the spirit of the Lord, I just believe
[1:36:32] that could happen in in in in a moment's
[1:36:34] time. the spirit of the Lord change
[1:36:35] every one of their mind and direct them
[1:36:38] to this guy right here.
[1:36:43] I mean, there's devout Catholics that
[1:36:45] are, you know, talking on the news and
[1:36:46] they're saying that is impossible. We
[1:36:49] didn't know. This was very, very
[1:36:52] different.
[1:36:55] But God knows.
[1:36:58] And this pope was born just a little bit
[1:37:02] after brother Brandon made that prophecy
[1:37:03] of a new pope coming out of out of the
[1:37:06] United
[1:37:08] States. Even his brother says that's we
[1:37:11] are shocked. We are just floored.
[1:37:15] He said we always dreamed I mean we kind
[1:37:17] of knew he would be a priest. He said
[1:37:19] he's the youngest of us three brothers
[1:37:21] and and he would we knew he'd be a
[1:37:23] priest but we're floored that he's you
[1:37:25] know I I think he was even surprised the
[1:37:28] the pope himself but God said in Isaiah
[1:37:32] 55:10 as the rain cometh down and the
[1:37:35] snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:37:37] thither but waterth the earth and maketh
[1:37:39] it bring forth and bud that it may give
[1:37:42] seed to the swer and bread to the eater.
[1:37:44] So shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:37:47] of my mouth. It shall not return unto me
[1:37:49] void. That's right. But it shall
[1:37:51] accomplish that which I please, and it
[1:37:53] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:37:55] sent it. Do you believe that?
[1:37:58] Now, the next thing is to come is the
[1:38:00] image of the beast. To come to the
[1:38:04] forefront.
[1:38:06] Hello.
[1:38:08] I don't know when this is going to
[1:38:09] happen, but I know it's going to happen.
[1:38:11] And I believe it's soon. This could be
[1:38:14] the last meeting that we've ever have.
[1:38:15] This could be the last uh Mother's Day
[1:38:18] that you you you mothers will ever have.
[1:38:22] Th this could be the last breath that we
[1:38:24] ever take. You know, it it's it's
[1:38:27] because we know it's the season for it.
[1:38:30] That's right. Now, this event does not
[1:38:32] awaken the bride. We know what awakens
[1:38:35] the bride, but it is a signpost. It's
[1:38:38] another signpost that we're close to the
[1:38:41] coming of the Lord.
[1:38:43] We're close to the rapture, God. Help us
[1:38:46] to be more sincere than we ever have
[1:38:48] before.
[1:38:49] Help us to be more uh uh sober than we
[1:38:52] ever have before. Help us to do
[1:38:55] everything we can for God. Not that
[1:38:58] we're scared that we're going to go to
[1:39:00] hell and or that we're going to miss the
[1:39:02] the rapture, but let's do everything we
[1:39:06] can for the Lord
[1:39:09] before we're taken up. Can you say amen?
[1:39:12] Amen. I don't know if you've noticed.
[1:39:15] I'm sure you have, but the majority of
[1:39:17] Trump's cabinet members are Catholic.
[1:39:21] It's the most Catholic administration in
[1:39:24] US history. That's right. Think about
[1:39:26] it.
[1:39:28] I know. I know. A lot of message folks
[1:39:31] was rooting for Trump. Trump, Trump,
[1:39:33] Trump, Trump. Oh, going to get good,
[1:39:34] good, good, good,
[1:39:35] good. It wasn't going to get good.
[1:39:40] I believe he's in there for a reason.
[1:39:43] Amen.
[1:39:44] I've always felt that, you know, if he
[1:39:46] does get in, it's it's it's it's going
[1:39:49] to be different.
[1:39:51] I don't think it's strange that the Pope
[1:39:54] comes in at the same time.
[1:39:58] I don't think it's accidental that we've
[1:40:01] got an administration that's
[1:40:04] got most or if not all Catholic in the
[1:40:08] cabinet.
[1:40:10] Brother Brham said,"Now there is an iron
[1:40:12] curtain. There is a bamboo curtain.
[1:40:15] There is a purple curtain." He said,
[1:40:17] 'Brother, don't you fear none of the
[1:40:19] rest of them, but watch that purple
[1:40:21] curtain.
[1:40:23] She is sitting right here on the throne
[1:40:25] today in this
[1:40:28] country. Remember, just like Ahab did,
[1:40:31] Jezebel behind him. The Bible calls the
[1:40:34] Catholic Church Jezebel prostitute. And
[1:40:37] Ahab wasn't no bad guy. I don't say that
[1:40:40] Mr. Kennedy isn't a nice man. I don't
[1:40:43] know nothing about him. He's a man.
[1:40:45] That's all I know. He's the president. I
[1:40:47] believe he'll make a good president.
[1:40:49] It's not him. It's that system behind
[1:40:52] him.
[1:40:54] Wait till she gets wormed into the
[1:40:57] cabinet and everywhere she can. Then
[1:41:01] watch what happens. Look what it done in
[1:41:04] the other nations and look what it's
[1:41:06] always done. So what it tells us is
[1:41:10] we're setting it's everything is being
[1:41:12] set up for the tribulation.
[1:41:15] Everything is being set
[1:41:17] up. Can you say amen? Remember she's
[1:41:21] sitting on the throne today in this
[1:41:24] country.
[1:41:25] I personally believe that the power of
[1:41:27] darkness is fixing to be manifested like
[1:41:30] never
[1:41:31] before. You know, brother Brandon, or
[1:41:33] the Bible tells us in Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:41:36] dream there in the book of Daniel that
[1:41:38] Romanism, the Catholic Church prophet
[1:41:41] says will swallow the world.
[1:41:46] Right? And Daniel tells us that Romanism
[1:41:50] ran
[1:41:51] out. You know, it started with the
[1:41:54] kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, then the Mes
[1:41:56] and the Persians, and then Alexander the
[1:41:59] Great. But all them kingdoms run out.
[1:42:03] One took another one and another one
[1:42:04] took another one and all that. But
[1:42:06] Romanism ran all the way to the end
[1:42:10] to the 10 toes. Ain't that right,
[1:42:13] Brother Brham said them 10 toes run in
[1:42:15] every kingdom under the earth?
[1:42:19] Ain't that right,
[1:42:21] brother Brandham? He talked about the
[1:42:23] three curtains that exist today. the
[1:42:27] bamboo curtain which is red China, the
[1:42:29] iron curtain which is Russia, and the
[1:42:31] purple curtain which is
[1:42:33] Rome. Have you ever if you just if you
[1:42:36] watch the news you you see that
[1:42:37] everybody's they're worried about two
[1:42:39] countries, China and Russia.
[1:42:43] China and Russia.
[1:42:45] No one talks about Rome.
[1:42:50] That's right. And yet an eagle, God
[1:42:51] would send that eagle. Amen. In our day
[1:42:55] to tell that elect, don't you worry
[1:42:57] about China ain't going to take the
[1:42:59] world. Don't worry about Russia. They're
[1:43:02] not going to take the world. You watch
[1:43:04] Rome.
[1:43:06] Ain't that right? He said, "Listen, thus
[1:43:09] said the Lord. Repent. I predict three
[1:43:12] curtains in the name of the Lord."
[1:43:14] There's one called the Iron Curtain,
[1:43:15] which will be Russia. Watch Red China.
[1:43:19] That'll be the boom bamboo curtain.
[1:43:21] They're horrible. But watch that purple
[1:43:23] curtain that's rising in the United
[1:43:26] States and over the world. So don't be
[1:43:29] watching them watching them in Rome
[1:43:33] looking over there.
[1:43:35] They're rising in the United States.
[1:43:39] Ain't that funny? read the other day
[1:43:41] that they're trying to p a congressman
[1:43:43] or senator is trying to pass a a law to
[1:43:47] where that that any foreign country, any
[1:43:50] foreigner that comes over here like
[1:43:52] China and Chinese all that can't buy
[1:43:54] property on soul, you know, on on on US
[1:43:58] land, you know, cuz they're buying it
[1:44:00] up, you know, so they're like, "No, we
[1:44:02] can't be doing all this." And while
[1:44:04] they're worried about that, they got
[1:44:07] Catholics.
[1:44:09] Exactly. In in the White House. True.
[1:44:12] Passing laws.
[1:44:15] And a prophet said, "Don't you worry
[1:44:16] about everything else. You better watch
[1:44:18] that that that purple curtain." Watch
[1:44:21] Catholicism.
[1:44:23] Watch Romanism. Can you say amen? See,
[1:44:26] so the Roman curtain is the one that's
[1:44:29] going to take over the world.
[1:44:31] Fulfilling, Ain't that right? Fulfilling
[1:44:35] uh um uh Daniel's prophecy. So he says,
[1:44:38] "See, watch that purple curtain that's
[1:44:40] rising in the United States and over the
[1:44:42] world, the Roman Empire, the crulest of
[1:44:46] all of them." That's right.
[1:44:50] Remember, in the name of the Lord, get
[1:44:52] away from it. Come away from anything
[1:44:55] that's attached to it. Flee to the rock.
[1:44:59] The coming of the Lord is at hand. Amen.
[1:45:03] So as we see that this is rising among
[1:45:06] in the United States it's a sign to us
[1:45:09] another sign that the coming of the Lord
[1:45:12] is here. Can you say amen? He said see
[1:45:15] there's the iron curtain there's the
[1:45:17] bamboo curtain red china and so on and
[1:45:19] there's the purple curtain. You watch
[1:45:21] that curtain that's the deceiver
[1:45:25] ain't that right? Watch that purple
[1:45:28] curtain. Keep your eye on that for
[1:45:32] that's the one that's going to rule.
[1:45:36] Ain't that right?
[1:45:38] So, I'm going to close. But why isn't
[1:45:41] the
[1:45:42] church fighting against
[1:45:45] Rome? Why isn't the world leaders rising
[1:45:49] up against Rome?
[1:45:51] Revelation 17:2 tells us that the kings
[1:45:54] of the earth have committed fornication
[1:45:55] with her
[1:45:58] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[1:46:00] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:46:02] fornication.
[1:46:03] In the fourth verse, John said that this
[1:46:05] woman had a golden cup in her hand full
[1:46:08] of abominations and filthiness of her
[1:46:10] fornication. Ain't that right? And the
[1:46:13] prophet said, "This is what she is
[1:46:15] giving the world." And they are
[1:46:16] swallowing it and are dropped by it.
[1:46:23] If you didn't get a chance to hear
[1:46:27] Brother Andrew's sermon Sunday, go back
[1:46:29] and listen to that. I I really encourage
[1:46:32] you to go listen to it.
[1:46:34] and and
[1:46:36] um he
[1:46:39] uh he had a picture uh he showed some
[1:46:44] pictures and one of those pictures uh
[1:46:48] apparently when he was a child, brother
[1:46:50] Bisco had come to the church and had
[1:46:52] showed this picture but it was it showed
[1:46:55] three of our
[1:46:56] presidents kneeling at a pope's Catholic
[1:47:00] or Pope's uh uh uh casket.
[1:47:04] all kneeling there at and and and he he
[1:47:09] made just such a a good thing about it.
[1:47:11] He says, "And who is the who who's who
[1:47:15] is making a fuss? What what what person
[1:47:18] in the world's making a fuss about that
[1:47:19] right there? Come on. That's right. No
[1:47:22] one. No one." And he showed some other
[1:47:25] pictures and he says, "But who who is
[1:47:27] what church? What denomination? What
[1:47:29] world leader? What anyone is making a
[1:47:31] fuss about these pictures?" Yeah. No
[1:47:34] one.
[1:47:36] There's only one picture that they make
[1:47:37] a fuss about. And he showed a prophet
[1:47:40] right there. That's the only one they're
[1:47:42] going to make a fuss about.
[1:47:44] Even in our own message ranks, they're
[1:47:46] saying that the church ain't a fitting
[1:47:47] place for that picture.
[1:47:51] That blows my mind. But that's the only
[1:47:53] man that wouldn't kneel down and bow to
[1:47:55] that thing.
[1:47:57] That's the only man.
[1:47:59] That's the only man that's been
[1:48:00] vindicated of God. And that man by the
[1:48:04] anointing of God tells us, "Watch that
[1:48:06] purple curtain."
[1:48:08] Satan hates this message. Hates that
[1:48:11] picture right there.
[1:48:15] Can you say amen? He hates it. Amen. Out
[1:48:19] of all the things in the world that the
[1:48:22] world should be grumbling about, that's
[1:48:24] what they grumble about.
[1:48:26] They
[1:48:27] criticize. But I would encourage you to
[1:48:30] go listen to it.
[1:48:32] But brother Brandham said, "See, they're
[1:48:33] drunk. They're just drunk on it." He
[1:48:37] said, "All that bunch of Irish and
[1:48:38] French and so forth will cut your throat
[1:48:40] if you say one thing against that
[1:48:42] church." Said, "Sure, they will."
[1:48:45] See, now just in my thoughts and and
[1:48:48] nothing scriptural or anything, but I do
[1:48:51] I do find it a little interesting that
[1:48:54] the new pope was elected on the eighth
[1:48:56] day in of the fifth
[1:48:59] month. And there's nothing, you know,
[1:49:02] I'm just putting it there. But in 1
[1:49:06] Peter
[1:49:07] 5:8, Peter says, "Be sober, be vigilant,
[1:49:09] because your adversary, the devil, as a
[1:49:11] roaring
[1:49:13] lion, walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:49:16] devour."
[1:49:19] Is is, you know, is that all by chance?
[1:49:21] Is it all I don't know, but him being
[1:49:25] elected on the eth day of the fifth
[1:49:26] month. But it is interesting also that
[1:49:30] the pope is using this pope is using the
[1:49:32] name Leo and the Latin word Leo is lion.
[1:49:36] Right. Right.
[1:49:41] And again, this pope of course is is
[1:49:44] part of the antichrist
[1:49:47] system and is anointed with the
[1:49:49] antichrist spirit, right?
[1:49:52] Which has sought, this spirit has sought
[1:49:54] to be like God and to be worshiped as
[1:49:57] God, right?
[1:49:59] And you look in Isaiah 14:12, it talks
[1:50:03] about it, you know, where Satan says,"I
[1:50:05] will sit up on the mount or I will
[1:50:07] ascend into the heaven. I will exalt my
[1:50:09] throne above the stars of God. I will
[1:50:11] sit upon the mount of the congregation
[1:50:14] in the sides of the north. I will ascend
[1:50:17] above the heights of the clouds. I will
[1:50:19] be like the most high."
[1:50:21] And this is what this this system
[1:50:25] Satan's working able to fulfill all this
[1:50:28] through this Catholic system.
[1:50:31] and and uh you know and and then here 2
[1:50:35] Thessalonians 2:3 Paul says, "Let no man
[1:50:38] deceive you by any means, for that day
[1:50:39] shall not come, the day of Christ,
[1:50:42] except there come a falling away first,
[1:50:44] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:50:46] of predition, who opposeth and exaltth
[1:50:49] himself above all that is called God, or
[1:50:52] that is worshiped, so that he as God
[1:50:54] sitth in the temple of God, showing
[1:50:56] himself that he is God." Can you say
[1:50:58] amen? That's right. Everything that God
[1:51:01] has, Satan has a counterfeit to it.
[1:51:04] The prophet said, "The devil throws
[1:51:06] every counterfeit he can right in the fa
[1:51:09] in the way to confuse you." The devil's
[1:51:11] got a counterfeit in the last days to
[1:51:14] deceive the people by. I say to you,
[1:51:17] that Catholic Church is a counterfeit
[1:51:20] to God's church. Denominations are a
[1:51:23] counterfeit to God's church. The
[1:51:26] and harlot system is a counterfeit to
[1:51:28] the bride of Jesus Christ. The pope is a
[1:51:31] counterfeit to what God is. Can you say
[1:51:35] amen? We find in in if you look at the
[1:51:38] zodiac
[1:51:40] uh you know that brothers that was God's
[1:51:42] first Bible and he says and to start it
[1:51:44] off was the virgin
[1:51:47] uh uh ver Virgo. Uh the first figure in
[1:51:51] the zodiac is the Virgo if I'm saying
[1:51:54] that right. Virgo in Latin means virgin
[1:51:56] which tells of the first coming of
[1:51:59] Christ born of a virgin. The last figure
[1:52:02] in the zodiac is Leo the lion.
[1:52:07] Which speaks of Christ's coming?
[1:52:12] His second coming. Ain't that right? All
[1:52:14] right. And notice he says, "And as God
[1:52:17] has moved down through the age, we're at
[1:52:21] Leo the Lion,
[1:52:24] who is the bride." That's right. We're
[1:52:27] at Leo the Lion.
[1:52:30] We've got our head lifted up.
[1:52:33] Our redemption draweth nigh.
[1:52:36] Ain't that right? There's a rapture on
[1:52:38] its way. It'll be here any moment. We're
[1:52:42] not looking for a virgin. We're not
[1:52:44] looking for uh him to come forth from a
[1:52:46] virgin. We're looking at him to be king,
[1:52:50] coming as the lion of the tribe of
[1:52:52] Judah.
[1:52:54] Can you say amen? He says we're in the
[1:52:57] book of the Revelations at the last
[1:52:59] chapter. Science says we're 3 minutes
[1:53:01] before midnight. Oh, think of where
[1:53:04] we're at. Can you say amen? And I find
[1:53:08] it interesting
[1:53:10] that this pope would call himself Leo.
[1:53:13] Part of an antichrist system,
[1:53:17] one who claims to have jurisdiction over
[1:53:19] hell. Uh what is that? The the uh uh
[1:53:25] death, hell, and purgatory. Ain't that
[1:53:27] right? Amen. See, and so we we find in
[1:53:31] where we're at and and
[1:53:34] uh as I close this this system,
[1:53:38] remember, is designed to take the place
[1:53:40] of God.
[1:53:43] Some people figure that Pope Leo will
[1:53:45] continue with the same ideology that
[1:53:47] Pope Francis had. And a lot of our GOP
[1:53:51] members are upset about it and worried
[1:53:53] about it or whatever.
[1:53:56] Pope Francis was more
[1:53:58] liberal and was considered by devoted a
[1:54:01] lot of devoted Catholics to be a rebel
[1:54:03] to the traditions of the Catholic
[1:54:06] Church. But a Catholic man and and he I
[1:54:12] don't know if he how high of the rank he
[1:54:14] has in the Catholic Church, but he wrote
[1:54:16] an article giving reasons as to why Pope
[1:54:19] Leo will not follow in Pope Francis's
[1:54:23] steps.
[1:54:26] And so he he he gives the certain
[1:54:28] reasons. I didn't write them down or
[1:54:29] anything, but
[1:54:32] uh a lot of the things that Pope Francis
[1:54:35] done broke the traditions of the
[1:54:37] Catholic Church, Pope Leo has come and
[1:54:41] has has continued back to the traditions
[1:54:44] of the Catholic Church in in ways the
[1:54:47] way a pope is supposed to be, how he's
[1:54:49] supposed to dress, his garments, and da
[1:54:51] da da da da. And so he says that these
[1:54:56] are reasons or these reasons are
[1:54:59] indications to the Catholics that Pope
[1:55:01] Leo will follow the traditions of the
[1:55:03] Catholic Church. The writer goes on to
[1:55:06] say he Pope Leo will defend the Catholic
[1:55:10] faith as a faithful father and shepherd
[1:55:13] of the church. All Catholics should hope
[1:55:16] and pray for this, but so should all
[1:55:18] non-atholics, whether Protestants or
[1:55:21] unbelievers, for the simple reason that
[1:55:24] the Christian faith is what undergirds
[1:55:28] western
[1:55:29] civilization. And without a clear,
[1:55:32] strong voice in the Holy Sea defending
[1:55:35] the
[1:55:36] faith, our
[1:55:38] civilization will not long endure.
[1:55:43] So now he's putting
[1:55:45] himself as the voice of faith. Yeah.
[1:55:51] One headline I had saw is where the the
[1:55:57] uh they said the cardinals before they
[1:56:00] had voted uh got that far that that the
[1:56:04] cardinals were looking for someone to
[1:56:06] reawaken
[1:56:07] people back to God who have left
[1:56:12] God. That sounds nice.
[1:56:16] But the only way they've tried to
[1:56:18] reawaken people is through persecution.
[1:56:23] And anyone that would not come to the
[1:56:26] Catholic faith were considered heretics.
[1:56:31] So you just wonder where are we at?
[1:56:35] But I can tell you prophecy has been
[1:56:38] fulfilled
[1:56:40] and it's going home time.
[1:56:43] It's truly truly going home time
[1:56:48] if the musicians will come. Absolutely.
[1:56:50] That's true.
[1:57:01] You know, I I had a lot more to
[1:57:06] go,
[1:57:08] but Paul
[1:57:13] Brother Bran taught that there were
[1:57:15] twins in every
[1:57:17] revival and he showed it all the way
[1:57:19] down through since the
[1:57:21] beginning. Then he talked about how on
[1:57:24] the day of Pentecost, the spirit of God
[1:57:27] came and brought forth a revival. But it
[1:57:29] wasn't long after that that the spirit
[1:57:32] of Antichrist
[1:57:34] came, the
[1:57:37] twin. And Paul would say in Acts 20:29,
[1:57:43] "For I know this, that after my
[1:57:45] departing," now this wasn't
[1:57:48] long after
[1:57:50] Pentecost, but he said, "After my
[1:57:52] departing shall grievous wolves enter in
[1:57:54] among you, not sparing the flock. Also
[1:57:57] of your own selves shall men arise,
[1:58:00] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:58:03] disciples after them."
[1:58:07] Then in 2 Thessalonians 2:7, Paul said
[1:58:11] that the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:58:13] already
[1:58:14] work. It wasn't even long after
[1:58:17] Pentecost had
[1:58:18] come that the mystery of iniquity now
[1:58:22] started to work. And this was in the
[1:58:26] first church age.
[1:58:29] And brother Brandham says, "By the end
[1:58:32] of Paul's age, the church was already
[1:58:35] feeling the coming of a
[1:58:37] pope." By the end of Paul's
[1:58:42] age, he said they seen this nickel stuff
[1:58:46] was rising up and they was going to make
[1:58:48] a holy man to what?
[1:58:51] Pope. Make a pope a holy man.
[1:58:55] worldliness and uh aristocrats had
[1:58:58] creeped into the church and changing the
[1:59:01] order of
[1:59:02] worship. Paul with the Holy Ghost had
[1:59:04] caught that in the spirit and the church
[1:59:06] with its classics and dignitaries and
[1:59:10] dignitaried personalities and so forth.
[1:59:13] They seen there was coming something and
[1:59:15] the Holy Ghost was warning them of the
[1:59:18] last days.
[1:59:22] It started as the the deeds of the
[1:59:24] nicicoatans. Then it become an
[1:59:26] organization or a doctrine. Then it
[1:59:28] become an
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:31] organization. You see the deeds of the
[1:59:33] nickelans then the organization starting
[1:59:36] the great dignitaries over the churches
[1:59:39] so forth then formed into the Catholic
[1:59:43] church. And
[1:59:46] remember Jesus told us that there would
[1:59:49] be mystery workers of iniquity in this
[1:59:52] age. Workers of
[1:59:55] iniquity. And brother Brandham said,
[1:59:57] "See, it's the mystery of iniquity at
[1:59:59] work. Deceivers deceiving people off
[2:00:02] into
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:05] something." Can you say
[2:00:08] amen? But I thought of all this, you
[2:00:10] know, what what what is this? what
[2:00:13] what's
[2:00:16] happening? Not to get into it all, but
[2:00:19] brother Brand or Paul would tell us that
[2:00:21] the man of sin could not be revealed
[2:00:25] until there come a falling
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:30] away. We've been living in a great
[2:00:33] falling away. It's it's been a
[2:00:36] [Music]
[2:00:39] um it's it's been uh several years now.
[2:00:44] Brother Brandham talking of Samson
[2:00:46] preach that se several message one more
[2:00:50] time Lord
[2:00:52] right once more Lord and things like
[2:00:55] that. But brother Brandham said this.
[2:00:58] Paul said there cannot be an end time.
[2:01:00] There cannot be a time till the falling
[2:01:02] away from the real. Everybody say real
[2:01:07] Pentecostal
[2:01:09] faith. Now remember they're talking
[2:01:11] about a faith that this pope is going to
[2:01:14] be a defender of the
[2:01:17] faith.
[2:01:21] God. that he he can't manifest himself
[2:01:24] till the people fall from the faith. And
[2:01:27] brother Brandon said, "It ain't a
[2:01:28] Catholic
[2:01:30] faith. It ain't it has not this faith
[2:01:33] has nothing to do with the Catholic
[2:01:34] church and the world system and image of
[2:01:38] the beast. This is the Pentecostal
[2:01:41] faith." He said, "See, the Pentecostal
[2:01:44] faith will be done away with and the
[2:01:46] dignitaries will be set in. They'll have
[2:01:50] a man that'll take the place of God, sit
[2:01:52] in the temple of God, and oppose himself
[2:01:55] above all the people like that. He said,
[2:01:58] "What is it?" Niko overcoming the leoty.
[2:02:00] All that's called God. He'll sit in the
[2:02:02] temple of God like God. And Paul said,
[2:02:05] "There had come a falling away first in
[2:02:07] the last days." And here we are right
[2:02:09] now seeing that falling away. See the
[2:02:13] church getting further and further away
[2:02:15] from it. Going right back again. We're
[2:02:19] at the end time. Can you say
[2:02:23] amen? And if you look at this
[2:02:25] Pentecostal faith, it's God's own
[2:02:28] faith. Revelations 2:13, God talks to
[2:02:31] the third church age, saying, "I know
[2:02:34] thy works where thou dwellest, even
[2:02:36] where Satan's seed is, and thou holdest
[2:02:38] fast my name, and has not denied my
[2:02:43] faith." His faith was the Pentecostal
[2:02:47] faith that he had given them on the day
[2:02:49] of
[2:02:51] Pentecost. Brother Rabb said Satan St.
[2:02:54] Martin was that angel messenger to that
[2:02:57] third church age. He was one of the
[2:02:59] greatest that ever we've ever had in the
[2:03:02] line of men since Jesus Christ. He kept
[2:03:04] the Pentecostal faith in the midst of
[2:03:06] that church age. His churches was all
[2:03:09] filled with the Holy Ghost. They all
[2:03:10] spoke in tongues, had signs and wonders
[2:03:13] and miracles, just all kinds of miracles
[2:03:15] taking place. Can you say amen? He kept
[2:03:19] that faith. But in this age, there's a
[2:03:21] falling away. The man of sin cannot be
[2:03:25] revealed.
[2:03:27] Satan cannot come into that
[2:03:30] man and make
[2:03:34] himself well fully
[2:03:37] incarnate until the falling away has
[2:03:41] come.
[2:03:43] Church, we're there. I I don't know how
[2:03:46] to explain it, but we're
[2:03:48] there. Can you say amen?
[2:03:52] Brother Brham says, "What we need is a
[2:03:53] born again experience with back to the
[2:03:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost with the gen
[2:03:57] genuine real genuine Pentecostal faith
[2:04:00] in God exercised in our church." That
[2:04:02] brings something that you're led by the
[2:04:04] spirit. When the word speaks, you say
[2:04:07] amen to it and you believe it. Now
[2:04:11] notice as we close, Malachi 4 was
[2:04:15] promised to bring us back to that
[2:04:18] Pentecostal
[2:04:19] faith. Outside of this message, you will
[2:04:22] not go back to that Pentecostal faith.
[2:04:25] Not that real. You'll be part of that
[2:04:27] falling away. And you'll look at the
[2:04:30] Catholic Church as some great defender
[2:04:32] of the
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:35] faith. He's a deceiver.
[2:04:38] Can you say amen? You love the Lord. God
[2:04:42] bless
[2:04:42] you is our prayer. Love you. Hope it's
[2:04:46] helped you a little bit. But the um what
[2:04:50] a time to be living in cuz we know we we
[2:04:54] know we're not part of the great
[2:04:55] tribulation.
[2:04:57] We know
[2:05:00] that. Brother Matthew McGary, you know,
[2:05:02] he he he made a statement. He goes, "I
[2:05:04] have never been so excited to see a pop
[2:05:06] elactic like I have this time." And I
[2:05:09] thought, "That's exactly right." Because
[2:05:12] we know what it means to
[2:05:14] us. We know we don't have to put up with
[2:05:18] the filth anymore much longer. We We're
[2:05:21] not We're seeing things taking
[2:05:25] place. Church, God has fulfilled
[2:05:28] something for you and I years ago when
[2:05:30] he sent a prophet.
[2:05:33] Now the world is catching up to their
[2:05:37] prophecies. We've been under that
[2:05:39] message ripening and ripening and
[2:05:42] ripening. Our faith is becoming more
[2:05:45] stronger in this message than ever have
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:49] before. The world is now coming to their
[2:05:54] prophecies. It's getting closer for them
[2:05:56] to come into
[2:05:58] tribulation. We know where we're going.
[2:06:02] Amen. Can you lift your hands and just
[2:06:06] thank God for his grace upon our
[2:06:09] lives? We could be part of
[2:06:12] it. We could be worshiping some man,
[2:06:16] some
[2:06:17] doctrines, some antichrist
[2:06:20] system. We could be caught up in all the
[2:06:23] the the the falling away of the faith.
[2:06:26] that God by mercy, by grace, has allowed
[2:06:31] us to be part of this end time
[2:06:35] message to prepare us for a
[2:06:38] rapture. Not preparing us for
[2:06:40] tribulation. We're not getting into the
[2:06:43] spirit of the end times. We're getting
[2:06:45] in the spirit of
[2:06:48] rapture. Oh, bless the name of the Lord.
[2:06:51] How we love you for that, Father. We
[2:06:54] thank you, Lord. We praise you, God. Our
[2:06:59] hearts are yearning for you, Lord. We're
[2:07:02] just saying, draw us closer to you,
[2:07:05] Father. Oh, may your grace be more upon
[2:07:09] us than ever
[2:07:10] before. We ask it, Lord. We thank you.
[2:07:13] We're waiting for you, longing for your
[2:07:17] return. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:21] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. This is the
[2:07:23] evening time. I'll sing it again. Oh,
[2:07:28] this is the evening
[2:07:34] time. It's later than you
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:40] think. The bride is
[2:07:44] preparing
[2:07:46] now. Oh yes, yes, yes.
[2:07:51] [Music]
[2:07:58] All things are
[2:08:01] ready. The bride by bridegroom hath
[2:08:07] spoken. He that hath an ear to hear the
[2:08:13] evening
[2:08:14] [Applause]
[2:08:15] time. Oh, say it again.
[2:08:19] Oh, this is the evening
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:25] time. It's later than you
[2:08:32] think. The bride's been
[2:08:35] preparing
[2:08:37] now for her,
[2:08:40] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:08:46] All things are ready
[2:08:51] now. The
[2:08:53] bridegroom I
[2:08:57] hear. He that hath an ear to
[2:09:03] hear. The evening time is here. One more
[2:09:08] time.
[2:09:10] Oh, this is the evening
[2:09:16] time. It's later than you
[2:09:23] think. The bride is
[2:09:26] preparing
[2:09:29] now. I believe the bride's
[2:09:33] ready. I believe that she's been
[2:09:35] ripened.
[2:09:42] Hallelujah. No arguing with the message.
[2:09:44] No doubting with the message. Not afraid
[2:09:47] of it. Not ashamed of
[2:09:52] it. To
[2:09:54] hear the evening light is
[2:10:02] here. Oh, isn't the Lord
[2:10:05] wonderful? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:10:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[2:10:14] Lord. There's that song,
