[48:52] chapter 4.
[48:55] and we've been reading this verse here
[48:59] but it's in the eighth verse finally
[49:02] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[49:05] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[49:07] things are just whatsoever things are
[49:10] pure
[49:11] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[49:13] things are good of good report if there
[49:17] be any virtue
[49:19] and if there be any praise think on
[49:24] these things
[49:25] those things
[49:27] which you have both learned and received
[49:31] and heard and seen in me do
[49:35] and the peace of God shall be with you
[49:39] amen you can have your seats
[49:42] this evening and I want to continue
[49:45] with the thought meditating on the
[49:48] positive
[49:49] and we have so much negative that is out
[49:53] there in the world and
[49:57] very few people really know
[50:01] the positive
[50:02] but I'm glad that we do know what the
[50:06] positive is
[50:08] and and that we can meditate there on
[50:12] because not all meditation is approved
[50:15] of God
[50:16] or acceptable and
[50:19] um but we we find that Paul tells us
[50:23] here what to think on and and it's
[50:27] important that our thinking or
[50:30] um is is right for Proverbs 23 and 7. uh
[50:38] we we know that uh it says as a man
[50:42] thinketh in his heart so is he
[50:45] as as he thanketh and so uh as a man
[50:50] thinketh so is he and uh and and he says
[50:55] in his heart
[50:57] so what we think on or meditate on
[51:01] in our heart it shows what kind of
[51:05] individual we are it shows what what we
[51:07] who we are we've talked about it
[51:11] um
[51:12] um the five senses of the of our body
[51:15] which your taste smell hears sight and
[51:17] feel
[51:19] um you you can't go by that because one
[51:23] moment it'll be positive and the other
[51:24] moment it won't be positive
[51:27] I um
[51:28] it's kind of like
[51:30] um
[51:31] uh
[51:32] I've uh had just I've got a lot of
[51:35] stiffness in my neck
[51:37] and um
[51:40] you know it's just I guess either part
[51:44] of just growing up
[51:45] or what
[51:52] uh Growing Pains I guess
[51:56] and so but anyways man you know it just
[51:59] uh hurts well the other day I woke up no
[52:02] pain whatsoever man I was feeling great
[52:04] and I was really thanking the lord for
[52:06] it
[52:08] and uh man I was so excited and uh three
[52:12] hours later back again you know
[52:16] and so uh I really learned right then
[52:19] that your body backslides on you
[52:26] and so you can't depend on your body
[52:31] and
[52:32] um and so it'll be positive one moment
[52:36] negative the next then you got your five
[52:38] senses of the spirit
[52:40] that are imagination reasoning
[52:43] conscience affection and uh memory
[52:48] and that will be positive one moment and
[52:52] then turn around and be negative the
[52:54] next
[52:55] and so but these things
[53:00] these things don't tell what you are
[53:03] your body doesn't tell what you are
[53:05] and and your spirit don't tell what you
[53:09] are
[53:09] but it says as a man thinketh in his
[53:13] heart
[53:14] so is he
[53:16] and and so now Satan Works through these
[53:19] senses just as God does as as we know
[53:23] and I'm just going to be simple and uh
[53:26] but hopefully to help somebody but Satan
[53:30] Works through these senses God works
[53:32] through these senses and but it's in
[53:35] your soul what you are in your soul is
[53:39] is what counts because it's in your soul
[53:41] as the prophet taught us uh uh that
[53:45] that's where the control tower is
[53:48] and so then if that's the case and
[53:52] there's only one sense or gate whatever
[53:55] to the soul in that self-will free moral
[53:59] agent and and so and then another place
[54:02] brother Brown says is Faith or doubt and
[54:05] so if you keep that in mind uh but it's
[54:09] in the soul that that that's the control
[54:10] tower that's really what you are you got
[54:13] your body and you got your spirit but
[54:15] then then you are in the soul that
[54:20] that's that's really what counts and so
[54:23] uh then that means that we're not a
[54:25] slave to any of our senses five senses
[54:29] of the body but we are not slaves to it
[54:32] uh five senses of the spirit but we're
[54:35] not slaves to it ain't that right now
[54:38] you know every day I I say every day we
[54:42] have two different reports that come to
[54:45] us through our senses uh senses of the
[54:49] Flesh and senses of her spirit and one
[54:53] report is positive it's it's all
[54:57] positive and then the other report is of
[55:01] course the negative and it has to be now
[55:03] for it's it's called The Law of contrast
[55:06] ain't that right and so uh by by our
[55:12] sense of sight we see what God says in
[55:17] his word if you read the Bible which you
[55:20] should always uh read your Bible brother
[55:23] Brown said a Christian reads and prays
[55:26] every day reads his Bible and prays
[55:28] every day
[55:29] but but there's a reason that we would
[55:32] read because our site picks this up and
[55:36] you read you see what is in the
[55:38] scriptures and and you know we see the
[55:42] Miracles that God has uh performs
[55:46] um whether you know it it be among us or
[55:50] whether uh whatever but but we see that
[55:54] God performs Miracles ain't that rhyme
[55:57] uh uh and it don't even have to be you
[56:00] know a lot of the miracles happen every
[56:02] day that we see like the rising of the
[56:04] sun and the setting of The Sun that's a
[56:07] miracle uh when we're we're looking now
[56:10] that the trees have been so dead and all
[56:13] that but look at the grass changing uh
[56:16] from brown to green and and the the the
[56:19] leaves are now uh coming on the trees
[56:22] that's a miracle yes it happens so
[56:25] silently it happens just so unknown to
[56:28] us but it's still a mirror miracle and
[56:31] and we see these things I mean uh all of
[56:35] these things because what we're seeing
[56:37] is a resurrection of Life uh in the
[56:40] trees the flowers the grass and it
[56:43] testifies to us that there is a a
[56:46] resurrection and it causes us to rejoice
[56:50] and and to praise God I I I I don't
[56:54] think that you could uh read the
[56:56] promises of God see it with your eyes to
[56:59] see what God says without getting
[57:01] excited about it I I don't think you can
[57:03] see Miracles with your eyes and and not
[57:06] not get excited in and think of God
[57:09] ain't that right well God gives us our
[57:13] eyesight so we can be reminded of his
[57:16] word his promises his faithfulness his
[57:19] goodness and his power and and all of
[57:23] these things and and God allows the sick
[57:25] uh you know sickness he allows deformity
[57:28] he allows these things and then he comes
[57:30] with his mighty hand and and causes the
[57:34] blind to see the ears to start hearing
[57:37] the lame to start walking I've seen I've
[57:39] seen tripled get out of the wheelchair
[57:41] I've seen blind eyes come open we've
[57:44] seen I've seen that with my own eyes
[57:46] brother shalom and and and and these
[57:48] things and God just loves to do that and
[57:52] and he does it so your eyes can see it
[57:55] uh uh and it testifies of who he is but
[57:59] also on the other hand these eyes have
[58:01] seen tragedy and we've seen you know
[58:04] horror and and I don't you know we've
[58:08] we've uh uh if you've come on a wreck or
[58:11] something and it's just horrible and
[58:13] maybe someone's died and and uh or
[58:17] you've seen a fire or you've seen uh
[58:20] just just tragedy that has taken place
[58:23] and and well you know so uh as as our
[58:27] eyes look on things that God does then
[58:31] are also our eyes look on that on the
[58:33] things that maybe the devil is working
[58:35] through and so so we we see things that
[58:39] we want to see but then then we also see
[58:42] things that we don't want to see and and
[58:44] so but uh you know so so uh you know we
[58:48] we pray a lot of those times for God to
[58:51] move in a situation and and we see that
[58:54] things haven't changed uh we keep saying
[58:56] the same thing and and you know and
[58:59] people get affected by them things you
[59:01] know you're praying and praying and
[59:03] you're praying and and you know
[59:06] um I I think of uh just like my dad uh
[59:09] example you know he's he's got the
[59:12] Parkinson's and he's shaking and and uh
[59:15] he's real weak he can you know hardly
[59:17] walk and sometimes he can't even walk
[59:20] and and we see that right and and but
[59:23] yet we're praying for a miracle and but
[59:26] yet as as every time we're praying we
[59:29] believe in we're confessing and then you
[59:32] see with your natural eye that it's
[59:34] getting worse well then Satan is trying
[59:36] to take what you're seeing and affect
[59:39] you in some way well so we're seeing
[59:43] what the Bible says I'm the god that
[59:45] healeth all thy diseases ain't that
[59:47] right and and and so we're seeing that
[59:49] with our eyes and yet we're seeing this
[59:51] with our eyes and and and we're seeing
[59:54] two contrary different things
[59:56] uh opposite things and and so um so
[1:00:01] maybe we pray for someone you know that
[1:00:03] to get better in their health and then
[1:00:05] we see that the situation is getting
[1:00:06] worse well this is this allows Satan to
[1:00:10] work on us uh uh so we're seeing a good
[1:00:13] report we're we're seeing a bad report
[1:00:15] and and and these things and and so how
[1:00:19] many people have seen others you know in
[1:00:22] in some kind of Affliction and maybe
[1:00:24] they've died from that Affliction and
[1:00:26] then and then uh the the that person
[1:00:29] that saw that they're Afflicted with
[1:00:31] that PR that the same disease that this
[1:00:34] individual died with and and of course
[1:00:36] Satan goes to work you know on that well
[1:00:39] I saw what they done and and then he
[1:00:42] tries to put fear on them by what they
[1:00:45] saw you understand what I'm saying and
[1:00:47] and so uh uh uh you know so so Satan
[1:00:52] works with uh you know our sight as much
[1:00:56] is God works on our with our sight as
[1:00:59] well also by our sense of hearing we
[1:01:02] hear what the minister says about God's
[1:01:04] word we Rejoice at what we hear how many
[1:01:08] times uh we we rejoiced at the
[1:01:10] ministering of the word of God to hear
[1:01:13] the promises and and and I'll be honest
[1:01:16] I've I get excited when I hear a prophet
[1:01:19] the prophet preach and playing the tapes
[1:01:21] and there's something he says that I
[1:01:23] catch it with my ear hearing and I
[1:01:27] rejoice in that eyes amen that's right
[1:01:30] you know and and and and that's
[1:01:33] wonderful but then we also hear things
[1:01:36] that we don't want to hear that we don't
[1:01:39] need to hear you understand what I'm
[1:01:40] saying and so we'll hear the good and
[1:01:43] we'll hear the bad it's it's both
[1:01:46] negative and positive and and yet none
[1:01:50] of that determines Who You Are
[1:01:52] you can hear the badge you can hear the
[1:01:55] good you can see the badge you can see
[1:01:57] the the good and yet none of that
[1:01:59] determines as to what you are because
[1:02:03] it's it's what's in your soul ain't that
[1:02:05] right now what report
[1:02:09] you sink on and you receive then that
[1:02:13] shows what you are in your soul can you
[1:02:16] say amen and I want you young people to
[1:02:18] really understand this that your
[1:02:21] conversion doesn't happen in your body
[1:02:22] your conversion doesn't really happen in
[1:02:25] your spirit your conversion happens in
[1:02:28] your soul
[1:02:29] yeah that that's that's where that's
[1:02:32] where it's got to happen and you are a a
[1:02:36] gene seed in your soul ain't that rhyme
[1:02:39] brother Branham would say the real
[1:02:41] ordained of God that real Gene that real
[1:02:45] germ a soul of God that was in God
[1:02:49] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:52] another place he says your physical
[1:02:54] context the physical your spiritual
[1:02:57] context the spiritual but inside of that
[1:03:01] you've got a soul and that soul is the
[1:03:05] gene that come from God ain't that rhyme
[1:03:08] so the Warfare the battle that goes on
[1:03:12] it's a daily thing uh that that that we
[1:03:18] go through it's just like you you you
[1:03:20] hear the word today uh both services and
[1:03:24] and maybe God's speaking to you and
[1:03:27] you're hearing that well it's it's it's
[1:03:30] a given fact I guarantee you you will
[1:03:35] hear something down tomorrow or the week
[1:03:39] and something to that effect that'll be
[1:03:42] horrible that'll be bad that'll be a
[1:03:45] negative that'll be a it's just common
[1:03:48] it's just the law of contrast ain't that
[1:03:51] right and and so it it's it's just a
[1:03:55] guarantee and God allows these things he
[1:03:58] he allows you to sit and hear the
[1:04:00] promises and he will also allow you to
[1:04:03] sit and hear all the negative and and
[1:04:05] and all of these things and so you're
[1:04:07] not only affected by positive things
[1:04:11] you're going to be affected by negative
[1:04:13] things you you could sit here and say
[1:04:16] you know by by the end of the services
[1:04:18] and all that you know I've been in them
[1:04:20] in Services where I just feel like I'm
[1:04:22] on the Mountaintop brother Amos I feel
[1:04:24] like man I'm I'm a really first kid I'm
[1:04:26] a real believer I'm really gonna make it
[1:04:29] you know and and then by the next day or
[1:04:32] so then all of a sudden everything I
[1:04:34] thought everything I've tested
[1:04:36] everything you know or everything that
[1:04:37] I've said confessed everything I heard
[1:04:39] is now being put to the test ain't that
[1:04:43] right I don't feel like I'm gonna make
[1:04:45] it I kind of wonder if I will I wonder
[1:04:47] you know and and then you wonder well I
[1:04:50] wonder where God just went you know and
[1:04:52] and because you was on the Mountaintop
[1:04:54] and now here you are and everything is
[1:04:57] just backslid my emotions have backslid
[1:04:59] my sensation well everything else you
[1:05:02] know because you cannot depend upon
[1:05:05] these five senses
[1:05:07] ain't that right so so here so we go
[1:05:11] through the battle and a lot of times
[1:05:13] you young people may not understand
[1:05:14] these battles I know I didn't and and
[1:05:17] sometimes you know uh it's just been by
[1:05:20] God's grace that we're we're we we get
[1:05:23] settled and but I don't think that you
[1:05:26] have to be an adult to be settled I I
[1:05:29] think if you could really understand
[1:05:31] the tactics of the enemy and and because
[1:05:34] a lot of times you'll go through battles
[1:05:37] and you'll see that here the negative
[1:05:39] you'll you'll see the negative you'll
[1:05:41] think thoughts negative thoughts and all
[1:05:43] these things and Satan will try to put
[1:05:46] it on you as though it's you the one
[1:05:48] that's thinking them things
[1:05:51] he does now if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:54] then you are sealed
[1:05:57] until the day of your Redemption
[1:05:59] Ephesians 4 30 and grief not the holy
[1:06:03] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:06:05] everybody say I'm sealed
[1:06:07] I'm sealed you are sealed into the day
[1:06:10] of what first trial
[1:06:13] the day of redemption
[1:06:16] ain't that right now so what does a seal
[1:06:20] represent a finished work
[1:06:25] I think that's awesome
[1:06:27] a seal represents a finished work
[1:06:35] that means that God when he seals you
[1:06:38] it's over
[1:06:41] he's at rest with you
[1:06:44] he's approved of you
[1:06:47] so now notice he says now the box cars
[1:06:50] loaded and the seal is on it it's
[1:06:55] completed
[1:06:56] can you say that with me it's completed
[1:06:59] it's finished
[1:07:00] right it's bound for its destination
[1:07:06] woe to anyone who will break the seal
[1:07:11] ain't that right
[1:07:13] see another place they are sealed unto
[1:07:16] their Eternal destination there's not
[1:07:20] nothing can ever break that seal
[1:07:25] aren't you glad for that there's nothing
[1:07:28] so it's the grace of God that he gives
[1:07:31] you the Holy Ghost
[1:07:33] now why is God going to give you the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost to seal you up
[1:07:38] now the devil can't touch you
[1:07:41] you're no longer a slave to him
[1:07:44] it's over
[1:07:45] make that right now brother Ryan said
[1:07:48] you take a boxcar they'll start loading
[1:07:51] it and loading it on the track many of
[1:07:53] you people here he said I know some of
[1:07:55] you little cards he says they'll go
[1:07:57] around and they'll call for so much here
[1:07:59] and so much here there but before that
[1:08:02] car can be sealed the inspector has to
[1:08:04] come along
[1:08:05] he looks through and sees that
[1:08:08] everything's in there is tight and
[1:08:10] everything's ready it's going to its
[1:08:13] destination
[1:08:14] well if there's anything loose and
[1:08:17] afraid it'll break he will say take her
[1:08:20] out and fix her over again till you get
[1:08:22] it and when it's all together tightened
[1:08:25] and packed and set down then he will
[1:08:27] slam the doors and seal it and no one
[1:08:32] can break that seal until it goes to its
[1:08:36] Eternal death or till its debt to its
[1:08:38] destination
[1:08:39] so now where is that seal is it on your
[1:08:42] flesh is it on your spirit it's on your
[1:08:45] soul
[1:08:46] ain't that right that's the only place
[1:08:48] that the devil has no claim to
[1:08:51] it's the only place that the devil has
[1:08:54] no right to is your soul
[1:08:57] he can he can afflict your body he can
[1:09:00] mess with your spirit he can go through
[1:09:03] them uh use them five gates of the flesh
[1:09:06] five gates of the of of of the spirit
[1:09:09] but he cannot get to that soul
[1:09:12] if you are sealed can you say man with
[1:09:16] the Seal of God and the Seal of God is
[1:09:19] the Holy Ghost ain't that right now it
[1:09:23] goes the other way too there there's and
[1:09:25] and this is where we're at today and
[1:09:27] this is why the prophet would preach uh
[1:09:30] uh the Seal of God and the Seal of of
[1:09:33] Satan and the Seal of the Antichrist or
[1:09:36] whatever there but he he talks about two
[1:09:39] seals ain't that right because this is
[1:09:42] where we're at is the two seals and and
[1:09:45] so uh uh the word of God do you realize
[1:09:49] as Satan cannot get to a person that is
[1:09:52] sealed uh uh Satan can't touch him
[1:09:56] that the word of God also can't touch a
[1:10:00] person that's been sealed in their soul
[1:10:03] uh by the devil
[1:10:05] now see so so if they have the Seal of
[1:10:09] Satan then that's then the word of God
[1:10:12] can't touch so a seal Works two waves
[1:10:15] you know that which is inside if you
[1:10:19] notice brother Brown talking about that
[1:10:21] boxcar and they they make sure that it's
[1:10:26] there everything is in there before he
[1:10:29] seals the door shut
[1:10:32] now now what what's he doing what's that
[1:10:35] inspector doing and remember brother
[1:10:36] Brown says the inspector shuts the door
[1:10:39] right puts that seal on what has he just
[1:10:43] done everything that's in that boxcar is
[1:10:46] sealed in
[1:10:48] and everything that's not in that boxcar
[1:10:51] is sealed out
[1:10:53] ain't that right
[1:10:55] that that that's that that's right see
[1:10:57] so so what is sealed in can't leak out
[1:11:01] and what's sealed out cathly can
[1:11:05] it's it's sealed ain't that right so if
[1:11:08] you have the Holy Ghost then the Seal of
[1:11:12] God
[1:11:13] Amen uh uh it seals things that are uh
[1:11:20] uh it seals in you things that should be
[1:11:24] in there there's things that that are in
[1:11:26] you that are sealed in and there's
[1:11:29] things that are on the outside that are
[1:11:32] sealed out it can't get to you ain't
[1:11:35] that right again Satan can affect you in
[1:11:38] in in both the spirit Rim flesh Rim but
[1:11:41] he's sealed out from that Soul he can't
[1:11:45] touch you there ain't that right so then
[1:11:47] we find that faith if if you've got the
[1:11:51] spirit of God then then faith is sealed
[1:11:55] in
[1:11:57] and unbelief is sealed out
[1:12:00] the word of God is sealed in and the the
[1:12:05] world is sealed out
[1:12:08] God is sealed in
[1:12:11] right
[1:12:13] and Satan is sealed out that's right now
[1:12:17] notice brother Branham said a seal is
[1:12:20] the security
[1:12:22] can I ask you how many feel secure
[1:12:26] it's a security
[1:12:28] now I know we're in a world of turmoil
[1:12:30] and there's you know we got alarms
[1:12:33] security alarms and all that and homes
[1:12:36] and houses businesses churches and all
[1:12:40] of these things but what about a
[1:12:43] security for us
[1:12:45] people all the time looking for security
[1:12:47] wanting to wanting to uh be secure from
[1:12:51] the thief wanting to be secure from the
[1:12:53] murderer want to be secure a man from
[1:12:55] the the people that's going to steal and
[1:12:58] and do damage and and all of these
[1:13:00] things in other words they want security
[1:13:02] to to things that don't belong in their
[1:13:05] home ain't that right well God purchased
[1:13:09] you he he he he he he bought you with
[1:13:12] the price you are the Church of the
[1:13:14] Living God and you are the Tabernacle of
[1:13:17] God ain't that right so he's not going
[1:13:19] to depend on you to seal all these
[1:13:21] things in he's going to seal it in
[1:13:24] ain't that right it's it's for his per
[1:13:27] it's his home you you you're you're
[1:13:30] you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:33] ain't that right so he is going to seal
[1:13:37] his home up
[1:13:39] to where no devil and Intruder can come
[1:13:43] in and take away your joy take away your
[1:13:46] faith steal steal steal all the
[1:13:49] attributes of God out of your life take
[1:13:52] the power away from you
[1:13:55] he's going to seal it up
[1:13:58] can you say Amen now you ought to feel
[1:14:01] secure because that's what a seal means
[1:14:04] is that you are secured well who is who
[1:14:07] secured you
[1:14:09] God did ain't that right so now he said
[1:14:13] you that don't believe in eternal
[1:14:14] security I don't know but a seal
[1:14:17] signifies security to its destination
[1:14:20] that's why he can already know you're
[1:14:23] coming
[1:14:24] that's why he does things ahead of time
[1:14:26] he's got your theophany already waiting
[1:14:29] he's got your seat at the table already
[1:14:31] waiting why he sealed you it's a
[1:14:36] security
[1:14:37] ain't that right so he says see a seal
[1:14:40] signifies security to its destination
[1:14:42] woe unto that guy that would try to
[1:14:44] break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal
[1:14:46] everybody say the Holy Spirit seal
[1:14:50] cannot be broken
[1:14:52] it can he said you've all heard me say
[1:14:54] that people said the devil made me do
[1:14:57] this no no no the devil didn't do that
[1:14:59] you just wasn't sealed in
[1:15:02] ain't that right so then because when
[1:15:04] you're sealed in he's sealed out
[1:15:07] when you're sealed in he's sealed out
[1:15:09] you understand that church that's why
[1:15:11] you don't have to walk in fear when
[1:15:13] you're sealed in he's sealed out he he
[1:15:16] can hust and puff and try to blow your
[1:15:19] house down but he can't do it there's a
[1:15:21] security
[1:15:23] ain't that rotten so we're not running
[1:15:25] around like the little old pigs and and
[1:15:27] running from the big bad wolf we've
[1:15:29] already been sealed in
[1:15:33] isn't that right and so he says see he
[1:15:36] says now when you're sealed in he's
[1:15:39] sealed out now you went out to him he
[1:15:43] could not get to you because the only
[1:15:46] way he could get to you is is come to
[1:15:48] the same process that you've had you had
[1:15:51] see he said he'd have to be saved
[1:15:53] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:54] didn't be your brother so he didn't do
[1:15:56] it no you just went to the borderline
[1:15:58] and come back listen for the things of
[1:16:00] the world he never went all the way over
[1:16:03] into Canaan land across Jordan to death
[1:16:06] itself can you say man or death to self
[1:16:08] that's right so when it comes to the
[1:16:11] kingdom of God a man can be sealed in
[1:16:14] and he can be sealed out ain't that
[1:16:17] right a man that is sealed out of the
[1:16:20] Kingdom what will happen he will serve
[1:16:22] the devil the rest of his life
[1:16:25] ain't that right why because the word
[1:16:28] can't get to him anymore he can't
[1:16:30] believe the word he can't subject to the
[1:16:33] word for there's nothing there to
[1:16:34] believe with
[1:16:35] there's nothing the prophet said there's
[1:16:37] nothing in him to believe with why he
[1:16:41] sealed out
[1:16:43] so if you've when you've got the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost we ought to be the most thankful
[1:16:46] people
[1:16:48] that's why brother Brown said a
[1:16:50] Christian cannot uh what was that
[1:16:53] crossed come to that line of of where he
[1:16:56] can't come back
[1:16:57] a Believer cannot uh trying to think of
[1:17:00] that word blaspheme
[1:17:02] a Christian can't do that a Believer
[1:17:05] can't why he's sealed in
[1:17:08] every qualification in uh is sealed in
[1:17:12] in him
[1:17:13] you don't have to beg to be a Christian
[1:17:15] it's sealed in you
[1:17:17] ain't that right but if if it's sealed
[1:17:20] out now then there's nothing in there
[1:17:22] notice the devil see the devil that
[1:17:25] lives in them won't let them believe
[1:17:27] their their eyes are blinded from truth
[1:17:30] and they can't believe they haven't got
[1:17:32] nothing to believe with
[1:17:34] ain't that right how can I move a hand
[1:17:37] if I ain't got a hand to move with how
[1:17:39] can I believe God when I'm just looking
[1:17:41] at a word here and him not in here
[1:17:44] see you've got to have God in here first
[1:17:46] before you can believe
[1:17:50] ain't that right it takes God to do that
[1:17:54] now I I I pray that I can get across my
[1:17:57] heart to you what I I want to get across
[1:18:00] now notice brother Brown said you you
[1:18:03] got to get the man right in his heart
[1:18:05] first before he can believe
[1:18:08] ain't that right get God in your heart
[1:18:11] before you can believe but when he's
[1:18:13] there in your heart well then he seals
[1:18:16] he seals doubt out unbelief out
[1:18:20] skepticism out criticism out he he seals
[1:18:24] it all out and Satan no longer has his
[1:18:27] way with you
[1:18:30] why you're sealed to your destination
[1:18:33] I think it's time that we Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] Field Believers quit begging God for
[1:18:38] things quit act like we ain't got
[1:18:40] anything
[1:18:42] if we're sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:44] everything that you have need of is
[1:18:46] already sealed in you
[1:18:49] we're not deprived people we're not
[1:18:51] waiting for God to do something
[1:18:53] spectacular the best thing he could have
[1:18:56] done for you is give you the baptism of
[1:18:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] it's your seal
[1:19:04] praise the Lord
[1:19:06] so he says you've got to get the man
[1:19:08] right in his heart first before he can
[1:19:10] believe he ain't got nothing to believe
[1:19:12] on see he ain't got nothing to believe
[1:19:13] with I'm sure the little infant brain of
[1:19:16] the man knows nothing about belief he's
[1:19:18] got to have something in there uh that
[1:19:21] stimulates his faith and makes him look
[1:19:23] Yonder to his creator so you could not
[1:19:25] believe without him helping
[1:19:29] see but he comes in and stimulates your
[1:19:33] faith it makes a man look Yonder to his
[1:19:36] creator and believes the very god
[1:19:38] brother Brown makes a blowing sound see
[1:19:40] he blew the moon and stars off his hands
[1:19:44] and can do all the thing all these
[1:19:46] things well what happened God come into
[1:19:49] that heart
[1:19:50] he's the one that's stimulating the
[1:19:52] faith he's the one that's stimulating
[1:19:54] everything
[1:19:57] I'm gonna seal it up for his home
[1:20:01] brother Brian goes all the way back to
[1:20:03] predestination that a man has to be
[1:20:06] predestinated to believe
[1:20:09] brother Branham you know we all know the
[1:20:11] story talk to Dr best
[1:20:13] and um that I didn't believe in Divine
[1:20:17] Healing he was a Baptist or claimed to
[1:20:19] be and didn't believe in Divine Healing
[1:20:21] and he made fun of it and so he wrote in
[1:20:23] the in the paper that brother Branham
[1:20:25] was an imposter and uh that was imposing
[1:20:29] himself as a servant of God and needed
[1:20:31] to be run out of town and he would like
[1:20:33] to be the man to do that
[1:20:35] and so he challenged brother Branham to
[1:20:38] a debate and and brother Brandon would
[1:20:40] not accept the challenge and brother
[1:20:43] Branham explained why he wouldn't accept
[1:20:45] the challenge and and I I thought it was
[1:20:47] good he said all the fussing you could
[1:20:49] do with that man he'd walk away with the
[1:20:51] same belief he had when he come in
[1:20:54] see you don't get nothing by fussing
[1:20:57] Jesus didn't come to fuss he just done
[1:20:59] what the father told him if they
[1:21:01] believed it all right if they didn't all
[1:21:04] right anyhow see so after all if God
[1:21:06] confirms the word see Jesus said if you
[1:21:08] can't believe me why believe the works
[1:21:11] that I do then see them believe the
[1:21:13] works that I do that the father has sent
[1:21:15] me and so brother Ram goes on we were
[1:21:17] having about 8 000 people now and there
[1:21:20] was about seven thousand of them wanting
[1:21:21] to be prayed for and and to give one of
[1:21:24] these nights to fuss with that preacher
[1:21:25] and the only thing you do is he's going
[1:21:27] to go away he's born he if he's born an
[1:21:31] unbeliever God made him an unbeliever
[1:21:34] and how's he going to be anything else
[1:21:36] but an unbeliever see God predestinated
[1:21:39] a man men of old was forordained to this
[1:21:44] condemnation the Bible says see so if
[1:21:46] they can't believe everybody say if they
[1:21:48] can't believe
[1:21:49] if they can't believe it's just like
[1:21:52] pouring water from a duck's back they
[1:21:55] can't believe they ain't got nothing to
[1:21:56] believe with ain't that right see then
[1:21:59] what is it their whole soul is subject
[1:22:02] to the devil
[1:22:03] no matter what God does no matter the
[1:22:05] supernatural that God performs no matter
[1:22:07] what he could come down in flesh in
[1:22:10] person and they still wouldn't believe
[1:22:11] it
[1:22:12] remember that man that told Brother
[1:22:14] Brown said I don't care how many
[1:22:15] miracles you do I still won't believe it
[1:22:17] brother Brown said certainly not you're
[1:22:19] an unbeliever
[1:22:21] what he ain't got nothing to believe
[1:22:22] with ain't that right so you'll never
[1:22:25] convince him to be a Christian but you
[1:22:27] think of the man that's been
[1:22:28] predestinated to believe think of the
[1:22:30] man that God has come into that soul and
[1:22:33] sealed it up no trial is big enough no
[1:22:36] devil is big enough no hell is hot
[1:22:39] enough
[1:22:40] that's why you're standing today
[1:22:45] ain't that right
[1:22:47] you can take you can take all your
[1:22:49] trials and you can take all the horror
[1:22:52] and all these things that that P you see
[1:22:54] you hear you witness and the the things
[1:22:57] that you you you you you you go through
[1:23:00] on a daily basis and you know what it's
[1:23:03] just like pouring water on a duck's back
[1:23:06] it ain't gonna affect you because the
[1:23:09] soul has been sealed away
[1:23:15] so what is it so a man that sealed out
[1:23:17] the kingdom faith is sealed out and
[1:23:19] unbelief is sealed in
[1:23:21] so brother Graham said a person has to
[1:23:23] be ordained of God to believe or they'll
[1:23:25] never believe anyhow they have nothing
[1:23:27] to believe with they just don't have no
[1:23:29] depths
[1:23:30] of their soul
[1:23:33] now Satan can affect your physical body
[1:23:35] as we said he can he can affect you
[1:23:37] mentally
[1:23:39] in your mind
[1:23:40] ain't that right
[1:23:42] he can affect you in your spirit but
[1:23:45] that has nothing to do with you being
[1:23:48] lost
[1:23:51] because the seal is on your soul
[1:23:57] Satan will make you feel like you're
[1:24:00] lost
[1:24:01] he will try his best to make you look at
[1:24:04] the circumstance instead of God's word
[1:24:07] ain't that right
[1:24:09] he works on our emotions our memory our
[1:24:13] Sensations our affections he works with
[1:24:17] what we see with what we hear with what
[1:24:20] we uh feel what we taste what all of
[1:24:24] these things but that doesn't mean that
[1:24:27] he has you
[1:24:30] I want you to really understand that
[1:24:32] young people it doesn't mean that he has
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:36] you'll wake up on the wrong side of the
[1:24:37] bed tomorrow
[1:24:40] feel grumpy feel Moody
[1:24:43] fill out a sort
[1:24:46] I don't mean you ain't a Christian
[1:24:49] give it next week
[1:24:52] hopefully you'll wake up on the other
[1:24:54] side of the bed
[1:25:00] but what I like about real Believers and
[1:25:03] and you young people understand this
[1:25:05] because you've got a lot of oak trees if
[1:25:07] I could say it that way a lot of oak
[1:25:09] trees brother random looked at at the
[1:25:12] evolves Bosworth as an oak tree
[1:25:15] and he told tell Osborne you said under
[1:25:17] that oak tree learn
[1:25:20] and you've got a lot of oak trees here
[1:25:22] tonight
[1:25:23] that
[1:25:25] and and hey I know how it is I know I
[1:25:28] know how Satan works it gets you it's so
[1:25:31] isolated in your own mind to where you
[1:25:33] think you're the only individual that is
[1:25:36] going through things
[1:25:38] to where you think that you're the only
[1:25:40] one that's got problems
[1:25:42] have you all ever been there I've been
[1:25:44] there
[1:25:45] and you know I've had to be reminded by
[1:25:48] other people that they got problems too
[1:25:53] I remember when I lost my wife you know
[1:25:56] I I was you know
[1:25:58] I was about crazy
[1:26:00] and I just thought I was really going
[1:26:02] through something
[1:26:03] and someone wanted me to watch a a
[1:26:08] YouTube about a testimony of Gary Walker
[1:26:12] I ever listen to Gary Walker you know
[1:26:14] and and he starts giving his testimony
[1:26:17] of how he's traveling and with him his
[1:26:21] wife his daughter and that log truck
[1:26:23] tipped over and all them logs fell on
[1:26:25] their vehicle
[1:26:26] he was pronounced dead
[1:26:29] on the scene
[1:26:31] and and God revived him and all the
[1:26:37] horror that he went through you know and
[1:26:40] I I have to say that that rotario really
[1:26:43] helped me
[1:26:45] well I can make it he he went through
[1:26:47] every bone in his body was broke
[1:26:49] and he literally saw death standing at
[1:26:52] his at the bedside you know and and you
[1:26:56] know they had that they had to wire all
[1:26:58] of his teeth in and then then you know
[1:27:03] uh uh his guns grew Over The Wire
[1:27:06] and so the doctor comes in big old Stout
[1:27:09] dude with pliers and just grabs it and
[1:27:12] Yanks it out he passes out you know and
[1:27:15] as he's telling me these things I'm
[1:27:17] thinking well I thought I really had it
[1:27:19] bad you know but but and what I'm saying
[1:27:21] is Satan was trying to put me into a
[1:27:25] place that I thought I was the only guy
[1:27:27] and of course when he does that he can
[1:27:29] just deal with you then
[1:27:31] you know and and woe is me and and and
[1:27:35] all these things and I'm not saying it
[1:27:37] wasn't bad for me but I just looking
[1:27:39] around everybody else is having it rough
[1:27:40] too here and and so and and so you young
[1:27:44] people when you go through battles and
[1:27:46] you go through trials don't let the
[1:27:48] devil fiend and make you think that
[1:27:49] nobody understands what you're going
[1:27:51] through because that's a lie
[1:27:53] there's everybody that knows what you're
[1:27:55] going through the the thing is is there
[1:27:58] are people that have learned how to deal
[1:28:01] with it
[1:28:02] there are people that have learned not
[1:28:04] to give in to that
[1:28:07] you understand what I'm saying
[1:28:09] yeah you're gonna find people that just
[1:28:10] give up on life period
[1:28:13] but think of all the people that hasn't
[1:28:16] given up
[1:28:18] think of all the people that didn't walk
[1:28:20] away
[1:28:21] think of all the people that endured can
[1:28:24] you say man but see so you're going to
[1:28:27] see both sides of this thing you're
[1:28:29] going to see people walk away from the
[1:28:30] message and if Satan can get you looking
[1:28:32] at that and then he start working on
[1:28:35] your mind see there wasn't nothing to it
[1:28:36] there ain't nothing to it it's just all
[1:28:38] fraud it's all fake it's all that you're
[1:28:40] just believing a scam a lie and all that
[1:28:42] but look at the people that has never
[1:28:44] walked away and has been blessed by
[1:28:47] staying with the message and believing
[1:28:49] the message and preaching the message
[1:28:50] and living this message
[1:28:55] can you say man so so don't let the
[1:28:58] devil take your your eyes and then you
[1:29:00] start to send what you see starts
[1:29:02] working on your imagination and your
[1:29:04] reasoning and all that don't don't let
[1:29:06] the devil just have his way with what
[1:29:08] you hear look at what the promises
[1:29:11] you've heard look at the the the the
[1:29:13] promises and what the Miracles of what
[1:29:16] God has done that you've seen
[1:29:21] you've seen
[1:29:25] is that right
[1:29:27] so Satan works on her emotions our
[1:29:31] memory Sensations affections he works on
[1:29:34] everything what we see taste feel here
[1:29:36] smell but that doesn't mean he has you
[1:29:39] and it does not mean you're possessed
[1:29:41] with the Devil
[1:29:42] he gonna work with you mentally
[1:29:49] as I I think I've said before that
[1:29:52] there's a big problem
[1:29:55] today and that's mental
[1:29:57] people really going through mental
[1:29:59] struggles
[1:30:01] in their mind
[1:30:04] like they're just going to clap so
[1:30:06] they're just gonna they don't know what
[1:30:08] to do
[1:30:09] you think of the people that have lost
[1:30:11] it mentally
[1:30:15] and then of course when you're seeing
[1:30:17] these things
[1:30:20] Satan will start affecting your mind and
[1:30:22] make you think you're going to go that
[1:30:24] way
[1:30:25] you understand what I'm saying
[1:30:27] but but but if you can look at the word
[1:30:30] of God
[1:30:32] so I bet that doesn't mean just because
[1:30:34] you're going through these things
[1:30:34] doesn't mean you're possessed of the
[1:30:36] devil
[1:30:37] can you say man
[1:30:38] people torment and mentally and it's
[1:30:40] it's getting even worse and it seems
[1:30:43] brother Brown's already told us that it
[1:30:46] would be a mental thing
[1:30:48] ain't that right people are literally
[1:30:51] going the mental and institutions are
[1:30:54] filling up
[1:30:57] yeah they don't know what to do with
[1:30:59] these people
[1:31:01] and sometimes it seems like you're going
[1:31:03] to break but you won't break
[1:31:05] I just want to tell you God has sealed
[1:31:09] you
[1:31:11] you're sealed can you say man
[1:31:14] so so Believers have these issues
[1:31:18] you know holy ghost-filled people have
[1:31:20] these issues
[1:31:22] Holy Ghost Field
[1:31:24] that if their Holy Ghost Field they're
[1:31:26] sealed
[1:31:28] can you say Amen so the devil can
[1:31:31] manifest himself in your body he can
[1:31:33] affect your mind he can do whatever but
[1:31:35] that Soul has he has no right to he has
[1:31:38] no claim he cannot touch it
[1:31:46] again all of our senses are affected
[1:31:49] by both positive and negative you're
[1:31:52] going to hear the negative as well as
[1:31:53] the positive
[1:31:55] but it can only enter the soul
[1:31:59] by free moral agency
[1:32:03] now I want you to
[1:32:06] actually turn with me if you will in
[1:32:09] your Bibles
[1:32:11] to First Peter 2 and 11.
[1:32:25] first Peter 2 and 11.
[1:32:28] when you're there Say Amen
[1:32:35] it says dearly beloved I beseech you as
[1:32:37] what
[1:32:39] strangers and pilgrims
[1:32:42] abstain from fleshly lusts
[1:32:46] which war against the what
[1:32:48] the soul
[1:32:50] so you see there is a Warfare that is
[1:32:54] going on and it's for your soul
[1:32:59] right you you can be healed today in
[1:33:02] your body and be sick tomorrow
[1:33:04] with something else
[1:33:07] you can you can get over one trial today
[1:33:10] and rejoice for a minute
[1:33:12] and it seemed like that's about as the
[1:33:15] span of our victories sometimes of our
[1:33:17] rejoicing
[1:33:19] is you you have a trial and then you you
[1:33:22] like it it subsides or whatever and
[1:33:25] you're like
[1:33:28] with another one
[1:33:31] it's constant
[1:33:36] it's because you're subject
[1:33:39] to these things
[1:33:41] but the soul
[1:33:43] it's finished
[1:33:45] there's an eternal rest
[1:33:48] there was an eternal destination
[1:33:51] so but what these things are doing it's
[1:33:53] coming against your soul
[1:33:55] is trying to affect your soul and you
[1:33:58] say Amen
[1:33:59] I wished I could really describe it to
[1:34:01] you to really get it down in to you
[1:34:03] of how that these things are trying to
[1:34:06] affect the soul
[1:34:08] he'll affect your emotions your feelings
[1:34:10] to where you start feeling alone
[1:34:13] you start feeling like no one cares you
[1:34:16] start feel like no one's listening no
[1:34:18] one understands young people I know I
[1:34:22] know where you you go through because
[1:34:24] we've been there
[1:34:25] how many adults have been there
[1:34:29] been there so young people you're not
[1:34:31] alone we've been there
[1:34:34] we we have so much emotions and things
[1:34:37] and you know I've I've talked about it
[1:34:40] how especially Teenage life
[1:34:43] it's it's it's a time uh to to where
[1:34:47] it's it's really a no man's land
[1:34:49] because you're you're coming from
[1:34:52] childhood and childhood you know you're
[1:34:55] comfortable is these these children
[1:34:57] they're just comfortable at being what
[1:34:59] they're at identifying with what they
[1:35:02] are you know and that's you know uh I
[1:35:06] guess it's okay and I'm not gonna be
[1:35:08] politically correct but you know playing
[1:35:10] the Cowboys and the Indians and and uh
[1:35:14] you know and playing with the dolls and
[1:35:16] the trucks and uh you understand what
[1:35:19] I'm saying and mom's mom's taking care
[1:35:21] of supper Dad's doing you know taking
[1:35:23] care of the finances no worries no
[1:35:26] nothing just it's just free man you know
[1:35:30] and then you you start changing and the
[1:35:35] voice starts squeaking and you know
[1:35:38] um your desires begin to change girls
[1:35:41] used to have cooties you know and the
[1:35:43] boys used to have fleas and and they
[1:35:46] stunk and and all these things and and
[1:35:49] now things are changing
[1:35:52] and what what is going on is you're
[1:35:55] becoming an adult
[1:35:58] not only is your body changing your mind
[1:36:00] is changing
[1:36:02] then your faith now you're having to
[1:36:03] start thinking of the future
[1:36:06] right
[1:36:08] and I think a lot of times you know
[1:36:12] where the misunderstanding is is parents
[1:36:15] don't understand their child as a
[1:36:17] teenager
[1:36:19] uh
[1:36:21] for one the teenager can get to the
[1:36:23] place where he thinks he knows it all
[1:36:26] become smart alec becomes this and it's
[1:36:29] usually just shooting at the mouth and
[1:36:31] saying things he shouldn't say she
[1:36:33] shouldn't say it's and they're doing it
[1:36:36] without thinking you know and and and
[1:36:39] and and and then the child's thing the
[1:36:41] parents don't understand this because
[1:36:43] they're all the time tell us to shut up
[1:36:44] and stop this and quit that and you know
[1:36:47] it becomes there's a gap there
[1:36:50] and we thinking we wish the children
[1:36:52] child would grow up you know something's
[1:36:55] happened to him he he's he he he come
[1:36:58] out the door one way and he's come back
[1:37:00] in totally weird you know and and and
[1:37:04] it's it's because our children grow up
[1:37:06] so fast and so but it's in this time
[1:37:09] that the child you know you teenagers
[1:37:12] you're trying to figure things out for
[1:37:14] yourself you're trying to figure life
[1:37:16] out
[1:37:16] what is my future what is my who do am I
[1:37:20] going to marry who am I going to you
[1:37:22] know what is my career what what am I to
[1:37:25] do and and and the responsibility starts
[1:37:28] Weighing on your shoulders and yet
[1:37:30] you're between childhood and you're
[1:37:32] between adulthood and adults really
[1:37:34] don't like you around them too much and
[1:37:37] and but but you don't want to be a child
[1:37:39] because you look stupid you know you're
[1:37:42] the tallest kid sitting here playing
[1:37:43] blocks you know and and all of that and
[1:37:47] so that you don't understand adulthood
[1:37:49] either you don't understand why they
[1:37:50] just sit around and talk and you know
[1:37:52] and they don't want you talking out back
[1:37:54] you know and and and it's just there
[1:37:57] there's a time of of misplacement
[1:38:00] there's a time of No Man's Land and
[1:38:03] Satan takes advantage of that time
[1:38:07] right
[1:38:09] he takes it because you become more
[1:38:11] vulnerable
[1:38:13] and before you know it he wants to draw
[1:38:15] you away from your parents he wants to
[1:38:17] draw you away from the church he wants
[1:38:19] to draw you away to where you feel
[1:38:21] isolated you you feel like no one likes
[1:38:24] you you don't you don't feel like
[1:38:25] anybody cares you don't feel like
[1:38:27] anything that's the devil
[1:38:30] and he's trying to put an identity on
[1:38:33] you that you are not
[1:38:39] you say Amen
[1:38:41] that's right
[1:38:42] he wants to put an identity on you and
[1:38:45] so what he's doing he's trying to war
[1:38:48] against your soul
[1:38:50] he's warring against your soul can you
[1:38:52] say man
[1:38:53] now you know
[1:38:55] um and and then you start questioning
[1:38:57] did I really get the Holy Ghost did I
[1:38:59] really have something genuine that I did
[1:39:02] I really you know well what you're
[1:39:04] facing is is Satan is not going to let
[1:39:08] you keep your testimony
[1:39:10] where there's nothing going on I mean
[1:39:13] the battles doesn't start when you get a
[1:39:16] certain age
[1:39:19] so I can't tell you okay you got 10 more
[1:39:21] years and then when you hit 30 you're
[1:39:25] watch out no
[1:39:27] every one of us is going through our
[1:39:29] battles
[1:39:31] and you say man
[1:39:34] now it doesn't look like a lot of times
[1:39:35] that the adults are going through
[1:39:37] battles because they know how to hide it
[1:39:40] they know how to stabilize themselves
[1:39:42] and when I say stabilize what I mean is
[1:39:45] they're being they're rooted more in the
[1:39:47] word of God or they should be
[1:39:50] should be so rooted in that word that
[1:39:53] when a trial comes you know they may
[1:39:55] just uh like that you know and get hit
[1:39:58] but they're standing
[1:40:00] whereas you know uh uh uh sometimes a a
[1:40:04] a younger person in the Lord they can
[1:40:07] get hit and just about blocks them off
[1:40:08] on their seat in
[1:40:10] but as you learn to to to handle and to
[1:40:15] grow and uh uh well well brother Brown
[1:40:19] said that how you overcome is to
[1:40:21] recognize the devil and every one of his
[1:40:23] tricks
[1:40:25] you understand what I'm saying The
[1:40:27] Temptations that he brings your way
[1:40:28] recognize that is not you it's of the
[1:40:30] devil
[1:40:36] so we find he's warring against your
[1:40:39] soul now so again what what you are in
[1:40:42] your soul is what counts and by your
[1:40:45] first birth your soul is smutty and
[1:40:47] black you can have the carnal nature or
[1:40:50] you have a carnal nature and and of
[1:40:52] course the prophet said the soul is the
[1:40:54] nature of the spirit ain't that right so
[1:40:57] you're automatically going to think
[1:40:58] wrong talk wrong act wrong do things
[1:41:01] that are wrong and and it's because the
[1:41:04] carnal mind is enmity against God it
[1:41:07] cannot be subject to the law of God to
[1:41:09] the things of God can you say Amen it
[1:41:12] just can't and this is why you know
[1:41:15] brother Brown talking about needing a
[1:41:17] guide uh or he said you don't need a God
[1:41:19] when you're walking the broad way he
[1:41:22] said because you know all the alleys and
[1:41:23] everything else you know all the way to
[1:41:25] sin you oh you've been around a long
[1:41:27] time there's no need of somebody trying
[1:41:28] to tell you about all that see you know
[1:41:31] all the shortcuts that's right every sin
[1:41:33] you know all about see nobody has to
[1:41:36] tell you how to steal and nobody to ask
[1:41:38] to tell you how to curse you know that
[1:41:40] see nobody has to tell you how to do
[1:41:42] these evil things because it's posted on
[1:41:44] every tree everywhere on every tree
[1:41:46] everywhere see so uh uh this is why it's
[1:41:50] so easy for a common born man to go the
[1:41:53] the flow of the world
[1:41:56] it's so easy it's it's it's such an
[1:41:58] enticement amen to that carnal
[1:42:01] individual that unregenerated man and it
[1:42:04] becomes a temptation to us even that has
[1:42:07] the Holy Ghost
[1:42:08] because it's it's just what we were it's
[1:42:11] what we are you know and this is why
[1:42:13] politics are shifting more to evil
[1:42:15] things
[1:42:17] because there's nothing holy about
[1:42:19] politics
[1:42:20] ain't that right church denominations
[1:42:22] are shifting and becoming more open to
[1:42:25] sinful living
[1:42:27] because there's nothing holy about a
[1:42:29] denomination
[1:42:31] ain't that right culture is Shifting and
[1:42:33] accepting the evil inventions and ways
[1:42:36] of man and it's becoming an unconverted
[1:42:39] man that's what it is it's becoming to
[1:42:42] an unconverted man a man to move in the
[1:42:46] direction that the world is going into
[1:42:51] ain't that right it's just common
[1:42:54] God doesn't get a hold of a child
[1:42:56] brother Brandon said if he got the
[1:42:57] brother of Billy Paul didn't get the
[1:43:00] Holy Ghost he'd be dancing or rock and
[1:43:02] roll would get him
[1:43:03] when he got older you understand what
[1:43:05] I'm saying so now the word of God is
[1:43:08] becoming more obsolete all the time
[1:43:11] now uh why because the Bible already
[1:43:14] said it he said there'd be a famine for
[1:43:16] the word of God for the for for for the
[1:43:19] hearing of the word of God ain't that
[1:43:21] right in another place he said that
[1:43:23] people would Rome to and fro running
[1:43:25] Amen to and fro trying to find the word
[1:43:28] of God but they shall not find it
[1:43:30] ain't that right so so we're looking at
[1:43:34] these things the world is living their
[1:43:37] life without the standard of the word of
[1:43:39] God that you have
[1:43:43] now brother Graham says show me what you
[1:43:44] read show me what you listen to Let me
[1:43:47] hear the songs that you like best and
[1:43:49] I'll tell you what's in your soul that's
[1:43:51] feeding on it
[1:43:53] ain't that right so as I get ready to
[1:43:56] close if your soul is a gene seed of God
[1:43:59] then it comes from God ain't that right
[1:44:01] amen that Soul came from God and that is
[1:44:06] the control tower
[1:44:09] and if that Soul has been quickened then
[1:44:11] there's a new nature that's there
[1:44:14] ain't that right aren't you glad for
[1:44:15] that a new nature which which means that
[1:44:18] you wasn't born with that nature
[1:44:21] which means that you've got a desire
[1:44:23] that you wasn't born with in the natural
[1:44:26] you you you you've got a craving that
[1:44:28] you wasn't born with in the natural
[1:44:33] and now what has what does it do it
[1:44:36] becomes pliable to the word
[1:44:38] why because Satan no longer has a place
[1:44:42] in your soul
[1:44:44] he no longer has a way to you
[1:44:47] the word of God does
[1:44:49] the word of God does
[1:44:51] now this your word the word of God is
[1:44:53] your guide the word of God is your
[1:44:55] Fortress the word of God right here
[1:44:57] it's your God ain't that right
[1:45:00] and if your soul has been quickened then
[1:45:03] there's a new nature within and it
[1:45:05] becomes acceptant to this word
[1:45:09] now that unconverted Soul what does it
[1:45:12] do it reasons everything away
[1:45:15] which you're you're you're you get the
[1:45:17] let the word of God just to stay in your
[1:45:19] senses of of the spirit and you'll
[1:45:22] reason it
[1:45:24] yeah you'll explain it away because
[1:45:25] there's nothing there
[1:45:27] to to to to to reject that reasoning
[1:45:33] see so now you are still still a free
[1:45:36] moral agent to accept or to reject
[1:45:38] brother Brandon said this you can accept
[1:45:39] or turn away
[1:45:41] and that's the only Avenue to that
[1:45:44] if you accept the will of God through
[1:45:46] the spirit or the soul God's spirit
[1:45:49] takes his place in your heart and the
[1:45:51] con and controls the rest of you
[1:45:53] you with me if you do not accept that
[1:45:56] then the enemy takes that spot and
[1:45:58] controls the rest of you
[1:46:01] so it lays in that
[1:46:03] now we've looked and and and and we've
[1:46:06] seen that false doctrines and traditions
[1:46:07] of men and Creeds and all these things
[1:46:09] have been taught throughout the years
[1:46:11] and and they tried to latch on to us
[1:46:15] they've tried the world you know has
[1:46:17] tried to latch on to us but I I want you
[1:46:20] to look uh John 15 and 7. Jesus said if
[1:46:24] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:46:27] you
[1:46:28] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:46:32] be done unto you
[1:46:34] can you say Amen
[1:46:36] so so if you think of it through all
[1:46:39] these things now we're looking at that
[1:46:40] soul for just a moment but the word of
[1:46:43] God has to be deposited in you
[1:46:47] it has to be
[1:46:49] deposited and then it is to abide in you
[1:46:52] the soul
[1:46:54] ain't that right the prophet said your
[1:46:56] soul is the womb he said when Eve got
[1:46:59] perverted and listened to a lie of the
[1:47:01] the devil and took a wrong seed in the
[1:47:03] womb of her soul to believe one word and
[1:47:05] twisted ain't that right so the word
[1:47:08] comes into your heart
[1:47:10] by revelation
[1:47:12] if there's ever a time we need
[1:47:14] Revelation it's it's now
[1:47:17] there's ever a time that you need
[1:47:19] Revelation that the lord loves you it's
[1:47:20] now there's ever a time that you need
[1:47:23] Revelation that you're healed or that
[1:47:24] you're saved or or uh that you're on
[1:47:27] your way to heaven it's it's now the
[1:47:30] revelation of God can you say man that's
[1:47:32] how the word comes to you is by
[1:47:34] revelation we can talk about it we can
[1:47:37] say it we can sing about it we can do it
[1:47:39] everything else but but but it'll be
[1:47:41] like water on a duck's back but when it
[1:47:44] comes to to Revelation if the word can
[1:47:48] really get revealed to you it goes past
[1:47:49] your senses of of your flesh of your
[1:47:52] spirit and it enters into that soul of
[1:47:55] man
[1:47:57] so he says see if you if you abide in me
[1:48:00] and my word abide in you and that word
[1:48:01] abide means to continue to dwell endure
[1:48:05] remain
[1:48:07] so you continue in him because you're
[1:48:11] sealed in him and the word continues or
[1:48:14] remains in you because it is sealed up
[1:48:18] in you
[1:48:20] and you say man
[1:48:22] so brother Brown says when a man has
[1:48:25] been born again by the word of God
[1:48:27] predestinated to eternal life called the
[1:48:29] elected it'll be the word of God on top
[1:48:31] of word word on Word
[1:48:35] then then you're going to look
[1:48:38] the excitement of things is not the one
[1:48:42] that the thing that's going to drive you
[1:48:43] anymore
[1:48:44] it's going to be the word of God
[1:48:47] ain't that right
[1:48:49] um
[1:48:50] you know the worldly things maybe your
[1:48:53] friends doing things or young other
[1:48:55] young people doing things that you know
[1:48:57] is not right with the word of God
[1:48:59] that's not going to be an enticement to
[1:49:02] you as much as it used to be
[1:49:05] because now you're not looking for them
[1:49:08] things to thrive on to feed off of
[1:49:12] you're looking at the word of God
[1:49:15] and you're meditating upon the word of
[1:49:18] God and you're letting the word control
[1:49:20] you
[1:49:22] don't let the world control you
[1:49:25] don't let the things of amusements in
[1:49:28] the world control you
[1:49:30] don't let it drive you
[1:49:32] to where you become unsettled in the
[1:49:36] word because to where you become
[1:49:38] unsettled in the church
[1:49:40] to where you become unsettled in
[1:49:42] everything
[1:49:43] you're looking at everything else out
[1:49:45] here and that's fine but now let's look
[1:49:48] at it that God has called you for a
[1:49:50] purpose
[1:49:52] what is your purpose
[1:49:56] and you're coming to a place especially
[1:49:58] you young people
[1:50:00] you're coming to a place that God's got
[1:50:02] to use you in some way
[1:50:06] and you've got to come to a place that
[1:50:09] you've become established in your heart
[1:50:12] in your thoughts
[1:50:13] in in in in your conduct
[1:50:17] to where you start taking on that
[1:50:19] responsibility Dad can't keep you mom
[1:50:21] can't keep you
[1:50:23] no one else a pastor can't keep you
[1:50:26] you've got to come to your own grips
[1:50:30] that when you come to your trials you
[1:50:33] can stand true
[1:50:35] and be that faithful individual
[1:50:39] and can you say man
[1:50:41] we're looking and I'm going to close
[1:50:44] but this generation is a is is a
[1:50:48] they want to be entertained
[1:50:51] they they want to have fun fun fun fun
[1:50:54] fun fun fun
[1:50:55] if someone else is having fun let's go
[1:50:57] do that then
[1:50:59] and they'll they'll woefully I mean it's
[1:51:01] getting to the place that if if the
[1:51:03] husband gets tired of the wife let's go
[1:51:04] for her let's go for the woman that has
[1:51:06] the fun
[1:51:08] if the if if the wife gets tired of the
[1:51:10] husband the old fuddy daddy you know
[1:51:13] he can't excite me no more so let's go
[1:51:15] do this
[1:51:17] and we say oh that's bad but what about
[1:51:19] other people
[1:51:21] can't find them faithful in church
[1:51:22] anymore because they're too busy looking
[1:51:25] for fun
[1:51:26] out other things
[1:51:28] you can't find solid people anymore
[1:51:32] children want to change families now
[1:51:36] this is why parents are just fuddy-duddy
[1:51:38] they look at every other parent oh man
[1:51:40] they're having fun out there they got
[1:51:42] the gold cards and they got this and
[1:51:43] they got that what do we have a
[1:51:45] treehouse
[1:51:46] foreign
[1:51:49] tree
[1:51:51] and I had to make it you know what I'm
[1:51:53] saying
[1:51:57] and before you know it we're looking at
[1:51:59] everything else instead just being
[1:52:00] established and content with what God
[1:52:02] made us to be
[1:52:05] so this is where it comes into the soul
[1:52:09] you've got to be rooted and grounded in
[1:52:11] the soul
[1:52:12] and this word can only satisfy you
[1:52:16] can you say Amen meditate on the
[1:52:18] positive
[1:52:20] you'll be surprised and and we've
[1:52:22] already talked about it the word of God
[1:52:24] is the only positive thing there is
[1:52:26] quit looking at everything else and see
[1:52:29] where God has blessed you at
[1:52:35] wouldn't you think it funny
[1:52:38] wouldn't you think it funny if your
[1:52:40] husband you sisters that are married
[1:52:41] your husband
[1:52:43] says you know deary
[1:52:45] sweetie poo
[1:52:50] h I was at the store the other day and
[1:52:53] this girl winked at me and I had
[1:52:54] feelings I mean just something there was
[1:52:57] a connection
[1:52:59] so I got her number
[1:53:03] we're going to go on a date because
[1:53:05] every time you wink at me I I don't feel
[1:53:07] nothing
[1:53:09] you just kind of lost it
[1:53:15] ain't that ridiculous
[1:53:24] but how many people do the same thing
[1:53:27] well the church ain't satisfying me no
[1:53:28] more
[1:53:30] so let's go somewhere else
[1:53:32] let's go see let's get satisfaction
[1:53:35] message came in satisfying people so
[1:53:37] let's go find satisfaction
[1:53:39] why because they're looking for
[1:53:41] something that excites them in the
[1:53:43] spirit Realm
[1:53:45] and it's not the spirit realm that
[1:53:48] counts
[1:53:49] is as a man thinketh in his heart so is
[1:53:52] he
[1:53:54] so you come to know that every family is
[1:53:57] going to have trials
[1:53:59] Mom and Dad ain't going to be you be on
[1:54:01] your your your pedestal all the time
[1:54:06] especially when teenagers get there
[1:54:08] right
[1:54:14] and then then you realize that
[1:54:18] maybe we we've been here you know for
[1:54:20] whatever years and
[1:54:22] man you know we just see the same old
[1:54:24] people
[1:54:29] then you start oh man they're doing
[1:54:31] really something nice over there
[1:54:33] you know what I'm saying and before you
[1:54:35] know it you're looking at well here's
[1:54:37] the thing though you get your new car
[1:54:39] you get excited about it but it gets old
[1:54:44] you're always going if if you develop a
[1:54:47] spirit like that you become you're going
[1:54:48] to trade your models in
[1:54:51] and they do it in all kinds of levels
[1:54:53] whether it's trading your husband
[1:54:55] trading their wife trading their
[1:54:56] children trading the preacher trading
[1:54:58] the the Saints trading churches trading
[1:55:01] whatever some even got to the point
[1:55:03] they're going to trade Nations
[1:55:08] because they're always looking for
[1:55:09] something else instead of looking what
[1:55:11] God has blessed them with
[1:55:13] I it blows my mind how people can look
[1:55:15] at America and claim to be American and
[1:55:18] looking over somewhere else as if
[1:55:19] there's something better
[1:55:21] I don't get it I understand that America
[1:55:24] is rotten and it's it's something else
[1:55:26] but I'm so glad to be in America
[1:55:31] and as the prophet said we bear with
[1:55:33] their shame we bear their reproach we
[1:55:35] bear it all well with the gospel is the
[1:55:36] same way
[1:55:39] and that's what makes you settle that's
[1:55:40] what makes you a pillar That's What
[1:55:42] Makes You concrete is you're willing not
[1:55:45] only did handle it for I'm I'm the guy
[1:55:47] you know someone gives me gum I only
[1:55:49] like the gum when the flavor's there
[1:55:54] and after one minute and the flavor's
[1:55:56] gone I take the gum out I want another
[1:55:58] one
[1:56:01] I don't understand why people just want
[1:56:03] chew gum all you know there ain't no
[1:56:05] flavor there
[1:56:07] but if you take that in the spirit Realm
[1:56:10] we're going to trade everything
[1:56:13] and before you know it you become
[1:56:14] unstable
[1:56:16] Trials come you're looking for something
[1:56:19] else to appease you
[1:56:20] even only in your Christian walk
[1:56:23] you understand what I'm saying you you
[1:56:26] know that there's going to be times that
[1:56:27] in your Christian walk you're not going
[1:56:30] to feel God
[1:56:31] what are you going to do then
[1:56:33] when you don't feel God where are you
[1:56:34] going to go well you're going to switch
[1:56:36] gods
