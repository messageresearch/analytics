You're a present God. And Father, [music] there's not one need that's been read across this sacred desk tonight that we know, Lord, that you're able to move upon that need, Father. Lord, the sicknesses, Lord, you're the healer, Father.

You know, this song is, you know, I thought I was looking for Jesus, but he was looking for me all the time. All I had to do is stop. One night while on life raging sea looked as if I would suffer [music] defeat as a darkness of [singing] night close [music] off the light. My heart thinks with sear. My desperate pride ran out with [music and singing] flight. All I could see was no hope in sight. With free fall but [music and singing] gone. day I met the one who came looking for me.

As we turn it over to our pastor, I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Oh, I [music] need thee [singing] every [singing] [music] hour. I need thee, Lord. Oh, yes.

Every hour, every moment. Oh [singing] yes. Every hour [music] I need thee. Oh, bless [music] me now, [singing] my savior. [music] I come [singing] to [music] thee. [music] You know, it's a good thing to know that it's not that we [music] just have this desire for him and need him, but he has shown [music] himself to be alive and well. And [music] as the prophet said, "My message is to declare that he's here. He's here among [music] us. We're not just serving some mythical god or some far out in the universe [music] and can't reach him, but he's here and he's promised [music] that where two or three are gathered in his name, he'll be here in in in our midst." And [music] I just believe that with all my heart. The prophet told us that God is more willing to meet our need [music] than you are to receive it. And uh so if you're desperate and you're really hungering to have your need met, just [music] imagine God is more willing. God is more willing and more anxious. And Amen. And I just believe that these [music] this meeting has been ordained of God. And I am looking forward to a wonderful time in the [music] Lord. Amen. And I'd like to just welcome uh all of the visitors. [music] Amen. And uh good to have brother Jonathan. Amen. And brother Andrew, ministers of the gospel. [music] And uh preaching this message. And I uh appreciate them very much. And just [music] all the um uh all of you who have [music] come and the locals as well. And we just love the Lord. How many's looking forward to a great [music] time? Amen. I certainly am. And um we know that um [music] uh how it works. The prophet told us it's not the minister. [music] The minister's got a job to [snorts] do and that's get himself out of the way. God's put a [music] a gift in in him and has ordained him for such a time as this. But he's also ordained us. [music] Amen. For such a time as this. And he's placed a faith within us. Amen. To [music] where we can pull on that word. Amen. And when we pull on the word, God begins to operate through the man of God and he begins [music] to speak to our hearts. Amen. And um so uh we're just really honored to have brother Wayne uh here. It's been a [music] little while since he's been here and uh uh but we really uh glad that he's um uh come our way and we just want [music] him to take his time and uh whatever the Lord has laid on his heart to preach it. Amen. And we're um we're message believers. He's [music] a message preacher. Amen. And uh so we ought to just have a wonderful time cuz the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message [music] always. Amen. And I believe the angel of the Lord to be here with us. Amen. So, let's just sing as we invite Brother Wayne to come. [music] Amen. Uh let let's just sing uh Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only [singing] believe.

Right here in the middle of December and Amen's just around the [music] corner. It's a real good time to have a meeting. Amen. And remember the good things of God and his blessings upon [music] us. It's always an honor to be with brother Sean and the tabernacle here. And we certainly thank you [music] for the invitation. and uh we've been uh we've been a little busy pastoring and uh so we haven't [music] been traveling quite like we had been in the past, but it's always a blessing to come and and to fellowship with you all and trust the Holy Spirit would take something and and bring it from the word [music] tonight to bless you and uh amen to do something in your heart to lift it and to bring faith and and give grace. And I know certainly that [music] amen that his children he he cares for very much, Lord. And uh so we just ask [music] him to bless you tonight. And amen. If you would tonight, maybe just bow your [music] hearts with us. If we'd just like to approach him in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight. We thank you for the grace that you have shown us to be here today. We [music] thank you, Lord, for the great angel that that accompanies your word. And we [music] ask you tonight, Lord, as we invite you to the platform to take a hold of your word, we're asking [music] that you would use this word tonight, Lord, to bless your children, Father, that you would bless them that hear these things. That Lord, that you may bring the revelation and the spirit [music] of wisdom among us, Lord, that Father, our understanding could be open, Lord, and and faith could soar into our hearts to [music] see the grace of God as it unfolds. And Lord Jesus, we invite you [music] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. [music] And God bless you tonight. If you have your Bibles, we'd like to go into the word of the Lord. Amen. I certainly want to appreciate the men of God that traveled down with me today and uh say God bless them and thank them for their for their fellowship and and to be here tonight. Amen. I know they're very busy and so for them to take time to be here, it's a real honor to have them. And Amen. always a great blessing of course to come see our buddy, Brother Shawn. We been buddies a long time and a man been up and down the road and back together. And Amen. I always I can always we we met a lot earlier, but I can always remember when brother Sean went on the road with me first is when Anne was a baby. So, anytime you see Ann walking, you that's that's the age of our friendship with brother uh brother Sean on the road actually uh traveling with us and and we had a we had a wonderful year that year. First year he went out. I I don't know. He went out and I don't think he come home for a month or something. And Amen. God was using him in such a way and blessing the people by the gift. And Amen. We certainly uh appreciate brother Shawn a real a real minister of this word and real powerful preacher. And amen, we're uh we certainly know that you're well taught here and a tremendous balance preached from the scriptures. And amen, we just pray that the blessing of Abraham would rest upon you tonight as we approach him. And I've been in a little bit of study back home on the book of Hebrews. And uh you know when you get to studying on something, it it kind of sticks out in your heart. And I want to read from the book of Hebrews tonight, the seventh chapter. And I'm going to read about 10 verses here. Um this is a beautiful uh text, something that that I really personally enjoy uh this scripture and and the thing that uh that Paul was bringing close to our hearts here. And then brother Brandham of course picks us up. Um in Hebrews 7 and verse one uh for this Melchazdc the king of Salem and the priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. Now he's quoting from Genesis the 14th chapter. And to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation the king of righteousness. Brother Bram said, "Of course, that's King God." And after that also the king of Salem, which is the king of peace. Brother Bram said, "The king of Jerusalem, Salem, Jerusalem," he said, "which was King Theophony, without father, without mother, without dissent, having neither beginning of days, nor the end of life, but made like unto the Son of God." Now notice that he was made like unto the son of God abideth a priest continually. Now consider how [clears throat] great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of his spools. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham. But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises, and without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the better. And here men that die receive tithes. But there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. And as I may say, Levi also who received tithes paid tithe in Abraham. For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melazdc met him. May God bless the reading of his word tonight. As you could be seated, if I would uh take a title tonight, I'd like to speak to you the next little bit. I want to talk to you about a the effect of revelation of Melazdc. The effect of revelation of Melazdc. Uh this this man Melazedc, if you are familiar with the message of the hour, uh this is a very um a very familiar name. We you hear it talked about a lot. Uh, and it's it's beautiful because actually it's only spoken of a few times in the Bible. And if you're an Old Testament reader, you know, uh, that there's only two of the Old Testament uh, uh, writers that wrote of him. And of course, Abraham met him uh, in Genesis the 14th chapter. And then David speaks of him in the book of Psalms. Uh, and now both of those men, both Abraham and David, when Jesus was born, they attributed that he was the son of both David and Abraham. So, it's pretty amazing that the two that spoke of him had the attributed that he was their son. And so, uh, as Paul would pick those things up and then place them in the scriptures, uh, we still know that Mazdc, uh, the who he was and what he represented laid a great mystery and a great secret. And, uh, brother Brandon will tell us something as he himself preaches out of this scripture in the book of Hebrews. He preaches a couple parts. Hebrews chapter 7. And then again, he'll preach another sermon, Melchazdc, the grace pre great priest and king. And then I I think the capstone of those sermons as he preaches, who is this Melazdc? Amen. To answer that. And in the front of that book, he says, I I would like you to think about how great this person is. Amen. Uh how great this man must be. And and and brother Brown was specific saying this, how great the person. And then he says the man uh because you can't forget that what Abraham met was a man. And and so he was a person. He was yet a man. And he says now who who is this man? And brother Madam says theologians has had ideas but since the opening of the seals the mysterious book that's been mysterious according to Revelations 10 1-7. All the mysteries that's wrote in this book that's been hid down through the age of the reformers is supposed to be brought into view by the angel of the last church age. Now how many knows that's right? &gt;&gt; That's right. It's supposed to be brought out and all the mysteries of this mysterious book is to be revealed to the layout of messenger of that age. And seeing there is much dispute about the person and this subject I think it behooves us to break into it and find out who it is. Now, I've always the first time I ever read that quote, it was amazing. Brother Terry, to me that brother Bram first of all draws out there's a question about it because some thinks it's a priesthood and some thinks it was a man and some thinks it was a myth and and brother Bram says but because there is a question about it because there is a question concerning the subject. He said, "Then the seventh angel is going to solve the subject." And he said, "So it behooves me that I would speak on it." And I said, "Well, what he did is he's not only telling you who Melkazedc was, he was telling you who he was." Amen. That it was his job to do it. Amen. That that if there is if there is an idea tonight of who Melkazedcict is, that answer would be coming from the seventh angel. He has supreme subject or authority upon who that is. Amen. And who this person is. Well, now, first of all, we realize that it is a person. Amen. And it's not just a myth because we realize uh the scripture says consider how great this man is. Amen. So Paul called him a man. Amen. But when when Abraham spoke to him, Abraham called him Lord. So he was both God and he was a man. Right? And brother Bam says he was a person. And whoever the person is, he's eternal. He said because watch he said he had no mother or no father. He never had a time he began and he never had a time he ended. So whoever the person is, he is eternal. Amen. And brother Bram said, "And whoever that person is, he's still alive tonight." Amen. So that eternal person, Amen, it has to be eternal person, and there's only one eternal person, and that's God. &gt;&gt; I like that. Don't you? Brother Ram said, "Then the thing that I contend, in other words, my argument on the case he says is that it was God." Because there's only one person that can be immortal. Amen. It was God. And God was changing himself into a person. That's right. No father, no mother, no beginning of days and no ending of life. Amen. He said, "There it is." Do you see? When you're reaching out into that scriptures, many time people try to teach on the three personalities of the Godhead. But you can't have a personality without being a person. It takes a person to be a personality, right? So they're just one God and it's just one person. And in 1 Timothy 6, Paul, the same writer of Hebrews 7 says, "Which in times he shall show who is the blessed and only potent, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, who only hath immortality, dwelling in light, which no man can approach, whom no man can see nor have seen, to whom honor and power everlasting." So the the idea of God being one person in this world we're living in, of course, Amen. There's so much confusion upon God. It's a world of atheism and agnostics where where everybody don't know. You know, it's a lot of times you'll meet people and you'll say, "Well, what do you believe?" And they'll say, "Well, I'm agnostic." Now, what they're really saying is that they just don't know. They can't be an atheist because they really know there's something out there. Amen. And they can't be a believer because they can't put a name on it. But so therefore, they're they don't know then. And that's exactly what Paul was talking about when he went into the city. I believe it was there in Mars. And he said he found, amen, a a a a altar that was to the unknown gods. You know, they had all these altars lying down the street and this altar is to this one and this one's to this one. And then they had one altar to the unknown god. Well, that's the god that brother Brandham come to reveal was the unknown god. The one that created the heavens and the earth. But but to speak about that god, you're going to have to have revelation. Now, now revelation it it means to uncover something. When you're looking at brother Brandham and he said Melazdc he says was to come into view. The revelation by by the seventh angel was to bring these things into view. And what revelation means it means an unveiling or something that was previously hidden is going to be brought into view. Amen. In other words, the thing that has been covered up is going to get uncovered. And William Brandom didn't come to cover up God. He come to uncover him. Amen. The uncovering was for the purpose of manifestation and it would take a revelation. Brother Bam said that Greek word revelation means apocalypse or in other words it's the unveiling or the uncovering of something like a like a a person that's been working on on something. Brother Bam uses it a a painter or sculpture been working on a statue and he's working underneath a cover but when he gets it completely finished and he takes the cover and you can see what the work has been all the way through. You know, if he took the cover off and it was just a big rock with feet, you wouldn't know what it was talking about. If he took the cover off and it was just a an emblem with no face or with no hair, you wouldn't know who the person was. But once it is complete, then you can take the veil off of it and say, "This has been the work of God the whole time." So the seventh angel comes for the purpose of uncovering or taking the veil off of that which was previously been hidden. It's a revelation. Now you can look at the book of revelations itself and understand it takes something or requires something to read the book of revelations because it's in symbology. So it's going to take someone to unveil it because it's been hidden from the natural reader. It's hid from intellectual minds. And so it's going to take it. But we don't only mean the book of revelations. But brother Random says revelation is tremendously important. And not only the book, he said, but I'm talking about all revelation. All revelation is supremely important. And brother Brandham had so much to say about it. He says, "Matter of fact, you cannot even overemphasize the need of revelation." Do you know that there's only one way to know God, and that's by revelation? Do you know God has a way to bring revelation, AND IT'S BY a prophet? Amen. And people say, "Well, Brother Wayne, I can't get this Godhead figured out, and we can't get it, and you know, we got to study the Greek, and we got to get the Hebrew, and we got to get it all straight." Listen. Amen. There's a lot of people a lot smarter than we are. And there's a lot of people with a lot better educations than we have and they still can't get it straight. So, it's going to take A REVELATION FROM GOD to straighten it out or it won't never get straightened out. Amen. I I love him for it. Don't you? Brother Bam said there was a fella come to him and he calls the name of the church. He said a Baptist man called him up. Brother Brham was a Baptist and and this Baptist fell called him up and he said, "Hey, Brother Brandham," he said, "Uh, he said, "I heard you talking about the Godhead. I need to come up and straighten you up on it." And he said, "When you got time," Brother Brandham said, "Well, for that I got time right now." &gt;&gt; And that fell went up there and he said he got to talking to him and he said, "I just can't see how you can say there's just one God." And brother Brandham said, "Well," he said, "You got to let all your thinking go and just believe the word of God." And and the fell said, "Well, yeah." He said, "But even the greatest theologians can't figure that out." And brother Brandham says, "Because it comes by revelation." Amen. you you will never get a group of men to to to be able to teach this in a way that you can understand it. But it'll take the revelation for the Bible says a man can't call Jesus the Lord without the Holy Ghost. It would take the Holy Ghost to unveil the revelation of the Godhead to an individual. And of course that Baptist man said to brother Bram, he said, "I can't accept revelation." And brother Bam said, "Then there's no way for God to deal with you. then you've cut yourself off from God if you can't receive revelation. Now that's that's the the age that we're living in. Now you've got to realize that we are living in the age of revelation. Amen. This the age that we are living in now is the age of revelation. This is the unveiling of God. This is the ministry of the age was to unveil the God that had been hid through the ages but is to be unveiled in the LAST DAY. AND THAT unveiling would bring a faith, a divine faith within the church FOR THE CHANGE OF ITS BODY. AND WITHOUT REVELATION, WE AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. Without revelation, we ain't changing nothing. But with revelation, we have the ability, amen, to change in the moment, in the twinkle of AN EYE. BECAUSE EVERYTHING FROM THE NEW BIRTH TO THE CHANGE OF OUR BODY COMES through revelation. My goodness. Yes, sir. I believe that revelation is supremely important to every believer. And there is no other way to know God only by revelation. Amen. There is only one God manifested in the flesh. And that ought to settle it cuz God comes in a human form. Amen. They didn't they didn't make him another God. He was God. The same God. And it's a revelation then of how God can be one. &gt;&gt; Now, somebody said, "Well, brother Wayne, amen. Back in those days, it was in the days of Paul. It was a revelation." Amen. And in our day, it's a revelation. And it will require revelation. Now, brother Brandon then says to us, we don't need a new Bible. We need revelation. You see what he was telling the the world that you don't need a new transcript. You don't need a Greek revelation. What you need is a prophet to come among you and to give the revelation. Amen. That would gather the bride and bring them rapture in faith. Well, I think we can announce it tonight. Amen. I think that we can say that that's not as something that's coming. Amen. I believe this day this scripture has been fulfilled and we have received of God in this generation. Amen. God sent it and we believe it and become a part of it by the grace of almighty God. Now this this idea of Melazdc, how many knows it's an end time revelation? &gt;&gt; So whatever you read about Melazdc up to the ministry of brother Brandham, Amen. I I hate to tell you but it's a lot of guessing. That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's men guessing and poking in the dark of what they think it was. But according to the scripture, it would be revealed in the last day. Now, I say the scripture because in the book of Hebrews the 5th chapter when Paul is talking about Melkazedc and he says in the 11th verse of whom many I have many things to say, but being there hard to utter because you're dual of hearing. Now watch what he says. For when the time you ought to be teachers, you have need of one teach you again, the first principles of the oracles of God, Amen, become such as we have need of milk and not of strong meat. For everyone that useth the milk is unskillful, and the word of unrighteousness, for he has obeyed. But strong meat belongth to them that are of full age, even those by reason have their So strong meat belongth to full age. Now Paul is not trying to belittle the Hebrews. He's just saying that you're not ready to receive the revelation of what I got to say ABOUT MELAZDC. YOU'RE YOU'RE not going to be able to receive it in this age. Now, according to Paul in the same writer in Ephesians the 4th chapter, he also says that we would come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God and to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. So he is pointing to a future work of God in the church which brother Brandham pulled out in the stature of the perfect man and builds it up through the rainbow colors. Now now folks this whole Bible times time that just ties together because he builds it up through the rainbow colors right and then caps it off in the ledian age and brings down divine love which is the ministry of Jesus himself. NOW PAUL SPEAKING in Hebrews 5 says it's coming. In Hebrews 6, he introduces two seeds and lets you know that either you're the seed of God or you're seed of the devil. Come on, church. And when he gets done saying that, he gets very clear. And then he says, "But then God, Amen, made Abraham a promise." And when he did, HE SWORE BY HIMSELF. NOW, WHEN HE SWORE by himself, what's he talking about? HE DIDN'T SWEAR JUST BY any mask. HE DIDN'T SWEAR JUST BY ANY DISPENSATION. BUT THE GOD WHO ALWAYS WAS MADE A PROMISE UNTO ABRAHAM. AMEN. Now that God came in different forms and even appeared to Noah in colors. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Those same colors he appeared to Noah in in a promise is God put himself in the heavens and made a promise by himself to Noah. And that same God appears in Revelations the 10th chapter IN THE FIRST VERSE. THE MIGHTY ANGEL COMING OUT OF HEAVEN. AMEN. COMES WITH A rainbow about his head. And the same God THAT WAS TALKING TO PAUL IN HEBREWS 5 AND IN HEBREWS 6 OPENS UP HEBREWS 7, BUT IT'S NOT UNTIL REVELATIONS 10 THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IT ALL TIES TOGETHER. MY, we got a message, folks, that don't do away WITH THE BIBLE. IT TIES THE ENTIRE BIBLE TOGETHER. WE HAVE RECEIVED OF GOD IN THIS AGE THE REVELATION that's been promised to this dispensation. Amen. It's here we find out this seventh age, the whole story is going to be told for the first time. Amen. We've had a part. We've had people that told parts and and now you you're talking to a preacher tonight. Amen. That one of the great things that I believe is William Brandham preached what Paul preached. But Paul didn't preach all of what brother Brandham taught in the fullness of the revelation. &gt;&gt; You get what I'm saying? Paul said, "The Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout, voice, and trump." made it sound like it was one, didn't it? Brother Ram took it and expanded and showed you shout voice trump was three different things that come throughout the process of time. He preached what Paul preached, but he brought the clarity that Paul said would come in THE LAST DAYS. NOW, WHY DIDN'T it come in Paul's day? Why didn't it come in Luther's day? Because you wasn't here then. AND THERE WAS NOBODY ON THE EARTH THAT COULD COMPREHEND THE REVELATION THAT WAS GOING TO BE COMING. IT WOULD TAKE AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD, AMEN, TO TO UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT GOD WAS going to bring in this age. Now, you're not intellectually going to understand all this. You know that. &gt;&gt; And intellectually, you might not remember all this, but there's something in you knows is right. &gt;&gt; There's something in you knows is right. When you hear it preached, something in you said, "Amen to the word of God." What is it? It's revelation. This whole thing has come together and God sent a prophet to unveil it. &gt;&gt; Now, I've often said it like this. You You take a You take a a book and Amen. And brother Brother Jonathan, you got a Bible? Hold your Bible up right there. Amen. Now, watch. Amen. This is a veiled work, right? This is a prophet. He unveiled that Bible. But what happened is when he unveiled the word, then a veil come over the person looking at the open word. So now the whole congregation sees an open book and one man can't see it. And the man that can't see it is trying to stop the men that can see it. AMEN. BUT IT'S STILL A REVEALED WORK. IT'S NOT HERE TONIGHT. WE'RE NOT HERE GUESSING AND AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS thing means. We have HAD A PROPHET AMONG US. THERE'S A DIVINE REVELATION THAT HAS DROPPED INTO THIS AGE TO GIVE MEN AN ABSOLUTE THAT WE know what WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE STANDING. WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. The veil has been taken off. &gt;&gt; And I have refused. And you have refused. The veil of tradition that would recover the thing God unveiled. &gt;&gt; Prophet said it means this. And somebody comes along and says, "It don't mean that." He put a veil on you if you don't refuse it. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; And I'm not wearing any of the veils. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want no denominational veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. The pillar of fire has literally come among us to unveil our eyes. Amen. That we might be able to see according to scriptures. Amen. That allowed to see an age. He said, I pray that you would pray that you get eyes to have that you might be able to see. Is that right? And brother said it's going to take more than congre in this age. Amen. We're going to have to HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, THE FIRE OF GOD. Come on, friends. And brother man said he's going to have to come into the heart to heal your blindness because there's a door in your heart that would keep you from seeing. Your faith will keep you from seeing what is. But if the Holy Ghost gets in that door, it'll open the faith side and you'll be able to see exactly what God was spoken up in this age. We're not waiting for a prophet to speak it. It's been spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what it is? He has come here to change hearts, to unveil God. Amen. Now, if he's unveiling him, what is he unveiling him as? Amen. He was unveiled as Jesus in that day, but he is unveiled as the bride in this day. As Jesus was the Old Testament fulfillment of the promises, this bride is the fulfillment of the New Testament promises. She is a living, walking, written epistle of almighty God. Not two tables of stone. Amen. with the fleshly tables of heart written by the pillar of fire in this age to manifest all that God has given. We don't have any excuses tonight friends. We have received the divine will of God that we might walk into them in this age. Now I find out that God is changing mask. That's the promise and that's the thing he is doing. Now, if you how many how many you ever played in a film or not a film, but in a in a in a play or some little Christmas thing or some little fil uh little little thing you have and and you know, when I was in high school, I played I played in a in a high school uh play and and I played two different guys, you know, I don't know how I got away with that, but I did it anyhow, but I played two different guys, but I was the same person in both acts. Now, now when you when you start making a an act, let's just say that you're going to play uh you're going to play a certain person, then you have to study the character, you have to study the role, you have to study what they do, and then you step into that and you become somebody you're not because you're acting out something. But in the case of this word I'm talking about, you're not acting out somebody else's role. Amen. You're now putting on who you originally were to begin with, but it was not revealed to this day. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now God does not move from person to person. He moves from mask to mask. &gt;&gt; God does not change from personality to personality. That's not the way God changes. God changes the mask, but not the person. He changes the mask, but not the attitude. He changes the mask, but he does not change who he is. And if he was something in another day, amen. The principal theme of this Bible is he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Y'all know that's the way brother Bam picked the church age messengers, right? Because he's the same yesterday and forever. So he could go through the ages and pick the messengers that didn't change the personality of God. Do you see? There it is. And God promised in this day in this layout as soon church he would take the the the the mask off of the whole thing. &gt;&gt; It would be that we would see it God immorate in a man called Jesus. God immorate in his church. God above us. God with us. God in us. It's the condescending God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what he's doing is it was God who was above us. It was God who was with us. Now it's God that is in us. It's the Holy Spirit. Now notice those of you that have eternal life was with him and in his thinking before there was an angel, a star, a cherubam, or anything else. I I tell you what, you could just stop and preach a month right there. &gt;&gt; Before there was an angel, well, the devil is an angel, isn't he? He's a fallen angel. But before he was fallen, he was a created angel. He was a cherub in heaven. Amen. And God created you. He was in his mind before that devil was ever created. And when the devil ain't no more, will still be in the presence of God. Because that which is eternal, if you have eternal life, you always was. &gt;&gt; Now, not your being here, but the shape and the form of the infinite God. Now, who has eternal life in here tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that beautiful? Your eternal life don't begin in heaven, but eternal life begins in the new birth. That that gene that's in you born again, there is that eternal life. And brother Bam says, "Now watch." He says, "Now we find him at the beginning, his attributes, and now you were with him then. Then is when the book of life comes into view." &gt;&gt; Amen. And we read over in Revelation 13 and8 that of course is the lamb's book of life. And brother Bam said, "Now think of this. Before Jesus was born, 4,000 years before he came on the earth, that Jesus in God's mind died for you." &gt;&gt; And the book of life was made and your name was on the book of life before the foundation of the world. That's the Bible truth. Your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world. You were there in his attributes. Amen. Now, I don't want to put on a class, but can you say it with me? Attributes. Amen. I don't know if I pronounce it right, but you know what I mean. Amen. You were there in his attributes. You don't remember it because you're a part of his life. &gt;&gt; See, you're a part of God when you become a son or daughter of God. Now, notice you were there in his attributes and you don't remember it. Now, I've used this a few times throughout the years cuz I don't know a better way to say it. Amen. Is that there's things that are true you don't remember. You you can agree to that. Amen. And if you know your birthday, then you're you're admitting that you tell things for truth that you don't personally remember. You don't remember being born. You don't remember the day. You don't remember what it's like. Your mama remembers all that. And your mama uh uh speaks of it, but she writes it down. and and they they talk about the first steps you made and all those things and you'll tell it like you were there like you have memory of being there but you really don't but you're adopting the memory of your mother as your own memory. Amen. And the prophet is telling you you were actually there. You don't remember it. But I have been sent from God to give you a memory of where you was before you was here. Thank God we can trust that that prophet knew more than just an educated man or an intellectual man. It's a pre-incarnate knowledge of where we was AND A VINDICATED VOICE IS SAYING YOU WERE THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Then you're adopting the word for your memory. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how you remember the future. Amen. You adopt the word for your memory. Now if if you if you watch the scriptures this Mazdc now who he is is going to appear in this revelation. Now this one revelation of Melkazdc is going to fit over your life in a lot of ways but this Mazdc revelation. Now let's break into it in John chapter 1. Amen. Let's pull up the first verse. For in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Now you you watch this. John begins the Bible begins his verses by saying in the beginning was the word. Brother Brandham goes to this scripture. He said what was before the beginning then? &gt;&gt; He now you got to answer that before you can answer who Melazdc is. He said what was it before the beginning? He said do you see when you worship God the English word God means an object of worship. So maybe it could be a piano. Maybe it could be your husband, your job, because it just means an object of worship. Amen. But our God is known as Elohim, which is self-existent, right? Amen. So the God we're talking about is a self-existent one. In other words, he existed before there was anything. Before there was a beginning, before there was a word, there was Elohim. And before the beginning, there was Elohim. And in Elohim was attributes. And in those attributes, you were right there IN THAT ATTRIBUTE. THE SAME AS JESUS CHRIST WAS in the attribute. You were in the attribute. Amen. Who you are, what you were going to be, everything about you was in God before the first word was ever spoken. You were already in the life source of almighty God. Woo. Glory to God. Think about tonight. In the beginning was the word. So number one was the attribute stage of God. Jesus himself the our savior Jesus was in the attribute of God. Now the second part of that says in the beginning was the word. Now the word is where God began to go toward mankind. The word brother in questions and answers on Genesis says there it was. He said that little halo of light come out of God and begin to soar around. He said there it was in the beginning was the word. Let there be light. Amen. Now, we know that's not the sun, the moon. They're created a little later, but this is the existence of God moving toward humanity in the form of the pillar of fire. Amen. Now, God hadn't changed any, but he started to become a have a mass that you could see the visible presence, but it was just a mass that the same God that was in the attribute was hiding behind that fire. Are you with me? HE WAS HIDING behind that fire, and he was known as the word. Now we could we could say in the beginning was the theophony and the theophony was go of God and the theophony was God because brother Bam said watch in the beginning was the word. That was the second stage God took toward man. It's called the word. It's a theophonic form of God. This is the form he appeared in when he talked to Moses at the rock. This is the form he was in when he was the burning bush. Amen. That Moses met on the mountain. This is the form he was in when he met Abraham. Every time he met him, when Noah met him, when Job met him, when he saw the wilder, that God appeared throughout the Old Testament in a theophonic form. But in the 14th verse, John said, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. But then the word BECAME FLESH, AND GOD begot his own son, Jesus Christ." Now, friends, I'll tell you what a powerful reality. Three things. Three things, brother Josiah. Attribute, word, flesh. Attribute, word, flesh. You can teach the entire mystery of Melchazdc from John. Attribute, word, flesh. Now, well, you say, "BROTHER WAYNE, WHY is it important?" Because you need to realize there is a difference between you and Jesus Christ. Jesus went from attribute to the word to the flesh. You bypassed the word and went from the attribute to the flesh. Amen. So if you're going to know what you're missing is you're missing the word. Come on church. Then music ain't going TO PUT US BACK. Intellectuals ain't going TO PUT US BACK. JUST PRAISE AND WORSHIP AIN'T GOING TO PUT US BACK. BATH AND LUTHERAN AND METHODIST message are not going TO PUT US BACK. IT'LL take the word. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE MISS THE WORD. SO WE MISS the word. WE GOT TO GO BACK BY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Now now you see then the attribute Amen. itself is being expressed and then secondarily he became the word and then the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; And that's why that's why when Paul says he was like unto the son of God because it was the word created a body of flesh &gt;&gt; and talked to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But it wasn't a begotten body. &gt;&gt; It was a created body. It had not come through the womb of a woman in a fallen state. Amen. It He was only a borrowed vessel, a created body. I hope you're hearing me. Amen. Because that is exactly what Jesus pointed at when he pointed at the sign of the Messiah. First, he was spirit God. Second, see, he began to be a theophony and then he became flesh. He met he met Abraham in the form of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way he met him. And see tonight. Amen. Then before the word was attribute, that's where you were. &gt;&gt; That's where you were. People say, "Well, I was a part of God." Do you see? Then you you wasn't just like a human walking around in heaven. You were a part of the attribute of God in his life, in his thinking. Amen. And watch what he says. Now, we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form. That's right. Not into the theophony. They bypassed that. Right. Amen. Now, the difference between you and him as a son. He at the beginning was the word, an immortal body. And you, he came and lived in the person of Mazdc. Now, later you don't hear about mezazedc because he comes Jesus Christ, right? Amen. See, but you bypass that. &gt;&gt; You bypass that with this natural birth. Now, I think it's powerful. Amen. Because it means if I bypassed it then I must have one. &gt;&gt; If I bypassed it then there must be something for me. Amen. But you see you bypassed it. Amen. And come into this earth. Amen. In a fallen condition of your birth. Now there is where all of your problems started. Listen you would have never had the first problem had you went from attribute to word and then to flesh. But because you bypassed the word you got all of these issues. Wasn't born in Eden. is born in Leodysa and you were born through all kinds of of of trouble. Amen. And matter of fact, the attribute that's born is so much God, but the body itself ain't. &gt;&gt; The human body it's born into. Matter of fact, many people are trying to disqualify people from the rapture because of the way their human body come in the earth. Amen. A an attribute son could be born in a fallen condition, but there is no condition you could be born into that God couldn't redeem you from. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know there's a question they asked brother Bham about illegitimate children. And brother Bam said, "I see how they could be uh uh how they could be uh uh saved but not in the rapture." Amen. And and he says this and then they go to brother Bandom, Sister Dalton, Brother Jim Dalton's mother, and asked Brother Bandom about that because she had some illegitimacy in their family. maybe her dad or somebody. And she asked Brother Bam directly about that question. And Brother Bam sat down and pinned an answer and said, "Sister Dalton, I want you to know that by Adam's fall, we are all illegitimate children, &gt;&gt; but through the second birth, we are made legitimate sons by JESUS CHRIST." LISTEN FRIENDS, WE ALL WAS BORN INTO A FLESH THAT WAS FALLEN. AND THIS FLESH IS A FAILURE. BUT THERE IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD ON THE INSIDE OF THAT FLESH. AND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR CAME AFTER THAT ATTRIBUTE. He didn't come after your genetics. He didn't come after AMEN YOUR CHILD BIRTH AND YOUR CHILD NAME AND AND the school you went to or the home you're born into. He come after the gene OF GOD THAT'S LAID DOWN INSIDE OF YOU. THANK GOD THERE'S AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD on the inside of believers today. Amen. That means that you are redeemable. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, a beautiful thing. Brother Bam said he came to be a redeemer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He came to be a redeemer. &gt;&gt; And what does redeemer means? He says it means to bring back. &gt;&gt; Now, what was what was wrong with that priest when Jesus met him and he couldn't take him back cuz he didn't come from there. And Jesus was exactly the word. But finally Jesus said, "You don't receive me cuz I you got no place in you for me. My my word don't have no place. You didn't bypass the word because you wasn't there to start with." But had you bypassed the word, then my ministry would redeem you back to what you were. Now I I think it's powerful because that man had never been in the thinking of God or the word could have took it back to the thinking of God. That's why the woman at the well could easily believe when the Pharisee couldn't believe. She was in a worse moral state, but she was in a better spiritual state because she had something to represent her in the presence of almighty God. She had been in the thinking of God. Woo! Glory to God. Brother Bam said in the third seal that light struck that seed that had been laying there that was spoke by God. That seed in you, Amen, lays there that God himself placed in you. That seed was on earth and when God moved the water away, the sun hits it and it comes right up. Brother talking about the questions and answers in Genesis and he said there were seeds laying beneath the waters that was on the earth. Earth was out form and void and darkness would cover the earth. Now look at the condition folks. Darkness covered the face of the deep. The earth was without form or void and waters was just covering the thing. But there was a seed under there. There was a seed under there. And when God began to shine light, it struck a seed. And a seed produced life. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW DARK THE WATERS. IT DOESN'T MATTER THE GENE POOL THAT YOU WERE BORN INTO. COME ON, LILY. IT DON'T MATTER THE POND YOU WERE BIRTHED IN. BUT WHEN THE LIGHT STRIKES THE SEED, THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S GOING TO RESPOND BECAUSE YOU GOT SOMETHING TO RESPOND WITH. I tell you tonight, if you can amen THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, YOU OUGHT TO JUST THANK GOD THAT THERE'S A BLESSING in your life that you can LOVE THIS MESSAGE. I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU GOT A GOOD CAR OR A GOOD HOUSE. THERE'S A SEED ON THE INSIDE THAT CAN AMEN THE WORD OF GOD, BROTHER. WHEN THE CARS ARE GONE AND WHEN THE HOUSES ARE GONE AND WHEN THE WORLD HAS FELL APART, WE'LL SET INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE LIVING GOD. BECAUSE WE CAME FROM GOD, WE CAN GO BACK [screaming] TO GOD. HEY, IT'S GOD redeeming what belongs to him. [applause] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the Holy Spirit will take that and dry that water and quicken that seed. He'll penetrate. &gt;&gt; Hey, I I you you you bring me the condition. And I'll show you scriptural answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I can't because ain't nobody worshshiping that woman that well. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And how many times did brother Brown use that as an example &gt;&gt; to show you it wasn't the condition. It wasn't the education. It wasn't the religion, it wasn't the moral setting, it was the seed and the sign. THE LIGHT STRUCK THE SEED AND SATAN. Hold it no more, &gt;&gt; brother. I tell you. Amen. I know what I'm talking about. That's the way he brought fishermen and woodsman and farmers and tax collectors and harlots. They seen what the scripture said it would do it doing it and they came to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, Brother Wayne, why is it that they did it so easy and others find it so hard? I I'll answer it with Peter. Brother Bam says, he said to him, "Your name is Simon and your father's name was Jonas." He said, "That deflated that fisherman." He said, "That little eternal life seed struck." &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; That little eternal life seed might have been the smallest thing about you. It might be invisible to the naked eye, but the moment the light strikes it, you'll know it's there because it'll begin to awaken changes on the inside. See, you you you didn't know about it, &gt;&gt; but that that the message is touching &gt;&gt; came from God before angels and cherabs and the world. &gt;&gt; It is eternal &gt;&gt; and it's laying inside you. &gt;&gt; And the message come to discover where is that? &gt;&gt; Where is that hidden in human beings? He wasn't looking at conditions. He was searching for the seed. Now, Brother Ram says that you're sons and daughters of God before sun, star, moon, anything. You're only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in God at the beginning. Only one form of eternal life, and that was you. &gt;&gt; You don't know nothing about it. And there it is again. You didn't know when you was in your earthly father, but you are manifested in his image. &gt;&gt; There it is. See, and therefore, as sure as your a gene had to be in your father before your natural birth, your spiritual gene had to be in God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You I I did some study on this the other day on this word gene. And and up till the mid-40s, it was just a name, brother. It was some It was some brother's name, Jean. Amen. But in the mid 40s, there was a lot of discoveries in the DNA world. And they begin to dis discover the traits and the existence of DNA and they started naming it gene. And brother Brandon starts using this word other than a name. He starts using it in the late 60s. Now, now it's it's it don't make much sense until you really realize the the implications that he's placing this is he's saying that God had a gene in him the same as your father has a gene in you. Amen. Now, now what that means is hey man that now now there there's a lot of discoveries and I won't preach all this but I I'm just going to place this in here that a gene basically is what covers carries the traits like if you're going to be tall you're going to be skinny you're going to be beh have hair not have hair uh I if you're going to have brown eyes black eyes if you're going to be a human all that's in a trait like that's the trait of your father you somebody said well I've seen you laugh and you look like your dad that trait come through a gene Okay, you call it a gene, but a gene is only is only a section of DNA, Amen, that's wrapped in the chromosomes of your life. Now, every molecule in your body, Amen, has molecules are real small, aren't they? Inside the inside of your molecule is something called a nucleus. And inside of the nucleus is a DNA. A collection of those DNAs are called genes, which carry the traits. They're wrapped in chromosomes which you have 23 from your mama and 23 from your daddy. So those chromosomes are laying there. If you took the DNA and you unstrung it off of those chromosomes, they say you could take it and stretch it to the sun and back 60 times. That's how many that's that's how long the DNA is in your life. That records the traits of your life. So what you what's that mean? It means when you eat a bite of food that your food don't say what you are, your genes says what you are. So your genetics, your DNA actually actually copies the food that comes in your body and takes the 23 amino I think it's 23 amino acids. Nine of them are essential. Amen. They actually come from things you take in. And when you take in that food, your DNA says this amino acid goes with this amino acid. this goes this many and puts it together and it forms a tissue which forms organs which forms follicules of hair and eyes and so every bit of that is controlled by what's inside you and it tells the food what to build in you now now now listen folks I'm saying that because I could eat all the food I want to eat and I'll never be as tall as Josiah look a dog could eat a steak every night right beside you and it'll still be a dog when it gets it's done. &gt;&gt; But a dog has DNA same as you have DNA. &gt;&gt; But your DNA is a is a higher species and it has a way to develop the foods you eat. So they have now what they call gene expression. And there's certain foods you can eat that can unlock certain genetics that's in your body. And you could get healthier. You could get Amen. You can get uh maybe quicker thinking. And it has to do with the foods you're eating. But you can never add to those genes. The genes are in you through a birth through your mama and your daddy. Come on church. And God put his traits in you through a genetics of his word by an attribute and sent the message. Come on now. Somebody else can eat who's this mechazedc. Amen. And it don't change them a bit. But when you pull in who's this Melkisedc unveiling OF GOD POWER TRANSFORMATION ALL OF A SUDDEN IT STARTS UNLOCKING GENETIC EXPRESSIONS AND YOU FIND THAT YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON BECAUSE OF THE FOOD YOU'RE EATING BUT IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS A GENE in you to begin with. If you wasn't an attribute you can eat the same message but it will never touch your life. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh, the grace of God had put something in you that knows what to do with this word. YOUR INSIDES. AMEN. YOU YOU you've [laughter] never eat a sandwich and and and said to yourself, "Now you bread molecule, you get over that ham and you take a hold of the dairy, that cheese, and y'all go fix my lung. You just eat it and it happens." &gt;&gt; You just come to church and the pastor starts preaching. &gt;&gt; Now, come on. Don't you ever underestimate a good sermon. &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Bram said there's a development of a body in you. And he says, "And God will call a man to the pull pit to preach the vitamins you have need of." [laughter] &gt;&gt; And you know when you know when you're really needing something is when you got strange appetite. &gt;&gt; And that's true. Amen. And whenever the strangest of that appetite pulls for the message and that preacher starts preaching, Amen. things start happen to you. Now what the devil will do is get you on your memory. I've got more people come up to me said, "Brother Wayne, I wish I could remember all them quotes you use." Amen. But you know, listen, it's not so important that you remember it. It's real important you eat it. &gt;&gt; I say this guy said to his wife one time said, "I I'm I'm going to quit church." And they went down to the pastor's house said, "I'm going to quit church." Said, "What are you going to quit for?" He said, "I've been coming to this church 20 years." He said, "I can't tell you sermons you preached for 20 years. I barely can remember what you preached last Sunday." Said, "I don't even know what no good this doing for me." And fella kind of looked over at the man's wife. He said, "Well," he said, "Uh," he said, "Uh, is that your cook there?" And he said, "Yeah." He said, and he asked him how old he was, and he's like 50, 60 years old, however old he was. And he said, "Well," he said, he said, "Do you remember what you had for breakfast last year?" He said, "No." He said, "Remember what you had for supper?" Like, no. He said, "You remember last week?" He said, "No." He said, "See, it's not so important that you remember the food you ate, but it's real important you eat it because your life is coming from what you're eating." And listen, it's not that you can remember every scripture or you can remember every verse, but there's a gene in you that when you hear the message of the hour, IT IS DEVELOPING A CHRISTLIKE NATURE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. AND THE BAPTIST MESSAGE IS NOT BRIDE FOOD. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IT'LL TAKE THE OPENING OF THE WORD BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE. You're here. That's why you crave this message. Come on, friends. That boy sucked on that bicycle pedal because he missed something in his birth and you missed something in your birth. You'll come off the lamb's BOOK OF LIFE AND NOW YOU HAVE TURNED BACK TO THIS MESSAGE AND IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE MUD TO SOMEBODY else but to you and me it's a lifegiving source that's opening the genetics. Oh, glory to God. I'M A SON OF GOD FROM THE INSIDE OUT. BROTHER, you can't you can't tell me I'm not. I was in the loins of God &gt;&gt; before there was a speck of stardust. &gt;&gt; That was what was going on with that girl. She was existing in God's thoughts. And brother Brown said, "There it is. There's eternal life, the eternal thoughts of God." Let me ask you, are the thoughts of God eternal? &gt;&gt; If you can see that, you can see many things. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, God ain't adding to his knowledge now or ever. Was he ever? Now you say, "Preacher, why you say this?" Because the predestinate is the only thing considered redemption. &gt;&gt; If this message come for redemption and it came to you, &gt;&gt; listen, God didn't send the mail to the wrong address. &gt;&gt; God has never missed. &gt;&gt; And if that message was directed to your address, it's because something redeemable was inside there. He come right down to your address. And brother Bam would tell him, "You live on this street, your name is this." cuz he didn't want to miss the mail that God was sending to him. This message came to you because THERE WAS SOMETHING IN YOU THAT GOD WAS TRYING TO GET BACK THAT BELONGS to him. When you start realizing that word redeemed means to be brought back, then ain't nothing can keep you from it. Amen. That's why Amen. Brother Brandham stands there and talks about that little eagle and he said when mama eagle screamed, I boy, that'd be a preaching thought tonight, wouldn't it? When that mama eagle screamed, baby eagle heard it and responded because it was an eagle. &gt;&gt; Its grandpa was an eagle. Its great grandpa was an eagle. He He could have said, "Oh, thank you, Lord, for changing me from a chicken to an eagle." That would have been a false doctrine. And the next morning, he got up and couldn't fly AS HIGH AS MAMA. AND HE SAID, "OH, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M AN eagle anymore." He was eagle TO BEGIN WITH. HE'S ALWAYS EAGLE. HE WAS JUST IN THE WRONG PLACE. And your birth put you IN THE WRONG PLACE. BUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS COME TO REDEEM YOU BACK TO WHAT God has called and thought of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Talk about food. Where the carcass is there, the eagles are going to gather together. Brother Bam, what is the eagles? Believers, what's the carcass? The present word. And when you recognize this message is eagle food, &gt;&gt; you've heard from your theophony. &gt;&gt; I thank God that the theophony has a voice. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You've heard from your theophony. Well, then I'll tell you this. That means you got one. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, Samuel went there and so does every son of the faith go there when they turn from here. You've already got it. Amen. Thank God for the opening of these seals. The true revelation of Melkazedc comes in view. He was God the word. Then he became God in the flesh. Here it is. Amen. They That's him. That's the king. Amen. That's the king. That's him coming. Now watch. Now if you if you start if you start seeing the progression of revelation from attribute to word to flesh then you're seeing that you started at the same place. You just skipped a portion. &gt;&gt; You took the bypass &gt;&gt; and you ended up in a place without coming through there. It doesn't mean the attribute is not there because the attribute was passed through. Even though you were born of a natural sex birth, God still lays the gene in there for your new birth. &gt;&gt; Now, I got quotes and I know some people don't like that church age book, but it's the truth. Brother man said, "You didn't get a you didn't come to the altar and get a new birth to get the seed." He said, "You've come to the altar and had a new birth because you did have a seed." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; the seed is what gives you spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; Now, I I when I when I think about this and and and and and you as well, you know what I'm talking about. There's some people that can quote the scripture back and forth, up and down, but have no clue what it's talking about. &gt;&gt; They can quote it and they can talk about it. Amen. But they can never see they can never see the change. They can never see the expressions of God. &gt;&gt; Now what is actually happening is you're dealing with the changing of God and people can know what God was but they miss what he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They know what happened &gt;&gt; but they don't know what's happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now, Brother Brandham will will lay this out and take just a moment and and in and just just a moment we'll continue. But, Brother Brandham will take this and lay this out and he'll take this to the word proven his word, 1964. And brother Bam will pick up the story. Now, I I I titled this the effect of revelation in Mazdc. And brother Bam will pick up this story and he'll talk about, have y'all ever not Have y'all noticed? I noticed this. Have you ever noticed when brother Brandham talks about uh Melchazdc, he often talks about him being at the tent door of Abraham? &gt;&gt; There's about three or four different appearings there and he never differates. Brother Bam talks about them like they're all the same thing. &gt;&gt; Okay. When brother Brandham does this, he talks about in Genesis 18, right? So, so Abraham separates from Lot in Genesis 13. Genesis 14, he meets Melkazedc, serves communion. In Genesis 15, he gets he gets the the revelation, justification or sanctification there, and he gets the confirmation of covenant. Then in over in Genesis 17, he meets the Lord God Almighty. In Genesis 18, Elohim comes to his tent door. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham says, "But what was the effect of the revelation of &gt;&gt; Melazdc?" &gt;&gt; That when he walked up to the tent door, there was three of them. And the revelation of Melazdc caused him to look at three and say, "My Lord." &gt;&gt; Do you see? &gt;&gt; Now, watch. Revelation of Melkazedc allowed Abraham to see I I don't I don't think you're slow. I'm slowing down because I want you to catch the point. &gt;&gt; The effect of the revelation of Melazdc was when he came as Elohim to the tent door of Abraham. Abraham knew who he was. &gt;&gt; He didn't look the same. He wasn't wearing the same clothes. He was in a company of three. But Abraham knew who he was and said unto him, "My Lord." Brother Bam says, "Was his revelation right?" He says, "Watch the next verses. Go get thy wife Sarah." &gt;&gt; He said, "There it is." How do you know he was married? How did he know his her name was Sarah? How did he know the promise was the baby? And when he and when he called the promise, she laughed in her heart. And the Bible says she was in the tent behind him. And he said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" Boam said, "There's the vindication of who he was talking to." &gt;&gt; The effect of the revelation was to witness that Elohim was in A DIFFERENT BODY, BUT IT WAS THE SAME ANGEL. &gt;&gt; NOW, brother Wayne, you said, "What are you talking about?" Now, we have been promised a revelation of Melazdc. It's an end time revelation. What is the effect of the revelation of Melazdc? And why is it important to us? Because when we see the SAME ELOHIM USE THE BODY OF A SIXTH GRADE Kentucky hillbilly, WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT'S THE SAME ELOHIM THAT WAS BACK THERE IN THE BIBLE. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. William Brandon was the veil. But what WAS USING HIM WAS THE SAME ANGEL THAT WAS AT THE TENT door of Abraham. I tell you, amen. It's an effective revelation. If you catch it, then you'll see that William Brandom, Amen, wasn't the messenger after all. Amen. There was somebody else on the scene. There was somebody else among us that was an eternal ONE THAT HAD BEEN WITH ABRAHAM WAS NOW WITH THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. AND THE REVELATION OF MELAZDC HAD CAME TO FATHER ABRAHAM HAS COME TO THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. And he, oh God, the one that was at the tent door of Abraham, has come to the tent door of the bride. And he's done the same miracle to the bride that he did to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Come on. [laughter] Come on, church. Y'all know what I'm talking about. He showed that sign to Abraham and gave Abraham a message. And the next thing that happened, Abraham's body was changed. Jesus did the same sign. And Amen. They had a resurrection. Amen. And they had a change. Amen. Uh uh they had a resurrection. Amen. And they had a rapture BACK THERE. WHEN THE THIRD time this same sign comes on the earth, &gt;&gt; there's a resurrection. There's a rapture. And the body change. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The effect of the revelation was, "Let me turn my back to you and see if it ain't the same angel." &gt;&gt; That did y'all hear them pre-ervice quotes. Huh? Hey, brother Bam said, "I'll turn my back to you so you can see it's not William Brandom." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The effect of the revelation was that man was looking at the veil and calling it man. BUT LOOK BEYOND THE VEIL AND SEE THAT GOD IS IN BRIGHT FORM manifesting himself in the last days. &gt;&gt; Now that was not Jesus talking to Abraham. &gt;&gt; What's the effect of revelation? The effect of the revelation of Melkazedc itself. Brother said that wasn't Jesus talking to Abraham. Who was it? It was Elohim, the word &gt;&gt; discerning the heart of Sarah. So the world is looking for Jesus with nails guard hands &gt;&gt; to come back on the earth and manifest himself as he did as Jesus of Nazareth. They're looking for crown of thorns, nail prints. They're looking for that ministry. And brother Bam said that's not the promise. &gt;&gt; The promise is the son of man would be revealed. That was not Jesus at the tent door of Abraham. That was Melchazdc. Come on now. BUT MELAZDC BECAME JESUS. And Jesus is alive. And he's RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING. BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT HIS PHYSICAL BODY. BUT THE WORD, THE THEOPHONY OF GOD HAS COME AMONG US AS THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; Look at him stand there. Amen. Brother man, turn his back and say, "The same angel." &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now, if you had the effect of that same revelation Abraham had, which is promised to the seed, the end time revelation would let you call that God. &gt;&gt; And then, see, people get all messed up. See, right? Because the minute you do it, then they try to make Brother Brandham God. &gt;&gt; Then you have made him an antichrist. You've took the veil and made it God. &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I don't know how to Let me just say it like this. Let Let's just say there's a big curtain up here, right? And I went in and stood behind the curtain and I veiled myself from you and I'm talking to you and you're listening to me and you can hear my voice and my accent and you know me. You say, "Brother Wayne's talking to us." There would not be one moment, amen, that you would think that curtain was Wayne Lawson. &gt;&gt; The curtain's hiding Wayne Lawson. &gt;&gt; That curtain is not Wayne Lawson. William Brandon was not Jesus Christ. HE WAS HIDING THE PRESENCE OF GOD FROM THIS AGE. GOD WAS USING A MAN TO PROVE to you that he is alive. &gt;&gt; Whoever that person is, he's still alive tonight. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not there discerning Sarah's mind. Brother Bam said it was a man in human flesh. Abraham called him Elohim. See, &gt;&gt; and it was the days of Sodom. Watch close now. And so shall it be at the coming of the son of man. We're in Luke 17:30. Now, &gt;&gt; when the son of man is being revealed, not no more as a church, but the bride is called in the day when the son of man is revealed. So, we're talking about bride ministry. Now, &gt;&gt; see what to join the church to the head. &gt;&gt; To unite the marriage of the bride. &gt;&gt; What's the message for? It's to unite the bride to her head. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call will come right through this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [panting] &gt;&gt; The channel that God chose to call you is going to come right through this message. &gt;&gt; Do you see that attribute? &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you. Hey, attribute. &gt;&gt; Do you see? God is going to use the channel of a prophet to bring your missing parts. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. I'm going to unite you to to the headship of this word. Amen. And if we live long enough, if we live long enough, somebody is going to take on the theophonyy while they yet live. &gt;&gt; Come on. Everybody's going to die. Amen. The bride's going to resurrect and take on theophony and be changed. BUT THERE'S A PROMISE IN THE BIBLE THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO REMAIN ALIVE AND THE PARTS OF THAT MESSAGE is going to connect YOU TO YOUR THEOPHONY AND CHANGE IN THE MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLE OF AN EYE. THAT'S WHY NOT any message will do us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why theology ain't going TO WORK FOLKS. THAT'S WHY THE PSYCHOLOGY CAN'T BE OUR GUIDE. WE HAVE GOT TO BE TOOK BACK TO THE MIND OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU see the effect of Melazdc the revelation let you know uniting with the message is uniting with God. the really attribute and when this attribute then brother Bam said the bridegroom call comes through this and you will see the son of man come down in human flesh not virgin flesh not created flesh redeemed flesh &gt;&gt; you'll see the blood works &gt;&gt; you'll see this come together and brother Bam says see that the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together now I want you to watch I'm going to move on amen I might revisit this tomorrow but I want to move on for now but watch what he says that message is coming to marry or to put together or to make a union between the two. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's making a union between the two. It's to bring Amen. a redeemable attribute, its ability to be redeemed. Now, Brother Brandham will go in and he'll talk about the woman at the well. And he'll say, "The woman at the well, remember again, he'll say, "Now, when she got spoke to, she responded differently than the Pharisee. Now watch the difference between intellectual faith and revelation. Intellectual faith, brother Bram says, watch the Pharisee had learned because of intellectual conception. He was born in the right lineage. He was a Levite, but he only knowed it by intellectual conception. And when the light of the hour, see, he learned it by what had happened, not what was happening. &gt;&gt; There you go. So that Pharisee could say to you, look the the book of Moses says and the law says and this says and this is what happened on Sinai and this is how many days and this is the stretch of the temple and how it he could break the whole thing down. &gt;&gt; But when the word become alive, he believed the word that was written and turned down the LIVING MANIFESTATION OF THAT WORD SO HE COULD know it by what had happened, not what was happening. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Brother Ram said, "But that woman at the well knew what was happening. &gt;&gt; That attribute that was in her. It picked up what was what was happening." Now, now folks, I I don't mean it to sound wrong, but we've had we've had we've had Baptist buzzards and Lutheran buzzards and Wesleyan buzzards. We don't want to be message buzzards. We don't want to be Amen. roosting around on what happened back in the 50s and the 60s and everything God is and what he done IS BACK THERE. THERE'S a whole group THAT'S TAKING US BACK THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. Telling you to vote your pastor out and just play a tape. You know, there there's a there's a movement going on that's trying to keep a person stuck on what had happened. &gt;&gt; But there's something happening tonight. YOU SAY, "PREACHER, WHAT IS HAPPENING?" THE WORD THAT was on THOSE TAPES ARE TAKING THE FLESH. THEY'RE MOVING INTO THE CHURCH. THERE'S BEEN A UNION between the bride AND THIS MESSAGE. THE SEVENTH SEAL IS LIFE. &gt;&gt; He's living. HE'S ALIVE. AND HE'S RIGHT HERE TONIGHT IN THE FORM OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. Brother man said it like this. He says, "How would it be done?" It's happening right before you in the name of the Lord Jesus. What is it, brother Wayne? What's happening? It's a spiritual union of Christ and his church. When the flesh is becoming united with the word and the word is becoming flesh, that's what's happening. The message is becoming FLESH AND THE FLESH IS BECOMING THE MESSAGE. IT'S THE POWER OF TRANSFORMATION. YOU DON'T THINK YOUR WEDNESDAY night matters, but every time you take a bite, there's an unlocking of a gene of GOD ON THE INSIDE of you. Amen. And watch it begin to stack up. Watch a Wednesday stack on a Sunday and a Sunday stack on a Wednesday. AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU'VE MOVED FROM an infant TO A GROWN MAN THAT HAS STRENGTH AND HAS POWER. YOU got there ONE BITE AT A TIME. And if you're going to get maturity in this message, you'll get it one sermon. You'll get it one message. You'll get it one quote here a little, THERE A LITTLE, LINE UPON LINE. &gt;&gt; MY LORD, THERE'S A BRIDE [screaming] ON THE SCENE. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening. Listen. And there's nothing can stop it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I know what I'm talking about. Your bad mood can't stop this message. &gt;&gt; Your your bad year can't stop this message. Your your gan lineage can't stop THIS MESSAGE. THE DEVIL can't stop it. People get say, "Well, I tell you what, we got all these haters now, and they're going to stop the message." Nonsense. &gt;&gt; They'll never stop this message. They'll never stop the attributes of God. AMEN. THEY'LL BURN. WE'LL BURN BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD. WE MIGHT BE IN A MINORITY, BUT WE'LL HAVE A MAJORITY OF POWER BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL OF THIS MESSAGE IS IN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. Nothing's going to hinder it. Nothing's going TO STOP IT. THE DEVIL DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO STOP THE GENES OF ALMIGHTY GOD. He is a tool in the hand of God. And what he means for evil, God will make it turn TO GOOD. IF GOD BE BEFORE YOU, WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU? [laughter] NAY, IN ALL THINGS, WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS IN CHRIST JESUS. I TELL YOU WHAT, the devil got his hands full. The effectiveness of the revelation of Melazdc will tell you that you were right there with Job before the foundations of the WORLD SHOUTING FOR JOY. AMEN. AND I WAS SHOUTING BEFORE THERE WAS A DEVIL. And I can tell the devil tonight, if you want to watch me, COME ON AND WATCH ME. BUT I'M GOING TO SHOUT. I'M GONNA PRAISE. I'M GOING TO REJOICE. I'M GOING TO PREACH THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE I'M a believer. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; No, you ain't going to stop this message. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, you you sooner try to stop the sun from rising. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to happen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this message is moving forward. Amen. I'll tell you folks, it's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Amen. Brother Bram says it. He says, listen, he says he said what would take place in this age and here it is happening &gt;&gt; and the Satan is trying his best to keep you from seeing it. &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to do. He's trying to keep you from seeing what's happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going on whether you know it's going on or not. There is a union happening between this bride and his and her lover, the word of God. Every time you hear the message, every time a man of God preaches this word, you become a little more what you're supposed to become. The more you feed ON THIS MESSAGE, YOU BECOME MORE of what you're supposed to become. I BELIEVE THE THIRD PULL HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE ELEMENTS of your body. &gt;&gt; I believe it can unlock things in you. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "These are mysterious happenings, but you'll understand it." That's right. You'll understand it &gt;&gt; cuz this church is built on the revelation of the word of the season, &gt;&gt; a present truth. Listen, hell ain't against denomination, folks. &gt;&gt; No, brother Wayne, if we're in the will of God, why is everything against us? I'll tell you why. Cuz Satan and all of his angels against the revelation that Christ is here now. &gt;&gt; As long as you want to put him in another age, folks, I know what I'm talking about. Denomination, all Amen. They devil ain't against it. They're on his team. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, why don't they have that same trouble over at this Baptist group?" Well, it's because he's on their team. &gt;&gt; He ain't fighting them. &gt;&gt; What do you think the mark of the beast is? &gt;&gt; It's denomination. &gt;&gt; The daughter of the great harlot is denominational systems. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Hell ain't fighting that. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's fighting this message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SAID the gates of hell will be against it, but it will never prevail. &gt;&gt; It'll never prevail because revelation will prevail over the devil every time. &gt;&gt; What's What's happening, brother Wayne? What's happening? I tell you what's happening. I tell you what's happening tonight. The sons and daughters of God are on this earth and this message is lightening coming into their soul to enlighten who they were before. &gt;&gt; What they're doing here now and how they're going to get out of here. &gt;&gt; This message is unlocking the part of you that nothing else could unlock. It's bringing into what is happening in your day. It's the manifestation of the hour. Now, when I say that to you, when you read about Melazdc, and I'll be closing here soon. When you read about Melkazedc, you read how that he come to Abraham. And when he come to Abraham, go read Genesis 14 and see when he came, he came with o he come with wine and bread. He didn't have a lamb. &gt;&gt; Elohim the word didn't have a lamb in Genesis 14 or in Genesis 18. But in Matthew the 3 chapter, Jesus stands in the river Jordan and Elohim fills that human temple and says, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." &gt;&gt; And the God of heaven claimed a lamb. And it wasn't David's lamb. It wasn't Isaiah's lamb. It was God's lamb. &gt;&gt; This wasn't one Moses was carrying. &gt;&gt; This wasn't one David was carrying. Amen. &gt;&gt; This wasn't one that Joshua carried. &gt;&gt; THIS ONE GOD [screaming] HIMSELF CLAIMED a human body and sacrif God set in here. &gt;&gt; You said, "Bro, what are you talking about?" God Mechazedc claimed a lamb. &gt;&gt; But he's not here tonight claiming a lamb. He's here claiming a bride. &gt;&gt; He's claiming a bride. He's claiming flesh that the gene of God is laying in. And he's saying, "Hey, man. You belong to me before you were your mom and dad's child. Before you were in this earth, you already belong to me, and I'm here to lay claim on what is mine." &gt;&gt; Now, has y'all ever st study the claiming work? I'm not going to preach on tonight. Do you ever study the claiming work? And you hear preachers talk about redemption claims and they talk and you say, "Why are they always on that redemption claims?" Because brother Brandham says he morphs himself in what he claims. He immores himself in what he claims. &gt;&gt; And today he is claiming a bride &gt;&gt; because he is going to immor himself in bride form. So what's happening, brother Wayne? It's the bride coming of Jesus Christ. Come on. That's why I teach it's a bride age. IT'S THE BRIDE COMING OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS AIN'T JUST ANOTHER AGE. THIS IS THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD COMING TO MANIFESTATION IN THE FLESH OF OUR BODIES. You say, "Brother Wayne, I'm nothing." I agree. Your human body is nothing. It came like every other body, but there's a gene in you had come from almighty God and he sent this message for you. &gt;&gt; Maybe you were born to a certain family. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're born to a certain family and that family line's got high temper. Half of your life you fought with high tempers and it and it and it's totally disturbed your life and it's always coming at you and it's always saying I'll be here forever. I'm going to take this life. But then there's something on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; There's something in you. This message will come over your life and it'll say look, amen. Before the temper was passed through a human trait, there was a gene of God put in you THAT HAS THE POWER TO OVERCOME IT. The message of the hour is here to claim you. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; To immorate in you. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; God's not God's God's brother said it. He said, "The pillar of fire is here to change our hearts." &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is here tonight &gt;&gt; to change the mask of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's putting on the mask of the bride &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. So, by the way, what's happening? I tell you what's happening. The message of the hour is taking over your life. &gt;&gt; And the more it takes over, &gt;&gt; it's going to bring forth full sons, &gt;&gt; full daughters, &gt;&gt; of the living God. I believe tonight, &gt;&gt; I believe that it's the same Jesus &gt;&gt; in the form of the bride. &gt;&gt; In the form of the bride. Come, musicians come, the same Jesus &gt;&gt; in the form of the bride. &gt;&gt; So, brother Wayne, I come into this earth in this in this condition. Friends, listen. There's not a condition that can stop it. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it's unstoppable. He said, "An attribute &gt;&gt; that cannot be destroyed." I like that quote. He said, "An attribute son." Do do you know an attribute son is the son that was in the life? Attribute son. But we're moving from attribute son to manifested son. &gt;&gt; And this message is moving you there. &gt;&gt; Do you see? He's claiming you to immorph you. Can you imagine that you and who you are and all you are &gt;&gt; but he come to claim you. [music] I mean think of brother Brandham picking up the story of Abraham and Sarah and going there and Sarah laughed and he talked about that and then he goes over [music] and says watch King Amalcch took her and brother Bram said God went over there and said to King Amalcch you give her back. &gt;&gt; Amen. you give her back. Why? Because the seed was going to come through her. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said, if he'd do that for the natural line, what about the supernatural line? This this royal seed of Abraham. No wonder a prophet would [music] look at the church and say, "Don't touch her again. You trinitarian spirit, don't touch her again. I claim her in the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; What was he doing? I take every spirit in here under my control. What was he doing? [music] &gt;&gt; He was TELLING THE DEVIL, "GOD'S GOT ATTRIBUTES on this earth. &gt;&gt; MY MESSAGE IS GOING to live." &gt;&gt; Everybody's looking back here to Brother Random. You know, they're looking back to the prophet just back that way. And they're trying to discuss, was Brother Brandham, was he right? Was he wrong? Did he [music] did he mess up here? Did he lie here? Do do you not realize that's the devil [music] trying to get you to look back all those years ago at what happened when God's doing something tonight and [music] it takes the focus of the happening away from the church. But listen, we're going to express it anyhow. &gt;&gt; We're going to express bride anyhow. He can bring all he wants to bring, but we're going to go right on being bride anyhow. You know, in things that are to be, he said it was your duty [music] to express the gene of God to this age. It's your duty to express. You got a duty to express to [music] this age the gene of God. This is bride's revival. Don't y'all believe that? This is bride's revival. So, well, the church ain't full tonight. That don't mean one thing. Bride's revival is not numbers. Brother Bram said it [music] very clearly. He said it's not. He said the lake of Michigan had a great revival and not 1 ounce more water was in that lake. [music] And he said so we find there will never be another name added to the lamb's book alive either. [music] But this message is a bride's revival to awaken that which was already on the book. It's the gene expression of God coming forth off the book. And you are that gene. Now [music] I'm going to say brother Bram talks about that man went down there and God sent him to a town to hold a revival and said when he got down there said he got up there going going to rented a [music] little room there and was cleaning off the window you know and going to hold a revival right there in that place and a bully in the town come up there and said you ain't going to hold no revival here and he said [music] oh yeah he said well God sent me down here to do it it's my duty God sent me say I got a gene I got to express God sent me to do it in this town [music] right here and he said going to start cleaning that wind. And that fella said, "Look, you ain't going to hold a revival here. You're going to have [music] to whip me first." And brother Bam said he crawled off there and smacked the old boy. Got right down on top of him and started whipping him [music] good. And he said, "If I must fight, if I must rain, decrease my courage, Lord." He got him whipped good. Whipped that bully and stood him up on his [music] feet. He said, "Now church starts at 7:00." And brother Bam said he was there at night on the front row and got saved. [music] But see, there might be a bully you're going to have to whip in your life because God has sent you to this age to express [music] this message in this age. And if there's an old if there's an old depression bully mounting up on YOUR LIFE, NO REVIVAL HERE, WILL YOU JUST TELL HIM, "SATAN, YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THIS REVIVAL." [music] I wish somebody preached with me tonight. Is there a gene expression in this word THAT'S IN THIS PLACE TONIGHT THAT'LL SAY, "SATAN, YOU'LL NOT STOP THIS ONE." &gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP THIS ONE. GOD HAS CLAIMED ME TO REMORPHE in me. AND I SAY THIS, I'LL COME AGAINST EVERYTHING SATAN'S got to do what God called me to do. Brother, I tell you, it's not the dog in the [music] fight. It's the size of the fight that's in the dog. Brother Mark, [music] you can do it. You got what it takes in you to do it. [music] He claims what he more. Could you stand to your feet with me tonight? I say, God, I know it's the first [music] night of a meeting, but it feels pretty good. It just feels pretty good. So the next time you hear a preacher preaching on God claimed [music] you, he didn't claim you to have you. He claimed you to immorate in you [music] to express himself in you. Let's just bow our head. Almighty God, we thank you [music] tonight. We thank you for the revelation of Melazdc that's coming this age. Lord, I I don't know what the people come expecting tonight, but these things are upon our hearts. Lord, [music] these things that you have placed upon our heart, I pray they'd be a blessing to your children in this age. Lord, your gene, your children, your attribute sons and daughters that are [music] in this place. Father, I pray the message of the hour becomes so real. I pray that it takes preeminence over everything else in their [music] lives, Lord. And Father, tonight we surrender. We surrender everything that we are. We ask you Lord, Lord, move through us in a way that you would see fit. We ask you for that great moving of your anointing, Lord. In the name of [music] Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. [music] Yes. We thank you for it, Father. We thank [music] you for your spirit tonight. ask you for [music] just [singing] who I am. &gt;&gt; You can tell [singing] them &gt;&gt; I am [music] redeemed. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I am [music and singing] redeemed. have been bought with the price. Jesus has changed my [singing and music] all my life. And if [singing] I [music] ask you just who I [music] am, &gt;&gt; you can tell them [singing] that I am redeemed. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I [singing] am redeemed.

[singing] God [music] with you. Oh Jesus [music and singing] has changed my whole life. [singing] [music] And if anybody ask you just [singing and music] who I am, tell them I am [singing] redeemed.

[music] It's a revelation. [singing] It's predestination [music] of who I [singing] am. [music] This victory that day he [singing] set me free [music] and made my heart [singing] his very [music] throne. My life is [music and singing] no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine and [singing] now I live. You praise the praise [singing and music] name. Oh, sing it now. Who I am, Lord. [music] Who I [singing] am. [music] I can see now who [music and singing] I am. a part of my savior, [singing and music] a part of his word. It's a revelation. [singing and music] It's predestination of who I am. [singing and music] On Calvary, he died to redeem his [singing and music] lost bride. the King of Kings became. [singing] Well, aren't you glad for that? This [music] is God's great mystery [singing] of love expressed to me that Christ and [music and singing] I might be made one. Glory to God. Oh, who I am, [singing] Lord. It's who I am. And I [music and singing] can see now who I am. A part of my savior, a part of his word. [singing] It's [music] a revelation. It's [singing] predestination.

It's [music] predation. It's predestination [music] of [singing] who I am. Bless the name of the Lord. Aren't you glad for the revelation? Amen. Of who he is and who we are [music] and who he is in us. God expressing himself in his body. Amen. I love the Lord. Did you enjoy it this evening? Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. There's that little song. My chains are gone. [music] My chains are gone. [singing] I've been set free. [music] My God, my Savior [singing] has ransomed [music] me.
