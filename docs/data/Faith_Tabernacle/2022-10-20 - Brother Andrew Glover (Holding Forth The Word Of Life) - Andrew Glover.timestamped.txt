[21:13] I have a friend of mine a brother
[21:15] in the Lord over in Russia and he's got
[21:18] a family and a church
[21:20] and uh
[21:22] they're really concerned

[21:30] a draft
[21:31] and uh
[21:33] he had asked me to remember his family
[21:36] in prayer because there's a lot of a lot
[21:39] of tension
[21:40] a lot of uncertainty there and many of
[21:44] them people some of them people are
[21:46] Christians over there A lot of times
[21:47] people think that all Russians are just
[21:49] a bunch of communists atheists it's not
[21:51] that way at all that's maybe the way it
[21:54] used to be but it's not that way now
[21:57] but I'd like you to remember them in
[21:59] prayer
[22:00] because there is a lot of Christian folk
[22:03] over there and

[41:35] man the book of Philippians the second
[41:37] chapter I want to read the 12th verse of
[41:41] Philippians 2. everybody love the Lord
[41:43] here
[41:44] Paul here says wherefore my beloved as
[41:47] ye have always obeyed not as in my
[41:50] presence only
[41:51] but now much more in my absence work out
[41:53] your own salvation with fear and
[41:56] trembling for it is God which worketh in
[41:59] you both to will and do of his good
[42:01] pleasure do all things without
[42:04] murmurings and disputings my wouldn't
[42:06] that be a miracle do all things without
[42:09] murmurings and disputings that you may
[42:11] be blameless and harmless the sons of
[42:14] God without rebuke notice in the midst
[42:18] of a crooked and perverse Nation among
[42:20] whom ye shine as light in the world now
[42:23] Paul has just identified that the
[42:25] Christians is the lights of the world
[42:27] holding forth the word of life that I
[42:30] may rejoice in the day of Christ that I
[42:32] may not run have not run in vain neither
[42:35] labored in vain yea and if I be offered
[42:37] upon the sacrifice in service of your
[42:40] faith I joy and rejoice with you all for
[42:43] the same cause also do you Joy and
[42:46] rejoice with me now if we could also
[42:49] look in the New Testament in the Book of
[42:50] Matthew the fifth chapter
[42:52] The Book of Matthew the fifth chapter I
[42:55] want to read a very very familiar
[42:56] portion of reading there in Matthew 5.
[43:01] we'll look at the 14th verse of Matthew
[43:04] 5.
[43:06] in the Bible here Jesus speaking says ye
[43:09] are the light of the world a city that
[43:12] is set on a hill cannot be hid
[43:15] neither do men light a candle and put it
[43:18] under a bushel but on a Candlestick
[43:21] notice this and it giveth life unto all
[43:25] that are in the house let your light so
[43:28] shine before men that they may see your
[43:31] good works now notice this they're going
[43:33] to see your good works but that's going
[43:36] to cause them to glorify your father
[43:38] which is in heaven we ask Lord this
[43:41] evening to bless the reading of his word
[43:42] as you can be seated here this afternoon
[43:44] I want to by the help of the Lord to
[43:47] speak to his night out of the book of
[43:48] Philippians the second chapter there
[43:50] I'll draw my title I want to speak to
[43:52] you on holding forth the Word of Life
[43:54] holding forth the word of life I'd
[43:57] actually been studying and praying in a
[43:59] totally different direction and I woke
[44:00] up this morning with these thoughts very
[44:03] heavy upon my heart so I just pray the
[44:05] Lord will come by tonight and speak to
[44:06] us from his word but I want to title
[44:08] this again as I said holding forth the
[44:10] word of life and if you look in the book
[44:12] of Philippians the second chapter I just
[44:14] want to read this to you maybe uh the
[44:16] the portion we read from the Amplified
[44:18] version he says so so then my dear ones
[44:21] just as you've always obeyed my
[44:24] instructions with enthusiasm not only in
[44:26] my presence but now much more in my
[44:28] absence continue to work out your
[44:30] salvation that is cultivate it bring it
[44:33] to full effect actively pursue spiritual
[44:36] maturity with all inspired fear and
[44:39] trembling using serious caution critical
[44:42] self-evaluation to avoid anything that
[44:44] might offend God or discredit the name
[44:47] of Christ now it is not now notice this
[44:49] for it is
[44:51] not your strength but it is God who is
[44:54] effectively at work in you both to Will
[44:56] and to work that is strengthening
[44:58] energizing and creating in you the
[45:00] longing and the ability to fulfill your
[45:02] purpose for his good pleasure do
[45:04] everything without mermaid or
[45:06] questioning notice this so that you may
[45:08] prove yourselves to be blameless and
[45:10] Godless innocent and contaminated
[45:12] children of God without blemish in the
[45:14] midst of a morally crooked and
[45:17] spiritually perverted generation how
[45:19] many will agree that we're living in a
[45:21] morally perverted and a spiritually amen
[45:24] perverted generation among whom ye are
[45:26] seen as bright lights amen beacons
[45:29] shining out clearly in the world of
[45:31] Darkness holding out and offering to
[45:33] everyone the word of life so that in the
[45:35] day of Christ I will have reason to
[45:37] Rejoice greatly because I did not run my
[45:40] race in vain nor labor without result
[45:43] now Amen brother bam says in a prayer
[45:45] and by faith Moses now we would ask Lord
[45:47] that you would forgive us of any mistake
[45:49] any sin of trespasser only Mission
[45:51] transgression any evil fault has pierced
[45:54] our soul by the fiery arch of the devil
[45:56] that you would drive away this enemy
[45:58] from thine and of thy people and we
[46:00] would ask that you would send the Holy
[46:01] Spirit to take a hold of the word at
[46:03] this time as we yield ourselves as
[46:06] instruments that you would speak through
[46:07] us and hear through US Thy word may we
[46:10] in return receive it as from thee and
[46:13] leave this place today feeling that we
[46:15] have been readjusted to the cause of
[46:17] Christ that we might be better fit for
[46:19] the service because of the visitation of
[46:22] the holy spirit so the prophet is
[46:23] actually praying amen that God would
[46:26] readjust the church amen back to the
[46:28] focus of the cause of Christ bless our
[46:30] Brethren everywhere and the churches
[46:32] across the world who is holding forth
[46:34] amend the Word of Life in this evil day
[46:37] how many will agree that we are living
[46:39] in an evil day we are living in a
[46:42] morally crooked Nation we are living in
[46:44] a spiritually perverse generation amen
[46:46] but there is a word that is coming to
[46:48] this generation and it's not the word of
[46:51] a man it is the word of God which is the
[46:53] Word of Life see amen we feel that there
[46:55] is not much time left to work for the
[46:57] for the night is swiftly coming and the
[47:00] war clouds are floating again evil is at
[47:02] hand and we pray that you'll let us work
[47:04] as never before notice just rest our
[47:07] tired bodies Lord and send us back into
[47:09] the battle for we ask it in the name of
[47:12] the Lord and we pray this in our name so
[47:14] in other words the prophet is saying
[47:16] that we are not in a natural battle or a
[47:19] national battle but we are in a
[47:20] spiritual battle
[47:22] we are facing spirits of the enemy that
[47:25] is coming against the church in the age
[47:27] that we're living in now this spiritual
[47:29] battle amen is what a prophet would call
[47:31] the battle for truth so in a in a
[47:33] morally crooked nation in a spiritually
[47:35] perverse generation amen there would
[47:38] actually be a battle that would be
[47:39] declared but it would not be a national
[47:41] battle it would be a battle for truth
[47:44] remember said in this battle for truth
[47:45] then M's has been lost but God said they
[47:48] would be restored again in the last day
[47:51] so then we are here tonight amen not to
[47:54] look at scripture not to just memorize
[47:56] scripture amen but we are actually here
[47:58] to fulfill the scripture I love what the
[48:01] problem of God says and what shall I do
[48:02] with this Jesus called Christ he said
[48:04] when this word has been spoken for this
[48:06] certain generation there is going to be
[48:08] somebody that will rise on the scene
[48:10] that'll fulfill the word because God has
[48:14] spoke it it's a Vindication of the
[48:16] spoken word amen Jesus meant every
[48:19] qualification and was the word he was
[48:21] Vindicated it as Messiah he said there
[48:24] is also words that are spoken in the
[48:26] Bible for the last day and those words
[48:29] have to come to life amen there were
[48:32] words that were laying there for
[48:33] thousands of years that was speaking of
[48:36] the coming of a messiah and when Jesus
[48:38] came on the scene amen he his body
[48:41] actually gave life to those words that
[48:44] were speaking of the coming of a messiah
[48:46] amen now come on Church cause there's
[48:48] words laying there it said there's going
[48:50] to be Overcomers and there's going to be
[48:51] people that are going to be more than
[48:53] conquerors there's a word laying there
[48:55] that said you're going to be the city
[48:57] that is going to be set on a hill listen
[48:59] friends God is not going to raise up
[49:01] Paul Amen to bring the promises of this
[49:03] aids to lie he's not going to raise up
[49:06] William Branham to bring the promises to
[49:08] life amen but he's got flesh here upon
[49:10] the Earth in the middle of a morally
[49:12] crooked nation in a spiritually
[49:14] perverted generation there is a bride
[49:17] upon the Earth who has received the
[49:19] message of the hour and that message has
[49:21] called her amen from the confusion of
[49:23] this world from the confusion of this
[49:25] nation into a place of fulfillment by
[49:27] the word of God listen I want to propose
[49:30] to you tonight that we don't just have
[49:32] the word amen we have the revelation of
[49:34] the word we don't just have the Bible
[49:36] and then we've got the god of the Bible
[49:38] can you say Amen if the church way back
[49:41] there in that third age had only held on
[49:43] to the revelation of the Living Word in
[49:45] their midst listen he says the power of
[49:48] God would have not faded as it did in
[49:50] those Dark Ages but right today somebody
[49:52] say right today
[49:54] right today when the church returns to
[49:58] the word in faith we can say without
[50:00] doubt that the glory of God and the
[50:04] wonderful acts of God will be in her
[50:06] midst again when the word when the
[50:09] church returns to the word amen the
[50:12] glory of God and the wonderful acts of
[50:14] God will be manifested and identified in
[50:17] the midst of the church again how many
[50:19] knows that every voice and every sign
[50:22] will come together amen there is a sign
[50:24] but the prophet said there would be a
[50:26] voice to the sign do you realize there
[50:28] was a sign of Malachi 4 do you realize
[50:30] what the voice of Malachi 4 was remember
[50:33] said the voice of Malachi 4 is return to
[50:37] the word amen the voice of Malachi 4 is
[50:41] return to the word then John 1 1 says in
[50:45] the beginning what's the word and the
[50:47] Word was with God and the Word was God
[50:49] if you drop down to the 14th verse it
[50:52] says that the word was made flesh and
[50:54] dwelt Among Us amen and we beheld his
[50:57] glory amen the glory as of the only
[50:59] begotten of the father amen which was
[51:01] what full of grace and truth now in
[51:04] other words you see here amen that God
[51:07] is a spirit right amen and they that
[51:09] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[51:12] and in truth amen then God which is a
[51:15] spirit amen which is the word amen came
[51:18] to flesh in Jesus amen by the spoken
[51:21] word in other words Jesus was not
[51:23] outside of the word he was not just a
[51:26] part of the word amen but Jesus is the
[51:28] word that's what the prophet says in the
[51:30] church age book we can see his
[51:32] association with the word amen he is the
[51:36] word how many would agree that Jesus of
[51:38] John 1 14
[51:40] Jesus is the word
[51:43] that is who he is the word in his name
[51:46] in John 1 1 it said in the beginning was
[51:48] the word he said the root from which we
[51:50] get our translation from word is logos
[51:53] which means the fault or the ex-concept
[51:55] it has the double meaning of thought and
[51:58] speech now a thought expressed is a word
[52:01] or word isn't that wonderful so John
[52:04] says that the concept of God was
[52:07] expressed in Jesus amen the concept of
[52:10] God Amen was expressed in Jesus do you
[52:13] hear me the concept of God was expressed
[52:16] in Jesus amen then Jesus was the
[52:19] expression of God he was the expression
[52:22] of the deity of almighty god listen
[52:24] that's why Paul says in Hebrews 1 1 that
[52:27] God who at Sunder at times and diverse
[52:29] manners speak in times passing of the
[52:31] fathers by the prophets but half in
[52:33] these last days spoken unto us by his
[52:35] son which is logos whom he has appointed
[52:38] heir of all things but whom also we made
[52:40] the worlds who be in the brightness of
[52:42] his glory notice this the expressed
[52:44] image of this person and upholding All
[52:46] Things by the word of his power when he
[52:48] had himself purged our sins sat down on
[52:51] the right hand of the Majesty on high
[52:53] remember says God became expressed in
[52:56] the person of Jesus Christ amen Jesus
[52:59] was the expressed image of God Amen John
[53:02] 1 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt
[53:04] among us then the very substance of God
[53:06] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the
[53:09] great spirit God unto which no man could
[53:11] approach which no man could see or could
[53:13] be hell amen was now tabernacled in
[53:16] flesh and was dwelling among men
[53:18] expressing the fullness of God to men
[53:21] among church amen don't let the devil
[53:23] tell you that Jesus was the second
[53:25] person of some godhead Trinity somewhere
[53:27] amen that he was a Lesser God Amen I
[53:30] propose to you that Jesus is God I
[53:33] propose to you amen that when you've
[53:35] seen him you've seen the father I
[53:37] propose to you amen that all that was in
[53:40] God he poured into Jesus and all that is
[53:42] in Jesus he has poured into the church
[53:45] in the last days come on Friends amen
[53:48] Jesus was the expressed image of God
[53:49] Amen but this bride and this wicked Amen
[53:52] in morally crooked nation and
[53:54] prosperously perverse generation this
[53:57] bride by the word has become the
[53:59] expressed image of almighty God in the
[54:02] age that she's living in she's not
[54:04] manifesting Creeds and pogmas and
[54:06] rituals and traditions she's manifesting
[54:08] the word
[54:10] I propose to you that you're a word born
[54:12] bride
[54:14] well we might as well preach we're here
[54:16] haven't we I propose to you that all
[54:19] that was in God was in Christ and all
[54:21] that was in Christ is in this building
[54:23] tonight by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:25] no man has seen God at any time the only
[54:28] begotten son which is the bosom of the
[54:30] father he hath declared him remember
[54:32] said watch God who on occasions would
[54:35] manifest his presence by the cloud or
[54:37] the pillar of fire that struck fear in
[54:39] the hearts of man this is God Amen this
[54:41] God whose heart characteristics were
[54:44] made known only by the revelation of
[54:46] words to the prophets has now became
[54:49] Emmanuel amen God With Us declared
[54:52] himself the word declare is taken from
[54:55] the Greek root which we often interpret
[54:57] as exeges which means to fairly explain
[55:00] and make clear that is what the Living
[55:03] Word Jesus did he brought God to us for
[55:07] he was God it revealed he revealed God
[55:10] to us with such perfect clarity that
[55:13] John could say about him in first John 1
[55:15] that which was from the beginning which
[55:18] we have heard what was heard was logos
[55:20] or speech which we have seen with our
[55:22] eyes we have looked upon and our hands
[55:24] have handled of the word of life for the
[55:26] life was manifested and we have seen it
[55:29] and bear witness and show unto you that
[55:31] eternal life which was with the father
[55:33] and was manifested unto us that which we
[55:36] have seen and heard declare we unto you
[55:38] that ye Also may have fellowship with us
[55:40] and truly our fellowship is with the
[55:43] father and with his son Jesus Christ
[55:45] when God was truly revealed somebody say
[55:47] revealed when God was truly revealed he
[55:51] was manifested in the flesh to fulfill
[55:54] the word amen he that has seen me has
[55:56] seen the father they were looking for
[55:58] the father amen and looking at Jesus and
[56:01] still saying amen show us the father
[56:03] amen but when the expression of almighty
[56:06] God came into human flesh it could no
[56:09] longer look at Jesus and say so is the
[56:11] father he could say when you've seen me
[56:13] you have seen the father I'm on churches
[56:15] in about 15 different tapes called sirs
[56:18] we would see Jesus and there's a people
[56:20] in the Earth today that's saying where
[56:22] is God who is God where is Jesus what is
[56:24] Jesus amen but I declare to you amen by
[56:27] the concept of almighty God that there
[56:30] is a bride here on the earth who has got
[56:32] the deity of God Amen tabernacled in her
[56:34] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on
[56:37] friends you may be in a wicked Nation
[56:39] you may be in a spiritually perverse
[56:41] generation but there's a gene seed on
[56:44] the inside of you by the baptism of the
[56:46] Holy Ghost that's been ignited in you
[56:48] and there's no wickedness there's no
[56:50] corruption there's no perversion that
[56:52] can stomp out amen the power of deity
[56:54] that lays on the inside of every
[56:56] believer oh my when God revealed himself
[56:59] he was manifested in the flesh
[57:02] I love this Amen in other words the
[57:05] message of the hour is the spiritual
[57:07] union of Christ and his church right now
[57:11] amen Jesus amen was the manifestation of
[57:14] God when deity met if Humanity was
[57:18] expressed in a man called Jesus which
[57:20] was more than a man brother Tim he was a
[57:23] God man amen and there's a bride here
[57:25] today who is more than a church she is
[57:28] more than a woman she is more than a
[57:30] bunch of members amen but deity has once
[57:33] again met with flesh and she has
[57:35] manifesting the thoughts of God that's
[57:37] why the prophet said in the visible
[57:38] Union if I was supposed to die in the
[57:40] morning and a man took my place I cannot
[57:43] die for that sin amen somebody took my
[57:45] place he said Jesus the word took my
[57:48] place he become thee that a sinner that
[57:51] I might become him the word then let me
[57:53] hold true to it amen not the church but
[57:56] the word we are not holding true to Men
[57:59] We are holding true to the word hold
[58:01] that spirit spiritual union of Christ in
[58:03] his church now listen to this where the
[58:06] flesh is becoming word and the word is
[58:09] becoming flesh amen listen you're not
[58:11] just here on a Wednesday night they've
[58:13] been taking up a couple hours hearing a
[58:15] few songs and reading a few scriptures
[58:17] amen but the world may not see it amen
[58:20] by word is becoming flesh and flesh is
[58:23] becoming word in the age we're living
[58:25] I'm on I know you may be discouraged I
[58:27] know you may be tired it may be a wish
[58:29] and I amen but let me prophesy to you by
[58:31] the word that old flesh that you're
[58:33] trapped in right now it's going to be
[58:35] changed one of these mornings by the
[58:37] Dynamics of almighty God will release a
[58:39] faith in you it'll change mortality back
[58:42] to immortality it'll take corruption and
[58:45] turn it back into incorruption we are
[58:47] not just a church we are word becoming
[58:50] flesh and we are flesh becoming word
[58:52] manifested and Vindicated what the Bible
[58:55] said what happened in this day it's
[58:58] happening day by day it's culminating so
[59:01] fast in those deserts and things taking
[59:03] place that I couldn't even keep up with
[59:05] it we are nearing the coming of Jesus to
[59:08] be United with his church where the word
[59:11] becomes the word
[59:13] my where the word becomes the word then
[59:17] you are a mendeity revealed in flesh the
[59:22] world has always tried to find thought
[59:24] with the word we agree they've always
[59:26] tried to find fault with the word amen
[59:28] that's what led them to the first
[59:30] crucifixion Luke the 23rd chapter says
[59:33] when they will come to place which is
[59:35] called what Calvary There They Crucified
[59:38] him and the male factors one on the
[59:41] right and the other on the left Reverend
[59:43] preaches is called the indictment he
[59:45] says now there amen they not the sinner
[59:48] how many's heard that take then name it
[59:50] it's a powerful tape he says There They
[59:53] Crucified him they're the most religious
[59:56] place they the most religious people
[59:59] crucified killed him the most holy
[1:00:02] person there they crucified him notice
[1:00:06] this he said the Church of that day they
[1:00:09] found thought with the man who was the
[1:00:11] word is that right they found fault with
[1:00:13] the man and who was the word he turns
[1:00:15] that and says but now they find fault
[1:00:18] with a word that is working through the
[1:00:19] man
[1:00:20] two thousand years ago brother Bill they
[1:00:23] found fault with a word that was in the
[1:00:26] man he said but now they're finding
[1:00:28] fault with the word that is working
[1:00:30] through the man they just vice versa
[1:00:32] which is the person the Holy Spirit
[1:00:34] working through is God's Vindication now
[1:00:38] Jesus says this in Luke 11 chapter and
[1:00:40] the 21st he says if I with the Finger of
[1:00:43] God cast out Devils then no doubt the
[1:00:45] kingdom of God has come upon you
[1:00:47] remember picks us up in the indictment
[1:00:49] and says they take the very Calvary the
[1:00:51] very reason they know that it was the
[1:00:53] truth but because of jealousy or
[1:00:55] Prejudice what did Jesus say to them if
[1:00:58] I cast out the Devil by the Finger of
[1:01:00] God then who do you cast them out by let
[1:01:02] them be your judge see if I by the
[1:01:04] Finger of God cast out devils not just
[1:01:06] like you heard them say can you prove
[1:01:08] it's the Finger of God I'd like to see I
[1:01:10] heard that question ask him they were
[1:01:12] too smart for that notice because that
[1:01:14] he made himself God and he was God they
[1:01:17] were fined and fought with a man who had
[1:01:20] become the expressed image of the deity
[1:01:22] of Jehovah almighty God in flesh he said
[1:01:25] will not have him rule over us but now
[1:01:27] the thing the same old cry comes again
[1:01:29] listen Spirits don't die amen the same
[1:01:32] spirits that were crying amen 2 000
[1:01:35] years ago on Mount Calvary on Golgotha
[1:01:38] is the same spirit that are crying in
[1:01:40] this age and instead of saying will we
[1:01:42] find fault with this man he said today
[1:01:44] they say that the Bible was written by
[1:01:47] man they say we don't have to live by it
[1:01:49] but that's God's word it's God himself
[1:01:52] he said I was talking to someone
[1:01:53] yesterday well some might have wrote the
[1:01:55] Bible some man I said yes there was his
[1:01:58] name we know him as God it was wrote in
[1:02:01] four thousand years apart almost the
[1:02:03] scriptures back from Job all the way to
[1:02:05] the New Testament and wrote hundreds of
[1:02:07] years apart and was wrote by differently
[1:02:09] and them not knowing the other in
[1:02:11] different parts of the country not one
[1:02:13] word of it will condemn the other listen
[1:02:15] I dare anybody to come under the blood
[1:02:18] of Jesus Christ and claim any problem is
[1:02:21] amen God is obligated to take care of it
[1:02:24] I say this tonight thank God for the
[1:02:27] Bible I say thank God for the word of
[1:02:29] God thank God for the Divine commentary
[1:02:31] amen that is coming to this age amen you
[1:02:34] say what is a commentary are you ready
[1:02:36] for this it is an expression it is an
[1:02:39] expression of an explanation about an
[1:02:41] event or a situation A Commentary is an
[1:02:45] expression or an explanation about an
[1:02:47] event or a current situation let me
[1:02:49] propose to you tonight amen that the
[1:02:52] Divine commentary of the word is the
[1:02:54] perfect interpretation of the word which
[1:02:56] was sent to us by God Amen through
[1:02:59] Vindication listen friends amen perfect
[1:03:02] interpretation is molding a character in
[1:03:05] this bride amen that is fit to rule and
[1:03:07] Reign that will Express the deity of
[1:03:10] almighty God
[1:03:12] Ma you say what you read it's important
[1:03:14] oh it's very important because what you
[1:03:16] read is what molds your character
[1:03:18] probably God said Abraham Lincoln amen
[1:03:20] didn't have any other books until he was
[1:03:22] 21 years old amen but the Bible and the
[1:03:24] fox's book of Martyrs he said see what
[1:03:26] you read most the character that you are
[1:03:29] no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics
[1:03:31] today little old fiction magazines and
[1:03:33] vulgar and nonsense is placed up on
[1:03:34] their new stands amen look what those
[1:03:36] two books made him amen Abraham Lincoln
[1:03:39] become a man who changed the world he
[1:03:42] changed politics he changed situations
[1:03:44] that looked impossible how did he do it
[1:03:46] he did it by two books the Bible and the
[1:03:48] foxes Book of Murder oh God can I preach
[1:03:51] to you if Abraham Lincoln can be of
[1:03:54] successful politician amen by two books

[1:04:03] people in this building that can be more
[1:04:05] successful than Abraham Lincoln ever

[1:04:09] there's people sitting here tonight that
[1:04:11] can do more or amen than any politician
[1:04:14] ever dreamed about doing amen because
[1:04:15] they're not just reading the Bible amen
[1:04:18] they're under the influence of the
[1:04:19] Divine commentary of the expression of
[1:04:22] God that they're reading about my to
[1:04:24] think about a Divine commentary how can
[1:04:26] we not think about a man named Abraham
[1:04:28] the prophet said God just like you did
[1:04:30] to Abraham we know he had his
[1:04:31] frustrations and he staggered but when
[1:04:34] the Divine commentary of his life was
[1:04:36] written he staggered not at the promise
[1:04:39] of God through unbelief amen but were
[1:04:41] strong given praise to God oh God he
[1:04:44] says let all my little staggers and
[1:04:46] misspelled words and mispronounce and so
[1:04:48] forth let the Holy Spirit just smooth it
[1:04:51] out and put a real Divine commentary in
[1:04:54] every heart of this message tonight how
[1:04:57] many would say God let my heart become
[1:05:00] the habitation of the Divine commentary
[1:05:02] of the word of almighty God in the age
[1:05:05] that I'm living in you say commentary
[1:05:07] I'm talking about a living commentary
[1:05:09] not talking about a book not talking
[1:05:11] about a tape I'm talking about flesh
[1:05:13] that has become the word and word that
[1:05:16] has become flesh
[1:05:17] look what Paul tells us in second
[1:05:19] Corinthians 3 he says ye are a pistol
[1:05:21] written in our hearts known in the red
[1:05:23] of all men for as much as your
[1:05:25] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:05:27] Christ amen ministered by US Written not
[1:05:31] with ink amen but with the spirit of the
[1:05:33] Living God not in tables have sown but
[1:05:36] in fleshly tables of the heart we find
[1:05:38] out the first church did represent him
[1:05:40] amen as written Epistles his life lift
[1:05:44] to those people he says I can't compare
[1:05:46] our church today as hard as it is to say
[1:05:48] as much as I love people you got to be
[1:05:51] honest they know they had been with
[1:05:52] Jesus he said because in Acts the fourth
[1:05:54] chapter amen we found two fishermen
[1:05:56] Peter and John amen and was healing the
[1:05:59] manifigate beautiful and was able to
[1:06:01] answer any question that the Sanhedrin
[1:06:03] had asked them amen yet they were
[1:06:05] ignorant and unlearned they could
[1:06:07] perceive they had no education they were
[1:06:09] not trained ministers they were
[1:06:11] fishermen but those people perceived
[1:06:13] that they had been with Jesus see
[1:06:15] because the way they was acting a in the
[1:06:18] same way he acted on them the way they
[1:06:21] were acting amen was the same way he
[1:06:24] acted on them then pray tell me what was
[1:06:26] Peter and John amen they were
[1:06:28] Expressions they were divine

[1:06:33] upper room listen Peter and John amen
[1:06:36] didn't write one book on how they
[1:06:38] received the Holy Ghost in the upper
[1:06:40] room amen but in Acts of fourth chapter

[1:07:07] ideology they have been in the presence
[1:07:09] of God and they have become flesh the
[1:07:12] word has become flesh in their flesh

[1:11:54] what he did if he did not rise again
[1:11:57] from the dead then all of it was in vain
[1:11:59] but it is to me to prove that he was God

[1:12:04] resurrection it is also the place of the
[1:12:06] resting place of the Soul it listen this

[1:12:57] she got started under the gospel and
[1:13:00] your crowning point of consolation is
[1:13:01] the gospel what are you saying I'm
[1:13:03] saying there's a people on the Earth
[1:13:05] that can no more die than God can
[1:13:07] because deity has come into humanity and

[1:13:53] remember I said I think it's the great
[1:13:54] coronation of the Full Gospel is the
[1:13:57] resurrection it's divine promises can I
[1:13:59] preach to you and the consolation they
[1:14:01] give to those who are trusting it for it
[1:14:03] promises you say the resurrection is a
[1:14:05] powerful promise here's what it promises
[1:14:06] the great Union of our uniting together
[1:14:09] again it promises the Fate in a way of
[1:14:12] all sin it promises the Fate in the way
[1:14:14] of all deformities all the sufferings
[1:14:16] that we have did in this life had to go
[1:14:19] through it with his life it promises The
[1:14:21] Vanishing of it all it promises that
[1:14:23] even death will lose its hold and will
[1:14:25] rise in the likeness of Jesus so to my
[1:14:28] opinion the resurrection is the greatest
[1:14:30] of all promises in the things of the
[1:14:32] scripture amen there is where it's
[1:14:34] seated are you hearing me where we're
[1:14:37] Satan is in the promise of Resurrection
[1:14:39] according to the gospel what are you
[1:14:42] saying I'm saying that the message of
[1:14:44] the hour that we're following is
[1:14:45] according to the scriptures
[1:14:47] Life Death burial Resurrection coming
[1:14:50] was according to the scriptures the
[1:14:53] message of the hour is according to the
[1:14:56] scripture remember said see he said
[1:14:58] search the scripture Jesus told you that
[1:15:00] amen search the scripture and align your
[1:15:03] beliefs with the scripture I can't get
[1:15:04] bogged down here but Amos I preach all
[1:15:06] night remember some time or another we
[1:15:09] got to take our beliefs and not align
[1:15:10] them with what a man said amen but align
[1:15:13] them with the scripture amen search the
[1:15:15] scripture for in them you think you have
[1:15:17] eternal life and there they which
[1:15:18] testify of me do you realize you cannot
[1:15:21] make the scripture lie do you realize
[1:15:23] that God testifies amen of his gifts
[1:15:26] according to the scripture do you
[1:15:28] realize that the Miracles that we see
[1:15:29] done are done according to the scripture
[1:15:32] do you realize even the world conditions
[1:15:35] amen that we're living in and watching
[1:15:37] unfold we can forecast it by the
[1:15:39] scripture amen because the message of
[1:15:41] the hour has aligned our beliefs of the
[1:15:44] resurrection of the coming of God of the
[1:15:47] Resurrection of God has aligned our
[1:15:49] beliefs with the word by them to think
[1:15:51] tonight amen the scriptures have been
[1:15:53] revealed and people still can't see that
[1:15:56] it is the promised word remember saying
[1:15:58] now notices he said I cannot be a
[1:15:59] Catholic he said because they believe
[1:16:01] the word is inspired amen but they put
[1:16:03] the church over the word he said neither
[1:16:05] can I be a Protestant he said because
[1:16:07] they take just as much of the word as
[1:16:09] they want and only parts that are
[1:16:11] inspired amen so I believe what the
[1:16:13] Bible says to be the truth he said I
[1:16:16] believe that it's God's word in order to
[1:16:18] believe that I've got to surrender are
[1:16:20] you ready for this I've got to surrender
[1:16:21] my whole life and my whole will to that
[1:16:24] to believe that it is the truth that
[1:16:26] there's nothing else but the truth
[1:16:28] there's no more to be added to no more
[1:16:31] to be taken away what it says is what
[1:16:33] it's supposed to be now in order to do
[1:16:35] that I must believe that God's word is
[1:16:38] absolutely the truth can I stop here and
[1:16:41] ask you how many beliefs that God's word
[1:16:43] is absolutely the truth
[1:16:46] you believe that then with that faith in
[1:16:49] your heart you can walk over every devil

[1:16:59] revelation what are you saying I'm
[1:17:01] saying that will either accept the Full
[1:17:03] Gospel or will reject the Full Gospel

[1:17:22] Full Gospel the full power and the full
[1:17:25] Bible everything that God says accept it

[1:17:30] presenting to you in the middle of a
[1:17:32] crooked Nation amen and a spiritually
[1:17:34] perverse generation he was not
[1:17:36] presenting himself to you he was
[1:17:38] presenting the word to you and saying
[1:17:41] you'll either accept the word or you'll
[1:17:43] reject the word oh my come on church

[1:17:57] us who we are where we come from and
[1:17:59] where we're going of all the fine
[1:18:01] literature that's in the world today the
[1:18:03] Bible is the only book that is positive
[1:18:05] the truth in the face of everything
[1:18:07] that's been published now brother I've
[1:18:09] heard a man say one time this he said
[1:18:11] listen here's the book of the Year
[1:18:13] remember said I said to that man to the
[1:18:14] radio I said I disagree I said there's
[1:18:17] one book of the year and that's the
[1:18:19] Bible of all the years past it's been
[1:18:21] the book of the year the years to come
[1:18:23] it'll be the book of Eternity it reveals
[1:18:26] it is God yes it reveals God every year
[1:18:29] that is to come it's the book of the
[1:18:31] Year listen look at the Bible tells us
[1:18:33] these things is to come speaks of all
[1:18:35] these hours that we've passed through
[1:18:36] that days of Noah predicted amen the
[1:18:39] days of Martin Luther predicted days of
[1:18:40] Wesley the age of Pentecost this hour
[1:18:42] that we're living in was predicted
[1:18:44] everything happened just exactly the way
[1:18:47] it was what is it it's the spoken word
[1:18:50] of God which is Vindicated by God makes
[1:18:53] it light of the hour see just like the
[1:18:56] sun is when the word are you ready for
[1:18:58] this when the word the word itself is
[1:19:01] the light when it's Vindicated for the
[1:19:03] time that it belongs to see it's
[1:19:05] Vindicated then it's the light of the
[1:19:07] hour so when the word becomes Vindicated
[1:19:10] it becomes the light of the hour that
[1:19:13] you're living in you hear me but the
[1:19:15] word Vindicated was Vindicated not in FL
[1:19:18] oh God Amen not in rocks and stones and
[1:19:21] trees amen but the word was Vindicated
[1:19:24] in flesh among brother Branson who
[1:19:27] announced the Messiah was on the earth
[1:19:28] in the days of John it wasn't a tree it
[1:19:31] wasn't a rock it was a man named John
[1:19:33] who was a 16 element born man that had a
[1:19:36] flesh body but the word that was spoken
[1:19:38] concerning him had become flesh
[1:19:42] I'm on Church who condemned who
[1:19:45] condemned Jezebel amen it wasn't a rock
[1:19:47] it wasn't a stone it was a man named
[1:19:50] Elijah amen who preached that's a god of
[1:19:52] Miracles is in the camp it wasn't a
[1:19:55] river it wasn't a mountain it was a man
[1:19:57] named Gideon who stood there and
[1:19:59] declared that god Jehovah has returned
[1:20:02] to the people of God oh God I can't
[1:20:04] hardly teach for preaching tonight do
[1:20:06] you see who you are you are the word
[1:20:08] made flesh and the eats you're living in
[1:20:10] he wasn't Elijah's lied but he was
[1:20:13] Elijah another form vindicating the
[1:20:15] light see that's when Jesus come what
[1:20:17] did he say he was a bright and Shining
[1:20:19] Light for a season but you loved to walk
[1:20:21] in his light and John said now I messed
[1:20:24] them out I must go out now my lights
[1:20:27] finish shining I must go out he must
[1:20:30] increase he's the light he said I am the
[1:20:33] light of the world the same yesterday
[1:20:35] today and forever what he why was he the
[1:20:37] light of the world if he had come said
[1:20:39] he was Messiah he didn't do like the
[1:20:41] Bible said the Messiah would do then he
[1:20:43] wasn't the light of the world
[1:20:45] but the Vindicated word makes it the
[1:20:48] light of the world
[1:20:50] can I tell you what a prophet said he's
[1:20:53] the light of the hour today
[1:20:55] the light of the hour today is Jesus
[1:20:59] Christ the seventh Church age all smooth
[1:21:01] out with Christ on the outside the Moon
[1:21:03] is identified at Darkness coming upon
[1:21:05] the Earth the light pressing in now
[1:21:06] begin the show what's taking place the
[1:21:08] thing will be destroyed and the light
[1:21:10] will come in and destroy it and the
[1:21:13] Saints shall inherit the earth and the
[1:21:15] meek shall inherit the Earth and the
[1:21:17] Earth and the moon will be took away the
[1:21:19] darkness of the night will pass away the
[1:21:21] darkness with their death and Creeds and
[1:21:23] away from the word of God perverted
[1:21:25] things are saying amen the light will
[1:21:27] break forth upon the day I'm on church
[1:21:30] do you see what your life is your life
[1:21:33] is a crucifixion to the darkness of
[1:21:35] leonacea your testimony is a crucifixion
[1:21:38] to a perverse Nation come on friends to
[1:21:41] a crooked Nation to spiritually perverse
[1:21:43] generation the testimony that you hold
[1:21:46] as a child of God is a testimony against
[1:21:48] the darkness of the age we're living in
[1:21:50] I love what program says he said
[1:21:52] remember when this full Bible has been
[1:21:55] thoroughly Vindicated then there will be
[1:21:57] an eternal Shalom an eternal peace amen
[1:22:00] there's one more word to be Vindicated
[1:22:02] he's got to vindicate more word and when
[1:22:04] the last word is Vindicated amen then
[1:22:07] death is swallowed up in Victory and the
[1:22:10] dead in Christ shall rise and the
[1:22:12] Millennium will set in and it'll be one
[1:22:14] great peace one great Shalom among
[1:22:16] friends amen living dying oh God Amen
[1:22:20] birth live and dine buried rise and
[1:22:22] coming was all according to the
[1:22:24] scripture then the same word that
[1:22:26] brought him to life was the same word
[1:22:28] that took him in the grave was the same
[1:22:30] word that raised him on the third day
[1:22:32] it's the same word that he ascended On
[1:22:34] High by that's the same word that saves
[1:22:37] your soul that's the same word that
[1:22:38] redeems your soul that's the same word
[1:22:40] that healed your body and that is the
[1:22:42] same word that'll cause all the
[1:22:44] deformities to fade away will cause all
[1:22:46] the sin to go back to the hell that come
[1:22:49] out of her and will cause an eternal
[1:22:50] Shalom when King Jesus king peace comes
[1:22:54] upon the Earth
[1:22:55] well somebody shout Glory I know it's
[1:22:58] wasting out but I feel good that's
[1:23:00] coming to the end of this wickedness
[1:23:01] there's coming to the end of this world
[1:23:03] that's coming into this chaos and
[1:23:05] confusion I'm on Church you're in
[1:23:07] position to see the Millennium by the
[1:23:09] word
[1:23:12] the word
[1:23:13] oh God the same word with Amos has saved
[1:23:16] you the same word that redeems you the
[1:23:19] same word will call you from the grave
[1:23:20] and if you go by the way the grave the
[1:23:22] same word
[1:23:23] can I preach to a minute that same word
[1:23:27] will change your body
[1:23:29] that same word will bring Abraham and
[1:23:32] Sarah out of the ground are you hear me
[1:23:34] brother brother Kevin the first man to
[1:23:36] ever die named Abel this word will call
[1:23:39] Abel out of the ground and he will not
[1:23:41] be in a corruptable body he will be in
[1:23:43] an incorptable body
[1:23:47] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:23:49] about the word I'm talking about the
[1:23:51] word of life I'm not talking about a
[1:23:52] dead letter I'm talking about something
[1:23:54] that has become the expression it has
[1:23:57] become the explanation of the things of
[1:23:58] God look what David says here in Psalms
[1:24:00] 119 I love Psalms 119. it's a powerful
[1:24:03] chapter concerning the word let me pull
[1:24:05] a few things out here to you in Psalms 1
[1:24:07] 1989 David says forever O Lord Thy word
[1:24:11] is settled in heaven in verse 105 he
[1:24:14] says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[1:24:18] I lied into my path in a wicked in a
[1:24:21] perverse in a crooked Nation Thy word is
[1:24:24] a lamp unto my feet and I lied into my
[1:24:26] path look in verse 140 Thy word is very
[1:24:29] pure therefore thy servant loveth it
[1:24:32] look in 1 160 Thy word is true from the
[1:24:35] beginning and every one of thy righteous
[1:24:37] judgments endureth forever then what did
[1:24:40] Jesus be expressed image of God the
[1:24:43] logos of God the concept of God what did
[1:24:46] he say when he come on the Earth he said
[1:24:48] he had a little while yes the lot with
[1:24:49] you but walk while you have lot less
[1:24:52] Darkness come upon you for he that
[1:24:54] walketh in darkness so if not whether he
[1:24:56] goeth while you have the light believe
[1:24:58] in the light that you may be Children of
[1:25:00] the lies these things speak Jesus and
[1:25:02] departed and did hide himself from them
[1:25:04] remember said see when you get the Holy
[1:25:06] Ghost your god-centered God's daughter
[1:25:09] that's true enough but if you don't obey

[1:33:19] our way to Victory come on friends we
[1:33:21] are not on our way to tribulation we are
[1:33:24] on our way to rapture we are the
[1:33:26] children of light and the children of
[1:33:28] day we are not of the night Lord
[1:33:29] Darkness therefore let us not sleep come
[1:33:33] on now let us not sleep as do others but
[1:33:36] let us watch and be sober you know what
[1:33:38] that word sleep means relaimus it means
[1:33:40] to yield to sloth and to sin it means to
[1:33:43] be indifferent to one's salvation upon
[1:33:45] the God said look he said we're living
[1:33:47] in the day we're promised for this day
[1:33:49] where are we we've moved on up the
[1:33:51] pillar of fire moves and the children of
[1:33:52] Israel mood with the pillar of fire or
[1:33:54] they went back to Egypt we have got to
[1:33:56] move with the word
[1:33:58] come on now we've got to move with the
[1:34:01] word
[1:34:03] can I say what he said
[1:34:06] and today we're getting so slothful
[1:34:10] the church he said is getting so early
[1:34:13] and so indifferent and their minds so
[1:34:16] muddled up with the television and we
[1:34:17] love sushi and some of these old things
[1:34:19] and staying home
[1:34:23] I guess right here on the end the van
[1:34:25] just comes out
[1:34:27] staying home
[1:34:29] they shows where the people's heart are
[1:34:31] you can tell them these things are wrong
[1:34:34] and they think you're crazy what is it
[1:34:36] Lover's a pleasure
[1:34:38] more than lovers of God but I I thank
[1:34:41] God we're following a prophet but the
[1:34:43] greatest pleasure I know of is to pray
[1:34:46] until I can realize that I'm in the
[1:34:48] presence of God and recognize it I think
[1:34:51] that ought to be the thrill of the
[1:34:52] church he said is the presence of the
[1:34:55] Holy Spirit seeing the God who made the
[1:34:58] promise standing Among Us fill his
[1:35:01] presence see his word see it Vindicated
[1:35:04] in ought to give Faith to make cripples
[1:35:06] walk blind sea death here and the dumb
[1:35:10] to speak
[1:35:12] we are not the children of Darkness
[1:35:15] we are not the children of a crooked
[1:35:18] Nation
[1:35:18] a spiritually perverse generation
[1:35:22] but God
[1:35:23] has come into our flesh
[1:35:25] by the new birth
[1:35:27] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:30] in this wicked adulterous generation
[1:35:33] there is a people on the Earth who is
[1:35:36] holding forth the word of life
[1:35:39] you know if that word holding forth
[1:35:40] means I didn't even get to it but y'all
[1:35:43] give me Grace
[1:35:44] it means to take heed to
[1:35:46] you it means to pay attention to
[1:35:48] something
[1:35:49] it means to turn oneself to something
[1:35:51] and give full attention to it
[1:35:55] in other words there's a people who's
[1:35:57] going to give full attention brother
[1:35:59] Terry
[1:36:00] to the concept of God
[1:36:02] to the Divine commentary to the perfect
[1:36:04] interpretation you say brother what are
[1:36:06] you getting at I'm saying we are not
[1:36:08] walking an artificial light
[1:36:11] we are not walking in man-made light we
[1:36:15] are walking in the light of Jesus Christ
[1:36:16] remember he said see give yourself holy
[1:36:18] to this at every place we go we see
[1:36:20] Jesus he is now listen to this what a
[1:36:23] glorious thing it is for his church
[1:36:24] after 1900 years of almost 2 000 years
[1:36:27] ago to know that he lives we meet him on
[1:36:30] every Bend of the road and every turn at
[1:36:32] every place we go we see Jesus we see
[1:36:35] his presence flowing like a radiant
[1:36:37] light from his glorious Church the
[1:36:39] Living God how thankful we should be for
[1:36:41] that nowadays he says notice this he
[1:36:44] said the message given at the Tomb come
[1:36:46] see go tell first thing come and they'll
[1:36:48] be convinced nowadays people don't want
[1:36:50] to come and see those who do come can't
[1:36:52] sit 10 minutes five minutes sometimes
[1:36:54] and if you cross up their path they're
[1:36:55] gone come see don't just Peep in stand
[1:36:58] and look over it don't just peep into it
[1:37:01] stand and look over it because if you

[1:37:08] hearing me
[1:37:09] you will never
[1:37:12] you will never
[1:37:13] Wonder again
[1:37:16] if you ever see
[1:37:18] that Jesus
[1:37:19] is a revelation of God
[1:37:22] it'll put you in position
[1:37:24] to become the Revelation yourself
[1:37:27] when you've seen God
[1:37:30] you've seen Jesus and when you've seen
[1:37:32] this bride

[1:37:59] sister Alice said they sit on the
[1:38:00] hillside

[1:38:06] not hidden behind the mountain not
[1:38:08] putting the closet but been set up on
[1:38:11] the hillside
[1:38:12] that all the world can see
[1:38:14] I was listening this morning brother
[1:38:15] Kevin to a tape the product I was
[1:38:17] preaching on let your light so shine
[1:38:20] he said see it's like this he said it's
[1:38:21] like you're driving down the road and he
[1:38:23] said you see a big old billboard
[1:38:25] and he said it's got a big old sizzling
[1:38:27] steak on it
[1:38:28] he said you see that and he said at the
[1:38:31] bottom of it it says you're hungry
[1:38:33] he says what happens is he said that is
[1:38:35] the attraction that got your attention
[1:38:37] he said that attraction pulled to the
[1:38:39] restaurant he said now most times now
[1:38:41] you get in there and he said what was on
[1:38:43] the Billboards not on the table
[1:38:47] are you here what's on the Billboards
[1:38:49] not on the table are you with me that's

[1:39:05] big old juicy steak again and this
[1:39:07] little fan something you see what it is
[1:39:09] what Drew you there was a false
[1:39:11] advertisement
[1:39:13] then when you got there there wasn't
[1:39:14] nothing to keep you there
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:18] the prophet of God was not making a
[1:39:19] mistake with what he was saying
[1:39:21] he was saying Christianity advertised
[1:39:24] today is not the gospel
[1:39:27] they'll hang across up there
[1:39:29] they'll put a picture of Jesus Christ on
[1:39:31] the billboard and they'll draw somebody
[1:39:33] in the building when they get in there
[1:39:34] you know what they'll find they'll find
[1:39:35] popcorn and coffee stands and ball games
[1:39:37] and movie Nights
[1:39:40] and they're literally thinking well I
[1:39:42] got all this at home
[1:39:45] remember said about the gospel
[1:39:48] ought to be priests in such a way
[1:39:50] he said that it appeals to the hungry
[1:39:53] he said the gospel ought to be priests
[1:39:55] and so it's a way he said that it
[1:39:56] appeals to Salvation of Jesus Christ I
[1:39:59] love this quote he says it like this he
[1:40:01] says now notice he said preach the
[1:40:03] gospel that raises Christ up in a living
[1:40:07] atmosphere right here around us now
[1:40:12] foreign
[1:40:14] [Applause]
[1:40:16] until it raises Christ
