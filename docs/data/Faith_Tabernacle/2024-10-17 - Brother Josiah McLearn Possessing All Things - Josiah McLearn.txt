something said tonight can be of a blessing um a bit nervous uh brother sea didn't ask me till uh Sunday um it's happy preaching nor we have a little bit more of a warning so might be short and sweet but if y'all if y'all will will will will amen fast all preach fast and we'll be done fast amen but in uh Romans chapter 10:8 um and uh before before we read Let's uh bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you father and oh Lord how thankful we are father to be in your presence once again Lord father we ask you Lord just to just to just to help us Lord this this this this this evening father Lord as we as we bring forth your word Lord we ask you father just to help me help me lay myself aside father Lord just speak through me Lord Jesus and touch your people father we pray we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Romans 10: 8 amen says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth on onto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and then in Hebrews chapter 3:1 amen Hebrews chapter 3:1 says wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the consider the Apostle and high and high priest of our confession Christ Jesus amen y'all can y'all can have your seats um I wanted to to preach for a little bit tonight um the Lord willing on possessing all things um and and a and also about about the the confession of our mouth for just for just a few minutes but I I was looking at this word con confession and the definition of it is is that to Ascent that is covenant acknowledged or or profess confession is made give thanks unto promise it also means confess profess a promise to give thanks confession is made and acknowledge so in other words an agreement that a promise or or yeah it's an agreement that A promise is acknowledged a and the and the Bible says that uh that where where we just read that he is the high priest of of of of our of of our confession God and so but but but we also find that where brother bam has taught us many times where that God can't do nothing nothing with you until until first we confess that that that he is and that he is able to do it and then and then and then and then and then when he confess it then you believe it and act upon it and stay with it and God will bring you out Lord Brother brandom said said said brother bandam said and my brother sister it isn't how much graceful you can pray or how much or how much much Penance Penance or how much Penance you can do it's your faith to believe that that he's done it for you that brings that brings you forth that's right every sinner is saved tonight in the sight of Jehovah God but it'll never do you any good until you accept it and believe it and confess it and then he's the high priest of your confession to make it right be be be and he's the high priest of your confession to make it right before God and any Redemptive blessings if if if you're weary he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we're healed it's already done you just accept it amen and this is going to be really simple tonight so so you guys will have to have to have to have to bear with me but but so so a man so so so a man a man a man and any old sinner could he could come he could come up here he could come up he could come up here here here here to The Altar and he and he could pray all night he could cry he could beg he could plead he could walk walk up and down the floors he but he could sit there and SOB weep and and weep at the altar but until he has believed and he accepted he he he's he's still just a sinner Jesus Christ is the high priest of our confession in in other words our he's the high priest or he's the high priest of our profession but the translation of that is is the same word it's the high priest of our confession right and therefore he can't do nothing for us at all he he he he cannot heal us he cannot he cannot he cannot set us free he cannot he cannot save our souls he cannot he cannot deliver us or anything until until we confess that that that that and confess that he has already done it and and then he goes to work as as as our as our our our our our high priest PR and because the Bible says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised he was bruised for for for for for our our our iniquity the chastisement of our pieces upon him and brought his stripes we were healed not not not not not not that not that not that not that not that we will be or or or or that we ought we ought we ought we ought to to have been healed healed but but but when we were it was a past tense already healed God did it back there at Calvary already 2000 2000 2,000 years years ago but until you profess it and confess it that's it it it will do it it will it will do nothing nothing nothing no nothing nothing for you you have to to to to to to to confess it and and and and believe it so and um and uh we know that that Abraham had waited in faith for the promise of Isaac for 25 five five years it was day after day he would say you feel any different any different honey she said not today and and the next thing he'd ask her you feel any different not today and he'd say praise God we're going to have that baby anyways why why why why why because God or because because because Abraham through faith claimed he he he claim that that that that that that promise and he confessed it daily that that he would have that child and and and so we find that um Abraham and lot had they had separated them themselves when when um Abraham was called out lot lot lot lot lot lot lot went with him he toward toward toward where they were they were searching for a city whose Builder maker was God but but we find that that further on down Abraham God told Abraham to separate himself himself from from from from lot to to where to where God God um God caused a a an argument to break out to break out with the herdsman and and towards where they had to ser themselves but but but but he finally got the place but the were because Abraham realized that that that that that that that that that inheritance that that wherever that his feet will walk is it was was was his inheritance so so he was no longer looking at at at where he was at at um um um o on the day-to-day day-to-day basis he was looking at he was looking at at at that Eternal at that Eternal City whose Builder and maker was God and and and so so so when they separated themselves Abra um lot lot took lot took that that Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham and Abraham took the desert right so so so so so but we find that before Abraham could ever obtain the promise of Isaac he had they had to separate themselves but but but yet but but but yet but yet but yet he continually he continually um confess that that that promise on a on a daily basis I will have have a son wake up the next morning I will have a son and he woke up the next morning said I will have a son son and and and and and yet and and brother R said said he he said he so T night we may not be rich in this world's Goods but we possess all things the church itself possesses all things yet poor yet or yet poor yet rich and possess all things I like that he said here we are that old song we used to sing we used to sing years ago my father is and and with houses and lands he holdeth the wealth of the world in his hands rubies and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full he has riches Untold and and we are a possessor of it because we are a child of the king amen the child always falls there we know all right he say he he he said Abraham could could could lay could lay a hold of it on it yet poor his cattle was starving and yet lot took the best ground his water was short hot days and the herdsman had had had been had had been in trouble and and everything looked like was gone wrong and yet he owned the whole thing and and in another place he um he he says Abraham could possess could could could possess that land because because and and he could possess that land of what was on it God had given it had given it had give it to had give it to him and lot was a part of that land so Abraham had a right had a right had a right to it he could call he could call or lay or or or lay or lay or lay hold on it he said now God you may you made me you made me this this this this promise that what was this land and all that and all in it was mine and you made the promise he he he he he he said he said now My Kinsman My Kinsman ha ha My Kinsman has been taken and all he's got and all he's got is gone and another words he he said if I if if I would apply it today I'd say the church the the church could say Lord God here's my brother he's laying here stricken with cancer he's got to he he he's stricken with with with with with with with tuberculosis he's got so and so and I lay a hold I lay hold of the promise it's my possession you told me so amen there you are then you can go after the enemy that devil and Slaughter it just the same as Abraham slaughtered slaughtered the Kings and brought back and brought back his his his his his and brought back his possession amen I like that it's to the believer so so so now we can look at and see and and see and see and and in order for Abraham in order for him to go to to go against I I believe it was uh seven Kings I think it was and in order for Abraham in order for Abraham in order for Abraham hamam to to to do this he had to lay his faith upon the upon the promise of God he had to lay lay his faith upon that solid rock rock Foundation of God's word and God's promises see see see now we can notice though that Abraham he he didn't have an army with him he he he was a herdsman and he probably had some Ranchers with him some some some um sheep herters some um cattle some some some some cattle some some cattle harders and and and and and handsome servants he he he he he he he he didn't he didn't have an army he and and and and brother brandom said this said that he he only had about a dozen men and but but but but we notice now that even though that that that even though all the opposition was against him all the pressure was on him and and and yet it seemed like it seemed like when it was an impossible task task he he he said this is my possession this is my my inheritance and and he and and he stood up and he claimed went he went and claimed it and and claimed what what was right what was rightfully his why because because because because he stood fast fast upon faith and and and and Abraham he he wasn't looking at at the at the couple of men he had he wasn't looking at at the maybe there was thousands and thousands of men against him he he wasn't looking at that he was looking at the promise of what God had had promised that's a wherever The Souls of your feet shall shall shall shall tread upon that I have given unto you why it's not it's not up to it's not up to it it wasn't up to him it's not up to me it's not up to you it's it's up to God and it depends on the faith of what God said it's mine and I'm going after it of what belongs of what belongs of what belongs to me a amen and so we look at we look at at at the word at the word confession it's repeating of what God has already said when he said that that that that you are delivered you are sealed you are filled with the Holy Ghost and and and we can stand in that promise in all confidence say and say I am delivered I am sealed I am set free I am an air of of of of all things I am I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I am the part of the body of Christ because it's just repeating what he has already said about us right so now it's time that where where where we can get where where where we can stand up in all confidence and in all assurance and get mad at the Devil a little bit and confess what God has already said about him that he is a defeated enemy he was defeated at Calvary 2000 2,000 years year years ago we are fighting a defeated Enemy enemy we're accepting what has already been been been done been done for us in these what what has already been done for us for us two two two 2000 2,000 2,000 ye years ago we when God said I am healed I am sealed I am a child of God whose report are we going to going to believe are we going to believe the doctor the doctor's report when he said there's just no way when he said that arthritis is going to is going to eat you up eat you up the the the the the the rest of your life or or or or or or or or whatever problem that that that that whatever problem that you may have or or if your child has gone astray or or or or or or or whatever the the situation may may may may be are we going to believe that report or are we going to to believe the report of the Lord why CU we have our our faith is resting upon the Eternal Promises of God and and and they and they and there Abraham had marched had had had had gather had gathered his couple of men around him and marched forward and took back and took back and took back what was his why because he L his faith resting upon the Eternal Promises of God brother bandam said and when you come forth to be to be prayed for if you want a Salvation if you want a Divine a Divi a if you want Divine Healing no matter what it is if you are a Believer you an heir of every promise so lay your faith upon the promise and March forward and tell Satan give it back give it back it's mine don't let him Bluff you stand right there right there stand right there stand right there on the line and he'll give it back God said he would so he has he has he he has to do it that's it that's your Authority that's right air of all things and in in uh in uh Deuteronomy chapter 2 and and verse three it says ye have Compass this mountain long enough turn ye northward and so and and and so those children of Israel if you look back at that at that they they they circle around year after year after year for for 40 years all because they disbelieved one one one word of God and and and yet and and and yet and yet Joshua and Caleb had brought back the evidence God God had said had said and and go Joshua and Caleb had brought forth the evidence with with the grapes the the the bushel of grapes on the staff and and and they had brought back a good report uh to saying saying that that that the land surely floweth floweth with the milk with with with milk and honey it is everything that God had promised and more it is it is the land that that Abraham had tread upon why could it it is it is our inheritance and and yet those those those those other spies came back and they brought the evil report and said and said there's Giants in the land and there's and and and and and and there's there's wal cities and and we look as grasshoppers as grasshoppers as grasshoppers in the site and Joshua stood up amongst the people and said and said we are more than able why why why because Joshua Joshua Joshua was not looking at the opposition he he was not looking at the Giants he was not looking at looking at the wall cities he was looking at the promis he was looking at the promises of God God God and he said we are more than able to to to to to go forth and take the country God had given them had given them that that that that that promise that that that whatsoever your your your feet shall shall shall shall shall tread upon that is your inheritance and Joshua was standing upon that upon that promise standing in all confidence and in all Assurance knowing knowing that he was more than able to take it but but but but but but the rest of the children they they begin to doubt and they begin they begin to question God and because that God had made them circle around that mountain year in and year out and year in and year out and year in and year out and it was the same old habits it was the same old it was the same old problems that they had it was the same old it was the same old trial that they kept they kept tripping over the same log BBE and they kept and they kept circling round and round so God finally said you have circled this mountain long enough and and and I can and we can stand here we can stand here here here here tonight and all confidence and all Assurance when we had a prophet go forth and tell us and tell us exactly and tell us exactly what what what what was in that in that in in what was in that Promised Land we can stand here as a bride of Christ and we can sit there and claim every s every single promise and we can see that it is surely a land flowing with milk and honey and if we ever have any questions about about whether it's true or or or or or or if I'm if we're doing the right thing or or for wondering about this all we have to do is reach out and grab and grab and grab some of that fruit uh and some of that fruit and start eating on it and realize that God's promises are are true we we can realize that that whatsoever God said it is ours it is our inheritance it is the children's bread and so so so we could we can stand there like Caleb in all confidence and all assurance and say give me my Mountain it is it is mine God God God had has has God has has has given it has given it on on onto me give me my Mountain just just like what Joshua did for the children of Israel the word Joshua means Savior and the and that's the same thing that Jesus had done for us on Calvary when the when the when they when when they killed him he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and he rose up again with with the evidence with with the evidence of the baptism of the baptism the baptism of of the Holy Ghost that there is a land beyond the river and that they call the sweet forever and and he come back and brought us brought us us us us he came back and brought us and and and and and and evidence and and we and we as the bride of Christ can stand here tonight and say I am an heir of Divine Healing I am an heir of Joy I've got a right I have got a right a right a right I have got a right to be happy so so so so so so so people ask us why are you so happy he said it said I've got a right to be well well because why because because because because because we are an heir to it we are an heir to peace we are an heir to Joy we are an air to to eternal life we are an heir to to the Holy Spirit he said I've got an heir I I I am an heir to every evidence every evidence that that that that that that that that that that that Joshua has brought back back back back that Joshua has brought back back back to us when he brought back that staff full of grapes and we are we are an heir to every evidence we are an heir to every word that that that that has been spoken forth to us why who made us that it's not us it's it's it's not in ourselves it's not what we've done but it's what God has done for us on Calvary we are an heir to the throne of God he that overcometh shall set with me on my set with me on on my Throne as I have as I have have as I have overcome and set my on my father's Throne amen we're an air of all things not just one thing all things everything is under your feet you know I find it comical how people they they they can they it's it's it's easy for everyone to accept accept accept s salvation it it it it it seems like you got got the Baptist you got the the Pentecostals the Methodist pres all the all all all all these all of these all of these denominational people they can all they can all sit there and say I've have accepted salvation through Jesus Christ right but but but but but yet but yet but yet this this the the same the the very same attributes that Christ died for us for for us on Calvary for our for for our our Salvation is the same attributes that that he died that he died for for for for for for are our healing it's the same attributes that says you can't overcome all things it's the same attributes be be head said you can have joy you can have peace you can overcome you can you can overcome the devil you can live a a a Victorious life but but but but yet it's the same attributes that says that says I am saved is the same attributes that that that that carries us the rest of the way brother bam said said said when we've entered that Battlegrounds we between death and life it says I'm a sinner I'm a sinner I'm a sinner brother bom you don't you don't have to be you're a sinner because you desire and and he he he said you don't have to be the debts already paid brother random I wish I had Joy you can have it you're just letting Satan rob you rob you rob you rob you from the Privileges that Christ had I'm an air to it it's all mine everything he died for belongs be it belong it belongs it belongs to me it belongs to you we're his children we're Heirs of it everything that that everything that he died for so we can look at um so many different examples examples in the Bible you can look at you know you can look at you can look at Moses where where when when when he was just a stick he he leted out the children of of of of Israel we we we we've we've looked at Abraham a little bit you can look at Noah when when when when when when when when when when he was saved to the flood all because all because all because all because he he believed God you can look at you can look at David when he went when when when when when he when he took God's promis and he slayed the children of isra or not sorry he slayed the the um um Goliath and he became the king you you can look at you can look at all these examples all these examples through through throughout the Bible when when they stood there upon God upon upon upon upon upon go God God's word and yet they didn't have they did not have the fulfillment of the of of of of the promise they all they seen was the shadows and types and and and types of what was to come but yet but yet you know one guy that that that that that we can look at at at tonight is would would be shamgar he he he was just a ordinary man he was just a farmer and year in and year out those Philistines would come and he'd raise up a crop just enough to enough to feed his family and pay his bills and the Philistines would come and take it all and just enough leave just enough for for for him to barely live the next year and this happened year in and year out and maybe and maybe maybe one year shamgar shamgar had had had had had had had had just maybe he just he had just he had just harvested his crop and said and said this year we're going to be okay we're going to make it and the and the next thing you know you heard this you you and in the distance maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe he heard a bugle play and and next thing you know a trump Trump trump and up the road he he he can see him all these all those all those swords and the spears sticking up everywhere and those and those Shields and you heard it Trump Trump trump and and and maybe a fear just began to to to come a hold of him again and said not again lord I can't survive another year this and maybe he looked over at his wife and his wife was was half starved and and he looked at his children and his children were half starved and they were like how in the world are we going to survive to to to to survive the the the the the the the winner and and yet you came closer he was just like a Trump trump Trump trump all the way up and all the way up to where to where to where to where where maybe was just about to he was just about to overcome him but then it but then but then he got to thinking about it and said and said I am a circumcised child of God these are these uncircumcised these are the uncircumcised Philistines and Joshua promised me promised me back a long time time time time ago that that if I will stay in my land and if I will serve serve God then nothing can stand before me all my days and and yet maybe as that as that troop of soldiers was marching was Marching In in his yard he began to look around for a weapon to fight with and and yet and yet he had no sword he didn't have time to go to Walmart and buy a sword and and get a book on on on sword fighting for dummies he didn't have time time he he didn't have have have time have time for any of that he grabbed something that he was familiar with he grabbed he grabbed an ox code and and if us today can get something that we are familiar with without the bride of Christ when we can take a hold of this word and and yet and yet and yet shamgar grabbed that Ox code and be to he began to fight he began to swing at left and he began to swing at right and and before you know it he had slew all six all six hund hund hund hund of of those uncircumcised Philistines why because he stood in all confidence and in all Assurance knowing knowing KN knowing just just exactly who he was he said I am a circumcised size size size size child of the Living God and who are these uncircumcised sized size these uncircumcised Philistines that's that that's coming up against me why he be why why why why he he he stood upon the word of God and all confidence and in all Assurance he possessed what was his why and when Satan when Satan when Satan will will will come up against us us us us us us us us when Satan comes up when Satan comes up up against us like a flood we have nothing to turn to we have nothing to do the doctors can long can can can can can can can can can can can no longer help when it seems like our child has just gone astray and there's nothing and there's nothing else and there's nothing else to do when it seems like all were having is vehicle problems left and right and the bank's calling and wondering where their money's at and and and and maybe your accounts overdraft and you and your and your and your and you're and you're laid on rent yeah you can stand in all confidence and in all Assurance knowing just who just who just who who who who God is why why because I've seen him do it Time After Time After Time when me and my wife had first got had had had we had we had just got married I was working three jobs at the time and and Mindy had had come to me it was the night it was the night before the first and she said just I we $400 doll short short on rent and I was panicking I didn't know what to do I was working from I'd get up at at 5: and I'd go to work and I'd and and I I I work I would work I I would work three jobs I would I wouldn't get home till 10:30 at night I could not I couldn't physically do anymore God had got put push myself pushed myself to the limits we woke up the next morning and $400 was deposited in the account we still don't know what happened we have no idea how it got there God had come on the scene and we p and we paid all and and he moved in such a mighty spiritual way why because I've seen it I've seen it Time After Time After Time why because God looks after after after God looks after God looks after after after after he is own just just just just the other day actually this is this is like well it's about four or five months ago now I we we had we were supposed to I was supposed to do this job and you know I'm a contractor now and I've I've got I've got I've got um three guys that that I'm responsible for all the time and the my supper had had told me that that my sighing would be here we were starting a siding job and they told me that when you order it it'll be it'll be here within a week so week before we supposed to shop the job I went to order it and they said 6 months and I'm going what do I do because now all of a sudden I had lined out these jobs for the next four or five months and I didn't know what to do and I had just paid out 15 grand for all the siding so all my money was depleted because I just I just sourced out all my money to the siding and yet they now they're telling me it's going to be a six-month weight well I didn't know what to do because now all of a sudden I'm responsible for two guys I not only have to pay my rent I have to pay their rent too so now I'm going what do I do Lord and I literally I had I had $40 I had $40 left left in my account and I didn't know what I was going to do I I put that $40 in my tank of fuel cuz I was like this is going to last me this is going to last me a couple more days I don't know what else to do and a lady I had I I prayed about I said Lord you got to help me out I don't know what to do a lady I had quoted a job for two years prior called me that day and she accepted my quote and wanted me to start on it immediately now you cannot tell me that a God who who who sees every situation and sees every hurt that we're going through does not care about us in every little tiny tiny faucet of our life well I didn't know what else to do I I told my guys I said we might have to take off I might have to let y'all go cuz I didn't know what to do cuz I cuz cuz cuz I had no more money to sat there and dump into this into another job she called me and accepted it and paid me a deposit that afternoon and we went and we went and and and and and and done the job why because God looks looks after looks after those those th those those those God looks after God looks after he his bride brother B said said said said now now everyone that has those same senses would know the same thing he said now what is faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not the things of things you do not see taste feel smell or hear but but it's just as real as the sense of feeling or seeing is you know what I mean he said he said he said he how many here how many here he he how many here with good sight says says says that I I got I got on that I got on a white shirt he says he says he says H how how how many how how many how how how many believes that he said he you believe that it's white shirt he said what if I told you it was red would you believe it no sir you'd say that that that that shirt was white now how many believes how many believes in in divine and divine and divine and Divine Healing how many believe that Christ he healed you back through 19 190000 1900 100 years ago when he died for you if you believe that if your faith declares that then you're healed right now just as much as the sense a sense of sight says that that's white it's over there is see it's a reality it's not just a myth it's something it's not something it's not something it's not something imagine it's actually you know it there is no doubt nowhere it's all wiped out it's gone amen so so so so so now see can see that Faith goes beyond all our five senses that taste feel uh smell hear and see they declare to you your senses declare to you what is happening what is what is happening around you your sins but but yet but yet even though with these senses that that God has given us these senses can fail us sometimes you can be pretty sure that you see something I don't know if uh any of y'all have um have have have have ever have if you you all have have have ever hunted but you you s you sat there in your tree stand and you see something move and you're you're pretty sure that's a deer and yet and and then you hear something that's that's that's that walks across the leaves and you're pretty sure that you're hearing a deer you know and so you get all excited you might grab your gone and and get ready cuz you know it's a deer and two minutes later a scroll steps out why because because because because because because because you're pretty sure that that that's what seen but yet your senses can can fail you how many times have you men H have you men men have have your men W walked in the house after a long day of work and you smell something you say that smells like fried chicken and he walk in the kitchen and his meatloaf why because because your senses it can fail you even though you might be 100% sure that that's what it is it can still fail you but yet but but yet when but but but yet when you see something that's 100% sure just as sure as my shirt's white white why why why why here tonight and yet and yet you through faith can step out and and you and you and you see that the same attributes that Christ died for 2,000 years ago is the same as as salvation is the same as as as as as as as your as you're healing tonight it's the same is the same senses the same attributes that says that and says by my strife I am healed yet are that ye were that ye were that ye were that ye were healed why why and you can you can you can set set there set there and watch and watch your healing your healing take place watch watch watch your deliverance take place we may not have need a need of healing tonight you may not have a need or or you you you you may not have a need for healing tonight but you may have a need to overcome you may need a Deliverance you may need a family member that needs salvation you may have financial problems but Faith declares that it's over faith says 2,000 years ago Christ died on on Calvary and we are right now we are hirs and we are joint heirs with we are joint HS with Christ we can sign the check and take it to the bank why in all confidence and in all Assurance knowing that that Christ will fulfill every promise fulfill every promise that he has spoken faith is an individ idual sense besides be be be be besides besides anything else brother Bown called it a sixth sense that's the outside man and God put him him and and and and and and when when when when when God when God created man and put put him in in a human flesh here and and he he given us these five senses to contact to contact our our our our our our home but but yet the Inside Man the Spirit has two senses and and that is unbelief and it's faith and and and when your faith says that you're going to be healed the same the same as you site says that I have on a white suit or a white shirt and a and a blue suit on it's over for faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things that you do not see taste feel smell or hear why why yeah we cannot accept our healing we cannot accept our Salvation or or or or the Deliverance until until until until we believe that and and you've got and you've got to believe on it and you got to stand on that on that promise and and take God and take God at his word at his word at his word at his word before before before before it lack it can't happen until you first believe it accept it and confess it right and brother random said said he he he said take a woman he said come here come to the altar here or a man and and let them be ever so vile that they could scream and cry and walk up and down the altar saying God forgive me forgive me forgive me day in and day out and they just keep on pacing Lord I've repented I've done everything I can do he he said they'll keep pacing pacing until the hour when in their hearts they believe it and and and then confess it and when they confess it he go he he he goes he goes he goes he goes he goes to work on it and he cannot intercede for you until first you confess that it is already done by faith for he is the high priest of your confession and and and and so we we can we can see that that that the same that the same six sense of faith has has has has has um the same the same the same the same the same six sense Kingdom has kingdoms kingdoms kingdoms has kingdoms has crumbled the same six sense the Red Sea has pushed back and dry ground was made away was made away for the children of of of of Israel the same the same the same six sense Samson to fight a thousand a thousand Philistines and and and and and and and with a Jawbone of a mule he he he he he he he he killed a thousand of them with by this six sense the dead has has been raised by this six six sense do these Mighty Miracles have we we've seen we've seen these Mighty Miracles perform Med it's the most powerful force that's ever had has ever that has ever hit H hit hit hit the earth faith is it it's a super sense to where to where regardless regardless regardless of the situation situation that that that that that that that that that you're in God God that that little piece of faith is resting in your hearts knowing that God Will Make A Way why why why why if your five senses of your body fail you where where where where you can't see your way out of it you can't you can't do nothing about it where the doctor has said has given up all hope where you see no way where where where anyway any way around the situation watch God watch God watch God come on the scene and move in such a mighty in such such a mighty way it was that six sense where where where where where when Daniel was was was was was was thrown in the Lion's day and that those that those lions that the those Lions those Lions didn't eat him it was a six sense when the three Hebrew children was was was thrown into and into into the fiery into the fiery furnace it was a six sense when when all reasonings and all and and by by by human conception and and by Human by Human by Human by Human by human intellect those the those three they they they they should have been burned have have been burned to a crisp but but but yet that six sense had stayed had had that six sense stayed with them with them for hours and hours and and and and and and that Fourth Man had stayed in the fire with them it was that six sense when when the Apostle Peter was laying in jail and the next day and the next day and the next day they were they they was going they they was going it was going to be Adam but yet the Believers got together and they began to pray and Faith began to come on the scene and to to an angel brought brought him out of jail it was that six sense that that that that that that that wouldn't let that wouldn't let let let Peter let let let let Peter let Peter die on that shipwreck where he swam all that way to shore it was at six cense where where where where when he got when he got bit by that snake he shook off in the fire it was that it was that six cense that raised up Jesus Christ from from from the dead when he died and and and Rose and ascended and ascended unto the father and said ye are going to sit with me in my Throne why but but it's that faith that that rises up in in our hearts in our hearts when when the situation looks so hopeless it's that six sense that rises up and says I have got it under control prise the Lord why why why why when everything when everything looks hopeless and everything looks looks looks impossible it's time to cast down it's time to cast down your other five senses and the five senses of the Mind where with with your reasonings and and all those and your conscious memory and affection it's time to cast it all aside and you take that sense of faith that the faith that Jesus Christ Christ gives it's a six sense that says God keeps his word to where it made it made it made it made it made it made Abraham when he he was 100 years old and Sarah 90 it was that six cents that that made that made that made that made Abraham rise up and say I will have a son it was that six sense when God told him said said said go and killed your son and yet and yet he was he in faith went did it knowing that that that that that if he slew his son God was obligated to raise him back again why why because it was a six sense that that that that that that God gives the Believers he Hebrews 11:32 says and what more and what and what what shall I I I I say more for the time when fa me to tell of Gideon and of brck and of Samson and of JEA and and of David also and of Samuel and of the prophets who through faith s subdued the kingdoms brought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions Quin the violence of fire fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant Valiant Vali wax wax waxed Valiant fight turn turn to turn to flights the armies of the aliens woman received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not not accepting not accepting not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had Trials of cruel mockings and scoring gay more Bond bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder they were tempted they were they they were slain they they were slain with the sword they wander about in sheep skins and goats and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not was was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith Reed not not receed not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen if the musicians will come whose report are you going to believe when all hell is come against you when you're when you're sick in bed and and and you're so sick you can't even move when when the doctor when the doctor says says has given up all hope where when when when the situation is just impossible we we serve a God who makes who who makes the impossible probable when when when when we anchor our soul to what God has said not what the situation said we will see Miracles we will see see our Giants fall why because because because God has promised it and we have the faith when we have the faith to raise up and say I will possess all things amen ar ar ar aren't you thankful that that we serve a living God we serve a god a God who cares about all things we serve a god a miracle working God amen amen um just just a a a quick testimony I don't know if I've ever told it here or not but when Joanna was a baby she she was um I had got home from work we had we had moved
