[47:25] lengthy and we're going to start with
[47:27] verse
[47:37] one amen if you're there say
[47:40] Amen Psalms 118 verse1 it says oh give
[47:44] thanks unto the Lord for he is good
[47:47] because his mercy endureth forever let
[47:50] Israel now say that his mercy endureth
[47:52] forever let the house of Aaron now say
[47:55] that his mercy endureth forever
[47:57] let them now that fear the lord say that
[48:00] his mercy endureth forever I called upon
[48:03] the Lord in distress the Lord answered
[48:06] me and set me in a large place the Lord
[48:09] is on my side I will not fear what can
[48:12] man do unto me the lord taketh my part
[48:16] uh with them that help me therefore
[48:17] shall I see my desire upon them that
[48:19] hate me it is better to trust in the
[48:22] Lord than to put confidence in man it is
[48:25] better to trust in the Lord than to put
[48:27] confidence in princes All Nations
[48:29] compassed me about but in the name of
[48:31] the Lord will I destroy them they
[48:34] compassed me about yay they compassed me
[48:36] about but in the name of the Lord I will
[48:39] destroy them they compassed me about
[48:41] like bees they are quenched as the fire
[48:44] of thorns for in the name of the Lord I
[48:46] will destroy them they they thou Hast
[48:49] thrust sore at me that I might fall but
[48:51] the Lord help me the Lord is my strength
[48:54] and song and has become my salvation
[48:57] if we could go down to the 28th verse
[49:00] Thou Art my God and I will praise thee
[49:03] Thou Art my God I will exalt thee oh
[49:06] give thanks unto the Lord for he is good
[49:09] for his mercy endureth forever amen can
[49:12] we also turn to uh Psalms
[49:19] 20 amen his mercy endureth
[49:23] forever amen Psalms 20
[49:29] Psalms 20:7 says some trust in chariots
[49:33] and some in horses but we will remember
[49:36] the name of the Lord Our God they are
[49:39] brought down and Fallen we are risen and
[49:41] stand upright but we will remember the
[49:43] name of the Lord Our God Amen as we ask
[49:47] the Lord to bless the reading of the
[49:48] word you can be
[49:51] seated amen if I were to have a title
[49:55] tonight I I would would like to maybe
[49:57] title it we will remember the name of
[49:59] the
[50:02] Lord I this not really a New Year's
[50:06] message but I uh it was on my heart and
[50:09] I pray that it can be a blessing to you
[50:12] tonight um I want to take a minute and
[50:14] and lay a foundation so you would have
[50:16] to bear with me for just a few moments
[50:19] and hopefully it'll make sense in the
[50:21] End Amen but brother brandham says here
[50:24] he says now we are a part of God you
[50:26] always was you don't remember it because
[50:28] you were only an attribute in God you
[50:31] were only in his thinking your very name
[50:34] if it was ever on the book of life it
[50:36] was put there before the foundation of
[50:38] the world he knew what you were I'm not
[50:41] saying this to mix up Doctrine but to
[50:43] straighten it out that we might get away
[50:45] from this fear and scare you don't know
[50:47] who you are you you are not going to be
[50:50] but you are now the sons of God see you
[50:53] always were the sons of God see for when
[50:56] God had you in his thinking at the
[50:58] beginning you have to be some part of
[51:01] you your life that's in you now had to
[51:03] be with God before there well when he uh
[51:06] when he before he even became material
[51:09] here on Earth before there was anything
[51:12] but a God but God you were one of his
[51:15] attributes he knowed your name would be
[51:18] he know what your name would be he know
[51:20] the color of hair you would have he
[51:22] knowed All About You amen because you
[51:25] were in his mind before the foundation
[51:27] of the world Amen and brother brandham
[51:29] says if you have eternal life in you
[51:31] tonight then you always were a part of
[51:34] God even before the foundation of the
[51:36] world you were a part of God oh my that
[51:40] just that just gets me excited to know
[51:42] that I was in God's thinking way before
[51:45] there was even a molecule before there
[51:47] was even a star in the sky I was in
[51:50] God's mine oh my we were born Sinners
[51:53] and and there's nothing good about us we

[52:16] to be quickened a change had to take
[52:18] place amen we had to have an experience
[52:21] with God Amen like they did on Pentecost

[52:27] denominational experience but a true
[52:30] Pentecostal experience oh my Paul says

[52:36] 2 he says but God who is rich in Mercy
[52:40] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[52:43] even when we were dead in sins hath
[52:45] quickened us together with Christ by
[52:48] Grace you are saved and hath raised us

[53:55] him and found that he was a
[53:57] disappointment and that he was up to no
[53:59] good and and and that he was a mistake
[54:03] and yet there was something pulsating in
[54:06] his heart that something was different

[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] me amen aren't you glad to know that he
[1:30:08] is our
[1:30:10] refuge aen we've tasted it's not just
[1:30:14] something that we've
[1:30:16] learned uh with head knowledge but we
[1:30:19] have experienced him and we've tasted
[1:30:24] amen the power of his healing and we
[1:30:30] tasted his delivering power we tasted
[1:30:33] amen that that when when we go through
[1:30:38] things that God is present amen and we
[1:30:42] know what we're saying we know what
[1:30:44] we're singing about what we're preaching
[1:30:47] about because it's it's something that
[1:30:49] we've tasted we' tasted uh that Jesus as
[1:30:54] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:30:57] forever and uh I'm I'm so glad for that
[1:31:01] if uh you know
[1:31:04] it's God dwells in his word and the word
[1:31:08] came to us in this age amen and this why
[1:31:13] you know we believe that the message is
[1:31:15] Christ it's it's not just something we
[1:31:18] learning in church but it's something
[1:31:20] we're experiencing and that when we're
[1:31:23] taking him taking that word into our
[1:31:26] heart and we're believing it he is is
[1:31:31] he's coming on the scene for us and he's
[1:31:34] showing himself real and I'm I'm just so
[1:31:37] glad for that amen that we're not
[1:31:40] learning about a god of yesterday not
[1:31:43] just of a God that worked in brother
[1:31:45] branham's Ministry when he was here and
[1:31:48] but we're we're seeing that same God
[1:31:50] moving through his word and as we're
[1:31:52] eating the word as we're fellowshipping
[1:31:55] around that word amen Christ is becoming
[1:31:59] more known to us and I'm so glad for
[1:32:02] that I I think that's what the message
[1:32:04] is about it it brings us into a personal
[1:32:07] relationship with Jesus Christ that that
[1:32:11] we know him we really know him not not
[1:32:14] knowing him by our imagination of him of
[1:32:18] what we think he is not just fellowship
[1:32:21] with some spirit that we call God but
[1:32:24] we're we're actually seeing the Christ
[1:32:26] of this Bible made known to us and I'm
[1:32:30] I'm so glad for that and I think uh it
[1:32:34] just a wonderful message tonight and
[1:32:37] that we should take
[1:32:39] courage
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:42] amen take courage church amen as we
[1:32:47] heard that we don't know the what the
[1:32:48] New Year holds but I truly believe that
[1:32:52] this could be the last year
[1:32:54] that we live as Mortals on this Earth
[1:32:57] amen I truly believe that I and you know
[1:33:02] um thinking that you know the world
[1:33:05] celebrating the new year and then wake
[1:33:09] up and hearing about the tragedy that
[1:33:11] happened in uh Louisiana and uh just uh
[1:33:17] fear gripping the people and um the
[1:33:21] thing that happened in in uh Las Vegas
[1:33:24] today and just just a lot of things
[1:33:27] going on church and so no matter how
[1:33:31] much the people are celebrating trying
[1:33:33] to bring in a a millennium or trying to
[1:33:36] bring in a golden
[1:33:37] age it ain't going to work the Lord is
[1:33:40] our refuge amen and something that we
[1:33:44] can face the future with great hope
[1:33:48] great faith great encouragement and I'm
[1:33:51] so glad for that do you love the Lord
[1:33:54] amen and um I uh I thought of you know
[1:33:59] brother brandom talking about if you and
[1:34:03] and I'm sure maybe all of us have you
[1:34:06] know uh where they have that you know a
[1:34:08] picture and but you have to stare at
[1:34:11] that picture uh uh to really when you're
[1:34:15] just looking at it just seems like a
[1:34:17] conglomeration of stuff but you have to
[1:34:20] just stare at it and Zone in on it and
[1:34:23] when you Zone hone in on it you can
[1:34:25] actually see things in in that picture
[1:34:29] and um it's funny then you take your
[1:34:31] eyes away and you look at it again and
[1:34:33] you that's all you can see because you
[1:34:36] finally caught the object of what that
[1:34:38] picture was saying and uh brother
[1:34:41] brandom he had talked about that and you
[1:34:44] know he said that's that's the way
[1:34:46] Christ is himself the gospel sees said
[1:34:50] that's the message is when you once see
[1:34:53] the message of the hour there's nothing
[1:34:56] else that you can see but that that's
[1:34:58] all everything else is gone the rest of
[1:35:01] it is just fer when you see the message
[1:35:05] can you sayen and I'm so glad we see the
[1:35:08] message and not just a man bringing a
[1:35:11] message I'm so glad we see Christ in
[1:35:14] this message and that's all we can see
[1:35:17] amen I love the Lord and uh before we
[1:35:21] you know go um maybe we could just stand
[1:35:25] to our feet and um this may may seem a
[1:35:29] little odd and uh tonight but I'd like
[1:35:32] to do it uh and that is maybe we could
[1:35:36] all uh join
[1:35:38] hands uh together and let's just pray um
[1:35:43] you know for one another and um maybe we
[1:35:48] could just stop the music and maybe we
[1:35:50] could just just come over here and just
[1:35:52] join hands with one another and I um I I
[1:35:57] believe it's a an important hour church
[1:36:00] and we certainly need the Lord and uh
[1:36:03] we've got uh you know uh different ones
[1:36:06] that are facing battles in in sickness
