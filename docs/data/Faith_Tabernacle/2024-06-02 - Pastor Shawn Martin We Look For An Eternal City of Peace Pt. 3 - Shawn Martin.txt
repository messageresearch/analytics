will be ministering the wednes this coming Wednesday and then brother Josh Martin uh ministering on Sunday and um so we'll be certainly be keeping you all in our prayer and um I tell you what we're close to the coming of the Lord amen amen we want to do all that we can Amen to um serve the Lord and and serve in his kingdom amen before we go into the word may we just bow our heads our hearts and just talk to the Lord precious father what an honor it is to be able to speak to you without condemnation without any fear but Lord knowing that you have bit us to come and you've called us Justified us Lord and you've done a a work within us Lord where we can stand as your sons and daughters and Lord knowing that we have found favor in your eyes and and father it's not only our desire to meet with you but it's your desire to meet with us and oh God we're just asking now that you'd help me to get myself out of the way and use the gift that you placed within me Father take over lord and whatever you would want to say Lord may you be able to say it father I pray that you would help the people's hearts and ears Lord help them to hear here and to receive of you and Lord we be careful to give you all the praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen we um uh Hebrews the 13th chapter and um it says for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen you can have your seats this morning and and we certainly want to remember all those that are sick and uh not feeling well uh quite a few um and um brother Mark and Sister Crystal they're out of uh town uh visiting some her relatives and and they're not they're up in years and and not doing well and so we certainly want to keep um um them in our prayer but um um I want to continue along that the thought we look for a an eternal City uh of Peace amen I think that's all of our hearts as Christians Believers and uh you know we we Face many problems many trials in life and no doubt U uh you're facing challenges that you don't know what's going to happen and things like that but this morning if we could just get our eyes off of all of that and and just think of the promises that God has has given to us and we're so close to the coming of the Lord amen and brother brandham you know he said there's not another thing that I know to happen but the Rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's already and he said that years ago go and and so we were looking that uh the the the Rapture is imminent it it can happen just any moment and that's what we want to keep on our hearts is that this world is not our home it's it's just it's not for us to to be uh comfortable in uh God didn't make it that way uh brother raham says we ask the Lord for give us comfort and peace and and he says that God sends us the best thing he can give us and that's trials and tribulations and he said our comfort is is on the other side of the river and uh so that that's what we're looking for and and so this eternal uh city of Peace uh it's it's um it's it's not a fairy tale it's we we're not just mixed up people that are believing this and looking for this to come it is real and it is eternal and it's it's the same city that Abraham looked for uh uh and and you know uh he was so passionate about it he so believed in it that he actually looked for that City and uh uh uh and and every believer has been looking forward to that time uh of that City and and so it it's here in in this world that every nation every Kingdom every Monarch every government every dictate um that has come on the scene has given away uh to another at some point in time it it doesn't matter how powerful that Nation would be if it would be the world leader of that of its time and but but it's it's given away it's it's it's no more because uh another Nation would rise and then that Nation would fall and another one would rise and and then that would fall and here we are uh uh we become a super world or a superpow and the leader of the world and and but look where we're at we're falling and uh people don't want to believe that but we're a laughing stock uh to the world and and it ain't going to get any better um and it's just it's it's it's got to fall just as any Other Nation and and so uh uh it's it's this has been a continuous cycle uh since the beginning of time uh mankind uh is has just it's eat eaten up with death civilization has death in it as as the civilization we know of uh science uh has death in it education produces death uh technology produces death and and we'd even say religion produces death and and it's it's just death it's it's all under the law of of death and and and so uh as as we know uh the law of death Works in man and what he produces uh is death and everything about man everything about his achievements it's death and and the more man uh get smarter and educated and the more inventions he makes he's only speeding up the process of death uh man is becoming weaker uh uh not just in his mind but in his body in his his spiritual life everything is is just it's it's because it's he's under that law of death and and so the reason why we're looking for a city that is eternal and and it's a city uh that that that uh of peace is because uh God has promised it to us this is a promise and I know what we are believing um is so contrary to the world of of today uh because it's not proven by science it's not proven by education it's it's not proven uh by by even religion uh uh but yet we still believe it we believe it more today than we've ever had before and and because we're closer to the time of of of uh of of this this event and and so uh but but uh so it's a real challenge for a man to really really not just say it but really believe it that that there is a city and and of course if he really believes it he's going to lay aside everything and and look for that City every day you go to work but you're looking for a city and and and the world's getting Wicked but you're you're you're you're looking for a city The Trials come but you're looking for a city amen uh nothing aases you because you know there's a city and and it's by promise God promised it and and we're looking for that to come and anything that God has promised will come to pass so in Genesis 20 or Revelations 21 and 2 uh John said that he saw this city and and he said it was a holy city uh there is not no uh uh holy city uh I I know they call Rome and and the world calls Rome a holy city and all that but but this is what God would call Holy City and that's that City that John saw and he called it New Jerusalem ain't that right and he saw this city coming down from heaven showing that it has no tithes to this earth and and and it it it it's not connected with the Earth for Paul with say about this city uh in Hebrews 11:10 that uh uh the Builder and maker of this city is God Amen it's not made by man it's not some group of men uh that would come together and uh uh uh but this is is is uh uh a product of God's making ain't that right and so so this this the city New Jerusalem it settles as as it it descends and it settles upon the Earth amen and and brother Brandon with liken it as as when that the the the holy spirit of God descended in the form of a dove from heaven and he come down and he settled Upon Jesus and and and uh you you remember where John said you know I I saw the heavens open up and the Spirit uh liken unto a dove uh descending upon him well you know Jesus was part of the earth and and the Holy Spirit uh descended and settled up on on the earth and and it remained upon him forever ain't that right it it didn't take its flight it remained there amen because he was a predestinated uh uh vessel he was that that piece of Earth was was predestinated and and so the prophet said it can never leave him it's all always there for he and God are one and so it always has to remain ain't that right so this holy city uh New Jerusalem it descends down uh uh uh uh there and it re settles uh upon an Earth but but not just the Earth but a redeemed Earth Amen brother Bram would say it it's the the entire Earth is redeemed and this city comes to claim every attribute that he made the Earth for amen see and so and it will never pass away it's there to stay this is one city this is one government this is one uh uh reain Kingdom that will never ever uh end now uh Jerusalem of course means city of Peace amen and so this Eternal City it's a it's a city of peace and that that that should mean something to us amen uh because uh as we've talked before but peace means freedom from disturbance it it's a a state of Tranquility a a period in which there is no War uh or a war has ended it means a a treaty agreeing to a ceasefire between Waring States uh it is freedom from civil disorder uh freedom from dispute or dissension between individuals or groups uh peace means calm restfulness freedom from interference it means Harmony agreement uh reconciliation so think of that now when there's when the city comes down a city appe peace amen this is what we're looking for there's going not going to be no hostility there there's not going to be no interference there you can actually worship God Amen you you can you can serve God you can enjoy your life without no interference without no disruption uh no fear no anxiety no condemnation no disorder no uh confusion no war no turmoil no no no mind battles no enemy there there's nothing there it's a it's a city of Peace it's actually real peace can you say amen amen and and so uh uh what what we're looking for is just beyond reasoning uh because there has to be a change that it's not a continuation of this life it's it's not a continuation of our policies in in government it's not a continuation of of politics and democracy and there has to be a change in order for that City to come can you say Amen now that change can only work through the uh or or come through the work of redemption and that word Redemption means to bring back uh to its original condition amen so so if if if Redemption has to take place then then uh uh and it's going to bring everything back to its original condition then then God's got a a a uh uh something that we can look to to see what this city and and the condition and all these things are going to be like and so uh the Book of Genesis as we know is the SE chapter and because everything started there but in Genesis you know is where God created the Garden of Eden and and placed man in there there was no evil uh The Lion and the Wolf laid down together they fed together the lamb would lay uh beside them uh it was perfect peace the prophet said Perfect Harmony God had it under his control amen God had it under his control ain't that right and and the prophet says over it all he placed his beloved children his son his daughter a husband and wife to control it so we know that Genesis 1: 126 God made man and then he gave them Dominion uh uh over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle of uh of the field and and and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth up on the earth God gave man to be king of the earth ain't that right to rule to Reign it it was his domain see and and and so uh uh uh of course it would be uh uh uh uh a state of Peace a condition of Peace an atmosphere of Peace because the Bible says that God is the God of Peace amen he it's not just the peace of God that you have but he's the God of Peace amen so then God cannot create havoc and disorder he doesn't cause confusion amen uh uh anything that he does is results in peace can you say Amen it result results in peace and so it was only after man fell did chaos and confusion and disorder uh uh uh set in it's because man fell from his position and instead of ruling and reigning on the earth he he's now a victim of the devil amen and and so uh and and as we know there's absolutely no way that man could ever come back to that position uh on his own ain't that right amen Paul uh talks there in Hebrews and and he mentions he mentions a uh uh uses a phrase Eternal judgment Eternal judgment and and the prophet said see that that that tells us that everyone is condemned and and no matter what we ever do we're condemned that you you you can't be good enough Amen to to come out of this uh judgment it's an eternal judgment it's it's not just a judgment for a day it's it's not just a judgment for a week it's it's man is is forever under this eternal or under this judgment see we were born condemned our parents and not only just us our parents our ancestors all the way back to Adam uh uh and and and or Abel and Cain and see all condemned you know brother brand would tell it if you've never stolen a thing in your life if you never cheated if you never committed adultery if you never lied uh if you never done one bad thing you're still condemned amen you're under that judgment it it it there there's nothing you can do about it amen see because uh uh you know brother Brown would say that we're condemned before we breathed our first breath see uh uh see so he says we were judged by the sexual desire of our parents who through their act brought us here on the earth so here Psalms uh 51 and5 it says behold I was shaken uh shapen and and and one writer says brought forth I was brought forth in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me ain't that right so so you're you're your very conception in the womb was uh through sin ain't that right see so we know uh uh this by the message of the hour and by the scriptures but Adam fail he fail by heeding to his wife and she fell by listening to Satan's reasonings and and and when that happened he uh Adam lost his right to life to eternal life for God said the day you eat thereof that day you die amen but he also lost his fellowship with God he lost that relationship with God and and and when he lost his life then he also lost his inheritance in life ain't that right because he had complete Supreme control of the earth amen and he was a god of the Earth the prophet said God is the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to for he was God of this Earth amen and and it was peace there was no disturbance there was nothing there to hinder him uh uh because of his position but when he fell he lost his inheritance the Earth that's why the prophet said he lost his inheritance which was the earth and and now it was passed from his hands to the one that he solded out to and that was Satan right so Satan uh he's the he's the control of the earth he's the one that is is does and and and builds up things and and and controls the the winds and the you know uh all these tornadoes and all this hurricanes and all of these things that's that's Satan bringing all all that you see and and so um but but he uh man sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning the prophet said therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth was passed from his hand to Satan see and so then ever since then Adam's seed has destroyed this Earth has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had and so uh as we know God promised to destroy them those that destroy the Earth look at this Revelations 11 and 18 and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the Dead that they should be judged and that thou should us give reward unto thy servants and the prophets and to the Saints and them that fear thy name small and great and should us destroy them which destroy the Earth so so the prophet said man has completely destroyed the Earth with his filth amen uh his his his uh uh murder amen he's polluted the Earth with murder and the blood of his fellow man and uh uh he's uh uh adulteries and the the the drinking and War and gambling and the whiskey and and every sin for thing look transgenders now and homosexualities and and such irreverence toward God and and all this it's polluted the Earth and not only that they've done all that look at the fracking and look at all this and look at this and I'm not into all that politics but ain't what God made that Earth for it's just the facts of it and and they're even the prophet said they're even getting into God's chemistry and and and they're making these bombs and they're making all these warheads and it's it's causing it's causing an upset in nature and all of these things they're polluting what God made this world for see this Earth wasn't made for sin do you believe that amen this Earth wasn't made for sin it was made amen for peace it was made for man to dwell together with God and and and and these things but see man thinks that he's making the earth a better place to live in brother Bram said even though the the World Council of churches uh say that they're making this earth the earth the world a better place to live in brother Bram says I say they're making it a better place to sin in and that's the truth sin it's becoming easier to sin it's becoming easier and I want to tell you young people amen you see the world doing the things that they're doing don't you uh fall in with that amen don't you fall in with that you say well it looks okay well I don't care amen you say well well uh uh the other young people people are are doing it and and and and they're getting by with it and it looks good it looks appealing amen but they could be unconverted amen and trying to tell you things that God is against you better listen now amen see because it's coming a time it's becoming more easier to sin it's becoming more relaxed Amen to where people ain't caring about what God thinks they're not caring about the ways of Holiness and the ways of of righteousness just because young people even in the message are them girls are allowing their skirts to get higher and higher that don't mean it's right can you say Amen it does not mean it's right amen and you'll be judged for it see amen you've got to stay with what the Bible says but it's becoming more easier to let down the bars it's and and and so so you understand they're defiling the very thing that God made this for uh uh uh for his his presence and his Spirit see amen and Sons and Daughters see amen but but peace taken away from the earth amen and now man has become hostile see and so now notice when Adam forfeited the title deed to the Earth and eternal life Satan could not get his well the prophet said his dirty hands his Filthy Hands on that title deed amen aren't you glad for that amen amen it went back to the to the the original owner amen that was God ain't that right see and and so uh uh we we find there in John in Revelations 5 tells us who has that title deed he says in the first verse and I saw in the right of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals see so God is the one sitting on that throne and he has the title deed Satan has no right to that title deed therefore he has no right no claim over this Earth amen can you say Amen you think well look look like the Republicans are fighting over it and the Democrats are fighting for it and Russia is fighting for it and and China is fighting for it and us is fighting for it noain none of them have a right amen no sir the title deed to this earth goes to God Amen that's right can you say amen amen see and so uh uh therefore Satan cannot lay claim Amen to this earth and that's why he can't lay claim to you amen it's true now amen amen he can't lay claim see because it doesn't belong to him just like you don't belong to him ain't that right amen and if you really understood that you don't belong to him no wonder we look for a city Amen to come because we know the same God Amen that took us from Satan's grip is the same God that's going to take this Earth from Satan's grip Satan is just a squatter on God God's Property so we see in Revelations 5 that this this book the title deed Abstract title deed the prophet called it is in the hands of God waiting for Redemption claims that's what brother Brown said at the very opening of the seals it was in God's hands waiting for Redemption claims ain't that right but notice uh uh the second verse Revelations 5:2 and I saw a strong Ang proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man everybody say no man no no man in heaven no man in earth no man neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I WP much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on now now to think of that amen no one I mean he wept not because he was the one that he he couldn't open the book he wept because if no one was worthy then all creation was lost now you think of that here Abraham before the seals were ever opened before the blood of Christ was ever shed he was still looking for that City there was a revelation that struck his heart now here John is seeing the book Clos and there's no man now if there's no man that was able to open that book then everything that Abraham looked for everything that all of the Saints had had hope for they all died in vain they all lived in vain they everything was in vain and here was John because if no man could open that book amen uh uh then then if the book couldn't be open then all creation is lost right and and we know these things but just to go through it but God put God put a uh in place a law of redemption and this this law required an innocent substitute and it had to be a not only an innocent substitute but it had to be a kinsman redeemer can you say Amen therefore Adam couldn't not meet those requirements Adam he fell he went out after his wife but he could not bring her back he couldn't bring himself back because it made him a sinner ain't that right when he sined he become a sinner and he wasn't a sinner by just by his action you're not a sinner by your actions you're a sinner by Nature amen can you say amen that's right you're a sinner by Nature amen that's why when it comes to a sinner amen an unconverted man there's no black and white it's all black amen he can sit in church and and and and go through all the forms of religion but if he ain't converted he's still a sinner by Nature he's just as black as black can be amen that's right see and so uh uh uh the holy image of God left him and so mankind is just a fallen human being having a sinful nature now yes man can love and and and and we all have that part of love we love our children we love our wife we we well some love their boat and some love their house and some actually love school and some love their you know I mean it's we we have this expression of love in some way some love politics some love their their their denomination and some love this and love that but but see but but the highest form of love that man can ever obtain in his own self Fallen nature is human love that filio love can you say Amen now there's all kinds of loves under that there's lust love there's filthy love there brother brand called it loves loves loves loves it just condenscending down to just just just filth of Love ain't that right see amen man can have compassion but the highest form of compassion is human compassion you see he can know God but the only way he can know God uh in that Fallen state is by intellectual conception that's that's why you must be born again amen that's right see amen now he can still be as religious as can be as we SE it through the Bible amen Cain balum uh uh uh Judas and Esau and on and on we we could go here amen and they can be just as religious as can be and yet be a ranked sinner can you say Amen see it's impossible for man to ever surpass the human nature on his own Merit that's right and the human nature the prophet said takes man away from God it takes man away from the word of God it takes amen he could hear the word of God but all of a sudden intellectual thinking starts reasoning and and starts this and starts that oh yeah I can do this I can do that and I can do this and I can do that and yet not right in the will of God you can do God a service and not be his will can you say Amen see so so the human nature takes man away from God and God said to man uh I believe in Isaiah he said my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts see so then man in the best of his ability in the best he has to offer he has a carnal mind he can he can do God a service with a carnal mind he he can he can he can he can read the Bible with a carnal mind he can even listen to The Prophet's messages with a carnal mind he he everything about it he's got a carnal mind but that carnal mind is enmity against God it Wars against God so how can you have peace when man is hostile toward God our own nature is hostile toward God ain't that right amen you see that that word uh enity uh uh uh is hostile hatred and enemy amen so the nature that man has is a is a carnal mind a carnal nature that's enity it's an enemy to God Amen God says we'll do this and we'll sit there and argue with him and we'll do this and well I'll do it my own way and I'm going to do it this way and and and and that's why people don't pray anymore that's why we don't seek God that's why you know the the politicians got their own ideas and and and here it's going that this nation is going to rotten and and it's going to whatever but they'll still refuse to pray amen here was a prophet that manifested the The Works of God and manifested the sign of Messiah and yet they would refuse because the Nature's hostile for God see so we find that the carnal mind has made man hostile an enemy towards God and all that God is it has put a hatred in man towards the word of God am amen and the will of God and I'm talking about perfect word perfect will not not uh uh our own interpretations of this but God's perfect will God's perfect way H we got our way well I can do it and I I'll read the Bible Well I think it needs to be this way and God would send us a prophet and tell us exactly I mean verbatim clear what we should do and what we shouldn't do oh but I think it ought to be this way see carnal mind ain't that right carnal mind see so now there's not a a a uh well Paul would tell us that the carnal mind is not subject to the law of God which is the word of God and neither can it be so then there there is not a sex born man that has that ability to redeem Mankind and all creation for the Bible says that all men everybody say all men that includes me have sinned and have come short the glory of God so this is why Jesus would tell us you must be born again amen that's right so so God's law uh of redemption required a kinsman redeemer but so that's why the Angels even though they're innocent of sin they could not redeem us ain't that right no animal could redeem nothing could redeem see but then John sees this bloody lamb step forward amen and take the book no is there he just takes the book loose the seals and John sees his name can you say Amen the Revelation starts strikes the heart amen that's right see well that lamb is Jesus for John there the Baptist John the Baptist identified him Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world ain't that right yeah he was a man but he wasn't sex born man he wasn't a just a common sex born he was born of a virgin you realize that people don't even know why he was born of a virgin why it had to be a virgin amen they don't even know it amen why well it's because our sex born uh uh being sex born caused us to be Sinners and if he was sex born he would have been a sinner amen but he had to be virgin born which no man could be that except God do it God created that blood cell God created that egg God created it all in the womb of a woman virgin ain't that right amen see now furthermore second Corinthians 5:19 Paul said it was God in Christ yeah reconciling the world for himself amen so we're no longer just seeing a man we're seeing a tabernacle of De that's right a human being kinsman redeemer but the only way he could be a kinsman redeemer was God would become man God would create his own body and with his own blood loose us from the grips of Satan praise the Lord Lord you see not only is God the God of Peace but he's also the author a peace prise the Lord he's the start the beginner amen ain't that right 1 Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace amen ain't that right so if you look back to Garden of Eden you will find that God's attitude is wrapped up in seven Redemptive names Hallelujah God showing himself through seven Redemptive names of Jehovah that's God's attitude when you look at the seven Redemptive names that's God's attitude toward people that's God's attitude toward the Earth that's God's attitude see and one of those names is Jehovah Shalom peace that's his attitude toward us he doesn't want to leave us in turmoil he doesn't want to leave us conflicted right he doesn't want to leave us as an enemy no he wants to be our friend and no one can do that except he he being the God of Peace amen amen and the attribute he's the author of Peace amen ain't that right so in speaking of Jesus uh Luke 1:76 and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet in the way of Peace amen into the way of Peace ain't that right so then only through the work of redemption could peace come that's right ain't that right so he become the auth or the kinsman redeemer therefore the author of our peace now Isaiah 53:5 but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed ain't that right brother Bram said we should have been the ones been chastised but now we have peace we should have been the one conflicted but we have peace we should be the one being judged but now we have peace he took our judgment he was the substitute he took our place he become me that I might become him can you say Amen yes sir see we have peace notice the peace he says John 14:27 Jesus said Peace I leave with you amen amen my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you can you say Amen now the politicians promises is peace yeah the the the inventors of of these thing of the world promising us peace yes the church promises peace to us the pleasures of life promises peace no wonder people ain't looking to God no wonder the world ain't looking for the city of Peace amen they they they they're they're following a mirage that's true amen ain't that right cuz notice in in 1 Thessalonians 5:3 Paul says when they shall say peace and safety oh my peace and safety sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape can you say Amen look at this uh the Apostle Paul he's speaking of this day uh in that uh uh the 1 Thessalonians 5:3 because look at the first and 2 ver verses there he says but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when then when when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them now why why can't they have peace now notice now why can't they have peace why ain't they everything that they're doing to bring peace why ain't they getting it well Jeremiah 6 6 and 10 uh uh he says To Whom Shall I speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised see they ain't got the Holy Ghost to hear the spirit of Truth see the their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach see they have no Delight in it amen and that's the way people you you you you you get people and you start dealing with their liveses according to the word they they just get mad they quit they they just you know why because they they have no ear they their ear is uncircum uncircumcised they have no Delight the word of the Lord has become a reproach unto them therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord I am weary with holding in I will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the Assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the Aged with him that is full of days and their houses shall be turned unto others with their fields and wives together for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith Lord for for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them everyone is given to covet us and from the prophet even unto the priest everyone dealth falsely see they have healed also the hurtt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace telling them you're okay you're okay you can smoke that cigarette amen you you can be women preachers yeah oh yeah you're okay God just loves us all he appreciate you know he accepts uh uh transgenders and this and this and that and you see they're they're they're they're they're saying peace peace when there is no peace they're offering things that are abominable to God and it's a lie amen amen so see see 15th verse now were were they ashamed when they had committed Abomination nay see they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush neither could they get embarrassed about it right Prophet said it used to be that that if a man wouldn't even say a swear word around a woman right true now the women about as bad as the men or even worse some in some cases therefore they shall fall among them that fall at that time at the time that I visit them they shall cast be cast down sayi the Lord I believe this ties with the coming yeah of the Lord in this age of the son of man thus say the Lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the Old Paths where is the good way and walk therein and you shall find rest peace for your souls but they said we will not walk therein that's right hello Prophet went around seven times around this world showing the Messiah sign ain't that right and America refused it in 1956 brother Ram said she'll either accept it or reject it this world has rejected it amen fulfilling the very scripture we will not walk therein also I set Watchmen over you I set preachers over you I I set ministers that'll preach the word saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet but they said we will not hearken Hello therefore he you Nations and know oh congregation what is among them here o Earth behold I will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words nor to my law but rejected it see so so the world is fulfilling these scriptures now and yet they're crying for peace peace peace ain't that right but as they cry for peace they are committing abominable things sins they have become as the sodomites Amen in lot's day and and as the people in Noah's day ain't that right but this day is even worse in that day because both of them days are combined into this day sure is that's right and did you notice in lot day them the actions of them people brought the wrath of God upon that sure did and the actions of the people in Noah's day brought the wrath of God upon them yes sir see this is the worst day ever do you believe that amen every vile spirit every demon spirit is loosed upon this day and people are manifesting them that is true and you say Amen out of all the ages here we are amen the lid of hell has come off demons are pouring out everywhere it's upon the people it's the worst day and and you can't expect nothing but the wrath of God that's right amen that's right it's true see so they cannot bring peace no no matter what their inventions are you you you you say well you know I I just you know uh um you know people people get in so into movies these days just to just to relax their mind and just for the entertainment but there's no peace in that you you understand what I'm saying I I hope I'm really making it clear the best I can is that there's no peace on this Earth there can be no peace on this Earth without Redemption amen now if you look uh Romans 3:11 see he says there is none that understandeth there is none that that seeketh after God they're all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one their throat is an open seure their with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips their whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are Swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace they have not known there is no fear of God Before Their Eyes ain't that right so then that would tell us that as long as there is sin there is going to be no peace amen as long as there's sin there will be no peace ain't that right see and and as we said the law and and of sin and death Works in every human being uh uh and and and that true and therefore Satan is able to control Humanity it doesn't matter if they're doctors of divinity it doesn't matter if he's the pope himself it doesn't matter if it's in the white house if they're rich if they're poor amen Satan is able to control because man is under the law of sin and death politics religion education science all these things ain't that right Satan is the inspiration behind science he's the inspiration behind education he's the inspiration behind these nations politics he's the one that's anointing the Democrats he's the one that's anointing the Republicans he's the one there there is no uh uh uh uh uh sides with him he's anointing them both politics is all corrupt he's behind technology yeah hello amen amen he's behind Hollywood he's behind religion he's the one that causes Wars among the Nations he's the one who breaks up marriages and families he's the one who causes the murders and adulteries and POS uh prostitutions he's the one that controls the politics we all know that politics is a political power and it's his power that's what brother ramam said can you say Amen he's the one that's inspiring amen these politicians to sanction uh uh abortion sanction homosexuality sanction transgenders yes he's the one that's causing these ministers in schools of of uh theology to to accept these things and and the prophet said in all of his corruption Satan is making ladies and men of all ages young and old drunk cursing swearing committing adultery wrapped up in the Fashions of the world why because it's Satan's domain yes sir they're under Satan's Dominion can you say Amen why do we have wars why do we have troubles why why why why why do we have Nation against Nation brother BR said because Jesus the prince of Life come and they killed him can you say amen amen that's right see so it's impossible to have peace as long as the God of Peace is rejected ain't that right so is World Peace going to come by politics absolutely not is the world going to uh is is World Peace going to uh uh uh uh come by by religion absolutely not is World Peace going to come by the union of Nations and the union of churches absolutely not that's what they're joining they join the the the the union of Nations the United Nations to bring World Peace it ain't working is it it ain't working well they're joining now the the union of churches together to bring a peace now watch her she's rising up you're going to take that's right brother Ram say she she going to do it they're they're joining together to fight communism and all these things it's it's it's it's happening right this election's just really becoming interesting it's in God's hands there's nothing out of control I can't tell you if Trump Biden or who's going to do it but whoever's in there it's it's it's only making way for something to happen can you say amen and it's all for the sake of Peace but there will be no peace can you say Amen cuz that kind of Union has always failed and brother Bram said it'll fail again see so there will only be peace on the earth When sin is gotten rid of can you say amen amen see sin ceases when Satan is bound how many believes that sin ceases when Satan is bound and it is destroyed when Satan is destroyed amen think of it during the Millennium the Bible says Satan's going to be bound ain't that right look uh Revelations 20 and 1 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years amen and cast him into a bottomless pit shut him up see and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled right so what does that tell you and I that the Millennium is going to be a time of Peace ain't that right amen this happens after the marriage supper of the Lamb remember we're raptured out of here which is imminent at any time we're going to go in to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen the tribulation is going to set here upon this Earth for 3 and 1/2 years but then there is Promised a honeymoon Hallelujah for the bridegroom and the bride amen ain't that right and it's going to be a a a a a a time a peace and the city that we're looking for comes after the honeymoon amen ain't that right see and then the prophet says the bridegroom and and takes his bride home Glory see so but the the Millennium is going to be one Great Piece now now notice uh uh uh Revelations 20 and4 and I saw Thrones and they set upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that have part in the First Resurrection on such the second death ha no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign everybody say rain they shall reign with him a th000 years now that's got to tell us something that Redemption has taken place amen ain't that right we're going to rain brother Brown called it the millennial rain see Malachi 4:3 and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet what the tribulation is already done with ain't that right they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of host now notice the prophet says see at the return of the church and bride see the Bride In Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and there they shall rain aren't you glad for that it's going to be a reign of Peace amen ain't that right notice and the heathens that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested if he's to rain he's got to have something to rain over he's got a domain and they ruled and reign with Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of iron the Nations then the gospel he says see then the Manifest manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here there will come the Millennium in that rain upon the ashes can you say amen amen but we're looking for a city amen the Millennium is not the new heaven it's not the new Earth brother Brown said see the Millennium is just a different Reign it's a time of rest ain't that right you're still in time because you're here for a thousand years see in that Millennium you're still in time but it's a time of rest see brother Brown said the millennium is is just a rest place a rest period not at all the new heavens and the new Earth for you see in the Millennium we have things that would not go into that see it's a type of the old seventh day out at Eden seventh day after he made the world seventh day God rested in Eden and now the Millennium ain't that right see so so we look the first six days God created the world but on the seventh day he rested ain't that right so so second Peter 3 and8 one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and A Thousand Years is as a day unto the Lord so we can say in six days he created or in 6,000 years God created and on that seventh he rested amen amen now the world has gone through 6,000 years ain't that right right time the time of 6,000 years and now we're getting ready to enter into that seventh day amen hello for the world ain't that right now brother Brandon talks and tells us how that the number six is the number of man so 6,000 years is man's day yes brother BR said see it's man's doing man's work man's religion man's Church man's ideas man's achievements everything about man ain't that right amen yes sir that's that's man's day but we we're finishing up that's right thank the Lord now the day of the Lord hello is coming the Lord remember John was caught up on the the Lord's day brother Braham said see John was over in the Lord's day and what did what what did John see nothing about man in his accomplishments he saw Christ as being Supreme judge he saw the Nations come to their end he saw the mighty Angel descend to Earth with an open book to claim what he had redeemed praise the Lord see he heard the mighty Angel declare that time shall be no more he saw the bride in the Millennium he saw the holy city coming down upon a new Earth yeah new Heaven and a new Earth hello Amen in the Lord's Day Lord can you say amen amen see it was a revelation that had been shut up in God's mind and John sees this didn't understand everything but he sees it can you say Amen now if you notice there will still be sin after the Millennium for the Bible says that Satan will be loose for a little season Revelations 20 and 7 s and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison knows what he does he'll never be converted no matter what you do he'll never be converted and his demons will never be converted right his subjects will never be converted hello and he shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog together them together to battle uh the number of whom is as the sand of the sea ain't that right so then Satan is not destroyed during the Millennium he's only bound amen ain't that right and what what binds him the the Bible talks about that chain the angel with the chain that bound him brother Bram said it's it's it's a chain not a log chain but it's a chain of circumstance amen ain't that right see brother Brown said see he cannot come out and deceive the Nations no more all of his subjects was in hell and all that was resurrected on the Earth was redeemed and Jesus with them can you say Amen so he had nothing to work on he can't work on you you resisted the devil's lie in the beginning you proved on this Earth that you're not like Eve amen you're going through your testings and you're going through your trials am to prove to Satan that you're not like her hello amen he'll work on all kinds of people in this day doesn't matter who they are famous nonf famous poor Rich whoever he works on them but there's going to come a time that there will be nothing to work on because it'll only be the redeemed praise the Lord and he has nothing to work on brother Bri said at the end of the Millennium of of the Thousand Years comes the second Resurrection when they're all raised up and Satan is loose for a little season so the Millennium he says in another place is the Sabbath day when the church will no more labor against sin aren't you glad for that church am I hope this is all right for you this morning but am to think there's coming a time right we ain't going to labor against that Temptation amen we're not going to labor against them habits we're not going to labor against the the Waring that that that comes of with today see it's a time of rest Satan is Bound for a little season a thousand years because his subjects is is all in Hell the church that's on the earth is redeemed right in the presence of Christ so he has nothing can work on so it's not a chain a log chain it's a chain of circumstance he has nothing he can do amen he's helpless hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of his subjects then they're separated a sheep and goats from the goats can you say Amen so then sin will be carried on the other side and I get ready to close but sin will be carried over on the other side of the Millennium brother Bram typed it with Noah going into the ark and and ham in the ark and they were carried over see uh and and he he typed it as the type of Millenium see Enoch was translated Before the Flood ain't that right which was a type of the Bride being caught up raptured not the one that was carried over amen ain't that right so it's after the Millennium that sin is going to be dealt with destroyed hello it's showing the process of the city to come that's right amen sin has to be dealt with ain't that right amen then the prophet said there comes a renovation yes sir of Heaven and Earth amen ain't that right Isaiah 65:16 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind amen Revelations 21:1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea now if you haven't listen to Future home of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom you ought to go listen to it right amen yeah brother Braham tells us it's not a total annihilation of Heaven and Earth it's a renovation can you say amen he said see what was our first Heavens it was the Millennium see what's the first Earth it's this it'll be renovated see just like it was baptized by Noah in the days of his preaching Sanctified by Christ as he sprinkled his blood upon it and it will be renovated take all the germs everything off of it in the reen renovation at the end with a fire baptism that'll kill every germ every sickness every disease every fith that was ever on the earth everything that is not like God did not come from God that is a result of man's sin it'll totally be destroyed and there will be an eternal City a peace Eternal peace Eternal peace can you say Amen it's redeemed Heaven see brother Brown said see she'll burst forth and come forth A New Earth and I saw a new Heaven A New Earth the first Heaven and the first this first Earth was passed away and there was no more sea why it's redeemed ain't that right oh do you love him amen if you go look at the second verse there and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the tabern Le of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and notice at this time and God shall wipe the tears from their eyes am amen yeah oh wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away see he says there God will be with his true attributes son and daughters where he can fellowship with them in Holiness with their eyes blinded to any sin for there will never be no more Sin from there on aren't you glad for that yes sir see so that Holy City cannot come down until the Earth has been totally redeemed hallelujah amen and when it's redeemed then sin and the effects of it is totally annihilated right now church I I hope I hope you understand through my you know my chopped up ways of trying to tell you preach this morning but think of what Redemption means to your soul yeah right sin has been totally obliviated amen amen because you're not waiting for the Redemption of your soul your soul has been redeemed now then you can no longer be a sinner in his sight Lord can you say amen amen that's right brother Bram talks about you know what where Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away the heavens and earth passing away see the Bible speaks of that doesn't mean that it'll be annihilated but rather that it will pass from one form to another amen ain't that right see pass from one thing to another from one condition to another it's going to be changed that's what Redemption is all about Lord man can't even comprehend no wonder Paul would tell us you know eye ha Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them ain't that right why because it comes through Redemption amen comes through Redemption going to be changed see that's what Redemption does we we all know it brother Bram talks about it of how that it's going to be loosed loosed when he Jesus sitting there at at at standing there at Lazarus and he calls Lazarus to come forth and then he says loose him and let him go he said that's the same thing that happens to this earth it's loose from Satan's grip amen it's the same thing that happened to your soul when that Holy Spirit baptism fire of God come into you it loosed you from Satan's grip that's right right think of that a people on this Earth demons pouring out everywhere and he can't touch you praise the Lord praise the Lord because you've been loosed and the prophet said you've been perfectly loosed if it if you're loosed by a perfect blood which is the blood of God then it's a perfect loosening per it's not saved today and lost tomorrow no sir it's not saved when you feel good and lost when you feel like you're you're nothing no no no no you're sealed to the day of your Redemption sealed sealed sealed brother BR says what does that mean you're sealed in and Satan is sealed out he can't touch you I love it amen changed brother Ram said see you're the same man in stature that you was when God called you same woman but you see what it did it was a generation the old life passed away the old desire has passed away when you used to like to drink cuss fuss stew and run around and immoral things all that just died then you were Satan's instrument now you're redeemed yes can you say amen he said and that's what the world will be the same way redeemed a new Heaven and a new Earth absolutely he said the Earth will be loose Lo from the grip of Satan it will be loosed it'll be Loos from politics it'll be Loos from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of God to be established uh to to be established it here on the Earth but as long as it's in the hands of Satan politics Satan's the ruler of the earth he owns it he it belongs to him but now Christ redeemed it amen aren't you glad for that see one time I was his property one time that little woman at the well that was his property but not now he come to loose the grip of it he Loos the grip of sin of Satan upon my life upon your life and now we're not his anymore he said you've you've he said have you often heard me say in prayer take your hands off of God's Property amen see have faith to claim your own hello have faith to claim your own true God help us to get out of the Molly grubs and have faith have faith can you say Amen to claim her own see he said that's your rights take your hands off of her take your hands off of him why faith will do it see not annihilate it but just take your hands off of it Loose it and Let It Go pass it away let it change from sickness to health let it change from a center bound uh uh person of Hell To Hell to a saint Bound for heaven amen that's good can you say Amen the Lord so at the time of its Redemption heavens and earth are going to be passed away the S the systems are going to be changed World Systems civilization will be changed the Lord math or yeah Matthew 55 Jesus said blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the earth they're not going to be destroyed with those that destroy this earth right think of that we were his attributes amen but we were Sinners by representation yes we acted filthy yes we were probably the chief of Sinners yes we done things
