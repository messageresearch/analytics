someone had sent a quote today and brother I'm talking about a lady that he was that felt like she had crossed the line and brother Brandon Masters said do you still have respect for Jesus Christ she said with all my heart I respect him he said showed you ain't crossed the line yet amen I think the bride of Christ just has just uh all respect for our Lord she just loves him and she wants to do everything to wash his feet to make him welcome to honor him and I believe that's the way we all feel tonight amen the musicians can be dismissed and I trust you had a good afternoon and uh just um come just to Worship the Lord and maybe a little cold on the outside but nice and toasty here and the church amen and just good to feel his presence if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter in sister Rebecca reached out today and had asked if it'd be okay if she become a part of our assembly and I told her she'd be most welcome so we officially wanted to welcome her Amen to the church here and and uh pray that you will be blessed and and I know you'll be a blessing to us and amen praise the Lord You've uh there's a good group of people here you're at Faith Tabernacle and you can excuse just all of our uh well what is it roughness or just Humanity amen and know that we love the Lord and we're all striving to be more like the Lord and I believe we're all going to go home together and such a great anticipation for that amen if uh we just want to just bow our heads to our Lord before we go into the word and just asking to help us tonight Lord Jesus we're thankful to be part of your children and Lord we've come through many many things in our lives Lord each one of us have a past and we look back over and wonder how we got here the Lord has been by your grace and your mercy Lord we just want to reverence you into just give you honor and Lord I pray that you would just be with us this evening and speak to every Heart Lord just speak through my lips Lord and I pray father that when we leave this place we'd be bitter Christians Lord more equipped to face the enemy Lord father I ask you just a special prayer for sister retief Lord in the church there I know they're suffering they're all in shock that I pray Lord that you would just Comfort their hearts and be with them fathers our prayer during this time of loss we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen I'd just gotten word that sister retief you know they were in a array he had the heart attack and uh so she's doing good wasn't hurt sounds like and uh just just in shock he had just got through preaching there and they were apparently on their way home or they were I guess going from church when he had the the heart attack but we know he's with our Lord and so and glad for that amen Hebrews the 11th chapter we read this last Sunday evening and I want to read it again the sixth verse but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen you can have your seeds and I want to continue on the subject of last Sunday evening and um I believe I've titled that meditating on the positive and so I want to maybe just uh continue along them lines there but I believe that God wants us to be positive and another scripture that we've read and I'm going to read it again uh Philippians 4 and 8 says finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise and that virtue is strength if there be any strength if there be any praise if then think on these things and so there as a Christian there's a way of life that that that uh we must live and and it's it's not you know uh it's not rules it's it's nothing like that it's it's just it's for our benefit it it is a way to defeat the Devil and so I looked up this word and according to Webster the word positive is to be fully assured to be certain it means that you have come to a conclusion where there is no doubt or uncertainty so that's what positive is so when we're thinking of uh meditating on the positive then we're looking at that that something that that has been settled no questions to it we we've come to a place of absolutely a surety we're certain ain't that right so we're not we're not talking of positive thinking as what the world is because what is there positive that can be so an absolute there's nothing and and so we're not going that direction but there is a positive and there there is something that is an absolute and that's the word of God ain't that right so you can only be positive uh or certain and and uh Webster use this word indubitable so you can only be positive or certain on indubitable evidence you know I wouldn't use that word because I didn't know what it was could barely say it in do indubitable so I looked up that word and that means unquestionable so you can only be positive or certain on unquestionable evidence so the evidence has been provided and it is unquestionable ain't that right it's unquestionable now God's been gracious to give us a picture of the pillar fire that brother Branham talked about he would tell us about it did he not I see a light I see this but that's unquestionable because the camera doesn't take psychology it it it takes the actual fact it has to be there in order for the camera to pick it up ain't that right so then we can be positive so we we so our our thinking God has provided positive uh uh uh unquestionable evidence that would allow you to think positive to be positive ain't that right see your your your future is positive because of the evidence the overwhelming evidence that God has provided and it's unquestionable so therefore our future is bright it's positive ain't that right amen so so then there's no reason to question that's what being positive is you can you you can only be positive when there's no reason to question it that's why I'm positive about the message that's why I'm positive about the prophet being Malachi 4. that that's why I'm positive that the angel of of of Revelations 10 1 has come down I'm positive because I have seen evidence that is unquestionable hey ain't that right there's no reason for me to question so so this is what being positive is now then a person would have to have faith in in order to be positive for faith is is positive ain't that right now we've read without faith it is impossible to please God so so any anything if you're going to please God it has to be through positivity it ain't that right now if God wouldn't have provided enough evidence then then he couldn't expect you to be positive he couldn't expect you to meditate on the positive he couldn't expect you to speak positive but he's already provided the evidence ain't that right so therefore it it if to the believer it would produce a positive attitude a positive confession a positive thinking ain't that right everything about Christianity is positive brother random said there's nothing negative about Christianity nothing because there's overwhelming evidence and the evidence is unquestionable ain't that right so so then without faith it is impossible to please God now now we are human and so we all have to deal with uh our carnal side and and the prophet told us that we are the Battleground amen now there's a war that's been going on in heaven and that that that battle between Satan and God uh uh went from Heaven to Earth for God kicked Satan out of the Earth or Out of Heaven ain't that right and and so it was in the garden that we see that God raised a uh uh created him a family Adam and Eve and and he fellowshipped with him he communed with him but then that Old Slew Foot the devil was lurking around and he was present when God told him told them not to eat of the tree he knew what God said he was lurking around in the garden just kind of wandering around and and when God would visit with them no doubt he was right there listening all that time so then when he got Eve by herself away from Adam and and and it didn't happen just that one time but but I I believe it's actually brother Brown told us it was just bit by bit bit by bit just planting Little Seeds here little thoughts there little things here and he finally and she began to finally listen to him she began to ponder over what he was saying he began to ponder she began to reason it out and finally he got her into a place that he got her alone and began to able to speak to her directly and say did not you know uh uh didn't you know and and well she said well the Lord said that we ain't supposed to eat of this tree right and did you know that the serpent quoted God verbatim ain't that right he quoted verbatim What what what God told Eve but he just Twisted it just a little bit ain't that right so so we find that that uh uh uh so so that we find from there the Battleground is is we are the Battleground and it's in our minds ain't that right God chose the heart Satan chose our intellect chose the Mind amen and so now the the approach that Satan has is always negative everybody say Satan is always negative Satan is always negative and you know what negativity is it's a sign of unbelief negativity is a sign of unbelief and unbelief comes from Satan and and brother Brown said that's the sin is unbelief ain't that right so then as Christians in this age we must know how to discern between what is is the devil and what is God we must be able to discern what is evil and what is is righteous ain't that right yet you have to discern uh uh these things and and now notice uh Malachi 3 16 then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name now his name is called the word of God ain't that right that's what we read in Revel Nations it's called the word of God for he is the word ain't that right now uh he goes on in the 17th verse and they shall be mine the saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my Joel Jewels I will spare them as a man's speareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between right the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not ain't that right so we're living in a day of discernment that that the discernment must be there and it must be clear now we've had that discernment that spirit of discernment uh uh uh come up here uh in this age and to discern rightfully discern this word ain't that right to let us know what truly is Antichrist what is truly The Works of the devil what is truly of the devil versus what is truly The Works of God what is God how God works and and and these things things like that ain't that right so so therefore uh by listening to The Prophet by believing the prophet we we are our senses have been sharpened amen should be any ways to be able to discern every tactic that the devil has uh uh that comes our way ain't that right now we are here to serve God how many believes that we're not here to be on the on the fence post we we are here to serve God that that is our purpose and and and I think that's that's every one of us has got to come to this even you young people you've got to come to the the fact I am here to serve God I am a Christian before anything else every decision should be based that I am a Christian first ain't that right everything I don't care if it's the marriage I don't care if it's job I don't care where I if it's where I live it's it's you know uh there there's might have been places that I'd love to go I'd love to move to Alaska door Montana out you know all these things but I'm a Christian first and I'm here not to serve Sean Martin I'm here to serve God's purpose ain't that Brian well that's all of us we are here to serve God's purpose and I I I personally believe that if if God has brought you to this church you're here to serve a purpose in the house of God ain't that right everything is is for purpose and so then as we said to this morning that anyone that is truly filled with the Holy Ghost is part of the body of Christ which means that his own life is flowing in you I mean that that is not a make-believe that is not just something that we're just saying for positive thinking that is reality that is the truth God's own life flows through your veins all right ain't that right so you know what that means then then the creative word is in you right now do you believe that his creative power is in you right now do you realize that omnipotence is in you for if God is in you omnipotence uh is in you the prophet said deity is not in heaven it's in you ain't that right you know Jesus was full of God he was God all the fullness of the God he had what bodily in him but you know he had to pray for the Bible says All Flesh must cry out so he prayed you know what he prayed to not the God in heaven he prayed to the god in him that's what the prophet said he prayed to the God that was in him God wasn't some far out there way off on some Planet God was in him and the god that you're praying to is in you ain't that right it's it's true it's in you and and and and and Paul said it's Christ in you remember that's the mystery that's been hid before the foundation of the world Christ in you the hope of glory ain't that right now we read this uh this morning but omnipotence is a force of unlimited power that power is in you the omnipotent of God is in you do you realize what that is saying the force of unlimited power is right in you right now ah it's bottled up in you It's contained in you it's Paul Satan and you brush your mind right now that force of unlimited power is in every believer right now you're not a victim the omnipotent God is in you you're you're not limited to circumstance that uh that that force of unlimited power is in your veins right now do you believe that so God is the only one that is omnipotent but he dwells in his church which is his body brother Branham said when we have God's spirit in us we think like God say man we actually take on his nature so now as God thinks we think as God acts we act as God spoke we speak because it's God in us don't tell me that God takes your body and then lays dormant and then all it is is Humanity you're just poor beggarly weak and just defeated that God didn't God didn't redeem you and take your body to live in just for that ain't that right the Bible the prophet said we are his victory he died for this purpose that we might show his victory now Church Calvary means nothing if we ain't going to show the world what Calvary was it was at Calvary that Satan Was Defeated it was out Calvary that that Satan lost his power it was at Calvary that Satan could no longer accuse the Believers it was out Calvary because of Calvary and today we are proof of that you believe it so when we have God's spirit in us we think like God now Philippians 2 and 5 Paul said lift this mind everybody say let this mind be in you how can that be in you in us because there's something else besides you that's living in that body let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus you realize that Jesus God is a personality all to himself he he is being all to himself we don't add to God we can't take away from God the only thing that God does is take your body but you didn't add to him and you didn't take away from him take away from him ain't that right so when he comes in he doesn't borrow your personality he's his own personality ain't that right so then he takes control of you and you literally take on his mind ain't that right see a human being cannot think like God ain't that right just as a bird cannot think like a human being or the ladybug now brother Branham talks of the canary that thought he had knowed all the knowledge that needed to be known he knowed so much that he could tell all the rest of the canaries about the human beings so he flies up on his cage and he begins to speak about the human being and how he knows all about them and all of a sudden the professor from Purdue walked up and began to speak some high polished words to him and the little fell about it his eyes and turned his head now he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he's got a canary brain he's just a bird brain that's all he's got he hasn't got a human brain so he can't think like human beings how in the world could you think like God just with your human understanding can you say man so this is what's happened to the Natural Church they've learned all about God in what their little peanut human brain can learn ain't that right and they sing they know all there is because they went to Seminary or because they've read books or because they can quote quotes or or whatever see and they could read the Bible backward and forward and quote all the scriptures and all that that they think they have some knowledge of God ain't that right but when God actually came and revealed his word promise and Vindicated in this age they set their dumbfounded ain't that right because they're not acquainted with his ways they're not acquainted with his actions they're not acquainted with his supernatural being ain't that right now notice see Romans 8 and 6 I hope that's all right but he he says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded everybody say spiritually minded think of that spiritually my how did you get spiritually minded see to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God ain't that right for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh [Music] see but in the spirit ain't that right so something has happened because you had a carnal birth you've got a carnal nature you've got a carnal everything about you is carnal and you should be walking after the carnal mind after the carnal process or thinking a thought process but something must have happened ain't that right what was it omnipotent God come in and he took your vessel he took your body he borrows it for his purpose remember he died to have preeminence he once preeminence he wants first place of your life he don't want you thinking like the human being he don't want you handing your problems like a human being he don't want you you know uh uh uh just living life just like a human being there is a higher thought there is a higher power there is a higher life there is a higher nature a higher way do you believe that so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you I I want to put this scripture in here as well Galatians 5 16. Paul says this I say then walk in the spirit everybody say walk in the spirit what's the results you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh ain't that right for the flesh what the flesh lusteth against the spirit the flesh warths against the spirit now Satan comes to you on the carnal side ain't that right God deals with you on the spiritual side so the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh for these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would ain't that right now notice what brother Brown said if you haven't received it talking about the Holy Ghost then how can you believe in miracles see there there's an element of Faith there's an element that that we've got to rise to and that's what the Holy Ghost is to you and I that's what it means being the body of Jesus Christ is it actually lifts us up from the carnal realm into a spiritual realm it lifts our faith to just just the the materialistic things Amen to the spiritual things you realize there's a whole world of the spiritual things that we can have uh promises that we can have it's true now see he says so if you haven't received the Holy Ghost how do you believe in miracles how can you see that takes God in you to believe you act like God you know like God you think like God the Bible says that your amateur little Gods Jesus said so for you are a part of God [Music] you with me just the same as I'm a little Branham and you're a little whoever you are because your parents is that name the nature that you are is because your parents is that way because you were born of them and the reason that you believe God and Believe In Miracles and signs and wonders is because your sons and daughters of God you receive life amen so this natural life has natural characteristics and it all deals in the material it all deals in the carnal it all deals with what we see and what we hear the five senses and and even even our are the five senses of the spirit is affected uh memory reasoning conscience and affection or all of these things it's affected by that but then there's something that takes over it's another life yeah brother Brown said when the blood of the Lord Jesus was offered the Life of Christ which was God comes on the believer then what does it make you God's God's can you say that with me we are gods where gods don't think the way the world thinks it now this isn't the world putting you on a pedestal making you a god this is God's life making you a god you can't be a God I mean yeah you can be worshiped that's that's what I guess that's what the word god means but this there's a more greater meaning to this right there that means that you're not the victim anymore you're not a slave to sin anymore you actually you actually as a mortal being can have a higher process of thought as a as a mortal being you can actually come up into another level of living now they're trying to make it that way through through psychologists and through positive thinking and positive this and positive that but we're not talking about the world you you can't be anything that I'm talking about without the Holy Ghost ain't that right we're talking about adoption ain't that right so now notice uh the prophet said speaking of Adam he had full domain over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but everybody say but and aren't you glad for that but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again coming back to take it over again see waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him hmm God in you omnipotence in you stripping Satan of all of his power who little old me little old you insignificant to the world but significant to God can you say Amen because it's through you that he defeats his own enemy that's right amen ain't that right so brother Brown said he made man of God a God in his domain and his domain goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has the control of it so we find that the prophets were called Gods why because the word of the Lord came to them the word of the Lord and Jesus was God for he was the word made flesh ain't that right now notice look look at the power that that look look at the supernatural that Moses exhibited look look at the supernatural that uh that that that that that that Samson then that that down down Through the Ages look at the prophets and and and what they've done and exhibited what was it it was it was a supernatural beyond their natural strengths ain't that right then Here Comes Jesus the fullness of the word and here in Mark 11 12 on the moral when they now he was hungry as a man starving as a man I don't know about you when you get hungry I get cranky when I get hungry I get a little cranky I know oh my but that's just the way it is takes a lot of Grace so here Jesus as a man he's hungry and sing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily hoping that he could find some fruit and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet so here's a man that is hungry he's hoping to get some food from that tree and Jesus answered and said unto this tree no man eat from you from this day forward Michael's heard it so the Bible says that Jesus just went on now they they just see this man that's hungry he wants something to eat there's no food so now he's speaking something no man eat from you from here on cursed it right he just walks away you don't just sit around and say okay let's just build a tent right here and see if this thing happens not he goes on to Jerusalem and the Bible says that in the morning as they pass by they saw the fig tree dried up from its roots a man that was hungering looking for food but yet would speak a word that that tree had to obey that word affected that tree did it not it was dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curds is withered away and Jesus didn't say yeah you got to be kidding me no what he knew his word would affect ain't that right and Jesus so Jesus didn't act old like wow you know sometimes when miracles happen we just like whoa it happened it shouldn't be that way when you ask something in faith positive you've got to know it's going to happen if you said it if you prayed it then don't worry about it hello so now Jesus is saying he answers and says have faith in God now we know all we know what that really means interpreting have the faith of God right not just will I believe in God no possess the very faith and remember omnipotence dwells in you right so the the the attributes of God is now within the in you you're an attribute of God anyways right so verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which I saith did he say it that way no not if I say but if you say ain't that right see that that those that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith so then the man that is speaking is positive he's so positive that what he says is going to come to pass right yes sir that he has whatever he says therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive him and you shall have them so prayer must be based off of positive words must be positive the request must be positive ain't that right so you shall say you shall say this could not happen without the word coming to us if the word coming to the prophets made them God that same word coming to us makes us what gods ain't that right now the prophet said the word is in the bride amen oh I hope you're you're understanding I I know it's simple so but but it's Sunday night the work is in the bride where's it at in the bride there's a lot in that statement and the mind of Christ into what he once done with the word can I ask you to know what he wants done with the word oh I'm so grateful for the promises yeah I just wish you remember is like that little old lady that had all that and she was she was just broke poor as poor could be she got a son over India you know I think it was India and one of the investigators came into the home and and started talking to her and he said man why are you living like this you know well I got a son he's a just beautiful you know love him to pieces and and all that and he says oh well and he sends me postcards you know and he says really yeah so she shows him the postcards and he's really looking at that and and he said ma'am you know and I you know the story so he says ma'am these ain't postcards he sent you drafts right was it drafts money drafts you're a millionaire living living poor and yet right under her nose is the means to live wealthy now Church I can understand the church living poor we talk about the blood of Jesus Christ all the blood of Jesus and yet we just live like just barely making it I can understand through them Church ages but today I I just have a problem and and we let the devil run over us way too much we dance to his tune way too much can you say man we've had someone come to us and tell us every promise is yours it's been it's been yours since Calvary while you're sitting here just living old porn barely and just pleating all the time why not take the word that's with you Prophet said the words in the bride in other words we're not looking at the promises both of them are really nice one these days it'll happen I just don't know come on church it's in you [Music] [Applause] well when I get a little bit more spiritual if it took you'll never get spiritual without Christ and if it took you getting spiritual then God wouldn't have come into you in the first place he saved you when you was a nobody he called you when you was unworthy and you're still unworthy had not had been forgot to save you and to come and fill you with his life what else could we expect now notice the words in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word so now we're not just sitting here you know twiddling our thumbs and messing around then all of them are nice promises oh yes the prophet well he really preached it oh yeah Pastor preaches some things oh yeah no no no no no we know what he once done with the word we're not just sitting in a church and Amen brother keep Hunter preaching and then get out the door and we don't know how to do it we don't know how to overcome we don't know how to talk to the devil we don't know and he's just running all over us hello church that Spirit of Despair that Spirit of depression has no right to rule over the body of Jesus Christ that spirit of fear has no right Amen to to rule and to Reign Over the body of Christ we know what he once done with the word what does he want done use it speak it fake it at and she does it in his name right amen well what gives her the right to do that she's missed Jesus Christ [Music] ain't that right she has the saith the Lord come on Church the prophet had thus saith the Lord but now he's turning around said you've got the Sith the Lord man the word is in you Satan don't have to tremble at your words but when it comes to you speaking this word he has to bow to it he has to now in Revelations 1 or 10 8 John is told to take the book from the angel and eat it and after he takes the book he eats that right and then what does the angel of the Lord tell him Thou shalt or thou must prophesy speak the word now is coming out of your mouth John John's a reputation of the Bride the word now has got to come out of your mouth you speak it thank you and you say man we saw how how the prophet uh uh spoke the word of the Lord to to cancer and it fell we saw how he done it to blind eyes and it happened we saw what he done to Demons of all kinds and it happened the word was in his mouth now we have taken that same book and we've eaten the word now you must prophesy you must speak it quit saying oh why I just don't understand why all these trials I just don't think I'm going to make it that is a lie of the devil that is not speaking the word ain't that right now brother Brown says he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it everybody say she never doubts it now can you say that's me that's me that's me she never doubts it he's talking about me never doubt it amen you say boy that's getting bold brother that's either you or it's not but I'm telling you I never doubt it hello amen well that's something to confess anyways and if you believe that's you then confess it amen she never doubts it now watch Once I puts it therefore everybody say therefore now let's go back he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death you talking about positive that's positive for it to seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this you ready the word is in the bride as it was in Mary that's the secret the word is in the bride you know what your secret is of overcoming the word is in the bride you know what your secret is of being here right now when you should have been under the word is in the bride you know what the secret is of your face still maintaining strong the word is in the bride he thought he had me but the word is in me he thought he could destroy me but the word is in me he thought he sought he thought he looked at this Mortal human being and said that's an easy guy I'll take out he took all my weaknesses and said I'll destroy him but the word is in the bride therefore nothing can harm me not even death if he takes me by the way of the Grave one these days I'm coming up can you say man there's something positive about this the secret is the word is already in you this is all right [Applause] then he says the bride has the mind of Christ not carnal mind carnal mind there's no way out but we have the mind of Christ the wall is there there's nothing impossible with God for she knows what he once done with the word and notice she performs everybody say she performs oh I wish I'd get it to you God just give it to us the word is in the bride she knows what she wants done he wants done with it she performs now brother Terry I don't know what perform means but it has to be some action to that it has to be a an action word that that speaks of the Bride she receives it in his name she re he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it she has the mind of Christ she knows what he wants done with that word and she performs she's just not sitting there will I need to listen to another tape all of them are so good but I just don't know no she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord I don't know you can I ask you how else you're going to make it in a rapture how is she going to receive body change come on Church how else are you coming into all these things by the word of the Lord by the word of the Lord the word coming from these mortal lips the word coming from your lips can you say Amen now amen yes sir it's good to have a preacher yeah that you've got to have a preacher amen but but what good is the preacher if the word can't come into your life and the word can't be spoken through your mortal lips what about the preacher being gone what what about all these things you don't need the preacher coming and pet you all the time what you need is to take the word of God that you've received in your heart and let it perform you act upon that word and say devil get out of my house devil get out of my husband devil get out of my wife devil you leave my children alone in the name of the Lord and you little insignificant little uh house a dishwasher or whatever amen you've got the very word of omnipotence speaking from your mortal lips no wonder he makes us feel unworthy he makes us feel like we're just a little ant but I'm telling you you are significant when it comes to God you are valuable when it comes to God so much valuable that God yet said brother Brown said no one can take your place now you listen here now when it comes to God looking at you nobody can take your place you make somebody can take your place on the job somebody can take my place behind this Pulpit somebody can take our place anywhere else but when it comes to God nobody could take your place you're part of his body and omnipotent is in you for the word is in you people think that they have to wait for some sensation to come upon them before they begin to feel good and speak something but that ain't true you could be surrounded by an enemy him not feeling the chill bumps not being a mega meeting where the spirit of God is bouncing from wall to wall you could be right in the lowest of Hell in your life and began to speak the word of God [Music] can you say Amen you have the word for the word is in the bride the word is in the bride why I received it can you say Amen it went beyond My Five Senses it went beyond the senses of my spirit and it's got down into my soul I've received it as mine the word is now in me [Applause] amen you have the word now just meditate on it meditate meditate upon it and you will speak it ain't that right see you don't receive the word just by knowing it we got a lot of intellectuals man that can quote the Bible can quote quotes that can tell you verbatim What the quote is and where it's at on the page and what message and wow but you that's not how you receive the word is by knowing it so how do you receive the word brother Branham said by the Holy Ghost Quicken it to you ain't that right the letter kill us but the spirit giveth life then he says You must be born again and then the Holy Spirit quickens the word to you can you say man amen every time you hear the word receive it how do I receive it by believing it that's mine that's mine oh the devil's right there tell you oh it's not yours you know good and well you you're lost you know good and well you realize that sometimes this preacher deals with that just personally as well no hope there's no this there's no that you've crossed the line you've done this you've done that you knew better you know I've you know we've dealt with that as just as a child growing up Satan constantly telling you you're going to miss it you're this you're that and I didn't know how to battle with that and it sent me through depressions but because of the message of the hour I've learned to how to battle that thing devil get out of here devil you're a liar I ain't gonna listen to you I've been able to discern him between him and what is God everything negative is of the devil can you say amen and everything positive is of God for there's nothing negative in this message there's nothing negative about the word of God [Applause] amen amen I want to read what the Bible said when the angel appeared to Mary Luke 1 27 we'll start there to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou uh that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God oh God we found favor with him and behold Thou shalt conceive him thy womb and bring forth the son and thou shalt call his name Jesus now this is basically all that the Bible tells us of this event right is that one day Mary just coming walking along and some Angel just pops out and tells her you know but brother Branham gives us more insight and lets us in on the details and I love to read the stories of of how how brother Brown tells he tells it in several places but but how he he tells it and and Mary you know they go to church the day before and the priest is talking about what God done back then rode the Red Sea back the road back the Red Sea and this and that and and you know the prophet could tell stories you know and they get you involved and said boy how her heart how how her heart must have just leaked oh yeah oh yeah that's just that's wonderful yes sir and and they're coming home you know and and Marion is talking to Joseph and they're talking about what the the the the Pastor said said oh man yeah that was just wonderful he's talking about God how he does all them things I'm just like wow yes and Mr says but he really spoiled his sermon when he said God doesn't do these things today and she said Joseph do you believe God does them things oh yeah he still does so they're they're you know maybe kind of later on and and the prophets you know as she's going maybe going through her day but at the end of the day she she takes out the Scrolls or she says Joseph could you read read the read the scroll and he said well Mary you you yeah you you get whatever you want me to read now and so and and he tells it in a different place Joseph reading or Mary's reading or whatever but the point is is that when the Bible is open to her the Scrolls is read it's the very scripture the very scripture for unto us a child is born the whole virgin shall conceive and the prophet says it just done something to her um she'd had no idea who it was she had no idea about anything it just something quick into her heart right and and so it had burned in her and and the prophet says God put that scripture on her heart see that's what he's doing for us right now is he's laying the scriptures in our hearts [Music] now brother Brown said when God put something upon a person's heart he's ready to do something see when he puts these end-time scriptures on your heart as the prophet has done we wouldn't have even known them scriptures we wouldn't even know how to put the Bible together we didn't even know what the Rapture meant we didn't even know the order of rapture or anything but God would come and open the word to us and that lay in our hearts why because God's wanting to do something oh he wants to take you out of here but he had to put the word in your heart y'all believe that so so then the next day the prophet said she wakes up in that morning and the scripture's still there and she's meditating she's pondering over the scripture see as she's walking now see the Bible doesn't tell this but now the prophet is opening up to what Mary the condition that Mary is in she's not worried about some movie she watched she she is not worrying uh thinking about the YouTube channel she's not thinking about some jokes she's heard she's not thinking about whatever God had laid that scripture on her heart she had no idea she was the one she had no idea what was getting ready to take place but she was meditating on that scripture God Was preparing her oh that the scriptures would burn in our hearts today so she's meditating and the prophet said she was thinking on this as she went along the side of the street real early as the sun was Rising she was going up to the public well to get her daily supply of water usually the women come just a little later to get the water but Mary somehow she was led ah you know can I say it this way God his leadership does causes us to do unusual things but I want to say if you feel an unction down in your spirit to do something do it learn to be led of the Holy Ghost if you feel to pray pray don't wait don't put it off can you say Amen learn to be led if you if you watch the brother branham's life and and the story he knew how to be led he could be led down at the will look at angel mama look at the story of there he was supposed to fly out but the Lord told him keep on walking what if he didn't know that voice what if he couldn't obey that voice and I'm telling you God's leading us to a Rapture God's leading us we are his body not we're not here to serve our own purpose we're here to serve his purpose and we must be led by his spirit and if that leading as long as that leading doesn't come out of the Bible amen and be contrary to this Bible you understand what I'm saying learn to be led so she was led to go early that morning broke the routine but God had a reason for it and as she walked along thinking on these things she felt a strange feeling around her you know it's usually when you're thinking about God and keeping our minds on God that God comes close to us I think that's one of the great Troubles of the people of this day we have too many other things on our mind even when we come to a healing service we seem to think well I didn't get a prayer card or perhaps I'll not be prayed for we will never ever say we will never be able to accomplish much as long as we keep thinking those kinds of thoughts quit feeling sorry for yourself maybe something didn't happen the way you thought it would happen but still keep your mind upon God God is infinite God knows he's all-powerful he can move Heaven and Hell just for you you believe it so then the angel of the Lord came to Mary because it was time it was time for Isaiah's prophecy to be fulfilled can you say man and God had prepared her by putting to to receive it by putting the scripture down inside her and she began to meditate she began to think upon it she began to dwell upon it amen see and yet she didn't know it until the angel of the Lord spoke to her that she was that virgin girl that she was meditating about can you say amen and in church I just want to tell you the angel of the Lord is here he has shown himself night after night after night he didn't leave with the prophet that angel of the Lord is still here with his people do you believe that I just believe that and what's he doing he's preparing our hearts and he's letting us know you're the one that these prophecies speak of you're the people that is ready for a Rapture you are the people that the adoption is for you're that people and what do we say be it unto me according to Thy Word we're meditating on it see she didn't know it she's just meditating until the angel of the Lord opened the mystery to her then she saw herself in the prophecy can you say Amen and she only had one visitation and that was enough for her and we've seen the visitation of the Angel night after night foreign us getting your same man and notice she caught the word that came to her ain't that right yes sir she caught it see so now the angel of the Lord that is here Among Us is open the mystery that has been hidden in the mind of God since the foundation of the world and what's he doing it's this day that he is showing his elect that they are the prophecy they are do you believe you're the prophecy you're the prophecy yes sir we are to do the Greater Works we are to speak and our words come to pass do you realize that that scripture that we just read about Jesus speaking to that fig tree and he turned around and said but if you shall say you realize that scripture is laid dormant until this age and the Lord showed brother Branham exactly what he meant by that scripture and he spoke squirrels into existence ain't that right brother random put that scripture with that event he said I never knew exactly what that scripture meant right and there he was needing squirrel I hadn't seen the squirrel at all and then the Whirlwind dropped down and the presence of the Lord come into the woods and he said how many squirrel do you want ain't that right and remember it was the power of brother branham's words and it wasn't brother Branham it was omnipotent speaking through their mortal lips and yet yet God attributed to the brother random speaking for remember he he he got that ones girl and he was so excited he was going to go home I would want to go home too show my wife look at this I spoke this into creation I mean that would have been excited right but God held him to it but you said three why it came out of mortal lips but it could not be defeated because Jesus said my word Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away you say yeah but that was God speaking that was Jesus speaking but what about you deity is in you omnipotence is in you don't take your words lightly don't take this message lightly don't take the promises of God lightly how else are you going to defeat the Devil I'm not crazy it's the word if the word that was spoken by God is in you you shall say you shall speak and whatever you say it'll be done is this all right see we are to speak and our own words come to pass in this day we are the bride of Christ we are what did the prophet say we are if I say we are the final voice to the final age the last word of God that the devil will hear is coming out of your mouth my mouth the mouth of this bride we are the final voice to the final age prophets didn't go yeah okay played the tapes I mean play the tapes you need to play the tapes at your home play the tapes and I'm going to say this respectfully but when your child needs healed you're going to play a tape or are you going to take what is in them tapes and you've received and you're going to speak that word yourself I believe in playing tapes I play it all the time my wife plays at my home plays it we want tapes in our home I don't think it's a sin to play tapes in the church if people want to play tapes in the church I don't have no problem but I am telling you there is a five-fold Ministry but beyond that faithful Ministry there is a people that have received the word for this age [Applause] I know I've kept you and I'm sorry kinda I'm having fun so I hope you're enjoying it I will close though I promise you but I do want to read this one brother Brandon said Mary's womb the physical mind was womb virgin womb why she believed God's word no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless now you could feel the passion in the prophet when he says oh I wished I could get this over are you getting it he says first was her mind before the act ever taken place in her literal womb the ACT had to take place in here to let the Spirit come in to do the rest of the work Glory before the actual spiritual birth can take place the word has to find itself through your mind and believe it he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath every eternal life and shall never come to judgment see or through the tribulation period but has passed from Death unto life that's it oh my see now notice virgin womb her mind a virgin mind to believe God's word you say now look here oh say brother Brian I mean it couldn't be that way it's impossible John Wesley would have saw it and so and so would have saw it uh-huh see sure the devil could have said the same thing to Mary who are you you know why you're the poorest of the city you ain't nothing but a youngin 16 years old 18. how down here packing water out of this pump father dead your mother old blind woman down there how in the world you ever you know how see Anne was her mother we're told how in the world are you ever going to do that see listen to my old mother she is a blind woman but she is a Godly woman now listen what brother Brown's now speaking and saying what Mary is saying see listen my old mother is a blind woman but she's a Godly woman now he's she's putting it back in his face she ain't gonna listen to that she ain't gonna set still and let them things come in her mind she's already heard the voice of the Angel she's received that word she ain't going to receive any other word you with me so now she's going to Bath see but she's a Godly woman and through her lips she's planted a seed in my heart I've read it out of God's word that God said in Isaiah 9 6 a virgin shall conceive so now she is comparing the experience that she had with that angel to what the Bible says amen amen hallelujah can you see the word takes flesh there you are God is going to have a church it's going to be born of the word of God because it is the Living Word of God he said do you see it how you know why see you know what you're going to be called from this from this on see he said you know what you're going to be called from this on you're going to be called see I don't care what I'm called that has nothing about it be it unto me according to the word of the Lord oh could everybody say that today oh if people could really from your heart all of us could say that be it unto me according to Thy word Lord see my really mean it one or two or somewhere out in there it's gonna pick up some predestinated that really means that can you say man it's going to pick you up one of these days you hear saying be it unto me according to Thy word you keep saying that you really receive that it's going to pick you up one of these days brother you're going to see sparks flying right then see when you really get got that there to meet what with that what's coming that irrigation begins to fall on that heart now what was it a virgin mind womb virgin womb for the baby results eternal life amen see Eve a good woman as she was virgin as she was but first she let the doubt come in by the word a devil's lie and what did he do he brought her in contact in the wrong way and what was her child death but Mary's Child was life if the musicians will come brother Brian even gives us a insight on the woman at the well because all we see is the woman coming to the well and the Messiah Jesus coming to her brother rounds to that little lady knew in her heart she had done wrong she knew that she was an ill-famed woman and he says and as she was going to the well no doubt she was thinking of how she had ruined her life and how sorry she was but then she thought someday some Glorious Day the great Messiah will come and when he comes he will straighten us out here's Satan no doubt was beating your mind you little unworthy you little old insignificant thing I'll destroy your life look at you you're a mess you ain't even accepted in society and there it was but then there was a meditation oh some Glorious Day Messiah will come and will straighten us out and then brother Brown said that's why we miss God so much we're thinking about other things instead of him think on him can you say Amen thank on what he has promised for this day think on what he is doing in this day think on what he said about your future in the word of God don't let Satan lie to you and build your future before you of Doom and Gloom foreign God is already predestinated your future he's already declared your future meditate upon it let your thoughts be this what God Said can you say Amen the word is in the bride [Music] why would Jesus promise that we would do the Greater Works if we won't do them why would Jesus promise and give us the last commission to the church and you know what that last commission is though you therefore and preach the gospel to Every Creature Every Nation he that believeth shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils they'll heal the sick lay their hands on the sick they shall recover they'll drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them they'll pick up serpents and it shall not harm them right that's the last Commission and brother Brown said remember he said that he said that so it has to be and he wouldn't have said that unless there's somebody there's going to be somebody that can catch that word just like the loom of Mary could catch the germ a virgin shall conceive she caught it a virgin shall conceive she had that to catch that word before it come to pass she caught it right every word before the Rapture takes place you got to catch it in your womb all these promises you got to catch it in your womb foreign [Music] could catch the germ a virgin shall conceive like a palm tree could be created an old kill an oak tree on a hill his word didn't can you say Amen hey I'm going to read a series of quotes till you're just right fast because I don't want to quit until then but he said let's be positive in our thinking let's believe and he's talking to a a certain church but he said let's believe that this night now the Revival will break in an angless Temple tonight let's believe that this is the night that God will do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could do or thing he will do it tonight don't take no for an answer amen it's when you think those things you create an atmosphere around you another place it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say and you're talking his language then that's what he says you're talking his language right then well I'm not worthy I just don't know if I'll get healed I just don't know if I'm going to make it quit talking his language you're talking that ain't the word and you say man so this is telling us that the devil's language is a language of defeat hopelessness unbelief negativity worry y'all with me brother Brown said never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it when it starts when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from building a roost see from from from roosting see that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on [Music] every thought that comes in your mind don't mean that you don't mean that that's you you're not that person can you say man it's just thoughts that are floating through but discern what thought to hold on to and what thought to let go pass on when you get to thinking about Divine Healing get to thinking about Christ keep your mind on him if there be any praise if there be any virtue the Bible says think on these things if any thought comes by well maybe it just couldn't be sold get off that get up get it off your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your thoughts positive that speaks to all of us don't it keep your thoughts pops don't think sitting there in the wheelchair that you're hopeless and helpless you're not [Music] brother I'm speaking that to a to a person in the wheelchair that he ain't

have prayer service Tuesday at seven so if if any of you would want to come and just to pray with us we would love to have you we've got our meeting coming up and no this could be the last meeting but I I just pray God just comes down in a supernatural way that's that's my goal however he wants to do it it don't matter to me I just want God to come I want him to be there I want I want the people that that needs healing there is no disease too big for our God now I'm only honest in the Pentecostal age I saw the crippled walk I saw the blind sea I saw legs grow out That Was Then I believe it can happen if we are the body of Christ if we have the omnipotent God living in us there is nothing impossible with our God we should set the standard High we should set the bar up and say God you promised now just do it and you say man but we realize all things are possible to them that believe and I I just believe that the blind Dives can be open in our meeting we've seen it we've seen God deliver cigarette smokers just what last year two years ago the man that had cigarette problem could not quit tried to quit and God delivered him never touched a cigarette again during our meetings many has gotten the Holy Ghost my own mother was was healed in the meeting uh three I think three years ago just through the prayer brother Daryl Ward just praying and as he was praying he called out that disease that mom had didn't even know that she had it called it out and told it to leave Martin just still prays in the Lord didn't know she was healed until the next morning I'm Healed and it just never went up for prayer it was just a prayer of a servant of God and rebuked that spirit can it not happen again it can happen so God bless you is our prayer brother will would you or never mind I didn't see you walking out brother Matthew you want to pray [Music]
