With our lives, Amen. And um uh glad that we can look to him. Amen. And everything that we go through. Praise the Lord. And it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord. Uh the musicians can be dismissed. Amen. And um the different ones that were sick over the weekend. Uh certainly good to have you all back and good to have brother Kevin back. Amen. and it was his birthday actually uh Sunday and um so we wish him a happy birthday and belated happy birthday I should say and it's sister Mindy's birthday today so we wish her a happy birthday and u I trust both a good day amen pray blesses them richly many more years until the Lord comes healthy years and uh wonderful years, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And so um if you uh have your Bibles, we're going to turn first of all to the mar to the book of Mark. Amen. The 11th chapter. very familiar scriptures and and you know the the the chapter. So, we're just going to break in and um Jesus had uh spoke to the fig tree, cursed it, and um they came by the next day and saw it withered away. And uh so the 22nd verse, Mark 11:22, and Jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore, I say unto you, what thingsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. Then go to the 16th chapter. Amen. This is the great commission that Jesus left the church. 15th verse. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." And again, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Amen. Father, we are just mortals, Lord. Um and we're in need of you. As your prophet told us, we could take our physical hands, physical strength, turn the pages and read the the words, Lord, uh with our natural eyes, but it would take you to give us the understanding. And Father, may you do that tonight. I pray that you would just just move among us this evening and bless your people not only here present but those that may be watching and Father may faith be uh uh risen in our heart father and that we can have a a deeper walk with you father that's our prayer that's what we long for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says &gt;&gt; amen. You can have your seats. Praise the Lord. And um so the my title uh is he uh uh healing is ours when we accept it. And this will be just something simple uh but I hope it will u help us and encourage. But it it does seem like sickness and disease is attacking the people of God. Um uh and and like never before as as we know there's there's all kinds of uh demonic powers and and it's not only just in the physical realm, it's the spiritual realm, it's the mental um and and in in the spirit. And so, um, brother Brandham in his prayer, he said, "We are a needy people." How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are, we are a needy people. We're walking in a dark world with a great enemy of yours that we could not combat him at all if it wasn't for your Holy Spirit. Therefore, we are trusting, believing, and acting in faith that he'll go before us and make the way clear. So many pitfalls along the road set for our weary feet, but we are trying to follow the bloody footprints of him who overcome death, hell, and the grave. So we are dependent on the Lord for everything that we have need of. Uh I think the longer that I live and and hopefully all of us is that way is uh we see just how small, how little, how helpless we are without the Lord. And and so uh this is exactly what God wants us to do is depend upon him &gt;&gt; uh in in every aspect of our life. And no matter how talented or skilled or smart or whatever uh the Bible says acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways and he shall direct your paths. and another uh place says, "Lean not unto thine own understanding, but in all thy ways acknowledge him." And so uh we know that uh he is our savior. Um but but not only our savior, but he is our redeemer and he's our healer. He's our provider. He's the way maker, our deliverer, our victory. And so this is why we pray to him uh because uh it's an acknowledgment that we need him. He's got the answer. &gt;&gt; And so we pray to him not just for mere ritual or something to do or it's just a Christian thing. Uh but but we truly believe that he has got what we have need of and and and he does. He's the one that can supply uh what is needed. So, so I I believe that the prayer of a Christian uh should have results. Do you believe that the prayer of a Christian should have results? It it should or we're just praying for not. If if prayer is simply just to to to have words and just a ritual that we go through, then then our prayer is nothing. It means nothing. That's right. &gt;&gt; But prayer is the channel in which we talk to God. We make our petition known and then that prayer should get results. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what the Bible says. God answers prayer. Do you believe that? And and so he answers prayer. Brother Ram said he answers every sincere prayer in his own way. So then in our prayer, we do not bind God. We do not uh uh attach strings to God and say, "Well, now this is the way it's got to be. This is when it's got to be done, how it's got to be done, where it's got to be." It it it we we do not put strings and and and and and limits on God, restrictions on God. We just make our petition known and then leave it up to God to answer the prayer any way he so chooses because he knows best. Ain't that right? And so God has a way of answering prayer. That's what the prophet says that God has a way of answering prayer. So as Christians we should expect results from our prayer. Amen. Uh every one of us we should if you prayed for it expect results. Amen. Uh uh that's the way it should be. Now there's nothing negative in Christianity. That's what the prophet said that it's all positive. Amen. Nothing negative in Christianity. And so when we pray, we're not praying to a heathen God. Amen. But we're praying to a living God who has made the promises and given us these promises. He's made promises. He's made them to us. Amen. And therefore, we should expect if we're praying to a dead god, then forget it. Just just go through ritual. Amen. But if you're if we're praying to the living God, then we must know and believe that God heareth us when we pray. God is not only able to answer our prayer, but he will answer them. Now the Bible says we are heirs of promise. How many believes that I am an heir of promise? So then every scripture in the Bible is promises. uh to name one. Psalms 103:2 uh bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all he uh who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases. So this is a promise that we are heir to. Ain't that right? It's not just words written uh uh down for us to look at and wonder about, hope for. Amen. and ponder. But it's it's it's a promise that we should expect. We are heir to that. He is the God that healeth all my diseases and and forgiveth all mine iniquities. And so uh James another promise 5:14 is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. Ain't that right? And the prayer of faith shall save the sick. Ain't that right? So that's a promise. Amen. The prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. So that's another promise that we are heir to. Now, brother Brandham, he would tell us every minister of the gospel has a right to pray for his congregation. And they have a right. Everybody say, "I have a right." They, you're the congregation. They have a right to believe God and be healed. So divine healing doesn't belong to one man or one group. It belongs to all the people. Ain't that right? another place he says there ought to be a healing campaign in every church all the time going on everywhere. So then then it's God's desire to heal. Amen. And and if God has commissioned us to come together as believers, then there's there there there should be a healing campaign going on. Amen. In other words, healing taking place and and deliverances taking place and and uh the move of God, amen, moving among the people of God. Ain't that right? Because wherever God is, a uh demons cannot stick around when the presence of God and and he promised that I'd be there where two or three are gathered in my name. Amen. I will be there in their midst. Ain't that right? So then the church of the living God has been commissioned to lay hands on the sick and and they shall uh recover. Amen. They've also the church of the living God has been commissioned. Amen. To cast out devils. Amen. These signs follow the believer. Amen. And so whatever devil you're facing with and dealing with or whatever, Amen. you have every right to cast that devil out. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. through your prayers. Amen. And and uh so we we know the prophet tells us that the word devil or demon is a means tormentor. That's the English word for demon is is is uh uh tormentor. And so we know that all the sickness comes from the devil. Amen. And and and so it's it's a tormenting spirit that afflicts our our body. Amen. And we know that there's sickness of the body, there's sickness of the soul, there's sickness of the mind. Amen. And and it's a tormentor. Amen. That that he's he's attacking in every way. Amen. The Bible or or brother Brandham says hell, the lid of hell has been lifted off and demons are pouring in. And so it's it's spirits of sickness. It's spirits of diseases of all kinds. And it's attacking uh uh because we're we're made up of body, soul, and spirit. Ain't that right? And and now there's one thing that he cannot touch if we're born again. And that's the soul. The soul is sealed off to where Satan cannot get to that. But but he attacks us in our mind. He attacks us in our body. He attacks us in in in any any other way. And but the Bible says, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world." Ain't that right? So the world is getting wicked and and we know that. But the prophet says, "On the other hand, you fail to realize the church is getting more powerful &gt;&gt; all the time." And I just believe that. Ain't that right? And so uh uh this is why I believe that a Christian has authority a amen over every part of uh of of is he's like I said he's made up of three parts body soul and spirit. And he doesn't just have authority over the soul. He has an authority over his body. He has an authority over every part that Satan would try to hinder. Amen. Do you believe that? And so um now now people act as though you know God doesn't want to heal uh doesn't want to save doesn't doesn't want to deliver and and and they they they sometime maybe we we think that we have to beg God for things and that we have to get God's attention and somehow amen he just doesn't seem to be hearing our prayers and and all that but that's so far from the truth. truth. Amen. Uh the problem, you know, the prophet said there's a lot of Pentecostal chickens and not eagles. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of Pentecostal chickens and the denominations are giving them chicken food. He says, you know, they give them chicken food, denominational creed. They lived on that and that's all they know. They're earthbound. Ain't that right? See, there there's people that go to church, they're earthbound. And and because they have been fed chicken feed, Amen. And and denominational creeds and they don't know how to raise their feet and rise in the presence of God and claim victory. &gt;&gt; They don't know how to shout the praises of God. They don't know how to accept divine healing. Now, now the prophet tells us that healing is simple. &gt;&gt; Healing is very simple to accept, to take. But if people don't know how to accept that healing and he says, why is it? Is because of the way they've been taught, what they're feeding on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He goes on down, I'm afraid that these big cities need a lot of teaching. I'm sure they're just worked up on emotions and so forth. So, they need real scriptural teaching on how to receive healing. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, we're not we're not eating chicken food. Not this message ain't chicken food. It's eagle food. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It's eagle food. And so, therefore, we we are a different class of people. and and brother Brandham spent a great deal teaching us how to receive our healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if if if God would send us a prophet, I thank God for opening the seals. I thank God for for you know the spiritual things that we have seen and and the spiritual signs. But but but a teaching that that God sent through that prophet and that is how to for us to receive our healing. Amen. Remember we were we were eating chicken food. We were we were all of these things and we didn't know we didn't know how to receive our creeds didn't help us and Pentecostal ideas didn't help us. But a message came along to help us, teach us to know how to receive our healing. &gt;&gt; So we need to take note as to what he taught. This message is important. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The message of the hour is important. Now in the message faith is the substance which is in 47 he said I'll try to explain to you the best of my knowledge the reason I'm here tonight and how that you must approach God uh uh to receive your healing. He said I've suffered much and I know what it is to be sick and I want to help you and I can if you'll just believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. So don't just listen to the message and just say, "Well, that's a good sermon." Da da da. And forget about what he's saying. Take in what he's saying. He says, "I can help you." &gt;&gt; That wasn't just for that crowd in 1947. God left it on tapes &gt;&gt; so he can help us &gt;&gt; and teach us how to accept our healing. If the Bible says, "Greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world," we're not a defeated people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, our opening scriptures have something in common, and that is we must believe in order to get results. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prayer is to get results. If you don't expect to get results in your prayer, don't worry about it. Don't pray. Uh you're just you're just as uh you're not getting anywhere. But when you pray, expect results. When you have the minister to pray, expect results. Amen. When when you gather in your home and you pray, expect results. Amen. It it it's just that simple. We ought to come to church expecting results. Do you believe that? Amen. If we don't expect results when we come to the house of God, well, then it ain't going to help us. But the word is us. The word is supposed to benefit us. Amen. Just like tonight, you're not here just gathering in vain. There's a word that is to help you expect the results of it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Cuz even brother Brandham tells us we'll not leave a sermon uh the same way or a church service the same way. We'll either go out worse or we'll go out better. See, so we expect results when we come to the house of God. When we pray, we expect results. So we we find amen that no man can get anywhere with God without faith. So then believers expect results. Why does believers expect results? Because the word of God says they take God at his word. &gt;&gt; I can promise you something and you and you don't have every right to expect the results of that. I'm a man. I can fail. But God never fails. God never fails. Can you say that with me? God never fails. He will never ever ever fail. &gt;&gt; I can fail as a preacher. You can fail as a mother, as a father, as a deacon, as a singer, whatever. But God never fails. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So therefore, believers expect results because God never fails and they take God at his word. Now the prophet said a believer is the seed of Abraham and and and so they act like he acted. He's the father of faith and and we are the royal seed. We are the seed of faith. His we come the offspring of his faith. Not a natural seed like the Jews. We are offspring of his faith. Ain't that right? He believed God. Amen. And and we are the offspring. And so therefore, we are the seed of Abraham. And we we have the same faith of Abraham. And as Abraham believed, so do we believe. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, God is is sovereign in all of his ways. You believe that. &gt;&gt; Now, it's easy to say that, but we have to if he's sovereign, then we have to understand that that he doesn't work when we want him to work. He doesn't he doesn't he he's sovereign. We can't tell him what to do. We can't rule him. We can't toss him around. Nobody orders God. &gt;&gt; He's sovereign. &gt;&gt; But he is tied to his word, &gt;&gt; obligated to his word. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So now he works. God being sovereign works in many different ways. Uh and and this is why we see miracles and we see healings. We see miracles, we see healings. And and and the prophet taught us there's a difference in in receiving a miracle and receiving a healing. Ain't that right? A miracle is done spontaneous. It's uh it's it's it's it's done immediately. You know, we can uh uh uh brother Amos, you could be blind and and you come up for prayer, we lay hands on you and and and all of a sudden your eyes come open. That's a miracle. It was done immediately. Ain't that right? Amen. But then divine healing is a miracle as well, but it is a process. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So now, Brother Bram says, if you had a cut on your hand and you done everything for it and nothing, it just keeps getting worse. See, after a while, you put something on your hand and it be to help it. It didn't get well. It's getting well. Everybody say it's getting well. It didn't get well. You got a cut. You put something on it and it starts mending. It starts getting better. Well, it didn't get well. It's getting well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But you can't say, "Well, I'm not well. I'm not well. I'm not I don't know what I'm going to do. I I just don't know." But if you're starting to see results, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; If if there's something there, you know that the medicine's helping, &gt;&gt; then then you know it's getting well. So now, Brother Brandham says, and I want you to really listen to this. When the curse of sickness is taken off of you, &gt;&gt; it's not every time a miracle, &gt;&gt; right? Not every time it's a miracle. &gt;&gt; But now the the curse of sickness when you pray &gt;&gt; when that believer prays and you rebuke that spirit. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's done. But now we we find there are times again that it happens the the miracle or the uh the that you you get uh spontaneous results. I'm as glad for them. &gt;&gt; You bet. But sometimes the prophet says the curse is just gone and the cure follows it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The curse is gone. Good. &gt;&gt; When you pray, &gt;&gt; you believe it. You've spoken. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You have every right to cast that devil out. &gt;&gt; And the curse is broken, &gt;&gt; but the cure follows. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So many times people easily stumble at when they when they pray for God to heal them and they don't see a spontaneous miracle. Then they tend to think that God isn't answering the prayer. God didn't hear that prayer. So we got to pray again and we got to pray again and we got to pray again and and and somehow one of these days he's going to hear my prayer. Don't you believe he didn't hear that? He heard you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Did he not hear you the first time you you prayed? &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Sean. &gt;&gt; Did he tell us how many times did we got to pray? He just said, "Pray." &gt;&gt; Whatever you ask for, if you believe it, you'll have whatever you desire. If you'll believe it, you'll have it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so see, so they they tend to and and this is human and and this is where we needed teaching to show us how to receive our healing. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; So, we tend to think that God isn't hearing our prayer or that he doesn't want to heal. I want it, but God ain't answering. He just doesn't seem to be helping me. I don't know if he wants me to be healed. &gt;&gt; I just don't know. I I don't know where I'm at. You know, I'm here struggling and God somewhere's up there doing something else and making revivals for everybody else and I'm suffering and I prayed, I begged, I'm I keep praying. I've been prayed a thousand times and and I just don't know what to do. I what what else, you know? Well, see, the prophet says I can I tell you what the prophet says. He's more more willing He's more willing to heal every person in the tent tonight, in this building tonight, wherever. He's more willing to heal than you are willing to be healed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's in pain. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's suffering. You're the one whatever and you want to be healed. &gt;&gt; But no matter how much you desire to be healed, God wants to heal you more than you're you want to you want to be healed. &gt;&gt; Now, that's what a prophet said. He's more willing to give you the Holy Ghost than you are to receive it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; The prophet said he's here. He's here to heal the sick and afflicted. Another place he's here to heal every sick person right now. &gt;&gt; Want you to understand way off the wild blue yonder. He's right here. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He says in another place, there is nothing impossible with him and he will bless you greatly if you'll just let him do it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Another place says there's no need for the daughter of God's church to be laying sick with sin. There's no need of unbelief in the church. We should have all of that out. We've seen God do too much in this age. We've seen God. We a prophet stood on this earth and declared his presence is among us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So there we should have all the unbelief out with these new things that God sending us. We could reach up right up and grab it and say, "Amen." Walk right away with it. There's plenty of bomb in Gilead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Jesus says, "Ask." Everybody say, "Ask." &gt;&gt; Ask and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Now come on church. We know what English means. &gt;&gt; Not ask and you might receive. Not ask and I hope you'll receive it. You know, I'll tell you to ask and good luck. Ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full. This is the God of heaven coming in human flesh and giving us a promise. and you're heir to that. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3:20, it says, "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us." &gt;&gt; Dy's not in heaven. It's in us. Right? It's in every believer. That's &gt;&gt; so the power that workketh in us, there's got to be a power working. And that power works by faith. &gt;&gt; And he's able to do anything abundantly. Anything that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. &gt;&gt; If that power is laying dormant, you ain't going to get nothing. But if that power is working by faith, he's able to do exceeding abundantly all that you ask or think. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now if if we don't have the immediate results then again we tend to think that we need to go through another prayer line. Well I I got prayed for last year and they're having another prayer line. So I'm going to go back into it because I didn't get healed on this other one. And so um uh you know so so I need I need to go you know to another or or they say well I got prayed for by brother so and so but nothing really happened there. I'm going to go I'm going to go to another brother so and so and maybe he'll he'll help me. Now you understand brother Brandham dealt with that with the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They they would bounce from old Roberts then they'd go to Jack Co. then they'd go well in order. You know what I mean? But they they would go to TL Osborne, then they'd go to this, then they go to brother Brandham's meetings, then they'd just bounce and then and well, I got prayed for over here, and I didn't get nothing, so I'll go over here. I didn't get nothing, so I'll go over here. They didn't know how to receive their healing. &gt;&gt; Now, in a prayer line, Brother Brandon prays for a lady saying, "Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, may my sister be healed." Now I pray for her through that allsufficient name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Notice what he says to her after the prayer. Go rejoicing. Everybody say, "Go rejoicing." &gt;&gt; Saying, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her she was healed. &gt;&gt; He told her, "Go rejoice and send thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; He's teaching how to receive healing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he addresses the congregation. Now, what I don't get is why you don't rejoice and praise God when you come through. &gt;&gt; Why in the world are you coming through? &gt;&gt; Why are you coming through the prayer line? &gt;&gt; See, and so he said, "Why don't you just rejoice and praise God when you come through?" Now, that's what I can't understand, church. Don't you know that God's just as much God one time as he is another? Now, someone said to me not long ago said, "I don't understand it." Well, now listen. You know I'm not balling you out, don't you? He said, "You know I'm trying to get a truth over to you." Do you believe that? You realize that? See? Well, he said there wasn't a one pass, but what I seen, what was wrong with them? There wasn't one that come through the land, which what I seen. If I start into a vision, what does it do? It just scatters them. There you are. See, the people go by, the people go by and they'll come by and say, "Yeah, yeah." And you catch it. See, he says, "See, they say, "Well, no, I never got it." That's the reason they give prayer cards. Cuz if you don't, you'll come right back in the line again, and then you'll come back again. He says it just weakens your faith. Each time you get weaker and weaker, weaker and weaker. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So if they didn't get immediate results the first time, then they go back around back in the line. Then they get prayed for again and they need to get the results again. So they go right back again. So he had to have prayer cards so to keep all that from happening. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, so we get prayed for and then we judge whether we are healed or not by our symptoms. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; We we we come to get prayed for as it's like rubbing a rabbit's foot &gt;&gt; for good luck. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then when we don't get what a spontaneous result, then we like, well, I don't well, one of these days. One of these days, right? See, and we're all guilty of it. See, so now Pentecostals judge the result of their healing by how they feel instead of looking at the word of God. Promises don't shift. Promises of God don't change. It's exactly the way God said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham, he was over at um uh the the brother in Chicago, Joseph, just had a meeting. He had a he had a week full week of gospel teaching on how to be healed. And so, Brother Brown says, "I wanted to go and f go to brother Joseph and find get a report to see how many went away last night saying, "Well, I still got it." Now, he just went through a whole week of teaching &gt;&gt; on how to be healed. &gt;&gt; And he says, you know, that they all come back in and they didn't get the immediate results. Well, I still got it. He says, "And you'll probably always have it if you feel that way." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; See, so so they weren't accepting their healing &gt;&gt; because they were looking for immediate results. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So when you pray, you must believe that God answered your prayer. the moment you prayed. &gt;&gt; Whether you see results or not, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says, "If quickly you receive it and accept him and praise him and say, "Thank you, Lord. Let it be done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk right out of the building tonight perfectly well. &gt;&gt; Well, that's good. That's that's the way we'd like things, just spontaneous. But if you're not, you're as good as well if you've accepted your healing in the seed form by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whether you you got immediate results or whether you just got prayed for, you do not see no results, you're healed just as much as the one that got the immediate results. &gt;&gt; True. True, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. &gt;&gt; If you accept it in seed form. So don't forget, you rule by the word. &gt;&gt; You rule. Everybody say, I rule &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; I have dominion. &gt;&gt; Come on. I have dominion. &gt;&gt; By the word. &gt;&gt; Not by my feelings. I do not rule by my feelings. I do not rule by my s symptoms. I do not rule by nothing else but by the word of God. God gave me the word to rule &gt;&gt; to have dominion right &gt;&gt; over every devil. I don't care what devil you're facing. You have the authority by the word and the word only. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, brother Ram talked about the adoption and we believe that we're in that age of adoption and the child comes into adoption and uh because he's shown he is proven to be about the father's business &gt;&gt; and and th this child uh he comes into adoption because he conducts himself the way the father conducts himself. He thinks the way the father thinks. He handles himself the way the father handles. You know, he handles situations the way the father handles situations. He believes like the father believes. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and so his character and his behavior is molded by the tutor's teaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm going to say it because I believe with all my heart, this message is the message of the tutor. &gt;&gt; It is not brother Brandham's message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was just the instrument. &gt;&gt; That's right. It was God speaking through that man. &gt;&gt; This message is the tutor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there was people that didn't know how to receive their healing. Pentecostals and all the denominations. They didn't know how. But it was time for adoption. &gt;&gt; It was time for the sons of God to be made manifest. And so there had to be a tutor to teach us sons and daughters on how to handle things. &gt;&gt; Surely. So the tutor gives the child tests to see how he does. Uh the Bible says every son that cometh to God must be chasened, tried, chastised. &gt;&gt; And if if if if he can't stand ch stand chastisement, correction, then the the Bible says he's a a bastard child. He's he's illegitimate. what he said. &gt;&gt; See, so the prophet said, "God tries you." &gt;&gt; So can you say that with me? God tries me. &gt;&gt; God tries me. You You cannot be a son or daughter of God without chastisement. And and we know that God does not God does not uh uh uh correct us or he in other words he sends us through things just as that tutor sent the son that child through testings and trials to see how he would conduct himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, Brother Bram says, "If we walk up and say, I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God, that he died for my sins and rose again the third day. He was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, the chastisement of my peace was upon him, and with his stripes I am healed." When you say that with a confess all your sins and your iniquities and your abilities and all that you have, lay it on the altar. Then there's nothing uh uh there there with nothing in your arms. Satan's going to shoot every dart at you. He can &gt;&gt; when you confess that he's your Lord and Savior and you confess that Jesus Christ is my healer. He is my redeemer. Satan is going to shoot every dart. &gt;&gt; He says, "But then if you turn aside from that," now remember because Job is our example. Job's our example. God let Satan at Job. God let Satan inflict Job with with sufferings. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yes, &gt;&gt; he did. See? So, so when Satan is shooting darts at you, don't you think he's doing something outside of God's permission? &gt;&gt; It's a test. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Sure is. &gt;&gt; He said, "But then if you turn aside from that and say, well, maybe I didn't get saved. Maybe I didn't get healed." Then turn away from that. The Bible says you are illegitimate children and not the children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He goes on, God sends those trials to test you, to prove you, to shake you up, and to give you a new hold. &gt;&gt; You remember, there is no weapon formed against you that's going to prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. &gt;&gt; That is what we are heir to. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, you remember we talked about Abraham being the father of faith and and we being his seed. Brother Bram said, "If we are if our father," speaking of Abraham, "usted God and took a promise and impossibility and held on to it for 25 years before there was ever it was ever manifested, getting stronger all the time, his faith getting stronger. See, his seeds just like the father. No matter what happens, when we're prayed for, it's settled." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; The power of prayer &gt;&gt; church. There's a power in prayer. &gt;&gt; We ain't just going through the motions. &gt;&gt; If God said it, we can believe it. It settles it. &gt;&gt; So he says, see, when we get everything out of the way, met all requirements, get everything out of the way, then ask God and stand there knowing you're going to receive it. &gt;&gt; Now, he says, God tested Job like that. He tried Job &gt;&gt; and see what kind of a reaction he would find in him. But when he took his sheep, took his ox, took his camels, took his children, I'll see what Job says now. See, and he and Job said, "The Lord gave the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." The prophet said God found what he had told Satan he had in Job. None like him on the earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe there is a people that God is telling the devil there's none like them in this leoty and age. None like them. Go ahead, try it. Amen. And he he allows the devil to shoot darts at us and all that. But we've been taught by the tutor. Amen. And we're standing there. We think like the father. We're acting like the father. We're handling it like a father. like our father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So as the child goes through testings, the tutor starts to see the father in the child's conduct and behavior. He starts seeing the mirror of the father. &gt;&gt; Like wow, that's exactly like you know Jim Bob would do. Oh, he'd be proud of his son. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he sends off the the report to the father. See, and and so therefore through the testings we are resting in the same word that our heavenly father rested in when he said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Remember, all of God's works was finished before the foundation of the world, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he rested. &gt;&gt; Why? Resting in his own word. Now that word is in every son and daughter of God that when you speak, &gt;&gt; you got to rest. &gt;&gt; Got to rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, notice, Brother Bram said, you don't have to wait now for an evangelistic service or a person coming through praying for the sick. You have a right yourself. &gt;&gt; The greatest thing that God gave the world outside Jesus Christ is the Bible. Do you know what? The word of God will defeat the devil any place. Everybody say any place. &gt;&gt; Anywhere. &gt;&gt; Anytime. &gt;&gt; On his own ground. &gt;&gt; Bring it on, devil. &gt;&gt; I'll defeat you anywhere, anytime, any place, on your own grounds. &gt;&gt; Why? We've been given the word. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to be honest. I I just thank God for the message. The tutor is the one that gave us the word. &gt;&gt; If it hadn't been for a prophet come to the earth, we'd just have creeds. &gt;&gt; And we certainly couldn't defeat the devil on that. It never would bring the manifestation of sons of God. But this message is bringing on the manifestations of sons of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Do did you know that the word of God alone Jesus made it so simple until the weakest Christian could do it? Gord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another place, Brother Bram says healing is when you in your heart know that God has done it for you and nothing can wave from it. &gt;&gt; And that's when you're going to get healed. You're going to get well. &gt;&gt; Going to get well. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't look at the symptoms. Can't look at the negatives. Can't look at all that stuff. I mean, it may even get worse, but in in in your heart, you know it's done. It's settled. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I will not question God's intentions. I will not question his motives, his sovereignty. All I know is I done exactly what he told me to do and it's done. &gt;&gt; Did you know that Jesus we've said it before, but Jesus didn't always perform uh spontaneous miracles on on on the people? &gt;&gt; Yeah. uh John 4:46 it says there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum when he had heard when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death and Jesus said unto him except you see signs and wonders you will not believe the nobleman saith unto him sir come down my child die lest my child die and Jesus sth unto him, "Go thy way, thy son liveth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't even go down there. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Thy son liveth." Then inquired this man of them the hour when he began to amend, right? Or actually he says, "Yeah, uh uh I I skipped." Jesus saith unto him, "Go thy way. Thy son liveth." And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him. &gt;&gt; And he went his way. And as he was going uh uh now going down back home, his servants met him and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. &gt;&gt; Then he acquired of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, "Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him." So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him, "Thy son liveth." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he began to amend. &gt;&gt; He didn't jump out of bed and say, "Woohoo." It wasn't spontaneous. But the word had already gone forth, thy son liveth. &gt;&gt; It was as good as done. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so the prophet said, "Now the man wanted Jesus to come to his house and heal the boy." But Jesus didn't grant him his request. &gt;&gt; But yet he believed what Jesus said was the truth. &gt;&gt; Thy son liveth. &gt;&gt; Well, what about us? Well, we have the promise in 1 Peter 2:24. Who is he? Who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were were &gt;&gt; healed. &gt;&gt; Were healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, there is just as much power in that promise &gt;&gt; as there was in the words that Jesus said to that man, "Thy son liveth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; I thank God for spontaneous miracles, and I think we've all had them in in throughout our life. &gt;&gt; But notice what Brother Brandham said. If God come down and healed me positive, right out with a miracle, it wouldn't be as great as it would if I can see the promise of God. Take it into my heart and stand there. I can say Jesus is now healing me for I have accepted his word. It's in my heart. He is now interceding for me before the father. I shall be well. &gt;&gt; There's what God loves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is standing there on his word and say it's right. He's healing me now every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's greater &gt;&gt; than for God to come down and instantly heal you. &gt;&gt; Hello. because you're being tested and you're proving that you believe God, that you're taking God at his word. You're disregarding symptoms and the pain and and and the feelings and everything and you're standing on thus sayith the Lord. He's healing me. I shall be well. I don't care what you're saying, Satan. I don't care about the thoughts. I don't care how I feel. God's word is right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on now. So when when we are sick or we've got a need, I'll ask you when we pray, are we looking for a spontaneous miracle or are we just simply praying because God said to ask and we shall receive? Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I think we should get prayed for simply because it's in God's word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should get prayed for simply because it's in God's word. &gt;&gt; Not because I'm looking for a certain way. I'm not judging all of that. God said to ask and I'm going to ask. The prophet said ask for big things. Did he not? &gt;&gt; So you cannot ask too big for God to where God says that's enough. &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But don't judge it and don't try to make God do something you want him to do. Just follow his word. Ask. Doubt not. You shall receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, it shouldn't disappoint us when we pray and we don't see immediate results. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't act as though God didn't hear our prayer. Whether God answers our prayer in the way of a miracle or a healing, that shouldn't concern us. We know that it's already done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So notice when we when we speak to the mountain as Jesus said, if you say to this mountain, be thou be thou removed and doubt not. So when we speak to the mountain, are we expecting immediate results? Is that where our faith is? Well, then I got to see it move immediately. &gt;&gt; But what did Jesus mean when he said, "If you shall say to this mountain, be thou removed, be thou cast in the sea, and it shall be done." The prophet says, "You look at the mountain and say, be thou lifted up and thrown into the sea, &gt;&gt; and then in your heart believe that what you have said is taking place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all you got to do. &gt;&gt; You spoke it. &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You got the word. You're an heir to promise. &gt;&gt; So, all you've got to do is just believe. That's your That's what we're responsible for is believe it and speak it or speak it and believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Believing it's already being done. &gt;&gt; Maybe he says, he goes on, maybe just one little grain of sand, &gt;&gt; one little bitty grain of sand began to move through the whole mountain. Come on. &gt;&gt; You might not be able to notice it, but there's something in your heart says it's being done. &gt;&gt; You shall have what you say. That's the faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; He said many of us are prayed for at night. The next morning, we say, "Well, there's no difference. I don't feel any different." That's where we are failing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Why? Too much uh uh chicken feet. Come on now. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, we get prayed for the next morning." Well, there's no difference. I I don't feel any different. That's where we are failing. That that doesn't have to show one thing. &gt;&gt; But if thou believest in thine heart that what you say is being done, you shall have what you say. That's it. If you believe that what you say is already taking place, I don't have to feel it or see it. I believe it. And that's the reason it's taking place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; He says you'll have the desires of your heart. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Well, what if I confess and it just doesn't happen? Then I'm going to be embarrassed. Oh, no. No. That's the wrong way to think. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not taking God at his word. &gt;&gt; You're not looking at yourself as the power that you have as a son of God. &gt;&gt; If I'm taking God at his word, then you think God's going to disappoint. &gt;&gt; No, he won't. &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; This just come from a burden. One time a man in Houston went through a prayer line and brother Bram talks about it and he says we had a line just coming through like we did last night saying God bless you had a little prayer and this man passed through and he was jerking so I don't know if he had pausy I don't know if he had what dad's got Parkinson's or whatever but he was jerking like this and he passed through and there had been a woman in a slow line down there that had been healed with a go go goer and she had an umbrella walking up and down the street screaming and going on. A little fella passed by. I said, "God bless you, my brother. You believe?" He said, "With all my heart." I said, "Go home now. Your faith will make you whole." Passed on by like that. And here he come back around in the line. He said, "Brother Bram, you told me I was healed and I'm still jerking." I said, "Brother, you told me you believed me." He said, "I do." He said, I said, "You're not acting like it." I said, 'You're to believe what I told you.' He said, 'Well, I do believe it.' I said, ' Then why are you coming back telling me you wasn't healed? See how easy it is? See? He said, "Well, Brother Brandham said, am I healed then?" I said, "Yes, sir. Just as you believe you are." &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't just healing. This goes for everything. &gt;&gt; There's some of you that that that are praying for your wayward children. It's got to be the same way. You're praying for your spouse. It's got to be the same way. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; See, so so he says, "What? What? Wh Why are you coming back and and and telling me you wasn't healed?" See how easy it is? He said, "Well, Brother Brandham, am I healed then?" I said, "Yes, sir. Just as you believe you are, did you believe he heard my prayer?" He told me if I'd be sincere when I prayed, get the people to believe me that nothing would stand before the prayer. You believe that? That's why Brother Bram said, "You got to have faith in the in the confidence in your pastor, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Because he said, "If you ain't got confidence, then he ain't going to help you. &gt;&gt; You pray whatever. He ain't going to help you." Well, we got to have confidence in one another just as much. &gt;&gt; This is why we we can't disrespect one another. This is why we must treat each other and and and watch how we joke toward one another and watch how we cut up and watch what we say and because we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We are. Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Do do you believe that?" And he said, "Yes, sir. I believe it with all my heart." I said, "Go on." He said, "Okay." He started away a few minutes. Here he come back through the line. He said, 'I haven't stopped yet, Brother Brandham. I said, 'Well, now look, I'm not talking about when you stop. &gt;&gt; So now he's trying to get to him. I'm not saying you're healed when you stop the jerking, &gt;&gt; right? He was looking at the um you know at at his his symptoms &gt;&gt; and judging his healing by the symptoms, &gt;&gt; right? He says, "You might not stop for a week or 10 days or 3 months or four months, two years." I said, "Abraham waited 25 years on his. Is that right?" And scripturally, you know it. I said, "You believe what I told you." He said, "Well, I don't get it, brother Brandham." I said, "Brother, the angel of God who is declaring that I told the truth told me this. if I could get the people to believe me and be sincere when I pray. He said, "Oh, I see it. I see what you mean. I've already got the healing. I'm just waiting for it to stop." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "That's right." &gt;&gt; He said, "All right." He said, "I'm healed." And he went on and you know, he kept saying, "Praise the Lord. I'm healed." And he was healed. faith took a hold &gt;&gt; because he would no longer let the jerking and the symptoms hinder his faith. &gt;&gt; He looked beyond the symptom and he saw the word of God. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. I was prayed for. I believe in that prayer. I believe God hears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, if it isn't a spontaneous miracle, then you begin to say, oh, I don't guess. Maybe I better go back when brother Roberts comes. Well, maybe brother Brandham, he'd give me another prayer card and I'll go through. He said in another place, you should accept your healing. Everybody say, I should expect my healing or accept my healing. You should accept your healing. If you don't feel one bit difference in six weeks from today, you are still to accept it right now. Stay right with it and hold it as your personal property. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Stay right with it. Now, that's what he wants. &gt;&gt; That's what God loves. &gt;&gt; I'm sure he does. &gt;&gt; Stay right with it. &gt;&gt; Stay right with it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm getting weaker. Stay right with it. &gt;&gt; It's getting worse. Stay right with it. &gt;&gt; Oh, but my children are just get just you're getting further and further like devils. Stay right with that promise. You are heir to promise. &gt;&gt; He's a promise. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; The moment you can accept your healing or salvation, Brother Brham said, if you're walking down the street, that's when you're turned around. The moment you accept it, you just quit letting the devil fight you over it and quit going back and forth. Just die out to where you can't see the symptoms. You disregard the symptom. You're looking at God's word and said, "I'm healed." &gt;&gt; That's it. I'm healed &gt;&gt; from this day forward. God, I accept your word. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; And start thanking God. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the moment you start turning around." &gt;&gt; See, so it's knowing how to accept our healing. &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice Jesus in speaking of this leodyian age, he says, "I would that you would either cold or hot. I would that you was either cold or hot. And brother Bram says about this. He says, "If you are to believe God, then believe him." &gt;&gt; No chicken food about that, is it? &gt;&gt; If you're going to believe God, believe him. &gt;&gt; If you're going to serve him, serve him. &gt;&gt; If he's God, then he's God. &gt;&gt; Right? Believe him. &gt;&gt; You don't He says, "If he isn't God, then just walk away and leave it alone." You don't want to act like something that you're not. He said you've got to be what you are. So in your heart, if you can truly believe and say, "I am a believer. I do believe God." How many believes God? &gt;&gt; How many is a believer? Well, see now, we all go through testings. I'm telling you, we all go through testings. And and if we let Satan start putting questions in our mind and and start looking at everything around us, then that's when we're going to we're going to go off the out of the will of God. We're going to go off somewhere else. You got to stay with what that word says. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "They that are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Don't be led by your feelings. Don't be led by circumstances. Don't be led by nothing else but by the word of God. &gt;&gt; So he said, "See, he says, now I do believe God." Well, if I believe God have a need and I accept it right now, that settles it. Don't say no more about it. Just keep on praising God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's how I got healed. He says, Satan said, "You're not healed. You're not a bit different." Now, Brother Brown's telling his own story now. So, he knows what he's saying. He said, "Satan told me, you're not healed. You're not a bit different." I said, "Stick around." &gt;&gt; Come on, stupid devil. Stick around then. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you want to hear me testify, you just hang around. That's all you have to do. I will sure burn your ears every day cuz I'm going to sing his praises as loud as I can. And he left me. &gt;&gt; He left. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what you got to do. Instead of just getting in the moldy grubs, instead of getting in depression, instead of just thinking of all the woe is me, lift up your head. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Let the devil talk. Right. &gt;&gt; Zip his lip. &gt;&gt; And then we start talking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus, for healing me. Jesus, I'll never forget what you've done for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you just start singing. You start glorifying God. Amen. There's just something bubbling in. Amen. Well, Satan's got to leave. He hates that. Why? Because you're not just a mortal being. You're a son of God. You're a son of God. There's a deity speaking through there. The word of God, faith is speaking now and he's got to leave. &gt;&gt; So if you have been prayed for, then don't question if God has heard your prayer. Believe that he heard it &gt;&gt; and that it's already done. &gt;&gt; So then we change our actions, right? We change our we change our confession. We change everything. If I've been prayed for, I've done exactly what God says. Prophet says, "If we've met God's requirement, our sins are under the blood, everything is made right and there's our heart ain't condemning us." Now, come on, church. You say, "Well, I I know what Satan tells a lot of time." Well, well, see, God ain't answer your prayer, so you got to sin or something. And we're trying to dig up sins. We're trying to dig up stuff. Well, the Bible already said, "If our heart condemn us." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your heart will condemn you. If you are a believer, there will be something. And and that's where you got to just as the prophet said, "Father, if there's anything that I've done, if there's anything I need to make right, let me know." But if your heart's not condemning you, then the Bible says we have confidence toward God that he heareth us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the only way God doesn't hear your prayer is an unconfessed sin. But if your heart doesn't condemn you, then you have confidence that God has heard your prayer. Ain't that right? And and the Bible says, Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, being fully persuaded that what God had promised, he was all to perform. Therefore, it was imputed unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Now, notice in Romans 4:23, now it was not written for his sake alone. These promises was not given just for Abraham alone that it be imputed unto him, but for also us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offense and was raised again for our justification. Now notice brother Brham reading that scripture he goes, "Oh brother, I could just hit the devil in the face with that scripture for 365 days a year. and say, "You're a liar. &gt;&gt; There's the word. I am healed." &gt;&gt; Just by that one scripture. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; One scripture. &gt;&gt; And you got more than just one. &gt;&gt; More than just one. &gt;&gt; So slap him in the face with him. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. This all right. Brother Bram said if someone comes up and puts it on you, he said if somebody went down here and done some some kind of a something to you and let you get well, it doesn't inspire you. But here's what it is. He that believeth I am healed now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; In other places, now some people goes by feelings. I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved. He says, "The devil can beat you around the stump every day on that. But I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved. I'm saved because I met God's requirements. God called me. I accepted it. And by faith, I believe it. Whether I feel good, whether I feel like it or not, I am anyhow cuz God said so." And accepting your healing, lady, it ain't how you feel. It's what you believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to let you go. The one thing I have found if you go just go through the prayer lines listening to them and things of what brother Brandham taught us and taught to people is that praising God, rejoicing and being happy is tied to our healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm going to read a series of quotes where brother Brandham instructs the individual or congregation on what to do after he prays for them. Now, if you was healed before, you know how to accept your healing, then go and rejoice and say, "Thank you, Lord. Be made well." Everybody accepting your healing, raise your hands up and say, "Thank you, Jesus, for healing me. Thank you, Jesus, for healing me." Give him praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't doubt a bit. Go home and get well. Get well. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't say you are well. And it wasn't immediate results. He said go home and get well. &gt;&gt; Sure. I believe you're all right. Just walk on out there rejoicing and giving praise. See, if thou canest believe, all things are possible. God bless you, my brother. Go rejoice and don't pay any attention to how you feel. Get well. God have mercy on our sister. He's praying now. and heal her of this nervous breakdown in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, you going to get well, sister? You You're not going to worry about it no more. See, it's gone. That's all. That's right. Go away rejoicing. See another You believe sister Dorsa. Is that right? Fine name. All right. Now, go rejoicing Dorsa. Father, have mercy upon sister and heal her of this high blood pressure. And she's run down, father, and weak. I pray that she'll go home today and be well in Jesus Christ's name. Are you, sister? You You now believe it. Uh, Lord God, I now believe you healed me with all my heart. I go rejoicing for it. Is that the way you feel about it? Then go right on your road rejoicing then. See, that's how you accept your healing, right? See? Amen. I send this handkerchief this afternoon to that little boy for the healing of his body. In the name of Jesus Christ, may he and his mother be healthy and may and happy many many years for your glory. Amen. Go rejoicing now sister. God bless you. Another go mother doubt nothing. Go rejoicing. See and see. So when we pray we are to believe that God hears our prayers. Ain't that right? Brother Bram says God stooped down and picked us up and redeemed us and now we are above the angels right now. Which is it? An angel's a servant. We're sons and daughters. Which is the most thought of, your servant or your son or daughter? Prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel because he's a son. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. if the musicians will come. He said, "I don't believe this side of eternity, how we'll ever realize what you are, the position that you are, that God has placed you spiritfilled people. You are sons of God. Why an angel's a servant. You're a son. An angel can only bring you a message, but you have to act. You're the actor on the scene. You're the son." See, the angels are servants to bring you the message. Said, "Here, I brought this message for you to do so and so. This is from father. I bring it to you." That's all that that's all it is. Amen. Your sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Another place go now rejoicing and happy saying thank you Lord and you shall. He said you will get well. Now sir, as you go rejoicing, go be happy. Sing songs all day long. He said, you're that quiet type of a person which would hurt you a little later in your life. You go on and just start singing hymns and rejoicing, testifying of your healing, and it'll leave you. God bless you, sir. So, even even Satan will try to use our quiet nature to keep us from being healed. &gt;&gt; But God wants us to rejoice, &gt;&gt; testify. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham praying for a man said, "Nothing is hid before you, Lord. You know all things. God be merciful. Forgive him of every trespass and take this desire of smoking away from him and heal him tonight. Hear the prayer of your humble servant. May his nerves quieten. May he go away tonight with a great faith in God, feeling strong, meeting the oppositions tomorrow, saying, "Oh, how I thank you, Lord, for you're healing me." See how you meet your opposition. See how you meet the devil. Amen. Thank God for the healing. When he says you're not healed, say, "Oh, yes, I am. I'm healed. Oh, God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." Remember John Ryan? That's how he met his oppositions. Amen. He He was kind of the same way. He got prayed for and come back in the line and he said, "I thought you said I could see." He said, "You can see. Do you believe me? Do you believe me? What I just told you?" Oh, yes. you know, and I think he come around again. Finally, Brother Brand realized he was a Catholic and needed something to do. So, he says, "I tell you what you do. You go around and you start thanking God for your healing, right?" He said, "The next night, he was trying to preach and as he was trying to preach, John was up there in the balcony." He said, "Hold it. Hold it. Hold it." You know, and he says he stopped me right in the middle of my preaching and he said, "Thank God I can sing." Amen. See, and then he goes on the streets. He's saying extra, extra. He's selling newspapers, read all about it, and every once in a while, thank God I can see. He said he'd done that for two weeks. Meeting the opposition. Meeting the opposition. You know, the devil was fighting him that he was meeting the opposition. But, "Thank God I'm healed. Thank God I can save. Thank God for doing working a miracle. Thank God for my healing." He said he got down to that barber shop with that old skeptic looking at him said, "Hey, you know, John, I heard you went to a healing meeting the other night." Yes, sir, I did. Well, I heard you got prayed for. Oh, yes, sir, I did. Well, I heard you going around people saying you're praising God for being healed. Yes, sir. He said, "Well, you can't see." Amen. Instead of trying to argue with him, he raised his hands up, said, "Oh, thank God I can see." And at that moment, them scales came off his eyes and he went running down, amen, the street with the barber running behind him. Why? God honored his faith. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. Meet the opposition tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Thank God I'm healed. Thank God I'm saved. Thank God for saving my children. Thank God for answering my prayer. Thank God for giving the desires of my heart. Thank God. Thank God. I know I can't meet the devil on on as a person, but I've got a promise that I can meet the devil with. I've been taught on how to receive my healing. He said, "If you need healing, here's the seed in the word. The word of God is a seed. Put it in your heart. Don't dig it up every morning to see if it's sprouted. Put it in there and leave it there. It's God's business to bring forth a harvest. You just leave it there. Water it by faith. Praise every day. Thanking God for it. &gt;&gt; We ought to be a people praising God every day. Every day. Every day. You're just feeling rotten. Just praise God. Amen. You're having problems, just praise God. Amen. I don't care what it is. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. We ain't victims. &gt;&gt; We ain't victims. &gt;&gt; That devil's scared when we get up to God. &gt;&gt; He hates children of God just laying there or or standing up praising God. He would rather keep us tired and sleepy and and everything else. But if I got to just flutter my eyes and just raise up my hand one more time, I'm going to thank God for my healing. [Music] Well, how many's thanking God for your healing? &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. God is the creator of our bodies. We've already been given the promise. Cast them devils out. [Music] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He has no right over us. He has no right. Absolutely no right. He has no right over your children. Has no right over your body. Has no right over your mind. He has no right. I don't care if you're thinking you're going to have a nervous breakdown. He can't do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're that the the God that's in you is greater. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Then we act upon it. Thank God I'm healed. Thank God my children are saved. Thank God my husband, my wife is saved. Thank God for healing. Thank God for victory. Thank God for deliverance. God, I just thank you. You You said you come to you boldly before the throne of grace. I've done that as a son of God, as a daughter of God, and now I just give you praise. I just honor you, God. I just thank you. I'm taking you at your word, Lord. You're God of heaven and earth. You're sovereign. You're supreme. You're king of over everything. Lord of all lords. I thank you, Lord Jesus. I thank you. I ain't defeated. There ain't a one of God's children defeated here tonight. We're victorious. Now, we need to take God at his word and just start thanking him. Be happy. Go rejoicing. Can you say amen? Don't worry about things. Don't worry about your defeats. Don't worry about your what whatever you're facing. Don't worry about your children. Don't worry about your sickness. Don't worry about it. You've got an heir to your heir to promise. I'm thinking of Psalms 37:25. David said, "I have been young and now I'm old. Yet I've not seen the righteous forsaken, nor a seed begging bread." &gt;&gt; He is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed. Depart from evil and do good and dwell forever more. For the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his things. They are preserved forever, but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever. The mouth of the righteous speaketh. Wisdom speaketh the word, and his tongue talkketh of the judgment of his word. See, the law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide. The wicked watchth the righteous and seeketh to slay him. That's that old devil. See, the Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he's judged. Wait on the Lord and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. When that devil's power is broken, you're going to see it. Amen. I have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a a green bay tree. Yet he passed away and lo, he was not. Yay, I sought him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man. Behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace, but the transgressor shall be destroyed together. The end of the wicked shall be cut off, but the salvation of the Lord of the righteous is of the Lord. He is their strength in the time of trouble. Hallelujah. We're heir to that promise. Do you believe it? Can we just stand to our feet? Amen. What song? Oh, let's sing it now. It's already done. Oh, it's already done. Hallelu. It's already done. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. Victory is won. It's already done. Oh, sing it like you mean it now. Oh, it's already done. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. Hallelujah. He's my chief physician.

Just giving God the praise and the honor and the glory. Hallelujah. Oh, it's already done. Can we go up again? Oh, they're already saved. Hallelu. They're already saved. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. Yeah. It's not up to us to try to figure it out. It's just up to us to believe God and just go rejoicing and praising him. Oh, it's already done. Hallelu. It's already done. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. The victory is won. It's already done. One more time. It's already done. It's already done. Hallelu. Glory, glory, glory. Oh, the battle is over.

We're so thankful, Father, for the word that you have given us in this age that we could take it and defeat every devil of hell any time, any place, anywhere on his own ground. We are not victims. You have made us conquerors. Oh, we thank you, Lord, for it. We rule by the word of God. I pray that you would bless the people. Father, bless them. Grant their hearts desire when they meet the opposition tomorrow. Lord, may they have a song of praise on their lips in their heart and go rejoicing and being happy and not worry about it again. Not say a word about it again. Just knowing it's all taken care of [Music] and the cure will follow. Father, we thank you. We love you. Bless the people, Lord, for Sunday, Lord, as they would come to service to worship you. I pray your spirit be be here with them. Help us, Lord, keep us safe upon the road as we travel. Lord, bless the meeting there in Oklahoma. We just give you all praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. God bless you saints is our prayer. We love you. Amen. Oh, thank you Jesus. [Music] Thank you, Jesus. [Music] You're dismissed in the fear of the Lord. You want to stay and praise him, that's just fine. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, blessed be your name.
