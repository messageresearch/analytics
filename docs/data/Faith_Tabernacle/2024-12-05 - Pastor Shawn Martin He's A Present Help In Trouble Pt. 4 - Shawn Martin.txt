better stronger greater than you man how many believes that our God is stronger bigger greater than anything that you going through amen and I'm so glad for that amen praise the Lord I tell you we would even have Hope of Victory if it had not been for the Lord amen but we certainly serve a mighty God amen amen and uh the musicians can be dismissed it's uh just good to be here in the house of the Lord this evening on a Wednesday night and uh good to have brother Micaiah with us amen and uh enjoy that song uh this evening he's uh quite the singer and uh I think he sounds like his brother Jose I mean uh Isaac and uh so but it's good to have Brother Sam with us amen as well and uh we certainly love and appreciate Brother Sam and his family and um we um have got um uh we want to keep Shel in our prayer and uh that the Lord will just continue to help him and he's not wanting to eat and um it's been a real struggle uh for brother shemiah and sister Bethany and um he's gotten used to uh shemaya and um you know when they were in the hospital uh um sister Bethany had to recover uh from everything that she was going through and and so brother shemiah was the one one up there constantly feeding feeding the baby and helping the baby and just because um uh sister Bethany just wasn't able to do that at the time and uh so a little guy has uh kind of gotten used to shamai and uh so it's been hard for him the baby to switch and so he won't hardly take the bottle uh it it has to be brother shemiah got to hold him got to talk to him you know and um I you know uh I was telling them I said well I said that's kind of way it was with Daniel um Daniel wouldn't take nobody he wanted me and uh you know after a while I got to think there might be something wrong with him but and uh but it just the way it was you know and and so uh uh so it's it's been it's been really hard uh for them uh br has got to work and um and yet he has to come a lot of times come home uh so that the baby will eat uh but it's getting to the place that even though he won't even take his bottle at all and um so with that in mind if he keeps losing weight uh then they're going to have to put a feeding tube in his stomach and uh of course you know brother Shaman's sister Bethany uh just really pray praying they don't have to do that and um and I understand that and so I um we we really want to just go Before the Throne of God uh that God can just touch this situation turn this thing around and he has he has blessed brother shemai and sister Bethany with this baby that is a miracle baby and um and Satan has uh just been fighting all along but I I just don't believe he's going to win and uh so we want to keep um uh shuel in our prayer and also um Daniel had forgot to mention brother Beal brother Beal has been sick and um that's why he's not been in in the services past uh few times and um um and he just needs our prayer um I don't know all what is going on I just know you know his Thro and uh sister Britney the other day sent him uh went and gave him some food and he couldn't talk and uh but just just really struggling in his body and uh so uh maybe we could just go to the Lord in prayer uh for brother Beal and shuel and um we just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word as well let's bow our heads our hearts father Lord Lord we know you to be a living God father you have shown yourself to be real time and again and we're Believers father God and we know that no problem no problem is too big for you our God is greater bigger stronger than any devil in hell father you see these needs that I've mentioned and I pray Lord that you would turn the situation around touch your servant brother beill father and I pray that you would make him whole he's been so dedicated to you and Father's Loving You serving you God and I pray that you would be merciful and touch his body I pray that you would touch Lord just a house away from Brother Bill Shel laying in there Lord and God just return that appetite to him whatever that situation is Lord I pray that you would turn it around and father just Bless That Home Father that that baby could start eating and gaining weight Lord and may He just find Comfort Lord or whatever it would be Lord with sister Bethany and that uh he would feed from her Lord and father you you know the situation and I pray that you would give brother Shmi and sister Bethany just a rest Lord in her body in their mind I know they're worried about that baby but father you have you've given that child to them it's it's certainly a miracle father and we thank you Lord ahead of time for just answering the prayer and I pray that you would bless the reading of your word tonight Lord we need you father and I pray that you would just anoint this place and father just give us the words to say give us the liberty father Break Every Chain father whether it be in sickness mental health or just discouragement whatever it would be may may you just come and move supernaturally among us we ask it in Jesus Christ name and the church says amen and amen uh we want to look at the book of Psalms we've been reading this a couple verses here uh past couple services but Psalms 46 and um we'll start at the um the first verse but uh it says for God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear we will not fear can you say that with me we will not fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof salal there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early amen may God just add the blessings to his word you can be seated and um if I guess to itle it he is a present help in trouble and uh the word help it means to Aid to assist to lend strength or to lend a means towards affecting a purpose uh to to assist to secure to lend means of Deliverance as to help one in distress or or to help one out of prison to give or provide what is necessary to accomplish a task or satisfy a need so help now now we we know that God predestinated a people he's got a plan he's got a uh a way and and um um he's he's got a Outlook and and we've read the scripture many times where God says I I know the plans that I have for you and uh my thoughts toward you it's that to bring you to a a uh uh uh an accomplished end to bring you to a a purpose and an end so we're not just here floating in life and and uh that God has purposed God has decreed us uh to an end and now he's saying I am going to be a help uh I'm going to meet that need amen because you got to remember as Paul would tell us that that the creature we that that uh we were subject to vanity uh not by not willingly but by reason of him who also subjected us to a hope so so the god that decre de Creed us to Salvation the god that decreed us to to uh uh an eternal end of peace and joy and and said I I go to prepare a place for you and and and the these things are already there uh God's not waiting for you to to uh uh see what you're going to do before he gets a place prepared for you he says I'm going to prepare a place and and it's a it's a brother Bram even talked about you know the Bible talks about a prepared City and he said that it's a prepared City for a prepared people and and so so we we already know that that that we we've arrived uh uh them he called he justified and them he justified he's already glorified but we were subject to vanity we were subject to sin we were subject to diseases we were made subject and and the prophet gives us the reason why is is that could make himself known and cuz we would never know him as a as a Healer except we needed a Healer we'd never know him as a savior and so all these attributes could not be made manifest to us if God had not subjected us to vanity to to weakness to Frailty to all of these things and and and yet that may have looked like that's the that was our start if if you want to say it out in life it it our our start was was weakness and and our start was a a vile nature but but that never stopped what God decreed it never detered amen God's thoughts for us and so in this time of mortality he all he says I am a help I'm I'm a present help ain't that right I will give I will provide I will assist whatever needs uh uh to meet that need I am that present help amen and so uh uh uh uh this word present uh just looking it up uh in in Webster it's now existing amen it's not used to exist or uh future tense going to exist it's now existing being in view amen God being a present help he's put himself now and showing that he's in view he's he's existing now amen and and and then brother brandham would would would would say it this way he is always present to help in time of trouble he's always present whether it's night day no matter what valley you're in what trial you're in what your failures your your your accomplishments what whatever it would be he's always he's always present Amen to help in time of trouble trouble now you know uh uh this this this um uh you know I I I we are truly blessed to know what we know we're we're truly blessed to to be uh uh to to to know uh what we we to have what we have and uh but brother Brandon would tell us that for nearly 2,000 years uh uh Christ uh or the Holy Spirit has Bound by these denominational Rivers amen and and so God men have made God a a god of History uh uh a god of yesterday and and so now now uh uh for many they don't say that there is no God uh uh but but what they do say is that what he did in the Bible days he doesn't do today amen and and and so and and it really is is truly amazing how the devil Works uh uh there because uh he can he can actually get one group of people to believe that there is no God at all that that God does not exist and it's just an imagination and and uh uh uh all of these things and and yet he himself knows that there is a God and yet he can convince people some people that there actually is no God amen and and yet James 2:19 says Thou Bel that there believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble so so the devil's exactly right with you he knows that there is a God and yet he can convince some people uh uh to actually believe that there's no God at all and and yet see so if he can't get people uh a person to believe that there is no God and and and these things then he gets them to believe that that okay there is a God but that God can't do what he used to do amen and and to think that there are people who literally claim to serve God and yet will tell you that that God that rolled back the Red Sea can't do it today the god that raised Lazarus from the dead cannot do that today and yet they claim to serve God Amen see so you see how the devil Works see and and in order to uh uh uh get uh people to believe this that that there is a God but yet he doesn't work miracles like he used to well then he he has to he has to downplay the word of God to them he he has to make this as though it is just a fiction of man's imagination as as though you're just reading another West book or a a a Cinderella Once Upon a Time thing and and and it's just uh it's just you change it however however you want to change it because it really never happened and and so um uh uh but he downplays the word of God to them and he convinces them that not all the word of God is truly inspired because if you believe the word of God is inspired you cannot put God in a god of History but you have to recognize that that God of yesterday is the same God today amen see but see it's it's the uh uh so he convinces people that this word is not all of it is inspired it's the same demonic spirit that that believes uh that tells us that uh you know we can't believe all the message amen and and some of it's inspired and some of it's not and all of that and so there are ministers that actually uh uh uh ignore uh certain scriptures in the Bible because they do not believe them to be inspired amen just like I've told you before I had a a a man that was a a a teacher of the Bible and of a certain denomination but he he sat there in in in in Pennsylvania and told me that uh uh Hebrews 13 and8 is not inspired it doesn't even fit in the chapter of of uh of 13 it's it's some man put it in there and and he's trying to tell me that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever and I just looked at him I said sir you've come too late I said you see all these young people I I I could call every one of them and tell you the Miracles that God has done even in my own family I said you've come too late I said you see that girl right there I pointed the hand I said God created a hip amen uh when she needed a hip and I said I've got scientific proof to show you that God done that amen and we went on and on and on Amen but see uh uh it it's a it's hard to imagine that that there are people that do not believe that Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever uh is is inspired of God see and so then then I've come to the conclusion that that it really doesn't matter Amen to Satan whether you don't believe uh or or maybe where whether you believe that God exists or not amen uh it it really doesn't matter amen because uh uh uh uh Satan has practically accomplished the same thing either way you get a person that doesn't believe in God uh that God exists and you get a person that doesn't believe that God can do Miracles today and and God can't do anything that he used to do well then you come up to the same conclusion the same spot and amen and that is Amen to get you not to believe that God is a present help in the time of trouble amen Church we're in the in the greatest hour of trouble Amen on the face of the Earth and we need to know that there is a God that is present today that can heal that can save that can deliver amen that can raise from the dead that can heal whatever when the doctors have given hope there is a God that will offer the assistance that you need when you need money when you need groceries there is a God that can help in time of trouble amen but see if a man doesn't believe in God Amen he'll never see God as a present help if a man looks at God and says yes there is a God Amen but he can't he doesn't do the things that he used to do today amen uh that he did back then then he'll never look for God for help can you say amen amen see so if God doesn't exist then how can he be a present help to you if God doesn't do what he used to do amen then how can he be a present help to you ain't that right see so the result of a man believing either way amen is he will not believe in the Supernatural God will not man will not believe in the Supernatural see God is Supernatural ain't that right so to believe that God exists you have to truly believe in the Supernatural amen but his actions are Supernatural That's that's what a prophet said not only is God Supernatural his actions are Supernatural so to believe that God is the same yesterday today and forever you have to believe in the Supernatural amen you you have to see so uh uh you have to believe it amen see and you must believe in order to experience Jesus Christ as being a pressing help amen for Jesus said all things everybody say all things all things are possible to them that believe that's the key all things are possible Amen to them that believe amen he does not uh uh uh put a stipulation on what God can do he just says if you can believe it it's possible it's it's possible if you need if you need a new heart it's possible if you can believe if you need a blood transfusion it's possible if you can believe if you need your blind eyes open amen it's possible if you can believe I've seen the lame walk because it's somebody amen made it possible because they could believe I've seen the blind eyes open because somebody believed God and it became possible to them I've seen men and women raised from uh off the deathbed when the doctor said there's no hope and God would raise that person off the deathbed because somebody believed it and it became possible amen man to them see all things are possible to them that believe brother brandom says God can only help you as your faith will permit him to operate in you I'll say that again God can only help you as your faith will permit him to operate in you so the doctor is not the absolute amen the banker is not the absolute amen society's not the absolute the politicians the governments whatever is not the absolute amen they'll assist you in whatever they can and usually you know as far as even in the government they'll assist you if they can get something back or if they can put a little bit more hands and in in your in your stuff you understand what I'm saying that God Amen he's a present help in the time of trouble amen and all of these other things are natural helps the doctor helps with natural things uh amen the banker can loan with natural substance uh amen everything and and a preacher even can help you in a natural way visit and and encourage and musicians can play in a natural way natural things it's natural but God's help is a supernatural can you say amen and if he can work in the natural amen let God come amen and work in the natural amen that that's what he does ain't that right yes sir so Satan uh he doesn't want people to believe in the Supernatural that's this whole goal amen he so he'll get you to believe that God doesn't exist or he'll get you to believe that God doesn't do what he used to do he just doesn't want you today believing in the Supernatural amen that's right why because if you believe in the Supernatural then you'll expect Supernatural things to happen amen then you your your mood doesn't get dictated by problems amen you're you you your your your your attitude or your outlook isn't dictated it doesn't become negative uh uh Outlook it doesn't become a negative testimony it doesn't become a negative thing just because the situation is negative because you believe in a supernatural God and you know he's present and so now you expect the supernatural to come any time at anywh in any place yes sir see so so if you believe in the Supernatural then you'll accept super expect Supernatural things to happen that's why brother Brown said when you come to the meeting you get what you expect when you wake up and you face that day you'll get what you expect amen you say well I just feel in drewy I just feel discouraged but let your expectation be in a supernatural God Amen that is present to help you in the time of your trouble amen see the person that believes in the Supernatural is the one who welcomes God in his or her missed and makes him feel welcome because God is Supernatural it's fine for the Natural Things amen but but if God doesn't come supernaturally our music doesn't do us any good the preaching doesn't do us any good amen to have a building and to have the pews all patted and and to have everything just right it doesn't do us any good if the supernatural God doesn't show up amen and so when people doesn't believe in Supernatural amen then they won't make him welcome they're satisfied with just natural things amen just a natural service just a little old Fine Thing a little natural sermon a little natural thing a little you know it's just natural things amen but we want God to be welcome amen and and you you have to believe in the Supernatural to make him welcome amen that's exactly right can you say amen amen yes sir so if you believe amen so the person that believes in the Supernatural is the one who welcomes God and then the prophet says wherever God is the supernatural takes place so then he is a present Supernatural help in the time of your trouble can you say Amen now notice in Zechariah 14:6 it says and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall neither be clear shall not be clear nor dark so down through the years the prophet would tell us we've had enough light to see how to get around uh one place just another just enough light to join church and to put your name on a book and to ask Christ forgiveness another place he says we've had a day 2,000 years where we've organized joined churches built great things great spires and all of these things see just enough light just enough just to see to get around just to believe God for salvation and yada yada and and things like that see and so in in the history of of the church um uh uh and and and we see that Satan has solded he's he solded in the beginning uh the seed of Discord God sold his Pentecostal seed amen it on the day of Pentecost and then Satan come right after there and solded a a seed of discrepancy amen and that's how the false Vine got its start in the church and notice what brother Bram said the false Church organized and humanized the government and the word and and fought the true Christian so they humanized the government humanized the word took all the supernatural out of it you understand what I'm saying in other words they started to make God a god of History right then amen by humanizing amen everything see and and and so it it's exactly what Israel done amen uh uh in the Old Testament they humanized uh leader ership see God was leading them and they chose a a man a carnal man ruling over them instead of the Holy Spirit the prophet said see God had been leading his people through this consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet Samuel right amen and and and then the people said no we don't want you no more we want a king and so it really Disturbed Samuel the prophet and he and he went to the Lord and said Lord they rejected me you know and and the Lord says no no no they've not rejected you they've rejected me that I should not Reign Over them see and so they they chose they wanted a king a political power to rule over them instead of the Holy Spirit to rule over them see and so brother brandom says this and and and and notice now he says you see the one difference the one difference between Israel and all the other nations amen was God ain't that right the only difference between you and and and and and somebody else is God the the only difference between America and and all the other nations is a pat God the first and foremost in in in in their lives amen see that that's what made the difference see and and and so uh uh uh he says you put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but uh uh but the world with God's name attached to it see put God aside put the Holy Ghost aside put the supernatural aside put the supernatural action of God aside and the church is nothing but the world with the name of God attached to it he says the world and the church are all of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God everybody say the spirit of God makes the difference see it doesn't matter if you call yourself Christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without that Spirit you are a reprobate you are none of his see now uh uh in another place he says now God and he's talking about Israel choosing a king over over God's leadership through a prophet he said now see God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ he said but they got ahead of him think of that they got ahead of him and they chose a man to lead them without having God in him see and so they got ahead of him Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of the word head of God the word amen see so the the false Vine chose a political power over the leadership of God and and that started in the first church age and then by the time the Third Church age got here Amen brother Brown says men were humanizing salvation instead of leaving salvation to God as it was in the first church in the day of Pentecost when it says and and 3,000 Souls were added and the Lord added to the church daily now it's taken that away and they've humanized salvation see Jonah 2 and9 it says salvation everybody say salvation is of the Lord salvation is of the lord it's just like the psalmist said My Help Cometh From The Lord see salvation is of the Lord and the prophet said see men in the third age amen had turned from this truth having cast aside the doctrine of election and open wide the church door and their Fellowship to any and all who subscribe to their tenants never mind the words see and so here he says today churches are filled with mental believers who claim to be saved on the grounds of joining a church they endorse the Virgin birth the shed blood going to church taking communion and they don't yet have a new birth he said but the truth be told no man can Tru truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ himself yes I'm still talking about him being a help amen you see a man cannot even believe under righteousness a man cannot believe salvation a man can't truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God without having the very faith of Jesus Christ can you say amen so brother Brandon would tell us human faith is not enough amen just to believe that God exists is not enough just to believe in the in the morals of life and and that's not enough amen just to believe in the law of God is Not Enough see you can have that and have and human Faith believes in these things but he says it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands can you say Amen now we're talking about the faith of the Son of God do you realize that's a living faith that's what a prophet said it's not just human Faith it's actually a living faith a living faith for in Galatians 2:20 Paul would tell us I live I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so Paul is now telling us that God was a present help to him amen that I'm not just doing this by my own faith I'm not just doing this by my own will I am living by the faith of the Son of God and if you notice Paul did not say that he was living by the faith in the Son of God it wasn't just faith in God but it was by the faith of the Son of God see so it brother BR would tell us it was the faith of the Son of God that had given him life and kept him living in Christian Victory can you say Amen see so he had the very Faith Of God Amen God was a help to him in other words God imparted his nature into Paul he he imparted himself into Paul Amen to where now it wasn't a human faith it was a Divine Faith amen God in the in the beginning stepped on the platform of nothing when there was nothing there it was all void it was Darkness but God by his faith said let there be amen and a world come into existence light become into existence everything that God desired by his faith because he believed that what he said would come to pass can you say amen and so now that same faith is imparted into the church to where they believe in a supernatural God that whatever they say there is a God to back it up whatever they need there is a God that can make it happen amen if you need healing you say well I'm just about to die but there is a God if you could just live by the very faith of the Son of God he's a pris help see so the false Church brother Bram said had denied that salvation was Supernatural and they still are denying this amen see they think it's all about joining joining a church it's all about shaking a preacher's hand it's all about being a good person a good citizen doing good things for for the community and and all these things see but brother Brown said see there's been a day there's been a day that people has joined Church made denominations just enough light to see we'll have a church we'll build this we'll build a school we'll build a hospital we'll educate we'll have a seminary see they've had enough light to do that another place there's been a day of organization denomination just enough light to see to get around put your name on a book accept Christ as a savior see but notice go back to Zechariah 14 and look at seven it says but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light oh aren't you glad for that it shall be light in other words our our our the the the day is going to get brighter that our light to be able to see it's not just going to be to see enough to do a little bit of human work and and accept Christ as our savior and all that but now it's illumination light amen that we're able to see him as to really what he is can you say amen that's right see that's why there's a Bible believing bride upon the Earth today is because there's been a light he has come up he showed up as a present help in the time of our trouble Amen to where we can believe God for all things that's what brother Brandon was saying he said Lord in his prayer he said Lord I believe we're living in the time where you're preparing the people to believe for all things and I just happen to believe for all things not only do I believe God for my salvation I just happen to believe God so God powerful is his blood that he can take every sin away to where I can stand in his presence Justified as though I never done it and not only do I believe that I just believe that there is a God that's going to change this vile body amen and change it and Quicken it amen from Mortal to immortality I just happen to believe that I just believe that we're going to be caught up to meet him in the air I just believe that there is a God that is present that's going to Quicken the dead and the Dead's going to rise yes sir Amen in evening time it shall be light amen so we're not living in a dismal day we're not living in a just enough light to barely see get around no we're living in the evening light now which which goes along with Isaiah 60 arise Shine for thy light I'll say at this way thy personal light has come thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee what a time what is it it's the revealing of the son of man ain't that right so again now notice the we'll go back to this quote the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denomination Rivers for almost 2,000 years just enough light to get around We join the church we build this we build that human humanize it's humanized salvation humanize this and humanize that see amen but he says but it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message see the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time can you say Amen now what does this mean son of man revealed brother Braham said this revealing is the same it reveals Christ in the very same way that it he was when he walked the the Earth see he's revealed the same way as he was when he walked the Earth the same son shining in the west as it did in the East the same sun shining he said with the same power the same Holy Ghost doing the same thing that he did back then can you say Amen the light has come thy light has come can you say amen that's right see so then we're we're seeing that it's the supernatural God working in the same Supernatural way that's why it does not whatever the obstacles that we are going through whatever we face it doesn't phase us because we know the god that walked on water back in that day he can do it again today amen the same God that raised Lazarus that had been dead 4 days and the prophet said corruption had already taken the nose amen the eye sockets or the ball eyeballs and everything but when that Son of God stood there and said Lazarus come forth death corruption everything amen had to bring back El Lazarus amen Lazarus didn't come just a halfway man amen just what remained left of him everything was restored back to him at the command of God can you say amen and what God was back then God is today a present help now notice what was Jesus manifested for the prophet said to show God he was God he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved the church that he now this is why he saved you this why he went to Calvary this why he done all that 2,000 years ago is for today that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God hello in these last days when he gets the preeminence preeminence in the church the position his his place in the church so the revealing of the son of man is that somewhere over here here and the church somewhere is over here the revealing of the son of man is Christ in the church him taking his place in the church how many's part of the church Supernatural God coming in the churchu with Supernatural actions so brother Bram talking of Christ he said Jesus so seen it so seen it so was so so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made and I want to just stop here you are so perfectly born for this day well at least I hope you believe that you are so perfectly born for this day just as Jesus was until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed can I say that again he was God's revelation Jesus Christ was God's revelation ain't that right that was 2,000 years ago one man one man was God's revelation for the fullness of God dwelt bodily in him ain't that right remember Philip says it would suffice us if You' show us the father he said have I not been so long with you and and and still you don't know who I am he that has seen me has seen the father come on now ain't that right yes sir and you are so perfectly born for this day ain't that right yes sir church the church is God's revelation God revealed son of man same God revealed in human flesh in one man so is it the same God revealed in the Church of today a body of people a many member body ain't that right so now no notice he says see so he was God's revelation God revealed now he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed so look at it he talked about the three-fold revelation of God first to express himself in Christ then Express himself through the church first to express himself in Christ God in a man now God in the church yes sir I'm still talking about present help in a time of trouble yes sir got to know where he's at God in the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them and the third thing is to restore the kingdom to its right position that failed by sin by the first Adam now notice see uh back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them and fellowship with them so so you can see where we're at in time you you can see what God is doing now he's already got a church do you believe it he's already got a church he's not purchasing a church he's already purchased the church he sent a prophet in this day to bring us back so we can have full preeminence in the church yes sir this is the evening time we're at the end of time can you say Amen now notice Malachi 4 42 I hope this all right but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness everybody say the son of righteousness unto you that fear my name that elect shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings oh my amen amen amen prise the Lord now notice we're not talking about a physical healing brother Brown said the healing part there will not be a physical healing as you think and some saying somebody's got a sickness and it'll be taken away from them that that that's what he's doing now in typ but the whole creature will be changed can you say Amen we've been waiting for a change remember we're living in a time of trouble like never before and the world is getting worse and worse and worse the the age is getting darker and darker there ain't no politician that's going to help this thing but God is a present help in the time of trouble the reason why people look to politicians and and denominate they don't believe in the Supernatural they don't believe in all of that they've been so far away from God in their experience that they really don't believe in it but church when you see these things begin to come to pass lift up your head your Redemption draweth not what was the thing you to look for is the son of man being revealed coming with power and great Glory yeah you're going to see the earthquakes you're going to see the signs of trouble you're going to see everything that we're seeing right here but one thing that you're going to see is the son of man being revealed prise the Lord he came with power I believe and you say Amen as we talked about Sunday he came with the camel L are coming with the camel power Beast because he had a purpose he come to find that cried for Isaac and he wasn't going to leave without her he going to take her home can you say amen and he wasn't going to just he had a he had a camel for her amen and that Camel she watered amen and that Camel that she watered took her back to her Isaac and the prophet said the power that we're watering with our Praises amen is going to take us back home with him can you say man why he's come has a present help in the time of trouble to Deliver Us from this whole world to deliver us amen from The Temptations and the evil and the oppression amen of this world this world is not your home yes sir that's good so he said see what he's doing now is en tyght the whole creature will be changed this Mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump into youth amen well how will it be done I don't know but it'll be there see so he comes with healing in his wings for the changing of our body amen not a natural thing going to happen it's a supernatural thing that has come to us so brother brandom says in several places when the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings it'll be totally impossible to hold those bodies in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the Son of God another place the sun seems so n seems to be many times far away but when he begins to shine see the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings and every life no matter where it's buried how deep how far in the waters or in the Sands in the Rocks it'll rise to the glory of God Amen in in in another one in the last days the clouds everybody say the clouds has been cleared back away from the church and the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings and bringing forth the power and evidence of his resurrection that He Still Remains the Son of God Amen that's what this message is done is taking all these denominational clouds and clouds of unbelief clouds of Doubt clouds of Creeds away from the church amen and the son of righteousness has come with healing in his wings Glory Glory Glory you love him amen we just quoted the scripture refer ref to it Luke 21:27 it says and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud thaten in 1963 cloud of angels not a Thunderhead cloud and it see this son of men coming in a cloud with power and great Glory not political power not religious power not human power can you say Amen but a a a supernatural power amen see Power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your head your Redemption draweth not start looking for your Isaac can you say Amen you you ain't going to a wedding you've already been married to The Virtuous Son of God ain't that right amen so you're not going to a wedding he's taking us back to a wedding supper amen amen it's true so this power is healing power Supernatural power quickening power why it's time for deliverance you're living in a time of Deliverance you're living in a time of the Third Exodus now I I I have to say I believe he's come can you say amen and and maybe we can go more into that later but he has come and not only has he come but he is here he's here do you believe he's here so where is he at Matthew 18:20 where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in their midst as a present help see your your gathering tonight is not in vain it doesn't matter how many comes just two or three gathered in his name there he is in those midst can you say amen amen oh yes sir say so so you're coming tonight on a midnight uh uh midweek service that's not in vain you might be tired and wore out but that ain't in vain your your Gathering isn't in vain he's here in our midst that's what he promised see so then John 147 we've read it many time even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive even though he's come as a present help in time of trouble the world cannot receive it because it seeth him not neither knoweth him see but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day this day you shall know that I am in my father you in me and I in you can you say Amen so what would a prophet say in this day you are the final voice to the final age did you also know he called called you a called us as a church a super race a super race he didn't look upon this bride and just see Mortals failures BMS vagabonds he saw her as a super race why he's come with power and great Glory what makes us a super race I read you some quotes brother Brown said a supernatural God everybody say a supernatural God and a supernatural body in a natural people giving Supernatural signs hello you couldn't be educated enough to be a super race you can't have enough military might to be a super race you can't have enough weapons in this world to be a super race and yet here we are not educated looked upon as just insignificance yeah on now and yet a prophet of God calls us a super race because it's a supernatural God living in a natural people performing Supernatural signs he said another place Supernatural power with Supernatural signs through a supernatural belief in a supernatural world heard from a supernatural God that's a lot of Supernatural amen Supernatural power with Supernatural signs through a supernatural Faith or belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God I've read this I believe last Sunday to God today is not going to deliver his people by education he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by theology he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by science he never promised to do it he's not going to deliver them by denomination he never promised to do it but he will deliver them by the power Supernatural power of changing their lives and molding them into children of God well aren't you glad for that prise the Lord this is why in Zechariah 4 and6 it says this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by by nor by power but by my spirit saeth the Lord a supernatural thing a present help in the time of trouble now people are looking for help ain't that right they're looking for help amen the world over is looking for help amen they want as the prophet would tell us they want a messiah messiah means the anointed one so they're looking for an anointed person a messiah to come on the scene to help them yeah just like Israel was looking for a messiah when Jesus come to the Earth and Rome the prophet said was looking for a messiah as well see but notice Israel wanted a general that would uh uh come out and stomp Rome Plum out of the country Rome wanted a messiah that would make them a new great military regime and would take Egypt and the rest of the Nations and stomp them out God sent them a messiah and they rejected it didn't you say amen God sent them a messiah not according to what they wanted but what they need it ain't that right he's not just a Santa Claus coming like the world paints him as he is a present help amen see so the prophet said God sent them a baby he sent them a savior he know they needed a savior but they wanted a general an educated machine so today he says each nation is looking for a messiah Russia wants a scientific genius that'll run them over to the Moon convince some kind of a bomb that'll take off see all and knock off all our hydrogen bombs and stop them and take uh and can take their own bombs and rain it on everybody before anybody else gets a start and then they take the whole world over India wants a messiah they want somebody that will feed them without having to work so what the prophet said see he wants one that wants one that'll feed them give them something to eat clothe them without working for it just walk up and down the street throw it out from one side to the other there you are won't work they they they just want to beg so they want some kind of a holy man to rise up who can reach up in the top of the trees and Shake It bread and meat and things down up on top of them and they sit around and eat and sleep the rest of the day and get up and have the best of clothes Every Nation wants a messiah America wants intellectual genius a politician they're getting closer aren't they see the church they're wanting Messiah but what Messiah are they looking for an anointed genius who has everything so fixed up that they can live in the world women can cut their hair paint their faces men can marry four or five times and still be deacons they can do anything they want to do and still maintain their confession as being a Christian they want a genius that can fix Creeds to where everything bows to it everybody wants a messiah but they want it on their own condition can you say Amen but see as as the Jews were looking for messiah when Jesus walked the Earth people are looking the prophet said for a religion to deliver them Israel wanted a religion that would deliver them from all their evils and their enemies but what they don't know is Christianity meets every challenge that they're looking for the Lord can you say amen amen see what they need see and so they didn't receive it back then and they won't receive it today see so the prophet said they're looking they're seeking a religion that will bring a reality to them what church what denomination what program can bring a reality of God to them ain't that right now church that word reality is the the quality or state of being real so there is a reality to Victory do you believe that there's a reality to Joy there's a reality to peace to freedom to Dominion there's a reality to living forever and never getting old there there's a reality to to this thing see and real true Christianity meets every one of those challenges now the prophet said these last days the true bride Church comes to The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race nears the great headstone they will be so much like him even they will be in his very image in the order to being united with him they will be one everybody say they will be one they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can never produce this they will produce their Creeds and dogmas mixed with the word and it brings forth a hybrid product can you say Amen but guess what God has sent a prophet with a message that is producing a super Church a super race where the church man and Supernatural God has joined together again amen thank you Malachi 4:5 and I get ready to close but Ma Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord what's he supposed to do he is to turn the the the children's Hearts back to the faith or back to the apostolics uh the uh Apostolic fathers amen see the the the the Apostle uh uh uh of the beginning ain't that right and his job was to restore the original word and restore the people back to that word can you say Amen trying to tell you God is bringing forth a messiah a present help in the time of trouble and the prophet said with the restoration of the word comes restoration of power so he says this in the last days it shall come to pass behold I send you to you Elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father others and in there everybody say in there from there from this message on now there would be a Time come forth when he God could express himself in fullness of his godhead de he through his church have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man everybody say the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed Ed bride and the bridegroom anointed by what accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my spirit my word is spirit Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept can you say Amen what he the eve turned down he comes back with that word and we accept so brother rown said see it's it's your heart in that word and that's Christ bring in there and watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed declares itself for the age it's living in now someone had had sent a quote uh uh on a chat and and I really liked it and and and I I want you to notice this brother BR said these are eagles he's talking about as the eagle stirreth her nest these are eagles that elect these are eagles don't feed them on chicken food they're Eagles get them out there where they have to fly or die that's a prophet get them out there don't just get them messing around a little little feed here chicken feed here chicken feed there get them out there where they have to fly or die that that's all see and God will watch over his Heritage he's never too far away he's always near to lift you up aren't you glad for that you say what in the world does that mean well this is where I'm at with it what I see it is is we've got a message to help us to fly we've heard the the voice of God say come up higher come up higher ain't that right we know that we're facing a time like never before and the only way we can meet It Is by Supernatural help right yes right yeah ain't that right that's the way it's going to be it's going to have to be amen it's got to be a supernatural Faith a supernatural element get away from as the prophet said get away from the human element get into that Supernatural element and fly don't be afraid to trust God don't be afraid to put God to the test on don't stand back amen and and afraid to to take that next step yeah can you say amen amen it's true yes sir it look what God has called you to be you are the Messiah for this age you are anointed with the word of God to bring every promise to pass yes sir don't be afraid to take God at his word come on now yes sir hello don't be afraid to claim in the promises that's right the devil whip you up and say well you ain't going to make it don't be afraid to fly and to say oh yes I will make it why it's by a supernatural element he is our present help in the time of trouble you're facing things that it just doesn't seem possible for it to to to to to come to work out for our good the Bible says it'll work out for our good fly we're coming to a place that you either fly or you die you can't sit in the roost anymore you understand what I'm saying none of us can sit in the roost anymore and say well I I don't know I I just don't know maybe it'll work out maybe it won't no you you we've been given the the promise we we've been that God is here Among Us now we got to fly yes sir or we die can you say Amen you love the Lord so the world is looking for a messiah what makes Messiah brother Braham said the word anointed makes the Messiah the anointed word of the hour so what made Jesus God is because the spirit of God was on him the word of God flow through him can you say amen amen cannot be on the fence anymore can't can't can't say well I'm a message believer and still hanging on to the world things you got to cut that off and you got to fly get out of that chicken yard and fly to where the word can flow through you to where you can believe for all things no matter what comes what goes no matter what situation you're in I don't know what you're in but if you can look at the promise and just believe believe and let that word of God flow through you am can you say Amen brother BR talking of Jesus said see the word of God flow through him so freely that even he could speak a word it would create see that showed who he was who can create but God God is the only Creator there is and he was so Haron perfect in harmony him and the Word was so perfectly together until he created even he had see the word he and the word being one and brother Bram said you're his son or his daughter makes you a messiah for him the anointed word living out in you can you say amen amen I love the Lord do you see so Paul would tell us in 2 Corinthians 3 and6 the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so he said you being Anointed with the same spirit he was anointed with makes you Messiah Lord how many believes you're messiah messiah is well some of us come to that belief Messiah is amen so if you really believe you're Messiah it's don't talk negative don't don't let the devil whip you up on now come on now church we either fly or we die either this message is right or it's not this message didn't come just as another Billy Graham or another uh uh Theologian or whatever down Through the Ages just to get us all satisfied and and fat and Sassy you know in the spirit amen that that that ain't it at all and plus that they didn't have what it could to make us fat and Sassy you know they just had a little bit but we got a seven course meal to where we ought to have enough strength Amen to fly in the heights of God and see God as a present help in us God as a present help in us you believe that see you just can't be around quickening power that quickening power must be in you not just be around it it's got to be in you amen Supernatural can you say Amen so brother Braham said Jesus brought God to human lives God was made human when Jesus was born God became man that he might become fellowship with man and in man to what achieve one purpose that is to bring to man what God is not what a church is but what God is Jesus came that he might present God to man and man didn't want it the Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man but man wants to go to church it drowns his thinking he cannot fathom it see and we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception God is known by the New Birth by the Holy Ghost not by any other way and the Holy Ghost has come as token life to come into you and to Quicken you that you may know what God is and they that know their God shall do great exploits can you say Amen if the musician will come do you love him praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen amen I'm going to read this Romans 8:19 we talked about it the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God church we have been groaning for this the Earth has been groaning this is the time you're living in the time that all creation through all time has been groaning for this moment that's right can you say Amen see and so they they shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we also grown our within ourselves so that first agage was groaning all the way through groaning see waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body this happens the Redemption of our body that full adoption happens when we come into the full adoption at the first resurrection what brother Bram said full adoption full ad op option can you say Amen we're in adoption now this is the age of adoption where the supernatural God living in natural people the word flowing through them and they're able to be in their place staying in their position amen and speak that word you you know you can speak the word over any situation you're in can you say Amen come on now yes sir this this isn't we're not just living in a little light enough light just to believe on Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins and and and and join a church no the full light has come the mystery of God has been made known to us

Jesus Christ who shall change our our vile body he's a present help in time of trouble that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself aren't you glad for that so brother Bram said all creation is groaning everything is groaning look at the trees how they struggle look at the flowers how they struggle for life just for the frost to tear them down look at the trees how they struggle to hold their branches out to sing glories unto God everything all nature all animals all birds how he flies from the enemy quickly and gets away everything's groaning and we ourselves said Paul we groan too with them we were waiting for the Redemption of our body another place brother Brown said the only way you can groan and wait for it is because there has been New Life come in here that speaks of a new world can you say Amen do you love him one more quote we have the earnest that's what Paul said we have the earnest of our inheritance brother Braham said what do we have we have the evidence that God Lives we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God has not forsaken us and that we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we now Tabernacle the holy spirit of God that cries out Abba Father and there's not nothing can ever take that away we are Anchored In Christ now the trees does not have it nature does not have it but yet we are still groaning within with them because as yet we haven't received the fullness of adoption see but we have the earnest of it that we're picked up from the things of the world and now become Sons and Daughters of God what kind of people should we be to think of that now having the earnest our spirit's groaning for the full adoption now we
