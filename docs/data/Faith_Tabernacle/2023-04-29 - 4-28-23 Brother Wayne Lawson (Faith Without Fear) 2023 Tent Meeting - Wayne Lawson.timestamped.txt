[1:10:38] unbelief Lord we lay aside every fear
[1:10:40] and every doubt Lord and we come to you
[1:10:43] tonight believing unto the power of the
[1:10:45] blood of thy precious son now Lord Jesus
[1:10:48] we're asking you tonight that your great
[1:10:50] anointing would move in this building in
[1:10:52] in a way Lord that would be like it was
[1:10:55] when you went in the room with them and
[1:10:57] you begin to break the bread we're
[1:10:59] asking you to break the bread in a
[1:11:01] different way tonight Lord not just by
[1:11:03] the preaching of the word but by the
[1:11:05] manifestation of the power of your
[1:11:08] majesty may you walk in this building
[1:11:09] tonight and begin to walk the aisles
[1:11:12] Lord I pray you break every Federal I
[1:11:14] pray the spirits of doubt and unbelief
[1:11:16] would have to turn loose tonight Lord
[1:11:19] healings and miracles would be released
[1:11:21] in this building father we lift you
[1:11:24] above every Power above every sickness
[1:11:27] above every disease and we believe you
[1:11:29] tonight oh God now we invite you as a
[1:11:32] congregation hands laid one on the other
[1:11:35] we're praying father that you would move
[1:11:38] Upon Us in a special way tonight we ask
[1:11:41] it in Jesus name amen and amen and God
[1:11:46] bless you tonight amen if you have your
[1:11:49] Bibles we would like to just go into the
[1:11:50] word of the Lord amen what a tremendous
[1:11:53] time to serve the Lord amen Hebrews the
[1:11:56] 11th chapter
[1:11:58] in the first verse Hebrews 11 and 1.
[1:12:01] all right
[1:12:03] Hebrews 11 and 1.
[1:12:09] Hebrews 11 and 1.
[1:12:17] now Faith is the substance
[1:12:20] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:12:23] things
[1:12:24] not seen
[1:12:26] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:12:29] report
[1:12:30] and through faith we understand that the
[1:12:32] worlds were framed by the word of God
[1:12:36] so that the things which are seen were
[1:12:40] not made of things which do appear as
[1:12:43] the Lord the bless his words you could
[1:12:45] be seated tonight
[1:12:47] I'm going to if I can tonight to speak
[1:12:49] to you
[1:12:50] on faith
[1:12:52] without fear
[1:12:54] faith
[1:12:56] without fear
[1:12:58] on the way down the Lord put some things
[1:13:00] on my heart and I told my wife I said I
[1:13:02] have a direction I just don't have the
[1:13:04] title I would like
[1:13:05] so I titled everything under the study
[1:13:08] faith
[1:13:09] and I thought I'll just name it faith
[1:13:12] until brother Wendell come in last night
[1:13:14] and said I'm just going to preach on
[1:13:16] faith
[1:13:17] and so I said we must be talking to the
[1:13:20] same inspir Inspire amen and so I just
[1:13:24] um just today the Lord added that to me
[1:13:27] faith without fear amen and that's
[1:13:30] exactly what I believe that as the
[1:13:33] Church of the Living God that we can
[1:13:34] experience I believe we can experience
[1:13:37] faith without fear amen now the
[1:13:41] scripture tells us amen of course that
[1:13:44] faith is a substance and brother Adam is
[1:13:46] very clear in teaching this that faith
[1:13:49] is a positive in other words he says
[1:13:51] it's a it's a positive it's a substance
[1:13:53] not imagination faith is not just a
[1:13:56] feeling or something that you would like
[1:13:58] to be but faith is actually a substance
[1:14:01] and it's positive amen as as something
[1:14:04] that God gives you now when I declare
[1:14:07] this brother Bradham from the message of
[1:14:08] super sense in 1959 he preaches it after
[1:14:11] super sign and in this he is describing
[1:14:14] the senses of the body and he says God
[1:14:17] gave you five senses to contact your
[1:14:20] Earthly home now he gave you of course
[1:14:22] your sight your taste your feel your
[1:14:24] smell your hair all of those are senses
[1:14:27] but we have to be honest most everyone
[1:14:29] has them unless something has caused a
[1:14:32] problem everyone has those senses and
[1:14:35] they're to the Natural man so everyone
[1:14:37] with a natural birth has natural senses
[1:14:41] and is to contract to contact the
[1:14:43] Earthly home now those five senses were
[1:14:46] given to you to contact but they were
[1:14:48] never given to you to guide you in this
[1:14:50] life because the senses of your body can
[1:14:53] be fooled amen they they your your ever
[1:14:56] sense that you have can be deceived in
[1:14:59] some sort of fashion so what we find out
[1:15:01] is the sea but brother Bram says but see
[1:15:03] but a Christian of course by a second
[1:15:06] birth was given an extra sense he goes
[1:15:10] beyond the five senses and he has added
[1:15:12] to him the sense of Faith which brother
[1:15:14] bam calls it a super sense and he says
[1:15:17] it's just as real as your taste feels
[1:15:20] smell in here I mean all the way back to
[1:15:22] Faith is the substance 1947 brother Adam
[1:15:24] actually has people come on the stage
[1:15:27] and and he stands in front of them and
[1:15:29] he says I see you you're here and then
[1:15:31] he'll put them behind him and he can't
[1:15:33] see him give him a mic and he'll make
[1:15:35] them say something and he'll say I can't
[1:15:37] see them but they're here here and he
[1:15:39] say anybody argue with me that they're
[1:15:41] not here see he was showing that one
[1:15:43] sense can make a declaration of
[1:15:45] something being there even when the
[1:15:48] other senses are not aware so you can
[1:15:50] all close your eyes right now take your
[1:15:52] hand send it over next to the person
[1:15:54] besides you you can still feel them and
[1:15:57] and you know sometimes even even that
[1:15:59] way when your eyes are closed you'll
[1:16:00] reach over to feel is somebody still
[1:16:02] there amen and you only have to have
[1:16:04] that one sense to declare something that
[1:16:07] you totally cannot see with your eye but
[1:16:10] that sense is positive and you would
[1:16:12] argue with someone that someone is there
[1:16:15] and you're only doing it from that one
[1:16:17] sense and that sense is a natural sense
[1:16:19] that can be deceived so how much greater
[1:16:22] is it then than the sense of Faith which
[1:16:24] God gave us that it alone can be the
[1:16:28] thing that declares something to be true
[1:16:30] when all of your other senses says it's
[1:16:33] not there but the face sense can declare
[1:16:36] something that is not in any other sense
[1:16:39] it'll make you believe something that
[1:16:41] you can't taste it you can't smell it
[1:16:43] you can't feel it you can't hear it but
[1:16:45] you certainly believe it and somebody
[1:16:47] says why do you believe it he said
[1:16:48] because I have a sense that tells me
[1:16:51] that it is real and is just as real as
[1:16:53] what I see here taste fill or smell so
[1:16:56] brother man said see then these five
[1:16:58] senses are given to you by God and they
[1:17:00] are to be used but when the five senses
[1:17:02] act contrary to the word then they are
[1:17:05] lying
[1:17:07] amen then they are lying he says
[1:17:10] anything contrary is alive so the sixth
[1:17:12] sense it cannot lie to you it is a super
[1:17:15] sense Amen in super sense brother man
[1:17:18] said the super sense is the Holy Spirit
[1:17:21] it is the faith that of God that dwells
[1:17:25] in you that's pretty powerful isn't it
[1:17:27] the faith of God that dwells in you in
[1:17:29] other words it's not your faith it's
[1:17:32] God's faith that dwells in you the same
[1:17:34] one that in the beginning said let there
[1:17:36] be a heavens and earth and there was
[1:17:38] nobody there to believe it except God
[1:17:41] and God believed his own word and saw it
[1:17:44] come to pass now that God with that
[1:17:47] faith has come into this dispensation
[1:17:50] and resides in the heart of Believers
[1:17:53] that are born of a new birth and by that
[1:17:56] alone can believe the word when
[1:17:58] everything else says it's not true but
[1:18:00] there's something on the inside of you
[1:18:02] that believes it anyhow because there's
[1:18:05] a face sense there that is making you
[1:18:08] aware of something you can't taste it
[1:18:11] feel it smell it hear it but sometimes
[1:18:13] you need to change channels you need to
[1:18:16] get out of the channel of your sense or
[1:18:18] out of the channel of your memory or out
[1:18:20] of the channel of your race reasoning
[1:18:22] and getting to a faith Channel where all
[1:18:24] things are possible because faith is the
[1:18:27] only hope that you have to get something
[1:18:29] that you can't get any other way faith
[1:18:32] is real it is a substance it is a sense
[1:18:35] it is positive and it literally dwells
[1:18:39] in the people if you'll let the five
[1:18:40] senses be yielded to the six it will
[1:18:43] guide you and bring you through all
[1:18:45] other senses
[1:18:47] it will guide you through all other
[1:18:49] senses for it so far above the natural
[1:18:51] sense the spiritual man is so far above
[1:18:54] the natural is so far as high as the
[1:18:57] heavens is above the natural man has
[1:18:59] five senses it makes you believe things
[1:19:02] you cannot see it makes you act where
[1:19:04] you do not think five senses would ever
[1:19:06] make you think about that and the devil
[1:19:09] can get into them five senses and lie to
[1:19:11] you but he cannot touch that super sense
[1:19:14] it's far beyond his reach it comes from
[1:19:18] God it's called Faith a natural man does
[1:19:22] not have that that's why natural people
[1:19:25] by a natural birth thinks you're a
[1:19:28] fanatic when you say things that you
[1:19:30] have received in faith because he only
[1:19:33] proof you have is that you have faith
[1:19:35] and they don't have that so they can't
[1:19:38] understand it but you understand it and
[1:19:40] you believe it and it seems ridiculous
[1:19:42] to everybody but you and the one that
[1:19:45] gave it to you which is God that sixth
[1:19:48] sense you see what it is it's a sixth
[1:19:50] sense what is it for brother Madam I
[1:19:52] love his brother said what is the sixth
[1:19:54] sense to do then what is it given to you
[1:19:56] for what is it to do he said this The
[1:19:59] Sixth Sense come for this The Sixth
[1:20:01] Sense come for this reason the Sixth
[1:20:04] Sense is Faith the super sense The Sixth
[1:20:07] Sense come for this reason only about
[1:20:09] the third time he says it he said this
[1:20:11] was to make your five senses in you deny
[1:20:15] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:20:17] God in other words amen that's what the
[1:20:21] Sixth Sense is given to you for is to
[1:20:24] give you a power to deny your own senses
[1:20:27] that you were born see because
[1:20:29] originally Adam would have walked by the
[1:20:31] six sins Adam would have been LED amen
[1:20:34] by the faith sense he lived in another
[1:20:36] realm but when he clogged up the
[1:20:38] channels that God had gave him he fell
[1:20:40] from that Dimension and man is bound in
[1:20:43] a sixth sense bound existence in other
[1:20:45] words their existence is bound what they
[1:20:48] can see taste feel smelling here but
[1:20:50] when a man gets a new birth he changes
[1:20:53] into another sense of the six which
[1:20:55] lifts him into another realm where he
[1:20:58] can operate and be led and be guided by
[1:21:01] a complete different realm than others
[1:21:03] amen that's why amen the intellectual
[1:21:05] will never reach what I'm talking about
[1:21:07] that's the reason you cannot teach
[1:21:09] somebody into this that's the reason
[1:21:11] you'll never do it it takes Faith to get
[1:21:14] there
[1:21:16] hey man do you see sometimes we're
[1:21:18] trying to encourage people that has
[1:21:20] never had a new birth amen until you
[1:21:23] have the new birth you don't understand
[1:21:25] Faith so it's impossible to educate you
[1:21:28] to it but if you have something in you
[1:21:31] you can't believe it
[1:21:33] amen I I have to be honest sometimes
[1:21:35] people just need saving
[1:21:37] Jesus said without the new birth you
[1:21:39] cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:21:42] sometimes it ain't saving it's like a
[1:21:44] it's like a story told of an airplane
[1:21:46] pilot flying over the ocean and he he
[1:21:48] wrecks and bustes his head on his
[1:21:50] helicopter or his airplane he's out
[1:21:53] there in the ocean he's bleeding and the
[1:21:54] sharks are gathering around him amen
[1:21:56] somebody sees him drops a smoke bomb
[1:21:58] after a while Coast Guard he comes and
[1:22:00] picks him up now when the Coast Guard
[1:22:02] come to get him did the man need
[1:22:05] encouraging or did he need savings
[1:22:07] did he need a class on how to swim
[1:22:10] better amen he's in the water with the
[1:22:12] sharks what he needs is saving not
[1:22:15] encouraged and sometimes what people
[1:22:18] really need is an old-fashioned
[1:22:21] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:23] Ghost where they can believe for the
[1:22:25] impossible where they can believe things
[1:22:27] that's beyond the realm amen because
[1:22:29] they need saving not encouraging but if
[1:22:33] a man ever gets saved then you can begin
[1:22:35] to encourage him by the message of the
[1:22:38] hour because then there is something to
[1:22:41] get a hold of faith will take a hold of
[1:22:44] the word of God
[1:22:46] faith will take a hold of the word of
[1:22:48] God now I know I'm not supposed to take
[1:22:49] off my jacket in a tent meeting but I'm
[1:22:51] gonna have to do it guys
[1:22:52] amen hallelujah do you love him tonight
[1:22:55] amen I think somebody come to have
[1:22:58] church the super sense is the Holy
[1:23:01] Spirit the faith of God that dwells in
[1:23:03] you then it's not you believing that you
[1:23:06] have let God get in you and he believes
[1:23:09] his own word amen it'll make you deny
[1:23:11] anything contrary The Sixth Sense has
[1:23:14] come upon the human being to make him
[1:23:16] deny this is a totally different quote
[1:23:18] to make him deny anything that's
[1:23:19] contrary any symptom any symptom that's
[1:23:22] contrary to the promise the sixth sense
[1:23:25] says it's not there
[1:23:28] can you imagine
[1:23:30] amen a sane and sensible person
[1:23:33] denying completely that there is
[1:23:35] anything wrong with them when they're
[1:23:38] sick and everybody knows they are
[1:23:41] but there's something in them that will
[1:23:43] not acknowledge it
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:45] now you know you know uh people that
[1:23:48] have cancer if they call it the first
[1:23:50] stage of it is denial they'll say people
[1:23:52] have denial now that's the a natural man
[1:23:55] don't want to be sick so he tries to
[1:23:57] deny that it's really there but when
[1:23:59] William Branham teaches this and how can
[1:24:01] overcome he said no that's not what
[1:24:03] we're talking about he said what we're
[1:24:05] talking about is knowing the devil is
[1:24:07] real he said we know it's real we know
[1:24:09] it's a real cancer we know it's a real
[1:24:11] problem he said the difference is we
[1:24:14] know that somebody in US is greater than
[1:24:17] the one that's in the cancer so we're
[1:24:19] not safe in the cancer ain't Fair we're
[1:24:22] not saying the problems not fair we're
[1:24:24] saying greater is he that is in you and
[1:24:28] he that is in the well greater is he
[1:24:30] that's in you than that's in the cancer
[1:24:32] greater is he that's in you that's in
[1:24:35] the diabetes I'm talking about God
[1:24:38] getting in the People by a super sense
[1:24:41] and believing his own word about what he
[1:24:44] said I believe and I believe God out has
[1:24:46] gave something in this age and we are
[1:24:48] overcoming because we have recognized
[1:24:50] the devil and everything he's doing
[1:24:53] against the church and we're saying sure
[1:24:55] he's real sure he's there but I'm saying
[1:24:59] God is greater he's greater than every
[1:25:02] Affliction he's greater than him listen
[1:25:04] I don't think we could really exalt
[1:25:06] Jesus Christ as high as he deserves to
[1:25:08] be exalted
[1:25:10] for Jesus was exalted above everything
[1:25:12] that has a name of every sickness
[1:25:14] disease every Affliction and the Bible
[1:25:17] said we have been lifted up with him and
[1:25:20] all things have been placed under our
[1:25:22] feet
[1:25:23] lifted by faith
[1:25:26] lifted by faith into a realm you may
[1:25:29] think I'm crazy but in Romans 4 and 17
[1:25:31] the Bible said it is written I have made
[1:25:33] thee the father of Nations before whom
[1:25:35] he believed even God who quickeneth the
[1:25:38] dead and called the things which not be
[1:25:41] as though they were
[1:25:43] now y'all know that's the scripture
[1:25:44] right in Romans amen how many times have
[1:25:48] you heard brother Branham say that was
[1:25:49] Abraham's confession
[1:25:51] Paul says it was God's confession
[1:25:54] that God called Abraham a father when
[1:25:56] he'd had no children
[1:25:57] and called things that were not as
[1:25:59] though they were but if you keep
[1:26:01] studying brother bam knows the Bible's
[1:26:02] written that way but he also calls it
[1:26:05] Abraham's confession because Abraham did
[1:26:08] not stagger at the promise of God
[1:26:09] through unbelief but rather confessed
[1:26:12] the same way his father confessed
[1:26:14] Abraham talk like his daddy and he said
[1:26:18] things that were not as though they were
[1:26:20] and things that were as they were not
[1:26:22] because he had a super sense he believed
[1:26:26] God when it was impossible he believed
[1:26:28] God when everything was against him amen
[1:26:31] his evidence was not in his body nor in
[1:26:35] Sarah's body his evidence was in that
[1:26:38] milk Hasidic that came to him and spoke
[1:26:40] to him and the Bible said Sarah received
[1:26:43] and believed the one who spoke was
[1:26:46] faithful to consider the promises of God
[1:26:48] what is it faith is the substance of
[1:26:51] things hoped for but it is an Evidence
[1:26:54] of Things Not Seen
[1:26:58] it's an Evidence now
[1:27:00] you literally have an Evidence to say
[1:27:02] things that you cannot see
[1:27:05] the prophet of God said in the Unseen he
[1:27:08] says it like this he said listen and a
[1:27:10] man's physical being to be taken care of
[1:27:12] is no reason at all God put him on the
[1:27:14] earth he does but what does he do with a
[1:27:17] physical being amounts very little it's
[1:27:19] what his soul is what counts it's the
[1:27:22] inward man that did not come from the
[1:27:25] earth it came from heaven
[1:27:28] and that's the Eternal part of a human
[1:27:30] being but yet strange he tries to figure
[1:27:33] out his own way to find it in the
[1:27:35] scriptures when a man chooses to walk in
[1:27:37] his own way and do what he wants God
[1:27:39] just lets him alone man must not think
[1:27:42] for himself but he met let the mind of
[1:27:45] Christ be in him and we are not to think
[1:27:47] for ourselves we are to call anything
[1:27:50] contrary to what he said as though it
[1:27:53] was not no matter what our eyes cling to
[1:27:57] be we do not live by what we see we live
[1:28:01] by what we believe then the prophet of
[1:28:03] God said we by no means are able to lead
[1:28:05] ourselves by this since-bound existence
[1:28:08] so that's why God give us Faith amen
[1:28:11] that it might declare that our senses
[1:28:13] was wrong and the word of God Is Right
[1:28:15] that we could live by it you know when
[1:28:17] Paul says it in First Corinthians 4 amen
[1:28:20] Paul actually says our light Affliction
[1:28:22] was but for a moment worketh for us and
[1:28:25] exceeding Eternal weight and Glory while
[1:28:27] we look not at things which are seen But
[1:28:30] at things which are not seen for things
[1:28:32] which are seen are temporal but the
[1:28:35] things which are not seen are eternal
[1:28:38] [Applause]
[1:28:39] the things you don't see are more real
[1:28:42] than the things you see
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:47] now nobody's going to think I'm crazy
[1:28:49] for declaring there's a tent here
[1:28:51] tonight nobody's going to think I'm
[1:28:53] crazy for declaring peoples in this
[1:28:54] building tonight because everybody by
[1:28:57] the sense of sight can confirm what I'm
[1:28:59] saying to be true if you don't have any
[1:29:01] sight you can hear what I'm saying to be
[1:29:03] true matter of fact my Apple watch said
[1:29:05] I was in a loud noise Zone
[1:29:10] I said Glory Apple's about to learn
[1:29:12] something about the house of God
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:17] do you see what it is then then the
[1:29:20] things which you will see are actually
[1:29:22] more real than the things amen the
[1:29:25] things you don't see is more real than
[1:29:26] the things you see and we don't even
[1:29:28] hesitate
[1:29:29] to declare things we see
[1:29:31] but the things we don't see are actually
[1:29:34] more real
[1:29:36] and we should have a stronger
[1:29:38] declaration
[1:29:39] of the Unseen than the scene we should
[1:29:43] be more ready to say what we don't see
[1:29:46] by our eyes than what we see by our eyes
[1:29:50] man I know y'all gonna think I'm crazy
[1:29:52] when it's over but I believe in radical
[1:29:54] faith I believe prophet of God said when
[1:29:57] you know where you're going you can have
[1:29:58] radical Faith amen you you think brother
[1:30:01] Wayne you're crazy saying and sensible
[1:30:03] is what we need go see what brother bam
[1:30:05] said about that get a hold of the word
[1:30:07] of God and you're sane and sensible in
[1:30:10] heaven you might not be on the earth
[1:30:12] because all of our family has convinced
[1:30:15] considered nuts for years amen our
[1:30:18] Church of the Living God has always been
[1:30:20] odd boss but the church has always been
[1:30:22] founded on the Unseen realms on the
[1:30:25] Unseen Realms now things that are
[1:30:28] actually in this building right now can
[1:30:30] we declare a little bit of the Unseen
[1:30:33] I know I got but how many Believers I
[1:30:35] got in here with me tonight
[1:30:38] how many believers they got in here with
[1:30:39] me tonight
[1:30:41] amen now the prophet said in John 14 and
[1:30:44] my father's house of many mansions
[1:30:45] Fellowship by Redemption 1955. he said a
[1:30:48] body is a dwelling place and for the
[1:30:49] scriptures verify the same thing now if
[1:30:51] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:30:53] have one already waiting mortal beings
[1:30:55] is only one who lives in Mortal
[1:30:57] habitations Immortal beings live in
[1:30:59] Immortal habitations and the place that
[1:31:02] we go until we return back is not a
[1:31:05] place of brick and mortar or clay or
[1:31:07] precious stones or Jewels it's a place
[1:31:09] or a condition that we move out of this
[1:31:11] Dimension that we go into he said into
[1:31:14] another dimension and it's a house a
[1:31:16] tabernacle a Dwelling Place Jesus said
[1:31:19] destroy the Tabernacle I'll Build It Up
[1:31:21] in three days they thought he was
[1:31:23] speaking to Solomon's Temple but he was
[1:31:24] speaking of his own body and he was
[1:31:26] going to prepare a place for every
[1:31:28] believer that the very moment we step
[1:31:30] out of this Mortal regions we don't have
[1:31:33] to go out into a myth or in some
[1:31:35] Supernatural Spirit but we go out into a
[1:31:38] tabernacle or a dwelling place that that
[1:31:42] it might be right here in the building
[1:31:44] this morning in a place where no radio
[1:31:48] activity or nothing else can touch it
[1:31:51] but God and God Alone now I cannot
[1:31:54] believe that there is a house way out
[1:31:56] yonder but I believe that the house God
[1:31:58] was speaking of is Right present here
[1:32:01] now you see what the prophet saying he
[1:32:04] said Heaven is not way out there on the
[1:32:07] cloud somewhere he said it's right here
[1:32:09] amen it's right here now your eyes
[1:32:12] cannot declare it but it's here just the
[1:32:16] same
[1:32:18] it's as real as the people are in this
[1:32:21] building to your natural eye there is a
[1:32:23] host that is in this building tonight
[1:32:25] that you cannot see with your natural
[1:32:27] eye the Saints of every ages have
[1:32:30] gathered up in this building with us
[1:32:31] tonight the angels of heaven have
[1:32:34] gathered up in this place with us
[1:32:35] tonight the prophet of God said they're
[1:32:37] present here with us right now he said I
[1:32:40] believe that's where Jesus is today the
[1:32:43] resurrected Lord Jesus is not younger
[1:32:45] somewhere A Million Miles Away he's
[1:32:48] right here present with us now
[1:32:52] Hallelujah you had a little while and
[1:32:55] the world seeth me no more it's the
[1:32:57] scripture low I'll be with you even in
[1:33:00] you until the end of the world and
[1:33:02] Heaven's not a million miles away it's
[1:33:05] right here in this building tonight the
[1:33:07] prophet said just in another dimension
[1:33:11] a dimension that radio can't touch a
[1:33:14] dimension television can't touch but a
[1:33:17] place your faith can contact
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:22] I tell you what brother bam said he said
[1:33:24] it's just moving a little faster he said
[1:33:26] coming right through this building now
[1:33:27] is televisions and pictures but it's too
[1:33:30] fast for our eyes now that's a radio on
[1:33:32] television so we don't even have to go
[1:33:34] to the spiritual
[1:33:36] to get to the Unseen amen how many ever
[1:33:39] seen the covet virus
[1:33:42] but it's real
[1:33:44] well most people believe it isn't it
[1:33:47] sorry if you don't believe that amen but
[1:33:49] but but germs are real
[1:33:52] right you don't have to say a germ they
[1:33:55] made you feel the sickness of it you'll
[1:33:56] you'll see a disease cross through and
[1:33:59] you never seen that happen because it
[1:34:01] dwells in an unseen whale but it's
[1:34:03] effective and Powerful in that Realm
[1:34:06] but it's motivated by demonic life
[1:34:10] y'all know that's right and it's in an
[1:34:13] Unseen World and the prophet says it
[1:34:14] just like that color is coming through
[1:34:16] here now nobody would argue that not in
[1:34:18] this not in this age when Paul preached
[1:34:21] it things that are real or in the
[1:34:24] Eternal can you imagine but not now most
[1:34:26] people sing the television most people
[1:34:28] have seen a radio and they've heard the
[1:34:30] sounds coming from another place the
[1:34:33] problem is we have a limited sight
[1:34:36] and television and radio has allowed us
[1:34:39] to dip into the Unseen by natural powers
[1:34:46] but they're there
[1:34:49] sure and it affects you
[1:34:53] come on you know what I'm talking about
[1:34:54] I remember when I was a kid people used
[1:34:56] to I remember as a little boy I remember
[1:34:57] the old pastor we was under I think
[1:34:59] every other service he preached against
[1:35:01] television it's going to send you to
[1:35:03] Hell one day I got studying the message
[1:35:04] I realized television didn't have the
[1:35:07] power to send me to hell
[1:35:09] but I did realize it had the power to
[1:35:11] take my victory
[1:35:14] because if your name is in the Lamb's
[1:35:16] Book of Life
[1:35:18] there ain't enough televisions there
[1:35:21] ain't enough Devils there ain't enough
[1:35:23] hail there ain't enough drugs there
[1:35:26] ain't enough alcohol there is nothing
[1:35:32] there is nothing
[1:35:35] can change the seed that God anointed
[1:35:38] you with when you were born into this
[1:35:40] age somebody said I don't believe in
[1:35:42] that stuff well amen read the message
[1:35:44] once in a while
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:47] don't believe the power of new births
[1:35:48] was in you when you were born let me
[1:35:50] just say this to you to you about the
[1:35:51] first bar
[1:35:53] where'd you get that power the first lie
[1:35:55] you ever told what about the first drink
[1:35:57] he ever took what about the first thing
[1:35:59] you ever stole that power was in you
[1:36:02] from a perverted birth
[1:36:03] amen and you were born to a natural seed
[1:36:06] but there was another Birth by another
[1:36:09] seed it was a new birth of the gene seed
[1:36:12] of almighty God
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:14] [Applause]
[1:36:20] somebody shout hallelujah there's seed
[1:36:24] in the field
[1:36:27] I studied out here a while back I got to
[1:36:29] see him people didn't like us praising
[1:36:31] God and shouting and rejoicing amen they
[1:36:33] didn't like it at all I got to study and
[1:36:35] brother man said the praise poured out
[1:36:36] the anointing he said it was just the
[1:36:38] rain on the crop and other people said
[1:36:40] well you know Devils can shout and and
[1:36:43] Devils can holler and I finally told him
[1:36:45] I said yeah that's true but have you
[1:36:47] ever read that there's more seed in the
[1:36:49] field than devils have you ever read hey
[1:36:52] matter of fact the devil maybe that's
[1:36:55] the only Pride or the only thing that
[1:36:57] people ever receive in this Dimension
[1:36:59] but God put his seed in this age that's
[1:37:02] why the rain's coming it's not coming
[1:37:04] for the for the Burr it's not coming for
[1:37:07] the cuckoo bird it's coming for the
[1:37:09] wheat seed that God planted
[1:37:15] so what you see cannot change your seed
[1:37:20] come on Church let's go I mean it's not
[1:37:23] what you see that changes your seed it's
[1:37:25] how it affects the seeds you already are
[1:37:27] and if you're amen if you was in that
[1:37:30] serpent seed you love that Hollywood you
[1:37:32] love that thing it'll just carry you all
[1:37:34] places you want to go you can go amen
[1:37:37] all kinds of places and in natural realm
[1:37:40] you can fold into Dimensions you right
[1:37:42] in your living room through the through
[1:37:44] the through the through the prospect of
[1:37:46] Television amen but what about the
[1:37:49] places that God can take his seed by the
[1:37:52] power of vision and the spirit of God
[1:37:54] and begins to drop in the sanctuary he
[1:37:57] can transport a person
[1:38:00] he can take them out of depression into
[1:38:03] the joys of the Lord he can take him out
[1:38:06] of nervousness to the power of praise
[1:38:08] and of Happiness I'm talking about a God
[1:38:11] that has the power of Transportation in
[1:38:13] his Spirit realm in a spirit world
[1:38:16] [Applause]
[1:38:21] televisions only a perversion of the
[1:38:25] Unseen whim that God unlocked in the
[1:38:28] 1940s 50s and 60s that's when television
[1:38:31] came in power in America but God had
[1:38:34] another Seer on the earth declaring the
[1:38:38] eternals to the Church of the Living God
[1:38:42] whew
[1:38:45] now that seed declares that he's in this
[1:38:48] building tonight
[1:38:49] there's a declaration the Lord Jesus
[1:38:51] Christ the resurrected Son of God is
[1:38:53] standing here and the reason you can't
[1:38:56] see him is because our hearts have not
[1:38:58] become tuned down to it yet
[1:39:04] now
[1:39:05] the reason we can't see the television
[1:39:08] pictures with our natural eyes
[1:39:10] because our eyes can't tune to that
[1:39:12] channel to see it
[1:39:14] but it's there
[1:39:16] it's absolutely there now look at the
[1:39:19] prophet tell us in the Easter seal he
[1:39:21] said I stood there and I looked over the
[1:39:23] time I seen tens of thousands of
[1:39:26] thousands coming
[1:39:27] young men and women throwing down their
[1:39:29] arms and screaming and look back and I
[1:39:31] was laying there on the bed Lord let me
[1:39:34] look past the curtain of time what is it
[1:39:36] it's a quickening power that will catch
[1:39:38] us away the quickening power that came
[1:39:40] what was it that took brother random off
[1:39:43] of his bed into that sixth Dimension and
[1:39:47] his body never moved
[1:39:49] he said I would stand he was 20 feet
[1:39:51] from his body you go listen he was still
[1:39:54] in the bedroom with his body laid on the
[1:39:57] bed and was looking into a dimension
[1:40:00] with millions of believers
[1:40:03] screaming we wouldn't be here if you
[1:40:05] hadn't come
[1:40:07] well I'm identified there
[1:40:10] he was not a million miles from his
[1:40:14] bedroom
[1:40:16] he was seeing that right there
[1:40:19] because that realm is not a Million
[1:40:22] Miles Away
[1:40:23] it's right here do you see what it is
[1:40:26] amen it's it's an atmosphere now they're
[1:40:29] having problems with the Dew in the tent
[1:40:32] how many how many can witness that
[1:40:34] you thought it was rain it wouldn't rain
[1:40:36] these these heaters are propane and
[1:40:40] they're going up and they're they're
[1:40:41] causing humidity
[1:40:43] and the humidity is trapped above you
[1:40:45] and it's colder on the outside than it
[1:40:47] is the inside so the two Dimensions
[1:40:50] coming together on that skin creates an
[1:40:53] effect
[1:40:55] what you have is a tent skin
[1:40:59] and two dimensions are pressing together
[1:41:01] on it
[1:41:03] and water's coming out of it
[1:41:06] nobody put no water up there the rain
[1:41:09] ain't leaking through it's a brand new
[1:41:12] tent there's nothing wrong with a tent
[1:41:14] it's called condensation because of two
[1:41:18] Rams touching the same thing but we're
[1:41:21] on this side and it's on that side and
[1:41:24] it's the only thing that's between it is
[1:41:26] the veil of the flesh
[1:41:29] do you know what the prophet of God said
[1:41:31] he said he was praying he said Lord let
[1:41:34] your angels come in this building
[1:41:35] tonight he said let them lock their
[1:41:38] wings Above This Crowd and he said May
[1:41:40] the Dew drops of Mercy begin to drop on
[1:41:43] the Church of the Living God I tell you
[1:41:46] if you get wet off of this tent tonight
[1:41:48] somebody ought to shout and run the
[1:41:51] Isles to faint amen that you have been
[1:41:54] affected by the another atmosphere why
[1:41:57] setting under this tent
[1:42:00] I know somebody's going to leave here
[1:42:02] and think I'm a fanatic that's all right
[1:42:04] amen I might beep and leave me alone I'm
[1:42:07] happy like this
[1:42:10] we were sitting in my living room not
[1:42:12] too long ago brother Spencer was sitting
[1:42:14] there with us and brother Erickson three
[1:42:16] or four of the brothers Elders we were
[1:42:17] all sitting around the table amen and we
[1:42:19] began to talk about a visitation he had
[1:42:22] had with the presence of the Lord when
[1:42:23] he began to tell about it the power of
[1:42:25] God dropped there right right around my
[1:42:27] table and we were sitting there and the
[1:42:29] spirit of God began to deal with needs
[1:42:31] and and it was just a powerful moment in
[1:42:34] the Lord that God was just dealing with
[1:42:36] our hearts that was a presence fell over
[1:42:38] the entire living room somebody recorded
[1:42:40] it if you'd like to hear it someday
[1:42:41] maybe and they started singing the baby
[1:42:43] started getting quiet and brother
[1:42:45] Jonathan all of a sudden I realized that
[1:42:48] my hands were getting wet and I thought
[1:42:50] what is happening here my hands that was
[1:42:53] exposed that was a Mist like something
[1:42:55] like it was raining in the open right on
[1:42:58] my hand sitting in the middle of that I
[1:42:59] told the brothers I said I never in my
[1:43:01] life experienced something like this
[1:43:03] it's like literally I'm standing there
[1:43:05] and stuck my hand and it was raining
[1:43:08] somewhere but not at my table but I I
[1:43:10] could feel the Mist coming up on my hand
[1:43:12] do you see because there's other
[1:43:15] dimensions now I don't know if you if
[1:43:17] you can believe this far but I remember
[1:43:19] preaching in Africa not too long ago
[1:43:21] brother Eric mccocco sent an email to
[1:43:23] our church to testify of many people
[1:43:26] that saw it while we were preaching
[1:43:28] there in West Africa amen I was standing
[1:43:30] there and the power of God began to move
[1:43:32] and they said you begin to disappear
[1:43:35] behind the cloud why would they couldn't
[1:43:37] see me no more they were just hearing a
[1:43:40] man preaching out of a cloud now I
[1:43:42] didn't tell it all over the world
[1:43:43] because I figured probably somebody
[1:43:44] think I was crazy but just the other day
[1:43:46] in Windows 10 meetings out there in
[1:43:48] Oklahoma amen our young people begin to
[1:43:51] create such an atmosphere amen that
[1:43:54] while one of my brothers were preaching
[1:43:56] the cloud the glory cloud of God came
[1:43:59] down and began to feel the building
[1:44:00] listen it's not a million miles away as
[1:44:04] an atmosphere that's created by the word
[1:44:07] of God we are believers in a Superman
[1:44:10] natural god with Supernatural
[1:44:12] manifestations in the power of God I
[1:44:15] refuse to sit down and shut up when I
[1:44:18] can see it with my eyes I can see it by
[1:44:21] my faith my faith says it's there amen
[1:44:24] it's not a lie it's not a fanaticism
[1:44:27] it's not an embellishment it's the power
[1:44:30] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in
[1:44:34] this age
[1:44:38] can you imagine looking right at
[1:44:40] something and everybody telling you
[1:44:42] you're crazy but you can see it you know
[1:44:44] it's real you know it's powerful you
[1:44:47] know how I feel but God rich and mercy
[1:44:50] has given us a vision to pierce to
[1:44:53] pierce this six
[1:44:55] since Ram into the power of God
[1:44:59] now this other dimension right here now
[1:45:02] today just imagine that his presence is
[1:45:05] here right now
[1:45:06] brother
[1:45:08] just imagine he's here in the form of
[1:45:10] the spirit and it's blending with our
[1:45:12] spirit
[1:45:14] and our eyes can't see him because
[1:45:16] they're yet physical unless something
[1:45:19] would happen that we could see the
[1:45:20] vision but here just as visible just as
[1:45:23] real as he was the day he spoke to Mary
[1:45:26] at the grave
[1:45:30] you've read Luke 24 and you wished you
[1:45:33] would have been there with Mary
[1:45:34] and you've talked about the two on the
[1:45:36] road to Emmaus and you wished you would
[1:45:37] have had that seat or that place to walk
[1:45:40] with him that day the prophet of God
[1:45:42] said he's just as real as when he met
[1:45:44] cleophus on the road his presence is
[1:45:47] here and it can be felt with that feel
[1:45:50] of the inner charge that's on the inside
[1:45:52] of the human body called the New Birth
[1:45:54] the soul has been magnetized unto him
[1:45:57] and once in a while when you let your
[1:46:00] mind be concentrated on him Believing on
[1:46:03] him after a while something a reality
[1:46:06] something that we can feel begins to
[1:46:09] sweep over us it's a Vindication of his
[1:46:12] resurrection when you just begin to get
[1:46:14] your mind on him that's why Satan's got
[1:46:16] all these Mind Games going that's why
[1:46:18] the politics and the and the
[1:46:20] intellectuals and all the situations in
[1:46:22] the world anything so you won't think on
[1:46:25] this anything so you won't dwell on this
[1:46:27] but if you begin to focus your mind on
[1:46:30] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus while
[1:46:32] you begin to Behold Him you begin to be
[1:46:35] changed you begin to be loose from the
[1:46:37] mannerisms and the ideas and the
[1:46:40] prospects of your tradition and your
[1:46:42] religion and all of a sudden a Superman
[1:46:44] is born into a natural realm no who he
[1:46:48] is knowing where he comes from
[1:46:50] understanding the things of God because
[1:46:53] it's just as real
[1:46:58] going on in this building right now
[1:47:01] now see here's the thing until this age
[1:47:04] we can only declare it by preaching the
[1:47:07] word
[1:47:09] but God let him invent a camera
[1:47:14] and the movie stars are using it but go
[1:47:16] home and study Google go go study uh
[1:47:19] it's not Google Chrome it's Kodachrome
[1:47:21] Kodak color photography
[1:47:24] do you all know when that come into
[1:47:25] existence
[1:47:27] when a prophet was on the Earth
[1:47:30] because God had recorded in the Bible
[1:47:34] what the bride looked like in the
[1:47:36] Supernatural realm while she was
[1:47:38] enthroning the power of God
[1:47:40] and they talked about it in the
[1:47:42] scripture you hear it described when
[1:47:44] Ezekiel says he was a wheel that was in
[1:47:47] the middle of the wheel
[1:47:49] now in Revelation chapter 4 part 2 I
[1:47:53] believe it is brother Brown breaks into
[1:47:55] Revelation chapter four and said behold
[1:47:57] that John said behold I was looking at
[1:47:59] the throne
[1:48:00] and it says and when I saw it it
[1:48:03] appeared unto Jasper and sword and stone
[1:48:05] and he said in a rainbow it was about
[1:48:07] the throne and brother man looked at
[1:48:09] that and he said now isn't that amazing
[1:48:11] that John saw that light and the color
[1:48:14] of it in emerald green
[1:48:16] like a burning fire of green blazing out
[1:48:19] of the center of that fire and when he
[1:48:22] sees that he said see John saw that he
[1:48:25] said now that was the bride's light that
[1:48:28] John was seeing
[1:48:30] if you want to study it he said go to
[1:48:32] Revelation 21 and the Bible said in that
[1:48:35] Temple amen that her light
[1:48:39] amen was the lamb her light was Jesus
[1:48:43] Christ and he picks up that word her
[1:48:46] light he said now what does her light
[1:48:49] look like he said let's go back to the
[1:48:51] Old Testament and see if it's not the
[1:48:54] same yesterday today and forever so he
[1:48:57] goes back in the Old Testament to the
[1:48:59] Book of Ezekiel chapter 1 and verses 26
[1:49:01] can you pull that up for me Ezekiel 1 26
[1:49:04] and verses 27 it's a very powerful 27 28
[1:49:08] it's a very powerful reading of the
[1:49:10] scripture we'll just read this portion
[1:49:11] you need to read the whole chapter but
[1:49:13] we're not going to read the whole
[1:49:14] chapter tonight pull it up and above the
[1:49:16] firm and it was over their heads was
[1:49:17] like a likeness of a throne and I'm
[1:49:19] gonna I'm going to express and explain
[1:49:21] to you what you look like in the
[1:49:24] Supernatural and above the firmament
[1:49:26] above that was over their heads was the
[1:49:30] likeness of the throne is the appearance
[1:49:32] of sapphire stone and likeness of the
[1:49:34] throne was the likeness of the
[1:49:35] appearance of a man above it now before
[1:49:38] you think I'm a crazy how many knows
[1:49:40] that God has three Thrones
[1:49:42] first one was in heaven second Christ
[1:49:44] and third one's where
[1:49:47] in the bride
[1:49:48] it's in the bride now watch what he says
[1:49:51] and the appearance of it was like a man
[1:49:53] and I saw as the color of an Amber amen
[1:49:56] and Amber and the Amber brother keeps
[1:49:58] going over Amber as the appearance of a
[1:50:00] fire round about within it from the
[1:50:01] appearance of his loins even upwards
[1:50:03] from the appearance of his loins even
[1:50:04] downward and I saw as it was the
[1:50:07] appearance of a fire and it had a
[1:50:09] brightness round about it Ezekiel was
[1:50:12] seeing what John was seeing and he's
[1:50:14] trying to explain what he's seeing this
[1:50:17] man covered in fire from his lines Upper
[1:50:21] from his lines downward he was saying it
[1:50:23] by Vision he was declaring it by Vision
[1:50:26] other people were scratching their head
[1:50:28] what's he talking about I've been saying
[1:50:31] nobody looks like that amen but all of a
[1:50:34] sudden in the age we're living in God
[1:50:37] sent a representative upon the Earth
[1:50:40] that represented the Bride of Jesus
[1:50:42] Christ now Shake somebody and tell them
[1:50:45] we don't believe brother Adam was Jesus
[1:50:48] but we certainly believe that Jesus sent
[1:50:51] him
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:51:01] he represents the bright part
[1:51:05] of the ministry of Jesus Christ which
[1:51:08] identifies all of you sitting here
[1:51:11] tonight
[1:51:12] now we see this happening and by Grace
[1:51:16] brother Jim somebody snapped a photo of
[1:51:19] brother Branham in California can you
[1:51:21] pull up the photo you can see brother by
[1:51:23] Adam standing here he's preaching five
[1:51:26] minutes before this another photo is
[1:51:28] taken don't show any of that fire I grew
[1:51:31] up with this on my wall as a kid my mom
[1:51:33] used to have it I never knew what it was
[1:51:35] never understood it one day I was
[1:51:37] studying Revelation chapter four and
[1:51:39] brother random begins to read the
[1:51:40] scripture of Ezekiel 1 he said there it
[1:51:43] is he said caught by Kodachrome in
[1:51:46] messiah in 1961 brother William said we
[1:51:49] got a picture of it the same way they
[1:51:52] saw it he said there it is that take the
[1:51:55] picture of it exactly like Ezekiel Saw
[1:51:58] it there is what Ezekiel Saw and you say
[1:52:01] preacher you're lifting up a man well
[1:52:03] wait a minute now amen you're not
[1:52:05] actually seeing God because God is
[1:52:07] Immortal and invisible and he's in his
[1:52:11] throne
[1:52:12] [Applause]
[1:52:14] The Man became the Throne of God and
[1:52:18] look at the glory that's around that man
[1:52:21] because God is in that man
[1:52:26] now for the last 50 years they've
[1:52:28] shouted their heels off about what God
[1:52:31] did through brother random but I think
[1:52:33] it's high time for the bride of Christ
[1:52:35] to recognize he was representing this
[1:52:38] entire Pride Church brother Ron what was
[1:52:42] around that Prophet is around every
[1:52:44] believer sitting in this building
[1:52:46] tonight amen you don't have to be an old
[1:52:49] person but God has thrown in the Bride
[1:52:52] of Jesus Christ and the glory of God and
[1:52:56] the power of God and the revelation of
[1:52:58] God is whipping back and forth through
[1:53:01] this building you feel the atmosphere of
[1:53:03] it your senses declare as something
[1:53:06] greater than just a preacher something
[1:53:09] greater than just a man amen but
[1:53:11] somebody is declaring by faith there's
[1:53:14] another dimension and your faith is
[1:53:17] saying that's the truth that's the truth
[1:53:20] that's the truth and anointing to
[1:53:22] anointing
[1:53:25] another dimension another Ram
[1:53:30] I don't have time to go into it but I'll
[1:53:32] do this for you amen right there's a
[1:53:34] rainbow around about him seven colors
[1:53:35] brother Ram said we're standing there he
[1:53:37] said what does it represent he said the
[1:53:39] first rainbow was to Noah
[1:53:42] and Noah's seen it in the sky how many
[1:53:44] remembers Noah's seen it in the sky in
[1:53:46] Genesis 9 he said you'll never
[1:53:48] understand why it's there unless you
[1:53:51] read Genesis 8. see you can see the
[1:53:54] rainbow
[1:53:56] but why is it there
[1:53:58] why is the rainbow there brother Ben
[1:54:00] said because in Genesis 8 Noah made an
[1:54:02] atonement he made a sacrifice and when
[1:54:06] God accepted the sacrifice the rainbow
[1:54:09] was the visible Covenant that is
[1:54:12] sacrifice had been accepted
[1:54:15] amen and you'll never understand that
[1:54:18] picture until you read the book of
[1:54:20] Matthew and you see that they took a
[1:54:23] supreme sacrifice and they sacrificed
[1:54:25] the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:54:29] our father accepted the blood of Jesus
[1:54:32] so the power of the blood shows up on
[1:54:36] the bride in the last day listen this
[1:54:39] Glory that you're caring is not free
[1:54:40] this Glory that's your experience and
[1:54:43] it's not free this is a blood Pride this
[1:54:47] Throne was bought by the blood of Jesus
[1:54:49] Christ Satan tried to give it to him he
[1:54:52] wouldn't take it
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:55] but he died for it
[1:54:57] because when they come to claim it he
[1:54:59] did not want the devil having any claim
[1:55:02] against you because you are his throne
[1:55:05] No Angel No Angel ever rested in the
[1:55:09] heart of the Bride this body was
[1:55:12] reserved for Jesus Christ by the spirit
[1:55:15] to come into the church with anointing
[1:55:17] and power amen I tell you what it is
[1:55:19] it's the power of God and it's come upon
[1:55:21] the church and to explain this you have
[1:55:24] to believe in the blood
[1:55:28] no no brother Brandon was not born of a
[1:55:32] virgin
[1:55:33] he was a sex-born man with problems and
[1:55:36] mistakes had children of his own put a
[1:55:38] cross on his mirror to keep his eyes
[1:55:41] from wandering on the lust of some woman
[1:55:43] he was a man the same as you're a man a
[1:55:46] passion like you a passion but the blood
[1:55:49] of Jesus Christ and so atone for the
[1:55:52] power and the sin had been erased until
[1:55:55] a man could stand there and the glory of
[1:55:57] God could come upon him he could speak a
[1:56:00] squirrel
[1:56:01] speak the storms away
[1:56:07] it was the blood
[1:56:08] somebody hollering the blood
[1:56:11] the blood did it that's what produced
[1:56:13] this is the blood now you know you know
[1:56:16] good and well we got more than one
[1:56:17] picture and I'm not going to show them

[2:01:31] opened his eyes
[2:01:33] come on on the road to Emmaus he walked
[2:01:36] in the room and the Bible said when he
[2:01:38] broke the bread their eyes were opened
[2:01:41] Jesus didn't come Jesus didn't appear he
[2:01:44] was already talking to him but when
[2:01:46] their eyes were opened the scriptures
[2:01:49] was alive in the midst of them because
[2:01:51] they could see
[2:01:56] laughs
[2:01:59] I know people think God's out of angels
[2:02:02] sorry the Bible said that Jesus could
[2:02:04] have called 12 Legions
[2:02:06] how many is Legion 72 000 is a legion
[2:02:10] and Jesus could have called 12 72 000
[2:02:14] Legions of angels amen do you imagine if
[2:02:17] that was what was around the Son of God
[2:02:19] what did he put around his bride
[2:02:25] in Psalms 34 David said the angels of
[2:02:28] the Lord encamp about them that fear Him
[2:02:32] we're in the tent tonight but I
[2:02:34] guarantee you the angels of the Lord
[2:02:36] have encamped about this place it ain't
[2:02:38] just Camp Christian this is Camp Heaven
[2:02:41] the Throne of God is in the building
[2:02:43] tonight his throne is upon the air and
[2:02:46] the angels have gathered around them
[2:02:49] locking their wings demons are fleeing
[2:02:52] powers are leaving anointings are being
[2:02:55] broken classes are being took off
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:01] hallelujah what is it about is the
[2:03:03] angels of God it's God Amen the angels
[2:03:06] of God are encamped about it brother
[2:03:07] Brandon with with sight was telling us
[2:03:11] that you are the reflection of the
[2:03:14] supernatural
[2:03:16] how many knows you're the pull of
[2:03:18] Bethesda
[2:03:19] did you know that
[2:03:21] in the Bible when the angel came on the
[2:03:23] pull of Bethesda it troubled the waters
[2:03:26] and people stepped in and were healed
[2:03:27] brother random said them Waters
[2:03:29] represented Humanity
[2:03:32] he said so when the angel steps into the
[2:03:35] waters he said you see normal people
[2:03:38] acting differently
[2:03:41] you see drunkards getting saved
[2:03:44] you see people giving their lives to
[2:03:47] Christ it's a troubling of the one what
[2:03:49] is it it's two anointings the natural
[2:03:53] world the supernatural world coming
[2:03:54] together upon skin but now you're typed
[2:03:58] as Waters and somebody said well I tell
[2:04:00] you what they stood down and waited for
[2:04:02] that water to be troubled for days you
[2:04:03] know what the prophet of God said I'm
[2:04:05] announcing to you the waters are
[2:04:06] troubled now
[2:04:07] [Applause]
[2:04:10] I'm announcing to you amen this day in
[2:04:13] your ears the waters are troubled now
[2:04:16] [Applause]
[2:04:18] those afflictions and troubles you've
[2:04:20] been struggling with this is the season
[2:04:22] for it now
[2:04:24] not in a million miles amen it's right
[2:04:26] here tonight what is it it's a sign that
[2:04:29] God's getting ready to do something
[2:04:31] [Applause]
[2:04:33] now I know y'all didn't come in here
[2:04:35] feeling just exactly like you're feeling
[2:04:37] right now what happened
[2:04:39] what happened come on you bumped into
[2:04:42] something
[2:04:42] [Applause]
[2:04:46] said preacher you always talking about
[2:04:48] atmosphere I tell you why because even
[2:04:50] the sickest man bumping the right
[2:04:52] atmosphere and he'll be healed
[2:04:55] the most troubled person you know
[2:04:59] can bump into the atmosphere of the Holy
[2:05:01] Ghost and five minutes in his presence
[2:05:04] and be completely changed
[2:05:07] I think we ought to get an Atmos where
[2:05:09] every person can be sick that could be
[2:05:12] healed and you may think that I'm a
[2:05:13] little crazy so brother when you ask for
[2:05:15] too much do I really
[2:05:18] I tell you what we're under we're under
[2:05:19] an Elisha anointing how many knows that
[2:05:22] the prophet of God said in Elisha
[2:05:24] followed Elijah because he had already
[2:05:26] felt the power and he wasn't willing to
[2:05:28] turn around so he went all the way to
[2:05:31] the Jordan
[2:05:32] but once he crossed the Jordan Elijah
[2:05:36] turned and looked at him and said what
[2:05:38] are you hanging around for
[2:05:40] why do you keep following this Elijah
[2:05:42] Ministry what do you want from me
[2:05:46] and by the band said when Elisha looked
[2:05:48] at him he said I want a double portion
[2:05:50] of what you got
[2:05:54] swamped what he had I wanted a portion
[2:05:57] of it
[2:06:02] the Bible said you have asked a hard
[2:06:05] thing
[2:06:07] Elijah said you have asked a hard thing
[2:06:09] brother babe said well why don't you go
[2:06:11] ahead and ask if you're going to ask why
[2:06:13] don't you ask abundantly at your joy
[2:06:16] before why ask her halfway well I asked
[2:06:19] for just a little Victory why not ask
[2:06:21] for a holy ghost blessing that'll dance
[2:06:24] you out of that nervous problem and get
[2:06:26] you back into the power of God why not
[2:06:29] move into a realm where all things are
[2:06:31] possible
[2:06:32] why you want to stop halfway why do you
[2:06:35] want to let your pride pull you back
[2:06:37] from the base of the
[2:06:40] you're on the realm of the greatest
[2:06:42] thing you've ever experienced throw down
[2:06:45] your fear and believe God
[2:06:52] you've asked a hard thing
[2:06:55] you ask a hard thing well let me tell
[2:06:57] you this if I get to ask tonight I'm
[2:07:00] asking that every young person in this
[2:07:02] building filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:07:05] can that ever cancer case relief you
[2:07:08] miraculously healed I'm praying that
[2:07:11] every will get up and walk in
[2:07:13] every blind we'll see
[2:07:20] so by the way you asked too much Elijah
[2:07:22] said to him if you see me when I go
[2:07:25] you can have what you asked brother man
[2:07:27] said that Elisha never took his eyes off
[2:07:29] of him from that moment on
[2:07:31] and you know it matters what you're
[2:07:33] looking at and what you can believe for
[2:07:34] if you're looking at this world you're
[2:07:36] defeated but if you're looking at the
[2:07:38] promises of God your faith says it's
[2:07:41] possible your faith says it can happen
[2:07:44] let me ask you how long has the devil
[2:07:47] kept you beat out of your portion
[2:07:49] how long is the devil made you believe
[2:07:51] that you can't really live free you can
[2:07:54] go to church and you can enjoy church
[2:07:56] hood and you can have friends but you
[2:07:59] can't have Liberty well let me tell you
[2:08:01] that's a lying devil he was lying from
[2:08:03] the beginning and if you can have any
[2:08:06] God you can have all of God because you
[2:08:09] never earned it you never begged for it
[2:08:11] but by the blood of Jesus Christ he set
[2:08:15] the power back in the church to liberate
[2:08:17] these people
[2:08:21] you've asked a hard thing but go ahead
[2:08:24] and believe for it
[2:08:28] the prophet of God said he didn't ask
[2:08:29] for a person asked for a double of it
[2:08:32] now to you to study the Bible you know
[2:08:34] that's the law of the firstborn
[2:08:37] he wanted the inheritance you ain't got
[2:08:40] no children Elijah I want everything I
[2:08:43] want the whole thing
[2:08:45] you know brother bam said that was Jesus
[2:08:47] Christ from the church
[2:08:50] he said you can't have a double portion
[2:08:51] what brother Branham had Jesus said you
[2:08:53] could have a double what he had
[2:08:58] he said that's the cure for our age a
[2:09:01] double portion
[2:09:06] angels I know years ago I preached on
[2:09:09] angels I feel like doing it right now
[2:09:11] angels in the atmosphere
[2:09:14] you know if an angel is going to show up
[2:09:16] he don't just show up for nothing
[2:09:20] every time an angel showed up
[2:09:21] Supernatural things took place an angel
[2:09:24] never showed up just to prod you to do
[2:09:27] something natural
[2:09:29] and never Angels never showed up to push
[2:09:31] you to do something you could do without
[2:09:33] God but every time an angel come on the
[2:09:37] scene somebody did something that was
[2:09:39] superhuman
[2:09:42] have you ever wondered why the angels
[2:09:44] have filled the junction of time and
[2:09:46] right here when the dimensions are
[2:09:48] crossing Angels everywhere talked about
[2:09:50] everywhere TV's talking about it
[2:09:52] preachers are talking about it
[2:09:54] everybody's talking about it because the
[2:09:56] angels of God have come to prod this
[2:09:58] Pride into a rapturing faith don't you
[2:10:01] stop short of this message let the power
[2:10:04] of God take you in the Revival of the
[2:10:06] whole thing
[2:10:08] now you said well that was just for
[2:10:09] prophets brother Adam said prophets
[2:10:10] don't go to sleep they change dimensions
[2:10:13] while they're in the Pulpit they go into
[2:10:15] another dimension brother man said you
[2:10:18] might call it getting in the spirit
[2:10:20] he said and that's where a big part of
[2:10:22] my life is something inside of him would
[2:10:24] change he said but you need to enter
[2:10:27] that Realm
[2:10:29] can you imagine tonight that a prophet
[2:10:31] is inviting you to walk in the realm of
[2:10:34] another dimension
[2:10:36] he's saying that you need to go in there
[2:10:38] that you can move from one realm to
[2:10:40] another you said brother Wayne I can't
[2:10:42] do it you could if you'd look to the
[2:10:43] Unseen
[2:10:45] as long as you're looking at the natural
[2:10:48] there's a barrier of hair and somebody
[2:10:50] says well you're fanatical for praying
[2:10:52] that way you're fanatical for believing
[2:10:55] that way you're you're just oh man you
[2:10:57] think you're spiritual you believe in
[2:11:00] about dimensions and spirits and jumping
[2:11:02] and shouting but you you got all these
[2:11:04] things going on what's wrong with you as
[2:11:06] long as you're looking at all of that it
[2:11:08] is an impossible feat for you
[2:11:11] but if you look to the Unseen
[2:11:14] you can break every barrier of every
[2:11:17] sound every preacher's voice that ever
[2:11:20] said it's not possible every formal
[2:11:23] devil that's ever said you can't be you
[2:11:25] can't do it can't happen if you look to
[2:11:28] the Unseen by promise you can break out
[2:11:31] of those barriers and fly like the eagle
[2:11:33] and God made you to be
[2:11:38] come on Eagle it's your time to fly you
[2:11:41] wouldn't put here to sit on the roost
[2:11:43] tonight The Winds of Change have dropped
[2:11:45] down in this building tonight and the
[2:11:47] Breezers are blowing all the way from
[2:11:50] Glory breaking the latter rain and the
[2:11:52] thunderstorm of seven Thunders igniting
[2:11:56] the soul I believe is casting them in
[2:11:58] the realms
[2:12:02] foreign
[2:12:04] what an eagle tie
[2:12:09] fire you've climb the easier it is
[2:12:12] after a while the breaking of all those
[2:12:15] barriers the man becomes so surrendered
[2:12:19] he said preacher what are you talking
[2:12:20] about you all know that somebody gets
[2:12:23] under a demonic anointing and they get
[2:12:25] so surrendered they flop on the ground
[2:12:27] you've seen them you've seen them amen
[2:12:29] over the ended they walk up the walls
[2:12:31] walk across coals
[2:12:33] ten times the strength of a normal
[2:12:35] person amen you know why they do it
[2:12:37] because they're fully surrendering to a
[2:12:39] demonic form
[2:12:40] but if this if the elect of God if the
[2:12:44] called of God would lose their fear of
[2:12:48] the anointing of God and just begin to
[2:12:51] surrender themselves we're not going to
[2:12:53] surrender ourselves to the unknown it's
[2:12:56] to the Unseen
[2:12:59] I don't have enough time to go there but
[2:13:01] people today say that we're trying to
[2:13:03] get people come to alter and empty your
[2:13:04] mind and all that stuff and all that's
[2:13:06] what brother Brown was saying about them
[2:13:07] people back there we're not trying to
[2:13:09] get somebody to come to the unknown
[2:13:12] it's the Unseen
[2:13:14] we know him very well
[2:13:18] we know he's in this building
[2:13:21] we know he's here for every person and
[2:13:24] wants to come to him
[2:13:27] it's the Unseen it's not the unknown
[2:13:30] now there's a promise in this Bible that
[2:13:32] says you can have a perfect faith that
[2:13:35] will Master every circumstance I know
[2:13:37] they've told you that when you get in
[2:13:39] the Millennium you're going to get a
[2:13:41] kind of Faith but this promise is not
[2:13:43] for a millennial people this is for a
[2:13:46] people who lives in laodicea
[2:13:50] come on church this is a seven Church
[2:13:52] age and it's called laodicea but there
[2:13:55] is a faith that can move down in the
[2:13:57] heart of a believer that can pull him up
[2:13:59] into an eagle age where he is not a part
[2:14:02] of laodicea anymore it's there it's
[2:14:05] going on I can see it but I am not bound
[2:14:09] to it nor am I a part of it I have been
[2:14:13] called out unto the Bride of Jesus
[2:14:16] Christ
[2:14:16] [Applause]
[2:14:19] thank you amen what is it amen it
[2:14:22] matters amen it matters What Faith Can
[2:14:25] Do I could run a list of them tonight by
[2:14:27] faith rehab
[2:14:30] you can fill in the blank by faith Moses
[2:14:32] by faith Noah by faith Sarah by faith
[2:14:37] Abraham by faith Solomon by faith Samson
[2:14:40] by faith shame God
[2:14:44] that was before the cross
[2:14:48] that was before the blood
[2:14:50] but by faith the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:14:55] will overcome ever a laodicean devil
[2:15:01] you want to talk about Heroes of Faith
[2:15:03] I'm looking at the greatest light that
[2:15:06] has ever struck the Earth since her
[2:15:08] husband was here now she is on the earth
[2:15:11] as the light of this age representing
[2:15:14] the another book of Acts
[2:15:18] well we might as well shout a while
[2:15:20] because that Devil's short crying
[2:15:22] [Applause]
[2:15:24] because I tell you what there ain't no
[2:15:26] give up in her there ain't no quitting
[2:15:27] her there's no fear in her there's no
[2:15:30] Reserve in her there's no regret in her
[2:15:32] there's no retreat in her she's on fire
[2:15:35] for God and she's going to stomp out
[2:15:38] every devil and gets in her way because
[2:15:40] she's the Bride of Jesus Christ she's
[2:15:43] anointed for the season and for the hour
[2:15:46] I won't shut up I won't sit down I won't
[2:15:49] quit I won't give my mock-up I tell you
[2:15:53] Satan
[2:15:55] I'm still here
[2:16:03] it's time to recognize your origin you
[2:16:05] as a son to begin with
[2:16:06] [Applause]
[2:16:09] God never created you fall and he
[2:16:11] created you a son
[2:16:16] now y'all y'all gonna have to believe
[2:16:18] something way more Supernatural than I
[2:16:20] believe to believe that you've changed
[2:16:22] species
[2:16:26] the prophet of God said it ain't so
[2:16:29] he said you're a new creature created in
[2:16:31] Christ Jesus back to the original right
[2:16:36] how many Christians we got in here

[2:17:03] his name was the same when he got up as
[2:17:06] he went down
[2:17:07] why do you let Satan make you think that
[2:17:10] because you stumbled or because you fell
[2:17:13] that he had the power to change who you
[2:17:16] are I'm still who I am I still believe
[2:17:19] what I believe I still have the power
[2:17:22] amen of Christ Rising on the inside of
[2:17:25] me

[2:22:39] built that place
[2:22:42] it was just a field to Moses built it
[2:22:45] but then it became a place
[2:22:47] of a meeting place with a pillar of fire
[2:22:50] came over the word and they identified
[2:22:53] themselves with God and let me tell you
[2:22:56] what this is happening what's going on
[2:22:58] in this building tonight is that same
[2:23:00] light that ordained that first hint and
[2:23:03] in the middle of the Bible brought
[2:23:04] another tent and God has brought a tilt
[2:23:07] in this age
[2:23:12] and he said I will meet you
[2:23:19] now what are we talking about
[2:23:22] we're talking about taking the word
[2:23:24] and nothing else
[2:23:28] come on now don't leave me on faith
[2:23:30] I'm talking about faith based on word
[2:23:33] and nothing else

[2:23:39] see it he's here amen he said I'll be
[2:23:42] with you even in you he's here he's more
[2:23:44] real than the things that I can see is
[2:23:46] real he is here amen and when the people
[2:23:48] begin to recognize his presence and they
[2:23:51] take his word and they begin to put the
[2:23:54] word of God before God as an ignition
[2:23:57] and a power that begins to happen do you
[2:24:00] know brother bam said that's the way
[2:24:01] Miracles are performed
[2:24:05] do y'all know Miracles is a gift in the
[2:24:07] Bible and it's not in another age it's
[2:24:09] in this one
[2:24:11] do you know the gods you're serving is a
[2:24:13] Jehovah of Miracles he's not just a
[2:24:15] Divine healer he's a miracle working God
[2:24:19] you said preacher I need a miracle how
[2:24:21] do I work a miracle you don't have to be
[2:24:23] special you don't have to be a preacher
[2:24:25] you can work a miracle just like Mary
[2:24:27] worked a miracle
[2:24:30] that's what brother Branham said he said
[2:24:32] how did she do it he said she took the
[2:24:34] word and begin to thank God before she
[2:24:37] felt the first thing
[2:24:40] now though some guys took that and made
[2:24:42] it the baptism of the Holy Ghost sorry
[2:24:45] Mary went to the upper room just a few
[2:24:47] days later and got drunk on the spirit
[2:24:52] amen now you see you take that word and
[2:24:55] you said what are you talking about
[2:24:55] tonight maybe you're sitting here
[2:24:57] tonight and you want the Holy Ghost and
[2:24:59] you don't really feel the holy you don't
[2:25:02] feel that but you know it's true don't
[2:25:04] you know it's true in Acts 2 it said
[2:25:06] repent and be baptized how many is
[2:25:08] repented have been baptized it says in
[2:25:10] you shall somebody call her shall
[2:25:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[2:25:14] couldn't God lie no sir God can't lie
[2:25:17] then the word has given me permission to
[2:25:20] testify that every one of you that had
[2:25:22] been water baptized and repented in the
[2:25:25] name of the Lord I can say you have
[2:25:27] received the Holy Ghost
[2:25:31] and if you keep saying it
[2:25:35] you will work a miracle in your life
[2:25:38] demons will die unbelief will disappear
[2:25:41] and it
[2:25:46] the spirit of God will take every
[2:25:47] promise and call it present true brother
[2:25:49] Ben said it like this maybe you come up
[2:25:51] in a prayer line he said you come up in
[2:25:53] that prayer line he said you've got
[2:25:54] something going on with you he said and
[2:25:56] you get prayer he said you're hurting
[2:25:58] Justice bad as you were
[2:26:02] he said but when you begin to pray for
[2:26:04] that person you're hurting just as bad
[2:26:06] as you were he said but when you begin
[2:26:09] to leave

[2:26:15] your body
[2:26:16] you know there has been a victory
[2:26:19] by your faith
[2:26:22] so you got a right to leave the prayer
[2:26:26] line and tell everybody you know you're
[2:26:29] healed
[2:26:33] by the way
[2:26:36] but I'm still feel bad
[2:26:38] such senses feelings are not what
[2:26:43] declares the word of God we declare our
[2:26:46] faith when everything else is lie in

[2:28:00] brother Brown said the greatest curse
[2:28:01] had ever struck Humanity Was Fear
[2:28:06] but fear is going to come because fear
[2:28:09] is trying to back you off of the

[2:42:26] I told that testimony about Anna and
[2:42:29] brother Nathan standing right here
[2:42:30] needed a miracle in his body to have
[2:42:32] another child and he come through a
[2:42:34] prayer line at brother Nathan's Bryant's
[2:42:36] and God gave him a miracle and we got
[2:42:39] little Rosie here tonight she just
[2:42:41] turned a year old
[2:42:43] and you said preacher why are you
[2:42:45] telling that let me tell you the reason
[2:42:46] I was at Cloverdale two years ago on
[2:42:49] August and I was preaching their meeting
[2:42:51] and I gave the testimony of Anna and of
[2:42:53] this baby and of sister Stephanie and
[2:42:55] brother Bryce and when I started telling
[2:42:57] that testimony there's some liquor
[2:42:58] brother Ryan was sitting there playing
[2:43:00] had just come through his fourth
[2:43:02] miscarriage and they literally just
[2:43:05] drugged into camp and while he was
[2:43:07] sitting there deciding that there was no
[2:43:09] hope there was nothing that could ever
[2:43:11] be when I told the testimony the voice
[2:43:14] of God spoke to him said you'll have a
[2:43:17] son and you'll call his name Samuel do
[2:43:20] you know what he did he put the tape in
[2:43:22] front of the whole world and he showed
[2:43:24] the video of me testifying and the video
[2:43:27] of the baby that he was holding because
[2:43:29] testimonies caused testimonies cause
[2:43:32] testimonies cause testimonies if you
[2:43:35] want to see a miracle working God get to
[2:43:38] Worship in a miracle working God you
[2:43:40] want to see a miracle tell somebody God
[2:43:44] does Miracles he still changes lives he
[2:43:48] still heals the sick he still raises the

[2:44:21] of mine was amazing I called him because
[2:44:23] that child had a hip that wouldn't stay
[2:44:25] in joint and brother Sean didn't have
[2:44:27] the funds for the surgeries that was
[2:44:29] needed and him and I just took our first
[2:44:31] trip to New Mexico and while we were on
[2:44:34] our way to New Mexico they called us and

[2:44:38] for her and said something miraculous
[2:44:40] has happened the baby's hip popped back

[2:44:46] miracle
[2:44:47] every time she walks in the door a
[2:44:50] miracle walked in the door we have
[2:44:52] forgotten what God can do if a man will
[2:44:56] just believe God
[2:44:58] faith without fear faith without fear of
[2:45:03] rejection without fear of failure
[2:45:05] without fear of the devil God will do

[2:45:23] but her husband ain't ashamed of being a
[2:45:24] Catholic but she got to got him to pray

[2:45:38] because she went and he was really mad
[2:45:39] at her because she broke her ankle
[2:45:41] and they took the pictures on a Friday I
[2:45:44] believe it was what we prayed for and
[2:45:46] before they walked out of the door
[2:45:48] brother Manuel turned and looked at her
[2:45:50] son and said it's going to be okay
[2:45:52] well the son called from the hospital
[2:45:54] with the x-rays he said Uncle Manuel I

[2:46:58] it's time to remember the god that we

[2:47:15] testimony don't keep him bound
[2:47:20] I said brother Wayne what can God do
[2:47:22] I'll tell you what he can do he can do
[2:47:23] anything

[2:47:27] have a baby without a without a man the
[2:47:29] angel said all things are possible with
[2:47:31] God you know what that means it means no
[2:47:33] word ever left God's mouth without the
[2:47:35] power to fulfill it
[2:47:37] that no word God ever spoke has the
[2:47:41] power that's left his mouth that cannot
[2:47:44] be fulfilled because he had the power
[2:47:46] when he did it
[2:47:48] you say preacher them things happen well

[2:47:51] happened over here well there's brother

[2:49:33] my daughter Bethany was going through a
[2:49:35] real severe depression
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:42] it was severe enough that we had to we
[2:49:45] had to do we had to do something
[2:49:47] [Music]
[2:49:48] it wasn't just something you could say
[2:49:50] just forget it was there was something
[2:49:52] needed
[2:49:55] the doctor told me he said well what you
[2:49:57] need to do is Adopt A friend of mine he
[2:49:59] said you need to admit it to the ER
[2:50:01] and let them take her through a mental
[2:50:03] ward
[2:50:04] Port things out
[2:50:08] brother Donnie Reagan a good friend of
[2:50:11] mine I found him
[2:50:13] I said brother Reagan
[2:50:16] Bethany's going through a little
[2:50:17] struggle here and the doctor says
[2:50:19] telling me I need to do
[2:50:21] he said brother Wayne if they had the
[2:50:22] answers
[2:50:24] he said I would advise you to take her
[2:50:25] there
[2:50:27] he said but you know they don't have the
[2:50:29] answers you need
[2:50:30] [Music]
[2:50:33] I turned around and looked at Bethany I
[2:50:35] said Bethany
[2:50:37] you tell your dad where you want to go
[2:50:38] what you want to do that Devil's not
[2:50:40] staying here no longer
[2:50:42] and she said Daddy would you take me
[2:50:44] down to see brother Ron
[2:50:45] I said yes I will
[2:50:47] and we loaded her up
[2:50:49] and we drove down there to Virginia
[2:50:53] and brother Ron took time from his
[2:50:55] schedule
[2:50:56] and made time to see me
[2:51:00] we were in the hotel room the night
[2:51:01] before
[2:51:03] we were listening to brother Ronnie long
[2:51:04] preach a sermon at my church back in
[2:51:07] Ohio
[2:51:08] unknown to me he had been fasting and
[2:51:10] praying for about three days for Bethany
[2:51:12] because he knew the seriousness of the
[2:51:13] issue
[2:51:14] we were listening to the sermon in our
[2:51:16] hotel room on a Thursday night and while
[2:51:18] he was preaching he got to tell him the
[2:51:21] story of how Ahab went to the Isaiah how
[2:51:24] he went to the temple and prayed and
[2:51:26] that he was encompassed by a great
[2:51:28] company
[2:51:28] and that God told him that battle wasn't
[2:51:31] his it was the Lord's that he need to
[2:51:33] prepare
[2:51:34] and when he was saying those words
[2:51:37] the power of God dropped in that hotel
[2:51:39] room I've never told this ever to
[2:51:41] anybody
[2:51:43] I fell on my face in the middle of that
[2:51:45] hotel room and for
[2:51:47] I don't know how long
[2:51:49] I laid an intercessory prayer in another
[2:51:51] language in another dimension
[2:51:54] the next morning we got up and brother
[2:51:56] Ron met us
[2:51:58] and when we started talking he can tell
[2:52:00] you
[2:52:00] the anointing came back on me
[2:52:03] and I just went over and laid out in his
[2:52:05] floor
[2:52:07] an intercessory prayer for
[2:52:09] over an hour
[2:52:13] I was communicating with God in another
[2:52:15] language people don't believe in
[2:52:16] speaking tongues I do
[2:52:20] if you don't if you don't throw your
[2:52:22] Bible away
[2:52:27] but while we were in that place God gave
[2:52:29] brother Ron the words
[2:52:32] and he spoke those words
[2:52:37] and I went home with a different girl
[2:52:42] that demon
[2:52:44] was completely broken from that child
[2:52:49] [Applause]
[2:52:51] [Music]
[2:52:51] [Applause]
[2:52:54] I've never shared that publicly ever but
[2:52:57] I'm sharing it tonight because I believe
[2:52:58] there's some young people
[2:53:00] that need to know that that Spirit of
[2:53:02] depression is a demon
[2:53:04] and it'll take your life if you let it
[2:53:07] but there's men of God on this Earth
[2:53:09] that don't just take you to a
[2:53:11] psychologist
[2:53:12] it's okay if that's the only place you
[2:53:14] got to go but there's a God
[2:53:20] there's a real God that you can meet
[2:53:22] tonight
[2:53:23] [Music]
[2:53:27] and tonight I have a lovely daughter and
[2:53:30] a son-in-law and gonna have me another
[2:53:32] grandbaby

[2:53:38] with a spirit that the devil hates me
[2:53:41] he attacked my babies
[2:53:43] my daughter Mariah was suffering with an
[2:53:45] anxiety
[2:53:47] I preached a sermon called casting out
[2:53:49] fear and while I was preaching it
[2:53:51] brother Tim the spirit left her
[2:53:52] immediately
[2:53:56] it's a preacher why are you telling
[2:53:58] these things because I'm telling you
[2:53:59] Daddy it's your house
[2:54:01] and you don't have to lay down to that
[2:54:03] devil
[2:54:04] [Music]
[2:54:06] you don't have to just lay down and say
[2:54:08] hey man there ain't nothing we can do
[2:54:09] yes there's something you can do
