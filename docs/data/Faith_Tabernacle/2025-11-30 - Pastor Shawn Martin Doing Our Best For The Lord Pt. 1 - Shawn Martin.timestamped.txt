[30:54] everybody looks the same. You didn't
[30:56] grow too much. I think I grew out a
[30:58] little bit, but uh anyways, we had a
[31:02] good time. And so we thank the Lord for
[31:04] that. And glad we was able to make it uh
[31:08] to church today. Amen. All this uh
[31:12] weather. Amen. And I guess that's to be

[31:45] maybe just a small church, but got needs
[31:48] and um I know we've got
[31:52] those that need the Holy Ghost and I
[31:55] tell you what, I I just believe that God
[31:57] still does them things. He still fills
[31:59] with the Holy Ghost and he still answers
[32:03] prayer.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; He still works miracles.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so we want to be in that
[32:11] right attitude, that right have that uh
[32:14] be in the atmosphere to expect things
[32:17] from God. Ain't that right? Amen. And um
[32:21] and so uh if you have your Bibles, we're
[32:24] going to turn to Matthew the 9th chapter
[32:28] first of all.

[32:46] for her. Amen. And um
[32:50] doctor was surprised at how um
[32:55] uh much that tumor has shrunk.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; And they were expecting it to be a just
[33:01] shrunk maybe a centimeter. And um it was
[33:06] a uh size of a grapefruit and it's down
[33:09] to the size of a golf ball.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; So it has shrunk a lot.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the surgeon wanted to do
[33:17] surgery right away. And uh or schedule
[33:21] for surgery and uh but uh Sister Marth
[33:26] and brother Tim felt well if it's
[33:28] shrinking then we don't need to do that
[33:31] at this point. and and the uh surgeon
[33:35] says, "Well, what we're worried about is
[33:37] it shrinks too much. We can't find it."
[33:41] Well, I think that would be great.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; And uh that's a uh good thing to worry
[33:49] about, huh? Good thing at least for the
[33:51] doctors. But uh
[33:53] &gt;&gt; uh so we just thank the Lord for uh
[33:58] working on her behalf and just believing
[34:02] that God's just going to take care of
[34:05] that situation.
[34:07] Amen. And um before we go in to the
[34:11] word, may we just bow our heads and talk
[34:13] to our Lord
[34:16] and ask him for his help. Father,
[34:21] we come not as beggars,
[34:24] not as strangers, but we come as your
[34:26] children.
[34:28] Father, we realize that we were in you
[34:31] before the foundation of the world.
[34:34] And it's now coming to our
[34:38] knowledge, Father, through revelation,
[34:42] through the message,
[34:44] Lord, that we are your children here on
[34:46] this earth.
[34:48] and that we could come and sit at the
[34:50] table,
[34:52] Father, and eat of everything that you
[34:55] have provided for us.
[34:57] And Father, we're just asking now, Lord,
[35:00] that you would feed us,
[35:03] Lord, and take the words of life,
[35:06] Father. We're hungering for you. We
[35:09] realize our need for you, Father.
[35:12] And Lord, I pray that you would just
[35:15] have your way today. You know the needs
[35:18] that are present, Father, and you know
[35:20] how to meet them. May I just get myself
[35:23] out of the way, Lord, and that you could
[35:26] anoint me and use me, Lord, for your
[35:29] glory and help the people, Lord, to just
[35:33] uh get themselves out of the way, Lord,
[35:35] and pull upon the word. Father, we ask
[35:39] it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. And
[35:42] the church says,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. So, we want to look at
[35:49] Matthew the 9th chapter
[35:52] and um we'll start at the 35th verse
[35:57] and read down to the 38th. But it says,
[36:01] "And Jesus went about all the cities and
[36:04] villages teaching in their synagogues
[36:07] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[36:09] and healing every sickness and every
[36:11] disease among the people. But when he
[36:14] saw the multitudes, he was moved with
[36:17] compassion on them because they fainted
[36:20] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[36:23] having no shepherd.
[36:25] Then saith he unto his disciples, the
[36:28] harvest truly is plenteous, but the
[36:31] laborers are few.
[36:34] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
[36:36] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[36:40] into his harvest.
[36:43] Then if you will look at Matthew the
[36:47] 25th chapter
[36:52] and we'll start at the 14th verse and
[36:55] read a few verses.
[36:57] This is Jesus speaking. He says, "For
[37:00] the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[37:02] traveling into a far country who called
[37:05] his own servants and delivered unto them
[37:08] his goods.
[37:10] And unto one he gave five talents, to
[37:12] another two, to another one, to every
[37:16] man according to his several ability.
[37:21] And straightway he took uh and and
[37:24] straightway took his journey. Then he
[37:28] that had received five talents went and
[37:31] traded with the same and made them other
[37:34] five talents. And likewise he that had
[37:37] two had received two, he also gained
[37:41] other two. But he that had received one
[37:44] went and digged in the earth and hid his
[37:47] lord's money.
[37:50] After a long time the lord of those
[37:52] servants cometh and recketh with them.
[37:56] And so he that had received five talents
[37:58] came and brought other five talents,
[38:01] saying, Lord, thou deliverest unto me
[38:04] five talents. Behold, I have gained
[38:06] besides them five talents more. His lord
[38:10] said unto him, Well done, thou good and
[38:13] faithful servant. Thou hast been
[38:15] faithful over a few things. I will make
[38:18] thee ruler over many things. Enter thou
[38:21] into the joy of the Lord. He also that
[38:24] received two talents came and said,
[38:28] Lord, thou deliverest unto me two
[38:30] talents. Behold, I have gained two other
[38:32] talents besides them. His lord said unto
[38:36] him, Well done, good and faithful
[38:38] servant. Thou hast been faithful over a
[38:41] few things. I will make thee ruler over
[38:43] many things. Enter thou into the joy of
[38:47] the Lord. Then he which had received the
[38:50] one talent came and said, Lord, I knew
[38:52] thee that thou art an hard man, reaping
[38:55] where thou hast not sown, and gathering
[38:58] where thou hast not strolled. And I was
[39:01] afraid and went and hid thy talent in
[39:04] the earth. Lo, there thou hast that is
[39:07] thine. His lord answered and said unto
[39:10] him, Thou wicked and slothful servant.
[39:14] Thou knewest that I reap where I sow
[39:16] not, and gather where I have not s
[39:19] strolled. Thou ought uh therefore to
[39:23] have put my money to the exchangers, and
[39:27] then at my coming I should have received
[39:30] mine own with us. Take therefore the
[39:33] talent from him, and give it unto him
[39:36] which hath 10 talents. For unto everyone
[39:40] that hath shall be given,
[39:43] and he that uh and he shall have
[39:46] abundance, but from him that hath not
[39:49] shall be taken away even that which he
[39:52] hath. And cast ye the unprofitable
[39:56] servant into outer darkness. There shall
[39:59] be weeping and nashing of teeth. Amen.
[40:03] You can have your seats this morning.
[40:06] And I've just got a simple thought today
[40:08] and if I would title it, it would be
[40:10] doing our best for the Lord.
[40:14] Um, there are several scriptures that we
[40:17] could go to today
[40:20] uh that tell us who we are as the church
[40:25] of Christ.
[40:26] And uh and we we do hold a an important
[40:31] position on the earth. uh whether we
[40:34] realize that or not we we do uh for one
[40:38] Jesus says that we are the branch and
[40:41] that he is the vine
[40:44] and which telling us that the vine does
[40:48] not bear fruit. It is the branch that
[40:51] bears fruit. So God does not bear the
[40:54] fruit but he flows his life through us
[40:58] that we would bear the fruit. So, it
[41:01] would tell us that God, well, the
[41:02] prophet tells us God needs us in that we
[41:06] would bear his fruit for him. We're part
[41:09] of this. And also, uh, the Bible tells
[41:12] us that we are the body of Christ. Uh,
[41:17] which
[41:19] God, the Bible says, no man has seen God
[41:21] in any time, for God is a spirit. So
[41:24] then if we are his body just as Jesus
[41:28] was his body on earth uh the Bible says
[41:31] that Jesus was the image of God uh the
[41:35] prophet would say it this way he was the
[41:37] visible image of the invisible God and
[41:41] so today we are the visible image of the
[41:45] invisible God today. So it it tells us
[41:49] that we do have an important uh uh uh
[41:53] place here upon the earth. Uh then the
[41:57] Bible would tell us that we are
[41:59] ambassadors for Christ. So we are the
[42:02] vine that bears fruit. We are the body
[42:05] of Christ, the visible image of God on
[42:08] earth. And we are ambassadors for
[42:12] Christ. So we represent heaven. We
[42:16] represent deity. We represent everything
[42:19] that God is. We represent that on the
[42:22] earth. And which tells us that all
[42:26] heaven is behind us. Everything is
[42:30] behind us because we are the
[42:32] ambassadors. We speak for Christ. We act
[42:35] for Christ. And and uh uh everything
[42:38] about us is for Christ. It's uh because
[42:43] we are the ambassadors. Uh every one of
[42:46] us every one of us are asked to do
[42:49] something for the Lord
[42:51] &gt;&gt; and we have something to do for the
[42:56] kingdom and we are to work in his
[42:59] kingdom for his kingdom. Uh uh there uh
[43:04] this is why the Bible would tell us that
[43:07] we are not our own. we have been bought
[43:09] with the price. Um tells us that that uh
[43:15] uh the Lord is it's it's not just an
[43:18] object of worship but he God go God is
[43:21] not just an object of worship to us but
[43:24] he is our lord which which means that he
[43:27] is our master. He is ruler over us. And
[43:32] that is one of the the things that the
[43:35] prophet tells us that of of the
[43:37] three-fold purpose of God was that God
[43:40] could have preeminence uh in his church.
[43:43] He could have the first place. He could
[43:46] have uh first in everything in in us. Uh
[43:50] that's his desire. But we are to work in
[43:54] his kingdom at his bidding. Um
[43:59] in what he's called us to do.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Um brother Brandham would tell us God
[44:04] has so arranged it that his program
[44:08] cannot move without you and I.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Now say that again because I think
[44:13] that's important.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; God has so arranged it that his program
[44:19] cannot move without you and I. Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Now, think of that. God ordained a time
[44:26] for a rapture, but there had to be a
[44:28] people for that time
[44:31] &gt;&gt; or the rapture couldn't have come. We
[44:34] are that people. Do you believe that?
[44:38] &gt;&gt; God has arranged these things. So, now,
[44:40] Brother Brandham goes on, "And as long
[44:42] as we're not doing what God leads us to
[44:45] do, we're paralyzing his program." But
[44:49] when the church moves by the anointing
[44:51] of the Holy Ghost, then we're in God's
[44:55] will doing his program.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "Now God is
[45:01] depending on you as a member of his body
[45:05] to bear fruit of his spirit." Ain't that
[45:09] amazing? We dependent on God. Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; And yet God is depending on us. So, he's
[45:16] depending on you as a member of his body
[45:19] to bear fruit of his spirit. Now, if
[45:21] he's dependent on you, let's open up our
[45:25] channels and let the Holy Spirit come in
[45:29] tonight and energize us and free us from
[45:33] all these fears and doubts. Ain't that
[45:36] right?
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what ministry is all about.
[45:40] And we are called to do something for
[45:43] the Lord. It's doing something. It's
[45:45] it's serving for first of all, we're
[45:48] serving the Lord, but we're also serving
[45:51] people when we serve the Lord. That's
[45:54] that's the ministry.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; As parents, you're we're not just
[46:00] parents, but we're we're we're parents
[46:04] that we have the responsibility to raise
[46:08] our children and to teach them the way
[46:12] of God.
[46:13] As husbands, we have a responsibility
[46:17] uh uh that God has given us. And you
[46:21] wives uh uh God has given you a
[46:25] responsibility.
[46:27] Preachers have a responsibility.
[46:30] The lay member has the responsibility.
[46:33] Uh God did not call us all to do
[46:36] something at at all all the same thing
[46:38] as as even Paul would say, you know, uh
[46:43] one one planteth
[46:46] uh one waterth and but God giveth the
[46:50] increase. It's it's we we all have have
[46:55] something to do. We all have our part.
[46:58] And and so uh uh Romans 14:8, Paul says,
[47:03] "For whether we live, we live unto the
[47:06] Lord." Ain't that right? Whether we die,
[47:10] we die unto the Lord. So whether we
[47:13] live, therefore, or die, we are the
[47:16] Lord's or we belong to the Lord. So we
[47:20] are responsible.
[47:22] We we are responsible for what we do in
[47:25] this life. and the and we're responsible
[47:28] to him. We uh and all of us as as the
[47:33] prophet preached in that uh sermon
[47:35] running from the presence of the Lord
[47:38] and and he starts out uh telling us that
[47:42] we all have to own up to our
[47:44] responsibility.
[47:46] Every one of us have to own up. We we
[47:49] cannot hide um uh behind someone and let
[47:53] them do the work. Whatever God has
[47:56] called us to do, we must do it. And and
[48:01] we will not be responsible for what
[48:03] anybody else does. We're going to be
[48:06] responsible for what we do. You know, in
[48:09] our opening scripture there, uh it talks
[48:13] about the man who had only one talent.
[48:17] Now God didn't give them they all three
[48:22] men were not given the same amount of
[48:24] talents.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; One had five, one had two, one had one.
[48:29] And and they had variety. It it was a
[48:32] variety which Jesus was given the
[48:34] parallel
[48:36] to what the kingdom of God is. And so,
[48:40] um, but because this man only had one
[48:44] talent, he built himself up a complex
[48:50] that, well, I ain't got much to do. It
[48:53] ain't much.
[48:55] And and so instead of taking that and
[48:59] using it like like these others,
[49:03] uh, he hid the talent. And and so uh uh
[49:08] this this this complex see he he saw
[49:11] that he didn't have much to do as the
[49:13] others. He saw he wasn't doing much like
[49:16] the others. He didn't have much gifts
[49:18] and much talents or whatever. And and if
[49:21] we could say it this way maybe well this
[49:24] man didn't I I I ain't got the worldwide
[49:26] ministry like that man does. I I'm not
[49:28] out reaching so many souls like these
[49:30] guys are doing. and and uh you know I I
[49:34] I I don't have it all together like
[49:37] maybe uh this woman does or or uh or or
[49:41] or whatever. See, and and so maybe I'm
[49:44] not uh as talented as someone else in
[49:46] the church or whatever. But but and so
[49:50] he built this complex
[49:53] and then he hides the talent. But see,
[49:56] no matter what, no matter what he
[50:00] thought,
[50:02] it was important to his master,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; his master gave that to him.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; True. and and and so uh uh INSTEAD OF
[50:14] BUILDING THE COMPLEX, INSTEAD OF LOOKING
[50:17] and and feeling inferior
[50:19] to to the others, he should have just
[50:23] used it with everything that he had.
[50:27] See, AND SO WE FIND OUT JESUS IS FOR
[50:30] letting us know that that every man that
[50:34] has been given talents and and gifts is
[50:38] going to have to answer one of these
[50:39] days.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; True. Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; And we're going to answer for what we've
[50:43] done with it.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; We're going to answer on how we did it
[50:47] and what we worked with. And you may not
[50:50] have much to work with, but you work
[50:53] with what you got.
[50:55] and and and he's letting us know that
[50:58] IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO matter
[51:01] how many had this and how many had that.
[51:05] It's just going to matter did you do
[51:07] with what I've given you? What what did
[51:09] you do with that?
[51:13] So he had to answer. Now the Bible says,
[51:17] "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do
[51:21] it with all your might."
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatsoever thine hand findeth to
[51:26] do, do it with all your mind. In other
[51:27] words, do your best
[51:32] in whatever you do. Can you say amen? Do
[51:36] your best for the Lord.
[51:39] Don't just do it halfway.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Be your best. right
[51:47] now in in giving us things. God doesn't
[51:51] ask us to try to impersonate someone
[51:54] else.
[51:56] I found that ministers, young ministers
[51:59] especially,
[52:00] &gt;&gt; and it can even get into older
[52:02] ministers, but young ministers,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; uh, they start out and then they're
[52:06] trying to impersonate other ministers
[52:08] that maybe they idolize or that has good
[52:11] ministries or worldwide ministries. And
[52:14] so they they set their goals to be just
[52:17] like that.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. I've told you, you know, one time
[52:21] before a a young man was, you know, uh
[52:25] he idolized an elder preacher and and uh
[52:28] I mean, he copy him down just to a tea,
[52:31] you know, and so a pastor kept having
[52:33] this young man, you know, to preach for
[52:36] him and and he told someone, he said,
[52:37] "Now, the reason I do that, he says, cuz
[52:39] I can get him for a cheaper price than I
[52:41] could the other man." You know, and he
[52:43] was just making a joke, but he was
[52:46] saying, you know, I ain't get no one
[52:48] different, you I mean, the guy preaches
[52:50] just like him. I mean, to to the tea. I
[52:53] mean, puts his hands just like him and
[52:55] says the exact, you know, words and
[52:58] lingo and all that just like him, you
[53:00] know, so I can get him for a cheaper
[53:01] price.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; But see, that's not what God wants.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; He wants us to be our best in what we
[53:08] are to do.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, so this this isn't
[53:12] competition. We are not to compete. And
[53:14] I I think this is another thing that
[53:18] that that
[53:20] uh uh is is a bad thing about social
[53:22] media is because we get so wrapped up in
[53:26] what everybody else is doing and it
[53:29] looks it looks good. But God never
[53:32] called you mothers. God never called you
[53:34] wives to to to look at someone down the
[53:38] road and say, "Well, I want my my I I
[53:41] want to be just like that. I want my
[53:43] home to be like that. I want my husband
[53:44] like that. And you husbands looking at,
[53:46] well, I want my wife to dress like that
[53:48] and look like that and be like that and
[53:50] and and that that all just causes uh uh
[53:54] uh discontentment.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; There should never be any discontentment
[53:59] in the body of Christ
[54:02] &gt;&gt; because God didn't make us all the same.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I I think we can learn from others.
[54:11] We can take what people do and say that
[54:14] that's a good thing. You know, maybe
[54:17] maybe you see a woman, you know, in in
[54:20] prayer and or or she's she's
[54:23] consecrated. I think that ought to
[54:25] inspire us to be more consecrated.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; You you see a man anointed under his
[54:30] ministry and and and there's an
[54:32] anointing as he's preaching. Well, that
[54:35] that ought to make that ought to inspire
[54:37] all of us preachers.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But to try to be like that and try
[54:42] to copy that and and try to, you know,
[54:45] to to hold yourself the way they do it
[54:47] and and and all these things that that
[54:50] that's not the way God's done it. We are
[54:52] to be our best for the Lord.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; We are to do our best for the Lord. Not
[54:59] everybody is is has the same build and
[55:03] same makeup and and uh some people like
[55:06] to talk a lot. Some people when they
[55:08] walk in the room, they command the
[55:10] attention. I mean, it's just there. They
[55:12] can't help that. Other people when they
[55:14] come in the room, you don't even know
[55:15] they're there. And and some people, they
[55:18] they they can go out, they got a bright
[55:20] mind. They're just businessminded. Other
[55:22] people aren't businessminded. And and
[55:24] and and some people know how to, you
[55:27] know, they raise their family this way,
[55:29] and others raise their family this way.
[55:31] And and and w women, not all mothers are
[55:34] made the same. Not all husbands are made
[55:37] the same. And and and we all think
[55:39] differently. Can you say amen?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; So, so when it becomes a rat race and
[55:44] and it becomes nothing but competition,
[55:47] you know, uh uh this family competing
[55:49] against this family and and this family
[55:52] trying to keep up with this family and
[55:54] and ALL THESE THINGS THAT THAT'S NOT
[55:56] WHAT GOD INTENDED.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Now, but but we are to do our best. Now,
[56:05] the prophet said this, "He's deserving
[56:08] of the best you got.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Not of the best that someone else has,
[56:14] BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOT."
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "DON'T GIVE HIM A LITTLE
[56:21] CORNER. GIVE HIM all you've got."
[56:26] WELL, WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT, HE GAVE it to
[56:29] you.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If he's given you the
[56:33] ability to sing, it may not be like a
[56:36] Randy Travis or a Wendell Martin or
[56:41] Donnie Reagan or whatever, BUT IF YOU'VE
[56:45] GOT the ability, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[56:48] RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO PREACH. HE MAY
[56:55] HAVE NOT CALLED YOU TO BE A WAYNE
[56:57] LAWSON. HE MAY HAVE NOT CALLED YOU TO BE
[57:00] A A A Terry horn or or whatever, BUT BUT
[57:05] WHATEVER HE'S CALLED YOU TO DO, THAT'S
[57:08] WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THEN HE DESERVES THE BEST
[57:15] THAT YOU'VE GOT AND THE BEST THAT YOU
[57:19] can do.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, give your best to
[57:25] give him your best. Give him the best of
[57:28] your life. Give him the best of your
[57:31] songs. Give him all your talent. GIVE
[57:35] HIM EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. GIVE HIM YOUR
[57:39] FEET. GIVE HIM YOUR HANDS. GIVE HIM YOUR
[57:42] EYES. GIVE HIM YOUR MOUTH. GIVE HIM YOUR
[57:46] EARS. GIVE HIM YOUR SOUL. GIVE HIM YOUR
[57:49] HEART. GIVE HIM YOUR PRAISE. GIVE HIM
[57:52] EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. FOR HE'S
[57:55] DESERVING OF THE BEST.
[57:58] HOW many believes he's deserving of the
[58:00] best?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; He's deserving OF THE BEST. DON'T COME
[58:04] TO CHURCH JUST SLOUCHY. DON'T COME AND
[58:07] AND LET YOUR MIND JUST WANDER OFF AND
[58:10] AND LET THE WORLD ENTERTAIN YOU WHILE
[58:12] YOU'RE AT CHURCH.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; HE'S DESERVING OF THE BEST THAT YOU GOT.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:21] So many times WE WE ALLOW WE GIVE SATAN
[58:25] OUR MIND. DON'T YOU GIVE SATAN YOUR
[58:27] MIND.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; WE GIVE SATAN OUR THOUGHTS. WE JUST LET
[58:32] HIM RUN RAMPID WITH OUR MIND. AND AND WE
[58:35] ARE TO CAST DOWN ALL REASONINGS.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; GIVE GOD YOUR THINKING.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The Bible says,
[58:44] "Whatsoever things are of good report,
[58:46] WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE TRUE, LOVELY, AND
[58:48] OF VIRTUE, FAKE UPON THESE THINGS,
[58:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; GIVE GOD YOUR BEST."
[58:57] We shouldn't do things half-hazard.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; You brothers,
[59:04] when you go to your job, you do your
[59:06] best.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether you're an an employer
[59:12] or employee,
[59:14] you're working for yourself or you're
[59:16] working for someone else, you're doing
[59:17] your best. Why? Amen. Because you want a
[59:21] good reputation.
[59:23] And and it it would bother you just to
[59:26] do a halfway job, even if it's in your
[59:29] own company. It's something I've
[59:30] admired, you know, working with uh
[59:31] around brother Tim, you know, even even
[59:34] at our church, just doing something at
[59:36] our at our tent and uh uh uh you know,
[59:41] we he in charge of everything. And man,
[59:45] now that guy wants everything right.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; And and I mean, if it's just a little
[59:51] off the bubble, uh we ain't we ain't
[59:54] doing that, you know. And and I
[59:56] appreciate that. I brother Mark, you
[59:59] know, I've when he was behind, you know,
[1:00:01] doing the sound and all that, how
[1:00:03] professional that man was, you know, uh
[1:00:07] uh I mean, everything was clean.
[1:00:09] Everything was just right. Why? He
[1:00:11] wanted to do his best. Everything was at
[1:00:13] his best. I' I've heard, you know,
[1:00:16] Brother Brother Kevin that uh that he's
[1:00:18] he's one of the best carpenters around
[1:00:21] this area because he does it right. He's
[1:00:24] doing it his best at what he does. You
[1:00:26] understand what I'm saying? And we all
[1:00:28] doing our best. We we want to be our
[1:00:30] best in in everything. Well, then then
[1:00:32] then if we do that in the natural sense,
[1:00:36] THEN THEN CHRIST DESERVES THE BEST in
[1:00:39] everything that we do. You understand
[1:00:41] what I'm saying? Amen. And this where
[1:00:44] this is this is where we we we we want
[1:00:47] to be and AND IS STRIVE TO be the best
[1:00:50] in everything. and not because it's a
[1:00:53] pride issue, BUT BECAUSE HE IS deserving
[1:00:57] of everything that we've got and and we
[1:01:00] want to do our best. Can you say amen?
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I um
[1:01:06] a man said to brother Brandham said,
[1:01:08] "Brother Brandham, I notice what you do.
[1:01:10] You put your whole heart into it." I
[1:01:13] said, ' That's the only way you can do a
[1:01:16] right kind of a job for the Lord is put
[1:01:19] everything you've got right to the
[1:01:22] forefront for Christ. All your strength,
[1:01:26] all your soul, all your heart, all your
[1:01:31] mind, everything you've got. You
[1:01:34] understand what I'm saying? You know, it
[1:01:36] used to be when I was growing up and and
[1:01:38] and we we tried when our children were
[1:01:41] younger is is, you know, when it it come
[1:01:44] to Saturday nights, we they we get
[1:01:47] better early. We just didn't do a lot of
[1:01:49] things on a Saturday night because we
[1:01:52] were preparing for the service the next
[1:01:54] morning. You know, we I I remember one
[1:01:57] man, you know, he just constantly griped
[1:01:59] about service being too long and too
[1:02:02] long and and he'd go to the pastor, you
[1:02:04] know, Wendle, and and he would call him
[1:02:07] in the office. You preach way too long
[1:02:09] and all that. And and Wendle finally
[1:02:11] stopped and said, "I want to ask you
[1:02:13] something. What do you do on Saturday
[1:02:16] nights?" The man just stopped, you know,
[1:02:18] he just hushed up. He said, "When do you
[1:02:20] go to bed?" He goes, "Well, I get to bed
[1:02:21] about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning." He
[1:02:23] said when you can start to you know uh
[1:02:26] straightening your act on that part.
[1:02:28] Amen. Then then then we'll talk about
[1:02:30] the other. But don't come in here trying
[1:02:32] to control the service because you
[1:02:34] couldn't control yourself out there. You
[1:02:36] understand what I'm saying? BUT WE WE
[1:02:38] WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN AND
[1:02:41] EVERYTHING WE WANT, BUT WHEN IT comes to
[1:02:43] the house of God, when it comes to the
[1:02:45] things of God, we limit God.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; We limit God. Do you understand what I'm
[1:02:50] saying? We can sit and you know uh uh I
[1:02:53] was talking to a a man one time. He was
[1:02:55] getting on to me for uh it's been years
[1:02:57] ago but been getting on to me for for
[1:03:00] preaching long you know brother Ram said
[1:03:02] 45 minutes 45 minutes 45 minutes you
[1:03:04] know he never read the rest of the
[1:03:06] quotes you know and and uh uh but I
[1:03:09] asked him I said well don't do you ever
[1:03:11] watch a movie? Yeah. I said well do you
[1:03:15] just sit and watch a 45 minute or or
[1:03:18] aren't they an hour and a half? Aren't
[1:03:19] they two hours? Yeah. He said, "But them
[1:03:22] them are interesting." I thought that's
[1:03:24] exactly right. You know, it's where your
[1:03:27] heart is. It's it's the thing THAT THAT
[1:03:30] YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED. Then we'll put
[1:03:32] our energy into those things. You
[1:03:34] understand what I'M SAYING? THAT CHRIST
[1:03:37] DESERVES THE BEST. How many believes
[1:03:39] that?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; So, so we find he says, "Now, when
[1:03:43] you're doing anything, do it right or
[1:03:46] don't do it at all. Just leave it alone.
[1:03:50] YOU'RE GOING TO BE A CHRISTIAN. PUT
[1:03:52] EVERYTHING that you've got to Christ.
[1:03:55] THAT'S YOUR TIME, YOUR TALENT, YOUR
[1:03:58] EVERYTHING.
[1:04:00] Ain't that right? Now, another place he
[1:04:03] said, "There's nothing too good for
[1:04:05] Jesus. Give him your best. Give him
[1:04:07] everything you've got. Your life, your
[1:04:09] soul, your being, your time, all that
[1:04:12] you have, give to him." We know the
[1:04:16] story of Queen Sheba, Queen of Sheba,
[1:04:18] and how that uh Brother Brand talked
[1:04:20] about her quite often and and how that
[1:04:22] she had heard about what God was doing
[1:04:24] in in in Solomon and and in Israel. And
[1:04:28] so she lived a a long ways away and and
[1:04:32] several days journey and and and and she
[1:04:35] was a heathen. and and and so uh she you
[1:04:39] know, Brother Brown said she went to her
[1:04:40] priest and told her she's going I'm
[1:04:42] going over there and and see well they
[1:04:45] kicked her out of her church. If you're
[1:04:47] going to do that, then we're going to
[1:04:49] kick you out. Amen. But she she said,
[1:04:51] "BUT BEFORE I GO, I'm going to I'm going
[1:04:54] to load up my camels and I'm going to
[1:04:56] give uh bring gifts and and bring gifts
[1:04:59] of of gold and of silver and of
[1:05:02] frankincense AND AND ALL OF THESE GIFTS
[1:05:05] BECAUSE SHE SAYS, "IF IT'S TRUE, IF IT'S
[1:05:08] REAL, I WANT TO GIVE IT. I WANT TO
[1:05:11] SUPPORT IT. I WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING FOR
[1:05:14] THE CAUSE." Ain't that right? Amen. See,
[1:05:17] and and what she had to go through to
[1:05:19] get there, the prophet says through the
[1:05:21] heat and the desert and and robbers and
[1:05:24] thieves and and everything and to the
[1:05:27] natural mind, it was insane FOR HER TO
[1:05:30] TAKE ALL THEM GIFTS THROUGH ALL THAT
[1:05:32] ROUGH country and and no guarantee that,
[1:05:35] you know, they wouldn't rob her and
[1:05:37] eventually kill her or whatever. BUT SHE
[1:05:40] HEARD THAT GOD WAS IN THE CAMP. SHE
[1:05:43] HEARD THAT GOD WAS DOING SOMETHING AND
[1:05:46] SHE LONGED TO SEE GOD MOVE AND AND IF
[1:05:49] SHE'S GOING to be there, she's going to
[1:05:51] bring gifts for it.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:57] Brother says, "See,
[1:06:00] if if people only thought that level
[1:06:02] today instead of putting all of their
[1:06:04] money on some kind of a dead ritual or
[1:06:07] creed, you know, that's building
[1:06:09] million-dollar churches instead of
[1:06:10] supporting min missionaries and getting
[1:06:13] the gospel to the people, living God, a
[1:06:15] resurrected Christ, you'd be a better
[1:06:17] thinking people. Friend, don't stick
[1:06:19] your money on something that's nothing
[1:06:21] but a bunch of fanaticism. Don't support
[1:06:23] something that's dead and smelling.
[1:06:26] support Christ, the living God. Put your
[1:06:29] not not only your money, but your time,
[1:06:32] your prayers, your efforts, YOUR TALENT,
[1:06:34] EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT, GIVE IT TO HIM.
[1:06:37] Can you say amen? See, she says, well,
[1:06:40] this queen says, you know, I'll laden
[1:06:42] these uh uh camels uh with myrr and
[1:06:45] frankincense. I'll lay these laid these
[1:06:47] laden these camels with gold and silver.
[1:06:50] And if it is the truth that that living
[1:06:52] God has a living witness, then I'm going
[1:06:55] to support it. Can you say amen? Now,
[1:06:58] God didn't give us things
[1:07:02] uh for our own glory and our own
[1:07:04] amusement.
[1:07:06] I believe it is the desire of every
[1:07:08] believer
[1:07:10] to want to further God's kingdom and to
[1:07:14] work for the Lord. How many wants to
[1:07:17] work for the Lord? I I do I won't work
[1:07:21] for the Lord. I don't you know after you
[1:07:24] read the Bible characters of the Bible
[1:07:27] and you read of the history of men and
[1:07:30] women through the ages.
[1:07:32] I don't want to be one that come up and
[1:07:35] didn't do nothing for God.
[1:07:38] hear all their testimonies of them
[1:07:41] walking with God and doing something for
[1:07:44] the Lord and and then here I am without
[1:07:47] a testimony, without anything. And I I
[1:07:51] just don't want to be that. I I want to
[1:07:54] do something for God.
[1:07:56] But see, working for God is not an easy
[1:08:00] thing.
[1:08:02] And that's because we are human. God
[1:08:05] didn't call superhumans.
[1:08:08] He didn't call robots,
[1:08:12] mechanics, whatever.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; He called normal human beings
[1:08:19] to work for him. Ain't that right?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And so, it's not an easy thing to to
[1:08:26] work in the kingdom of God. Uh to be
[1:08:30] honest with you, it's harder today than
[1:08:33] ever before. Now, life is easier than it
[1:08:38] has ever been in the sense that we have
[1:08:40] our cars. We're able to travel faster.
[1:08:43] We're able to do things more
[1:08:46] uh at an easier
[1:08:50] way. Um, you know, and and these things,
[1:08:53] but yet it's it's harder. It's harder in
[1:08:57] another sense. For one, we have more
[1:09:00] demons of unbelief
[1:09:03] than we ever have before.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; The demonic powers, spirits, as the
[1:09:10] prophet said, I think in the invasion of
[1:09:12] the United States, he said, they're
[1:09:14] pouring in from everywhere.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; The the lid has been lifted, taken off
[1:09:19] from hell, and demons are just pouring
[1:09:21] in. It's never been like in this age.
[1:09:26] So, so then we're we're seeing that it
[1:09:29] it's not just elderly people. It's not
[1:09:32] just a preacher. It's not just uh uh
[1:09:35] middleage. All it's attacking ALL THE
[1:09:37] WAY DOWN TO you young people.
[1:09:40] And and we're we're finding that it's
[1:09:45] it it it's just the warfare is such a
[1:09:49] span in age groups.
[1:09:53] Um
[1:09:56] it it it it's just it's it's really
[1:09:58] amazing.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; But there has never been a time
[1:10:08] that it wasn't hard to work for the
[1:10:10] Lord. It's it's just when you look at
[1:10:13] and you read Hebrews chap 11
[1:10:16] and you see what these people had to go
[1:10:19] through
[1:10:21] and the choices they made,
[1:10:25] you really stand in awe because it's not
[1:10:28] just a story of history
[1:10:33] when you look at it as that I am a part
[1:10:37] of this.
[1:10:39] Do you realize that? Go read Hebrews
[1:10:42] chapter 11. How that women
[1:10:46] their bellies were ripped open. They
[1:10:48] they were sold a sunder like like uh
[1:10:51] Isaiah
[1:10:52] just just because he declared the word
[1:10:54] of the Lord. Just being a servant of God
[1:10:57] and declaring the word of the Lord. Men
[1:10:59] misunderstood him. Men didn't believe
[1:11:01] it. They chased him. history says they
[1:11:03] chased him and he crawled up in a hollow
[1:11:05] log and they found him and they stopped
[1:11:07] up that log and they saw that log of
[1:11:09] sunder in two and that's how Isaiah the
[1:11:13] prophet died. GLORIOUS WORDS THAT we
[1:11:16] read
[1:11:19] but the suffering that went with it, the
[1:11:22] rejection that went with doing the work
[1:11:24] of God.
[1:11:28] But
[1:11:29] they were fed to the lions as I believe
[1:11:32] the Bible says and
[1:11:34] they saw the sunder and so so many
[1:11:38] things that they went through
[1:11:41] and God asked a lot of them.
[1:11:45] See, he gave them a promise
[1:11:48] and then he asked them to believe that
[1:11:50] promise.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:11:54] and and and
[1:11:57] ask them not to let their faith waver in
[1:12:01] that promise.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Now, you got to think of that. Their
[1:12:08] faith was sorely tried.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO
[1:12:14] HAPPEN. THEY SPOKE WORDS. THEY MADE
[1:12:17] DECISIONS. THEY'VE GIVEN A PROMISE THAT
[1:12:19] WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO HAPPEN. BUT
[1:12:22] THEY HAD TO RELY UPON GOD.
[1:12:26] AND WHEN THEY DECLARED THE PROMISE TO
[1:12:28] other people, it made them feel look
[1:12:31] stupid and and OUT OF PLACE and ignorant
[1:12:35] and insane.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE THERE DOING A WORK FOR
[1:12:42] GOD.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Noah waited. Now you think of it. I'm
[1:12:52] sure it was a
[1:12:54] you know, brother Amos, when we have
[1:12:56] those times, the anointing is upon us,
[1:12:59] revelation comes and
[1:13:02] I don't know how it come to Noah.
[1:13:05] But let's say an angel of the Lord
[1:13:07] appeared to Noah and what an experience
[1:13:09] that would have been. We we all think,
[1:13:11] well, if I could just have an angel to
[1:13:13] come and live in that presence of an
[1:13:16] angel and and he just tells me the
[1:13:18] future.
[1:13:20] Well, Noah had that. He had that
[1:13:23] revelation come to him that it was going
[1:13:25] to rain. It could have been an anointing
[1:13:28] there. It could have been, oh, just a a
[1:13:31] great thing. And the inspiration hit
[1:13:34] Noah.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; And it was just, yes, sir, it's going to
[1:13:38] rain. God never told him how long it was
[1:13:40] going to be. God never told him what he
[1:13:42] was going to have to suffer for that.
[1:13:44] God never told him nothing. God just
[1:13:47] gave him the word
[1:13:49] and and told him to declare it to the
[1:13:51] people.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Noah didn't know that it was going to be
[1:13:55] 120 years before this happened.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Noah didn't know that he was going to be
[1:13:59] considered a fanatic and laughed at and
[1:14:01] mocked and scorned for just declaring
[1:14:04] what the word of the Lord said.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; NOAH DIDN'T have the angel coming to him
[1:14:10] on a daily basis. Keep it up, Noah. KEEP
[1:14:12] IT UP. KEEP IT UP. IT'S GOING TO RAIN.
[1:14:14] THERE'S TIMES THAT NOAH HAD TO JUST GET
[1:14:17] OUT BY FAITH and and and feed OFF OF
[1:14:20] WHAT GOD TOLD HIM. REMEMBER WHAT GOD
[1:14:23] SAID AT THE BEGINNING. And year after
[1:14:25] year, DAY AFTER DAY, MONTH AFTER MONTH,
[1:14:29] HE HAD TO FACE THEM PEOPLE THAT DID NOT
[1:14:31] BELIEVE HIM, THAT SCORNED AND LAUGHED AT
[1:14:34] him
[1:14:36] asking proof.
[1:14:39] And yet he had no proof
[1:14:42] except
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God said it's going to rain.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham waited 25 years for the promise.
[1:14:51] 25 years.
[1:14:53] The Hebrew boys, their faith was tried.
[1:14:58] THEY STOOD THERE AND SAID, "WE'RE NOT
[1:15:00] GOING TO BOW."
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; AND YET GOD DIDN'T COME INSTANTLY AND
[1:15:05] THEY FEEL THE ANOINTING AND SAY, "OH
[1:15:07] YES, we're right. We're vindicated."
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T COME TO THEM. AMEN.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY JUST STOOD ON WHAT THEY
[1:15:15] BELIEVED.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; And they were threatened.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they were
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; talking about scary.
[1:15:25] But yet they were there to do the work
[1:15:27] of God. We're not going to bow.
[1:15:30] We've been called by God. We're people
[1:15:32] of God. We're chosen by God. Can you say
[1:15:35] amen?
[1:15:36] See, so the faith, this is something
[1:15:38] that we all uh uh
[1:15:42] have and will continue to experience as
[1:15:45] believers. James 1:2, "My brethren,
[1:15:48] count it all joy when you fall into
[1:15:50] diverse temptations, knowing this, that
[1:15:52] the trying of your faith workketh
[1:15:53] patience." 1 Peter 4:12, "Beloved, think
[1:15:56] it not strange concerning the fiery
[1:15:59] trials which is to try you, as though
[1:16:01] some strange thing happened unto you.
[1:16:04] But rejoice in as much as you are
[1:16:05] partakers of Christ's sufferings, THAT
[1:16:07] WHEN HIS GLORY SHALL BE REVEALED, you
[1:16:10] may be glad also with exceeding joy."
[1:16:14] When is his glory going to be revealed?
[1:16:15] We We're not told. WE'RE NOT TOLD WHEN
[1:16:19] the things that that we go through and
[1:16:21] all of these things, but we know it's
[1:16:23] going to happen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "As I have overcome, you
[1:16:30] shall overcome." Ain't that right?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; So these men and women,
[1:16:35] excuse me, of the Bible, they were not
[1:16:37] superheroes, super or superhuman.
[1:16:41] Amen.
[1:16:42] We find that they were normal people
[1:16:44] that dealt with their fears. They dealt
[1:16:47] with their complexes.
[1:16:49] Moses,
[1:16:52] God chose Moses.
[1:16:54] He had a stuttering problem.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And then he is called to walk before a
[1:17:00] king, intelligent king, educated king
[1:17:04] with a stuttering problem.
[1:17:09] You would think that God would have sent
[1:17:11] someone that knew how to articulate the
[1:17:13] words right and make sure that the
[1:17:16] message is clear so nobody can
[1:17:18] misunderstand and nobody say, "What was
[1:17:20] that again? I didn't understand that."
[1:17:23] But he called a man with a stuttering
[1:17:25] problem.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And it caused Moses to have a complex.
[1:17:34] And Moses began to talk with God. I
[1:17:36] can't go.
[1:17:38] I got this problem. Right.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You find Gideon. God calls Gideon, Amen,
[1:17:45] to to deliver the children of Israel
[1:17:47] from the enemy. And yet he had
[1:17:50] complexes.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He was scared.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; He was
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; so much THAT HE HE PUT OUT A FLEECE
[1:17:58] BEFORE GOD. EVEN AFTER AN angel appeared
[1:18:00] TO HIM, HE PUTS OUT A FLEECE TO GOD.
[1:18:04] GOD, now if you really want me to go,
[1:18:06] then let this this such and such happen.
[1:18:09] God answered his prayer the next day.
[1:18:12] That still wasn't satisfactory.
[1:18:15] So he says, "Okay, I'm going to put out
[1:18:17] another fleece." So he he he puts out
[1:18:19] another God, now let it be this way,
[1:18:21] this way, this way. AND GOD ANSWERED HIS
[1:18:23] PRAYER.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; SEE, we were human.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Look at Elijah. When the anointing left
[1:18:32] him, he ran for his life because he was
[1:18:36] scared.
[1:18:38] A woman had threatened to take his life.
[1:18:41] A PROPHET OF GOD THAT HAD JUST CALLED
[1:18:45] FIRE DOWN FROM HEAVEN.
[1:18:48] And when the ANOINTING LEFT HIM, there
[1:18:51] he stood in his humanity.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:59] But whether Elijah was under the
[1:19:01] anointing or not, he was still God's
[1:19:02] prophet.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; So they all had their issues to deal
[1:19:07] with. What I liked about Elijah is he
[1:19:09] didn't run out in the world. He didn't
[1:19:10] get out to a bar and start drinking. No,
[1:19:13] his heart was right. He wanted to serve
[1:19:16] God. He was scared.
[1:19:19] He he he realized that the anointing
[1:19:22] didn't take away his humanity,
[1:19:25] but but GOD WAS ABLE TO come to him.
[1:19:28] found him hid up in a in a cave and that
[1:19:31] still small voice began to speak to
[1:19:34] Elijah.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; No matter what issues the men and women
[1:19:45] had, it didn't stop God from using them.
[1:19:50] So, so I want to tell you today, no
[1:19:52] matter what issues you have, what
[1:19:56] complexes, what fears, what weaknesses,
[1:20:00] whatever, that is no excuse.
[1:20:03] God can still use you.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I've often said, God doesn't use
[1:20:11] qualified people, but he qualifies those
[1:20:15] that he chooses
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; to use.
[1:20:19] He qualifies them by giving them his
[1:20:21] promise
[1:20:23] and his spirit. Abraham and Sarah were
[1:20:27] not qualified to have a son, but God
[1:20:29] gave them the promise
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; that qualified them.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah and Eli uh uh Zachcharias
[1:20:36] and Elizabeth were past childbearing,
[1:20:39] but God said they would have a son.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; That qualified them. Noah was a farmer,
[1:20:45] not a builder. But God told him to go
[1:20:48] and build an ark. And he TOLD NOAH JUST
[1:20:52] HOW TO BUILD IT. THAT qualified him.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Gideon didn't know how
[1:20:58] to fight a war. AND YET GOD TOLD HIM TO
[1:21:01] GO AND DELIVER ISRAEL. THAT QUALIFIED
[1:21:05] HIM.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; TOLD HIM HOW TO DO IT.
[1:21:09] Shamgard was a a farmer, but the spirit
[1:21:13] of the Lord came upon him
[1:21:16] and that qualified him. He wasn't a
[1:21:19] soldier. He didn't have experience to go
[1:21:22] defeat the enemy. But with the spirit of
[1:21:25] the Lord, he he he slew 600 Philistines.
[1:21:29] That qualified him.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There were times when
[1:21:34] the enemy was way more in number than
[1:21:36] Israel. One day the enemy was coming
[1:21:39] after the children of Israel. And the
[1:21:41] Bible says that King Jehoshaphat, a
[1:21:44] righteous man, when he got the news that
[1:21:47] these uh uh three nations were coming
[1:21:50] against him. AMEN. THAT FEAR STRUCK HIS
[1:21:53] HEART. HE FEARED.
[1:21:57] The Bible says the people feared.
[1:22:01] Here they were a people of promise.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND YET IN THEIR HUMANITY, FEAR
[1:22:07] STRUCK them
[1:22:09] because they saw the herd of of the
[1:22:12] enemy and they knew that they were
[1:22:14] outnumbered. They knew they couldn't do
[1:22:15] it upon themselves, but they knew they
[1:22:18] were chosen of God.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:23] They didn't go and run and hide. They
[1:22:25] they didn't go and just say, "I give up.
[1:22:27] I quit." No.
[1:22:30] The Bible says that Jehoshaphat set
[1:22:32] himself to seek the Lord.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He did. Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And proclaimed a fast throughout all
[1:22:38] Judah. And Judah gathered themselves
[1:22:40] together to ask help of the Lord. Even
[1:22:43] out of all the cities of Judah, they
[1:22:45] came to seek the Lord.
[1:22:48] I want to say this morning, and I trust
[1:22:51] it's a help to you today, but people are
[1:22:54] afraid to do
[1:22:57] things because they're afraid they're
[1:22:59] going to do it wrong.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, don't be like
[1:23:05] the people at Kadesh Barnea.
[1:23:09] Kesh Barnea was a testing time for them.
[1:23:12] God had given them the promise. God had
[1:23:13] given them the message.
[1:23:16] But then when they saw the giants in the
[1:23:18] land, instead of looking at the message
[1:23:20] and trusting God and walking out by
[1:23:22] faith,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; unbelief showed up in their heart.
[1:23:28] The Bible says they had an evil heart of
[1:23:30] unbelief
[1:23:32] and they cowered down and they said, "I
[1:23:35] ain't we ain't doing it. We can't do
[1:23:36] it." You understand what I'm saying?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet challenges in
[1:23:44] whatever God has called you to do. I
[1:23:46] don't care if it's just to be a
[1:23:47] housewife. I don't care if it's just to
[1:23:49] be a a a husband, a lay member in the
[1:23:53] church doing something that God has
[1:23:56] called you to do. You're going to meet
[1:23:57] challenges.
[1:23:59] You're going to meet things that
[1:24:02] are beyond you
[1:24:04] that humanly you can look at it and say
[1:24:07] there's no way it can be.
[1:24:10] And fear will try to grip you.
[1:24:13] QUESTIONS WILL TRY TO COME TO YOU.
[1:24:15] COMPLEXES. WELL, I'M NOT JUST I'M I'M
[1:24:17] NOT GOOD TO DO IT. I I I can't do it
[1:24:20] good enough.
[1:24:22] I I I'm not a good singer. I'm not a
[1:24:25] good mother. I'm not a good wife. I'M
[1:24:27] NOT A GOOD FATHER. NOT A GOOD HUSBAND.
[1:24:32] We meet these complexes.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; We meet these fears that if we're not
[1:24:37] careful, we'll find ourselves
[1:24:40] withdrawing and giving up.
[1:24:46] True.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; But see, you just have to know that God
[1:24:55] has called you.
[1:24:58] Check your motive.
[1:25:01] Ain't that right?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Am I doing it for my glory?
[1:25:06] Am I doing it to build myself up, or am
[1:25:08] I doing it because God's called me and I
[1:25:10] want to do something for God?
[1:25:13] Right?
[1:25:14] I know we've all raised children. We got
[1:25:16] children. That's the normal thing to
[1:25:18] have children. Everybody's got children
[1:25:19] just about. Not all, but you know, I'm
[1:25:22] talking about world. Sinner and
[1:25:24] Christian.
[1:25:27] But as a Christian, I want my children
[1:25:29] to know God.
[1:25:32] As a Christian, I want to be a godly
[1:25:34] father.
[1:25:36] As a Christian, I I WANT TO BE SUCH A AN
[1:25:39] INFLUENCE in their life. I I WANT TO SEE
[1:25:41] THEM THRIVE AND THAT IF GOD WOULD EVER
[1:25:43] TAKE ME OFF THE SCENE, THEY'LL carry it
[1:25:45] on.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Serving God.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; My wife feels that way.
[1:25:52] I believe every one of you do as
[1:25:54] parents.
[1:25:56] And because of that, you see more you
[1:25:59] see the enemy more challenging than it
[1:26:02] would be if you didn't care. There's
[1:26:04] parents that just don't care about their
[1:26:06] children.
[1:26:08] They they don't care what they watch.
[1:26:10] They don't care how what friends they
[1:26:12] hang out with. They don't care.
[1:26:15] They'll just let them go off. Some of
[1:26:17] them even adopt them or just leave them
[1:26:20] off at the porch. But a lot of them just
[1:26:21] keep them in the house and don't don't
[1:26:23] don't do nothing.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; They don't have no guidelines. And you
[1:26:27] know, it it's it's tough being a parent
[1:26:29] and having guidelines for your children.
[1:26:32] It's tough
[1:26:35] being being a parent and and and and and
[1:26:38] not just raising them as though we all
[1:26:41] know they're going to get big. We all
[1:26:43] know they're going to grow up, so we
[1:26:46] just feed them, right? But there's more
[1:26:48] than just feeding.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; It's teaching them the ways of God.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand.
[1:26:59] But see, every one of these people in
[1:27:01] the Bible that God used had their
[1:27:03] failures and mistakes. But one thing
[1:27:05] that we can say about them is they never
[1:27:07] quit and they never gave up.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; They never quit and they never gave up.
[1:27:15] Can you say amen?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; James 5:17
[1:27:19] says, "Elias was a man subject to like
[1:27:22] passions as we are."
[1:27:24] The prophet said he was just apt to make
[1:27:26] a mistake as you and I as you are or I
[1:27:30] am. He's just he he's just as apt to do
[1:27:34] something wrong as you are or I am.
[1:27:37] Another place he had his ups and downs.
[1:27:40] He wasn't an angelic being. He was a
[1:27:43] man. Big old rough looking fella. Hairy
[1:27:48] body and his hair sticking out like one
[1:27:50] of these fuzzy worms. his beard out like
[1:27:53] that and a piece of leather wrapped
[1:27:54] around his body. If he come up to your
[1:27:57] house begging, you'd run away from the
[1:27:59] door perhaps. But beneath that old brown
[1:28:02] skin be the heart that was true to God.
[1:28:06] Are you with me?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. See,
[1:28:10] Brother Brandham talks about that
[1:28:12] company. You know, Ballard and Ballards
[1:28:16] fell went over there for a job interview
[1:28:19] and they asked him to sign his name to
[1:28:21] the paper and when he went to sign, he
[1:28:23] didn't have anything. And uh he didn't
[1:28:26] have an eraser at the end of his pencil.
[1:28:29] And and and and the man interviewing
[1:28:31] says, "You have no eraser?" He said,
[1:28:33] "Well, I don't need it. I don't make
[1:28:35] mistakes." Mr. Ballard says, "Well, then
[1:28:37] I can't use you. You ain't going to do
[1:28:40] nothing."
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; I can't use you. You ain't going to do
[1:28:45] nothing. And and and that's the if
[1:28:47] you're afraid to make mistakes for God,
[1:28:50] God can't use you cuz you ain't going to
[1:28:52] do nothing.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; It's easy to look at other people's
[1:28:58] mistakes.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; But if you're ever going to do something
[1:29:02] for God, you're going to make mistakes.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to fail.
[1:29:10] I I I might be speaking to human
[1:29:12] superhuman people here, but I don't
[1:29:15] think so.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; your life is going to have regrets.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to feel like a failure.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; But see, down beneath all of that,
[1:29:28] there's a heartbeating true to God.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER BRAM SAYS, I THINK that's
[1:29:37] about right. If we don't make mistakes,
[1:29:39] we're not doing anything. But what I
[1:29:42] like about a person is that when you
[1:29:44] make a mistake, a real soldier,
[1:29:46] everybody say a real soldier.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. A real soldier.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; A REAL SOLDIER is ready to rise and try
[1:29:55] again.
[1:29:56] There used to be a little song we sing,
[1:29:58] if I fail, there's something or another.
[1:30:00] Let me rise and try again. Forgive me,
[1:30:03] Lord, and try me one more time. He says,
[1:30:05] "I have prayed that so much to God that
[1:30:08] I'm ashamed of myself almost. Let me
[1:30:11] rise and try again.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Constantly falling." And each time he's
[1:30:18] been merciful to help me to come back
[1:30:20] again.
[1:30:24] Can you say amen?
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] So he says now if we just look it over
[1:30:29] there isn't an hour through the day
[1:30:32] hardly but what we do something that's
[1:30:34] wrong.
[1:30:35] Now he said there's no little ones or
[1:30:37] big ones there. They're all big ones
[1:30:39] before God talking about our mistakes
[1:30:41] and our failures. So if Apostle Paul had
[1:30:44] to die daily, how much more will we have
[1:30:46] to die daily? Then I think a person that
[1:30:49] has done something wrong and is willing
[1:30:51] to make it right, the real Christian
[1:30:53] attitude is to forgive that person. And
[1:30:57] there's where I think brother Graham and
[1:30:59] the per the church people today miss it
[1:31:01] so much instead of trying to raise this
[1:31:03] person back up with just keep shoving
[1:31:06] them further. Christ when we were the
[1:31:09] lowest when we were the lowest, he
[1:31:13] stooped and picked us up. And so that
[1:31:17] makes it to where we ought to have that
[1:31:19] kind of spirit too. Can you say amen?
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, if you don't make
[1:31:24] no mistakes, you're not doing nothing.
[1:31:26] So let's go, brother. Be up and going.
[1:31:32] Another place God don't hold you
[1:31:34] responsible for your mistakes. He holds
[1:31:36] you responsible for your willful sin. He
[1:31:40] that sins willfully after he has
[1:31:43] received the knowledge of truth. But a
[1:31:44] man THAT'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING is
[1:31:46] going to blunder.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; A man that's going to do something, a
[1:31:55] woman, a boy, GIRL THAT'S GOING TO DO
[1:31:57] SOMETHING, he's going to blunder. HE'S
[1:31:59] GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. But if HE'S
[1:32:02] REALLY DIVINELY CALLED AND GOD IS IN HIS
[1:32:05] HEART, he'll rise again.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Moses had his mistakes
[1:32:19] and God stayed with him in his mistakes.
[1:32:23] Prophet said no matter what Moses done,
[1:32:25] it was Moses's office that God
[1:32:27] respected. He was a prophet. He was
[1:32:30] above all the prophets. Another place he
[1:32:33] says God had commissioned Moses. His
[1:32:35] failures meant nothing. God knowed his
[1:32:38] heart.
[1:32:40] So then when Joshua was commissioned to
[1:32:44] take the people over into the land,
[1:32:46] Moses had already gone. But God told
[1:32:49] Joshua, he says, "Now remember, as I was
[1:32:52] with Moses, so shall I be with thee."
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet, he took that. Now, we
[1:32:57] might have taken that, well, man, he'll
[1:32:59] get to see the angel then, and he'll get
[1:33:01] to do this, and he'll get to be under
[1:33:03] that anointing and experience the
[1:33:04] supernatural and all these things. But
[1:33:06] what the prophet said is that was a
[1:33:09] consolation to Joshua because Joshua
[1:33:12] knew that in all of Moses's failures and
[1:33:16] mistakes, God stayed with him.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; AND JOSHUA KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO
[1:33:23] MAKE MISTAKES, BUT GOD SAID, "AS I STOOD
[1:33:26] WITH MOSES AND HIS, I'LL stay with you
[1:33:29] and yours."
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:35] The prophet said after reading this
[1:33:37] scripture as I was with Moses, he says
[1:33:40] we find here that God in spite of all
[1:33:42] the failure that Moses had done, he
[1:33:44] still had his hand on him. He called him
[1:33:46] to go do his service, calling him to his
[1:33:49] commission. And what a consolation that
[1:33:51] must have been to Joshua when he heard
[1:33:54] God say, "As I was with Moses, so I'll
[1:33:55] be with thee. ALTHOUGH IF I'M TRYING and
[1:33:58] I fail, God won't leave me.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; OF ALL THE TIMES WE FAIL and trying, God
[1:34:09] won't leave us.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; I don't have much confidence in anybody
[1:34:14] that's too afraid to do anything. I'd
[1:34:16] rather be found a failure than too lazy
[1:34:19] to try.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:25] And it's true.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Another place he said, "I'd rather be
[1:34:29] found making a mistake than crying on
[1:34:31] the sideline criticizing those who are
[1:34:33] trying to do something." Anyhow,
[1:34:37] I'll just be honest. I, you know, you
[1:34:40] kind of got into the I kind of got in a
[1:34:42] mood of just feeling just that way of
[1:34:45] failure.
[1:34:47] all my mistakes and all that being
[1:34:50] brought before me and I'm thinking, good
[1:34:52] night,
[1:34:56] I probably ought to walk away from even
[1:34:58] the just being a father,
[1:35:02] being a a husband, being a a pastor.
[1:35:08] And it was in them times that Satan was
[1:35:10] just really working on my mind. See,
[1:35:12] look what you are. Look what you are.
[1:35:14] Look what you are. I wasn't even looking
[1:35:17] for it,
[1:35:21] but I just opened up the my laptop
[1:35:27] and
[1:35:30] these quotes started just coming before
[1:35:34] me.
[1:35:36] I'd rather be found a failure
[1:35:40] and trying than too lazy and not try.
[1:35:44] Another
[1:35:48] one, Brother Brham says, "Brother, I'd
[1:35:50] rather be found on the battlefield
[1:35:52] making mistakes than to be a criticizer
[1:35:54] of the man that's trying to get so saved
[1:35:56] to God."
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; And these words became a comfort to me
[1:36:02] because I realized then that Satan was
[1:36:05] talking, but God began to talk through
[1:36:08] the words of a prophet.
[1:36:10] It ain't time to quit.
[1:36:12] It's time to keep on going.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Satan
[1:36:18] may be talking telling you parents that,
[1:36:20] "Oh, look at me. You know, I just I blew
[1:36:22] it. I'm a loser and I'm this. I just if
[1:36:25] I only could have." No, you done your
[1:36:27] best. You tried. And I say to you young
[1:36:31] young mothers and fathers, keep trying.
[1:36:34] Keep trying. Keep trying. Don't give up.
[1:36:36] Keep trying.
[1:36:40] You're not failing.
[1:36:43] You're doing exactly what God called you
[1:36:45] to do. Raise your children right.
[1:36:51] It's easy to look at everybody else and
[1:36:53] criticize them. I've done it. Sad to
[1:36:56] say, just being honest.
[1:37:00] But other people have done it to me.
[1:37:02] Especially when you're raising your
[1:37:03] kids.
[1:37:06] Here I am doing my best to raise my
[1:37:08] kids.
[1:37:12] And then I found out, you know, my three
[1:37:14] oldest, you know, that someone says,
[1:37:17] "Man, I hate dread when they get older.
[1:37:20] They're going to be Helens."
[1:37:24] Well, I found out later why he said
[1:37:26] that. You know, I think it was Daniel
[1:37:29] or Faith or whatever. You know, they
[1:37:32] were watching. I had family members
[1:37:34] watching my kids. They were going
[1:37:35] Chickaoo chicka poo chickaoo. you know,
[1:37:39] tell them to do. Well, I don't have to
[1:37:40] do it,
[1:37:42] you know.
[1:37:44] So, when I pick up my children, they
[1:37:47] left with the impression these little
[1:37:48] devils.
[1:37:52] They don't get whipped big hard enough.
[1:37:54] They don't get corrected hard enough.
[1:37:56] And I'm thinking, good Lord, I'm doing
[1:37:57] everything I know to do instead of kill
[1:38:00] them.
[1:38:04] That no matter what you do, you're going
[1:38:06] to have failures. You're going to make
[1:38:07] mistakes,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; but that's part of the kingdom.
[1:38:12] It would be easy just to lay it down and
[1:38:14] just say, you know what? I want to be
[1:38:16] their friend. I want them to like me.
[1:38:18] I'm going to like them. I'll give them
[1:38:20] candy every day of their life. I won't
[1:38:22] make them eat their okra and their
[1:38:24] vegetables and whatever they don't want
[1:38:26] to do, I ain't going to make them do.
[1:38:28] And and and I'm just I'm just going to
[1:38:30] we're going to live free love, freefor
[1:38:32] all, just have a good old time. That's
[1:38:34] not what God called us to do. Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And that would be even in the church.
[1:38:46] That would be even in anything of our
[1:38:48] lives.
[1:38:53] I hope this all right. This morning,
[1:38:56] I want to just say this. Do not let
[1:38:58] anyone define who you are as a believer.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:39:04] It is easy for people to look at us as
[1:39:06] human beings and define us. Is it is it
[1:39:10] is easy for us to look at our mistakes
[1:39:12] and define our own selves.
[1:39:15] And if we are not careful, we'll define
[1:39:18] others by what we see about them.
[1:39:23] I look at David for example in the
[1:39:26] Bible. He was a ruddy boy.
[1:39:30] He didn't look to be a king.
[1:39:33] He looked everything but a king. Even
[1:39:36] when the prophet was sent, God told the
[1:39:39] prophet, "Go down to the house of Jesse.
[1:39:41] There's a king there. I want you to
[1:39:42] anoint." He didn't tell him who.
[1:39:48] Samuel just went.
[1:39:51] And there was boys, David's brethren,
[1:39:54] that was older than him. Every time they
[1:39:56] appear to him, Samuel looked at their
[1:39:58] appearance and says, "Surely this is the
[1:39:59] Lord's anointed." And when he got ready
[1:40:01] to do it, no, God said 8 to one.
[1:40:05] He went through every one of them. And
[1:40:07] Sam Samuel the prophet's ex, you know,
[1:40:10] he's exasperated. He's like, don't don't
[1:40:12] you have anyone else?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, we got one. But he's the
[1:40:18] youngest and he's out there with sheep.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; But when David came before that man,
[1:40:24] that prophet, God says, "This is the
[1:40:25] man."
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. David didn't look like a slant J a
[1:40:29] giant slayer, but he was
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; By his appearance, he he didn't look
[1:40:35] like a boy that could kill a lion, but
[1:40:37] he did.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ONE THAT THAT would
[1:40:41] destroy a bear, BUT HE DID. HE DIDN'T
[1:40:43] LOOK LIKE ONE THAT would be uh his
[1:40:45] THRONE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED FOREVER, BUT
[1:40:47] GOD DID IT.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He was everything but. But God chose
[1:40:53] him.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; So don't let anyone define you as to who
[1:41:02] you are. There's only one place that we
[1:41:05] can look to that would define us
[1:41:07] accurately and that's God's word. That
[1:41:10] word define means to determine or
[1:41:12] identify the essential qualities or
[1:41:15] meaning of
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; to discover and set forth the meaning of
[1:41:19] something. to make a definition
[1:41:22] and there's only one that describes you
[1:41:24] and defines you and that's the Bible.
[1:41:26] Can you say amen? And even though God's
[1:41:29] word uh uh is what defines us, it took a
[1:41:32] prophet to look in the scriptures and by
[1:41:36] REVELATION PULL OUT THE TRUE
[1:41:38] INTERPRETATION OF WHO WE ARE.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; This message defines us. Do you believe
[1:41:44] it? He had a vision of what we are. He
[1:41:48] said, "A few weeks ago, I was in a
[1:41:50] vision. I was standing up on a high
[1:41:52] place, and I was to see the preview of
[1:41:54] the church. And I noticed I was standing
[1:41:56] more like this way, facing the west, and
[1:41:59] coming this way was a lovely bunch of
[1:42:02] women, really nice dress, long hair
[1:42:04] fixed nice in the back, sleeves, and
[1:42:06] skirts down neatly. They were all in a
[1:42:09] marching tune like onward Christian
[1:42:11] soldiers marching as to war with the
[1:42:14] cross of Jesus going on before. And as
[1:42:16] they passed, I stood and there was
[1:42:18] something there. Some spirit was God and
[1:42:21] said, "There is the bride."
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; God was uh defining who she was.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; There's the bride.
[1:42:35] And I looked and my heart was happy. And
[1:42:37] she went around this way and passed
[1:42:38] around me. And after a while when she
[1:42:41] come back like back this way, it said,
[1:42:43] "Now the modern church will come into
[1:42:45] preview." And here come the Asian church
[1:42:47] up and I never seen such a filthy bunch.
[1:42:49] Here come the other churches up of the
[1:42:51] different nations and they looked
[1:42:53] horrible.
[1:42:56] He said, "I say this because I'm duty
[1:42:57] bound to tell the truth before God."
[1:43:00] When he said, "Here comes the church of
[1:43:02] America now to be previewed. I I I if I
[1:43:05] ever seen a bunch of devils, it was
[1:43:07] that." See, them women were straighten
[1:43:10] naked with old an old gray looking thing
[1:43:13] like a color of an elephant's hide and
[1:43:16] they was holding it in front of them
[1:43:17] with no upper part on it at all. And
[1:43:20] they were doing this kind of stuff,
[1:43:22] these dances that these kids do out here
[1:43:24] and that stuff that twist and stuff and
[1:43:27] that kind of music going on. And when I
[1:43:29] seen MissUSA come up, I almost fainted.
[1:43:33] Now this is thus sayith the Lord. You
[1:43:34] believe me to be a servant. You believe
[1:43:37] me now. I wouldn't say that for nothing
[1:43:39] in the world. There's not enough money
[1:43:41] in the world to get me to say that if it
[1:43:42] wasn't true. And when she came by, that
[1:43:45] was the filthiest looking thing I ever
[1:43:47] seen. I thought, "God, is hard as
[1:43:49] preachers and we brethren have labored
[1:43:52] to get you a bride, and that's the best
[1:43:54] we could do." She was twisting and
[1:43:56] holding this in front of her like one of
[1:43:59] these hoola skirts of a thing and
[1:44:01] holding it in front of her parts, her
[1:44:03] lower part like this, dancing, twisting
[1:44:06] like these kids do out here on these
[1:44:08] vulgar shows that they have twisting.
[1:44:10] That was Miss Christianity of America.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; So help me by the help of God. That's
[1:44:17] what it looks like in his face. I could
[1:44:19] have fainted. I thought all the trying
[1:44:22] and the preaching and the persuading
[1:44:23] every one of them with bobbed hair and
[1:44:25] they were twisting and carrying on
[1:44:27] holding this in front. They come around
[1:44:29] where I was standing there with this
[1:44:31] supernatural being. I couldn't see him.
[1:44:34] I'd hear him talking to me was right
[1:44:36] around me. But when they turned this
[1:44:39] way, they held this way or hold this.
[1:44:41] They was just twisting, laughing,
[1:44:43] carrying on like that, holding this in
[1:44:45] front of them. Now me standing in his
[1:44:48] presence there and his servant and of
[1:44:50] all I tried that's the best I could do.
[1:44:53] I thought God what good did it do me?
[1:44:56] What what good did it do? All the
[1:44:58] crying, the begging, persuading and the
[1:45:00] great signs and wonders and miracles
[1:45:02] that you have shown and how I stood
[1:45:05] there and go home and cry after
[1:45:06] preaching to them and things. What good
[1:45:09] did it do me? Then I have to present
[1:45:12] something like that for you for a bride.
[1:45:15] And as I stood there looking, she passed
[1:45:18] on by. And you can imagine the back part
[1:45:21] of her with nothing on holding this in
[1:45:24] front of her like she was went shimmying
[1:45:26] by like that to this twist throwing her
[1:45:29] limbs out like that. Oh, her. He said,
[1:45:32] "Oh, it was vulgar how she was carrying
[1:45:34] on her body shaking like that." You say,
[1:45:36] "What does it mean, Brother Brandham?" I
[1:45:38] don't know. I'm just telling you what I
[1:45:40] seen.
[1:45:41] And when she passed by like that, I
[1:45:43] looked at her and I just got real faint
[1:45:45] and I I just turned around. I thought,
[1:45:47] "God, I'm condemned.
[1:45:50] There's no need of me trying anymore. I
[1:45:52] just might as well quit." He said, "Miss
[1:45:55] Carl Williams, if you're sitting here,
[1:45:58] that dream that you told me about," he
[1:46:00] said, "you had the other night," he
[1:46:01] said, "the steering wheel is taken from
[1:46:03] my hand." He said, "And I just thought,
[1:46:06] you know, I might as well forget it. I
[1:46:07] was gone. And then all at once, I heard
[1:46:10] it coming again." And and coming up on
[1:46:13] this side come the same bride that went
[1:46:15] around this way. Here come them little
[1:46:17] ladies again. Each one of them was
[1:46:19] dressed in their national garb from
[1:46:21] where they had come from like
[1:46:23] Switzerland, Germany and so forth. Each
[1:46:25] one wearing that kind of garb all long
[1:46:28] hair just exactly like the one at the
[1:46:30] first. Here they was coming walking.
[1:46:33] Onward Christian soldiers marching as to
[1:46:35] war. And when they passed by the preview
[1:46:38] stand where they we were standing, just
[1:46:40] all at once, every eye went that way.
[1:46:43] And they turned back and they went on
[1:46:45] marching. And just as they started going
[1:46:47] right up into the skies, this other one
[1:46:50] went up to the brink of a hill and went
[1:46:52] down like that. See, they started
[1:46:54] marching right on up into the sky. And
[1:46:57] when they went to marching, I noticed a
[1:46:59] couple of little girls getting in the
[1:47:01] back. And they looked like might be some
[1:47:03] foreign girl, Swedish or Switzerland or
[1:47:05] somewhere. And they started to get look
[1:47:06] around. I said, "Don't do that. Don't
[1:47:08] get out of step." And as I screamed, I
[1:47:10] come to in the vision
[1:47:12] standing there with my hand out like
[1:47:14] that. You see, what was he seeing? God
[1:47:17] was showing him that there is a bride.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; He was showing him us. I truly believe
[1:47:22] that. And even though this bride, this
[1:47:25] little lady was marching, no doubt she
[1:47:28] was, she had her problems
[1:47:31] as we do.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had had her inferiority
[1:47:36] complexes,
[1:47:38] had her weaknesses, had her failures,
[1:47:40] but she kept marching,
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; doing her best for God, staying true to
[1:47:45] the word, staying true to this message,
[1:47:48] doing her best. Can you say amen? You
[1:47:52] love the Lord.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; This message is what defines us. If the
[1:47:57] musicians will come,
[1:48:02] Revelations 22:17 says, "And the spirit
[1:48:04] and the bride say come."
[1:48:07] And the prophet of God shows how this
[1:48:09] happens, how she would have a voice. He
[1:48:13] says, "In the dark ages, the word was
[1:48:15] almost entirely lost to the people, but
[1:48:17] God sent Luther with the word. The
[1:48:19] Lutheran spoke for God at that time, but
[1:48:21] they organized." Then again the pure
[1:48:23] word was lost for organization trends
[1:48:25] toward dogma and creeds and not simple
[1:48:27] word. They could no longer speak for
[1:48:29] God. Then God sent Wesley and he was the
[1:48:32] voice of the word in his day. The people
[1:48:34] took his revelation from God become the
[1:48:36] living epistles read and known of all
[1:48:38] men for their generation. When the
[1:48:40] Methodists failed, God raised up others.
[1:48:42] And so it has gone on through the years
[1:48:44] until in this last day there is again
[1:48:47] another people in the land who under
[1:48:50] their messenger Malachi 4, right? Under
[1:48:54] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:48:57] to the final age.
[1:49:00] Superhum. No, just common ordinary
[1:49:05] people
[1:49:06] that has their ups and downs
[1:49:10] that has to say, "I'm sorry."
[1:49:14] That has to ask for forgiveness, that
[1:49:16] has to ask God for mercy.
[1:49:19] And yet God chose us for this age to be
[1:49:22] the final voice to the final age. And it
[1:49:25] isn't our word. It's a word of
[1:49:27] authority. That same word that spoke in
[1:49:30] the beginning, let there be and there
[1:49:33] was. That word is now being spoken
[1:49:36] through the bride. She is the final
[1:49:39] voice to the final age. The prophet
[1:49:42] said, "The church is no longer the
[1:49:44] mouthpiece of God. It's its own
[1:49:45] mouthpiece." So God is turning on her
[1:49:48] and he will confound her through the
[1:49:51] prophet and the bride. For the voice of
[1:49:54] God will be in her.
[1:50:00] It will be in her.
[1:50:03] Amen. Do you love him?
[1:50:07] I love him.
[1:50:09] We look at what the prophet said about
[1:50:11] the church being a super race, an
[1:50:13] invincible army.
[1:50:17] He's trying to define us. He's defining
[1:50:20] us as who we are. Don't let your
[1:50:22] problems define you. Don't let your
[1:50:24] mistakes and your failures. Don't let
[1:50:26] what people think of you define you. Let
[1:50:28] God's word define you.
[1:50:33] Don't let the enemy that looks so much
[1:50:35] bigger than you
[1:50:38] define you. Remember what Israel said
[1:50:41] are as grasshoppers in their sight.
[1:50:45] Don't let the giant
[1:50:48] Don't let your problem define you. Let
[1:50:50] the word of God define you.
[1:50:53] Do the work.
[1:50:55] Do the work. Keep pressing on. Don't
[1:50:58] hold back.
[1:51:00] Don't get your complexes to where you
[1:51:02] don't want to do nothing. Well, I get
[1:51:04] embarrassed. I I just don't like
[1:51:06] standing before people. But if God has
[1:51:08] called you to do something, do it. I
[1:51:12] ain't getting on to anyone. I'm I'm just
[1:51:14] saying you've got something to do.
[1:51:18] We could all have excuses of not doing
[1:51:21] something for God. If if if I let things
[1:51:24] uh bother me, I wouldn't be standing
[1:51:26] here today. I don't feel like I should
[1:51:28] stand here. I don't feel it's not that I
[1:51:30] broken scriptures or anything. It's just
[1:51:33] you you know you you're just a man of of
[1:51:35] of of failure, a man of of whatever. Not
[1:51:39] a perfect man. But there's one thing
[1:51:41] about it. The word defines me.
[1:51:45] Are you with me? The word defines me. We
[1:51:48] don't feel like coming to church all the
[1:51:50] time, but we come. We come because we're
[1:51:53] doing something for God. We got a place
[1:51:55] for God. We're doing something. God has
[1:51:57] called us to do something. And we're
[1:52:00] faithful. And you remember, you remember
[1:52:03] what Jesus said about them men? Well
[1:52:06] done, thou good and faithful servant.
[1:52:09] Enter into the joy of the Lord. Can you
[1:52:14] say amen?
[1:52:16] Amen.
[1:52:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:22] I want to live
[1:52:25] the way
[1:52:28] he wants me to live.
[1:52:33] I want to give
[1:52:36] until there's just no
[1:52:41] to give.
[1:52:43] I want to love
[1:52:47] love till there's just no
[1:52:51] more love.
[1:52:54] I could never
[1:52:56] ever love.
[1:53:02] I thought of what brother Wendell had
[1:53:04] spoke
[1:53:08] two weeks ago, I guess, now
[1:53:11] talking about, you know, the the three
[1:53:13] women that Brother Brandham used as an
[1:53:16] illustration.
[1:53:20] Brother Random talking there in the
[1:53:23] shock shall uh the the seed shall not
[1:53:26] bear with the shock and other other
[1:53:28] sermons but he's defining
[1:53:33] the bride of Christ and he uses the
[1:53:36] illustration of the three women Hagar
[1:53:38] Sarah and Mary Hagar represented the
[1:53:41] Lutherans age Sarah represented Wesleyan
[1:53:46] age Mary represented the Pentecostals
[1:53:51] All three of those women were just
[1:53:53] carriers of life. They were not the
[1:53:55] seed. They were just carriers.
[1:53:58] Hagar brought forth Ishmael, a wild son.
[1:54:02] Sarah brought forth Isaac, the natural
[1:54:04] seed of promise. Mary brought forth
[1:54:06] Christ, the royal seed, the word seed of
[1:54:10] promise.
[1:54:12] And and as the prophet speaking of these
[1:54:15] things, he does not define the bride by
[1:54:18] these women.
[1:54:20] He doesn't use these women to define the
[1:54:22] bride.
[1:54:30] He didn't use Luther to define us. He
[1:54:32] didn't use Wesley to define us. He
[1:54:35] didn't he didn't put us in the category
[1:54:37] of the Pentecostals.
[1:54:39] He said that was the shock, the the
[1:54:42] tossel
[1:54:43] uh the tossel uh stock and and shuck
[1:54:47] Pentecostals of the shock. He took
[1:54:50] scriptures that only are applicable to
[1:54:53] our day and showed us who we are.
[1:54:58] And we realize this is the day of the
[1:55:01] revealing of the son of man.
[1:55:05] We are not another carrier of the word
[1:55:09] or of the seed. We are the seed.
[1:55:13] Just as Christ was the seed, the
[1:55:15] promised seed, so are we the promised
[1:55:19] seed. Aren't you glad for that? In all
[1:55:23] of our failures and all of our mistakes
[1:55:26] and all of our ups and downs and all
[1:55:28] that, we are the seed. It took a prophet
[1:55:32] to identify us and say, "There she is.
[1:55:35] She's on earth. She is him. She's life
[1:55:39] of his life, power of his power, bone of
[1:55:42] his bone, flesh of his flesh, word of
[1:55:44] his word. She is him."
[1:55:48] Hallelujah.
[1:55:50] He was able to look past everything else
[1:55:54] and really see the heart and say,
[1:55:57] "That's what God has chosen for this day
[1:55:59] to be the final voice." Aren't you glad
[1:56:02] you're that? I'm so glad. This is seed
[1:56:05] time. This is bride time.
[1:56:08] Oh, I want to love
[1:56:13] till there's just no more love.
[1:56:19] I can never
[1:56:22] never out love
[1:56:24] the Lord.
[1:56:27] Sing it again.
[1:56:29] I want to live
[1:56:32] the way
[1:56:35] he wants me to live.
[1:56:39] I want to give
[1:56:42] until there's just no more to give.
[1:56:49] I want to love
[1:56:53] love till there's just no
[1:56:58] end.
[1:57:01] I can never ever out love
[1:57:05] the Lord one more time.
[1:57:09] Oh, I want to live
[1:57:13] the way God.
[1:57:16] He wants me to live. I want to give
[1:57:23] until there's just no more to give.
[1:57:30] I want to love
[1:57:34] love till there's just no more love.
[1:57:41] I can never
[1:57:43] ever out love
[1:57:46] the Lord. In Jesus name we press on.
[1:57:52] again
[1:57:54] in Jesus name.
[1:57:58] We press on
[1:58:07] in Jesus
[1:58:09] name
[1:58:11] we press on
[1:58:18] dear Lord
[1:58:20] with the prize
[1:58:25] clear before our eyes
[1:58:32] we find the strength
[1:58:36] to press on.
[1:58:43] Oh him, can we just stand to our feet
[1:58:47] and sing it with our heart? We press on.
[1:58:56] Yeah. In Jesus
[1:58:59] name
[1:59:01] we press on
[1:59:08] dear Lord
[1:59:10] with the pride
[1:59:14] clear before our eyes.
[1:59:22] We find the strength
[1:59:26] to press on. Is that the way you feel
[1:59:29] today?
[1:59:30] Say it again. All in
[1:59:35] Jesus name.
[1:59:38] Something pushing us, something urging
[1:59:40] us on.
[1:59:42] Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] Oh
[1:59:47] Jesus
[1:59:48] name.
[1:59:52] Oh, you may be scarred. You may be from
[1:59:56] the battles and all that, but all the
[2:00:01] reward will be great.
[2:00:05] Press on. Don't quit. Keep pressing.
[2:00:09] Keep praying.
[2:00:11] Keep that dedication.
[2:00:14] Keep teaching. Keep preaching. Keep
[2:00:16] singing.
[2:00:18] Keep playing the music.
[2:00:21] Stand in your post of duty.
[2:00:24] We're going home, church.
[2:00:27] Going home.
[2:00:29] I think of what brother Brandham said
[2:00:31] about that.
[2:00:34] Caesar, I believe it was. He was looking
[2:00:37] for a man to ride with him. And he's
[2:00:39] looking at all these men with shiny
[2:00:42] shields and shiny swords and their armor
[2:00:46] was just intact, man.
[2:00:48] As he was riding down there, I think
[2:00:51] maybe toward the last he sees an old man
[2:00:54] or a man that was scarred up,
[2:00:59] looked looked worn, looked tattered.
[2:01:05] He stopped and he said, "What what
[2:01:07] happened to you?
[2:01:09] Where did you get those scars? What what
[2:01:13] what happened?" He goes, "I was in
[2:01:15] service for my Lord. service for my
[2:01:17] king.
[2:01:20] Caesar says, "You're the man. I want to
[2:01:22] ride with me." And brought him up there.
[2:01:24] And I thought, "That's right. That's
[2:01:26] what God's looking for. He's not looking
[2:01:29] for perfect people." And that got got it
[2:01:32] all lined out and all the ducks lined
[2:01:34] out in a row. He's just looking for
[2:01:37] people that are staying faithful,
[2:01:40] staying true to God and working,
[2:01:45] pressing,
[2:01:47] pushing, laboring for the kingdom of
[2:01:51] God.
[2:01:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:56] Sing it now with all your heart. All in
[2:02:02] Jesus
[2:02:03] name.
[2:02:05] We press on.
[2:02:12] Oh, in
[2:02:14] Jesus
[2:02:16] name
[2:02:17] we press on.
[2:02:24] Dear Lord,
[2:02:26] win the prize.
[2:02:31] Hallelujah.
[2:02:37] We find the strength
[2:02:42] to press on Lord.
[2:02:47] Oh,

[2:03:12] dear Lord
[2:03:15] with the bright
[2:03:19] clear

[2:03:32] we find the strength. Are you finding
[2:03:36] strength?
[2:03:38] We find the strength
[2:03:42] to press
[2:03:46] as they just continue to play.
[2:03:50] God bless you is our prayer.
[2:03:55] Soldiers of the cross.

[2:04:04] You are a people that God is qualified
[2:04:08] to endure to the end.

[2:04:18] May you stand strong in his grace.
[2:04:23] Amen.

[2:04:27] to make it today

[2:05:15] Brother John, do you want to dismiss in
[2:05:18] prayer?

[2:05:33] giving us the opportunity
