[39:29] so uh then my computer wouldn't work so
[39:33] anyways but so we're gonna we're just
[39:35] gonna talk about it for a few moments
[39:37] but now Jesus says come unto me all ye
[39:42] that labor and are heavy laden now
[39:45] I know that he he speaking for everyone
[39:49] out of all ages
[39:51] in in this uh I'm I'm sure but
[39:55] I think if there's ever a time that we
[39:58] could take this
[40:00] um
[40:01] take what he is saying in the invitation
[40:04] I believe it is now more than any other
[40:08] age
[40:10] there's another scripture that comes to
[40:12] mind and that is
[40:14] um where I believe it's found in Isaiah
[40:17] where God said look unto me all ye ends
[40:21] of the Earth
[40:22] and be saved and
[40:26] um and of course brother Branham applies
[40:28] that to this age
[40:31] that here we are we're at the ends of
[40:33] the Earth we're at the ends of
[40:36] everything End of Time democracy Nation
[40:40] Nations
[40:42] uh civilization as we know it to be
[40:46] everything is at its ends and not just
[40:52] the end but ends of the earth and uh and
[40:57] it would be at this time brother Brahm
[41:00] applied that to this time how we're at
[41:02] the ends but then the command is look
[41:04] unto me
[41:06] and so I look at that and I look at this
[41:09] scripture Jesus saying come unto me
[41:12] so it would be applicable for our age
[41:14] look
[41:16] in other words I'm here
[41:18] know where I'm at
[41:20] but your focus on me right and coming to
[41:25] me because we're going to need him
[41:28] you got to look unto him and be saved
[41:30] come unto me and find rest
[41:34] for your your your soul and Jesus said
[41:39] in another place I am the way the truth
[41:42] and the life
[41:43] and so look unto me when you're looking
[41:47] unto him you're looking at the way the
[41:50] truth and the life
[41:51] when you come and unto him you're coming
[41:53] unto the way you found the way when you
[41:56] come to him you found the way the truth
[41:59] and the life ain't that right and so
[42:02] well then we know that he is the word
[42:05] brother Brahm tells us that so many
[42:07] times and you ain't gonna find that in
[42:09] in in denominations or anything else but
[42:13] brother the prophet would tell us and
[42:15] identify him as being the word and he
[42:18] would take us through the scripture in
[42:19] the beginning was the word the word was
[42:21] with God the Word was God then the 14th
[42:24] verse John 1 14 and the word made was
[42:28] made flesh the word became flesh ain't
[42:32] that right so look look unto me come
[42:35] unto me all ye that are heavy laden
[42:38] don't come to a thought don't come to an
[42:41] idea don't come to a teaching but come
[42:44] unto me ain't that right now it's
[42:49] applicable for this age because
[42:52] uh this is the finale of everything
[42:57] it's and so so uh we're living in an age
[43:01] of unrest
[43:03] there's probably been unrest in every
[43:05] age no doubt but this is the greatest
[43:08] stage of unrest this is the age that no
[43:12] one has answers to
[43:14] they're they're trying to and and it's
[43:16] more than just a physical uh unrest it's
[43:20] a spiritual unrest the soul is weary
[43:25] and and
[43:27] uh you probably that work on jobs and
[43:31] you talk to people that are Christians
[43:33] even and and uh
[43:37] and yet they're they're the world is
[43:40] trying to find answers
[43:42] they're they're they're they're they're
[43:43] looking for answers to their questions
[43:49] and yet the Bible says ever learning
[43:52] this would be the age that people would
[43:55] be ever learning and never come to the
[43:59] knowledge of Truth
[44:02] now Jesus says I'm the way the truth and
[44:04] the life you got to come to me to find
[44:07] rest ain't that right but they're not
[44:10] able to come to the knowledge of Truth
[44:14] you've got people searching in all kinds
[44:17] of religions trying to find rest trying
[44:20] to find the answers trying to find the
[44:22] truth they they read we've got more
[44:25] literature out there than than ever
[44:28] before of of ideas and these things but
[44:33] you see if a man can find truth he can
[44:35] find Christ
[44:37] if he can see the truth
[44:39] then he can fulfill what the scripture
[44:41] says look unto me all ye uh ends of the
[44:46] Earth ain't that right for Christ is the
[44:49] truth now we don't accept anything to be
[44:51] truth
[44:52] that people can say it's truth but we
[44:55] don't accept anything as truth truth has
[44:58] to be Vindicated before it's accepted it
[45:02] has to be proven to be truth ain't that
[45:04] right now brother Graham talking of this
[45:06] uh Abel not able to come to the
[45:09] knowledge of Truth he says they aren't
[45:12] able to come to the knowledge of knowing
[45:15] Jesus Christ exists today in the power
[45:19] of his resurrection
[45:21] in in the Holy Ghost ain't that rhyme
[45:24] see so so they're not able to come to
[45:27] that knowledge that Jesus Christ exists
[45:30] in the power of his resurrection
[45:32] But but so much confusion today
[45:37] um
[45:37] and you know uh this this Babylon we we
[45:43] talk of Babylon the Bible talks of
[45:46] Babylon but it means confusion
[45:49] it's it's it's a it's just confusion and
[45:52] that's what we're looking at is is so
[45:55] much confusion which causes unrest
[45:59] confusion yeah because you don't have an
[46:02] absolute you don't find you don't have
[46:05] the answers to to the questions that you
[46:09] have and and and people's peoples
[46:12] wanting to know about their future
[46:14] people are wanting to know uh about the
[46:17] things that are going on and and nobody
[46:20] has the answers
[46:22] and we've got so much false teaching in
[46:25] the churches so much lies in the in
[46:29] politics and uh false doctrines Creeds
[46:34] and dogmas and and the media they're
[46:37] they're putting their spin on things and
[46:40] nobody knows what to believe if you you
[46:44] can't believe Fox News you can't believe
[46:46] CNN you you can't you can't believe you
[46:51] know and you have to say you can't
[46:52] believe Newsmax and and uh uh you can't
[46:57] believe Donald Trump and and you can't
[47:00] believe in Biden and you can't believe
[47:02] you just can't believe them you know you
[47:05] can't believe the government you know
[47:07] and then then it's gotten into the
[47:09] church that you can't you can't believe
[47:11] what's going on in the church it's what
[47:14] the denominations are preaching and and
[47:16] and their programs and there's things
[47:19] and and people are in a tell spin today
[47:22] of trying to find the truth
[47:25] but yeah can you imagine just being in a
[47:28] state like that where you don't know
[47:30] what truth is you go to church and you
[47:33] don't know if it's really the truth or
[47:34] not so people are left to their own
[47:37] opinions their own ideologies and how
[47:40] many people are going into that and yet
[47:42] you can't believe that either you know
[47:45] it's just it's a constant thing no one
[47:48] knows what to believe today and and and
[47:51] it's because of the babylon's Babylonian
[47:54] system you know John uh talked about it
[47:58] there in Revelations about mystery
[48:00] Babylon mystery and and again Babylon is
[48:03] confusion and and and he talks about
[48:06] that that the kings of the Earth have
[48:10] committed fornication with her the Great
[48:12] Men the powerful men have have committed
[48:15] uh a fornication and all the people of
[48:18] the Earth have drunk of the wine of her
[48:21] fornication and and so uh uh well again
[48:27] Babylon is confusion but it's a mystery
[48:30] uh because Babylon you know you read it
[48:33] of it in the Old Testament and and and
[48:36] and uh uh there there was a place called
[48:40] Babylon uh Nimrod and and such and and
[48:45] so we all know about that and the
[48:46] history of of them things but this is a
[48:49] mystery babbling it's it's not per se a
[48:52] a s uh country or whatever but John saw
[48:56] her as a church
[48:57] it's it's it's a it's it's a it's in and
[49:02] it's and it's it's a place that is
[49:04] spewing out confusion and the people of
[49:08] the Earth are drinking of it
[49:10] and and they've drunk of the wine of her
[49:13] fornication they've committed
[49:14] fornication with her and and fornication
[49:17] is is an act of adultery it's it's a
[49:20] person that claims to uh uh well you
[49:24] know I I don't have a Verbatim but uh a
[49:28] person to be in love claiming to uh uh
[49:32] to to to be married to this to to an
[49:35] individual and then they're going out
[49:37] and committing uh adultery and and all
[49:40] of these things well this woman claiming
[49:43] to be a church claiming to be of Christ
[49:45] and yet she's she's totally against
[49:48] Christ and her teachings are against the
[49:51] word or her her ideologies her
[49:54] traditions and all of that is is against
[49:57] it's against the word of God and it
[50:00] started out in in the first church age
[50:02] ain't that right and she's been spewing
[50:05] out her doctrines in the confusion
[50:07] through all the ages to where in this
[50:10] age we're left with a generation that
[50:13] does not know what to believe
[50:17] and it's a mess ain't that right and and
[50:21] and so uh and and so they're led to
[50:24] their own advice as they they're left
[50:26] without the answers and and it reminds
[50:29] me of Daniel and and if you would like
[50:32] to just turn with me Daniel 5 and 1. uh
[50:37] and like I say we won't keep you long
[50:40] but
[50:41] um
[50:48] if I can find it myself
[50:51] will be in good shape
[50:53] praise the Lord Daniel found it Daniel 5
[50:57] and 1.
[50:59] um
[51:00] it's going to be a little lengthy but
[51:02] um
[51:03] we'll read it anyways belshazzar the
[51:07] king made a great feast to a thousand of
[51:10] his Lords and drink wine before the
[51:12] Thousand
[51:13] belshazzar while he tasted the wine
[51:16] commanded to bring the golden and silver
[51:19] vessels which is Father Nebuchadnezzar
[51:22] had taken out of the temple which was in
[51:24] Jerusalem so now he's using the things
[51:27] consecrated to God unto for his Gods
[51:30] ain't that the way it is today that's
[51:33] why brother Brandon was against these
[51:35] singers that would sing gospel music and
[51:37] then go out and sing country music and
[51:39] all that it's it's perverse it's of the
[51:42] devil and this is what this vile Heathen
[51:45] King done he took the things that were
[51:47] made to be for God and then he would use
[51:50] it for his gods and and all of that see
[51:53] well and it made God upset right and and
[51:57] so see and that the king and his princes
[52:01] his wives his concubines might drink
[52:03] there in them they brought the golden
[52:06] vessels that were taken out of the
[52:08] Temple of the house of God which was at
[52:10] Jerusalem and the King and his princes
[52:13] his wives and his concubines Drank in
[52:15] them see things that were consecrated
[52:18] unto God supposed to be consecrated to
[52:21] God now he's using them for the world
[52:23] ain't that right
[52:25] now just to say this you either got to
[52:29] be consecrated to God and nothing else
[52:31] but to try to be used for God and use of
[52:34] the world is is wrong it ain't going to
[52:36] work ain't that right and and and that
[52:40] that's why you know women ain't to wear
[52:42] their pants women ain't to wear and cut
[52:45] their hair and wear their makeup that's
[52:46] Heathen that's of the devil
[52:50] well now we've got it to where women
[52:52] claiming to be God and singing of God
[52:54] and they're wearing pants it's it's
[52:56] almost the same thing the vessels that
[52:59] are supposed to be consecrated to God
[53:00] Satan's controlling them as well Satan's
[53:04] using them for his glory
[53:06] it's sad when when when women are
[53:09] supposed to be a Holy Ghost Field
[53:11] claiming and they're sex Queens for the
[53:13] devil leading many to hell
[53:16] and that's even in the apostolic Rim
[53:18] where they're wearing their tight
[53:20] clothes
[53:21] and and all of that and they're Leading
[53:23] Men to hell they're used of the devil
[53:26] ain't that right so so there's so many
[53:29] things that we could take today uh uh
[53:32] that was likened unto this day uh that
[53:35] that's going on but he's using the
[53:37] things that uh that God had required for
[53:40] himself and and now that Heathen King is
[53:44] using it for his so then they brought
[53:47] the golden vessels that were taken out
[53:49] of the Temple of the house of God which
[53:51] was at Jerusalem and the king and the
[53:53] princes his wives and his concubines
[53:55] Drank in them they drank wine and
[53:57] praised the gods of gold and of silver
[54:00] of brass of iron of wood and of stone
[54:03] ain't that right it's kind of like I've
[54:05] said you know now I I you know uh I I
[54:09] know that that you know when we come
[54:11] into the message we found out that
[54:13] there's some instruments that the
[54:15] message folks didn't believe in and and
[54:17] and and I thought well why is that you
[54:19] know I mean it's just it's just a piano
[54:21] it's just a drum set it's just the organ
[54:24] it's just what did it do wrong you know
[54:26] oh uh uh but but it it's the it's it's
[54:31] not the music that's the problem it's
[54:35] the people that's the problem
[54:37] right I have nothing against the piano I
[54:40] mean he's got anything against the piano
[54:41] you got anything from his piano well
[54:43] what if we had Jerry Lee Lewis come in
[54:45] and play that piano
[54:47] now who what's what's wrong with it is
[54:50] it the piano that backslid or is it the
[54:51] guy
[54:54] all right see so so there's instruments
[54:57] that are to be used of God that the
[55:00] devil has perverted
[55:02] ain't that right it's the devil that
[55:04] does them things
[55:06] it's true you can you can you can a
[55:09] guitar playing a guitar playing music
[55:11] can drive Spirits away
[55:13] and them same guitars and the same music
[55:17] can entertain spirits and bring spirits
[55:20] and excite spirits and call spirits to
[55:22] do things ain't that right it all
[55:25] depends who's playing it
[55:28] so so they drank wine and praised the
[55:31] gods you using the vessels of the temple
[55:35] and drinking wine out of it and yet
[55:38] praising gods of gold and the silver and
[55:41] Brass of iron of wood and a stone in the
[55:45] same hour came forth fingers of a man's
[55:48] hand wrote over against the Candlestick
[55:50] upon the plaster of the wall of the
[55:54] king's Palace and the King saw the part
[55:56] of the hand that wrote then the king's
[55:59] countenance was changed and his thoughts
[56:02] troubled him so that the jaunts of his
[56:05] Lawns were loose and his knees smote one
[56:08] against another the king cried aloud to
[56:11] bring in the astrologers in the
[56:14] Chaldeans and uh the soothsayers and the
[56:17] King spake and said to the wise men of
[56:21] Babylon who shall so ever shall read
[56:23] this writing show me uh the
[56:26] interpretation thereof shall be clothed
[56:28] with scarlet and have a chain about of
[56:31] gold about his neck and shall be the
[56:33] third ruler in the Kingdom
[56:35] so much for that then came in all the
[56:39] king's wise men but they could not read
[56:42] the writing nor make known to the king
[56:47] the interpretation thereof
[56:49] then was King belshazzar greatly
[56:53] troubled
[56:54] and his countenance was changed in him
[56:57] his Lords were and his Lords were
[57:00] astonied now the Queen by reason of the
[57:03] words of the king and his Lords came
[57:05] into the banquet house and the queen
[57:07] spake and said O King live forever let
[57:10] not thy Hearts thoughts uh trouble thee
[57:13] nor let thy countenance be changed there
[57:16] is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the
[57:20] spirit of the Holy gods and in the days
[57:23] of thy father light and understanding
[57:26] and wisdom like the wisdom of the Gods
[57:29] was found in him whom the King
[57:31] Nebuchadnezzar thy father the king I say
[57:34] thy father made Master of the musicians
[57:37] astrologers Chaldeans and soothsayers
[57:40] for so much as an excellent spirit and
[57:43] knowledge understanding interpreting of
[57:47] dreams and showing of hard sentences and
[57:50] dissolving of doubts were found in the
[57:53] same Daniel
[57:54] whom the king name built shazar now let
[57:57] Daniel be called and he will show Thee
[58:00] the interpretation
[58:02] ain't that right then was Daniel brought
[58:05] in before the king and the King spake
[58:07] and said unto Daniel art thou that
[58:10] Daniel which art of the children of the
[58:13] Captivity of Judah whom the king my
[58:15] father brought out of jury
[58:17] I have heard of thee and the spirit of
[58:20] the Gods is in thee and that light and
[58:23] understanding and excellent wisdom is
[58:25] found in thee now the wise men and in
[58:29] the astrologers have been brought in
[58:32] before me that they should read this
[58:34] writing and make known unto me the
[58:36] interpretation thereof but they could
[58:39] not show the interpretation of the thing
[58:41] and I have heard of thee that thou canst
[58:44] make interpretations and dissolved
[58:47] doubts now if thou can is read the
[58:50] writing and make known to me the
[58:53] interpretation thereof Thou shalt be
[58:55] clothed with scarlet and have a chain of
[58:57] gold about thy neck and thou shalt be
[58:59] the third ruler in the Kingdom now that
[59:02] that's a that that was a problem but
[59:05] they could not understand the writing
[59:07] they couldn't understand the
[59:08] interpretation
[59:09] now we're living in that same day
[59:12] we got trouble in the land and God's
[59:16] Wrath is being poured out
[59:18] God's upset
[59:19] I mean Church uh
[59:24] I don't know but uh I don't want to be
[59:27] here when God's Wrath is poured out
[59:29] but the sins of man
[59:32] have reached God
[59:35] we've talked about how that brother Bram
[59:37] talks about these UFOs and all that
[59:39] being investing aiding angels to look on
[59:42] the sin
[59:43] that has been committed in this in this
[59:46] time ain't that right and so we we look
[59:50] but Daniel was a prophet
[59:53] that could give a true interpretation of
[59:58] of what was happening ain't that right
[1:00:01] now I've thought of that a man that
[1:00:04] could dissolve all doubts
[1:00:07] right in the middle of of babylon's
[1:00:10] system
[1:00:11] and he could read and dissolve the
[1:00:14] doubts and read the true interpretation
[1:00:16] of what was happening now I've I've
[1:00:19] looked and in this day we've we've had a
[1:00:23] voice crying out we've heard it
[1:00:26] uh uh come out of her my people
[1:00:29] ain't that right come out of her
[1:00:31] if if there's ever a Time church for the
[1:00:35] people of God to come out of the
[1:00:37] confusion
[1:00:38] it's this age
[1:00:40] God has provided a way to where our
[1:00:45] hearts not be troubled our thoughts not
[1:00:48] be troubled everything that is going on
[1:00:51] in the Nations and the world it not
[1:00:54] trouble us
[1:00:55] ain't that right come out of her my
[1:00:58] people and it's at this time that this
[1:01:00] voice Cries Out is the time that God
[1:01:04] sins unto us the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:01:09] why because the word comes to the
[1:01:11] prophet ain't that right and the prophet
[1:01:15] as the prophet said the prophet has the
[1:01:18] true correct interpretation
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:21] of the word of God ain't that right now
[1:01:24] we've read about it we've seen it uh
[1:01:26] talked about it uh of the Bible speaks
[1:01:29] there in Revelations 10 and and seven of
[1:01:33] of about the voice of the seventh angel
[1:01:36] when he shall begin to sound the
[1:01:39] mysteries of God should be finished
[1:01:42] now you think of that the Mysteries all
[1:01:46] this confusion
[1:01:48] should be over
[1:01:50] for who those that have come out of
[1:01:52] Babylon
[1:01:54] ain't that right there is peace for the
[1:01:58] soul of man there is rest for the soul
[1:02:02] of man ain't that rhyme
[1:02:05] so the prophet is the one that has the
[1:02:07] truth people say well you've got to get
[1:02:10] get them to Christ before the message
[1:02:11] you you're missing the point Christ is
[1:02:14] the message
[1:02:15] Christ is the way the truth and the life
[1:02:19] Christ is the word ain't that right and
[1:02:21] the word comes to the prophets
[1:02:24] ain't that right the message is Christ
[1:02:26] it's a living being if you can believe
[1:02:30] it
[1:02:32] but you got to believe it
[1:02:35] ain't that right
[1:02:37] you got to believe it
[1:02:39] now we're blessed in in the fact that
[1:02:42] that God has sent us a message
[1:02:45] and if I can just encourage you once
[1:02:49] again
[1:02:51] is don't let nothing stand between you
[1:02:55] and the message of the hour
[1:02:59] don't don't let what is going on stand
[1:03:03] between you and the message
[1:03:05] don't let people's ideology stand
[1:03:08] between you and the message
[1:03:10] ain't that right
[1:03:12] people you know the the the the they
[1:03:14] knock this message and he's still
[1:03:16] claiming to be in the message
[1:03:18] but they got their ideas of what's truth
[1:03:21] and what's not
[1:03:22] and they want to pick this message apart
[1:03:24] well this is Brother branham's opinion
[1:03:26] and this is what he's saying here and
[1:03:28] and it don't mean much and it doesn't
[1:03:30] mean this it means everything to us
[1:03:33] you can never come out of Babylon if you
[1:03:36] don't come out of confusion
[1:03:39] you've got to come out of confusion and
[1:03:41] and if you don't come out of confusion
[1:03:43] you'll never find rest until your soul
[1:03:48] ain't that right Christ has revealed
[1:03:51] himself by way of the prophet
[1:03:55] ain't that right Christ is the one that
[1:03:57] has the answers and I'll be honest with
[1:03:59] you it's the holy ghost that has is the
[1:04:02] prophet of the age
[1:04:04] do you believe that the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:06] the prophet of the age so when you're
[1:04:09] knocking down uh the message of the hour
[1:04:11] you're criticizing the Holy Ghost
[1:04:15] and it's true now listen the
[1:04:18] handwritings on the wall
[1:04:20] that God had given us a prophet to let
[1:04:23] us know what's going on he let us know
[1:04:26] why these events are taking place
[1:04:28] and it's not to bring confusion it's for
[1:04:31] you to find rest it's for me to find
[1:04:34] rest as a preacher to my soul that when
[1:04:37] I come and I stand before you I can
[1:04:39] preach the truth to you
[1:04:42] and when you preach the message to your
[1:04:44] children you're teaching them the truth
[1:04:46] of it
[1:04:48] ain't that right you find rest
[1:04:52] amen and all those that have come out of
[1:04:55] Babylon by way of this message
[1:04:58] that's found rest to their soul
[1:05:01] and if you ain't found rest it ain't the
[1:05:03] message fault it ain't God's fault
[1:05:05] it's because we're not taking the
[1:05:07] message for what it says
[1:05:10] can you say Amen
[1:05:11] yes sir we got them all look at the
[1:05:15] confusion that's going on I mean Jesus
[1:05:18] thought the Jesus said when you see
[1:05:20] these things begin to happen lift your
[1:05:22] head up
[1:05:24] lift your head up your Redemption
[1:05:26] draweth nigh and we got these false
[1:05:29] soothsayers and astrologers and well
[1:05:31] what whatever you want to call it false
[1:05:33] prophets today and and all of that and
[1:05:35] and and they're they're saying Revival
[1:05:37] to America restoration of America is
[1:05:40] coming it's not coming
[1:05:43] will happen
[1:05:45] you can't identify yourself as an
[1:05:47] American
[1:05:49] I just be honest I love this nation I'm
[1:05:51] glad I'm an American but I can't afford
[1:05:53] to identify myself as an American
[1:05:58] there ain't no hope for us as an
[1:06:00] American but there is hope in Christ
[1:06:04] there is hope in Christ
[1:06:07] find rest for your weary Souls
[1:06:10] then you say Amen
[1:06:12] think of that people looking and
[1:06:14] searching all over
[1:06:17] and we've been delivered
[1:06:21] from the ideology of men
[1:06:26] things that have held men back and still
[1:06:28] hold men back
[1:06:30] doctrines and teachings traditions and
[1:06:35] dogmas and all that you realize how
[1:06:37] powerful them things are
[1:06:39] because it's a power of Darkness
[1:06:44] ain't that right
[1:06:45] it holds you back to where you can't
[1:06:48] just find true Liberty as a son and
[1:06:51] daughter of God
[1:06:55] you don't look to the world for answers
[1:06:58] don't look for the world for answers
[1:07:02] can you say amen and I'm not trying to
[1:07:03] be critical or mean
[1:07:05] but I am telling you there is the
[1:07:07] answers
[1:07:09] come unto me
[1:07:11] that's what Jesus said come unto me
[1:07:14] and he's not a theory
[1:07:17] he's not a Doctrine
[1:07:19] he's not an idea
[1:07:21] he's not a just a myth
[1:07:24] it's a living being
[1:07:26] Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ
[1:07:29] is here today
[1:07:31] do you believe that and God is in his
[1:07:34] word vindicating his word with
[1:07:37] Supernatural signs and this message has
[1:07:40] been certainly Vindicated that it should
[1:07:43] take all questions and I say to you it
[1:07:45] is our absolute
[1:07:47] it is our absolute why it's the true
[1:07:49] true uh interpretation and now we have
[1:07:54] the answers to the devil's questions
[1:07:57] we have the answers
[1:07:59] and our soul is at rest
[1:08:02] our soul is at rest
[1:08:04] the answers to marriage it's the answers
[1:08:08] to home life
[1:08:09] is the answers to the church it's the
[1:08:12] answers to our ministers
[1:08:13] the answers for children for parents
[1:08:16] it's the answers for musicians it's the
[1:08:19] answers for employers and employees it's
[1:08:22] it's the answers every answer that you
[1:08:26] need or question that you have the
[1:08:28] answers in the message and you know what
[1:08:30] the message is it points us right back
[1:08:32] to the word
[1:08:33] it makes this word live it this Bible
[1:08:36] become a new book to all of us or it
[1:08:39] should can you say Amen because we've
[1:08:42] read this Bible we've understood that
[1:08:44] the Bible through theories of men the
[1:08:46] ideas and doctrines and and ideologies
[1:08:49] of men and and we thought we had the
[1:08:52] answers but it verified we didn't have
[1:08:54] the answer because we couldn't find rest
[1:08:56] in our souls
[1:09:00] but when we found the answer
[1:09:03] a prophet would take us to True
[1:09:05] interpretations of the word
[1:09:07] can you say man and the prophet is not a
[1:09:11] he wasn't a commentary
[1:09:13] to to take scripture by scripture
[1:09:15] scripture by scripture that wasn't it
[1:09:18] but he had the spirit of Truth
[1:09:21] and you say man
[1:09:22] and he would take it and he would he
[1:09:25] would expound on it and then we would
[1:09:27] have the spirit of Truth to allow us to
[1:09:31] read between the lines of what is really
[1:09:34] being said
[1:09:37] can you say Amen
[1:09:39] so so we we can't make this this this
[1:09:43] this this message a a uh like a a
[1:09:48] seminary
[1:09:50] to where we just tried to break it down
[1:09:52] in in so many ways
[1:09:54] it takes the spirit of God in the
[1:09:57] individual
[1:09:59] to open it up to us
[1:10:04] and you say Amen
[1:10:06] because not everybody in the message not
[1:10:08] everybody that says God sent a prophet
[1:10:09] is going to have rest for the soul
[1:10:12] ain't that right
[1:10:14] but the voice the spirit of the Prophet
[1:10:16] is in the bride
[1:10:18] the spirit of the Prophet is in the
[1:10:20] bride and it's revealing to her and you
[1:10:23] say Amen you think of it this this these
[1:10:26] messages are an eternal message
[1:10:28] how many times have we listened to you
[1:10:31] know Christ is the mystery of God
[1:10:33] revealed you can't just listen to it one
[1:10:35] time and get it all out
[1:10:38] I mean it's an eternal word
[1:10:41] the the the the godhead misunderstood or
[1:10:44] God being misunderstood and and and all
[1:10:47] of these these messages you can go back
[1:10:50] and listen and listen over and over and
[1:10:52] over and the spirit of God within you is
[1:10:55] breaking it down to you
[1:10:59] why you're finding rest for your soul
[1:11:03] because God's word can never fail
[1:11:06] you believe that
[1:11:07] Jesus said heavens and earth will pass
[1:11:10] away but my word shall never pass away
[1:11:13] but the word's been hid because of the
[1:11:15] the the interpretations of man the ideas
[1:11:18] of man and and and no wonder people
[1:11:21] don't get results the way they need it
[1:11:23] and the way they should but a prophet
[1:11:25] got results
[1:11:26] then you say man why because he had the
[1:11:29] true interpretation of the word
[1:11:31] and so is this message or this bride
[1:11:34] getting true results
[1:11:36] because they've got the true
[1:11:37] interpretation
[1:11:39] our soul has found rest
[1:11:43] amen you love the Lord
[1:11:45] any wonderful
[1:11:47] I I just can't thank God enough for
[1:11:50] sending the message our way
[1:11:53] and I I I say to you you know with the
[1:11:57] the best I I know to say it to you is
[1:12:01] stay with the word stay with the message
[1:12:03] get into it I you know I've I've said it
[1:12:07] so many times and I say it again you
[1:12:10] know if there's anyone you need to be
[1:12:11] listening to
[1:12:13] it's the message
[1:12:15] people's getting so wrapped up in this
[1:12:17] internet and and social media listen to
[1:12:20] this preacher listen to that preacher
[1:12:22] listen to this preacher listen to this
[1:12:23] preacher no wonder they're empty in
[1:12:25] their soul trying to find something to
[1:12:28] satisfy
[1:12:30] it's in the message
[1:12:32] find it in the message can you say Amen
[1:12:34] get into the message play them tapes at
[1:12:37] home
[1:12:39] the handwritings on the wall but there's
[1:12:40] someone that can tell you what it is
[1:12:42] about
[1:12:43] politics are going crazy but there's
[1:12:45] someone that can tell you what it's
[1:12:46] about all these inventions and
[1:12:49] everything that's going on and the chaos
[1:12:51] and the craziness there's somebody that
[1:12:53] has the answer can you say man there's
[1:12:55] no point in running to and fro anymore
[1:12:57] people the Bible says people will run to
[1:13:00] and fro amen trying to find the
[1:13:02] knowledge trying to find true truth is
[1:13:04] falling in the streets but there's a
[1:13:06] bride that's holding on that truth she's
[1:13:08] possessed the truth she's holding on to
[1:13:10] it she ain't gonna let it go then you
[1:13:13] say Amen
[1:13:14] stay with the message
[1:13:17] amen I love the Lord do you love him if
[1:13:20] the musicians will come
[1:13:30] I find you
[1:13:33] you just believe the message you stay
[1:13:35] with that message
[1:13:37] you listen to the message
[1:13:41] the more in love you become with Christ
[1:13:42] the more established you become in
[1:13:44] Christ
[1:13:45] the more solid the it that Christ
[1:13:48] becomes to you and you become with
[1:13:51] Christ
[1:13:53] it's it's it's something that because
[1:13:55] it's it's so true
[1:13:57] you will find rest for your soul
[1:14:01] you say well the Holy Ghost is red and I
[1:14:03] agree with that I I certainly agree to
[1:14:06] that
[1:14:07] and we're not doing away with that at
[1:14:09] all
[1:14:10] but here's the thing
[1:14:13] you believe this message
[1:14:16] with all of your heart and you stay with
[1:14:18] that message if you need the Holy Ghost
[1:14:21] you'll get the Holy Ghost
[1:14:24] hello
[1:14:27] you why because the Holy Ghost backs
[1:14:29] this message up
[1:14:32] it backs it up whatever you have need of
[1:14:35] you stay with the message
[1:14:38] stay straight stay true
[1:14:41] listen to it fill your heart and your
[1:14:43] mind fill your mouth with it
[1:14:45] confess it
[1:14:46] why because it's nothing but promises to
[1:14:49] you it's the promises of God
[1:14:51] ain't that right it's something that
[1:14:53] will not fail
[1:14:54] brother Brown even said he'll go to his
[1:14:57] judgment I mean you'll go to judgment
[1:14:59] with it with what he's preached he's
[1:15:01] going to be judged with what he's
[1:15:02] preached and what did everybody else say
[1:15:04] up there beyond the curtain of time
[1:15:05] we're resting on that he said I preached
[1:15:07] what Paul preached and they're saying
[1:15:09] we're resting on that they're they're
[1:15:11] there in heaven they're there where
[1:15:14] they're at resting on a water Prophet
[1:15:16] preached
[1:15:18] then you say man and apparently God's
[1:15:21] honored what that Prophet preached
[1:15:22] because they're they're there
[1:15:24] they've made it on the other side and
[1:15:26] they're resting on the words of that
[1:15:28] Prophet now can we not rest upon them
[1:15:30] same words of what a prophet preached
[1:15:34] they're arresting it up on there we're
[1:15:37] resting it up on it down here and we're
[1:15:39] resting not Upon A man we're resting
[1:15:41] upon the thus saith the Lord that has
[1:15:44] been totally Vindicated and that's how
[1:15:46] we know it's thus saith the Lord It's
[1:15:48] been proven to be thus saith the Lord
[1:15:52] not listening to uncertain sounds

[1:16:02] uncertain sound
[1:16:04] and as brother Brown's talking about it

[1:33:22] inner body and
[1:33:24] we want to just keep her and upholder in
[1:33:28] prayer
[1:33:29] I believe the power of prayer works
[1:33:32] and also with Sam had let me know that
[1:33:35] Sarah Prater had had uh
[1:33:40] breast cancer I guess and had both
[1:33:42] removed is that was that
[1:33:47] oh is that Jason okay I thought that was
[1:33:49] Sarah Prater all that time
[1:33:51] and so we want to keep her in prayer
[1:33:55] keep this young lady what's her name
[1:33:58] Linda and this is your daughter-in-law
[1:34:01] actually yes brother Bill's
[1:34:03] daughter-in-law
[1:34:05] Okay I uh I need to um
[1:34:09] contact Jason I've been in contact with
[1:34:12] him and
[1:34:14] chatting with him a little bit and so
[1:34:17] but we want to keep keep this situation
[1:34:21] in our prayer
[1:34:23] and we want to keep Jason Bradberry in
[1:34:26] our prayer too I uh you know I
[1:34:31] some reason I I like him a lot and just
[1:34:35] a good guy and uh no maybe he's gone
[1:34:39] through a lot in his life
[1:34:42] I don't believe a man can go so far
[1:34:47] sin or whatever in his life and be too
[1:34:50] scarred up that God can't heal him
[1:34:53] it makes something out of him and
[1:34:56] we want to just keep that situation in
[1:34:58] our prayer but keep his wife in prayer
[1:35:01] their Lord will just help her to recover
