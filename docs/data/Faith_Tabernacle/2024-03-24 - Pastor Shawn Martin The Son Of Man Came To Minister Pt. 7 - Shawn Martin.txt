Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Matthew the 20th chapter amen and uh Easter be next Sunday and uh so we'll be just having one service then and um and so uh but looking forward to the the service there and also um we've said it before but uh April 7th we will be setting up the tent and uh so any of you brothers that would like to be a part of that and help we would appreciate that and uh but most of all we ask that you pray for the meeting and um this could be our last time that we gather uh like this and uh but my my prayer has always been that God would just meet us in a in a special way that people can be touched and blessed and that they could uh their hearts would be solidified around the message of the hour and um I believe that the the brothers that uh are ministering they they love the message and um I've always felt that when the meetings were over that the message was clearly preached and um that the people would know uh be more encouraged amen uh uh uh to to get closer to God and to get more into the message and brother brandham he he says this uh uh brother Andrew had sent it to me this morning but and I thought it was good he says I'll say tonight that a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost tent meeting is more to protect us than all the atomic bombs that we could create in a million years and I thought wow oh God let it be a holy ghost meeting amen and that's really what we want want there's a lot of effort that goes into this meeting but more than anything we want our efforts to be in prayer and and praying and and everything that God would feel at home and feel welcome to move Among Us amen but Matthew the uh 20th chapter we've been reading this um as our opening scripture for a few Sundays but uh Matthew 20 and 20 we're going to just start there then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what Willl thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left and in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he saith unto them you shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the 10 heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren but Jesus called unto them unto him and uh said you know that the uh princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the Son of Man Came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen then if you could turn with me to First Timothy the 4th chapter amen 1 Timothy the 4th chapter and um we'll read the the 12th verse let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers yes in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in Purity till I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee amen let's just bow our heads in prayer Lord Jesus we have gathered together this morning with the desire Lord to meet with you father to worship you and we believe that the songs have been done from the Heart Lord said and sung and the music played From The Heart Lord I pray father that you find it pleasing to you Lord and that you would feel welcome now to come and feel at home that you would Minister to us now through the word I pray that you would anoint both the speaker and the hearer help me just to get myself out of the way father Lord that when we leave this place we'd know that we' been with you father let it more be more than just words that are said but let the anointing come and father that you would manifest yourself in the Supernatural realm oh God that's our desire draw us closer to you may the sick be healed today those that are in needy and and discouraged or whatever it would be father may they find what they're asking and needing father we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen you can have your seats this morning and I want to continue with the thought the son of man came to minister and um but why why is Ministry important because we find that Ministry is is for us uh as well not just for him uh when he walk the earth but also for us and I guess the the simple and quick answer would be for the Lost Souls of man he come to minister uh Luke 19 and10 it says the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost so that was his purpose he come to redeem he come to save he come to deliver he come to heal he come to you know um so so uh the prophet uh comes and he and he puts a value upon the soul of a man and he says that one soul is worth 10,000 worlds you see it's it's it's because that God is interested in man he's interested in the soul of man so brother brandom says when you're born into that kingdom of God then the life the very life that was in Jesus see that's what it means to be born into the kingdom of God you have the very life that was in Christ he says then you're interested in Souls you're interested amen it's more than just interested in their their bank account and making sure that they're they have it set in life and and that they have materialistic things but you're interested in their soul and and so uh you know it's it's the people that are truly born again that you don't have to beg uh uh though the to come uh to the altar to help those uh that are in need to to pray through there there's just something brother Braham said these things just automatically flow amen it just automatically Wells up within you he said because it's it's be because it's sealed up in you you are a unit of God you are sealed with the Holy Ghost so I I I think that's that's uh uh you are a unit with God you are one with God you there's something that now his life is in you his passion is in you his goals his purpose is in you uh whatever he was whatever he started out here we are today and he's finishing up his work in US amen see and so we look in the ministry as he came to minister it was when he was here on Earth that Jesus when went out of his way uh uh to go to to one man and that was the man that was in gatera and he says he went over to gatera to help a maniac over there that was bound in the tombs crossed over a stormy sea to help one man in trouble because one Soul was calling for him amen One Soul was calling for him and he said it was his love for one needy soul 180 Soul amen and so then if he is the same yesterday today and forever which this scripture Hebrews 138 has been so solidified in our hearts amen uh uh through the message of the hour that he is the same yesterday to today and forever he can still heal he can still save he can he can still deliver he can still uh uh raise the dead he can still open the blinded eyes but all of that and we believe that that but he's still the same in his passion he's still the same in his love he's still the same in his desire he's still willing to go a man uh beyond the reaches of of humanity to save one's Soul he's still willing to go out of his way to reach that one Soul it's because his love not our love his love is for that one needy Soul ain't that right so if he is the same yesterday today and forever the prophet said then will come out of Glory today with his power to help one single person of this Earth amen if he sent the prophet amen if it was just for one Soul he would still send a prophet he would still open the seals he would still do everything he can for that one Soul ain't that right amen see he would come from Glory this afternoon to set any of you free that's right he will come down through every church and every critic and everything else and every fanatic and everything else to you to heal you this afternoon to make you right ain't that right I thought of brother brandham and and such the ministry that he had and and and and we all know that it was the ministry of Jesus Christ but you cannot have the ministry of Jesus Christ without having the Divine love that Jesus Christ had and the passion that Jesus Christ had and and so here he was he says I wouldn't be any more sincere with 5 thou 500,000 that I would be with five people because one soul is value to God as 10,000 worlds and this is why brother brandham could hold house meetings and he didn't make it a criteria that there had to be so many people before he would come to a to to a town he he didn't make it a criteria that he had to have so much money a certain amount of money in order for him to come amen because he had the same pass that Jesus had and whether it was to one soul out in the woods or whether it was to a 100,000 people and in a Coliseum it it didn't matter to him one Soul was worth 10,000 worlds he said wherever the Lord sends the church never gets too little whatever it is but what wherever there's a needy soul I want to lead it if it's just one soul to the Lord Jesus I think sometimes we get our dreams too big the ministers can be the same way that if we're not operating full-time in the ministry if we're not if we're not preaching to Big crowds and if we're not this or that or whatever and we set our own criteria for how our ministry can work amen but that's not the way it should be we should be willing to get out on the streets we should be willing to talk to people on the at a restaurant or or or or wherever if if to tell people about god brother Ram said you Housewives he said you don't have to be a preacher you do something for the glory of God remember Eternal things is what lasts forever and that's getting so saved let that be the first thing of all your work all your ideas and all your motives can you say Amen you say well I I I just wished I could go out and do other things I wished I could be whatever I thought about even sister MAA and how that you know brother brandom hung around a lot of ministers and and their wives always wanted to be with them and and in the in the Limelight or or whatever but sister ma wasn't in the Limelight and it looked like she wasn't doing much at all but you know brother Brandon says that every time she ironed my clothes she's praying for praying praying uh uh for my meetings and and and you know Sister Rebecca um uh uh asked her one time said mom says you know I wish I could said I I wish I could love to do ironing and stuff the way you you do say you just must love it and she said no I hate it and and and these things and but she said you know she says uh I I felt like I wasn't really doing much and this is all paraphrasing but she I just felt like I wasn't doing much and and these things that didn't it just come to me you know that I could be praying every time I iron them clothes uh uh I I could be praying I could be praying for my husband I could be praying for my children I could be you understand what I'm saying so see she began a Ministry she realized that she had a Ministry amen it wasn't maybe to preach like her husband and and stand before the thousands and to have recognition as he did but she realized that she did have a place in this and brother Brandon recognized it as well can you say Amen you see a lost soul is the only thing that has value in it money passes away houses pass away lands uh everything changes and you know good and well everything that you've worked for the government can take it just away from you and we'll take it away from you and and and and they they don't care as as we know but you see but homes will even Decay cars will even Decay everything's going to Decay everything's going to change and and one of these days we're all going to have to give up the ghost ain't that right if we live long enough right and and so uh uh but everything in this Earth moves away amen but brother Bram says I'd rather have one so in glory that I want to Christ to know and see that that light of God circles around that Soul through all eternity my name to be associated with that than to have every penny of money in the whole earth cuz I lose all of that I I'd have to lose it all see but what you send up there is eternal are you with me Church what what so you send there is eternal see and that's the reason we're trying amen that's the reason brother Brandon would press past the tiredness and the discouragements and the and the rejection and knowing that the the ministers behind him didn't agree with him and knowing half the most of the the people that was out there amen was was uh didn't understand his ministry but he kept trying amen he never stopped and I say Church don't quit trying ministers don't quit trying parents don't quit trying whatever your ministry is don't quit trying amen we must not brother brand said we should pray to God to give us a passion for lost souls till Jesus comes can you say amen amen he says anybody will donate to a healing service they'll donate to a song festival but when it comes to a poor lost soul they ain't got nothing to do with that on see now isn't that about right he says got everything see to a a poor lost soul don't want nothing to do with that they'll let him grow out into anything and they'll say well that's all right he belongs to church it won't hurt anything do you see why we're not just satisfied with taking people to church we're not just satisfied amen tell them well you can go to the church down here and you can go when we know good and well that they're going to send they ain't going you know I mean come on now most churches around here ain't got the uh denominations or whatever in the world ain't got what it takes to get people in a Rapture yeah that's right it's just the truth see so so we as as Believers amen we are to be about the father's business and the prophet said his business is saving lost souls can you say that with me his business is saving lost souls and we are to be about the father's business now that's adoption now we're we're talking about adoption now we're not talking about little little children just running around doing everything we're not talking about that son a man that is trying to be tutored and yet he's not interested in the father's business he's not interested in what the tutor has to say we're talking about Sons and Daughters of God that has come to adoption because they're they're they're they're interested in the father's business can you say Amen now why is the soul of man valuable you know surely there is a point in getting so saved and and you know uh uh brother Bram said the most important thing in the world is God's church God made the Earth he made it for a purpose why to take a church out of it can you say man a bride and that's the most important job in the world can you say amen amen see now as I have said you know we know that the the wrath of God is imminent uh we don't stand here with questions as we look at the chaos that is in the world we don't stand here and say well why why why why is the politicians act like that for and why are they passing laws like this why is the children why are the schools why why is you know why why is everybody just looking like they're zombies and depressed what what what you know we we we don't stand here with questions wondering well why is the divorce rates High why are people turning into homosexuals and transgenders what what what what's going on no we have answers don't we and and we know this that the wrath of God is coming the wrath of God is approaching and this world is falling apart this world world is shaking this world is nothing can stand this this this nothing of the kingdoms of man can stand all of these Kingdom belong to the devil ain't that right and there's nothing amen that that coincides amen with God's will amen for a new Earth and a new Heaven and and and these things and so it all has to pass away it all has to go and man's sins have come up before God and and and and mercy Mercy's about over how many believes that you can't hardly get people to an altar anymore you can't get them enthused anymore about God Amen it it just seem like they they they laugh at you more than they respect you it just seems like it's just everything is so uh uh we've got more comedians in the Church of God and and rock concerts in the house of God and and and and the preaching has been done away with and what preaching they've got is so watered down and and these things and people's more interested in sports more in you you understand you understand what I'm saying right amen they're more interested in finding answers out in the world for their young people than they are of God cuz they don't see the answer in the Church of God anymore they don't see the power of God that can rescue their children and save them from a life of sin and and and and demise and all of these things so they look out there for their answers Amen to keep their chur you don't have to go to sports to keep your children in church you don't have to keep the movies to keep your children in church get them an altar show there is a living God a living reality can you say amen amen I think people need to get converted amen get an experience of God for themselves and they'll know that God can save that God can heal that God can do whatever amen see and it puts a drive in youen amen that's right see we realize more and more and more and we should every day that people that are going to be Left Behind it's it's it's going to be so horrible for them it's um brother Bram even you know brother Bram even tried to tell us how how bad it's going to get oh and you know in one place he said let me you know let let me be flate alive right let me be let me be chopped inch by inch let let him put sulfuric acid in my stomach you know let let and he's trying to describe the whr and he says let let all this be done you know to me but don't let me stand before that white Throne judgment and and and everyone that don't go on the Rapture is going to stand before that white throat in judgment you understand that right see it it's it's people are losing their minds which and here a prophet years ago told us that men would go completely insane to where they see a bird with with a a wingspan of what six blocks long or something like that and they'd see M ants rise up and he said it's not going to be literal it's all going to be in the mind and we're seeing Insanity like never before amen how many people that we talk to and young people that we talk to and and they just and and and they're seeing people in the rooms and and they're seeing things in the room amen what's happened their mental faculty is leaving them so so is is now what the prophet has been saying is coming to pass and most churches don't know what the problem is but we stand here with the message of the hour we know the trouble is we know what's coming we know can you say Amen you know what that ought to do to us it ought to put us in Earnest desire it should be put us in Earnest desperation to reach one Soul amen just one Soul can you say amen amen if we can take them with us amen I I'm glad that we're going in a rap I I'm glad that that we have that confidence we should have that confidence that that if God comes tonight we're leaving amen if the Rapture comes we're going ain't that right but we should want to take somebody with us don't let us get ease and Zing can you say Amen the Lord that's right see now we know that this is the evening time where God is requiring the token amen just as it was in the first Exodus God says when I see the blood I'll pass over you ain't that right and so the blood was the token at that time the literal blood of the lamb and it had to be applied over the doorpost of the house ain't that right had to be on display publicly and then the whole family had to be in the house can't be at Walmart can't be you know can't be at the movie house it it it it can't be just out playing around amen this is a serious moment you got to come in the house I guarantee you daddy wasn't just over pacified pass just a pacifist on that day I I guarantee he said look Junior you're coming in Oh Daddy but you don't understand I I I got friends I don't care what you got you're coming in you're going to stay in this house can you say Amen well well Daddy what are you going to do I'm staying in the house with you I'll be that first example I ain't going to work today I ain't doing this today I ain't doing that today amen but you you don't I just want a good old hamburger from Hardies I don't care what you want we're staying at this house amen because a token is applied there it ain't applied somewhere else amen Daddy's applied this for you son amen Daddy's applied it for this family amen and the prophet said the entire family had to be there and all the all outside the token amen he said the whole family had to be in the house where the token was displayed amen and all outside the token of the blood perished can you say man everyone outside that blood outside that token perished ain't that right amen it's just the same as it was in the days of Noah amen that God would send a prophet amen and it was Grace to that generation that God would send them a prophet it's Grace if you want to know the grace of God Amen just to think that God would send a prophet in this age and would lead you to be able to hear that prophet and to believe that Prophet that's great can you say man this world has seen Grace if they've ever seen a mercy seat they've seen it in this age Grace has come to us and it was Grace that God would send a prophet in that day amen because there was an elect amen that he had to reach there was an elect that had to be saved amen God could have just let them all go but God was rich in Mercy ain't that right so God had that Prophet preach a message he had him provide an ark and is that right there was only one door to that Ark the prophet stood at that door amen showing that there denominations ain't got don't know where that door is amen they can run they can shout Pentecostals don't know where that door is they can prophesy speaking tongues get emotional amen and all but that they don't even know where the power of God is Jesus said I am that door I am that door can you say amen and there was a prophet standing at that door in this age pointing to Christ revealing the door to us and we found out it's more than a sensation we found out it's more than just running all over the place we find out it's more than just whatever there is a power connected to this message God praise God but all had to get in the ark anyone that want to be saved had to get in that Ark it didn't matter amen they had to get in the ark that's right can you say amen amen all outside the ark perished amen and the prophet said all outside of the token of the Holy Spirit today is going to perish all outside so we know what the token is ain't that right he said no matter how good and how much church members there was a lot of them in the days of Noah there was a lot of them in the days of Moses but a man that failed to apply the blood as the token he perished and those who failed to go in the ark perished and those who failed to come into Christ today for he is the ark is going to perish can you say amen amen that's why we cannot get passive about this message that's why we must not be ashamed to tell people of what God has done in this day amen there's people out there that has questions and we have the answers you believe it yes sir I believe it's in 1 Corinthians it says by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body am not baptized into a denomination that's not baptized into a club or a social group amen we're baptized into the body amen the mystical body Hallelujah and it's a spirit baptism immersed by the spirit yes amen Prophet said then the token is on the door glory for you are in Christ and he W he was the one your sacrifice who stood the judgment and when God looks upon that he can't do a thing about it you think of that the blood if I could say it this way the blood neutralizes death it paralyzes the effects of death that's right God can't do nothing about it you're under a token can you say amen he says you're just as safe as you can be because God in Christ is the self-same person and the spirit has been made flesh and dwelt Among Us and there is god with his own self and you God with his own self and you in his own children into the body there you are not a chemical but the spirit I will pass over you so again as we know you've heard the token it's not a chemical blood anymore it's the literal life of Jesus Christ inside that believer it must be in us can you say amen amen see and so the prophet would say in the first Exodus he said they they they came all over from around the Egypt from all over Egypt the Israel was scattered all over Egypt that nation and he says they began to come over all gathered into one place in Goan see so so they could be under this token he says see they come he says and they have come from Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostals and everything else to get under the token oh aren't you glad for that amen if if you if you want to know why we we've come out of Pentecostals and why we've come out of all the Baptist and denominations and and why we we we you young people that been raised in the message and and and why we don't teach these things anymore is because we've gathered under a token we we we know the seriousness of this thing amen we know the hour that we're living in can you say amen he says see we come we've gathered from all these denominations we come out of all of this amen together under a token like it was back then it was a pillar of fire that Pillar of Fire that's why there ain't no church amen uh uh well well you know uh I'll say it this way a church is a Fitting Place for that amen see it lets us know that there has been a pillar of fire amen we're not following man like David uh uh uh uh uh from Waco and and Jim Jones and and and all these things there has been a few Pillar of Fire that has identified this message like it did Moses message can you say amen amen and and that was a natural people that come out going to a natural land but they gathered under the same Pillar of Fire amen that we are the people that they represented they were the type we are the we are the substance can you say Amen yes sir it was a pillar of fire was represented there now notice and one told the other and another one told another and another one told another and the first thing you know here they all begin to come aren't you glad there's people that still tell about the message of the hour there's somebody that's got to listen amen there's someone that's out there and caught up in the mess and caught up in the world and caught up in man's ideas amen but here we are telling somebody God sent a prophet God sent a message God sent a supernatural sign to us come on Amen the rapture's coming come on Amen there's a way of escape from the tribulation that's at hand uh amen these things ain't just a passing thing it's the end of of civilization amen It's the End of Time It's the End of the World System amen and there's only one way to get out of this thing it's by the token you should never be ashamed of that Pillar of Fire oh yeah but we're afraid that they're going to worship the man if you've got enough experience your experience ought to tell them you're not worshiping a man can you say Amen they began to come and they watched the sign of God and they said judgment is at hand the church we know that this is the age of personal life of Jesus Christ Prophet said it right down through the age they had dip a dip of the Holy Ghost portion Luther had a dip of the Holy Ghost Wesley had a greater dip Pentecost St had a greater dip than that of the Holy Ghost he says now see he says see now the church has got to a place from Luther Wesley and the Revival is on to Pentecost and now everybody say and now don't you stop at a Pentecostal age amen you get preachers that trying to stop keep you at a Pentecostal age get away from that can you say amen amen it's token time so now into this age that we're coming now we're now coming who you you didn't come out of Baptist get into a Pentecostal mess amen you didn't come out of a Pentecostal mess for some message preacher to take you back that's [Music] right now into this age that we're coming now by the same Holy Spirit just more of it and then and when them Lutheran back there got saved they got a portion of the Holy Spirit when the Methodist got Sanctified that was the work of the Holy Spirit see it was a part of the Holy Spirit see they without us are not made perfect hello they without us are not made perfect that's right yes sir see now God as the light has begin to shine in the last days he is expecting us see a great thing from us yes sir amen don't just be satisfied with the Lutheran don't be satisfied with your Pentecost he's he's expecting a great thing from us see see because where there is much given there is much required so he is going to require much more of us in this age see than he did of the Lutheran or the methodists because we walk in a greater light with a greater power with a greater witness than what they have now we have a greater witness of the Resurrection we have things more firmer more sure more solidified than what they [Music] had you realize that this is the age that Jesus Christ has done more than what he ever done in his when he walked on the earth that's right he didn't do that in Luther didn't do it in Wesley or Pentecost he done it in this age amen amen can you say Amen that's right amen he sure did amen amen see so it's just like in the Old Testament see the prophets had their part of the word for their age they had part they had a portion and and these things but all the time it was getting closer and closer and closer and closer but they had a each one had a portion for their day but then Jesus came who was the fullness of the word he was the fullness hello amen amen that's right so the prophet said see he was the word itself he was all the prophets were plus the rest of God he was all that the prophets were plus the rest of God is that not where we're at this is the only time that the evening time there's been required God has required a token amen amen can you say Amen the fullness of God the fullness of his life in us all that they were all that the Lutheran were all that the the the Pentecostals were and the wesle were plus the rest of godl all that God was he poured into Christ is that true amen sir and all that Christ was he poured into the Church the bride right yes amen so we're not sitting in a message wondering what the token is we know exactly what that token is hallelujah can you say amen amen amen it's adoption time adoption age amen believe it yes sir time PL church is over time for just being Church memb sitting on a Pew arguing about what Pew you get to set in is over oh that's nonsense it's over all this arguing about the music and all this arguing about the preacher and all this arguing about one another and all this dividing and fussing that's over that's pass there are some sons of God that have matured and now are adopted can you say man we're not like the Corinthian Church that just fuss and argued that well my favorite preacher is this one and and I'm a Paul and I'm of apollis and I'm of this and all this Paul had he couldn't teach what he taught the Ephesians and church brother BR never told us that we are the the Corinthian Church Pentecost was children babbling fussing fighting yes personalities hello we are the off Vision Church true I believe now brother Braham said the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls amen can you say Amen remember lot was the one the fire fell from the sky not back in the days of loah Noah that was the water came in his day but Christ expressed what type of ministry would be in the days of lot what Ministry was that MDC God made flesh God become human drank milk from a calf ain't that right a cow whatever eight that's right that dust on his shoes Hallelujah walking that's right ain't that right and he came to an elep now we see the Holy Spirit now today we see the Holy Spirit among his church in the same manner amen you love him hallu he says in this last day the fullness of the word has come in his son Jesus Christ God made flesh Among Us another place now he promised that he would appear in these last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh not just brother bram's brother branham's Ministry was to show us what time it was can you say Amen his ministry was the work of MDC ain't that right amen but he was not the whole body of Christ there is a body many membered body can you say amen and the same God that we saw in brother Brandon we're not worshiping that man but we saw God come in human flesh it wasn't a spoken word body and it wasn't a a a a body like Jesus Christ who knew no sin but this was a sex born body that had been redeemed so God would show by coming into that body right there a sinful body but a redeemed body that there was a power to this Calvary there was a power to his resurrection he had finally got a man that he can have full preeminent in and so is it in this age God's got a people praise God that he can have complete preeminence the token on display Hallelujah sir now he promised that he would appear in these last days in the form of human flesh again in your flesh like he did at the days of Sodom God which was Christ manifested in flesh now in his church his bride see they're coming together it's uniting time churches are uniting nations are uniting the Bride In Christ is uniting it's uniting time remember this is exactly what Jesus prayed that we would be one as he and the father are one that's right amen now Satan come and he says I'll make them a Oneness I'll I I'll do a Oneness and so he raises up the World Council of churches and every denomination is going back to it they're been sucked up into it and and and people world over are being sucked up into this to try to form a Oneness can you say amen amen but they're without a token there ain't no token on it amen one place brother BR said they'll probably unite to together to defeat communism and and these things and we're seeing all this taking place ain't that right but that's not the kind of Oneness that Jesus was praying for brother Brown said he said Jesus said be be one as I and the father are one yeah see be that kind of one well then how will that be the word in us would be the anointed word I say that again the word in us not just here now we've at the book it's in US it'll be the anointed word not some dried up sermon and some little teaching and and a little Theology and some psychology mixed in and everybody just sits there does their little thing no no no and everybody's still living living sinful lives and and all this and and not even I understand apostolics have tried it so many times to bring the people one to the word by all their legalistic ideas and all their legalistic things and all their legalistic you'll never get Oneness by legalism come on Church you'll never get Oneness by legalism I don't care how much law you put over the congregation you'll make a Oneness that way see the word in us would be the anointed word that's the Oneness of God the oness of God is the word anointed in you amen then you become a son a messiah to the or of the age that's the token Hallelujah to God on display right yes sir now notice the people are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age how are we getting ready we are getting ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age only one messenger you believe it can you say it with me there's only one messenger don't need another messenger not following some personality not following some other Prophet if there is a prophet that rises that Spirit of a prophet will be subject to the prophet can you say Amen that's exactly right that's why brother Brandon couldn't teach anything outside of what Paul taught can you say Amen Paul taught it in Mysteries brother brandom taught it in Revelation that's exactly right church we don't need another messenger for our age we don't need somebody else to find direction for the church you have the direction by the message of this hour hello Hallelujah to God yes sir and in her in her in the bride will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus sayith the Lord can you say Amen now notice so we understand where the token is what it is I hope you do if not go listen to the Token amen but see now we looking at Rahab here comes the here comes the Joshua going to take the land right amen he send spies over there brother called them tape boys amen what were they doing they were spreading the same message that Joshua had so whether you press play or you get behind the pulpit and read quotes I think you're still a tape boy as long as you still preach the gospel and say it the way brother Bram said [Music] it that's my thoughts anyway so we find that he went they went and told Rahab they got in touch with Rahab God divinely ENT brought them together and they began to tell Rahab what was going to happen she said well we've already heard about the H the terror that you've all done we're shaking here we're all nervous now they're getting ready to leave but she says promise me just promise me yes sir promise me salvation promise me yes sir a refuge I know God is with you that's right I know that and I want to be saved that's right amen and them boys knew exactly what to say Amen take a token yeah let it be displayed amen and if that token is on display that string that Scarlet thread if it's on display they didn't have to go ask the prophet Joshua and say is this okay they were divinely inspired can you say amen amen the same God that inspired Moses to put a token on on display there at at at the first Exodus I believe was the same God that was there and and said apply the token get the token on display ain't that right buddy when they left that's exactly what she done I guarantee you she stayed there amen making sure whatever she had to do to make sure that thing was solid that that thing would the wind ain't going to blow it trial ain't going to blow it the way ain't rain ain't going to wash it away I don't care sandstorms or whatever that token was going to remain forever amen and then she got so inspired by this she so believed this that that the protection was under the token wherever that token was thank God there was a believer that knew exactly where the token was they she wasn't confused about the token she wasn't listening to every preacher Tom Dick and Harry out there she believed the message of the hour she knew that God was with them men and if they said apply the token that's what I'm going to do and then she went through the city trying to get everybody that would believe her the prophet says that she tried to get every body that would believe her gather under the token she got her family she anyone that would believe her amen she brought them under the token and said we're going to stay right here oh but you don't know I understand I'm hungry stay right here the token they're coming judgment's coming hello amen yeah but don't you think that's a little crazy holding the string I don't care how crazy it looks I'm telling you I believe the message of the hour this is what they said to do and we're going to do now stay under the token this message might look crazy to us or to the people out there but it's the thing that God is in God has confirmed can you say man don't be ashamed of this message don't be ashamed well you say well if I tell them God sent a prop they'll think of us is more I don't care this is the one with the token Hallelujah bless the Lord rightall it amen she became concerned not only only for herself but for others Amen to me that's what a True Believer is ministry right Ministry is about laboring for Souls of mankind not just telling them about Jesus and not just being passive about it right but doing our best to get them where the token is yes Lord doing our best to get them where the token is amen Lord see this is what it's about when you're in Ministry Ministry you're burden for the lost that's right you're are burden for those who are bound and need to be delivered you are burden for the sick whom Satan is tormenting physically and mentally you want to see the Brotherhood among Believers amen you want to see the complexes d Dy that Satan has built up in the people you want to see people healed from the hurts and scars they have endured you you you want to see that Spirit of belie unbelief driven from the people get them where the token is get the token displayed you with me amen now Divine love is what causes the the individual to have a genuine burden for souls for lost souls and you remember brother Brown talking about Bert Hall you know the lizardy man said he was one of the best hunters there there was and Brandon apparently hunted with him on occasion and talked to him about the Lord but Bert Hall was just he brother BR said he was just mean yeah and so that day you know they stopped it was kind of snowing and I think they stopped and he he thought well you know he must be wanting to eat CU it was around lunchtime so he started getting his stuff out of the and he noticed he looked at Bert and Bert was smiling just that Wicked grin and he had a deer call and he blew that call and it sounded like a baby in distress baby fawn and he said right in front of them a do stood up looking around and and the prophet says that that D knew they were there she knew danger was there but her love for that baby that she thought was in trouble caused her to expose her self cause her to look around right yeah brother Brandon says that he thought oh God don't don't let him do this right and he said he he just looked away he just couldn't stand to look at it and to to see this cuz Bert had his gun toward her and going to shoot her but he said the he just closed his eyes and but nothing happened so he kind I looked and Bert was over there just sobbing and he said Billy Le lead me to that Jesus you've talked to me about Hallelujah brother Bram said well what was it he said he saw the love of that mother right that mother deer and he was able to connect that with Calvary the love that Jesus had for us that he would be willing to be laugh scoffed and rejected and mocked and killed for the sake of our needs amen so brother Bram said see she was willing to face the danger to make sure see he was he was willing to make sure that it was safe and all that and he says and the love of God will cause us to do the same it'll cause us to go right out in the face of the enemy and in the face of danger or anything to bring in lost souls to the kingdom of God right that's what divine love does it it it causes us with a passion doesn't matter if we're laughed at it takes all the ashamed us away it takes all the embarrassment away because we there there's there's a passion for souls and of course this is the Father's will right so brother Bram say see when we pray now and and I trust this is okay for you today but he says when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers as I said now believe for oursel and apply the token to the whole family like in Egypt Jericho or even in Acts 16:31 about the Paul telling the Roman Centurion believe thou and all thy house shall be saved see apply it to your family if you got an unsafe child lay the token right on top of him and say Lord I claim him and stay right there if you got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay that token on them and say Lord I God I claim it but now notice now he says move all of the worldly trash out of your house get ready for it burn up your shorts throw the card tables away get rid of your cigarettes dump your unbelief and your church papers in the trash can where they belong see then then you're getting ready can you say Amen get all the another place said get all the old love magazines stories out just get get get it all out it it see you know um you why he says you're you're getting ready then amen then then then what do you do then apply the token in prayer with real evidence real Faith see apply it hello how you going to apply it with faith apply it with confidence and when you apply the token no everybody say no that you are cleaned up know that you're not carrying baggage know that you're doing exactly what he wants you to do you you you've got the trash out of your home you're you're not looking at that filth on the internet come on you ain't got your mind all caught up in the comedies out there amen you're not bringing all that movies and kissing and cussing and for you young people just to let you know from my kids youngest to to whatever brother Brian said when you kiss a girl or a girl kisses a guy and you're not married you've potentially committed adultery amen can you say Amen well you say I'm not doing all that what about the movies you watch come on brother so let them commit the adultery in our home amen hello it's true you got to get it out sweep sweep it out God help us all right get it all out then you can apply that token with faith confidence can you say amen amen I hope you understand see this is why we try to live clean this is why we try to live holy this why we try to live right absolutely amen because of the token right so he says see move move move out all the worldly trash out of your house get ready for it burn up your shorts throw away your card tables get rid of your cigarettes dump your unbelief and your church papers in the trash can where they belong then you're getting ready then what do then apply the token in prayer with real evidence real Faith apply it apply it with confidence when you apply the token know that you are CLE C up if our heart condemns us not then we have our request amen so this is exactly what we're doing see as as true believers now the True Believer see is not only concerned for himself but he's concerned for others ain't that right now the brother brandom says this as long as you people he's talking uh uh well he's knows this going around the world he says as long as you people are doing them things that's wrong how you going to ask God to do do anything for you when you know you're wrong that's the reason we just stagger up and stagger back I'm not saying this to hurt I'm saying this to straighten out to get things right how are you going to build it upon the chars of Sodom and gomorah can you say amen amen so this is why God has called us out because it's token time amen that's right amen that's right how we need fathers and mother others to be so awakened knowing the reality of this message that where we can die that that that we can die to ourselves be so concerned for our children that we won't live life for us that we'll live knowing that if God was to come I must have the token not only for me but for my home if we only knew just how much our children are depending on us especially the the wward ones you're the one that has the ability to apply the token amen amen it's a Ministry yeah absolutely you're serving others can you say Amen praise the Lord yes we should have a passion for one another but praying but but not only just that we should have a passion for Souls what about the the the the worker the employee the employer what about the millions of people or we say hundreds of people that we come in contact I thought of brother brandham reading one place says I'm on my second million souls for Christ praise the Lord that's a lot of souls but then where he when he went over remember he's laying said you're getting old he's laying on the bed said you're getting old he said I really ain't done anything for Christ haven't done much and here he spent most of his life with Christ he gave his all amen but see that's Divine love you realize that okay so I went a million but that ain't enough so I win one but that's not enough so I win two that's not enough I've got to reach everyone that I can can you say Amen Lord you love him amen amen praise the Lord I'll stop there got a lot more to go but we'll stop there but if the musicians will come bless his name we've got the greatest message on the face of the Earth sir we're the Most Blessed people sir thank you God help us not to squander it help us to take what we've got and work for him Lord do all that we know to do don't get caught up in yourself don't get caught up in your selfishness live your life for him live your life for others and no matter what it would be always be sensitive to his leadership can you say Amen thought of you know God may just sometime allow us to be get broke down on the side of the road and someone come and help just so we could talk to him about the Lord you just never know what God has if we could just be sensitive to his Spirit can you say amen [Music] amen I've got the words here now so maybe we can sing that did y'all find it on there too all right give me a key here's my everything I give you every part of me I
