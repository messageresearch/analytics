[32:03] for the moving of the water for an angel
[32:06] went down at at certain Seasons into the
[32:08] pool and troubled the water and and and
[32:12] and whatsoever then first after the
[32:13] troubling of the water stepped in was
[32:15] made whole of whatsoever whatsoever
[32:18] disease disease he had and a certain man
[32:21] and a certain man was there which had
[32:23] which had and and and infirmity 3 and8
[32:28] years and Jesus saw and Jesus and and
[32:31] when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[32:33] had he he he had been now a long time in
[32:36] that case he saith he saith unto him wil
[32:39] wil thou be made made whole and the
[32:41] impotent man answered him saying sir I
[32:44] have I have I have no man no man no man
[32:48] when when when the water is is no man
[32:52] when the water is troubled to put me
[32:53] into the pool but while I am coming
[32:56] another steth down down down before me
[32:58] and Jesus saith saith unto him rise and
[33:02] take up thy bed and walk and immediately

[33:10] heads our dear gracious Heavenly Father
[33:13] the Lord how we love you and Lord how

[33:27] just to come down and move in such a
[33:29] mighty special way tonight father we ask
[33:31] you Lord for for it not to be a
[33:35] halfhazard way Lord but Come With all
[33:37] sincerity and reverence Lord before your
[33:38] throne father we ask you Lord just to
[33:41] walk the aisles and touch each and every
[33:42] heart and life here we pray Jesus
[33:44] Christ's name amen amen y' y'all can uh
[33:49] can can have your seats I uh uh I've had
[33:53] this thought on my mind especially with
[33:55] our meeting coming up um in at
[33:56] atmosphere for a Revival and then
[33:58] brother Shawn gets up and preaches an
[34:00] atmosphere for a Rapture Sunday so I I
[34:04] told him downstairs I was like I'm
[34:05] probably going to change my subject but
[34:07] here I am so y'all have to uh uh uh uh
[34:13] help help help me out here and and and I
[34:15] and I I I pray it becomes as real to you
[34:18] to you as it is to me and uh and so we
[34:23] look at we look at the um the scripture
[34:26] where where where the angel had come
[34:28] down and and he and he troubled the the
[34:30] waters and and whenever the waters was
[34:33] troubled um on the first man to um step
[34:37] in it was immediately was immediately ma
[34:40] ma made whole and and the and but but
[34:43] but yet you look at what these what
[34:46] these what what this was doing was was
[34:49] was brother brandom said said said said
[34:53] that that that that that that that there
[34:57] was a great multitude tude of of of of
[35:00] people there and that and and that they
[35:04] were just watching that water and
[35:06] waiting on it for the slight for the
[35:07] slightest stir a and so so that way
[35:11] there so so so that with they they there
[35:14] that they could they could jump in or or
[35:17] or dive in and and and be and be made
[35:20] made made whole but but but but but you
[35:22] see they were expecting they were
[35:24] expecting that angel to show up at at
[35:26] any moment the
[35:28] atmosphere in in in that place in that
[35:30] place m m must have have been in such a
[35:33] way where where that where where where
[35:38] that where that you could feel that
[35:40] charge and that electricity and that
[35:42] electricity there of of of people just
[35:44] anticipating to to jump in there um um

[40:47] began to to remind him of what the
[40:48] scriptures say say say about about what
[40:50] has to happen and and and he and he
[40:54] stopped and began to listen he's like
[40:56] yeah you're exactly right and I said in
[40:57] America is there's there's not one thing
[40:59] that that any man could could could ever
[41:01] do could ever do to to to turn this
[41:05] country around and because be because be
[41:08] because because because because because
[41:11] she she she's doomed and as much as I
[41:14] love America but but but but but but but
[41:16] yet but yet but yet but yet for for us
[41:19] as Christians it's the most it's the
[41:21] most amazing time and the most
[41:22] encouraging time time time the most
[41:25] encouraging time
[41:27] that that that that that there is and

[41:55] what he's saying in in in in front of
[41:57] his eyes but but but yet but yet but yet
[42:01] but yet as as as as as as Believers it's
[42:05] the most glorious time and it's the most
[42:06] encouraging time for us because we know
[42:08] that just any day now we are crossing

[43:04] failing them everywhere everywhere
[43:06] everywhere everywhere for fear and and
[43:09] and and but but but yet then but yet
[43:12] then we as the bride of Christ we shall
[43:14] see the son of man coming coming coming
[43:17] in in and a cloud of great power and of
[43:20] great glory and when these things when
[43:22] these things shall shall shall when

[43:48] evening time it shall it shall be light
[43:51] but but but yet but but but but yet men
[43:53] are men the the the the these these men
[43:56] and women throughout the country they're
[43:57] worried about the economy they're
[43:58] worried about about this and about that
[44:00] and the nations are just tanked and the
[44:02] world is and the world is falling apart
[44:05] but um brother brandom said said said
[44:08] this he he said he he said notice this
[44:10] character when you see women just go
[44:12] just go on on the Rampage just do just
[44:15] doing anything anything that they want
[44:17] to do watch the church is doing the same
[44:19] thing too notice he he he said he he
[44:23] said he said he said he said he he said
[44:26] he said but what but but watch when the
[44:27] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[44:29] a Revival when she begins to come back
[44:31] and line herself up with the word of God
[44:34] watch then watch then you see how that
[44:36] the scriptures at that
[44:38] time there there there there there will
[44:42] be a message sweep out to catch that
[44:44] bride to catch that to catch that woman
[44:46] woman elect for as the world Satan the
[44:50] the the the the the deceiver who who who
[44:54] the deceiver who deceived the first
[44:56] bride to sining against God by
[44:57] misbelieving by misbelieving
[44:59] misbelieving he his word and now and now
[45:03] today as we see the church natural in in
[45:06] your intellectual gospel gospel going
[45:08] further and further away from from from
[45:12] the word in the Social Gospel we find
[45:14] that the women of the world on the
[45:15] streets members of such as carrying
[45:17] themselves in in the same atmosphere you
[45:20] can't tell them they've lost all all
[45:22] sense of common decency uh the the the
[45:25] the the people have see and that's the
[45:27] way and that's the way the church has
[45:29] and you can see it going straight
[45:31] straight straight to to to to to to the
[45:35] to the to
[45:37] the acumenical council just as certain
[45:40] as anything as anything in in in the
[45:44] world and right into Rome as hard as as
[45:46] it can go see cuz it's prophesied and
[45:48] there she is that's her behavior but so
[45:52] so so so so so so so so so we can we can
[45:55] step back back and look around us we and
[45:57] we see we we see how how how these
[45:59] nations are falling apart and how these
[46:01] churches churches have completely turned
[46:03] turned have completely turned turned
[46:06] turned to to to the
[46:09] world and yet the this whole entire
[46:12] world is is she's in an atmosphere and
[46:14] she's right for
[46:16] judgment um um um a a and the prophet
[46:21] Prophet told us told us told us that
[46:24] that that that if God does doesn't
[46:26] doesn't judge doesn't judge America soon
[46:28] he's obligated to to to raise up to
[46:31] raise up Sodom
[46:33] Sodom and gorah and and
[46:36] apologize to but but but but yet at the
[46:39] same time the same time that judgment
[46:42] was was was was was falling on on on on
[46:46] on that City God God God was sitting
[46:49] there making a making a unconditional
[46:52] Covenant Covenant with with with Abraham
[46:54] and we and and we we as the bride of
[46:56] Christ when this when when when the when
[46:59] when when others rule is falling apart
[47:00] and judgment is striking is is striking
[47:02] the the the the the the world over the
[47:06] bride is sitting there in full
[47:08] confidence and and full Authority and in
[47:10] full Assurance because God has made an
[47:11] unconditional Co Covenant Covenant
[47:14] Covenant Covenant Covenant W with her
[47:16] the the the this this world has has has
[47:19] created has has has created such such an
[47:23] and and and and and atmosphere that that
[47:28] that that the things that things that
[47:29] that we used to see see see see see when
[47:33] I was a kid would would would shock you
[47:35] but but now but but now you see the same
[47:38] thing and it's just another day on the
[47:40] streets why because this world this
[47:42] world is completely the atmosphere that
[47:44] this world has has has has has has
[47:47] created is right for judgment but but
[47:50] but yet as the bride of Christ we can
[47:52] stand there in full assurance and in
[47:54] full confidence knowing that the that
[47:55] that that that the atmosphere that work
[47:57] that we're creating is is is is creating
[48:00] that atmosphere for for a
[48:04] Rapture brother random says said said
[48:07] that uh you you you you you get around
[48:10] around where where there where there's
[48:13] where there's where there's arguments
[48:15] and you get in into that type that type
[48:18] of of an atmosphere if there's something
[48:21] if there's something in the church
[48:22] someone who who's who's disobedient and
[48:24] very ugly acting acting acting acting in
[48:26] the church and causing trouble you'll
[48:28] never be able to have a Revival as long
[48:30] as that kind of of of an atmosphere of
[48:33] an atmosphere fear fear it is around and
[48:37] so you have to have everybody he he he
[48:40] said he said he says he says if you'll
[48:44] notice when the Holy Spirit came came
[48:46] came came came on when the Holy Spirit
[48:49] came on on on on on on Pentecost they
[48:51] were all in one place and in one Accord
[48:53] and waiting and waiting for for uh a and
[48:57] waiting for a a promise and when we get
[49:00] like that the the Revival will be there
[49:02] then he said that's right it's an
[49:05] outpouring it's an
[49:08] outpouring of the Holy Spirit and and so
[49:12] so so so so so when but but when those
[49:14] Believers those Jews they were they were
[49:16] standing around that pool and they were
[49:19] just watching for any any kind of kind
[49:21] of a movement of a movement on that
[49:23] water but but but when water when that
[49:26] water began to move it was a sign the
[49:28] the the waters have have have had had
[49:32] been been been been been troubled it was
[49:36] time to throw down your clutches or or
[49:38] or jump off your C or whatever it was
[49:40] and and jump and and and and and jump in
[49:44] there because it was a sign that God was
[49:45] there and something was fixing to take
[49:47] place but but but and and and and and
[49:52] and today we as the bride of Christ we
[49:54] are watching we are watching for the
[49:55] movement for the
[49:57] movement of God and and and and we know
[50:02] that and we know that Waters always
[50:05] means it's it's always a symbol a symbol
[50:07] of people of
[50:09] people in the Bible in in uh Revelations
[50:12] chapter chapter 17 says says says says
[50:18] the thickness and multitudes of people
[50:19] is in the water so so so so so so so so
[50:25] so when we as the bride of Christ Christ
[50:27] Christ Christ when when this bride has
[50:29] has come has come has
[50:31] come to together under such an
[50:36] atmosphere around the word of God when
[50:38] when when you see the Waters of the
[50:40] people coming coming coming coming to to
[50:44] to to coming together from from from all
[50:47] over the world and they begin to gather
[50:49] they began to gather
[50:51] on onto the word word onto the word for
[50:54] this day and and in this hour why what
[50:57] is it it's a sign that that that that
[50:59] that that that that God is getting ready
[51:01] to to to to to do something and and and
[51:06] I say he is doing doing something all
[51:10] across the world we see we see the signs
[51:12] and the Miracles and and God's people
[51:14] standing forth on on on on her feet with
[51:17] all authority and with all power and
[51:20] she's and what she declares God backs it
[51:22] up why because she is part of the of
[51:26] of of the body of Christ and what she
[51:28] says God backs up she is standing here
[51:31] with all authority and with all power
[51:33] and she and she's gathered around and
[51:35] that atmosphere has started has started
[51:37] has started to to to to to to create
[51:40] itself where where where we become and
[51:43] one mind and one Accord and just like
[51:46] they did they did they
[51:48] did and in that upper room and they were
[51:50] with their one mind and one Accord we
[51:52] are standing across the world today the
[51:55] bride of Christ and I'm not talking
[51:57] about the these um these um these
[52:00] denominational people or even or even or
[52:02] even people who who who who claim the
[52:04] message but but but but they constantly
[52:06] are arguing with the prophet and
[52:07] constantly constantly saying saying well
[52:10] that's just that's just that's just
[52:12] that's
[52:12] just he his opinion or or or or they
[52:17] argue about the cloud or they are they
[52:19] they um argue about the pillar of fire
[52:21] but yet the True Body of Christ I'm
[52:22] saying the ones the ones who standing
[52:24] firm on the word of God that God has
[52:26] sent to us and in in our last day where
[52:29] where where they're standing forth and
[52:30] they're Gathering and they're
[52:32] Gathering under that that that that that
[52:35] fresh Mana in these last
[52:37] days and they're standing forth and that
[52:40] atmosphere is come has come to such a

[59:13] he says he says he he he said he he said
[59:16] you would like to know what I think the
[59:17] greatest need the greatest need of the
[59:20] Church of the Church of the Church of
[59:22] the church church today is what what I
[59:26] what I think the lacking is there's no
[59:28] there's no there's no soul soul
[59:30] travailing the people are not broke up
[59:32] enough there's no burden there's there's
[59:34] no burden there's no burden seemingly
[59:37] and and you give me someone that's just
[59:39] so tore up about lost souls that that
[59:41] they are just wanting a r Revival so bad
[59:43] that that they just can't they can't
[59:45] they just they just can't hardly eat
[59:46] they simply can't if you read the
[59:48] history of the world of the world you'll
[59:50] find out it's always taken that kind of
[59:52] a spirit to to bring a Revival that's
[59:54] right see when Zion when Zion when Zion
[59:59] travailed
[1:00:01] and why why why then she brought forth
[1:00:04] children you see you have to be tore up
[1:00:06] it's the atmosphere of anything and what
[1:00:10] is it we we we we see it's it's it's
[1:00:14] it's it's it's it's it's my poost my
[1:00:17] it's it it's signs hanging up everywhere

[1:06:20] because we just any day now we get to
[1:06:22] march on up on up and out of
[1:06:25] here so so so so you begin to to to look
[1:06:30] at the troubling of the water the angel
[1:06:32] he when when um he
[1:06:36] would come down he would begin to stir
[1:06:39] that that that that that that water up
[1:06:42] maybe just dip his finger and then start
[1:06:43] spinning it around that pool to to where
[1:06:46] it become all choppy but but but the
[1:06:48] angel he made that atmosphere so so so
[1:06:51] he made that atmosphere so much through
[1:06:53] that the people's expectations they were
[1:06:55] just expecting it they were it was it
[1:06:57] was like soon as that water moves and
[1:07:00] and maybe they they they jumped in there
[1:07:02] when when some wind was blowing it and
[1:07:03] it wasn't even e e e e even even the
[1:07:07] angel but yet their expectation was so
[1:07:10] high high high high high that when that
[1:07:13] angel came down BR brought that
[1:07:15] atmosphere down and began to Stir It Up
[1:07:17] that that the people's expectations was
[1:07:19] so high was was was so high that they
[1:07:21] would all be diving in there the first
[1:07:23] man to touch it was the first man to get
[1:07:25] healed but but but yet we as but but but
[1:07:28] but yet we as the bride of Christ we
[1:07:29] were just like we was just like that
[1:07:31] eagle that
[1:07:32] eagle and and and in the barnyard we was
[1:07:35] content every day with just with just
[1:07:37] with just pecking away at some corn on
[1:07:39] on the grass or or or or or or or or
[1:07:43] just the bugs the the the um the the
[1:07:46] bugs and yet one day we heard a scream
[1:07:48] and we looked up and we began to change

[1:07:54] atmosphere that that that that that we
[1:07:56] was in we was no longer just just
[1:07:59] pecking around the Barnyard but but yet

[1:08:14] because we have heard that prophet in
[1:08:16] our last days scream out scream out
[1:08:19] there to
[1:08:21] us and and and yet when we heard that it
[1:08:24] caused us to look up and realize that
[1:08:26] that that we were not some
[1:08:28] denominational chicken we're not some
[1:08:29] kind of denominational meal just just

[1:25:40] We Are We Stand worthy through the blood
[1:25:43] of Jesus Christ not in
[1:25:46] ourselves and one more quote here and
[1:25:50] um um uh this this this right here here
[1:25:56] was powerful it says now the gospel
[1:25:57] common believed is the word of God and
[1:25:59] and that is true in one sense but the
[1:26:02] word of God is not the gospel alone the
[1:26:04] word of God is the seed that produces
[1:26:06] the gospel and Jesus had a s went forth
[1:26:09] went forth and slded seed and some fell
[1:26:10] in Stony places and and and and and some
[1:26:15] and some and some and some some fell
[1:26:19] fell by the wayside and the fouls of the
[1:26:21] of the air had and fouls of the of of
[1:26:24] the of the air devoured them and some
[1:26:26] fell fell upon Thor thorny thisle ground
[1:26:28] and some went over and some went over
[1:26:30] and and and and and and brought and
[1:26:35] brought a a and brought a a hund fold
[1:26:38] now the seed you see now the seed you
[1:26:42] people here who are farmers every seed
[1:26:43] will produce if it's the right kind of
[1:26:45] ground and every Divine promise of God
[1:26:47] in the Bible will it will Pro produce if
[1:26:51] it's met in the white kind of heart
[1:26:52] it'll it will it will Pro produce the
[1:26:55] promise if you have if if you have if
[1:26:58] you have the the need of of of of of if
[1:27:03] you have the need of Salvation believe
[1:27:05] that he saves you and that and you
[1:27:08] accept and you accept his his
[1:27:09] sacrificial death and ye and ye shall
[1:27:12] shall and ye shall shall receive what
[1:27:14] you've asked for if you are weary and
[1:27:16] glooming and and feel like everyone's
[1:27:17] against you he said come unto me All Ye
[1:27:20] Ye that labor and and are and are heavy
[1:27:21] laden I will give you rest that's a seed
[1:27:24] accept it and if you're sick he was
[1:27:26] wounded for our our for our for
[1:27:29] our for our transgressions and with the
[1:27:31] stripes we are healed accept it it's a
[1:27:34] seed it will it will produce itself and
[1:27:36] when you sew a seed you don't dig it up
[1:27:38] every morning every morning to to to to
[1:27:41] to to see to see if if it's come to pass
[1:27:44] if you do your seed will will never come
[1:27:46] up you've got to plan it commit it and
[1:27:48] let it alone it's up to Nature God it's
[1:27:51] up to Nature and God God ends up to God
[1:27:53] to water and to see and to see and to
[1:27:55] see what what and to see what what it
[1:27:59] produces is is is is that true so so
[1:28:02] that's the way you do the word of God
[1:28:04] accept in a good heart already
[1:28:05] fertilized and all the creepers and the
[1:28:07] rocky places and the Stony doubts is
[1:28:09] taken away and in good rich soil of
[1:28:11] Faith believe it com commit it come come
[1:28:15] commit it to God and and and walk away
[1:28:17] testifying that you have received what
[1:28:19] God has all what God has has what God
[1:28:23] has promised promis promised you and
[1:28:25] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:28:27] to make right anything that that you
[1:28:29] confess that he has done that's the
[1:28:31] gospel now the gospel isn't only the
[1:28:33] word now he now now now now this part
[1:28:35] here could you imagine be people people
[1:28:37] freezing to death and I would paint them
[1:28:39] a picture of fire and say look at that
[1:28:41] fire burning isn't it warm look at all
[1:28:43] the people standing around there warming
[1:28:45] but that's only a picture of something
[1:28:47] that has been you just freeze up the
[1:28:49] same and
[1:28:51] and he he he he he said he said you just
[1:28:53] free just the same same same same same
[1:28:57] looking at the picture what what what it
[1:28:59] takes is that fire to to to to to fire
[1:29:02] to be to be to be reproduced again for
[1:29:04] your warmth and and the gospel that was
[1:29:06] in that day it's written in the word as
[1:29:08] a history a pain and fire of what was
[1:29:11] except the same seed that they accept
[1:29:13] and it will become a living a living a
[1:29:15] living a living reality in you that'll
[1:29:18] bring you into the same experience that
[1:29:20] they had and and according according to
[1:29:23] the writers of the scripture the great
[1:29:25] the great the the the great Paul the
[1:29:27] great St Paul said the gospel came to us
[1:29:29] not by word only but through Power and
[1:29:32] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:33] when Jesus commissioned the church to go
[1:29:35] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:29:37] he he said go into the go world and
[1:29:39] preach the gospel to every creature and
[1:29:41] he and and he that believeth believeth
[1:29:43] and is baptized shall be sa saved but he
[1:29:46] that but he that that but he that that
[1:29:48] believeth not in these signs shall shall
[1:29:51] follow follow them that
[1:29:53] believe um so we as a bride of Christ we
[1:29:56] can stand here in all in all confidence
