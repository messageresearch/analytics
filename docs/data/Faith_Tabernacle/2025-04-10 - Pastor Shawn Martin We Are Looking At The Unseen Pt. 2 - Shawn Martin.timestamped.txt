[44:26] what we are here is a reflection of what
[44:29] we are somewhere else as the prophet
[44:31] said And there's just something about
[44:34] coming together and uh uh worshiping you
[44:38] from our hearts. And I know there will
[44:41] be a time that we'll be gathered in the
[44:44] beyond around your throne worshiping
[44:47] you. And this is just a taste of what it
[44:51] will be. But we're asking, Father, that
[44:53] you would just uh anoint this part of
[44:56] the service, God. And father, help me to
[45:00] get myself out of the way. And Lord, may
[45:02] you just speak to your people. Give us
[45:05] the liberty, Lord, to uh to hear and to
[45:09] receive of you. We ask it in Jesus
[45:12] Christ's name.
[45:15] Amen. The u um second
[45:19] Corinthians and um we're going to look
[45:22] at the fourth chapter.
[45:25] We read this, I believe it was last
[45:28] Wednesday, and
[45:30] um maybe we'll start at the 15th verse.
[45:34] Says, "For all things are for your
[45:36] sakes, that the abundant grace might be
[45:40] might through the thanksgiving of many
[45:42] redounded to the glory of God. For which
[45:46] cause we faint not, but though our
[45:48] outward man perish, yet the inward man
[45:51] is renewed day by day." And think of
[45:54] that now. Though our outward man perish,
[45:58] yet the inward man is renewed day by
[46:00] day. For our light affliction, which is
[46:03] but for a moment, workketh for us a far
[46:06] exceeding and eternal weight of glory,
[46:09] while we look at not at the things which
[46:12] are seen, but at the things which are
[46:15] not seen. Um, for the things which are
[46:19] seen are temporal, but the things which
[46:22] are not seen are eternal. Amen. You can
[46:26] have your seats this um evening. And I
[46:30] want to maybe use the title again. We
[46:32] are looking to the unseen.
[46:35] And um um you know that's that's the
[46:39] believer is we we look and that's what
[46:42] Paul was saying is we the believer we
[46:45] look not to the things that are seen but
[46:49] to that which is unseen.
[46:52] And so uh the prophet said now the
[46:55] unseen is the only thing it's the only
[46:58] thing that a Christian can depend upon
[47:01] because it's the promises of God. Aren't
[47:05] you glad for that? The promises of God
[47:08] are the unseen and that is what is the
[47:12] only thing that we can base our uh we
[47:15] can depend upon. Uh so Paul would tell
[47:18] us that the unseen is eternal. Um it it
[47:23] can't um you know uh can't fade. It it
[47:26] can't um uh disappear upon on us. And uh
[47:31] uh but the things that can be seen are
[47:35] just temporal things. It's that means
[47:37] that um it's here today, it's gone
[47:41] tomorrow. Uh temporal things will not
[47:44] last. Uh uh you you uh it's it you you
[47:49] know uh the temporal things are like uh
[47:51] the shifting sand. Uh you cannot build
[47:55] anything upon. You can't build your life
[47:57] upon your hopes upon your faith upon uh
[48:01] because they're just temporal things and
[48:03] uh you could have it in your graphs
[48:05] today and and lose it tomorrow. That's
[48:08] that's just the way it is. And so the
[48:11] temporal things are meant to
[48:21] die uh or temporal. It's going to pass
[48:24] away. uh uh the monetary things of the
[48:27] world are going to pass away.
[48:29] Entertainment is is going to pass away.
[48:32] And you know, this nation has built upon
[48:35] uh entertainment. They they've built it
[48:37] upon uh something that is not solid. Um
[48:40] uh movie stars and sports stars, they're
[48:43] they're going to pass away. Uh they're
[48:45] they're just temporal. And and so this
[48:48] is why, you know, you might uh uh young
[48:51] people put these big old posters of
[48:53] these uh movie stars or uh sports stars
[48:56] or whatever and and and as an idol, but
[48:59] but it it doesn't help them. Um uh they
[49:03] just pass away. It's they're just
[49:05] temporal things that you cannot build uh
[49:08] your your life upon at all. And so uh
[49:14] Jesus said the heavens and earth are
[49:16] going to pass away. U and and so uh we
[49:20] can't build upon that. Uh and and so
[49:23] those who build their future and their
[49:26] hopes, their dreams and all these things
[49:29] upon uh uh temporal things uh will they
[49:33] will always end up disappointed. They
[49:35] will always end up uh let let down and
[49:39] brokenhearted and things. And so
[49:41] anything that the world offers uh is
[49:45] temporal and and and of course it it's
[49:47] going to pass away. And so if your joy,
[49:51] if if your peace, if your uh um you know
[49:55] um uh love, if that all comes from the
[49:59] world, if if then then all of that is
[50:02] temporal, it it's going to pass away. uh
[50:06] uh there if your satisfaction comes from
[50:08] the world and and and uh uh the worldly
[50:11] things well that's going to pass away
[50:13] too uh because it's going to come to its
[50:16] end. It's only temporary. Anything that
[50:19] the world has uh is is going to pass
[50:22] away. That's that's it. Even the Bible
[50:25] states that the pleasures of sin are
[50:28] only for a season. So sin can be
[50:31] enticing. Sin can be pleasurable. sin
[50:34] can be fun. Uh uh you you we call
[50:37] brother Brandham called it enticing
[50:39] spirits and and so uh uh the pleasures,
[50:43] the entertainments and all of the things
[50:45] that are out there uh uh they they can
[50:48] be fun, they can be enjoyable, they can
[50:51] to the flesh, they pet the flesh, they
[50:53] do all these things, but it's only for a
[50:55] season and and then it passes away
[50:58] because these things are temporal. And
[51:01] so the the unseen things well uh are
[51:05] what Jesus called things from up above.
[51:09] And uh uh they in other words they come
[51:12] from God. They're heavenly things. And
[51:14] and they're things that the world knows
[51:16] nothing about and cannot see. And so
[51:19] they're not earthly. And and so uh uh we
[51:22] we the Bible tells us to seek those
[51:25] things which are above. Jesus says also
[51:29] in Matthew
[51:30] 6:19, it says, "Lay up, lay not up for
[51:34] yourselves treasures upon earth, where
[51:36] moth and rust doth corrupt, and where
[51:39] thieves uh break through and steal, but
[51:43] lay up for yourselves treasures in
[51:44] heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
[51:48] corrupt, but and where thieves do not
[51:50] break uh through nor steal." I think of
[51:53] of people that have lived and and they
[51:55] live for the moment. They live for
[51:58] wealth. They live for uh for the
[52:00] monetary things. And they're successful
[52:03] with these things. And and then you you
[52:05] you look at them and and maybe they're
[52:08] old and and uh you know, they're they're
[52:10] up in age. And you're thinking, well,
[52:12] you know, they've lived all their life
[52:15] for this. They have forsaken God. They
[52:17] have they have forsaken the the ways of
[52:20] righteousness and all that and poured
[52:22] their energy into into the monetary uh
[52:26] substance of life and and and people
[52:28] live to there there's those that live
[52:31] just to be movie stars and they want to
[52:33] be famous and and uh they they want to
[52:36] make the big bucks in that way. or uh uh
[52:39] maybe a young man's gifted and he'll go
[52:41] through high school and he'll dedicate
[52:44] himself to that football, baseball,
[52:47] soccer, or whatever it would be. And and
[52:49] then he achieves and goes, you know,
[52:51] gets the scholarships for college and
[52:54] and then he becomes number one in the
[52:56] college and in the game and then he goes
[52:58] to the draft and and all of these things
[53:01] and it's achievements, but then it comes
[53:04] to an end. And you know, I I can't help
[53:07] but to think, what does it do them then
[53:09] out of all of that? Amen. And uh uh they
[53:13] have forsaken God. They have forsaken
[53:15] prayer. They have forsaken the the the
[53:17] right things. They have forsaken and and
[53:20] here we come on a Wednesday night. And
[53:22] it's foolishness to a lot of people to
[53:24] come and and to lift up hands and to
[53:27] worship God. And they don't see the
[53:29] value in them things. And but but when I
[53:32] look at it, I'm thinking but even if
[53:34] they had, you know, I think I'd
[53:36] mentioned it Sunday, even if they had a
[53:38] million years and they lived uh the
[53:41] wealthiest uh uh individual for all them
[53:44] millions of years and and they had
[53:47] everything at their uh fingertips,
[53:50] anything they wanted, all the power to
[53:53] exercise. And then that last day comes
[53:56] of their million years. What does it do
[53:59] them then? But see, what we're looking
[54:02] to is things that have no end. It's it's
[54:05] an eternal value. It's an eternal
[54:07] substance. Yes. Amen. We we've got to
[54:10] live. Yes. we've got to, you know, work
[54:12] and we've got to do certain things and
[54:15] all that. But see, when it comes to an
[54:17] end, and we know these things come, you
[54:20] can buy a new car today and give it time
[54:23] and and you'll be putting it in the shop
[54:26] and and you'll be working on it or
[54:28] you'll be putting it up in and getting
[54:30] another one or a house, you'll be
[54:32] remodeling or or all these things. that
[54:34] when things do come to an end in our
[54:37] lives, there's something that is eternal
[54:40] that we're looking to. Amen. Because
[54:43] that's where our joy comes from. So, so
[54:46] we're not to to lay up for ourselves the
[54:48] temporal things. Amen. That we know is
[54:51] going to come to an end. It has no
[54:53] lasting value. It gives temporary joy.
[54:57] It gives temporary satisfaction. But
[55:00] when it's all said and done, it comes to
[55:02] its end. But the unseen things are
[55:05] eternal and they come from the spoken
[55:08] word of God. Amen. Uh everything comes
[55:11] from uh uh the uh the word of God, the
[55:15] unseen and and uh because they are
[55:17] promises. Brother Bram again says the
[55:20] unseen things are the promises of God.
[55:23] Amen. So so uh uh them things are
[55:26] eternal. Uh again Luke
[55:29] 21:33 Jesus said heaven and earth will
[55:31] pass away but my words shall never pass
[55:35] away. So that is something that we look
[55:38] to that that's something amen that that
[55:40] we see uh uh now now we can look at this
[55:44] and and and our natural eyes can read
[55:47] this and there's a lot of people uh that
[55:49] read the Bible through and through every
[55:52] year sometimes twice a year and maybe
[55:55] there's some that even go three times a
[55:57] year. Amen. And and our natural eyes can
[56:00] see this but brother Brown said the
[56:02] hidden things are between the lines.
[56:04] That's that that's where it's really at.
[56:07] That's that's the value of this Bible.
[56:10] Amen. Is not just reading and memorizing
[56:13] scriptures and getting it appear, but
[56:15] it's actually being able to see the
[56:17] unseen of what God is really trying to
[56:21] say. Amen. And so, uh, the word is an
[56:25] eternal word which makes the unseen
[56:28] things eternal. Every promise in this
[56:32] written word, Amen. are unseen to the
[56:35] unbeliever. Now, think of that. Read it
[56:38] backward and forward. And yet, the
[56:40] promises are no value. They don't see
[56:42] the promises. Uh some people say it's
[56:45] just a book of history. Uh m maybe it's
[56:47] just a book of love. Or uh one man, you
[56:50] know, say, "Well, it's it's just a fairy
[56:52] tale." Amen. Or or you've got some that
[56:55] are so educated and smart that they take
[56:58] away promises and say, "Well, that ain't
[57:00] for today. God doesn't heal today. God
[57:02] doesn't work in miracles today. There's
[57:04] no such thing as a heaven. There's no
[57:06] such thing as a hell. There's there's no
[57:08] such things as these things and and or a
[57:11] move of God. And God doesn't the the
[57:13] Holy Ghost isn't the same. And Christ
[57:15] ain't the same yesterday, today, and
[57:17] forever. And and so they don't see the
[57:19] promises that we see. Uh uh it's just a
[57:23] book to them uh uh in that way. Uh but
[57:27] but that's because the the unbeliever or
[57:31] uh the natural man if we can look at it
[57:33] that way uh looks through his natural
[57:36] eyes natural eyes and gets a natural
[57:39] perception natural interpretation of
[57:42] what he's looking at and he only relies
[57:45] on his natural uh natural senses. He
[57:49] believes what the outward man tells him.
[57:51] Now we just heard what Paul read what
[57:54] Paul said. the outward man perishes. And
[57:57] and yet that's that's what the
[57:59] unbeliever, that carnal man, leans to.
[58:02] He believes what the outward man tells
[58:05] him and is affected by it and controlled
[58:09] by it. Amen. Now remember, the prophet
[58:12] taught us that we have an outward man,
[58:14] which we just read, an outward man, and
[58:17] an inward man. Amen. The outward man is
[58:20] renew or perish. Amen. it perishes. But
[58:23] the inward man is renewed day by day. So
[58:27] So there's something about that inner
[58:29] man that doesn't uh that that is
[58:31] eternal. It doesn't perish. Amen. It
[58:34] it's something that is renewed. It's
[58:35] able to renew itself. Amen. It get maybe
[58:38] get discouraged, but it renews itself.
[58:41] Amen. That's what makes us valuable
[58:43] Christians. Amen. And I I I look at our
[58:45] elders and and and Sister Jane and
[58:48] Sister Janice and Brother Bob and and
[58:50] and uh they've been through through many
[58:53] many many storms. Amen. Uh through life
[58:56] and and and yet they're they're still
[58:59] serving God. They still love the Lord.
[59:02] It's it's it's almost like they've never
[59:04] gone through things. And and you think,
[59:06] well, how is that? Well, there's there's
[59:08] an inner man that keeps being renewed
[59:11] day by day, but the outward man
[59:14] perishes. Now, uh um brother Brandham
[59:17] said, "The outward man is self." A man's
[59:20] self perishes. Um uh and it depends on
[59:24] what he sees and tastes and smells and
[59:28] hears and feels and he depends upon
[59:31] these five senses. And uh well well that
[59:34] outward man has no revelation and and no
[59:38] discernment. A he just goes by what he
[59:41] sees in the natural. He just goes by
[59:43] what he hears. In the in the natural he
[59:46] goes by what he feels and and touches
[59:48] and he goes by his reasoning and
[59:51] imagination and sensation, affection and
[59:55] conscience and and all of these things.
[59:58] And and that's good because we use them.
[1:00:00] uh we use our five senses and we use our
[1:00:04] the the five senses of our uh uh spirit
[1:00:07] and and these things uh uh these these
[1:00:10] these senses can be affected by God. How
[1:00:13] many believes that? Amen. Well, you're
[1:00:15] hearing tonight. Your your physical ears
[1:00:18] are hearing the gospel. I'm standing
[1:00:20] here physically preaching to you. Amen.
[1:00:23] And and through that preaching, you're
[1:00:25] actually hearing uh a a literal a
[1:00:28] literal thing. Amen. Uh but but we we we
[1:00:32] see things in the spirit. We I don't
[1:00:34] know if you've seen miracles. I've seen
[1:00:36] miracles. I've seen the lame walk. I've
[1:00:38] seen the blind see. I've seen legs grow
[1:00:41] out that was short uh shorter than the
[1:00:44] other. I've I've you know uh I've seen
[1:00:46] so many things in the way of miracles.
[1:00:49] Amen. But I saw that with my natural
[1:00:51] eye. So I thank God for our senses. I'm
[1:00:53] I'm so glad that I'm able to press play.
[1:00:56] Amen. and obey, you know, and and uh uh
[1:01:00] uh listen to what a prophet says and and
[1:01:02] I've got the ears to do that. I'm I'm so
[1:01:04] glad I can hear the voice of of a
[1:01:06] prophet in this days. So, we need our
[1:01:09] natural five senses uh uh there and and
[1:01:12] and yes, they they can be affected by
[1:01:15] the spirit of God when you're in the
[1:01:17] presence of God and they can actually
[1:01:20] agree with the word of God in the
[1:01:23] intellectual realm. Amen. And it goes
[1:01:26] from hearing, amen, down into the the
[1:01:29] spirit realm, uh, of reasoning,
[1:01:31] imagination, uh, sensation, and all of
[1:01:35] these things. But revelation doesn't
[1:01:38] come to these senses. Amen. Revelation,
[1:01:42] you can hear it, but you, it may not be
[1:01:44] revealed to you. Amen. A man can hear it
[1:01:47] and and and he can say, "Yep, that
[1:01:49] that's right." Down in that spirit
[1:01:51] realm, he can see it because he's
[1:01:53] reasoned with it. He's he's actually
[1:01:55] been able to say, "Well, I can
[1:01:56] understand that. I I can see how that
[1:01:58] can work." Amen. So, he comes even into
[1:02:01] an agreement. Uh but it's an
[1:02:03] intellectual. But the revelation doesn't
[1:02:05] come to these senses. Revelation doesn't
[1:02:08] work through these senses. It it it has
[1:02:11] nothing to do with these senses. See,
[1:02:13] your senses can disagree with the word
[1:02:16] of God just as quick as it can agree
[1:02:18] with the word of God. See, uh because
[1:02:21] Satan has access to these senses. It's
[1:02:24] just like, you know, a lot of folks that
[1:02:26] when they go to church, they hear a good
[1:02:28] sermon, hearing with the ear, a good
[1:02:31] sermon, and then go out the door and
[1:02:32] turn on the radio and listen to rock and
[1:02:34] roll with the same ears that they just
[1:02:36] heard. Amen. Uh uh uh the nice sermon.
[1:02:39] You understand what I'm saying? So, see,
[1:02:41] Satan has access to our our senses as
[1:02:44] well. I I've seen miracles and then, you
[1:02:47] know, you look out down the road and you
[1:02:49] see a bad picture on a billboard or you
[1:02:52] see something horrible. You know, I
[1:02:54] remember sitting at at a hospital one
[1:02:56] time and and how in the world it come on
[1:02:58] the on on a on a hospital uh television,
[1:03:02] I don't know, but but nudity and all
[1:03:05] that and and you just you're like, "What
[1:03:07] in the world?" But but see, the same
[1:03:09] eyes that saw the miracles are the same
[1:03:12] eyes that just saw the nudity. And and
[1:03:14] so so Satan is able to use the senses
[1:03:18] just as much as anything else. Amen. And
[1:03:21] and and he works on our reasoning. He
[1:03:23] works on all these things. So revelation
[1:03:26] doesn't come to the senses. Amen. Uh
[1:03:29] because they can disagree with the word
[1:03:31] and and more than they agree with the
[1:03:33] word, they disagree with the word. Amen.
[1:03:36] So So that outward man perisheth. Amen.
[1:03:39] And and it's always up and down. Up and
[1:03:42] down. up and down. Ain't that right?
[1:03:45] Amen. See, and and uh Brother Brother
[1:03:48] said this way, no one can look at what
[1:03:50] they see and be a Christian. You cannot
[1:03:54] be a Christian just by what you see. You
[1:03:56] can see miracles and then you can see
[1:03:58] someone uh acting up in church and you
[1:04:01] you can see um you know, you you you can
[1:04:04] see um uh uh someone dancing and you
[1:04:08] feel that emotion of that. Amen. to
[1:04:10] watch them get in the spirit and dance
[1:04:12] and shout. Then you can see someone
[1:04:14] chewing somebody out or uh someone doing
[1:04:17] a bad uh uh uhh pulling a bad deed, you
[1:04:20] know, and all these things. See, you you
[1:04:22] cannot look at what you see and be a
[1:04:26] Christian. Amen. See, Amen. The outward
[1:04:29] man is carnal. Amen. It perisheth. He He
[1:04:33] walks after the flesh. uh uh Romans
[1:04:36] 8:55, Paul would tell us, "They that are
[1:04:38] after the flesh do mind the things of
[1:04:40] the flesh, but they that are after the
[1:04:43] spirit, the things of the spirit." Amen.
[1:04:46] In other words, those that that walk
[1:04:48] after the the outward man, they mind the
[1:04:51] things of the outward man. Two different
[1:04:53] two different things. Uh those that are
[1:04:56] after the inward man, walk after the
[1:04:58] inward man. See? And so for to be
[1:05:01] carnally minded is death, but to be
[1:05:04] spiritually minded is life and peace.
[1:05:07] Because the carnal mind is immity
[1:05:09] against God, for it is not subject to
[1:05:12] the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[1:05:15] So the outward man is a is the carnal
[1:05:18] mind. It It's reasoning. It's uh it's
[1:05:21] leaning to the senses. Amen. And it's
[1:05:25] toppsyturvy. Constantly topsyturvy.
[1:05:27] Amen. But the the inward man the prophet
[1:05:30] said is God. Amen. Now that inward man
[1:05:34] see so if a man doesn't have God in him
[1:05:38] then he will only be affected by the
[1:05:41] outward man. Amen. Come to church for 50
[1:05:44] years and still complaining about the
[1:05:46] problems and seeing the problems in the
[1:05:48] church and and and seeing issues and
[1:05:51] this but there's no growth. There's
[1:05:53] nothing that is is is uh being renewed.
[1:05:57] amen in the inside of him that that
[1:06:00] brings him up up into the things of God.
[1:06:05] Amen. See, so if if a man uh a man needs
[1:06:08] God, can you say amen? No matter how
[1:06:11] many times a man goes to church and and
[1:06:13] and and how many times he hears the word
[1:06:16] of God preached, Amen. his life, Amen,
[1:06:19] will be up and down, up and down, up and
[1:06:21] down. Well, we we don't want to be up
[1:06:24] and down, up and down, top tossyturvy,
[1:06:26] and and and and uh I think brother or
[1:06:30] Paul would talk about being no more
[1:06:32] children, tossed to and fro. Amen.
[1:06:34] That's why the Bible talks about
[1:06:36] maturity, being able to stand and and
[1:06:38] and when when the world is changing and
[1:06:42] everything's changing, the age is
[1:06:44] getting more wicked and the darkness is
[1:06:46] prevailing. But we're not going with the
[1:06:48] we're not going with this. Amen. We're
[1:06:51] standing because we're being renewed day
[1:06:53] by day. Renewed day by day. Can you say
[1:06:56] amen? Amen. That inward man. Now, the
[1:07:00] outward man, if he feels saved, he says,
[1:07:02] "Well, bless God. I'm saved." You know,
[1:07:06] and and if he feels lost, then he says,
[1:07:08] "Oh, God, I I'm just lost." You know,
[1:07:12] and if the doctor says everything is
[1:07:14] looking good, amen, and all the symptoms
[1:07:16] say that everything is looking good.
[1:07:19] Well, bless God. I I'm I'm healed, you
[1:07:22] know. I I just Oh, praise God. God is my
[1:07:25] healer. But if the doctor says, "Well,
[1:07:27] things aren't looking good for you." And
[1:07:28] if the symptoms are in agreement with
[1:07:30] the doctor and and you're feeling all of
[1:07:33] this, then you're just like, "Oh, I
[1:07:35] don't know. I just don't know what's
[1:07:37] happened. I don't know if God is even
[1:07:38] watching after me. I I just don't know."
[1:07:41] You know? Well, see, you're walking
[1:07:43] after the outward man. Amen. But the
[1:07:46] inward man, amen, cannot be affected by
[1:07:49] what the doctor says. It cannot be
[1:07:51] affected by the symptoms because it's
[1:07:53] being renewed day by day. Can you say
[1:07:57] amen? Well, see, and so we we find that
[1:08:01] God must come and live in the inside the
[1:08:06] soul of a man. Amen. And when God comes
[1:08:09] and lives in the in the soul of a man,
[1:08:12] well, then the word uh uh that gene
[1:08:15] seed, the word is quickened. Amen. Uh
[1:08:19] it's quickened, comes to life. And and
[1:08:22] so then then the word is able to have
[1:08:25] preeminence in in in you. Amen. That's
[1:08:29] when the inward man is quickened to the
[1:08:31] word. Not quickened to the world. Not
[1:08:33] quickened to this. Not You may fall, but
[1:08:36] you're not quickened to them things.
[1:08:37] Amen. But you're quickened to thus
[1:08:40] sayith the Lord. You're you're quickened
[1:08:42] to the word because something now that
[1:08:45] gene seed of God, the real you that we
[1:08:48] talked about, Amen. comes alive to the
[1:08:50] word of God. Well, aren't you glad for
[1:08:53] that? See, so every believer, Amen, uh
[1:08:57] uh lives by what the inward man tells
[1:09:00] him. Amen. Brother Brandham asked, he
[1:09:02] said, "Well, what is a believer?" Then
[1:09:04] he answers it. It's the faith of God
[1:09:07] that moves in you. Well, the faith of
[1:09:10] God uh does not just operate in the five
[1:09:13] senses of the flesh or the five senses
[1:09:15] of the body. The faith of God operates
[1:09:18] down in that soul. So when the five
[1:09:20] senses, amen, uh uh uh tells you
[1:09:23] something contrary to this word, well,
[1:09:26] there's something inside the inward man,
[1:09:28] the faith of God that says, "Oh, don't
[1:09:30] you listen to that." Amen. You take God
[1:09:32] at his word. Can you say amen? because
[1:09:35] you're not looking at the things that
[1:09:37] are temporal. You're looking at things
[1:09:40] that are
[1:09:41] unseen. Amen. See, and so, uh, second
[1:09:44] Corinthians, uh, uh, five and and seven,
[1:09:48] it it says we walk by faith and not by
[1:09:51] sight. Everybody say we walk by faith,
[1:09:54] not by sight. Not by natural sight. Not
[1:09:57] by these natural eyes. Not by these
[1:09:59] natural senses. Not not by what I hear
[1:10:02] naturally. Not what by You can hear it
[1:10:04] all you want to. You can hear even the
[1:10:06] prophet. You can hear it every day of
[1:10:09] your life hearing that prophet. But if
[1:10:12] there's no faith there, you're only
[1:10:14] hearing with the natural. Amen. The
[1:10:17] natural ears. And and and this is how
[1:10:20] people have walked away from the message
[1:10:22] even though they have claimed a man to
[1:10:24] be in the services or they've claimed a
[1:10:27] man to seen the miracles and they've
[1:10:29] claimed this and they've claimed that
[1:10:31] one man even claimed that an angel come
[1:10:34] to him and told him that this message
[1:10:36] was right. A man gave it years later and
[1:10:38] he walks away because he was walking
[1:10:41] after the in outward man. Amen. He was
[1:10:44] being controlled by the outward man.
[1:10:46] Amen. and the outward man. Amen. When
[1:10:49] these critics uh started uh challenging,
[1:10:52] you know, about the bridge and about
[1:10:53] this and about that. Amen. And then call
[1:10:56] him brother Brand, I'm a liar and and
[1:10:58] all of a sudden that outward man perks
[1:11:00] up. You You mean I'm following a a fddy
[1:11:04] duddy? You mean I'm following someone
[1:11:05] that's fake? You You mean what? And
[1:11:08] before you know it, Amen. He follows
[1:11:10] after that, calling the pillar of fire.
[1:11:13] Amen. a a false thing and making fun of
[1:11:16] the angel, making fun of the prophet,
[1:11:18] making fun of all these things. Amen. I
[1:11:20] sat with him. Amen. And he tried to get
[1:11:22] me to walk away, too. Amen. But the
[1:11:24] inward man says, "No, no, no. I'm not
[1:11:26] going to listen to that. I don't care
[1:11:28] what kind of proof you've got. I don't
[1:11:30] care." Amen. That has nothing to do with
[1:11:33] me. I've seen vindication. Amen. I know
[1:11:36] it to be right. I know it to be real
[1:11:39] because the inward man is being renewed
[1:11:42] day by day. Amen. See, so so now uh if
[1:11:47] you think of it, we're not walking after
[1:11:49] the outward man, but we're we're looking
[1:11:51] at things that are
[1:11:53] unseen. Now, uh faith, Amen. Now, now we
[1:11:58] just read, we walk by faith, not by
[1:12:00] sight. Well, faith is the eye. Everybody
[1:12:03] say, faith is the eye. Faith is the eye
[1:12:07] through which the believer
[1:12:09] sees. Amen. Faith is the eye through
[1:12:13] which the believer sees. Brother
[1:12:15] Brandham called it the eye of faith.
[1:12:18] Looking through the eye of faith. Amen.
[1:12:21] Now in Hebrews
[1:12:23] 11:13, Paul writes about men and women
[1:12:27] in the Old Testament. And he says,
[1:12:29] "These all died in faith, not having
[1:12:32] received the promises, but having seen
[1:12:34] them a far off. How did they see things
[1:12:39] that were
[1:12:40] unseen?" Amen. By the eye of faith, and
[1:12:44] were persuaded of them, and embraced
[1:12:47] them, and confessed that they were
[1:12:50] strangers and pilgrims all on the earth.
[1:12:53] Aren't you glad for that? See, so they
[1:12:55] had to see the promises. Amen. before
[1:12:58] they became persuaded of them. Amen. And
[1:13:01] before they become persuaded of them or
[1:13:05] or then they had to be persuaded of them
[1:13:08] before they could embrace them. And once
[1:13:11] they embrace them, then the confession
[1:13:14] came. I am not of this earth. Amen. I
[1:13:18] don't belong here. Amen. I'm looking for
[1:13:21] something that is eternal. I'm going to
[1:13:23] an eternal place. I came from an eternal
[1:13:26] place. So what happened? They were
[1:13:28] seeing something, amen, that the the the
[1:13:31] the unbeliever could not see. They were
[1:13:35] seeing something that they could not see
[1:13:37] with the natural eye. But whatever they
[1:13:40] saw caused them to to confess that I am
[1:13:43] just a pilgrim and a stranger. Amen.
[1:13:46] I've never been to where I'm going, but
[1:13:48] I know I'm going. I know there's a place
[1:13:50] that's real. I know there's a a
[1:13:52] theophony. I know there's a body that is
[1:13:55] waiting for me because they were looking
[1:13:58] in the unseen through the eye of faith.
[1:14:03] That's good. Now, so the eye of faith
[1:14:05] sees, you know, uh
[1:14:08] um when revelation is given, so these
[1:14:12] that that uh uh in the Old Testament
[1:14:15] with the eye of faith, they seen the
[1:14:18] promises in the types and shadows,
[1:14:21] right? Amen. I I believe it. Every
[1:14:24] believer when they were slaying that
[1:14:26] lamb, they it was a natural lamb,
[1:14:28] natural blood, natural sacrifice, but
[1:14:31] they were seeing the promises, amen, of
[1:14:34] another lamb. Amen. This was just a
[1:14:37] type. This was just a shadow, but there
[1:14:39] was something about it that they were
[1:14:41] looking at the promise instead of
[1:14:43] looking at the natural lamb.
[1:14:48] So the eye of faith sees when revelation
[1:14:51] is given. That's the only time that eye
[1:14:54] of faith can see is when revelation is
[1:14:57] given. Now the word revelation is an act
[1:15:00] of revealing to view or making known. So
[1:15:03] when God makes a
[1:15:05] revelation that's for the believer to
[1:15:08] see it,
[1:15:10] right? Sure. So the Old Testament saints
[1:15:13] did not live without
[1:15:15] revelation. They they could see what was
[1:15:17] coming because it had been uncovered.
[1:15:20] God uncovered certain things to them and
[1:15:24] they could see the promise and it caused
[1:15:27] them to embrace it. They were persuaded,
[1:15:30] embraced and confessed in it. So it's an
[1:15:34] act of revealing to view or making known
[1:15:37] communicating divine truth and
[1:15:41] enlightening. So So the inward man sees
[1:15:43] the unseen, speaks of the unseen and is
[1:15:48] convinced of the
[1:15:50] unseen, persuaded of the unseen, more
[1:15:54] persuaded of the unseen than he is the
[1:15:56] seen. Can you say amen? Amen. The unseen
[1:16:01] is more positive to the believer than
[1:16:03] that which we can see with the natural
[1:16:05] eye. So, so we're more convinced about
[1:16:08] what we know and what we see than what
[1:16:10] the world is convinced about what
[1:16:12] they're seeing.
[1:16:15] True. They talk about a future, but
[1:16:17] they're not convinced in it because they
[1:16:18] have no promise in it. They're not
[1:16:20] seeing a future. Amen. It's just false
[1:16:22] hopes, false promises, false this. But
[1:16:25] the world is shaking. Amen. because they
[1:16:27] know that things are coming to an end.
[1:16:30] There's no future there. But what we're
[1:16:32] seeing, we're looking at the unseen and
[1:16:34] we're seeing something that is far
[1:16:36] greater and it's our future.
[1:16:41] So, it takes revelation to see the
[1:16:43] unseen.
[1:16:45] Now, there were several men in the Bible
[1:16:47] who looked at the unseen before it ever
[1:16:49] became a physical
[1:16:51] reality. Like like Job. Job said, "I
[1:16:54] have heard of thee with the hearing of
[1:16:56] the ear, but now my eye seeth thee."
[1:17:00] Amen. See, and so now look, the eye of
[1:17:04] faith. Through the eye of faith, he saw
[1:17:06] the redeemer living. For he said, "I
[1:17:10] know my redeemer
[1:17:11] liveth." Ain't that right? And yet the
[1:17:15] redeemer hadn't come. But yet through
[1:17:17] the eye of faith he saw him. Amen. and
[1:17:20] also through the eye of faith. He said,
[1:17:23] "For though these skinworms eat my
[1:17:25] flesh, yet in my flesh I shall see my
[1:17:29] God." Can you say amen there? Job 19:26.
[1:17:32] Now notice he by revelation through the
[1:17:34] eye of faith he saw himself coming up
[1:17:36] out of the grave. Behold, after these
[1:17:39] skin, my skin worms destroy this body,
[1:17:41] yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I
[1:17:45] shall see for myself, and my eyes shall
[1:17:48] behold, and not another, though my
[1:17:51] reigns consume uh be consumed within me.
[1:17:54] So, he wasn't looking at the natural.
[1:17:57] God had unveiled to him. And by the eye
[1:18:01] of faith, Job saw himself coming out of
[1:18:04] that grave, standing as a man and seeing
[1:18:08] his redeemer,
[1:18:11] looking to the
[1:18:12] unseen through the eye of faith. Noah
[1:18:16] saw the rain years before it fell.
[1:18:19] Right? Because it had been revealed to
[1:18:22] him. Amen. 120 years he kept preaching.
[1:18:27] But the man didn't get discouraged. The
[1:18:29] man didn't quit. The man didn't give up
[1:18:31] and finally look at all his golfers and
[1:18:33] says, "You're right." Amen. It was just
[1:18:35] a It was just a madeup thing. No, he
[1:18:38] literally saw it. He saw something that
[1:18:41] was more real than all their scientific
[1:18:44] machinery. Amen. That they were looking
[1:18:46] at and the machine saying there ain't no
[1:18:48] rain up there. But Noah by faith, he saw
[1:18:51] through the eye of faith. He saw the
[1:18:57] unseen. Through the eye of faith,
[1:18:59] Abraham saw the promised son years
[1:19:02] before he came because it had been
[1:19:04] revealed to him. Ain't that right? Jesus
[1:19:07] said to the Pharisees in John 8:56,
[1:19:10] "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
[1:19:13] day and he saw it and was glad." Can you
[1:19:17] say amen? Amen. Why? He was able to see
[1:19:21] beyond that veil of flesh. Amen. And
[1:19:23] there was a man standing there in front
[1:19:26] of him. Amen. And that was eating the
[1:19:29] same food that Abraham was eating. He
[1:19:31] had dust on his clothes, dust on his
[1:19:34] shoes. Amen. And he was sweating from
[1:19:36] the the heat just as Abraham was
[1:19:38] sweating. But Abraham saw the unseen. He
[1:19:42] saw God in that body.
[1:19:46] He was looking at the unseen.
[1:19:49] Oh, aren't you glad for that? Now,
[1:19:52] Brother Brown said Sarah had been barren
[1:19:54] all her life, but Abraham never looked
[1:19:57] at what his eyes would see, these
[1:20:00] natural eyes, an old wrinkled woman,
[1:20:02] many years past the time of life to have
[1:20:05] children. But he looked at the unseen
[1:20:07] and he saw
[1:20:09] Isaac. Amen. He was able to look past
[1:20:12] that wrinkled up woman and he saw Isaac.
[1:20:18] True. Hallelujah.
[1:20:21] And after looking to the unseen, he
[1:20:24] called those things which were not as
[1:20:26] though they were. Yes, he did. That's
[1:20:28] why because he was seeing in the unseen,
[1:20:31] he saw Isaac and he was acting as though
[1:20:34] he was already there. Calling those
[1:20:37] things that were not as though it
[1:20:39] already was.
[1:20:44] He got a glimpse of the unseen. The
[1:20:47] prophet said by faith he saw it. thing
[1:20:49] of calling those things that are not as
[1:20:52] though they were. What are you calling
[1:20:54] tonight? Are you calling of the present?
[1:20:56] Are you looking at the present and
[1:20:58] saying, "Well, I'm sick. I ain't getting
[1:20:59] any better. I've I've been prayed for
[1:21:01] and nothing's happening or I I'm just I
[1:21:04] just don't know. I'm this and I'm just
[1:21:05] that and everything's looking bad and
[1:21:07] all these things." Well, once you ask
[1:21:09] God to open up your eye of faith to
[1:21:12] where you can look at the unseen, and
[1:21:14] when you look at that unseen, you'll be
[1:21:16] saying, "I'm healed. I'm well. I'm
[1:21:18] victorious. Yes, I am a son of God, a
[1:21:21] daughter of God. Not what this outward
[1:21:24] man is telling you, but what the inward
[1:21:26] man is saying.
[1:21:29] Hallelujah. Amen. He called those things
[1:21:32] that were not as though they were. Did
[1:21:35] not God do the same thing? Isaiah 46:9,
[1:21:39] remember the former things of old. For I
[1:21:41] am God and there is none else. I am God
[1:21:44] and there is none like me. declaring the
[1:21:46] end from the beginning from and from
[1:21:49] ancient times, the things that are not
[1:21:51] yet done, saying, "My counsel shall
[1:21:53] stand and I will do all my pleasure."
[1:21:55] Think of that now. Amen. He was calling
[1:21:58] those things that were not as though it
[1:22:01] already was. Declaring the end from the
[1:22:04] beginning.
[1:22:07] God, isn't that wonderful?
[1:22:10] Did not go Did not God call Abram
[1:22:14] Abraham, which means the father of
[1:22:16] nations? And yet he had not one son. He
[1:22:19] had no even no proof that he was going
[1:22:22] to have a son. And yet God called him
[1:22:25] the father of nations. God himself was
[1:22:28] calling those things that were not as
[1:22:30] though it already was. That's right.
[1:22:33] Did not God call Sarah Sarah, which
[1:22:36] means princes, and yet she was yet old
[1:22:39] and barren and wrinkled up and and all
[1:22:42] these things. And yet God would call her
[1:22:44] what she was going to be. Called not
[1:22:47] calling her what she was, but by faith
[1:22:50] he called those things that were not as
[1:22:53] though it already was.
[1:22:56] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:23:01] What were the types and shadows speaking
[1:23:04] of? They were telling of those things.
[1:23:07] Did you you you know that the types and
[1:23:09] shadows had a voice? They spoke of
[1:23:12] things and yet they were telling of
[1:23:14] things that were not yet
[1:23:18] in a in in
[1:23:19] existence. The lamb was telling of
[1:23:22] Christ and yet he wasn't even in
[1:23:23] existence.
[1:23:25] Amen. the the the the priest was was
[1:23:28] telling uh of another priest to come and
[1:23:31] yet it wasn't in existence. Uh
[1:23:34] everything of types and shadows was
[1:23:36] speaking of the eternal things and and
[1:23:39] uh even the tabernacle all these things.
[1:23:41] Amen. The Bible says he patterned the
[1:23:43] tabernacle after an eternal tabernacle,
[1:23:47] the heavenly Lord. Speaking of things
[1:23:50] that were not as though they were. Can
[1:23:53] you say amen?
[1:23:55] So by his fornowledge, think of it, God,
[1:23:57] now think of God calling those things
[1:23:58] that were not as though they were. God
[1:24:02] called
[1:24:03] you, justified you and glorified you
[1:24:08] before you were ever born, before you
[1:24:10] were even thought of. Yet God before the
[1:24:14] foundation of the world called you,
[1:24:17] called those things that were not as
[1:24:19] though it already was. Amen. Yes, he
[1:24:23] did. True.
[1:24:26] By his fornowledge, you say, "Well, how
[1:24:28] did he do it?" By fornowledge, he was
[1:24:30] looking into the unseen.
[1:24:33] Hello. He was seeing the unseen. Yes, he
[1:24:36] was. Bless the name of the
[1:24:39] Lord. In 2 Corin 2 Thessalonians 2:7,
[1:24:43] Paul said, "For the mystery of iniquity
[1:24:44] doth already work. Only he, speaking of
[1:24:47] the Holy Spirit, who now letth will let
[1:24:50] until he, speaking of the church,
[1:24:53] brother Bram said, Christ the bride, be
[1:24:55] taken out of the way. Now, think of this
[1:24:58] now. Here we are. That was written
[1:25:01] uh uh close to 2,000 years ago, and Paul
[1:25:06] is telling of a bride that would be upon
[1:25:09] the earth and would be taken out of the
[1:25:11] way. How could he say that except he was
[1:25:15] looking through the unseen and the
[1:25:17] revelation caught him and he could see a
[1:25:20] bride being caught out.
[1:25:23] Amen. True.
[1:25:26] So see God foretold of you and yet you
[1:25:29] weren't even born but he could speak of
[1:25:32] you because he saw you. How many
[1:25:35] believes the Lord saw you? Amen. See,
[1:25:38] and and now, Brother Brandham said,
[1:25:40] "Now, the reason Abraham could believe
[1:25:42] was because God said it." Amen. See, the
[1:25:46] Bible says that Moses through the eye of
[1:25:48] faith saw him who is
[1:25:50] invisible. Amen. There, there Moses was
[1:25:54] with one foot on the throne, the prophet
[1:25:56] said. But yet through the eye of faith,
[1:25:58] he was looking at the unseen. Amen. And
[1:26:01] it caused him to refuse to be the son of
[1:26:05] Pharaoh. Can you say amen? Because he
[1:26:08] saw the unseen. Oh my. He get ready to
[1:26:11] sit on the throne. He was next to
[1:26:14] Pharaoh. He was the mightiest one out of
[1:26:17] Pharaoh. Uh the most powerful one
[1:26:20] besides Pharaoh and and talented and and
[1:26:23] and had had the world at his fingertips.
[1:26:27] But when God revealed to him something
[1:26:31] that no one else could see, he looked
[1:26:34] and what he saw caused him to
[1:26:39] refuse the throne of Pharaoh. Refused to
[1:26:43] be called the son of Pharaoh. Can you
[1:26:46] say amen? That's right. See, see, he
[1:26:49] couldn't see it in the natural, but the
[1:26:51] prophet said through the eye faith, he
[1:26:53] saw that he was a son of Abraham.
[1:26:58] Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] He couldn't get that in the natural, but
[1:27:04] through the eye of faith, he saw he was
[1:27:06] the son of Abraham. He was looking at
[1:27:10] himself in the
[1:27:15] unseen. Couldn't see it in the natural,
[1:27:18] but yet he was looking at what had been
[1:27:20] revealed to him. Through the eye of
[1:27:22] faith, Moses saw the children of Israel
[1:27:24] in the promised land. He saw them as the
[1:27:27] people of the covenant. Amen. And yet
[1:27:31] they were in the slime pits. They were
[1:27:33] being beaten. They were muddy. They were
[1:27:36] broken. They were bowed under the weight
[1:27:39] and tired and burdens that the
[1:27:41] taskmaster had placed upon them. But
[1:27:44] when Moses saw them, he was looking at
[1:27:47] the unseen and seen a covenant people.
[1:27:50] Seen a victorious people. seen a people
[1:27:54] that were not slave, but they had an
[1:27:57] inheritance.
[1:27:59] He saw the unseen.
[1:28:03] Now notice, he saw them as the seed of
[1:28:06] Abraham. Now notice what brother Bram
[1:28:08] said. Pharaoh with no faith seen God's
[1:28:11] children as
[1:28:13] fanatics. No faith. See, he made them
[1:28:15] slaves because he wasn't scared of what
[1:28:18] he
[1:28:19] said. See, he wasn't afraid of God. He
[1:28:22] thought that he was God. He thought his
[1:28:24] gods that he served that he was a
[1:28:26] bishop. He was the head general
[1:28:28] overseer. His gods is the one that did
[1:28:30] it. Nothing to this thing here. So he
[1:28:33] made them slaves. He laughed at them.
[1:28:35] Made fun of them just as the people do
[1:28:38] today. The same thing exactly. Can you
[1:28:41] say amen? Why? Because he's looking at
[1:28:43] the natural. He don't see nothing of the
[1:28:45] unseen. He's not seeing what Moses saw.
[1:28:48] He saw them just poor uh imbeciles and
[1:28:51] and and helpless people, weak people. He
[1:28:54] saw them as people that he could dictate
[1:28:56] and rule over and use and abuse and all
[1:28:59] of these things. But Moses looking at
[1:29:02] them same people looking at the unseen
[1:29:05] saw a covenant that God had made with
[1:29:07] them. And it caused him to refuse to be
[1:29:11] Pharaoh's son. Oh my. You see, looking
[1:29:15] at the unseen is the only way that you
[1:29:17] can look at people of God different.
[1:29:20] Amen. When you're looking at the unseen,
[1:29:22] you will see them as children of
[1:29:24] Abraham. You'll see them as sons and
[1:29:27] daughters of God. You'll see. You
[1:29:30] understand what I'm saying, church?
[1:29:32] Amen. If you're just looking at the n
[1:29:34] through the natural at the people of
[1:29:36] God, you'll point out the faults. You'll
[1:29:38] see the faults. You'll see the failures.
[1:29:40] You'll see the ups and downs. you you'll
[1:29:42] see all just nothing but imbeciles and
[1:29:44] and all of these things just uh uh uh
[1:29:47] wasting their time and and all of these
[1:29:49] things. And that's what the world thinks
[1:29:51] of us. They don't see any value in the
[1:29:53] staying in the company of of of sons and
[1:29:55] daughters of God. Amen. They don't see
[1:29:57] any value of just hanging around the
[1:29:59] children of God or this church would be
[1:30:01] filled up and every other message church
[1:30:03] would be filled up. They don't see any
[1:30:05] value of of believing in a in a a
[1:30:08] prophet. And they they say, "Well, we're
[1:30:09] just following a man. We're just in a
[1:30:11] cult. We're just being brainwashed. They
[1:30:13] don't see any value of what we see. Can
[1:30:16] you say amen? But if you will look at
[1:30:18] the unseen, you will even see yourself
[1:30:22] as the royal seed of Abraham. Can you
[1:30:25] say amen? Oh, that's the way you look at
[1:30:28] yourself is through the unseen.
[1:30:31] Looking at the unseen. Can you say amen?
[1:30:34] Now watch. Brother Bram said, "The
[1:30:36] Christian looks at the unseen, not what
[1:30:39] you see here, but at what God said, for
[1:30:42] it's a promise."
[1:30:45] Ain't that right?
[1:30:47] So, he said, "The Holy Spirit in us
[1:30:49] takes every divine promise of God that's
[1:30:52] in his Bible and calls it present
[1:30:55] tense." I'll say that again. I think
[1:30:58] that's good. I You know, I I know you're
[1:31:00] tired, but listen now, church, you can
[1:31:03] sleep when you get home.
[1:31:06] Some of us only get one one church a
[1:31:08] week. So, so you know, listen. Amen. The
[1:31:12] Holy Spirit in us takes every divine
[1:31:15] promise of God that's in his Bible and
[1:31:18] calls it present tense.
[1:31:21] Amen. In us, the Holy Spirit in
[1:31:25] us looks at the Bible and doesn't say,
[1:31:28] "Oh, I wish it would happen. Oh, I just
[1:31:30] don't know. I'm just waiting for things
[1:31:32] to take place." No, it calls it present
[1:31:36] tense
[1:31:38] and it rest itself upon there.
[1:31:44] Ain't that right? Now, we know that a
[1:31:46] person can see something with his or her
[1:31:49] eyes and still not see what is truly
[1:31:51] there.
[1:31:53] Amen. We we mentioned Elisha and his
[1:31:56] servant last uh Wednesday of how that
[1:32:00] the the servant was looking at the army.
[1:32:03] And he and he says, "We're we're
[1:32:05] surrounded." And when Elisha come out,
[1:32:07] he looked and he saw the unseen. And he
[1:32:10] said, "More are they that are with us
[1:32:12] than they that are with
[1:32:13] them." And the servant's like, "What do
[1:32:15] you mean? What are you talking about?
[1:32:16] Are you looking at the same thing I'm
[1:32:18] looking at?"
[1:32:20] And Elisha knew that his eyes hadn't
[1:32:22] been open to see the unseen. So he
[1:32:24] prayed, "Father, would you just open his
[1:32:26] eyes?" And God opened his eyes to where
[1:32:29] he could look at the unseen. And there
[1:32:30] was a host of angels all around them.
[1:32:34] Oh God, open our eyes to where we could
[1:32:36] see the
[1:32:37] unseen. We could see victory is ours. We
[1:32:40] can see the promises are ours.
[1:32:45] The angels were unseen to the servant.
[1:32:48] John the Baptist was the Elias that the
[1:32:51] scriptures foretold of. But though the
[1:32:53] people saw him with their natural eyes,
[1:32:54] they didn't see that he was the
[1:32:56] fulfillment of scriptures. Amen. See,
[1:32:59] Jesus was the promised Messiah. And
[1:33:01] though the majority of the people saw
[1:33:03] him with their natural eyes, they didn't
[1:33:05] see that he was the fulfillment of
[1:33:07] scripture. Many had their own
[1:33:08] interpretation of what he was and who he
[1:33:11] was. But yet, he remained hidden to
[1:33:14] them. Now notice in Matthew 16:13, I
[1:33:18] won't take much longer, but he says,
[1:33:20] "When Jesus came into the coast of
[1:33:23] Cesaria, Philippi, he asked his
[1:33:26] disciples, saying, who whom who do men
[1:33:28] say that I, the son of man, am?" And
[1:33:31] they said, "Well, some say that thou art
[1:33:32] John the Baptist." See? Amen. Why? They
[1:33:35] were looking with their natural eyes and
[1:33:36] and and getting an interpretation of
[1:33:38] what they were looking at at the
[1:33:40] natural. Amen. See, some say Elias, some
[1:33:43] Jeremiah, some one of the prophets. He
[1:33:46] saith unto them, "But whom say ye that I
[1:33:47] am?" And Peter answered and said, "Thou
[1:33:49] art the Christ, the son of the living
[1:33:51] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:33:53] him, "Blessed art thou, Simon, for flesh
[1:33:56] and blood hath not revealed this to
[1:33:59] you." You didn't catch this by the
[1:34:01] outward man. You didn't reveal it unto
[1:34:04] thee, but my father which is in heaven
[1:34:07] hath revealed it. And when the
[1:34:10] revelation became known, he be the
[1:34:13] father uncovered who Jesus was to Peter
[1:34:16] and Peter was able to look beyond the
[1:34:18] natural veil of flesh and see the unseen
[1:34:22] and saw that it was Christ in human
[1:34:25] flesh.
[1:34:28] Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] The Bible says those that crucified
[1:34:32] them, had they known that he was the
[1:34:35] Lord of glory, they would have not
[1:34:36] crucified him. But they couldn't look at
[1:34:39] the unseen.
[1:34:43] Jesus appeared to the men on the road to
[1:34:46] Emmas. Yet the Bible says their eyes
[1:34:49] were holden that they should not know
[1:34:51] him. Think of it. He's walking with them
[1:34:54] and yet hidden in plain sight. Yeah.
[1:34:58] He walked with them, the prophet said,
[1:35:00] for most of the day talking to them,
[1:35:01] expounding the scriptures on the
[1:35:03] scriptures concerning himself.
[1:35:06] But it was at the evening time, the
[1:35:08] Bible says, that he sat at meat with
[1:35:10] them. He took bread and he blessed it
[1:35:12] and break it and gave to them and their
[1:35:15] eyes were open and they knew him. Amen.
[1:35:20] God opened the eyes of their
[1:35:23] understanding and they were able to look
[1:35:25] past the visual, the natural, and see
[1:35:28] the unseen.
[1:35:30] Hallelujah. Luke 17:30, foretold of the
[1:35:34] son of man being revealed in this day.
[1:35:37] Luke
[1:35:38] 21:27 says, "And then they shall see the
[1:35:41] son of man coming in a power with or in
[1:35:43] a cloud with power and great glory." Can
[1:35:46] you put that that cloud up? And they
[1:35:48] shall see the son of man coming. Think
[1:35:51] of it. Natural eyes, they shall see him
[1:35:54] coming in not in a thunderhead cloud,
[1:35:57] but in a cloud of angels. Yeah. Ain't
[1:36:01] that right? Amen. In the cloud of
[1:36:03] angels. Now, that picture when they
[1:36:05] first got that picture, it was turned
[1:36:07] around. I wish we do. We have it where
[1:36:10] it was turned around. Amen. It was
[1:36:12] actually turned around uh right now
[1:36:14] where you if you could see it, the earth
[1:36:17] uh is on the side of it because they
[1:36:19] turned the picture around to get the the
[1:36:21] the the the what was revealed. But they
[1:36:25] shall see the son of man with the
[1:36:26] natural eyes. They took pictures. all of
[1:36:28] these things. But remember Jesus said,
[1:36:31] "The world will no longer see me, but
[1:36:34] you, the believer, the unbeliever will
[1:36:36] no longer see me, but you shall see me."
[1:36:41] Only the believer will see him. Well,
[1:36:43] how does the revelation a believer see
[1:36:46] him? By revelation, it shows it. Now see
[1:36:51] now now listen brother uh uh first of
[1:36:54] all Matthew 11:27 all things are
[1:36:56] delivered unto me of my father and no
[1:36:58] man knoweth the son but the father
[1:37:00] neither knoweth any man the father save
[1:37:01] the son and he to whomsoever the son
[1:37:03] will reveal him so you won't know him
[1:37:06] except by
[1:37:07] revelation and god has to reveal it do
[1:37:10] you believe it brother said it's not how
[1:37:12] much you learn how much the bishop wants
[1:37:15] you to know it's how much God wants you
[1:37:17] to know if you can't See this
[1:37:19] revelation? Don't ask the bishop. Ask
[1:37:21] God. Don't ask your pastor. Ask God. The
[1:37:24] Son reveals him. Ain't that right?
[1:37:29] Matthew 11:25. At that
[1:37:32] time, Jesus answered, "I thank thee, oh
[1:37:35] Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[1:37:36] because thou hast hid these things from
[1:37:38] the wise and proved it and hast revealed
[1:37:40] them unto babes." So God hides it from
[1:37:44] some and reveals it to others. And no
[1:37:46] man can see it unless it's revealed to
[1:37:48] him. And God is the only one that can
[1:37:50] reveal it. Ain't that right? Now, this
[1:37:53] picture, I I want to I want to read
[1:37:55] another scripture because it shows us
[1:37:58] that we can't even get a revelation
[1:38:00] unless God reveals it. We can't see it.
[1:38:02] Even though it's there unless God
[1:38:04] reveals it. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9,
[1:38:07] "But as it is written, I hath not seen
[1:38:10] nor ear heard, neither hath entered into
[1:38:13] the heart of man the things which God
[1:38:14] hath prepared for them that love him."
[1:38:17] So it's the natural eye, the natural
[1:38:19] ear. You can't you can't catch it. You
[1:38:23] even though you hear it many times, see
[1:38:25] it many times, it will not not be caught
[1:38:28] by natural things.
[1:38:30] Natural studying, natural intelligence,
[1:38:33] natural this, God hath revealed them
[1:38:36] unto us by his spirit.
[1:38:40] See, so these things that are revealed
[1:38:43] are unseen.
[1:38:45] For the spirit searchth all things, yay,
[1:38:46] the deep things of God. For what man
[1:38:48] knoweth the things of a man, say the
[1:38:50] spirit of man which is in him? Even so
[1:38:52] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[1:38:54] spirit of God. Now we have received not
[1:38:56] the spirit of the world, but the spirit
[1:38:57] which is of God, that we might know.
[1:39:00] Everybody say that we might know.
[1:39:03] The things that are freely given to us
[1:39:05] of God.
[1:39:07] Now we have this this picture there.
[1:39:11] We've had the critics tell us and try to
[1:39:13] convince us that that's that's smoke
[1:39:16] from an airplane or from a rocket
[1:39:19] or from whatever.
[1:39:22] Amen. And and that's all they can figure
[1:39:24] up. Even when they took a picture,
[1:39:27] Brother Brandham said that they saw it
[1:39:29] all all in Tucson. We found out that
[1:39:31] they saw it all the way in Flagstaff.
[1:39:33] They saw it. They saw it miles and miles
[1:39:36] around and they were all wondering what
[1:39:38] is it? They actually, I think, put out a
[1:39:40] notice. If anybody knows what that is,
[1:39:42] come and tell us what that is. We we we
[1:39:45] don't know. It's They said it's too
[1:39:46] high. Amen. To to be a cloud. It's too
[1:39:49] high to be whatever it And. And so they
[1:39:52] they said a mysterious cloud. Amen. They
[1:39:55] called That's what they called that. But
[1:39:57] see now now when the prophet first
[1:39:59] looked at that picture and you can you
[1:40:02] can just cloud of angels. Look that up.
[1:40:05] The prophet first looked at that
[1:40:06] picture. That's what he talked about.
[1:40:08] Cloud of angels. Cloud of angels. and
[1:40:10] and that's a cloud of angels and and
[1:40:13] he'd always refer cloud of angels see
[1:40:16] but then later on something was revealed
[1:40:19] to him about that picture and he says
[1:40:22] now this picture I was standing looking
[1:40:24] at it and something I was standing in my
[1:40:28] room and something said turn it to the
[1:40:34] right now I listened something said to
[1:40:38] me turn it to the Right. And I thought,
[1:40:40] well, I think I'm looking at it
[1:40:43] right, but it said turn it right. And I
[1:40:47] thought, well, maybe that voice means
[1:40:49] turn it to the right. And when I did,
[1:40:52] you see what it is? It's the Hoffman's
[1:40:55] head of Christ at 33.
[1:41:00] Now, he was seeing the unseen.
[1:41:04] Amen.
[1:41:06] The critics are looking at the smoke and
[1:41:07] saying, "That's smoke." Even a prophet
[1:41:10] was just looking at and saying, "See,
[1:41:12] that's seven angels."
[1:41:14] It took the Lord to reveal to him. And
[1:41:17] when he turned, there's Christ.
[1:41:22] He says,
[1:41:23] "Look," he said, "Here, look in here.
[1:41:26] See his black beard." Now, if you look
[1:41:27] at the original picture, you can
[1:41:29] actually see an outline. But his black
[1:41:32] beard, his face, his eyes, his nose,
[1:41:34] everything else, the part in his hair
[1:41:37] here coming up, he's he's the he's
[1:41:40] wigged with that white angel wig to show
[1:41:43] that the message of him being God is the
[1:41:46] truth. He is the supreme judge of the
[1:41:49] universe. See, supreme judge of heaven
[1:41:52] and earth, he is God and nothing else
[1:41:54] but God. Another place, look what we've
[1:41:56] seen in this day. The quickening power
[1:41:58] has come to us to open the seals. See,
[1:42:00] he wasn't talking about that when he
[1:42:02] just saw it as seven angels. Amen. See,
[1:42:05] just seven angels. But now the
[1:42:07] quickening power of God has come to us
[1:42:09] to open the seals. What was that? The
[1:42:12] intelligences of a man know the
[1:42:14] quickening power of God. The quickening
[1:42:16] power of God foretold this would take
[1:42:17] place. The quickening power of God made
[1:42:20] the world to testify to it. It's the
[1:42:22] truth. The angel of the Lord I told you
[1:42:24] was around in a pillar of fire.
[1:42:26] Quickening power. Let the world testify
[1:42:28] that it's the truth. And and in that in
[1:42:31] that they didn't know what it was.
[1:42:33] Talking about that picture, they didn't
[1:42:34] know it what it was. We knew just look
[1:42:37] this way. And it's our Lord up there.
[1:42:42] He's the one who opened those seals. He
[1:42:44] is those seals. For the whole word of
[1:42:47] God is Christ, and Christ is the seals
[1:42:49] that was open. What is the opening of
[1:42:51] the seals then? It's revealing Christ.
[1:42:55] Another place they took the picture.
[1:42:56] They still don't know uh uh what it's
[1:42:59] about. Here some time ago, everybody's
[1:43:01] saying, "Lookie here. Look, look, this
[1:43:04] looks like this." And them angels wings
[1:43:06] and how they're folded. That's all they
[1:43:08] were looking at is the angels and all of
[1:43:09] these things. See? Amen. And he says one
[1:43:12] day turning it to the right looking.
[1:43:14] There was Jesus Christ just as perfect
[1:43:17] as Hoffman had ever drawn him. It it was
[1:43:20] standing there with a white wig on
[1:43:22] looking back down towards the earth
[1:43:24] showing that he is the supreme
[1:43:26] authority. Can you say amen? Showing
[1:43:29] that he is our
[1:43:31] headship. That's our
[1:43:33] headship. The message. Can you say amen?
[1:43:37] He says see the message uh the heavens
[1:43:40] declare it. The Bible declares it. The
[1:43:42] message declares it all the same. The
[1:43:44] supreme authority with a white wig on.
[1:43:46] You see his black beard under. Many of
[1:43:48] you have seen the picture. We got it
[1:43:50] back there. Turn it to the right. Look
[1:43:51] sideways and look at it. There he is.
[1:43:54] Just as perfect as it if it had been
[1:43:56] photographed of him. They're looking at
[1:43:58] it from the wrong angle. You got to look
[1:44:01] at it in the right angle. And only the
[1:44:03] Lord God can reveal which is the right
[1:44:05] angle. Turn it to your right and look at
[1:44:07] it. There he is just as perfect. Can you
[1:44:11] say amen? Oh, do you love him? Thank God
[1:44:14] for
[1:44:16] revelation. As I
[1:44:19] stated last Wednesday, we're living in
[1:44:21] the age of
[1:44:23] revelation. Amen. And Jesus foretold of
[1:44:26] it. John 16:13 says, "How be it, when
[1:44:29] he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he
[1:44:32] will guide you into all truth, for he
[1:44:34] shall not speak of himself, but
[1:44:35] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:44:37] speak, and he shall show you things to
[1:44:40] come. He shall glorify me, for he shall
[1:44:43] receive of mine, and shall show it unto
[1:44:45] you. And all things that the father hath
[1:44:48] are mine. Therefore said I, he shall
[1:44:50] take of mine and show it unto you. So
[1:44:53] what is it? The spirit of truth is the
[1:44:55] spirit of the word revealing the word
[1:44:59] right
[1:45:00] here. Revealing the unseen to that
[1:45:04] believer.
[1:45:07] That's right. Do you believe it? Yes,
[1:45:09] sir.
[1:45:10] Now notice brother Brandham said we can
[1:45:12] preach the word, explain the word, but
[1:45:14] you have to receive it. You have to
[1:45:17] receive the word. One place he said to
[1:45:20] believe the word is to receive the word.
[1:45:22] So you say, "Well, I believe the word."
[1:45:24] Well, that's that's what you're doing.
[1:45:25] You're receiving the word by believing
[1:45:26] the word. And he said, "Oh, hallelujah.
[1:45:29] That's what sets it a fire, brother.
[1:45:31] When you receive it, the
[1:45:33] revelation something slips out of the
[1:45:35] unseen world yonder comes rolling down
[1:45:37] through a mystical channel somewhere
[1:45:39] into your soul that says, "Now I see
[1:45:42] it."
[1:45:44] Until then, you can't see it.
[1:45:47] But when you receive that word and say,
[1:45:49] "I believe it with all my heart."
[1:45:52] Something from the unseen world comes
[1:45:54] rolling down into that soul
[1:45:58] that opens your eyes to where you can
[1:46:01] see it. Can you say amen? He said your
[1:46:04] eyes brighten, your lips that hung down,
[1:46:06] straighten up and smile. Every muscle in
[1:46:08] your body seems to rejoice. Something's
[1:46:10] going to happen. You don't need to be in
[1:46:12] a prayer line. Then you got it then. Can
[1:46:14] you say amen? So see what is it? The
[1:46:17] spirit of the word reveals the word.
[1:46:19] Then you receive it by believing it. And
[1:46:21] then something comes down into your soul
[1:46:23] and you see it. That's how we see the
[1:46:29] unseen. Oh
[1:46:31] God, think of a people here tonight
[1:46:34] being able to see something that the
[1:46:37] world don't know nothing about.
[1:46:40] They don't understand why we're
[1:46:41] persevering about it. They don't
[1:46:44] understand how we get joy out of it.
[1:46:46] They don't see because they don't see
[1:46:48] what we see. We're looking at something
[1:46:51] that has been opened, been revealed. The
[1:46:54] veil has been taken off, and we're
[1:46:57] looking at the
[1:46:59] unseen. Amen.
[1:47:02] Brother Brandham said, "The thing of it
[1:47:04] is is people fail to see the truth of
[1:47:06] God is because there's too many man-made
[1:47:09] interpretation of God's word."
[1:47:11] So that's why we had to have a prophet
[1:47:13] to come back and bring the word into its
[1:47:16] correctness, correct it all and bring it
[1:47:18] to a perfect word. Can you say amen? Do
[1:47:22] you love the Lord?
[1:47:24] Amen. We could go on, but I I don't want
[1:47:27] to waste this this part of it. So, we'll
[1:47:31] wait until everybody's
[1:47:34] awake. Amen. If the musicians will
[1:47:37] come, bless the name of the Lord.
[1:47:43] looking at the
[1:47:45] unseen. Looking. It's more than just
[1:47:48] going to church. It's more than even
[1:47:50] just hearing a prophet or coming to
[1:47:52] church and
[1:47:53] listening. It's something that God
[1:47:56] does that he opens our eyes of
[1:47:58] understanding. He enlightens it and we
[1:48:02] behold the
[1:48:04] unseen. Oh God, I've asked God just to
[1:48:08] just keep revealing it. No wonder the
[1:48:09] prophet said, "Pray for revelation."
[1:48:11] That's the most important thing in this
[1:48:13] age is revelation. God, give us
[1:48:16] revelation. Amen. I want
[1:48:19] revelation. And God has sent a prophet
[1:48:22] to do that, to make that word correct,
[1:48:25] that if we'd receive that word and just
[1:48:27] believe it and hang our soul on it, no
[1:48:29] matter what comes, what goes,
[1:48:32] whatever, there's something down that
[1:48:34] comes into our soul that lets us see
[1:48:38] what it's all about. I don't know about
[1:48:41] you, but can you see yourself as a son
[1:48:43] and daughter of God? Can you see
[1:48:46] yourself as redeemed? Can you see
[1:48:48] yourself as justified?
[1:48:51] sinless bride, justified, perfect before
[1:48:55] the Lord. Can you see yourself already
[1:48:58] made it in a rapture, in a body change?
[1:49:02] Sure. Amen. It's not just made up. It's
[1:49:05] something that becomes a revelation. And
[1:49:07] remember, that's what the church is
[1:49:09] built upon is
[1:49:10] revelation. And then the gates of hell
[1:49:13] cannot prevail against it. Can you say
[1:49:15] amen? I love the Lord. All right. What
[1:49:19] song?
[1:49:22] Uh oh. Can't you
[1:49:26] see
[1:49:29] why I'm
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:42] happy? Bless the name of the
[1:49:45] Lord. The reveal
[1:49:50] word that was
[1:49:55] spoken by the
[1:49:59] prophet of
[1:50:00] me. Look, let's go up a
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:06] key. Can't you
[1:50:10] see
[1:50:11] why I'm so happy?
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:17] Oh, I've
[1:50:20] accepted the
[1:50:22] word of the
[1:50:25] Lord. Glory to God. The
[1:50:31] revealed
[1:50:33] word that was
[1:50:38] spoken by the
[1:50:41] prophet of
[1:50:44] Malachia 4. Let's go up a
[1:50:48] key. Oh, can't you
[1:50:52] see
[1:50:54] why I'm happy? It's an eternal
[1:50:59] joy. Oh, I've
[1:51:02] accepted the
[1:51:05] word of the
[1:51:06] [Laughter]
[1:51:09] Lord, the
[1:51:13] revealed
[1:51:15] word that was
[1:51:20] spoken by the
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:25] prophet Leo
[1:51:28] for Let's sing this little song. Every
[1:51:32] promise in the book is
[1:51:37] mine. Every chapter, every verse, every
[1:51:42] line. I am trusting in his love
[1:51:47] divine. Every promise in the

[1:51:56] is
[1:51:58] mine. Every chapter, every verse and
[1:52:02] every
[1:52:03] line. I am trusting in his love
[1:52:09] divine. Every promise in the book. Oh,
[1:52:13] sing it again. Oh, every promise in the
[1:52:17] book is mine.
[1:52:20] every chapter, every verse and every
[1:52:24] line. Oh, I am trusting in his word
[1:52:29] divine. Oh, every promise. Do you see
[1:52:32] them promises tonight? Oh, every promise
[1:52:37] in the book is
[1:52:40] mine. Every chapter, every verse, and
[1:52:43] every
[1:52:45] line. Oh, I'm trusting in his love.
[1:52:50] divine every promise in the book. Oh,
[1:52:55] saying it again. Every promise in

[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:09] Blessed be the name of Jesus
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:20] Christ.
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:40] His word cannot lie. It is written in
[1:54:44] the Bible. I believe it till I die. Let
[1:54:48] the mountains be removed. Let him be
[1:54:51] cast into the sea. But God's word will
[1:54:54] live forever throughout eternity. Oh,
[1:54:58] Jesus said it. I believe it. If Abraham
[1:55:02] can believe it, we can believe it. If he
[1:55:05] could see the unseen, we can look to
[1:55:07] that
[1:55:08] unseen. Oh, he saw the promises and it
[1:55:12] become a reality. So shall it be for
[1:55:15] us throughout et Oh, if Jesus said it, I
[1:55:20] believe it. His word cannot lie. It is
[1:55:24] written in the Bible. I believe it till
[1:55:28] I die. Though the mountains be removed
[1:55:31] and cast into the sea, God's word will
[1:55:35] live forever throughout eternity.
[1:55:42] Well, do you love him? Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] Hallelujah. We um let's see, there's
[1:55:49] that song. We are able to go up and take
[1:55:53] the
[1:55:55] country to possess the land from Jordan
[1:55:59] to the sea.
[1:56:01] And though the giants may be there our
[1:56:04] way to
[1:56:06] hinder, God will surely
[1:56:09] grant. Sing it again. Oh, we are able to
[1:56:14] go up and take the
[1:56:16] country to possess the land from Jordan
[1:56:20] to the sea.
[1:56:22] And though the giants may be there our
[1:56:25] way to
[1:56:27] hinder, God will surely grant. One more
[1:56:31] time before we close. Oh, we are able to
[1:56:34] go up. Well, how do you know? Because
[1:56:37] I'm looking at the
[1:56:39] unseen. I see that it's already ours. I
[1:56:42] see the giants have already
[1:56:44] fallen. Oh, our way to hinder. God will
[1:56:49] surely grant the victory. Last lines.
