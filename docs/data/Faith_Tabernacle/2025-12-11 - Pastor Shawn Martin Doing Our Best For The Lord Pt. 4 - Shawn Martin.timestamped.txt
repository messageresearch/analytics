[32:48] He's our savior. He's certainly lovely.
[32:51] Amen. And so glad that we could call him
[32:54] ours. Praise the Lord. Well, it's good
[32:58] to be here. The Lord and able to make it
[33:02] this evening. And um
[33:06] if you have your Bibles, we're going to
[33:08] just go right on into the word. Matthew
[33:11] the 9th chapter.
[33:15] And um uh brother John's surgery went
[33:20] good today. And so we're thankful to the
[33:23] Lord for that and able to go home
[33:27] and um good to have brother Mark and
[33:30] sister Crystal back with us. Amen.
[33:34] Gone over the weekend and brother Terry
[33:37] uh uh decided to stay home tonight due
[33:41] to the weather and I think that was a
[33:44] smart thing. He they drive a long ways
[33:47] and u and so we uh want to just keep
[33:51] them in prayer. Amen. And uh I'm sure
[33:55] they're streaming today and this
[33:58] evening. But uh before we go into the
[34:01] word, may we bow our heads and talk to
[34:05] our Lord. Father,
[34:08] truly you are lovely.
[34:11] And Lord, there's just no words to
[34:13] describe
[34:14] what you are, who you are, and Father,
[34:18] but we certainly make a feeble attempt
[34:24] to let you know just what you mean to
[34:27] us.
[34:28] And Father, we just asking that you
[34:31] would come and you would uh feel at home
[34:35] just to fellowship with us, commune with
[34:37] us. Father, the worship has been done,
[34:42] the songs sung,
[34:45] the music played, but now Lord, may you
[34:48] speak through us, to us, through your
[34:51] word. Anoint me, Lord, just help me to
[34:54] get myself out of the way. And Lord, and
[34:58] may the people get themselves out of the
[35:00] way. And Lord, may just be a
[35:03] supernatural happening tonight. You know
[35:05] the needs that are present, Father. That
[35:08] we may not even know the needs, our own
[35:11] needs, but Lord, you know them. For you
[35:14] know every part about us, Father. I pray
[35:17] that you would meet them tonight, Lord.
[35:20] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[35:25] Praise the Lord. So, uh we want to look
[35:28] uh Matthew the 9th chapter and um
[35:35] uh the 3th
[35:40] verse I guess and uh we've read this
[35:46] a couple services now but says and Jesus
[35:49] went about all the cities and villages
[35:51] teaching in their synagogues and
[35:53] preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[35:57] and healing every sickness and every
[36:00] disease among the people. But when he
[36:02] saw the multitudes, he was moved with
[36:05] compassion on them, because they fainted
[36:08] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[36:11] having no shepherd. Then saith he unto
[36:14] his disciples, "The harvest truly is
[36:17] plenteous, but the laborers are few.
[36:21] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
[36:23] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[36:26] into his harvest.
[36:28] Then if you'll turn to the book of John.
[36:32] Amen. John the 20th
[36:38] chapter.
[36:41] Amen. Now Judy if you could give me some
[36:44] volume in my ear. Deal. um John
[36:49] chapter 20 and um
[36:53] we'll look at verse 21.
[36:59] Says, "Then said Jesus unto them again,
[37:03] peace be unto you, as my father hath
[37:06] sent me, even so send I you." As my
[37:12] father has sent me, even so send I you.
[37:17] Amen. You can have your seats this
[37:19] evening.
[37:20] And um I want to again use the title
[37:26] doing our best for the Lord. And
[37:30] um I think that's all that God requires.
[37:34] And so we realize that
[37:38] it's not human ability that God is
[37:40] after.
[37:41] Um, brother Bram said we got to to
[37:46] master the thought of human ability. We
[37:49] got to get away from that human element,
[37:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And um but yet it's it's human beings
[37:58] that um
[38:01] that God is working for or uh through. I
[38:05] believe that God has sent us as uh
[38:10] laborers in his vineyard.
[38:13] And I like how the prophet said it. He
[38:16] said, "Now he sends us the same way he
[38:20] send the father sent him." Which we just
[38:22] read that. And he said the the the way
[38:26] that the father sent him is that the
[38:29] father went with him even in him. And so
[38:34] this is where Jesus said that the father
[38:38] dwelleth in me and he doeth the works.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; So this is u um how God the the father
[38:49] sent sent Christ
[38:52] and we find that the bible says that
[38:55] Christ was the uh image of the invisible
[38:59] God. Uh the prophet would tell us he was
[39:03] he said it this way he was the visible
[39:06] image of the invisible God.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; So Jesus says he that hath seen me hath
[39:13] seen the father. So we see that God
[39:17] bottled himself up into one man. all
[39:22] that God was in the uh throughout the
[39:26] Old Testament and everything that he had
[39:29] uh revealed himself as, he bottled it
[39:35] all up himself into uh one human being
[39:40] and that was Jesus Christ.
[39:43] And and so uh as the prophet would use
[39:46] the word immorph,
[39:49] God immorphed himself into Jesus Christ
[39:53] and became a man. Yeah,
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Paul would tell us there in uh
[40:00] Philippians 2 and 7, it says that he
[40:04] took upon him the form of a man or form
[40:09] of a servant and was made in the
[40:11] likeness of men. So this is God. God
[40:15] took on the form of a man. Ain't that
[40:19] right?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and this word amorpha
[40:24] uh means that he changed himself.
[40:28] Amen. So the prophet said the only thing
[40:30] that God did when he became a man was he
[40:34] changed his mask.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't change his power. He didn't
[40:40] change his character. He didn't change
[40:43] who he was.
[40:46] um uh it didn't degrade God or make God
[40:51] any less by
[40:54] uh going with Christ and becoming man.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Of course, we know that that um uh Jesus
[41:02] uh is the uh human name of God. Amen.
[41:07] And and so God becoming man, he he
[41:11] changed himself as the prophet said uh
[41:14] from the pillar of fire and he became
[41:18] man.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; You you wouldn't see the pillar of fire
[41:23] uh uh there because it it was all God in
[41:29] in uh as a human being,
[41:32] &gt;&gt; right? But then he changed himself back
[41:35] into spirit form
[41:38] &gt;&gt; uh the pillar of fire for a reason and
[41:42] that was the prophet said that he might
[41:45] dwell in men.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[41:48] &gt;&gt; humans.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; So not just one man Jesus Christ. Amen.
[41:53] But that he would dwell in human beings.
[41:58] And the reason why he would dwell in
[42:01] human beings is to carry on his work.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's what uh um uh God
[42:11] would do. Not everything was fulfilled
[42:14] in Christ in the sense that uh all
[42:18] prophecy now Christ fulfilled all
[42:21] prophecy concerning Messiah for that
[42:23] day. But there's still scripture being
[42:27] fulfilled today that God determined not
[42:31] to do in that body, but he would do it
[42:34] in the body of other men. Amen. the body
[42:39] of men and women, boys and girls. And so
[42:43] the prophet said he returned back in the
[42:46] form of the Holy Spirit to reflect
[42:50] himself through his people to carry on
[42:54] his work, reflecting himself through you
[42:59] to fulfill his promised word in these
[43:02] future days. Aren't you glad for that?
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a part of that. So this
[43:08] is why Jesus would say, "The works that
[43:10] I do shall you do also."
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just me that's going to
[43:16] do the works, but I'm showing you what
[43:18] works, but you're going to do them. The
[43:21] works that I'm showing you, the works
[43:23] that I'm doing, you're going to do them.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Even greater than these shall you do.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so uh uh through through
[43:33] throughout the Bible, yes, God uh had
[43:37] prophesied of Messiah and prophesied of
[43:40] what he would do and what he would
[43:42] become. But he also prophesied uh of a
[43:45] people to come. He prophesied of what he
[43:49] would do. And and and and even in the
[43:52] Old Testament uh speaks of our day and
[43:55] and age in in in many scriptures, but
[44:00] Joel 2:28, "And it shall come to pass
[44:04] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[44:09] upon all flesh." So, it isn't just going
[44:12] to be one man, Jesus Christ, that that
[44:16] has the spirit of God.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now, he God has promised that
[44:22] he would pour out his spirit and and it
[44:26] would be upon men. It'd be upon women.
[44:28] It would be upon uh boys and girls. It
[44:32] would be upon uh white people, black
[44:35] people, uh uh brown people, yellow
[44:39] people, uh uh men of all colors, and of
[44:44] every race. Amen. That he would pour out
[44:47] his spirit up upon Amen. And and so uh
[44:52] this was a prophecy that was laying
[44:55] there. Amen. And and so when Jesus was
[44:59] saying, "As the father sent me, so I
[45:01] send out send you."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; He he wasn't speaking out of turn, but
[45:06] it was actually uh in in in accordance
[45:09] to the prophecies that had been laying
[45:12] there.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he knew there would come a
[45:15] time that the spirit of God would that
[45:18] was in him would now come upon men and
[45:22] women.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it wouldn't just make it
[45:26] wouldn't make them church members. It it
[45:28] it it wouldn't be just to learn about
[45:31] the the word and but it would put them
[45:34] into action. It would put them in as
[45:37] laborers and and in the in the the
[45:40] ministry
[45:41] &gt;&gt; and and so uh so here uh the the Bible
[45:46] says I'll pour out of my spirit upon all
[45:49] flesh. Now uh the prophet says when it
[45:52] says here that he emptied himself or
[45:55] poured out. Now uh we would think like
[45:59] this that he vomit up the English word
[46:03] of empty or pour out from him. Um
[46:08] something that went out of him. So you
[46:11] know this cup got water and and to pour
[46:13] it it it it would be pouring coming out
[46:16] of of of the cup. Amen. That that's the
[46:20] way we would say pour out.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; You know, something went out of him that
[46:26] was different from him. But the word
[46:29] kenos in the Greek does not mean that he
[46:31] vomit up or his arm went off or his eye
[46:35] went out another person. But it it means
[46:39] that he changed himself.
[46:42] I pour out my spirit. Not something
[46:44] different from him. It's just that he
[46:48] changes himself by pouring himself into
[46:53] the human being. Amen. Into another
[46:56] mask, into another form. Not another
[46:59] person went out of him called the Holy
[47:01] Spirit. But it was he himself that he
[47:05] promised to pour into the people.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? And so we we find he himself
[47:15] poured himself into the people. Christ,
[47:19] everybody say Christ in you.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; That's that's what it is. That's what
[47:24] that means. Christ in you is that God
[47:27] poured himself into you. not not just
[47:31] another something of God or uh uh a
[47:35] little part of God or whatever, but he
[47:38] poured himself into you. And he says,
[47:42] see how beautiful, how wonderful to
[47:44] think God pouring himself into the human
[47:48] being into the believer. It was part of
[47:52] his drama to do so. Ain't that right? So
[47:56] then we we can look if if the same God
[48:01] that that came into that body of Jesus
[48:05] Christ and then then and that God dwells
[48:10] in us today. Then we can look and at at
[48:14] the scriptures and and look at his
[48:17] ministry, look at his works, look at
[48:20] what he was and see a comparison
[48:25] of of that supernatural God living in
[48:30] us. So it's just like in Luke 4:18,
[48:35] Jesus tells us why he was sent.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; He was sent with a purpose. uh uh for a
[48:43] purpose and that was he said the spirit
[48:45] of the lord is upon me because he hath
[48:48] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[48:51] poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[48:55] brokenhearted
[48:57] to preach deliverance to the captives
[48:59] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[49:02] set at liberty them that are bruised to
[49:05] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[49:09] Amen. So he knew why he was anointed. He
[49:12] knew why he was sent. Amen. This is why
[49:16] not not just to build a not to build a
[49:18] program, but but to set at liberty them
[49:21] that are bruised.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; To preach the gospel to them that are
[49:26] poor,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; to open the blinded eyes. Ain't that
[49:29] right?
[49:29] &gt;&gt; So, not only was he sent, but he was
[49:33] anointed. The spirit of the Lord hath
[49:35] anointed me. Ain't that right? Acts
[49:38] 10:38 it says how God anointed Jesus of
[49:42] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[49:46] power. Everybody say, "And with power."
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Who went about doing good, healing all
[49:52] that were oppressed of the devil. For
[49:55] God was with him.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; That's how God sent him. God sent him by
[50:00] going with him and being in him. And he
[50:04] was anointed of God. And he w he healed
[50:08] the sick. He raised the dead. Amen.
[50:10] Because God was with him.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so his ministry wasn't a
[50:17] natural ministry. Amen. But it was a
[50:20] supernatural ministry. Even Nicodemus
[50:23] came to Jesus by night. Amen. and and
[50:26] and said, "Rabbi, we know that thou art
[50:29] a teacher from God, for no man can do
[50:32] these miracles that thou doest except
[50:35] God be with him."
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[50:39] &gt;&gt; So So even the the religious teachers
[50:42] knew the the the religious church, they
[50:45] knew that that Jesus was different from
[50:49] the rest.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And they knew beyond a shadow of a doubt
[50:54] that God was with them. They wouldn't
[50:55] admit it. Amen. That's why he would he
[50:58] went to him at night and he would tell
[51:00] him these things. Amen. He was telling
[51:02] him exactly what they were all talking
[51:04] about. Amen. At at the table, you know,
[51:06] when the ministers all met, they were
[51:08] talking about how God was with that man
[51:11] and and all that and they hated him for
[51:12] it. Amen. Because he wasn't part of
[51:15] their organization. But Nicodemus was
[51:18] admitting it that there's something
[51:20] different about you. Amen. Other
[51:22] preachers have come. Other men have
[51:24] come. But something's different about
[51:26] you. And and and we have to come to this
[51:28] conclusion, amen, that that no man can
[51:31] do these things except God be with him.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; See, so God would show, Amen. how he
[51:37] sent Jesus Christ.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And and Christ was anointed with the
[51:42] Holy Ghost and with power. Ain't that
[51:46] right? So the Holy Ghost and power go
[51:49] hand in hand. Amen. That's right. This
[51:52] is why Jesus said in Acts 18, "And you
[51:55] shall receive power after that the holy
[51:59] uh the Holy Ghost has come upon you."
[52:02] You shall receive power, not just
[52:05] receive the Holy Ghost and and and
[52:07] waiting for something else to happen.
[52:09] You shall receive power after that the
[52:12] Holy Ghost has come upon you. So you
[52:16] cannot have the Holy Ghost and not be
[52:18] anointed and not have power. Amen. See,
[52:22] so if you've got the Holy Ghost here
[52:24] tonight, you have the power of God.
[52:27] Amen. The same power that was in Christ,
[52:30] you have and you're anointed just as
[52:32] with the anointing that he was anointed
[52:35] with.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Pentecostals have they tend
[52:40] to uh uh associate
[52:43] um the power of God with dancing and
[52:46] with shouting and running over the you
[52:49] know running around the church and and
[52:52] uh all these things and that's fine. But
[52:54] the prophet tells us that's not the
[52:56] power of God.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; That's the blessings of God.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; And and God promised that he would put
[53:02] for his blessings upon the just and the
[53:05] unjust. Amen. and and so uh you see
[53:08] people getting emotions and and they
[53:10] shout and they dance and and all that
[53:13] but but but that's not that's not the
[53:15] power of God. Brother Bram said you can
[53:16] do all of that and still not have enough
[53:19] faith to heal a toothache. See, so
[53:22] that's just blessings of God. And he
[53:24] says there there's a lot of difference
[53:26] between blessings and power. God makes
[53:30] his blessings upon the the righteous and
[53:34] unrighteous. See, but the blessings is
[53:37] not what uh is not the thing that breaks
[53:40] the power of Satan.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus didn't just go running all
[53:45] over around, you know, uh the and and
[53:48] and the blind man was saw. Amen. He
[53:52] didn't run around the casket and the and
[53:54] and and the dead man rose. Amen. Uh
[53:58] raised from the dead. Amen. There was
[54:01] something about him. He was anointed.
[54:04] Amen. With the spirit of God and with
[54:07] power.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Many people, I've seen
[54:12] it throughout time. Amen. Many people,
[54:15] Amen. They dance, they shout, and they
[54:18] they run around and and uh I think
[54:20] Brother Bram even called it, you know,
[54:22] bubble dancing. And and and and they do
[54:25] the cartwheels, and they're really into
[54:26] it, you know. They're really feeling
[54:28] something about this, you know, and and
[54:31] we we've seen it, you know, rolling on
[54:33] the floor and and and seen them shaking
[54:36] on the floor. And nothing against those
[54:38] things. Amen. Uh uh but but just trying
[54:41] to tell us, Amen. That's not the power
[54:44] of God. I've seen him do that. And yet
[54:47] still, when it's all said and done,
[54:50] Amen. Many people are still bound by
[54:52] oppression and uh by pornography and and
[54:55] and bound by by malice and hate and
[54:59] bitterness and and and envy and and all
[55:02] of these things after all of that's
[55:04] done. I've seen it, you know, uh
[55:06] remember preaching, you know, at a a
[55:08] meeting and and pastor was really big on
[55:11] people dancing and shouting and so so uh
[55:15] uh uh you know the service probably
[55:18] wasn't going as the way he wanted it at
[55:20] the end. And so he he just took the mic
[55:22] from me. Amen. He says now now because
[55:26] people started lining up for prayer and
[55:28] starting to pray for people and he he
[55:30] finally took it from me. He said,
[55:31] "Brother, that's not how we do things
[55:33] around here, you know." And he says uh
[55:35] he says the way we do it is is I want
[55:38] all the sisters over here, all the
[55:39] brothers over here. And and so you know
[55:42] he starts quoting you know let
[55:43] everything that hath breath praise the
[55:45] Lord and praise him on the drums. Praise
[55:47] him on this, praise him on that. So, I
[55:49] just kind of wandered off over there on
[55:51] the side there and and and uh uh before
[55:54] you know it, he was getting the crowd,
[55:56] the people going and finally they
[55:58] started breaking out and the fast song
[56:00] and and uh everybody was dancing and
[56:03] shouting and so you know, we were over
[56:05] there clapping us guys. It's mainly the
[56:08] sisters that were that were doing the
[56:11] shouting and screaming and uh you know,
[56:14] so finally, you know, the pastor came
[56:15] over and said, "You okay, little
[56:16] brother?" I said, "Yes, sir. I'm I'm
[56:18] doing just fine. He said, "Well, I just
[56:20] want you to know the these people that
[56:22] are dancing got the Holy Ghost. They're
[56:24] really into it." I said, "Well, great.
[56:26] That's fine." I said, "I have no
[56:28] problem. I mean, that's your church, you
[56:30] know, you know." Well, all that time
[56:32] while that was happening, the piano
[56:34] player and one of these girls that was
[56:36] out there dancing was having an affair.
[56:38] And it wasn't but a week later that she
[56:41] ended up pregnant. and and uh well it's
[56:45] it split the church. Uh uh so you can
[56:49] dance and you can shout and you can all
[56:51] that stuff but it doesn't mean your
[56:53] life's changed. See that that's just
[56:55] blessings. Ain't that right? But what
[56:58] we're talking about is an anointing.
[57:00] Jesus was anointed. He was sent anointed
[57:04] with the Holy Ghost and with power to
[57:07] break the power of Satan.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. The blind
[57:13] received their sight. The prostitutes
[57:15] were delivered. Amen. The condemned were
[57:18] set free. The dead were raised. And the
[57:21] blind, amen, uh saw, the lame walked.
[57:25] And first John 3:8, it says, "For this
[57:28] purpose the son of God was manifested,
[57:30] that he might destroy the works of the
[57:34] devil."
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? That's why he
[57:38] was sent. That's why he was manifest.
[57:40] that he might destroy the works of the
[57:43] devil.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; The devil could have heyday in the
[57:49] churches of that day, but he couldn't
[57:51] have heyday with him.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just the truth.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so this wasn't just a
[57:59] manifestation of a man. Right.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; This wasn't just human human flesh,
[58:05] human works being exalted and and and
[58:08] and uh uh manifested or whatever. Amen.
[58:12] But Paul says without controversy, great
[58:15] is the mystery of godliness, God was
[58:19] manifest in the flesh.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; God was manifested. Can you say amen?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; This power, this anointing that Jesus
[58:27] had upon him, it was God in him.
[58:32] God anointed him. God was manifested.
[58:36] God was tabernacling in that body.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's how God sent
[58:41] him. God went with him.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, so the denominations
[58:48] of that day were trying to do the work
[58:50] of God. Amen. Through human effort.
[58:54] Amen. That's right. See, and God had
[58:56] nothing to do with what they were doing.
[58:59] All their programs, God had nothing to
[59:01] do with it. All their charities, God had
[59:04] nothing to do with it. Everything that
[59:06] they were doing, God had nothing to do
[59:07] with it. God was in a body. Amen.
[59:11] Manifesting himself doing the works of
[59:14] God.
[59:17] The churches of that day, they were a uh
[59:20] uh the body of an organization.
[59:23] Amen. But Christ was the body of God.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? and the fullness of
[59:30] the Godhead dwelt bodily in him. So then
[59:36] what about the church today? As the
[59:38] father sent me, so shall I send you. I
[59:42] send you the same way the father sent
[59:44] me. Amen. Well, churches, you know, that
[59:48] are part of the harlot system, we know
[59:50] that they are nothing but a habitation
[59:53] of devils.
[59:55] It's true that that's what the Bible
[59:57] says. It's just a habitation of unclean
[1:00:00] things, habitation of devils, things
[1:00:03] like that. But the church of the living
[1:00:06] God is the body of the living God.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Is the body of Jesus Christ? Ain't that
[1:00:16] right?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] Paul says about the church, it's the
[1:00:21] fullness of him that dwelleth all in
[1:00:24] all, that fleth all in all. So today
[1:00:28] Christ has come to his full
[1:00:32] manifestation
[1:00:33] in his body today.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now how is this possible? Well, it
[1:00:40] was made possible through the work of of
[1:00:43] of redemption. Amen. Christ's work of
[1:00:46] redemption. When Christ came, he came
[1:00:49] through a virgin. And the prophet said
[1:00:52] God made his promise sure. He stuck with
[1:00:55] his word. every word of it had to be. So
[1:00:59] he made it perfect because he was God
[1:01:02] and couldn't do nothing else. He had to
[1:01:04] stay with it. But he says, notice the
[1:01:07] next thing he had to do. The church had
[1:01:11] to be anointed and sent out. So Christ
[1:01:14] life, he he while he was walking the
[1:01:17] earth, he was doing the works of God. He
[1:01:20] was showing the works of God. Prophet
[1:01:23] says he was manifested to show God,
[1:01:26] amen, to the people. So the people saw
[1:01:29] God in Christ. They saw that he was
[1:01:32] anointed to do what he was doing. He He
[1:01:34] had a supernatural ministry, but at the
[1:01:37] same time, he was making way for a
[1:01:41] church to be sent out. He knew, amen,
[1:01:44] that through this work of redemption
[1:01:47] that he would do, there would be a
[1:01:49] people that he would send out, amen,
[1:01:52] with himself in them.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; So, he had to to to the church had to be
[1:02:00] anointed and sent out.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before he could keep his promise,
[1:02:04] he had to make a way for this church to
[1:02:07] be anointed. And the church after
[1:02:09] walking with Jesus and knowing Jesus and
[1:02:12] had received power to heal the sick and
[1:02:15] do everything, all these ups and downs
[1:02:18] and things they had had, and yet walked
[1:02:20] with Jesus, he knew that he had to make
[1:02:23] a way to send his church out anointed.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; So, so again, he sends us the same way
[1:02:32] the father sent him. Amen. Now, think of
[1:02:36] it. Paul after Christ's ascension and
[1:02:39] and and
[1:02:41] uh uh these things 2 Corinthians 5:16
[1:02:47] says, "Henceforth
[1:02:49] uh uh no uh wherefore henceforth know we
[1:02:52] no man after the flesh. Though we have
[1:02:55] known Christ after the flesh, yet now
[1:02:59] henceforth know we him no more."
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; We don't know him after the flesh. Yeah.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Christ is not to be known in an
[1:03:09] intellectual way.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Christ isn't to be made known by natural
[1:03:14] understanding.
[1:03:16] Amen. But he is to be known by spiritual
[1:03:20] revelation.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? So the prophet
[1:03:24] said, "This same one who was known as
[1:03:26] Jesus after the flesh went back to the
[1:03:29] pillar of fire, but he promised he would
[1:03:32] come again and dwell amongst his people
[1:03:35] by the spirit. And on the day of
[1:03:38] Pentecost, that pillar of fire came
[1:03:40] down, and it separated itself in tongues
[1:03:43] of fire upon each one of them." See,
[1:03:47] what was God doing? He was separating
[1:03:50] himself into the church. giving all
[1:03:53] those men and women a part of himself.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't know him after the flesh.
[1:04:02] I can't point you to a the the corporal
[1:04:06] physical body of Jesus Christ today that
[1:04:09] once walked the earth, but we are not to
[1:04:12] know him after that.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, prophet says now we know him
[1:04:18] after the power of his resurrection.
[1:04:22] Can you say amen?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know him now after the power of
[1:04:27] his resurrection. How do we know?
[1:04:30] Because his life that was in that body
[1:04:33] is now in us as the church of the living
[1:04:36] God. That's how I know of Christ. Amen.
[1:04:39] That's how I know him. Amen. See, so
[1:04:43] Paul would say go on in in 2 Corinthians
[1:04:46] 5:1 17, "Therefore, if any man be in
[1:04:50] Christ, he is a new creature. Old things
[1:04:54] are passed away. Behold, all things are
[1:04:56] become new." A ain't that right? Amen.
[1:04:59] I'm not looking at a at a sinner smoking
[1:05:02] cigarettes and doing drugs and alcohol
[1:05:04] and living in adultery and and and
[1:05:07] living as a sinner. That's not how
[1:05:09] Christ is made known. that Christ has
[1:05:12] now come and saved a people, redeemed
[1:05:15] them, filled them with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:18] and has come now. Amen. And that person
[1:05:20] has been changed. That person has been
[1:05:24] quickened. Can you say amen? Amen. We
[1:05:27] what we once done, we don't do them
[1:05:30] anymore. Amen. The things we once
[1:05:32] enjoyed, we don't enjoy them anymore.
[1:05:35] The things we once desired, we don't
[1:05:38] desire to do them anymore. Why? We
[1:05:41] become a new creature.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Christ is now got a body that he can
[1:05:47] make himself known in.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Old things are passed
[1:05:55] away. Behold, all things are become new,
[1:05:58] and all things are of God. Notice, who
[1:06:01] hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:06:04] Christ, and hath given to us
[1:06:08] the ministry of reconciliation.
[1:06:11] Think of that. To which that God was in
[1:06:14] Christ, reconciling the world to
[1:06:16] himself, not imputing their trespasses
[1:06:18] unto them, and hath committed unto us
[1:06:21] the word of reconciliation. Now then, we
[1:06:25] are ambassadors for Christ. Yeah,
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; we speak for Christ.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; We represent Christ.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Our move is of Christ.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Our actions is of Christ.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Our motivation is of Christ. Everything
[1:06:41] Christ now is being made known through
[1:06:44] us. For we are ambassadors.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; His ambassadors.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; So now then, we are ambassadors for
[1:06:52] Christ. As though God did beseech you by
[1:06:54] us. We pray you in Christstead.
[1:06:58] Why? Because we're standing in
[1:07:00] Christstead.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; We are standing in Christstead,
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That that's that's that's
[1:07:09] sobering to think that I can't point my
[1:07:12] children. I can't point the church. You
[1:07:15] can't point anybody to a physical
[1:07:18] physical uh uh uh uh uh body of Christ
[1:07:22] that he was once 2,000 years ago. But
[1:07:25] they don't need that. I'm his body.
[1:07:28] You're his body. We are the ambassadors
[1:07:31] for Christ. We are the representative of
[1:07:35] Christ.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Then how should we act that way? Right?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; So
[1:07:45] we read the book of Acts and see what
[1:07:48] the church did just after it was
[1:07:51] established on the day of Pentecost.
[1:07:55] And God come into them, poured himself
[1:07:58] into them and and that was just that was
[1:08:01] just an infant stage of the church. That
[1:08:05] was the church in seed form. What they
[1:08:07] done on the days in the days of acts was
[1:08:10] just done in infant stage.
[1:08:14] But instead of growing
[1:08:17] into a complete mature seed
[1:08:22] uh ripening
[1:08:24] uh we find that the seed had to go into
[1:08:26] the ground and die.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:30] Now the prophet has talked about church
[1:08:32] ages, the seals and
[1:08:36] and the different things. But in the
[1:08:38] feast of the trumpet uh trumpets in in
[1:08:41] 64,
[1:08:42] he tells us that for about 2,000 years
[1:08:45] now, the Holy Spirit has been bound
[1:08:50] up by these denominational rivers, these
[1:08:53] demons.
[1:08:55] The demon powers have kept the Holy
[1:08:59] Spirit bound up
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; right
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; for nearly 2,000 years
[1:09:05] because they've added to the word they
[1:09:08] taken away from the word
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; till that even the prophet says in the
[1:09:13] dark ages the word was almost entirely
[1:09:17] lost to the people. People didn't even
[1:09:21] know what the word said.
[1:09:24] And it was just enough light, the
[1:09:26] prophet says down through those ages
[1:09:28] just to know, you know, to repent or
[1:09:31] that, you know, that uh uh just just uh
[1:09:34] enough light for for just a little bit
[1:09:37] of a thing. But in this age, God
[1:09:41] promised
[1:09:43] to send a prophet of Malachi 4
[1:09:47] to restore. Yeah.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Turn our hearts back to the word.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Take us back. Restore the word back unto
[1:09:57] us.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Prophet said it that that's the ministry
[1:10:03] of Elijah was to restore the word.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Bring back that word.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Every all and that was even the seventh
[1:10:11] angel when he begins to sound the
[1:10:13] mystery of God should be finished. all
[1:10:15] those loose ends and people probing at
[1:10:18] this and men probing at that. Had a lot
[1:10:20] of scholars and had a lot of literature
[1:10:23] written about the word and and all of
[1:10:25] these things and all that learning and
[1:10:28] all that knowledge and and and fine
[1:10:31] words and educated words that they used
[1:10:34] and definitions and all of those things.
[1:10:37] It was only men probing.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Probing at the word.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; We needed a prophet. God said it would
[1:10:45] be a prophet that would come and restore
[1:10:49] prophet Elijah. And the prophet says
[1:10:52] now, and it's because of his ministry,
[1:10:55] we we have no doubt that he has come. I
[1:10:58] truly believe that brother Brandham's
[1:11:00] ministry was that that of Malachi 4 that
[1:11:03] was promised.
[1:11:05] See, and today the prophet says we have
[1:11:08] today by God's help the perfect
[1:11:11] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:11:16] vindication.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Well, what what what does that have to
[1:11:22] do with what we're talking about? Well,
[1:11:26] the prophet said this, with the
[1:11:28] restoration of the word comes the
[1:11:31] restoration of power.
[1:11:34] Right.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; With the restoration of the word comes a
[1:11:38] bride into form. With the restoration of
[1:11:42] the word comes a church, a mighty church
[1:11:46] that they become the super race. They
[1:11:49] become an invincible army.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now
[1:11:56] we know that God had visited Abraham
[1:12:00] uh in the form of a of a body a man
[1:12:06] called Melchz Melzdc.
[1:12:10] Abraham said it was God and it was God.
[1:12:16] It's amazing how a prophet
[1:12:20] he tells us that when God appeared in a
[1:12:23] form of a man to me uh to Abraham that
[1:12:27] elected seed,
[1:12:30] God had this age in mind
[1:12:34] of he was doing that way before Christ
[1:12:36] even come to the earth and was born of a
[1:12:39] virgin.
[1:12:41] God appeared in a as a man. He ate the
[1:12:46] food. He drank the the drink
[1:12:50] that Abraham prepared.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He had dust on his feet, his clothes,
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; as a man.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; And yet God looking into this day,
[1:13:02] showing by that what he would do. The
[1:13:05] prophet said, "See Lord, the Lord God
[1:13:07] Elohim was standing there in human
[1:13:10] flesh, showing that he would so anoint
[1:13:15] his church in this last day that it
[1:13:19] would be God working in human flesh
[1:13:24] again."
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So God had his had us in mind. I I think
[1:13:32] that's just wonderful.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:34] See now because of the message the Holy
[1:13:39] Spirit has been loosed
[1:13:43] on
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; been loosed back into the church again
[1:13:46] by this evening time message.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Prophet says it
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:13:55] in the evening time.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Another place the prophet
[1:13:59] said the last thing that the church is
[1:14:01] going to see is Christ manifested in his
[1:14:05] power in fullness in his church just
[1:14:10] before the fire falls.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Now church that's happening now.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Don't don't look at that happening in in
[1:14:17] the wild blue yonder. It's happening
[1:14:19] now.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; His ministry showed that Christ is here.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; He even said it. He said, "My ministry
[1:14:25] is to declare he is here."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; He's here where? In his church.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We saw that fullness.
[1:14:35] Amen. We saw the revealing of the son of
[1:14:38] man to show us it wasn't just a gam. It
[1:14:41] wasn't just some feeling. It was he
[1:14:44] himself
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; has come in the church to anoint the
[1:14:50] church.
[1:14:52] Can you say amen?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Prophet said the pillar of fire has come
[1:14:56] now to anoint sons of man, sons
[1:15:01] to bring back a ministry just exactly
[1:15:04] like he said it would be in order for
[1:15:06] the head and the rest of the body to
[1:15:08] connect together.
[1:15:10] See, so again, when when Christ was on
[1:15:13] the earth, the entire fullness of the
[1:15:15] godhead bodily rested in him. Prophet
[1:15:19] said, "Now it's God in men,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; God in women, boys and girls. God, the
[1:15:27] fullness of God in the Godhead bodily in
[1:15:31] his entire church."
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Manifesting himself, fulfilling his
[1:15:39] word.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:15:44] Brother Brandham in his prayer
[1:15:48] he said, "As the wise man saw the three
[1:15:51] stars line up to be one."
[1:15:56] And as we see today, Lord, the three
[1:15:59] attributes of God, Father, Son, Holy
[1:16:02] Spirit has finally come into the
[1:16:05] channel.
[1:16:07] We know they are one.
[1:16:10] We see all these great signs upon the
[1:16:13] earth that's appearing and the
[1:16:15] identification of the son of God dealing
[1:16:17] in the flesh of his church to carry on
[1:16:22] his work. Can you say amen?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; God has got a people, got a church in
[1:16:30] this age
[1:16:32] that he can show himself, manifest
[1:16:35] himself upon the earth.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:40] that we don't have to take them
[1:16:42] somewhere to see God.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Everything that God is has been poured
[1:16:51] into you.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; The church.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Prophet said if he is with the church,
[1:17:00] he promised to work through the church
[1:17:02] the same way that God worked through
[1:17:04] him, the body of Jesus. that God would
[1:17:07] work through the church by the same
[1:17:09] spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:12] So the mystery of God is being made
[1:17:14] known to the church. How that God was in
[1:17:18] Christ reconciling himself to the world.
[1:17:22] The mystery is being made known that God
[1:17:24] was in Christ reconciling himself to the
[1:17:27] world. How that he and the father were
[1:17:30] one.
[1:17:31] How that the great mysteries of the
[1:17:33] fulfilling of God taking and bringing
[1:17:36] him bringing himself
[1:17:39] manifested in the age of human beings
[1:17:42] and in the stream of human beings and in
[1:17:46] the company of human beings to make his
[1:17:50] word manifested in the day in the
[1:17:53] eastern rising of the sun and to do the
[1:17:55] same thing as the sun sets in the west
[1:17:58] to make himself manifested in a bride
[1:18:02] church, the word made manifest.
[1:18:06] That's who we are.
[1:18:09] I think that's that's that's incredible.
[1:18:12] I think God that God would make that
[1:18:15] known to us in this age.
[1:18:18] Now,
[1:18:20] not to keep you much longer, but we know
[1:18:24] that spirits are real.
[1:18:28] Our enemy is real. And Satan is fighting
[1:18:32] on every hand.
[1:18:36] We are, as the prophet said, we're we're
[1:18:38] we're we're
[1:18:40] crossing, I believe how he said it,
[1:18:42] sailing uh over waters.
[1:18:46] And again, we're not wrestling against
[1:18:49] flesh and blood,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; The weapons of our warfare are not
[1:18:54] carnal.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; We're not out there picketing. We're not
[1:18:58] out there, you know, with guns and
[1:19:00] bazookas and, you know, trying to defeat
[1:19:03] a natural enemy. Our enemy is is not
[1:19:07] natural.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It it's a spiritual warfare.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; It's demonic. It's and and and you know
[1:19:15] the prophet said you know the the our
[1:19:18] denominations and our theology and our
[1:19:20] training of schools and seminary it has
[1:19:23] not got us equipped to meet the enemy.
[1:19:28] The church the natural church is not
[1:19:31] equipped to meet the enemy. Yeah,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; their programs is not enough to meet the
[1:19:39] enemy with their professional choirs and
[1:19:42] their trained uh uh uh ministers and and
[1:19:45] and all their psychology and it's not
[1:19:48] enough to meet the enemy with.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Let's see now
[1:19:57] what what what tries to hinder you as
[1:20:01] you fulfill your purpose in in what God
[1:20:04] has called you to do? What what is it
[1:20:06] that tries to hinder you to do that?
[1:20:09] Satan
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Satan tries to hinder every one of us.
[1:20:14] Right. It it just is.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; What tries to discourage you from
[1:20:18] pressing on with God?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; It's it's the enemy. Yeah.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Who who tries to convince you that
[1:20:26] you're you're worthless and that God
[1:20:28] doesn't love you and and that there's no
[1:20:32] use to even trying. It's the enemy.
[1:20:38] what what what tries to get us to to
[1:20:41] look at one another
[1:20:43] and and you know sometimes you know uh
[1:20:48] maybe Satan comes in in in through the
[1:20:51] tries to disrupt the family parents can
[1:20:54] look at the children say man I don't
[1:20:56] know what to do with that guy I don't
[1:20:58] know what to do with her you know she's
[1:21:00] just a grouch and she's just a
[1:21:02] rebellious ding-dong and you know I
[1:21:06] don't
[1:21:07] and and parent, you know, children can
[1:21:09] look at the parents and man, they're
[1:21:11] idiots, you know, they they don't love
[1:21:14] us, they don't this, and they don't
[1:21:15] that, and they just, you know, and and
[1:21:18] and and and all of a sudden there's a
[1:21:20] war affair. There's a struggle there.
[1:21:22] There's something going on. Maybe it's
[1:21:24] the husband with the wife, wife with the
[1:21:26] husband, and all these say, and all it
[1:21:28] is is a spirit.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's right.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Now, it's Satan that tries to get us,
[1:21:42] get you, get me to listen to him and to
[1:21:45] obey him.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; It's Satan that tries to get us to fall
[1:21:51] in the line with the natural setting,
[1:21:54] the natural pattern of humanity.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; See, it's a spirit that we're fighting.
[1:22:04] It's not flesh and blood. It's a spirit.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; As parents, we must realize this.
[1:22:15] And you know,
[1:22:18] the Lord just dealing with me this
[1:22:21] morning about it, how that Satan will
[1:22:24] move and cause a commotion within the
[1:22:27] home to get us to respond in a negative
[1:22:29] way.
[1:22:31] And we may look at it, well that's my
[1:22:34] child and they shouldn't do that or
[1:22:38] that's, you know, my wife or my husband
[1:22:40] or whatever. They shouldn't. But but
[1:22:43] what we've got to understand, it's more
[1:22:45] than that.
[1:22:47] It's a spirit
[1:22:50] that is trying to work and trying to
[1:22:53] move and trying to it it happens in a
[1:22:56] church.
[1:22:58] It happens in a marriage. It happens
[1:23:00] anywhere.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; To get us to respond in a negative way.
[1:23:09] Well, what's he doing? What What's he
[1:23:11] trying to do? He's trying to upset God's
[1:23:13] program. Isn't that what Satan always
[1:23:15] wants to do? Is upset God's program.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He wants us to get out of God's will.
[1:23:22] Ain't that right?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. He did that to
[1:23:25] Jesus. Jesus had to fight him on every
[1:23:29] in every hand had to meet him every time
[1:23:31] Jesus is doing the will of God. Look
[1:23:32] look look look when Jesus got in the
[1:23:35] ship.
[1:23:36] Uh uh Matthew 8 and 23 says and when and
[1:23:41] when he was entered into the a ship his
[1:23:44] disciples followed him. He entered into
[1:23:47] a ship and his disciples followed him.
[1:23:50] Well why did he get in that boat in the
[1:23:52] first place? He was going somewhere. to
[1:23:56] do the will of God.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; I was listening to brother Brandham in
[1:24:01] that um
[1:24:03] the maniac of Geria.
[1:24:06] That's where he was headed. He was
[1:24:07] headed to Geria.
[1:24:09] He said the reason why he was headed
[1:24:10] there, there was one soul that was
[1:24:14] calling for him.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Not too many souls are calling for him
[1:24:18] today, but there was one soul
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; out of that whole city of Gileia or
[1:24:22] nation. I don't know what it was. city
[1:24:24] or nation, one soul that was calling for
[1:24:27] him. And he got in that ship to go to
[1:24:31] that one soul.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; That one soul was in need. Right.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; He was not in need for water. He was not
[1:24:38] in need for money. He was not in need
[1:24:41] for a car or a house. He was not in need
[1:24:44] for materialistic things. He was not
[1:24:47] even in need for a good buddy pal.
[1:24:50] He was in need for somebody to release
[1:24:54] him from the devil.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He was in need for somebody, a man, that
[1:25:01] could look at that spirit that had him
[1:25:04] bound and command that spirit to leave
[1:25:07] him.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Church couldn't do it.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Religions of that day couldn't do it.
[1:25:14] But there was one man
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; that was sent from God.
[1:25:18] He was anointed of God. He was filled
[1:25:21] with God. The fullness of God was in
[1:25:23] him. He was going to meet that
[1:25:25] challenge.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And notice in the 24th verse, and
[1:25:31] behold, there arose a great tempest in
[1:25:35] the sea,
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; in so much that the ship was covered
[1:25:38] with waves, but he was asleep. Now, so
[1:25:43] in other words, the ship was sinking.
[1:25:47] The fisherman Peter was a great
[1:25:49] fisherman. A lot of them were good
[1:25:52] fishermanmen and they they you know
[1:25:54] brother Brandham describes it how that
[1:25:57] wind started picking up the wave start
[1:25:58] picking up and oh Peter and them say ah
[1:26:01] don't worry about that we've done this
[1:26:03] before we can do it again. And they were
[1:26:06] relying upon their human ability.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; They were relying upon their human
[1:26:11] experience. Ah don't wake him up. We got
[1:26:15] this. we'll get him on the other side.
[1:26:17] But what they didn't realize was the
[1:26:19] enemy, Satan had got in them winds.
[1:26:22] Satan had gotten in them waves. Satan
[1:26:24] was determined to stop that ministry of
[1:26:27] Christ from going over there and and
[1:26:30] delivering that man. And Satan was
[1:26:32] saying, "We'll drown him. We got him in
[1:26:34] the middle of this thing. We're going to
[1:26:35] drown him." Amen. And that disciples
[1:26:38] realized that the it was beyond their
[1:26:40] human ability. They couldn't do it. the
[1:26:42] ship was seeking and they had to wake
[1:26:45] him up.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; So the waves, the winds and all that
[1:26:52] rising and the hurricane or whatever was
[1:26:54] happening, it wasn't by coincidence.
[1:26:57] This wasn't just a happen chance of
[1:26:58] nature.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; The enemy was trying to hinder the work.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; But Jesus wasn't scared. Satan knew he
[1:27:09] was coming and Jesus wasn't scared.
[1:27:11] Instead,
[1:27:13] instead he was ready.
[1:27:16] He was ready to meet Satan.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He was ready to meet his enemy. He
[1:27:20] didn't fall apart. He didn't say, "Oh,
[1:27:21] you disciples, why didn't you tell me
[1:27:24] these things would happen?"
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; What's going on? I thought you knew what
[1:27:30] to do.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; No. Jesus recognized the enemy
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; and he got on that bow of the ship as
[1:27:37] that winds was a rocking and the the
[1:27:39] waves going every which way and he says
[1:27:42] peace be still
[1:27:46] and the winds calmed.
[1:27:49] Can you say amen?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; A man anointed.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; A man sent from God. A man who was the
[1:27:58] creator. A man had now stood on that
[1:28:02] boat and by the words something that no
[1:28:06] human being could ever do but God was
[1:28:09] with him. This was a man. Amen. That was
[1:28:12] there to show God. Can you say amen?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said when you are sent
[1:28:18] of God, you're ready to meet the enemy.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Don't fall apart. You're ready to meet
[1:28:27] the enemy. You are sent of God to do the
[1:28:31] work of God.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Now, we know as as matured
[1:28:38] Christians, as matured believers, and I
[1:28:41] say God mature us more
[1:28:45] that we can recognize the enemy when he
[1:28:49] tries to come in.
[1:28:51] I I don't care what he he'll come in any
[1:28:54] form. He'll he'll try to get you
[1:28:56] depressed. He'll try to get you uh with
[1:28:58] anxiety or he'll move through someone
[1:29:00] else.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He He'll try to work in the home. He'll
[1:29:06] try to work in the marriage. And if
[1:29:08] you're not careful, you'll end up
[1:29:09] fussing with your wife and your wife
[1:29:11] will end up fussing with you.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, you'll start, you
[1:29:17] know, uh uh there'll be a wall start
[1:29:19] being built between the the parents and
[1:29:21] the child.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:26] Well, church, that's the common thing
[1:29:28] today. There are so many divorce rates
[1:29:31] are rising.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Homes are being just torn apart.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to our home,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; we've been anointed of God.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; We've been sent of God and anointed
[1:29:49] to deal with this thing.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Ready to meet the challenge. I hope you
[1:29:54] understand.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; So, we we find that
[1:30:00] when he got onto the other side, this
[1:30:02] demonic man of 2,000 demons
[1:30:07] come running and felt and worshiped him.
[1:30:11] And and you know, brother Brown was
[1:30:13] talking. says, "You know, people think,
[1:30:15] well, how in the world how in the world
[1:30:18] could a man full of demons fall down and
[1:30:20] worship him, worship worship Christ?" He
[1:30:24] said, "Because he had a religious devil
[1:30:26] in him." He said, "There's a lot of
[1:30:30] demon-possessed people that come to
[1:30:32] church and worship God and all it is is
[1:30:35] a religious devil
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; because they ain't got an experience
[1:30:40] with God. They they've not gone into the
[1:30:42] depths of God to really get down and get
[1:30:44] the Holy Ghost to deliver them.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; So Jesus did what he was sent to do
[1:30:56] and that was to set that man free.
[1:30:59] Listen church, Jesus didn't run from his
[1:31:02] problem. Jesus didn't run from the
[1:31:04] challenge. Jesus didn't just shy away
[1:31:08] from the enemy. He met that enemy head
[1:31:11] on
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; cuz he was sin of God to do so. That's
[1:31:14] right.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Don't run from the challenges. David
[1:31:19] didn't run away.
[1:31:21] David actually ran to the enemy.
[1:31:27] Why? He was anointed to do it. He knew
[1:31:30] he was anointed.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He may have not felt the power of God.
[1:31:37] He may have not been running all over
[1:31:38] the building shouting glory to God. And
[1:31:42] he may have not felt nothing,
[1:31:46] but he knew this one thing. He was
[1:31:48] anointed to meet that challenge of the
[1:31:51] enemy.
[1:31:53] Amen.
[1:31:55] I like how brother Brandham in his
[1:31:56] prayer at the end of the service, he
[1:31:58] said, "Father, we go now to meet the
[1:32:00] enemy, to meet the lion, to meet the
[1:32:03] devil on every form that he's called
[1:32:06] that he's in called cancer,
[1:32:09] tuberculosis,
[1:32:11] Hodinson's disease, heart trouble, any
[1:32:14] other disease. We've come to meet him,
[1:32:18] not shy away from it, to to meet him.
[1:32:21] We've come to bind him and bring in this
[1:32:24] lamb back to the house of God again. Can
[1:32:28] you say amen? You're going to meet your
[1:32:30] enemy. Remember the prophet already told
[1:32:32] us that. And and and and you're going to
[1:32:34] meet your enemy. And you got to realize
[1:32:37] it's it's whatever front he's coming in.
[1:32:40] It's not natural. It's not a natural
[1:32:43] thing. It's not a natural warfare for
[1:32:45] you to struggle and you to and fall
[1:32:48] apart and and take nerve pills and and
[1:32:51] I'm just about to lose my mind and and
[1:32:53] all these things. It's for you to stand
[1:32:54] there as anointed son and daughter of
[1:32:57] God
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; and meet the challenge.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Not in your own self. Can you say amen?
[1:33:05] You're going to have to overcome that
[1:33:07] enemy. That's right. And Jesus was
[1:33:10] tempted in all points as we are. But he
[1:33:12] overcome,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by drinking. He was
[1:33:16] tempted by women. He was tempted by by
[1:33:19] the pleasures of life. He was tempted
[1:33:21] with pride. He was tempted with
[1:33:23] everything that is known to man to be
[1:33:26] tempted by. He was tempted and he
[1:33:28] overcome.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Now notice, I get very close that
[1:33:32] brother said overcome means to recognize
[1:33:34] the devil in every one of his tricks.
[1:33:38] Yeah.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And and and I I'll tell you the message
[1:33:44] of the hour helps us to recognize the
[1:33:47] devil and every one of his tricks.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say there is no devil.
[1:33:55] It's just a thought. Don't you believe
[1:33:56] that? There is a real devil. He's just
[1:33:59] as real as you are or anybody. A real
[1:34:02] devil. And you must recognize him real,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't just play it off.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; You know, there there was uh uh
[1:34:18] things going on
[1:34:21] in a in a church
[1:34:24] and
[1:34:27] uh just turmoil, just just a mess.
[1:34:32] and
[1:34:36] being uh another brother uh well,
[1:34:39] brother Wayne, we were talking about it
[1:34:40] and
[1:34:43] and how how just it just seemed like it
[1:34:46] just uh uh uh I don't know just just on
[1:34:50] every every front.
[1:34:54] Brother Wayne said he went back to the
[1:34:56] hotel.
[1:35:00] He said he got he woke up in the middle
[1:35:02] of the night just a weird feeling
[1:35:06] and he saw something move above the door
[1:35:08] and he looked and he there was a dark
[1:35:12] dark something there just in a form
[1:35:18] and it was looking at him
[1:35:20] and he got scared
[1:35:23] and a voice told him says don't be
[1:35:25] scared it's just a spirit
[1:35:28] that's all it is it's just a spirit
[1:35:29] spirit.
[1:35:31] He said when it come to him and he
[1:35:34] really understood that that couldn't
[1:35:35] hurt him, it was just the spirit.
[1:35:39] That thing left him left in the room.
[1:35:43] And that's the trouble with a lot of
[1:35:46] things that go on, whether it's in the
[1:35:48] home, whether it's in a church, or
[1:35:50] whether it's in an individual.
[1:35:52] It's just a spirit.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; We panic.
[1:35:59] We're looking at this.
[1:36:02] It's just the spirit.
[1:36:05] The thing is, you've been anointed
[1:36:09] to meet that spirit.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Just as Jesus did, every front the enemy
[1:36:15] came to him at, he was anointed.
[1:36:21] The church couldn't do it. They couldn't
[1:36:23] meet it.
[1:36:25] Not in that day. The people couldn't do
[1:36:27] it. The minister couldn't do it. But in
[1:36:30] this age, there's a people, a redeemed,
[1:36:34] the body of Christ
[1:36:36] that have the fullness of God,
[1:36:40] right? And and now we're we're we're
[1:36:42] we're coming to being able to recognize
[1:36:47] no matter where he comes in at, it's
[1:36:49] just a spirit. If it comes in the form
[1:36:51] of a physical, whether it's a cancer,
[1:36:54] tuberculosis, heart troubles, arthritis,
[1:36:57] Parkinson's, it's just a spirit.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Whether he's coming in a mental to where
[1:37:03] it just seemed like it's a breakdown and
[1:37:04] and we don't It's just a spirit.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Whether he's coming and he's attacking
[1:37:10] my wife or or my children or uh coming
[1:37:12] at me in a personal way or what, it's
[1:37:15] just a spirit.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:19] Come on now.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; I've been anointed for this. You've been
[1:37:24] anointed for this.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; God reserved the best for the last. He
[1:37:29] put you in this age, most evil age, the
[1:37:33] most deceptive age, the most worst age,
[1:37:37] but you're here anointed, sent from God
[1:37:40] to meet the challenge.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:46] So, Brother Bram said, "See, you
[1:37:48] recognize him
[1:37:50] and know that he's a devil and he's
[1:37:52] against you. Then to overcome, you must
[1:37:55] recognize that the God in you is greater
[1:37:57] and mightier than he is. That the one
[1:38:00] that's in you has already overcome him.
[1:38:02] And by his grace, you're more than a
[1:38:04] match for him." There's real overcoming
[1:38:08] when you recognize you don't have to
[1:38:10] dance anymore. You don't have to fast
[1:38:12] anymore. You don't have to whatever
[1:38:14] anymore. Just recognize him. Recognize
[1:38:18] the devil and recognize that the God in
[1:38:21] you is greater than that devil and
[1:38:23] you're more than a match for that thing.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Then you overcome him
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; because that's what you were sent to do.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Often times
[1:38:35] we don't see the value of our position
[1:38:39] and it's easier to look at someone else
[1:38:43] and how they're being used of God and
[1:38:45] maybe they're they're greatly anointed
[1:38:47] of God and and it just seems like
[1:38:49] they're doing great things for God and
[1:38:52] if you're not careful you you get
[1:38:55] discontent with where you're at and with
[1:38:57] what you're doing and feel like it's
[1:38:59] just you know it's it's just kind again
[1:39:01] like the man with that one talent.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I I just got this.
[1:39:08] The others are doing great. This is all
[1:39:11] I got.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; And and and by this we get discontent
[1:39:18] with what God's called us to do, the
[1:39:20] position that God's called us and and
[1:39:22] and all these things. And we can even
[1:39:26] let people steer us into doing something
[1:39:28] that's not of God.
[1:39:30] We become so discontent and dissatisfied
[1:39:34] that someone knew it wouldn't even have
[1:39:36] to have a prophecy. Just, hey, you ought
[1:39:38] to do this. Okay, let's do that.
[1:39:44] And it can be a worldly influence that
[1:39:46] we come under or a religious spirit that
[1:39:48] we let influences.
[1:39:51] How many people, good people, leave
[1:39:54] leave their position because they don't
[1:39:57] think they're doing any good with what
[1:39:59] they're at, with where they're at, with
[1:40:01] what they're doing, and and all that.
[1:40:03] I'll tell you, it's your enemy that's
[1:40:04] coming at you.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; So many women walk away from their
[1:40:10] position in the home to go out and work.
[1:40:16] God didn't call them to work. God called
[1:40:18] them to raise their babies. God called
[1:40:20] them to be a a housewife.
[1:40:23] More women are becoming complainers
[1:40:25] about having to stay at home and be a
[1:40:27] housewife and a mother. And and that's
[1:40:29] because Hollywood has glamorized this.
[1:40:33] They they have devalued home life. They
[1:40:36] have devalued traditional family. They
[1:40:38] have devalued the importance of a a a
[1:40:42] mother, a housewife, uh uh uh all of
[1:40:45] these things. and they've glamorized
[1:40:48] women in the workplace.
[1:40:53] So, women feel like they're missing out
[1:40:56] on life. And then we see that the roles
[1:40:59] are changing to where men are becoming
[1:41:01] more sisified
[1:41:05] because the role of a man, the character
[1:41:08] of a man have been so devalued and
[1:41:11] belittled by Hollywood and other things.
[1:41:14] But I uh but what a prophet told us is
[1:41:18] God put motherhood in the home for a
[1:41:20] reason.
[1:41:22] Motherhood is the backbone.
[1:41:25] When you break motherhood, you break the
[1:41:28] nation.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Is that not what a prophet said? That's
[1:41:30] right.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; So then you you've got a position and it
[1:41:35] may not seem like you're running, you
[1:41:38] know, uh, chariot races like everybody
[1:41:40] else is,
[1:41:44] but you're staying with what God's
[1:41:45] called you. There's a position that
[1:41:47] God's called you to do. thought about,
[1:41:50] you know, Rebecca Smith talking about
[1:41:53] her mom, Ma, and how other ministers,
[1:41:57] their wives were traveling with them all
[1:42:00] the time, being put in the forefront and
[1:42:03] and these things. But her mother, she
[1:42:05] asked her mom, "Why why don't you why
[1:42:08] don't you go with dad? Why don't you do
[1:42:09] all that?" She says, "I'm not called to
[1:42:11] do that. That's not me. That's not my
[1:42:13] ministry."
[1:42:15] And she said, "Well, man," she said,
[1:42:17] 'You know, she says, "I hate iron." She,
[1:42:20] you know, she Rebecca was said, she
[1:42:23] goes, "Man, I hate iron. I don't see how
[1:42:25] you love to iron." She said, "Becca, I
[1:42:28] never said I love to iron." She I hate
[1:42:30] it, but that's my place. And she said,
[1:42:33] you know, she one time I was just
[1:42:34] wondering why why why can't I be out
[1:42:37] like that? Why why can't I be out like
[1:42:38] these other women? Why do I have to be
[1:42:40] here? And then she realized, she goes,
[1:42:42] "I'm not doing anything here." And all
[1:42:44] that, but then she said, 'You know, it
[1:42:46] just come to me that I could be praying
[1:42:48] for your daddy. I could be praying for
[1:42:50] and and so she says that I determined
[1:42:53] that every clothes I ironed of his,
[1:42:55] every shirt, every pants, every
[1:42:57] whatever, I'd be praying, "God help
[1:42:59] Bill, God use him, God keep him, God
[1:43:03] protect him." And and you remember,
[1:43:05] Brother Brandham says, "My ministry is
[1:43:07] because of her.
[1:43:09] the success of my ministry is because of
[1:43:12] what she was doing. She was a prayer.
[1:43:14] She recognized that it wasn't she didn't
[1:43:17] have to be out there to be be somebody.
[1:43:19] She didn't have to do be out there.
[1:43:21] Amen. To do something for God. What God
[1:43:24] had called her, she took to heart.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:43:34] And I I I want to say that for you
[1:43:37] mothers, you housewives,
[1:43:40] it's not just the minister that has
[1:43:42] anointed you, you men that are workers
[1:43:45] and and things, but God has come to
[1:43:49] anoint every member of his body. He's
[1:43:52] come to anoint the housewife. He's come
[1:43:54] to anoint the the electrician, the
[1:43:57] computer technician. He's he's come to
[1:43:59] anoint the carpenter. He's come. So
[1:44:02] don't let the devil devalue your
[1:44:04] position in Christ. And I say that
[1:44:07] again, your position in Christ, don't
[1:44:10] let the devil devalue that. Because see,
[1:44:14] it's not it's not your position as
[1:44:17] husband or housewife or electrician or
[1:44:19] whatever that brings the power, even
[1:44:22] though God's called you for that, but
[1:44:24] it's your position in Christ. Right.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; So there there's other housewives,
[1:44:33] there's others plumbers, there's other
[1:44:35] men that go and work, there's other
[1:44:36] employees, employers, and and and and
[1:44:39] things like that. But the difference is
[1:44:41] your position in Christ. You have been
[1:44:44] sent and anointed of God.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's your position.
[1:44:51] See, uh in Christ, so your place in
[1:44:54] Christ matters.
[1:44:56] And in your position, you're sent.
[1:44:59] You're called to stop the devil in his
[1:45:02] tracks. In your position,
[1:45:06] if the musicians will come,
[1:45:09] I pray that God helps us to be more
[1:45:12] aware of that. Brother Brandham talking
[1:45:15] to the housewife, he said, "You got your
[1:45:16] position in Christ Jesus by the Holy
[1:45:18] Ghost. You're just as much David as the
[1:45:23] rest of them was." Can you say amen?
[1:45:27] So, here you are. Satan may be
[1:45:32] Satan's got traps. He Satan plans for
[1:45:34] these things, man. This isn't just
[1:45:37] something he just comes up with.
[1:45:41] He plans these things and he's looking
[1:45:43] and he's he's trying his best.
[1:45:48] He works it step by step.
[1:45:53] And if he gets you out of your position,
[1:46:00] well, maybe he's got something for your
[1:46:01] child, thinking, man, I can I can
[1:46:05] destroy that girl.
[1:46:08] I can make her a lesbian.
[1:46:11] I I I could really warp that child.
[1:46:15] I can't do it because mom,
[1:46:20] she's a prayer warrior.
[1:46:23] She's the one that
[1:46:25] keeping the house clean. How am I going
[1:46:28] to do that?
[1:46:30] I've tried. I'm trying, but I have to
[1:46:32] get through her.
[1:46:34] So then he starts fighting mama,
[1:46:37] discouraging mama. Get her away from
[1:46:39] prayer. get her away from. Well, then
[1:46:42] Satan said, "hm,
[1:46:44] maybe I can't get a hold of mama because
[1:46:46] of dad standing right there in the
[1:46:48] forefront,
[1:46:50] keeping the trash out of the home,
[1:46:52] keeping life clean, keeping dedicated,
[1:46:55] consecrated."
[1:46:58] So then he starts working on daddy. And
[1:47:00] if we're not careful, we think it's just
[1:47:03] a private war.
[1:47:05] We just feel the emotions. We just feel,
[1:47:08] "I'm not doing nothing. Oh, I'm just so
[1:47:10] discouraged. I I just don't know. I'm
[1:47:12] just barely hanging. You don't realize
[1:47:15] you're the one standing in the position
[1:47:17] to keep Satan from getting old over
[1:47:19] here, wrecking havoc in your home.
[1:47:22] And if we get sidetracked to where we're
[1:47:24] fighting this and fighting that and
[1:47:26] getting discontent and looking at
[1:47:28] everything else, Satan's behind us,
[1:47:33] working on our children, working on
[1:47:34] this. And And you see, there's a
[1:47:37] position. There's a position. You are
[1:47:39] sent. You may not be sent to have prayer
[1:47:42] lines for millions of people like
[1:47:44] brother Brandham did, but you're sent
[1:47:46] there. Wherever you're sent, there's the
[1:47:49] called to be a housewife, called to be a
[1:47:50] a pastor of a local church, called to be
[1:47:53] a deacon, called to be a trustee,
[1:47:55] whatever you're sent for, you're
[1:47:57] anointed of God to stand there in the
[1:48:00] battle.
[1:48:03] That's just as important as anything
[1:48:05] else.
[1:48:08] Can you say amen? I hope it's helped you
[1:48:11] today.
[1:48:16] Because if we don't recognize spirits,
[1:48:20] we we'll handle things wrong.
[1:48:24] We'll handle it wrong because we're
[1:48:26] looking at, well, that's just so and so.
[1:48:28] Well, I'm going to tell him a thing or
[1:48:29] two. How many times have we done that?
[1:48:33] and we've had the power to break that
[1:48:36] spirit. Instead, we caused scars.
[1:48:40] We've caused horror. We've caused
[1:48:42] things. We built walls.
[1:48:45] We've let the walls come up instead of
[1:48:48] breaking them down because we handle
[1:48:50] things wrong. And and brothers and
[1:48:52] sisters,
[1:48:55] this preacher's had to learn a lot
[1:48:59] just by response.
[1:49:02] how you respond. This parent has had to
[1:49:05] learn and I'm still learning.
[1:49:08] But I thought today as I just sat there,
[1:49:10] I couldn't sleep. So I just got up, I
[1:49:14] you know, and I just just all this
[1:49:17] coming to me, how you'd handle things,
[1:49:20] how you handle things, you can either
[1:49:22] you you're you're standing in a
[1:49:24] position, you're anointed to to cast
[1:49:27] that devil out. Sometimes you cast it
[1:49:29] out by love. Sometimes you cast it out
[1:49:31] by just a good response. Sometimes it's
[1:49:34] just how you handle things. And I
[1:49:36] thought, "Oh, God,
[1:49:39] help me."
[1:49:43] There's ever a time I want my children
[1:49:45] to see Christ in daddy. I want my wife,
[1:49:48] I want my church to see Christ in in
[1:49:50] their preacher.
[1:49:54] Can you say amen?
[1:49:57] Hallelujah. We're anointed.
[1:49:59] So, I don't know what you're going
[1:50:01] through. I'm telling you, don't panic.
[1:50:03] Don't fall apart.
[1:50:06] Don't let the devil work you out to
[1:50:08] where you just remember, you get out of
[1:50:11] your position that God can't use you.
[1:50:14] You allow your heart to get hard. You
[1:50:16] allow your heart to get bitter. You
[1:50:18] allow your heart to get so carnal. God
[1:50:20] can't use you.
[1:50:24] Can't use you.
[1:50:29] Stay in a place that you can be used of
[1:50:31] God. I I've got quotes. I I'll read them
[1:50:34] later, but brother Bram said, "Stay in a
[1:50:36] position. Stay in your position. Stay
[1:50:38] live such a life, consecrated life that
[1:50:40] when God needs you, he knows exactly
[1:50:42] where you're at and he can just move up
[1:50:45] on you.
[1:50:48] You don't have to go and repent. You
[1:50:49] don't have to go be, oh, God, you know,
[1:50:51] let me throw away my television. Let me
[1:50:53] throw away this. Let me throw away this.
[1:50:54] Let me get all cleaned up again so you
[1:50:56] can use me. Stand in your position that
[1:51:00] God can use you.
[1:51:02] You love him. Amen.

[1:51:14] I know the maker of the rain.
[1:51:22] He can calm the storm,
[1:51:25] make the sun to shine again.

[1:51:35] verse.

[1:51:41] sails on the troubled seas.
[1:51:45] whenever there's a wind in myself.
[1:51:53] But I have a friend
[1:51:56] who watches over me

[1:52:40] Sometimes I soar like an eagle
[1:52:45] through the sky
[1:52:47] above the peaks my soul can be found.
[1:52:55] An unexpected storm
[1:52:58] may drive me from the heights.
[1:53:03] Brings me low, but it'll never bring me
[1:53:07] down. Oh.
[1:53:09] Oh.
[1:53:11] Cuz I know the master of the wind.
[1:53:16] Aren't you glad you know him?
[1:53:19] I know the maker of the rain.
[1:53:25] Oh, and he can calm the storm.
[1:53:30] Make the sun to shine again.
[1:53:35] I know the master of Oh, sing it again.
[1:53:40] Hallelujah.
[1:53:42] I know the master of the wind.
[1:53:48] So glad I know
[1:53:51] the maker of the rain.
[1:53:57] And he can calm the storms, make the sun
[1:54:02] to shine again.
[1:54:05] Oh, I know the master of the wind.
[1:54:11] Oh,

[1:54:18] skies
[1:54:21] above the wind. my soul
[1:54:24] and be found.
[1:54:28] But an unexpected storm
[1:54:32] may drive me from the heights.
[1:54:36] Brings me low, but never brings me down.
[1:54:41] Do you know him tonight?
[1:54:44] I know the master of the will.
[1:54:50] Glory to God. I know the maker of the
[1:54:55] rain.
[1:54:58] Oh, he can calm the storms,
[1:55:03] make the sun to shine again.
[1:55:08] I know the master of the wind. He can
[1:55:12] calm the storm. Oh, and he can calm the
[1:55:16] storm.
[1:55:18] Make the sun to shine again.
[1:55:23] I know the master of the wind.
[1:55:29] Daniel, can you come up and sing that?
[1:55:31] There's nothing u impossible or nothing.
[1:55:36] Whatever that new song we sing. Amen.
[1:55:40] It ain't nothing.
[1:55:42] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:55:50] Hey God, do
[1:55:52] I may worry.
[1:55:54] Hold my breath till my face turns blue.
[1:55:58] It ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for
[1:56:02] you.
[1:56:04] The children had their backs at Red Sea.
[1:56:10] And old Pharaoh looked like he had the
[1:56:14] victory.
[1:56:15] But the waters
[1:56:17] roll on back with the wind you do. And
[1:56:21] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing. It
[1:56:23] ain't for you.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. It ain't nothing.
[1:56:29] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:56:33] I've been
[1:56:35] strong in everything I do. Glory. I may
[1:56:41] till my face turns blue. But it ain't
[1:56:45] nothing.
[1:56:46] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:56:49] And oh Joshua, he took a walk around
[1:56:53] Jero.
[1:56:55] And you told him, Lord, you told him
[1:56:58] that the wall would go
[1:57:01] and he crumbled at the shout when the
[1:57:05] trumpet flew. And it ain't nothing.
[1:57:10] for you. Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't
[1:57:15] nothing for you.
[1:57:17] Oh, I may sle
[1:57:21] everything I do. Oh, I may wor
[1:57:26] my bread till my face turns blue. But it
[1:57:30] ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:57:34] Oh, I was lonely. Sin had broken my
[1:57:39] heart too. And all the pieces I couldn't
[1:57:44] with the strongest glue. Oh my Lord
[1:57:47] Jesus, you took the pieces and made me
[1:57:50] new. And it ain't nothing. It ain't
[1:57:55] nothing for you. Oh, it ain't nothing.
[1:58:00] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:58:03] Oh, I may falter, stumble in everything
[1:58:07] I do, Lord, I may we
[1:58:13] turn, but it ain't nothing.
[1:58:17] It ain't nothing for you.
[1:58:20] How this body is slowly dying without
[1:58:24] within. Oh, I ain't worried though. The
[1:58:29] skin worms eat my skin. God, you'll open
[1:58:34] heaven's doors and I'll walk you right
[1:58:36] in a nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[1:58:43] It ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for
[1:58:46] you.
[1:58:48] I may fall to some everything I do. And
[1:58:54] I may wor
[1:59:14] everything I do.
[1:59:17] I work for my friend,
[1:59:22] but it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[1:59:25] for you.
[1:59:28] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:59:30] praise?
[1:59:32] Nothing. It's nothing for him.
[1:59:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you is
[1:59:39] our prayer. Amen. as you go throughout
[1:59:43] the week, just remember you're anointed
[1:59:46] to to meet the enemy.
[1:59:49] And uh we want to remember our meeting
[1:59:53] next week uh coming up, Brother Wayne.
[1:59:56] And I really encourage you to pray
[2:00:00] uh for the the services and God would
[2:00:03] just move. And before I forget, uh I
[2:00:08] know it's thinking ahead a little bit,
[2:00:10] but there will be no service on
[2:00:12] Christmas Eve. So that' be the Wednesday
[2:00:15] after our meeting. Uh we we won't be
[2:00:19] having service. So just keep that in
[2:00:22] mind. And uh but uh uh remember service
[2:00:28] this Sunday at 11:00. Amen. God bless
[2:00:31] you. Uh stay warm. I don't know what the
[2:00:34] weather's like outside, but you should
[2:00:36] be able to make it home and be safe.
[2:00:39] Amen. So, uh, let's just bow our heads
[2:00:43] in a word of prayer. Lord Jesus,
[2:00:47] we're so thankful that you still reign
[2:00:51] and that you're supreme in your power.
[2:00:54] You're supreme.
