I'm sure it'll be a blessing to us and uh we we love brother uh Daniel love his family appreciate the uh uh the stand that he's taken for the message of this hour amen and many people are falling away and uh then some's in the message don't really know what they believe so uh but uh it's good to know where we stand amen and uh so may we just stand to our feet and uh sing this uh of course you you are my strength when I am weak You Are My Strength when I am weak you are the treasure that I Seek You Are My [Music] All seeking you as a precious help I be a You Are My All In All oh Jesus Lamb of God Worthy is your name oh Jesus you're the Lamb of God Worthy is your name sing that second verse now taking my sin my cross my shame Rising again I bless your name you are my all is he your all and

greetings I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord I want to sing that first verse again in just a a moment there it goes right along with my sermon I bring greetings to you from Brother Brad Burgess the church back home and uh we were in Louisville and then we Lord blessed us we moved to Indiana here about a year ago so we're so glad to be out of the big city there was a lot of crime and when uh how was it when uh covid came that antifa people came and there was there was a problem in the with some racial things and they said we're going to give you 30 days and we're going to burn the city down and so our church was there they came within just a few blocks of the church and but the Lord allows us to go to Indiana so we're thankful for our new church we have to get brother Shawn over there to minister for us but it's um just good to be with you all today good to see sister Heather and amen it just seems like yesterday sister Mindy we were out in Arizona and we're just kids running around and now see them pillars in the church I think brother R brother Sean said it's been 13 years I think you've been married and here 12 years so my time goes by fast doesn't it now go ahead and add 12 years on to your life right now oh my that'll make people smile won't it but it's good to see uh brother sea going on with the Lord he's always had a big impact in our lives it's you think back uh I'm Just a Nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody came out our church and sang that my it's just the little things how God has woven our lives together you know and he weaves them and we can't you know tear them apart because God's woven our hearts together and so many I remember a few years ago at Easter time he preached at our church at Easter and talked about the prodal son wanting to change from a son to be a servant and it's just amazing how God takes stories and whoever tells you that story they're forever connected to that so brother Sean's connected in my life in so many ways and we certain certainly appreciate my brother and the the Martin family have have meant a lot to us and their fathers really uh has a close place in our heart amen good to see brother Josiah where's he at he just brought me this water right it's good to see him growing up taking apart that's what adoption is Right finding your place and placing of sons brother random forgive me I was went to the brandom Tabernacle brother ROM's church for the time I was two till I was 19 years old so I kind of know those people in there that's what makes the message so precious but brother random in 1959 preached the Holy Ghost series that was in December of 1959 and then in in uh believe it was April of 1960 he preaches a adoption and preaches placing of sons so there was several there that receive the Holy Spirit and then he shows you receive the Holy Spirit and then God places you into the body of Christ then you become a pillar the Bible says he that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Church of God so I want to be a pillar in God's house amen keep pillars that's what the church is standing on it's good to see these young Brothers amen being deacons I was a deacon for 13 years we were talking the other day it's really simple as a deacon you keep the good people in and you keep the bad people out that comes from being in the bad area but I saw brother Josiah directing the people in and watching the amen that's what the deacons are they policemen that protect the people thankful for good deacons that and we had the place we told them we said we got to have discernment people don't talk about the gifts in the body I said man we live in an area bad guy comes in we got to have discernment every service like no you're not going in there with that backpack I discern something's not right in that backpack and so I believe we got to have the gifts of the holy spirit I believe as we go on in time we're going to need the Holy Spirit I believe even this morning I didn't know I would be here I they were having a men's meeting and some of the brothers were down there they had Friday Saturday and Sunday and I come down took off the time a Sunday school teacher William my son's teaching Sunday school so I said I'm just going to go down and draw closer to the lord well yesterday brother Sean just kept coming on my heart coming on my heart I said well I'll just go into service and be blessed he can preach and help me and notify me and we just text this morning and here I am so I don't have a lot of you know I don't know I've got some notes the Lord put on my heart here and so maybe it'll maybe it's for a reason I believe God has everything working in control and maybe the Holy Spirit would speak to you today something in your heart and I'm just going to yield to the Holy Spirit and you yield to the Holy Spirit and then we'll let God speak to us man the bride makes herself ready but we don't know how to get ready but he knows how to make us ready so if we just surrender to him and say Lord I don't know when you're coming but you're coming and so if it's tomorrow morning Lord speak to me today amen that little song because I want to speak about um God's strength showing in our weakness and that first verse there I don't know if you can pull that verse of You Are My Strength when I am weak amen Paul said when I'm weak then I'm strong so let's sing This Together You Are My Strength when I am weak you are the TR measure that I See You Are My All In [Applause] [Music] All seeking you as a precious Dre Lord to give up oh you'd be a fool to give up now you are my all oh let's just lift our hands to the Lord Jesus this morning oh Jes Jesus the Lamb of God Worthy is your name Jesus Lamb of God Worthy is your name let just pray together Heavenly Father we just bow our heads to you Lord just asking that you would strengthen us today Lord pray Lord as we read your word that you would help us Lord we know this Bible is God in letter form and I pray as we would read it today Lord that you would speak to each one of our hearts Lord every brother every sister every mother every father every grandmother every grandfather Lord every young person Lord I pray that you would help us today Father we have one goal and that's to make Heaven our home pray that you would strengthen us today Lord bless these words and these thoughts and may they strengthen us bless brother Shawn Lord and sister Heather I pray bless this church Lord and the elders and the deacons may you strengthen us today we pray in Jesus name and the church said amen God bless you if you have your Bibles thank you musicians appreciate you all appreciate so much talent you know you never appreciate Talent till you don't have it and I don't have it so I appreciate you all what do they say no one someone that has a talent how how do they say everyone re recognizes someone's Talent except for the person that has it so if you ask brother uh Sean said that he's a drummer he likes to drum so he doesn't recognize that he's has a talent to play until he sees me go over there and sit down and get off Rhythm then you're like wow I do have a talent probably say the same thing about preaching you know he's like that guy doesn't have a talent brother Sean has a talent but we want to use our talents for the Lord Matthew 25 it was was one was given five one two and one one and it's interesting the one that come and said why didn't you do anything with your talent it's amazing the Bible says the person said I was afraid and it came from a fear a complex I was afraid we need to step past our fear and say Lord I am going to use my talent for you it didn't end that well for that person if you go on down that they went into weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth so we don't want to be that way we say Lord if all I can do is write I'm going to write somebody a card I'm going to S send a I got a phone I can send an encouraging text or let's do something for the Lord we only got a little bit of time left amen for 2 Corinthians chapter 12 I'm just going to read a couple verses and then we'll come back and go through this text if it's okay I got I you know I'm kind of an unorthodox person I picked up a plaque off brother Sean's wall there that was so good I'm going to read some of that got a church age book you're going might get a poper or good country cooking is that all right good country preaching is that all right amen 2 Corinthians chapter 12 let's just read two verses and then we'll come back to this verse number nine he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore would I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of God rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong for when I am weak then am I strong and I want to speak a little thought this morning God's strength showing because of our weakness God's strength showing because of our weakness may God add his Blessing to the word you may be seated if you can pull that down in that mind monitor just a little bit brother Judah um I want to go back to verse number one here and just talk about this because this chapter is very interesting as I was studying through it and just listening it this morning on the um the the Bible app but I was driving and Paul comes to here and he's talking he said it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord so he begins to talk it's very interesting he begins to compare himself with other people does anybody ever do that I guess we all do right singers do that musicians do that preachers do that and and um you know that's what they were talking the other day about uh social media how people they get on it and as soon as somebody would go on maybe a young girl go on and see somebody in social media and before you know in their mind they immediately say well I'm not that beautiful I'm not that talented before they go back and realize the statistics how many people are photoshopped and how many uh you know how how that those things are not real most of it is not real it's fake it's a and so there's another sermon I preach on images breaking down images and great godly men came and began to break down images and the devil has made these images of what a woman ought to be or what a man ought to be and people fall down and they start worshiping those images so much so that because when they can't attain to that image they maybe go and they they create Eating Disorders or maybe even commit suicide because the devil are you listening to me the devil created an image and people are worshiping that image but I think it's the second commandment Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image so people are making these images and they're engraving them in their mind and then they're serving that image and the image may not even be real it may be created by the devil where they're taking and photoshopping these things and changing it and people are trying to serve this image and God has told us look don't create that image and don't become a slave to that image just be in the image of christen the Bible says he is the IM image of the invisible God so we've got an image here Jesus Christ amen he was a perfect man and that's who we're striving to be like you say well why do you have that other picture up there well this St John's chapter 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the logos of God and then verse 14 said the word became flesh in Jesus Christ Jesus said I come from go is it right a little preach a little Doctrine he said I come from God I go back to God and in the book of Acts Paul wrote down on the road to Damascus he said who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest so the same light that we see in this picture was Jesus ascending back to that light and so then we find that well why do you have the man in there well he identified with a Ministry in our day so I wouldn't know who to follow brother Sean I didn't know who to follow and for the first time God came down and allowed science to prove that a Ministry was right for many many years the prophet of God said the angel of the Lord is here people would come in the prayer line he say do you feel them but all of a sudden God said I'm going to allow science to prove that this ministry is the correct one so that we know what to follow in this day and I'm so glad to be identified with that Ministry so here's a man Paul he's beginning to compare himself with other Ministries verse number two I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether they're out of the body I cannot tell God knowth so now he's comparing himself with other someone else who has a Ministry or someone else that has a talent someone else who makes cookies and has a recipe and and we're sharing we're constant but the Bible says they that compare themselves among themselves they're not wise they're not wise so it it does US good to be who God made us not try to be somebody else people exhaust themselves trying to be some like somebody else rather than just say hey this is how God made me he made me in the image of God and this is who I am so he goes on to say here um he he says such a one caught up in the third heaven verse number three and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth so there was questions that Paul had listen to me about Ministries that he could not explain is that okay from the Bible there was things about Jesus ministry I cannot explain I maybe said it before remember he healed the blind man he said now don't tell anybody now that doesn't make sense to me I would think you're the Savior you want you do a miracle and let everybody in the in the in the come and see the mirac going be drawn to Christ right that's our natural thinking when I get to heaven I'll ask Jesus why he did that and William brandom had some things in his ministry that I don't understand just like Paul had people around him and he didn't understand their Ministry and when I get to heaven I'll ask brother brandom say why did you say that I don't understand that but I tell you the part of Jesus ministry that I do understand is so wonderful it saved me from sin the part of William brandom's Ministry that I understand is so amazing it's more amazing than any other Ministry that I've seen on the face of the Earth so I I'm thankful for it Moses I don't understand you know how God could choose him in the same chapter he hadn't done the first thing to circumcise his his son to identify him as a a Jew do you know the do you know the Bible and his wife has to go C circumcise his own son and so when I get to heaven like Moses why didn't you do this a very why why is your you know and so there's things as Paul had questions about we have questions but that's okay just put them up on the Shelf sometimes I think Paul was it in Peter he said they wrestle to their own destruction Paul didn't wrestle he said I don't know I say there's no shame in saying I don't know I don't know sometimes mom's like your little kid's like why does daddy do this I don't know why he does it but he's still your daddy and he's the best daddy you ever had amen so verse number four how that he was caught up in into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which are not lawful for a man to utter of such a one would I Glory yet of myself I would not Glory but in my infirmities now I want you to see this because Paul has a a gift he has a Ministry each one of us have a gift that's what the Holy Ghost came for he said you'll be my Witnesses after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you you'll have a Ministry that's what we're on Earth for this if you listen to me today he'll save you from suicide you know because that you have a purpose in life a lot of people have no purpose no reason to live and they pull the sheet up over their head and and they have no purpose but we as Christians Jesus said I'm going to fill you with power and you'll be my Witnesses so we have a purpose to be a witness for Jesus Christ verse number six for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I would say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me so he he didn't want to be exalted he didn't want people to exalt him and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given unto him a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure so Paul is saying he's got these great Revelations he's got this um great uh ministry as we know in the book of Acts how he was smitten Down By The Light and God spoke and said you will be a light to the Gentiles so now God Mo uh Paul has a Heavenly visitation that vindicates his ministry but God gave him a thorn in the flesh to keep him humble now we're going somewhere with this here so Paul's saying I I've got a thorn in my flesh brother random comes along and I think it's known by history that Paul had a problem with his eyesight and somehow he couldn't read and so later you know he was praying like Lord if you would take away my infirmity I could write uh better letters so he's in a dungeon maybe he didn't have a lot of pulpits and microphones and uh mp3s and and and ways to stream his ministry he was just writing letters but we equate it to preaching are you with me today so Paul says I I have I can be exalted in Revelation I got a Vindication of by an Angelic visit um but I've got this infirmity in my flesh but listen to me his infirmity drove him closer to God now all of us have talents we have ability here's a young man sitting here in his strength the Bible says the glory of a young man is his strength so that a young man has his strength you may have a talent maybe you're beautiful maybe you have financial means or maybe you have a a memory that's just amazing and you could just go do great things in the world and and but God gives every one of his children a little bit of an infirmity can you say Amen to that that keeps them close to Jesus Christ now Paul is saying Lord if you'll re remove this infirmity if you'll fix my eyesight I can write better letters I can be a better Minister as we find here but the Bible says that it was it was something that that the um a messenger from Satan lest I should be exalted above measure this infirmity was given to him to keep him humble and this wasn't just something that went through his mind once in his life but the Bible says in the next verse for this thing besought I the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me so Paul is saying that he wanted this to depart from me and it was something that he dealt with continually in his life right and sometimes we pray Lord if you'll take this away maybe you'll take this little complex away or you'll take this away I could be a better but God says look my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in your weakness and it's something he he dealt with continually Paul is going to God again are you with me today again and again and again he's going to God saying God I'm dealing with this thing in my life verse number nine and he saith unto thee my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness God's strength is made perfect in weakness that's our thought this morning is God's strength showing because of your weakness God showing his strength is showing because we have a weakness in ourselves now each one of us have a weakness God put allows that to be in our life it might be an ailment in our body it might be a a um some type of infirmity Even in our spirit we were talking the other day at church you know we're a complex person brother goes through this and greatest battle ever fought and then knoweth that not he said you're a you have three Realms that you live in see taste feel smell and hear and we live in that realm but brother man makes this amazing statement he said see taste feel smell and here was never given to you to contact God and that just shocks us when we come into the church and then a prophet cames because other Ministries and the charismatics are like hey did you feel God today I'm looking for a sensation I'm looking like and propably God said those weren't given to you to contact God you have another s called faith and he that cometh to God Must Believe God is a spirit so if I'm going to experience God I'm going to experience him in a spirit realm so then we have a body and we have a a spirit realm which is conscience memory affection and reasoning and and so and then we down inside we know we have a soul it's born in sin and that Soul has to be born again but the other day we asked for prayer and brother Sean everybody seemed to be doing well in our body and we're so thankful for that so thankful to be well in our body but then we enter into that Spirit Realm and now you have a conscience maybe you have affections that aren't doing well today maybe you have reasoning and the reasoning the Devils come in there are you with me today and he's giving you some infirmity against maybe Jesus Christ or against the message of the hour you have some reasoning that's sick this morning maybe you have an affection that isn't right to where how's the Bible say marriage is undei uh marriage is Honorable and the bed undefiled and the Devil comes in and has created an affection that's not well and God is the Healer of all of our sickness what's it mean to be sick it means you're not well so we might be well in our body but now we have a conscience and a memory and affection and reasoning that can also become not well which is sick which is an infirmity but God is our healer this morning can you say Amen to that God is our healer amen he can fix our memory you say brother Daniel I got this memory way back and it keeps haunting me and it's It's haunting me but God can heal that today amen God can heal your affections with this world is created these images and people become affectionate towards things and they may not be the right kind of affections but God is the Healer to set our minds right the Bible says let the mind that was in Christ let it be inside of us and we are all tainted by this images and you go you can't go to Walmart and you can't go I don't do you have Walmart out here is it Costco I don't know they have all kinds of denominations and some people drive chivies and fors and now they get Teslas and Dodges and they did away with our Chryslers oh well praise the Lord and used to have the old Pinos anybody remember the pinto cars I loved I had one station wagon Volkswagen Beetle bugs you know all those ones and so we have memories we have good memories and then you have bad memories and the devil will come in this maybe you have a weakness in our our minds let me go through this I don't want to get ahead of myself in verse number nine most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities the power of God May rest upon me so he's gloring that he has an infirmity amen that keeps him humble before the Lord some people think well Lord boy if the Lord would bless me financially I could just serve the Lord so many but you know I see some people that God blesses them financially and they come to church less and less and less and maybe they get investment properties in Florida and Canada and overseas and be they are the very ones that now have the resources that could go to church but they are the very ones that go to church less and they have the resources to set aside so they could go to church so sometimes the blessings of the that we think come from God or we strive for isn't always a blessing it actually becomes a curse I've seen young people like oh I'm just not as beautiful as this person well that person sometimes maybe they're blessed with beauty but that's the thing that they have to constantly are battling with Lord let me keep this at the foot of the cross Lord let me let me keep it Sanctified or something else somebody is battling and they want and they're trying to cover it after this person says I wish I didn't have this this is actually a thorn in my flesh so God has given every one of us amen a weakness and that weakness should drive us to Jesus Christ now if you don't know what your weakness is you should by now if you're a Christian if you're a young Christian I understand but as you go on some people like oh I'm I'm a Christian Hallelujah I'm going to get baptized I'm going to Hallelujah and then God will allow you to fall on your face to realize you need me Jesus said without me you can't do anything and God has brings us when we're young and you know uh you know you you um I'm not old but I've been around a little while you know you're um how could I say Spirits don't age they don't age so you ask somebody like hey I'm going running I'm going to run five miles and then your body says no you're not going to run five miles how they say you know you're getting old when your mind makes contracts that your body can't carry out like we're not climbing that Hill you know so our bodies age but our spirit Stone Age we're still young so you have some of you gray hair but you're just as young and my I remember when my body would let me make a contract and my body would carry it out and we'd just go and and do and you're young and the glory of young men is your strength but after a few our bodies amen but we have a new body it's waiting for us we have a hope the world has no hope but we have a hope in Jesus Christ aren't you thankful for that you'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the Bible says Comfort one another with these words amen that's just not a story it's not a fable in a book but Jesus Christ he he said I was a I was dead and I'm alive forever more so he said because because I live you can live also amen it's Romans chapter 8 we have a hope in this world don't let the devil steal your hope we we got too many sunsets behind us brother Sean as the song says too many sunsets behind us too many prayer meetings too many Lonely Nights in prayer too many healings of our bodies too many healings in our spirit and our memory when you go through things of life and you say Lord I can't go on anymore because of this feeling this hurt that I have in my life but somehow the great physician comes by amen and he heals our body you know we go through things I've got a my finger right here you can't see it it looks like a normal finger but I cut my finger have I told that story here probably not I maybe I'll just share this so one day I went to Walmart and we needed a knife and uh there was a little knife I forget it was like $2.98 like it was a long knife brother sea had a sheath and I was like this is really easy and like this is really neat and so I tried it but the problem is they had a little nub if you have the handle and they have the nub they could put it up and they zip tied the the you probably seen it put one of those I don't those wire things you pulled the zip and it was on there and they're just a little thing and I like I could pull that off and I want to look at this blade and look at it so I pulled it wouldn't come off brother Sean have I not told this here uh so I took this thing like this and it has a sheath and I um I thought that's just little I could just break that thing so I pulled real hard well when it broke my hand was there and when it came out it it went um yeah it was bad so I went and and then I looked down on it and right away it was just blood everywhere I got your attention now don't I and so I just looked and it was bleed and then it was all over the floor and then I was like yikes I pushed together and I held it down and there was blood on the knife I don't remember how I got the blood off the knife I might have wiped it on my pants I put it back okay okay I'm I'm not g to steal this thing there all right I'm okay with that and then I'm like okay now how I could just go get a rag in the in the thing and I could try to um wipe it off but then I would have to wait in the line this went all the way to the bone of my finger and I'm holding it together and so I'm just walking I'm like okay what do I do I could go get a towel from the laundry thing and I can but then I got to stand in line and pay for for this thing so like I can't do that so I'm just kind of walking along like ah go to the bathroom so I go to the bathroom there was somebody at the sink I like uh cuz you know you look like an Axe Murderer and so I went over there they went out I went and just stuck my hand in cuz my whole hand was full of blood I just went down washed it off like that and as soon as open up it it was all the way to the Bone I was just all the way and I held it up and I rinsed it all out I rinsed the whole sink out and I held it together and I put it back together and I went got in my car and I'm driving in the car and anybody like have something like where you start getting that fainy feeling anybody passed out I've done that a couple times and you learn you know I passed out brother Sean I went to pray is this okay this is right where preacher I went to pray for somebody with my dad they had a um they had a a man that got hit by a had a terrible accident he was in traction so they went in he had his arms and legs and had pens through it and I went in to pray and you know and they had you look up and here's these pens are hanging from a big rack and all of a sudden I go down on the floor and they're like ah but I started getting fainy you know and you learn like through life it's just life you learn like okay I start passing out I start getting faint I got to get away from that before that so I'm driving in my car and I start get that and I'm like I got to control myself you know because we go through things in life and so my finger is numb it went all the way to the Bone so my I have no feeling in my now you all don't know you just see me functioning but if I ever see a knife and it's un torqued like that that I have a trigger and it goes back and I've been through through something in my life and I've got a weakness but it causes me to walk very cautiously through life now all of us have been through things in our life and the thing that makes you you and me me is I've have different experiences and he has different experience he's lived older than myself so he has different experiences how do they say every person is superior to you in the fact that they know something that you don't know so whether it's a scientist or whether it's a a man on the back of a garbage truck he knows how much pressure it takes to scoop that thing back in and compress I've always wanted to know how much pressure is in that and if I could survive if somebody threw me in a dumpster and I like how do I Ser how much so if I meet a garbage man I'm going to ask him that you know so I say that to say each one of you are different than someone else because you have experiences that nobody else has and God is molding and shaping things around you to make you the best tool that you can be for the job that you're called to do God has a a job for every one of you all to do and he's molding and shaping you to be that tool I'm I'm way ahead of myself and I just want to get to something here let me let me finish this verse and we'll we'll we'll come verse number 10 therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities I I take pleasure in the things that I'm going through and the reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distress for Christ sake for when I am weak then I am strong so Paul is saying when I am weak then I'm strong but I'm strong in the Lord so we go through things in our life and they have what they call triggers I have a trigger when I see a knife that's under someone's twerking a knife blade like no no no no don't do that let me come here I'll tell you the story about cutting my finger and and and so we see that that that um we go through things and Paul's saying I take pleasure that God's power is showing through my weakness now Lucifer he didn't mind taking the glory we don't have time this morning but go Isaiah chap 4 14 and Ezekiel 28 he said I will be exalted I will be like the most high I the Bible says he was the anointed cherub maybe I think that's Ezekiel 28 that just comes to my mind Ezekiel the 28th chapter and now Lucifer as brother Ram tells us that there was only one difference between God and Lucifer was God could create and Lucifer couldn't he still has that handicap today he cannot create he only perverts so you watch in the music God we Man was created in God's image so you see a lot of the the people that have fallen out into the world the musicians and movie stars a lot of them came from church and they get their Inspirations brother Ram said I think uh was it Elvis Presley said he learned his moves in the house of God and he would he would move in in a moral immoral way but they got their inspiration for God from God because Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am life I am inspiration so you watch how the Devil comes and he takes their inspiration he takes their talent and pulls it out and uses it for a devil and he just throws their life away after a while they have mental breakdowns they they they uh take their life many of them overdose because God has given them inspiration and the devil the how's the Bible say John 10:10 the thief cometh but to steal kill and to destroy true so the god creates inspiration you see Christians are smiling they don't have tattoos all over face they can talk in complete sentence we were talking about it in Proverbs Chapter 5 6 and 7 uh about the evil woman the Bible says the adulterous woman s looks for the searches for the precious life she's not looking for that guy laying in to get her out there can't talk he's she's looking for a man that can walk upright talk intelligently show up every day for a job and come home every night that's what the adulterous woman is look that's what the world wants and the women they in the world they think they want some man that can walk all over and but now there's we see this great movement reversing a woman is actually wanting to stay home and take care of children and have a man that will go out into the world and protect them and provide for them it you can't get away from God's original way amen so Lucifer he was exalted let's go to Ezekiel chapter 28 I didn't tell the brothers back there and there uh verse 23 2813 says Thou was an Eden in the garden of God verse 14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe so thou was upon the holy Mount of God thou H has walked up and down in the midst of the stones thou was perfect in all thy ways from the day that that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee so we find that Satan he was exalted he he desired to be like God he desired to be lifted up he was anointed he was so don't go by anointing you can't go by anointing brother Rand it's so amazing this message Comey preach the anointed ones at the end time we don't go by the anointing as they said in the old days in Pentecost man it was the man a preacher that had the most beautiful wife that was beautiful and could sing and the man that could sweat the most and man that was the guy that we followed but then all of a sudden God sends a prophet along maybe couldn't sing the best and his wife you never saw her out in the Forefront and carry a tune and maybe his delivery was a little Octor but God was sending a message and he was I'm going to get ahead of myself here but he says I think it's in the Deep C of the deep he said you know I'm waiting for something I'm helpless as a baby and now a prophet knows that he is weak brother Sean he has no ability there's maybe 8,000 people are standing came that night to see the angel of the Lord manifest himself and hears a vessel saying I am as helpless as a baby I have a seventh grade education I have nothing but God's strength was made perfect in his weakness so when a prophet realizes I there's he said he said he the angel of the Lord told him when he came to um to the little cabin so I live in Charlestown that's right a few miles from where the angel of the Lord visited brother brandham and so the angel of the Lord met him in the cabin remember he was on the way to the cave some people say he was in the cave but he wasn't he was in the cabin remember he said the angel of the Lord walk through the door we need to listen to the tapes and not there's a lot of stuff going around but if you'll listen to God's Prophet God sent a messenger we're going to read some things and God has allowed at the only age is this okay the only age God has allowed The Messengers that age his voice to be uh sustained and stored so so the people of that age amen could continue to hear it and I believe that the the Rapture is three-fold shout voice and trumpet your pastors taught you that from the message the Rapture and it's a shout it's it's a message that's going out it's a message that's going out I'm so glad that we don't have to rely on people that just hey somebody told me this and somebody told me this I live in Jeffersonville I know all these people and everybody's got a story and I appreciate their stories but the B of God said you say what I said on those saves and God has allowed all of us the ability to listen to God's Prophet that your faith might be turned back to the Faith of Our Fathers oh I believe it with all of my heart we don't have to believe and listen to hear say we can listen to God's prophet and I've always appreciated that about brother Shawn and the Martin family how that they they give this message the the the the Credence that it should amen you you think about um even St Paul he said if I or an angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel than that which I've preached unto you let him be a cursed so Paul is not in just saying hey if I die and somebody else comes you don't listen to him he said if I come back with some type of an ailment In My Memory if I get mention and I come back and say what I preach back there isn't right he said let me be a cursed how do he say it if any man think himself to be spiritual let him consider that the things that I've have written unto you are the Commandments of almighty God Amen so that was the Commandments of God he said don't let somebody come in and your reasoning don't let them come in and your imagination your your affections amen be affectionate towards the word of God and maybe you're not today the other day somebody they sang brother Sean's song We were singing at church Jesus you're the center of my joy brother John was branded with that in my life as well but I realized Lord You're Not the center of my joy there's just something about being honest with God and I sat there and I said Lord I'm singing this song but you are not the center of my joy and I need you to become the center of my joy because as a prophet of God said there's many disappointments in life and he said if you don't have your mind set completely on Jesus Christ he said there are many hurts that cancers come into people's memory cancers come into people's reasoning and they start oh if I had done it different back there but brother bam said God allows those disappointments to come to cause you to slow down and stop and think about your life oh my let's just get past Lucifer because there's some more things that I want to say because he was exalted he was lifted up but there's something about weakness now we in America we don't like weakness we like strength that's what I'm saying I I we we had some politicians before I'm from Indiana we had a man called Mike Pence he was a he was a righteous man in the capacity that he was SE January I'm talk politics January uh 6 when they were having that Insurrection if you go back and watch he he was in the basement quoting scriptures to his colleagues they were going to try to kill him they were saying and they were coming to hang him on he's down in the basement of the White House or wherever they was that they were they were down in this basement quoting scriptures back and forth and later that night it's amazing watch him and his colleagues were quoting scriptures it's it's real so we had some righteous in but our nation doesn't want righteous men they want radical they want radical it's those cage fighters we want somebody that's in your face and that's what America wants and that's what they're going to get they want something that's radical and extreme they don't want a conservative godly man that says hey we're going to pray about this we're about to go into World War II we need to pray everybody pray and seek God and let's seek Direction people don't want that they want something radical amen but there's something about a Christian they realized from the scripture as Paul had a weakness and that weakness is what allowed God's strength to be shown brother Bram surrendered himself to God and that weakness that he had allowed Christ that actually the son of man Ministry to be shown so greatly that we had what we called the deity spirit there were people that actually believed he was Jesus Christ I live in this area I the random Tabernacle it maybe was was prevalent there and people brother man he in the Bruce serpent he came and he leaves the ministry he said I I went there and they were baptizing in my name they were praying in my name I know these people and that's what I like to say to the critics sometimes brother Sean like hey was your ministry so much like Christ that people thought that you were literally Jesus Christ came back to the earth I know brother Charlie Cox some of you all know him said we never had a worry because brother branam was one phone call away my father-in-law he went hunting and he run a stick through his ear and and he bled a whole pillow of blood out of out out of his ear into the he they just called brother brandom brother Bram says it on tape he said he he he he talks about on tape brother brandom just prays for him he goes back he burst his eardrum he goes back to the doctor and his his ear is completely healed God healed his ear he said brother brandom was just one phone call away oh Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever we just need to have faith and God removed so we wouldn't think this was our savior God removed him so that we started looking to the right place I'm the Lord heals all your sicknesses and all of your diseases amen we need to get our theology right we're not praying to brother random he said if you get the people to believe that this is a gift here's God here's Fallen man I'm just a channel if you get the people to believe amen that I'm a channel nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer I was talking to somebody the other day and they're aging they're up and they said well hey I disagree with Brother bandam on on on on several points and but they had a sickness in their body I said you know what I would do if I Was 80 years old and had a sickness in my body I wouldn't worry about where I disagreed with him I would worry about the prayer lines he said if you get the people to believe me nothing will stand before your prayer and when I get to heaven I'd say hey here's the things I don't understand well you talk to me about but I know that your ministry is a gift from God to help me now that's the same with your pastor that's the same with your musician I do not understand how those people do play those keys the other day a brother got up and sang a special and he sang in English and then he just switched to Spanish and was singing in Spanish and they didn't they just went on and play like oh music transverses languages oh that's interesting I learn every day I don't understand that but it's yeah so like okay I'm learning same with brother sea or whatever like I don't understand that Ministry but as we go along like oh okay I understand that I understand why brother Ram said Minister should sleep in a Monday because they give everything out and they just like ah you know and maybe you don't they didn't understand brother Brandon why he was so weak and like they had that little thing remember if you watch on deep C the Deep brother Billy comes behind brother brandom he takes his Bible and then the other thing he had this thing where they worked on both sides he would touch him on the sides and brother brandom if he pushed in on his side he was he was conscious because remember Jesus the woman touched His Garment he said I feel like virtue has gone out so when the people were pulling it would pull virtue out of brother rand's I don't understand it's just the way it was so they worked out this little system and so remember when brother Billy would leave him in too long he would just get real faint and he'd tell him like brother Billy we can't have a prayer line tomorrow because I'm too weak you left me in too long and so they worked out the system we wouldn't have the discernments if it wasn't for brother Billy Paul but he and his father they had a Ministry and they work together and so brother Billy you watch it brother brandom comes right beside him and he feels him on the side and then they and brother Billy when brother br's praying he comes brother Billy comes and puts his hands on both Sid of they worked out a system that he would take him out when he was no longer conscious and so we all have weaknesses and we learn to work with those weaknesses each one of us have a weakness maybe it was something happened way back in our childhood I think brother brandom's in derer he said he stand there he says sister I see I see a nervousness it was caused by a dog a dog chased you when you were young and now it's creating something way back in her life but she came to Jesus Christ who can fix those things and maybe every time she heard a dog bark she went back to that and it created such a fear because there's things in our life that will paralyze us and me we can't let the devil paralyze Our Lives we're Christians we're so soldiers of the Cross but things that we go through in our life can paralyze us I I don't want to get ahead of myself here let's just let's just stay together Moses when he came and he had abilities he he God said look I need you to do this he said Lord I can't speak we were kidding the other day some of the brothers together you know he was the the Bible says he he taught the masters of Israel right of of Egypt so he was to be the night he was a great learned man he was a proper child so then later God talks to him said I want you to go down there going be the delivery he said I can't talk and I said what happened and we got married brother Rim said he had a temper and his wife had a temper and after a while he got to the place I can't even say anything without him her shooting me down and just I can't even talk God and God said look we're you know I'm not here to talk to you about your inabilities because God has ways to mold us and shape uses and sometimes uh um my wife sent me something like that today like basically that she was the one there to help me through life and she is my friend brother Minister was and he showed me an ironing board and he was trying to iron this morning and you know God does those things to help us through life it's called a helpmate young people trying to they get up and they get all Google out like like forget that stuff you're trying to get a helpmate it's like right foot left foot you ever played soccer on one foot you can do it but it's so nice when you have the other foot it looks more normal and natural right and God go back to Genesis and God created man male and female created it was one and then God created a help man he took the feminine Spirit out and put it it's such a beautiful thing but marriage is Honorable so some times people go through things I'll say it like this maybe somebody else makes a decision and exits a marriage and it begins to affect that person and sometimes you see sometimes people a lot of times the the the the lesbian and that thing it comes from a complex or an injury maybe there's an abuse or maybe there's a father that didn't um take care of his family or Abus his family so that daughter says look there's no good men are you with me and like well just a marriage is just a terrible thing no the devil caused that God didn't cause that we were made in the image of God and the Bible says marriage is Honorable the devil is the one that corrupted that God didn't cause that problem the devil did and so now the world has created this image of what a marriage should be and I you know if God created it we ought to go back to the Bible and see what a marriage should be so sometimes the Devil comes in and there's Injustice you know I was thinking of that brother Ram said life wasn't meant to be easy life wasn't we got some people back brother brother Sean they they work like six hours a day make great money they and it's like I think of that prophet and then people get this entitlement thing like hey I don't have to work I just I should be getting a paycheck and and so I think what the prophet of God said that uh you know how is it character is not a gift it's a victory it's something you struggled with and if if you got a home today you fought and struggled to have that home if you have a marriage is because you struggled and worked through the thing and uh you know if you have a sound mind today you struggled to have a sound mind because the devil is there to destroy us and and and take our minds and get it and and that's what this social media has done it's caused people to get hooked on um dopamine and I'm that's a whole another sermon we are not ignorant of his devices and how that the devil a man left Facebook and they said he got into a room and said how can we addict these people to get them to stay on our Facebook and they said we went to the gambling industry when you pull down the slot machine and it does a ding and then and we we took that and put it into social media when a person does tries to pull it down to get uh more content to come and because when you he see something you like it releases dopamine in your brain which is many uh uh many times more addictive than cocaine who said we've addicted a society and they said what have we done to humanity we've addicted them to something and that's why see people sometimes you take a see kids you take their phone and they throw a f don't blame them blame you you've gave them something that's very addictive and now it's like taking a cocaine addict and taking his cocaine away he's just like ah so God help us we come to church and say Lord how do we deal with this stuff like how do we that's what was it James the first chapter If any man like wisdom let him ask God and that's what we're doing God help me God I do not know how to navigate through this life you have to help me Lord I I don't as one the brother was a nurse he said they they release our um schedules on Facebook you if you don't have Facebook you're not so I say Lord help me to navigate through this I need the Lord Jesus I got to have him or should we say we have a weakness they were talking about they've capitalized on the weaknesses of humanity whether it's gambling or addiction or whatever it is and some of those things they paralyze a person don't let me get ahead of it so Moses he comes and and God begins to shape Moses and make him to what he ought to be and he goes down and delivers the people people but think about this when he comes out people begin to affect him and he's standing at a Red Sea and the people begin to trigger things in his mind so he's standing there he's like Lord I could just get a boat and go across but now I got two million people that are depending upon me to get them across this Red Sea and it triggers something he starts crying and now he's crying but what does that weakness when he realiz listen to me when he realized I can't do this I have a weakness I got two million people I got to feed these people I got to deliver them from and he realized I'm not capable amen so now in his weakness oh if he had been a great military like hey when we come out of here we're going to train all these soldiers you all will be in the back it but he didn't have any of that in fact there was a pillar of fire that went before him that was leading him oh but then that Pillar of Fire went and was behind them and it became their protection that stood between them and between the enemy oh blessed be the name of the Lord we have a Ministry that was identified by a pillar of fire it's leading Us by a message of the hour but it sometimes it goes behind you and it begins to protect you in your weakness aren't you thankful today amen this just comes to mind the other day uh president Trump I'm not prophesying his you call past president's President right so president Trump when he was given his speech and a sniper was was a way he didn't even see what was happening but in another realm are you with me another Realm elev ated realm a sniper is trying to take his life and he maybe got some shots out and maybe Hur hit him and and and president Trump just gets down behind the the podium but there was another sniper that took out the other sniper so there there there's snipers there's spiritual demons in high places that are trying to destroy your life they're not coming to play patty cake they're coming to destroy your home your marriage your mind to put you in a premature grave to take your own life that's what the but there's another Holy Spirit amen that sees way out he sees the tactics of the enemy and greater is he that's on your side than he that's on the other side remember the servant come to G to Elisha said look they're all around us and God says look open his eyes that he can see what I'm seeing and God opened his eyes and he had a revelation nothing changed but his revelation of what he was seeing may God open our eyes today and say if God's called me he that has called me he's faithful to complete everything that he's started inside of me do you believe that today you believe God would start to build a house and he's like ah man Rapture came didn't get down sorry we're out of here no if he's called you that's why Peter says make your calling an election sure you realize I didn't just ask to get into this God came and found me one day he picked me up have you worked that out with God have you that only comes through prayer maybe stopping the laundry and just sitting down and say Lord am I was I trapped into this by marriage or am I in this really because I believe this this is my life I believe this brother Sean I'm giving my life I'm I'm 56 years old the same age that brother brandom was when he passed away I you know I'm I'm too old to think and so I'm like hey is there a better way and I'm hey if the if Benny hen had it I'd be there if the Amish had it I'd be there and I probably said that before because but there's nothing else out there that I want to go to and I see some people that are leaving brother Sean I'm like I never want to go where you're going and I don't even want any of my friends to go where you're going because I have a great God that is the Healer amen of my body but not only my body of my conscience my memory my affection my reasoning he's our healer today he can make all things wrong that's wrong he can make them right if you're here today and you got sin in your soul he that's what he really died for was for your so Soul problem our bodies are going to die and go to De go to go to the Grave our spirit realm you know and so we want our soul to be redeemed in Jesus Christ amen amen so the weakness that Moses had was what drove him to God now I don't know if you're allowed to do this when you're a preacher but that's just who I am so a lot of time is quotes and things but I have a weakness and they say when you share weaknesses You're vulnerable right because then somebody knows you're weak that's all right so you're not going to you're you're with okay I'm going to hold you to it okay sorry so we we all have weaknesses and I'm going to share one that I have and it's it's a a demon that follows me around it's the same demon that followed Christ when he took him up on the thing and said cast yourself off so this follows me whenever I go to a place that's high this whatever it is I don't I can't explain it it comes and says jump he says jump off this might be really personal but it's it's just me okay it's a it's it's something that's there every time I get close to something this something will say JUMP just jump off and I say that because if I yield to that it will destroy me now each one of you may have and maybe we have many weaknesses because we're humanity and the more listen to me the more weaknesses you have the closer you walk to Christ amen the more weaknesses you have the closer you walk to Jesus Christ that's a great revelation and when you realize I am weak but he is strong and I cannot make it without him am but there's people in your life that'll set these triggers off and one of them in my life is my wife so we went to Colorado and I think it's the longest suspension bridge in the US and she's like we got to go walk this bridge I'm like yeah you know and I'm like yeah yeah let's go do that let's go do it and I it's not till I get there I realize oh that's that thing and it's here and so we walk and I walk it's probably the bridge is probably from that Pew this wide and but it's like a th000 ft down it's just I mean it's beautiful to stand back but when I get close to the edge it so I I walk in the middle she's with me I walk in the middle and we make the other side it was beautiful time we spent together and then coming back she's like going to the edge looking over it's beautiful taking pictures and and this thing comes and it says jump jump and it's a power and it's just and I start just walking fast and she's way back there and and and at the end I was practically running off the bridge to get off the bridge because this thing was there I don't maybe that makes me a bad person I don't know it's the same when that was chasing Jesus if I'm bad then Jesus was bad because that's what it told him to do Chum but I have a weakness whatever that is I don't understand it I don't try sometimes we try to analyze our weakness just rather than just saying that's a weakness I got to get away from that because I know the other day my wife wanted to go walking they put built a new bridge across the river is this okay like now you know brother Daniel's weakness and you see me on a bridge please stop and Pull Me Away From The Edge all right be brother I told you you got to stop you got to stop and help me off the bridge so my wife she's like let's go walk and so we walk and we get to the to the thing and and it's a long way I didn't want to walk it's like five miles all the way down back I'm like I'm not going we made it to the bridge I'm like let's go back and she's like no let's just go halfway so I just go maybe 500 ft out and I look down there's a boat down there now I'm at the edge and there's a stick thicking up and my mind is like I start reasoning I don't whatever that is it's like hey if you jump there's a stick I wonder if you tipped your feet if you would and you wouldn't and you how deep does it have to be before you and you start reasoning whatever that is it start we can't reasoning the Bible says cast down reasoning now I can tell you if I had reasoned with the devil I wouldn't be here today if I had reasoned with whatever that we now you whatever your weaknesses you you should know you know men women you have a weakness and brother said when I get tired get that Moody down depressed or whatever it is that blues or whatever and you play and you try to reason with that rather than just get away from he say be happy and sing songs and talk about the Lord and and that's just the way of life and we go through that we're going through it we're not going to sit and reason to become a vegetable and let it paralyze us can you say Amen to that I don't know why the Lord has me here today but maybe the Lord's speaking to some of us today don't let your weakness be the thing that that that that that stops you let it be the weakness that drives you to Jesus Christ Lord I can't speak that's okay Moses I'm going to give you Aaron a crutch that'll help you go and still be the deliverer but I can't be a wife because I this triggers and I've seen bad marriages and that that's okay but God's going to give you a little something to help you through life amen how's it say first John 1 we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ somebody called it's a paraclet you go back and look somebody called alongside to help and he's there to help me saying Daniel don't go by that Edge don't reason with that thing just get away from it just get away from it stay in Christ there's life in Christ there's so many things that can paralyze you maybe fear maybe doubt well I don't know do you think and then it just pretty soon it paralyzes your faith paralyzes your marit maybe a little seated discrepancy I wonder if that could be and all of a sudden your life becomes paralyzed addictions people start D dabbling with the I hope that is okay I thank God for this message and the denominations brother bam said they would teach you to drink moderately okay so when kid you had a kid he's going off to college you like it's body mass index um BMI okay it takes five beers to get somebody that's large and if you're really thin then only one beer so they teach them before you go to college you need to consume beer so you know hey it's two and a half beers will make you drunk you need to only drink two beers this is religious people brother Bram is tell they they're teaching them and they're using he turned the water into wine and you see how the devil take that thing and twist it right around but there's a people that are nazarites to God they have a purpose like Samson I'm I'm under a covenant with God and man shun the very appearance of being a part of the world and shun the very appearance of being on that evil side whatever they do I do the opposite get away from it and so the prophet of God comes and said no you're teaching those kids to be alcoholics because you know what listen to me right here the devil has to tell you it's moderation but the devil knows nothing about moderation I am really sharing some I have an UPS we have a little business to try to pay the bills there's a UPS driver that comes anybody have UPS driver comes to your house well that's is this man coming he's a habitual Gambler and he comes in and he tries to get me he said man we won this weekend and we won so big and we won this and we won this and he's constantly getting and I just tell him like I can't do what you do I I can't because I'm weak I can't do there there's something about being honest I can't do what you do because I am weak because the Bible says whatsoever you find to do do it with all your might if you're going to sing sing your best if you're going to preach preach your best if you're going to sleep sleep your best whatsoever you find to do do it with all your might so if I'm going to gamble I'm going to gamble and I tell my employees if you ever see me hang out with a guy you know this place is in trouble because the doesn't know moderation now he knows moderation as long as everything's good and the economy is good your marriage is good the kids don't but when they come back and say your child has cancer or hey you have this sickness you only got six months to live the devil takes what you thought was moderation and he takes it to the extreme can you say amen and the devil has a way of getting those little hooks in people then he pulls the the rug out from underneath them drops the floor out and then they hang their life is the old news and then they hang their life and and may God help us today to get us away from those things say I'm not going on the devil's territory sure I have a weakness but I'm coming to the house of the Lord when I'm weak then he's strong when I realize it's not me holding myself it's him that's holding me it's him that's helping me Amen in him we move and we live and we have our being in Jesus Christ oh if nothing else may we come today to realize our dependence on Jesus Christ Jesus said without me you can be do nothing and weiz oh I'm strong like I've got some talents and I'm an organized person I can do this and this but you don't realize that your whole makeup is made of a chemical balance they're saying one drop added to your thyroid gland makes you an idiot and then I realize Lord like I'm just a chemical balance and I'm held in your hand and that could all change tomorrow and we realize how weak we are how frail we are Lord I'm Nothing Without You Lord amen and Lord I know my weaknesses whatever it might be it might be condemnation and maybe something that's Way Way Back and you did back there maybe it even made it to the internet like they say I know something greater than the internet and it's the blood of Jesus Christ people do things on the internet they can't get it off they spend thousands and thousands of dollars try to scrub their personality and they've did things and people go back it's kind of like tattoos that right if I share some things with you I was on an airplane here not long back and I was sitting next to this it was it looked like a 14-year-old girl where you know how it is you're just like like this and you're all crammed in there and this looked like a 14-year-old girl sat down she's sitting there and and I noticed she had shorts and she had tattoos on her leg said brother Daniel where are you looking at this girl's leg hold on a minute let me get yourself right you know you got a prophet that rode on a bus one day and they told a joke he was sitting next to a person and thought it was a man and he slapped this woman on the leg prophet of God was dealing with transgenderism way back there and he got wrapped all up in it your Prophet sat on a bus slapped the woman on leg and said hey that's a good joke you told a good one and then later said hey Martha like oh my goodness I the prophet just slapped a woman on the leg so when people get their self-righteous stuff and all that just like hey wait a minute we're dealing with a crooked and perverse generation that we live in May the Lord help us today to man sometimes the devil he'll go out there and allow people to do things that'll get on social media whatever and like how can I get that off and the devil will hold that per listen to me he will paralyze them in condemnation and hold them and people have fake identities and things like that and they do things but there's something greater than the internet that's the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin aren't you glad you know something more powerful than the internet amen it's it is powerful I can send a text now my friends in China can get the text in India or China it's an amazing tool but the blood of Jesus Christ amen will cleanse you from all sin and God can't even remember that you ever did it oh blessed be the the name of the Lord we need to stop letting the devil paralyze us amen we need to stop letting it using excuse say Lord I'm going to let the Holy Ghost fill me I'll be endued with power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon me this morning may the Holy Ghost come upon us and move from where we are closer to Jesus Christ it might be condemnation it might be lust it might be lying it might be your cell phone that paralyzes you all of a sudden for 3 hours you just sit there swiping up may the Lord help us the Lord help us brother R said this I think it's why Christ speak he said your faith will paralyze the glamour of the world or the glamour of the world will paralyze your faith right now just think about that this is why Christ speak you know I'm not here to take the glory of this thought I came from a message why Christ speak go back and listen to it brother Ram said your faith will paralyze the glamour of the world because so he does deny that there's glamor of the world remember the Bible says um people say well there's no pleasure in sin but that's not what the Bible says said Moses forsook the pleasure the the of because it was for a season refused to be called the the daughter of pharaoh and have a great position because he realized it was just for a season so there is a glamour of the world and the prophet of God said or the glamour of the world will paralyze your faith what is your faith it's a revelation what is Faith it's a divine revelation of the will of God for your life so you're sitting here today because of a revelation the Bible says faith a revelation is the victory that overcomes the world so whether you realize it or not God's revealed to you that this is God's word and the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together that much more as you see the day approaching so that's been to revealed to you so you got out of bed and came to church this morning so by your Revelation you're overcoming Cosmos the world order right sometimes we don't realize we're fulfilling scripture and there we are but the devil will come and try to paralyze your faith by the glamour of the world it's called is it fumo f m o fear of missing out fear of missing out and all of us see that somebody's like oh wow they're in involved in that I don't know how many social media there's all kinds of programs or whatever and they'll be like if I don't get on every one of them then I will not I'm just going to be this stuck in a hole somewhere I I have a little business and they came out about 10 years ago and said if you don't run blogs you're you'll just go into Extinction so I'm like okay okay well then I realized all and like as we navigate forward like no I don't need to have that as brother B said don't judge things by what they appear judge them by what they manifest judge them by what they manifest so they tell me on the social media said look you can't get on there and be preachy you can't be and then it goes back to what brother random said he went to the garage he's preaching to the men around there and the guy come like hey you're welcome here Bill Brandon but we don't want your Jesus and he makes this amazing Revelation he said where my Jesus is not welcome I am not welcome amen and if God's empowered me to be a witness for God wherever I can't be a witness for God I probably don't need to be there oh come on into the bar and just sit down and can we talk about Jesus no you can't sit at a bar and talk about Jesus you got no get out then I probably it's kind of like music you know you go into the store and they're singing what is this some of this Lauren Deo stuff they can play it in the store and they uh you know it's um I am or whatever that song it stayed at the top of the charts forever and I went back and listened to like people like well they're singing about God well I don't know about that you go it sounds more like a girl that went to college and she failed her math test and they're going to kick her out of school and she's calling her mom and saying you say I am great you say I should stay in college and you see how the devil likes to play Both Sides likes to play both sides but you think you could sing uh uh um at the cross at the cross in in and in Walmart or the bar no because there's something about there's something about black and white there's something about black and white I say it's time that we get more over on the white side and I'm not talking racial I'm talking about Good and Evil the word of God and and sin let's just you know you how the prophet of God said if there's a question just get away from it there's a question just get away from it so we see people trying to play Both Sides like Judas hey I'm with the church and I'm out with the world we see so many of those musicians even around the message we see it trying to Kip into the message is coming under the guys brother said I like soul I like those colored people they can really sing you know what he was talking about he was talking about those people out in the in in in the patches singing Acappella and Aunt jamama is singing a song He said nobody could even compare he wasn't talking about the rock and roll and all the Jazz and the dancing and moving around that trying to creep into our message using the word the message to justify it it's not he talked about the rock and roll and the boogly woly in fact you watch this he saw the Church of of of America dancing to what kind of music rock rock and roll music you go back and look we my wife and I we went to the country the other day and all the little churches that are closed down and then you see the mega churches and they just can't get enough I was just like it just like and then you realize what do they have they have rock and roll music and rock and roll music so if you're the Methodist or that it's not going to work because the prophet of God it's a prophecy being fulfilled and say Lord they can take that whatever we don't want that rock and roll but boy we want the Holy Ghost and we want the inspir ation of the Holy Ghost now I believe in amen genres of music you know they they sang uh you know the the the the the hymns and I appreciate the hymns and brother Brandon was a Baptist is this okay you can get up behind me and correct if I'm wrong on Tuesday all right but brother B said they were teaching me that new song one of them if you're a Baptist you can't sing that because you believe if you raise your hand say accept Christ as my savior you believe you got the Holy Ghost that's what Baptists believe now they're singing I'm one of them they were gathered in the upper room the Holy Ghost fell upon them that's a Pentecostal song and the prophet of God is moving from a Baptist to a Pentecostal receiving the Holy Ghost there is power power wonderful working Power in the Blood of the lamb and the Holy Ghost now he is moving from one air to another air oh blessed be the name of the Lord we move from Pentecost to the word of God there should be a whole another genre of music coming I've been putting a lot of pressure on my son said hey son we don't need to deal with all this world stuff let's get back to amen there's power amen there's power in the name of Jesus Amen I heard from my theophany amen it wasn't that sister Lily's mother-in-law that wrote that song I my my my theophany I hear it hear it calling me sister Lily I think it was her mother-in-law sitting in a I think she was sitting on an assembly line she reached up and got a piece of paper and wrote it down I hear my the offy calling me and she got cancer and 5 years later God took her home but that inspiration was coming it's coming to a bride something keeps holding me and it's not me it's a predestinated seed I believe my name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation the world does that mean those people are perfect no but they realize their weaknesses and they go to Jesus Christ just like Moses did amen I just just quickly yall don't have clocks in here Lord help us we don't have time to go through it exactly but remember lot remember lot and Abraham they came to together there and it's an amazing scripture we don't have time for it this morning the Bible says that lot pitched his tent towards Sodom when he got up in the morning he opened it up and there was Sodom and that's what he saw may God help us today to not Pitch our tent towards Sodom and the things of the world and the movie stars and the music and what they call is is great the Bible says was the Corinthians there what man calls great God calls foolish what God calls great man calls foolish they take a woman a mother that's trying to raise her children try to stay keep a marriage together the Bible says marriage is Honorable the Bible says a a meek and quiet spirit is of great price in the sight of God and the world looks at it and say that's nothing that's just that worthless it has no value we need to come to the house of the Lord say Lord cleanse my mind let me be Washed by the Water of the word wash my mind of what this this world is saying that a woman should be or what a man should be should just be a puppet walking there talking about all the movies and people get involved in the movies and realize how they've demeaned the man to just be a little puppet that follows the lady around along the he goes out and works and brings home the paycheck so she can do whatever she wants to do to where a man rises up and becomes the head of the house creates a vision not a format but he creates a vision I was made in the image of God and that we got married because you loved my character maybe nobody sat down and talked to you about that we got married because you thought I was a Son of God and you married me and then you saw that character was so great that you said I want to produce more of that character on the earth and we had children you see if we get back and put marriage back the way it ought to be more couples realize that's the man of God we get married he'll be the head of the house and you'll be his helper and we'll love honor and cherish as long as we live and this is such a great thing we're going to produce more children to repopulate the Earth may God help us somebody broke marriage but it wasn't God wasn't a Christian it was the devil it was the devil say oh I'm so hurt it was the devil that caus that hurt we need to put the blame back where it was it was the devil somebody got away from Jesus Christ somebody got away from church are you with me somebody got away from the Holy Ghost and that's what's caused all those things it wasn't Christ God didn't cause the pain God didn't caus of suffering it was sin we need to call it for what it is God is the one always trying to draw us back Adam Adam where are the prodal the father running to the son I'm here to redeem you to bring you back to bring you back to fellowship with the father oh there's hurts there's pain that prodal had spent his reputation he had spent his so there was ramifications but he was back in fellowship with the father oh amen lot pitched his tent towards Sodom he went down there and the glamour of Sodom paralyzed his faith but there was a man called Abraham and he realized what was going to go happen down there and he didn't let it paralyze his Revelation he just he was kind of sequestered he was not in the mainstream of life he was kind of off somewhere amen but Sodom burn and sodom's going to burn amen I was thinking about Moses how the Bible says he saw him who was invisible so brother Ram takes that and why Christ speak and he Compares lot and he takes Abraham and he Compares Abraham who had all the glamour of the world but by Revel the Bible says he saw is can we let me just jump over there Hebrews chap 11 this is so powerful Hebrews chap 11 it says by Faith by Revelation Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction so don't think you're not going to suffer you're going to suffer we're all suffering man we could all be doing great things today and out in the world and doing things and have more money because hey six days shall all labor but what if you work seven days you can make a lot more money right oh but that's how what the devil says but that's not the way there's a day of rest that God sets it in there there's something more than money coming together and talking about our spiritual well-being so you had to see something right here he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season there it is the pleasures of sin but it's only for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect into the recompense of the reward by Faith by Revelation he forsook Egypt that's what that's what the prophet of God saying your revelation will paralyze the world or the world will paralyze you and you'll live in the pleasures of the world but you your faith will just diminish and die but I don't I want to be wise today I want to be a wise man he goes on to how Jesus say he that Hearth these things of mine and does them he's a wise man he that hears these things of mine and does him not he's a foolish man he goes on he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured seeing him who was invisible amen he was seeing something the Bible says young men will have a vision we young men we need to have a vision like hey I want a vision of a 100 years from now not 20 years from a 100 years from now we're all going to be somewhere and your Revelation today will decide what you do in your life like I'm going to keep going to church I'm going to keep loving the Lord I'm going to stay in this marriage I'm going to keep my heart in tune and refreshed and renewed and in the Holy Ghost and I'm going to come and when I do wrong I'm going to ask God to repent I'm going to repent ask God to forgive me I'm going to go on with God I'm not going to let this situation paralyze me I'm not going to sit along the the road of how many people we see maybe even around here you knew people years ago serve the Lord but they're just sitting along the road somewhere that flat tire anybody ever have a flat tire has all of us had a flat tire you had a and you sit along the road I'm not going to let the flat tire paralyzed me for my whole life I'm not going to paralyze uh you know I got a spare in the back and I'm big about spares I I don't go any there I got to have a spare I just brother Daniel it's just part of it but my one our audio guys text today said hey I'm I'm late my my my uh spare or my tire is fight I'm changing the tire I text him right back you need us to come help you I'm a long ways away but I'm going to find the resources that I need to go get that brother and get him to church and if I would do that as a brother what would our heavenly father do when you say hey I I've got a flat tire I'm paralyzed along the road if I would do that as a brother what would our heavenly father do you need some resources I'll send a brother over there in prayer I'll send a sister over there you'll get a text in just a couple of minutes as our brother was going through something in his life and he God dealing on both God deals on both ends and something happened brother R Sean said I'm feeling this way and in the same day he gets a text and God begins to move something in a dick in in a certain direction this is bigger than you and me God knows what he's doing as brother bam said the wheels are turning right just right just get in the turn maybe you're paralyzed today and God says look you need to amen you need to get this change right here but I'm sending the Holy Ghost I'm sending a minister that doesn't even know and God is orchestrating all of this and he's going to change the situation he's going to heal your memory he's going to heal your reasoning well I thought it should have gone this way by golly I'm just like and we act like five-year-olds like hey Lord not this is your problem this is your problem a sister called me the other day it was a situation going back home and and we're back and forth she's like what do I do what I I said sister this is a man problem you just need to turn your phone off and let men handle this and I got on the phone and we started doing the man thing right the man is the protector and somewhere you sisters say hey this is a man thing this is a deacon thing this is let the pastor handle that this I'm going to stay in my Lane let the pastor be the pastor we get computers in the and the and we want to start sending quotes back and forth but the pastor he's got all those quotes too he can do that and he's praying and seeking God like you need to whip Johnny yeah I know I need to whip Johnny and I'll Whip Johnny at the right time when the Holy Spirit when it's all right when you need to go tell your wife man we're down in the Weeds now remember brother brother Ram's wife she slams the door he goes out washes the car Angel lord said you go tell her to read about maram he goes back in knocks on the door I've got and he said he just went back out and he had learned even though he had the word of the Lord there was a time and a place that the word of the Lord was spoken in the right way may the Lord help us today to pray to pray let's talk about a couple things 1 Corinthians chapter 10 let me just when the Deacon stands up in the back does that mean I'm supposed to close is it is that what that means all right let me just read a couple more verses I don't know he stood up back there so I don't let me read this ver all right 1 Corinthians 10:13 but there is no temptation taken you but such is common to man that's where the Devil comes and says you're the exception you have a chemical imbalance so therefore you can justify doing this you are not normal this is and the devil will but the Bible says that there's no temptation but it's common to man people have went through this before Satan studied human nature for 6,000 years or 7 billion people I hate to tell you that but you're not unique in that way Temptation the devil's studying now we are unique in the way God's working us and molding us stay with me right here so he says there but he's common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be attempted above that you're able aren't you thankful for that verse like really God really really really and then that verse says he's never going to sink you your trouble test didn't come to destroy you they came to make you stronger I'll say it again your trials didn't come to destroy you they came to make you stronger some of your boys they lift weights here they have what they call you um lift to failure and so you do your reps and you can just do a bunch of reps you're just wearing your muscles down but really you're building your muscle is when you're just are straining and that's what God is trying to do us to find that place and he said I'm never going to put more on you than you're able to bear I'm so thankful for that verse said Lord you must have a lot of confidence in me because I do not know how I can you ever get to that place like Lord I don't know how I'm going to get through this and God loves to create situations that are bigger than you that you can't figure out so that he can prove that he's God that he's the Creator you say the doctors say this and this is a but he's the creator that created your body and he wants to show that he's God and I'm the Healer of all of your sick well the doctor healed me and God wants to do away with that when the doctor says there's no more hope than God said I'm the god that heals your sicknesses I'm the god that does your and it might be your memory infection brother Daniel I've got this memory and it just totally paralyzes me I've got this reasoning and this should have happened in the church and that should have happened years ago and I am right and then God wants to heal that and say yeah but I'll fix that but maybe not just right now we had a situation in our church I don't know why I'm saying this it just came up there was a problem in the church and there's a brother there and I think I was a deacon or I was a minister and he come to me and and and he left the church and then two weeks the whole problem was fixed I'm like brother if you just stuck around first you were right and I was wrong or the church was wrong you could have helped us you could have helped us if you if you got if you got something that'll help me maybe maybe you know something that'll help me not get to close those Edge you're like Hey Brother Daniel if you'll just uh put wear a parachute all the time like hey that's a good idea if I jump off there I can pull the parachute and go to maybe you got something but if you don't come help me how are we going to you know there's strength being together amen the devil wants to separate us but we stay together and you help me and you pray for me and as the one brother said I got I think it was brother um Homer longor he said he got a kidney stone like are you believing for God he said I'm not believing for anything I need something to take away this pain yeah oh that's carnal man thing well you what about having a baby like my wife said she having a baby and some the brother like pray with her like I'm watch that monitor right there I don't know if you all pray between those things you're going through something you need somebody else to pray amen that's why the Bible says lay hands on the sick because maybe you get to the place I don't have any more faith I'm paralyzed I'm paralyzed but I think brother BR went through that in his ministry he said he just sat on the porch and then was it FF Bosworth send him that little thing of faith and it and it shook him out of that thing and maybe the holy spirit will shake us out of wherever that is with our flat tire you feel like you know what my life my spiritual life isn't doing anything I'm just sitting along the road and everybody's shouting and going on serving God but that's okay the holy spirit is coming by this morning to heal us of all of our diseases of all of our sicknesses whether it's in your flesh or it's in your conscience in that Spirit realm say Lord fix me today Lord Heal me today Lord You're My Healer you promis to be my healer heal me today Lord let my faith paralyze this world Lord blessed be the name of the Lord so we know that no nothing that we can't I like this part but but will with the Temptation make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear if you look at go back in that study that word make a way of Escape it's actually create God will create a away Moses had no precedent brother Sean when he got to the Red Sea and two mountains amen Red Sea they they just camp out like hey this is really we'll just fit but now we got an army Pharaoh's the greatest army of the world is coming to destroy them and he starts crying to God like I can't do this I say there's no there's no um there's no uh problem is saying I I can't do this there's actually as a minister we it's funny as ministers sometimes like hey people don't come for help anymore is it okay if I share from the ministry side sometimes and so it's you have Ministry you got a phone hey you can call me 24/7 it sits by my bed text me D but nobody calls and nobody like it's like a and you're like hey how you doing hey I'm doing great I'm like and I tell you from the minister side it's like a somebody having a head- on collision lay along the road they're bleeding out you know they only got so many pints of blood and they're bleeding how you doing hey I'm doing great like you're not doing great you just got a couple more services and you're done you just got a couple more rebellious attitudes towards the word of God and rejecting the word of God and your attitude because you're sick in your reason you're sick in your affection are you with me today and so as a min it's a hard thing to say look do you realize that you need to realize you're in a you're in a crisis you're in a crisis your marriage is in a crisis your mind is in a crisis you need to get into the emergency room hey I got an ambulance right here we'll turn the lights on we'll get you into a place where people can help you when they can lay hands on you and cast out Devils I believe in casting out devils and man we come you know we maybe we've been raised in the message I have all my life so I don't know I went to a camp one time brother Sean they said we don't want you to preach doc we just want you to preach about Jesus I'm like okay I'm sorry I was raised in the message I don't know what Doctrine is and what just Jesus is it's all the same it revealed Christ to me right so if you're going to ask me preaching on predestination or there's no eternal hell or infilling of the holy spirit is not just an emotion it's the Life of Christ and where is that Doctrine and where it's all one and the same it's Jesus it's the word of God made flesh today blessed be the name of the Lord let me get back on track here so God Will Make A Way the Red Sea he made a way no scripture for it brother Sean no scripture and God Made A Way amen that little woman there when she didn't have any more meal and this and there was she said I'm going to die and God was asking for something out of his life and she said I can't do this I can't give the message of the hour that he said that's okay put God first you'll never go hungry amen amen God Will Supply your needs through the famine God will take care of you David said I was once young now I'm old I've never seen the righteous is forsaking bread amen just think about this give me a minute let's go through a couple people Noah he was a farmer but God needed a tool yeah to be a boat Manu manufacturer to make a boat and God made a tool listen to me because we're living in lady sea and God needs somebody to be a witness and there's nobody there so he's making a witness he needed something done in Noah's day he got a man who was not qualified and made him the tool to fulfill God's will will Gideon the guy was hiding the angel comes to empower him he's hiding behind the wine press like hey Gideon you're a mighty man of all and he's like somebody else here what me me like I'm hiding I'm hiding no you're a mighty man of Val God's looking at his potential and then God takes this man with 300 men and destroys all of the uh the midianites that are out there with a little uh picture and they they just went and they f are you with me today God made the tool sure he did Elijah here's a man he's out there and you know he's fearless and he's bold and calling fire out of heaven and such a man and then a woman com and said hey I'm going to destroy you by this time tomorrow you're going to be like the 400 priest and he runs and he hides and he's in a cave and he's hiding down there and hiding in the cave for was it 40 days and he got some Mana that sustain him and you see how God is making that tool making that man the way he ought to be now the devil give you misconceptions like hey you're always going to be perfect or you'll never have a suicide thought well that wasn't job I think job said he cursed the day he was born and Elijah the same way went through that dark time depression you see what the devil does he tries to go to the doctor and get this and and give it give it a little but actually it was something he was going listen to me he was going through something in his life that God wanted to have a deeper relationship with him in the depression that he was in amen I don't doubt the depression is real the prophet of God lost his wife and lost baby and went through a very dark time but out of that dark time it birthed a great inspiration to the world in fact when his baby's eyes crossed brother Ram says that that not one baby that came across the platform ever went across with crossed eyes because there was such a compassion listen to me it was such a compassion welded in that man by the pits of his weakness God made something great to show the strength of God to the world and you might have a weakness but it might be that weakness that causes you to be humble and say Lord I can't do this without you Lord I cannot stay in this marriage and be the right kind of a wife if you don't help me and then God comes and empowers you and then it becomes a beautiful thing that you fulfilled that scripture marriage is Honorable you realize I couldn't make marriage honorable it was God in Me that made marriage honorable blessed be the name of the Lord is this okay I was thinking about my father brother brandham came and was the voice you believe that Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel that's why we don't have a lot of videos the Bible say it was the days of the voice they had the cameras and I don't know if you know the history brother Perry green went to Australia and found the video deep call The Depot and and those um films uh and he said hey can I take those America came back and duplicated made a copy of them basically stole them and gave them back theirs and now we have the film but it was a scripture in the days of the voice because brother Sean if we had had that there's something about video that you would like hold your finger like this tip your hat carry your Bible a certain way and we'd all become mimics but now we don't have people that are mimics ministers that are mimic of William bram's actions but we have a voice a message and a people are mimics of the revelation of the word of God isn't that good in the days of the voice it's fanatic there's a voice in the days of the voice when he shall begin to sound so brother brandom he brought the message and my father had a Ministry of transcribing it from the voice to text so he spent 35 years at the voice of God the spoken word together with brother Roy borders and and making the the the text and then after people stopped using the books they took that text scanned it and put it into the table app if you use the table app it was my father for 35 years amen was meticulously going through that and and and making the text that now so many people all around the world are are using it's a blessing to me I it's a blessing you know brother Joseph brandham if he came through that door and brother brandham dedicated him in the message I think it's enticing Spirits he uses the word blessing five times let him be a blessing and if he walked through the door I'd say God bless you Brother Joseph your life has been a blessing to the bride of Christ all around the world so my father had a when he was 16 years old have I told this will you give me just a few more minutes I'm showing you how God made a tool he was SE 16 years old he was at a in rais Pentecostal he was going into the bathroom one day at a convention I know I'm talking real fast but I'm trying to so a man comes out and he prophesies and says you'll have a Ministry they go to Every Hamlet and Village of the world and it's kind of like David being anointing like okay I don't know what that means I'll go back so my father just went back about his life and it wasn't until almost he retired brother Shawn that he realized that that was brother random was the voice and he was the text to Brother Rands transcribing it from the voice to text and his message was going to every Hamlet and Village of the world and God used him but God created it a tool so if you ever met my father he's very like everything's by the book right it has to be right and so a little bit when you're with him in his personality that's just the way he was and it was a little bit hard because we're human and not everything's perfect but he had to be like everything your tees are crossed your eyes are dotted because let me just say this I was thinking about this example if you said uh let's eat John okay if you put a comma let's eat comma John but if you say let's eat John you're going to consume John so punctuation does become very important right let's eat John yeah hey there's a guy named John we're all going to eat but you take the com out let's eat John let's eat him yeah and then you put an exclamation at the end let's eat John and so you find out that that punctuation changes y'all are laughing I got you right there so then my father was so meticulous because you change one little thing and the I think there's one of the message unveiling of God brother Ram said that Prophet comes down and Right Moves right into the and brother Ram says phase and people brother R says phrase and it was phase and these brothers are debating back and forth if because if he moved into a phrase or if he's the phase that the prophet is the phase he is actually then we'd worship the prophet so every one of those punctuations and words became very important that we study on our table app people changing their lives and brother B's talking about the length of the skirt or can I dye my hair and those things only become important when they become important so every word became and so God created a tool amen for that specific job now God's created you for a job he's created you for a job there's some of these men that are so broken that it takes a lifetime to fix them say we've been married 20 years and he's still not right well hang with hang with him hang with him keep working on him maybe 30 years you'll get some of those things worked out Moses like I can't he got to the place he wasn't and know it all oh it's so hilarious to watch God he'll take extreme a woman that's over here and a man over here he'll just tie them right together and it's just like no it's until death do we part so yeah somewhere we got to figure this out and by the way we got kids so we really got to figure this out somebody came the other day we're sitting in the office I hope this is okay they're sitting like hey there's nobody that can love your kids like you all I can't love them like you all I can try to provide for them but I can't love them like you and tuck them in bed and feel their head if they're so there's no better tool to be a parent than you than you and so we see a society where marriage is falling down and God in Sunday school now it's all falling down so they have a whole foster care uh thing to pick up the pieces of something that that the devil not God the devil came in and just can you see that I I I believe in the foster care of friends that that work on that and I'm all for that but when you see hey you're dealing with the symptom the cause is somewhere we let Christ go out of our society we let God go out of and sometimes we as parent grandparents say like hey I made mistakes with my children but I'm going to pick it back up in my grandchildren and be the best grandparent I can be there there's something about I think I said this when I was here last time there's something about being a grandp there's an age I don't know where it is it's like 60 70 80 where you can say anything and people just got to deal with it I told this when I think was here and I got on that airplane that lady said Merry Christmas to everybody and I'm too old to care if I offend anybody on this airplane so there's just something about when you're an older grandfather grandmother praise God Jesus Christ is the Son of God that came into the world to die for our sins and this home is a Christian home and if you don't like it you don't have to eat turkey dinner with us but we're going to pray and thank God for his blessings there's just something in there like okay that's just Grandma yeah that's just Grandma but she's preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ God has made you as the best grandma to your family that anybody else could ever be I say God Empower me well I made mistakes we've all made mistakes but Lord let my weakness not let it not paralyze me Let It energize me Lord let the Holy Ghost come today and energize me in my weakness Lord may your strength and your gospel be propelled in the world blessed be the name of the Lord I didn't have all the time to get all the quotes together but brother Ram said that every person is like a bell yeah and he said it has a certain Ting you probably I'm sure your pastors read the quote I'm trying to find a little pen here so if I have a little this glass if I Ting this listen so that has a Ting that has a Ting this has a ting and it has a different ring to it doesn't it if I hit it on here it's a different ring but brother brandom said that God bred this one to this one and this one to this one and this one to this one to get you so that you would be the right kind of a witness to your generation and God would take this person and this person and come together and have a union these two people and come down so it had this certain ring like ring ring go to church love your husband train up a child in the way you should go and it has this ring as the Bride of Jesus Christ say but brother Daniel I'm flawed that doesn't worry about the flaw ring ring for the Lord be the say I got a weakness that's okay let God let your weakness say Lord I need you to be the right kind of a ring to my generation blessed be the name of the Lord I've got so many things I'm just going to skip over I had something out of the church age book but we're running a little short on time I was thinking how that the Bible says in him we live move and have our being Psalms 119 let me read this verse Psalms 119 just reading this 119 verse 81 the Bible said my soul fth for thy salvation but I hoped in thy word verse 87 said they had almost consumed me upon the Earth this is Psalms 119: 87 they had almost consumed me you ever feel like that in your life man they have almost consumed me oh that's weak brother no I had a prophet that he got audited anybody's been through a tax audit brother Brandon went through a tax audit and they got him on the phone and again and again he said I can't do this anymore and he you remember his wife and said tell him I'm not in here he's almost consumed I cannot mental what was the problem in his body no his body was fine but his memory was like I can't do this anymore somewhere in his Spirit realm he is imagine I imagine they're just going to he said that he said I can't imagine another afternoon and so he causes him to go and not be the man that he should and that's where David was thy they have almost consume me but I forsook not thy precepts so the prophet made a mistake Under Pressure he tells his wife say hey tell tell him I'm not in here and she comes back said but you were in here when he called so he went back and he made it right the angel of the Lord wouldn't let him do that is it right if I stop right here and talk about the cloud have we talked about that at all so when brother Brandon was there and he tells him like okay they're in here somebody calls he goes out says tell them I'm not in here I'm not in here and he comes back in say like well I'm going to there's a sick baby so he goes down to pray for the baby and the angel of the Lord says you can't pray for that baby because you told something that wasn't true he goes back and makes it right he comes back and praise for the baby and God heals the baby baby's completely healed it's a miracle right because God has to have the vessel the channel clear and the message standing in the Gap brother Ram talks about the cloud I think I saw the picture down brother Sean I know your pastor believe talks about the cloud that was in Arizona brother R said I was caught up in that consolation Angels come said go back to Jeffersonville and preach the Seven Seals people criticize brother Bram so in the message standing in the Gap brother brandham talks about the cloud picture at the end of the message not a sick baby but brother wayy Falls dead on this side of the church my father-in-law s was sitting right behind him when he fell fall he falls dead right behind him his wife was a registered nurse what do registered nurse nurses do when something happens they begin CPR she didn't CPR she reaches to brother random said brother random he's passed away you can listen to the tape staying in the Gap brother random goes down and pray he just walks down and and begins and when he started to pray for the baby the angel of the Lord didn't say you can't pray for that man because you said something that wasn't right about the cloud are you with me God doesn't change his nature right so before he said something that was a little and the angel of the Lord wouldn't let him let him pray for that baby now this man is not sick he's dead so it takes God almighty God to give this man back life and the angel Lord said you pray for that man because what you said about the cloud is true and what you said about the cloud is right and I'm going to raise this man for the dead vindicating your ministry and he raised him from the dead and I'm here to say I'm not going to let that paralyze me what the world says I say if it's good enough for God what he said it's good enough for me if it's good enough for God he would hear his prayer to answer to raise the man from the dead then it's good enough for me in my life oh don't let the devil paralyze your faith amen just let the Holy Spirit Come and heal your reasoning this morning he's a dissolver of all doubts that's what happened when Daniel came in the Bible the Bible says there's a man and he's a dissolver of doubts and that man is the prophet the holy ghost that can discern and dissolve all the doubts that we have faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God and that's what he said in this verse I was almost consumed verse 88 he said Quicken me after thy loving kindness for so shall I keep thy testimonies amen I was thinking about that as we close that how the devil would love to consume you he'd love to destroy destroy you and there comes the Lord's been dealing with me a couple things about the grace of God we come to the place you all are listening so intently I'm trying to close seriously in but do you know how hard it is to get people to listen to The Gospel brother brandom talks about we've studied church history I've got the church age book in the beginning of this book is this okay brother Sean this isn't in any of my notes see this church age brother random draws us on the wall of the back of his church and so we come into this missionary age where there's so many believers they cancel up in in in New England they cancel the the police force they just dismiss them because everybody were Christians they didn't they didn't need to pleas for Law and Order because the Holy Ghost was bringing Law and Order and some of them finny and Knox and those people they would just get up and preach on the street people just fall down and give their hearts to the Lord that was a day that they lived it was amazing brother R said it was the tossel age the missionary age listen to me so when in our church I'm all over the place this morning but you all are listening so closely we live in a day we had security bad part of Louisville and we stuck a speaker out on the street so that when cuz I was a deacon we rotated the deacons you had to watch the cars and make sure they didn't break in and steal stuff they did so many times so we put the Deacon out there like I'm not sitting out here and backsliding so I run a wire out the thing and put a speaker out there so for two years we had the speaker blaring out on the streets of Louisville listen to me not one person not one person came off the street and heard the gospel and came inside and give their heart to the Lord why do I believe this message because it's the truth it's the revelation of the word of God back in this day they just heard and they came and just fell zeusa Street study zeusa Street they come to isusa Street and they say hey look I don't know the Holy Spirit fail there's people a block away and they're falling out in the spirit they don't even know what it is they get off the train and just fall out the Holy Spirit was being poured out God was doing something Sovereign and was at the fifth seal brother Ram said the church can do nothing but respond to the anointing that comes in that day so in in in the tossel age they just responded and the missionary age and then and then but now I tried to reproduce the missionary age and it didn't happen it's like Lord how what how do I live I go back to the revelation of the message and I see oh this is what it is and right in the last day it's just very very dark brother M said I think it was uh recognizing your day in the message he said it went into total darkness he said I put a little bit of light there to represent those people down in that one city at brother Sea's Church there a little bit of a light of people and then when God's got God's going to take him out in a Rapture and it'll go into total chaos so when you sit here and listen I say Lord that is not natural that is Supernatural the Bible says no man can come except the father draws him there's something in your heart that gave you a desire to go to the house of the Lord when churches are closing and they they just are like ah it was be over in 20 minutes preach 20 minutes or the deacons go no there's something in your heart is saying Lord I want to be like you Lord I don't want to be paralyzed I don't want my testimony paralyzed Lord I want you to make even in my weakness Lord I want you to be glorified I want to be a better grandmother we got Thanksgiving coming up and maybe haven't done it last Thanksgiving but I'm going to stop this whole show and say look before we pray I'm going to say and give thanks to Jesus Christ who is the provider every good gift comes from above I'm going acknowledge this Thanksgiving meal came from Jesus Christ didn't come from our wallets it came from Jesus Christ is that good this church came from Jesus Christ every good gift brother Shawn is Straight from Heaven how can you say that our sister play every good gift comes from above from the Father of Lights in whom there's no VAR remember brother bisco and his testimony and they're sitting along L I don't know if you've heard the testimony they're sitting there brother Bisal is sitting with brother R they're sitting along the angel of the Lord comes down and they're just paralyzed they're just paralyzed I think another time in the car and they're just paralyzed and then after a few minutes it goes away brother Brandon looks at brother bisco and says every time he comes something good happens praise God every time we go to church amen line upon line word upon word amen here a little there God's adding Amen to the body to the image of Jesus Christ oh but brother Daniel I don't know I just really rub but no but God's perfecting something in you well I don't know I go to church as soon as I drive in I think of that situation where she stole the recipe from me and she's making those cookies and taking the glory or she gave me that recipe and she left two of those ingredients out intentionally she knows she rocked my whole world I ruined our family thing it's called sabotage I didn't realize sisters were so like that's my recipe like it's just letters on her no that's me I make macaroni this way every time I go to church I think there's her car we ought to just go I've been around a long time all right I know how the devil works I know how the devil works and somewhere in your mind you got to say I'm not going to let this paralyze me you got to go back to basics I'm going to drive in I'm going to park my car and I'm going to get up and I'm going to go in that church I'm going to sing the songs and raise my hands and worship Jesus Christ I'm going to let the word of God speak to me and I'm going to go home a better Christian and I'm not going to let the devil and the mind battles come in and say I'm just oh they're there let's just turn on kids coughing yeah let's get them out let's no God help us to be mature Sons and Daughters of God that shows character am character isn't a victory hey here here's some character no Lord I overcome that thing I was sick you know the baby's got ready over stay home I understand it some but hey I'm sick in my spirit but I'm still a Christian I'm sick in my memory I got some bad memories my finger hurts right there have I showed you the scar in my arm I you all we're going to be family we get done with this thing see the scar in my arm I took a radiator cap off your brother you know your car used to overheat you took the r it burnt your arm it burnt my arm I have a scar in my life I don't show that to everybody right now you all are really close to me you know the guy's just close to Edge takes radiar caps off but I have a memory I have a memory I'm not going to do that anymore I'm not going to do that anymore and sometimes in our weakness we get too far from the shepherd and we do something's wrong and we get a scar and I'm not taking that radiator cap off anymore I'm not going over there anymore I'm not staying home from church I'm not taking a 5-year detour from the house of God sometimes we get relationship like fine and you realize I'm not going to do fine to God cuz I need him I need him he's my provider I cannot do without him and I am what I am by the grace of God and if God takes his hand off me I'm done I'm just done or maybe there's something that's powerless that you're powerless before I don't know we wrestle not against flesh and blood I don't more and more it's not the guy with the AK-47 or the person with the axe it's demon powers the other day I went into my barn and this demon power came in there and I I was just like God I'm not going to tell you what it is because you'll think less of me just like you think you L somebody jumping on not tell you hey no brother brandom and Jesus was tempted to jump and like okay brother yeah Jesus like so this demon power you you the Bible says in the one place they are taken captive at his will you see these school shootings little 14-year-old boy they're just a vessel we're all vessels and the devil says I'll take him captive good boy take out and kill these people and they're like hey Johnny don't do that what did I just do that's why a lot of times they commit suicide themselves The Devils take them captive and then they come out like what have I done and they take their own life but what about people being full of the Holy Spirit and Mama sitting down with Johnny and talking to him greater love hath no man than a man lay down his life for his friend and you have a pastor there's no greater love than he would study and come out and lay his life down and say I'm giving my life for the Sheep Lord we think oh hanging on a cross that's one Christ did that we don't need a pastor to hang on a cross right but to give a heartbeat you only have so many heartbeats in this life and when a man go sits in an office and gets down on his knees and he prays said Lord what would you have me to speak to those people he's giving his life yes he is and the Bible says there's no greater love than a man lay down his life and give his life give his heartbeats for the Sheep that's love well I thought if he called me every day and every Monday I got a text at at 8:30 I got that word of encouragement from our pastor and he was just a real socializer but that's not he's laying down his life for the Sheep aren't you glad for the Bible like oh that's a real Pastor that that's a real evidence of love the Lord remember brother brandom said he said I was powerless till the he realized his weakness remember the other time greatest battle ever fought brother random Nelly Sanders comes up knocks in his door running in Oh Brother random i' sin and sin and he brings him in maybe he's got the drunk man in there he helped the drunk person like what have you done he said I was coming down the street and there was that bar and I just stop for a minute that's what happens sometimes we stop for a minute and said I was in the dance room and I oh I've send away my she comes running in brother said I I was just young CH I didn't know about devils and surrendering to them then he said well let's just pray and so he said he started praying all of a sudden this bat come up comes up with hairs and started going around and what' brother random do he say I'm Malachi 4 are you get no no he said blood of Jesus Christ protect me from that thing and the prophet of God realized he's no match for this demon that has just come out of this girl but in his weakness amen he told a story how he appealed to Jesus Christ I'm telling the story 60 years later of how a man surrendered himself to Jesus Christ and the strength of Jesus Christ is being manifested here this morning because he showed me his weakness I'm weak but he's strong and he him telling that story I'm telling it today that Christ is Manifest greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world amen amen I'm skip over what I had in this I'm going to read this little plaque here if it's okay and then I'm going to close God wants eaglets he wants Messiahs he wants men and women who have signs and wonders anointed ones I think it's page 16 in the church age book if my memory serves me correct brother Ram said Mark 16 is the only true church I think he said Mark 16 in action in action is the only true church so we can have a Church website we can have paty pews we can have all the bells and whistles but if we don't have in my name they shall cast out how's it these signs will follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen if they take up any deadly thing that's Mark 16 in action that's the true church the only true church and brother B said he wants a church that's filled with the Holy Ghost a church reflecting him the same yesterday to day and forever God don't die he just borned a kingdom got his Messiahs in it amen every words he says they say Amen to it can you say Amen to the word of God amen amen to the word of God he said that's right they look at like him they act like him they believe it they got the conductor moving right on with signs and wonders following that's the messiah messiah living tonight he isn't dead he's alive forever more he's alive inside you and me brother Daniel but I'm flawed yeah but it's your weakness that shows his strength because if you had great talents well look at that brother pre like no no he he can't he does he has all these and I can tell you I got a list don't worry about finding my mistakes I got the list made I'll just give it to you say save you the time and the trouble the other day we were talking I had preached somebody said look you there's three things in your sermon glad you got something out of the service you know how's the Bible say henceforth we know no man after the flesh so when brother brandham says that Moses built the ark I don't argue with brother brandham because I don't know him by the flesh I know him by Revelation I know that Noah built the ark and Moses brought the people out amen did I tell about the text I got from my pastor I'm going to try to close Okay I read the plaque I got a text here a couple months ago my pastor was on vacation I was in charge of the church trying to help and I got a text from him like um can you help me like okay my pastor doesn't text much he just calls I'm like that's really odd and then there like somebody's in the hospital with cancer I'm like okay he probably wants me but he would have called me and then I got a thing I need you to go get some um Apple um what's the Apple the iTunes I need you to go get some iTunes gift cards so that we can take it up to her and give her in the hospital I'm like that's not my pastor that's but it had it had my name Daniel I need you to help and I'm like how in the world so um I was you know I didn't text back or or no he when they first text I text him right back okay hey account help how can I help you I need you to get get some iTunes gift card I'm like my pastor doesn't even know what iTunes is he would not he would call me and and he would tell me to go up there and pray for the person not get them iTune gift cards and that's where I realize sometimes you don't know listen to me what technology what the devil can throw in front of you and maybe even fake to be like someone else that's where the Bible says henceforth know we know man after the flesh but we know them by revelation we know them by Spirit listen we're at Sunday school the holy spirit's teaching us they say on the phones when somebody calls you in the scammer in three seconds they can build a database of your voice yeah and with that data boys they can fake to be your grandchild they did it with my son my grandson they called my grandfather and said hey this is William and and I need some money my father-in-law hung up the phone like what a great-grandfather you are you didn't even insert didn't even call us to say hey is it true that we like no that's a scammer like you didn't even check on your family but they can build this say hey you're they just had a car wreck and they need your credit card to do and so we say look henceforth know we no man after the flesh but we know them by Revelation amen I don't care if you take brother Sean's voice and build a thing and and come out with this private thing of him saying this and this I know his Revelation I know he G he's given his life for the message of the hour are you with me and the church you can take and and fake like his voice said this this this but I know him I know his Revelation he's given his life for this message he's given what about you if they if they were to come in there and and get people and persecute them for being a Christian would they have enough evidence to prosecute you about it like I go to church I send a check over there that's my ti but do you is there enough evidence that yeah they went to church sometimes you get in your car and your thing says here's the directions to so and so and I'm like wow even technology that's tracking me realizes every Sunday I go to church I have a life I have a how's the Bible says be a pattern of Good Works amen God's strength is made perfect in our weakness I'm just going to close is that all right shared a lot of weaknesses I've got a whole bunch more weaknesses we're like family now right all right you can't share my weaknesses but God knows what but flesh that's what the Bible says he knows that we're flesh they talk about this Ai and writing reports that kids like hey I can write a and it's perfect they come back like no this isn't a human because it's perfect so how do you smart it you do a couple verb tenses and misspell some words and you trick AI right but I think if God wanted perfect Christians he could have created robots he didn't want a robot that okay just feed this in and I'll come out and be the person that you tell me to be he didn't want a robot he wanted he wanted somebody that would love him somebody that had a relationship with it amen he comes into the garden said look at this beautiful paradise and hey don't touch this tree and he didn't stand there with the stick he just turned and walked away and left them because he wanted to build a relationship with his children and when they made a mistake he didn't kill them he come back and redeemed them sure they died to the day with the Lord is as a thousand years so he did the day that you eat thereof that day you die so every man in the Bible died within a thousand years right so the scripture was fulfilled but by their soul God made a way back that he could have fellowship with the son and that's what he's wanting he's not wanting robots this morning he's not wanting people that are perfect he's wanting a people that love him they ask him what is the great commandment just love the Lord with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind and when you come to that place you realize lord I can't do what you're asking me to do I say that's not failure that's success the Lord if phoh if Moses has just stood there and they Pharaoh's Army had come and killed them all we the Bible would be written different but when he cried and said Lord I I can't do this I can't deliver this God's strength was made perfect in moses' weakness and we come to the place say Lord I can't be a Christian I can't make it and I don't know if you've ever come to that place in your life life to maybe your weaknesses and maybe maybe you're a super Christian but some of us aren't all right and I'm not a superch Christian I'm one that needs Christ and maybe it's just because I have so many weaknesses that I have to walk close to the Lord and say Lord I need you and I can't make it without you and I didn't get this far just because I was raised at the brandom Tabernacle and and the Lord made me a preacher that that's nothing it's Christ and if he leaves us we're nothing amen and when God brings you to that I say that's not failure that's a great Revelation to say Lord I need you and I can't make it without you amen and I am only here today because of you I would not be here today can you say that even I wouldn't be a Christian today the the back along the way there's too much sickness brother Sean too many disappointments of life if it hadn't been for Christ I wouldn't be here today and so I hold his hand I say Lord I am what I am by your grace and Lord don't take don't take your Holy Spirit from me Lord amen let's just bow our heads together as the musicians come Heavenly Father Lord I've delivered my heart today and Lord I didn't have all these weaknesses that I would share but Lord I we're human you said that you know that we are but flesh and Lord we need you today I need you Lord ministers need you Lord as your Prophet said we not only have to live it but we have to preach it too I pray that you would strengthen the ministry here today Lord the brother Shawn and the other brothers Lord and the deacons and the trustees and the musicians and the Sunday School teachers Lord I pray that you would strengthen us this would be a day of encouragement Lord when we come to a place that we can't make it anymore that little song Mercy rewrote my life Lord when we can't make it anymore and you say I can't do this Lord then you're strength is made perfect in our weakness father I wonder with our heads bowed if there be somebody here say brother Daniel you're somehow the Holy Spirit speaking my language today and I just want to say that I'm weak this morning and you'd like to lift your hand say I'm weak God bless you I'm weak God bless you God bless you God bless you amen maybe you're hey you can be weak for a long time but Moses had two mountains beside him had a red sea and had an army that's coming and said Lord I'm really weak he been begin to cry to God say God help me God save me and we have a story today of a great Victory because a man admitted that he was weak and he began to cry to God I say there's great strength and turning from our own human abilities and turning to God and say Lord you need to help me father I can't stay in this marriage anymore Lord unless you help me and in my weakness and my admission amen that God can come and strengthen me and the glory of my marriage amen can go on maybe you got teenagers you say Lord I can't raise these children anymore Lord I need you father to give me strength and I if there's any glory in our family it'll become be because of the strength of the Holy Spirit moving through our family yes Lord Jesus maybe there's somebody sick in your spirit today say brother Daniel my imagination oh my reasoning today my affections just are sick and you'd like to raise your hand say I need a Healer today I need a Healer God bless you God bless you yes God knows what we're going through amen God bless you mom say I got a memory back there it paralyzes me but in my weakness I pray that the Holy Spirit would strengthen me today Heavenly Father you see the hands that have been raised and I pray father the word of God has been spoken and Lord to edify the body of Christ to encourage us Lord along this road that we're in Father Lord you know all things you put all things together just right father maybe someone streaming will come back and watch this Lord I pray that somewhere they would get down on their knees and say Lord Jesus help me I'm weak Lord I've failed I've done wrong but Lord may your strength the the Forgiveness of sins Lord be exemplified and lifted up Lord in my weakness may you cleanse us you said if we forsake our sins you would bless us Lord we would Prosper Lord forgive us of our sins pour the Holy Ghost back inside of us Lord let
