hallelu glory to the God who changed my life and I will praise you I'll worship you I'll give you glory forever because I am free cuz I am whole and I will tell everyone I know you thought I was worth saving amen are you glad you he thought you was worth the price amen the musicians can be dismissed amen it is good to be here tonight I count it an honor and a privilege to be here and speak to you tonight but um if we could turn to our Bibles to uh Proverbs verse 31 or chapter 31 amen proverbs 31 verse 10 I'm actually in the wrong one uh let see here Proverbs thought I was there sorry all right proverbs 31 and 10 it says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies amen amen if we could also turn turn to John 15 you man her price is far above rubies John 15 verse 16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go for uh bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that's where that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it to you amen you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you there's a terrible ring up here amen can we just bow our heads for a moment dear heavenly father Lord we love you and we thank you Father Lord for just such a beautiful day today Lord and Lord allowing us to come once again in your presence Lord to to serve you once more father and Lord we ask that you would just have your way tonight father I pray that you would just bless the the hearer and the receiver father Lord I pray that you would just help me to get myself out of the way and speak through me tonight Lord is our prayer Lord we love you we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you can be seated um it's very simple tonight I'm I'm definitely not a a um a deep speaker so so you've all heard it before um but I pray that it can be a a blessing to you and um but I got to thinking of that scripture um who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies and um I'm not going to speak on marriage and divorce or anything like that tonight um but I would like to maybe speak tonight about how valuable you are how valuable what kind of value you have tonight and I know it you know might be a strange topic but I'd like to maybe title it Priceless and um but hopefully you know it would make sense tonight um but I am going to uh go slow so if you would just bear with me tonight um hopefully I won't keep you too long but um you know as I was thinking um virtuous woman her price is far above rubies and it's very important that when a man goes to choose a wife would he uh that he would choose a wife that the Lord had picked out for him and one with Godly character one he can love unconditionally and her with him and uh a woman can be the best thing that he's ever had outside of Salvation or she can be like water in his blood um and I got to thinking about that in a spiritual standpoint that God has a bride picked out for himself and he's not going to choose a bride that might be untrue to his word he's not choosing a bride that's going to think about doing her own thing and while he does his own thing but he's choosing a bride that has the same character car characteristics as himself a bride that's flesh of his flesh a bride that's bone of his bone amen a bride he is molding and shaping out with his word amen and and we may ask well who is his bride who is this bride going to be well I believe it's you and I tonight I believe his bride is going to be you and I and Ephesians 1 verse4 says according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him and love amen now we are the attributes of what God had in his thoughts before the foundation of the world Amen do you believe that and uh you know I want to pause there for a minute and uh maybe uh take a take a painter or an artist here for a moment um I'd like to you know use an example of someone that um that could draw beautiful pictures if we take an artist or a painter someone that can just draw magnificent pictures and and now before they begin their work they first have to get an inspiration they first have to be inspired to draw something to to to make it art and um a genuine artist is inspired like a real poet or a singer or a musician whatever it might be it all has to come by an inspiration they first have to have an image in their mind before they can make it display on a canvas and um you know I I love art myself I um when we go to Pigeon Forge I I love going to those little art galleries there and and just going in and and honestly I can't go in without without tearing up a little bit the their art the the the beauty of them artists of what they can do just blows my mind every time and um and I love just seeing the art galleries and just the inspiration I love seeing the inspiration these people have and that that they had to think that in the their mind before they can make it display you know they can draw up the battles of of of that happened years ago or they can draw a mountain scenery or something and they can make it look so real uh and it just it amazes me and um and the detail that's there it just it just a painter can if he's a good painter he can turn it into a real Masterpiece and I just I just love going in there and and looking at that and I want to look at an artist we all know um for a few minutes uh uh we all know the Great Masterpiece of Michelangelo yeah with uh created of Moses now Michelangelo created tons of Art and um but I wanted to take Michelangelo brother Brandon used them so I'd like to use them tonight if that's okay um now before uh he could start carving he first had to have a mental picture of what he thought Moses ought to be and Michelangelo you know he was a great man it took him three years to finish this masterpiece he he would just take a rock of marble and he would just carve it day after day year after year just hacking away at that at that Granite there and and uh see only the man only the sculpture himself has it has in his mind of what he's trying to do and uh you know we may walk up to him and say well why why are you why are you breaking away this piece or or why are you working on that rock for and to The Outsider it doesn't uh who doesn't know what's in his heart it becomes nonsense to us we don't know the vision that he has and and we know we're just you know why is he just he's wasting his time breaking at something and and wasting his energy at just beating on something and uh but but we look at as nonsense whereas him he's got a mental picture in his mind of what that rock is going to be and um uh but to the sculpture himself he got a vision in his mind of what he's trying to make and trying to reproduce what he has on his mind in the form of a monument and that's the reason he can spend years digging out the Rocks he's he's got an image in his mind he's trying to make manifest amen now in doing so you have to start off right brother brandham says at the beginning you have to follow the pattern uh you can't get a little piece to start off here well we'll make it this way no he's got to have an exact p pattern and in his mind it's got that in his mind it's got to be that pattern amen he cannot vary from that pattern now in order to do this he has to draw it in his mind because we have no real pictures of Moses but we but uh he had to get a mental picture of what he thought Moses looked like and you know and then when he got it all perfect year after a year Michelangelo worked on this piece of art and he beat after it and and then he got it uh ah he got it so perfect every corner off and the eyes were just right and the hair was just right and the beard was just right and and he stood off and he looked at his Masterpiece and uh for the for for three years of hard labor and and how he had to hold that same vision all that time in his mind of what he was going to do and just think of that Vision on his mind for so many years he didn't lose that vision for three years years he had that Vision in his mind the whole time and not once did he ever lose that Vision to make it look just exactly what it was before him and he caught the first vision and how he had to work to that Vision cutting it off making it down and when he got to where he perfected it till it really got perfect that he stood and he looked at it and and finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand right and he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision of his mind was standing before him in reality the the the the the the picture that that was in his mind was now looking right back at him and and it become a Great Masterpiece to Michelangelo what he had seen in his conception of what Moses was there it was figured before him what he had held in his heart all these years and the tools and the hours of sorrow and distress and the critics and everything else but he stayed right with the vision until it was completed and then when it was completed he stood back uh with a hammer uh in his hand and he looked at the monument and he was so inspired by uh by till he thought his own Masterpiece should speak back it was so perfect it was so beautiful it it was amazing that that he could uh stand there for 3 years with that image in his mind that when he finished it he looked at it and he thought that the image should speak so he smok the image with his hammer and yell speak cuz it was so perfect my come on now and it made a flaw it put a flaw in the image yes the image that he had spent years after years now how a flaw in the image right and I believe that that's what made it the Masterpiece but B says that he believes that's what made it the Masterpiece that he thought it was so perfect that he smoked the image and put a big gash in his knee thinking it should speak yeah amen hallelujah and and here if we were to look to God the great sculpture tonight amen who before the world was formed and before the foundations were laid he had in his mind what he wanted right and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in reality of what H what was in a what was in a vision to him he wanted to make he wanted to turn uh uh what was in his mind into reality amen God Almighty who in the beginning before there was a day or a dawn uh before there was an Autumn or or a m God in his mind had man what man should look like what he should be and what he should act like amen are you thankful for that tonight and as he began to work upon the creeping things like upon the little animals upon the Earth and then he began to bring it from that into something else something higher then he finally brought in the larger animals such as the lion such as the tiger or the bear and he brought it into Li uh into the of maybe the monkeys and the Apes and and so forth uh now not Evolution because God we don't believe in evolution but he started with the lowest he started with the the the least and he begin to work up and he begin to to form his what was in his mind and as he worked because he had a pattern in his mind and he had to stay with that pattern amen and uh and as he worked and and uh but then uh finally there Came Upon the earth a Perfection and that was man man become the Perfection man become what God had in his mind amen and then he could see that man that uh that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what the Creator was amen and God hadn't now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image yes sir and his Masterpiece was almost perfect it was almost perfect God seen that his Masterpiece Adam was alone so what did he do he struck Adam in the side and he made with that he created a bride for Adam amen his Masterpiece was almost perfect it was looking right at God and then God smoted Adam in the side he smote him and then with that he brought forth a bride my and now to make the two one he put them brother Bram says he put them like any great sculpture in a place that's beautiful a sculpture wouldn't make a Great Masterpiece and then take it and set it aside in the alley somewhere or hide it behind the buildings but he placed it here upon the Earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the Garden of Eden he placed his Masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden and how it must have pleased him that he saw the m Masterpiece was well after he rested uh he he he thought his Masterpiece was so perfect he thought it was so well it was so beautiful it was a perfect image that The Great Masterpiece had created that he himself rested and he placed his uh he was so pleased with his work the Lord and then we all know the story it's a sad story but then Satan had to come in and Mar God's creation God's Masterpiece Satan got jealous of God's Great Masterpiece so he come in and he marred uh God's Masterpiece with sin and God made a covenant with Adam and he placed him behind his word as a refuge to protect him but when they got out from behind his word it left the door open and Satan seeing the door open he come in uh and destroyed God's creation amen with sin the Masterpiece was broken and if I could say this tonight we we uh must stay with God's word no matter what no matter what the cost may be we have to stay with that word because if we don't stay with that word then we leave a door open for Satan to come in amen we must separate ourselves from the world we must stay with the word amen in the beginning was the word word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the word remains God and always will be God because God is in his word we must stay with the word amen now we find out that after he had found this great Maring God had found his this great marring and it had to be maybe it was me and you that maybe had found it and we had it maybe we had put all of our time we had put all of our effort into it and we would have just kicked the thing out we would have said just forget about it all that time I spent years after years God uh 6,000 years created this masterpiece and now it was broken before him if it was you and I who if it was me who created that and I had spent years after years after year creating a masterpiece and then someone come in and destroyed it I I would have just walked away I would have just threw all the pieces away and then then I would have just forgot about it but this great sculpture when he seen that the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and run he went to work immediately to rebuild it up again he wasn't willing that any should perish and lay there like that all the time because uh he is God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build man unto his own image again amen and he came down and he started all over again he was going to redeem man back to God he was going to redeem you and I back to God he wasn't going to leave us in the mud he wasn't going to leave his leave us so what did he do he he began to pick up the broken pieces and he was going to work again at his image he was going to work again at this masterpiece amen that way our child of God could stand perfect that way we could stand free we could stand virtess that we could stand free from sin my the Bible says that the Lord is not willing that any should perish so he needed someone who was worthy to redeem man back to God we needed someone worthy to redeem us back amen and he needed to create another Masterpiece his first one fell through sin so he began creating another one that couldn't fail amen he started creating another Masterpiece that wouldn't fail my amen but first in order to begin this Great Masterpiece again he first had to create another Covenant with man amen he put Adam on a covenant before do this and not this do this and and not that touch not handle not taste not but we find out when he started again he started with Abraham and in Abraham he started with him an unconditional covenant not if you will but I have I've already done it it's finished I've blessed you you and your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional Covenant now amen it was God standing in the Gap this time amen he knew that it wasn't man he couldn't depend man on man no more he tried he gave it to man and he rested it and then man fell and and and broke that Covenant so what did he had to do he couldn't trust man he couldn't trust any of his creation because they were lower than the man so then he had to create another one that was that was uh better than man and the only one that was better and better and bigger and better was God himself he had to create the Covenant with himself oh my what a masterpiece oh he started with Abraham and now we have Abraham um or he started with Abraham his workmanship again and now with his unconditional Covenant then we find out he based on Abraham and gave him the Covenant unconditional with the promise now we have Abraham we have Isaac we have Jacob we have Joseph uh the four Patriarchs here displayed uh here he displayed the foundation of his work right he displayed the foundation through these four Patriarchs of his work and Abraham represented Faith he had great faith because he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief then when he'd say the chips is down and everything he against him he still held on to God Amen then we have Isaac which which was beloved Son which represented love so we have faith we have love because Abraham being a type of God as Isaac was offered we find out that he carried the wood upon the hill and everything portrayed Christ foreshadowed him and then the ram came and was now uh offered in his stead now that was love H so we have uh Faith love and and we realized that Jacob's life really represented Grace so we have faith because it was gra it was the grace of God all the time with Jacob and so we have faith love um Grace and then come Joseph now there was nothing against Joseph he was the perfected one and God's Prophet that came forth among his Brethren and hated without a cause and was sold and in every way his life foreshadowed the life of Jesus Christ and came to his own and his own received him not amen we all know the story of Joseph and as Joseph was hated by his Brethren thrown into a ditch supposedly be dead took out exalted the right hand of pharaoh and when he left the throne they bow the they blowed the trumpet and now every knee had to Bow and to Joseph amen that's right and we find out that Jesus was almost sold for the same price Joseph was took him up from the pit and ascended into heaven sets aside the right hand of God and when he come from that place the trumpet will sound and every knee will bow and every tongue will confess to him Perfection amen so we that was faith we have faith we have love we have Grace and now we have Perfection amen then with the body work came on of this grape sculpture he made the bodyw work by the prophets amen he used these prophets to build this masterpiece then finally came the head of this great body which was Christ himself so he created a body but now we needed a head so then Christ himself come and and all the prophets had foretold of him all the foundation work had foretold of him all the way from the Garden of Eden from every time that he started I'll put enity between your seed and the serpent seed so ever since from the beginning uh was a was a type of Christ the natural types the spiritual and everything that happened with Abraham with with uh uh Jacob and Isaac and Joseph all them was a portrait of what Christ what it was supposed to be like in this day amen and once again he seen his own reflection with one man was born on the Earth from the womb of a woman that was God's Masterpiece it was the son of God Jesus Christ the reason he was because he was perfectly the word amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen now we see he reflected him in a perfect Masterpiece he was so perfect like God until he said in John 10:37 if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that you that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him and if I do not the works of my father don't believe me amen amen so it's so it was so perfect he he reflected God so much well he was God in flesh amen and and Christ was a perfect reflection of what God had in his mind amen and ever since the fall of Man God was building up another Masterpiece that would reflect him and redeem him of which was fallen in the beginning amen and year after year and generation after generation the prophets foretelling his appearance and then one day one day after everyone waiting after everyone waiting the all the prophets for telling of of the messiah's coming and and then everybody waiting an anticipation of of when would it could be who is it and and then one day John the Baptist looked over and says Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world Amen this great sculpture of God made flesh through Jesus Christ who become the Priceless Son of God here to redeem man back to God amen just like Michelangelo when he created his Masterpiece it becomes so perfect that he smoke the image and brother Brenham says that God's Masterpiece was so perfect that he smoted him on Calvary amen he smoted him on Calvary for you and I my why so that through his blood he will redeem all that that was lost in the beginning that he could restore all that which was broken men all that was torn so that he would become the perfect and Priceless that we might would become the perfect and Priceless son and daughter of God oh my the Priceless image of God that was in the beginning before the foundation of the world oh my but God's forn knowledge and predestinated plan he knew us before the foundation of the world are you think for that tonight God God knew you before the foundation of the world Jesus says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and have ordained you I have anointed you that you should be without blame see a clean Sate nothing held against us you were made perfect through him in love my amen back then Christ was uh Moses and them had just a portion portion of God they all had a portion throughout the ages Moses had a portion Abraham had a portion of God but now in this day Jesus Christ said all that was in all that the father was is now in me and all that's in me he placed that in the bride so we are now the fullness of God we don't have just a portion no more but we are the fullness of Jesus Christ we can't sin it's done it's over oh my a perfect Masterpiece oh amen he didn't choose us to be a beggar he didn't choose us to live in despair but he saw value in you he didn't choose you to to keep you in the mud he didn't choose you to to forget about you to put you in a corner but he seen value in you he seen that something that was worth saving my he saw something worth dying for that's right amen and that What Makes Us Priceless tonight amen you may so well you don't you don't know what I've done you don't know about my past I don't know I have to know about your has to know that God cares for you I don't know I don't have to know about what you did 20 years ago what you did yesterday or what you did two hours ago to know that you were are forgiven and guess before the foundation of the world his word says so amen either you believe it or you don't amen if you could only look past the thought that you're not good enough tonight oh my if you could just look past the thought that you're not good enough look past the thought that God can't use you look past the thought that you're not worthy when he said it was finished on Calvary he made you worthy he sees value in you amen you weren't made to be a servant you were made you w made to stay in the mud you were born to be a son and daughter of God my Ephesians 1 verse4 right says according as he ha chosen us before him uh Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will my it's so pleased him to choose you tonight it pleased him oh my if we could just get beyond our our our our human thinking and and try to get into what he really trying to say he it was it pleased God to choose you sure we make our mistakes sure we fall but it don't know it doesn't matter how many fall how many times you fall it matters how many times you get back up again oh my and that's why no one can take your place no one can take your place each one of us was placed perfectly in the body of Jesus Christ amen Satan will tell you that you're too weak oh he say he tells us that every day he'll tell you that you're too weak he San will tell you that you're to that you're too much of a failure that that you don't fit with the rest of the church that you don't fit with the rest of the youth crowd or or anything like that that you're just a disappointment to God but let me tell you something back in the old days in order to tell if go was real in order to to to tell if if it was really gold the Indians had to beat on that gold and they beat on that gold and beat on that gold until they seen their own reflection in that go to know that it was worth a valuable amen and that's the same thing with God he's going to take his word and he's going to try you he's going to test you he's going to beat you with the word he's going to he's going to do everything he can to get the world out of you so he can see his reflection oh my what a masterpiece hallelujah amen what a great sculpture we have oh sometimes we can get stubborn but if we could just yield ourselves to him if we can just surrender ourselves to him and watch him mold us watch him make us and watch and then and then then you can look in the mirror and then you can see ah Jesus Christ amen amen don't listen to the lies of the devil it doesn't matter how weak you are it doesn't matter how many times you've Fallen amen it matters that you just keep pressing on amen he chose us in our weakness to show how strong he really is amen he chose us in our failures to know to show that we are nothing without him tonight amen when we become weak it's the uh it's only then can God use us it's only then that God can make us something beautiful out of us amen when we become weak when we can surrender is then God can make something out of us amen when you're already strong when you already have everything figured out God can't use you he can't he can't use you if you already have a made up mind right amen we have to become weak we have to surrender our will he wants something uh someone who thinks they're nothing cuz it's only then that he can make you something oh my God is going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle do you believe that amen he said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will forever remain amen he's cutting out a bride for his word amen by his word yes Amen brother Brenham [Music] says and when uh he made his first Masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made his second P Masterpiece he was the word amen he was the word not behind the word but he was the word and when God and Christ become one they were one cuz God was the word and the Word was made flesh the Flesh and the word become one and when the church becomes one uh becomes uh becomes Christ's bride she and the gospel are the same thing amen they're the same oh my and so now are you a word bride and if his word shall remain his word shall not return void and it will forever remain then you become a part of that word you are that word you can't fail oh it don't know it don't matter how many times Satan will come and whisper in your ears and tell you that you're weak that you're broken that you're worthless but God says that you are strong that you cannot fail oh my you are one with him all the people in the world of all the people in the world God should choose you to be a part of him he knew you would want to be saved he knew that if ever given a chance to believe this message you would want to believe it amen so out of his forign knowledge he already redeemed you before the foundation of the world we are highly favored you're a highly favored people we are a blessed people we should walk with our heads up high amen it doesn't mean that the fiery Childs won't come or going to uh are going to stop coming it doesn't mean that you won't go through hard times but once you recognize who you are then you can have and rest in that assurance that everything is going to be all right amen The Trials come but you're Rising above it all temptation comes but you're Rising above it all disappointment may come but you're Rising above it all why because you were made to soar in the skies you are eagles you're strong you're not a chicken stuck in the barnyard that's right but you were made to soar in Heavenly places cuz you're an eagle born for the sky amen you know when I was a teenager it was rough in a sense that as teenagers you feel like you don't belong anywhere you're not a kid no more in a sense but yet you're not an adult and sometimes it's it's kind of hard to find where you belong and and you know and Satan uses that opportunity to work on young people he he gets the people where they you know they're they're stuck of well we just got out of childhood but we're not adults yet and and no one the young people are the the little people don't want to accept them and the older adults don't want to accept them yet so they're caught in the middle and then Satan will come in and use that opportunity to play with her mind amen I was there and you know and and and and he did he did that on me at least he he played with my mind and sometimes I would feel worthless sometimes I I felt like no one cared and and sometimes I I felt like God just wouldn't hear my prayers and that they were just getting hit in the ceiling and falling back down and and you know I'm so thankful that I have Godly Parents and that would pray for me and and and dad would always tell me he would say Daniel God's got something for you you he would tell me that son you're you're special and Son God's going to use you one of these days and constantly reminding me constantly saying that that God's going to use you you you you mean something to God don't give up yet keep pressing on and I remember as a young person sister Jane would always tell me she would always tell me Daniel I don't know what it is but you're special God's got something for you and it encouraged me as a young person and gave me strength that God still cared for me oh my and as a teenager I that would always encourage me to keep pressing on that I knew that one day I was going to make it I knew that one day everything had to give way and I was going to make it amen I believe it was David that said in Psalms 37 I have been young and now I'm old yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed of begging for bread and I want to tell you here tonight whether you're young or you're old then I know sometimes we just want to give up and sometimes we want to just throw in the towel and sometimes we don't feel loved and sometimes we feel like we aren't worth anything and sometimes we may feel like a failure but let me say this you don't you don't lose your column when you make a mistake you don't lose your position as a child of God because you make a mistake you don't become less of what God called you to be because you make a mistake oh my God can use you again though you've messed up oh my God can bless you again though you failed don't let the devil tell you that God is finished with you cuz he's not finished with you amen don't let the devil tell you ah that that you're not worth anything amen you have a destiny you have a a work to accomplish right before the devil ever showed up before there was ever a devil God had you and his mind before the devil ever showed up God seen that blood over you amen your destiny is not up to any devil you haven't chosen me but I have chosen you amen and that's the same thing and if he's the one that's doing the choosing and he's chosen you then nothing can stop you nothing can separate you nothing can harm you no weapon formed against you will prosper amen you were sealed until the day of your Redemption my aren't you thankful for that tonight could I get a little bit more monitors I know they're ringing a little bit but my voice is about to go amen now I love my wife and and I love my baby girl and uh I feel like I I say something about them every time I get it behind the pull pit but I live with them all the time so uh and I and I got to thinking I I just I love them I love them so much and and I got to thinking the other day of how valuable my family is to me and and I can't tell you right now I I wouldn't I can tell you right now that I wouldn't give them up for anything in the world I wouldn't they're Priceless to me they they have a value to me they're part of me that's that's who I am and and I wouldn't get I wouldn't take I would trade them for all the money in the world ah they're Priceless to me a nice truck couldn't buy them from me a nice house couldn't buy them from me oh my free gas for the rest of my life couldn't buy them from me it just couldn't why because I love them and there's value in my family that maybe no one else will see but me maybe you could trade them for free gas for a year but I couldn't because they're part of me amen and I got to thinking that if I a man would care that much for my family that I a man a failure one who who makes uh mistakes one who can make my family upset with me or or maybe I couldn't be the leader that I want to be sometimes and a man that would just uh make disappointments and and things like that if I a man would care that much for a family what about God and his family turn the floors down amen she's going to ring uh but what about God God himself caring that much uh just turn the floors down please yeah thank you uh and but I got to thinking about his bride how much does he care for his bride amen the ma Matthew in the 4th chapter tells us that Jesus went into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and you know I just got to thinking one day I just got to thinking about this that if I was offered everything if if I was taken if someone had take me to a place and they own the world if they owned they own businesses after businesses if they were popular if they had money if they had all the fashion and everyone looked to them they were on TV three times a day and they come to me and they offered me and said for your family you can have all of this you could be worry free you could be stressfree you wouldn't have to worry about a thing everything would be handed to you on a silver platter everything you could wake up with breakfast and bed if you wanted to you know I wouldn't do it I couldn't do it I couldn't do it because I love them and as much as I want my wife to be happy and as much as I want my family to be happy I could amen and here they have taken Jesus uh Satan has uh take it uh Jesus went into the Wilderness to be Temple uh tempted and and by the devil and Satan would begin to tempt Jesus and he said command these stones to be made into bread and and though the if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down and but Jesus would always come back with the word but it is written he would always remind Satan of his word but it is written man man shall not live by bread alone amen and then and then Satan takes the up on a mountain and he shows him the kingdoms and the pleasures of the world and and said all of this can be yours if you would just bow down to me showed them all the kingdoms all the all the filth he showed them all the darkness of the world and said all of this can be yours if you would just bow down to me and maybe Jesus been weak and hunger as Satan would begin to plague his mind and as Satan was showing him the sin the filth the pleasures of the world that as he looked into the darkness of the world maybe you and maybe you and I flash before his mind and he knew that if he would accept the world all of humanity would be lost that you and I would be lost that his Masterpiece would be lost forever amen but he couldn't accept that amen the P he would allow himself to be suffered why would he allow himself to be beaten for you and I why would he allow himself to let his flesh be ripped up from from his bones and why would he allow himself to be rejected and despised why would he do that why because of love because he loved you because he seen you before the foundation of the world he wanted you to be with him he wanted you to reign with him right oh my he saw value in you amen he saw worth in you amen he saw a bride uh that would be that would want to be redeemed amen he thought you were saving so what did he do he came and he changed your life as the song says he thought you worth keeping so he cleaned you up inside he thought you were worth dying for so he sacrificed his life so you can be free amen so you can be sinless so you can be holy and Without Blame before him in love oh my why so so you could sit with him in glory amen we are his Masterpiece we are a Priceless son and daughter of God Amen Satan will try and tell you but you have no value Satan will try and tell you every day that you're a mistake that you were just uh you weren't meant to be amen and when the trials come and when the hard time comes and when the pain is there just Rejoice just praise God because you know who you are oh my sometimes it's in your pains you're going to see great victories amen sometimes in your pain it's then that you can Rejoice amen Paul and Silas in the jail that night chained to the wall for for doing God a service but they didn't give up they didn't ask God what by me they didn't uh give into despair but it was in their pain they begin to sing it was in their hard times they begin to sing amen they knew they knew that if God had called them he would have to come and deliver them amen as and maybe as they begin to sing Oh The Blood of Jesus and maybe they begin to sing all my life you have been faithful amen and as they begin to just put their all into it the walls begin to shake and and thunder begin to just rattle the ground and the next thing they knew their chains fell to the ground oh don't give up don't give into despair just Rejoice Just Praise Him amen your chains is going to fall your chains will fall just keep pressing on it don't matter how long it's going to take keep pressing on don't give up yet amen worship will get you through the pain amen there's value in a son and daughter of God you can live so close to God that the devil don't even know what to do with you oh my are you thankful for that tonight amen amen I'm getting ready to close I know I've kept you the story I'm reminded of an auction that happened years ago and I I was thinking of this earlier and there's a song of it and I just have the song on repeat and just constantly playing but an auction that I believe the story was in a poem but you know maybe there was a hundred hundreds of people hundreds of people have come to this auction and from all over this auction because there was some great valuable items that was going to be auctioned off there and as each item was being sold for thousands of dollars beautiful items priceless items or or just just just things that people have created artifacts and everything people have found or whatever but people had heard of what was going to be there so they all came from all over the place and they wanted to to to spend their money on something that was valuable amen and as each item was being sold for thousands of dollars here comes the auctioner with an Old Violin am man it was Dusty It Was Out Of Tune a little bed and to the human eye this Old Violin had no value to it and maybe the crowd was a little disgruntled about it and here they had traveled for Miles all around to spend their money on something that had value in it and as the auction began and the auctioneer would say who would give me $1 for it who would give me two and it maybe it took a little bit for someone to well let's just get this out of the way sure I'll take $1 for it well I guess I'll take $2 for it and I was and as it was being auctioned off cheap a little old great haired man stood up in the back and and he walked up to the front and and he walked up to that Old Violin and he picked it up and well he wiped the dust off the strings and and he walked uh and he tightened up the bow he would begin to play there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and as he begin to play the crowd began to get moved and and they were all wiping their tears and and and and he set the bow when he finished he laid the Old Violin back down and walked back to his seed and the AU picked up the Old Violin and said who would give me $11,000 for it who would give me five who would give me 10 who's going to give me $100,000 it become Priceless it become valuable the crowd didn't understand why because it was the touch of the Master's Hand the touch of the Master's Hand made it from nobody to a nothing to to something that become the most valuable thing in there my what changed the value of the Old Violin the touch of the Master's Hand and something that had less value anything at that auction now become the most valuable item in there and it was the same thing with us we were being auctioned off cheap Satan tried selling us the to the pleasures of the world cheap and he tried selling us disappointments he tried selling us to to the cares of the world tried selling us to failure tried selling us to pain but then there come a master there comes somebody that that knew our worth there comes somebody that played on our heartstrings with love hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen it was the touch of the Master's Hand amen are you thankful for the touch of the Master's Hand amen amen amen and we were being offered off cheap and we were stuck in the mud he filled you with the Holy Ghost he made you to sit in Heavenly places with him that's right why because he's seen value in you he's seen value in me I don't know why but he's seen value in US amen he's seen you his as his own and he said he would have a bride without spot a wrinkled and he's going to do everything he can to get a bride without spot or wrinkle amen amen you can either fight it you can either or just give in and surrender everything to him cuz he will have a bride amen how many believes are the bride tonight amen the world can't understand why we dress different the world can't understand why we act different the world can't understand why we talk different but it was the touch of the Master's Hand amen Satan will come and tell you that you're worthless but remember Satan can't cross that bloodline amen once a Christian always a Christian you can't fail because you're Priceless you have value in you amen John 14 verse one says let your heart be uh let not your heart be troubled believe ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you into myself that where I am you will be there also hallelujah amen he's gone to prepare a place a home for us a home for you a home for me right that we will be with him in glory and he's going to come back he's not going forget about us just like the the the I believe brother Terry I believe mentioned it about the the old cowboy who went out to go find a bride and you know and he went out there and yeah there was a bunch of them to look at they were all beautiful but there was just one that had character there was one that just that just stood out to him and he told her he says I I'm going to go away I'm going to go build you a big Ranch I'm going to go build you your your dream home and when I come back again be ready cuz I will come back I will oh it may be thousands of years it may be whatever it may be h no matter how long it takes I'm coming back for you so she held on to that and when he rode back she kept her wedding garment on the whole time knowing that he could come any minute she stayed ready knowing that he could show up at any time and it's the same thing with us we must stay ready we must stay with the word we must believe in the word oh my we must stay dressed we must stay prepared cuz he's coming back any time now he has gone to prepare a place but when he comes again he's going to receive you unto himself because that where where he is he wants you to be there also amen if the musicians Will Come Bless the Lord amen I hope this was all right I know it was simple but brother brandham says here that's Abraham's seed God choosing not yours Gods God chose you you never chose God God chose you and he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life when was the lamb slain 2,000 years ago in Calvary not in God's sight it he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world when God saw that what Satan had done he laid his program out and he knowed that he would be his son uh he knew that uh he would would send his son and he would be a propitiation for our sins and in the mind of Jehovah to conquer and keep all his people he slay the lamb and his own mind before the foundation of the world and put your name on the book as redeemed Glory that he says that's what he done God did that he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and now it's it's up to you to accept it amen amen I accept I AC amen do you love the Lord tonight can you
