[39:12] amen amen amen and uh certainly good to
[39:16] be in the house of the Lord and Trust
[39:18] everyone's had a good week so far amen
[39:22] and good to have um everyone back from
[39:25] Ohio and uh good to have brother Micaiah
[39:29] with us again and brother Christian
[39:32] starting school back up so uh that um
[39:37] the musicians can be dismissed but I
[39:40] heard uh just of the good
[39:42] reports and uh what God done in the
[39:45] services and there in Ohio and so we're
[39:48] just thankful for that and um
[39:52] Miracles uh took place and one young man
[39:57] he had uh been wrestling I guess and
[40:01] broke his ankle or something there and
[40:05] but uh they had to take him to
[40:07] the hospital and they put a cast on him
[40:11] and everything and went through the
[40:13] prayer line Saturday night and God just
[40:16] touched him he cut the the um the cast
[40:20] off and was walking and uh so we just
[40:23] thank the Lord for that amen and um
[40:26] another one got out of the wheelchair
[40:28] and he' been confined in the wheelchair
[40:31] and the Lord just touched him and he

[41:08] Lord will give him a safe travel and um
[41:12] bless his meeting there amen and um I
[41:18] think sister Martha sent out an
[41:20] announcement um after the service Sunday
[41:24] and uh around 4:30 uh this coming Sunday
[41:28] was those who would want to meet at
[41:31] sister paty's house and um have some
[41:34] songs and fellowship and uh we we've
[41:38] certainly been missing sister py and uh
[41:41] she's been missing the The church here
[41:43] and so it'd be just a wonderful uh U uh
[41:48] time and give us an opportunity to to
[41:51] see her and to just encourage her amen
[41:55] and I tell you what it uh just being
[41:58] around Believers that's uh it's just
[42:00] really uplifting isn't it amen and so uh
[42:04] we we all fight as it is you know in our
[42:08] minds and um and especially when you're
[42:11] sick or you're not feeling good and just
[42:13] seem like Satan takes that
[42:15] opportunity and uh so we just uh uh
[42:20] always need that encouragement praise

[44:30] believed God everybody say Abraham
[44:32] believed God and it was counted unto him
[44:35] for righteousness now to him that
[44:38] worketh is reward not reckoned of Grace
[44:42] but of debt but to him that worketh not
[44:46] but believeth on him that justifieth the
[44:49] ungodly his faith is counted for
[44:51] righteousness even as David also
[44:54] described the blessedness of the man
[44:57] unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[44:59] without works saying blessed are they
[45:03] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[45:05] sins are covered blessed is the man to
[45:08] whom the Lord will not impute sin cometh
[45:12] this blessedness then upon the
[45:14] circumcision only or upon the
[45:16] uncircumcision also see for we say um um
[45:22] that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[45:25] righteousness
[45:27] was it then reckoned when he was in
[45:30] circumcision or
[45:31] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[45:34] in
[45:35] uncircumcision he had received the sign
[45:38] of circumcision a seal of the
[45:40] righteousness of the faith which he had
[45:42] yet being
[45:44] uncircumcised that he might be the
[45:46] father of all them that believe though
[45:49] they be not circumcised that
[45:52] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[45:55] also and the father father of
[45:57] circumcision to whom uh to them who are
[46:00] not of the circumcision only uh but who
[46:04] also walk in the steps of that Faith of
[46:09] Our Father Abraham which he had being
[46:14] yet
[46:16] uncircumcised for the promise that he
[46:18] should be heir of the world was not to
[46:21] Abraham or to a seed through the law but
[46:25] through the righteousness of faith for
[46:28] if they which are of the law be HS faith
[46:32] is made void and the promise made of
[46:35] none effect because the law worketh
[46:37] wrath for there for where no law is
[46:41] there is no
[46:42] transgression therefore it is a faith
[46:45] that it might be Grace uh or be might be
[46:48] by grace to the end of the promise might
[46:53] be uh sure to all the seed not
[46:57] to that only which is of the law but to
[47:00] that also which is of the faith of
[47:03] Abraham who is the father of us all as
[47:07] it is written I have made thee a father
[47:09] of many nations before him whom he
[47:11] believed even God who quickeneth the
[47:14] dead and calleth those things which be
[47:17] not as though they were who against hope
[47:21] believed in hope that he might become
[47:24] the father of many nations according to
[47:26] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[47:29] be and being not weak in faith he
[47:32] considered not his own body now dead
[47:35] when he was about a 100 years old
[47:37] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[47:40] he staggered not at the promise of God
[47:43] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[47:46] giving glory to God and being fully
[47:49] persuaded that what he had promised he
[47:52] was able also to perform and therefore
[47:56] for it was imputed to him for
[48:01] righteousness then if you'll turn with
[48:03] me again to Romans the 8th
[48:07] chapter and going to start at the 16th
[48:13] verse Romans
[48:16] 8 and um
[48:27] I think that's the um yeah so it says
[48:34] um it's actually the well we we'll read
[48:38] it
[48:40] um let's go to the um 14th verse for as
[48:44] many as are led by the spirit of God
[48:46] they are the sons of God for you have
[48:49] not received the spirit of bondage again
[48:52] to fear but you have received the spirit
[48:54] of adoption whereby we cry AB the Father
[48:58] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[49:00] our spirit that we are the children of
[49:02] God or Sons for and if children are Sons
[49:07] then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs
[49:10] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[49:12] him that we may also be glorified for I
[49:17] reckon that the suffering of this
[49:19] present time are not worthy to be
[49:20] compared with the glory which shall be
[49:23] revealed in us for the earnest
[49:25] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[49:28] the
[49:28] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[49:33] you can have your seats this
[49:39] evening praise the Lord do you love him
[49:43] amen now you know we've been talking
[49:46] about an inheritance taking our
[49:49] inheritance by the word in our mouth and
[49:54] we we have been left an inheritance
[49:57] and and as we know God left us in
[50:02] inheritance uh before the foundation of
[50:05] the world when he wrote our name in the
[50:07] Lamb's Book of
[50:08] Life and uh if you are if you have an
[50:13] inheritance then you are an heir and
[50:16] Paul would tell us that we are heir of
[50:19] all things ain't that right we possess
[50:22] all things and brother Bram said we
[50:25] possess all things things the things
[50:27] that are seen and unseen amen and so
[50:31] we've got a vast uh inheritance that is
[50:34] been left us and so now this is the time
[50:39] uh in this age to possess our our
[50:42] inheritance to take it and uh to possess
[50:46] every promise that God has made us amen
[50:51] uh we we know that we have come through
[50:53] the stages of justification s
[50:56] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[50:59] Ghost and we we are now as the Isaiah uh
[51:04] talked about the ends of the Earth we
[51:06] are at the ends of the Earth amen the
[51:10] End of Time the end of Politics the end
[51:12] of civilization as we know it the end of
[51:15] corruption the end of of e everything
[51:18] the end of mortal life amen we're we're
[51:22] at the end of all things and so this is
[51:26] the season where the sons of God are to
[51:29] be manifested um and and we talked about
[51:33] Caleb and and how that he had went
[51:35] through the Journey and and he had come
[51:37] up to that that promised land and then
[51:40] he crossed over under uh the ministry of
[51:43] of Joshua and and uh when he crossed in
[51:47] over into the land of promise amen he
[51:51] possessed uh his inheritance and that's
[51:54] that's what he wanted he would not
[51:56] settled down for nothing else he knew
[51:59] God had given him an inheritance he and
[52:02] and that's that's exactly what he wanted
[52:04] and that's what he he did he defeated
[52:07] every giant that that uh um uh that came
[52:12] his way or that stood uh between him and
[52:15] his inheritance because he had a legal
[52:18] right to do that you believe that amen
[52:20] he had no fear whatsoever he just knew
[52:23] that God promised me this land and he
[52:26] prom promised me this inheritance it's
[52:28] mine and and and I'm I'm going to take
[52:31] it and he did and and so is it for you
[52:34] and I that we have a right to defeat
[52:37] every enemy that stands between us and
[52:41] our inheritance amen and we are we we we
[52:45] now have the the the the the uh
[52:48] god-given right the god-given ability
[52:51] this is the time to overcome this is the
[52:55] time every enemy is is to be defeated in
[52:59] this age now our enemy is not flesh and
[53:02] blood amen for uh Paul would tell us in
[53:06] in Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not
[53:09] against flesh and blood but against the
[53:11] principalities against Powers against
[53:14] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[53:16] against the spiritual wickedness in high
[53:18] places so therefore it's not Humanity
[53:22] that is trying to keep us from our
[53:25] inheritance yes the Works through
[53:27] Humanity just as much as God uh Works
[53:30] through Humanity but in all reality it's
[53:33] it's Satan and his demons uh which makes
[53:37] it a spiritual warfare this this Warfare
[53:40] that we're fighting it's a spiritual
[53:43] warfare against uh the demons and of of
[53:46] of hell ain't that right and so this is
[53:49] why I I've used that title taken our
[53:52] inheritance by the word uh of our mouth
[53:55] see we we're not taking our inheritance
[53:58] by guns and knives and and atomic bombs
[54:02] and nuclear powers and and all of that
[54:05] that's not the way we're taking our
[54:07] inheritance we're not taking our
[54:08] inheritance by beheading people and and
[54:11] putting people into prison and right and
[54:15] and and all of that uh that's that's not
[54:18] the way we're taking our inheritance but
[54:21] as we've been taught the word of God
[54:23] everybody say the word of God will
[54:26] defeat eat Satan anytime anywhere under
[54:29] any condition the word of God and we
[54:33] know that Jesus defeated Satan he had
[54:36] power upon power but he used not a one
[54:39] he used the word to defeat Satan and
[54:42] every time Satan came at him he would
[54:45] use the word amen and he defeated Satan
[54:48] on every turn amen and and and that was
[54:51] to show that even the weakest Christian
[54:55] can defeat Satan
[54:57] anytime anywhere under any condition
[55:00] anyone I don't know if you feel like
[55:02] you're the weakest Christian but but you
[55:05] have no excuse to defeating the devil
[55:08] every one of us can defeat the Devil
[55:10] from the smallest to the oldest amen by
[55:13] the word of God now and and and the
[55:16] scripture that that I was really looking
[55:18] for amen and we we had read in the the
[55:21] uh uh previous uh uh uh Services is
[55:24] where Paul would tell us the word is NY
[55:28] everybody say the word is NY even in thy
[55:32] mouth the word is nigh thee even in thy
[55:35] mouth now now what uh uh what's uh in
[55:39] our mouth is the word as Paul would say
[55:43] that's already been declared the word
[55:46] that's already been preached amen uh
[55:49] that that is the word that is in our
[55:52] mouth now this word is is no longer a
[55:55] mystery to us it it has been revealed in
[55:59] in this day so now how did the word get
[56:03] in our mouth amen well first of all we
[56:06] received it into our heart ain't that
[56:09] right amen every Christian receives the
[56:12] word not intellectually but receives it
[56:15] into their heart amen by faith and and
[56:19] and then Jesus said in Matthew 12 and
[56:22] and 34 out of the abundance of the heart
[56:25] the speaketh so therefore the word has
[56:28] to come into the heart first and then
[56:32] your mouth is filled amen with the word
[56:35] of God it begins to speak amen the word
[56:38] of God again in John 15:7 Jesus said if
[56:43] you abide in me and my words abide in
[56:46] you you shall ask what you will amen now
[56:51] think of it that's how you're going to
[56:52] defeat your enemy you shall ask what you
[56:55] will and it shall be done unto you see
[56:59] the power of the word amen see now so we
[57:03] are to do as as David done um uh talked
[57:08] about there in Psalms
[57:10] 11911 where he said Thy word have I hid
[57:15] in my heart that I might not sin against
[57:18] thee ain't that right so it was
[57:21] important David guarded that word he
[57:23] revered that word he he resp respected
[57:26] the word he he hallowed the word amen it
[57:29] was it the word was was greater to him
[57:32] than his own word as a king amen uh uh
[57:37] uh or a government or whatever uh uh it
[57:40] was a word amen and he said I've hid it
[57:43] in my heart that I might not sin against
[57:46] thee and the prophet said we must hide
[57:49] God's word in our heart and then
[57:52] everybody say then God will keep his Pro
[57:56] promise God will keep his promise see so
[57:59] every Service uh uh uh what we're doing
[58:02] we're are a people that is hiding the
[58:04] word we're depositing the word in our
[58:07] hearts we're not letting the devil take
[58:09] that word from us you you remember that
[58:12] that Jesus talked about the four grounds
[58:14] and and one of them grounds Satan was
[58:17] able to take that word out amen but but
[58:20] we are a people that Satan can't take
[58:22] that word out amen we're hiding it in
[58:25] our heart heart we're protecting it
[58:27] we're guarding it amen from the
[58:29] adversary from negativity from from
[58:32] negative thoughts from failers from ups
[58:35] and downs and and and and and all of
[58:37] these things we're we're hiding that
[58:39] word in US amen yes we get discouraged
[58:42] but we still hide the word in our heart
[58:45] yes we may not know what to do sometime
[58:47] but we're hiding the word in our heart
[58:50] that word is more valuable than anything
[58:52] else do you believe that now you think
[58:55] of it now
[58:56] God does not have to heal to prove his
[59:00] power amen he doesn't have to save he
[59:03] doesn't have to deliver to prove his
[59:05] power he doesn't have to prove anything
[59:08] to anyone do you believe that but notice
[59:12] the prophet said but he has to heal he
[59:15] has to save he has to deliver Amen in
[59:18] order to keep his word amen God is
[59:22] obligated to his word I'll say it this
[59:25] way he's not even obligated to you amen
[59:28] now you think of that because you're up
[59:29] and down all the time you're full of
[59:32] failures you're full of ups and downs
[59:34] you're full of discouragement you're
[59:35] full of uh uh well brother Ram said we
[59:37] backslide every day and and and and
[59:41] sometimes uh uh we we just got a lot of
[59:43] wrestling uh uh well you know where the
[59:46] Battlegrounds uh you know that uh uh
[59:48] that that the war rages within us do you
[59:51] believe that amen but God's not
[59:53] obligated to us now you think of that if
[59:56] we were in discouragement you know he
[59:58] might be obligated to to bring a Justice
[1:00:01] to us amen when we have fallen and maybe
[1:00:04] when we have backslid and maybe when we
[1:00:07] ain't just really up to par and and and
[1:00:09] and at our best for him and and all of
[1:00:12] these things but but he's not obligated
[1:00:15] to us he's obligated to his word ain't
[1:00:18] that right now there's a word concerning
[1:00:20] you that he's obligated to ain't that
[1:00:23] right so he's not obligated to us us but
[1:00:26] he's obligated to his word concerning us
[1:00:30] amen see and so the prophet said when
[1:00:33] God speaks he is obligated to keep it
[1:00:36] for that's his word he's obligated God's
[1:00:40] not under o any obligation to any man
[1:00:44] but he's obligated to his own word
[1:00:47] that's the kind of God that he is that
[1:00:49] when he speaks it it's going to happen
[1:00:52] he'll move Heaven and Earth Amen to make
[1:00:55] sure that his word comes to pass now
[1:00:58] that's what makes his word the absolute
[1:01:01] amen now I've looked up that word
[1:01:04] absolute it's perfect in itself Amen in
[1:01:07] Unlimited in power primarily an ultimate
[1:01:11] see uh uh uh brother BR would say an
[1:01:14] absolute it's used many times it's the
[1:01:16] last word it's the amen it's the last
[1:01:20] thing it's the final word it means that
[1:01:23] you've reached the end you can't go any
[1:01:26] higher than the absolute ain't that
[1:01:28] right amen it's the Supreme it's the
[1:01:31] ultimate there there there's nothing
[1:01:33] else in its way see amen so the word of
[1:01:37] God is our absolute amen not only your
[1:01:41] absolute it's the devil's absolute too
[1:01:44] amen the devil has to give way to the
[1:01:46] word of God Amen the word of God Amen is
[1:01:49] the absolute to to to Kings and to
[1:01:52] Nations and to monarchs and amen to evil
[1:01:56] Powers amen whatever it would amen it's
[1:02:00] the absolute the word of God is the
[1:02:03] final say so in your life ain't that
[1:02:06] right amen see well uh uh Jesus said in
[1:02:10] Matthew 24 and 35 he said Heaven and
[1:02:15] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[1:02:19] never pass away now you think of that
[1:02:22] now there is no other word amen that
[1:02:25] that will break the powers of the devil
[1:02:28] your own word will ain't ain't good
[1:02:31] enough to break the powers of the enemy
[1:02:34] amen our my own word and and and and and
[1:02:37] and the King's own word President Putin
[1:02:40] or uh Obama or or or or whatever amen
[1:02:45] there is no word that is able Amen to
[1:02:49] break the the the the PO of Satan and to
[1:02:53] defeat him amen there for amen it gives
[1:02:57] us confidence that we can trust in the
[1:03:01] word of God Amen if exactly brother
[1:03:04] brand said we can trust exactly in what
[1:03:08] God says we don't have to alternate it
[1:03:11] we don't have to change it around you
[1:03:14] don't even have to understand it all
[1:03:17] amen just know that God's going to bring
[1:03:20] his word to pass amen because that's the
[1:03:23] ultimate amen see so therefore we keep
[1:03:27] his word in our heart so that we don't
[1:03:30] sin or that we don't disbelieve Amen
[1:03:34] brother Brown said that sin is unbelief
[1:03:37] ain't that right amen see now in our
[1:03:40] opening scripture we read where Abraham
[1:03:43] he called those things that are not as
[1:03:47] though they were amen you think of that
[1:03:51] he called them as though they already
[1:03:54] existed they were not but yet he called
[1:03:58] it as though it already was amen well
[1:04:03] what what was he doing he done exactly
[1:04:06] what God did amen for God done the same
[1:04:09] thing remember in Isaiah 46 and9 amen
[1:04:14] God says remember the former things of
[1:04:16] old for I am God and there is none else
[1:04:20] I am God and there is none like me
[1:04:23] declaring the end from the beginning
[1:04:26] amen before anything was before anything
[1:04:30] was in existence God called those things
[1:04:34] as though it already was he declared the
[1:04:39] end from the beginning and from ancient
[1:04:42] times the things that are not yet done
[1:04:46] amen well it's in the beginning or
[1:04:48] before the beginning of time he had a
[1:04:51] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:04:53] world Amen he also wrote our names in
[1:04:58] the Lamb's Book of Life when he wrote or
[1:05:01] when he predestinated the lamb he also
[1:05:04] right then wrote our names in the Lamb's
[1:05:08] Book of Life yet we were not here to
[1:05:11] contest it we were not here amen uh uh
[1:05:15] uh to to to to you know to to look at
[1:05:19] things we had no failures at that time
[1:05:22] we had no righteousness at that time
[1:05:24] there was nothing good bad or anything
[1:05:27] that we could offer God and yet he
[1:05:30] already established us before the
[1:05:33] foundation of the world he declared you
[1:05:36] he called your salvation before you even
[1:05:39] had salvation he called you well the
[1:05:42] Bible says that he predestinated us he
[1:05:45] called us he justified us and he
[1:05:49] glorified us when before the foundation
[1:05:52] of the world so he called those things
[1:05:55] things that are not as though they
[1:05:58] already existed amen God ain't worrying
[1:06:01] about you he's already called it amen
[1:06:04] he's already declared your end he's
[1:06:06] already declared your Victory he's
[1:06:08] already declared your Triumph he's
[1:06:10] already declared your your you're
[1:06:12] overcoming can you say Amen what may
[1:06:15] seem to be a trial that you can't get
[1:06:17] out of notice what God has called notice
[1:06:21] what God has declared that's right see
[1:06:24] he declared it before there was even a
[1:06:27] beginning of time and all throughout
[1:06:30] scripture he testified of it every T in
[1:06:34] Shadow he testified of your Redemption
[1:06:37] he testified of your Victory he
[1:06:39] testified of your glorification he
[1:06:42] testif he never testified of you as a
[1:06:44] defeated he never testified there is no
[1:06:47] types amen uh uh in in the Bible that
[1:06:51] fat that uh matches this bride fits this
[1:06:54] bride to where it shows that she is
[1:06:57] defeated you are triumphant you are
[1:07:01] victorious you are an overcomer amen
[1:07:04] What God Says what God has declared he
[1:07:07] declared you coming from a vagabond Amen
[1:07:10] to a prince he declared you amen from
[1:07:13] living from the alleys and the in the
[1:07:16] dumps and being a nobody to reigning on
[1:07:18] the throne with him God declared it God
[1:07:22] called it as though it already was
[1:07:25] right amen can you say
[1:07:28] amen he testified of it in the
[1:07:32] scriptures calling those things that are
[1:07:35] not as though they were amen amen now
[1:07:39] notice the word that was in Abraham's
[1:07:41] mouth he called it calling those things
[1:07:45] that are not as though they were well
[1:07:47] what was in his mouth God's word for God
[1:07:52] said it first ain't that right God said
[1:07:55] it first amen so therefore Abraham
[1:07:59] calling those things that were not as
[1:08:01] though they already were was just a
[1:08:04] confession the word that was in his
[1:08:07] mouth was a confession he did not dream
[1:08:10] this up he did not conjure this up it
[1:08:13] wasn't just his own thought and and a
[1:08:16] hairbrained idea come to him and he
[1:08:18] started talking about it no God came to
[1:08:21] him first God declared the the promise
[1:08:25] to him first amen and therefore Abraham
[1:08:28] began to confess the promise of God now
[1:08:33] it was a confession now this word
[1:08:35] confession amen is to acknowledge to own
[1:08:39] up to concede to admit usually now I'm
[1:08:44] looking up this in Webster it's usually
[1:08:47] confession is usually used in guilt
[1:08:52] repentance admission of guilt that I was
[1:08:55] wrong uh or a a confession could come
[1:08:59] from a whistleblower as as we hear a lot
[1:09:01] in politics a lot of whistleblowers well
[1:09:04] they're confessing or what we would call
[1:09:07] tattling on the other guy but it's a
[1:09:10] confession ain't that right see and so
[1:09:14] but but then notice what Webster also
[1:09:16] says that the word confession is to
[1:09:20] admit the truth of a statement or a
[1:09:24] charge
[1:09:26] to accept as true to acknowledge and to
[1:09:30] profess can you say amen amen so this is
[1:09:34] a confession aen is to admit the truth
[1:09:37] of a statement so this is what Abraham
[1:09:40] by the word in his mouth he was
[1:09:43] confessing he was literally admitting
[1:09:46] that God's word was true amen it didn't
[1:09:49] matter what he felt it didn't matter
[1:09:51] what Sarah felt and what she looked like
[1:09:54] and the condition that they were in his
[1:09:57] confession admitted that God's word is
[1:10:00] true can you say amen and he
[1:10:03] acknowledged it he accepted it as true
[1:10:07] so confession is to speak to speak to
[1:10:11] say it's an utterance of words of course
[1:10:14] brother brandom said confession is to
[1:10:16] say the same thing as amen see you've
[1:10:20] come into an agreement with what has
[1:10:22] been said and therefore you speak it
[1:10:25] you're not ashamed to speak it you're
[1:10:27] not ashamed to declare it you're not
[1:10:29] embarrassed to say it amen well he's the
[1:10:32] one that said it amen well this was what
[1:10:34] Abraham God said was was going to have a
[1:10:36] child God said so and he just confessed
[1:10:41] it to be
[1:10:42] so so Abraham was speaking uttering
[1:10:46] words but they ain't weren't words of
[1:10:48] his own ambition of his own desire of
[1:10:52] his own own dreams he just simp confess
[1:10:56] what God had already declared that's
[1:10:59] right amen now this reminds me of what
[1:11:03] God Said to the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah
[1:11:06] 51:16 God said and I have put my words
[1:11:11] in thy mouth and I have covered thee in
[1:11:14] the shadow of mine hand notice that I
[1:11:17] may plant the heavens and lay the
[1:11:20] foundations of the earth and say unto
[1:11:22] Zion Thou Art my people see well how was
[1:11:26] he going to plant the earth and the
[1:11:28] heavens and lay the foundations of the
[1:11:30] Earth by putting his word in the
[1:11:33] prophet's mouth amen the word had to be
[1:11:36] spoken through human lips amen and that
[1:11:38] word had a power can you say amen that's
[1:11:42] right see in Jeremiah 1:9 God said to
[1:11:45] the prophet behold I have put my words
[1:11:48] in thy mouth see I have this day set
[1:11:52] thee over the Nations and over the
[1:11:54] kingdom to root out to pull down to
[1:11:58] destroy and to throw down to build and
[1:12:01] to plant think of that now Jeremiah
[1:12:04] wasn't a king he wasn't he wasn't some
[1:12:07] dignitary he wasn't some ambassador of
[1:12:10] of of of some Nation no he was just a
[1:12:13] simple man amen a prophet that God had
[1:12:17] put his words in the mouth of Jeremiah
[1:12:21] and by that word amen uh uh Jer Jemiah
[1:12:26] amen would would be over the Nations and
[1:12:29] Jeremiah would be over the kingdoms and
[1:12:32] by that word he would root out pull down
[1:12:35] destroy amen throw down and build and
[1:12:39] and plant can you say amen amen by
[1:12:42] putting his words God putting his word
[1:12:45] in the mouth of his Prophet see amen you
[1:12:48] see the word of God cannot be spoken
[1:12:52] without there being an authority amen
[1:12:55] behind the word to bring it to pass your
[1:12:59] words can fall to the ground amen you
[1:13:01] can say something and not meaning amen
[1:13:04] and it be nothing amen the Bible even
[1:13:06] talks about uh uh uh speaking vain
[1:13:08] repetition and and and let letting just
[1:13:11] an idle tongue and and and just our
[1:13:15] words being vain our words just being
[1:13:17] whatever amen see God's word would have
[1:13:21] an authority amen when you speak the
[1:13:24] word of God God you're doing something
[1:13:26] with that word amen when you declare the
[1:13:29] word of God Amen Satan has to give
[1:13:32] notice when you go down in prayer amen
[1:13:35] and take God at his word amen and base
[1:13:38] your prayer upon thus say the Lord Satan
[1:13:42] amen has to give way Satan has to lose
[1:13:45] ground amen because the word is now in
[1:13:49] your
[1:13:51] mouth amen sir that's right you see God
[1:13:56] put his word in Abraham's mouth amen he
[1:14:00] came to Abraham and he called him out
[1:14:04] see it was the grace of God In Action
[1:14:07] Abraham didn't deserve anything amen and
[1:14:10] wasn't asking for anything he wasn't
[1:14:13] even looking for this God Amen he was
[1:14:16] wrapped up in idol worship he had plenty
[1:14:19] of gods to serve and to to worship and
[1:14:22] and all of these things because that's
[1:14:24] all he knew but it was God by Grace
[1:14:27] introduced himself to Abraham amen and
[1:14:30] chose him elected him and called him do
[1:14:34] you believe that amen and not only did
[1:14:37] he call him and elect him but he gave
[1:14:40] Abraham a promise which made him an heir
[1:14:44] of Promise amen it made Abraham an heir
[1:14:48] of Promise because God gave him a
[1:14:52] promise amen now he had an inheritance
[1:14:56] now notice amen what God Said to Abram
[1:14:59] Genesis 12:1 now the Lord had said unto
[1:15:02] Abram get thee out of thy country and
[1:15:05] from thy Kindred and from thy Father's
[1:15:07] House unto a land that I will show thee
[1:15:10] seventh verse and the Lord appeared unto
[1:15:12] Abram and said unto thy seed everybody
[1:15:15] say unto thy seed now he's now notice
[1:15:18] that will I give this land under thy
[1:15:21] seed will I give this land in Genesis 15
[1:15:25] 187 God said unto Abraham I am the Lord
[1:15:28] that brought thee out of her of the CH
[1:15:31] CES to give this land to inherit it
[1:15:35] ain't that right amen So Not only was
[1:15:38] this inheritance amen for Abraham but
[1:15:42] God declared it would be also to
[1:15:44] Abraham's seed a ain't that right amen
[1:15:48] but but now notice the inheritance was a
[1:15:51] natural land and it was given for an
[1:15:54] inheritance to the Natural Seed of
[1:15:56] Abraham amen that's why they're still
[1:15:58] fighting over there people trying to
[1:16:00] take that N Land from Israel but they'll
[1:16:03] not be able to do it because God gave
[1:16:05] them that
[1:16:06] inheritance now if God will protect a
[1:16:09] natural people amen with a natural land
[1:16:12] as a natural inheritance how much will
[1:16:15] he protect
[1:16:16] you can you say amen amen see and so we
[1:16:21] we find amen that that this land was was
[1:16:25] not their land amen they Abraham was in
[1:16:28] another land he wasn't looking for that
[1:16:31] land he wasn't he he he he he wasn't you
[1:16:34] know uh what what is that word uh uh uh
[1:16:37] envying them and and and and and these
[1:16:40] things of that land he was happy where
[1:16:42] he was it was God that came to him God's
[1:16:45] the one that said Abram I am God
[1:16:48] revealed himself and says now get thee
[1:16:50] out of this land I've got another land
[1:16:52] for you that I'm going to give you okay
[1:16:54] that right see it wasn't the land but
[1:16:58] God had given it to them for an
[1:17:02] inheritance by
[1:17:04] promise ain't that right now this shows
[1:17:07] amen us that whoever lived on that land
[1:17:10] didn't known it whoever was living on
[1:17:13] that land at the time didn't own it amen
[1:17:15] and whoever was living on that land when
[1:17:18] Israel was an Egypt did not own it amen
[1:17:21] whoever was living on that land when
[1:17:23] when Israel crossed over into the
[1:17:25] promised land they didn't own it they
[1:17:27] could have said well I've raised my
[1:17:28] babies here and I've I've raised for
[1:17:30] Generations I've raised on this land but
[1:17:33] it wasn't THS to inherit it God gave it
[1:17:36] to Israel God gave it to Abraham and his
[1:17:40] seed can you say Amen why because God
[1:17:44] owned it God owned the land it was his
[1:17:47] Sovereign right Amen to give it to
[1:17:49] whoever he wanted to and I say to you
[1:17:52] Satan doesn't own any land amen that God
[1:17:55] has given you God owns it can you say
[1:17:58] Amen Satan is just a squatter on God's
[1:18:01] Property he has no right to Salvation he
[1:18:04] has no right to Healing he has no right
[1:18:08] Amen to eternal life he has no right to
[1:18:11] Heaven he has no right to Deliverance he
[1:18:13] has no right to your children he has no
[1:18:16] rights to peace and joy and love and
[1:18:19] longsuffering Satan has no rights H God
[1:18:23] gave it to you for your inheritance it's
[1:18:27] your land it's your
[1:18:30] possession by promise that's right by
[1:18:33] promise can you say Amen by promise see
[1:18:37] God owns it amen he's the author of it
[1:18:40] all he's the author of eternal life he's
[1:18:42] the author of Eternal salvation he's the
[1:18:45] author of Eternal peace he's the author
[1:18:47] of Eternal Joy he's the author of divine
[1:18:50] love it comes from him and in his
[1:18:54] sovereignty he looked at you down
[1:18:57] through time and declared it to you he
[1:19:00] gave you that inheritance and said it's
[1:19:02] all
[1:19:03] theirs prise Lord hallelujah therefore
[1:19:06] he made you an heir of all things and
[1:19:10] the prophet said everything that Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ died for is yours you're an heir
[1:19:14] to it you're possessor of all things can
[1:19:18] you say Amen not just uh not not not
[1:19:21] just things that are seen amen but
[1:19:23] things that are unseen you're heir to
[1:19:25] everything you don't have to have joy
[1:19:27] today and Satan take it from you
[1:19:29] tomorrow you're an heir to Eternal Joy
[1:19:32] you're an air to Eternal peace you are
[1:19:35] an air to Eternal salvation no such a
[1:19:39] thing as being saved today and lost
[1:19:41] tomorrow saved next month and lost next
[1:19:43] year you are once for all
[1:19:48] saved you're an heir Lord so you now own
[1:19:52] it and have a right to possess it amen
[1:19:55] if you notice when God told Abraham it's
[1:19:58] to thy
[1:19:59] seat Abraham didn't have a
[1:20:02] seat but God declared it God called it
[1:20:07] as though it wasn't or called that which
[1:20:10] was not as though it already were not
[1:20:14] Abraham if you can come up with the seed
[1:20:16] this will be your seed's inheritance as
[1:20:18] well no it Abraham had already figured
[1:20:21] it out we can't have a child but God
[1:20:25] said it'll be to thy seed which was
[1:20:28] declared to him you going to have a
[1:20:34] child didn't have a seed when God gave
[1:20:37] the land to him and his
[1:20:40] seed it was impossible for him to have a
[1:20:43] seed children ain't that right but
[1:20:46] notice God promised him something that
[1:20:49] was impossible for him Abraham to have
[1:20:55] on his own now I looked up that word
[1:20:58] possible it means capable of being
[1:21:01] done capable of being carried out
[1:21:05] capable ain't that right well but it was
[1:21:10] impossible amen for Abraham to have a
[1:21:13] child right it was in him he could not
[1:21:17] carry it out he could not ensure that it
[1:21:20] comes to pass but it was a promise to
[1:21:24] him that God gave Abraham became heir of
[1:21:28] a promise
[1:21:34] right now think of it the promises that
[1:21:37] God gives do not have to be
[1:21:40] scientifically possible that's right
[1:21:42] right nor do they need to be humanly
[1:21:45] possible right right no promise of God
[1:21:49] is possible by human ability right or
[1:21:52] scientific ability yeah or by the power
[1:21:55] of Education can you say Amen look when
[1:21:59] God told Noah to build an ark because it
[1:22:03] was going to rain it was impossible for
[1:22:07] it to rain brother ramam said see Satan
[1:22:10] explained that it was impossible for it
[1:22:12] to rain from heaven for there was no
[1:22:14] rain up there his great scientific
[1:22:17] gospel that he preached in the Garden of
[1:22:19] Eden see he could shoot the instruments
[1:22:22] to the the moon and prove there was no
[1:22:25] moisture up there but God said there
[1:22:27] would come rain but Satan succeeded and
[1:22:31] poisoned the mind of the People by
[1:22:33] scientific research that it could not be
[1:22:36] done but he could not convince Noah it
[1:22:39] couldn't be done for Noah had hid the
[1:22:42] word of God in his
[1:22:45] heart come on now can you say amen and
[1:22:49] even though it was
[1:22:51] impossible there was a word given that
[1:22:55] made it
[1:22:57] possible when God Called Moses to lead
[1:22:59] the children of
[1:23:01] Israel out of Egypt it was impossible
[1:23:04] for him to do it on his own a one-man
[1:23:08] Invasion Egypt being a a the superow of
[1:23:13] that day the greatest nation of that day
[1:23:17] and yet God told Moses with the stick in
[1:23:20] his hand to go deliver them people from
[1:23:24] the hand of pharaoh ain't that right it
[1:23:27] was
[1:23:28] impossible but the promised word had
[1:23:32] power in it to make it
[1:23:35] possible the word had
[1:23:38] power God didn't need to borrow men's
[1:23:41] power God didn't need to borrow man's
[1:23:44] scientific uh uh uh Geniuses he had the
[1:23:48] power in his word amen that's right when
[1:23:53] Israel came to the land of of
[1:23:54] inheritance there were giants inhabiting
[1:23:57] the land it was impossible for them to
[1:24:01] defeat the Giants by their own ability
[1:24:04] that's what calls the the the 10 spies
[1:24:07] and and and the rest of them to to
[1:24:11] forget about God's word because they
[1:24:13] looked at their own abilities and said
[1:24:15] how are we going to possess this how are
[1:24:17] we going to defeat them Giants how are
[1:24:19] we going to have our inheritance when
[1:24:20] there's giants that are standing in our
[1:24:22] way we are as grass ERS in their
[1:24:26] sight they look to their own ability can
[1:24:29] you sayen see it was impossible but the
[1:24:32] word that came forth from that prophet's
[1:24:34] mouth had power in it to make it
[1:24:39] possible that's right come on now when
[1:24:42] Joshua led the children of Israel up to
[1:24:45] the city of Jericho it was impossible to
[1:24:49] conquer that City on their own amen the
[1:24:52] city was fortified by high walls and
[1:24:54] thick walls ain't that right but the
[1:24:57] word of God had power in it to make it
[1:25:01] possible you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:04] amen you're air a
[1:25:06] promise not what what the government
[1:25:09] promised you amen not not what your
[1:25:11] daddy and mama promised you but what God
[1:25:14] promised you you're air of that promise
[1:25:17] and that promise has the power in it to
[1:25:20] make it
[1:25:22] possible amen when God said a virgin
[1:25:25] would bear a son it was absolutely
[1:25:27] impossible for that to happen but the
[1:25:30] power in the word of God made it
[1:25:34] possible can you say amen I hope it
[1:25:37] making sense to you tonight but the
[1:25:40] inheritance amen is it made possible
[1:25:43] amen by the ability of man The
[1:25:47] Inheritance is based upon the word of
[1:25:50] God and the word makes it possible amen
[1:25:55] amen amen you love him now the word of
[1:25:59] God is our
[1:26:01] inheritance Lord every promise in this
[1:26:04] Bible is yours you're air to you're air

[1:26:15] promised to you th this is your
[1:26:18] inheritance amen don't don't don't just
[1:26:20] throw this this treat this old Bible in
[1:26:23] any old way
[1:26:24] amen even the prophet taught us not to
[1:26:26] even put something on this Bible amen
[1:26:29] don't lay stuff on this Bible this is
[1:26:30] your inheritance can you say Amen
[1:26:33] there's things in you that are given to
[1:26:35] you that is given to no other
[1:26:38] man amen Kings can't even possess this
[1:26:42] amen monarchs can't even possess this
[1:26:45] but here we are chosen by God Amen and
[1:26:49] given an inheritance and every promise
[1:26:52] in this book is
[1:26:54] yours
[1:26:56] hallu yes sir amen come now aren't you
[1:27:00] glad for
[1:27:02] that
[1:27:04] Amen in this Bible it speaks of an
[1:27:07] Incorruptible body that's you're an air
[1:27:10] to it speaks of a throne you're an heir
[1:27:13] to it you believe it amen it speaks of a
[1:27:17] kingdom an eternal Kingdom you're an
[1:27:19] heir to it it speaks of a millennium
[1:27:22] you're an heir to it it speaks of a an
[1:27:25] eternal City you're an heir to it right
[1:27:29] everything of God's promise you're an
[1:27:31] heir too amen now notice what Jesus said
[1:27:35] all things everybody say all things all
[1:27:38] things say with me now all things are
[1:27:43] possible to them that are skilled in
[1:27:47] making bombs to them that know how to
[1:27:49] blow up the Earth to them that have
[1:27:52] great military power no all things are
[1:27:56] possible to them that
[1:27:59] believe can you say Amen nations are
[1:28:03] accumulating bombs and yet they with all
[1:28:05] of that military power they're not
[1:28:07] making all things possible the things
[1:28:10] that you are an air to you cannot get it
[1:28:12] through bombs you cannot get it through
[1:28:14] military power but all things are
[1:28:17] possible to them that
[1:28:21] believe
[1:28:22] amen glory right remember where
[1:28:28] Paul talked of people having a form of
[1:28:31] godliness and den denying the power
[1:28:33] thereof yeah you know what brother Bram
[1:28:36] said they're denying the power of the
[1:28:40] word the word has power right to make
[1:28:44] things
[1:28:45] possible the
[1:28:47] word amen it was
[1:28:51] impossible amen for for Samson to take a
[1:28:58] Jawbone an old dry jaw Jawbone of a
[1:29:02] donkey and defeat a thousand
[1:29:05] Philistines but the word made it
[1:29:08] possible can you say
[1:29:10] amen amen it was
[1:29:12] impossible amen for for uh uh David to
[1:29:17] to defeat Goliath amen here he was a boy
[1:29:21] not trained in military might and there
[1:29:24] was that big old Goliath that could have
[1:29:27] just squashed him like a bug it was
[1:29:30] impossible for David to gain the victory
[1:29:33] but the word made it possible see and
[1:29:37] the world is denying the power of the
[1:29:41] word but what that power is notice it's
[1:29:46] creative power coming from a creative
[1:29:51] word that's right amen you're not
[1:29:54] limited by by what you can't see you're

[1:33:53] God believed his own word he believed
[1:33:55] his own word therefore you being a part
[1:33:58] of God you believe God's word when God
[1:34:01] spoke his word concerning Christ being
[1:34:03] born of a virgin he did not look for
[1:34:06] Plan
[1:34:07] B he did not look for some alternative
[1:34:11] that's right thousands of years amen
[1:34:15] between the giving of the promise and
[1:34:17] the promise coming there was thousands
[1:34:19] of years that God remained faithful in
[1:34:23] believing in his word amen can you say
[1:34:27] amen God chose you before the foundation
[1:34:30] of the world Prophet said you always
[1:34:31] were saved you weren't saved on any
[1:34:34] given day you always were saved and all
[1:34:38] of this time God faithful to believe his
[1:34:41] word about you he knew you were going to
[1:34:44] come he knew the exact moment you were
[1:34:47] going to surrender your life you might
[1:34:49] have been born out in Sin from a sinful
[1:34:51] family you might have been a drunk a
[1:34:53] Prost itute a liar you might have amen
[1:34:55] displayed every attribute of Satan amen
[1:34:58] and never anything good about you
[1:35:01] concerning God that God remained
[1:35:03] faithful in believing his
[1:35:06] promise prise the Lord God didn't look
[1:35:09] for any alternative no on God didn't
[1:35:12] look for Plan B no God didn't look for
[1:35:14] somebody else to take your place God was
[1:35:17] so sure of his word the prophet said
[1:35:19] nobody can take your place I don't care
[1:35:21] how insignificant you feel tonight how
[1:35:23] un worthy you feel tonight and how low
[1:35:26] you feel tonight there is nobody can
[1:35:28] take your place God is faithful to his
[1:35:31] word and that's the way he believes it
[1:35:33] and that's the way you must believe it
[1:35:36] if God called you you must believe
[1:35:38] that hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:43] amen when he called Moses to lead the
[1:35:45] people out and told him how to do
[1:35:48] it Moses
[1:35:51] was full of weakness
[1:35:57] yeah it's the way God wanted
[1:35:59] it God didn't look for some alternative
[1:36:03] just in case Moses failed him yeah
[1:36:05] that's good no the prophet said God
[1:36:07] stood behind Moses in all of his
[1:36:09] mistakes hello and it wasn't that he was
[1:36:12] faithful to Moses it was he was faithful
[1:36:14] to his word and his word said I
[1:36:17] predestinated Moses I predestinated
[1:36:20] Moses Moses was not plan B Moses wasn't
[1:36:23] Plan D or plan Z Moses was the I idea
[1:36:28] that God had in his mind to begin
[1:36:32] well God was the or Moses was the
[1:36:35] thought the attribute God simply
[1:36:39] believed his own word you believe that
[1:36:42] now notice now 2 Corinthians
[1:36:44] 4:13 I won't keep you much longer but

[1:42:23] that no squirrels would ever go amen you
[1:42:26] never usually don't find a squirrel on
[1:42:28] it he said let a squirrel come from that
[1:42:30] Branch du D du and and look at the
[1:42:32] farmer out there he said no longer did I
[1:42:35] say that here come a squirrel running
[1:42:36] down the tree on that Branch looking at
[1:42:39] the at the farmer and he shot it right
[1:42:43] and and he waited and waited you know
[1:42:45] and and I'm not clear on the story had
[1:42:47] been a a little bit since I've heard it
[1:42:48] but you know it enough amen but he
[1:42:51] waited and waited he was going to go
[1:42:52] home
[1:42:53] and and and and uh uh the but and and
[1:42:58] then the voice God held him to his own
[1:43:01] word and said but you said three that's
[1:43:05] right he was happy just that one he was
[1:43:08] all excited but you said it what was it
[1:43:13] God couldn't let that word fall to the
[1:43:16] ground it was his word being spoken
[1:43:20] through mortal lips
[1:43:23] amen that's good showing us that it
[1:43:26] wasn't just a word Doctrine restored to
[1:43:29] us it wasn't just the theology restored
[1:43:32] to us it was the creative word restored
[1:43:37] to us which restored back creative
[1:43:41] power amen
[1:43:44] hallelujah and if you
[1:43:46] notice if I could say it this way the
[1:43:48] prophet put the word in our mouth yes
[1:43:50] sir that's right the prophet put our the
[1:43:53] word in our mouth yeah praise the Lord
[1:43:55] did he not say that the word is in the
[1:43:57] bride amen how did the word get there in
[1:44:00] that bride a prophet praise the Lord
[1:44:03] amen come on now come on church that's
[1:44:06] right the prophet put the word in the

[1:44:16] say come the spirit and the bride say
[1:44:19] come ain't that right now where's she
[1:44:21] going to get the words to speak she's
[1:44:23] got a voice now Amen brother brand said
[1:44:26] she's the final voice to the final age
[1:44:28] so now she's got a word in her mouth
[1:44:31] it's been hid in her the word is in the
[1:44:33] bride can you say amen and now it's in
[1:44:36] her mouth but where does she get that
[1:44:38] word to speak brother Brown said listen
[1:44:40] to the authenticated prophet of God who
[1:44:42] appears in this last age what he says
[1:44:45] from God the bride will sayen say that
[1:44:48] again what he says from God the bride
[1:44:50] will say the spirit and the prop prophet
[1:44:53] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:44:57] thing amen can you say amen and what
[1:45:01] they say will have already been said
[1:45:03] already been written in the
[1:45:05] word can you say Amen everything that
[1:45:09] was sealed up in this book has now been
[1:45:12] made known to us
[1:45:15] amen praise Lord you believe
[1:45:18] it in Paul's age the word was sealed up
[1:45:22] for he spoke in a mystery yeah that's
[1:45:25] right I want to make it very clear Paul
[1:45:27] was not
[1:45:28] probing as the other
[1:45:30] ages he was a prophet but he spoke in
[1:45:34] mystery amen can you say Amen in
[1:45:38] Luther's age the word was sealed up in
[1:45:40] Wesley's age the word was sealed up in
[1:45:42] the Pentecostal age the word was sealed
[1:45:44] up this book The Prophet said has been
[1:45:46] probed at the through these
[1:45:48] denominational years and this word probe
[1:45:51] means to examine to to investigate to
[1:45:54] try to understand right that's right and
[1:45:57] they were reformers they were Scholars
[1:45:59] they were commentators that were just
[1:46:02] probing at the
[1:46:04] worken ain't that right but notice the
[1:46:07] seventh Angels message did not come from
[1:46:10] a man probing at the word amen guessing
[1:46:15] and hitting and missing again oh they
[1:46:18] all want to say that brother Brandon
[1:46:19] wasn't correct with this
[1:46:21] Bible come on now
[1:46:23] that he taught things that the Bible
[1:46:24] didn't teach hogwash it's just their
[1:46:27] eyes are blinded to this
[1:46:29] word that's right can you say Amen yes
[1:46:32] sir the prophet of Malachi 4 didn't
[1:46:35] restore our hearts back to the word by
[1:46:37] just probing at the word if he was just
[1:46:40] another prober at the word then then
[1:46:42] Luther and and Wesley and all of them
[1:46:45] ministers amen as good as they were they
[1:46:47] were just probers and they would have
[1:46:49] restored us
[1:46:50] back come on but God didn't use them men
[1:46:54] to restore this bride back God sent a
[1:46:57] Malachi for
[1:47:00] prophit to restore this bride back a
[1:47:04] prophet never has to probe at the word
[1:47:07] for the Revelation always comes to him
[1:47:11] the word comes to the
[1:47:15] prophets do you believe it brother
[1:47:18] Braham said a prophet not
[1:47:20] only means not only to speak the word
[1:47:23] but also to forth tell and is a Divine
[1:47:28] interpretator of the word divine word
[1:47:32] written so he's a Divine interpreter of
[1:47:36] the word no probing he's a Divine an
[1:47:39] interpreter of the written word amen
[1:47:43] amen are you with me see so then we find
[1:47:48] that the seventh angel is a prophet had
[1:47:51] to be a prophet yeah for when the lamb
[1:47:54] took the book from him that sat on the
[1:47:57] throne and El loosed the Seven Seals
[1:48:00] thereof and it was an open book now the
[1:48:04] mighty Angel comes down and descends
[1:48:07] with an open book and the prophet said
[1:48:09] the seventh angel is on Earth at the
[1:48:11] same time at this
[1:48:14] coming and the mighty Angel gives the
[1:48:17] book
[1:48:18] Revelation to that Prophet praise the
[1:48:21] Lord that Angel to reveal it to his
[1:48:27] people wow this is the time for
[1:48:30] manifestation of sons of God this is the
[1:48:34] time for matured Sons to speak the word
[1:48:38] and watch lightning
[1:48:40] flash amen where he says it'll flash
[1:48:43] like
[1:48:44] lightning can you say amen that's right
[1:48:46] remember it was only when the book was
[1:48:49] open not through all the other ages all
[1:48:52] only when the book was open after that
[1:48:55] book was open John was told to go get
[1:48:59] the book and eat it
[1:49:01] amen
[1:49:03] amen that's right what eat the
[1:49:08] Revelation get it in your heart
[1:49:11] amen why because after he ate it he was
[1:49:14] told to speak amen thou must prophesy
[1:49:19] prophesy speak
[1:49:22] can you say
[1:49:24] Amen Let It Be An utterance of
[1:49:28] words
[1:49:30] amen and more than just in the mouth
[1:49:32] it's becoming a living voice yes amen
[1:49:36] that's good can you say amen
[1:49:39] amen now this last day bride is not
[1:49:42] speaking words that come from a man that
[1:49:45] probed at the book no can you say Amen
[1:49:49] do you realize we understand the word
[1:49:52] that Paul preached better than
[1:49:55] those that set under Paul's Ministry
[1:49:57] sure amen as a great man he was and a
[1:50:01] great teacher Paul was yet we are a
[1:50:04] people that understand what he taught
[1:50:07] better than what they taught they they
[1:50:09] understood it to be can you say Amen why
[1:50:14] because the prophet of this last day
[1:50:16] this seventh angel messenger did not
[1:50:19] preach the word in mystery he revealed
[1:50:23] the mystery he revealed The Mystery of
[1:50:26] the godhead he revealed The Mystery of
[1:50:28] the Rapture he revealed The Mystery of
[1:50:31] the resurrection and the body
[1:50:33] change he revealed The Mystery of the
[1:50:36] Bride Can you say Amen we have a better
[1:50:40] revelation of justification than what
[1:50:41] Luther had we have a greater
[1:50:44] understanding of sanctification than
[1:50:45] what Wesley had we had a greater a
[1:50:47] greater understanding of the gifts and
[1:50:49] how they are to be operated than what
[1:50:50] the Pentecostals had in the p
[1:50:52] Pentecostal age for brother brandom said
[1:50:54] we do have today by God's help the
[1:50:56] perfect interpretation of the word
[1:50:59] perfect interpretation perfect clear
[1:51:02] interpretation the perfect Revelation
[1:51:05] with Divine Vindication then that which
[1:51:09] is in part is done away with can you say
[1:51:13] amen hallelujah that's right you don't
[1:51:15] have to go back to Luther amen and uh to
[1:51:18] understand justification you don't have
[1:51:20] to go back to what Wesley said
[1:51:23] understand sanctification you don't have
[1:51:25] to go back to what the Pentecostals
[1:51:27] taught to understand what the baptism of
[1:51:29] the Holy Ghost is and how to operate the
[1:51:31] gifts and and all of these things we now
[1:51:34] have a perfect interpretation of the
[1:51:37] Divine word love it amen that's true
[1:51:41] that which is in our
[1:51:43] mouth is the perfect
[1:51:46] interpretation of the word about it amen
[1:51:50] blessed we are amen true prophets speak
[1:51:53] of this true
[1:51:54] word and then that puts God exactly the
[1:51:57] same God same power same words the same
[1:52:03] everything the true word amen and now
[1:52:06] they the people had to believe they had
[1:52:08] to believe the prophet's word and Obey
[1:52:11] it before they could see God's Miracles
[1:52:15] can you say Amen if you notice brother
[1:52:17] Brown said as the wise men follow the
[1:52:19] star to the source of Eternal Light so
[1:52:22] will wise men today who are not blinded
[1:52:25] by Creeds they'll follow the god-given
[1:52:27] spoken word till they see the fullness
[1:52:30] of the power of God blooming forth in
[1:52:32] this hour oh my can you say Amen every
[1:52:36] promise that had been laying in this
[1:52:38] Bible is now to be made manifest by the
[1:52:41] sons of God because they are following
[1:52:44] and obeying what a prophet said they are
[1:52:47] receiving the word of a prophet can you
[1:52:49] say Amen even Paul would tell the people
[1:52:51] you receive not this word as though it
[1:52:54] was from a man but you indeed received
[1:52:56] it as of God which it
[1:53:00] is
[1:53:03] yes you love him that's good amen now
[1:53:07] notice as we
[1:53:09] close Abraham's confession was a
[1:53:13] sign that he had accepted what God Said
[1:53:16] as being the truth prise the Lord his
[1:53:19] confession was a sign that he had
[1:53:22] accepted what God Said as being the
[1:53:26] truth and the Word was in his mouth and
[1:53:31] he
[1:53:32] confessed and it brought about the
[1:53:36] impossibility and they had a son just
[1:53:40] like God said like he said can you say
[1:53:43] amen amen if the musicians will come
[1:53:46] prise the Lord Brother brandom said you
[1:53:48] are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of
[1:53:50] the son of the Living God hallelujah
[1:53:53] what's he doing he's putting a word in
[1:53:54] you amen he's showing you what you air
[1:53:58] to you are the pure virtuous sinless
[1:54:01] Bride of the son of the Living God every
[1:54:04] man and woman that's born of the spirit
[1:54:06] of God and washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:54:08] Christ and believes every word of God
[1:54:11] stands as though you never sinned at the
[1:54:13] first place you are
[1:54:18] perfect you are
[1:54:21] perfect can you say amen that's right
[1:54:24] declaring those things that are not as
[1:54:27] though they already exist I am perfect I
[1:54:31] am perfect oh but you done this
[1:54:33] yesterday or you this and you got all
[1:54:35] this and you you you just got a mountain
[1:54:37] load of problems and all this but I am
[1:54:41] perfect can you say amen that's right
[1:54:44] you're not a sinner anymore but sons of
[1:54:47] God brother Braham said Jesus the word
[1:54:50] took my place he become me that sinner
[1:54:53] that I might become him the word let me
[1:54:56] hold true to it not the church the word
[1:55:00] all that spiritual union of Christ and
[1:55:02] his church now when the flesh is
[1:55:05] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:55:07] flesh manifested Vindicated just what
[1:55:11] the Bible said would happen in this day
[1:55:13] it's happening day by day why it's
[1:55:16] accumulating so fast out there in those
[1:55:19] deserts and things taking place that I
[1:55:21] couldn't even keep up with with it we're
[1:55:23] near the coming of Jesus to be United
[1:55:26] with this church where the word becomes

[1:55:35] happiest people the word becoming the
[1:55:37] [Applause]

[1:55:41] possession of everything that God
[1:55:44] promised in this
[1:55:47] day the word becoming the word and
[1:55:51] notice the power of
[1:55:53] confession brother brandham said when we
[1:55:56] confess that the life of Jesus Christ is
[1:55:58] in US eternal life then the life itself
[1:56:03] will
[1:56:04] testify of what we
