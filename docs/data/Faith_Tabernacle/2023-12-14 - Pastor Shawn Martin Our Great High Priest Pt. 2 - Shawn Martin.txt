part you it is no secret what God can do amen well we can truly say that for the Lord has shown himself to be real in this age amen and we can truly say he's alive and well then he can do the impossible amen and um certainly good to see everyone in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night good to have brother Tim amen with us as well and and the musicians can be dismissed if you uh have your Bibles we're just going to go right into the word um Hebrews uh the fourth chapter um Hebrews chapter 4 and uh um going to read the the 14th verse uh or start there praise the Lord but before we uh go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the author of the word father truly we are people that know what you can do that you work the impossible Lord when science fails when the doctors fail when we fail ourselves Lord that father you are still faithful and you remain God and Lord how we love you for that and Lord we have come under great expectation tonight to hear from you and to see you perform we had ask Lord that you would come and have your way feel at home here tonight Among Us Lord anoint the word word and want the speaking and the hearing of your word father is our prayer Lord let every need that is here let it be met father we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord now the um Hebrews the 4th chapter the 14th verse says saying then we have a high priest or a great high priest that is pass into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need then if you'll go to the 10th chapter same book um chapter 10 and verse 23 says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised amen you can have your seats and I'm so thankful for the grace of God and um uh if it hadn't been for his grace then uh we would be in certainly a lot of trouble we we wouldn't have any hope of eternal life there would be no Rapture there would be no Millennium there would be no body change there'd be no Heavens or New Earth and and we certainly wouldn't be preaching uh the things that we preach wouldn't be believing the things that we believe we wouldn't even have faith amen man but it's it's by the grace of God and you know we we know according to the scriptures that that God predestinated a church and uh to be uh without spot wrink or blemish and he said he would have a church like that when he came and and so that that is a high standard uh that God had set for for you and I is that we would be without spot wrinkle or blemish and several scriptures that I'm just going to read right through uh Matthew 5:48 Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen 1 Corinthians 1:8 breaking again that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ Philippians 2:15 that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke uh 1 Thessalonians 5 23 breaking in I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and notice how he puts it in the second verse there there the 24th verse Faithful Is He that called you and who also will do it so so we get the idea that we are to be perfect we are to be blameless without spot wrinkle or blemish undefiled and yeah uh uh this could only happen uh uh through uh the work of redemption so if it had not been for Grace we we wouldn't even have the word redemption in our vocabulary and uh it certainly wouldn't be in our songs or our sermons it it it certainly wouldn't be our heartbeat but but of course as the prophet brought Redemption out so beautifully to us uh Redemption is to bring back to its uh original condition and and so of course this is redemption of nature the Redemption of man and and so man is restored back to fellowship with god um his Dominion that he once had is restored back to him his innocence is restored the word uh that he had lost is restored unto him and so under this this Banner of redemption uh man is no longer a sinner uh he he cannot and and and you know I I pray that God really puts that into our hearts and and and reveals that to us because how can we have faith and this is this is where uh the Apostle Paul as we read let us uh hold fast the profession or confession of our faith so so our Faith uh um there's a confession that we and I you you and I must have and and it must be the confession of faith and then that Faith must rest in something that is is solid and and so if if we're up and down and and we're tossed to and fro and and and and uh we're not really secure and anchored then then we can never hold fast to the profession of Faith or the confession of our faith so God has given us something that would anchor us and under this law of redemption then you are no longer a sinner so you're not a sinner to uh today and tomorrow you're a Christian and to Next Day You're a sinner and and it's topy you know Topsy Turvy because you cannot maintain your confession of faith if if you're up and down so so then uh uh uh uh in this Redemption man is restored back to his original condition fear has no more hold on him um uh sin or Satan um has no more hold sickness and disease has no more right Amen to uh uh inhabit your your life you afflict your body or or whatever because as we were saying last um uh uh Wednesday and I'd like to get more into that uh eventually but uh Calvary took care of not only your spiritual problem but he it took care of your physical amen sickness and disease has been taken care of under this uh Banner of of redemption amen and so this is all about the grace of God though uh uh because before there could be Redemption then God required a payment uh for sin and and uh uh it it had to be paid in full and and so that was that's the question as uh you know who who who could have paid for that and who could have met that and and you know uh according to God's law of redemption not just anybody could pay the price ain't that right not anybody could and and I God uh uh it for one it it had to be a kinsman redeemer so then the prophet says even though the Angels were worthy they're sinless they they could not uh redeem us they could not meet God's requirement uh because there it it to be to redeem man it had to take a man uh uh to bring Redemption and so uh he had to be a kinsman redeemer uh uh so so he had to be a man and and and then we know that this man had to be worthy ain't that right amen so Prophet said he couldn't be some Outlaw he he had to be you know religious sinless a good person and and things like that then he had to be able to redeem and then the prophet said he had to make a public testimony before the elders that he had redeemed ain't that right so we we that the Angels couldn't redeem and yet no man there was no man uh in his Fallen condition that could take on that kinsman redeemer amen could not meet the requirements because as we talked about Wednesday night that God the price that God required for Redemption was blood ain't that right amen that it was blood see the prophet said it was blood that took man out of the garden uh sex blood ain't that right and so this is why Abel uh uh offered a lamb unto God because he had a revelation that it was blood that that took them out amen and the prophet said see it uh uh uh he saw that it was a sexual Affair Through Blood and that that took man out of the garden another place it was an apples that brought us out of the garden like people think here today but it was blood life more life that took us out of the garden it was not fruit that brought them out Eve never ate no apples certainly see so how did she realize she was naked if she ate an apple Prophet said we need to pass the apples around again right if it was Apples amen but it it it it he said it pertained to the sexual life amen see so life doesn't lay in Plants it lays in Blood and and Leviticus 17711 it says for the light life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul aren't you glad for that amen so it's the blood amen and and under God's law he required life for life and and so it it couldn't be nothing else but but but the blood amen so blood had to be offered the prophet said as a substitute because the Bloods were life laid and God required life at sin so then we know that that the animal blood it was not sufficient to to to bring this Redemption and and uh to pay the price of sin amen for one it it had no soul and so the the life even though it was an innocent lamb but it had no soul so the life could not mix uh its life could not mix with the life of of the human life ain't that right and and so uh uh uh we we know that in the Old Testament God ordained the high priest and and uh uh it it was there that that high priest was to be a mediator and and and an an intercessor but he could not be an intercessor by bringing fruit he he couldn't be an intercessor by bringing himself uh he had to bring blood Amen in order to intered ain't that right amen so but the only blood he had was the animal blood that he could offer unto the Lord but as we know as Paul taught us and and things that that blood that blood of that animal life could not uh divorce sin it it wasn't sufficient and as Paul would tell us in Hebrews it could not make the worshipper perfect ain't that right so so then sin had to be divorced in order for Eternal Redemption uh uh to be obtained and and and so brother brandom said see the blood made a covering that animal blood it made a covering but it could not perfectly atone see the man left the building with the same desire to sin as he had in the first and uh first place and and so uh um uh it says but doing this he was looking forward to a time uh when there would be a perfect lamb come and he did it on the burnt offering because it was the only way he knew about see so he said see when the blood was pouring and the life went from the animal it could not go back to the man for uh one was animal one the other was man and and so an innocent animal to a guilty man see it just couldn't do it so this is why we have to have the Holy Ghost and this is why Satan fights us on the Holy Ghost and and if there's ever anything that Satan wants to keep you from or to keep anybody from and that is receiving the true baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see because when that life of God the Holy Ghost is it's not a sensation it's it's more than just a tickle it's more than just whatever it is the life of God returning back up on the believer declaring that your sin has been separated from you amen your sin has been separated from you and and so it's the only way that sin can be divorced and that man can come back into uh uh Redemption aren't you glad for that amen so this this is why it took a kinsman redeemer to redeem amen uh because uh the life of an animal could not mix with the life of a of the human being the blood and and things like that see and so the kinsman redeemer the only way see you know people people think well I've come to the Altar and and but then they get up and and then they just be continue being a sinner it's they're they're safe Sinners or religious Sinners or whatever want to call it amen but that's not what Redemption is it it had to take somebody to divorce the sin it it had to take somebody to take that root of sin out of us anden it's one thing to keep getting forgiven you know you know and over and over and over and over and and coming back to the Altar and coming back to the Altar and coming back to the altar but see there there comes a time when you you just stop amen re saying the sinner's prayer it it it just comes a time when you just stop amen that's what God wanted so we can move up and and move on and recognize who we are get past being a sinner can you say Amen so his his life uh it had to come back upon the believer but in order for it to come back upon the human being there had to be a perfect blood to bring forth a perfect life amen now we realize that human blood just could not work amen because the prophet said it was sinful blood every human being on the face of the Earth has sex blood which in turn is sinful blood amen so all of us are born by sexual desire and blood in us or sinful blood the prophet said through a perverted way of bringing children to the Earth ain't that right see another place he says see man cannot do do it in himself he's a total failure now if there's ever anything that this Christian Life and this message ought to teach us and that is get away from ourselves you you can never ever perfect yourself you can never ever help yourself in any way can you say amen and if you can't do it then no other man can do it if if you can't get yourself out of the pit then the guy in the pit with you can't get yourself get you out of the pit as well amen see so man is total failure and he says God let him see that through the law through the judges and through all the Old Testament he sent the prophet he sent the righteous men and they found out that everyone fell every Prophet has fallen every every patriarch has fallen every there there was nothing Worthy can you say Amen John even saw that when the voice there uh uh uh when the book was closed there went a voice that said who is worthy to open the book and and the prophet lets us in this and and everyone was around and John began to search and he looked and and and all the prophets that he looked to had to hold their head down and the Patriarchs had to hold their head down as good of men as they were and anointed men and great Ministries that they had on the face of the earth when they were here but they all had to hold their head down because nothing was worthy ain't that right well the Bible says that the law made nothing perfect and and and I want to uh uh uh just get that to us for just a moment the law everybody say the law made nothing perfect it it amazes me how people still want the law amen but the law was nothing but carnal Commandments am amen and and and and we all know that uh uh according to the message that it was not God's idea Amen to give the people his law amen he chose them by grace that he he you know that that's what he started Abraham out as is by Grace amen an unconditional Covenant ain't that right so so we are today to live by his grace it's it's through Grace that that we see election the promises are given by grace and not by law the the the power of God is known by Grace the faithfulness of God is known by Grace the longsuffering of God the mercy of God the patience of God Amen and and the loving kindness of God is known by Grace see so it was Israel that chose to live by law amen and and instead of living by the grace of God but here's what a prophet says you can't everybody say I can't no matter what you do you he says you quit you quit drinking you can quit smoking quit telling lies you can even go to church and try to do this and try to do that and yet you're still carnal he said see that's just law you're not perfected by a carnal commandment you're not restored to God by a carnal commandment you'll not go in a Rapture by a carnal commandment amen you're not healed by a carnal commandment can you can you say Amen you're not justified by a carnal commandment so so we we don't want to live under a law we don't want to live under carnal commandment amen faith is shut up under the law you the car that carnal Commandment that law cannot bring forth Faith to where we can actually rest in every Divine promise of God can you say amen amen how can you hold hold fast to your profession uh of faith that confession of faith when you're living by law amen you do good today but tomorrow you're going to fall somewhere amen and then in your own mind you're going to have to start back all over again and and it becomes a merit system and we all know how that goes I know how it is when I go on to die you know and and when you fall off the wagon then you have to like man I got to go it again you know and it's almost like you got to start all over again but do you realize that you don't have to start all over with God Amen God doesn't want you to have to start all over God wants us to be established in his grace can you say amen amen not not saying well well bless God I feel great today I I'm going in a Rapture oh I'm saved I'm I'm I'm Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost well what about tomorrow when you don't have them feelings what about tomorrow when you when you fall flat upon your face you've got to have something to maintain that that profession of Faith amen whether I feel like it or not I'm still going can you say Amen see God never intended for us to be legalist brother brandom said there's no scratch of legalist in the Bible amen it's it's it's I I'll be honest it's carnal Minds that finds legalism in the Bible but but but you'll never find in this message a true Revelation now when you get a true revelation of the message you'll never find legalism in the Bible can you Amen brother Bram said I'm calvinist and and he says now I'm legalist wherever the Bible is but he says I'm more I lean more to calvinist than I do the legalist side amen why because it it it you you you've got Amen to have your faith established in the grace of God in the works of God in the in the power of God Amen I find amen that legalism does not establish the people's faith in Christ amen if if if if there's you know uh you know we we were around that stuff of of legalism and things and and you never found people just SOL it in faith you you really never found them just anchored in faith it was just constantly oh please God I hope God I wish God I I I don't know and and and and you go go go look in into a lot of these guys that that do that they got the altars full of the same people just about every service amen because they're they fa somewhere and and if if you're looking at yourself amen you're you're going to fail every day and and well the prophet says you know we backslide every day and you know what it's good to it's good that a prophet would tell us that it's okay to say that right that we backslide every day amen see but legalism doesn't establish the people's faith in Christ but rather it in instead of pointing them to Christ it points them to to themselves brother Brown says well I might quit lying quit stealing quit committing adultery quit chewing quit all these things and I'm still carnal God doesn't receive it are you with me God doesn't receive it because I have nothing to offer him in propitiation oh my see how could we come into worship amen and truly come into the presence of God Amen based upon what we have done well thank God that don't smoke but that doesn't save you thank God you don't drink but that ain't meaning anything amen uh uh I know Sinners that have just totally quit smoking amen for any any kind of Reason maybe they just get tired of it or maybe they just trying to do it for their grandchild or the children now that they're born or you you never know amen but when you come to God you have to have something as a propitiation to bring to him and it ain't our works see see so legalism passes the work of redemption do you believe that so here here uh Hebrews 7 and 18 just breaking in Paul says there is verely a dising everybody say a dis analing of the Commandment going before for the weakness and profitable un unprofitableness thereof so there is a disining of that law there's a dising of that carnal commandment for the law made nothing perfect but notice but the bringing of a in of a better hope did now the prophet says now what is that better hope it's Christ amen that is the thing that would make us perfect the law made nothing perfect the carinal man commandment made nothing perfect amen it it only just caused man to to recognize more and more that he's a failure that he's a sinner that he's a no good individual well I want to tell you something there's more than just is coming to church and hearing and and feeling so rejected and so beat down that's not what church is for sure judgment begins at the house of God Amen but let Grace be preached let the blood be effective in a man's life to where we can leave he can he can leave feeling saved he knows that he's a Son of God he's a child of God can you say Amen so for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better did and that's Christ by the which we draw nigh unto God Amen now the prophet says that I won't keep you much longer but God God can only work through Perfection because he's perfect now you think of that here God chose man to work through man he only works through man he's man's going to carry out his plan man is going to carry out his his work and his purpose and man's got the ones that's got the ministry you're the one that's got a do it if anybody's got going to do it you're the one that's going to do it amen I I you know you you can you can sit there on the bench and cry your little hearts out and and say well I just don't know and you can feel helpless all you want but if you're part of the body of Christ God's depending upon you to do something now you remember what Moses done when he faced the Red Sea sat there and just bald and boohoo and all that and God got upset with him and Moses I'm the one that called you to do it why you sitting there calling me I put you on this commission now you go do it you you speak to that thing can you say Amen see so so we can get all down in the dumps and mly grubs and all of that and act like amen there ain't no hope and all that well if you're the bride of Christ God puts you in charge of the situation for you to speak to the mountain for you to say it for you he's the one that said greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world so don't sit there and bellyache about things look at the promise of God now God God see God chose man to work through but he can only work through Perfection amen because he's perfect now notice another place brother Brown said it has to be a perfect channel that God works through cuz he can do nothing else but work through Perfection so then that that leaves us into a what are we then amen see well then if we are the channel that God works through then he's got to have something Perfection Perfection oh to think of that God God would work through a perfect church God would work through a perfect individual God Amen if he chose you amen then he only chose you because he can work through you and yet God only works through Perfection through that which is perfect can you sayen so I hope this all right but Ephesians 1:4 Paul says according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy and with Without Blame before him everybody say before him amen a god that is Holy a God that can't stand sin a God that hates the very thought of sin that amen and and and yet our own righteousness is as filthy rags in his sight and yet he chose you amen before the foundation of the world that you should be holy and Without Blame sinless spotless blameless before not Shawn Martin not before the Deacon board not before the pope or the president and everybody who's and alls over you but before the very God that cannot stand the the the stench of sin can't even look upon sin without his wrath being exercised and yet he chose you to stand before him holy blameless less spotless good sir God had already chosen us to be that God holy and Without Blame before him in love if he chose us then the all-wise God and the Bible says he's the all wise God he wouldn't have done something beforehand I mean has ever done anything you know and and you really don't know what you're doing I I remember remember dad trying to be a shade tree mechanic we didn't know anything about cars but we were broke so he going to do it himself and me and me and Wendell of course was appointed to help and oh I hated that cold and then he had to yes bless my heart and and we we had to take out the transmission and so we're out bundled up you know and and we started fairly early that morning we finally got it all done out which was good and so we didn't have phones and all that to take a step by step and and so Dad would go into the house make a phone call and try to get some ideas and porner and then we'd go out there and we would put that puppy up and and and you know it it was a um it was a uh a not an automatic a manual where you had to stab that thing in there and that transmission and oh it was a mess we finally got it stabbed in there and I'm secretly you know and and we get all the boats but that last one and then you know as we're looking around starting me and windows already cleaning up I mean you know Dad's got this we're done you know and then we see this part and and we say now dad what what do you think this is and he looks at it and stares at it for a little bit and he says boys we got to redo it got to do it again like Dad you you got to be kidding don't you think that thing will run without this no no we got to redo it you know I remember I remember you know we done it five times taking that crazy thing out you know I really wanted to kick them tires you know and and the in the transmission too but but see we we didn't know what we were doing so so we always had to take but see here was God that had already chosen us to be without spot wrinkle or blemish he had already chose us to be holy and Without Blame before him in love and he done that before anything happened and so then if he had done that then he's already got a he's already prepared a way to make us into this this place ain't that right and and this is why the scripture is so uh important and and yet so very well known is John 3:16 for God so loved the world right God so loved so this preparation came from his love it it wasn't just something I well I guess I'd better do it because I've already done this no no it it was a love amen and so the prophet said when his love was projected to the world Grace stepped in and produced a savior see that's the only way that could have re produced a a kinsman redeemer it wasn't that that he had to do it it was his love that done it amen and he said see God wanted to see you well so much and I I want you to see that God wants to see you well so much amen God wants to see you saved so much God God wants you to make it to heaven so much God wants you to to be restored back into Fellowship so much amen it's his love see his love went out and it produced an atonement for your sickness as well as your sins amen it was the love of God that constrained him to do it can you say Amen so God would now become our kinsman redeemer because there was nothing else that could amen and there was no man no matter how righteous they were no matter how good will and determined or whatever amen there's no man that could have done it so God would create himself amen be himself our kinsman redeemer so as we talked about it the Holy Ghost the brother Braham said overshadowed Mary amen and created a blood cell woman did not have anything to do with this amen uh uh uh and and and man had nothing to do with it and and so then it was a created blood cell in the womb of that woman of and and as as the prophet told us that Mary really wasn't even the mother of Jesus Amen she was just the incubator amen for God God just borrowed her womb amen so he could become the kinsman redeemer a ain't that right and so through that blood cell came our kinsman redeemer now notice Hebrews 9 and 24 amen break it in Christ is not entered into the holy places with made with hands amen which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear appear in the presence of God for us see not nor yet that he should offer sin uh offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others see uh uh uh for then he must for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself aren't you glad for that amen we're part of that see now Acts 20 and 28 take heed unto yourselves andto all the flock over the the the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which Heath purchased with his own blood there there's so many scriptures here that that that apply and and to speak of it not just with blood you he didn't purchase you with blood he purchased you with this own blood and you say Amen to let it know let you know that he could be our kinsman redeemer he could be our lamb he but yet not the the blood of an animal amen a natural animal he could be our a kinsman redeemer a man and yet not have the the the the the sexual blood as you and I it's his own blood his own blood Lord amen Hebrews 13:12 wherefore Jesus also that he might might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate ain't that right Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us washed us from our sins in his own blood thank God we had a prophet to let us know what that really meant it loosed us from our sins aren't you glad for that so now God is giv us uh something that we could that is stable that something something that is concrete something that is perfect that we could rest our faith upon amen and no matter what comes and no matter what goes we can maintain our profession of Faith ain't that right amen Hebrews 911 Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained everybody say he obtained Eternal Redemption something that had never been done before something that couldn't even been spoken of under the law amen because who who could really grasp that amen but now under the shed blood Amen on this other side there's the Revelation that this was the lamb this was that perfect sacrifice this was the perfect kinsman redeemer and now we have eternal Redemption Eternal Redemption all fear of being lost is gone all fear of going to hell is gone all fear of being left behind and going into tribulation is gone all fear of sin and sickness and sorrow is gone because we have been obtained Eternal Redemption can you say man by his own blood by his own blood God was able to create a blood amen didn't need us didn't need woman didn't need anything he created his own blood Amen to bring us an eternal Redemption amen for if the blood of bulls and goats and uh the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the P purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament see amen that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance so as as the prophet said his blood his blood is the only thing that will make atonement and he says it was a power of God that was made blood amen the power of God that was made blood that he might take away your sinful Blood by sexual desire and make you a free man and woman of God how many believes you're free amen you're free not just tonight but tomorrow and and not just tomorrow but the next day and the next day you're free forever it's an eternal Redemption and you sayen see think of that he might take take away your sinful Blood by sexual desire take away that to where amen see so he's able to to to obtain Eternal Redemption now so brother brandom says see since it is the blood of God not the blood of animal not the blood of a human but it's the blood of God then it is perfect blood and if it's perfect blood that is loosening us then from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete perfect and complete perfect and complete can you say Amen you can't have faith when you're worrying amen God wants us to get past the worrying well I just don't know what's going to happen to me quit worrying about it there's a perfect blood oh God Amen and so this this perfect blood brought forth a perfect loosening right yes divorce the sin from us now notice Psalms 103:12 as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from usen it not not not not just leave you take you know separate you from your sin and then your sin is just right next to you that's all baggage following you around but he's so separated your sin that there's no end to it I mean he's taken it as far as the East is to the West aren't you glad for that so then Romans 3:24 being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood Amen to declare his right righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God see so we've Now by his own blood have been Justified freely by not a carnal commandment but by Grace prise the Lord ain't that right and we the prophet would let us know what Justified is as though you never done it in the first place that's exactly what Justified means you never did it in the first place God provided a remedy Hallelujah to destroy the sin amen praise the Lord amen see the prophet said his death gave us the blood now there's nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we're free we are Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word amen you are loosed by the blood yes amen amen and through the blood God's able to bring forth a perfect channel on Earth today that he could work his purpose through Hallelujah can you say Amen so you say well what about the mistakes what what about all these things surely God's angry surely that God can't have anything to do with me you know who are you who am I well we have the prophet has told us over and over and over you're the Bride of Jesus Christ am so much that he called us miss Jesus Christ in this day he preached the message the invisible Union of the Bride amen you are the bride of Christ and you're that by predestination amen you believe that so then everyone who is part of the bride of Christ has had their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world they are the predestinated ones and and and if you are predestinated to be in that bride then here's the thing you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world Amen I believe now to me that that is significant because we were in him see the prophet said see he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that God seen before the foundation world and put their names in the Lamb's Book of Life see so God showed in the beginning of creation that woman is part of man she was in man God didn't make her apart from man he put her in man amen praise the Lord and at the due time he took her out of man ain't that right see so so then then it shows that that when Jesus he came to redeem his bride he come to redeem all that were in him ain't that right so he didn't do this half-heartedly he knew exactly what he was doing he he went to Calvary with purpose he he didn't say well I'm going to go to Calvary hoping that someone will accept what I've done no no no no that's what the world paints today as a pitiful Christ that is begging for people to come but he's the one that said all that the father hath given me shall come I've not lost the one they're going to come and and he held to that that that profession of Faith him going to Calvary knowing that he was going with a a people in mind yes sir yes sir ain't that right prise see so so he come to redeem that bride and that bride was in him we were in him ain't that right see so the prophet said see in God's Own thinking God the great spirit in the beginning before there was the beginning he was God and did you know that you were in him then see if you're a Christian now you was in him then see then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Christ see then when Christ died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then amen see for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later ain't that right see so we was at Calvary with him we went in the grave with him we raised with him in his resurrection ain't that right and now we've ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grac amise isn't that what Paul said come to the throne of grace boldly well how do you get there you've ascended up there yes sir amen sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen see he says for as The Germ of natural life is brought down gerti from father to father to father to father so is the Life of Christ gerti that's the reason God uses Elijah's Spirit five different times what is it it's the handing down see just as your natural life life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world ain't that right see so here you were in him but now you had to keep on coming come come come come and here you are tonight ain't that right see so he says when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there aren't you glad for that in him there I paid for my sins there's nothing to pay for anymore oh godall you don't have to beat yourself up anymore amen if you were chosen in him it was there that you paid for your sins right how can you be a sinner today then amen you you paid for it it's done it's a finished work Lord ain't that right so then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil do you understand that did it get really to you you're sitting brother Bill in Heavenly places with power over every devil name the devil just name him what little wimp or imp of the devil is bothering you right well if you're seated in Heavenly places this isn't just something a message a quote or brother B just trying to tickle our fancy this is reality to the bride of Christ amen can you say Amen see now he says see we are now seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given you that's right see but if you're not seated there then you don't have it but if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but no then notice what he says but if you are seated there you will use it for you're ordained to do what you do you realize that God ordained you to defeat the Devil he finally found a channel that he could perfectly work through he was been able to trip up every all the prophets all the sages of old and all these things amen he's been able to trip them up but now there is a bride on this Earth that God has been able to perfect you will overcome you will praise God that's right you say Amen so then the prophet says this he said do you realize that when MDC appeared to Abraham and talking to him and he told him that you're going to have a son through Sarah and she laughs in the tent she laughed at God and the prophet said God would have killed her right then but he couldn't do it because it would have hurt Abraham she was part of Abraham now God you see through all these types and shadows God letting know you know how secure you are right he couldn't touch her because of Abraham now she was only part of a natural man ain't that right but notice he says see that's the reason our sins today we would every one of us be condemned but God can't take us can you say that with me God can't take us because if he does he hurts Christ see we're part of him we're the bride don't you see it so there it is so Grace everybody say grace holds us in our mistakes until we can see better amen Grace holds us in our mistakes cuz he knows we're going to come to it can you say amen amen so he says we are perfected with our sacrifice he makes no mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if you wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your motives he knows what you are there's traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble and you say I didn't mean to do that God see you you know it see what you're still perfect you good think about it you're still perfect this this is what he's done with his own blood amen for you thank you you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day that's right by who our great high priest amen and a bleeding sacrifice hanging Before the Throne of God Almighty another place he says the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that shows that the blood of Christ atones for you because his life is in you and he's not just in in in human blood sexual blood he's in his own blood you've got the his blood flowing through your veins and his life just like a human life couldn't flow through animal blood sir ain't that right so God's blood is in us and the spirit Bears record that we have his blood atoning for for us so the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood amen that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptized us into his body that that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation and she knows it so did Eve know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall amen she's ordained amen hallelujah she is ordained not to fall she won't fail she is predestinated to it and blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin amen aren't you glad for that Daniel 11:32 breaking in but he says the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits I like what brother brandham he's he's preaching in that Hebrew series and he said it's just not knowing god but it's knowing god in his perfection knowing god in his Perfection see the the the wicked will not know the god of Heaven see the prophet said they know him in a form and in a ritual but they don't know him by the way of perfection but here we've been allowed we've been blessed by the grace of God to know him in his Perfection by his Perfection amen oh do you love him amen that's good so he says see God can do nothing else but work through Perfection he can't stain himself in any way am you think of that God living in you has already made a way so he wouldn't stain himself God coming in you is a testimony testifying is proof that he has come up with something that it will not hurt him he's holy amen he's un he's undefiled he can't change and then he comes into US mortal beings because he found a way that it wouldn't blemish him at all amen praise the Lord and he says that's why Jesus came to take away our sins that we might be perfected that God could work through his church there is is where the secret lays amen if the musician will come prise the Lord Hebrews 12:2 it says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and and sat down at the right hand of God the right hand of the Throne of God so then we must not look to anything else but him don't look to yourself don't don't look to the preacher don't don't look to and and I say don't even look to a prophet looking un Jesus amen the author and the finisher of our faith anything else is going to fail he is your accepted sacrifice you believe that amen he's the one who met God's requirement for sin he's the one that paid it he's the one amen he's the only one that appeases God's Wrath now brother Brandon talks about the law of redemption and what it really means he said under the Old Law of redemption he said let's just say a mother horse has given birth to a colt and that cold he's a mule and his ears are hanging down his knees are knocked together his eyes are crossed what a mu now that little fella if he could think and he'd say wow look look look what I am I won't even be able to live I mean that poor little fell he's just so messed upk Lord he says well when the man of the house the owner when he comes out and he sees me why he's going to knock me in the head he'll never feed me he won't care for me you know now if the old mother was instructed right by the laws of God she would say now wait a minute honey you know what the high priest will never see [Music] you he will never see you but you're born with a birth Birthright you're my cult and you're my first one you have a Birthright right now what if the man comes out and sees him oh there's a horrible looking mule now what happens he has to go get a lamb a perfect lamb L without blemish he has to take it down to the high priest and the Lamb's throat is cut the lamb died so the mule can live why it was born with the birthright they never examine the mule they examine the lamb the priest ain't looking at the mule for Perfection he's looking for perfection in the L so he don't care about the mule he's not there to examine the mule he's there to look at the lamb right now the prophet said see you Bible readers know that that is under the laws of redemption in the New Testament no matter what's wrong with you don't look at yourself look at your lamb then he ask the question can you find fault with him can you find fault with the lamb can can you find fault with the work of Calvary can you find fault with his presence here tonight his manifestation of today Among Us he says God don't look at you he looks at the lamb so if there's no fault in the lamb there's no fault with you can you say Amen there's no fault with the lamb then there's no fault with you so then half Faith he says have faith amen rise up and claim your god-given privilege no matter what it looks like how feel how sick you feel how advanced how far Advanced your faith is you can be healed you can receive whatever you have need of if you just look at your lamb amen don't find fault with the [Music] lamb don't be dissatisfied with your lamb you imagine that worshipper having to bring the lamb to the high priest for it for the for that that worship for that high priest to make intercession for him and he had to be identified that worshipper had to be identified with the lamb he had to lay his hands upon that head of that lamb while the the priest is cutting that throat the blood squirting all over that worshipper the worshipper had to be identified with his lamb but he brings the lamb up there and then he says you know what I don't think I need that lamb I don't want that lamb let's go look for something else there could be no intercession done ain't that right the lamb was there for him amen and if he if he could bring that lamb before that high priest and say I know it's right and the high Prest priest examine that lamb and say yep you're right it's right then he can make the intercession and that worshipper could be free he could lift his hands unto God and have fellowship with God but how much greater when God is already proven that he's accepted that sacrifice he's already said it's done it's over it's finished what do you say about that lamb I say he's perfect amen then hold fast your profession of faith without wavering can you say Amen you love him am praise the Lord what song what sins what sins there are far away as the East is from the West oh what sin what sin was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea a forgetfulness we can try the first verse oh it happened so long ago I cried out for Mercy back then I pleed the blood of Jesus begged him to forgive my sin but I still can't forget it it just won't go away so I wept again I said Lord wash my sin this is all he would say what sin tell me what sin is as far away as the easy is from the West oh what sin what sin it was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea of forgetfulness see the heaviest thing you'll carry is a load of guilt and shame but you are never meant to Bear them so let them go in Jesus name our God is slow to anger quick to forgive our sins so let him put them under the blood don't bring them up again cuz he's going to say oh what sin tell me what sin they're gone as the East is from the West oh what sin what sin you've gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea of forgetfulness can we sing that again tell me what sin what sin they're as far away as the East is from the West oh what sin what sin they were gone the very minute you confess where they at the buried be the knes see of God's forgetfulness can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord aren't you glad for him our sacrifice our great high [Music] priest the high priest that is the word that is the discerner of every thought and intent of the heart he discerns and yet through the discern in he can't find one sin against you it'd be something if it was just a priest of a man or some preacher mom or dad or whatever telling you well youve there ain't no sin but when God himself is telling us what sin are you talking about I thought of that little lady uh uh the interview sister Bruce and here she was trying to tell her Prophet how bad she was and how unworthy she was and what a wretched sinner she was and on and on and the prophet said but but I've searched your life there ain't nothing there what was it it was the word of God searching that woman's life and and yet she the devil was telling her that she was The Sinner the devil was telling her bringing up all of her past failures but God was saying through that Prophet there is no sin if we could understand that tonight that the blood of Calvary has so washed us clean that there is no sin you can't bring it up to God [Music] anymore Hallelujah cast not away your confidence hold fast to profession of your faith amen do you love him hallelujah hallelujah there's that little song I know it was the blood I I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for [Applause] me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was the blood sing it now I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross yeah I know it was the blood once again I know it was the blood I know I know I know for me one day when I was lost he died upon that cross I know it was the blood for me sing the last lines oh I when one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me well we certainly love the Lord you love him amen amen may we always look to him amen our perfect sacrifice amen for that's the only way we're getting out of here you know amen and I believe that he's revealed himself in this day and I have found no fault in him I found no fault and I'm love him very much God bless you remember service that at uh 11 Sunday and um good to have Britney and back with us amen and glad she's doing better we want to keep little Wyatt in our
