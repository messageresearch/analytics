we're thankful for that amen before we go into the word let us just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we come to a sacred time Lord realizing the importance of your word and Lord it takes you to to open the scriptures up to us and I'm praying father that you would do so this morning Lord don't let it just be a man a bit Lord help me just to get myself out of the way and that you could speak Divine words to his father and Lord whatever is lacking within his father I pray Lord that you would do a creative work Lord no doubt there are many battles and and things that your people are going through and Satan fighting on every hand but I pray that you silence the enemy Lord and build Faith within our hearts today Father may we be ever fervent about this message and about our personal walk with you father and ever determined not to look back we pray father and Lord we just now just ask you to come in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord the book of Hosea the 12th chapter and the the 10th verse but it says I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets amen you can have your seats this morning I believe that we're we're living in the closing hour of time and we can't put enough emphasis on that of just really it's been preached about and said so many times throughout the ages but we Are Witnesses of the reality of it just by the scriptures unfolding and prophecy being fulfilled and it would have ever thought that we'd be living in an America the way it is today and the challenges that we have and uh seeing things that we're seeing and it it truly is uh the end of time and as the prophet would tell us it's the greatest time for it's the blending of Time and Eternity and we we believe that the the changing of the body is imminent to the believer it's uh uh the catching away the Millennium the the marriage supper of the Lamb is soon at hand all of these things that that the Saints of old have have longed to see and and um but but as we look at it at not all all of these things aren't just going to happen to people randomly um uh is it's not going to be that way and and people aren't just being picked randomly for these uh events and things like that uh but we know that this is the time of preparation this is the uh we're preparing for it we're not just waiting we're preparing every service every day we're preparing and and um so brother Branham would tell us in several here quotes but uh so I'm just going to read them but he says before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have rapturing faith uh says now God's just now loosening up the church everywhere getting in order so now now so he can get it into get into the Rapture got to give it rapturing Faith before it can go in the Rapture I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got right now wouldn't be a we wouldn't be able to do it now you know he's talking years down back so so we we can't apply that today because we do have what it takes uh for Rapture and Faith amen another one they're Mysteries amen talking of the seven Thunders they're Mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when they do uh it'll give faith for that Rapture and Grace for that church to move out in the church age book what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know everybody say we need to know it's important that God would give it to us because we needed to know I mean I mean we're at the end of time and and we needed a way of Escape we needed to get out of here we need to and what we had back then what the church had that it wasn't ready for it it couldn't Luther couldn't bring the church into a rapturing uh uh Wesley or even the Pentecost could not bring it into a Rapture uh so what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know and it will take not a reformer but he says it will take a profit to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet the word always came by prophet and always will and that is uh that this is the law of God is evident by even a casual search of scripture the changing god with unchanging ways invariably sent his prophet in every age where people had strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word God always sent his servant to these people but apart from theologians in order to correct false teaching and lead the people back to God another place now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be by these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers amen and and and brother Branham called it seven thunders of Revelation and then he said may he show may he God show the bride how to prepare for the great translation faith now church this is what's happening today by the message of the hour it is showing you and I how to prepare for this translation because we realize that it's not just going to randomly happen to us it's not just going to one day just all of a sudden it clicks and we go it's it's not that it's it's the message of the hour and church we've had this message for 60 years or so or close to it of uh I don't know how how long it's been close to that since that and since the prophets left the scene but uh um so we've had this message and I I'll be honest most people have fought with it they have debated it they have put their own opinions to it they have allowed things to come in with it and and and all of these things and and and which that is Satan's way of doing it but this message is pure it is right it is perfect you have received a perfect word in this day no matter what men do with it and what they say about it and and all of these things you've got your your extremes this way extremes that way you you got one you know we don't need don't need a Ministry and just stay with the prophet just stay and play tapes then you got one that is so far-fetched out this way that they're adding to and they become the final that they become the voice of what brother Branham has said then and all of these things and and uh uh but in all of the confusion and all of the fussing and the fighting and the feuding and all of this there is a bride being prepared because all the the the the the weirdos that are taking this message and taking it to extremes and all of these things and I'm I I say weirdos I don't know what else to call them but uh uh the extremists that are taking this pure message and bringing it into extremes time ain't stopping for them time is not stopping people may be getting confused but this elect is not being confused she's staying right with the message of the hour can you say Amen yes we've we've had all kinds of crazy things in Ministry to where people say well I don't believe in Ministry we're just going to stay and play tapes and and it does not matter what they think God's word Still Remains the Same if there's a fake there's a there's a real if if there's a one that is all messed up there's someone that has stand balanced with the word of God Amen and so uh uh but but it's it's preparing and this is what's happening today now the prophet will go on in another place we found out what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that the Thunder everybody say the Thunder was the voice of God they have made Thunders a mystery these days and all that but it's really simple the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened amen and so uh uh the the Thunders isn't something that is different from what's already written in the Bible uh any Revelation that that a true prophet of God will get has to come from the Bible ain't that right now it's open to us because an intellectual mind cannot understand this Bible I I challenge you go read this Bible you know and and and get one of these boys to read this Bible every day of their life till they're a thousand years old and they'll still not understand this without a prophet it just ain't gonna happen and yet it's laying there it's it's it's there amen see so uh uh we we find that uh uh uh uh the the voice of God is is the thunder is the voice of God now brother Branham said this all this idea of interceding with Jude for politics and interceding with Saint Cecilia for something else excuse me that's nonsense I don't say them people are not honest and sincere and there are a lot of honest and since their people still going to church you know and and he says but I don't say you're not sincere in doing it if you do but you're wrong you're sincerely wrong that's right they say well this Angel this appeared to Saint Boniface and said this and that and the other and they they can say this I don't doubt that a bit in my mind but what somebody saw the vision I don't doubt what Joseph Smith saw the vision but it wasn't according to the rest of the word I don't doubt that Kenneth Hagin didn't see a big old angel uh and he describes that he saw this big old angel and it was so many feet high and da da da da I don't doubt that I ain't going to argue with that but it's not against it's not according to the word it has to come with the rest of the word can you say amen that's right he said so therefore it's wrong see it's wrong to me he said that's the way the church ages and see and all the rest of it and when anybody thinks that he has those seven Thunders if it does not compare with the rest of the word there's something wrong here it's got to come thus said the Lord for this is the book this is the revelation of Jesus Christ in its entirety so what you need for rapturing Faith lay is right here in this Bible it just took a prophet to divinely open this the mysteries of this Bible up ain't that right so we can truly say that the Divine that the seven Thunders are revealed and this is an open book to us ain't that right not reading from a closed mind but God has opened the enlightened the eyes of our understanding which Paul that's what Paul prayed that the eyes of our understanding would be enlightened that we may know what is the hope of his calling amen and so uh uh he said see someone has been many has been saying to me and theologians said brother Branham if the Lord God said you see with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbling saying this and said you you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your your word if God has manifested and I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me and I said but you see I couldn't do that see he said well why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away he said well them seven Thunders you see uh wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out uh won't that be a revelation to be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was ain't that right that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word you won't leave the word and God's spirit will never never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and opening the eyes of others it'll always do it ain't that right think of that the gospel blind some the opening of the word will blind some and Open the Eyes of others but that's the that's the way it is so the seven Thunders were reveal field in the opening of the seals and and that is what prepares the church for a rapturing faith and and for a Rapture ain't that right so now when the seventh angel was sounded the Bible says the Mysteries were finished finished we don't need him to come back and finish some mystery it's finished ain't that right it's done it's revealed and so brother Branham he would go on and say the book is absolutely a sealed book until the Seven Seals is broken it is sealed up with Seven Seals the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel so we are presuming I'm just reading a bunch of quotes we are presuming but the genuine everybody say the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding and Vindicated truth ain't that right a man sees so I I say it this way you cannot read this Bible with an intellectual mind you cannot just sit there brother Brown said you cannot read the Bible like you would a newspaper or a magazine or whatever amen and and and you could read a a book and and and it gives you all the details and all that you cannot read this that way it you have to be in the spirit of it it it's between the lines everything you're what you're reading is great but you need inspiration to put it all together to make it one beautiful picture ain't that right amen that's right and this is why we we got to not get in the spirit of the world but get in the spirit of God it's time to get in the spirit of God Spirit of Revelation not trying to make you know uh uh uh to make something big out of something that's not it at all it is so simple that even the smart will override uh or I will not see it see but though the elect will ain't that right but now the Revelation is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book and the Lambs got to take the book it's his it's his book this word is his ain't that right it's his mind that that was written it it's it's his word so he says now no matter no man in heaven no man in earth Bishop Pope cardinal state presbyter or whatever he is can break them sealed uh uh or reveal the book but the lamb we have probed and presumed and stumbled and wondered that's the reason we're all in such a confusion but with the Divine promise that this book of redemption will be perfectly opened by the lamb and the seals thereof will be loosed by the lamb in the last days in which we are living now ain't that right so so then the seven Thunders hold the secret to rapturing Faith I'll set this way the message of the hour is the secret to rapturing Faith don't you don't have to go get all these translations you don't have to get all this literature you don't have to go to conferences and Bible schools and all of that just play the tapes amen come to church and hear the message of the hour being preached and don't come with the critical heart don't come with some uh backslidden heart in a vax living condition your mind wandering everywhere's come prepared to hear and receive from God can you say amen that's exactly right see and so uh it took the ministry of a prophet to reveal them uh so again the ministry is the agency uh uh uh in which a purpose is fulfilled and a minister is part of the ministry for he is the agent that God uses I I thought of First Corinthians 9 17 the Apostle Paul which was also a a prophet uh first Angel messenger he said this a dis dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me to think of that God would commit such a important part of his mind and Revelation a man to give it unto a man and then that man must be true that man must be faithful that man must not he must not waver he must oh he go he went through trials did not Paul go through them amen he was stoned three times and left for dead and he was beaten he was Shackled he was Shipwrecked he he went through all kinds of stuff and yet God committed the gospel unto him amen and such was the the responsibility that Paul had that brother Branham would come in the final age the the most important of all times and he'd say I preached what Paul preached and the people said were resting on it we're resting on it can you say amen amen see so uh uh uh in another place Paul would say the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me amen First Timothy 1 11 according to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God which was committed to my trust and I think Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me in into the ministry now we're talking a Ministry of prophets but later on we're going to get to us a Ministry a man but he counted me faithful everybody say he counted me faithful he counted me faithful now think of that putting me into the ministry a man second Corinthians 5 20. then now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God this beseech You by us God talking through us to you and beseeching you through us or by us we pray you in Christ that be ye reconciled to God see so so it's a Ministry now the world is trying to get its program over uh uh look at the laws that are being passed um Democrats and Republicans alike are trying to get their agenda uh over to the to the people and get it in working order and and these things and we know good and well someone's behind the scenes someone's doing things that that maybe we don't know uh of course we say God again it is you know but but at the same time there's human uh uh behind this there is no way Biden God in I'm just going to be honest I'm I'm I'm a big doubter on that one there is no way that Biden God in sitting in the basement and and all of these things someone got him in someone and we can say well it was the will of God but I'm talking about men someone was behind the scenes because they've got an agenda that they're trying to push they're trying to push they're trying to close out uh Christianity they're trying to close us up they're trying to shut us up they're trying to do away with America as as a Sovereign Nation and it blows my mind but they're they're doing it and and we're seeing the laws pass left and right left and right left and right amen and so uh uh so so they're they're they're they're they're trying to get World Order and and on all these things and whoever's involved in it they're pushing their agenda trying to get it out Democrats and Republicans fighting and all these things well then there's the churches that are trying to get their agenda over in and and and and and and things and denominations and and and and and things and and and and and then then on top of all this Satan is trying to get his agenda over which we know most of the churches are just his pawns and and and he's he he's the god of the world and and and the kingdoms of these this world is his and and all of that and and so he is trying very hard to get his agenda over uh um and and and and and I say this he's succeeding he he is succeeding uh uh in this world and and in his agenda uh uh and said you know brother Brown said brother the lids come off of hell and streams of demon powers pouring from everywhere it's conquered the Nations it's conquered politics till it's rotten to the core it's conquered the churches till they know nothing but denomination ain't that right we look and demonic spirits have invaded uh uh the churches as much as they have invaded Hollywood and and the The Honky Tonks and politics and everything else amen and and we know that demons afflict in in the Physical Realm of the the Flesh and and uh they they torment and the diseases and all these things but then the prophet enlightened our eyes and he says they also uh in afflict and and in in the spiritual realm as well in that Spirit realm he said Satan now I want you to listen now because because I am getting somewhere but but Satan in the spirit gives unclean habits see and so forth and unbelief you might live just as pure and holy and clean and yet be a sinner it's your faith that saves you many people they're just as pure and clean and yet a lot of a lot cleaner sometimes than people who profess uh Christian lives but yet would deny the Holy Ghost and would deny the every operation of the power of God they're unbelievers no matter and yet very religious see and the Antichrist spirit is a very religious spirit just to the Mark just as religious as it can be it's the Antichrist Jesus even said it would deceive the very elect if possible in that last day in the last day that's true so he says then it behooves us it behooves you to know where your uh uh where you're doing what you're doing where you're standing and what you're talking to ain't that right so so Satan tried very hard to get his agenda demons come on on so-called Christians brother brand I'm talking about so-called Christians not not Holy Ghost Field Christians but he said now remember those ministers down there and that that was them prophets they were prophets they were religious men offering a sacrifice they were just as religious as the teachers of this day but brother they was a long ways from knowing the truth see don't you see how religious the devil is the devil's not an anti no anti-great-big thing like communism all against Christianity that's not see that's that's just uh he said see that that's just the devil but it's not the Antichrist he said that's just all the of the devil but that's not Antichrist the Antichrist is very religious very religious he repeats it was a religious spirit that crucified Christ it's always been a religious World a religious people that crucify defies it's the religious people that was against the true Christ it was the religious prophets that was against uh uh the true prophet mataya it's the religious people of the day that's against the message of God ain't that right see so so another place uh notice what Jesus said to the religious people in Matthew 23 and 27 he says woe to you uh uh scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like undewighted septicers and which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and all of all uncleanness even so you are you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the skep scepters of the righteous and say if we had been in the Days of Our Father we would have not been partakers with him the blood of the prophets wherefore you be Witnesses unto yourself that you are the children of them which kill the prophets he said see fill ye up then and the measure of your fathers you serpents and you Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of Hell wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify and some of them you shall Scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from City to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of zechariah's son of uh barakas or something like that uh whom you slew between the temple and the altar verily I say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation now notice all Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets and stone is them which are sin unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hymn gathereth her chickens under her wings and you would not watch now it's interesting to me that these religious people are Church going uh people and and yet he the manifested word if I say the manifested word for that's exactly what he was he was the Fulfillment of Prophecy he was the manifested word and he could not gather them religious Church going I mean uh piety and and and you couldn't point a finger to them in in only Jesus in that day could point a finger to them because he could discern the very heart of them amen but just the your average person they just looks like oh man he's holy he's wild I mean look at that guy if anyone's going to heaven he's going to heaven you know but here come the manifested word and he tried to gather them unto himself and they would not gather okay ain't that right amen and so uh he could not gather them uh see they were anointed uh uh uh uh religious Church going but they were and they were were anointed for John 11 51 talks of how that Caiaphas the high priest prophesied and his prophecy was true ain't that right but he was the one he was one of them that crucified the word Christ ain't that right so so then we look at catfish but then you find there was another more treacherous than even him and that was Judas that walk with the message of the word and and of the hour and the manifested and he he took part in the healing of the sick he was the one that one of them that Jesus gave power to to cast out devils and to do this and to do that but when it come to the word he crucified it he betrayed it yes and so he he walked and talked and had Association a man with the message of the hour and yet he betrayed Jesus Christ see they fulfilled what they were supposed to do amen and and Jesus no matter how much of anointing he had no matter how much of power that he had and Authority that he had I mean look at the authority they asked him one time well what what with what Authority do you do these things you understand he had that Authority and yet he could not gather a man that religious uh bunch of people amen see but the word of that day couldn't gather them amen and so again Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and shall Source great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elected ain't that right now we we we wouldn't know a lot of this I I remember hearing brother Perry in Green in his testimony of how that these things just stumped them even hearing uh brother biscoll and and coming out of the Pentecostal and things and they were stumped of how that people could prophesy and speak in tongues and see dreams and shout and all of these things and and yet live like you know uh Live Well Hypocrites and things like that you know and and it stumped them and and and then brother Brandon preached that anointed ones at the end time and and man it see you know it saddled their heart they said and and things and and here we're privileged to know these things amen well Christ means anointed ain't that right and notice what brother Brown said they're anointed anointed and uh but yet falsely anointed to the word falsely anointed to do the word they're denominational anointed but not to the word ain't that right so Jesus said that there will come false anointed ones and and brother Brown said well you'll ask them well are you Jesus and they said I ain't no way you know I'm almost an insult I ain't Jesus you know and he says they wouldn't stand for that but when it comes to an Old Glory I got there mourning and it's a genuine anointing he said remember campus had it too and prophesied so did Balaam have it and prophesied but that don't have nothing to do with this inside can you say Amen unless that was God's seed talking about the inside his Gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished you can prophesy dreams dreams run all over the place and shout and scream and cry and but if there's not a predestinated seed you're finished ain't that right see so God could gather that that little woman at the well he could gather her to him Jesus in his ministry could gather her and yet she was ill-famed she was uh no good she was a prostitute and yet she had something that he could gather a man and draw her with the priest he was holy not blunt without blemish no one could put a finger and yet the prophet says he was had no representation he had no Eternal representation and so Jesus could not Jesus the message that Jesus brought the life that Jesus brought was not a magnet Amen to that that priest but it was a magnet to that Samaritan woman can you say amen amen see and so uh uh there therefore it's it's not religious it's not anointing it's it's it you know good and well uh anointing is part of the Christian Life and and these things and we'll get into it more later on but uh uh but but notice what he says here he said that has nothing to do with it a cargo bird can count just as much as any the rest of them I've seen heathens raise and shout and speak in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil any of them Sensations and things forget it amen can you say Amen now was brother Branham trying to bring us all to dead as without Sensations that's nonsense so you got that other side that says oh it's just formal receive the Holy Ghost without sensation you know everybody just uh you know and and and and half a uh well I say all of them don't have an experience with God Amen brother Branham never did take the spirit of God away from us amen uh uh thinking of uh brother Mike Seaver he says every time that he went to the Tabernacle when brother Brown come unannounced he said brother Brown I always I mean he was he was Loose as a Goose just felt at home dancing shouting with the rest of them amen uh because he felt at home amen with just the locals amen you saw the picture how how did he get on that plaque how did he get on the setting on that Pulpit there amen with his hands lifted up amen he was in the spirit amen but you get in the spirit these days and people criticize it and getting the shout and all that well that's you're just working them up I've been in Pentecost long enough to know that's not working them up we know how to work them up we want to work you up we'll work you up amen but I don't want any of that and and and and so but so brother Brown never took away amen the spirit of God from the church amen he never he never get us to former for formalism to where you can't say Amen you can't shout you can't stand and glorify God Amen you can't be free in the spirit if there's ever a time to be free it's in the house of God among Believers amen especially when the word is going forth amen but see uh uh but yet he he says them things have nothing to do with them are blessings ain't that right blessings he says but see uh uh he says see it's in it's your heart in that word everybody say it's my heart in that word and that's Christ bring in there and watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself for the age it's living in amen so talking about the the close deception and thing brother Brown said now just a cold formal starchy Church see and so forth a man-made theology that wouldn't the elect would never pay any attention to that see you know in in any of these denominations that that's not close amen see he says but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving one word out is all you have to do the promise of the age very great time Christians everywhere take heed to the hour We're living can you say Amen but yet if you notice it's in this time of deception the greatest deception ever that God is calling out a people for his name amen he's calling he chose to do it he could have done it in any age but he'd done it in this age in the most treacherous time the most deceiving age the age that Satan has perfected his Eden and yet he says I will call out a people for my name out of that amen or now he could have done it when it was in its infancy but that wouldn't have been a challenge but in the age where Satan and all of his Force and and where he is now taking the throne by by his own people and and he has brought such a deception that brother Brown said that the people thanking their worshiping God when they're all reality they're worshiping Satan because they go by Sensations instead of the word of God and and and their faith is in this and their faith is in a gift their faith is in in in some Doctrine their faith is in some Theologian and and all of these things and Satan is working through all of this amen and they think well just because I go to church and I've claimed Jesus and I love Jesus and all of that and and they don't realize that they're victims to the devil and it is true amen you tell them about God said on the problem they don't want to hear it amen you tell them about the Holy Ghost you need to be born again they don't want to hear it they got their own ideas and and and and these things see but but out of all of that God is calling a people for his name amen and so brother Brown says see it's a people that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married to him Amen to become part of him see by predestination see just as a man that chooses a right wife in life was ordained to be part of his body so that is the bride of Christ will be and is now from old ordained by God to be part of that body aren't you glad for that amen so how is he doing it how how how is this happening by a prophet for he chopped them out by his Prophets ain't that right chopped out his elect see His prophets had thus set the Lord because the word came to them and that word that came to them was a two-edged sword amen and he was a hack and then he was shaping that's what this Prophet every time he was preaching every time laying in that word you you didn't realize what he was doing the world rejected him and all these things but he was he was shaping out a bride cutting out a bride for his for for his name amen so by the word the prophets hewed out God's people you see the word only affects the bride it it only affects the bride amen now we can get discouraged we look at the majority and think well nothing's happening but don't get don't look at the majority amen don't look at what people are doing they're claiming to be in the message and what they're doing and living backsliding living worldly and can't make it to church half the time and and and and and can't you know you just you wonder about people you know and and and it's just almost like they they they they they they they're going on a trip and yet they they stop at the gas station just to get maybe you know five dollars worth just a little bit you know you gotta watch it you know uh uh because you know because the the the word about the the air and all that so let's just get a little bit you know and then they're going and then they uh I hope we can find a gasket well why don't you just fill the thing up you know you understand what I'm saying but people just live just barely enough barely enough and there's Victory here there is there there is so much to a Christian life amen there's an adoption of Sons there's an authority there that we could speak over the devil and watch him flee over our children over our lives over the church over everything but if we're just going to live just barely just making it barely you'll never overcome the world that way you'll never be the way God has called you to be let the Prophet let the message cut you out to be what God intended you to be [Applause] can you say man see the word only affects the elect and and how many wants the word to affect you amen I want the word to affect I I I mean if God would have spent take the time to send a prophet my way he would take the time to send a prophet and a prophet even wanted to go out in the woods he wanted to go up in the mountains and God showed him exactly what he would be if he ever done that and he saw himself as a bum you remember that why God so cared for this elect and he knew that that mouthful Prophet was the only way to cut out this Bride for his name he already said I'd have a bride for my name a people out of the Gentiles for my name and God already had a prophet in mind with the word of God to speak that word can you say amen and that prophet got discouraged but he never gave up God wouldn't let him give up because he had you in mind and therefore we ought to be sincere about this message we ought to give everything that we have to this message don't you lean this way and don't you lean that way and don't you follow that and follow this stay with the word of God let the word cut you out God wants a church to be powerful not weak foreign God wants a church standing on her feet and she is by the prophet's words by the message of the hour it's our day it's our time can you say Amen now notice Jesus being the word not just the word coming to him as as it did the prophets but Jesus was the word Jesus was the word that the prophet and yet could not could not chop out those religious people he wanted together as a priest but the man had no representation he wanted to he tried but the man got mad the man always trying to deceive him always trying to trip him up ain't that right so the prophet says he couldn't get that priest because the priest was an educated scholar a theologian in the word but had no representation in Heaven Wasn't in God's thinking at all ain't that right but notice II Timothy uh uh 2 and 16 but shun profane in vain bablens where they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat their word will eat at Duff a canker of whom is felitus and and so who concerning the truth have erred now go back Sean profane and vain Babylons for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word or by say their word will eat as a canker will eat and eat and eat watch what you hear watch what you listen to watch what you yield your heart to your mind to can you say man now amen see a man who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is all passed already and and they overthrow the faith of some nevertheless everybody say nevertheless the foundation of God stand assure their word that does that is deceptive that that eats as a canker and all that he'll never shake the the foundation of God it will never cause the foundation of God to crumble amen for the foundation of God standing sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his ain't that right now the age that we're living in is a laodicean age we all know it it's a lukewarm age buddy if there's ever a time of fighting it's now Revelations 3 15 God says I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou her cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth now brother Brown says in this lukewarmness it's a lukewarm age lukewarmness Demands a penalty from God it Demands a penalty from God and so God indicted this age and brought a sentence upon them and the penalty is that they are spewed out of God's mouth and notice the prophet said it's the church that is spewed out not not the individual ain't that right not not the individual it's it's the church that is is spewed out and so he says now we are not we are not in the mouth of God but rather we are engraved in the palm of his hands ain't that right see so and and carried in the bosom of God we are in his Sheepfold and in his pasture but never everybody say never in his mouth so what is in his mouth the word the word is in his mouth and and this is what Jesus said there in Matthew 4 4 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ain't that right so then notice what the prophet said the word is supposed to be in our mouth the word is supposed to be in our mouth what the word of God must live in our mouth now I think this is important because the church is his body do you believe that so we're his agency if anyone's going to speak it's the church true it's already prophesied that you're going to speak as the body of Christ for the spirit and the bride and then the prophet says and the prophet will be saying the same thing ain't that right so the word is supposed to be in our mouths and and so what is uh uh to be in the mouths of the church the word the word first Peter 4 and 11 says if any man speak let him speak as the oracles or the word of God a man see II Peter 1 21 for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but a holy man of God Spade as they were moved by the Holy Ghost ain't that right see so the church uh uh in this layout they've gotten away from the word they had gotten away and and brother Branham said they are no longer fervent about it and when we say the church we're talking of the church natural the carnal Church they got away from the word in other words they were no longer fervent about the word and they are lukewarm about it see uh uh and then he goes talks about like the Baptist they've got their Creed and dogmas based on the word of God and you cannot shake them from it see they have taught that the apostolic days of Miracles are over and that there is no baptism with the Holy Ghost subsequent to believing see so they they take their doctrines uh uh and they say it's based upon the word but when the truth comes they don't want the truth and and so therefore they become lukewarm about it the Methodist teach that there is no water baptism based upon the word now and that sanctification is the baptism of the Holy Ghost well we know now that that's not true it's it's not true you can be Sanctified and not even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see but but then there's the Church of Christ and they major in regenerational baptism and yet they go down into the water the prophet said Dry Sinners and come up wet Sinners amen and they claim that their Doctrine is is word based as well but then you've got the Pentecostals that they'll take the word and and they'll sell out to it uh for Sensations and and things and if you can produce a manifestation of of like oil and blood and tongues and other side signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it amen and we've seen that so many times and and someone have a dream and someone it doesn't matter if it was with the word they would just go with the dream and and they would go with this and they would go with that and they forfeited the word and they become lukewarm with the word can you say Amen so he says see the word has been put aside so then at the end of the ages God's spews them a man out to where they no longer if I say they no longer amen speak from God they they are speak for God Amen they no longer uh uh and and will say it this way the Baptists no longer speak for God Amen the charismatics no longer speak for God Amen the Pentecostals no longer speak for God God has spewed them out of his mouth do you believe that amen they know no longer and and here's the thing people say well they've got part truth it does not matter they no longer speak for God they no longer speak for God people get all these quotes and all these things from these writers and they get these all these books to learn how to be a better parent how to be a better you know a preacher and to be a better Church goer and be a better you know a wife or husband and all these things and you're taking something that God has spewed out of his mouth God spewed out of his mouth they have no right to the word can you say man therefore we're not required to listen to them we're not required to hang our soul in the words that they speak God is not requiring his elect to stay with them true it's been so much that he spewed them out and then he says come out of her my people come out why because you need rapturing faith in this age you're needing something to get you out of here ain't that right amen there's babbling it's confusion oh they're trying to bring this confusion in this message saying well brother Branham you can't trust brother Branham in this and you can't you don't know what he really was of God into this I say nonsense these Babylonians coming into this message trying to bring a spirit of confusion nonsense why would you want to take something if you you can't even have confidence in if God had so much confidence in this message you can too because it's the only way you're going out of a rat or getting in a rapture can you say man see so he's calling he's calling us out he's called us out you know and and so they're no longer the mouthpiece they have not the power can you say that with me they have not the power to bring the bride into what God wants them to be why because they have no longer a mouthpiece the word is no longer in their mouth Luther had the word in his mouth amen and he called and he left out amen Wesley had the word in his mouth and what little Revelation he had and he called that elect out amen now we're living in an age that the word full word has been restored you cannot look back to a Methodist stage and say well I'm going to live off that that is no longer a man he did not have what it took a man to cut that bride out like it is in this age I hope that's okay amen so what they the what they have I don't care if it's just a little truth whatever what they have will not bring the church into rapturing faith it will not now God says for out of Seven Ages I have seen nothing but men and steaming their own word above mine so at the end of this age I am spewing you out of my mouth it is all over I am going to speak all right yes I am here in the midst of the church the amen of God faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet amen thank you Revelations 10 7 we all know it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished why he had the word he had the word in his mouth you see why we believe in a prophet and why we stay with the prophet it doesn't matter good people I'm you know you were you were not trashing the people at all we're trashing the system we don't believe in the system you see if you're going to hang your soul on something God's got to give you something to hang it on amen because this this isn't this isn't a game this isn't just a myth God is coming what we're seeing today in politics and the world and and the things it it it is it should be a reality check to the church in world and around the world to see what's happening we are living in the days of lot we are living in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah we are living in the days of Noah we're living in these times return them and as God has always done it in them times he's always provided the way of Escape to get out of here God provided an art back in that day but in this day he's not providing an ark in in a literal Ark didn't you say man he's he's providing a body brother Brown said the body of Christ is the ark today and just as Noah in Noah's day just before the destruction God provided a prophet right Noah was the prophet and the Bible says Noah stood in the door of that art tell them the people come anybody come why he didn't stand at the end of the Ark he didn't stand away from the ark and say go go go go go I want to make sure there was no confusion I'm right here come he stood right there and you see this Prophet stood in the door everybody's got an idea of how to get in the body that a prophet of the age a prophet of the hour knew where the door was knew where the real power laid knew where the Dynamics Jesus says I am that door and these people that try to separate the message from Christ is nonsense they they they're telling you right then they don't know this message they don't understand whatever brother Branham that Prophet stood we were here we are in the days of Noah God has provided a body the ark you got to get in the ark you got to become part not a denomination not shake the preacher's hand you got to get in the body can you say amen and here is a prophet standing just like Noah did in that day in the literal amen since there was a prophet in this day standing at the door of Christ saying come come here's the entrance into the body can you say Amen don't you depend upon a sensation and say you're in the body don't you depend upon some gift and say you're in the body don't depend upon some Doctrine and say you're in the body don't say well I've got I'm in it I belong to a denomination I'm okay that's not it the prophet stood at the door of the Ark so that you and I don't have to be confused why because the prophet said he is the Dynamics to the mechanics can you say man when you'll know the people know they're in the ark when the dynamic strikes them because he is the door can you say Amen you love him so here brother Graham said there it is see he is sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education in the world of religion that as John the Baptist and Elijah Abode he will hear only from God aren't you glad for that and he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God so brother Brown taught an adoption a certain way stay with what brother Brown taught ain't that right if he taught things certain way stay with what he taught and ask God to give you the spirit of Revelation so your revelation will fit through the whole Bible that your Revelation won't take out scriptures can you say man that you can actually say Amen to it all [Music] a prophet never took away from the Bible he never lived apart from the Bible can you say man why he had thus saith the Lord he knew the mind of God he will hear only from God he never heard from theologians he never heard from traditionalism he never heard from anything he didn't care what people thought he didn't care what they believed he didn't care what they said he stayed right with the word for he will hear only from God and he will only have the Sith the Lord can you say man and he will speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers notice he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works it's the elect that he will be able together gather can you say Amen everyone else will be just like them Pharisees and the Sadducees it doesn't matter what God done to and showed the Vindicated message and the ministry of Jesus Christ he could not gather them but there was an elect he could gather and this message is gathering any Lacks everyone else will despise that everyone else will say proud of my brain of my brand of mine I don't care I'm glad to be a brand of mine because I see it's more than just a man it was God Amen with the ministry of a supernatural Supernatural speaker to that man together me for a rapture only through the Vindicated Prophet will he bring back the elect notice now is this okay what would God call a people out for this evil age for his name can you say that with me his name why is God sending a prophet why did he restore the word why did he do all these things that he'd done in this age to call out a people why for his name notice the reason it is is to try her his bride his bride is the most tried people on the face of the Earth today talking about demons brother Brown said it would have been easier just to be lived in that day and to be burned to a stake and get it over with to be whatever be a martyr and get it over with but it's not that way today it's a more treacherous hour demons just constantly battling fighting us he'll fight you in your sleep have you ever had that happen you're thinking oh if I could just go to sleep and get and get my problems over with and he's right there in your sleep wake up and he's right there in your bed putting thoughts in your mind allowing things to happen and you react maybe a different way that you you really wanted to or or something like that and and then you feel bad or or it's just constant constant constant battles constant Warfare but notice the reason is to try her his bride see notice when she and this is why the trying is going on when she is made manifest and been tried and been proven and proved to Satan why is the trials coming your way to prove to the devil it's not to prove to you that you're a Son of God you already know you're a son and daughter of God you've already got his seal within you amen even as Paul said his Spirit Within Me cries I'm a father ain't that right but it's to prove to the devil that you're not one of his little suckers you're not his Pawn you're not someone that can be so easily messed with ain't that right look what he's doing to the homes today look what he's doing to the children today look what he's what he saw today but there is a people he has no hands to he cannot touch them they can touch them physically he can touch him and send the problems and the trials all that way but that Soul has been forever sealed can you say man now notice thee look look now when she is made manifest been tried been proven proved to Satan like it was at the beginning in the Garden of Eden so shall it be in the end can you say man you see this bride is being tried like no other H I believe that I believe this Variety in this age the elect of this age she'd been called out how many's been called out aren't you glad you called out I am so glad to be called out but if we only knew that he was calling out to try us and to prove us and Buddy the trials go and the fire is hot but if you could only know that he's got a place prepared for you if you only knew that he already has the confidence in you that you will not fall you will not fail aren't you glad for that see so the more you surrender to the message the more you're going to be tried the more Revelation comes to you the more you're going to be tried get it down now don't be scared to try all right amen because God's already promised he will keep you through it the more you surrender and say God make your will known to me God give me this Revelation that's going to be tried to the uttermost now what what is God bringing us back to because he's going to gather us by a prophet he's Gathering us brother Brown said notice he says as a seed starts in the ground it comes up through carriers the life of it and ends up the same seat everybody say the same seed as it was when it was when in the ground see so the same way the seed of Deceit fell in the ground back in Eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel seed was when it fell into a denomination at nicer Rome so it ends up in a super organization today just as the seed of the church fell signs and wonders and a living Christ among soweth in under the ministry of Malachi 4. that's what he says amen aren't you glad for that got a Ministry that's bringing this to you you're the people that Satan don't know what to do with amen he says it is restored the Church is restored back again to the original faith that was once given so notice what brother Brown says now this evil age everybody say this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve God made his own garden and Satan come in and took that woman and she surrendered it out of God's Own Garden Satan had no power nothing nothing like today nothing that blows my mind so God says okay all I could do is let you make your garden so Satan today has come up with his own garden the most deceitful ever more deceitful than it was in the Garden of Eden in guard's Garden Satan had no power to do nothing to her all they done is just talk talk talk there was no influences there was no evil there was no sickness no nothing nothing no mind about nothing he just walked into God's Garden I mean and twisted the word just one little word and that was deception in his infancy but it's in this day that God has allowed him to do his own garden go ahead do your own garden and all the evil Powers is here every demonic spirit is around everything that Satan never wanted is here a lot more treacherous than it was in the Garden of Eden and God says out of this age I'll bring a bride out of his own age he is only eaten I'll call a bride out can you say amen that's exactly right this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve she is not that type of woman oh hallelujah hallelujah we're not that type of a person time to give Eve a ear to his Delights and his deception yes the Mind battles are there yes the darkness is there yes everything is present and we feel all these things are approaching all around us that we're not like that woman we will not fall we will not fall we will not fall aren't you glad for it yes sir he sent a prophet together us gather us Hallelujah and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact Again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every everybody say every word come and contact same enemy that he faced as we're facing today except he is now more treacherous than he has ever been he's got all the powers behind him he's able to do anything he wants to in this age because they're his kingdoms and look what he's doing there's a people that will not fall can you say Amen in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word to live by one word was misinterpreted by a man called Satan in a person of an animal called The Serpent Satan in this person could talk to Eve and misinterpret the word to her and the Word was lost in the middle of the Bible Jesus was tempted of Satan same guy that knows what he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word he tried it but he couldn't do it brother Brown said it has been promised that the God of this world would rise up in the last days and just to think of it after 1900 years of this gospel preaching the world system is more evil than it ever was when Christ was here on the Earth Abraham said the world system is more evil the world is heading to a great climax you know that the Lord is fulfilling his word on every hand the world is heading to a climax why the spirit of lawlessness moral Decay scientific religion has led it to the cage of every hateful and unclean birds as the Bible has said ain't that right and you can find that in there in Revelations 18 1-5 and brother Branham actually reads that and how Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird and and he just he goes on but then notice what he says that is laodicea he said that throws the church exactly back to Revelations 3 14 the laodicean age lawlessness but real religious real religious but Lawless can you say Amen the 17th verse they're uh Revelations 18 or 3 Revelations 3 I think 17 it says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked and so Revelations the 18th chapter ties perfectly with this age Abraham said not Daniel's age not Noah's age but this age amen Amen in this last evil Age and and we know as I get ready to close now the Natural Woman types the church and if you notice how the majority of women today are I guess we could say insufficiently dressed and foreign just going around you know uh hardly any clothes and things like that and but it's it's fitting for this evil age to show the condition of the church the natural Church brother Brown said did you know any woman that undresses herself like that is not in her right mind do you know she is whether she believes it or not or thinks not she is a prostitute though the woman might stand with her hand before God and swear that she's never been touched by any other man but her husband and that might be the honest truth but she still is a prostitute for Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already and you say man so what it is is the Bible says she's naked and don't know it ain't that right and and I want to just give you all you sisters and I I want to say I appreciate you sisters uh life and your willingness to not dress sexy and have a sex appeal and that you're living clean and holy because what you I know you know it but just to remind you and enforce what has already been told you through the years is that you're the type of the the bride as the Natural Woman is looking and going naked and and and you know skimpy and sexy and all these things she is actually don't know and she don't know it but she's actually typing out the carnal Church so are you sisters you're you're typing out a a bride of Christ that is staying clean to her husband and I want to tell you young people and and you girls don't you dress sexy don't try to get on these tight clothes short skirts it's wrong don't don't look at the world and think that's appealing if if you if you've got to get a guy like that if you got to get a guy by showing your body in every curve of your body something wrong with you and there's something wrong with the guy if a guy has to be drawn by sex appeal something wrong with him it should be your character it should be your your your inner person and any Christian girl and and you pardon me but any Christian girl is beautiful because her character is what makes her beautiful when she's staying true to God and she's living right before the Lord that's that's Beauty it's real Beauty natural beauty will fade but in all reality if if you have to dress sexy to get a guy you just wait tell the girl that's sexier than you comes along you'll only appreciate your body until he gets tired of it but he won't appreciate the inside the inward part of really what you are and I thank God and I think all of us husbands should be count ourselves so blessed to have women the way our wives I am so thankful for my wife I look at her just constantly thinking God you blessed me with such a wonderful woman such beauty and character and such beauty and solidness I can't I just can't thank God enough for her I thank God for my daughters that are trying to live true but sometimes I see that Satan tries to woo them that I want to tell you don't don't you let the devil woo you that way don't you let the devil think that you're you're you need to do something else because what you'll start doing is you'll start attracting things that shouldn't be even a part of your life stay true to God Stay True to this message can you say man you love the Lord amen now notice what the prophet said the spirit that's anointing her to do such things is an evil prostitute spirit her outward being her physical body her flesh she might be clean she might not commit any adultery and could swear to God and be the truth that she never but her spirit everybody say her spirit is a prostitute spirit she has been so blinded by the God of this world of fashion she dressed herself sexy and got out there yet the musicians will come but a woman can't be in her right mind and put on a bikini she is possessed with the prostitute Spirit now you settle that with God lady because you'll find out someday that that is the truth how could you a lady knowing how sacred your body is and expose it out there to these lustful sinful Devils that walk the street of this day if sons of God was all still sons of God your husband was the son of God he would either make you put on clothes or Leave You if a boy was the son of God he would never marry such a thing see I'm telling you the truth and someday you'll meet it naked adulterous and don't know it can you say man so sisters stay true you mothers teacher daughters to live right don't let him wear them short skirts and sex appeal dresses and it's sad to say that young girls are wearing these sex appeal it's sad that they're being taught it they're being allowed to do these things but you remember who you are as a woman and you teacher to girls who they are but they are not just for the world's picking if they are Daughters of God and this is the way God wants them to live live clean live pure and this message is gathering us Gathering us around aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that the prophets stay true to the word of God we see that there's two two opposing Spirits at work today of course one of them is the Holy Spirit the other one is the spirit of the devil which is in this last day working in deception and the prophet said there cannot be more than two heads and the people of the Earth are now making their choice [Music] I want to put that to you now she's making her choice the people of the age are making their choices this is where the separation is coming it is manifesting time and people are making their choices their Trials come things come and watch what the choices they make [Music] right what they're going to do see where it's taking them that the message of the hour is drawing the elect together can you say man amen he says the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he is doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see in this age the eye will see the spirit of God as it's growled into the full stature of God is the age that we're now living in the Holy Spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos so now you know why he's Vindicated the message of the hour so that you and I could be called out of the chaos he said see the devil's Unholy spirit is is here calling his church by the error and as usual by perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning see it coming right back to that seed time again from Eden here it is again can you say man but here as as the church natural is found naked if you notice at the same time the bride is found closed I'm going to just read you some scriptures right fast Revelations 1 13 and in the midst of the seven golden seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothes thereby say closed with a garment down to the foot brother Brown said that was the bride and gerd about the paps with the golden girdle Revelations 3 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment Revelation 7 9 after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number all of nation of all Nations kindreds people's tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in their hands Revelations 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted as she should be arrayed in fine linen and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints aren't you glad for that how's she going to be clothed brother Brown said all men has forsaken me because I took a true word and stood by the word I've stayed right here to what he said to me preach the word not a denominational philosophy preach the word that was my commission stay with the word and Brethren who has listened to this on tape I was a great guy when I come among you just Healing The Sick speaking of visions and showing things but when I went to tell you the truth about the word what did you turn your back on me for do you realize it's just fulfilling what the scripture said yes it does that way now I can hardly get in a place see letter comes all the time one come the other day said brother Branham I had the greatest confidence in you but I heard you say that a certain denomination which I belong to was backsliding said I have no more confidence in you at all now from now on said there was about 25 of the Brethren of my denominations setting in one of your meetings we just got right up and went out off when you when you said that see well all men has forsaken me but there's one thing he stood by me see I wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision that happened down there on the river I stayed true to him he's been true to me I'm trusting in Him someday I don't know when for crowning of my Ministry I've stayed just as true as I could be I don't know what it'll be I don't know when it'll be and just when he's ready I am done up here I hope he'll Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothe of the word and for his righteousness I hope he will Crown me and let me stand on that day and say Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world there's so many heels to climb upward and the strain sometimes it gets hard but the one that points the pathway knows just what's best he knows what's best the tolls of the road will seem nothing when we get to the end of the way let's hunt for that Bloody footprint just remember Friends The Sands has been washed in the footprints of that stranger on Galilee Shore and that voice that subdued the rough Billows will be heard in Judea no more but the path of that long Galilean so gladly I followed today and the toll of the road will seem nothing when I get to the end of the way in the first part of the scripture he says I read he gave to me when I was a young man just a boy standing out there shoulder straight chest thrown out shock of wavy black hair and now I stand stooped shouldered bald-headed graying an old man of 53 years old but he's sweeter as the day goes by I've not shunned to declare to you the whole Gospel of Jesus Christ and my heart's desire is to meet the church which he has died for clothed in the righteous business of his own blood dressed in his word in the righteousness of his word for his word can never fail and therefore I know if I'll stand by the word and be true to the word and if the word abides in me and I in him at that day I'll be happy that I stay true aren't you happy that he has stayed true to the word I'm so happy hallelujah hallelujah what's all a man sing it now oh give me the world [Music] make it plain and clear to me
