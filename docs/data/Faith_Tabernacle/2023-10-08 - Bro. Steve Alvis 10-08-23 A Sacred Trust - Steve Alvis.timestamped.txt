[36:11] thank you my
[36:13] brother I think we're getting a little
[36:15] bit of ring on
[36:17] this thank you
[36:21] brother good to be with you miss our
[36:24] brother Sean we appreciate the uh
[36:27] privilege to have worship god with
[36:30] you let him break the bread of life for
[36:33] us tonight
[36:35] together and uh if you have your Bibles
[36:38] would I like to turn to the book of uh
[36:41] Romans chapter
[36:55] 7
[37:16] start to
[37:17] [Laughter]
[37:21] preach well
[37:23] okay bring greetings from the Saints and
[37:25] GX brother Darren said tell youall hello
[37:29] and uh oh there's some other things I'm
[37:32] supposed to say I don't remember right
[37:33] now we'll just we'll try to get into the
[37:35] word
[37:39] um Romans 7 and verse
[37:44] one know ye not brethren for I speak to
[37:49] them that know the
[37:51] law how that the
[37:53] law hath dominion over man as long as he
[37:57] liveth so he's speaking of the law here
[38:00] the law has dominion over man as long as
[38:02] he liveth then he
[38:05] says verse Two for the woman which hath
[38:08] an husband is bound by the law to her
[38:10] husband so long as he
[38:13] liveth but if the husband be dead she is
[38:16] loose from the law of her
[38:17] husband so then if while her husband
[38:20] liveth she be married to another man she
[38:22] shall be called an
[38:24] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[38:26] she is free from that law so that she is
[38:29] no more adulterous though she be married
[38:32] to another man wherefore my brethren ye
[38:36] are ye also are become dead to the law
[38:40] by the body of Christ that ye should be
[38:43] married to another even to him who is
[38:46] raised from the dead that we should
[38:48] bring forth fruit unto
[38:51] God for when we were in the flesh the
[38:55] Motions of sins which were by the law
[38:57] did work in our members to bring forth
[38:59] fruit unto
[39:01] death for now but now we are delivered
[39:05] from the law that being dead wherein we
[39:08] were held that we should serve in the
[39:11] newness of spirit and not in the oldness
[39:15] of the letter let us pray our dear God
[39:20] we love you we thank you for thy mercy
[39:22] and thy Grace for thy truth Lord we
[39:25] thank you for the message of this hour
[39:27] Lord for awaking us from our Slumber our
[39:31] sleep Lord God let the light of God rise
[39:33] and shine upon us Lord God we thank you
[39:36] for bringing us out of Darkness Lord God
[39:39] for for for giving us a new husband a
[39:42] new nature father we love you we thank
[39:44] you for the privilege of worshiping with
[39:47] you with the saints of God to Worship

[40:17] message that the prophet of God brought

[40:22] the way that you can bring it forth the

[40:42] here than how we came in Lord may you
[40:44] bless your people and meet the needs in
[40:46] jesus' name amen God bless you may be
[40:51] seated so
[40:53] tonight well not going to preach
[40:55] marriage and divorce so
[40:57] so just um even though those scriptures
[41:00] could maybe pertain to that but I'd like
[41:02] to speak on uh a sacred
[41:04] trust so we we might if you're familiar
[41:08] with the message you you've seen
[41:10] that uh phrase before and invisible
[41:13] Union of the
[41:15] Bride so uh so that's uh but God's help
[41:18] and Grace is what we like to speak on
[41:20] tonight a sacred trust so we see here
[41:24] Paul is speaking about law and Grace and
[41:27] he's typing out like it would be
[41:29] marriage and
[41:30] divorce um that's right but but he's
[41:33] speaking of something else speaking of
[41:34] something greater he's speaking of the
[41:36] church and of Christ see we are the
[41:38] bride we are married to him he is our
[41:40] headship and so then he he he preaches
[41:43] that message invisible Union of the
[41:45] Bride he he doesn't preach it at
[41:46] Jeffersonville he preaches it down in
[41:48] shareport and it wasn't very well
[41:51] received was
[41:52] it but well not by them but by us it was
[41:56] was wasn't it and uh the bride's going
[41:59] to receive the word of
[42:01] God amen amen I was looking for a clock
[42:06] all right I need to find out when I
[42:08] start sometimes cuz uh we uh want to
[42:11] hand to service over to our brother I
[42:15] don't see him now but I don't want to
[42:17] hand it over to brother Sean we be here
[42:19] a while all right so in Ephesians 5 and
[42:23] 25 Paul says husbands love your wives
[42:26] even as Christ also loved the church and
[42:28] gave himself for
[42:29] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[42:32] with the washing of the Water by the
[42:34] word so he's talking about the church
[42:36] here again in Ephesians now that he
[42:39] might present to himself a glorious
[42:41] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[42:43] such thing but that it should be holy
[42:46] and without blemish this is God's vision
[42:48] of his bride he will bring it to pass
[42:51] this is God's vision of you of me of
[42:56] those who will be translated in this
[42:58] last day she will be without spot she
[43:01] will be without blemish and what God's
[43:03] word come to produce it will produce
[43:06] without fail God never fails his word is
[43:09] true it will not fall to the ground
[43:11] every last predestinated seat of God
[43:13] will come in and then we'll go home
[43:17] that's right all
[43:19] right husbands love your wives even if
[43:22] also Christ loved the church and gave
[43:25] himself for it
[43:27] that's his love for us expressing that
[43:30] now husbands you ought to express your
[43:32] love to your wife the same way now but I
[43:35] didn't come to preach on that part of it
[43:37] okay Glory CU Paul says nevertheless and
[43:40] then there but anyway that he might
[43:41] sanctify it so he's our sanctifier and
[43:45] he might cleanse it with the washing of
[43:46] the Water by the word so when the word
[43:48] of God comes forth It's the washing of
[43:50] the water the word that cleanses us when
[43:53] we confess our sins to him he is
[43:55] faithful and just to cleanse us and to
[43:57] forgive us of all unrighteousness we
[44:00] canot clean ourselves we'll be like the
[44:02] leopard licking the spots and they just
[44:03] get brighter more contrast but he can
[44:06] wash us as white as snow glory and the
[44:09] washing of the word that keeps us clean
[44:11] like they they went to the labor they
[44:13] they got
[44:14] their they would wash their hands and
[44:16] their feet and so forth they and and
[44:18] Peter when he was uh getting his feet
[44:20] Washed by Jesus he said oh Lord wash me
[44:22] all over he said no you're already been
[44:25] washed you're already
[44:26] but but it's sufficient I just you have
[44:28] to wash your feet so we get Washed by
[44:31] the washing of the water of the word so
[44:34] that now this is him doing it this is a
[44:36] man doing this with the the word of God
[44:38] it's it's God using the man God's spirit
[44:41] speaking through man that he can he's
[44:44] the one that's washing the church the
[44:47] preacher doesn't have to drag you up to
[44:48] the Altar and scrub you down behind the
[44:50] ears but the word of God might do it all
[44:53] right yeah all right now okay but but
[44:57] he's doing it for a reason that he can
[44:59] present to
[45:00] himself he's the one doing the
[45:02] presenting yeah he's presenting to
[45:04] himself a glorious
[45:06] church he doesn't make junk he does
[45:11] everything right he is not a failure I
[45:14] might be a failure and maybe in our
[45:16] flesh we all are but he is not Glory he
[45:20] will perform the work until the end that
[45:22] which he started he will finish he will
[45:25] have a
[45:26] she will be without spot she will be
[45:29] without blemish now this old flesh it's
[45:31] going to be a cuckle burn till the day
[45:33] you die that's right but this thing on
[45:35] the inside the character of Jesus Christ
[45:38] it will be there in every elected member
[45:41] of the body of Christ for
[45:43] sure praise
[45:46] God you won't have a spot you won't have
[45:48] a wrinkle you will be holy and without
[45:51] blemish in his sight we thank God for
[45:54] the blood of Jesus Christ for without
[45:56] that it wouldn't be
[45:58] possible he says so ought men to love
[46:00] their wives as their own
[46:02] bodies so now remember this is for the
[46:05] church Christ loves us that much he that
[46:09] loveth his wife loveth
[46:11] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[46:13] own flesh but nourish and cherish it
[46:15] even as the Lord the church we are
[46:17] members of his body of his flesh and of
[46:20] his
[46:21] bones for this call shall the man leave
[46:24] a father and mother shall be joined with
[46:26] his wife and they shall two be one flesh
[46:29] this is a great mystery but I speak
[46:31] concerning Christ and the
[46:35] church praise God and and here we see in
[46:38] in 2 Corinthians 11
[46:41] 2-4 Paul says for I'm jealous over you
[46:44] with a Godly
[46:45] jealousy for I have espoused you this is
[46:48] the first church age now I have espoused
[46:51] you or engaged you betrothed you
[46:55] espoused you to one husband that I may
[46:58] present you a Chase virgin to christl
[47:01] this was God's desire through his first
[47:03] church age Messenger to present to
[47:05] Christ a a bride without spot without
[47:09] wrinkle well we know she fell at niia he
[47:12] says but I fear lest by any means as the
[47:15] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[47:18] subtility so your mind should be
[47:20] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[47:23] Christ they were taken away from the
[47:25] simp Simplicity God is re hidden in
[47:27] Simplicity and revealed in Simplicity
[47:29] why do you think the prophet of God at
[47:31] the opening of the seals had to open
[47:33] with that to bring us back to the full
[47:35] revelation of Jesus Christ to espouse a
[47:38] bride to Christ he had to get her back
[47:40] to the Simplicity and away from
[47:41] denominational man's
[47:44] theology
[47:45] amen
[47:47] corruption caused them to leave
[47:49] Simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[47:53] verse four for if he that cometh
[47:55] preacheth another Jesus whom we have not
[47:57] preached or you receive another Spirit
[47:59] which we have not received which you
[48:01] have not received or another gospel
[48:03] which you've not accepted you might be
[48:06] you might well bear with
[48:09] him so so there's a bride we're going to
[48:12] be a little slow getting started perhaps
[48:14] but that's
[48:15] okay Proverbs
[48:18] 30:20 such is the way of an adulterous
[48:21] woman she eateth she W and wipeth her
[48:24] mouth and saith I have done no
[48:27] wickedness all right we're going to read
[48:29] Genesis 3 and one here now the serpent
[48:33] he was more subtle than any beast of the
[48:35] field which the Lord God hath made and
[48:37] he said unto the woman yeath God said ye
[48:40] shall not eat of every tree of the
[48:41] garden and the woman said unto the
[48:43] serpent we may eat of every tree of the
[48:48] garden and the woman said unto the
[48:50] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[48:51] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[48:53] the tree which is in the midst of the
[48:55] garden God that said ye shall not eat it
[48:57] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[49:00] for God that doth know in the day that
[49:02] you eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[49:05] opened and you shall be as Gods knowing
[49:07] good and evil and when the woman saw
[49:10] that the tree was good for food and that
[49:12] it was pleasant to the eyes in a tree to
[49:14] be desired to make one wise she took the
[49:17] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[49:20] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[49:24] and the eyes of both of them were opened
[49:27] and they knew that they were naked and
[49:29] they sewed fig leaves together and made
[49:31] themselves
[49:33] aprons
[49:35] okay getting started now all right
[49:38] brother brandom said this is the best
[49:40] age to live in Hallelujah been down
[49:42] through the church ages there was a
[49:45] defilement there was another seed that
[49:47] came in the only Original Seed is the
[49:49] word of God the spoken word is the
[49:51] Original Seed it's the only thing that
[49:53] has life in it it's the only thing that
[49:55] can bring life to you and I then down
[49:57] through the Paul's age we would have
[49:58] loved to walked with Jesus we would Lov
[50:00] to hear the preaching of Paul we would
[50:02] Lov to been in service when they they
[50:04] preached past midnight and the and the
[50:06] young man fell out the window and died
[50:08] and was resurrected again wonderful
[50:11] times but we're living in another day it
[50:14] it would have been a wonderful thing to
[50:16] see Martin Luther put his thesis on the
[50:18] door of whittenberg Germany and say I
[50:21] protest the the Roman Catholic Church
[50:24] the just shall live by faith it was a
[50:26] wonderful thing in his day because life
[50:28] was coming out of a dead ground out of a
[50:31] Dark Ages right it would have been a
[50:34] great day to be in the days of Wesley
[50:37] and so on and it was for those who live
[50:40] there that's right but I'm glad I didn't
[50:42] live there amen when when sanctification
[50:44] was coming back into the church it would
[50:46] have been a great day at at the isua
[50:48] Street Revival when the when the gifts
[50:51] were restored into the church and the
[50:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost was was was
[50:55] being poured out Revival fire was
[50:58] striking the
[50:59] nation wonderful time but we're living a
[51:02] better day we're living in a greater day
[51:05] brother Brandon said I'm thankful to God
[51:07] to be living in this time of the closing
[51:09] of the scenes of the world's history I
[51:11] don't know if I would have had to say so
[51:13] before the foundation of the world and
[51:15] God would have laid out the old program
[51:17] to me and said I want you to preach and
[51:19] know what age you're going to desire go
[51:22] to the Earth to preach which which one
[51:23] would you pick he said I'd pick out of
[51:25] chose this age for I think this is the
[51:28] Golden
[51:29] Age why would I love to have heard Jesus
[51:31] say come unto me all ye that labor and
[51:35] are heavy laden I will give you rest oh
[51:38] how I love to to have been like they're
[51:40] sitting where John said to lean my head
[51:42] upon his bosom oh Lord won't you tell me
[51:45] something oh tell me what's going to be
[51:48] tomorrow what about this man over here
[51:51] Peter asked a question he said what's it
[51:53] to you follow thou me me might have been
[51:57] a little rougher than we think
[51:59] sometimes oh now what do we we I I would
[52:03] like that would we would we like when he
[52:07] go to church with Jesus and he's tearing
[52:10] down the money changers well he's making
[52:12] a whip and driving people out of the
[52:14] temple he looked up on them with anger
[52:16] amen
[52:18] well I would like to seen that but I
[52:21] don't think I could have run fast
[52:23] enough save my eyes he got out of there
[52:26] too when they were going to throw him
[52:27] over the hill he looked for a place to
[52:28] escape cuz it wasn't his time
[52:32] amen
[52:33] so well he's altogether
[52:36] lovely he has a way of doing
[52:39] things so
[52:41] uh yes we would like to have stood there
[52:44] with Peter when he said that day to Lord
[52:46] Lord to whom shall we go when the 70 had
[52:49] left we we love to set with there like
[52:52] the disciples and when they say Lord is
[52:54] it I
[52:56] is it I when he said one of you shall
[52:58] betray me Lord is it I they were
[53:00] searching themselves and they thought
[53:02] Judas was just going to go and and buy
[53:04] something for for them and oh they kind
[53:06] of thought well I wonder who it is but
[53:10] they were searching for themselves they
[53:11] were searching their own heart right we
[53:14] we would lik to have been there and not
[53:16] been
[53:16] Judas and we wouldn't have been because
[53:19] we weren't predestinated to that but we
[53:21] weren't predestinated for that allotment
[53:24] of time we were called for this age this
[53:27] day to live on Earth at this time at the
[53:30] coming of the Lord there has to be a

[58:13] into the great Millennium I still
[58:15] believe in the Millennium I still
[58:16] believe there's going to be a bride
[58:17] that's going to tread on the ashes of
[58:19] the wicked when she comes back after the
[58:21] the Great Tribulation and that she's
[58:22] going to have a Thousand-Year honeymoon
[58:24] with Jesus Christ because but she's
[58:26] married to him right here the the
[58:28] wedding band of predestinated unmar to
[58:31] Grace has slipped on her finger right
[58:33] here she has received it she's married
[58:36] to Christ right now amen we're going to
[58:40] not a marriage ceremony we're going to a
[58:43] wedding
[58:45] supper
[58:47] Lord all right here I'm going get to the
[58:50] intro all right Paul was the scripture
[58:53] that we read in Romans 7 s brother
[58:55] Brandon reads us this uh portion of
[58:58] scripture here in The Invisible Union of
[59:00] the Bride he says Paul here is giving an
[59:03] illustration in our scripture about law
[59:05] and
[59:06] Grace illustrating it like marriage and
[59:09] divorce and then I'm going to skip a
[59:10] little bit but most of the quotes I'm
[59:12] going to read will be from invisible
[59:13] Union of the Bride if you want to go
[59:15] back and listen to that you'll see how I
[59:16] was preaching the message and if if you
[59:19] find out something I say that's
[59:20] different you you come and talk to me
[59:22] please I said uh I was preach on
[59:24] creatures of Eternity one time and uh
[59:27] kept saying we're creatures of ET
[59:28] eternity we're not creatures of time and
[59:31] I said it the wrong way one time my wife
[59:32] said you know you said that once I said
[59:33] no I didn't did it really I had to say
[59:36] well my wife told me I said this and
[59:38] sorry take me for to mean or say or
[59:42] something like that but uh we make
[59:45] mistakes but not
[59:47] intentionally all right we don't handle
[59:49] the word of God
[59:51] deceitfully
[59:53] Amen Lord bless him
[59:56] Jesus
[59:57] amen good
[1:00:02] brother all right so the Scripture it
[1:00:05] also pertains to a greater portion a
[1:00:08] marriage divorce he says how that he's
[1:00:10] trying to set an order that we as a
[1:00:12] church can no be married no more be
[1:00:15] married to the world and to Christ at
[1:00:17] the same
[1:00:18] time and be legal and lawful about it
[1:00:21] then a woman can be living with a
[1:00:23] husband while she's got living
[1:00:25] husband now we would call that
[1:00:28] adultery and we should call the other
[1:00:30] thing adultery as well it's spiritual
[1:00:32] adultery sure now he said
[1:00:37] here that this unfolds one of the great
[1:00:41] mysteries of Prophecy this scripture
[1:00:44] here okay speaking of Christ having a
[1:00:48] bride we cannot be married to the world
[1:00:51] and to Christ at the same time come on
[1:00:53] Amen
[1:00:55] we have one husband we have one
[1:00:58] lover and the life we live proves who
[1:01:01] that is no matter what we say out of her
[1:01:04] mouth now he was preaching
[1:01:07] this though it wasn't at Jeffersonville
[1:01:09] he he said this several times that it
[1:01:11] was to the elect lady this message was
[1:01:13] invisible Union of the bride and
[1:01:17] uh he blessed a denominational ISM down
[1:01:20] there H they might not have received it
[1:01:22] for their day but the bride's going to
[1:01:24] receive it he was said he he was God has
[1:01:27] chosen elected lady which is his bride
[1:01:29] she is elected he said may I add to this
[1:01:32] woman Grace may I place her in the Bible
[1:01:34] also the elect lady she's called the
[1:01:36] elect lady Miss Grace I'm going to talk
[1:01:38] about the Bible declares to the elect
[1:01:41] lady that if you'll notice elect comes
[1:01:43] from the word elected lady one lady
[1:01:45] amongst all the other ladies was elected
[1:01:47] there's been churches churches Brides
[1:01:49] brides but there's coming one she's
[1:01:51] elected bride of Jesus Christ she's
[1:01:54] going to be bone of his bone flesh of
[1:01:56] his flesh life of his life word of his
[1:01:58] word she is in His image she is the word
[1:02:01] she is him made manifest on this Earth
[1:02:02] in feminine form Glory she has his name
[1:02:05] Mrs Jesus Christ she had a name change
[1:02:08] like Sarah had a name change Abraham had
[1:02:11] a name change the H got put into uh
[1:02:13] Abraham's name the H got put into his
[1:02:16] wife's name we call him Jesus we're
[1:02:19] called Mrs Jesus Christ we share a name
[1:02:22] change amen amen that's
[1:02:25] good all right he says don't feel bad
[1:02:28] now he had kind of don't feel bad now
[1:02:31] but these scriptures and so forth he
[1:02:32] says I'm speaking all to the country
[1:02:34] what I think is the elect
[1:02:36] lady and then he says here a little bit
[1:02:38] later he says now what happened here in
[1:02:41] marriage and divorce now you see what
[1:02:42] happened here he says the seals was open
[1:02:44] it brought it out the real truth of it
[1:02:47] so so he couldn't preach that before the
[1:02:49] seals he preached it after the seals and
[1:02:51] then a visible Union of the bride of
[1:02:53] Christ he had to preach that after that
[1:02:54] he had to come in succession he had a
[1:02:56] straighten out marriage and divorce
[1:02:58] before he could preach our our wedding
[1:03:01] ceremony about our invisible Union to
[1:03:04] our
[1:03:05] bridegroom that we couldn't come along
[1:03:07] bringing baggage from another marriage
[1:03:09] behind us spiritually speaking now I'm
[1:03:11] not talking about natural let your
[1:03:13] pastor straighten that out but we can't
[1:03:15] be dragging our denominational ideas in
[1:03:17] with us we can't be dragging our old
[1:03:19] nature in with us you can't be dragging
[1:03:21] I think we need to do this with us what
[1:03:24] did God say about it he's the husband
[1:03:28] that old husband's got to be dead that
[1:03:30] old Nature's got to be dead we can't
[1:03:32] hanging up for an occasion we can't put
[1:03:35] it aside and maybe I'll go back to it a
[1:03:36] little bit later if this doesn't work
[1:03:37] out there's people that's done that and
[1:03:40] look where they're at Judas for this
[1:03:44] day well I don't know if it's right I
[1:03:47] thought he told me he love me and I
[1:03:49] don't know if it's true
[1:03:52] Judas but you're you're you're called to
[1:03:54] overcome that nonsense and Tommy rot and
[1:03:57] trash he says the natural types the
[1:03:59] spirit I'm going have to fly through
[1:04:00] this we aren't you glad we're all
[1:04:03] astronauts you know we horse and buggy
[1:04:06] days we could kind of take it
[1:04:10] slow automobile age a little faster
[1:04:13] Pentecostal age with the plane that
[1:04:15] could take off and fly to Heights and go
[1:04:17] fast
[1:04:19] supersonic can't touch a rocket it's got
[1:04:22] a own an atmosphere built into it 1,700

[1:04:37] airplane it it stays in the world it it
[1:04:39] needs all that the rocket don't need
[1:04:41] that that's right oh that's why the
[1:04:44] Pentecostal are happy living in the the
[1:04:45] atmosphere of the world they don't mind
[1:04:47] that that's why the the other
[1:04:50] denominations and so forth they don't

[1:05:37] it's not even controlled by the pilots
[1:05:39] in there it's controlled by the control
[1:05:40] tower there there there's an unseen
[1:05:42] control that's guiding it to make sure
[1:05:44] it gets to its destination just right
[1:05:46] that's what we've got he's making sure
[1:05:48] we get to our destination just right
[1:05:51] everything's been pressurized
[1:05:52] everything's been tested by the world

[1:05:58] everything need of for this for for to

[1:06:03] your soul you have everything in you
[1:06:05] that you need from here to
[1:06:09] there praise God I might get to the
[1:06:11] message tonight oh mercy
[1:06:18] alrighty a little fast here he says when
[1:06:22] they okay down through the ages people
[1:06:26] said that you look at the women natural
[1:06:28] it types of
[1:06:29] church and now when there come a time
[1:06:32] when the people were ready to line up to
[1:06:34] the word of God then a message comes
[1:06:37] forth and they line with it so why do
[1:06:40] you line up with the message because
[1:06:42] you're elected to do so he's going to
[1:06:44] have a bride that shows you who you are
[1:06:47] if you're lining up because something in
[1:06:48] you makes you want to line up to this
[1:06:50] message to the word of God for your day
[1:06:52] that shows that you're part of the Bride
[1:06:54] of Jesus Christ man you man doesn't want
[1:06:57] that the flesh wouldn't want that but
[1:06:59] there's a deep that calls into the deep
[1:07:01] there's something that's crying out Lord
[1:07:02] make me like you I see this I'm looking
[1:07:05] in the mirror of God's word I want it to
[1:07:08] reflect you
[1:07:09] Lord God wants you to express him God is
[1:07:13] expressing
[1:07:14] himself all right just like any son is
[1:07:17] in the attributes of his father you were
[1:07:19] in the genes of your father the body of
[1:07:20] your father when you were a young boy
[1:07:22] you were in him yet could not have
[1:07:24] fellowship with you because he didn't
[1:07:26] know you but then through the beding
[1:07:27] grounds of a mother you were brought
[1:07:29] forth into the Earth and become in the
[1:07:31] image of your father and then he could
[1:07:32] have fellowship with you amen all right
[1:07:35] the same way as it is in the natural so
[1:07:38] it is in the
[1:07:39] spiritual God his elected predestinated
[1:07:44] seed she had to come forth somewhere
[1:07:46] there had to be a betting grounds it had
[1:07:48] to be the Church of the Living God a
[1:07:50] virgin bride to bring forth children
[1:07:53] unto him to bring forth manifested Sons
[1:07:56] and Daughters of God to bring forth sons
[1:07:59] that and daughters that are born of the
[1:08:00] word with a word birth can't happen in a
[1:08:07] denomination and therefore as sure as
[1:08:09] your Gene had to be in your father
[1:08:10] before your natural birth your spiritual
[1:08:12] had Gene had to be in God because you're
[1:08:14] an expression of the attributes of his
[1:08:16] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:08:18] world right no way around it now notice
[1:08:21] that life being in you God's life being
[1:08:23] in you from the foundation of the world
[1:08:25] he says now every generation he adds a
[1:08:27] new part to of his book so every part of
[1:08:30] the book had had a different part of the
[1:08:32] generations in there he says like my
[1:08:34] body was built started from the spine
[1:08:36] wasn't all spine went from ribs to ribs
[1:08:38] you know it went from cell to cell and
[1:08:40] it Formed an image and like down Through
[1:08:42] the Ages you could see well there's a
[1:08:44] part of it here part of it here but now
[1:08:45] in this time once it's done at the very
[1:08:48] end it it it represents what the seed
[1:08:50] life was it represents it's an Express
[1:08:53] image of the father and that's who
[1:08:55] you're supposed to be and that's who you
[1:08:56] are and express image of God in flesh
[1:09:01] tonight it didn't so much look like it
[1:09:03] in the developmental stages in the in
[1:09:05] Luther there was life and there might
[1:09:07] have been some kicking around sometimes
[1:09:09] and so forth but but
[1:09:12] now you're coming up into the stature of
[1:09:15] a perfect man yes amen so God wanted to
[1:09:19] express himself through his
[1:09:22] church amen
[1:09:24] thank you Jesus down Through the
[1:09:26] Ages he speak he types it out here with
[1:09:28] the the evolution and the different
[1:09:30] creatures and so forth God bringing up a
[1:09:32] man and then he
[1:09:38] says we have to skip a little bit for
[1:09:40] time all
[1:09:42] right yes
[1:09:45] sir all right let's get to the the title
[1:09:47] of the message here a sacred
[1:09:51] trust okay that was all kind of a
[1:09:53] foundation here here so what I want to
[1:09:54] talk to you about tonight is what God
[1:09:56] has given every one of us as a as a
[1:09:59] virgin bride to Christ he called a
[1:10:01] sacred trust some of us might have
[1:10:04] already known about this might have
[1:10:06] heard about it might have been do a
[1:10:08] wonderful thing maybe some people
[1:10:09] haven't heard about it maybe it we'd
[1:10:12] listen to it and passed it by but we
[1:10:14] need to know this it's important God
[1:10:16] wants us to know about these things he
[1:10:17] has given each one of us as individuals
[1:10:20] and as a church a and as a body of
[1:10:22] Christ worldwide
[1:10:24] a sacred
[1:10:26] trust then he types it out here with the
[1:10:28] woman so it's what we're going to read
[1:10:30] here for a minute a woman and think
[1:10:33] about the church too now the woman is
[1:10:36] entrusted with certain characters that
[1:10:37] she must not
[1:10:39] defile so is the church the church must
[1:10:42] not defile that he said a woman is
[1:10:44] trusted to that there's not a creature
[1:10:46] on earth like a woman no female dog no
[1:10:48] female any kind entrusted with the
[1:10:50] character that a woman is a woman was
[1:10:52] not even in the beginning of the
[1:10:54] creation because God know that she would
[1:10:55] fall all other me females could not
[1:10:58] commit adultery she's the only one that
[1:10:59] can commit adultery if she had been made
[1:11:02] in like the original it would have been
[1:11:03] disc complimentary to God's great wisdom
[1:11:06] see she was a byproduct of
[1:11:08] man but because she was cast over in
[1:11:10] that side she also has been given a
[1:11:13] sacred charge from God for Redemption
[1:11:16] praise the Lord man couldn't do it right
[1:11:20] oh my the sisters have got something on
[1:11:23] the Brothers here all right a sacred
[1:11:26] charge from
[1:11:29] God all right Pope can't do
[1:11:33] this preacher can't do
[1:11:35] this all
[1:11:37] right she's got characters she must not
[1:11:40] defile I said she's been given a sacred
[1:11:43] charge from God if she' Mar them she's
[1:11:46] defiled for a lifetime no matter how
[1:11:48] much she's forgiven she can't be
[1:11:49] justified I striking a little bit he
[1:11:51] says got a scripture on a few minutes
[1:11:52] she can be forgiven for defilement but
[1:11:54] she cannot be justified in this life
[1:11:57] always with her notice now she's been
[1:11:59] given this she may be forgiven but not
[1:12:01] justified think about the churches now
[1:12:04] every one of the daughters of the Roman
[1:12:06] Catholic church but were started off as
[1:12:08] virgins to the word they are pure they
[1:12:11] started with the word for their day but
[1:12:13] there came a time where they took
[1:12:14] another seed that wasn't the word of God
[1:12:16] and they denominated around the the seed
[1:12:19] idea word of a man and what happened
[1:12:22] they got defiled and and they brought
[1:12:23] forth other children other than Sons and
[1:12:26] Daughters of God they brought the forth
[1:12:27] the denominational
[1:12:29] members okay and they had to be put away
[1:12:32] for their defilement they could no
[1:12:34] longer come back to the word because
[1:12:35] they could not repent God says he gave
[1:12:37] her space to repent but she would not
[1:12:38] repent speaking of the Catholic church
[1:12:40] amen so you see that there now her
[1:12:45] body's given to her a sacred Trust From
[1:12:48] God no female dog no bird no other
[1:12:51] animal no creature like that the only
[1:12:53] one on the reason it's so sacred is
[1:12:56] because she's to bring forth life into
[1:12:58] the Earth her body is the betting
[1:13:00] grounds of life therefore the reason is
[1:13:03] she's given the sacred
[1:13:05] trust okay now what did I say what why
[1:13:08] are we talking about the woman here
[1:13:10] because she's a type of the
[1:13:11] church we see the immoral women where
[1:13:14] they are Revelation 17 and so forth and
[1:13:17] her daughters we see that but there's a
[1:13:19] real true genuine virtuous woman the
[1:13:22] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:23] amen so where where there's a bad one
[1:13:26] where there's a bad Church there's a
[1:13:28] true bride that's a her husband is the
[1:13:31] word she will receive nothing from
[1:13:33] anyone else she won't even flirt with
[1:13:35] those
[1:13:36] things those things are dead to
[1:13:39] her praise
[1:13:42] God all
[1:13:47] right all right and we see Eve brought
[1:13:51] forth two twins Cain and Abel from
[1:13:53] different
[1:13:54] fathers all right her body is the
[1:13:58] bedding grounds therefore it's a sacred
[1:13:59] trust not to defile that I'm speaking
[1:14:01] now bring to this to an illustration to
[1:14:03] show you where the church stands not
[1:14:05] speaking of you women he say I'm
[1:14:07] speaking of the church and
[1:14:10] Christ she's given this the church now
[1:14:14] to bring forth life that only God
[1:14:17] himself can give her husband might be
[1:14:20] the germ Bearer but God has to produce
[1:14:22] the life that's that's right it has to
[1:14:24] come all life has to come from
[1:14:27] God all right what's that have to do
[1:14:30] with us well we're going to read here he
[1:14:32] said there's three things here that she
[1:14:35] must not get away from she has a sacred
[1:14:38] Trust of virtue committed to her by the
[1:14:40] Lord a certain virtue nothing else holds
[1:14:42] it but a woman that's committed to her
[1:14:45] by God she must not defile that virtue
[1:14:48] now he says the Womanhood I'm speaking
[1:14:50] of is her conduct her character around
[1:14:52] men
[1:14:55] okay
[1:15:00] yes all right he says if she does
[1:15:02] something wrong she must confess it to
[1:15:04] her husband before he takes her and
[1:15:05] makes it right the same as the church
[1:15:08] was married to the law also has to come
[1:15:10] before Christ before the second marriage
[1:15:12] she has to confess that if she doesn't
[1:15:14] and she lives with her husband for 10
[1:15:16] years and confesses it he has a right to
[1:15:17] put her away and marry another woman the
[1:15:19] scripture said fornication unclean
[1:15:22] living Joseph fear not to take thee
[1:15:24] marry thy wife which is that which
[1:15:26] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost he
[1:15:28] was minded to put her away put her away
[1:15:29] means divorce her privately seeing he
[1:15:32] was already engaged to her when you're
[1:15:34] engaged as to her as far as God is
[1:15:36] concerned you're married to her now she
[1:15:38] has a sacred Trust of virtue that's been
[1:15:40] given to her trusted to her by the Lord
[1:15:42] that gave her that virtue just as it was
[1:15:44] in The Garden Eden she can say yes or
[1:15:46] she can say no she has a sacred Trust of
[1:15:48] Womanhood committed to her that she must
[1:15:50] not break the Womanhood I'm speaking of
[1:15:52] here is her conduct her character around
[1:15:54] men not letting every man and then they
[1:15:57] goes on to say some other things here in
[1:15:58] a minute but what is
[1:16:01] this the church the bride of Christ has
[1:16:04] been given sacred trust she's been given
[1:16:07] a virtue that she must not defile that's
[1:16:09] right she's been given a character that
[1:16:12] she must not
[1:16:15] defile now I don't know what I'm you
[1:16:18] know this I'm speaking of spiritual
[1:16:20] things now I'm speaking of the church I
[1:16:23] I'm not speaking of whatever condition
[1:16:25] you might happen to be in don't let
[1:16:27] Satan try to put a cloud over you about
[1:16:29] the whatever that's I'm not not God
[1:16:31] forgave you he called you he brought you
[1:16:35] to the truth for a
[1:16:36] reason you don't let Satan talk you out
[1:16:38] of that God loves you he gave you his
[1:16:42] word for a reason he forgave you for a
[1:16:44] reason don't let Satan put put something

[1:17:08] true
[1:17:10] and God had a reason for saving you God
[1:17:13] had a reason for giving you the Holy
[1:17:14] Ghost he had a reason for bringing you
[1:17:16] into this
[1:17:17] message that's why when when brother
[1:17:20] Brandon was preaching marriage and a
[1:17:21] divorce at the end what did he say don't
[1:17:24] I teach your children to never do those
[1:17:26] things again but he said go on as you
[1:17:28] are he said this was to the people that
[1:17:30] followed his message Grace was given by
[1:17:32] permission of the Lord God had a way to
[1:17:35] forgive those
[1:17:36] things amen okay and if you listen to
[1:17:40] that message too there's other things in
[1:17:42] there besides that and it what if you
[1:17:44] listen at it go back and listen to that
[1:17:46] sometime and look how God and his bride
[1:17:49] are together well and you'll see this
[1:17:52] too also in invisible ible Union of the
[1:17:54] Bride now this bride her she has a
[1:17:57] character like no other church has she
[1:18:00] has a conduct like no other church has
[1:18:04] okay she's not going to say she'll say
[1:18:07] yes to God and she'll say no to the
[1:18:08] things of the
[1:18:10] world she can turn down false Doctrine
[1:18:13] she doesn't have to to compromise on the
[1:18:15] word of God she doesn't have to
[1:18:17] compromise on every spirit that tries to
[1:18:18] come into the church and say and pet it
[1:18:21] so no you get you out of here
[1:18:24] you're not going to be in our home she's
[1:18:26] going to keep her home clean she's going
[1:18:28] to keep her heart clean before God she's
[1:18:31] not going to let it be defiled by the
[1:18:32] world if you listen to way of true
[1:18:35] Prophet lately it's a good one you know
[1:18:38] he's telling them people not to go down
[1:18:40] to the
[1:18:41] racetracks playing cards and stuff
[1:18:44] that's not for the bride you don't have
[1:18:46] any business going down to the car races
[1:18:48] and the RAC trcks and so forth you don't
[1:18:51] have any business down at the ball game
[1:18:52] Jes calling yourself a Christian you can
[1:18:54] hear that in enticing Spirits I don't
[1:18:56] make these things up but this is our
[1:18:58] message we we got to take it all we must
[1:19:01] not be defiled by the things of the
[1:19:03] world we must not be defiled by
[1:19:05] Hollywood we don't they might kiss and
[1:19:07] slop and live like ungodly adulterers
[1:19:09] and adulteresses out there but that's
[1:19:11] not for the bride of Christ she doesn't
[1:19:13] need to be slopping around around with
[1:19:15] false Doctrine with money making
[1:19:17] programs with with the things of the
[1:19:19] world no sir she's virtuous to him she
[1:19:23] doesn't need programs in the church to
[1:19:24] hold people she doesn't need to to build
[1:19:27] Sports Arenas and stuff to to hold
[1:19:29] people the gospel has not lost its
[1:19:32] attraction she's going to lift up Jesus
[1:19:34] Christ she's going to lift up this
[1:19:35] message which is Christ and that will
[1:19:37] draw every elected seed of God to
[1:19:41] him oh you can't run off the elected
[1:19:44] seat of God by preaching the message no
[1:19:46] sir you might run off the
[1:19:48] goats oh run off a sheep with the word
[1:19:53] how that's what they feed on right here
[1:19:57] here sheep here's some sheep food you
[1:20:00] know they're going they go to it the
[1:20:01] Shepherd that has the Sheep food they're
[1:20:03] not going to run away from them when
[1:20:05] they're
[1:20:07] hungry the goats might say
[1:20:10] oh I don't like that well
[1:20:13] okay all right so speaking of Hollywood
[1:20:18] here he said look on these screens the
[1:20:20] the movie stars kissing hugging slopping
[1:20:22] around around over these women a woman
[1:20:24] does that is a bad character she might
[1:20:26] be virtuous otherwise but seeing her
[1:20:28] heart sex glands are in the lips the man
[1:20:30] kisses a woman he's actually potentially
[1:20:33] committed adultery sex glands are in the
[1:20:35] woman's lips and in the man's lips he
[1:20:37] could kiss her on the hand it wouldn't
[1:20:39] mix through the sex glands but the sex
[1:20:41] glands are in the lips and all see all
[1:20:43] this nonsense of the Hollywood today all
[1:20:45] this slopping and loving around with
[1:20:47] women and so forth and little girls
[1:20:48] looking at that no wonder our morals are
[1:20:51] rotten decayed filthy see because it's
[1:20:53] put before the children so that's why
[1:20:55] the world is in the way it is today
[1:20:58] that's why the church world is in the
[1:20:59] way that it is today
[1:21:02] Hollywood now they got got rid of the
[1:21:04] tele well no they didn't get rid of the
[1:21:05] television they might have got the the
[1:21:07] movies out and then put the television
[1:21:08] in the house then they they renamed it
[1:21:11] to monitor then they brought it on their
[1:21:13] cell phone and still watching Hollywood
[1:21:15] Movies oh poisoning the minds of little
[1:21:18] girls when they see that Tommy right on
[1:21:20] there it defiles their mind
[1:21:23] the eye is the gateway to the
[1:21:25] soul okay I'm just trying I'm trying to
[1:21:29] hurry oh my all
[1:21:31] right we must guard what goes in these
[1:21:35] eyes we have a you know we we we our
[1:21:38] mind is the
[1:21:40] Battleground are you going to supply the
[1:21:42] devil with
[1:21:43] ammunition uhuh the soul is the control
[1:21:47] tower where God is when you've been
[1:21:49] baptized with the Holy Ghost this is
[1:21:50] your control tower this is where Satan
[1:21:53] chose and this is where the Battlefront
[1:21:56] is this is where the battle takes place
[1:21:58] this is where right God in your heart
[1:22:01] meet the wrong Satan and his thoughts
[1:22:03] that would bombard you his ideas that
[1:22:05] are contrary to the word that you're
[1:22:07] commanded to cast down cast down the
[1:22:09] reasoning cast down every imagination
[1:22:11] and high thought that exalts itself
[1:22:13] against

[1:22:25] age but you're going to have to fight
[1:22:28] you have to fight for every inch of
[1:22:29] ground to get it and you're going to
[1:22:31] have to fight to keep it but praise be
[1:22:33] to God you have been ordained to have
[1:22:34] the victory in Jesus Christ praise the
[1:22:37] Lord Jesus the only loser around here is
[1:22:39] the
[1:22:40] devil and Jesus is the winner
[1:22:43] man all

[1:22:48] the church not the bride She's kissing
[1:22:50] and slopping mixing around and
[1:22:52] everything else but the word let the
[1:22:53] devil in education and scientific

[1:31:03] committing adultery with everything she
[1:31:05] has no business going into she should
[1:31:07] stay with the

[1:31:35] school literature they'll bring it out
[1:31:37] in some false devotional that contrary
[1:31:40] to the word of God and it's a it's a
[1:31:41] different man every week because Christ
[1:31:44] has left out picture because he's been
[1:31:45] kicked out of the layot to seean church
[1:31:47] age but not so for the bride she's

[1:32:09] ungodly no virtue he saw him dancing to
[1:32:13] the beat of rock and roll undressed

[1:33:57] a woman has a sacred responsibility to
[1:33:58] Motherhood to virtues to her husband the
[1:34:00] church has a sacred responsibility to

[1:34:47] it's true a lot of preachers will preach
[1:34:49] on prayer
[1:34:50] meetings but that you never have them in
[1:34:52] the church oh we used to have prayer
[1:34:54] meetings well what
[1:34:56] happened have a prayer meeting watch
[1:34:59] what God can do it was in the house of
[1:35:01] uh oh my we we don't read the book of
[1:35:04] Acts and see what prayer did okay to say
[1:35:06] that for time but it how did they get
[1:35:09] called to the mission field and how did
[1:35:10] the Holy Ghost speak it was during when
[1:35:12] the saints assembled themselves together
[1:35:13] and prayed separate me Paul and Barnabas
[1:35:16] for the work I have called unto them to
[1:35:18] do and so on and so forth God speaks in

[1:36:49] to the king and she she put full
[1:36:51] confidence in her Messenger to only
[1:36:53] dress herself with what was given her by
[1:36:55] that messenger so with the bride of
[1:36:58] Christ only dress herself in the
[1:36:59] revelation of this hour of the word of
[1:37:01] God the wedding garment the baptism of

[1:37:38] in the church Hallelujah okay so that
[1:37:40] people can be birthed by the word of God
[1:37:43] the preaching of the word could cast out
[1:37:44] evil spirits you can receive your
[1:37:46] healing by the preaching of the word am
[1:37:49] true friends it's a sacred truth trust
[1:37:52] to to not to come to church all tired

[1:37:56] service is harder our flesh gets quick
[1:37:58] I'm not condemning anybody okay I I'm
[1:38:01] but but we that's something we got to
[1:38:03] watch out for because this is our enemy
[1:38:05] this is our greatest enemy right here
[1:38:06] these 16 elements of My Flesh is mine
[1:38:09] and yours is yours we've got to watch
[1:38:11] those things we've got to be careful for
[1:38:13] that we must enter and realize what God
[1:38:17] has given us to the sacred trust to come
[1:38:20] with expectation that God is going to
[1:38:21] move amongst his people that we welcome
[1:38:24] W with the musicians as they play with
[1:38:26] the preaching of the word that that that
[1:38:28] he gets himself out of the way that God
[1:38:29] can speak that God can have the the Holy
[1:38:33] Ghost can have preeminence in the
[1:38:35] service we don't want to run out the
[1:38:37] move of the Holy Ghost friends we don't
[1:38:39] want to oh friends we we must not do
[1:38:42] that it's a sacred trust God doesn't
[1:38:45] want us to be cold and formal and he
[1:38:46] doesn't want us to be lukewarm that's
[1:38:48] the curse of the age is
[1:38:49] lukewarmness to to J jump and shout and
[1:38:51] live like the devil brother brandom said
[1:38:53] don't jump any higher than you live and
[1:38:55] then you got people on the other side
[1:38:57] that's cold formal and intellectual what
[1:38:59] do they do oh that's ner nothing to well
[1:39:04] friends yes the Holy Ghost brings
[1:39:07] emotion emotion's not the Holy Ghost
[1:39:10] amen if your experience doesn't take you
[1:39:14] back to the word the message of the day
[1:39:16] you leave that alone and get the real
[1:39:17] thing the heavens is full of the real
[1:39:20] don't settle for anything less than they
[1:39:22] received on the day of
[1:39:24] Pentecost oh my the church world has
[1:39:28] gone off an Institutional programs
[1:39:29] building programs in school he said they
[1:39:31] serve their purpose but Jesus didn't say
[1:39:33] that he said preach the word he didn't
[1:39:35] say go make
[1:39:36] schools he said that's where they
[1:39:37] neglect it they make these
[1:39:39] things it's not the church's Duty the
[1:39:42] I'm I'm paraphrasing a little bit here
[1:39:44] too to save time the church duty is to
[1:39:46] preach the gospel now we know teaching
[1:39:48] is word of the word that's that's part
[1:39:50] of the the thing but preaching the
[1:39:52] gospel is demonstration of the word it's
[1:39:55] through the demonstration of the word of
[1:39:57] God for example they hands on the sick
[1:39:58] and they shall recover you do it after
[1:40:01] you know anybody needs lay hand okay we
[1:40:03] do that the sick are healed devils are
[1:40:05] cast out so on so
[1:40:07] forth lives are
[1:40:10] changed okay demonstration of the word
[1:40:14] in action through
[1:40:16] vessels all right that's the duty of the
[1:40:19] churches to preach the gospel he we've
[1:40:21] done everything else but that and we
[1:40:22] drifted in just like Satan did to mix it
[1:40:24] up with some gospel something else
[1:40:25] something else tell it's a collaboration
[1:40:27] of nothing speaking of the church world
[1:40:29] now don't don't never do that Satan came
[1:40:32] into them and and it worked for them for
[1:40:35] the Pentecostal age just like it worked
[1:40:37] for vashy when she said I got my gifts I
[1:40:39] I got my my my church association with
[1:40:41] all the other women maybe they was women
[1:40:43] preachers or something I don't know but
[1:40:46] but they was type of the church women's
[1:40:47] type of the church and she had her
[1:40:49] women's Society no head around anywhere
[1:40:52] and she was retreated from the word the
[1:40:55] king and and what she said I I'm
[1:40:57] sufficient in myself just like the
[1:40:59] Catholic Church said uh uh you know the
[1:41:01] scripture there most of you do but what
[1:41:04] is it it's a type
[1:41:08] there she didn't have need of the word
[1:41:10] God put her away and chose Esther God
[1:41:13] put Pentecost away he chose the
[1:41:17] bride he did so Satan came in and said
[1:41:20] you don't really need all that word like
[1:41:22] that so Satan how he came in there at
[1:41:25] Pentecost the same Temptation the same
[1:41:28] tactic he's going to try but it won't be
[1:41:30] successful in this bride she won't take
[1:41:33] anything else but the word of God she's
[1:41:35] overcome this world she's overcome
[1:41:38] denominationalism amen and at some point
[1:41:41] in your life Satan will tempt you one
[1:41:42] way or the other you with with these
[1:41:45] things God will allow it because he has
[1:41:49] confidence in you that you will over
[1:41:50] overcome
[1:41:53] it all
[1:41:55] right the Temptation the decision where
[1:41:59] Pentecost said yes or no and she took
[1:42:00] that other thing in the same thing will
[1:42:03] come around the message the bride will
[1:42:06] not fall to that she won't let that in
[1:42:08] her life amen she can be tempted by it
[1:42:11] though all
[1:42:17] right prise God
[1:42:24] all
[1:42:27] right we cannot be married to these
[1:42:30] other things and to the word Christ at
[1:42:32] the same time or the Bible speaks of
[1:42:35] spiritual adultery we don't want to be
[1:42:37] guilty of that we've been given a sacred
[1:42:40] charge to hold the word of God true to
[1:42:42] our heart and to not even flirt with the
[1:42:44] things of the world I'm going have to
[1:42:46] skip a lot you can listen to brother
[1:42:48] brandom there invisible Union of the
[1:42:50] Bride if you want want to catch the rest
[1:42:51] of the
[1:42:52] story oh my the church world she wasn't
[1:42:56] true to him she she's still married to
[1:42:58] her first nature she's doing the works
[1:43:00] in herself without Christ because she
[1:43:02] put Christ outside of the church she's
[1:43:04] doing her own programs her own things
[1:43:06] her boasting her own accomplishments but
[1:43:09] not the bride she boasts on him
[1:43:12] alone she's bringing forth children
[1:43:15] because in her not the bride the the
[1:43:17] church world is bringing forth some sort
[1:43:18] of children she's pregnated with
[1:43:20] something she's bringing forth church
[1:43:21] members but why are they they're
[1:43:23] illegitimate why because she's living in
[1:43:25] adultery to the word of God he says
[1:43:28] illegitimate to what not to the church
[1:43:29] but to the word she's illegitimate it's
[1:43:32] a picture of Revelation three the last
[1:43:33] day they ought to see a church age a
[1:43:35] little what an illegitimate group
[1:43:38] denominational mixup work lukewarm carry
[1:43:40] on call themselves Christians and not
[1:43:42] the word of God having a form of godlin
[1:43:44] but denying the power thereof as the
[1:43:46] prophet said they would
[1:43:48] be okay she wants want to be married to
[1:43:51] her first husband and look at her nature
[1:43:53] she loves the world she says she's
[1:43:55] married to Christ but her her Works
[1:43:57] prove she's married to something else
[1:44:00] Satan it's strong but it's true the
[1:44:04] first husband our first Nature by our
[1:44:06] first birth must be dead to receive the
[1:44:08] Holy Ghost you must die out to your old
[1:44:10] first nature you cannot carry it on and
[1:44:13] say I'm going to patch me up I'm going
[1:44:14] to be a better me that's nonsense it
[1:44:17] won't work it'll fail every time all
[1:44:20] right amen we are commissioned to bring
[1:44:22] forth children word born children of God
[1:44:25] it can only come forth by this messag
[1:44:27] amen that's why brother Sean preaches
[1:44:29] the message of God it don't bring in
[1:44:31] other stuff it won't bring forth word
[1:44:34] birth might bring forth church members
[1:44:36] but it'll bring forth a lot of
[1:44:38] spirits but the word will bring forth
[1:44:41] the Holy Ghost every time thank you
[1:44:43] Jesus okay we can't hyb it brother
[1:44:46] brandom tells about women going into
[1:44:48] menopause at the age of 20 and 25 years
[1:44:50] old old why did he tell that he says
[1:44:53] that's what the church is also in its
[1:44:55] condition what did he say happened it
[1:44:57] was because of hybrid food was causing
[1:45:00] women not to be able to bring forth
[1:45:02] children hybrid food had done that in
[1:45:04] the natural so is it in the spiritual
[1:45:06] the Pentecostal hybrid the food if you
[1:45:08] try to hybrid this message you'll have
[1:45:10] dead church

[1:50:00] will practice birth control because
[1:50:01] they're worried about being deformed why
[1:50:03] did he say about that because the church
[1:50:05] she doesn't want to bring forth members
[1:50:07] Holy Ghost born members because it'll
[1:50:09] deform her standing with the
[1:50:11] organization it'll deform her culture
[1:50:14] classical ways it'll deform what she's
[1:50:16] made herself to be because she doesn't
[1:50:18] want to move of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:50:19] church
[1:50:21] woo she don't she won't look like she
[1:50:24] used

[1:50:28] look like she used to and when the
[1:50:30] church brings forth word born children
[1:50:32] of God they won't look like they used to
[1:50:35] either hallelujah oh I'm so glad I don't

[1:50:47] hit some highlights and I'm going try
[1:50:49] harder than ever to quit but she still
[1:50:52] got a mother something friends she's got
[1:50:55] a nature that she wants to Mother
[1:50:56] something that's why she brings in the
[1:50:59] programs in the church that's why she
[1:51:01] want she's got to do something to keep
[1:51:03] her busy to keep her occupied that's why
[1:51:04] a woman would take a dog in oh my that's
[1:51:08] my baby that's my granddog where's this
[1:51:11] nonsense from Friends Prophet God called
[1:51:13] that Tommy right
[1:51:16] out B she despise having children you
[1:51:19] have how many kids oh how do you stand
[1:51:22] it that's the spirit of the devil and
[1:51:25] people this day of this world that's the
[1:51:28] thought of the
[1:51:29] world you had a holy ghost meeting oh my
[1:51:33] everybody shouted wo I don't want none
[1:51:36] of that yeah they'll get religious about
[1:51:39] hating on that cuz they're full of the
[1:51:41] devil woo oh

[1:51:54] weeks all kinds of bears everywhere but
[1:51:56] if the old bear she doesn't have her cub
[1:51:58] what so there's an instinct in her she
[1:52:00] wants to Mother something she'll go back
[1:52:01] and hunt those ones up if their breeding
[1:52:03] didn't
[1:52:04] take okay she'll hunt them up all and
[1:52:08] then she it's her god-given instinct to
[1:52:09] Mother
[1:52:10] something okay then he says about the
[1:52:12] church
[1:52:14] here the the and the people the women of
[1:52:16] this Modern Age worldly women they don't
[1:52:19] want to have a baby for their husband
[1:52:21] but they'll take a cat or a dog they've
[1:52:22] got a mother something but to Bear a
[1:52:24] child for her husband to take it to the
[1:52:26] service of God is entirely out of
[1:52:28] line people shack up don't want to bring
[1:52:32] forth kids even people in church say
[1:52:34] well that's the too cruel of a world to
[1:52:35] bring for children nowadays that's the
[1:52:37] spirit of the devil friends God said be
[1:52:39] fruitful and multiply don't take that
[1:52:41] Tommy rod in the world's always been a
[1:52:44] horrible place ever since the Garden of
[1:52:46] Eden when the fall came and sin came in
[1:52:48] God's telling them to be fruit and
[1:52:50] multiply to bring forth replenish the
[1:52:52] Earth Noah he didn't say well it's just
[1:52:56] too bad we'll just hunker down and die
[1:52:57] until no that's nonsense that's of the
[1:53:00] devil all right that's free too because
[1:53:02] that wasn't really written down there in
[1:53:03] the
[1:53:04] notes okay but what it what happens to
[1:53:08] raise it to the surface of God is
[1:53:10] entirely out of line for these modern
[1:53:11] women so is it for the church today he
[1:53:14] says neither does a church want any of
[1:53:16] these hear screaming shouting tongue
[1:53:18] speaking Act 2 238 young around her she
[1:53:21] don't want any of them whooping or
[1:53:23] crying or Screaming amen hallelujah why
[1:53:27] it didn't immediately put her out of her
[1:53:28] denomination they had one like that in
[1:53:30] one of the churches they'd throw her out
[1:53:31] right quick why are you letting such
[1:53:34] stuff as this go along remember they
[1:53:36] said amen and and they all turned their
[1:53:37] necks like what was
[1:53:39] that oh well you see she's pregnated
[1:53:43] with something cuz she's bringing forth
[1:53:46] members all the time but she don't want
[1:53:47] none of them screaming hollering labin
[1:53:50] acts 238 miserable creatures that she
[1:53:52] thinks they are it would certainly
[1:53:53] embarrass her she's more concerned about
[1:53:57] her image to the public and how they can
[1:53:59] fly the rainbow Flags well they're going
[1:54:02] to burn with them if they're that's what
[1:54:05] Romans 1 says all those that tolerate
[1:54:07] with
[1:54:09] them that's not the exact words but
[1:54:11] those have pleasure in them that do
[1:54:13] them knowing the Judgment of God that
[1:54:16] they which commit such things are worthy
[1:54:18] of death not only to do the same but
[1:54:19] have pleasure in them that do them amen
[1:54:22] there's a church down here in blackburg
[1:54:24] they have rainbow Flags oh
[1:54:27] yeah it's ready for the burning it's the
[1:54:29] Church of Sodom might as well change her
[1:54:32] name and get Martin Luther's name off of
[1:54:33] there he didn't put up with that
[1:54:37] junk
[1:54:39] okay hey any of them welcome to come and
[1:54:42] get their heart right with God they can
[1:54:44] come as they are but they don't have to
[1:54:46] stay as they are they don't have to
[1:54:47] bring their perverted spirits and keep
[1:54:50] them and hang on to them and pervert
[1:54:52] your young kids and you watch who your
[1:54:54] kids hang out
[1:54:56] with there Spirits out there friends I
[1:54:59] don't care if they're religious they

[1:55:20] scientific
[1:55:21] Society they call evil good and they
[1:55:23] call good evil this world does their
[1:55:26] form of Ethics is tolerance for
[1:55:28] everybody except for
[1:55:30] Christians well and they couldn't have
[1:55:33] the Holy Ghost in there because it drive
[1:55:34] the Devils out the preachers would be
[1:55:36] fired the deacons would be fired the
[1:55:39] You' have an empty church there may be
[1:55:41] brother B said there be many blank
[1:55:42] sermons preaching up against the wall
[1:55:44] all right he said she don't want to be
[1:55:47] pregnated with the word because that's
[1:55:48] the only kind of the word that the word
[1:55:50] can bring forth all right not the
[1:55:53] scientific but the other you know he
[1:55:55] says you find what is the what you he
[1:55:57] said you don't find that in the word of
[1:55:59] God Church joining Creed going Bob Harry

[1:56:03] Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born
[1:56:05] of the spirit of God screaming hollering
[1:56:07] shouting praising God we can't leave off
[1:56:09] sanctification but we can't stop there
[1:56:11] either friends the Holy Ghost is if if
[1:56:14] you you say you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:56:15] and you're still Walling in the things
[1:56:17] of the world and you think you can

[1:56:20] you you missed the road stop
[1:56:22] friends oh my well that's too
[1:56:25] oldfashioned not for God cuz God's old
[1:56:27] fashioned oh the Holy Ghost filled stuff
[1:56:31] well it's for the children of God only
[1:56:33] the elect can be reborn only the seed of
[1:56:35] God can reborn because in the the
[1:56:36] non-elect there's nothing to Quicken all
[1:56:39] right what's what church World bring
[1:56:41] forth painted face short wear and
[1:56:42] Jezebel illegitimate
[1:56:44] cats all right watch her lover watch
[1:56:47] what she loves it show shows who she's

[1:56:53] that's her husband her fruits proves
[1:56:55] what she is her fruits proves what she
[1:56:57] is and their fruits prove what they are
[1:57:01] all right she claims to be born the
[1:57:03] second time to Christ but notice who her
[1:57:05] lover is Adam because she loves the
[1:57:07] world tell tell her it tells what their
[1:57:09] papa is whether it's first Adam or
[1:57:11] second Adam if the church brings forth
[1:57:12] the child of second Adam he asks the
[1:57:13] second Adam's way of acting like they
[1:57:15] did on the day of
[1:57:16] Pentecost their nature is like his and
[1:57:21] hers they told him that he said you say
[1:57:23] shut up on that so he had a rough way to
[1:57:25] go to preach that he had to preach lamb
[1:57:27] and the dove he said the message got
[1:57:29] through okay the denominational Creed
[1:57:32] Seekers Cain like were illegitimate to
[1:57:34] the word as Cain was

[1:57:42] nation following Jesus Christ the word
[1:57:44] to be in the bride you have to be
[1:57:46] remarried to the word of God which is a
[1:57:47] Christ as long as you're holding man's
[1:57:49] tradition of denominations you're called
[1:57:52] in God's word and adulterous now we've
[1:57:54] all come out from that he said come out
[1:57:56] over my people be not partakers of our
[1:57:58] sins all right I thank God that that
[1:58:00] he's called us out and that we walked
[1:58:02] out that's is what we've walked out from
[1:58:05] thank God why so we could re represent
[1:58:08] Jesus Christ to this dying world that's
[1:58:10] right the seed of God cannot be in him
[1:58:12] the same time the love of God and the
[1:58:14] love of the world is in there the seat
[1:58:16] of God is operating through you that's
[1:58:17] the word of God the love of the world
[1:58:18] can't be in there at the same time
[1:58:20] neither can you bear sons of God God's
[1:58:23] sons of his word to this illegitimate
[1:58:25] denominational group you cannot do it
[1:58:26] it's an incubator you canot bring forth
[1:58:28] a son word a word Son of God speaking to
[1:58:30] the church what they failed to keep the
[1:58:33] word they failed to have the
[1:58:35] Revelation he speaks of the adultery
[1:58:37] that happened there in the garden and he
[1:58:39] talks about the serpent seed and he says
