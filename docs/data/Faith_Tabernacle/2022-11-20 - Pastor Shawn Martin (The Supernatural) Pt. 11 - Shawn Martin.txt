just something that's beyond uh human ability amen and uh but how many is glad to be in the house of the Lord we're always glad to be in the house of the Lord to glorify him and to lift up his name

for his love we want to remember there be no service this coming Wednesday but we will be having prayer service Tuesday at 7 so anyone that would like to come and have prayer amen we would love to have you amen so just keep that in mind uh prayer service this Tuesday but no service Wednesday on Thanksgiving Eve amen before we go into the word let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer and ask the Lord to just be with us I know several are out today and some are sick some are out of town and we want to just keep them in our prayer father it is so gracious Lord and wonderful to to be in your presence and to know Lord that we have a part in your plan for this age Lord we're not just wandering aimlessly Lord through life that you called us with a high calling and father we're here to answer the call and we're so glad that you put it within our heart to answer father we're just it's just Grace that Lord we can submit to you and surrender Our Lives when so many are trying to save their life but Lord we have just surrendered to you trusting you and we ask that you would help us to surrender even more Lord any any part of the world that would be in us take it out of us Lord take every ounce of the world out of his father that you can have complete control and I pray father that you would just touch those that are sick this morning Lord that they would love to be here to worship you but just aren't feeling well and but Lord we know you as the great physician and whatever it would be that would uh that they're going through Lord I pray that you would touch them in a great way those that are out of town and would be coming back today I pray that you would just keep them on the highway keep them safe Lord is our prayer and father most of all bless the reading of your word Lord the ministering I pray that you had anoint not only me but the people father Lord may we be lifted up in Heavenly places in Christ we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says a man and a man um we we want to look at Ephesians 1 and the 21st verse we'll start there it says far above um Let's uh let's go down to the 20th he says which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and said to him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places speaking of Christ and far above he raised him far above uh all principality and power and might and Dominion in every name that is named not only in the this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body who's his body the church the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen you can have your seats this morning and we trust that something can be said to edify you in Christ and I'm continuing with the title the Supernatural and I'm sure there are are better titles um that that I could use for this subject but if the the church is the body of Christ then then the Supernatural is the main part of the church a man for we are a supernatural body the supernatural life flowing through us uh Supernatural Faith Supernatural love everything about God everything about the church is Supernatural and so we we find that uh wherever God is the supernatural takes place and so if the church is the body of of Christ then then that's where he resides and so uh she is a supernatural uh uh uh uh brighter self a supernatural church for uh we know that she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him in so much she is him in so much that she's been given the name Miss Jesus Christ and so today I'm not just talking to church members or just a a a uh just average people or just humans if you could say it that way we're looking in a higher uh order and that is I'm I believe I'm speaking to miss Jesus Christ amen and people that bear his name and uh you have been given your pardon you have been declared Justified and and so uh brother Branham would tell us you are standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it not by God though you were not accused of it by God you were accused of it by your accuser and we know Satan is the accuser of the Brethren and so he says but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God so you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become Flesh and Blood flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was can you say man so no wonder you could be uh Miss Jesus Christ for when you received the Holy Ghost uh brother Brown said your sex your your sexual blood was dismissed ain't that right in another place he says if you ever really come to God and got a taste of the Heavenly gifts of God partakers of his divine nature why you could know more become a sinner again aren't you glad for that you could no more be a sinner again an unbeliever than a stalk of corn could become a cocklebur ain't that right now the Bible uh speaks of Oneness a man and and this word Oneness I looked it up and it it's singleness a Unity same identity uh Union blending melting together amen now you know so many are trying to be one uh today with just anybody everybody we you know and it's it's becoming a generation an age of melting together and we all know that everything's uh it's a uniting time as the prophet would would preach and and so but the the Oneness that Jesus would pray for now the Oneness that Jesus prayed for was was that the one this like he and the father had amen that that type of Oneness and and remember uh there as in his prayer John 17 and 19 uh just break it in he said for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither I I pray I for these alone so he wasn't just praying for them chosen uh uh his disciples there but he was also he said but for them us also uh which Shall Believe on me through their word ain't that right he says that they all may be one as thou father and I uh or as thou father are in me and I in thee so look at that Oneness the father in him and him in the father that they also May maybe one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me ain't that right and the glory which thou gavest me I gave them that they may be one even as we are one oh my see so how do we have this Oneness brother Branham asked that question you know how does this Oneness work amen and and he says this he said the word in us would be the anointed word ain't that right amen talking of of of of this body of of being the fullness of Jesus Christ see it's not just Faith Tabernacle a man that that makes it the body amen but it's a bride that makes the body it's the Church of the Living God that that and and this is the church is is that church that has that Oneness with the father and Christ can you say man that are in the same Oneness as Christ had with the father and this is how that Oneness works the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God see the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you ain't that right amen see so so it's not just hearing the word behind the pulpit and said amen and filling a man a great having a great time in the church but when you leave these doors that word is in you amen when you go to school that word is in you when you go to when you go to work that word is in you when you go home the word is in you and that word is Anointed in you can you say Amen see that's the Oneness and then he says see the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you amen it's it's it's it's not just you reading the Bible and you apart from that but this word is now in you that's anointed as it was in God in Christ he says and then you become a son a messiah of the age ain't that right amen says so now only the predestinated will have this kind of Oneness that's right see for they uh uh are the ones who make up the body of Christ amen that's right and only those in the body of Christ are unified together in the Oneness that Jesus prayed for now we're not United with the World We Stand Alone can you say man we're we're not re you United a man with man's Creeds and dogmas we stand alone we're not United with the politics of this age We Stand Alone ain't that right we're not United with this world or the the church or organization see we're St We Stand Alone see we're not United with the make-believer or the Sinners amen We Stand Alone a man say it's it's not a Melting Pot a man where we just blend in with everything amen the Oneness is with the Father and Jesus Christ can you say amen that's that's where it is everything else we stand alone it's just like a Daniel a man in in Babylon there in in when he was in captivity a man he was only United with three other men Shadrach Meshach and Bendigo ain't that right amen there was other Jews there millions of Jews a man in the same captivity in the same country in Babylon but Daniel was only United with three other people and and the prophet would tell us that they were Overcomers they were the only Overcomers in that age amen and see a man out of the millions of people a man that we're living on the earth in Noah's day he was United a man with only seven of them amen and the prophet said they were the Overcomers of that day for they were found in the ark if safety ain't that right a man see and out of the two and a half million people Amen in the time of Moses amen yet there was only two a man that Moses was United with and that was Joshua and Caleb amen see they were the Overcomers for that age ain't that right see so there is a Oneness a man for they believe the message of the hour amen now notice Matthew 7 and 13 uh uh Jesus said enter ye in at the Straight Gate for white is the gate broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many everybody say many many there be which go in their hat because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which lead us unto life and few there be that find it so see this body of Believers now that few is the one that makes up the Church of the Living God and that few are united together they're not United with the many amen that that goes the broad way but they're United with that few a man that that Lit that uh goes the narrow way which leads unto life ain't that right that few uh they are the ones that are predestinated but I'm going to tell you something that few are the ones that has the supernatural working with the in them amen that few is the one that's walking with God that's connected with God Amen see so the Oneness that Jesus prayed for is fulfilled in this day do you believe that for he said father make them one even as you and I are one see thou father and me and I in you but notice now there is a day that that would be added there would be an element that would be added and it would be this day John 14 20. Jesus said at that day now the prophet said this day you shall know that I am in the father you and me and I in you can you say Amen so that makes up the Oneness it's not only amen the father in me and me and the father amen Jesus speaking but now we can say in this age amen that we are in the Father the father in us we are in Christ Christ in us can you say Amen it's a Oneness ain't that right so we find that the Church of the Living God is the veil of God God as we've been talking a man is the veil Jesus was the veil of God Amen uh uh they they they they they they they wanted to see God the Greek men wanted to see God Amen but when they saw they just saw a man they saw a veil a man of a man ain't that right well the church is the veil of God today it's it's not hypothetical speaking amen but it's a literal thing you are the veil of God for this age amen I'm glad for that can you say man amen the supernatural so you're not you're not as a helpless human being amen you can't overcome you can Prevail you you can make it can you say man I don't care how hot the trial gets I don't care how bad the night and the dark the night is you can make it because the god that is in you is greater amen than the world he's greater than the trial he's greater than your problem he's greater if you just quit looking at your problem and look unto him can you say amen and you'll find a man that is in you for you're the body so the Church of the Living God is the Tabernacle of God on Earth today so don't please don't imagine uh uh yourself looking at an object called The Church of the Living God and you're sitting there looking at it wondering put yourself there you are the church if I say I am the church see if you're baptized into the body by one Spirit right we're all baptized into one body not separate one spirit puts us in one body ain't that right so there there there you find even the Apostle Paul makes it personal To Us by saying it is Christ in you the hope of glory ain't that right not Christ somewheres and we're trying to find it look in the mirror and find Christ in you it's Christ in you can you say man look at ourself it's Christ amen that's right see amen if we can get past that human element quit looking at that human element quit looking at our limitations and look to the Christ that's in US that's right now notice it's a mystery Paul says it's a mystery this mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory and and and and this mystery God is kept to himself all these all this time it's been hidden ain't that right but he has made it known in this age which would fulfill what Jesus said at that day you shall know that I'm in the father I in you and you and me ain't that right you shall know why because he's made it known amen now the prophet would tell us in him in God with thoughts he wanted to become material and what did he do then he spoke a word and the Word was materialized God wanted to become material he said that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong it's Elohim God materializing so that he can be touched ain't that right feel he said then in the Millennium there's Elohim sitting on the throne that's right with all of his subjects around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world so the whole thing is God becoming flesh now you know someone that asked brother Brown and said well how how can God become flesh how can he be made flesh and brother Brown's reply was the same as he was in Jesus Christ he was made flesh when he was in Melchizedek he was made flesh and now he is here among us today May flesh in his church certainly see it's Elohim see so God becoming flesh ain't that right in this day now you think of that in this day we can look back and and and get the idea of what God was in Jesus Christ when he was made flesh in that body and the same Works Jesus said that he did we would do in this age even greater God same God made flesh in humanity I think that's powerful now we know that there are three offices of God that is Father Son and Holy Ghost it's not three separate persons in one God as they they want to tell us but it's three offices of the one true God and God did not operate in all these offices at the same time ain't that right but brother random would teach us that that there was a space of time that God worked in each office so so as there was a space of time that God worked as uh in the office as father amen and that's how he was manifested and brother Bradham would call that space of time the disposition of fatherhood ain't that right then when that dispensation or that space of time ended then it would start another space of time a period of time which would be called the dispensation of the son that God would work in the office as son can you say amen that's right and that's how he was manifested then came the dispensation of the Holy Ghost which is the third office that God works in see it's the threefold being of God ain't that right brother Brown said this is why we were commissioned to baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost because it's the same God in fatherhood sonship and holy ghost or Holy Spirit dispensation ain't that right yes sir and the name of the father is Jesus Christ ain't that right so three dispensations three unfoldings three workings of the same God Amen God the father was the word God the son was the word God the Holy Ghost is the word can you say amen amen you can never separate the word from God ain't that right so every office each three offices that God worked in it was the word the word the word in different offices can you say man so we find that in the Old Testament we see where God represented himself once in fullness everybody say in fullness he represented himself uh there in the Old Testament once in fullness in the order of Melchizedek as father ain't that right we know that Melchizedek was not a priesthood ain't that right but he was a man a person flesh amen God revealed himself the prophet said in fullness as a man oh my see so we know it was God that appeared to him Amen to Abraham amen for the Bible called him king of righteousness king of Salem which means peace ain't that right so king of Peace amen Paul said he had no father he had no mother ain't that right he he wasn't a descendant of some family tree amen it was God Elohim the self-existent one amen he had no beginning of days nor ending of life amen see so he is the same yesterday today and forever amen and he was called Melchizedek the father amen so brother Branham said see he wasn't the Son of God he was the god of the son he wasn't the Son of God Melchizedek wasn't but he was the father of the Son of God see Jesus had a father and mother Jesus had a time when he started and yet this man Melchizedek didn't ain't that right no beginning of days or ending of Life see Jesus gave his life but this man couldn't give his life for he was life Jesus had to be born in flesh to take away the the Stinger of death but we find the body of Melchizedek was a created body a word body can you say man amen God was manifested in human flesh now you just think of that because again God wants to become material that was his thoughts can you say Amen yes sir he said see now that was a body that he just pulled the calcium and potash out of the earth and and blue you know and stepped into it that was the same thing Melchizedek was he stepped into him in a body that he could walk out before him or Abraham under the veil of his own creation not a veil of the creation of woman through the womb of a woman through a cell never but this but he created this and stepped out into it and talked in order uh in the order of Melchizedek ain't that right now notice when he come into that fullness a man and represented himself in fullness as Melchizedek he appeared to Abraham as son of man ain't that right that's well that's what the prophet said he said he God appeared to Abraham in the form of a son of man Elohim Jehovah and he performed a sign to Abraham and Abraham was the elect ain't that right Abraham was the chosen the elect the predestinated of God and there was God in human flesh performing a sign unto Abraham now think of that he said see the prophet said God made flesh among them stood with his back turned to the tent young people when you hear Brother Branham sipping you know turning his back to to the audience and begin to discern amen think of that the very thing that God did Back to Abraham same God my so God made flesh among them stood with his back turned to the tent and told Sarah what she was thinking about told Abraham what Sarah was thinking about and doing in the tent ain't that right he says now notice this is important the last sign they got was the manifestation of God in flesh could read the heart of a woman behind him in the tent this last sign amen that Abraham and Sarah got before the son came amen was God in flesh standing right before them performing that Messiah sign ain't that right and brother Brown said that sign was fully manifested to Abraham what was it it was God as father working in the office amen now he says see so we we find a man that that same sign a man would be performed a man in the sonship dispensation ain't that right and Not only would it be performed in the sonship disposition but it would be fulfilled in the Holy Ghost dispensation as well God wouldn't be manifested in his fullness then we see that God was manifested Amen in the fullness of his son ain't that right and all that God was Jesus Christ was everything that God was was dumped or poured into that human body amen the prophet said see God lived the God the Father lived in the sun which made him God the son can you say amen that's right see but it wasn't a created body amen as the body of Melchizedek amen this was a a born body can you say man a word born body that was created in the womb of Mary but notice Paul said it was God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself ain't that right God in the dispensation as son amen see Jesus constantly called himself what son of man constantly calling himself son of man amen and he was the express image that's what Paul would tell us he was the express image of God ain't that right it's the seed of God manifested the prophet said trying to draw the people to him amen Jesus also said he that has seen me has seen the father ain't that right they asked him they they asked you show me the father and he said have I been so long with you and you still don't know me he that has seen me has seen the father that's right Paul also would tell us that him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily ain't that right so again it was the fullness of God in his son same God that was in the body of Melchizedek was now in his son Jesus Christ was on man and he was all God ain't that right brother Branham says of all the human emotions that Jesus manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often Jesus cried a lot as son of man in that human body he cried a lot yet behind that weeping and that sorrow there was still God oh God that's amazing oh God wanted to become material God wanted to know what it was to cry come on church now he want to know what you go through and one of the the the things that the most emotions that he did he wept a lot God weeping in human skin God's suffering in human skin God feeling the pain in human skin ain't that right God being tempted in human skin the prophet said he even had sexual Temptations in human skin great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh ain't that right and the same sign that God performed as father in the body of Melchizedek was performed in the body of the Son of God Jesus Christ so we see God the Father and now God the son oh my God old is all right he was the son Prophet said he was the son when he used the sonship office see the same God working in two different offices yet performing the same sign showing that it was him ain't that right now the prophet would tell us God veiled in Jesus to do the work of redemption at the cross God could not die as a spirit he's eternal but he had to put on a mask and act apart of death he did die but he couldn't do it in his God form ain't that right and he couldn't do it in the body of Melchizedek that had no beginning or no ending can you say man he revealed himself as father see but in the sun form he could die he had to do it in some form as son of man on Earth he said notice God became material in a man called Jesus Christ which was his son this son gave his life that he might bring other Sons aren't you glad for that he wasn't a selfish individual a man but God was manifested in that human body that he could die to bring forth other Sons or you wouldn't be sick like you are today he said that God might become tangible this son gave his life that he might bring forth other sons that God might become tangible working all in all so God wasn't just satisfied with being in human flesh in the form of Melchizedek God wasn't just satisfied being in the working in the office and becoming tangible in his the body of his son God was looking to become tangible in this age that we're living in in you amen I've read this before in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily now think of that in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily wherein there in there we are Sons and Daughters of God are sons of daughters to God in God's godhead Hallelujah well we can see we we can see the offices of God in the father God as the son but what what what does it mean to have the Holy Ghost well brother Brown's telling you you're part of that godhead for this age and you say Amen see yes as Sons and Daughters were in the family if you're in there and where in the godhead in him and you say man that's right you were in Christ and Paul says it was the godhead that was in Christ the fullness of God dwelt bodily in him and you say Amen that's right see so I I know I I know the devil don't like us talking like that but it's true and and we we read it where Jesus said the glory that I that you gave me I now have given them that they may be one as I am one can you say amen amen don't look at yourself for some little insignificant amen human being amen don't look at yourself as just somebody that is just a uh uh you don't know if you're going to make it or not you can make it you will make it for you are part of God as I've told you before Jesus Christ now think of it thoughts God had thoughts that he wanted to become tangible so Jesus Christ was predestinated to be work that office of son God says I'm going to choose Jesus Christ that body and he'll come on a certain time be born the way he was and I will work my office in him a son ain't that right but at that same time brother Brown said you were just as predestinated as Jesus was not for that day but this day can you say amen for God wanted to become dead become tangible in this age and when he thought of himself becoming tangible in this age you appeared well that should make you excited that that just ain't that ain't just getting you hyped up that's truth that's truth God sent a prophet to tell us who we are in Christ Jesus so today God is manifesting himself in fullness in his church you believe that and so if he's manifesting himself he manifested himself only twice in fullness in fullness he manifested himself in fullness in the body of Melchizedek he manifested himself in fullness in the body of Jesus Christ but today he manifests himself in fullness for the third time in this age and that's where you and I fit in now notice brother Brown said there is the body of Christ Living standing redeemed redeemed he says he repeats it oh my God justified in his sight why are we Justified we are his victory we are the consummation if if that would be the right word the finale of his thoughts the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory can you say Amen he wanted to become tangible in a body and yet a bunch of sinners nobodies unworthy without hope Hellbound under the possession of the devil slaves to sin and yet God says them are the people I want to live in them are the people that I want to be my hands I want to be my mouth I want to be my feet you look at the angels and Angels maybe if you just let's just think of it maybe the angel says but look at them they're worthless look look at the darkness that overshadows them they're drunks they're prostitutes they're no good they're Liars and yet God would say but I predestinated them to be conformed in my image and we already know that his word once it is sent it will not return unto him void but it shall accomplish that which he sent it to do so God would make the way he would work in the office of his son to die for you oh yeah it doesn't take away our Humanity we all have our faults we all have our failures but you know what he did do he took away the desire he took away our desire to be sinners took our desire away to want to drink and to lust and all that he takes all that away so then brother Brown would say yeah sure you're going to have mistakes sure you're going to fall but it's not sin yet now I know people take that and run with it I don't care about that I'm talking to predestinated people he said it's not sin yet he said for the moment you see that you're wrong you'll repent of it right then well praise God oh yeah God made a way that he could live in you and you say man now so he says see he said shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither then can they keep us see we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denomination Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever that right now if he couldn't manifest himself full in his fullness in the church then he couldn't show himself to be the same yesterday today and forever now notice the prophet said he was manifested in the fatherhood he was manifested in the sonship he's manifested now in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit ain't that right so what is it God is now manifested in his fullness in his church his bride today I'm going to repeat these things and hopefully to get it to you God represented himself in fullness in the body of Melchizedek as son of man right and God is the word now that's what the prophet says he was the word he he was son of man to Abraham the complete fullness of God was in the body of Jesus Christ son of man now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church and Paul says the church is his body which is the fullness of him and you say Amen so it's God the Holy Ghost inflation as son of man in this age can you say Amen God the fullness Luke 17 29 we know it very well but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now notice how the prophet always puts it he always puts it there everybody looks at Noah the the world looks at Lord the days of lot as as homosexuals as this is that and this and they fail to miss the important thing while that was be just before it fell the son of man God was revealing himself in human flesh and that's what the prophet was getting at and John that's what this scripture is the same God that would manifest himself back there in human flesh is doing it again today amen so God the father in a word body reveal this son of man God the son in a created body born word born body reveal this son of man now God the holy ghost in a redeemed body revealed as son of man can you say Amen see the prophet said he's God the Father sure he was in the beginning he's God the son that was made Flesh on Earth he's God the Holy Ghost which is in me but it's the same God God Alone working in three offices I hope you understand where I'm getting at see another place the one God made himself three offices three manifestations oh don't sell yourself short that's right and notice three offices three manifestations one sign being performed in each office and you say man now Prophet said Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man that same God would appear in the flesh of his church and would show the same sign another place Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man that God would manifest himself in human flesh his church the body of Christ and would do the same sign now we know that Jesus performed the same sign to the Jew and Samaritan but the prophet said he never did it to the Gentiles ain't that right so he promised that the same sign would be performed to the Gentiles aren't you glad we've recognized that sign and just as as it quickened the seed to that Samaritan woman remember she was a prostitute but when that sign was done quickly she recognized him as the Messiah and he said quickly her sins were forgiven her Hallelujah I'm so glad I'm a Believer I'm so glad that I can believe the sign that God has done in this age it does something for you can you say amen for the Pharisee the Pharisee that that that priest he saw the sign and called it the devil and went to hell for it but here was a lonely lady that needed help that needed Grace that needed salvation she was an elect she was predestinated and when Jesus performed that sign to her she recognized it believed it and quickly her sins were forgivener oh my you love him now notice brother Branham said now we've had 2 000 years that's never been in the church now I'm going to get somewheres in just a moment now I want you to listen to me and we'll close here in in shortly Lord Willie but brother Brown said now this sign we've had 2 000 years and this sign has never been in the church but it shall be light in the evening time the prophet said there will be a day that it won't be neither uh called night and or day but in the evening time it shall be light so keep in mind that sign has never been in the church all these two thousand years never been in the church brother Branham in another place said we believe Jesus Christ has raised from the dead and is making himself known down through the aid Church age as what Son of God everybody say ask Son of God and now fulfilling his promise in the last day to reveal himself to Abraham's roll seed as son of man right right now my desire is for us to see where the body of Christ stands today there are some who see no different and where the church is today from that of the first church in the book of Acts but there is a difference there there is a difference between the church today and the church the first church of the book of Acts and yet it's the same there is no difference so there is and there isn't right now Matthew first of all Matthew 16 and 16 Jesus says that he was going to build his church right said Upon This Rock which we know to be the revelation of Jesus Christ of what he was and who he is upon that rock Jesus said I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it we also know if you want to go back and listen to the masterpiece 64. I I would encourage you to do so but brother Branham called this church a masterpiece but notice what he said not just a masterpiece another Masterpiece another Jesus was the first masterpiece ain't that right Jesus being the first masterpiece and the prophet said in that first Masterpiece he was the Fulfillment of everything that God promised ain't that right another place in in that message Masterpiece all Promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ speaking of that first Masterpiece it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met in any of the prophets but it was met in the Masterpiece it masked all that it said it was going to be oh my he matched it ain't that right in Genesis God told the serpent that the woman's feet shall bruise his head and that he the serpent shall bruise his head or his heel Jesus matched that prophecy for he was the woman's seed brother Brown said see God couldn't bruise that Serpent's head with the law he couldn't bruise it with the prophets but he done it in Jesus Christ ain't that right his life matched Moses's life his life matched David's life his life matched Joseph's life his life matched Elijah's life his man's life the life of uh of of Isaac's life ain't that right everything foretold by him in the Old Testament matched right into that showing a perfect Redeemer masterpiece what was it the word became flesh son of man now notice what he says now so will the church because now the church is the Masterpiece he called The Church a masterpiece so will the church have to be a match to everything God has promised oh my that ought to make us excited don't sell yourself short Satan can't take your life until your life becomes a perfect match praise the Lord hallelujah hello Church if you if you've been born again you've got the Holy Ghost down inside of you you have only it's only baptized you into that body of Jesus Christ and you're living in the age of a finale you're living in the age when the Masterpiece becomes the Masterpiece the church becomes the masterpiece now notice the prophet said as it taken him four thousand years to make this masterpiece speaking of Jesus Christ now he's been for nearly 2 000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece right so look where you're at today masterpiece right Masterpiece now see in when brother Brown talks about Michelangelo making that image of Moses in the Masterpiece but you know it was not a masterpiece when he was when he picked up that rock and put it on that ground or or when he dropped the Rock and put it in his garage or wherever he was that wasn't the Masterpiece he started shaping and and the first hour didn't make a masterpiece he spent day after day after day and yet it wasn't a masterpiece yet foreign but when when he he looked he stepped back one day and he looked at it and what he had in his mind was standing there before him and he got so inspired by it he lost his senses and he took that hammer and he struck and said speak why he said that's the masterpiece oh my God foreign what he saw reflected in his thoughts was right there standing before him can you say Amen so see the masterpieces today 2 000 years he's been making this masterpiece my I'm so glad to be part of this age oh it would have been nice to be in Paul's age it would have been nice to be on the days of Acts it but but oh my amen what a greater age that we're living in today that we can stand here and say we are that Masterpiece we are the finishing touch so we find he says see in so doing it in building this masterpiece he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece his word see that's the way he makes his masterpieces because he can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's the perfect word can you say man now notice when his Masterpiece was perfected Christ then he had to Smite it to take from him another Peace not another creation but of the same creation foreign so we know that it fulfills the type of Adam and Eve ain't that right he created Adam and he took out of out of Adam Eve oh my God so see so and she was Adam that's right she was Adam in feminine form flesh of his flesh bone of his bone so much that her name was Adam until after the fall then she was Eve but her name was Adam ain't that right she was Adam in feminine form now the prophet says then if he was the word the Masterpiece I brought groom if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word ain't that right so the church the bride is going to be a perfect match praise the Lord I think that you ought to put that in your Arsenal to the devil you can try me you can whatever you want to do but I'm a perfect match now brother Brown said see he fulfilled the Old Testament talking about the first Masterpiece now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled and see the new and old is the husband and wife and it taken the new see the old foreshow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament see another Masterpiece is in making now we know that that church started was birthed on the day of Pentecost ain't that right and and I'll tell you it's the only time that it was birthed the only time it was not birth on Azusa Street it was birth on the day of Pentecost it didn't eat another birth this church was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost ain't that right so now we're we're not sitting here looking back at that church and looking at this present church as though they're different from one another no no they're the same thing they're the same part ain't that right amen the church today is the one that was birthed on the day of Pentecost so now notice what that first church was he and brother Brown said he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word see started in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifested the promise that had been given Joel said it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old uh your old man shall dream dreams or young men shall see Vision see what he would do in the last days the last two thousand years ain't that right so the church was birthed under a prophecy by a prophecy being fulfilled it was not birthed upon a man's ideology it was not birthed by a preacher it was birthed by the spirit of God and he started that church Upon A promise now brother Brown said God planted a holy ghost seed on the day of Pentecost and he called it that little seed of Pentecost the seed is the church so I'm going to just read some quotes here I hope that's all right but he said at the beginning it was Pentecost not an organization but a Pentecostal experience that brought the seed of God down by the Holy Ghost Maiden men and women speak in tongues and stagger like drunk men Spirit operating in the church showing signs and wonders another place he said see the grain that seed was planted at Pentecost he says in another place it started out as the original you know what that means then that is the pattern for us today it's the pattern you love him Jesus said that the word of God is a seed that the sower went and sowed and the word is the seed ain't that right he was the sower so that seed at the day of Pentecost God planted it had perfect life in it right brother Brandon speaking of this Bright Tree the church said when that tree started off it was a Pentecostal tree people are scared of that word Pentecostal nonsense don't don't get quiet on me Church you've got to be identified with Pentecost when we first come into the message we were labeled Pentecostal Pentecostal why we're too excitable we believed in speaking in tongues still do believed in dancing still do believed in shouting and we still do but they labeled it Pentecost but now after I begin to reading what brother Bradham says and and I've seen clearly I'm proud to be Pentecostal I'm proud that people would identify me as a Pentecost because the church started as a Pentecostal Church can you say man brother Brown said the real genuine article of God was Pentecost Pentecost is not only for Azusa they made a shame of Pentecost that Pentecostal age is just an age but the real genuine article of God at the day of Pentecost was Pentecost he says was is and always will be that's where the church began right here with Pentecostal power in another place he says because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge the by that standard judge your life by that standard judge this church by that standard the moment we stop seeing Miracles and not believing in these things it's the moment we ought to see that we're lost yes yes sir judged by the standards and you say Amen oh you can you can amen it's profit Prophet saying it Church don't be scared don't let your denominator don't let the denominational teachings around this message scare you it's okay to be a Pentecostal identified as a Pentecostal church it's okay to dance it's okay to shout it's okay where it's not okay is where you get formal dried up and just sitting there without an experience don't lick some some backslidden preacher some backslidden teacher some backslidden whatever tell you that you can't dance and take the joy away take your shouting away take the move of God away they can say well that's fanaticism hogwash there is fanaticism in anything but there's a genuine article now look now he says then judge that by stand by that standard that is how it is done the true church everybody say the true church will always say We'll always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and The Messengers to the church having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who is free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would can you say Amen so he says you have to work from the original as life begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age he said it's always been a Pentecostal Church can you say man here in this other quote brother Brown said if the first Vine that come out of Jesus Christ produced a Pentecostal Church filled with the Holy Ghost in power the second Branch will do the same thing the third branch will be another every Branch it puts forth will be that same kind of branch another one says that the first Vine brought forth the Pentecostal Church the second Vine uh uh rather out of the vine will bring forth another Pentecostal church with the Pentecostal experience bearing the same fruits that the first church had ain't that right another one if the first church that come out of that vine was a Pentecostal church that wrote a book of Acts behind it the second Church comes out we'll do the same thing and the Third Church see every church that rises out of that vine and Jesus said I'm the vine you're the branch so every church that comes out of that vine as a branch unto the Lord will be a Pentecostal church with the same signs and wonders that the first fine producer the first Branch produced it'll be like Pentecost see every church that rises out of that vine will be a Pentecostal Church foreign what was it on the day of Pentecost Prophet said the people were rejoicing they were happy they were shouting ain't that right amen he said the first church shouted and carried on he said it was the shout of the king that was in the camp and you say man they spoke in tongues how many believes in speaking in tongues brother Brown said you get deep enough you will speak in tongues you get deep enough in the Holy Ghost you will speak in tongues hello see so he said see they shouted they spoke in tongues they they danced they they Rejoice they prayed for the sick they've done Miracles and so forth they were so perfectly in harmony with God another place when the sun began to raise back on there on the first church they had signs and wonders and the very same things that Jesus of Nazareth did they did also it was a word seed believe it it was a word seed so they had to do it that's right see so so I want to say it this way they're shouting they're carrying on they're dancing they're speaking in tongues they're dreams their Visions it was not based on some sensation it was based on the word yes there are people that danced on based off Sensations but a church that first church was based on the word of God ain't that right so if the church will do these things a man in seed form then what will it do today in a ripened form yes sir the word produced it you're not out of line when you're worshiping God you're not out of line when you're praising God and you're glorifying God Abraham said I've never seen anyone out of line yet when they're worshiping God hello they might be out of line talking to one another while church is going on they might be out of line jumping up and prophesying while the preaching is going on but never was they out of line when they're worshiping God foreign I like it you got that that video uh what is it deep calleth undo the Deep and you hear them women just glorifying God and brother Brown's talking here and you hear him screaming and hollering and the video goes the camera goes to them and you see that colored woman two of them I think and brother Brown just turns around says well God bless you colored people rejoicing and pray they didn't stop him he didn't condemn them he said God bless you why God loves worship and brother Brown said this is the time for King Glam worship if they can worship God In seed form if they can have the power of God In seed form what shall we do in a in a ripened Church can you say Amen you say well we're matured out of that nonsense you might be matured out to where you just got left the word amen gets so mature to where you leave the word and you go off to what Dr so-and-so says and this old dead dried up theologians says and that one that ain't got no experience they're behind the pulpit that's why brother Brown said every Minister that stands behind this Pulpit needs a back inside of the desert first get an experience with God know that you got something down inside of you can you say Amen that way you won't discourage people from dancing you won't discourage the people from rejoicing and claiming their Victory he'll stay and wave the promises over them can you say amen that's right I I know brother Brad well brother random even says I'd rather have too much Wildfire than no fire at all ain't that right so now notice you know if you've had a word birth you know you you hear us talk about word birth need a word birth well we didn't know about a word until brother Brown talked about word birth so you got to have a word birth ain't that right but you know what you're not out of line when you're praising God dancing excited about the things of God and if you have a word birth you will be a part of that I'm not saying you'll dance I'm not saying but there will be an excitement about the word can you say man you might speak in tongues you might not you may prophesy you may not you you may but but one thing about it God will have complete control in your life can you say amen that's right see now now notice what the prophet said in in uh uh invisible Union of the Bride he said see he said the modern Church doesn't want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking Acts 2 38 youngins around here I just heard a man speaking on adoption teaching on adoption doing a teaching on adoption and left out every gift that we don't need the gifts anymore in the church I thought man you got your adoption all messed up go back and listen to the prophet right if we're like the first Branch tell me when God took the gifts out if if we're like the Original Seed tell me when God takes all this stuff out you go listen to the what restoration of the Bride yeah restoration bride you'll find out it was the devil that took it out the devil took out brotherly love the devil took out the gifts the devil took out Fellowship the devil took out rejoicing and shouting the devil took out the life the devil took all these doctrines away the devil messed us up can you say Amen the devil took our freedoms away but God promised I'll restore saith the Lord and we are a product of that restoration aren't you glad for that so here the modern Church doesn't want any of these here screaming shouting tongues speak in Acts 2 38 youngins around her she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbing to Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth ain't that right so that's what they had in the first church because it was the word seed or seed word so we we find that you cannot have that kind of a birth word birth without the spirit of God ain't that right yes sir brother Brown said you are born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it now I'm going to close amen but notice see what you will do amen uh in the word of God brother Brandon said what you will find Amen in the word of God because see they want women cutting their hair they want the makeup they're now they're allowing the homosexuals transgenders and and all of these things see they and and wrote Brown said you won't find that in the word you you just don't find that stuff he says what you will find in the word is an old-fashioned Sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting and praising God another place he said shouting religion is the oldest religion in the world it's even older than the Earth shouting religion can you say Amen for we find out in Job that even the sons of God shouted for Joy before the foundation of the world ain't that right and notice how brother Branham he asked this question how do we know that that wasn't that at the same time that the lamb was slain and that when God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus Christ my think of that the sons of God shouting where was it in the mind of God thank you he said how do you know it wasn't us shouting when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and we were rejoicing because of our Liberty and here you are now not in the mind of God but now you're manifested on Earth amen singing praises unto God Hallelujah do you love him oh isn't he wonderful so this is what the first church had because it was a word seed now brother Brown speaking of them first that first church he said I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us went around probably meant a few words until they got in the Pulpit they walked in and they done what was they were supposed to do and walked out they had power they advert you they had known arguments with men they know where they stood that's all they know who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit he said you know he said just as I said the other night one little nod that's all God had to do then nothing going to stop them they didn't question and study and and hum Hall and worry like we do whether they should do this or that they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nod from God that done it just as soon why how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues all these qualifications can you say amen amen that's right see so there was brotherly love in that first church for Paul said let Brotherly Love continue ain't that right the life that was in Jesus Christ was in the first church Church they did not walk by sight they walked by faith can you say amen and they believed what God Said was the truth that was the first church that's what was in seed form that God inaugurated on the day of Pentecost amen it was the first church a man that went forth performing the same kind of signs that Jesus did because God was with them working with them confirming the word with signs following Brother Brown said they had Faith to heal the sick cast out devils and do miracles yet so they had all these things but yet the Holy Ghost did not come in its full manifestation it was in seed hello it did not come in its full manifestation it did not come into its full strength it did not produce the manifestation of sons of God it did not reveal the son of man can you say Amen all the promises of God were not fulfilled in that first church wow they had the perfect life there but all the promises was not fulfilled and I have to say it even it's contrary to maybe what some are teaching they could not go in that rapture because it was not Harvest seed it was not Harvest Time and you say man the potential was there as we can see what they had in the book of Acts but anything the prophet said anything potential is not the real thing yet that word I looked it up potential is something that can develop or become actual so the potential was laying there in seed ain't that right but notice the seed had to die ain't that right is that not what the church ages are about the seed had to die oh my yes sir that seed was in its beginning stages so it couldn't have been in the Harvest in that stage because it wasn't ripened ain't that right they had the potential to be raptured they had the potential to have a body change they had the potential for all these things but it was not Harvest Time John 12 24 verily verily I say unto you except the corner wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit ain't that right so any seat the
