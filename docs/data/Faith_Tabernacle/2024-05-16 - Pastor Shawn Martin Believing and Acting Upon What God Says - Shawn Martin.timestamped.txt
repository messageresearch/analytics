[38:37] of the Lord he stood by the lake of uh
[38:41] guinet I believe that's how you'd say
[38:43] that and saw two ships standing by the
[38:46] lake but the fishermen were gone out of
[38:49] them and were washing their Nets and he
[38:53] entered into one of the ships which was
[38:55] Simon's and prayed him him that he would
[38:58] Thrust out a little from the land and he
[39:00] sat down and taught the people out of
[39:02] the ship now when he had left speaking
[39:05] he said unto Simon launch out into the
[39:08] deep and let down your nets for a
[39:11] drought and Simon answering said unto
[39:15] him Master we have told all night and
[39:18] have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy
[39:22] word I will let down the net and when
[39:27] they had done this they enclosed a great
[39:30] multitude of fishes and their net break
[39:34] amen we uh if you would like to turn to
[39:38] the Book of
[39:39] John St John the 11th
[39:44] chapter praise the
[39:54] Lord St John chap 11
[39:58] and read a few verses here now a certain
[40:01] man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany
[40:05] the town of Mary and her sister
[40:08] Martha it was that Mary which anointed
[40:11] the Lord with wantman and wiped his feet
[40:14] with her hair whose brother Lazarus was
[40:17] sick therefore his sister sent unto him
[40:20] saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest
[40:23] is sick when Jesus heard that he said
[40:26] this sickness is not unto death but for
[40:29] the glory of God that the Son of God
[40:31] might be glorified
[40:35] thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her
[40:39] sister and
[40:42] Lazarus then we go uh let's see we're go
[40:45] on down further when he had heard
[40:47] therefore that he was sick he Abode two
[40:50] days still in the same place where he
[40:53] was then after that he saith uh saith to
[40:57] his disciples let us go into Judea again
[41:01] his disciples say unto him Master the
[41:03] Jews of late sought to Stone thee and
[41:06] goest thou thither again and Jesus
[41:08] answered are there not 12 hours in the
[41:10] day if any man walk in the day he
[41:13] stumbleth not because he seeth the light
[41:15] of this world but if a man walk in the
[41:18] night he stumbleth because there is no
[41:20] light in him these things said he and
[41:24] after that he saith unto them our friend
[41:27] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[41:30] out of sleep then said his disciples
[41:33] Lord if he sleep he doeth he shall do
[41:35] well how be it Jesus spake of his death
[41:38] but they thought that he had spoken of
[41:42] uh taking of rest in sleep then said
[41:46] Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead
[41:49] and I'm glad for your sakes that I was
[41:52] not there to the intent you may believe
[41:55] nevertheless let us go unto
[41:58] him then said Thomas which is called
[42:02] dimus unto his fellow disciples let us
[42:06] go also that we may die with him then
[42:10] when Jesus came he found that he had
[42:13] laying in the grave 4 days already now
[42:16] Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15
[42:19] furlongs off and many of the Jews came
[42:23] to Martha and Mary to comfort them
[42:25] concerning the brother then Martha as
[42:28] soon as she heard that Jesus was coming
[42:30] went and met him but Mary sat still in
[42:33] the house then said Martha unto Jesus
[42:36] Lord if thou has us been here my brother
[42:38] had not died but I know that even now
[42:41] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[42:45] giveth thee amen then if you'd like to
[42:49] go down to the 38th
[42:52] verse they're standing here at the
[42:55] grave and
[42:58] we find it says Jesus therefore again
[43:01] groaning in himself cometh to the Grave
[43:04] it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
[43:08] Jesus said take ye away the stone and
[43:11] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[43:13] said unto him Lord by this time he
[43:16] stinketh for he ha been dead four days
[43:19] Jesus saith unto her said not I unto
[43:24] thee that if thou wouldest believe thou
[43:26] should us see the the glory of God then
[43:29] they took away the Stone from the place
[43:31] where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted
[43:34] up his eyes and said father I thank thee
[43:36] that thou Hast heard me and I knew that
[43:39] thou hearest me always but because of
[43:41] the people which I which stand by I said
[43:44] it that they may believe that thou Hast
[43:47] sent me and when he thus had spoken he
[43:51] cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[43:54] forth and he that was dead came forth
[43:57] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[44:00] and his face was bound about with a
[44:02] napkin and Jesus sath unto them loose
[44:05] him and let him go amen let's just bow
[44:09] our heads in a word of prayer
[44:13] father we're so thankful that we can
[44:16] trust you and depend upon you Lord in
[44:19] which we are doing that
[44:21] tonight we're asking Lord that you would
[44:24] just come in your Mighty presence in a
[44:27] supernatural way and that you would
[44:29] Minister to your people for you alone
[44:32] know the needs and you alone know how to
[44:35] meet them now father may your word go
[44:38] forth I pray that you'd help me to get
[44:41] myself out of the way and Lord just help
[44:44] us all father just to get ourselves out
[44:47] of the way any spirit that would try to
[44:49] hinder the service tonight I pray that
[44:52] you would just rebuke it and drive it
[44:54] away from us we ask it father in Jesus
[44:58] Christ's name and the church says amen
[45:01] amen and amen you can have your seats
[45:05] this
[45:07] evening and not to take long I I was
[45:11] going to speak on a different subject
[45:13] but just couldn't get the Liberty to do
[45:15] so and so we're just kind of depending
[45:18] on God uh this evening to help
[45:23] us but you know we are all familiar in
[45:28] one way or another with the the two
[45:30] stories that we had
[45:32] read um you may have not experienced the
[45:35] death in the family and you may have not
[45:37] experienced fishing all night not
[45:39] catching
[45:40] nothing uh but josi raises his
[45:44] hand uh but uh we're familiar with this
[45:49] uh stories because we have all faced uh
[45:54] situations uh that would seem
[45:57] possible uh I think we've all if you've
[46:00] lived long enough you've you've you had
[46:04] things that were just beyond your
[46:06] control and you wondered how it was
[46:08] going to happen how it was going to be
[46:10] resolved how you know all all these
[46:13] things but you know I I do declare and I
[46:17] I think uh any True Believer as as we
[46:21] grow in God we we find that God likes to
[46:25] put us in situations such as that he
[46:29] likes to put us in situations to where
[46:32] our back is against the wall we don't
[46:34] know what we're going to do how are we
[46:36] going to handle it what's going to take
[46:38] place it seems like it the ship is going
[46:41] to go under so to speak it just looks
[46:43] like you know we ain't going to make it
[46:46] it ain't going to come through and and
[46:48] uh it seems like you know that that the
[46:51] enemy uh the devil is going to just have
[46:54] the final word over our lives over the
[46:57] situation and and things like that but
[47:00] but God likes it that way to be honest
[47:03] and and it's it's because he likes to
[47:06] show his power to us he likes to
[47:09] manifest himself we we talk about it if
[47:12] there was no if we had no sickness we'd
[47:14] never know God as a Healer if we had no
[47:17] uh trouble we'd never know God as a way
[47:20] maker if if if if we didn't need
[47:23] salvation we'd never know God as a
[47:25] savior but uh God loves the contrast and
[47:28] and we we know that God is all powerful
[47:31] God is all knowing he's he's he's all
[47:35] Mighty ain't that right and so uh uh he
[47:38] is the god of Miracles if if if we're
[47:42] ever going to walk with God we've got to
[47:44] know that that God is a god of Miracles
[47:48] we we don't walk with the god of science
[47:50] because he's he's greater than science
[47:53] he we we don't walk with a God that that
[47:56] just is on our our level amen but we're
[47:59] walking with someone we're having a
[48:01] relationship an experience with with a
[48:04] god that is greater than than all things
[48:08] and so if if and and God wants us to
[48:11] experience him not not by just coming to
[48:14] church and learning about him and even
[48:16] reading the Bible that's wonderful to
[48:18] read the Bible and to know what he's
[48:20] promised in these things but but but
[48:23] that's not what God wants us to know him
[48:25] by go wants us to know him by experience
[48:29] to where that we will know that that we
[48:32] don't have to just read about him
[48:34] rolling back the Red Sea but we' know
[48:36] that he was the god that done that for
[48:38] us it may have not been a literal Red
[48:41] Sea but it's a God that the same God
[48:44] that done that is the same God that
[48:46] worked the miracle for us so so we must
[48:48] we must believe in miracles if we're
[48:51] going to walk with God and if we're
[48:53] going to trust in God and and if we're
[48:56] going to have faith in God we must
[48:58] believe in miracles can you say Amen you
[49:02] you can't walk with God and not believe
[49:04] in miracles you you can't you you you
[49:07] can't even you can't even be a Christian
[49:10] without believing in Miracles amen
[49:12] because that is the god of Miracles and
[49:15] and and and to say well that God you
[49:17] know I I I serve God I trust in God but
[49:20] I don't believe in miracles well then
[49:22] what God are you serving you're you're
[49:24] you're trying to change the way he is uh
[49:28] you're trying to change who he is and
[49:30] what he is and and and and you you can't
[49:34] do that because God don't change it it
[49:37] doesn't matter what the world thinks of
[49:39] God God is still Almighty it it doesn't
[49:42] matter what I say of God God is still
[49:45] God ain't that right and and so the only
[49:47] way that God can change would be in your
[49:50] mind of how you perceive of him but that
[49:53] still doesn't mean that you've changed
[49:55] God you've just only change your
[49:57] perception of God and and when you
[50:00] change God and make him a weak God then
[50:03] you can't believe in God you you can't
[50:05] believe in the impossibilities when
[50:07] you're when you want to change God and
[50:10] and and we'll we'll put it this way is a
[50:12] lot of folks even want to make God their
[50:14] errand boy amen that God God you got to
[50:17] do this you got to do this you got to do
[50:19] that and and we we want that because we
[50:21] want a happy life everybody wants a
[50:23] happy life today amen everybody wants
[50:26] things so easy for them to where they
[50:28] have no trials they have no they they
[50:30] they have no uh challenges they you know
[50:33] well that's not trusting God Amen if you
[50:36] got money in the bank you don't have to
[50:38] trust God a as you would if you had no
[50:41] money in the bank if if you had health
[50:44] all the time you wouldn't have to trust
[50:46] God to to heal your body amen oh that
[50:49] would be easy to say oh I trust God Amen
[50:52] and yet you have no sickness so oh whoop
[50:54] pee you know but when when it comes to
[50:57] when you're facing challenges and you
[50:59] need a Healer you need a deliverer you
[51:02] need a savior you need a redeemer you
[51:05] need somebody Amen to get you out of the
[51:08] situation you're in that's really when
[51:11] you've got to trust God can you say amen
[51:14] and so we we start out as Christians you
[51:17] know well we we then we we understand
[51:20] and and you know don't don't change God
[51:22] by the way you want him to be just let
[51:25] God be God and let him do what he wants
[51:29] to do ain't that right and we know that
[51:31] all things work together for the good of
[51:34] them that love God and are called to his
[51:36] purpose according to his purpose ain't
[51:38] that right so we must believe in
[51:40] miracles because God is a god of
[51:43] Miracles that's right and the way we
[51:45] believe in miracles is the god of
[51:47] Miracles has has done a miracle upon us
[51:51] and changed us and from a sinner to a
[51:54] saint from from h Bound To Heaven bound
[51:58] and and and it's a literal miracle that
[52:01] we're here tonight on our way to heaven
[52:04] ain't that right amen but and because he
[52:07] has done that in a personal way then we
[52:10] can believe in miracles of other things
[52:13] if God can save my soul he can heal my
[52:15] body if God can heal my body then he can
[52:17] make a way where there is no way amen if
[52:20] God can answer one prayer he can answer
[52:22] this prayer and and if he can answer
[52:24] this prayer he can answer the other
[52:26] prayers God is God ain't that right so
[52:28] so Believers got to take aen the limits
[52:32] off of God and just let him be God he's
[52:34] the one that said you're in the palm of
[52:36] his hand I've got you in the palm of my
[52:38] hand and no man can pluck you out amen
[52:41] he's the one that said we're the apple
[52:42] of his eye he's the one that has made
[52:45] these promises to let us know just how
[52:48] we are with him and what he thinks of us
[52:51] he didn't save you just to leave you he
[52:54] didn't give you all these promises and
[52:55] then not manifest himself and fulfill
[52:58] them promises if he said he's a Healer
[53:01] he will heal you if he said he's a
[53:03] deliverer he will deliver you if he said
[53:06] he'll provide he will provide it's just
[53:09] the way God does these things can you
[53:11] say Amen so then as Believers we believe
[53:14] him because we understand his ways amen
[53:18] there no no s no situation should catch
[53:21] us off guard Amen to where all of a
[53:23] sudden we demote him amen one moment
[53:26] we're praising him for being on the
[53:28] throne and all of a sudden the Trials
[53:30] come and we don't know what's happening
[53:32] and and and we're just and so finally we
[53:34] just emote him and put him on our level
[53:36] H what a shame amen we may be crying but
[53:39] God ain't crying amen our heart may be
[53:42] broken over things but God's heart ain't
[53:44] broken over things because he already
[53:47] knows he's going to take care of us can
[53:50] you say Amen so we we find uh that that
[53:54] the word of God brings miracles I I
[53:56] don't believe in magician tricks I I
[53:59] don't believe that any man can perform a
[54:01] miracle a man uh a man may be able to do
[54:04] a lot of things and and a lot of uh uh
[54:07] profound things but man cannot work
[54:10] miracles it's it it's and and and and
[54:14] and this is why we don't trust in
[54:16] politics and this is why we don't trust
[54:18] in scientific things and this is why we
[54:21] don't trust in man's inventions as as
[54:24] good as they are amen man's inventions
[54:28] are limited and and politicians are
[54:31] limited and religion is limited ain't
[54:34] that right amen but see God is God Amen
[54:38] that's right see so Christians we're
[54:40] we're not religious people amen we're
[54:43] actually Christians that are called to
[54:46] walk with God and to trust God and to
[54:49] experience God and to know God Amen I'd
[54:53] rather know God than I would president
[54:55] Trump I would rather know God than any
[54:57] great man on the face of this Earth I
[55:00] would rather know him because when I'm
[55:02] down God can pick me up amen when I'm in
[55:06] the in the worst storm of my life God
[55:09] Amen can Raise Me Up amen and it's
[55:11] already promise that if you go down in
[55:13] the grave amen there's a God that's
[55:15] going to raise you back up amen because
[55:18] that's the god that we serve can you
[55:20] amen see so so the word of God brings
[55:24] Miracles and it's the only thing that
[55:26] can
[55:27] amen see and so a God is the only one
[55:30] that is greater than all things now the
[55:33] stories that we read in the Bible here
[55:35] in our opening scripture they're
[55:36] different from one another uh one has
[55:39] been fishing all night and and and cut
[55:42] nothing the other one's at the gravite
[55:44] of her brother amen and and is is
[55:46] mourning his loss and and or her loss
[55:50] and and things but yet there is a few
[55:52] similarities in in the scriptures and
[55:54] I'm just simple tonight but but but
[55:57] hopefully it'll it'll be something to
[55:58] help you but there's similarities
[56:01] between them and that is both had a need
[56:04] and it didn't matter the need they just
[56:06] had a need one needed fish and the other
[56:08] one needed a resurrection amen but there
[56:11] were needs regardless amen and and so
[56:14] that was the similarity another
[56:16] similarity in between them amen is that
[56:19] Jesus came their way amen Jesus come
[56:23] Peter's way and Jesus come Mara his way
[56:27] amen and and and another similarity is
[56:30] they both stopped looking at the
[56:32] situation they stopped looking at the
[56:35] difficult they stopped they stopped uh
[56:38] looking at the problem amen because they
[56:41] recognize that Jesus was standing before
[56:44] them can you say amen and and and they
[56:47] didn't put him as as a king a man like
[56:51] Herod or Pilot or or a governor or or or
[56:55] something like that they didn't put him
[56:56] on the level as some bishop or a priest
[56:59] or or or something like that they
[57:01] recognized that the god of heaven was
[57:04] living in that body amen and there he
[57:07] was standing in their presence and he
[57:10] could speak yeah one word just one word
[57:12] from him would change the whole
[57:14] situation can you say amen amen see so
[57:17] they had recognized you see wherever God
[57:20] is the prophet said the supernatural
[57:21] takes place because he is Supernatural
[57:25] he get your off the natural amen and let
[57:28] God work the supernatural can you say
[57:30] amen that's why you must never serve God
[57:33] by what you see by what you feel amen
[57:36] you must serve God by faith amen by
[57:39] faith ain't that right because no matter
[57:41] if the doctor says he's going to die God
[57:44] steps in at one time and if he could
[57:47] speak his word that man will raise from
[57:49] the dead amen seen it you know and we've
[57:53] seen the blind open eyes open I've seen
[57:56] crippled walk amen we've seen Miracle
[57:58] after Miracle amen what looked to be an
[58:01] impossible situation when God steps in
[58:05] he changes the situation around God
[58:08] changes the situ how many's ever
[58:10] experienced God to change the situation
[58:13] God has changed the situation me and
[58:15] brother Shi was just talking about it
[58:17] you know downstairs of what God has done
[58:19] for them 20 years of praying 20 years of
[58:22] waiting 20 years they wanting a baby and
[58:25] and and it looked like it was impossible
[58:27] and Satan was telling them that God had
[58:30] had the word that God had failed upon
[58:33] his promisees amen and Satan was trying
[58:35] to get her to believe that amen but God
[58:38] come up on the scene and and they're
[58:40] expecting a child can you amen amen what
[58:43] is it that ought to give us faith that
[58:45] if God can do it for them God can do it
[58:47] for me this church ought to be excited
[58:49] about what God is doing amen don't be
[58:52] looking for miracles God is working
[58:54] miracles right before our eyes
[58:57] amen see amen but you know so wherever
[59:00] God is wherever God is the supernatural
[59:03] takes place because he is Supernatural
[59:06] brother brandom said if if people can
[59:08] recognize his presence then they are
[59:11] healed by faith believing believing it
[59:14] ain't that right amen see we have uh
[59:17] we've seen too much personality of man
[59:20] we're in the age of achievement of men
[59:23] men has achieved great things got us up
[59:25] in beyond space into the moon and and we
[59:28] we've seen you know uh uh just so many
[59:31] achievements a man getting right up at
[59:34] at the edge of space you know and then
[59:36] just falling off you know just just just
[59:39] falling and and and and he lives to tell
[59:43] this and lands on Earth and going I
[59:45] don't know how many miles an hour amen
[59:48] and and great achievements of man we
[59:51] been able to fly able to do all kinds of
[59:54] things and you know we now we got the
[59:56] internet and able to talk to each other
[59:58] around the world and and and and all of
[1:00:00] these things see but but what what's
[1:00:03] making it I I'll be honest it's in this
[1:00:05] age though through all of this it's
[1:00:08] making people's Faith
[1:00:10] slow I thank God for technology it's
[1:00:13] definitely made our life easier but is
[1:00:15] there's a danger with that it makes our
[1:00:17] faith slow and and the Bible speaks of
[1:00:20] that that there would be dangerous times
[1:00:22] and the prophet says it's when the
[1:00:24] people's Faith would become slow to
[1:00:26] where they can't take God at his word
[1:00:29] anymore can you say Amen they're they're
[1:00:31] they're relyant upon what man can do and
[1:00:34] if man says it can't happen then all of
[1:00:37] a sudden we just feel like it cannot
[1:00:39] happen amen if we think that there's no
[1:00:42] way out of it if we cannot see ourselves
[1:00:44] through it then we just automatically
[1:00:46] give up and we Despair and we all these
[1:00:49] things but I'm here to tell you that God
[1:00:51] don't need man's achievements amen God
[1:00:54] is greater than anything
[1:00:56] that could ever be can you say Amen we
[1:00:59] depended upon the personality of a man
[1:01:01] we depended upon education and theology
[1:01:04] we depended upon too many things that
[1:01:06] were not of God Amen see we've seen too
[1:01:10] many fleshly manifestations and have
[1:01:12] been disappointed in all of it amen in
[1:01:15] in one way or another but Jesus now so
[1:01:19] so when he come Peter recognized the the
[1:01:22] presence of Jesus Christ right there
[1:01:24] before him amen Martha recognized the
[1:01:28] presence of Jesus Christ amen there was
[1:01:30] something about him she says oh yes uh
[1:01:33] if you had been here amen days earlier
[1:01:35] my my uh brother would have not have
[1:01:37] died see but if nevertheless whatever
[1:01:40] you say God will hear your prayer can
[1:01:43] you say amen amen she still had a faith

[1:04:05] for that that we don't have to look at
[1:04:07] this Bible and read about a god of 2,000
[1:04:10] years ago of what he done for Peter and
[1:04:13] what he done for Martha raising the dead

[1:04:46] in US amen don't you let the devil blind
[1:04:49] you from that he is in you if you've got
[1:04:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is in

[1:05:27] spirit amen to where we can believe for
[1:05:30] all things a all things can you say Amen
[1:05:34] so God ain't keeping us from trouble but
[1:05:36] he'll bring us through that trouble he
[1:05:38] didn't keep the Hebrew boys out of the
[1:05:40] fire but he was there with them in that
[1:05:42] fire amen he didn't keep Daniel from the
[1:05:44] liones den but he was there amen with
[1:05:47] Daniel Amen and he may not keep you from
[1:05:49] the trials he may not keep you from the
[1:05:52] the the testing but he's right there
[1:05:54] with you
[1:05:57] amen yes sir that's
[1:05:59] true now brother Brown said the holy
[1:06:02] spirit is in his church to fulfill what
[1:06:05] the New Testament said that would come
[1:06:06] to pass in these last days do you
[1:06:09] believe that amen now there's no place
[1:06:11] in the Bible we've said it before but
[1:06:13] there's no place in the Bible that that
[1:06:15] speaks of a defeated
[1:06:17] church amen there's no place in the
[1:06:19] Bible where where Jesus said Devils will
[1:06:22] run all over you amen there's no place
[1:06:25] in the Bible where where that Jesus
[1:06:27] talked about a church his New Testament
[1:06:29] Church being totally uh uh defeated
[1:06:32] don't know what to do just just victims
[1:06:35] of the devil and victims of of of
[1:06:38] situations and and the world's got more
[1:06:40] power over the church and all that
[1:06:42] you'll never find that in in the Bible
[1:06:45] you you might find it in some other book
[1:06:47] but you'll never find it in this word of
[1:06:49] God Amen but what we find is that God
[1:06:52] promised that he would build a church
[1:06:54] amen upon the re of who Jesus Christ is
[1:06:58] amen and the gates of hell would never
[1:07:01] Prevail against it now now it that means
[1:07:04] it would tell us that the gates of hell
[1:07:06] would try to Prevail amen it would war
[1:07:09] against that church it would try to
[1:07:11] shake the church to its foundation it
[1:07:13] would try to take the faith away from
[1:07:15] the church The Joy away from the church
[1:07:17] but it would not Prevail amen for God
[1:07:21] had already promised it wouldn't Prevail
[1:07:24] amen see amen he says in my name you'll
[1:07:27] cast out Devils you'll lay hands on the
[1:07:29] sick and they shall recover you could
[1:07:31] drink any deadly thing and it would not
[1:07:33] hurt you and and on and on are the
[1:07:36] promises amen see amen even even he said
[1:07:40] uh uh whatsoever you shall bind on Earth
[1:07:43] shall be bound in heaven and whatever
[1:07:45] you loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[1:07:47] heaven it's all at your word for it's
[1:07:49] Christ in you the word is now in you can
[1:07:53] you say amen and now you have that
[1:07:55] Authority so the holy spirit is in his
[1:07:59] church to fulfill what the New Testament
[1:08:02] said that would come to pass in the last
[1:08:05] days he didn't promise to give you
[1:08:07] feelings amen your feelings will come
[1:08:10] and go you'll feel saved one day feels
[1:08:13] lost the next amen you ain't always
[1:08:15] going to be it you ain't always going to
[1:08:17] your your flesh is up and down your your
[1:08:20] emotions are up and down can you say
[1:08:22] Amen you're going to have good days
[1:08:23] you're going to have bad days that's a
[1:08:25] GI fight amen if you're a human being
[1:08:28] you're going to have good days you're
[1:08:29] going to have bad days amen you're going
[1:08:31] to have trials you're going to have
[1:08:32] testing you're going to have a
[1:08:33] disappointment you're going to smile
[1:08:35] you're going to cry you're going to
[1:08:37] whatever that's all that's all there but
[1:08:39] inside of there is a Christ amen Christ
[1:08:42] in you the hope of glory that is all
[1:08:45] powerful that's greater it's God that
[1:08:47] condensated from Heaven amen come in the
[1:08:50] body of Jesus Christ to redeem us back
[1:08:54] to him and now now he's ascended to
[1:08:56] heaven and come back Amen to dwell in a
[1:09:00] people and he's showing himself alive
[1:09:04] today can you say amen amen so we have
[1:09:08] seen the sign of his resurrection in
[1:09:10] this day that Jesus had promised to let
[1:09:14] us know not to dwell upon a man amen but
[1:09:18] to to to know that he's here do you
[1:09:22] believe it amen to know that he's here
[1:09:25] amen see so now these people
[1:09:28] understood that we read in our opening
[1:09:30] scripture they understood that that uh
[1:09:33] uh Jesus had the ability to speak the
[1:09:35] word and whatever he said it would
[1:09:38] happen can you say Amen they understood
[1:09:42] the power that was in his voice amen yes
[1:09:45] sir you know man may have not been there
[1:09:49] in the beginning when God said let there
[1:09:51] be light and then watch that light
[1:09:54] appear you may have not been there to
[1:09:56] see the trees and the flowers amen
[1:09:59] spring forth after God said let there be
[1:10:02] trees and let there be this and let
[1:10:04] there be that he may have not been there
[1:10:07] in all these things but they were there
[1:10:09] amen them them people were there when he
[1:10:12] looked at that Centurion amen you you
[1:10:15] know the story of the Centurion but he
[1:10:17] looked at that Centurion and said go thy
[1:10:19] way and as thou Hast believed amen so be
[1:10:22] it done unto thee amen and what he said
[1:10:26] happened ain't that right amen yes sir
[1:10:30] they they were there or uh uh uh when
[1:10:33] Jesus said to that bedridden man that
[1:10:35] had been there laying there maybe for 30
[1:10:37] years or so amen but had been there and
[1:10:40] they heard Jesus say arise and take up
[1:10:42] thy bed and go into thine house and the
[1:10:45] Bible says immediately he arose and took
[1:10:47] up the bed and went forth before them
[1:10:50] all ain't that right they were around
[1:10:52] maybe when Jesus was there Amen in that
[1:10:55] house and and when Jesus looked at that
[1:10:58] dead girl and said Mary uh or made arise
[1:11:01] and her spirit came again and she arose
[1:11:05] amen and they saw the effects of that
[1:11:07] amen the crying turned into laughter and
[1:11:10] joy and rejoicing because there was a
[1:11:14] word that was spoken over a dead uh girl
[1:11:18] and she Rose can you say Amen on and on
[1:11:21] and on Amen they were there when they
[1:11:24] saw the power of that word and what it
[1:11:27] had and the effect that it had upon the
[1:11:30] individuals amen you think of this of
[1:11:32] Martha's own sister Mary that was
[1:11:35] delivered after she had washed jesus'
[1:11:37] feet and she was there and she felt the
[1:11:39] effects of the power of that word when
[1:11:42] he looked at her and said thy sins which
[1:11:43] are many are forgiven thee amen what an
[1:11:47] effect Mary never did go back to that
[1:11:49] old way of life ain't that right so see
[1:11:52] the power of His word had been
[1:11:55] demonstrated to them and upon them amen
[1:11:59] now the prophet says oh God still has a
[1:12:02] voice for the people of the world even
[1:12:05] he as he has given a voice he's given a
[1:12:08] voice to the bride that voice is in the
[1:12:13] bride can you say Amen oh my have you
[1:12:16] ever wondered how the voice becomes in
[1:12:19] the bride amen the bride gets her voice
[1:12:22] brother brandom says in the last days or
[1:12:24] in the the days of the seventh messenger
[1:12:27] in the days of the Le Osan age its
[1:12:29] Messenger will receive the mysteries of
[1:12:32] God as revealed to Paul he will speak
[1:12:35] out and those who receive that prophet
[1:12:38] in his own name will receive the
[1:12:40] beneficient effect of that prophet's
[1:12:42] Ministry and they that hear him will be
[1:12:46] blessed can you say Amen they that hear
[1:12:49] him will be blessed they're not going to
[1:12:52] dry up they're not going to die off
[1:12:54] they're Revival ain't going to die off
[1:12:56] it ain't more it's more than just an
[1:12:58] emotional thing amen they that hear him
[1:13:02] will be bless and become part of that
[1:13:05] Bride of the last day who are mentioned
[1:13:08] in Revelations 22:17 the spirit and the
[1:13:11] bride say come the corn of wheat the
[1:13:14] bride wheat that fell into the ground at
[1:13:16] NAA has come back to original word a
[1:13:19] grain again praise God forever yes
[1:13:22] listen to that authenticated prophet of
[1:13:24] God who appeared in this last agage what
[1:13:26] he says to from God the bride will say
[1:13:30] can you say Amen what he says from God
[1:13:33] the bride will say Amen see the spirit
[1:13:36] and the prophet and the bride will be
[1:13:39] saying the same thing aren't you glad
[1:13:42] for that see so our word the word comes
[1:13:46] into us by us listening and taking heed
[1:13:49] to what the prophet of God in this last
[1:13:52] stage has said for the word of God comes
[1:13:54] to the
[1:13:55] bride to the prophet amen see so we we
[1:14:00] find that that even though the people
[1:14:02] were facing an impossible situation they
[1:14:06] believed they believed the word of
[1:14:09] Jesus Lord amen they they disregarded
[1:14:12] the situation they quit looking at the
[1:14:15] the
[1:14:16] impossibilities and they began to focus
[1:14:19] upon what Jesus was telling them can you
[1:14:22] say amen I believe Jesus has been trying
[1:14:24] to get us to
[1:14:25] Focus amen Focus yes sir it's time to
[1:14:29] focus I think that's where we're coming
[1:14:31] to manifestation of sons of God matured

[1:14:36] enough been tutored and tutored and
[1:14:39] tutored can you say amen and the son
[1:14:42] that focuses upon that tutorship of
[1:14:45] hearing what the pro or what what the
[1:14:47] tutor has spoke and and what he's been
[1:14:49] teaching and he becomes all the he he he
[1:14:52] becomes more and more like his father
[1:14:55] because he's understanding the ways of
[1:14:57] the father he's
[1:14:59] listening can you say Amen he's not just
[1:15:02] getting educated in quotes not just
[1:15:04] getting educated about the Bible he's
[1:15:07] listening he's taking heed of what that
[1:15:10] tutor is speaking of the father yes sir
[1:15:14] it's changing his character it's
[1:15:16] changing his nature it's changing how he
[1:15:18] looks at things it's changing how he
[1:15:20] reacts to things it's changing him yes
[1:15:24] sir so is this message changing
[1:15:27] us oh yes sir it's changing this
[1:15:31] elect yep it's changing the way we act
[1:15:34] to things is changing the way we do
[1:15:37] things is changing everything is
[1:15:39] changing why amen because we're we're
[1:15:41] listening we're listening to the words
[1:15:43] of what has been said we're recognizing
[1:15:46] it's no longer a word of a man it's a
[1:15:48] word of God to us amen ain't that right
[1:15:51] amen this word will get you out of
[1:15:53] situations
[1:15:55] it'll change the situation if you listen
[1:15:57] to the word of God yes sir quit trying
[1:15:59] to do it on your own amen stay faithful
[1:16:02] stay steadfast amen God will bring you
[1:16:07] through yes he will he's got to he
[1:16:10] promised he would amen ain't that right
[1:16:14] yes sir see so notice how it's changing
[1:16:17] it's changing us from just a church
[1:16:19] member to matured sons of God is
[1:16:22] changing us from sinner to matured sons
[1:16:24] of God God it's changing us from a
[1:16:26] religious form Amen to real sons of God
[1:16:30] to where we can totally rely upon the
[1:16:33] word of God that's good so they no
[1:16:37] longer see they they they believed his
[1:16:40] word they recognized that that Jesus was
[1:16:43] in his midst they didn't put him as as
[1:16:46] just some politician or some Governor
[1:16:49] some preacher some priest and some
[1:16:51] bishop and some Theologian they didn't
[1:16:53] put him into that they knew he was in a
[1:16:56] class all by himself the word was there
[1:16:59] he was the word made flesh this was God
[1:17:01] Of Heaven now made flesh and he's
[1:17:04] standing there and he speaks his word to
[1:17:07] them they quit acting like things were
[1:17:10] hopeless they they didn't look at the
[1:17:12] situation like they were looking at it
[1:17:13] before he showed up amen why because now
[1:17:18] they were believers they believe the
[1:17:20] word of God over the situation they
[1:17:23] believe the word of God over the
[1:17:25] impossibility amen they quit looking at
[1:17:27] what they were looking at and they began
[1:17:29] to look at what he was saying to them
[1:17:31] they were they were begin to focus upon
[1:17:33] what he was saying to
[1:17:35] them can you say
[1:17:37] Amen Peter as a man Peter before Jesus
[1:17:41] ever said anything believe that there
[1:17:42] was no fish in that Lake he he gave up
[1:17:45] he ready to go home there ain't no fish
[1:17:48] there that's what he thought but when he
[1:17:51] come in the presence of Jesus Christ and
[1:17:53] and the word came to him and said cast
[1:17:56] your net out in the deep it chained the
[1:17:59] S now he started to argueing did he not
[1:18:00] well Lord we've been here all night May
[1:18:04] as though he didn't know their
[1:18:07] situation sometimes we pray and we give
[1:18:10] God all of our bad situation as if he
[1:18:12] doesn't know the situation you're
[1:18:14] in yeah
[1:18:18] amen good ain't that right he'll give us
[1:18:22] a word that is so contrary to what we
[1:18:24] believe and what we're thinking and how
[1:18:25] we're going to handle that situation
[1:18:27] Peter said the way he going to handle it
[1:18:29] he's going to go
[1:18:31] home but here comes
[1:18:33] Jesus and gives him a total different
[1:18:36] way to act that's right cast your net
[1:18:38] out on the Deep
[1:18:40] right amen I've done that Lord but the
[1:18:43] difference was Jesus spoke a word can
[1:18:47] you say
[1:18:47] Amen see so Peter had good reason to
[1:18:52] believe that there was no fish cuz he
[1:18:54] had been fishing all night but notice
[1:18:56] the word of the Lord took
[1:18:59] preeminence can you say Amen Lord and so
[1:19:03] Peter being willing to ignore just what
[1:19:06] he had been
[1:19:08] through he was willing to ignore
[1:19:10] everything he had just experienced that
[1:19:13] night and at the word of Jesus letting
[1:19:17] that word have
[1:19:19] preeminence he cast his net out in the
[1:19:21] Deep think about it so was it with Mar
[1:19:25] and those around when Jesus said roll
[1:19:28] away the stone amen
[1:19:31] what it's things
[1:19:34] right but he had to remind
[1:19:37] them didn't I tell you didn't I tell you
[1:19:42] that you're going to see a miracle
[1:19:43] didn't I not tell you you're going to
[1:19:44] see the god of Heaven Come on the
[1:19:49] scene and they had to cast their
[1:19:52] feelings aside they had to quit looking
[1:19:54] at the situ
[1:19:55] and let the word of God have the
[1:19:57] preeminence can you say amen amen now I
[1:20:00] think it was the prophet that said why
[1:20:02] did not why why did he have them to roll
[1:20:04] the stone he could have spoke the word
[1:20:05] and the stone would have demolished
[1:20:08] disappeared would have rolled on its own
[1:20:10] he said and and I believe it's brother
[1:20:11] Brandon that said it's because they have
[1:20:14] something to do and you have something
[1:20:16] to do can you say man you have something
[1:20:19] to do
[1:20:22] amen God doesn't want to sit on the
[1:20:25] sidelines and cry and moan that's right
[1:20:28] he wants us to do something it's an Act
[1:20:31] of
[1:20:33] Faith that's true that's right wh what
[1:20:36] what what what if they kept ignoring
[1:20:39] what what what if they kept arguing well
[1:20:41] I ain't going to do it I'm going to go
[1:20:43] home you want to go fish there's the
[1:20:45] Nets there's the boat you just go help
[1:20:47] yourself he would have never saw the
[1:20:49] miracle if if Marth and them refused to
[1:20:52] roll the well you just roll with that
[1:20:54] stone I I'll go get a clothes pin for my
[1:20:57] nose they would have never saw the
[1:21:00] miracle but there was a people that
[1:21:02] could have let the word have preeminence
[1:21:04] in their
[1:21:06] lives can you say amen I think it's the
[1:21:09] same way if Abraham would have argued
[1:21:12] with God instead of coming out of the
[1:21:13] land that God told him to come out he
[1:21:15] would have never saw the
[1:21:17] blessings ain't that right but he obeyed
[1:21:19] God and the Bible says they that are the
[1:21:21] sons of God are led by the spirit of God
[1:21:24] we're LED by the spirit of God not by
[1:21:26] some emotion not by some fantastic thing
[1:21:29] we're not led by S some scientific
[1:21:31] discovery we're led by the word of God
[1:21:35] the spirit of God can you say Amen this
[1:21:38] was the point of him redeeming us
[1:21:40] Colossians 1118 and he is the head of
[1:21:42] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:21:44] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:21:47] things he might have the preeminence
[1:21:49] amen do you believe that amen see and so
[1:21:53] therefore they believed in what Jesus
[1:21:56] said and by believing in what he said
[1:21:59] they forsook their reasoning they
[1:22:01] forsook their natural things their
[1:22:03] feelings their emotions of what they
[1:22:06] thought it should be they forsook it all
[1:22:08] and acted upon what he told them to do
[1:22:11] you see God doesn't tell us to do
[1:22:12] something if he ain't plan on doing
[1:22:16] something are you with me amen God
[1:22:19] doesn't tell us to do something if he's
[1:22:21] not planning on working a miracle on
[1:22:23] your behalf
[1:22:25] God's God's not that type of a person if
[1:22:29] he tells you to do something he's
[1:22:30] interested he he's involved in it now
[1:22:33] he's involved in your life he's involved
[1:22:36] in your
[1:22:38] situation yes sir never seen him let
[1:22:42] down a Believer yet for that matter I've
[1:22:45] never seen him let down a sinner yet
[1:22:48] true God is faithful to all yeah whether
[1:22:51] they want to acknowledge it or not God
[1:22:53] is faithful that's right brother can you
[1:22:55] say Amen but when God tells us to do
[1:22:58] something we must do it You' got your
[1:23:00] own free will we've all got our own free
[1:23:03] will we we every situation that you go
[1:23:06] through you can handle it the way God
[1:23:08] wants you to handle it or you can handle
[1:23:09] it the way you want to handle it that's
[1:23:12] right brother ain't that right but but
[1:23:14] we've been given in this day the way
[1:23:16] that God wants us to handle
[1:23:18] it are you with me amen amen situations
[1:23:22] you can handle it the way you want to in
[1:23:24] your own human way you'll miss a make a
[1:23:25] mess of it and go ahead God will just
[1:23:27] keep his hands off of it you you you
[1:23:30] fight your own battles God won't give
[1:23:32] his you then then God will let you fight
[1:23:34] them battles cuz you don't give God the
[1:23:37] chance to fight the battles God God
[1:23:39] ain't going to share his glory with you
[1:23:41] amen God ain't going to share his glory
[1:23:43] with with sha Martin God wants the glory
[1:23:47] god is all powerful amen can you say
[1:23:49] Amen it's not us and God it's God it's
[1:23:53] not God at the wheel and we're at the
[1:23:54] other wheel we're not God's
[1:23:57] co-pilot bless the
[1:24:00] Lord God Wants It All or Nothing amen
[1:24:03] can you say amen that's the point he
[1:24:06] wants to take you and he wants to use
[1:24:07] you he wants glory out of you praise the
[1:24:10] Lord yes sir I love the
[1:24:13] Lord amen so what God tells us to do it
[1:24:17] we must do it when he tells us to do it
[1:24:20] now his word tells us what to do and and
[1:24:22] we could go through a whole list and I'm
[1:24:24] I'm going to
[1:24:26] close but here's here's two vital
[1:24:30] scriptures that he tells us what to do
[1:24:34] Psalms 1061
[1:24:36] Hallelujah if you can put that up there
[1:24:39] I didn't give him any of the scriptures
[1:24:40] cuz I didn't know what I was going to
[1:24:41] speak
[1:24:42] on praise ye the Lord say that with me
[1:24:45] praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto
[1:24:50] the Lord for he is good stop there
[1:24:55] is he good when we're going through good
[1:24:58] times all the or is he does he stop
[1:25:03] being good some
[1:25:07] point then why does our praise and I I'm
[1:25:10] talking about us now me all of us here
[1:25:13] why would I why would we stop giving him
[1:25:16] thanks why does it stop then if if our
[1:25:20] praise and our giving thanks hinges on

[1:26:38] well he's already told us what to do and
[1:26:40] there's simple
[1:26:41] things he doesn't give you things that
[1:26:43] are totally
[1:26:45] impossible he doesn't tell you to turn
[1:26:47] oil into gasoline or whatever amen he
[1:26:51] just tells you to give thanks unto him
[1:26:54] and bless His holy name praise the Lord

[1:28:53] live by and the more we mature as sons
