[40:46] Doom and Gloom for the world but you
[40:49] know it ain't gonna be long we're going
[40:51] to be out of here
[40:53] be caught up and to meet our Lord and
[40:57] I'm just looking forward to that time
[41:00] before we go into the word and may we
[41:02] just buy our heads and talk to
[41:06] the author of the word
[41:09] father
[41:12] it is so good to
[41:15] be able to call you our father
[41:19] law relationship
[41:22] that we have with you
[41:24] Lord as Sons and Daughters your children
[41:29] oh God knowing that we're the apple of
[41:32] your eye and
[41:35] God we're just so thankful our hearts
[41:38] are at rest
[41:40] Lord knowing that even as we walk in
[41:42] this Troublesome world
[41:45] father we're always with you
[41:48] and then Lord there's nothing that can
[41:52] distract your attention from us
[41:56] and I believe that this meeting is
[41:58] ordained the service father of you
[42:02] Lord you've seen this service before the
[42:07] world began
[42:09] you knew who would be able to to make it
[42:11] tonight and
[42:13] father and I believe it pleases you just
[42:16] to be with us
[42:18] and Lord we just humbly ask that you
[42:21] would now have your way in
[42:23] help us Lord help me to get myself out
[42:27] of the way and that you would speak
[42:29] through these mortal lips father and
[42:32] that you would anoint your people the
[42:35] hearts the years Lord to receive to
[42:38] understand
[42:40] we ask it father that your Liberty would
[42:43] just be here father
[42:45] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[42:48] amen
[42:50] praise the Lord
[42:52] it's got a little ring to it
[42:54] the Psalms 23 we're going to start at
[42:58] the first verse
[43:00] but it says the Lord is my shepherd
[43:04] I shall not one
[43:07] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[43:09] Pastures he leadeth me
[43:12] beside the Still Waters
[43:15] he restoreth my soul
[43:18] elateth me in the paths of righteousness
[43:23] for his name's sake
[43:25] amen you can have your seats this
[43:28] evening
[43:29] we've been on this
[43:32] chapter for a while now
[43:34] and I pray it's been a blessing to you
[43:37] as it has to me and then studying it and
[43:42] tonight I'm going to
[43:46] deal with the the last part of the third
[43:49] chapter we've been talking on he
[43:52] restoreth my soul
[43:54] for a while and
[43:57] uh but tonight he leadeth me in the
[44:01] paths of righteousness
[44:03] and I want to
[44:05] Endeavor to show the contrast that's
[44:09] that's the the point tonight
[44:12] is to show a contrast to the path of
[44:16] righteousness for there is always a
[44:18] contrast uh as brother Branham said it
[44:22] you know it's the law of contrast it
[44:24] takes the night to show the day it takes
[44:27] the it it takes the evil to show the
[44:30] good it it takes it it always takes the
[44:34] opposite to show the the the other side
[44:39] and so here David is speaking about
[44:42] Paths of righteousness
[44:45] and and so we We Know by that statement
[44:49] that God does not lead his sheep into
[44:53] just some some path
[44:56] uh uh but he leads a sheep in Paths of
[45:02] righteousness
[45:03] and the Bible tells us that the
[45:07] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[45:10] of the Lord ain't that right
[45:13] so I looked up this word path
[45:16] and according to Webster the word path
[45:20] is a course a root a way of life a way
[45:26] of thought or conduct
[45:28] so that's that's what the word path
[45:31] would mean is the course a root a way of
[45:35] life a way of thought or conduct
[45:39] so when just take for instance when we
[45:44] see a young child boy girl
[45:47] doing things that are wrong
[45:51] um
[45:52] and they could start
[45:54] at a at a very young age and and but as
[45:59] they're growing we we would say they're
[46:02] walking down a wrong path
[46:04] there's there's something there and what
[46:08] we are saying by that statement is
[46:10] that that boy or that girl if there's
[46:14] not a correction they're going to
[46:17] develop a behavior they're going to
[46:20] develop habits they're going to develop
[46:22] a character they're going to develop
[46:25] um and and if if if the situation isn't
[46:30] corrected when they're young
[46:32] then when they get older and you start
[46:36] seeing them same traits just in a more
[46:39] matured way then you know they're
[46:42] walking down a wrong path we would say
[46:45] that and and so then they're going to be
[46:49] worse than what they are now uh they
[46:52] grow up then they're going to be in
[46:54] trouble with the law if they can't
[46:55] respect mom and dad at home
[46:57] uh if they can't respect the house of
[47:00] God if they can't respect uh the
[47:04] authority that they're under uh when
[47:07] they're young then you mark it down if
[47:09] God does not intervene with that child
[47:13] then they will get older to where they
[47:16] won't respect the law they won't respect
[47:18] any kind of authority
[47:21] they'll have trouble not only with the
[47:23] law they'll have trouble in their
[47:25] marriage uh if a child grows up to be
[47:29] very haughty disrespectful mouthy having
[47:33] his own way all the time then he won't
[47:37] be able when he gets older to deal with
[47:39] issues he won't be able to he'll always
[47:41] want his way he'll always want it see so
[47:45] if a child sneaks around and steals
[47:49] little things from Mom or Dad or or a
[47:52] child is constantly telling lies or
[47:55] talks about filthy things well it's a
[47:59] path it's a path that that child is
[48:02] walking down that if if somehow they're
[48:07] not corrected and of course ultimately
[48:10] they're going to need the Holy Ghost
[48:13] uh because they have a nature that will
[48:16] take them down a certain Road
[48:19] uh uh there and and so it's it's uh uh
[48:25] there but as they grow up then the more
[48:29] the more trouble they come into the more
[48:32] the child becomes involved in things
[48:35] that is wrong uh and and the path that
[48:38] he or she is on is taking them in a
[48:43] certain direction
[48:44] it's it's a path and and so uh he or she
[48:49] will become a drunk or a drug addict or
[48:52] or become involved in sexual activity
[48:55] and or they will be involved in worse
[48:58] things and may eventually end up in jail
[49:02] or prison or whatever but but it's a
[49:06] path and and so as as as as parents when
[49:10] we when we have our young children it's
[49:13] not just having children and and it's so
[49:16] sad today that that people are Are Young
[49:19] Generation uh and and I'm not talking
[49:22] here but I'm just talking about in the
[49:24] world generally that that they just want
[49:27] to have babies and and really it's not
[49:29] really thinking about babies as much as
[49:32] they want to just have sex you know and
[49:35] and have these relationships and and not
[49:38] caring about responsibility not caring
[49:40] about uh the aftermath of their res you
[49:44] know of their actions and and before you
[49:47] know it they're they're they're giving
[49:49] their babies to be adopted they're
[49:51] they're
[49:52] um uh uh you know they're killing them
[49:55] they
[49:56] they just don't want that responsibility
[49:59] you know uh of these things but here
[50:02] brother Branham says this and and and
[50:05] and I just throw this in there because
[50:08] we're talking about path that you
[50:11] mothers have a great responsibility of
[50:13] what that child will be it will be
[50:17] raised on the way you start your child
[50:19] on the path that it must travel
[50:23] another place brother Brown said mother
[50:25] has the responsibility from God to place
[50:29] that child on the right Road and I think
[50:33] that's why mothers has a special little
[50:36] touch ain't that right
[50:38] I know my mom sure had a special touch
[50:41] you know and I sure love my mom today
[50:44] but uh uh now now for you mothers that
[50:49] that have we were children and and
[50:51] things like that I don't don't don't
[50:54] beat yourself up that's not the point of
[50:58] what we're trying to say tonight uh
[51:00] because children uh uh until they get
[51:04] the Holy Ghost they they're vulnerable
[51:07] to anything and you can do the best and
[51:10] you can and and steal if if well brother
[51:15] Brown talked about Billy Paul if if if
[51:18] he didn't get the Holy Ghost rock and
[51:20] roll with catch him and and even we will
[51:23] but this way in Billy Paul's testimony
[51:27] uh he talks about how he went out out in
[51:31] the world and he was gambling he was he
[51:34] become a gambler and and he talks about
[51:37] of how that is probably the reason if
[51:41] I've got it right if I've heard it's
[51:43] been a little while since I heard it but
[51:45] the reason why his dad wouldn't let him
[51:48] play with dice
[51:49] uh uh uh no game with dots you know he
[51:53] wanted to play I think it was monopolies
[51:56] and to buy it and and uh but he wasn't
[51:59] allowed to play with dice and his dad
[52:01] said no you you can unless you have some
[52:04] other way to play that but uh uh so uh
[52:08] but but it I I did he if I can
[52:12] understand that right that he felt like
[52:14] brother Branham his dad uh saw something
[52:18] there that that he was have an addiction
[52:21] or having a problem with and and so on
[52:25] until he got the Holy Ghost you see so
[52:28] so but what we're saying is that that
[52:31] that there is a certain path and in that
[52:35] path
[52:36] um there's there's there's character
[52:38] character traits there is is a nature
[52:43] there are habits there are things that
[52:46] that we start walking down and and so uh
[52:51] uh and and it's sad to say that there
[52:53] are mothers and dads that do not care
[52:56] how their child uh it turns out to be uh
[53:00] uh they they just don't care they'll
[53:02] leave them to television and right now
[53:04] this day they leave them to phones
[53:07] um to let them you know whatever
[53:09] satisfies them that's fine with us as
[53:13] long as we don't have to deal with it
[53:14] you know what I mean and and so they
[53:18] they don't care about anything of their
[53:21] children and a lot of it is because they
[53:23] don't know and that's really sad is they
[53:26] don't know how to raise a child because
[53:27] of this society today that uh uh
[53:31] motherhood is broken and and all of
[53:34] these things but our character our
[53:37] conduct and habits
[53:39] reflect the path that we are on
[53:43] now brother Branham says we should not
[53:46] be just getting about from place to
[53:50] place we should always go and consider
[53:53] the Lord before we go do you do you do
[53:57] that when you leave home pray Lord help
[54:00] me to have a safe journey over where I'm
[54:02] going and back ordering my steps today
[54:05] that I'll not step out of your blessed
[54:08] path but if I shouldn't make the wrong
[54:10] move you'll warn me and bring me right
[54:14] back into the right way again if my
[54:17] tongue should start to speak things that
[54:20] was not right uh uh will you just stop
[54:23] my tongue from speaking bring me back
[54:26] into the place uh uh the right place
[54:29] again and if I should start thinking
[54:31] wrong thoughts will you just change my
[54:34] way of thinking and let me think the
[54:37] right things it's important now it's
[54:40] important that we talk right that we
[54:43] think right that that that we act right
[54:46] that that everything about us because it
[54:49] reflects the path
[54:51] it reflects what we're walking down and
[54:54] so he says now what you think is usually
[54:57] what you do so it all comes by thought
[55:00] first ain't that right what you think is
[55:03] what you do that's why don't don't think
[55:05] negative thoughts because you'll start
[55:06] acting negative
[55:09] ain't that right
[55:11] amen now now that uh uh and I'm going to
[55:15] try to hurry here because I got a lot to
[55:17] say and and uh and we ain't gonna keep
[55:20] you long but at the same time what you
[55:23] think is the way you act and and so so
[55:27] we we have that ability to cast the
[55:31] negative thoughts out we we have that
[55:33] ability not to dwell on anything
[55:34] negative
[55:36] can you say man well it's true if you've
[55:39] got the Holy Ghost you do have that
[55:41] ability
[55:42] if you'll train yourself
[55:44] Amen in the word of God and so he says
[55:48] now he said what you think is usually
[55:51] what you do you know if you'll do right
[55:53] that's your duty to God everybody say
[55:56] that's my duty to God what's your duty
[55:58] to God by doing right
[56:00] ain't that right if you'll think right
[56:03] that's your duty to yourself
[56:06] ain't that right and you've got to come
[56:09] out right see so so if you do right
[56:12] that's your duty to God if you'll think
[56:14] right that's your duty to yourself and
[56:16] you've got to come out right see you
[56:19] can't be going east when you're going
[56:21] west and you can't be going wrong when
[56:24] you're going right or vice versa so
[56:27] think right do right and you'll be right
[56:29] ain't that right so so there's a path
[56:33] that we're going to take that it's a
[56:35] path that we're going to walk down and
[56:37] this is what David is talking about path
[56:38] path of righteousness and and so there
[56:42] there is that path of righteousness and
[56:45] so and and and as we will see a man's
[56:48] character a man's conduct and his habits
[56:51] will reflect as to whether or not he is
[56:55] walking on the path of righteousness
[56:59] ain't that right you say well I go to
[57:02] church that don't mean always that
[57:04] you're walking in the path of
[57:05] righteousness it's it's what you are as
[57:08] an individual that reflects if you're
[57:12] walking the the what whatever path
[57:14] you're walking now in the natural if
[57:17] you're wanting to go to a certain place
[57:18] well then then you want to you you want
[57:22] to find a path that will take you there
[57:25] ain't that right now uh uh we we've
[57:29] walked the Cascades you know going to
[57:31] the Cascade Falls well there there
[57:33] there's a path there and and you you
[57:37] walk that path and and and to know that
[57:40] we're on the path they've got signs
[57:42] that'll tell you exactly where you're
[57:45] headed where it's going to take you so
[57:47] so you get on that path if I'm wanting
[57:49] to go to Kentucky I don't get it on the
[57:51] path that that goes to to the Cascades
[57:55] you understand what I'm saying I I'm on
[57:58] a certain path because there it's going
[58:00] to take me in a certain direction
[58:03] now you there's also the path that's
[58:06] called the Appalachian Trail that that
[58:08] just comes right down through uh here
[58:10] and and that path takes you from Georgia
[58:13] to Maine right and and so you can get on
[58:16] that path and it's got signs to tell you
[58:19] where you're headed ain't that right see
[58:22] it's a path and and so now as Believers
[58:26] we want to go to heaven ain't that right
[58:28] we we want to go to be at that wedding
[58:31] supper I don't know about you but I want
[58:33] to be there I want to be in attendance I
[58:36] want to be part of that I I want to go
[58:39] on a honeymoon in the Millennium amen
[58:43] with my my Lord
[58:45] ain't that right I I we want to receive
[58:49] the changing of our body we we want to
[58:52] be a part of this Rapture that is
[58:55] imminent
[58:56] wait it's here upon us church and we
[59:00] want to be a part of that
[59:02] I mean he wants to be a part of that I
[59:04] don't want to be left behind I I
[59:06] certainly don't want you to be left
[59:08] behind I want us all to go together
[59:11] and and to be a part of this uh not just
[59:14] to read about it where he'll dry every
[59:17] tear from our eye but one of these days
[59:19] it's going to be reality
[59:22] amen and and you know how you dream
[59:25] about it and maybe you talk about
[59:27] vacation what we're going to go here and
[59:29] and and we're going to do this we're
[59:31] going to do that it's all planned out
[59:32] going to Florida or go to Canada or go
[59:35] wherever it but it's all planned out and
[59:38] and but and you're planning you're
[59:39] planning and you're planning and then
[59:41] all of a sudden you're right into the
[59:44] plans you're walking in the plans it's
[59:46] it's no longer planning but it's it's
[59:48] there you're in it it's everything that
[59:51] you live for or planned for and and safe
[59:54] for it's it's right there you understand
[59:56] what I'm saying well that's the way it's
[59:58] going to be one of these days it ain't
[1:00:00] gonna be just talking about a marriage
[1:00:02] supper we'll be there no more just
[1:00:05] dreaming and talking about him drying
[1:00:07] the tear from our eye it literally
[1:00:09] happened he will literally wipe every
[1:00:12] tear from your eye
[1:00:15] yeah it's something that will not just
[1:00:17] be a desire anymore it'll be a reality
[1:00:20] and you can say oh I longed for this day
[1:00:24] I long for it and here it is well we're
[1:00:27] wanting that and and we should never
[1:00:30] lose that desire we know that time has
[1:00:32] come to its end we know the Great
[1:00:35] Tribulation which is God's judgment uh
[1:00:38] uh is upon the Earth the cup of iniquity
[1:00:42] is full ain't that rhyme a man see and
[1:00:46] and yet the believer doesn't have to
[1:00:49] fear because there is a path
[1:00:53] can you say man there there is a path
[1:00:57] that takes that believer in that
[1:01:00] direction
[1:01:02] whatever he's Desiring there's a path a
[1:01:06] man that takes us to what we desire
[1:01:09] ain't that right don't think that we're
[1:01:11] just sitting around here waiting we're
[1:01:14] walking a path there is a path uh to
[1:01:17] walk and David would call it the paths
[1:01:20] of righteousness
[1:01:22] can you say man see we're not just
[1:01:25] sitting around twiddling our thumb there
[1:01:27] is a destination that we're that that
[1:01:29] we're headed to it's it's a destination
[1:01:32] we're about to reach we're almost at the
[1:01:35] end I'll tell you the joy of coming to
[1:01:37] the end of a trail
[1:01:39] the joy of coming to the end of the path
[1:01:42] I promise you you know the last time uh
[1:01:44] we walked uh uh the Cascades we took the
[1:01:48] hard route you know and I always do that
[1:01:50] because I like Challenge and it about
[1:01:52] killed me and and you know I I I got uh
[1:01:56] uh just a little ways and I'm soaked you
[1:01:59] know just just drenched and and my legs
[1:02:03] are hurting you know and and I'm weak
[1:02:06] because you know my legs are just shaky
[1:02:08] and but I kept plowing and I saw these
[1:02:11] women come by us and they got a child
[1:02:14] she's got a child on her back and she's
[1:02:17] moving I thought if she could do it I'm
[1:02:19] gonna do it you know and I just kept I
[1:02:21] wouldn't say anything I just about to
[1:02:23] die you know but then I see that sign
[1:02:26] that says you're almost there or
[1:02:28] whatever it says and to me it didn't
[1:02:32] matter what it said I just said it as
[1:02:34] you're there keep on keep on and all the
[1:02:38] Delight amen when I saw that last sign
[1:02:41] you know and then when I got there oh my
[1:02:45] word you know what a it was a joy you
[1:02:48] know and I think well if that's in the
[1:02:50] natural well so is it in the spiritual
[1:02:53] we see every sign that tells us we're
[1:02:57] about there
[1:02:59] do you see them signs the the trouble
[1:03:02] that's in the world is assigned to us a
[1:03:06] prophet coming in this day is assigned
[1:03:08] to us amen the the politics being shaken
[1:03:12] up is a sign to us Russia doing what
[1:03:14] she's doing is assigned to us the
[1:03:17] earthquakes that are happening all
[1:03:19] around is assigned to us the trouble of
[1:03:22] the nature a man that is just going just
[1:03:25] wacky it's a sign to us that we're
[1:03:28] almost there keep walking the path
[1:03:31] oh yeah you're not just wondering it's a
[1:03:33] path
[1:03:34] you're not just wandering around there
[1:03:37] is a path that's taken you where you
[1:03:40] want to go
[1:03:42] so we find that one path doesn't lead us
[1:03:47] to all kinds of places
[1:03:50] a path takes you to a certain
[1:03:52] destination ain't that right so you most
[1:03:56] certainly don't want to walk down a path
[1:03:58] or begin a path if you don't know where
[1:04:03] it's going to take you
[1:04:05] you might walk five miles and realize
[1:04:07] you've walked the wrong path
[1:04:10] that'd be rough
[1:04:12] then you say man
[1:04:14] so so you don't want to do that in the
[1:04:16] natural and you especially don't want to
[1:04:18] do it when it comes to your Eternal
[1:04:21] destination
[1:04:22] you want to walk a path that will take
[1:04:25] you to the right place
[1:04:27] ain't that right
[1:04:29] so so then now we know that there's more
[1:04:32] than one path to walk on now of course
[1:04:35] uh uh uh uh David said the Lord leadeth
[1:04:40] me the Lord is my shepherd He leads me
[1:04:44] in the paths of righteousness can you
[1:04:48] say Amen so then if you're going to walk
[1:04:51] in a trail or in a path of life you want
[1:04:54] to make sure it's the Lord that is
[1:04:56] leading you because he's not going to
[1:04:58] mislead you
[1:05:01] no I don't believe that he ain't going
[1:05:03] to mislead you but he'll lead you on the
[1:05:06] right path which is the paths of
[1:05:09] righteousness can you say man and he
[1:05:13] leads us by his voice
[1:05:16] ain't that right he leads us by his
[1:05:19] voice which is the word manifested
[1:05:22] for the age ain't that right so he will
[1:05:26] now listen now these Paths of
[1:05:28] righteousness now he it will never lead
[1:05:31] us away from Green Pastures
[1:05:35] he'll never lead us away from The Still
[1:05:38] Waters
[1:05:39] all along these Paths of righteousness
[1:05:42] is the Green Pastures
[1:05:45] all along the paths of righteousness a
[1:05:49] man is the Still Waters
[1:05:51] can you say Amen
[1:05:53] but now notice that the two paths
[1:05:55] because uh uh Jeremiah 21 8 it says unto
[1:06:01] this people Thou shalt say thus saith
[1:06:04] the Lord behold I set before you the way
[1:06:07] of life and the way of death
[1:06:10] so in all reality there are two paths to
[1:06:13] walk down
[1:06:15] in Matthew 7 and 13 Jesus talks about
[1:06:19] these two paths he says enter ye in at
[1:06:22] the Straight Gate for wide is the gate
[1:06:25] and Broad is the way that lead us to
[1:06:27] destruction and many everybody say many
[1:06:30] there be which go in there at
[1:06:34] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:06:37] is the way which lead us unto life and
[1:06:41] view there be that find it now I'm going
[1:06:45] to say this that only the predestinator
[1:06:47] is going to find it
[1:06:49] only the Sheep is going to find it and
[1:06:52] as I've said before you didn't stumble
[1:06:54] on these green paths you didn't stumble
[1:06:56] amen uh beside the Still Waters you just
[1:06:59] didn't happen to come here he leads me
[1:07:02] in the paths of righteousness can you
[1:07:06] say man it's just that way see and so
[1:07:09] they they find it because the Lord is
[1:07:12] their Shepherd and it is him that leads
[1:07:15] it and and his sheep have the desire to
[1:07:19] know and they pray a man to know his
[1:07:22] paths can you say man look look at David
[1:07:26] Psalms 25 and 4 show me thy ways O Lord
[1:07:30] now this is the Sheep talking to God the
[1:07:33] shepherd show me thy ways O Lord so
[1:07:36] again the relationship is is not a
[1:07:39] cowboy and Rodeo we we ain't talking
[1:07:41] about this this is people that are uh uh
[1:07:45] that are willing that are subjection uh
[1:07:48] subjective that are Desiring amen the
[1:07:51] way of the Lord and so he says show me
[1:07:54] thy ways I O Lord teach me thy paths
[1:07:58] Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for
[1:08:04] thou art the god of my salvation on thee
[1:08:08] do I wait all the day can you say man so
[1:08:13] if you'll notice these two paths have
[1:08:16] been given various names in the Bible
[1:08:18] and and uh uh we just read one where uh
[1:08:23] uh uh uh one is is is a broad path uh
[1:08:28] that many walk down this path and the
[1:08:31] other one is a narrow path that very few
[1:08:33] uh will find a man and and so this broad
[1:08:38] path leads to destruction The Narrow
[1:08:41] Path leads to life ain't that right and
[1:08:45] so according to Proverbs 2 13 the broad
[1:08:49] path is the ways of Darkness
[1:08:52] a man which is totally different from
[1:08:56] the paths of righteousness so this broad
[1:09:00] path is is a way of darkness and the
[1:09:03] other is the paths of righteousness and
[1:09:06] if you look John 8 and 12 Jesus said I
[1:09:09] am the light of the world now he's
[1:09:11] already told us that he is the great
[1:09:13] Shepherd ain't that rhyme he's our
[1:09:15] Shepherd do you all believe that that
[1:09:16] Jesus Is Our Shepherd now he's telling
[1:09:19] us I'm the light now your Shepherd
[1:09:21] brother Bill is the light of the world
[1:09:24] Amen see and he that followeth me
[1:09:27] everybody say he that followeth me shall
[1:09:31] not walk in darkness so that's a
[1:09:33] guarantee that you will not walk the
[1:09:36] path of Darkness if the Lord is your
[1:09:39] Shepherd ain't that right but shall have
[1:09:42] the light of life amen praise the Lord
[1:09:45] so in first John 1 6 John puts a
[1:09:50] distinction between the two paths by
[1:09:52] saying if we say that we have fellowship
[1:09:55] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[1:09:59] do not the truth
[1:10:01] ain't that right now David called that
[1:10:04] path in one place uh uh well he he says
[1:10:08] here uh Psalms 25 5 in his prayer again
[1:10:11] he says Lead Me in thy truth can you say
[1:10:15] Amen so Lead Me in thy truth you're
[1:10:18] walking in truth you're not lying
[1:10:21] can you say Amen if you're walking in
[1:10:24] truth that that your conduct your nature
[1:10:27] your behavior your your habits a man is
[1:10:30] it's it's all about truth
[1:10:33] hello it's reflecting a man the the path
[1:10:37] that you're walking down in and so if
[1:10:40] we're saying we have fellowship with him
[1:10:42] and we're walking in darkness then we're
[1:10:45] lying wait you're not walking in that
[1:10:48] path of Truth
[1:10:50] ain't that right and you're not doing
[1:10:52] the truth
[1:10:54] yes sir I think it'd be whose and us to
[1:10:58] find what path and to make sure we're
[1:11:00] walking in the right path
[1:11:02] this isn't the time to to just be
[1:11:05] floating around this isn't the time Amen
[1:11:08] to and and I'm not saying that you're
[1:11:11] not walking in the path I'm just saying
[1:11:13] let's be sober
[1:11:15] ain't that right we got to be sober
[1:11:18] about these things it's just not living
[1:11:20] every day and and bypassing time and
[1:11:23] until the Lord comes we must live sober
[1:11:30] now the path of righteousness
[1:11:34] I believe is the same path that Jesus
[1:11:36] said is the Narrow Path
[1:11:38] and it's the path of Truth
[1:11:41] David says Lead Me in thy truth
[1:11:44] and you say man
[1:11:46] so again if we say that we have
[1:11:48] fellowship and walk in darkness we lie
[1:11:51] and do not the truth now notice notice
[1:11:54] the warning that God gives us
[1:11:57] proverbs 4 and 14 enter not everybody's
[1:12:01] saying or not
[1:12:02] into the path of the wicked
[1:12:05] and go not in the way of evil men
[1:12:09] avoid it
[1:12:11] pass by pass not by it
[1:12:15] turn from it pass away and you say man
[1:12:19] you understand this he's he's he's he's
[1:12:22] he's telling us don't just go happy go
[1:12:24] lucky through life
[1:12:26] amen there's two paths One path avoid
[1:12:30] One path shun One path get away from
[1:12:34] flee with all that's within you
[1:12:38] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:12:41] now notice 16th verse for they sleep not
[1:12:44] except they have done mischief
[1:12:47] and their sleep is taken away unless
[1:12:50] they call some to fall
[1:12:52] for they eat the bread of wickedness now
[1:12:56] Jesus said he is our bread
[1:12:58] and you say man so we're not eating the
[1:13:01] bread of weakness wickedness but those
[1:13:03] that are walking in this path of
[1:13:06] wickedness is eating the bread of
[1:13:09] wickedness and drink the wine of
[1:13:12] violence
[1:13:14] but notice but the path of the just
[1:13:18] is as The Shining Light
[1:13:21] that shine is more and more unto a
[1:13:24] perfect day
[1:13:27] can you say man
[1:13:29] a a a day of finale
[1:13:33] a day of realization
[1:13:35] a day when everything that is in the
[1:13:38] scripture is being fulfilled
[1:13:40] and you say man a perfect day
[1:13:43] yes sir and The Way of the Wicked is as
[1:13:47] Darkness
[1:13:48] so this path is a path of Darkness it's
[1:13:51] the path of of of wickedness amen and
[1:13:55] it's the Way of the Wicked is as
[1:13:58] Darkness they know not at what they
[1:14:01] stumble
[1:14:03] ain't that right
[1:14:05] so again inner not into the path of the
[1:14:07] wicked and go not in the way of evil men
[1:14:11] avoid it pass not by it turn from and
[1:14:15] and pass away don't take on their habits
[1:14:21] then you say man don't take on their way
[1:14:25] of life
[1:14:27] don't don't come under their umbrella so
[1:14:31] to speak don't come form to their ways
[1:14:35] their thought pattern their lifestyle
[1:14:39] it's not the path for you
[1:14:44] and you say Amen
[1:14:46] it's a way of Darkness it's a it's an
[1:14:49] evil way
[1:14:51] now listen those that walk that path
[1:14:55] are anointed with the different
[1:14:56] anointing than what you're Anointed with
[1:15:00] they are under the control of a
[1:15:02] different power than what you uh what
[1:15:06] power you are under
[1:15:08] for theirs is the power of Darkness
[1:15:10] that's what Paul's saying it's a power
[1:15:12] of Darkness
[1:15:14] can you say amen amen so shun that path
[1:15:19] there's an anointing in that path that
[1:15:22] you don't want to come under
[1:15:27] you think people are doing what they're
[1:15:29] doing just because
[1:15:30] no it's an anointing upon them
[1:15:35] sure is
[1:15:37] their spirit is a different spirit
[1:15:40] than what God's people have
[1:15:43] God's people has a sheep like nature
[1:15:47] they have a a a holy spirit can you say
[1:15:50] man
[1:15:51] you young people might say well you know
[1:15:53] uh people I work with people I hang out
[1:15:56] with people I whatever you know they're
[1:15:58] all Christians they they've all say
[1:16:00] they've had a real experience with God
[1:16:02] they talk about God all the time tell
[1:16:04] others about God and and all these
[1:16:06] things and that's great but let me tell
[1:16:08] you something right now
[1:16:11] we're not ignorant
[1:16:15] of what goes on in the world
[1:16:21] and the only reason why is we've had a
[1:16:23] prophet
[1:16:25] identified the two Spirits in this age
[1:16:29] can you say Amen
[1:16:30] and I'll tell you this only everybody
[1:16:33] say only the elect
[1:16:36] will have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:38] only the elect will have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] and you say Amen only the elect will
[1:16:44] have their soul restored only the elect
[1:16:48] will be feeding off a uh uh the Green
[1:16:50] Pastures only the elect will be planted
[1:16:54] and be led by The Still Waters only the
[1:16:58] elect will be led in the paths of
[1:17:01] righteousness
[1:17:03] and you say man
[1:17:05] you say well what is the Holy Ghost you
[1:17:07] know what the Holy Ghost is it's the
[1:17:09] spirit of Truth
[1:17:11] ain't that right your Shepherd is the
[1:17:14] spirit of Truth
[1:17:16] ain't that right now notice John 16 13
[1:17:19] will will verify this how be it when he
[1:17:23] the person Christ the spirit of Truth is
[1:17:27] come he will guide you in not truth
[1:17:33] all truth
[1:17:36] and you say man the spirit of Truth when
[1:17:40] he comes he will guide you not in part
[1:17:43] truth some truth all truth everybody say
[1:17:48] all truth
[1:17:49] your Shepherd is going to lead you in
[1:17:52] the paths of righteousness
[1:17:54] and he ain't going to lead you part way
[1:17:56] and then steer you off he's going to
[1:17:59] lead you in all the path of
[1:18:01] righteousness all truth
[1:18:06] and you say man
[1:18:08] now notice
[1:18:11] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:18:13] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:18:16] speak and he will show you things to
[1:18:18] come
[1:18:20] so who's your Shepherd who's your leader
[1:18:22] the spirit of Truth
[1:18:25] he's the one that's going to walk you
[1:18:27] and lead you go before you
[1:18:30] in the paths of righteousness
[1:18:33] he's the one that's going to light your
[1:18:35] way
[1:18:36] for he said I am the light of the world
[1:18:39] ain't that right
[1:18:41] and here now he's saying when he comes
[1:18:44] to you
[1:18:45] he's going to lead you into truth
[1:18:47] all truth
[1:18:49] ain't that right now notice John 16 15.
[1:18:53] Jesus said all thing that the all things
[1:18:55] that the father hath are mine therefore
[1:18:59] said I that he shall take of mine and
[1:19:02] shall show it unto you
[1:19:04] who sheep
[1:19:08] gotta have something to feed off of
[1:19:12] so he's gonna feed you
[1:19:15] but not only is he going to feed you
[1:19:16] he's going to show these things unto you
[1:19:18] in other words he's showing you the
[1:19:21] paths of righteousness
[1:19:23] he's leading you in the path
[1:19:28] you're not going to show you some you
[1:19:30] know gimmick
[1:19:32] you're not going to just show you
[1:19:33] something that man conjured up he's
[1:19:36] going to show you the things to come
[1:19:37] that are the truth
[1:19:42] now if you look at it in John 17 17
[1:19:45] Jesus said Thy word is truth
[1:19:47] ain't that right
[1:19:49] so so here he will lead you and guide
[1:19:52] you into all truth
[1:19:55] all everybody say all
[1:19:57] the word
[1:19:59] all the word
[1:20:01] opening of the book all the word can you
[1:20:05] say man
[1:20:06] so now we're walking in these Paths of
[1:20:09] righteousness see and so he leads us in
[1:20:13] the paths of righteousness which is the
[1:20:16] path of Truth which is the word of God
[1:20:20] I hope you understand
[1:20:22] now how how would we know as to whether
[1:20:25] or not it was the word unless it was
[1:20:28] clearly thoroughly Vindicated of God and
[1:20:32] proven that it is the truth aren't you
[1:20:35] glad that God would prove it and
[1:20:36] Vindicated and thoroughly Vindicated so
[1:20:39] that we would not have to guess and
[1:20:41] wonder what is the truth there is so
[1:20:44] much deception out here and so much a
[1:20:46] fake and fraud and and impersonations
[1:20:50] and all of that but God would thoroughly
[1:20:52] vindicate it that we would know whether
[1:20:55] or not we're walking in the path of
[1:20:58] righteousness
[1:21:02] now if you look second Corinthians 3 and
[1:21:05] 17 it says now the Lord
[1:21:10] he is that spirit
[1:21:12] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:21:14] there is Liberty
[1:21:17] now I'm going to tell you this
[1:21:19] amen this scripture means much to us
[1:21:22] The Lord Is Our Shepherd
[1:21:25] the Lord is the spirit of Truth
[1:21:28] and the Lord is that Spirit of Liberty
[1:21:32] can you say Amen so if you're walking
[1:21:35] and you're following the Lord your
[1:21:37] Shepherd there will be a liberty to
[1:21:40] believe the truth
[1:21:41] there will be a liberty to walk in the
[1:21:44] paths of righteousness there will be a
[1:21:47] liberty to say Amen to the word of God
[1:21:49] all the word of God can you say Amen see
[1:21:53] so there is Liberty to see into all the
[1:21:56] things that have been shown or revealed
[1:21:59] to us
[1:22:00] ain't that right there is Liberty to
[1:22:03] receive what has been shown in the paths
[1:22:07] of righteousness you're not walking in
[1:22:09] darkness these Paths of righteousness is
[1:22:12] not a path or a way of Darkness but
[1:22:15] there is light in that path that you can
[1:22:18] see in other words it's a path of
[1:22:21] Revelation
[1:22:23] I hope you understand
[1:22:25] so there is Liberty to receive amen what
[1:22:28] has been shown in the path of
[1:22:30] righteousness what is it to have why why
[1:22:33] would we want the spirit of truth if we
[1:22:35] cannot see the truth why why would he
[1:22:38] lead us and say I'm your spirit of Truth
[1:22:40] and where the Lord is there is Liberty I
[1:22:42] am your Liberty and yet we look and say
[1:22:44] well I don't believe it I can't see it I
[1:22:48] just don't understand it
[1:22:51] so the Lord couldn't even walk us if if
[1:22:53] that be the case then it becomes a way
[1:22:55] of Darkness to us
[1:22:57] if you're blind I I don't care I don't
[1:23:00] care how much light there is around us
[1:23:02] if we're blind we're blind
[1:23:05] you're gonna need to be led you're
[1:23:06] you're you you're going to walk you're
[1:23:08] gonna in darkness you're going to
[1:23:10] stumble around but God's people ain't
[1:23:12] blind
[1:23:14] can you say man we're not blind to this
[1:23:16] word this word has been open to us
[1:23:20] under the seventh seal can you say Amen
[1:23:23] I hope this makes sense to you there is
[1:23:27] Liberty to walk in the paths of
[1:23:29] righteousness
[1:23:31] can you say Amen the paths of
[1:23:34] righteousness has to do with this word
[1:23:38] can you say Amen the past the walking in
[1:23:41] the paths of righteousness has to do
[1:23:43] with light
[1:23:45] it has to do with you having Liberty to
[1:23:47] walk in it it has to do with God opening
[1:23:51] your eyes to see it
[1:23:52] to open in your ears to understand it
[1:23:57] can you say Amen
[1:23:58] to believe so then here we are
[1:24:03] a woman cannot have the Holy Ghost the
[1:24:06] spirit of Truth Spirit of Liberty and
[1:24:09] then refuse to come subject to the word
[1:24:11] of God
[1:24:15] you know
[1:24:17] that's true
[1:24:21] a holy ghost-filled woman will not wear
[1:24:23] skimpy clothes
[1:24:24] that causes men to left ass to her
[1:24:27] I don't care what experience she says
[1:24:30] she's got
[1:24:33] the Holy Ghost
[1:24:35] will not allow her to put on them
[1:24:38] give me clothes
[1:24:39] to have the sons of God to fall after
[1:24:42] her
[1:24:43] it ain't going to happen
[1:24:46] hello
[1:24:48] you say oh give them time give them time
[1:24:50] give them time I have you to know
[1:24:52] brother Brown said there was heathen
[1:24:55] women that were undressed
[1:24:59] Expo exposed in the upper part of their
[1:25:03] body
[1:25:04] didn't know no better wasn't talked but
[1:25:08] when they came into the presence of God
[1:25:11] they covered themselves up
[1:25:15] I think that's what people need more
[1:25:17] today is coming into the presence of God
[1:25:20] education ain't gonna do it God will do
[1:25:23] it
[1:25:27] ain't that right
[1:25:29] you can't grow out of your temper you
[1:25:31] can't grow out of of your pride you
[1:25:34] can't grow out of rebellion it's got to
[1:25:37] take God to deliver you from them things
[1:25:40] that's right so a holy ghost-filled
[1:25:43] woman will not wear tight clothes that
[1:25:46] shows her form
[1:25:49] can you say man
[1:25:55] if any of you young sisters getting
[1:25:57] tempted by that you just tell that devil
[1:25:59] it's a lie that ain't me that ain't the
[1:26:02] path
[1:26:03] that I'm walking down on
[1:26:06] then you say Amen that's right a Holy
[1:26:08] Ghost Field woman will not wear shirts
[1:26:11] or blouse solo to wear her bosom show
[1:26:15] it ain't gonna happen
[1:26:18] I don't care how discouraged a woman
[1:26:20] gets I don't care how how uh uh uh dark
[1:26:24] in the valley she is the Holy Ghost will
[1:26:27] be there
[1:26:29] I just believe that and I thank God for
[1:26:31] you Elder sisters that still hold a
[1:26:33] conviction
[1:26:36] and it ain't because you're old fatty
[1:26:38] Daddy it's because there's a holy ghost
[1:26:40] there that won't let you do otherwise
[1:26:45] that's right
[1:26:47] she may be a nice woman maybe sincere
[1:26:49] but just flat honest she ain't got the
[1:26:52] Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] dressing like the world no it ain't
[1:26:57] gonna happen
[1:26:58] can you say Amen
[1:27:00] Amen brother Brown taught us we don't
[1:27:02] fashion after the world we don't wear
[1:27:04] Fashions of the world
[1:27:07] and that just we we I know we always put
[1:27:09] it to women but that's boys too
[1:27:11] can you say Amen these boys that are
[1:27:13] dressing like they're sissies it ain't
[1:27:16] got no right for a Holy Ghost Boy to do
[1:27:18] it just ain't
[1:27:20] can you say amen and and it's just the
[1:27:23] truth we're talking about Paths of
[1:27:24] righteousness there is there either a
[1:27:25] path of righteousness or there's the
[1:27:27] other path
[1:27:29] and and we're not stumbling our way
[1:27:31] through this thing you're not going to
[1:27:33] stumble your way and just happen to make
[1:27:35] it to Heaven There is a light that's
[1:27:37] lightened the path of righteousness to
[1:27:39] where you can see your way you know what
[1:27:41] you're doing you know
[1:27:46] and you say man
[1:27:47] that's right you know what brother Brown
[1:27:50] says that woman will have he said
[1:27:52] there's an honorary filthy Spirit on her
[1:27:53] making her do that and she don't know it
[1:27:56] and you say man we're not trying to be
[1:27:58] mean
[1:27:59] and that's not it we we ain't out for
[1:28:02] nobody I I wish people would get that
[1:28:04] out of their mind they think when you
[1:28:06] talk about you know something you they
[1:28:07] just automatically think oh you're
[1:28:09] talking about so-and-so that's not true
[1:28:10] we're just preaching the gospel and I
[1:28:13] don't care who it hurts it's just the
[1:28:14] facts I was listening to brother Brown
[1:28:16] today he said you got he says I don't
[1:28:18] want to say it hard I don't have to or
[1:28:20] or want to do that but you have to do it
[1:28:22] to to tighten the nail down
[1:28:24] and sometimes we have to do that maybe
[1:28:26] it's not in here that maybe someone's
[1:28:28] listening on that internet that's having
[1:28:30] some issues here and I'm telling you why
[1:28:32] amen it ain't got no place in a Holy
[1:28:35] Ghost Field life
[1:28:39] now brother Brown said some of the women
[1:28:42] put on these nasty clothes and get out
[1:28:44] here to throw their yourself before man
[1:28:47] Jesus said whosoever Luke of the born a
[1:28:49] woman to lust after her
[1:28:51] has committed adultery with her already
[1:28:53] in his heart then who is guilty the man
[1:28:55] or you
[1:28:57] he is a male maid so he could take this
[1:29:00] ax see and you're the female that ought
[1:29:02] to refuse and why do you put yourself
[1:29:04] out like that it ain't for comfort
[1:29:08] oh no
[1:29:10] it ain't for comfort
[1:29:12] you know it can't be
[1:29:14] when you're half froze to death with
[1:29:16] them shorts on can't be for comfort then
[1:29:19] what is it it's for Filth
[1:29:21] and you won't admit it but it's the
[1:29:23] Bible says so it's the truth
[1:29:25] can you say Amen
[1:29:27] and if we're walking down the path of
[1:29:29] Truth these Paths of righteous we can
[1:29:31] say Amen to this it's the truth
[1:29:34] ain't that right see it's it's it's a
[1:29:37] filthy Spirit that's in you you don't
[1:29:39] want to be filthy but you don't realize
[1:29:41] spiritually you are filthy because
[1:29:43] you're presenting yourself filthy
[1:29:48] and you say Amen the Holy Ghost filled
[1:29:51] woman will take off her britches and act
[1:29:52] like a lady should
[1:29:57] true
[1:29:59] Holy Ghost filled man we'll quit wearing
[1:30:01] them shorts
[1:30:04] brother Brown say that's that's that's
[1:30:06] that's
[1:30:09] well he said
[1:30:12] he said actually they're women's
[1:30:14] undergarments
[1:30:18] so he said you know uh uh Holy Ghost
[1:30:21] filled man
[1:30:23] he'll quit watching things that he
[1:30:25] shouldn't be watching
[1:30:27] he'll quit saying things that he
[1:30:28] shouldn't be saying
[1:30:30] and you say Amen
[1:30:32] see the Holy Ghost will lead people out
[1:30:35] of the denominations
[1:30:37] you can't tell me that they just sat
[1:30:38] there in them denominations that don't
[1:30:40] have a conviction about it if they've
[1:30:42] got the Holy Ghost
[1:30:43] because the age that we're living in is
[1:30:46] the spirit that is crying out come out
[1:30:49] of her my people and that Holy Ghost
[1:30:51] that came to you and said come out it
[1:30:53] cannot be the Holy Ghost and another man
[1:30:55] that allows him to stay in that
[1:30:57] denomination
[1:30:59] it ain't gonna happen
[1:31:02] and you say Amen
[1:31:04] if they're really filled with the Holy
[1:31:05] Ghost they'll come out of them
[1:31:06] denominations something will make them
[1:31:09] leave
[1:31:10] they'll have to go they're not happy
[1:31:12] ain't that right many claim to have the
[1:31:15] Holy Ghost and yet denied Jesus name
[1:31:17] baptism as being the truth and they'll
[1:31:19] tell you they talk about Jesus they
[1:31:21] witnessed everybody they just saw this
[1:31:23] and nice people I'm not saying they're
[1:31:25] not nice amen but I'm telling you they
[1:31:28] ain't got the Holy Ghost you cannot have
[1:31:31] the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of
[1:31:33] Truth and then denies the truth at the
[1:31:35] same time
[1:31:39] they claiming to be walking with the
[1:31:40] Lord and yet we'll reject the truth that
[1:31:42] a woman isn't to be preaching they
[1:31:44] reject the truth of Holiness and clean
[1:31:46] living and yet claim to have a real
[1:31:48] experience with the Lord
[1:31:50] they deny the fact that God sent a
[1:31:52] prophet to us in the day when it's right
[1:31:54] there in the Bible and has been proven
[1:31:57] time and time again
[1:31:59] it's a path
[1:32:02] they denied the truth that God still
[1:32:04] performs Miracles and does signs and
[1:32:06] wonders
[1:32:07] and you say Amen
[1:32:09] now I'll tell you this if a person don't
[1:32:11] have the Holy Ghost no telling what kind
[1:32:13] of a spirit they'll they'll they'll have
[1:32:15] they can come under any kind of an
[1:32:18] anointing any under any kind of spirit
[1:32:21] it's true
[1:32:22] and that's what's driving people crazy
[1:32:24] today is they they don't know that that
[1:32:27] that little boy was so nice he was so
[1:32:29] good maybe come out of a good home and
[1:32:32] look where he's at today a murderer or a
[1:32:34] uh uh uh a rapist or whatever it's
[1:32:38] because if you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:40] you'll come under some demonic spirit
[1:32:50] they're vulnerable to every demon that's
[1:32:52] out there
[1:32:54] and you say man
[1:32:56] a person without the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:58] vulnerable to every demon that is out
[1:33:00] there
[1:33:01] every spirit
[1:33:03] that's why parents need to be careful
[1:33:04] about what your children are listening
[1:33:06] to be careful as to what they're hanging
[1:33:09] around be careful as who they're hanging
[1:33:10] around be careful as where they're
[1:33:13] hanging around watch what they're
[1:33:15] feeding off
[1:33:16] keep them in the right atmosphere at all
[1:33:20] times
[1:33:23] and you say man
[1:33:24] now we know as the prophet taught us
[1:33:27] that a spirit can get a hold of a man
[1:33:29] and
[1:33:30] possessing
[1:33:36] make him cut himself
[1:33:38] and act like a maniac
[1:33:41] the Bible talks about it about the man
[1:33:42] of gathering
[1:33:48] but notice what brother Brown says but a
[1:33:50] religious spirit
[1:33:52] can make a man to where he is a shrewd
[1:33:54] scholar
[1:33:57] another place he said a religious sinner
[1:33:59] is the worst sinner of them all
[1:34:03] it's the worst spirit
[1:34:06] and the Antichrist spirit is not
[1:34:08] communist it's a religious spirit
[1:34:12] ain't that right
[1:34:13] brother Branham said the religious
[1:34:15] spirit all down through the every age
[1:34:17] has always been a denier
[1:34:19] a denier ain't that right it's the
[1:34:22] religious spirit that has always denied
[1:34:24] the real genuine spirit of God every
[1:34:28] time God's spirit comes in and and and
[1:34:30] with signs and wonders following the
[1:34:34] spirit of God that's religious spirit
[1:34:36] denies it he hates it can you say Amen
[1:34:39] remember Cain was the son of Satan
[1:34:44] that's why the prophet said
[1:34:47] and yet he was religious
[1:34:49] he had a form of godliness
[1:34:51] he built an altar
[1:34:54] right
[1:34:55] Bill Graham goes he built the church
[1:34:58] he built everything religious just as
[1:35:00] Abel did he worshiped God yet done it
[1:35:04] all without revelation
[1:35:07] ain't that right
[1:35:08] so you can walk the path of the wicked
[1:35:12] and be religious
[1:35:15] ain't that right but you cannot walk the
[1:35:17] path of righteousness without revelation
[1:35:22] you can walk the path of the wicked and
[1:35:25] be religious without revelation
[1:35:31] righteous path he's your light
[1:35:34] so there will be Revelation and what did
[1:35:37] Brother Brown say pray for revelation
[1:35:42] ain't that right
[1:35:44] so we find that Cain he was not an
[1:35:47] unbeliever
[1:35:50] yet God absolutely refused him the
[1:35:53] prophet said
[1:35:55] Abel had revelation
[1:35:57] and that made him just before God
[1:36:00] is that right brother Brown said only by
[1:36:03] revelation will a man be able to see
[1:36:05] Divine Healing only by revelation will
[1:36:07] he be able to see the baptism of the
[1:36:09] Holy Ghost everything is by revelation
[1:36:15] Drive
[1:36:18] I hope this helps you
[1:36:20] got to give the contrast
[1:36:22] so you can understand what righteousness
[1:36:24] is Paths of righteousness
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:28] now let's look at a scripture in
[1:36:30] Proverbs
[1:36:31] Proverbs 2 11 discretion shall preserve
[1:36:34] thee
[1:36:36] understanding shall keep thee
[1:36:39] listen to deliver everybody say to
[1:36:42] deliver
[1:36:44] to deliver thee from the eve the way of
[1:36:47] the evil man from the man that speaketh
[1:36:50] through word things
[1:36:52] Now look up that word forward it means
[1:36:55] perverse
[1:36:56] so to deliver thee from the way of Eve
[1:36:59] the evil man from the man that speaketh
[1:37:02] perverse things
[1:37:04] who leave the paths of uprightness to
[1:37:08] walk in the ways of Darkness who Rejoice
[1:37:11] to do evil and Delight in the
[1:37:14] forwardness and I looked up that
[1:37:16] fruwardness it means perverse things of
[1:37:19] the wicked
[1:37:21] can you say man whose ways are crooked
[1:37:24] and they are forward in their paths
[1:37:31] so notice the characteristics and the
[1:37:33] behavior of the man that walks this path
[1:37:36] of Darkness he speaks perverse things
[1:37:39] and he's left the path of uprightness to
[1:37:43] walk in the paths of Darkness
[1:37:46] he's made his choice
[1:37:50] you say Amen
[1:37:52] now I'm going to give you and I'm going
[1:37:55] to close here in just a minute but I'm
[1:37:57] going to give you some some things here
[1:37:59] but but so listen as we go the path of a
[1:38:02] brightness is a straight path
[1:38:04] it's a path of light
[1:38:07] revelation
[1:38:11] the word uprightness signifies that it
[1:38:14] is a straight path the right path
[1:38:16] so they've left the path of uprightness
[1:38:19] the straight path it's not crooked now
[1:38:22] now all of us you know uh bro Jr he's
[1:38:25] he's from the the flat land
[1:38:27] you go there in Ohio man you can see
[1:38:29] forever you know I uh uh says tell me
[1:38:33] says Jim we'd love to go for drive but
[1:38:35] you know when you step out of the house
[1:38:36] you just about see everything so instead
[1:38:39] of wasting gas we just we just get get
[1:38:41] out and look around say oh that was nice
[1:38:44] now let's go back in
[1:38:47] yo but around here you have to go for a
[1:38:49] drive because because everything's so
[1:38:51] crooked
[1:38:53] ain't that right I love going for drives
[1:38:55] it's relaxing but but there's a lot of
[1:38:58] Curves and and you don't want to be
[1:39:00] drunk when you're driving on on these
[1:39:01] roads right and so he's left this
[1:39:05] straight path
[1:39:07] to walk in the path or the way of
[1:39:09] Darkness
[1:39:10] so then that tells us the path of a
[1:39:13] brightness is a path of light a path of
[1:39:16] Revelation now Isaiah 26 and 7 The Way
[1:39:20] of the just is uprightness
[1:39:24] thou most upright does the way the path
[1:39:27] of the just can you say Amen now notice
[1:39:32] the the man the habits the the nature
[1:39:35] the the
[1:39:36] characteristics of of the man that walks
[1:39:39] in the path of of Darkness he rejoices
[1:39:42] to do evil and delights in the
[1:39:44] forwardness OR perverse things of the
[1:39:47] wicked his ways
[1:39:50] are crooked
[1:39:53] his paths are crooked didn't you say man
[1:39:58] when you can't you know you're driving
[1:39:59] down the road that's crooked you can't
[1:40:01] see too far
[1:40:03] yellow especially around here you don't
[1:40:07] know what is around the corner
[1:40:11] ain't that right and they forward the
[1:40:15] Bible says in their paths now I looked
[1:40:18] this word up perverse it's something
[1:40:20] that is turned away from what is right
[1:40:23] or good
[1:40:24] it's corrupt turned away from its
[1:40:28] original state or original condition
[1:40:30] ain't that right so here the man that
[1:40:33] walks in the way of Darkness Delights
[1:40:37] rejoices
[1:40:39] Delights in perverse things
[1:40:44] incredible to me because
[1:40:49] coming more perverse
[1:40:52] the human mind
[1:40:54] the lifestyle
[1:40:56] Society
[1:40:57] even our food
[1:40:59] politics marriage
[1:41:02] home life motherhood the way of life
[1:41:06] religion
[1:41:08] all of it is Tainted with perversion
[1:41:13] I'm still my wife I don't understand why
[1:41:16] these nominal so-called Christians
[1:41:20] and and even message folks that claim to
[1:41:23] be message
[1:41:25] are so wrapped up in politics
[1:41:28] as if something can save the world
[1:41:35] I just listen to brother Branham he said
[1:41:36] you can put every Lincoln in every every
[1:41:38] George Washington and all that in every
[1:41:40] County every office it ain't going to
[1:41:42] save the nation
[1:41:44] it ain't going to save the world it's
[1:41:45] sunk it's over it's gone
[1:41:48] it's perverse
[1:41:50] can you say man and I don't know about
[1:41:52] you I don't want to stay here much any
[1:41:55] longer
[1:41:55] I don't want to be a part of this world
[1:41:57] system any longer
[1:41:59] there is another kingdom that isn't
[1:42:03] perverse
[1:42:04] that isn't corrupt
[1:42:08] true
[1:42:10] got a president that's bringing all
[1:42:12] these homos and transgenders and idiots
[1:42:14] in our in offices that are running this
[1:42:17] nation
[1:42:18] God help us
[1:42:21] and you say Amen
[1:42:24] so notice they who walk the paths of
[1:42:26] Darkness speak perverse things things
[1:42:29] that are not original
[1:42:32] they're corrupt and they Delight in
[1:42:34] perverse things
[1:42:36] and if you'll notice this is the same
[1:42:38] path that Balaam walked in
[1:42:40] in Numbers 22 32 the angel of the Lord
[1:42:44] said unto him Balaam behold I went out
[1:42:47] to withstand thee because thy way is
[1:42:49] perverse before me
[1:42:52] he was doing something that was contrary
[1:42:54] to what God had wanted him to do
[1:42:59] then you say man
[1:43:01] that's the path that's that that's that
[1:43:03] broad way that's that that's that way of
[1:43:05] Darkness it's a perverse way
[1:43:08] Proverbs 28 and 6 better is the poor
[1:43:11] that walketh in his uprightness than he
[1:43:15] that is perverse in his ways though he
[1:43:18] be rich
[1:43:20] in other words we'd rather be poor and
[1:43:23] be in the path of a brightness
[1:43:25] then to have all the wealth of the world
[1:43:30] and walk a perverse path
[1:43:34] Proverbs 14 2 he that walketh in his
[1:43:37] uprightness feareth the Lord
[1:43:41] hello
[1:43:43] reverence respect
[1:43:47] but he that is perverse in his ways
[1:43:49] despises him
[1:43:51] despises the law of the Lord and He is
[1:43:54] the word ain't that right he's our light
[1:43:56] and they despise the light he's our
[1:43:59] Shepherd they despise his leadership
[1:44:02] come on church it's true
[1:44:06] he that is perverse in his ways despises
[1:44:11] him
[1:44:13] he is the spirit of Truth
[1:44:16] in Proverbs 8 and 7
[1:44:20] wisdom which is the spirit of God As We
[1:44:23] Know Cries Out
[1:44:25] saying my mouth shall speak truth and
[1:44:28] wickedness is an Abomination to my lips
[1:44:31] all the words of my mouth are in
[1:44:35] righteousness there is nothing everybody
[1:44:38] say there is nothing forward or perverse
[1:44:43] in them
[1:44:45] amen
[1:44:47] they are all playing to him that
[1:44:49] understandeth and write to them that
[1:44:52] find knowledge
[1:44:53] oh he leadeth me in the paths of
[1:44:57] righteousness
[1:44:59] Hallelujah
[1:45:01] now know this as we close back in
[1:45:04] Proverbs 2 now
[1:45:05] Solomon goes on to say that they are
[1:45:09] fruard in their paths
[1:45:13] this path of of of Darkness
[1:45:16] and and this of course is the path of
[1:45:19] the wicked now I looked up again that
[1:45:21] word forward in in that and and it uh it
[1:45:26] says habitually disposed to Disobedience
[1:45:29] and opposition
[1:45:33] listen now they are fruard in their
[1:45:37] paths
[1:45:39] and you say man
[1:45:41] this broad way
[1:45:43] they are fruard in other words
[1:45:46] habitually disposed to Disobedience and
[1:45:49] opposition in other words they are set
[1:45:51] to disobey and oppose
[1:45:55] now in Ephesians 2 and 2 Paul calls them
[1:45:58] the children of disobedience
[1:46:02] ain't that right and this is exactly
[1:46:05] what Israel the way Israel was in the
[1:46:08] wilderness
[1:46:09] if you look in Deuteronomy 31 27 Moses
[1:46:12] speaks unto the Levites
[1:46:14] says I Know Thy rebellion and thy stick
[1:46:16] neck and stiff neck
[1:46:18] behold while I am yet alive with you
[1:46:20] this day you have been rebellious
[1:46:22] against the Lord
[1:46:24] and how much more after my death
[1:46:26] gather unto me all the Elders of your
[1:46:29] tribes and your officers that I may
[1:46:31] speak these words in their ears and call
[1:46:34] Heaven and Earth to record against them
[1:46:36] for I know that after my death you will
[1:46:39] utterly corrupt yourselves and turn
[1:46:41] aside from the way which I have
[1:46:43] commanded you and evil will befall you
[1:46:45] in the latter days because you will do
[1:46:47] evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke
[1:46:50] him to anger through the work of your
[1:46:52] hands and Moses spake in the ears of all
[1:46:55] the congregation of Israel the words of
[1:46:58] this song until they were ended now you
[1:47:01] go into this 32nd chapter and first
[1:47:04] verse give here all ye heavens and I
[1:47:06] will speak and hear o Earth the words of
[1:47:09] my mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the
[1:47:11] rain my speech shall distill as the do
[1:47:14] as the small rain upon the tender herb
[1:47:17] as the showers upon the grass because I
[1:47:20] will publish the name of the Lord
[1:47:22] ascribe ye greatness unto our God he is
[1:47:25] The Rock he his work is perfect for all
[1:47:28] his ways our judgment a god of Truth and
[1:47:33] without iniquity just and right is he
[1:47:36] they have corrupted themselves their
[1:47:39] spot is not the spot of his children
[1:47:42] they are a perverse and crooked
[1:47:45] generation
[1:47:48] then you say Amen
[1:47:50] so by what we're saying that we can see
[1:47:53] that this path
[1:47:55] of darkness is the way of the rebellious
[1:47:58] and stiff net who speaks perverse things
[1:48:01] and delights in the perverse things of
[1:48:04] the world
[1:48:06] notice what the Apollo Apostle Paul even
[1:48:09] speaks of Satan there in second
[1:48:11] Thessalonians 2 and 4 who opposes and
[1:48:15] exalteth
[1:48:17] ain't that right
[1:48:18] who opposes and exaltes not politics not
[1:48:22] the church
[1:48:23] not not governments but above all that
[1:48:28] is called God or that is worshiped so
[1:48:31] that he as God sitteth in the temple of
[1:48:35] God showing himself that he is God
[1:48:38] and you say Amen so we see that this
[1:48:41] clearly is the path
[1:48:43] of Satan and his children
[1:48:47] Pride Rebellion against God himself
[1:48:53] then you say Amen they're forward
[1:48:57] delighting in perverse things not in
[1:49:00] truth but perverse things
[1:49:03] perverse things aren't truth
[1:49:05] it's a it's a what what would you call
[1:49:08] it damaged truth or perverted Truth uh
[1:49:12] something that has been changed from the
[1:49:14] original and you say man
[1:49:16] so remember the path an individual walks
[1:49:19] down is reflected in the character the
[1:49:21] nature the actions and habits of that
[1:49:24] individual
[1:49:26] so here we find
[1:49:28] um proverbs 10 32 the lips of the
[1:49:31] righteous know what is acceptable
[1:49:34] but the mouth of the wicked speaketh's
[1:49:37] forwardness
[1:49:38] perverse things can you say man
[1:49:41] Proverbs 6 12 a naughty person a wicked
[1:49:45] man walketh with the full word mouth he
[1:49:48] weakens with his eyes he speaketh with
[1:49:50] his feet he teaches with his fingers
[1:49:55] one commentator said his mouth is
[1:49:57] perverse
[1:49:58] his eyes disguise the words his lips
[1:50:01] speak
[1:50:02] his feet and hands call attention to the
[1:50:04] things better left unnoticed for in his
[1:50:07] heart are perverse and mischievous
[1:50:09] intentions
[1:50:11] ain't that right
[1:50:12] so a Proverbs goes on forwardness is in
[1:50:17] his heart
[1:50:18] he devises Mischief continually he
[1:50:22] soweth Discord
[1:50:24] therefore shall his Calamity come
[1:50:27] suddenly suddenly shall he be broken
[1:50:30] without remedy
[1:50:33] then you say Amen
[1:50:35] so the two paths oh we've made that
[1:50:38] contrast clear tonight
[1:50:42] as we will continue on talking of this
[1:50:45] path
[1:50:46] if the musicians will come
[1:50:50] Psalms 1 and 1 101 4.
[1:50:54] a forward heart shall depart from me
[1:50:58] I will not know a wicked person
[1:51:04] now when I read that it came to me what
[1:51:06] Jesus said there in Matthew 7 and 22
[1:51:10] that many will come unto him and say
[1:51:12] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:51:14] name and thy name cast out devils and in
[1:51:16] thy name done many wonderful works and
[1:51:19] his reply will be I never knew you
[1:51:24] I will not know
[1:51:26] a wicked person I never knew you depart
[1:51:29] from me you workers of iniquity
[1:51:33] and you know what the prophet said
[1:51:35] iniquity is is something that you know
[1:51:37] to do and don't
[1:51:39] you know to do it but don't
[1:51:43] you know what's right
[1:51:45] and you shun that to do something else
[1:51:48] ain't that right
[1:51:50] and if you notice Jesus goes on as he's
[1:51:53] talking about this workers of iniquity I
[1:51:56] never knew you yet they've got the
[1:51:57] credential I prophesied I spoke you know
[1:51:59] spoke in tongues I cast out Devils I've
[1:52:01] done these things many wonderful things
[1:52:04] and yet he would say no man shall enter
[1:52:08] into the kingdom of heaven
[1:52:10] that he that doeth the will of my father
[1:52:14] which is in heaven
[1:52:16] can you say Amen see there's a path
[1:52:18] there
[1:52:20] to get there
[1:52:21] there's a path
[1:52:24] and it it doesn't matter
[1:52:26] what all you do on the outward motions
[1:52:29] and signs and wonders and the devil's a
[1:52:33] Man cast out or the tongues he speaks in
[1:52:36] or the gifts that he has it does not
[1:52:40] matter if he's not walking the path of
[1:52:43] righteousness it won't take him to that
[1:52:46] destination
[1:52:50] where we hear the Lord say Well done
[1:52:52] thou good and faithful servant
[1:52:56] can you say man
[1:52:58] but you know what Isaiah 1 19 says the
[1:53:00] willing
[1:53:01] everybody say the willing
[1:53:03] and obedient
[1:53:05] shall eat the good of the land
[1:53:08] law willing and obedience not the
[1:53:11] rebellious
[1:53:12] not the proud
[1:53:14] not the stiff-necked
[1:53:16] not those that would literally walk away
[1:53:18] from the path of Truth
[1:53:21] path of righteousness to walk a way of
[1:53:25] Darkness
[1:53:26] and you say Amen and I would encourage I
[1:53:29] I would encourage
[1:53:31] you to read the second chapter of
[1:53:33] proverbs when you get home or when you
[1:53:35] have the time
[1:53:39] because here we find that we're
[1:53:40] delivered from those paths
[1:53:43] understanding discretion
[1:53:46] shall keep thee shall preserve thee from
[1:53:50] them paths can you say man oh do you
[1:53:54] love him
[1:53:56] I thought of this because in second
[1:53:59] Samuel 22 and 21
[1:54:01] David speaks of the reward that we have
[1:54:03] for walking in the paths
[1:54:05] of righteousness
[1:54:07] he said the Lord rewarded me according
[1:54:10] to my righteousness
[1:54:13] I thought that was pretty good because
[1:54:15] now David's not talking about his own
[1:54:17] righteousness
[1:54:18] but he has led in the paths of
[1:54:20] righteousness
[1:54:22] which is God's path of righteousness
[1:54:26] can you see man and David is showing
[1:54:29] that he's walking in that path for he
[1:54:32] says it's my righteousness
[1:54:35] there is the righteousness of the Saints
[1:54:37] then you say man
[1:54:39] it's it's something that we take on it's
[1:54:42] it's it's and and so there's that reward
[1:54:44] the Lord rewarded me according to my
[1:54:46] righteousness
[1:54:48] and if you look First John 3 and 7 says
[1:54:50] little children let no man deceive you
[1:54:52] he that doeth righteousness is righteous
[1:54:55] even as he is righteous
[1:54:57] ain't that right
[1:54:59] he says here first John 2 28.
[1:55:02] if you know that he is righteous
[1:55:04] you know that everyone that doeth
[1:55:06] righteousness is born of him
[1:55:09] ain't that right
[1:55:11] first or Psalms 106 3 blessed are they
[1:55:14] that keep judgment and he that doeth
[1:55:17] righteousness
[1:55:19] at all times oh my I love the Lord do
[1:55:23] you love him
[1:55:25] so here David's saying he's rewarded me
[1:55:28] he's rewarded me to my righteousness
[1:55:31] according to my righteousness and if you
[1:55:33] look at that he goes on and he says
[1:55:35] according to the cleanness of my hands
[1:55:38] he hath recompensed me
[1:55:40] for I have kept the ways of the Lord and
[1:55:43] have not wickedly departed from my God
[1:55:47] for all his judgments were before me and
[1:55:51] as for his statutes I did not depart
[1:55:54] from them I was also upright before him
[1:55:58] and have kept myself from my iniquity
[1:56:02] therefore the Lord hath recompensed me
[1:56:04] according to my righteousness according
[1:56:08] to my cleanness in his sight oh aren't
[1:56:11] you glad for that
[1:56:12] with the mercy that Wilt show thyself
[1:56:15] merciful and with the upright man that
[1:56:17] would show thyself upright
[1:56:20] and with the pure thou Wilt show thyself
[1:56:23] pure and with the forward those who are
[1:56:27] set to disobey and oppose thou will show
[1:56:30] thyself unsavory and that word unsavory
[1:56:33] is to wrestle to struggle in other words
[1:56:37] he will show himself
[1:56:39] to the the the uh perverse the forward
[1:56:43] to be their adversary
[1:56:47] he will be their adversary not their
[1:56:49] friend their adversary but when he has
[1:56:51] come in this day to the pure he has
[1:56:53] shown himself to be pure
[1:56:56] but it showed himself to the forward to
[1:56:58] be their adversary
[1:57:00] to struggle to wrestle can you say man
[1:57:03] he becomes their opponent
[1:57:05] and I've thought of this because
[1:57:09] as the spirit of Truth is coming this
[1:57:12] day what has he done
[1:57:13] he has set himself against their
[1:57:16] religious orders
[1:57:17] he has reset set himself against their
[1:57:22] political ideas and their perversion he
[1:57:25] has set himself against their wicked
[1:57:27] ways he has condemned it he has indicted
[1:57:31] them he has blasted it can you say amen
[1:57:34] and I hear all these you know these
[1:57:37] so-called Prophets prophesying men and
[1:57:40] women prophesying revivals on the way
[1:57:42] the Lord has showed me I saw this and I
[1:57:45] saw that and and Revival's coming you
[1:57:48] ain't seen a great Revival yet the
[1:57:50] greatest Revival is yet to hear a hit uh
[1:57:53] America hit the world and and you you're
[1:57:56] going to be a part of it and and and uh
[1:58:00] the bad days are just about over with
[1:58:02] and and on and on and on they're
[1:58:04] prophesying they're prophesying and yet
[1:58:07] I can see him uh in this day as he has
[1:58:10] set himself against them to be their
[1:58:12] opponent to be their adversary and all I
[1:58:15] can see is the wrath of God Amen on
[1:58:18] being Unleashed and and and slowly it's
[1:58:21] starting to trickle out of the gates
[1:58:23] amen but when he lists them gates up the
[1:58:26] wrath of God is going to flood this
[1:58:28] place
[1:58:29] brother Brown said you don't want to be
[1:58:31] here then
[1:58:32] because he's not coming as their King
[1:58:35] he's not coming as their lord
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:38] he's coming as their judge
[1:58:41] you'll be Angry Eyes Fire coming out of
[1:58:45] them eyes
[1:58:46] can you say man you'll be a god of wrath
[1:58:50] and he that is filthy let him be filthy
[1:58:53] he that is righteous let him be
[1:58:56] righteous can you say man do you love
[1:58:59] him I'm so glad
[1:59:02] that he has led us and leading Us in the
[1:59:05] paths of righteousness God bless you
[1:59:08] amen what song
