Hallelujah. My heart was distressed and each Jehovah thou strewn and low in the pit where my sins dragged me down. I cried to the Lord from the deep mighty clay who tenderly brought me out to golden day. Oh, he brought me out of the myy clay. He set my feet on a rock to stay. He puts a song in my soul today. A song of praise. Hallelujah. Now he placed me upon the strong rock by your side. My steps were established and here I'll abide. No danger of falling while here I remain but stand by his grace until the crown I gain. Oh he brought me out of the mighty clay. He set my feet on the rock to stay. He puts a song in my soul today.

I'm gonna throw a new one at them. So, we had some really good services there in Pennsylvania and um just wonderful. Brother Andrew was preaching about just how we can have confidence in this message and the confidence that God has in us that he would choose us to to be a part of the message. And uh anyway, just wonderful to think that God has confidence in us. For what earthly reason would the heavenly father send down his son to suffer rejection and pay for crimes he had not done. [Music] For what earthly reason would the father let him hang on a tree? [Music] I wept with the answer. That one earthly reason was me. [Music] I was the reason [Music] that one earthly reason. [Music] I was the guilty [Music] and he was the sacrifice. eyes. I was the taker [Music] and he was the giver, dying while I go free. And the one earthly reason was me. [Music] The fairest of angels were not summoned from his throne up in the sky [Music] to purchase my pardon. Not even the angels could die. [Music] The only provision for my freedom was destined to be [Music] the sweet lamb of glory and his only reason was me. I was the reason that one earthly reason. I was the guilty and he was the sacrifice. [Music] I was the taker and he was the giver. [Music] Dying while I go free. That one earthly reason was me. Oh, the fairest of angels were not summoned from his throne up in the sky [Music] to purchase my pardon. Not even the angels could die. [Music] The only provision for my freedom was destined to be [Music] that sweet lamb of glory. And his only reason was me. I was the reason that one earthly reason. I was the guilty and he was my sacrifice. I was the taker [Music] and he was the giver. [Music] Dying while I go free. That one earthly reason was me dying while I go free. That one earthly reason, his only reason was me. [Music] Amen. Are you glad that you were the reason? Amen. [Music] In Christ alone I place my trust. He is my light, mine. [Music] This cornerstone, this solid ground. [Music] What heights of love, what death of peace. [Music] In Christ alone my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song. This cornerstone, this solid ground, firm through the fierce drought and storm. What heights of love, what depths of peace, when fears are steal, when striving seas, my comforter, my all in all. Here in the love of Christ I stand [Music] in Christ alone who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless pain. This gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to save. Till on that cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was laid. Here in the death of Christ as Ann Faith and Branson comes now they're in the ground his body laid light of the world by darkness lame bursting forth in glorious day up from the grave he rose again. And as he stands in victory, sins cursed has lost its grip on me. For I am his and he is mine. But with the precious blood of Christ, no guilt in life, no fear and death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life's first cry to final breath. Jesus commands my death. No power of hell. No scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand until he returns or calls me home. Here in the power of Christ I'll stand [Music] my shepher. shepherd. He goes before me, defender behind me. Oh, I won't fear. I'm filled with anointing. My cup's overflowing. [Music] No weapon can harm me. I won't fear. Oh hallelujah. I am not alone. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's my comfort, always holds me close. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelu. I am not alone. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's my comfort, always holds me close. [Music] He always guides me through mountains and valleyies. His joy is refreshing, restores my soul. [Music] Mercy and goodness gives me assurance [Music] that I'll see his glory through face to face. [Music] Oh hallelu I am not alone. [Music] He's my comfort holds me close. [Music] Oh hallelu [Music] I am not alone. He's my comfort holds me close. [Music] He always guides me through mountains and valleyies. [Music] His joy is refreshing. restores my soul. [Music] Mercy and goodness gives me assurance that I'll see his glory [Music] face to face. [Music] Oh hallelu, I am not alone. [Music] He's my comfort. He always holds me close. [Music] Hallelu. I am not alone. He's my comfort. Always holds me close. [Music] Amen. Are you glad that you're not alone tonight? Amen. How many is ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we stand to our feet as we invite our pastor to come? We shall be changed. Oh, we shall be changed. [Music] Change from this mortal to immortality [Music] in a twinkling of an eye. Oh, we shall be changed. Yes, we shall be changed. Oh, change from this mortal to immortality in it twinkling up and I oh we shall be changed. Yes, we shall be changed. Oh, change from this mortal to immortality in a twinkling of sing it again. Oh, we shall be changed. Yes, we shall be changed. Oh, change from this mortal to immortality in the twinkling of an eye. Oh, we shall be changed. [Music] ity in a twinkling. Once again, oh, we shall be changed. We shall be changed. Changed from immortal to immortality in a twinkling of an eye. Amen. And aren't you glad for that promise? &gt;&gt; We are going to be changed in a moment, twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; It's uh trust you had a wonderful day today. The musicians can be dismissed and um it's good to be in the house of the Lord and be back home. Amen. And um we had a good time uh there in Pennsylvania to fellowship uh with the the people and I believe the uh brothers uh help the people there in their ministry and so we're glad for that and it's good to have brother Aean, sister Lisa with us. Amen. and uh uh just a a good wonderful time of fellowship and appreciate um uh Daniel fill it in uh for us uh over the weekend. And um what you uh if you want to turn to uh 1 Corinthians first of all the 15th chapter. Uh but I'd asked Daniel to um announce last Sunday that we're going to be moving our service next Wednesday, Wednesday night service to Tuesday night. So, November 9th, we're going to be uh having service on Tuesday instead of Wednesday. And um uh the family and I are going to be heading out to uh Oklahoma to Brother Wendle's uh uh meeting uh that's coming starting uh well, next next Thursday. And so u I wanted to um have service uh with you all before we left. And so uh so just remember that uh September 9th, next Tuesday, we'll be having service regular time and then brother Richie Douglas will be here the following Sunday um to minister uh the word of the Lord. Amen. So um I'm sure you'll be blessed by his ministry. Sure. appreciate brother Douglas and &gt;&gt; uh just got a wonderful spirit and loves the message of the hour and and uh so I know he's um always um um looks forward to coming up and ministering here at the church. Amen. So um before we go into the word of the Lord, may we just bow our heads and uh just ask the Lord to be with us. Father, Lord, we're so thankful for your promise, Lord, and that we're not alone. And no matter where we're at, what we feel like, and what we're going through, we have this confidence, Father, that you will never leave us nor forsake us. And how thankful we are of that promise. And Lord, we're just asking that you would just come and and feel free to to move among us this evening. I pray Lord that you would just anoint not only me but the the hearer as well, Father, and help me just to yield myself to you. And I pray that you would just take what simple words we would have and that you would just uh multiply it to your people. And father, give us a greater understanding of you and your word, Lord. Father, may our hearts just be pricricked. And Father, just to dedicate ourselves more to consecrate ourselves, Father, as we see the hour that we're living in, and Lord, we know that your coming is soon at hand. Lord, we just give you all praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh so, first of all, we'll read uh 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter starting at the 51st verse. But it says, uh, "Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trump shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. Then, if you'll go with me to Romans the 15th or the 12th chapter. Romans chapter 12. And we will just read the first two verses. It says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed." Everybody say transformed. by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Amen. You can have your seats this evening. And if I were to use the title, it would be we are to be changed. And um I'm I'm glad that we have that promise &gt;&gt; and we're going to be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye. And the word uh change it. It means to transform to make different to give a different position uh course or direction to. So to transform to make different to give a different position course or direction to now we know that change is not impossible because with God all things are possible &gt;&gt; and if there's anyone that has the ability to change uh the situations and to make change that's God. God has that ability to to change circumstances and he does it through his word through the gospel. Uh Paul would tell us, you know, that uh the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to them that believe. And and so the gospel is the word. It's the uh word made alive, living power. And so uh thinking of this power uh brother Brandon would call it the power of transformation. &gt;&gt; So we preach the gospel so that lives can be changed. Every one of us. Um the gospel should mean something to us. It uh uh the gospel uh has the power. It changes the sinner from the saint. It changes a drunk man to a sober man. It it changes uh um uh the sick uh uh uh to being well. It it's it changes and and and that's that's that's the gospel. And so it it it's to transform. And and this is what Paul is saying. Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. And and to transform something is to change it. &gt;&gt; In other words, be changed. Amen. If you're going to be transformed, then then he's calling to be changed. And so so in our opening scripture, Paul spoke of the changing of our body. And I'm so glad that we have that promise &gt;&gt; uh that that we're going to be changed um uh there. And so our bodies are going to be changed from mortal to immortality. Um uh the old is going to give way and the youth is going to be uh back again. The the gray hairs are going to be changed back to its original color. the crippled up limbs are going to be changed and and straightened and and uh uh all the effects of the the old age and and what comes with it, all that's going to be changed. Amen. And and I'm sure that as believers, we're all looking forward to that time. I I certainly am looking forward to the the change of of that. But that's not when our change begins. uh uh that is actually the finale of the change and so the changing of our body will be the final process and and it will be a very actually be a very small step uh to to the change that uh uh we we are experiencing and yes we are waiting for the changing of our body but yet the change is is actually happening now. Uh and and this is what Paul is talking about it to be transformed or changed by the renewing of our mind. And and and so we we we we not to to look and and say, "Well, one of these days I will be changed and I'm looking for that change." Well, the change must be happening even this present moment. And he's not just talking about changing from sinner to a saint. Uh uh I I hope that and you know and pray that we've all been there that we've all changed uh uh from a sinner to the saint. But the prophet as he's talking about that scripture, he says, "Now we have been saved as we are." Now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have, now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word. Amen. So, so, so I'm thankful to be saved. I'm thankful to have the the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but the change is still happening. It's a the transformation is still taking taking place. Now, we can look at nature and and see what Paul is is speaking of by being changed and and to understand what this transformation is like. and and and uh uh example it would be a a tadpo uh you know a little old uh uh creature, you know, uh swimming in the water and it's got a a heads got a little tail. It looks like a catfish and uh uh you know and it and it's it's it's it's abiding its time. It's it's waiting for the changing. But then then after a while something takes place. it loses its tail and and it takes on a transformation and and he's changed from a tadpole to a frog. Ain't that right? So, the prophet said he's transformed from one species to to another. And and this would tell us and that that the change that Paul is talking about this transformation isn't taking us backwards. It's actually taking us forward. It's a it's a process. It's a progress that that that we're going through a development. But it's it's a transformation. Ain't that right? And and so uh and and to think of this by the power of transformation, it it gives us a past. Amen. uh um u and and we could all look and and and say, "Well, I was a sinner, but I'm not that way now. I I was this, but I'm not that way now." Because the power of transformation uh uh something took place. And so, we can actually look back and we're not that as as present, but that is past. It's it's done away and we've moved on and and into a a a the present tense. Ain't that right? Uh this word past means no longer current. It's gone by. It's over. Ain't that right? So we sing songs, you know, like my chains are gone. Amen. and uh you know uh I'm no longer a slave to fear and uh you know uh uh different songs uh such as that. You may ask me, you know, uh why I'm happy. I'll tell you why. My sins are gone. Amen. So, so we we actually can write songs about what we used to be and say that's not what we are today. Amen. because it's a uh it's an experience that we have uh uh gone through by the power of transformation. Another example is the caterpillar. You know, you see that little caterpillar, you know, crawling around on the ground and and all that and and and to look at that caterpillar, you would never know by the outward. There's nothing about that caterpillar that that tells us about its future and that it's going to fly one of these days. But it has something within it, a law. Amen. That that it goes through a transformation uh to where that that when it comes out of its cocoon, it it is a butterfly. Amen. So what what used to just crawl around on on the dirt and get stepped on or or whatever or have to worry about all that of getting stepped on uh uh no longer because there's been a transformation. Amen. God would God would make nature uh uh things in nature that way to to testify of the transforming power that Christians uh uh uh will experience or are experiencing. Ain't that right? and and so um then then we find that it's the same caterpillar. Amen. But it's been transformed. So the power of transformation uh doesn't replace us. It it's not a replacement. It's not taking something and replacing it with another. Amen. But uh uh it's a transformation just like when our body amen is changed. um uh uh those that are left here for the tribulation, they they you know, the prophet said they'll not find our bones. They'll not find hide or hair. They'll not find any part of us because uh our we've been transformed. Amen. We're not just leaving our body here to rot and we go to another body. Amen. But but we are transformed. The the body is to be changed. a transformation is going to take place. Can you say amen? And so this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and and the the transformation will take place in a moment of time. And so the change comes by transformation which is uh um uh what Webster I believe says a metamorphosis. a metamorphosis and and that means a a change of physical form, structure, or substance, especially by supernatural means. A striking altercation in appearance, character, or circumstances. See, it's it's just a change, right? a a typically marked or and more or less abrupt developmental change in the form or structure of an animal such as butterfly, frog or whatever see occurring subsequent to birth or hatching. See, so so this this transformation is a metamorphosis or uh there and it's the same creature, it's the same life, but it's been changed from one thing to another. Ain't that right? Amen. A change. And so, Brother Bram tells us that's what's going to happen to the heavens and and the earth, you know, u uh uh second Peter 3 and 10. It says, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, and in the he in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the element shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up." See, and and and and so it's going to pass away. Heavens and earth pass away. And uh uh John in Revelations 21 and1 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there were no more sea. Ain't that right? And the prophet said it looks like an a total complete annihilation but it's not. It it's it's not that. And I I I uh you know how blessed we are to have a prophet to be able to tell us these things that of of the mysteries of of these things. And uh but the word passway actually uh there it means change from one form to another. &gt;&gt; Changed. Amen. From one form to another. Change from one condition to another or pass from one thing to another. In other words, transformed. Ain't that right? What what you was is no longer. It's it's still there. It's still the same thing. Amen. But it's been changed to something else. Amen. It's it another condition or or whatever. It's just like Lazarus uh when when Jesus called Lazarus to come forth from the grave and there he was with all the grave clothes on. He was bound and and Jesus told them, "Loose him." and let him go. Ain't that right? Well, the the the prophet said that's that's the same word for pass away. Loose him and let him go. He was bound, but now he's free. Amen. He's changed from one thing to another, one condition to another. Ain't that right? And so he says the earth is going to be loosed from Satan's grip. Amen. See, it'll be loose from politics. It'll be loose from denominations, uh, religious systems, and all of that. Amen. See, it's it's it's it's just a passing away. Uh, Brother Bram tells us that Satan is the ruler of of the earth, and he owns it for it belong to him. But now, Christ has redeemed it. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Christ has legally uh he's paid the price. He legally owns it now. Amen. And and the prophet says, see, Satan and sinners are to be gone uh for eternity, never no more to be. Satan cannot create. If he is, he's God. He can only pervert what has been created. And all perversion will be done away with. And death is the pervertage of life. And when the perversion is done, there can be no more death. Old age is a sign of death. And when old age has gone away, life comes in. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So all perversion, signs, and everything else is gone. Thorns and thistles is a sign of sin. The earth will be cursed with them. And and now they're done away with. See, it will be done away with. Sickness come by sin. See, a curse, but uh it'll be done away with. Death will be done away with. The bloodshed will be done away with. Aren't you glad for that? Another place, brother Bram said, when the holy fire of God sterilizes the earth with uh the chemicals, he has lifted his bride which can come into heaven with him while this is going on and comes back. The bride comes back on earth again. A new heaven and a new earth. Amen. Cold winter can't hurt it. The hot summers can't hurt it. The the the deserts will blossom as a rose. Sin and sinners are gone. God and his creatures and creation is dwelling together in perfect harmony. As the heavens and the earth is husband and wife, so is Christ and the church. And they all meet in one big glorious plan of redemption and is brought right back into the bosom of God again. Ain't that right? What is it? A transformation has taken place. Amen. A transformation. See? And so, but before that transformation of the heavens and the earth can take place, there has to be a transformation happen in the people of God. Amen. Uh and that's by the renewing of our mind. Notice what the prophet said. The things now I want you to notice. Amen. Now, listen. We are to be transformed. transformed. We're We're going to a a city. We're going to a place that's been transformed. We're not going to live in an old place, but the past will be gone. Old things are passed away. Ain't that right? And all things become new. But notice the things that you once thought upon to be precious, lay that aside and be transformed to something else. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, sinners have sinners thoughts. Christians have Christian thoughts. Sinner has a has a sinner life. Christian has a a Christian life. Ain't that right? Amen. And and and you can't blame them. Amen. There's got to be a transformation. Amen. See, and so why would God save us out of sin only to talk dirty jokes and and to keep hanging out with the filth and the the things of the world? Amen. There has to be a cutting off, a transformation. So if we're going to be transformed, then you've got to Amen. the things that you once thought upon to be precious, lay that aside and be transformed to something else. How many wants to be transformed to something else? Amen. I want to be transformed to something else. Amen. I don't want to be, you know, like these unconverted church members. Amen. that that claim Christ and yet their minds out in the sport world or uh their their heads in the television and and the movies and the entertainments and you can't tell any difference between them. There's got to be a transformation that takes place. Amen. So be transformed to something else. What you was one uh what you was one time to what you are now. See? Amen. We always, as the prophet said, we never want to look back in the rear view mirror. We want to keep pressing on, &gt;&gt; pressing on. Can you say amen? So many people want to stay behind with Luther, but we got to keep pressing on. Amen. Wesley was great. Pentecost was great, but we got to keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, by the renewing of your mind, that you might prove that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Oh, that's what we all want to know, how to do it. We are here. We love him. See, he saved us. And now we want to know what to do. Notice what he says. And we're trying to take a little step this morning to raise up just a little bit higher. Every day we want to go up higher. Can you say amen? We we we that that's that's every Christian, every believer, every person that's part of the bride. Amen. Their desire is to come up higher. Amen. And the only way we can do that is by transformation. The power of transformation. Now, God is not seeking to replace us for he can't. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He cannot replace us. Amen. See, in order uh uh uh uh you know uh uh uh the prophet says no one can take our place. Ain't that right? Amen. He can't take he can't replace us then. And so he's not seeking to replace us. Now notice in order for for transformation to take place, there has to be a seed. Ain't that right? There has to be a seed in order for transformation Amen. to take to take place. Well, we are the gene seed of God. &gt;&gt; How many believes that &gt;&gt; we are a gene seed of God, not by our choice, but because we're part of God. God is eternal. And if God is eternal, then we're a part of God. Then we've got an eternal something about us. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. That eternal equality about us. Amen. and and and it's an attribute of God which means that we are predestinated. Everybody say, "I'm predestinated. I am predestinated." If I'm a gene seed of God, I'm predestinated. You're predestinated. Well, then what is that? Then what makes us that way? Uh uh uh what are we predestinated? Well, uh uh uh well, we're predestinated to be sons and daughters of God. How many believes that? Amen. We're predestinated, Amen. to the adoption of sons. As as the Bible says, we're predestinated to be holy and without blame before him in love. We're we're predestinated to be the bride of Jesus Christ. Ain't that right? Amen. So then then if we're predestinated, Amen. to these things, then nobody can take our place. Amen. No one. The devil can't make anyone, Amen. The devil can't mar us and and scar us and and and and and uh so bad to where God doesn't want us. Amen. That's not it at all. Amen. If God ever called you, it's over. It's done. You're going to come to it. Ain't that right? Amen. Now, if if you say, "Well, you know, then that that gives me a chance to do whatever I want to." Well, Brother Brandham says, "Well, if you're that way, you haven't made that yet. You haven't you haven't connected with God yet." Because when you connect with God, you don't want to sin. You don't want to go out in them in in the honky tonks and and all of these things. Ain't that right? Now notice, we are predestinated. And and God would show through types and shadows of what we as the bride. Well, let me ask you, how many believe that your bride? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe your bride. Amen. Well, I want some hands. Amen. You You believe your bride? Amen. Well, then what does that mean then? Well, God would show us in the beginning when he made a man and woman exactly what he would do for himself as the as the groom and and and what we are as the bride. Amen. When God God took made man and then he takes woman out of man. Amen. And when man first sees woman, he says, "This is flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone." Can you say amen? She shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man. Ain't that right? Well, think of this as the prophet would tell us. We are to be flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. Can you say amen? Amen. Just as Eve was to Adam, so are we. But brother Brandon would ask the question, how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh? Now, think of that. That's a good question. Ain't that right? How is this flesh, mortal flesh, going to become his flesh? Well, he gives the answer as Paul would. Amen. In Romans 8:11, but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, it he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by uh by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Can you say amen? See, so the power of transformation, God's not considering the scars. God's not considering the past. God's not considering how bad we were and are or our mistakes and our failures. That's not the point. Amen. There is a power of transformation that can change that whole situation and make you a child of God. Can you say amen? Amen. Now the prophet says we did not become seed by rebirth. Amen. We were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn. Because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened. Ain't that right? In nonseed there is nothing to quicken. So the rocks aren't quickened. The sand ain't quickened. The dirt even isn't quickened. It's the seed that is quickened. Ain't that right? The seed. Amen. Uh uh and the seed is what is predestinated. Amen. To be Now, in the beginning, God said, "Let there be." You know, Abraham said, "Maybe God said, "Let there be an oak tree. Let there be a a a pine tree. Let let there let there be a a pecan tree." and and and he started naming amen that that you know all of these things. Let there be a cactus and and then he makes all kinds of different cactuses and and let there be a certain flower and the aelia and and all of these things. See? Well, see the seed is Godspoken word. Do you believe that? And so whatever God ordained that seed to be, that's what it's going to be. Amen. It's it's God's spoken word. God ordained it. God called it. Amen. And then he puts the seed in the ground. Amen. See, and and and God didn't place all those seeds in one place in the ground. He he he put it all over the earth. Amen. He put seeds all over all over the earth. Ain't that right? Wherever he desired. And prophet talks about how that you know there's some seeds can't grow in certain grounds. Um uh like like in the desert you got the cactuses and and then he says you know 20 you go about 30 minutes up the mountain and and you'll find the Sherman pine and and all that. And he and he talks he says there it took an intelligence to place all of the seeds where it should go. it it there would be no point in in in commanding a seed to become and then place it in the wrong dirt or the wrong atmosphere or or whatever. See, and and then it never grows. So God by his intelligence placed the seeds wherever he would he wanted it and where it would it would grow. It it would do. Ain't that right? Well, if God would do that to the natural seed, then he would do that to a spiritual seed as well. Amen. He said that he will have sons and daughters by his word. Do you believe that? He said, he promised that he would have sons and daughters of his. He said that he would have a bride without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. Amen. That's a seed. Amen. by his word &gt;&gt; said that there would be an overcomer who would reign with him. Amen. This isn't by chance. This is a promise. These are seeds that God by his spoken word ordained to to to be. Ain't that right? Amen. And what God said it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; What God said will happen. Amen. In Noah's day. Amen. God God said told them it's going to rain. He told the people it was a scientific age. Amen. Like it is today. And but he told the people it's going to rain. And and the people by science could could shoot something up in the air and they could prove it. They prove that there was no moisture up there. There was no rain. It was impossible for it to rain. Amen. See, but see, it came down anyways &gt;&gt; because God said it would. A ain't that right? Amen. The rain came anyways. Despite uh what they would prove and what they would say and and all of these things, God has said that in this last day, fire will come from heaven. Amen. Now, they say that'll never happen. There ain't nothing up there for that to happen. Amen. and see. But the prophet says it's going to fall just as God promised it. Can you say amen? He said, "See, that seed will take a hold somewhere." That seed's going to take a hold somewhere. Glory to God. And the only thing he's looking for today is a bedding ground. Everybody say, "A bedding ground." A bedding ground. Somewhere that it can bed. Amen. See? Amen. So, so now in in in in another place he says, "Now let the word start in somebody and they'll pervert it and spray it like Satan did Eve." It started in Eve for her to bed forth and bring forth sons of God, not sons of Satan, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Sons of God. But she was a bedding ground and it fell in the wrong place. So will the word fall in an unbeliever or a doubter or a skeptic. It'll make a church member out of them, but never a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; In other words, that seed can never come to transformation. Amen. Uh be transformed in an unbeliever, in a skeptic, in in in just a an unbeliever. See? Amen. See? So he says, "You tell them let their hair to let their hair grow, they'll laugh in your face. You tell them to do this, that, or the man do it." Amen. They'll laugh in your face. It's not sons of God. It's the wrong bedding ground. &gt;&gt; See? Yet they're holding the seed. They're holding the word. See? Amen. See the false anointed ones. They're anointed, yes, with the Holy Spirit. Speak in tongues, do signs and wonders, but it's of Satan. Ain't that right? Another place, brother Bram says, when you try to take the word of God and put it in religion of this world, you bring death to yourself. It kills the subject. Amen. That's right. It kills the life. See? See? You see what I mean? It kills the person. It uh you say, "Well, now look, you you believe in God and and oh, now you don't have to believe in that. See, you you our church. See, right then. See, that's the boom that kills the subject. You've got to let notice what he says. You've got to let everything fall aside. Amen. And take the word only. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You got to let everything else fall aside and take the word only. &gt;&gt; Let your your your feelings aside and take the word. Let the symptoms aside and take the word. Let go of the critics, what they're saying, and take the word. Don't listen to critics. Don't listen to anything outside the word of God. Take the word only. Can you say amen? You got to let everything fall aside and take that word only. Stay right with the word. Don't leave it when God said, "So, that's just what it is." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So God plants the seeds and then every seed has to be transformed in in in into the plant life. Amen. For God says, "Let every seed bring forth of its kind." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Got to bring forth. So the seed was planted by God. And now it's got to have a transformation take place to bring on the manifestation of what God called that seed to be. He planted seeds, but he didn't intend for it to remain seed in the ground. He wanted something to come up. He wanted a an oak tree to come up. He wanted an apple tree to come up and bear apples and an orange tree to come up and bear oranges and and all of these things. But it happens by transformation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so uh uh the seed, amen, planted by God's word and then has to come to manifestation. And that's why, amen, the Bible says the whole earth is groaning, travailing, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; There's a seed that's been planted. That's right. seed to bring forth sons of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. See? Amen. So again, God never intended for it to remain in seed form, but to be transformed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it. Aren't you glad you have that? to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was, it had to come forth with the power of life in it. &gt;&gt; The power of life is in you. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Power of life is in you. &gt;&gt; Now, the earth is the womb that God planted the seed in. and and he placed each seed in the womb uh uh with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be. See, and and each one of these seeds has the power within itself to transform itself into the species that God uh uh called it to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He put that power of life within it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God says, you know, that's what it must be. See, because I have given every seed transforming power. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to be seed? &gt;&gt; Seed of God. Amen. I've given every seed, Amen. Uh uh transforming power to make out of itself it its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be. You're not a helpless church. We're not a helpless people. I I you know, we just not. If the power is within us, that power of life, then the transforming power is already there, the potentials to be what God has called us to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the prophet said, "As long as it stayed in its right category, it would be just exactly what God said it would be." So it couldn't be mixed with anything else. Couldn't be hybrid. This is why brother Brown was such against you know screamed out against hybridization and all of these things because what usually in the natural happens in the spiritual but but we know hybriding is what kills. It's it it's what makes humans weak and and and a lot of defens deficiencies within our body and and the sicknesses that that uh uh that man struggles with. A lot of it is because of the the the hybriding that that we have done uh we we just messed with God's laboratory and all of these things. Ain't that right? Amen. But but for it to to to have transforming power, hybrid corn cannot reproduce itself. Amen. But an original corn has the transforming power within it. Amen. To go from seed, Amen. to uh to maturity. Ain't that right? So, Brother Bram said it had to be that way because he made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel, in his line of word, ain't that right, in his line of word, as the prophet said, God never did make a a donkey, right? Or a mule. It's a mule, right? See, it didn't stay in the line of word. It's it's not any it's a hybrid. They taken a donkey and a horse and made a mule. It's a hybrid. It can't reproduce itself. It's not in the line of God's word. Ain't that right? See, and any religion, anything that's hybrid is not in the line of God's word. It's It's got to stay in the channel of God's word, it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would. It cannot move from there. It's channelneled just exactly right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, not to keep you much longer, but in Genesis 1 and1, uh, it says that in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet looking at that, he said it was nothing but a complete chaos. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was &gt;&gt; nothing but complete chaos. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But notice what God did in in that condition. When it was in that condition and the spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "The spirit of God moved." &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "And the entire picture was changed, &gt;&gt; transformed." &gt;&gt; It w it went from a picture or a situation of chaos to a beautiful garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God brought forth a transformation. So God knew that he needed light. in order for the seeds to live. &gt;&gt; He had already planted the seeds and there was the darkness that had covered the earth and and and and uh uh and and so that power of darkness was holding that sea to where it couldn't be transformed into what God wanted to be. Now, we know as the prophet deals with it, light is the manifestation of God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be light." And there it was. &gt;&gt; That was the manifestation of God's spoken word. Ain't that right? Anytime God's word is manifested, that's light. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So therefore, God brought light to bring on a a transformation. The Bible says that God separated the light from the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was he doing? He making a way to where that light could shine in its full strength upon that seed to bring a transformation. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's how he's going to change the chaos, &gt;&gt; all this chaos and all that. But there would be a light that would transform those seeds and make it a beautiful garden. &gt;&gt; Make it a beautiful Eden. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and when light shines, darkness has to give way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; When light shines, that's why you walk in the light. Stay in the light. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Don't don't fellowship in darkness. &gt;&gt; That's why John says if we walk in the light as he is in the light, then we have fellowship with one another. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm finding that that that that these people that have left the message, you know, that instead of just walking away from the message, they're doing everything they can to find the weak ones and to pull them out. Oh, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, and and and and uh uh sad situation, you know, uh up there where where we just come from. and to see people that I've known for years and and now they're teetering and and I find out, you know, that they're they're fellowshipping with with some guy that have left the message and and and so he's he's just going around from all church to, you know, all the people in the church trying to bring him out, you know, and and and and and all these things. And I think, well, well, you know, you ain't to fellowship with that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You got to stay in the light. God's the one that separated light from darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And children of the light are not to have fellowship with the darkness. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and so we we find that that uh uh uh darkness when light shines and and then then then darkness has to give way. Amen. Darkness can never stand in the presence of light. It it cannot do it. The prophet says light is 10 million times stronger than darkness. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There's no reason for us to to go back in into the world. There's no reason for us amen to to give way amen from this message. The only way we could do that is we we we refuse to walk in the light and we accept the darkness instead. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. But when the power of light is shining, the power of darkness is broken. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brown says, "No matter how dark it is, light will put it out." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So So the sun is is the natural sun light is the king of all lights up on the earth. Amen. No matter if it's artificial light or or you know uh star light, candle light, whatever, when that sun comes out, he's the king of of light. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "And no matter how much artificial light that we can have and and how many electric rays, great electric rays, we can produce when that sun rises, all the rest of them dim out." He said, "And that's the same thing with the word of God. When it rises, ain't that right? When it rises, the light of the word arises, then all superstitions and denominational fanaticisms and things just spread away and it shows it just exactly what it is. People can rise up with this and that and or the other and isms can rise, communism, fascism and all other isms can rise. superstitions and cults, whatever it might be, might rise. Amen. But the king light shuts out all other lights. Can you say amen? Amen. And that's what God ordained was the king light. Amen. To shine upon the seed and transform the seed into what he ordained them to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. King light. I'm glad for the king light. Amen. And when the sun is shining, notice when the sun is shining, amen, the all the darkness is pushed on the other side of the world. &gt;&gt; It's pushed. It cannot dwell together. &gt;&gt; And when the sun comes in its full strength, where's the darkness? &gt;&gt; It's pushed on the other side of the world. Ain't that right? Well, it has to be that way. Amen. See, and and and and in order for the seed, Amen. to be transformed. So, so there there are people that live in darkness while there's other people living in light at the same time. Ain't that right? People living in light and people living in darkness. Amen. At at the same time because light and darkness cannot dwell together. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, it's the spoken word light that brings the transformation to the spiritual seed. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not denominational light, &gt;&gt; not uh seminary light, &gt;&gt; not not not all these other lights. &gt;&gt; And you can't even bring the seed forth from today from a glare of yesterday's light. &gt;&gt; It it doesn't work. &gt;&gt; The spoken word light is what brings forth the transformation. It's the only way, church, that the sons of God are going to be made manifested. &gt;&gt; It's the only way. And we're in the age. This is the time for the manifestation of sons of God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; We've been a mystery. We have been kept up a mystery in seed form. But now is the time that the sons of God are to be transformed into manifestation. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's the only way. The word light, king light. It's the only way for you as a believer, as a gene seed of God to come to your potential. &gt;&gt; It's the only way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we don't need to run from the light. &gt;&gt; We need to run to the light. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We We don't need to allow darkness to to keep us from the light. Amen. We want to stand full in the presence of the light to where the light breaks the power of darkness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. You would think that all nature would love light, but that's not true. You take the beetles, roaches, bugs, and things like that. Let the dark or let let let let the sun or flashlight or whatever let let the sun rise and they'll run for the darkness. &gt;&gt; Gream said that's the way the gospel is. When it flashes on, what happens to those who wants to call you a holy roller? What happens to those people who make fun of you? When the light flashes on, they shoot for darkness as hard as they can go because they're children of the night. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; John 3:19. And this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men love darkness rather than light &gt;&gt; because their deeds were evil. See, for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. See, but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, &gt;&gt; that his deeds may be made manifest, &gt;&gt; that they are wrought in God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, we're living in a day again when God is again separating light from darkness. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's separating it. And and Isaiah tells us of this. Isaiah 60 and1, it says, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come." Think of that. Arise, shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; For thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Telling us that there's going to be those that live in light and those that live in darkness. &gt;&gt; Those and and and those that are are living in the light are under a different power than those that are living in the darkness. A power has the a power over those that are living in in in the darkness. And light has a power over those, amen, that it's shining upon. Amen. See, and so notice gross darkness. Darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people. Brother Ram said, "This is the condition of the Leoysian age." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He says, "Now we're in the dark time, the Leoysian church age. man lukewarm not able to stand the things of God. Another place we're living in the last days at the closing age. See the Leotan age. One of the darkest ages that's ever been since the dark ages. A more hypocritical age right now than there was then. See, they had no light at all back then. But now this is a twilight, a a deceiving hour. Ain't that right? So, so then he tells us that it's this seventh church age, the Leoysian age that has gone into complete chaos. &gt;&gt; See, back in the same boat that it was in the beginning. Amen. In the beginning, it was a natural chaos. &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual chaos. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Just darkness everywhere. Why? Because Christ has been kicked out of the age, &gt;&gt; kicked out of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. And and notice now just so we does do not mix this up as some people are trying to do. Amen. Mix this up. Brother Brandham identifies this to be the Leoan this age to be the Leoysa church age which is the Pentecostal organization which all goes right straight into the mark of the beast. Right. &gt;&gt; We are not part of the Leoysian age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We're not part of the Pentecostal organization. We're not part Amen. of of of those going into the the mark of the beast. We're not part of that. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brown say we're part of a bride age. &gt;&gt; This is bride time. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, to understand that those people in the organizations and things, they're not bad people. They're they're good people and you know it and I know it and but as the prophet said, they're planted they were they were planted straight in a roll. Like brother Bram talks about the corn, you know, the farmer planted that corn straight in a row. See, and as the corn was growing, there was creepers that grew around some of the stock and pulled them down, &gt;&gt; right? They wrapped itself around the stock and pulled that stock down to where they couldn't grow like they were supposed to. And now they're deformed and and and and uh just just in a mess. And and the prophet said, "Satan sold the creepers called science, &gt;&gt; research, education, doctor's degrees." And sometimes they won't even let you in the pullpit unless you can produce a doctor's degree from seminary somewhere. It's all wrong. Not the people, it's the program that's wrong. Now, what uh what's it done? It's all headed up again and brought the whole entire world. Think of that. brought the whole entire world through a bunch of hybriding perversion of the original seed of God to another darkened chaos. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And instead of being transformed into sons and daughters of God, amen, they're just they're just become church members. &gt;&gt; They just become religious. &gt;&gt; They they just become, as Paul said, having a form of godliness. Amen. yet denying the power thereof. But the prophet says, "I'm so glad that God is mindful of us again, that he can still move upon the face of the condition he promised he would do it and call a little flock, which would be his bride." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? taking that deformationation and breaking the power of that thing, breaking Satan's power over our lives to where we can truly be transformed into what God has called us to be. Not sinners, but sons and daughters of God. Not bound for hell, but bound for heaven. Not bound for tribulation, but bound to the marriage supper of the lamb and the and the millennium. Can you say amen? Oh yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said out of that Pentecostal people see that Leoysian age out of that Leoysa Pentecostal. See he's pulling that remnant up here. Watch to show Jesus Christ. Not to reflect leotysa, not to reflect a lukewarm chaotic condition, but to reflect Jesus Christ. To show Jesus Christ, reflect his life just the same yesterday, today, and forever. Exactly when the evening lights shine. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And again, the darkness is being separated so that the light can shine upon the seed. church. How blessed we are to be able to lay and in the presence of not the sen or su n but the sen. Amen. Truly to be able to lay in the presence of God and watch the transformation take place in our lives. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm afraid people just don't understand what the message is about &gt;&gt; and so they get so confused about these things and what it is. But this message is our life. &gt;&gt; It's it's important to us. &gt;&gt; It's important to believe it. It's important. Amen. To ask God to give us the understanding of it, &gt;&gt; the revelation of it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Brother Brandham also likened the Pentecostal age, the sleighian age, Pentecostal age to that of the shock, you know, and you know how he talks about it, how it goes through the stages and then goes through that third stage of the shock and and the shock is gathered around inside of it is the seed that is developing. Amen. And then there comes a time that that all the life gathers in the the seed. All that life all down through that stock, it all gathers in that seed and then the shock pulls away. It dies. It It rots. It It just no good. It was used for purpose at one time, but now it's no longer needed. And and the now the seed is laying there in the presence of the sun to ripen. The the light of the sun, amen, is is shining upon that seed and is ripening it to its maturity. Ain't that right? And I say to you, the shuck has pulled away. I believe it has. The shook has pulled away from the seed to where we're no longer tied and bound in denominational this and denomination that and traditions of man and traditions of teaching and we are just simply taking God's word for what it says and believing it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Brother Bram says, "See why did it pull away for?" So that it would bring the grain in the presence of the sun to ripen the grain to a golden ripen &gt;&gt; for the master. Why has it pulled away? It so it causes heartaches and tears that they don't lay before the su but the sen to be ripened to the true full gospel. See, it brings a transformation to manifest everything that Jesus Christ promised in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are you one of those tonight? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Manifesting everything that God promised in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, there is a raising up a body today amongst the people. And there will be no more organizations. It goes right out into rich Leota. Can you say amen? And and and he says this, "The church age is ending now." And and and this was years ago. The church age is ending now. This is the hour. She's just about finished. And God's pulling his church. &gt;&gt; Pulling his church. Can you say amen? Come out of her. Right. And and so he says in the Bible, God told how Luther would do, what Luther would do, and how Wesley would do, and how this Pentecostal denomination will go into Leoa lukewarm condition. Now, did you notice that the Pentecostal denomination will go in to Leoa lukewarm condition, not the bride? &gt;&gt; The bride is not going into that lukewarm leosya condition. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We're fighting against that spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And the only way that keeps us from doing that is we're laying in the presence of the sun. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I hope this all right this evening. &gt;&gt; He said, see, so they the Pentecostal denomination will go right into the leoty lukewarm condition. But in the midst of that, he God would pull the people out. Pull his elect out. Pull that bride out. Can you say amen? Why? We're not part of that. We're the ones that's being transformed. &gt;&gt; God never intended Leoa to be part of our lives, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God never uh uh uh intended for this bride, his elect, amen, to be so wrapped up and caught up in Leosa to where they ain't powerless and formless and don't know anything about the power of God. That's not the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so he says God is taking the elect out of that Pentecostal church, that hybrid, pulling it out and watch finishing up the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The word come and the Pentecostals rejected it. &gt;&gt; But God is pulling a people out of that Pentecostal church uh uh and and to finish up his word. See, and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word. There comes the headstone crying grace, grace, amazing grace, the headstone. &gt;&gt; So arise, shine, rise, and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's calling for transformation. The seeds of God being transformed in this age. &gt;&gt; The light is shining. Arise. &gt;&gt; Come out of that dirt. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come out of that organization. Come out of the world. Come out of all of the Leoysia uh uh uh condition. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Come out of those things. Now there is no question in my mind that the message of the hour is the king light for our day. &gt;&gt; It's the king light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said at the opening of the seven seals, Revelations 10, and we're going to take our time for just a moment. &gt;&gt; The full word, everybody say the full word. is to be born &gt;&gt; into manifestation again &gt;&gt; and vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth. &gt;&gt; When at the opening of the seven seals, the full word is to be born into manifestation again. &gt;&gt; Son of man revealed in what? a bride body &gt;&gt; manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on earth. Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says the Holy Spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ. He is doing it by vindicating his word, a promise to her for this age, showing that it is Christ. If the finger is supposed to move in this age, the finger will move. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; If the foot is supposed to move in this age, the foot will move. If the eye is to see in this age, the eye will see. The spirit of God as it grow into the full stature of God is the age that we were living in now. The Holy Spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos. &gt;&gt; Why did God vindicate the message? So that we would believe it and be called out of the chaos. &gt;&gt; God so vindicated there should be no questions about it, right? No questions about it. That's right. See, and so we we look now that the light has brought the church. How long has it been since brother Brandham's been gone? And look how far we've progressed since brother Brandham left the scene. Even &gt;&gt; you know, people used to just just believe God sent a prophet. God sent a prophet and tell all the stories about the prophet and what they you know were with him and all these things and and but but the light has has progressed us. We've we've we've developed more &gt;&gt; the transformation &gt;&gt; by the light. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the light has brought the church further than what it used to be. Prophet said not Methodists, not Pentecostals, not some other denomination, but we are advanced. Everybody say advanced. &gt;&gt; We are advanced in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not knowledge. But that seed word seed that was God called us to be. We're advancing &gt;&gt; advancing. What I was yesterday, I'm not today. what I was 10 years ago and not today. &gt;&gt; It's an advancing. There's a transformation taking place. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And what is it? It's it's we're being transformed to sons and daughters and and and the full manifestation. &gt;&gt; Uh as the musicians come, Brother Bram said, "What does the transformation?" God does it by the spirit of his word. He transforms. He plants his seed, throws his spirit on it, and it brings forth the product. See, his holy spirit transformed the seed word in to be vindicated of its kind. And what kind of seed you are, that shows just what's in you. You can't hide it. Whatever you are inside, it shows outside. You just can't keep from it. You can't make that tree anything but what it is. It's going to be that way. The Holy Spirit transforms the seeds that's on the inside of it. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And remember, the Holy Spirit's moving upon the message. The message ain't making us sons and God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The sun doesn't make the seed an apple seed. &gt;&gt; It just brings forth what it is. It just makes a transformation. &gt;&gt; See, and so it he says the Holy Spirit transforms the seed that's on the inside of it. No matter what kind of a seed it is, it'll transform it. If it's evil, it'll bring forth evil. If it's a hypocrite, it'll bring forth a hypocrite. If it's a genuine word of God, it'll bring forth a genuine son or daughter of God through a think of man's filter. When the seed comes up, it comes up through that and it produces a son and daughter of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad there's a change that's taking place. Not going backwards, going forward. Not backsliding, not falling away, but getting more stronger and stronger and stronger. As Abraham, the Bible says Abraham though he got weak in his body, yet he was stronger in faith. Amen. Got stronger because he was nursing off the promises of God. [Music] Hallelujah. I am so glad I It's just the grace of God, church, that we have been introduced and brought into the very thing that's going to bring on a rapture. What What if What if we were out in the world? What what what if we were caught up in some denomination and sitting under a theologian or psychologist or whatever, you know, and and and having this form of worship and yet not knowing we we'd be worshiping the devil thinking we're worshiping God as the prophet said. That's what a lot of people are doing. See, we wouldn't have no hope for a rapture. We would have no hope for that to to make these promises live. But because he predestinated us, he had to bring a light &gt;&gt; to shine upon us to quicken the seed, to bring a transformation. I'm so glad for that. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham when he was talking about his ministry, he wasn't bragging. He wasn't anything, but he was showing us that his ministry tied with the scriptures. showing that this ministry was a spoken word light to shine upon that predestinated seed to bring forth a transformation and by it by it we're being transformed. You love him. [Music] Oh, it's Jesus. [Music] Oh, we'll walk in the light. Such a beautiful [Music] light. [Music] Come where the dwrops of mercy are bright. Just shine all around us by day and by night. Jesus the light of the world. Oh, sing it again. We will walk in the light, a beautiful light. Come where the dwars of mercy are bright. Shine all around us by day and by night. It's Jesus the light of the world. Oh, we will walk in the light, the beautiful light. Come where the dew drops of mercy are bright. Oh, shine all around us by day and by night. It's Jesus, the light of the world. Do you know that song? Shine on me. Shine on me. [Music] Shine on me. Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Oh, let it shine. Oh, on me. Let it shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine once again. Oh, let it shine. Oh, shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Oh, let it shine, [Music] God. Let it shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Can we just stand to our feet? Amen. And I'm so glad for the light to bring a power transformation on our soul. Amen. I think I think we I believe we feel that light shining upon us. I feel it. I feel that power working in my soul. I think that's what makes it so easy to believe in the changing of our body. If you if if if a man's not walking in that already and not feeling that power, it'd be hard to even fathom. It just seem like a fairy tale, you know, that one of these days our bodies are going to change and all these things. But see that power of transformation is working in us now. Changing us into more like him day by day, day by day. Can you say amen? I'm so glad to be part of it. God bless you. Remember service Sunday at 11:00. Amen. Come prayed up believing. Amen. And is there any announcements? Nothing. All right. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, we thank you, Lord, for the power that works within us. We would be cut off from that light if you hadn't by grace brought us to the light. Father, we'd be walking in darkness, blind, not knowing you, ignorant of your promises, ignorant of your power of your life. But oh God, [Music] we're having fellowship with the mystery of life. It's working in us, Lord, and we're so thankful for it, Lord. Thank you for your mercy. We thank you for your grace and your favor toward us, Lord. That we're your children and you're still with us, God. We love you. I pray that you would just bless the people that have come, those that may be sick and couldn't come. I pray you would just bless them. Father, bring us to your house Sunday safely, Lord. hands be upon us throughout the remainder of the week. Father, keep us all safe. Keep us under the blood. Father, forgive us of all of our sins and failures, our mistakes. Lord, may we look toward you and keep pressing the battle. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you is our prayer. Light from the lighthouse. Oh, shine on me. Oh, &gt;&gt; shine on me, Lord. Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse.
