Oh, behold, he comes riding on the clouds, shining like the sun. Oh, at the trumpets call, so lift your voice. It's the year of Jubilee and out of Zion's heel salvation comes. Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? Amen. [Music] my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. Can we sing that again? Oh, he knows my name. Are you glad he knows your name tonight? He knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. Oh, I have a maker. And he formed my heart [Music] before even time began. All my life was in his hands. And he knows my name. [Music] And he knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. Oh. Oh. I have a father and he calls me his own. [Music] And he'll never leave me, no matter where I go. And he knows my name. And he knows my every thought. And he sees each year that falls. And he hears me when I call. Can we stand and sing it now? Oh, he knows my name. [Music] And he knows my every thought. Oh, he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when. Can we sing it one more time now? Oh, he knows my name. [Music] And he knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. Amen. As they would just play softly now. Amen. I only got a a couple written prayer requests here. Uh we want to keep uh of course brother John and sister Kim Weekes in our prayers that the Lord will just continue doing the work for her. Amen. As well as Sister Martha, Sister Rhonda. Amen. And um we want to remember uh Sister Janet Payne. Um I'm sure all of you know remember Sister Janet, but her son passed away last week. So let's just remember her tonight. Um, we want to keep uh Sister Christy Tilson. Uh, she's uh been uh fainting and uh she's got a heart condition. So, let's just remember her tonight. Um, as well as brother Leonard uh Simmons. Um, let's just let's remember him tonight. I guess he's from West Virginia. So, let's just uh keep them in our prayers. How many has an unspoken request but lift your hands? Amen. The Lord sees each need. Maybe we could ask Judah if he would come and lead us in prayer tonight. Let's remember our pastor that the Lord would just use him in a special way tonight. Amen. Lift our heads tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, how we love you, Lord. And we come before you this evening with thanks, Father. Just thank you for all your blessings, Lord. Being able to meet, Lord, and just asking your presence, Father. We ask that you just come down and touch every heart here. Father, you see each hand that was raised. Lord, you see the need. Father, the needs that was read tonight. Father, you see each one, Lord. We ask that you just move upon the scene. Father, be with Sister Janet's family. Father, be with her. Just give her strength in this time of loss. We love and we thank you for all your blessings. Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. calls me his own and he'll never leave me no matter where I go. And he knows my name. [Music] And he knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. You can be seated as mom gets ready to come. Oh, he knows my name. [Music] And he knows my every thought. And he sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. Yes, he hears me when I call. [Music] You know, I know when the Lord does something for us like healing in your body, sometimes it's a miracle and instantaneous and sometimes he lets it linger, but it it's healing. When I say linger, I mean that sometimes it's healing and it takes its time, but it's still the promise. And when you accept that promise, you know it has to happen. And I was Sunday morning, I was playing a message and going back and forth while we were getting ready. But just as I happened to walk into the laundry room, I heard brother Brandham say to a lady, "Uh, sister, you with stomach trouble, it's over now." And to me, just little things like that's just the confirmation, you know, just continuous confirmation that it might not be right this second, but it's got to happen. So, I'm thankful we can rest in that. &gt;&gt; There are two roads you may take, one by sight and one by faith. Take the word of God over what you see. What you believe is what will be. [Music] So set your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's by grace. Set your ways to the winds of faith. What's your need? What's your cry? What's your mountain that's much too high? Speak the word of God and by and by [Music] it will move or you will fly. Just send your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in a higher place. Do not struggle. It's by his grace. Set your wings to the winds of faith. Just watch the eagle in the sky. He does not struggle. He does not strive for the power that makes him rise. It's already in the skies. Just add your wings to the winds of faith. You can fly in the higher place. Do not struggle for it's by his grace. Set your wings to the winds of faith. Just watch that eagle [Music] in the sky. He does not struggle. He does not strive for the power that makes him rise. It's already in the sky. Just set your wings to those winds of faith. were made to fly in that higher place. Do not struggle for it's by his grace. Set your wings to the winds of faith. Just set your wings to the winds of faith. We were made for that higher place. Do not struggle. It's by his grace. Set your wings to the winds of faith. [Music] Do not struggle, for it's by his grace. Set your wings to the winds of faith. Just set your wings to the winds of faith. [Music] Amen. Are you setting your wings to the winds of faith tonight? Amen. And can we just stand to our feet as we invite our pastor to come? I bless your name. [Music] I bless your name. I give you honor, Lord. I give you praise. You are the light, oh the truth, the way. Oh, I bless your name, Lord. I bless your name. Sing it now. Oh, I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor, Lord. I give you praise. You are the life. Hold the truth away. Oh, I bless your name, [Applause] Lord. I bless your name. Oh, in prisoners chains. [Music] Oh, with bleeding stripes. Oh, Paul and Silas. Oh, they prayed that night. Oh, and in their pain, oh, they began to see, their chains were loose. Oh, when they were free, oh, I bless your name. [Music] Honor, I give you praise. [Music] You are the life, [Music] the truth, the way. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] Aren't you glad that you have the ability to praise him? Amen. That you have a voice, you have a mouth, you have the ability to honor him with your words, with your hands, able to go to church and magnify the Lord, able to hear the word of God. Amen. We have a lot to thank the Lord for, to be able to bless him. Amen. Be able to bless him. think of many people that don't have the hands to raise and honor to the Lord and not able to have the voice and that oh God let me give everything that I have to you to bless you &gt;&gt; bless your holy name. Amen. The musicians can be dismissed. Um it's good to have everyone back uh that was gone over the weekend and um um I know there's sickness that's been going around uh but um we are overcoming that and so we thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um we want to uh keep Sister Kim in our prayer. Uh she's uh having some real trouble and um the uh um just her stomach feels full. Um but she's uh not eating. Can't can't eat much and um dealing with nausea and just not feeling good. And so they've wanted her to come back in and uh have a another CT scan in the morning. And so she'll be having that in Palasi. So just asking for our prayer that um God will just move on her behalf. And I believe he's going to I believe he is. And um it might not look like it, but he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm I'm just believing that. And uh we are a people of faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And um and so we um you know there's one thing to have influence. I was listening to brother Brandham the other day on influence and talked about how you know you can have influence with people and uh he said but the question is what is your influence with God? And I think if there's a people that has influence with God, that's the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And um I believe that when a a saint goes to praying, Amen. that everything just hushes up, Amen. and God begins to hear. And I believe the angels of God are sent on a commission, amen, to answer the prayers. Amen. Do you believe that? If you don't believe that, there is no use of praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible says that whatever you ask when you pray, you shall have. &gt;&gt; And so, um, I I just believe that. And so, we don't need to, um, uh, keep our head down &gt;&gt; and, uh, got to keep our chin up, as my friend used to say, the third one that is, and, uh, so we'll keep all three chins up. and uh uh just know that God's on the scene. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, how many loves the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Um so, let's go to praying in prayer before we go into the word. And uh let's just ask God to be with us tonight and also be with sister Kim. Father, oh gracious God, we approach you not as beggars but as your children that you forneew before the foundation of the world and through all of time you have been working for to this day Lord you have sent redeemer you've come in flesh to redeem redeem us that you might live in us. And Father, that as you would utter words in a body of a man uh your flesh 2,000 years ago, Father, you would utter words within our lips and use our mouth, Lord. And as we pray, we know, Lord, that that our prayers are answered. And father, we're just asking that you would just touch Sister Kim. Lord, I know that the devil is throwing everything he can at her. But Lord, we know that you are our healer. And her faith is in contact, Lord. It's intact. And Satan's not able to uh uh push her and toss her around. But Father, she's looking to you. and we as your children are looking to you and we're just believing for a miracle to take place. Father, I just ask that you would be with her as she'd go tomorrow, Lord, to have that uh scan done. And may there be a great testimony come from it, Father. We just uh uh thank you ahead of time for answering the prayer, Lord, and pray that you would just be with us tonight and uh just anoint, Lord, and help me just to get myself out of the way and to surrender myself to you. Father, we need you now today more than we ever have. Anoint your people tonight, Father. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says, "Amen." And amen. If you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to the book of Galatians, the 4th chapter, and then uh 2 Corinthians, the 3rd chapter. So, Galatians chapter 4. And just going to read uh a verse here in the 19th verse. Praise the Lord. And it says, "My little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you." Amen. Then 2 Corinthians the 3 chapter and the 18th verse. Praise the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord." Amen. You can have your seats this evening. Speaking of this uh reading here, I I think of of how wonderful it is to know that we are being changed and the change that is taking place. We are being formed into his image. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what it truly means as being we are in the age of the son of man revealing of the son of man and uh it's god becoming one with us as he and Christ was one &gt;&gt; and uh we are becoming the word by feeding on the word and I don't I don't have just uh I guess a thought I I pray though that won't get too scattered, but just thinking of um of the day that we're living in and how important uh uh the the message is and what it's doing for us. But this change that that Paul talked about um it's it's not something it's not meaning that you're going to be changed into something that you're not &gt;&gt; uh or that you weren't meant to be. Uh because first of all that's not the law of God. Um there in the book of Genesis, the Bible says that uh every seed was to bring forth of its kind. &gt;&gt; And so the change would happen because there was a seed there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the the law of God was in the seed uh that the seed would be transformed. it would be changed &gt;&gt; and and so uh what whatever God ordained you to be that is what you are to be. &gt;&gt; It's like the oak tree cannot be changed into a pumpkin or the pumpkin be changed into a pecan tree or or what whatever seed but uh the the oak seed can be changed into an oak tree. It's it's a takes on a transformation and what started out just to be a little seed now uh it's it's it's changed and it's grown and matured and transformed into a a a tree. A pumpkin seed can be changed into a pumpkin. The power of change is in the seed. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so um uh brother Brandham, he would say, "If you want to know what kind of a crop you're going to have or what this is growing up in the field, go back to find out what the seed is." See, the seed will produce just exactly what it is. It'll produce its kind. A corn will bring a corn, a cockab, a cockab, a wheat, a wheat, whatever it is, it will produce just what the seed was. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so, uh, uh, this change is a a transformation that's that's taken place. And the prophet said, God does this transformation by the spirit of his word. Amen. The word of God and the spirit of God goes hand in hand. It's amazing how Satan works on both extremes. He will take the word away and get people in in just spirit. Amen. In in spirit. And then he'll take the spirit away and get people just in word. Just word. Amen. But Jesus said, "My word is spirit and they're alive." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so you can't take the spirit away from the word or the word from the spirit. It's got to go hand in hand. And so the prophet said, "Now God plants his seed and throws his spirit on it and it brings forth the product. &gt;&gt; His holy spirit transforms the seed word to in to be vindicated of its kind." Ain't that right? Now God planted a word seed in every one of his children. &gt;&gt; If you are a child of God, a son or a daughter of God, the way you are that because of a word seed that God planted uh uh in in you and and so uh it the prophet would tell us it's a predestinated seed. So, it isn't a seed that was just uh uh evolved since you've been on the earth. It's it's it's a predestinated seed, meaning that he pred he predetermined what that seed would be uh before he planted it. In other words, he predetermined what you would be before you ever got here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now that seed, that predestinated seed is a son or a daughter of God. Amen. So there's no question uh you know uh kind of you know uh gambling on on well are you going to be or are you not going to be are you going to be? No. The seed determines what you are &gt;&gt; and and that was determined by God and and so it's a predestinated seed. It's an eternal seed because God's word is eternal. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Any seed that that came forth. Amen. In the beginning, uh it had to come forth by the spoken word because there was nothing else to make a seed. So the prophet said the seed came by the spoken word. And so the seed that God placed in you is by the spoken word of God. Ain't that right? And and and so we we find that his word that he spoke about you uh is what he had in his mind about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So his word started as a thought. Amen. Before it was a word, it was a thought. And and in God's thoughts, you were you you were in God's thinking. Every son and daughter of God uh uh was in God's thinking from before the foundation of the world. Ain't that right? And so then uh his his thought become expressed by uh uh his word. And so his word concerning you isn't anything different than his thoughts of you. what his thoughts are of you. His word is an expression of his thoughts. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So then there's nothing that can change what you were in his mind &gt;&gt; because it it's an eternal word, but it was an eternal thought. Amen. For that's what the prophet said. God's thoughts are eternal and they are real. Amen. more real than you are here this morning or this evening, more real than your first birth, more real than anything. God's thoughts are are real and they are eternal and that's where you started at in in his mind. &gt;&gt; So then your your first birth could not change that. There's nothing that can change you as to what you were in the mind of God in the thoughts of God. So your your first birth can't change it. Your sins can't change it. Uh uh your carnal ways couldn't change it. Your failures can't change. Uh anything. it. Nothing is powerful enough to change what God had of you in his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 4 and6. I I like this uh chapter um here, but Paul would say, "Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputth righteousness without works, saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin." Now, now think of that. To whom the Lord will not impute sin, &gt;&gt; we're we're living in a day where God's wrath is is is coming upon this world. This world is shaking. It's trembling. It's it's in fear. It's in chaos because the wrath of God is fixing to be poured out. And yet we stand in this age and not one sin attributed it to us. Can you say amen? You see why why is that is because that God created a blood. &gt;&gt; He created uh what the Bible calls the sea of forgetfulness which is his blood. Amen. And and when your sin is there, when uh uh it's it's wiped away and and when you well, I think it was the prophet that said that when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your sexual blood is dismissed. Amen. And and and so I like what brother Brandham said, and I'm still talking about that eternal thought. Uh he says when you're washed in the blood of the lamb, not by makeelie, but really the blood of the lamb, God does not impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it. &gt;&gt; See, there's a blood sacrifice. Now notice, the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So that's why he provided the blood. So he would not see you in your sins. He would not SEE YOU AS A SINNER. He would not see you as defeated. Amen. But he would provide something that would cover you from your sins and separate you from your sins. That when he looks at you, he could look at you on earth in the midst of all sins and and and corruption in a body of failure, in a in in a body of of uh that is no good. with contaminated with subject to diseases and failures and mind battles and all of that. But he created a blood that when he saw you, he could LITERALLY SEE you the same way that he saw you in his mind. Can you say amen? Amen. See you, He didn't keep you in his mind. Amen. But now you are a manifestation here on earth. Amen. And he CAN STILL LOOK AT YOU in this body of corruption IN ALL YOUR SCARS OF YOUR PAST AND and and your ups and downs and yet he can see you exactly the way he saw you in his mind. That's the power of the blood. Can you say amen? That's how eternal his thoughts are. And there's nothing that can change it. Even the devil, as many accusations as he can bring forth about you to God, can never change God's mind toward you. &gt;&gt; I think that's awesome. &gt;&gt; So he says now, he said, "Now the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the lamb's book of life." That's all he can look at because you are redeemed. How many believes you're redeemed? Amen. I'm redeemed. Not going to be. I am redeemed. I have that inherit first fruits of of my inheritance. That's all he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done. You're washed or loosed in the blood of the lamb. Therefore, there's no gull in you. There's no unclean habit in you because that the blood of the lamb has did this. And God cannot. Everybody say God cannot. God cannot. Now, there's a difference in God cannot and God just chooses not to. God cannot. He doesn't just choose not to. He cannot impute sin to you after you've got a sin offering laying there waiting for you. Aren't you blessed for that? That's how powerful the blood atonement is. That's how perfect our sacrifice is. And God's the one that provided such a sacrifice. GOD'S THE ONE THAT CAME up with the plan of redemption. GOD'S THE ONE THAT THAT PROVIDED SUCH A BLOOD. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So in his mind, HE SAW YOU WITHOUT ANY SIN. &gt;&gt; And that's the way he still sees you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So before the foundation of the world, God uh placed the gene seed in you, which is the word seed that he uh of what he predestinated you to be. &gt;&gt; So that's what we're being changed to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can't can't be changed if you're under condemnation. &gt;&gt; Can't get anywhere with God under condemnation. Ain't that right? So he takes that condemnation away from you. He brings a gospel that lets you know that you're free. Amen. That you don't have to knock down to the devil. Amen. You don't have to bear the load of sin. You're free. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says when a germ comes into the womb of the female, it don't take on. He says, "Well, you didn't become a human germ from your father. Then the next thing you become a germ from a dog and the next thing you become a cat and the next thing from a chicken. It was all human germ. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So you didn't change germs from human, cat, monkey, giraffe, and then human. No, you was all human from the beginning all the way through your process all the way through the stages of development. Can you say amen? He says, "And the body of Jesus Christ, the bride will be part of his body." &gt;&gt; He was the word, and the bride will have to be the word. Word added to word, add to word, Luther's justification, Wesley sanctification, Pentecostal's baptism of the Holy Ghost, restoration of the gifts, and all the rest of it goes with it. It's got to be word on top of word, germ on top of germ. life on top of life to bring out the full stature of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ain't that right? Word, bride, word upon top of word upon top of word upon top of word. And you started out as a word. &gt;&gt; You started out as as as part of God. Ain't that right? So, so uh you might have uh you know you might have wandered into this thing and that thing and this thing but all along there was that gene seed that could not be touched &gt;&gt; contaminated or mixed up and and all of these things. Now, we know that a seed can lay dormant in the ground uh for years until the sunlight shines upon it and and the atmosphere becomes right &gt;&gt; and then the seed is quickened. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so this is the light of the esin. Amen. Has come in this age. Amen. And it has struck in and in in such a way, amen, that every seed of God, amen, that has been predestinated for this age is to come to its complete full stature of Jesus Christ. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It is then quickened. And so when when the sun comes and and quickens the seed then the change starts taking place. &gt;&gt; I I want to just say you know change is not easy. &gt;&gt; Change is hard. &gt;&gt; Uh because with change comes struggle. With change comes conflict and pushing and pressing and it it involves waring within ourselves. Amen. It and and nature tells us, you know, shows us uh in all kinds of ways, but you take the chicken, you know, when it's when it's time to be hatched out of that egg, the pressure it it takes the waring, the struggle. Amen. And and and no one can help it. Amen. It's got to do it within itself. &gt;&gt; It It's made to do it. Ain't that right? It's made to do it. And and even though it seemed like it's it's it's hard and and and it it's the same way with the butterfly, the caterpillar, you know, that goes in the cocoon and and and it's time to come out, you know, and and HE'S GOT TO PUSH and and you know, it's it's been told, you know, uh probably several people been reading a story of a a lady that uh saw, you know, a butterfly struggling trying to to to get out of that cocoon. And and so she took something and made a slit and and and opened that cocoon to help it out that that butterfly and and and realized that she had done damage to that. Amen. Through all of her compassion and feeling sorry for it, trying to help it along, uh she she she took away the her its freedom to where it could not fly. It it you see, it had to take the struggle. It it had to take the fight. It had to take the the the the pushing and the uh the pain and the the struggle. Amen. To build strength in it. Ain't that right? See, not everything is easy. Amen. Life isn't easy. And and the more you come to God, the more you you uh uh start to take on word, the more the struggle's going to be and the more the conflict is going to be. Amen. Because you you've uh uh that's just God's way. Amen. Is is the struggle. Amen. You know, I I think it's a miracle today that a man can change. Amen. because uh we want life to be so easy, you know, everybody wants to be rich, you know, quick and and looking for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. And no one wants to uh to labor. No one likes to struggle. And he he, you know, it's just a common way of man uh to find the least path of resistance. that God ain't going to let you go through the least path of resistance. Amen. There's got to be the struggle. Can you say amen? See, I'm I'm glad for change. I'M I'M GLAD FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. But your opportunity for change lays in the struggles you go through and the pains and and the agonies and and THE TIMES THAT YOU YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO when you're YOU YOU'RE FALLING ON YOUR FACE AND before the Lord seeking his help, SEEKING HIS GUIDANCE. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now we are all free moral agents as as we know and we have a right to choose and a right to reject. It's the you know and and so with this you know we think that's freedom and and it is freedom but it's probably one of the hardest things is because God doesn't make decisions for you. Nobody can make decisions for you. We all come to the crossroads. Brother Brandham says you'll never leave a service the same. You'll either be worse off or you'll be better off. One of the two. But every time the word comes to us and the promises are preached, then we we are faced with the decisions of what we are to do with it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and so uh because we're free moral agents and uh uh being free to make our own choice, that's that's just the way God made it. It's it's he made us that way. So therefore, he will never force his self his way uh on anyone. For the prophet said he is a gentleman. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and so uh uh you look at the age that we're living in, the most evil, horrible age. And the worst thing that that ever happened, I guess, is in this age is where Jesus is found on the outside of the church knocking trying to get back in because he was rejected the people by their choice. They and and I know it's a choice. You can say, "Well, they didn't have a chance and they were ignorant." No. NO. THEY HAD A CHOICE because God so vindicated this message. God so proved to this generation that IT WAS JESUS CHRIST THE same yesterday, today, and forever that was doing the works. And so they, Brother Brham says, you know, the Jews, they they were ignorant because God blinded them. But the people today are willfully ignorant. They they don't want the truth. So they made the choice to refuse it. And as the scripture prophesied, Jesus the word is found outside of his own church trying to get back in. Revelations 3:20 says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock and if any man will hear my voice and and and his voice is his word. Hear my word, open the door, I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me." Right &gt;&gt; now you know the prophet tells us that this this leota means people's rights &gt;&gt; and this is the age where all nations and have risen up and demanded equality socially and financially and we're living in the age of he said of the communists where all men are supposedly equal though it is only so in theory. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but everybody wants their rights. And and in in in other words, no one wants to surrender to another man's will. No one everybody wants to be on top. Everybody wants to be the king. Everybody wants to be seen and and and known and uh uh successful or whatever you want to say. And and so uh it's it's this age of of uh people's rights that they have decided to kick Christ out. And so now he's knocking wanting back in. But he's not going to force himself in. Right? &gt;&gt; It he's just simply asking a man to be let in. It's not a forced entry. This message does not force itself on no one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It I know now men try to take this message and try to cram it down people's throat and make them live godly and make them act right. But this message is Christ &gt;&gt; and you can have you have the choice either to take it or accept and accept it or reject it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You have the choice to use it as your guide or you you can do your own thing. You you have the CHOICE TO COMPLY WITH IT or or not. It It's totally your choice. It's my choice. It's it's the choice of every man, woman, boy, girl. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so now it's in this age THOUGH THAT GOD IS CALLING OUT A people for his name. &gt;&gt; Not forcing them but just calling THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; CALLING THEM OUT. THIS IS THE time that he would call a people out for his name and he is having preeminence in that group of people that come out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet said, "Even though Jesus doesn't force open the door, he gives you the ability to let him in." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You have the ability to let him in. Now, so then we find that if it's if it's our choice, if it's up to us to let him in, then there has to be a surrender on our part to even have a relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you you understand for a relationship which which that's what God is wanting is a relationship between Christ and his bride, there has to be a surrender. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And the surrender is on our part. He's not the one surrendering. He surrendered. Christ surrendered to the will of the father uh uh when back 2,000 years ago. And now here we are as the bride surrendering to the will of the father in our day. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now surrender happens because of a desire within you to let him in. Surrender and that desire is a creation as the prophet said. It's not something that just happened to be in you. And I think that's the beautiful part is that if you have a desire to serve God, that's God. That's it's it's because God created a desire in you. &gt;&gt; So God forsaw you before the foundation of the world. This is he's determined it. He's he's he's declared it and and to be so. But then he places a desire within us. And and again, if you have that desire to serve God, don't take that for granted &gt;&gt; because a lot of folks don't have that today. If you have the desire to surrender your whole life to God, don't take that for granted. And you cannot blame others that don't have that desire because it was a a creation that God did within you. &gt;&gt; The Lord, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So now, don't think for a minute that you are the one that's wanting God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And desiring God. And then, you know, you're trying to get God's attention. You know, sometimes I think that's that's the way we feel sometimes when we go into prayer or when we're when we're going out throughout the day that it's like we're trying to get God's attention. When we get sick and and it seem like nothing's happening, we're trying to get God's attention and and all these things. And but you know, I I uh I just don't believe I think we've had God's attention before he had our attention. &gt;&gt; I I think I I just believe that if we were in the mind of God, then then all of his attention was focused upon us and and every promise that he has made throughout the years that is compiled up in the into the Bible. Amen. It's it's promises made because he was thinking of us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Do you believe that? See, so so I I I can't find in the scriptures where God does not like to do things for his people. I I I just can't find it in the scriptures that God changes his mind concerning his promises. But everywhere I see in the Bible, God wants to bless his children. God wants to bless his people. Can you say amen? He wants to heal you. HE WANTS TO SAVE YOU. HE WANTS TO fill you with the Holy Ghost. If you ain't got the Holy Ghost, he wants to give it to you. Amen. He wants to If you're needing deliverance, he wants to deliver you. If you're needing help, he wants to help you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's just the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, there's only one who seeks to kill, steal, and destroy, and that's your enemy, the devil. True. True. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But not only does God want to do things for his people, but he wants to do it MORE THAN YOU WANT HIM. &gt;&gt; It's what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; He wants to do it more than we want him to do it. So you you don't don't let the devil tell you that God isn't for you, &gt;&gt; that God isn't with you, and and you know, why would he save you if he didn't love you? Right. &gt;&gt; I I understand you know that sometimes we feel saved, sometime we don't. But you don't go by feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if God saved you, then he saved you for eternal. &gt;&gt; If if he if if he's done something for you, it's because it's he's doing an eternal work in your life. &gt;&gt; A ain't that right? Why would he fill you with the Holy Ghost if he didn't intend to keep you? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that the Holy Ghost is a seal and we're sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise until the day of our redemption. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, how how is it that you got the desire to serve the Lord? The the want to to walk close with him and and to serve him, to please him and walk with him. Well, that didn't come by you, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like God's just doing his own thing and ALL OF A SUDDEN A DESIRE HITS AND you're like, "God, I want TO WALK WITH YOU. GOD, I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU. GOD, I WANT TO DO I I I WANT TO LIVE FOR YOU. I WANT THAT RELATIONSHIP. &gt;&gt; God wanted the relationship with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he put that desire in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so brother Bram says before there is a desire created in your heart, there has to be a creator to create that creation. &gt;&gt; And if God desires uh uh creates a desire within a person, a man uh uh a desire for something, it's because that desire, amen, THERE'S SOMETHING FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; They're desiring something. THERE'S SOMETHING THERE FOR them or they wouldn't desire it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, the desire wouldn't be there IF THERE WASN'T SOMETHING THERE to fulfill that desire. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT MORE OF GOD, IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF GOD TO BE HAD. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE DESIRING HEAVEN, IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A HEAVEN FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The desire. Amen. So we find, brother Bram said, if you believe in divine healing and there is something in you that says there's healing somewhere, then there's bound to be a creator to create that desire. &gt;&gt; And if there's a desire in you, your heart to be healed by divine healing, then there's a fountain open somewhere. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, you couldn't have that desire if there wasn't. If there was no fountain of healing, if there was if there WAS NOT A FOUNTAIN OF BLOOD, AMEN, to wash your sins away, you wouldn't have had that desire to have your sins washed away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, whatever it is that you're desiring of God, it's already there for you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so then we find, you know, uh, not too long ago when the church got all formal and dried up and settled down to ritualistic forms of worship and well then the people began to crave more of God. &gt;&gt; They began to desire more of the Lord. Well, you know, the prophet said, "Then the baptism of the Holy Spirit came into existence." See, see, they were hungering for it AND GOD FULFILLED THAT DESIRE. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so now, now listen, church. What would it be if God didn't create the hunger? If God didn't create the desire within us, how awful that would be. &gt;&gt; Because we, man, would be stuck in ritual. &gt;&gt; We would just be like the rest of the world, just going through the hundrum OF LIFE, &gt;&gt; JUST SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING, looking back to years of yesterday years, yesterday, and and all that happened back then. See, it it would just we would just be SETTLED DOWN TO FORMS of worship. You know, it was it was God that began to steer Luther's heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. For more of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He created desire in Luther. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was something to be had. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody else had just settled down to Catholicism. settled down and knucked down to the rituals and the creeds and traditions. AMEN. BUT GOD WOULD PUT A DESIRE in Luther's heart. Amen. And and the elect of that age. Amen. And it would call them. Amen. They were calling for more of God. And God gave it to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Then after a while the people settled right back down to the humundrum of life. They settled back down to denominations uh denominationalism to creeds forms of worship and all of that. AND THEN GOD PREPARED A people &gt;&gt; and he CREATED A HUNGER WITHIN THEM TO DESIRE for more of him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he sent a messenger of John Wesley with the message. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. And it raised the church out of the tradition that they were in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then again, the people settled down for traditions. Settled down to all kinds of stuff. See, they didn't they didn't know what God's plan was. So, they just settled down after the revival was over, you know. And and the prophet says, you know, it doesn't take long for people to settle down after revival. Amen. After Luther went off the scene, the people just started settling down. Amen. Went right back in the humdrum of life. After Wesley went off the scene, the people, Amen, it just seemed like it wasn't long until the people just went back into the humdrum of life. Amen. Even the prophet talks about how that after the day of Pentecost, Amen. men's hearts begin to cool down. The revival fire begin to cool down. Ain't that right? SO, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN God initiating it. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS BEEN GOD. AMEN. Remembering his plan, REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAS DESIRED OF MAN. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, when man settled back down, then God sent a man a created desire in the hearts of men and women. Amen. And that oneeyed black man, I can't remember his name, Seymour. Amen. Begin to pray. Uh uh history says he began to pray 8 hours a day having his head in an old apple cita and he is praying for a move of God. People all around begin to pray. Amen. For a GREAT MOVE OF GOD and God answered their prayers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What they were desiring, God had for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But are we a people without hunger? ARE WE A PEOPLE WITHOUT A DESIRE? Oh no, no, no. AMEN. SEE, PENTECOST HAS SETTLED BACK DOWN. They have gone back to ritualism. They have gone to Amen. the ways of man again. Amen. To where they're so cold they they wouldn't know of the power of God if it slapped them in the face. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't know it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But here we are under our messenger of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; That's right. Can you say amen? Each time that God created a a hunger for more of God in the age, that church would move up a little bit more. Move up a little bit higher. Amen. Move up. Ain't that right? So, the church hasn't been just spinning its wheels going from cycle to cycle to cycle, getting nowhere. God has been bringing the church up and up and up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. So here we are a people under the message of Malachi 4. And with that is is bringing another birth pain. &gt;&gt; And I'll I'll say it this way. It's the final and last birth pain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; For we're living in the final age. And we we REALIZE THAT WE ARE THAT FINAL VOICE. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and we also REALIZE THAT PENTECOST COULD NOT MEET THE CONDITIONS OF A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TRUE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; SO, IT TOOK A GOD WOULDN'T FORCE A PEOPLE OUT. HE WOULD CREATE A DESIRE WITHIN HIS ELECT AND THEY WOULD BEGIN TO CRY FOR MORE OF GOD. THEY WOULD BEGIN TO PRESS FOR MORE OF GOD. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen &gt;&gt; to meet the end time conditions? See, so we're living in the final age, final voice. Prophet said, living voices, &gt;&gt; the word to be made flesh. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It isn't just educated preachers and and and and fine seminaries and and trained uh uh choir, all that. It's lived voices. It's the word actually taking form within the human being. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says under every prophet's message, Israel got a birth pain because that these prophets would come on the scene after the theologians and clergymen would have the church all in an organization form. And when them prophets come on the scene with thus said the Lord, they shook them churches and she had a birth pain. &gt;&gt; Finally, she had birth painans plum on up till she delivered a son of the gospel which is the was the word itself made flesh. So the church really is in birth painans tonight. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I know uh you know the the ministers you know in brother Brandham's day they they always they they talk about brother Brandham highly in the fact that he never missed it in in his discernment very humble man the presence of God was with him but they always say he missed it he missed it he missed it we can't understand his doctrines and all that but they don't understand A PROPHET WAS BRINGING BIRTH painans to the church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Shaking us from that ritualism. Shaking us from that, you know, if I call it that Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so he says, you know, he says now, he says, so the really the church really is in birth painans tonight again for the deliverance of the son of God to come again. All of our theologians, all of our systems, all of our denominations has rotted out from under us. &gt;&gt; Luther didn't even have what it took to bring on a rapture. &gt;&gt; All through the ages, there was nothing, amen, uh to uh uh that was capable of bringing a rapture on. &gt;&gt; But here in this age, there's a message &gt;&gt; to get us ready. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "We are in birth pain." Everybody say, "I'm in birth pain." &gt;&gt; And a message from God always through the church in heavier pain, but after a while, she's going to be delivered of a bride &gt;&gt; that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So each age, birth pain. A little bit harder birth pain, a little bit harder birth pain. and and and right at the time of deliverance, the heaviest birth pains and the church, it's happened to the church as a whole throughout the ages. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But it also happens to us as individuals. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the message that we are under brings such birth pains. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. IT IT BRINGS SUCH STRUGGLE. &gt;&gt; It It brings such a a pressure, if I could say it that way. Not it's not in a bad way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But see, Satan, he wants to anoint us with unbelief in God's word. &gt;&gt; He wants you to believe that nothing is happening in the message. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the message is not effective. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; in the church, in the world, in my life. We're just, you know, he he wants us to settle down to the humdrum of life. &gt;&gt; But I promise you this, this bride will not go that way. &gt;&gt; She can't. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said it will not denominate. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The church ain't this bride ain't going to do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. See? So, but this message is effective to those who surrender to it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS THE CAPSTONE. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; our head. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so now without this message, God is just nothing MORE BUT A GOD OF HISTORY. &gt;&gt; COME ON, think about it. &gt;&gt; There is no message on this in this world today that can bring God out of history. &gt;&gt; Pentecostal message ain't got it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Presbyterian message ain't got it. Baptist message, they can't bring God out of history. Church of Christ, whatever message there is out in this world today, there there's nothing that can bring God out of history. &gt;&gt; But there is a message, &gt;&gt; OF MALACHI 4 THAT HAS GOT THE POWER TO MAKE JESUS CHRIST the same yesterday, today, and forever to those who surrender to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I hope you know this makes some sense to you. &gt;&gt; But what was the prophet? The prophet was the stonemason that took this message and began to shape because remember God was calling for a change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Change in church ritual, change in family, CHANGE IN INDIVIDUALS. God want a change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and so God would send a prophet with a message THAT WOULD BEGIN TO SHAPE and and take a people. Well, you know, Brother Brandham, he said this. He said, "What good is a stone?" And brother Brandon talks about the stone being our confession. &gt;&gt; That he said, "What good is a stone?" In other words, what good is a confession to say, "I'm a believer. I'm a Christian. and I go to church and I'm this if there isn't a stonemason there to shape him into a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's what's making you different &gt;&gt; than the rest &gt;&gt; of of churchity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're just piling up a bunch of rocks. Is that right? It isn't doing any a bit of good. The water we wearth the way the stone. See, that's right. That's the people. What good is stones if you haven't got a true stonemason with the sharp good sharp tool to shape him into the fitting place in the house of God? Just want to ask you, what's the good what goods the decisions? What good you putting your name on the book? What good is it to join the church if the stonemason ISN'T THERE? THAT'LL SHAPE THAT AND MAKE THEM QUIT THIS AND QUIT THAT and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians that sit in the house of God with signs following the believer. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT'S END TIME evangelism is taking the stones and shaping them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, that's why we get miserable. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's why we get kind of um I don't know what you'd call it. Well, uh we're miserable. Is because there's a honing that is going on by this message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's shaping us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hello. &gt;&gt; And it's not doing it by force. &gt;&gt; We are surrendering ourselves to it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We realize that not only do we have a desire to be with God and to be like God, how many wants to be like God? &gt;&gt; I certainly want to. I want to reflect him in every aspect of my life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm finding out more and more that in order to do that, I've got to surrender to this message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It It's not for me to correct the message. It's not for me to say I believe the message and take my own thoughts whenever I want to. I must surrender everything to it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Then we find out as we the more we surrender to it, we find out that we don't handle things the way we'd normally handle it. We went and do things the in the same way that a normal human being would because the message is guiding us. The message is shaping us. So, so when when you know when a situation arises and and you could you YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT to to lay blame and and to get mad and to HOLD HARD feelings and and all of that you find in the message is is taking a different route. Amen. Now, that's the way we would take it as church members and split a church and divide and complain and grumble, but we're finding ourselves yielding to a message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message tells us that love is the strongest weapon &gt;&gt; ever given to man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Love. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Talked about when when the man came and going to kill him, HE SAID SATAN CREATED A hatred in that man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said the only way to handle that was by divine love. &gt;&gt; I love that man. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's what he said. &gt;&gt; See, he says, "Now, I was a boxer. Brother Brand was a boxer. &gt;&gt; He was very well trained." And so this man, this man was threatened to whoop HIM, KNOCK HIM OUT. WELL, IT WOULD HAVE been instant, automatic, instant. Uh just just go back to your old days and say, "I'll handle this one. I'll take you out." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was trained to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that's not the way of the maker. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? remember when the couple and you could hear it on tape when they were making love on in the church while brother Brown's talking and all of a sudden he gets death quiet &gt;&gt; and he says stop that &gt;&gt; and I mean everything goes quiet &gt;&gt; and I think he said it again I said stop that &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; and you could hear the sternness in his voice but the angel of the Lord told him there's a trap for you &gt;&gt; and he told the church there's a trap waiting for me Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he says, "I could have called fire down. I could have done whatever I wanted to. It was in my power." The Lord told him it was in his power to do whatever. And he said, "I forgive you. &gt;&gt; I forgive you." And it broke it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Ed Dalton talking to him uh that was there and he says that you know they were he was with brother Brandham uh at the end of the service or after service and brother Ram got his hat and he uh when they went outside brother Brandham just threw it up in the air and jumped UP AND SAID, "YEP, I PASSED THE TEST." &gt;&gt; You see, God's having a test for all of us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and and it's it's not him. You better do this and you better do that. It's a surrendering. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. Now, notice Mark 11:24. Therefore, I say unto you, what thingsoever you desire? When when did where did that desire come from? God created that desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them. Well, as believers, our desire isn't for wealth of the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Our our desire isn't for riches and fame. Our desires, you know, I I know that that God blesses us with money and he blesses us with monetary things. He blesses his people with with if you need a job, he'll bless you. If you need money, he'll bless you with that. If you need a a car, a home, OR WHATEVER, GOD BLESSES his people with those things. Can you say amen? BUT THOSE THINGS DOES NOT DRIVE US. &gt;&gt; WHAT DRIVES US IS A DESIRE FOR MORE OF HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and notice OUR DESIRE IS NOT THE DESIRE that a sinner would have OR OR AN UNGODLY WOULD HAVE. OUR DESIRE matches his desire. &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRED in the beginning TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU AND I. GOD DESIRED IN THE BEGINNING. AMEN. TO HAVE US AS HIS BRIDE AND TO UNITE. GOD DESIRED, AMEN, IN THE BEGINNING THAT WE WOULD LIVE WITH HIM FOREVER AND EVER. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS GOD'S DESIRE. THAT'S WHAT HE PREDESTINATED us for. And that desire that HE CREATED WITHIN US MATCHES his desire. &gt;&gt; Amen to God. Amen to God. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; He desires to walk with us. He desires to manifest himself in us and through us. He desires to have preeminence in us. He desires to for us to reflect his image. &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So his desire, that desire that he created within us is his desire. It's his desire that he's created. You see, he doesn't want conflict between us and him. If this message is making a conflict between you and God, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This isn't to make us enemies to God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, IT'S THE GREATEST MESSAGE. BUT GOD WOULD CREATE A DESIRE WITHIN US. &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN we hear the message, when we hear the promises, when we HEAR WHAT THE PROPHET IS TEACHING US, THERE'S A DESIRE within us. Say, "God, make me more like you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there comes a struggle with that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to press into it. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because your old will does not your old ways, your old flesh does not want to conform. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And that's where the battle is. Remember the the black bird or the white dog and the black dog? The Indian chief said there's a war, you know, between me and and and the the black dog and the white dog are fighting AND AND WELL, WHO'S WINNING? The one I feed the most. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I I I promise you, amen, THAT THAT THAT YOU CANNOT FULFILL THE WILL OF GOD, AMEN, BY FEEDING OFF OF YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM AND AND ALL OF THIS SOCIAL MEDIA AND KEEPING UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT HERE. I PROMISE YOU, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO SURRENDER YOURSELF TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But there has TO BE THAT DESIRE WELL UP FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Christ died to destroy to uh uh the the eminity to abolish the immity between us and him. &gt;&gt; Because he can't fulfill his will IN US AS LONG AS WE'RE FIGHTING HIM. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I think that's why people walk away from the message. They don't want to surrender to it. That's true. &gt;&gt; That's why preachers start walking away from the message teaching their own stuff. They can't surrender to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This this message isn't an option. This this message isn't take it and leave IT AND AND DISSECT IT. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE EVERY BIT OF IT OR OR ELSE. &gt;&gt; You've got to come to cons complete surrender to it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. the Lord. &gt;&gt; James 4:8 says, "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you." Is that a promise? &gt;&gt; Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." So, you're blessed to have that kind of a desire. &gt;&gt; You're blessed to see this message as as food for the soul. See, changing, it's causing a change within us. You believe it? As I close, when we were children, we couldn't discern what was good for us and what was not good for us. We've all been there. &gt;&gt; I don't guess I've ever had any of my children, any seven of them, you know, had a three year old, four year old ask for broccoli, say, "Can I have some broccoli? That's good for me. I'd like to have some." No. They want candy &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; they want sweet things. They want pop. They want all kinds of stuff, right? &gt;&gt; And then it goes even beyond that, you know, they they you know, they would want a a fourwheeler, you know, or they would want something that maybe they couldn't handle, but they just see the fun in it and and and and whatever. Maybe at a young age, Dad, can I drive that car? I' I'd like to go drive it. Mm-m. No, you can't drive. But it's because our understand the understanding was was very shallow. &gt;&gt; Hadn't matured. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, we we didn't care as kids, you know, we didn't discern what was bad for us, what was good for us. We didn't discern the the hurts that could come with things. &gt;&gt; I sure didn't. I remember getting up, you know, when I was about 16, I guess, 15. Got up way up high on a cliff, way up high. I don't know how high, but it was it's fairly high. And and uh I dove in water that would only come up to here to my dad. &gt;&gt; And and on top of that, I couldn't go out that way forward because I'd hit the bank. So, I had to jump out and dive take a dive that way and and do a real shallow dive. I thought that was the coolest thing. And my dad, I told dad, I said, "Dad, you got to come and look at this water. It's so cold. It's It's real clear. It's right by a spring." I said, "Dad, I got to take you up there, you know." And so, we all went as a family. And so, I thought I was going to show my expertise to my daddy. Oh my. &gt;&gt; And uh so I got up there and I said, "Dad, watch me dive." What? Hold it. You know, you just stay right there for a minute. So he walked out there and only went to him here. You know, he said, "You dive? You you dove off that?" I said, "Yeah, all the time." He said, "You get down here right now." I said, "Oh, dive." No. Boy, he gave me a tongue lashing, grounded me, and whatever, you know. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but I didn't know. I just I didn't consider the fact that I could be, you know, hit my head, break my neck, or die. &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, that that's just the way we were, you know, and and and didn't see it. But then we we find that as we begin to mature, a change starts taking place, not only just in the physical, but but also in our understanding. &gt;&gt; Hello. That's right. I'm glad I had parents that stayed with me, put up with me, taught me the difference between rights and wrongs, but yet they couldn't keep me from everything. There's a lot of experiences, a lot of scars that I have. I've learned from experiences. BUT BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, I can truly say as a 50-year-old man, I definitely wouldn't do what I did back then &gt;&gt; because I matured, right? &gt;&gt; Well, this is what this message is. Is to cause us to grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change. Change. Can you say amen? Not think as a Presbyterian. Not think as a Pentecostal. not think as a as a Lutheran or or or a Wesleyan or whatever you want to CALL IT, BUT COME UP TO THE PLACE that we're starting to take on the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Having an understanding between good and evil, that's true. &gt;&gt; Being changed by the word of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. uh if the musicians will come. We could go on and on, but the desire that God created within us causes us to groan within us ourselves. And I realize that, you know, brother Brandham, he said, "When a man receives the Holy Spirit, then his time of groaning is over because it's a finished work." And and and that is true. So, we're not groaning to be saved. We're not groaning to be sons of God. We're not groaning. We've come to a rest. We are sons and daughters of God. We have his seal. We have his spirit crying aba father. But believers are still groaning &gt;&gt; because they have a desire. Paul talks about it in Romans 8. He says, you know, in um well, we could read it 8:18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. See, the sufferings are not worthy to be compared with the glory &gt;&gt; which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope. because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. Not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. talks about groaning again, for in this we groan earnestly. Talking about, you know, the the earthly house, and if it was dissolved, we have a building of God, not not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. And he said, "For in this we grown earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, if so that being clothed, we shall not be found naked, for that we are in this tabern. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, groaning, groaning, groaning to be clothed with immortality, groaning to be changed." Can you say amen? So our groaning and and I think this is the the beauty of it. No matter how discouraged we would get or how low we would feel, whether we have the feelings or not feelings and and high on the mountain or NOT HIGH, THERE'S STILL THAT DESIRE, a groaning, I want to reach it. I got to I got to move on. This is not where I am to be. I'm to be there &gt;&gt; where God has called me to be. Can you say amen? It's why brother Brandham said nature is groaning. We are groaning. Everything is groaning because we realize there's something not right. And the only way you can groan grown and wait for it is because there has been new life come in here that speaks of a new world. I believe this message calls us to grown. The opening of the word has come. God's mind has been revealed, showing his desire for the church, showing his desire for us in this age, and there's something in us causing us to grown. &gt;&gt; God, I desire for more of you. I I I desire. And you know, with that, we we just start laying aside this. We start laying aside that. Now, church, not everybody not everybody just just groans. Not everybody just has this desire. There's people that just have desire and they're content just being going to church, being mediocre. But this bride has a greater desire. God, I want more of you. &gt;&gt; And the only way we could desire that is God placed that within us &gt;&gt; because there's something more for us to have. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God bless you is our prayer. Oh, so great of salvation, so rich and so free. I want to thank you, Lord, for saving my soul. [Music] Thank you, Lord, for making me whole. I want to thank you, Lord, for giving to me. Oh, thy great salvation so rich and free. One more time. Oh, thank you Lord for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole.

[Music] All to thee, my blessed Savior. I surrender all. Sing it again. Yes, I surrender all. [Music] I surrender all to thee my blessed Savior I surrender all first verse. Oh, all to Jesus.

God bless you is our prayer. Oh, what grace he's given us. Amen. &gt;&gt; A heart to surrender to him. remember sister Kim weeks in our prayer and u you know this is a serious situation that she's going through and um I I know she's depending on us the prayer saints to to offer prayers unto God and God uses uses us for these things and so if you if you think you don't matter in the body, you do matter, especially at a time as like this.
