[46:36] shepherd
[46:37] and notice
[46:39] where the Lord leads him
[46:42] as he does all of his sheep and that's
[46:45] in Green Pastures
[46:47] I think this is important
[46:50] that David would describe these things
[46:54] and then he would say he restores my
[46:57] soul
[46:59] because here David is saying that he
[47:03] makes me lie down in Green Pastures rest
[47:07] peace no worrying no fretting no no
[47:13] wondering no fear anxiety
[47:17] and this isn't a fairy tale
[47:20] that David is speaking of it's it's not
[47:24] you know the the the the the story of a
[47:27] Cinderella or or Jack and the Beanstalk
[47:31] and then you know I always at the end
[47:33] they live happily ever after and you
[47:35] know uh and but it's it's some figment
[47:38] of man's imagination but this is a
[47:41] reality
[47:42] that that that that there is a rest and
[47:46] and so David is not living on an island
[47:50] all by himself and and we're reading the
[47:54] scripture as though it it's some foreign
[47:58] language or some foreign thing that he's
[48:01] talking about and he's not living in the
[48:05] millennium
[48:06] he's uh you know he hasn't changed in to
[48:11] some Angelic being
[48:13] uh uh he's still living in his fleshly
[48:17] Tabernacle this is a man that is full of
[48:21] mistakes and failures and he's still
[48:24] dealing with the the problems of life
[48:26] and yet he is telling us that he's at
[48:30] rest
[48:31] and he makes me to lie down in in Green
[48:35] Pastures so he's he's made to rest and
[48:39] and David gives the expect explanation
[48:42] in this third verse and that is he
[48:46] restoreth my soul
[48:49] now I want to look at this uh in in a
[48:52] moment but again where is the place that
[48:56] David is resting it's in Green Pastures
[48:59] of course you know in in the book of
[49:02] Ephesians Paul uh talks about how that
[49:06] the Saints uh you know
[49:09] um they're they're in Heavenly places
[49:12] um he talks about us being in Christ
[49:15] Jesus and he's and and so David's not
[49:18] resting on uh Green Pastures he's
[49:22] resting in Green Pastures and uh when
[49:26] brother Brown I'm talking about this
[49:28] book of Ephesians being in Heavenly
[49:30] places being in Christ Jesus he would
[49:33] say that is the position of the believer
[49:36] ain't that right and so I'm going to
[49:39] take it as that uh in this that he
[49:42] maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures
[49:46] and I I say that is position of the
[49:51] believer a man and of course Green
[49:54] Pastures are what uh uh his sheep feed
[49:57] off of and the green pasture is the word
[50:01] of God do you believe that it's the word
[50:04] of God Matthew 4 4 it is written Jesus
[50:08] says that man shall not live by bread
[50:10] alone but by every word everybody say
[50:14] every word that proceedeth out of the
[50:17] mouth of God so the believer is
[50:21] positionally placed in the word of God
[50:25] and that's where the food is he's
[50:29] resting in the word now I'm going to
[50:33] just uh you you just uh bear with me but
[50:35] in in Revelations 10 8-9 we know it
[50:40] we've talked about it but John was
[50:41] commanded to take the open book that
[50:45] only the lamb was worthy to open ain't
[50:48] that right and was told to eat the book
[50:51] The Lamb had to first of all open the
[50:55] book ain't that right amen and then he
[50:59] sent it down to his seventh angel uh uh
[51:04] there on Earth and the seventh angel
[51:07] then had to reveal the mystery of God
[51:11] ain't that right and it was after this
[51:15] that John was told to eat the book A man
[51:20] so so our food is the revealed mysteries
[51:25] of God
[51:27] our food is not a closed book our our
[51:30] food is not a mystery that is still
[51:33] hidden a man that our food is the
[51:37] revealed word of God that no man was
[51:41] worthy Amen to to open this book up
[51:44] ain't that right and it's in there that
[51:48] we are made to lie down it's we are at
[51:53] rest in the revealed word of this hour
[51:57] amen and and so it's it's in Revelations
[52:01] 5 that when John looked upon the book A
[52:05] man that he got excited and he began to
[52:09] worship the lamb ain't that right the
[52:12] book was open and and John looked upon
[52:16] that book and and he began to shout he
[52:19] began to glorify amen uh it wasn't an
[52:23] empty worship it wasn't an empty shout a
[52:26] man he was he had something to shout
[52:29] about he had something to Rejoice about
[52:32] he had something to worship the lamb
[52:35] about can you say man and the prophet
[52:38] said he must have saw his name in the
[52:41] book amen now you know that put John at
[52:44] rest
[52:45] saw his name in the book
[52:48] amen and and that's what this whole
[52:50] revealed word is about is that we're
[52:53] seeing ourselves in the book can you say
[52:57] man we're resting that's our position is
[53:01] in the word of God Amen see we're we're
[53:05] resting in Green Pastures now uh Amos 8
[53:10] and 11 uh says behold the days will come
[53:14] amen saith the Lord God that I will send
[53:17] the famine in the land not a famine of
[53:20] bread nor a thirst for water but of
[53:23] hearing the words of the Lord or
[53:27] understanding The Words of the Lord and
[53:31] they shall Wander from sea to Sea and
[53:34] from the north even to the East and they
[53:37] shall run to and fro to seek the word of
[53:40] the Lord and shall not find it can you
[53:43] say man so there these are a group of
[53:46] people that that that has no
[53:49] understanding with the word they're not
[53:52] made to rest in the word they're not
[53:54] made to lie down in the word but they're
[53:58] actually searching they're they're
[54:00] wandering from East and and and to the
[54:03] west and and uh uh you know running of
[54:08] seeking uh to and fro trying to find the
[54:11] word of God and the Bible says they will
[54:14] not find it can you say man they will
[54:17] not find it and and so they're not made
[54:20] to lie down because they're still
[54:23] searching for answers
[54:25] amen they they can't be at rest their
[54:28] heart's not at rest because they're
[54:30] still searching for answers ain't that
[54:32] right a man and and uh I I think we are
[54:36] the Most Blessed people a man to have
[54:39] answers in this day amen we've got the
[54:42] answer for the future of America we've
[54:45] got the answer to the future of the
[54:47] trouble that's going on we've got the
[54:49] answer as to why the churches are the
[54:52] way they are we've got the answer as to
[54:55] what God is doing we've got the answers
[54:58] to what the devil is doing can you say
[55:00] man amen that's right and so we find
[55:04] that these people they fast and they
[55:06] pray and and then they pray even more
[55:10] and they fast even more and they shut
[55:12] themselves in uh uh for long periods of
[55:16] time a man uh uh they prophesy of a
[55:20] great outpouring of the spirit of God
[55:23] that is to come they preached they shout
[55:26] they dance they and and and they have
[55:28] their their proactive uh uh uh meetings
[55:32] a bam but but see uh yeah they're not
[55:36] able to reach a man and to rest they're
[55:39] not able to come to a an absolute in
[55:43] their soul a man to where they're at
[55:46] rest but I tell you God's sheep is not
[55:49] in a famine can you say amen amen
[55:52] they're not in a famine we have been LED
[55:55] in Green Pastures that that is our
[55:59] position amen John was told to eat the
[56:02] book it wasn't his idea amen it wasn't
[56:06] just him going by his own feelings the
[56:09] Lord let him to take the book can you
[56:12] say man John knew where to get the book
[56:15] a man and he knew a man by a command of
[56:19] God and the leadership of God to take
[56:23] the book and to eat it can you say man
[56:25] in you realize in no other age no other
[56:28] age uh uh has anyone been commanded to
[56:31] take the book and to eat the bush can
[56:34] you say amen amen that's right now I
[56:37] know I believe it was uh maybe the
[56:40] prophet Ezekiel that ate the scroll a
[56:42] man but but it was in a type of of where
[56:45] we're at today can you say amen amen but
[56:48] but see uh it was it John was caught up
[56:52] in the Lord's day which was our day amen
[56:55] and he sees the the lamb to take that
[56:58] book and and open the seals and and and
[57:02] and and and and uh he sees that Mighty
[57:04] Angel which could only be Christ amen
[57:07] and send it down come down with the open
[57:10] book and hand it to that seventh angel
[57:12] and he saw the seventh angel began to
[57:15] reveal the mystery of God Amen and when
[57:18] the Mysteries was open can you say Amen
[57:21] John was commanded just like you and I
[57:24] are amen and to take the book and to eat
[57:27] it can you say man amen so no other age
[57:30] a man no one was told to eat the book
[57:33] because it was still in the hands of him
[57:36] that set upon the throne amen it was
[57:39] still sealed up can you say man that's
[57:43] right see and so the Lord will not lead
[57:46] you now I want to say this because a man
[57:48] John knew who that seventh angel was he
[57:51] knew where the book was amen the
[57:54] revealed mysteries of God Amen and God
[57:57] will not command this bride a man to eat
[58:00] any other thing amen than what that book
[58:04] says can you say Amen eat the book don't
[58:07] eat anything else just eat the book can
[58:10] you say man amen he will not lead Judy
[58:12] anything that's not first been given to
[58:15] the prophet of this age
[58:18] ain't that right for the seven Angel
[58:20] holds the food
[58:22] do you believe that Amen brother Rand
[58:25] even talking about he said you remember
[58:27] what that dream that I got the
[58:29] interpretation was go back and store up
[58:31] food where was The Storehouse this
[58:33] Tabernacle where is there anything like
[58:36] it in the country around here anywhere
[58:37] that will compare with the message that
[58:40] we have see now of course see our little
[58:42] brothers out here us along these other
[58:44] little churches or us were one he said
[58:47] where would you go to to find it say
[58:49] show its comparison anywhere you go
[58:52] right out into denominational Creeds
[58:54] you'll go right out away from the name
[58:56] of Jesus of the Lord Jesus ain't that
[58:58] right amen as soon as you left leave the
[59:01] message that's where you're going to go
[59:02] from amen out in the Creeds out into
[59:05] denominations out to Traditions out out
[59:08] to all of these things see amen he says
[59:11] and here is where the food has been
[59:14] stored up amen will one message he said
[59:17] that I preached you know he said
[59:18] preaching from one to six hours to you
[59:20] on a message well if I had to use one of
[59:23] those message see I'd take a week to
[59:25] take it and and just a little bit here
[59:27] and a little bit there because it's been
[59:29] stored up here it's on tapes it'll go
[59:33] worldwide on the tapes where people in
[59:36] their houses
[59:38] can you say man amen people in their
[59:41] houses see he said see them tapes will
[59:43] fall right into the hands of the
[59:45] predestinated of God he can direct the
[59:49] word he'll direct everything just
[59:51] exactly to its cores and that's the
[59:55] reason he sent me back to do this to
[59:57] store up the food here can you say man
[1:00:00] so we we find
[1:00:02] um uh uh that in the third verse David
[1:00:06] says you know he speaks of his soul uh
[1:00:10] uh being restored and and I believe that
[1:00:12] all of these uh the three scriptures
[1:00:14] verses tied together now I want to look
[1:00:18] at the soul amen uh again for uh a few
[1:00:24] minutes but brother Branham says that
[1:00:27] when man sinned he marred that Soul it
[1:00:30] was Blackness Darkness uh came into it
[1:00:33] it's the soul that is sinful
[1:00:37] amen and we know the prophet tells us
[1:00:41] that the soul is the nature of the
[1:00:44] spirit and so you are what you are in
[1:00:49] your soul
[1:00:51] not in your flesh but in your soul ain't
[1:00:55] that right so what we are in our soul
[1:00:59] when we die is what we will be when we
[1:01:04] meet the Lord
[1:01:05] ain't that right so you are a a man is a
[1:01:11] sinner in his soul
[1:01:15] and he is a Christian
[1:01:18] in his soul
[1:01:20] and you say man
[1:01:22] that's right now brother Branham says
[1:01:24] until the burning fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:27] has cleansed your soul from sin you're
[1:01:30] still a sinner
[1:01:32] see it's it's in the heart ain't that
[1:01:34] right now as we've already stated that
[1:01:37] we are a a a Triune being Body Spirit
[1:01:41] and soul
[1:01:43] now we we've stated this as well that
[1:01:47] the prophet says that the soul controls
[1:01:50] the spirit
[1:01:51] and the spirit controls the flesh
[1:01:55] so your your the throne room
[1:01:59] is not in your flesh
[1:02:01] not in your spirit
[1:02:03] it's in your heart or soul
[1:02:06] can you say Amen
[1:02:08] now I I I uh uh uh so you can tell
[1:02:14] who is on the throne of your heart
[1:02:18] by your desires
[1:02:20] I want you to really listen now
[1:02:23] by your desire you can tell
[1:02:28] who's on the throne room or the Throne
[1:02:31] of your heart
[1:02:32] by what your soul is feeding on
[1:02:36] by what your soul is thirsting for
[1:02:40] by what satisfies you
[1:02:44] you say man
[1:02:46] so if the word isn't satisfying
[1:02:50] then that means there's something wrong
[1:02:53] because the Holy Spirit only lives off
[1:02:59] the word of God
[1:03:02] now this is why David is saying he's
[1:03:04] made me to lie down
[1:03:07] in Green Pastures
[1:03:10] because he's restored my soul
[1:03:14] can you say Amen
[1:03:16] so David is showing
[1:03:19] that he is satisfied
[1:03:22] his desire has been met
[1:03:26] his
[1:03:28] his ambition or his craving
[1:03:32] has been satisfied
[1:03:34] and he is at rest
[1:03:37] ain't that right
[1:03:39] now
[1:03:40] you know brother Brown talks about you
[1:03:43] know
[1:03:43] uh the girl that uh talked to his
[1:03:46] daughter Sarah
[1:03:48] and her pastor had been to Africa and
[1:03:51] and when he come back this girl stripped
[1:03:54] off her clothes that night with a pair
[1:03:57] of little tights on
[1:03:59] and done the what what do you see or
[1:04:02] whatever for him to entertain him
[1:04:04] because he had been to Africa
[1:04:08] so this this watsu whatever is a tribe
[1:04:13] over there he says you know and boy I'd
[1:04:16] like to see one of my girls in my
[1:04:17] congregation try to do something like
[1:04:19] that
[1:04:20] he said see but it goes to show and the
[1:04:23] pastor that would sit and look at one of
[1:04:26] his congregation
[1:04:27] a little 16 or 18 year old girl out
[1:04:30] there stripped off like that and let her
[1:04:31] get by with that that shows that he come
[1:04:34] out of a cesspool himself
[1:04:36] for a man of God to do a thing like that
[1:04:39] see
[1:04:40] now now I'm trying to uh I hope I can
[1:04:43] make some sense tonight
[1:04:45] but see that man's Soul wasn't right
[1:04:52] so so what that was it was the old
[1:04:55] carry-on
[1:04:57] of the world
[1:04:59] I looked up that word carry-on it's it's
[1:05:02] it's actually the decaying flesh of dead
[1:05:05] animals
[1:05:08] now that's that's totally different from
[1:05:11] where David is
[1:05:13] because he's in the place of life
[1:05:16] Green Pastures
[1:05:18] then you say Amen
[1:05:21] but here this this young girl would
[1:05:25] strip for her pastor and the pastor
[1:05:28] wouldn't say a thing about it
[1:05:32] and you say man
[1:05:33] now the prophet says a vulture wants
[1:05:37] dead things
[1:05:40] and the people have shown
[1:05:44] what their control tower is
[1:05:48] and has shown what's in their soul
[1:05:52] for he said their soul everybody say
[1:05:55] their soul
[1:05:57] longs
[1:05:59] for things like that
[1:06:02] then you say Amen
[1:06:05] he says see they're so long if for a
[1:06:09] high intellectual Church
[1:06:11] where the people dress real fine and the
[1:06:13] pastor takes 15 or 20 minutes
[1:06:17] and if you go over that they draw him
[1:06:19] back on the Deacon board
[1:06:20] he mustn't say anything about Sin
[1:06:23] he mustn't say anything about wearing
[1:06:25] shorts
[1:06:26] and wouldn't say nothing about people
[1:06:28] doing this that or the other he must
[1:06:30] have mentioned that at all if they do
[1:06:32] the board will have him thrown out
[1:06:36] he said see what about all this caring
[1:06:38] on they've done today in the name of the
[1:06:40] church
[1:06:41] practicing square dancing in the church
[1:06:43] Bunko Bingo parties teenagers rock and
[1:06:47] roll twist and all this stuff look at
[1:06:49] the Elvis Presley a devil standing in
[1:06:51] shoes
[1:06:53] Pat Boone Ricky Nelson the biggest
[1:06:55] indement this nation has ever had they
[1:06:58] say oh they're very religious they sang
[1:07:01] Christian songs it aren't the church
[1:07:04] ought to even permit a thing like that
[1:07:06] some of these guys go out here and deny
[1:07:08] it in a Road House out here dancing and
[1:07:11] playing music and everything the next
[1:07:13] night they come to the Altar and weep
[1:07:14] and the next night they're playing music
[1:07:16] on the platform
[1:07:18] see yes sir see so he says see uh
[1:07:22] approve himself first to be a man of God
[1:07:25] not all this stuff just because he can
[1:07:27] beat on an old guitar or something like
[1:07:29] that
[1:07:30] but see it's what the soul is craving
[1:07:35] ain't that right
[1:07:38] they think it's okay for women to wear
[1:07:40] shorts
[1:07:41] to Bob their hair
[1:07:44] to wear their makeup
[1:07:46] they see no problem with with social
[1:07:48] drinking
[1:07:51] hello
[1:07:52] they have no issues with homosexuality
[1:07:56] they have no issue supporting things
[1:07:59] that's against God
[1:08:02] they they see nothing wrong with rubbing
[1:08:06] shoulders with the world
[1:08:08] but see
[1:08:10] the prophet would tell us it satisfies
[1:08:13] the taste of their soul
[1:08:19] ain't that right
[1:08:21] the desire
[1:08:23] remember it's the dove that cannot just
[1:08:27] fit in with anything
[1:08:29] because it has a certain nature
[1:08:34] that won't let it just have any old diet
[1:08:38] it's the crow that that can fit in in
[1:08:42] anywhere he is
[1:08:45] ain't that right Christians are not to
[1:08:47] try to fit in
[1:08:51] ain't that right
[1:08:53] so again the soul is the throne room
[1:08:58] amen of uh is the throne room so when
[1:09:01] the soul of man became black and smutty
[1:09:05] with sin it changed the spirit of man
[1:09:10] his thoughts were different
[1:09:14] his habits changed
[1:09:16] his way of life changed
[1:09:19] and his Spirit conformed to the change
[1:09:23] ain't that right then his body or his
[1:09:26] flesh conformed to the change
[1:09:31] but the change started in the soul of
[1:09:34] man
[1:09:36] he acted different
[1:09:38] he did things that he normally wouldn't
[1:09:40] have done
[1:09:42] ain't that right
[1:09:45] uh you know
[1:09:47] one thing that I I want to say
[1:09:50] is that your flesh does not define
[1:09:54] as to whether or not you're a Christian
[1:09:57] or a sinner
[1:09:59] your flesh does not define you
[1:10:02] that's the outside man
[1:10:04] and it is governed by five senses right
[1:10:08] taste feel hear smell
[1:10:11] see
[1:10:13] five senses
[1:10:15] that this old outside man this flesh is
[1:10:18] governed by
[1:10:23] a lot of times we look at that outward
[1:10:27] and we'd say that's a Christian
[1:10:30] or that's a sinner
[1:10:33] and yet you cannot Define by the flesh
[1:10:39] hello
[1:10:42] now your spirit doesn't Define
[1:10:47] as to whether you are a Christian or a
[1:10:49] sinner
[1:10:51] for that is governed by five senses as
[1:10:54] well
[1:10:55] what is it imagination
[1:10:59] conscience
[1:11:00] memory
[1:11:02] uh
[1:11:04] uh reasoning
[1:11:06] affection
[1:11:07] now think of that
[1:11:09] these five senses control that spirit
[1:11:13] ain't that right
[1:11:16] but then as the prophet would tell us
[1:11:18] but that soul
[1:11:20] only has one Inlet
[1:11:23] to it
[1:11:24] and that is free moral agency
[1:11:29] ain't that right
[1:11:30] you have the right to choose
[1:11:33] or to reject
[1:11:37] now
[1:11:38] notice and we all know that the flesh
[1:11:41] can have a form of godliness
[1:11:44] a Godly appearance about it
[1:11:47] ain't that right
[1:11:49] be bully uh Peter even talked about
[1:11:51] people in this day having a form
[1:11:54] of godliness going to church singing
[1:11:58] songs amen and the preacher performing
[1:12:02] all duties of religion
[1:12:04] and and and yet that's the outward
[1:12:07] you say Amen
[1:12:09] in this age you know or well people have
[1:12:14] gone as far as not allow open toe shoes
[1:12:19] for women
[1:12:21] they've gone as far as to say that a
[1:12:25] woman can't even wear a necklace
[1:12:27] they've gone as far as to say no rings
[1:12:32] and a man
[1:12:34] shouldn't have a beard
[1:12:37] shouldn't have sideburns
[1:12:41] some of them even have the belief is on
[1:12:44] strict rules on the way a man Parts his
[1:12:47] hair
[1:12:50] but see it's it's all
[1:12:54] a form of godliness
[1:12:57] on the outside
[1:13:00] ain't that right yeah
[1:13:03] yeah but then the prophet says but that
[1:13:05] soul
[1:13:06] could be as black as pitch
[1:13:11] ain't that right
[1:13:14] don't get me wrong
[1:13:17] I'd rather I'd I'd rather you know uh
[1:13:20] see those uh that have that that
[1:13:24] religion
[1:13:26] of long dresses
[1:13:30] even if they do wear their bonnets
[1:13:33] and all that I think that's more Godly
[1:13:36] looking
[1:13:39] than some striptease
[1:13:43] ain't that right
[1:13:46] but see people put that that as though
[1:13:52] that's all you need
[1:13:56] ain't that right
[1:13:59] and it's even come into the holiness
[1:14:03] where legalism where that's all they
[1:14:07] they focus on
[1:14:11] is the outward appearance
[1:14:16] but then we find that your spirit we've
[1:14:19] talked about it we know it but I'm going
[1:14:21] to say it again
[1:14:23] your spirit can be anointed
[1:14:26] with the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:14:30] and your soul
[1:14:33] be lost
[1:14:36] ain't that right
[1:14:38] brother Brown says church members want a
[1:14:40] denomination filter
[1:14:42] so that they can have their own desire
[1:14:46] and still be classed religious people
[1:14:51] and you hear them say oh he's very
[1:14:53] religious
[1:14:56] oh he's a Christian
[1:15:00] because they're looking at the two
[1:15:02] elements
[1:15:04] the outward appearance
[1:15:07] and what he is in his spirit
[1:15:11] hello
[1:15:15] and I said that about Elvis
[1:15:18] he's a Christian and yet brother Brown
[1:15:20] would say he's the devil in shoes
[1:15:23] standing in shoes
[1:15:25] ain't that right
[1:15:29] people get so mixed up
[1:15:34] which we were all mixed up before we
[1:15:36] come to the message
[1:15:39] they consider many of these Chris uh
[1:15:41] country singers and rock and roll Stars
[1:15:44] to be religious
[1:15:48] because they mix gospel
[1:15:52] in with their songs
[1:15:59] they put the name of Jesus in some of
[1:16:01] their songs
[1:16:03] and the church nominal accepts it
[1:16:08] can you say Amen
[1:16:10] why would they accept such a thing as
[1:16:12] this I'll tell you why their soul is
[1:16:16] thirsting for it
[1:16:22] you say man
[1:16:25] see brother Brown said something it's
[1:16:28] something down on the inside drawing
[1:16:32] and we're gonna get somewhere and I I
[1:16:34] I'm not going to keep you long but
[1:16:36] hopefully I can get my point
[1:16:40] see something is drawing
[1:16:43] pull it craving
[1:16:47] and brother Baron said the soul
[1:16:50] is drawing your resource through the
[1:16:54] outside down through the spirit into the
[1:16:58] soul
[1:17:02] now this is where you're a threefold
[1:17:04] being
[1:17:08] your eyes
[1:17:12] there's some people can't get their eyes
[1:17:14] off pornography
[1:17:19] so their their eyes
[1:17:23] are just constantly glued to it
[1:17:27] why
[1:17:29] because down in the not spirit
[1:17:33] in the soul
[1:17:37] it's feeding
[1:17:39] hello
[1:17:42] and that control tower
[1:17:45] in that soul that desire that craving
[1:17:51] is ruling over this body
[1:17:56] where they can't get their eyes out of
[1:17:58] the the books off the internet
[1:18:01] off the porn sites
[1:18:09] people can't get away from Gossip you
[1:18:12] hear you see people that just constantly
[1:18:14] gossip gossip gossip gossip why do they
[1:18:16] do this
[1:18:18] their soul
[1:18:21] is drawing
[1:18:25] hello
[1:18:28] and it's drawing through what we hear
[1:18:33] hello
[1:18:36] brother Rand says you know why why you
[1:18:40] know uh uh uh
[1:18:42] well first of all he says if the soul
[1:18:44] loves the world it's dead
[1:18:51] if the soul loves the world
[1:18:54] now most people don't take care of the
[1:18:56] Soul as we talked about
[1:19:00] they're trying to take care of the flesh
[1:19:03] they're looking at the Spirit
[1:19:07] and they reject the soul
[1:19:11] ain't that right
[1:19:12] they deny the soul
[1:19:14] the the fixing of the Soul so why does a
[1:19:18] man or woman smoke cigarettes
[1:19:21] it's to satisfy a desire
[1:19:25] right
[1:19:27] a crave a taste
[1:19:31] so then these companies and and brother
[1:19:34] Brandon talks about it in the think of
[1:19:35] man's filter
[1:19:37] these cigarette companies
[1:19:40] found a way
[1:19:43] to satisfy the taste
[1:19:46] ain't that right
[1:19:49] they come up with a filter to satisfy
[1:19:51] the taste of that smoker
[1:19:55] and to give them the taste they want
[1:19:58] now brother Branham would tell us so has
[1:20:02] the church
[1:20:05] have you ever just thought about why we
[1:20:06] got so many churches in the world today
[1:20:12] it's because they're trying to satisfy
[1:20:16] a certain taste
[1:20:21] ain't that right
[1:20:24] see it's it it's not just you know if if
[1:20:27] it was just a cigarette
[1:20:30] while one brand would be great
[1:20:33] they've got all these brands
[1:20:37] he goes some may not like this certain
[1:20:39] brand
[1:20:40] so they want this certain brand
[1:20:43] and they don't want that certain brand
[1:20:45] so they want this certain brand so
[1:20:46] there's all kinds of brands
[1:20:50] to fit the taste of the the the the uh
[1:20:55] the customer
[1:20:58] and it's it's come down to that same
[1:21:01] thing in religion
[1:21:05] if they don't get the taste they want
[1:21:07] then they don't want the cigarette ain't
[1:21:08] that right
[1:21:10] brother Brown said if they can't get the
[1:21:11] taste they want in religion they don't
[1:21:14] take the religion
[1:21:15] most of them they want women with shorts
[1:21:18] bobbed hair painted faces
[1:21:21] they want their women to be dressed sexy
[1:21:26] and the prophet said they love that
[1:21:28] they don't want their men acting like
[1:21:30] men
[1:21:32] they don't want the men to be the head
[1:21:34] of the home
[1:21:35] and to be that leader
[1:21:38] they call that dictatorship
[1:21:41] domineering can you say Amen
[1:21:44] I'm just going to throw this in to uh
[1:21:47] you know brother Brown says in in the
[1:21:49] book of Ephesians Paul you know of
[1:21:53] course he speaks of the mystery of a
[1:21:55] mystery there and that is the prophet
[1:21:58] says that how that a woman should
[1:22:01] reverence her husband
[1:22:03] you realize that's a mystery
[1:22:07] hello
[1:22:09] and it it must be a real mystery
[1:22:13] because very few women can do that in
[1:22:16] this day
[1:22:19] but I want to tell you men something too
[1:22:22] brother Brandon says then a husband
[1:22:26] ought to live such a life before his
[1:22:28] wife
[1:22:30] that his wife could reverence him as a
[1:22:33] son of God
[1:22:35] and if he doesn't live that kind of life
[1:22:39] hello
[1:22:40] then of course she wouldn't reverence
[1:22:42] him
[1:22:43] you don't demand reverence
[1:22:46] you don't demand respect
[1:22:50] that is given to you
[1:22:54] hello
[1:22:55] by the life you live
[1:22:58] so
[1:22:59] see she wouldn't respect him because she
[1:23:01] knows what he's made of
[1:23:03] but when it is a man that is a reverent
[1:23:07] man clean with his wife and before his
[1:23:11] family a real servant of God then the
[1:23:14] women the children and all should
[1:23:16] respect that servant of God with
[1:23:19] reverence
[1:23:23] but to Modern people's got a different
[1:23:25] taste
[1:23:28] they they they're not wanting this type
[1:23:31] of uh
[1:23:33] uh
[1:23:35] gospel
[1:23:37] hello
[1:23:41] so then we know that the spirit
[1:23:45] of a man can be absolutely anointed
[1:23:50] with the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:23:55] and the prophet said and make this
[1:23:57] outside body come into subjection
[1:24:03] hello now say that again
[1:24:06] the spirit
[1:24:08] can be absolutely Anointed with the
[1:24:11] genuine Holy Spirit
[1:24:13] and make this body come under subjection
[1:24:20] but Ezekiel 18 20 says the soul
[1:24:22] everybody say the soul
[1:24:25] the soul that sinneth
[1:24:27] it shall die
[1:24:32] ain't that right
[1:24:34] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[1:24:38] brother around says the soul that
[1:24:41] rejects and I want you to really listen
[1:24:43] now
[1:24:44] the soul that rejects in unbelief the
[1:24:48] word of God shall die
[1:24:54] ain't that right
[1:24:55] remember
[1:24:58] brother Branham telling us about the man
[1:25:00] who's just listening to it today but
[1:25:02] tell us about the man
[1:25:04] the two men
[1:25:07] that he uh
[1:25:09] he he first time going to a Pentecostal
[1:25:12] meeting
[1:25:13] and one man spoke in tongues the other
[1:25:16] man prophesied
[1:25:18] and he thought he's amongst Angels you
[1:25:20] know
[1:25:21] and he said I got to meet them two men
[1:25:23] so he met the first one he said man he
[1:25:26] said you know I have a way God gave me
[1:25:29] gave him a way to find out and as he was
[1:25:31] talking to him he caught his spirit and
[1:25:33] he said that man
[1:25:34] was a genuine believer
[1:25:38] man that's right
[1:25:41] so we met the other one
[1:25:43] and he must have been an arrogant turkey
[1:25:47] they asked brother Brian you've spoken
[1:25:48] tongue Chad
[1:25:50] no
[1:25:51] well you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:53] but he said as he began to talk with him
[1:25:55] he realized that man was the most
[1:25:56] hypocritical person
[1:25:58] right living with a a woman that was not
[1:26:02] his wife
[1:26:03] living in adultery had children by her
[1:26:07] and now I thought I was amongst devils
[1:26:11] right
[1:26:14] so see it it it it was a true anointing
[1:26:19] look at Balaam we talked about him
[1:26:23] how he was anointed but he was a false
[1:26:25] prophet
[1:26:26] his prophecy was right
[1:26:29] his Doctrine was wrong
[1:26:32] ain't that right
[1:26:34] so the anointing listen the anointing
[1:26:37] that came upon him
[1:26:40] could not bring him subject to the word
[1:26:43] of God
[1:26:47] to the word of the hour can you say man
[1:26:52] now this is where laodicea
[1:26:56] stands today the church
[1:26:59] Revelations 3 15 says I Know Thy works
[1:27:02] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:27:05] I would that thou were cold or hot so
[1:27:07] then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:27:10] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:27:13] out of my mouth ain't that right
[1:27:15] because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:27:18] increase with goods and have need of
[1:27:20] nothing
[1:27:22] and no it's not that thou art wretched
[1:27:25] miserable poor blind and naked
[1:27:29] ain't that right
[1:27:31] have need of nothing
[1:27:33] Matthew 7 22.
[1:27:36] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:27:40] Lord
[1:27:41] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[1:27:43] in thy name have cast out devils and in
[1:27:45] thy name done many wonderful works
[1:27:48] then will I profess unto them I never
[1:27:52] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:27:55] iniquity
[1:27:57] so this of course is is has been a
[1:28:00] mystery to the church
[1:28:03] until the Prophet come and and and
[1:28:05] expose this
[1:28:07] and revealed it to what it is but Jesus
[1:28:10] was prophesying of this day and this is
[1:28:13] why it's the most deceiving age ever
[1:28:17] ain't that right
[1:28:19] because they are anointed with a genuine
[1:28:23] anointing
[1:28:26] brother Brown says that Holy Spirit can
[1:28:29] fall upon a man in his spirit
[1:28:32] but his soul everybody say his soul is
[1:28:36] his germ and that germ is the word
[1:28:40] he said so I don't care how much you can
[1:28:42] preach how well you do this and how much
[1:28:45] you love he said that's one of the
[1:28:47] inlets to Spirit you can't love with
[1:28:50] your body you love with your spirit
[1:28:51] that's one of the inlets and you can
[1:28:54] love and even love God and still not be
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:59] you can cast out devils and preach and
[1:29:02] do things and still not be right Jesus
[1:29:05] said so many would come in that day that
[1:29:08] word everybody say that word
[1:29:10] settles it
[1:29:12] and you say Amen
[1:29:14] see so your flesh nor your spirit being
[1:29:17] anointed of God tells whether you're a
[1:29:20] Believer or not
[1:29:22] look at that Jacob outwardly he was
[1:29:24] better than east or or Esau he was
[1:29:27] outwardly he was better than Jacob
[1:29:30] he was religious on the outside but on
[1:29:33] the inside look what he was
[1:29:36] ain't that right brother Ram said his
[1:29:39] thinking was not filtered
[1:29:43] my
[1:29:45] his thinking was not filtered see he
[1:29:48] thought that the birthright didn't mean
[1:29:51] as much as God said it did
[1:29:56] ain't that right
[1:29:58] see he should have filtered that
[1:30:02] thinking through the word of God
[1:30:07] that he was hungry
[1:30:10] so he says what different does it make
[1:30:14] don't Jacob you can have it ain't that
[1:30:17] right
[1:30:19] cast it all aside
[1:30:22] but it showed what his soul was
[1:30:28] it showed what he was down deep in that
[1:30:31] Soul can you say Amen
[1:30:33] brother Ram talks about Eve and Judas
[1:30:37] how they sold their Birthright to
[1:30:39] satisfy their Taste of knowledge of
[1:30:42] civilization
[1:30:44] he said eve sold it for a little taste
[1:30:47] of science a little taste of worldly
[1:30:49] knowledge and a little better church a
[1:30:52] little better class of people today it
[1:30:54] would be called Judah sowed his
[1:30:56] Birthright for 30 pieces of silver and
[1:30:59] uh uh to make a few extra dollars my
[1:31:03] congregation can pay me better over here
[1:31:05] I'll just preach over here see well if I
[1:31:08] become that preacher see there were
[1:31:10] ministers that told Brother Brown said
[1:31:12] well we believe the message you brought
[1:31:15] but if we were to preach that
[1:31:19] our our church would put us out
[1:31:22] it showed now think of that anointed
[1:31:26] preaching
[1:31:28] and yet it showed where the taste was
[1:31:35] they were tasting
[1:31:36] they their taste was for a popularity
[1:31:40] their taste was for a big congregation
[1:31:44] their taste can you say Amen
[1:31:46] I tried see and down in their soul The
[1:31:50] Taste even though they knew that the
[1:31:52] message was right The Taste was not for
[1:31:56] the revealed word of the hour
[1:32:01] ain't that right
[1:32:03] Brandon said or well Paul talked about
[1:32:05] how there are preachers that that have
[1:32:07] different motives as to why they preach
[1:32:10] preach they say they preach Christ
[1:32:11] they're preaching the gospel
[1:32:13] but down in their soul
[1:32:17] is where it's where it's all matters
[1:32:21] can you say man
[1:32:23] anointed yes
[1:32:27] but we're finding out more and more that
[1:32:29] these preachers that have preached under
[1:32:31] an anointing did not have the right
[1:32:34] taste for this message
[1:32:39] can you say Amen
[1:32:41] people that had been anointed and danced
[1:32:44] and shouted and woken away from the
[1:32:46] message
[1:32:48] it showed that their soul had a
[1:32:50] different taste all along
[1:32:55] is that right
[1:32:59] so we find that
[1:33:03] Judas
[1:33:05] being anointed to cast out devils and
[1:33:08] yet the son of perdition
[1:33:12] you didn't have the taste
[1:33:14] that Peter had
[1:33:17] see so you cannot judge by the outward
[1:33:19] you cannot judge by by how a man is
[1:33:24] Anointed
[1:33:25] but now let's flip the coin for a moment
[1:33:28] and look at the other side
[1:33:31] brother van said your still Sons and
[1:33:33] Daughters of God
[1:33:36] no matter how far you stooped in sin
[1:33:40] hello
[1:33:42] you are falling
[1:33:44] degenerated in your soul and mine
[1:33:48] but God is your creator
[1:33:54] Lutheran said in your Fallen estate
[1:33:58] you are a lost undone creation of God
[1:34:04] dominated by the devil
[1:34:11] right
[1:34:14] now think of that here's a prophet
[1:34:18] telling us that even though we were out
[1:34:22] in sin brother Bill
[1:34:24] drinking partying whatever
[1:34:30] you were degenerate
[1:34:32] in your soul your mind
[1:34:35] but you were a Son of God a daughter of
[1:34:37] God
[1:34:41] right
[1:34:45] and it may look like we were just like
[1:34:47] the rest of them and Paul said we were
[1:34:49] like the rest of them
[1:34:54] but yet the prophet still calls us Sons
[1:34:57] and Daughters of God
[1:35:00] Now isn't this the story of the woman at
[1:35:03] the well
[1:35:04] she was a prostitute
[1:35:09] that's what Jesus matter in that
[1:35:11] condition he met her when she was a
[1:35:14] prostitute an outcast
[1:35:17] ain't that right
[1:35:19] but notice God didn't make her a
[1:35:21] prostitute
[1:35:23] the devil made her a prostitute
[1:35:27] she come into this world
[1:35:32] a fallen
[1:35:34] degenerate inner soul and mind
[1:35:38] and Satan dominated her
[1:35:42] and made her a prostitute
[1:35:45] but inside of her soul
[1:35:51] was a gene seed of God that was
[1:35:54] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:35:57] the world
[1:36:01] ain't that right
[1:36:02] and when she saw the Messiah sign being
[1:36:07] done what did it do it quickened that
[1:36:11] Gene seed
[1:36:15] amen Prophet said quickly her sins were
[1:36:18] forgiven her
[1:36:21] ain't that right
[1:36:25] she said I know when the Messiah cometh
[1:36:27] he'll do these things
[1:36:29] and Jesus says I am he
[1:36:31] ain't that right now brother Branham
[1:36:34] says see she was putting the old
[1:36:37] scripture with the experience that Jesus
[1:36:40] was given to her and what did it do it
[1:36:43] made him the Messiah to her
[1:36:48] she was the way she was yes
[1:36:52] and by the outward appearance
[1:36:56] we could have looked and said there's no
[1:36:58] hope for her
[1:37:00] bitter taste was different
[1:37:04] hello
[1:37:05] she just hadn't met Messiah yet
[1:37:09] she just hadn't come to the revealed
[1:37:11] word of God yet
[1:37:14] and when Jesus showed her the accurate
[1:37:17] sign
[1:37:19] it quickened and satisfied the taste
[1:37:29] so he says he putting the old scripture
[1:37:31] with the experience that Jesus was given
[1:37:33] to her what did it do it made the
[1:37:34] Messiah
[1:37:35] and did you notice quickly her sins were
[1:37:37] forgiven because at the beginning she
[1:37:39] was redeemable
[1:37:41] everybody say she was redeemable
[1:37:43] she was redeemable
[1:37:46] see you couldn't look at her flesh
[1:37:48] it was down what was in that soul
[1:37:52] ain't that right
[1:37:53] and it showed that she was redeemable
[1:37:58] hope you understand that
[1:38:00] see you're not a Christian by your flesh
[1:38:02] if you are you're still a sinner
[1:38:10] right
[1:38:12] it redeemed her or brought her back when
[1:38:15] she seen the express scripture
[1:38:16] manifested of Jehovah what he was and
[1:38:19] what he is
[1:38:22] she didn't say Sir you're Beelzebub
[1:38:26] right
[1:38:29] she said I perceive that you're a
[1:38:30] prophet
[1:38:32] and when Jesus said I am heat there was
[1:38:35] no more doubt you didn't have to explain
[1:38:37] it she saw it
[1:38:38] she believed it
[1:38:41] hello
[1:38:42] is that where you're at
[1:38:44] amen David was satisfied
[1:38:47] he saw it
[1:38:49] he believed it
[1:38:52] that's where this bride is today
[1:38:55] she's she saw the revealed word of God
[1:38:59] she knows that the lamb has opened the
[1:39:01] book
[1:39:02] and she's not looking at a closed book
[1:39:04] she's looking at a revealed book
[1:39:07] and she's seeing not only the lamb but
[1:39:09] she's seeing herself
[1:39:11] and not only she's not just seeing
[1:39:13] herself apart from the lamb she is the
[1:39:16] Tabernacle of God himself
[1:39:19] can you say Amen
[1:39:21] she's seeing this
[1:39:24] she's seeing the unfolding
[1:39:29] not just the Melchizedek Ministry
[1:39:33] on and not just putting the Sun a minute
[1:39:36] son of man Ministry to brother Branham
[1:39:39] but the word is taking a hold in her
[1:39:44] satisfied
[1:39:49] so I'm going to tell you something
[1:39:52] if people start questioning this message
[1:39:56] questioning these things to you
[1:39:58] don't you look at that as wisdom
[1:40:01] you look at it as they're not being fed
[1:40:03] in their soul
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:08] Satan will reason the word with you
[1:40:11] he'll reason it until till he's got you
[1:40:13] in such a a a a a a trap
[1:40:17] can you say man
[1:40:20] amen but when when Satan came to Jesus
[1:40:23] and started questioning
[1:40:26] now you know he did he started
[1:40:28] questioning the devil always questions
[1:40:31] the word
[1:40:33] that's how he gets you every time he'll
[1:40:35] question he'll question your experience
[1:40:37] he'll question if God loves you he'll
[1:40:40] question whether you're not you're a Son
[1:40:41] of God he questioned Jesus on that if
[1:40:44] thou be the son of God
[1:40:47] what was he doing he was trying to put
[1:40:49] questions
[1:40:55] but Jesus wouldn't listen to them
[1:40:57] questions
[1:40:58] he would answer right back it is written
[1:41:02] can you say Amen
[1:41:05] what did he do he put a balance to the
[1:41:07] word of God
[1:41:09] Satan took the scriptures and put it way
[1:41:11] over there and way over there
[1:41:14] but Jesus would put it right back into
[1:41:16] balance
[1:41:22] and notice
[1:41:24] when she caught it brother Brown says no
[1:41:26] more doubt you didn't have to explain it
[1:41:28] she saw it she believed it and away she
[1:41:30] went why what did it do to her it
[1:41:33] redeemed her
[1:41:35] it redeemed her
[1:41:37] ain't that right
[1:41:39] see it showed that she was a fallen
[1:41:42] thought of God before the foundation of
[1:41:44] the world
[1:41:46] I I'm not I'm not going to say that
[1:41:47] maybe you know uh well well I I don't
[1:41:50] believe that the scriptures never said
[1:41:52] she ever went back to prostitution again
[1:41:55] never can you say Amen why her soul was
[1:41:59] restored
[1:42:04] ain't that right
[1:42:06] her soul
[1:42:08] went from being a degenerate soul to a
[1:42:12] restored soul
[1:42:20] which brought her body under subjection
[1:42:23] to the word
[1:42:26] can you say man
[1:42:28] now see he came to be a redeemer
[1:42:32] what does redeem mean to bring back why
[1:42:34] did he get in the pre why didn't he get
[1:42:36] the priest he was never up there he had
[1:42:38] no representation
[1:42:41] you say man
[1:42:42] listen he came to redeem that which had
[1:42:45] fallen and in the fall this this girl
[1:42:49] got messed up
[1:42:52] that God had her in his thinking before
[1:42:54] the foundation of the world and he come
[1:42:57] to cleanse her
[1:42:58] she everybody say she had
[1:43:02] eternal life
[1:43:06] I hope that helps I hope it makes some
[1:43:08] sense to you
[1:43:10] she had eternal life
[1:43:14] now I know she's you know she probably
[1:43:16] had scars in her body
[1:43:18] or whatever from being a prostitute or
[1:43:20] whatever she in the past or spirit and
[1:43:23] all these things bringing up the
[1:43:25] memories and this and and all of these
[1:43:27] things
[1:43:28] you haven't just as much
[1:43:36] but the soul
[1:43:39] was satisfied
[1:43:41] the soul right
[1:43:45] in order to be sheep
[1:43:48] see it has to come from the soul
[1:43:53] in order to follow the shepherd it has
[1:43:55] to come from the soul
[1:43:57] Psalm 63 8 David said my soul
[1:44:01] followeth hard after thee my soul
[1:44:07] God never intended us
[1:44:09] for us to be led by our five senses
[1:44:13] you must not everybody say I must not
[1:44:16] be led
[1:44:17] by what I see
[1:44:20] by what I hear
[1:44:22] by what I feel
[1:44:24] hello
[1:44:27] you must not be lit
[1:44:31] by your affections
[1:44:33] by your memory
[1:44:36] hello
[1:44:39] you must not be led
[1:44:42] by your reasoning
[1:44:46] right
[1:44:49] now listen this flesh can still be
[1:44:51] tempted
[1:44:54] red Brown said you make many mistakes
[1:44:58] ain't that right
[1:45:01] but the soul
[1:45:03] has been restored
[1:45:05] amen the soul
[1:45:09] ain't that right
[1:45:10] now we can all I hope I believe that we
[1:45:14] can we can say with David my soul follow
[1:45:18] his heart after thee
[1:45:21] my soul
[1:45:24] you say man
[1:45:26] see if these senses are trying to lead
[1:45:29] you away from what God Said for this day
[1:45:31] then stay with the word
[1:45:36] is that right
[1:45:39] and brother round talks about that
[1:45:40] outside man he says the outside man
[1:45:42] feeds on things that
[1:45:44] see it it makes the Inside Man
[1:45:48] see it it feeds on things at the the
[1:45:50] Inside Man doesn't
[1:45:52] the outside man he says feeds on
[1:45:54] psychology
[1:45:56] and intellectual
[1:46:00] right
[1:46:03] whereas the inside man that spiritual
[1:46:06] man
[1:46:08] feeds off the word of God
[1:46:12] so you see why I hit psychology a lot
[1:46:17] if you want psychology there's there's
[1:46:19] other places you can have
[1:46:24] that a prophet said it's the outside man
[1:46:27] that feeds off that and intellectual
[1:46:30] we got smart men in this message trying
[1:46:32] to bring psychology in
[1:46:37] but the spiritual man noticed the
[1:46:40] prophet said see if you give him the
[1:46:42] spiritual man the right of way he might
[1:46:44] lead you to a little Mission somewhere
[1:46:46] where there's not many people but the
[1:46:49] spirit of the Living God is there
[1:46:53] the Lord yes sir and you say Amen
[1:46:56] so he separates the Holy Spirit from
[1:46:59] psychology
[1:47:01] so when they say the Holy Ghost is the
[1:47:03] greatest psychologist there ever is
[1:47:05] that's coming from intellectual Minds
[1:47:14] now listen
[1:47:15] what made you desire God in the first
[1:47:18] place
[1:47:20] I'm going to close
[1:47:23] but what made you desire God
[1:47:27] you know as the Bible says we were born
[1:47:30] in sin shape and iniquity come into this
[1:47:32] world speaking lies
[1:47:35] ain't that right
[1:47:39] and
[1:47:41] you know brother Brian said that we we
[1:47:43] we had no
[1:47:46] uh we had no chance
[1:47:50] in life
[1:47:52] not when it comes to that our birth was
[1:47:54] wrong
[1:47:55] the nature everything it was wrong
[1:47:59] but see you desired God he says because
[1:48:03] down deep inside your soul
[1:48:08] was a predestinated seat of God
[1:48:12] now say your flesh the flesh Works
[1:48:15] contrary
[1:48:17] the flesh only has the five senses to
[1:48:20] contact this earth right so if you're
[1:48:23] ever going to try to find God and walk
[1:48:25] with God by your five senses by what you
[1:48:27] see taste smell here and all that you'll
[1:48:29] never do that
[1:48:30] well then your spirit see has them five
[1:48:33] inlets and and it it can be anointed and
[1:48:36] yet not walk with God
[1:48:39] not not not come subject to God
[1:48:42] he can anoint you
[1:48:44] you can own a man well to where he
[1:48:46] prophesies the body comes under
[1:48:48] subjection to that and he can dream a
[1:48:51] dream
[1:48:51] he can prophesy speak in tongues he and
[1:48:55] to be right
[1:48:58] give him the word test though
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:03] when that anointing is off he's still
[1:49:04] arrogant
[1:49:06] but he cried he shed tears
[1:49:09] he'd come to an altar
[1:49:13] but when that anointing lives
[1:49:15] watch what is in his soul what is the
[1:49:18] taste
[1:49:20] what is the desire what is the craving
[1:49:24] you with me
[1:49:27] but you've desired God because down in
[1:49:30] your soul there was a predestinated seed
[1:49:32] which was eternal life that was always
[1:49:36] laying there
[1:49:40] so Jesus said my sheep will hear my
[1:49:43] voice a stranger they will not follow
[1:49:45] because there is life down in the soul
[1:49:50] you'll never be able to be educated
[1:49:52] enough to be sheep
[1:49:55] you'll never be able to be taught by the
[1:49:58] greatest teachers of today to make you
[1:50:00] sheep
[1:50:02] you'll never be able to listen to tapes
[1:50:04] long enough to make you sheep
[1:50:08] you can read this Bible backward and
[1:50:10] four two times a year it'll never make
[1:50:12] you sheep
[1:50:14] right
[1:50:16] but the desire come because there's a
[1:50:19] predestinated seed
[1:50:23] bird brown said life connects with life
[1:50:26] sin connects with sin and sin is so
[1:50:30] hypocritical until it thinks it's saved
[1:50:33] when it isn't saved it's in the very
[1:50:35] depths of hypocrisy
[1:50:41] right
[1:50:44] now notice
[1:50:46] as I will let you go brother Brian says
[1:50:51] just as there is the eternal life there
[1:50:52] is also Eternal death for the people not
[1:50:56] eternal hell
[1:50:58] Eternal death
[1:51:00] and he talks about how that many people
[1:51:02] are religious today out in the world
[1:51:04] that has always been dead and will
[1:51:06] remain that way
[1:51:08] because it's Eternal death
[1:51:12] First Timothy 5 and 6 break it in she
[1:51:15] that liveth in pleasure is dead while
[1:51:17] she liveth
[1:51:19] knows what brother Brown says now he
[1:51:21] said he has a lot to say about it but
[1:51:24] this is just one and and so I'm not
[1:51:27] going to take a lot there but he says
[1:51:29] the woman that liveth in pleasure with
[1:51:30] her bobbed hair painted face is dead
[1:51:32] while she's alive
[1:51:34] the Bible said so she may be religious
[1:51:36] but she's never was saved she's got an
[1:51:40] outward motion she might sing in the
[1:51:42] choir she might dance in the spirit she
[1:51:43] might speak in tongues and have all the
[1:51:45] manifestations of the spirit but unless
[1:51:48] that Soul on the inside is is God's
[1:51:51] daughter she is gone no matter what she
[1:51:54] does
[1:51:57] hello
[1:52:00] outwardly Israel was all spiritual
[1:52:04] they were filled with God's goodness
[1:52:06] they reverenced God and so forth but
[1:52:08] that didn't work
[1:52:10] brother Brown said it was the inside of
[1:52:12] them they couldn't recognize the word
[1:52:14] itself
[1:52:18] is that right
[1:52:20] outwardly they had it all
[1:52:23] but on the inside they could not
[1:52:26] recognize the word
[1:52:30] and remember when the Giants come they
[1:52:33] were at unrest
[1:52:35] and every problems come unrest
[1:52:40] because they couldn't recognize that the
[1:52:42] word of God was leading them
[1:52:44] are you with me
[1:52:48] now as I close
[1:52:50] what made you come to the message and
[1:52:51] leave it
[1:52:53] what makes you follow the shepherd
[1:52:58] on the inside
[1:53:01] of the inside
[1:53:04] something
[1:53:06] began to draw
[1:53:09] something
[1:53:11] begin to call
[1:53:13] can you say Amen
[1:53:15] Abraham said it was something that told
[1:53:17] you there was a god somewhere and you
[1:53:19] began to read his word which is God's
[1:53:21] filter
[1:53:22] he said when you take God's filter and
[1:53:24] draw your life your desires if you draw
[1:53:28] your desires through God's filter they
[1:53:30] think in men's filter there is nothing
[1:53:31] left but the Holy Ghost
[1:53:33] now if you want the evidence of the Holy
[1:53:36] Ghost there it is when that soul of
[1:53:38] yours will line with the word of God in
[1:53:41] every respect it shows that you've
[1:53:44] drawed your life through the thinking
[1:53:46] man's filter God's filtered his word
[1:53:50] then that shows that in you was that
[1:53:54] predestinated seed down in you that
[1:53:56] makes you hunger for God
[1:54:01] how many hungers for God
[1:54:04] younger for God
[1:54:10] now brother Brian tells you why
[1:54:13] because there's a predestinated seed
[1:54:17] down in your soul
[1:54:24] all that the father hath given me
[1:54:29] to redeem they died with me at Calvary
[1:54:32] they raised with me in the resurrection
[1:54:34] and all that he has given me will come
[1:54:36] to me
[1:54:38] and they'll be placed in the body where
[1:54:40] foot arm nose mouth whatever it is
[1:54:42] they'll be placed in there and they will
[1:54:44] come to me in their seasons
[1:54:47] and you say Amen
[1:54:49] and notice all the sin of the world is
[1:54:52] dead
[1:54:54] all the love of the world is dead
[1:54:58] why
[1:55:00] it's in your soul
[1:55:03] so David is saying my soul
[1:55:05] has been restored
[1:55:08] I'm not setting in the word I'm not
[1:55:10] setting in the revealed word of my age
[1:55:13] or my day
[1:55:14] I'm not in the Green Pastures looking
[1:55:16] around saying man I wished I had
[1:55:18] something else
[1:55:20] I'm finding that the more I I see the
[1:55:25] word of God the more I feed off the word
[1:55:27] of God
[1:55:28] the more contented I am
[1:55:31] the more solidified my heart is
[1:55:35] can you say man
[1:55:37] my soul
[1:55:39] has found the right taste
[1:55:42] and it's drawing from that source
[1:55:45] I don't want to look at the old filth
[1:55:47] anymore
[1:55:48] I don't want to be around the old filth
[1:55:51] anymore
[1:55:52] I I just don't that's not my taste
[1:55:56] I have found the right thing
[1:55:58] then you say man
[1:56:00] I found it
[1:56:02] and I found out
[1:56:04] it wasn't a preacher that you had done
[1:56:05] it
[1:56:07] I had eternal life from the foundation
[1:56:09] of the world
[1:56:11] and I did not reflect that eternal life
[1:56:15] because I didn't know
[1:56:17] but when the word flashed across my path
[1:56:22] quickened
[1:56:24] can you say Amen
[1:56:25] if the musicians will come
[1:56:28] I hope it was all right I hope it made
[1:56:30] some sense to you
[1:56:32] brother Brown says when a thinking man
[1:56:34] begins to think who he's going to stand
[1:56:36] before and what the word of God is when
[1:56:39] he begins to think then when he draws
[1:56:42] through that there's nothing can get to
[1:56:44] it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's
[1:56:47] the germ seed word from the beginning
[1:56:49] that you was in God at the beginning
[1:56:51] standing here drawing the seed life
[1:56:55] the seed is in your heart
[1:56:57] by four ordering of four ordination the
[1:57:01] seed is already in there by the
[1:57:03] foreknowledge of God predestinated and
[1:57:05] when it draws it can't draw through
[1:57:07] nothing
[1:57:09] else but the word
[1:57:15] I'm really going to Anchor that I'm I'm
[1:57:17] Really Gonna by God's grace we'll get
[1:57:19] more into that but there's nothing that
[1:57:22] it draws from
[1:57:24] but the word
[1:57:27] so nowhere no matter how I feel no
[1:57:29] matter what I'm in no matter what the
[1:57:31] day is
[1:57:33] my soul draws from the word alone
[1:57:38] did not Abraham do the same
[1:57:42] his body grew weaker
[1:57:44] he considered not the deadness of
[1:57:46] Sarah's womb he didn't consider himself
[1:57:49] getting older and more feeble his soul
[1:57:52] kept feeding off the promise
[1:57:56] can you see man
[1:57:58] so he says see then it's the taste of
[1:58:02] the thinking man the righteous man the
[1:58:03] holy man who sees the Bible that Jesus
[1:58:06] Christ is the same yesterday and forever
[1:58:09] what comes into that place down there
[1:58:12] talking about your soul that word that's
[1:58:15] in the heart I've hid my word in my
[1:58:19] heart
[1:58:20] that I sin not against thee
[1:58:23] can I ask you something what good would
[1:58:26] it be for David to sit in the Green
[1:58:27] Pastures
[1:58:30] if he was wanting something else
[1:58:33] what good would the shepherd what good
[1:58:35] would it be for the shepherd
[1:58:38] to lead him in Green Pastures and the
[1:58:41] Shepherd in his mindset these Grays and
[1:58:43] Green Pastures will fill their belly up
[1:58:45] this Green Pastures will provide
[1:58:47] strength for them these green pastors
[1:58:50] will give them a rest
[1:58:52] so he leads them by his own intelligence
[1:58:57] and then somehow the Sheep
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:04] what good would it be for God to open
[1:59:06] the word to you
[1:59:09] don't eat it
[1:59:11] can you say man
[1:59:13] he so Vindicated the word of God in this
[1:59:16] age
[1:59:18] that you can sit and count Every Man a
[1:59:20] liar that is contrary to this word
[1:59:23] and say my soul rests upon this
[1:59:28] ain't that right
[1:59:30] man so he says see then he's tasted
[1:59:34] see he says the only thing that can pass
[1:59:36] through the word is the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:38] the think of men's filter gives the holy
[1:59:40] man A Taste then he's tasted of the
[1:59:42] Heavenly things he's got the word of God
[1:59:44] in his heart he sees it manifested
[1:59:46] before him and his whole soul is wrapped
[1:59:51] into it and the world and all things is
[1:59:54] dead around him
[1:59:55] then you say man
[1:59:58] I said see it satisfies his taste he
[2:00:01] sees that Jesus Christ is the same
[2:00:02] yesterday today and forever there it is
[2:00:04] see him right before us doing the same
[2:00:07] things he did it satisfies the holy
[2:00:10] man's taste his thinking he knows then
[2:00:13] that he's passed from death and unto
[2:00:15] life and he loves he wants the word to
[2:00:19] be confirmed and Vindicated
[2:00:22] see that's what that's what the Sheep of
[2:00:24] God laughs
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:30] Walker we've been around that
[2:00:31] Pentecostal nonsense

[2:00:43] tactics

[2:00:47] pastor or preacher wants an altar call
[2:00:49] he just all he does is scare the people
[2:00:53] hang them over hell
[2:00:55] and the same people that was at the
[2:00:57] altar last week are at the altar again
[2:01:00] and it's just a rigmarole it's just
[2:01:02] constantly that way the people ain't
[2:01:04] getting anywheres
