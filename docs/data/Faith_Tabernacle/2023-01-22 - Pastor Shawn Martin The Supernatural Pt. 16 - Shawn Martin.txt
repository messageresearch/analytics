amen and when you look at his holiness we don't run as Adam did we don't stand in his presence condemned but his blood has covered us Amen to where we could stand in his presence and worship him lifting up holy hands and to our Lord and for he is certainly Worthy of our praise worthy of our adoration amen and it's certainly good to be here house of the Lord this morning and glad the weather held off and uh and the weather prophets were wrong today so this was good but it may it may happen tonight and that's that'd be all right with me as long as it ain't today praise the Lord but uh I love the Lord and always counted and honored the musicians can be dismissed we appreciate the musicians and appreciate sister Rihanna filling in there and um but we uh certainly appreciate the Bride of Jesus Christ and it's always a privilege just to be gathered with the people of God and um and good to have brother Enoch with us amen always miss you brother Enoch and our sister uh Elizabeth yeah I was thinking so I was saying man I don't know if I should say Elizabeth or not but uh this case I was wrong I uh I had got acquainted with a brother from Ohio one time when I was pastoring in Pennsylvania and they came up and um so when I I just met him and and so he gave me his name so I was uh you want to welcome him you know and I said well it's it's good to have um brother John here with us you know and he just smiles and you know and but that smile I knew I'd done something wrong you know so I said well I I know it's not John it's Mark you know it's good to have brother Mark and that smile stayed there it's like oh boy you know so afterwards I said what's your name he goes Earl oh my oh so anyway it was really good to have Earl with us amen but uh anyways I'm not good at names but uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians and um the first chapter praise the Lord and I for those uh who have who had asked for tithe receipts last year uh I automatically uh made a tie the receipt for you this year for this year as well so um so if you got one last year there should be one ready for you this year so brother Josiah's got them to give to you I did notice that there was one or two that I did not get printed off and and you have to forgive me we went to service last night and didn't get in until really late and uh I think we got to bed at two and so uh anyway so it's my bad so if you did not get a a if if there's not one there and you had gotten one last year or been getting one and it's not there just let brother Josiah know he can let me know and that way we can get it taken care of tonight praise the Lord and her by tonight so we had a just a powerful meeting a couple weeks ago and I I trust that you all enjoyed it and I I believe the Lord met with us what a wonderful word we had and and just an anointing and and I believe it was a a great help to all then it was here and those that had heard over the internet and and uh so I just uh enjoy the presence of the Lord amen and so uh here we're going to read uh the book of Ephesians um and we're just going to read start at the 22nd verse but it says and hath but all things under his feet and we know that speaking of Christ and gave him to be the head over all things to the church so Christ is the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all the church being the body of Christ amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly we see you as Worthy Lord as holy it was you know we I no doubt had been preached throughout the years the ages of you being Worthy the Lord you proved it in this age when no man no angel no nothing Lord could open the book but Lord you opened it and father we're so thankful for it Lord and Lord we just praise you we give you glory and we give you this service and asking that you would have the preeminence now Lord speak to every heart Speak to My Heart Lord for we're only just the vessel that is who we lend to you father that oh God we're all needy here this morning it may when we leave this place today we we're known that we've been with you father I pray that you would just take every spirit that is contrary bring it under subjection Lord and may you just have your way today in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can be seated praise the Lord I want to continue with the title the supernatural and I'll probably just continue on until I don't feel to do so but we know and and we must remember and it must be more than just knowledge but it must be a reality but the Christian Life is a supernatural it's It's Supernatural there's nothing natural about it you come to church this morning there had been something that made you come that compelled you to come if you lift your hands to Worship the Lord there's something behind that and and everything is is is is is Supernatural motivating the Christian Life and God is Supernatural and the work of redemption is Supernatural the the fruit of the spirit is Supernatural the armor of God that we are told to put on it's all Supernatural there's nothing natural about it and the works that Jesus said that we as his body would do the Greater Works that's Supernatural there's nothing natural about it and so and it's because his body is is is the one and the only one that holds the supernatural life of God and and so we're we we should be acquainted every day we should be acquainted with the supernatural um uh you you can't come in the presence of God without experiencing a supernatural touch a supernatural Miracle a supernatural working it's It's Supernatural and so um and and we know that the supernatural works that Jesus did uh is the thing that let the people know that God was with him a man God would manifest himself through Christ through that body of Christ uh physical body uh and and The Works were Supernatural and and so here even in John 3 and 2 uh Nicodemus came to Jesus by night and and said we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him amen now that was the physical body of of Christ and now we are the body uh the spiritual body of Christ and and so it's the works that declare it's the works it's not because you joined up uh with an organization that does not declare that God is with you it's not because you you even even to a point of even getting emotional and and running around the building and all of that that's that's that's not that's not the the uh uh sign that God is with you uh but the Greater Works The Works that Jesus did we are to do today amen and so but the works that Jesus did uh starting to ring for some reason uh but the works that Jesus did were was above and beyond any human ability whatsoever he healed the sick he made the lane to walk he he raised the dead he opened the blinded eyes rather rather than going to the hospital in our building hospitals uh Jesus would heal the sick he would heal the blind he would uh you know instead of building insane institutions he would restore their minds back and he would just cast the demons out and and uh uh uh these things instead of using psychology on the people he would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and and uh for he was the word ain't that right so all of his Works were Supernatural and they still are Supernatural amen that's right and and so that's why brother Brown said God never did tell the church to go build hospitals amen uh he told them to cast The Devils out he told him to lay hands on the sick and they would recover but he said what is the what is the church doing their their building programs they're building hospitals they're they're they're leaning to the Natural side of the human effort and that's not what God called the body of Christ to do it's it's we are called to work in the Supernatural realm a man and so then we find that if if you have an experience with God your experience will be Supernatural uh your walk with God will be Supernatural your calling your adoption your your your uh Salvation everything about it is Supernatural ain't that right and and so then we find that this new birth is a supernatural happening it it it it's it's beyond uh uh excitement it's beyond sensation it's it's it's beyond the the the the chills and the Thrills and and all of that and and I believe that comes with it but uh uh but that's not the new birth the new birth is a supernatural happening and and we've we find that in in John 3 and 3 it says accept a man because Jesus tells Nicodemus he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so it takes a new birth to be able to understand the kingdom of God and he said Nicodemus says unto him well how can a man be born when he is owed so he's got a carnal mind he's looking at a carnal at a carnal happening he's thinking it's a carnal birth it's something carnal he's got to do he says can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered verily verily I send to thee accepted man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit ain't that right time so we find that the the church as a whole and and I'm I'm talking of the natural Church the church's natural they've gotten away from the Supernatural and and so then uh uh they want to put everything uh to the Natural side that Human Side human effort everything human uh uh so what what the prophets say they shake the preacher's hand and joined the church and that that that constitutes to them salvation I'm going to heaven right I write your name on the roll and and now you're part of the church speak in tongues and you've got the Holy Ghost and and run the aisle shout and you've got eternal life and uh you know and then you've got those that like the Catholics that that you pay a certain amount of money if you've never been to a Catholic uh thing uh we've been to a couple of them just to go in and look at it and and I remember going one time and seeing a bunch of candles all all around the altar just just hundreds of them and and and certain you know there would be uh one or two that would lie to a couple candles but I went up there and looked and and there was a price on every candle that you light and and you had to pay that price whether it be a quarter whether it be a dollar whether it be inflation today it might be five you know but uh uh it it it it it you had to pay uh uh just to light the candle I went to Walmart and bought my own candles you know but but they do that as a form of worship as though it's going to get them out of purgatory and and and and and you know and and and these things see and and so but it but it they lean to the Natural side of things the natural effort The Works of man seeing him Mary's uh so many times uh uh guarantees them certain results and and and things like that so so the church has looked to the Natural works of man for so long that he no longer looks to the Supernatural and the supernatural becomes a foreign thing to him a man uh today you know we've got they they have their professional choirs they they have their educated preachers well-trained and they've got their professional programs they've got their professional dancers you realize there's people that actually work at dancing and and they they practice that and then they get in the church and they and they dance it's it's it's it's it's professional dancing it's professional ministers and it's it's it's you know uh professional musicians and and all these things but church we don't want professionalism amen that we we we're wanting the supernatural that that that's what we want we we want see so a man cannot be born again without the supernatural a a person cannot be healed without the supernatural I don't care how much medicine you take it it'll take the supernatural element Amen to touch that body or you'll never get healed it ain't that right amen you you cannot be a part of the body of Christ without the supernatural you we cannot even be an invincible Army without the supernatural you realize that we need the supernatural we cannot do the Greater Works with without the supernatural I don't care you know we we can have everything perfect to a t mechanically wise but but as the prophet said it's the Dynamics ain't there it ain't going to work it just ain't gonna run ain't that right and and so now I I want to make very clear to you as we go here um uh that that the spirit of God of course is the Supernatural and it can fall on anyone uh it it can fall on anyone which means that but not everything not everything is a fair fleshly manifestation and and so and this is what the prophet said you know uh that that uh it can it and this is where you get into the anointed ones at the end time but so so we we find that shouting dancing uh uh um getting emotional speaking in tongues and what more it must not and we must not attribute all of that Amen to fleshly manifestations carnal uh manifestations someone getting in the flesh and and and dancing or shouting or Screaming or uh uh speaking in tongues or uh uh prophesying or or whatever all of that uh that cannot always and and and if uh uh and those of you that really believe the message and know that you then then you know that that the everything must not be attributed to the carnal side of things brother Brandon said said when a man is watched in the blood of the Lamb he don't need music or nothing else the power of God just works upon him and he can shout screen praise God or do anything else whether there's music or not see the Holy Ghost is in him and he's identified with Jesus Christ but today we just want to see we just want to we have to jump around a little bit as Pentecostals see because our forefathers did but notice what the difference he puts between the age today Pentecostal age and that back then they had something to jump around about this Holy Spirit making them jump ain't that right see so so see not everything is fleshly the Holy Spirit does that stuff too ain't that right so he says here what makes these people to you who doesn't have the Holy Spirit what comes upon them just sends their soul into shouting for a few moments it's a baptism something that sways down across them and fills their hearts with power and goodness and mercy and the Holy Spirit makes them just raise their hands and scream well why are they doing that the Holy Spirit does that so so you can't look at that and say oh that song that's that's wrong well you've got to be careful with that right so here brother Brown is saying see they cannot contain it any longer what is it it's the bomb everybody say it's the bomb it's the bomb to their soul not now uh I like that raising her the holy spirit makes them raise their hands and scream it's the bomb it's the bomb to their soul that lets them know that they pass from Death unto life can you say man so then we find that brother Branham at a at towards an end of one of his Services he asked the people to raise their hand if they wanted Lord if if they wanted more and you know uh how he done that and uh uh if they wanted to receive the real kingdom of God and so several raised their hand and then in his prayer he says I believe I believe they could not raise their hand lest there was something there to make them raise their hand see there's a spirit around them now he's praying this he said and these men and women 90 of them perhaps Lord that they realize that there's something wrong and they don't want it that way see they they don't want to stay that way in other words and now according to science they could not raise that hand see gravitation holds that hand down but they can defy science because they're human beings and they have a spirit that can command that hand to come up and it'll come up see and God you so endowed men with on free moral agency to make his own decisions and now there's a spirit standing by the sight of them that tells them that the very spirit that they've been worshiping around has been wrong and they want a decision see and the spirit that's around him the holy spirit makes them raised their hands so raising hands is important not saying you got to raise your hands but a lot of times when brother Branham asked and I I still believe it happens today but when brother Branham asked people to raise their hand if they want something and if they didn't raise their hand it could have been their last service last time their last opportunity but here he's saying that the Holy Spirit was there to make them raise their hand aren't you glad the Holy Spirit does them things the Holy Spirit commands us I had and and that's a personal relationship ain't that right so so then now now not only though does he the we we know that the supernatural can also fall on an unconverted person and cause them to do things as well a question was asked uh brother Branham if a woman who has short hair speaks in tongues in the church is it the spirit of the Holy Ghost that speaks through her or is it a false Spirit brother Branham responds by saying this this is a hard real hard question and I can only answer it the best that I know how now I cannot judge because I was not sent to judge but I think there's so many times he said I got another question down here somewhere that goes right along with that but if a person is speaking in tongues they are anointed of God but say Amen if a person speaks in tongues they are anointed of God they may be out of order that may be true and they may be doing something that's not right but I wouldn't want to say that it wasn't the holy spirit because I would know right now if a prophet would be careful with that then we must be careful with that right so he says there's many times that people misjudge one another and it is a bad thing too you say why she's got short hair she's wearing a dress that's too short that's not the Holy Ghost upon her don't do that don't do that that's not right you don't know what's in that woman's heart you don't know nothing about it you know that the Holy Spirit would make her conduct herself a little better now that may be true but I'll tell you as uh as you and I let God do the judging of that and lets you and I pray for that person that God will show them the light ain't that right you remember brother Brown and well he goes on in this that that he had that lady playing the piano with short hair I think it was short hair or something like that makeup or whatever and uh he got blasted for that but he said I knew her heart and he said I had her up there playing and and I got rebuked for it you know who that lady is that's Jim Ed Dalton's wife she's passed on now but they there came into the message and if you ever got to meet her it's got real long hair just a sweet little lady and I didn't know it was her until well just a year or so ago uh brother Jim Ed was given his testimony on the internet and he said that woman was my wife but brother Brown saw the spirit in it see and and so we we find in another place brother Brown said If a person is sitting in a congregation a spirit can fall upon that person and yet you know that they are wrong and they don't live the right kind of life be careful everybody say be careful what you say about that Spirit it might be the Holy Spirit he also said another place the spirit can speak through a hypocrite exactly I've seen it done and I can prove you by the scriptures that that's right I can prove to you by the scriptures that demon powers take up those spirits and use them sure they take up those gifts and use them I've stood and seen Devils speak in tongues and interpret it I've seen Hypocrites take the genuine Holy Spirit and speak with it someone asked me not long ago he said brother Branham if that Holy Spirit is so great he said I've seen people who stood in the meeting shouted praise God tears running down their cheeks and they would come out and do things like Sinners and go to sinful places and live in sin was that the Holy Spirit making those people shout I said yes he said oh do you mean the Holy Spirit would fall on a person like that I said yes Jesus said A sower went forth and sowed some seeds the enemy come in and sowed some tears and the husbandman said shall I go pull up the tears and said if you do you pull up the wheat let them both grow together ain't that right we also know that ke Ephesus the high priest there in the Bible uh uh he prophesied in the days of Jesus see and so brother Brown says the holy spirit of God was upon him to preach prophesy and foretell it to come to pass right this is the high priest the spirit of God Came Upon him to preach to prophesy and to foretell it and it comes to pass and denied and crucified the very vended gated word of the hour ain't that right so the Holy Spirit the spirit of God the supernatural can fall upon anyone uh uh there and and and and yet it doesn't mean that that person is saved ain't that right see so the the thing that we we must be careful is don't say anything uh about what what happens ain't that right uh uh if if if you're hearing someone shout if you're seeing someone you know uh speaking in tongues in the prophecy and all of that just just just leave it alone ain't that right uh uh of course you know uh the pastor you know will will I'm sure take care of them things if if need be but so we find uh also I I want to say this every church is sovereign so if you're seeing a church do something that you don't agree with and even if you see it in the message in the Bible that it's that that it that what is going on is not the same uh and and they're maybe doing contrary don't say nothing against it it could be the Holy Spirit that's just all I can say I I'm just telling you what brother Brown said every church is sovereign we're not a denomination ain't that right so if you if these things don't don't fight with them don't fight with other churches we we don't want to fight a man because listen and I'm going to just just continue with this thought for a moment but when you get to fighting with them you know what you'll do you'll lose your balance in the word of God especially ministers ain't that right you you lose your balance because it'll cause you to start to look at things a certain way it'll cause uh it'll cause you to study a a certain way ain't that right and then you can miss the true interpretation of what is really being said in them tapes and and in the Bible because you hear and read uh things from a biased point of view ain't that right so so if if someone fights you know against the legalists you know for for example and you're fighting against the legalists then then you know uh uh a person that is fighting against the legalists will will automatically lean and tend to shutting everything out that would think of legalism you you you read quotes that that maybe look at legalism or that that team tend to go legalists and if you're fighting them legalists then it'll make you not want to read them quotes it'll make you anyone that reads them quotes then you'll think oh they're legalists you know what I'm saying because you have a your your your your uh uh thoughts become bias so if if you know that so therefore if someone fights against emotions then they have the tendency to shut out any Scripture any quote a man that leans toward emotions because you're you're so caught up in fighting uh uh and and trying to prove a point that anything that goes against your point or seems to go against your point then then you shut down you understand what I'm saying so then you know uh uh uh if if you're fighting if if someone's fighting you know uh emotions and and things like that then someone starts dancing well then if you're not careful you'll call it fanatical you'll you'll call it something else you'll call it this and that and and and that's what you know uh it's because you become leaning into something else well then if someone is fighting those who believe in gifts and emotions and if they're not careful they'll get off the balance and they'll go so to the extreme if they shut everything down and God can't work hello if someone gets all emotional then they considered backslit or if you're fighting the formalism you people that don't do nothing don't believe in gifts don't believe in anything like that then and if you've got that in your mind then you'll go you'll go to the extremes the other way and and therefore then when someone ain't just as emotional as you oh they're formalism they just caught up and they're so bound well that that don't mean that they are but but because we if we get into a fighting mold concerned about everybody else around and what they're doing then we lose the balance of what brother Branham is saying from the scriptures so we want to keep our mind clear can you say man keep your mind clear amen and and um uh and just you know I I you know we we as Ministry we we want to keep our minds clear I don't care what they're doing about the Thunders just because they messed them Thunders up and they missed you know they must do the you know I've seen guys that'll that that that blast the Thunders and they fight the Thunder movement so much that if you get up and preach the Thunder oh well brother Brown's wanna preach the Thunders there's people that have taken the Eighth Day and messed it all up but you know we wouldn't even known there's the Eighth Day we didn't we wouldn't know it applied to us or brother Brandon hadn't taught it but if we get to arguing about it and trying to correct everything then we ain't got no quotes to preach anymore right you understand what I'm saying so you can preach the eighth day and be balanced with it you can preach the Thunders and breathe and bring a true interpretation to it you understand what I'm saying you you brother Brian I'm kept a balance and so if we stay with the message and just keep everything clear no matter what everybody else is doing with it just keep it clear you'll keep a balance ain't that Ryan fighting does more harm than good ain't that right so we want to hear the message we want to hear the message without having our mind cluttered with what other churches are doing with what other ministers are teaching or or these things now you know and and so uh of course you know being a pastor you know you you have to deal with things especially if there's a spirit of unbelief trying to come in you we're going to deal with it if if there's false Doctrine trying to come in we're going to deal with it you know but but that's that's that's that's as a pastor that's what we've got to do ain't that rhyme but not not to fight with people and and if we have that motive to fight then we lose the balance ain't that right and so we we find that that it always has to be the balance but I want to continue on with this thought on the Supernatural and and we can go back to the day of Pentecost as to what happened on the day of Pentecost it was a supernatural event how many believes that it was the supernatural thing uh uh and and it was more than speaking in tongues it was more than staggering all over the place it was more than stuttering or stammering it it was more than them things and and uh it was more than just uh uh uh the fleshly actions of that that were that you saw in in the fleshly uh demonstration amen but but all of that was a result of what happened they spoke in tongues they they stuttered they stammered they staggered amen but what caused that that's that's the key is what caused it ain't that right well it it you know what it was 120 people that day received the new birth and it was something Supernatural that happened ain't that right and what is that the life of God the life of God came into a mortal human beings and Immortal Life came into a mortal being and quickened them ain't that right Quicken them with his own life God quickened them and that was the start of the body of Christ that that the the Church of the Living God and and then we find that the book of Acts is a result is a result of what that birth that that of what happened that Supernatural day uh event that happened at that day uh brought forth the book of Acts ain't that right we find out that 30 years after that Paul was sitting in the church gifts can you say man you couldn't have set them gifts in there without Pentecost but it took a supernatural happening and then what happened then God would raise up a a Prophet by the name of Paul a man to set them gifts in order in the church ain't that right now we find that that the the book of Acts was not the books of the Apostles it was not the about the Acts of the Apostles it was the about the supernatural Holy Ghost working through them men and women amen Hebrews 1 14 Paul would say God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will ain't that right so God bore them witness if if if he continued to stay with him it wasn't just a one day happening amen that was the birth of the church but the Holy Spirit continued with them and bore record of them by signs and wonders Supernatural they didn't just have that new birth that Supernatural happening and then start leaning building hospitals and building this and having seminaries and all that no they stayed pure they stayed pure and so we find the Church of the Living God was established on the day of Pentecost by receiving the New Birth the people receiving and what birth was it it was a word birth it was a word birth for Peter identified what was happening in the scriptures everybody say it was a word birth that's right see Acts 2 15 these are not drunken now this is Peter now they're questioning what in the world is going on and they're attributing they're seeing the fleshly manifestations and they're attributing it to something natural and they're saying oh these men are drunk on wine or whatever see and and so Peter's under the Holy Ghost under inspiration said these men are not drunk and as you suppose saying it is but the third hour of the day but this is that can you say man it this is that a man which was spoken by the prophet Joel ain't that right so the new birth was a word birth it was a scripture birth ain't that right so here the prophet says he false false teachers will bring false births that's why it's always pays to be careful who you said under who you listen to because false teachers will bring false births true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ can you say man false prophets will bring false birth the birth of churches the birth of Creeds the birth of denominations and here you are Pentecostal brother fals sent or Sensations and tell a man he's got the Holy Ghost because he speaks with tongues I've seen Devils speak with tongues pencils lay down and write in unknown tongues that don't mean a thing it's got to be a Life by their fruit you shall know them brother Branham do you believe in speaking in tongues yes sir do you believe in shouting yes sir to be a Christian I believe that if you're a Christian you will believe these things ain't that right I believe God's word but if the life isn't there to back it up ain't that right so that's the key is is the New Birth the life uh uh the word birth it was a word bird so the church that God planted on the day of Pentecost is a word church it was a word seed a word church you believe that it was not started by denomination it was started by a prophecy foreign prophecy Joel's prophecy was laying there for how many years I don't know but then the holy spirit amen these these men and women got up in that room waiting on the promise for Jesus told them Terry ye into Jerusalem ain't that right and they got up there and they were waiting on the promise Prophet says you know gives us you know maybe a little insight upon it maybe one of them stood up and said well we've said here long enough I had a good cry maybe this is it maybe we can go out no no no props ain't come yet well I I feel a lot better than what I did not know you gotta wait probably saying come yet why they were waiting for the word they were waiting for that word to come to pass can you say Amen they were waiting on like a certain kind of a birth not a denominational birth amen not some other birth but a word birth can you say man and when it came Peter could identify it in the Bible and say this is that ain't that right so what happened on the day of Pentecost was not the the same as Judas being anointed to heal the sick and cast out devils and then turning around and denying the Vindicated word for he betrayed the word ain't that right yep he spoke in tongues I got her I guess I don't know but I know he healed the sick cast out devils he done them works but when it comes to Pentecost he showed his colors and he betrayed the word of the hour ain't that right Jesus said that Judas was the son of perdition so now what happened on the day of Pentecost wasn't like campus being anointed to prophesy and foretell things and it come to pass even and then turning around and crucifying the Very anointed word ain't that right he was one of the priests that had no representation in heaven yet anointed but what happened on the dead Pentecost wasn't that way for this was the word birth hello that's right the day of Pentecost was not another false prophet like Balaam rising up these 120 was birthed by the word of God ain't that right yes sir they had root and where was the route this Bible the experience that they received was from this Bible ain't that right so we find how do we know that that they had that word bird the promise of scripture was fulfilled and so it was the word birth now what was God doing the prophet said let us not forget that in the beginning he smote the side of Adam and he took something from his side now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so when his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it take it from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation ain't that right he said my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if it took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word ain't that right so on the dead Pentecost the prophet said he started to build another masterpiece he started that was the beginning of it so therefore it had to be a word birth amen The Original Seed he started to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word so it had to be based upon word started in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifest the promise that had been given Joel said it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions what he would do in the last days this two last two thousand years ain't that right so notice it started out as the original as Jesus said the word of God is a seed that A sower sowed he was the sower the seed was the word so it was a perfect word seed that God planted on that day of Pentecost no denominational handling no Creeds mixed in with it no man's idea mixed in with it can you say Amen the emotion the gift the whatever happened on that day came solely from the word of God amen now the prophet said notice that Pentecost their bodies were quickened everybody say quickened by the new life they received that makes me feel religious here was men fishermen Tax Collectors The Humble Little Women see just ordinary Housewives little virgin girls see they were believers they were believing that this was the truth they believed that and when Jesus died they believed on him Rose and Rose up again from the dead they believed that to be the absolute testimony of God that he had quickened him to life now they go up to the day of Pentecost to receive their abstract do you know what that abstract is it's when a deed has been cleared they went up there to receive their abstract and they become quickened oh Church the supernatural God quickened that mortal body ain't that right now what denomination can do that what Creed what Dogma what what ideology of man can Quicken a people it took a supernatural it made them alive and you know what it made them alive to the word it made them alive to the word that's right and Peter could verify it that experience with the word this is that which the prophet spoke ain't that right so then we know that the Pentecostal seed had to die and rot it fell at nicaea ain't that right and notice God but but even before and I see it God would give a warning to the first church age to that first church and he's already giving them a warning in Revelations 2 and 4 he says to them remember everybody say remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works first Works ain't that right brother Bradham reads that and he says God tells them to remember remember say evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something and he told them to turn back in their minds to their porn of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality ain't that right back to when they could say for me to live is Christ back to Purity when ananias and Sapphira were dealt with back to the gate called Beautiful ain't that right so already in the first church they began to drift away from that experience and God is tell them to go back remember in your mind and when you get it in your mind then it'll become reality to you but we find out that the church just kept on going it died that that seed died and rotted but then we find that that seed began to grow and brother Brown talks about the three stages of the seed as we know and and the natural it shows us the true picture of it ain't that right three stages of the natural seed he said a seed like planted he brings forth a stock little blade shoots from it then the tossel then the pollen hangs on that then the shuck and then the seed again then the seat again can you say amen that's right see so so then we find what he tells us that the church has already gone through them three stages Luther Wesley Pentecost ages can't ain't that right amen so where are we at today Baptist seed again the same seed that was planted in on the day of Pentecost we're right back to that seat again yes sir and if you believe the message you'll believe that brother Brown says it all the way through it look he says the uh the wheat cannot change how many believes that we cannot change well what was the wheat began with it was a seed right it didn't start out as a corn seed then become wheat it was a wheat it was seed form but then when it comes seed again it's in its maturity ain't that right it's not in the planning stage it's in its Harvest stage so that we cannot change so notice what he says for today it's got to be a Ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word and like the first church was on the word Spirit field word fed not denominational fed it's word fed that's what it means to be back to seat again we've gone through all them denominations but it's nothing but corruption we've gone through all the men's theology but it's nothing but corruption we are back to word again and what would it take it would take a prophet to bring the word again that's why you can't look at it and say well that's brother branham's opinion and that's brother Brown's opinion well if it ain't fitting in the Bible then it ain't just it that's it then brother Branham is wrong I beg to differ with you we've had this Bible for many years and we didn't understand it but the more we get into this message we begin to understand what this really means and you cannot see just call it brother Brandon's idea can you say man we're back to seed again and we can never come back to seed without a prophet restoring the word ain't that right so then then where are we at we everybody say we have received a word birth as well we have received a birth word birth the difference between the word birth today and the word birth on the day of Pentecost is this different scriptures everybody say different scriptures are being fulfilled more scriptures are being fulfilled in this hour than it was back then ain't that right for we are in the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 they weren't we are in the Fulfillment of Luke 17 30. they weren't we are in the in the Fulfillment of Revelations 10 they weren't we are in the Fulfillment of John 14 they weren't we are in the Fulfillment of of first Thessalonians 4 16 and that they weren't we are in the Fulfillment of Revelations 5 Revelations 8 Genesis 5 22. Hebrews 11 5 and on and on and on and on and on and on we could go about the word that is being fulfilled in us that did not become fulfilled in them but nevertheless they did receive a word birth for they said this is that brother Adam said the lutherans under justification the feet raised it like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms The Works deeds and so forth had to be Armenian had to be legalists but now we come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone cried The Headstone crying what Grace Grace passed from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men part of God's word seated together manifests the entire body of Christ because there's no living among you ain't that right no one beliefs no Creeds nothing none of that you've been purged from that you've come out of her no living among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus ain't that right so I want you to notice now the word birth and I hope this is all right but the word birth is not a repeat of Pentecost hello brother Bram says this because I I want you to understand he says now let us see what happened when God in his time and age and His prophets are not considered just depending on theology priests denominationalism like we do today now closely it all gets messed up when you don't consider God you don't consider His prophets you don't consider his word and you lean on to priests documents seminaries educate all them things it all gets messed up if the true spirit of God there it'll direct it into the word not just one place in the word but the entire word for the entire age now the day of Pentecost the spirit directed it right into that to Joe 238 right so that's why Peter can look and say this experience is Joel 2 38. ain't that right but all the other scriptures lay dormant because I wasn't for them right so he said the day of Luther it directed it into that Wesley in this last Pentecostal move but this everybody say this is another age this is the calling out of the Bride not 2 000 years ago at Pentecost or the repeat or the return then you say Amen now brother Brown said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride now I got to tell you this now the word that they had on Pentecost did not make them Rapture Ready they had a word birth Joel 2 38 this is that but it did not bring all the word into fullness true ain't that right so he says see we got something different aren't you glad why we needed more faith than ever we needed rapturing faith we needed Faith to change these bodies that's why they couldn't they were only a seed but yet that seed had to die and wrought or you wouldn't be here and you say man so he says the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bright age no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he tried to tell him you're dead to that you cannot have that now now brother Brandon does you know he talks about how the word them that word and Noah that word in Moses that word would not work in Jesus today but Jesus did not isolate himself from them scriptures he actually fulfilled them and you say man they spoke of him but he didn't go around telling everybody build an ark he was the ark ain't that right he didn't go tell everybody get out of Egypt we're going to a promised land no he was trying to get them out of another age [Music] the dispensation of law into Grace and you say man so he told them if if you really knew Moses you would know me for his spoken me but he didn't do what Moses done in the sins of or and Noah build the ark or call everybody say let's get out of Egypt that he was doing the ministry of it everybody had to get in Christ to live ever I everybody had to come out of dispensation of law to come into Grace can you say Amen and so here we find why won't now listen he says the word that fell at Pentecost won't work today why because the enemy that you're fighting is greater and you say man can you believe that the enemy that you're fighting is greater than they fought in the first church so if you go listen to putting on the whole armor of God Brother Brad I'm remember the the Bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood the enemy did not come in like a flood on the day of Pentecost the enemy did not come in like a flood in any age but this age remember the two thousand thousand hundred thousand thousand demons have been held at Bay until this time then you go listen to the Feast of the trumpets and the prophet says now they've been Unleashed all the ecclesiastical Powers have been Unleashed ain't that right so we're fighting a greater demon our greater enemy has the enemy has come in like a flood but then the Bible says he would raise up the standard the spirit of the Lord would raise up a standard and you know what brother Rams says how he'd make that standard by making the word become more real and real and real can you say Amen so we could not fight the enemy that we have today just off one scripture all right I hope that's okay to you but it's the word is becoming more real in other words you are becoming more real of what this word said he cannot stop you he can never defy this or stop the word he'll never kill it out the word is in the bride Joel 2 38 was in that little bride on the day of Pentecost but look at the word today that's in the bride that's good it's it's there read the story of Esther it's you read the story of Ruth and Boaz it's you read the story of LEDs are getting a bride it's you she said yes that's you she said I'll go that's you she didn't only get the gifts she got the bridegroom she got Isaac that's you Hallelujah so yes we've had a word birth there ain't you realize there ain't no other birth now so does this word birth does it do away with the new birth no it is the new birth does that mean because the word that did not that fell on Pentecost doesn't apply today does that do away with the emotions nope doesn't do away with the nine spiritual gifts nope who put the gifts in the church who took him out of the church who put them back in the church God did Brother Brown do away with the Pentecostal experience nope but the word that they had was what prophet the prophet Joel promised and that church was a virgin with the word not inspired by man this was God himself the supernatural but notice again what they received Joel 2 38 become fulfilled it did not bring rapturing Faith to them it did not bring them into the adoption of sons Acts 2 38 was based off that experience on the day of Pentecost but it was not adoption of sons it's true because even after after Paul says we're looking for him we're waiting all the the Earth is moaning and groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God ain't that right see what they received that word birth that they received acts Joel 2 38 it did not bring it was not the third pool Ministry that they received ain't that right it was not the Capstone that came to them headstone can you say man what they what happened on the day of Pentecost was not the mighty angel coming down with an open book ain't that right the word was not open fully to them ain't that right nope we still needed Malachi 4. it did not bring Malachi 4. what happened on the day of Pentecost did not settle all scriptures there was still them scriptures still waiting to bring the seed back to Restoration you and I ain't ain't that right notice Daniel 12 4 but thou Daniel shut up the words and seal the book until the day of Pentecost sell the book even to the time of the end and many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased when does this scripture fulfilled today ain't that right they weren't running to enfro knowledge wasn't increasing it's right now we are in the days of Noah right now where knowledge has come to its highest peak right now and people are running to and fro trying to find the answers of the truth amen why the world's come to its end all right we're at the end of the Nations we're at the end of time we're at the end of humanity as we know it today and people are trying to find the answers to keep it continuing but we're at the end and all their education all their knowledge ain't helping them it is not providing the knowledge brother Brown said Daniel had prophesied these things it sought in a vision and the angel come down to seal the vision and to seal the prophecy they can read it but cannot understand it till the end time but aren't you glad we're able to understand we're able to understand not by a seminary knowledge but by word birth can you say man by profit in the age has come see the prophet said the end time message shall reveal it the last Church age so here the the Pentecostal uh the day of Pentecost was now not even the beginning of the first church h it was the beginning of the Church of the Living God ain't that right the church age started several years after and here the prophet said and the message end time message will reveal well that book will be open and the Mysteries that was hit up in this that no man they could talk about it they could not understand it but the message in this end time in the last age would reveal it now we've got an open book [Music] see the Revelation had to wait until our day and then you find even John after Pentecost after the day of Pentecost was told to seal up the book while he was seeing things amen he heard the he heard the seven Thunders utter he saw the symbols right and yet he was told in other words don't explain it John keep quiet about it write about the symbols tell what you saw but that's it keep it closed right till the end time till the end time but on the day of Pentecost they did receive the word birth for their experience was right in line with scriptures can you say man it was scripture fulfilled yes sir that was the alpha the beginning of the church God planted a Pentecostal seed that day and the potential was there don't get me wrong the potential there was there for a Rapture but it couldn't happen everything that the seed becomes the Potentials in the seed all the apples that will come forth was in the seed can you say man that's exactly right you can't add two or take away it's all right there in the seed ain't that right so so you read the book of Acts you see what potential they had yeah yeah all that potential was laying there we see it but the seed had yet to die and rot ain't that right so they could not bring forth manifestation of sons until the seed rotted so remember I hope this is all right remember in the vision brother Branham saw the Omega Church as being the exactly the same as the alpha Church and most of us know what the vision was so I'm not going to read the whole thing my brother Branham saw the first church pass by in view and she went over the hill or around something but she disappeared and then he said the worldly Church come past before him and was so vulgar and he says when she passed by like that I looked at her and I just got real faint and I just turned around and I thought oh God I'm condemned there's no need of me trying any now just just might as well just quit then after that he said the same bride everybody say the same bride that went in the first come back around again they got you and here come them little ladies again each of them was dressed in their National Garb from where they come from Switzerland like Switzerland Germany and so forth each one wearing that kind of Garb all long hair just exactly like the one at the first and then another place he says when she walked by she's she's exactly like the one was in the first place walking to the step of the music of God's word marching on see that first church did that new birth was exactly right with scriptures everything they'd done was exactly right with scriptures can you say Amen they've done marked at Mark 16 exactly right with scriptures and here we are here we are again passed by he saw us he saw your church and you was marching right in step with the word like they did that's right word for their day word for our day ain't that right notice the difference they walk in the word for their day we walk in the word for our day but the difference is we go up he saw this bride not turn the corner like the first one she started going up marching up until she disappeared you're living in the age of rapture why because it's time for it it's Harvest Time it's harvest time he can pluck you now you can kidnap you right brother Brandon said see and I think I've read this but he said it's the weed age friend it's the wheat there's a Ministry on Earth there's a Ministry on Earth that's just like the one that went into the ground back Yonder at the beginning a real Pentecost experience now what is the Pentecostal experience you know what program said it is it's the word being made flesh in you and you say man his word made flesh he said Are you ashamed of of saying of Are you ashamed of Divine Healing Are you ashamed of the Full Gospel Are you ashamed of your Pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of his word for that's his word made flesh in you can you say Amen now his word has to live out in for every generation like it did in the first stage there was a promise there for them but we're at the end of the age and everything of this Bible has been laying for you and it has to live now you can't you you can't this can't live without a Pentecostal experience that is the Pentecostal experience it's the word in you can you say man so brother Brown said Pentecost is the only thing that's going to prove Christianity not legalism not the way you dress not the way you live and act going to church and all of that oh that's part of it the thing is that proves it it's Pentecost it takes a Pentecost experience to prove God and that's to each individual it does not prove the organization it proves the individual can you say Amen so I'm I'm going to read that I'm going to let you go got got a lot more but I I don't want to keep you but brother Brown you know it was in the message invisible Union of the Bride that brother Branham made that statement the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day but notice that doesn't mean that we act different from the way they acted it doesn't mean that the experience of Pentecost has changed it doesn't mean the last commission that Jesus gave to the church has changed brother Branham says this the church began at Pentecost with the Pentecostal blessing and was ordained by Jesus Christ to continue on until the last day with the same message and the same blessing working in US can you say man so we believe in a Pentecostal experience we believe in the pillar of fire we believe in the Dynamics we believe in the quickening of the uh uh of of of our body ain't that right so then he goes on to tell us that the last commission is the message that is to continue and and and that message is the last commission he says now in in the message things that are to be 65 brother random quotes the last commission and then he says remember he said that now you know what the commission is right you owe you into all the world and preach the gospel and and and these signs shall follow them that believe right he that believer shall be saved those that believe not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name you shall cast out devils and all that so he's quoted this and he says now remember he said that that has to be everybody say that has to be he wouldn't have said that Lester's going to be somebody could catch that word the house is going to catch that word he said it so when we say the word that felon Pentecost will not work for today that's not disqualifying mark 16. that's not disqualifying the the last Commission and can you say Amen see so and yet that is the same word the first church caught for a look at the book of Acts they did it and it's the same word that you will catch because it's the supernatural God working proving himself in the church and you say man if the musicians will come brother Bram talked of the minister who told the people that the Pentecostal religion was nothing but a sham not to listen to it it was unstable said any man that spoke in tongues and these things and claimed to be healed the sick and so forth by prayer that it was to leave away from it and to pray for those poor decrepit people because they were in an illusion that there was something wrong with them he said oh hi I'd like to have talked to that brother just a while and he said that was only given for the apostles at the day of Pentecost and that was all brother Bram goes on to say but I find that 30 years after the day of Pentecost Paul was ordaining these gifts in the church First Corinthians 15 he said in the church the gifts of speaking in tongues Miracles and all these other gifts was said in the church Jesus said that go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world to who Every Creature they've never received it yet see and these signs shall follow them that believe how long all the world to who Every Creature these signs shall follow them in all the world and in every creature these signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues if they'd taken up a deadly thing or serpent or drinking a deadly thing it will not harm them they'll lay hands on the sick they shall recover that was his last commission to the church mark 16. right I will say that experience that they received Joel 2 38 brought this scripture to life and so will it in this age the experience that you receive of the words word coming to life will bring this to life right now he says see so this which is already received already or he says see Paul is ordaining these gifts into the church 30 years later late and said in Galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received already been preached let him be accursed I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it's to be to every creature all times at all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessings should be upon the people can you see me so when brother Brown says the word that failed on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day you've got to be careful in how we interpret it [Music] because in that same message brother Brown tells us that every Son of God will act like they did on the day of Pentecost same message brother Brian says every son will act like they did on the day of Pentecost another thing he says what kind of children she is bearing talking about the church that tells what their papa is whether it's the first Adam or the second Adam if the church brings forth the child of the second Adam Christ he acts the second Adam way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost that's the really true second Adams children foreign [Music] another place he said the alpha has become Omega amen the first come last and the last is the first the seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden and died there come back and from that imperfect seed that died there come back to the perfect sea the second Adam and the first seed that fell and was used in the second uh coming as bringing forth the child now has become the true bride again the seed right back with the original word oh do you love him isn't the Lord wonderful oh just to know who we are we are that Original Seed Hallelujah there's no mixing up with it when you really believe that word and the word becomes a life to you becomes life it'll make you act strange like it did them it'll Quicken your mortal body like it did then it'll bring it all right in line with scriptures like it did for them can you say man Church we're going home and I'm so glad for it and there's something that already bearing witness in my spirit that I'm going I'm one of them Hallelujah and I trust that it's the way with you today amen what song [Music] of the Lord there's nothing like the prisons
