[music] Amen. Um, this is something I sing a lot, but his strength is perfect. And I'm just going to say that's what I found to be true in all these years. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who gives me [singing] strength. But sometimes [music] I wonder what he can do through me. [singing] No great [music] success to show. No glory [singing] of my own. Yet in my weakness, he [singing] is there to let me [music] know. His [singing] strength is perfect. When our strength [music] is gone, he'll carry [singing] us when we can't carry on. Raised in his [singing] power, the weak [music] become strong. His strength is perfect.

Aren't you glad you serve [music] a great God? &gt;&gt; Amen. And um he's undefeated. Amen. And we're so glad that we're in his hands. &gt;&gt; And there's just no way we can lose. Amen. We love him and it's good to be here in the house of the Lord. The musicians can be dismissed. Amen. And uh trust you're glad to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful day today and um so we're going to take advantage of it. Amen. I hear it's supposed to be pretty cold tomorrow. So, um, anyways, but if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to, um, the book of Mark, the 16th chapter. And, um, so, as it's been said, um, we Heather's birthday today. She's turned 40. And um I don't know if she wanted me to announce that or not, but I uh thought I saw a cowboy up on her this morning, so I had to kind of dust it off of her. But uh anyway, we certainly appreciate uh my wife. And she has just been a true blessing to me and the family. Amen. And u uh you know, she had no clue what ministry was all about. And um it was just really her and her uh Mindy and her mom uh for many years. And so we got married and her world just turned upside down. I say for the better, but uh I don't know. But uh we were uh coming home on our honeymoon and talking about getting, you know, school uh books and stuff for the children and uh at five and wanting getting ready to be a teenager or was a teenager and then we come up here and and moved and and uh so but she's endured and been a real support and &gt;&gt; um so we really thank the Lord for that. She said, "I've never been to so many hospitals in my life. Never participated in funerals and so much in my life." Amen. But that's just part of ministry. And she's done a good job. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we want to remember Brother Wayne um will be here with us December 19th through the 21st. And um so just keep that in mind. And [clears throat] um we had a wonderful uh uh time last week at the fall festival and uh trust you all had a a a good time. Just a wonderful day uh time of fellowship and just thanks uh thank everyone who participated and all that you've done and thanks to sister Kim for getting it together. Amen. And organizing it all. And so we appreciate that. And uh we want to continue praying for Sister Janice and and um uh the family [snorts] and the Lord will just continue to comfort them and guide them and help them in this time. And um I know it's a a peace to to them knowing that uh brother Bob's made it with the Lord and he was ready to go. Uh but it doesn't uh help the fact that um he's gone and um uh I know he will be missed and and uh so we want to just keep them in our prayer. There's one thing about it is uh it ain't going to be too much longer and um [clears throat] we'll be uh leaving this place. Amen. And u so um I had heard about three days ago um the pope uh invited uh uh members of the joint committee of the council of European bishops conference and the conference of the European churches [clears throat] and they said it was a gathering of Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants and they came together at the Vatican for the signing of a new ecumenical ical charter which was preh presented to the pope and um one archbishop uh reflected on the significance of the presenting of the updated charter to the pope and calling their time together a blessing. It's not a theological note, he said, but it is a joint statement of how we as Christians, both Catholic and the rest of the Christians in Europe, see our joint witness of Christianity. &gt;&gt; And um there's a couple others uh that had given a statement and and um so we we see this this they're they're uniting religion and um it's all working behind the scenes. Uh but we know that um that's just uh another day closer for us getting going home. And so we must keep our eyes upon the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh before we go into the word, let's just bow our heads and we'll just talk to the Lord here. Father, Lord, it is a a blessing to be able to have our eyes opened and to know what is going on in this day and not have to fear, but we rejoice because we know our redemption drawth nigh. &gt;&gt; Father, there's so many people that don't know. They're just going blindly in life and not not understanding what's ahead in the future. They feel something taking place. They know that the world is falling apart and they're trying to fix it. But Father, we're looking to another kingdom that's that's come and and Lord, your reign will be here upon the earth. And father, we're so glad to be a part of it. And I pray, Father, that you would just move today. And uh what words we would have, let it be of you. And let them be anointed, Father, from on high. And Lord, that it would uh uh place us, Lord, and position us. and Father that we could see the responsibility that we have and and Lord what you've called us to do in this age. I pray Father that you'd give us understanding and Lord just anoint both speaker and hearer in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. So we we look uh Mark 16 and and we know it uh 15th we'll start there Jesus here speaking and he saith unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that is bapt or believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. Amen. You can have your seats this morning. And um if I were to to take a title um it would be commissioned to preach the gospel with signs following the believer. And um of course Jesus is uh speaking to the church, not just to uh the the disciples, but uh all the way I believe it applies to this day. this scripture. If there's any a scripture that is applicable to us, it's it's that scripture for this day. But he's telling us the that that we have a position and this position is a position of authority. It's um uh and and so uh the things that once ruled us, we are in the position to rule it. um we're no longer a servant to it, but it's a servant to us. &gt;&gt; And it's because that uh it was defeated. Satan was defeated at Calvary uh through the works of Christ. &gt;&gt; And so uh we we find that sin uh in empowered uh Satan at the beginning. Unbelief. Sin is unbelief and man's disobedience uh empowered Satan uh there in the beginning. But then uh when Christ destroyed sin, it destroyed or he destroyed the works of sin, &gt;&gt; the results of sin. Ain't that right? So, so as um uh revelations would say, we have been loosed uh by the blood of Jesus Christ. It's um by God's own blood. It's it's it's a loosening. And uh the Bible says that he that the son has set free is free indeed. uh a a it's not just uh part free and part bound, but you're free indeed. It's a perfect blood that brought forth a perfect loosening. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the prophet said the loosening is perfect and complete. Amen. And so then that tells us that Satan has no legal right over us. It has no legal right. So, so our position is not overcoming nations. And we we don't have a national power. That's that's not our power. And and we don't we don't even have a religious power. That's not our power. Uh but but our power comes from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so um so Satan has no legal right over us. And the word legal, I just looked up legal right. It's a claim recognized by law for the purpose of securing it. Amen. The interest in a claim which is recognized by and protected by sanctions of law imposed by a state which a enables one to possess property. So we have a legal right. Satan has no legal right. But we do have a legal right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Satan has no claim to us. We are no longer Satan's property. Amen. But we do have legal rights. So he was defeated, but we were uh uh put in a position, amen, to claim what is rightfully ours. &gt;&gt; And so therefore, Satan cannot take possession since he is not the rightful owner of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But not only are we loose, but the Bible says that he has been he has made us kings and priests unto our God. Ain't that right? So, we're kings and priests. Uh not only loosed, but kings and priests. Uh uh we have been made. And and so now, Brother Brandon uh uh preached the word uh preached on this word Messiah. and he talked about it a lot. But if you go and listen to the message, the Messiah. Uh but brother Brand says Messiah means the anointed one or it could be used the anointed king. So I I I I think of that because we are anointed ones as the prophet would say and we are anointed kings. &gt;&gt; Not just king. We we're not just having the title king uh but we are anointed kings. &gt;&gt; We are empowered. Amen. By God. &gt;&gt; Now a king is one that holds a p a preeminent position. Amen. A king and that word preeminent means supreme. &gt;&gt; So a king holds a supreme position. And a king also has a domain. Now u this word domain is a territory over which dominion is exercised. So we we look at God. God is the great king. He's the Messiah. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He's the anointed one. He's the He's uh uh uh he's king of kings. &gt;&gt; We're kings. We've been made kings, but he's king of kings. He's our king. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and and the prophet said the church is his domain. &gt;&gt; God exercises his authority, his dominion uh uh over his church. &gt;&gt; So then, Revelations 15:3 calls him king of saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad he's your king? &gt;&gt; King of saints. So he as king rules over his domain, the church working his own will. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and uh uh if if you're a believer, if you're born again, you're part of this church, then then then you're you're part of his domain. True. &gt;&gt; Then he's going to exercise his rights. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's going to exercise his authority. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and he's going to work his own will in the church. For the church, the prophet said, is God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. And a kingdom is a rim or region in which something is dominant. An area or sphere in which one holds a preeminent preeminent position. Amen. Amen. See? Amen. So it's not a kingdom unless there's a king to rule over it. But when a king is positioned on in in h authority, then he's got a place to rule and he's ruling in his kingdom. Well, his church is his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we feel the effects of his of his reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not that that when we get to heaven, then we'll come under him. We're already under him. We are already affected by his supreme rule. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But now the church has a domain because they are anointed kings. Amen. Now the prophet said, "Our dominion is a dominion over sin." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Our dominion is a dominion over sin. Paul wrote in in uh uh Romans 6:17 saying, "God be think that you were the servants of sin. You were you you you were enslaved to sin. You done what the devil wanted you to do &gt;&gt; because of your desires and and all of these things, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered unto you." So I say we're no longer sinners. &gt;&gt; We're not sinners. We're kings. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. With authority, with the rule, with the reign. Uh see, you you cannot have dominion over sin and still be a sinner. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh there there's just no such thing. See, so so sickness and diseases and death and bondage are the result of sin. Therefore, we have dominion over it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; We have dominion over sickness. &gt;&gt; We have dominion over over death. &gt;&gt; We have dominion over diseases. We have dominion over bondages and our habits and and all of these things. Can you say amen? And I I say this, you'll never find God's people defeated unless they're living in a backsliding condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the only time you saw Israel defeated is when they lived in a backsliden condition. &gt;&gt; It was only when Achen took something, amen, that belonged to the enemy and put it in his house, hid it in his tent, amen, that Israel lost the battle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Every time Israel become backslid, they were weak before the enemy. Amen. Every time that they were in idolatry and and disobeying God, Amen. the enemy could prevail over them. Amen. Uh to where they become victims. But God never intended the church to become victims. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, Acts 1:8, it says, "But you shall receive power." I say power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Amen. You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost. Uh you shall receive authority. Amen. uh Luke 24:49, "Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you, but ter ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high." This isn't a national power. This isn't political power. This isn't church power. This power descends from on high. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it it came on the day of Pentecost. Ain't that right? This power came on the day of Pentecost. Amen. And that when the church was established is when that quickening power quickened the mortal body. Amen. Of of the 120. God came down. Amen. And anointed each person that was in that upper room with the Holy Ghost. The prophet said he's sent back his holy spirit to anoint his church and set in this church gifts to represent him to the peoples. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So the church is an ambassador. The church is the ambassador for Christ. Any of us that's part of the church, you cannot be a part of the church without having the same spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost come inside of you. Amen. And anoint you. Amen. And send you out as an ambassador. &gt;&gt; We're all ambassadors for Christ. Ain't that right? You daddies, you mamas, you your Sunday school teachers, your children. Amen. Preachers and and and whatever else. We're all [screaming] ambassadors if we're part of the church of Jesus Christ. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, this is something we've heard. You never you don't hear it much. Uh I I well it was the prophet that brought it to us and and and but Genesis 1:26 it it it shows that God made man to be a God &gt;&gt; to begin with. &gt;&gt; He was made to be a God. God just didn't uh make man and then said, you know, I I I'm I'm uh going to make you a God or you can be a God. God purposefully &gt;&gt; made him to be a God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? For we we find and and and and uh uh we find that God said, "Let us make man in our own image and the likeness in our likeness." Ain't that right? Well, that image, the prophet said, was a holy image. It was the holy image of God. And and we must not let this pass us. I I know we hear it, you know, a lot. We know it. We're acquainted with it. But but church, if there's ever a time that we need to grasp this and and take it to heart, it's now &gt;&gt; in the age that we're living. &gt;&gt; But but man had hands. The prophet says man had hands like God. He had feet like God, eyes and ears and intelligence like God. His whole fiber was like God because he was uh uh a son of gods. &gt;&gt; See, and so we find that man was given dominion over the fish and uh of of and and over the cattle. He was given dominion over every bird. He was given dominion uh uh over the waves and the winds and all that. Brother Billy Ram said he had complete supreme control of the earth. He was a god of the earth. God's the god of the universe everywhere. But his son had this earth under his control. &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name. He could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted to. Adam could say, "Let this mountain be moved here uh uh here be moved over there." And it would do it. Adam could say, "Let this tree here be plucked up and planted over here." It would do it. For he had complete supreme control. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God made him to have complete supreme control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam did not stand there and act like everything was out of control. &gt;&gt; Everything was under his control. &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so so we had complete supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a son of God. &gt;&gt; Now, so when he sinned, that holy image of God left him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Adam, the prophet said, lost his inheritance, the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now it passed from his hand to the one he sowed out to, Satan. He sowed his faith in God to Satan's reasoning. Therefore, his eternal life, his right to the tree of life, his right to the earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan. He passed it from his hand to Satan. And therefore, amen, he says it returned and has been repu uh uh polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had. Uh, and that's the earth. See, so Adam fell from his position &gt;&gt; as a son of God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He He didn't lose the fact that he was son of God. He just fell from his position &gt;&gt; as a son of God. See, sons of God has a position. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God never just intended us to have the name sons and daughters of God. There's a position that comes with this. Adam as a son of God never changed that fact. But he fell from his position. &gt;&gt; So as a son of God, he could never conduct himself as a son of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; He could never rule as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so Adam fell from his position. And and the prophet says Adam and Eve forfeited their rights of the word. They forfeited their rights of the word, the promises, their inheritance. So in other words, no longer did their words have meaning. &gt;&gt; Their words became godless. Their words became harmful. Their words, amen, became uh uh just just by words. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But Adam knowing that he had a rule by his words, &gt;&gt; you didn't find him just speaking words just out of out of character. &gt;&gt; Because he knew that his words had meaning. &gt;&gt; He knew his words had power. A &gt;&gt; ain't that right? He believed in his words because he had a position of authority. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. [clears throat] Now, brother Bram says, "Now, if the blood has cleansed it back, what about now?" &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Look what that son of God, the second Adam did. See, the second Adam, he had the authority, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He could speak and it happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. He could call the man that'd been dead four days, started already corruption. Amen. And called it back to life. Amen. And and and and when he said, "Lazarus, come forth." There was enough power in them words to bring restoration. Whatever them skin worms ate, Amen. Lazarus came back restored &gt;&gt; because there was power [screaming] in them words. &gt;&gt; There was a son of God upon the earth in flesh, the second Adam. Not just a son, the only begotten son, but a son that had position. A son [screaming] that could speak to the winds. A son that could speak to the waves. A son, a man, that could speak. And eyes would come open. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus lived a life of power and authority. There was no demon that could stop him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think as brother Brown said, he never did attend a funeral. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. never did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz cuz one time the Bible says he stopped a funeral possession that was going by and he just raised that dead up. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't no need for a funeral. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No demon could kill him. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, he died." Yeah. But he says, "I give my life." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No one took it from him. No demon took it from him. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. They tried to take it, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't take it. &gt;&gt; So he says, "I give my life." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. No demon could defeat him in his work. &gt;&gt; He's a second man, Adam. Now, Brother Brandon says, "See what he was to us is back life." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See? See? So God purposefully would record Jesus's life by the gospels. them gospels were protecting this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Writing it down. Amen. For us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Well, why? Brother Ram said he gave us what he was so that we would not be deceived in what he is today. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, oh, the devil would like us to be formal and say, "Oh, I got the Holy Ghost. I got the Holy Ghost. I got God living in me and no power, no nothing. Just worldly, lukewarm, halfbackslid, the devil just stomping all over us and we just looking like everything's impossible. We just don't know what to do and and and we're just victims and all that. Oh, no, no, no. Amen. So, brother Brown says God would have this recorded, his backlife in the Bible so that we would not be deceived to where we could know what he is today. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I like that. Don't take anybody's word for it. Take God's word for it." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." And the devil would have us to believe that that scriptur is only to brother Brandham. Brother Brandham said that does he said that's to every believer. The works that I do shall you do also. That's to every believer. &gt;&gt; Jesus also said a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. The Bible also says it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. So what he was back then, he's still God today. Brother Graham said he's the same in every detail that he was back then, he is today except the corporal body. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need the corporal body on this earth because you're his body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brown says, "Well, how do we know?" People say, People say, "Well, how do we know?" They say, "Well, well, I believe that." Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. Those signs are not upon you." Said, "Well, they may be. Probably they will." Well, they ought to. He said, "They shall. &gt;&gt; They shall follow them." Everybody say, "They shall. &gt;&gt; They shall follow them that believe." Well, how many is a believer? &gt;&gt; Then they shall follow you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Not not wishing for it to happen. They shall happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get out of that wish mode. Get out of that, well, I wonder if it will happen. They shall follow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, see, and what did he leave? He left his back life to show us what he was. &gt;&gt; That's what's behind us so we can tell what's going to be in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, all that's behind us, his back life of 2,000 years ago. Amen. And that's fine. Amen. But let's not just build a try to get warned by a painted fire. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's only there to show what it's going to be in us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the redeemed church as we know started on the day of Pentecost in seed form. &gt;&gt; And God has been building his church through these seven ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh um and the and the prophet said building a bride for the same thing he made Adam. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is he that made us, not ourselves. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Now, now you know I I just pray God gets it to us this morning and hope I can make some sense to you. &gt;&gt; But you see, why are you here? &gt;&gt; Why are you in the message? &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why are you in this age? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Just to set on a pew &gt;&gt; just because it was your good wish to do that. You want to raise your children in some good church. So let's we're here. No. God brought you here. He made you for the same thing that he made Adam for, and that's the dominion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sure, you're going to have problems. Sure, you're going to have things that come against you and challenges. But you were made to meet the challenge. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You were made to rule. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, man was made in the image of God. That's how we know he was made to rule. Come on now. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says we're returning back to that image &gt;&gt; to our first created image. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Who is? I am. You are. &gt;&gt; The church of the living God is &gt;&gt; good. &gt;&gt; And I'm It's not just the minister that's returning back to this image. It's everyone that's been filled with the Holy Ghost and is part of the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we we know or I I believe it. You can't be part of this bride and and not be part of the message. &gt;&gt; Can't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That ain't happening. Not in this age. &gt;&gt; And any other age, those that were part of the bride were part of the message for their age. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're part of the bride, this is where you're at right now. This is where we're at. Amen. Amen. Is we're returning back to the first image. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, &gt;&gt; now the prophet talks and he says, "Now, when a man gets saved, there's a light that comes in him. &gt;&gt; It's like the size of a shirt button." &gt;&gt; So, that's that's a small just a little little button. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, you know, and he says that's God coming into the inner inner man. &gt;&gt; And then he talks about how we're made up in the system of a tabernacle. Remember there was three uh uh phases of the tabernacle. the outer court, the inner court, and the holiest of holy or &gt;&gt; and so the outer court is this whole flesh. &gt;&gt; And there's five senses or we could say five entrances to this body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not just one entrance that affects us. It's we've got five senses [snorts] &gt;&gt; and and they're gates &gt;&gt; uh that affects the body. Then then so that's the outer court. in the holy place which is the spirit of man and there's five senses or five entrances into that &gt;&gt; imagination right &gt;&gt; uh memory conscience &gt;&gt; and the others &gt;&gt; affection &gt;&gt; affection and what reasoning &gt;&gt; reasoning so that that's the second part and then the then there was the holiest of holy &gt;&gt; rightise &gt;&gt; which is the inner part of man or the soul of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that's where the shakina glory is. And there's only one entrance to that. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Amen." Uh uh and and he says, "Now the holiest of holy is where the shikina glory dwells and in there is where God can enter into man and take over in the control tower." &gt;&gt; Amen. Right &gt;&gt; now you know these things. So uh &gt;&gt; good &gt;&gt; but just to remind us &gt;&gt; so we we know now and and we're blessed to know that the Holy Ghost can move up on our flesh &gt;&gt; and give us good thoughts, good feelings, &gt;&gt; move upon our spirit. &gt;&gt; And we can even it can cause us to write good songs, &gt;&gt; prophesy, &gt;&gt; right? It could cause us to be anointed to preach, to sing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Play music, have spiritual experience. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But that's not where the control tower is. &gt;&gt; That's not where the shakana glory dwells. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; See, so so many people in church are anointed. Oh, they dance and they shout and they and they call that they they say, "Oh, he's a Christian." No, no, no. We found out through the message that's not Christianity. They can prophesy and be actually be right. &gt;&gt; They they can, you know, they they can have these things. But see, the holiest of holy is where the shana glory dwells. That's where God enters into man and takes over in the control tower. That's so that's you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This is your flesh. Then you got your spirit. Then you got you. which is the soul uh there and the only way in there the prophet said is through self-will. &gt;&gt; See whether you will to or not that's up to you. That's but that's the only avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart is by self-will. Puts him right back like Adam and Eve on free moral agency again. You can choose right or wrong. Either one you want to. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So when man gets converted or born again. It's gone past this flesh. It's gone past that spirit and God has been able to get into that soul. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And that little white light the size of a button comes into his heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So that light is God. Now notice and I want you to really this brother Brand's saying it. He says now as he can let that spirit grow &gt;&gt; and take out all the roots of bitterness &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; and press God's way through him again. He can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Are we waiting on something? No. It's just us letting God take over. &gt;&gt; It's just us surrendering to God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. See, people think we need a new prophet. No, we don't need another prophet. We just got to surrender. &gt;&gt; It's us to let [screaming] God have his way. &gt;&gt; Let that spirit grow. Take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again. He can come back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden. Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe what you have said will come to pass." That's not speaking of millennium. That's speaking right now &gt;&gt; in this age to your mountain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak to this mountain, be moved. Don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you have said will come to pass. You can have. Everybody say you can have. I can have. You can have what you said. That puts him right back supreme again. &gt;&gt; Puts him right back in the condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's not making you a king. He's already made you kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; So he says, "Now we're made up of light meters. Inside of us is cosmic light. That cosmic light is a light that they can take an X-ray with. The X-ray doesn't come from the X-ray light. It comes from your own light. Then if that cosmic light say could be pushed to a place to where not cosmic light but eternal light, God could dwell supremely to do our thinking, do our walking, do our talking. Then it's no longer the man. It's God [screaming] in the man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, eternal life is the light of God that dwells in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So then the prophet says as as we yield to the spirit, everybody say yield. &gt;&gt; See, now it's up to us. Amen. We've it's it's whatever we want, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. As we yield to the spirit, the more we become unmanlike, unsinner, and will become more godlike. &gt;&gt; That's the answers to quit your habits. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I believe that's the answer to everything &gt;&gt; is that we surrender. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I just wish my wife or my husband, my kids would straighten up." The more you surrender, &gt;&gt; the more I will yield. We've got to yield to the spirit, the more unmanlike, the more unsininner like &gt;&gt; we become and become more godlike. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, it's in every born again believer to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. God wouldn't tell us, give us promises. God would not commission us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If we can't do it, &gt;&gt; but we can do it. &gt;&gt; You got the Holy Ghost. Then your job is to surrender. &gt;&gt; Yield. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; More and more and more. &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's good. Now, notice our position. We'll look at his position, Christ. In Ephesians 1:20, Paul tells us that God raised Christ from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principalities. Notice, not just above, but far above. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing how he just puts words in there? Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not like, you know, the devil's here and you're just like right there &gt;&gt; touching him. It's far above. &gt;&gt; That's right. far above all principalities, powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, cancer, tuberculosis, arthritis, Parkinson, anything. any name, every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things, everybody say, all things, &gt;&gt; under his feet, &gt;&gt; and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that fleth all in all. &gt;&gt; So, just to all things are under his feet. the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, but but we're not over here looking at him like, "Oh, wow. What a dominion he has. What supreme. Oh, if I could just get there." No. Paul just told us we're with him. &gt;&gt; It's under his feet. Everybody say under his feet. &gt;&gt; Under his feet. Well, then then he says we are his body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He's the head head. &gt;&gt; Body, &gt;&gt; Christ &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he didn't put the head everything under the head. Right? &gt;&gt; He put everything under his body. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; So I guess we all know that the feet is part of the body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Feet is part of the body. So I don't care if you are the bottom of the feet. &gt;&gt; It's still under you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You might be the skin under the big toe, &gt;&gt; but it's still under you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; See, and and and and so then Paul tells us that God raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So, we're there, &gt;&gt; in in other words, we've got a position of authority, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown then says, "We have all powers." Everybody say, "All powers." We we have all powers. The church, every member that's part of the church, part of the body, we have all powers in heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; Now, [screaming] we have it. &gt;&gt; Not in the millennium. We won't need it then. &gt;&gt; We ain't going to be dealing with that devil in the millennium. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be dealing with sin in the millennium. We're not going to be dealing with spirit of fear and spirit of sickness and and death and all that in the millennium. He says we got it now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now. &gt;&gt; Position of authority. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So all everybody say all &gt;&gt; things &gt;&gt; are possible &gt;&gt; are possible &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now notice notice how the gospel is needed to work is needed to work the power in us. The gospel is needed to work the power in us. Paul said the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. Salvation is not just when we come and ask for repentance. Salvation has to do with deliverance, healing, right? right? Uh sal uh getting saved. It it has to do with it all. Salvation is the whole complete works. It's the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. What is the gospel? &gt;&gt; Romans 10:13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without a preacher? See, &gt;&gt; and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things." This is why we don't put emphasis on singing, on music. They have their place. We don't put emphasis on shouting and dancing and and the tongues and dreams and visions. It all has its place. But it's the gospel. The gospel is the thing &gt;&gt; that that has power. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now uh uh uh the gospel looking at that teaching or declaring the word is part of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that Jesus taught daily in the temple. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Uh the Bible also tells us that Jesus went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. We find that after the Holy Ghost fell on the 120 in the upper room that that when they come out and and and acting like drunk men that that there's bystanders all around and they were wondering what what this was and Peter stood up and declared the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; after he declared the word of the Lord, they said, "What must we do to be saved?" And 3,000 souls were added to the church that day. &gt;&gt; Yes, they do. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Come on. &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul, he said, "I have not shunn to declare unto you the all the counsel of God." Brother Brand said the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; According to First Corinthians, and I'm just bear with me getting somewhere. But according to 1 Corinthians 3:10, Paul as a wise master builder &gt;&gt; laid the foundation. What? How? by teaching the word of God. &gt;&gt; Word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then men were built upon what Paul taught. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Let every man take heed on how he builds there upon." &gt;&gt; I've laid that foundation. Now, every man's got to take heed on how he builds. It's got to line up with that foundation, &gt;&gt; right? Paul even said, "If I or an angel from heaven or any other man, any man uh uh uh preach any other gospel than what I have preached, let him be accursed." &gt;&gt; So that teaching was needed. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy 1:13, Paul would write, "Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me." &gt;&gt; All right? in faith and love in which is in Christ Jesus. Second Timothy 2:2, "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many wish witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Even brother Bram says, "I've taught what Paul taught. &gt;&gt; I've said the same thing he said." Right? Amen. See? And so then if you notice what Paul taught was the revelation that was given to him. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Now he had the word. He had the word. He knew what the old prophets had said. He knew what Moses's law had said. And and he was very knowledgeable in these things. And at one time he taught what knowledge he had of the word. Can you say amen? As did the Pharisees and the other religious leaders of that day, the teachers of that day. But when he received the revelation of the word, then he taught that revelation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is not other not just anything is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Come on. &gt;&gt; He taught what he had received from God as revelation. &gt;&gt; So the revelation was the foundation that Paul had laid. &gt;&gt; He didn't lay some other thought of man down for the church to be built upon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, the revelation then that came to Paul became the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Revelation became the gospel. &gt;&gt; Paul called it my gospel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Romans 16:25, he says, "Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel &gt;&gt; and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept since uh kept secret since the world began." Right. &gt;&gt; In another place, he called this gospel sound doctrine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His gospel was what he called the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just just letting that soak in now cuz we've been commissioned to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Come on now, man. &gt;&gt; Now, Paul said, "We preach Christ and him crucified." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say it this way. His gospel was the voice of the blood. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just telling the story &gt;&gt; of of of Jesus dying on the cross, but he was preaching the finished works. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, his gospel was based upon the finished works of Calvary. Paul said in one place it was the gospel of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And he said this glorious gospel was committed to my trust. &gt;&gt; So, but then we find that Paul's gospel wasn't just word word. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But his gospel is the word plus power. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. The gospel is the word plus [screaming] power. &gt;&gt; If it's the true gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, what what good would it be to preach and you all to sit here and we do this day in day out faithfully Sundays and Wednesdays and and on special meetings and and then what good would it do if the gospel doesn't help? &gt;&gt; Come on. If the gospel isn't intended to affect us, what good is it to play the tapes? &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, if you look, God is the word. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; God is the word. Trying to get somewhere. And God is the spirit. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He lives in his word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. True. And he is revealed in his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So when the word of God is spoken, it is spirit and life. &gt;&gt; That's right. different if than if I would just get a book of of of an author, whether it's a commentary, whether it's a western, whether it's a a drama, or whether whatever uh or it could be a biography of something and and th this Bible is different. I I I I could get that and and read it to you, but there's no life there. But when this is preached, &gt;&gt; there's life &gt;&gt; cuz God lives in his word. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; See, and so now notice the word of God can only come from the mouth of God. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; It's just like your word. &gt;&gt; You speak a word, I can't call it my word. &gt;&gt; You You say something, I say, "Well, that's my word." Well, it didn't come from me. That's your word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, if it if it's God's word, then it has to come from God's mouth. &gt;&gt; God speaks it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, then no man can say it's the word of God unless God spoke it himself. God is made known by his word being manifested. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So to speak a word uh uh without any manifestation of God behind it shows that it's not the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because his word has the power and authority of God [screaming] behind it. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so now uh uh the Holy Spirit is the power of God's word. Prophet says the Holy Spirit is the power of God's word. And if the Holy Spirit is in the word of God, it will make the word of God display itself. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. &gt;&gt; It'll make the word of God display itself. &gt;&gt; So, this is why we come to church to hear the word of God. This is why we play the tape. We're attentive into what is being said because we know the power and authority of God is in them words. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then if you need help, if if whatever you you have need of, if you can take that word and believe it, &gt;&gt; it becomes life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? I could, like I said, I could read a book from some author and you could say, "Oh, yeah, yeah, that's nice. That's good. I agree with that." Ain't going to help you &gt;&gt; because that ain't spirit and life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God's word is spirit and life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's why we don't want to read creeds and we don't want to read the dogmas and we don't want to direct you in in in in a way of man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just preach the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet said, "Ministries that are consecrated to God become channels where God can speak through, preach the gospel, heal the sick, show signs and wonders." &gt;&gt; Another place, it's the Holy Ghost taking the word of God and making it manifest. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; See, so we're kings and priests. We're we're kings with an authority, but our authority does not come by our words. &gt;&gt; It comes by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So the word of God is the conductor of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Wherever the word is preached, the spirit follows it." &gt;&gt; I hope to build your faith in the word of God today. He said, "You see your pastor preach it. The first thing you know, Brother Brad makes a blowing sound across the building goes the Holy Ghost, right?" &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if the Holy Ghost doesn't confirm it, then you got your wires crossed. &gt;&gt; You got a ground somewhere." See, if you can get that word hooked up to the dynamo, that great thing that puts out the fullness of the current, he will just set that little wire of fire for you and it'll do things for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; See, we're not helpless today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're facing. Don't look at it like you're just helpless and you're a victim and you just don't know and oh &gt;&gt; you've got the power of the word. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we we we want to see the word demonstrated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many wants to see that? &gt;&gt; We want to see the word. See See, we don't have to put up with sickness. &gt;&gt; We don't have to put up with bondage, &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to put up with these things. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I just don't think we have to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now listen, church. If we were just Baptist or we were just Pentecost or if we were just taking a form, then then we have every right to sit in a church and not know God's power. &gt;&gt; But when the word is being preached, you understand &gt;&gt; the gospel. preach the gospel. Now Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out demons. They they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." Now, casting out demons is a needful thing today, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; I just You know what makes a man not want to surrender himself to the Lord? &gt;&gt; It's demons. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A demon does that. You talk to people, well, I want to get closer. I I want to, but something just won't let me. Well, I'll just tell you what it is. It's a demon. &gt;&gt; It's It's just as much as restricting people that can't hear good. It's a demon that is is causing that that hearing loss. Well, same same is it someone that can't can't that wants to move on and and wants to but they can't. I've had many people tell me I I want to come to church but I can't. Something just won't let me. Well, it's a demon. &gt;&gt; Now, notice what brother Bram said in his prayer. There are perhaps sinners sitting here that is so bound with sin that it'd be hard for them, impossible almost for them to reach out to a place to accept Christ as long as Satan has them so bound in his power. &gt;&gt; But knowing that it is written in my name, they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He says, "Give us power today, Lord, through the preaching of the word to cast every devil of doubt, super uh superstition, and fear from the people's hearts and minds, and those that are bound by frustrations and doubt might be brought into the arms of Christ." &gt;&gt; Oh my, you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, so, so we find the preaching of the gospel castes out devils. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now &gt;&gt; to the believer, right? &gt;&gt; I believe that's that's what's going to set some of you got your children that are lost. It's what's going to set your children free. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That gospel. &gt;&gt; That's what we believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in the gospel, go to psychology. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in the gospel, go to some other thing. But we believe in the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That gospel has the power to set free. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So it has to be that way. It has to be. So now 1 Corinthians 15 and1 Paul says, "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you have received and wherein you stand, by which also you are saved." Yes. &gt;&gt; If you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. &gt;&gt; So I can say by which you are also healed. &gt;&gt; You are also delivered. &gt;&gt; By which you are also set free. &gt;&gt; So this is why it's important to speak the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and here Proverbs 18:21, death, everybody say death &gt;&gt; and life &gt;&gt; are in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Now we know that God's words is not death. For the Bible says, man shall live by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; So the word of God is life. Jesus said, "My words that I speak to you are spirit and they are life." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; In in 1 Corinthians 2 and4, Paul said, "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and the power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "The preaching of the gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the church, the righteousness of Jesus Christ." Another place he said through the preaching of the gospel comes down the blood veil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Another place he says the Holy Spirit transmits God's [screaming] power and glory through the preaching of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So again, don't just don't don't come here. Don't sit here like you're hopeless. &gt;&gt; Take the gospel and believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So we find that in Genesis 1:3, it shows us what the gospel is to be. And God said, everybody saying, God said, &gt;&gt; God declared, &gt;&gt; God spoke his word. Right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Same word that you have. The same word that I'm preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God said, &gt;&gt; "That's right. &gt;&gt; Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And nothing happened. &gt;&gt; And God just looks around says, "Man, I tried. I just don't know." &gt;&gt; No. That's not what the gospel is. &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so the word of God was spoken and it was manifested. And every time God speaks his word, it's manifested. Let there be trees, it was manifested. Let there be flowers, it was manifested. Let us make man in our own image, it was manifested. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But God gave his word to us. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Old Testament, the Bible says the word of the Lord came to the prophets. It was God speaking through them. Uh Hebrews 1:1, God who had sundried times and in diverse manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets. &gt;&gt; They were called gods because the word of God came to them. &gt;&gt; They were called gods because they spoke the word of God. It was God using their lips to speak his word. &gt;&gt; And whatever they declared was manifested, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They declared the coming Messiah, did they not? &gt;&gt; And it was manifested. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm going to hurry up here. But today, the word is being taught, explained, broke down in so many ways to where people are getting an intellectual knowledge of the word. &gt;&gt; We have many schools of theology that have explained the word. They've sent their ministers out and as theologians and philosophers and commentators and all of these things and you know men have come out of the woodwork holding conferences and Bible studies and seminars and powerpoints to help the people get a better grasp of what they are teaching. and and there's nothing wrong. But see, we've had this stuff and there's no power in it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There there's there there's no authority, no anointing in what they're saying, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; No supernatural manifestation simply because the word is lost. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Teaching for doctrine, the traditions of man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the Bible speaks of fallen angels who fell from their estate. They kept not their first estate, their their position. And and we know that these angels fell because they listened to Lucifer's lie. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Lucifer at the beginning, his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ had. Is that right? by seemingly a more cultured, more beautiful, more splendor than the kingdom of Christ. Then the prophet said he's doing it again today. &gt;&gt; Building up a hybrid church, a hybrid by hybrid members, hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual men instead of bornagain men building an intellectual kingdom that'll outshine Christ's little bitty flock. Why is it that did that? What is it that did that? Fallen angels. Everybody say fallen angels. &gt;&gt; The Bible said it was fallen angels who who listened to Lucifer instead of Christ who they once belonged to. Another place Lucifer has gotten to the church and taken away the word and injected denomination. And he is building a church. the ecumenical move that's going on now to unite all the Protestants together all together come into Catholic and this pope that they got in now to do the same thing exactly what the scripture said it would do and that's and what's he doing it by he's doing it by man of those great ecumenical moves who does not know God and the many of them in the Pentecostals because they're doing the same see what is it he's doing it with fallen angels fallen Lutheran fallen west Methodist following fallen Pentecostals. See, and lost their original state estate from the word of God and going right back in to make a great big ecumenical move. &gt;&gt; Fallen messengers. Messengers who once stayed with the word but sold out their birthrights and joined in with the world. Same thing. It's at the last day. Lucifer is achieving today by man with those spirits in them that he did with angels at the beginning. Fallen angels who kept not their first estate to obey God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another place you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from men of God who has went forth uh to establish truths in the earth. Before that truth could go on and proclamate and get on to the real revelation of Christ, fallen angels come in, took it over and made denominations out of it. Notice that's the reason the revelation of the seventh seal mystery had to be unfolded. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now you see it what they left off. If Luther would have went on, it had been right here. If Wesley would have went on, if Pentecost would have went on, what would they have done? See, now there's only one thing that can happen. There has to be a message at the end time when there's nothing else can follow it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why? To bring back the word of God again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is why God sent to us the prophet of Malachi 4 to restore the original word to us and to restore us back. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power. &gt;&gt; So we need the word &gt;&gt; right? Preach the word. &gt;&gt; Teach the word. &gt;&gt; They say oh we don't want to get into the you don't get deep in the message now. Amen. All these things you may go wacko. No. Preach the word. &gt;&gt; Teach the word. If the prophet said it, it's needed for this. &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't don't don't shun from serpent seed. &gt;&gt; Don't don't shun from God of this evil age. Don't shun away from the the seventh seal and and and Christ is the mystery and the future home of the earthly bride and the heavenly bride. Don't shun from them things. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't understand it." Ask God to give it to you. Give you that revelation &gt;&gt; because with the restoration of the word comes restoration of power. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham said, "We've lived down through the time of the preaching and teaching and so forth, and we've got into a place now to where the church is so broke up till God is just bringing in again the supernatural to serve a people." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now listen, he's coming to restore. God's going to restore that word. God's going to restore the power and all these things. Now, Brother Brown said the restoration, this restoration is something that neither Luther Wesley or Pentecost had. &gt;&gt; They only had a reformation. &gt;&gt; I looked up this word to reform. It means to change something for the better, improve it, or correct its faults. &gt;&gt; Now, they done many good things back in those days. Luther, you know, uh, uh, produced the Bible for everyone to read and and in that in that time, &gt;&gt; but the prophet said, but they failed to restore back the full gospel teaching with signs following. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He says they did not restore the Holy Ghost revival. They did turn from idols and they turned from idols. That is true. They took down the idols out of the church. Mary and Joseph and Peter and Paul and all them. They turned from the idols, but they did not turn to the risen Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luther turned them from the idols, but into more like a politic or denomination or organization to make themselves just another organization, an image like the first one, and try to outgrow it by the denomination. Ain't that right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, all Lutheran wants all the Baptist and Methodists to be Lutheran. The Pentecost wants all Baptist Lutheran and everything else to be Pentecostal. You just keep adding to your denomination." But that's not God's program in the first place. God's program is for restoration. So, for uh God's program for restoration was to bring back that which was from the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And we now know by the message of the hour, it's not just bringing us back to a Pentecost on the days of Acts. It's bringing us back to what man was in the garden &gt;&gt; before the fall &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right. &gt;&gt; Lookie, he says, "Resurrect that." If this book falls to the floor, now to take another book and take it and take it in its place isn't restoration. Resurrection. &gt;&gt; So, you have to bring the same one up. &gt;&gt; So, if the church died through the dark age and become completely pagan back there, then the restoration now that's a reformation to reform. But to be reformed and born again is two different things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the message did not come to reform us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he said, see, uh uh they brought back reformation, getting away from a lot of their idols and so forth, but they never brought the Holy Ghost back in the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. They never brought the Holy Ghost back because the one that really brings the true gospel light, he said, "Now put on your cap now. The one that brings the true gospel light is the angel of the church here." &gt;&gt; In this lessa, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so that's what the message is. Amen. Is bringing a restoration of the gospel with word and power. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Word and power. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] If the musicians will come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Paul foretold of what God would do in this time of restoration. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Acts 3 and 20. And he shall, everybody say he shall &gt;&gt; send Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; which was behested unto you, whom the heaven must receive until &gt;&gt; until &gt;&gt; the times of restitution of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or until the times of restoration of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. When is he going to send Jesus Christ? At the time of the restoration of all things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Restitution is the act of restoring a restoration of something to its rightful owner. And he sends Jesus Christ at the times of restoration. &gt;&gt; So then we look at them scriptures again. For the Lord himself shall descend with a shout, a voice, and a trump. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And the dead in Christ shall rise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I saw another mighty angel come down with the open book in his hand. Oh my. What is it? It's a time of restoration. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Luke 21:27. And they shall see the Son of Man coming in with a cloud with power, with power and great glory. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Brother Aram said, "In the last days it shall come to pass, behold, I send to you Elijah the prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers." And in there there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church. Have the preeminence in this church. Oh my. What? The anointed man. Now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Anointed by wife, accepting what Eve turned down in Adam. Coming back with the anointing of the word because he said, "My word is spirit." Anointed with the word. What Eve turned down, he comes back and we accept. [music] How many's accepted? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. what he turned down, he comes back and we accept. &gt;&gt; Now think of that. She turned down the word and the word has come back to us [music] and we accept it. &gt;&gt; And because she turned down the word, [music] she lost her position with the word. No more in dominion, no more in authority, [music] running from the winds, hiding from the rain, all of these things. She become the victim. Man become a victim of Satan. But now the word has been restored [music] and we accept it. Now if she turned down that word and looked the results that happened, what does it do to us who accept that same word? It puts us [music] back in a position of authority. &gt;&gt; You love him. Prophet said, "Now God has promised her as he did Eve." [music] He told Eve there had come a time, there had come a time that the word would come back to her again. Now you remember that what she lost from, what she fell from, it would be restored because there's only one thing that can restore [music] and that's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says God is trying to get somebody through the sanctifying power of Christ to yield to that word that he and the word can become one again. [music] Then he can use his word through that person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope it's really sunk home to you today. &gt;&gt; God wanting to take his word [music] and speak through you. So what do we do as message believers? Do we look at our problems and just oh boohoo and cry and [music] woe is me or do we recognize our position? Do we recognize what this message is to [music] us? I'm not believing this message in vain. God by this message has [music] returned the word to me. Can you say amen? Amen. He's returned it. I believe it. These signs shall follow them that believe. [music] These signs shall follow them. We've got the power in the name [singing] of the [music] Lord. Gener. [singing] Hallelujah. [music] We will not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Oh, sing it again. Yes, [music and singing] we've got the power [music] in the name of Jesus. [music] We've got [singing] the power. taking a walk. You know, [music] Brother Kenny had testified there at the meeting [music] uh service last week. There he was. Uh I can't remember what issue he was having [music] in his body, but he said he, you know, he he had remembered either brother Brandham or what the scripture [music] had said about the word of God being powerful. And he thought, you know what? I'm going to start coming to church expecting. I can't remember [music] what problem he had now, but he said, "I'm I'm going to come to church expecting if if the [music] word is being preached, then I'm going to claim it." He said, "Every day, he starts just claiming [music] it. God, you said it. I went and heard your word. I'm healed." He [music] said, "What was it 10 months later?" He said, "All of a sudden, the pain was gone." said he hadn't had a problem with it since. [music] Why? He started realizing the word that's coming forth has power. &gt;&gt; It has power. There's nothing wrong with the message, right? &gt;&gt; And if we can believe it and just [music] hold on to it, it it doesn't matter how long. It doesn't matter when and and where and and all of these things. I I thought of of brother Brandham and and u he was saying and I uh if I could find it just right fast that [music] he was in a prayer line and uh [music] and I may not be able to find it and uh where it was but he was [music] talking to an a a a lady that was having problems and u yeah I can't I must have not done it but uh I'll [music] read it next time but talking to a lady and he says you know he says you've got to you've got to rise out of your condition [music] you you you got to start you know don't don't look at your problem don't look at the whatever he said now just just rise up out of it somehow you got to rise up out of it and then just start claiming [music] start thanking ing God. And he told her, he said, "Raise your hands and just start thanking God for your healing. Just start thanking God." [music] He said, "That's the way to do it. Just thank God." He said, "Now just go your way and and and don't think about your problem. Don't think about the sickness anymore [music] and just start thanking God. Just say, God, I thank you. I thank you for your healing. I thank you for saving me. I thank you. I thank you. I thank you. I thank you. I thank you." Why? Because there's power in the word that was preached. &gt;&gt; There's power there. Can [music] you say amen? Amen. If it was just a a congressman giving a speech or a president giving a speech, amen, that that's different. But when the word of God is coming forth, if we can just believe it and then start acting upon that word, I thank you, Father. Thank you for saving my children. [music] I I thank you. Let it be verbally done. Verbally say it. Amen. Every day. God, I thank you for saving my children. I I thank you for turning the situation around. I thank you, Lord, for touching my body. I thank you, Father, for supplying every need. [music] What are we doing? We're taking God at his word. That's right. &gt;&gt; This word is powerful. &gt;&gt; Can we stand [music] to our feet today? We've got the power [music] in [singing] the name of the Lord. All for many years [music] now. Satan's [music] tried to stop us. [singing] [music] But the bride of Jesus is still alive. And like a mighty [singing] army, [music] we keep marching upward, [music] winning every [singing] battle for the Lord's [singing] on our side. Yes. Yes. Yes. We've got the power [singing] [music] in the name of Jesus.
