battle amen no matter what you're going through amen it can't be you know uh that's just what how did Paul say that the suffering won't come be compared with the glory that shall be revealed amen and so the musicians can be dismissed we appreciate all of our musicians and appreciate sister Rihanna for being willing to fill in and praise the Lord and she's a woman of many Talent praise the Lord and I trust everyone had a good Christmas uh then you um enjoyed time with your friends your family amen and was able to take some time moment just to ponder on the Lord a man of water Christmas really is about a man and but if you'd like to turn with me the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter praise the Lord Psalms 23 and we'll start at the first verse but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake amen let's just bow our heads the word of prayer father as we come to this portion of the service we realize how sacred it is Lord to to talk about your word Lord and father only you can open it to us and father we'd pray that you'd make our understanding clear that you would just forgive us of all of our sins our failures Lord and father that we would just be able to focus and not not under a a spirit of condemnation but of a spirit of faith and Liberty and Lord may you just have your way among us this evening father write your word upon every heart and hear and may our hearts be open to receive Lord of you and we're asking Lord our greatest desire is that you would just draw Us near to you Lord father and may you be more revealed through us than ever before Lord we just committed into your hands we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening and I'm there's so much in in what we've been talking about in in the first three verses and and uh you really just can't cover it all into what what it really means to have the Lord as our Shepherd and and what his leadership means to us uh his his leadership is really it's it's just beyond words and to be able to be led by him it's it's a paradox because you you have to understand that we're we were going One Direction and everything about us even being tied to our family history or lineage or all of this it it all pointed to One Direction it it it spoke of of a direction we would go I it's just like I've I thought of and wasn't even planning on saying this but I I was thinking of brother Branham of how that he talks about his mother was all bootle you know she come from family of drunks Bootleggers you know we all died with their boots on he says knives and fights and and all of these things and he's you know and he and he says you know you you plant the Cocker Burr or or a wheat whatever you you plant it and it comes up I mean and and whatever you planted that's what it is and he was talking about his lineage of how that this is just the way it's always been he said but then something he said where I stand today and now I'm paraphrasing he said it's a paradox because I'm not that you know that's a paradox and he says and all of us can say the same thing and we can we were tied to a natural lineage and and of that natural tree had really to be honest it spoke for us it it it it it it already showed where we're headed and it's just like the the boy that was adjourned you know his parents were Christians he was a professed Christian but he wanted to get married but he had that he his mom was a German his dad was something else I can't remember and and he was just uh uh he was just an honorary uh kid and and so his parents had went to Brother branham's and but he's he saved he's this he's that you know and and and but brother Branham went to her life and said but yeah but you you're you're German and your family you know he's I know a sister your sister and he said she won't even wave she won't even she says but you're different and he says what made that he said the Holy Ghost made then it broke the chain and he says and that boy you better not marry that girl right because he'll make hell for her he said until he gets the Holy Ghost because the the family lineage the the the bloodline or whatever are Earthly it it it already had a direction for us to go our nature but here we we find that David is saying but the Lord leads me he he's the one that leads me and and as we've talked about it but this last part he leads me in the paths of righteousness and and I have to tell you it that's a paradox and that's a paradox because and and uh uh and this is what I want to deal with and what we're dealing with in this portion of uh scripture is is Works everybody say works works and uh because Works comes with being a Christian and and and the Christian Life uh involves works and as we see we will see that Jesus believed uh that a Christian was to have works uh Luke 6 43 for a good tree bringeth forth bringeth not forth corrupt tree uh corrupt fruit a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit and and you know it's already been established in in the Book of Psalms and other other places that man is considered as is likened as a tree and and so Jesus again here is liking man as a tree that that a good man can't bring forth corrupt fruit and and a a a corrupt man can't bring forth good fruit ain't that right and then he then he says for every tree every man every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes so you don't go to a pecan tree to get oranges I uh we're we're all may not have to be we don't have to be Farmers to know that right so the tree is known by its fruits and a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and and where where does that begin out of the good Treasure of his heart and and remember remember before we got your day before David says he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness he he makes it clear to us that his soul was restored so so out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart out of the for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speakeas and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not and do not the things which I say how whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and conjunction do with them heareth and do us I will show you to whom he is like he is like that man a man that builds uh builds a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood Rose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and it could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock ain't that right then then he goes on to say that the man that heareth my words and doeth them not he Likens them to the same to a man that done the same thing built his house but he built this house on a sand not the rock Revelation right he built it upon the sand and then when the storms and the same storms the same winds same trials persecutions whatever had come his way his house fell and Jesus made sure that he emphasizes and great was the fall of it ain't that right great so this tells us that we're all going through battles and we all have our trials we all have our uh ups and downs and all that but the key is he that heareth and doeth he that heareth and do us can you say amen he will stand amen so but Jesus he was into doing he was into Works in in that way uh John 14 19 he that hath my Commandments see uh and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him ain't that right so in thinking of this we've been speaking of of the paths every individual has a path to walk and and uh he's walking down a path and and that path has a certain direction uh uh to it and and and it's leading you into a certain destination a man the path and and and and and sometimes people you know they wonder you know why why you you know everything was going good and all of a sudden everything just my life has turned upside down and you see people burnt out you see people just not serving the lord anymore and and I I have to say it's a path that led them there it did not happen overnight amen uh it was something something took place and so the Bible speaks of two main paths and every human being walks one of these paths uh uh there and and of course as we said that Jesus Jesus said that one path is the Broadway a man which leads to destruction amen now you you think of that and and now I I I I just happened to and and and you know I believe in Redemption so don't don't think I'm not uh in talking in that way but uh too many people start walking out serving the lord and end up uh in a in a trashy somewhere something wrong with that I can't say I don't I I just I just can't see that amen I understand we we fail and I understand we're discouraged and and I understand these things uh uh but but uh uh the Christian Life is a eternal life it's something that is eternal its fruits are Eternal ain't that right I believe even that experience is eternal we talked about even even David saying he's talking about that man he shall be as a tree planted by the rivers of water and and whatsoever he does shall prosper his leaves shall not wither ain't that right he'll bring forth his fruit and due season and all these things and so I'm not talking about seasons in your life I'm not talking about times that you have your lows your ups and highs and all of that uh but but I I do say you'll keep the faith you you'll maintain the course you you'll keep striving can you say amen amen that's right and I've seen I've seen Elders that I just love dearly that I've seen him go through the fire and I think oh my how this is going to take him out and but they're still serving the lord years later amen and yeah and and I have to say it's a path that they were walking on Amen because Jesus said here the Broadway this this this Broadway leads to destruction ain't that right and the other path is a narrow way so One path is a Broadway uh and it leads to destruction the other path is this narrow way and and remember the little lady that tried brother Brown talked about trying to walk that path on high with high heels you know she's trying to walk it you know it was pretty narrow remember she couldn't last it on that on that way amen she fell off see because it's a narrow way but that narrow way leads to life ain't that right so the the paths of righteousness is a is a narrow way and few there be that find it now this Broadway is a path that fits all religions uh all behaviors all Lifestyles it fits any kind of conduct if it's any kind of character uh you don't you you don't have to be shaped you don't have to be molded you don't have to need the Mason uh uh to shape you as uh as the prophet talked about you know the confessions we got our confessions needing a stone Mason to cut them confessions you know uh uh and and to shape our lives right and and uh but but the Broadway you don't have to have that you just go happy go lucky but as you're happy go lucky you have to remember there's a destination that has taken you to now now the wicked prospers in this in this age and and in in this world and and even the Bible talks about it of how can the wicked Prosper amen but but the time is coming a man that that there's destruction at the end of the road ain't that rhyme a man's so so this broad way uh uh if it's all kinds of things it'll fit transgenders on there it'll fit it it'll it'll fit make Believers it'll fit uh uh professors it'll prevent you know it it'll fit people that uh uh homosexuals it'll be you know it'll fit Deacon's married two or three times pastors married you know two five times and uh it'll fit all of these things it just does it it'll fit any kind of false prophet you want it it It just fits it it fits all of that down this broad way ain't that right it's pretty wide you know and and so it has plenty of room for everybody on there but but then we find this narrow way you realize this narrow way only has room for one it only has room for one only one kind of an experience can can can fit on this broad way which we know is the Pentecostal experience only one Doctrine One Faith one baptism one Lord see uh can fit on this this broad or this this narrow way only one character that can that can fit on this this narrow way which is the character of Jesus Christ can you say Amen only one church not not many churches there's many churches in the Broadway many denominations many different ideas many different thoughts but there's only one Church there's only one bride and and that bride is not only got the mechanics she has the Dynamics can you say amen that's right to the mechanics that's right see so this Narrow Path only has room for one and this is why I believe that it's in Jude that he would tell the church contain him for the faith where it was once delivered because any other ain't going to work ain't that right they were already falling away from that one Doctrine from the one Faith from the one uh belief and and one Lord they were already fallen away uh uh in into another way and and Judas tell them you you can't walk that narrow away unless you come back to the faith a man that was once delivered ain't that right and and so we we find again about this narrow path you remember the the vision that brother Branham had of of of of the bride and and he said he was taken by someone and he was set up in a in in a on a high place so he could uh stand and see and and and and and he's uh brother Brahm said I heard the sweetest music I ever heard and he saw women of different nationalities at the age of 18 to 20 years old ain't that right they all all had long hair they they and was fixed in different dresses tight dresses and they were marching just as perfectly in Step can you say man all of them marching had the same step one two three you know as they're marching everything and he said they were marching perfectly in step with that music as it could be but then the next thing he sees is he sees the churches of the world he would call it in one place and he says I heard rock and roll band coming and when I looked over to my right side and coming up this way coming back here come the churches of the world each one carrying their own Banner ain't that right see from where they were from some of the dirtiest looking things I ever seen in my life and when the American Church come up it was the off list I'd ever saw and and the the heavenly father is my judge they had on the these tattletail gray skirts like one of these bar room girls with no back on it up here and holding up like a gray looking piece of paper and brother Brown says gray is a deceiving color ain't that right so with these women now these churches were deceiving a man and he says and look like hula dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes twisting as they walked to rock and roll and I said is that the Church of the United States of all said yes it is and when they passed by they had to hold you know the paper like this and put the paper behind them when they passed by and and and so if you notice they did not and none of them there walked like the first first church that he saw the the first uh uh part but then and brother Branham tells us of the reaction that he had after seeing this these worldly churches the Church of Amer American he said when I saw that I and knowing what was going on my heart locked a broke in me what have I done how have I missed it I've stayed right with that word Lord how could I have done it so he thought this was the result of his ministry he thought this was the product of his ministry and and and and so you could understand how how tore up he would be knowing that he was the one to to to shape the church he was the one to to bring the church amen back and and he thought well and this is all I've done you know and and so uh he says you know I thought well why how why would you give me a vision not long ago and see me in there uh talking beyond the curtain of time and and I said well will they have will they have to be judged and he said polls group uh two and I said I preached the same word he did did Christian businessmen carried the article of it and I said why why would this be like this and I've seen that bunch of prostitutes going by like that all dressed up like that and called The Church of Miss American I just fainted and and and so he said but then I heard that real sweet music again and here come that little same bride coming by again and he said this the angel said this is what comes out though this is what comes out of that dirty filthy Bunch this is what comes out of that prostitutes can you say man see and and so and when she walked by she's exactly like the like the one was in the first place walking to the step of the music of God's word watching on or marching on by and when I saw it I stood there with both hands up crying like that and I come to and I was standing on my porch looking out across the field and what he asked what she's to be the same bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place now he takes us to Malachi 4 and says see if we're not supposed to have an message in the last days that will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original Pentecostal message word by word Brothers we are here can you say man so so I'm I'm so glad a man that that that that that the uh there would be uh uh someone that could lead us amen and show us the way the paths of righteousness can you say man so if you notice brother branham's Ministry had no effect on the churches of the world it does not have an effect and and and now I I believe that it's bringing judgment up upon the people I I believe that it's bringing amen judgment upon America the message has done that do you believe that that but she had to reject it she had to turn from that amen so as it was with Moses's message amen you realize that Moses was to put the children of Israel on the path home they he's message put them on the path to home can you say man brother Graham called it the path of Duty ain't that right amen and so the message affected the people to where they would leave Egypt they would leave the garbage they would leave slavery they would walk into freedom to their Homeland by the message of a prophet amen but yet that message amen become a judgment to Egypt ain't that right and so as we know it is today amen but see so we we find that that uh the brother branham's Ministry did have an effect and still is having effect upon this last day bride and and and and and and and you will be exactly like the one at the first can you say Amen you will be like the one because the prophet saw you march into the same beat of God's word a man not out of state not not just twisting him and holding your own Banner but you were marching to the steps of the word of God ain't that right now to me that's a paradox a man because uh uh there there's you know uh as we talked Sunday there's no beauty that we should desire him there's he there there's nothing that would attract but some something attracted us and it wasn't just the seventh grade educated uh uh man up there it was Jesus Christ showing himself a man through uh the ministry ain't that right so the first church in this last church are walking the same path every believer walks the same path the paths of righteousness now notice brother Branham in his prayer said let the people come from different parts and look in him here and see the way their conduct is and how they shut back from the world or from the things of the world back into the real true genuine Pentecostal path of real genuine Pentecostal experiences walking with you blameless help me wants that tonight amen that's what we desire that's what we pray for is that it the peoples around the world the peoples in this community a man can look best of all of the of of of of uh uh uh when they look in here when they can look at us and and observe us they they can see a man a a people that uh by our conduct that we are shocking as brother Brown would call that or or uh abstaining as Paul would say it in in King James abstaining from the things of the world ain't that right and that they could see that we are walking a true genuine Pentecostal path a man with true genuine Pentecostal experiences walking with the Lord blameless can you say man and so they all walk and and this is if you're part of this bride in this last day you're walking in the steps a man of of the word of God you're walking uh uh in the step of God's word showing showing there is no alternative Amen to this path there there isn't amen you you walk as the prophet said they were walking in the steps a man of God's word in the path of God's word and there and there was no alternative when it comes to walking the paths of righteousness can you say man and every believer must walk a man the same step do you believe that every believer a man must walk the same step now you know brother Brandon said that he saw two one or two of the women getting out of Step ain't that right amen and he a man screamed out get back in line ain't that right aren't you glad you got a message that can warn us to get back in line amen that's exactly right I thank God for the message of the hour yes sir I I'm glad that we can play them tapes I'm glad amen that we've got ministers here in this church a man that'll listen to them messages and preach the message Amen to us can you say amen amen that we can believe it that's right and if you believe this message you believe in a five-fold Ministry yes sir that's right see so so we we I I think this tells us that that this message is the only thing that can keep this bride in line that's right it's the only thing that can keep us in step with God's word and and and if a man woman boy girl is not walking in the step of God's word she's out of line ain't that right so we we find notice that one path is going to lead you away from God a man whereas the other path is going to lead you to God Amen closer to him one path is the path of the just the other path is the path of the wicked One path is the path of life in which the children of light walks amen and the other is the path of darkness in which the children of Disobedience walk can you say amen that's that's right see so so we find that those who walk the paths of righteousness amen uh which is the path of Life Light Amen brother Braham calls him the paths of light and life a man but they can discern and know the difference between good and evil between right and wrong between just and unjust can you say man we're not walking in this world blindly we're not walking in this world groping as though that's the Way of the Wicked they stumble and not know what they stumble at but we've got light can you say man we've got light and and that's why we can boldly amen declare we can boldly walk in this life amen with confidence because we know who we are yes it is the darkest age but we've got life yes it is we uh the most deceiver as deceiving age that we've got the spirit of Truth lighting our path can you say Amen yes sir so we we find that that God says uh uh uh to to the path uh the the wicked uh because there's no there's no uh light in that path it's a path the darkness and they know not what they stumble at and so God tells them in this age you know uh says to them Thou Art wretched blind miserable and naked and knoweth that not ain't that right now I want to tell you that these paths these two paths have nothing in common with one another amen that's right two different influences two different atmospheres two different results ain't that right and God has always called for a separation amen always brother Brown said separate from your Associates separate from your habits separate from everything and come out and stand alone for God stand alone and if you'll ever notice as as I had not brought it in at uh uh is that David amen the prophet said David as a Shepherd a man would lead his sheep he was not he didn't lead them in the cities where the the people were he led them alone amen he was there alone just him and his sheep out there away from all influences out there away from everything amen no other voice but the shepherd's voice can you say amen and the Sheep you know and and David's singing to them amen and it was alone well I believe our Shepherd leads us to a place that is just us and God Alone can you say amen amen he doesn't lead us to where we're we're hearing all these other voices around do you believe that you could go on the job site and not hear the voices of the world I just believe that you could you could walk amen I know we're in this world and and and we've got to rub shoulders at the store or whatever but I just believe that you could come under the influence of the Holy Ghost to where the negative voices won't have any influence over your life again amen that the layout is his spirits amen have no influence on your soul your life again amen we're all these nudity and these filthy dressed women amen will have no influence over your eyes again amen because you're walking in a world alone with God Amen do you believe you can do that well I just believe that because that's the Shepherd that is leading us amen amen amen amen so we find a man that you must you must separate amen if you're going to walk the paths of righteousness you've got to separate amen uh Abraham had to separate himself Moses had to separate amen himself Ruth had to separate herself Israel as a nation had to separate itself from other nations and and uh Joshua and Caleb as the elective God had to separate amen their testimony from the other testimonies they had to separate their their their convictions from the other convictions they had to separate their faith from the unbelief they had to separate oh yes sir it was hard for them amen because there was ten spies amen and and and and and or 12 Spies ten was given a negative report amen and and you you know good and well as it is today amen they they were probably being blamed for kissing up to Moses and and and you know kind of being the teacher's pet and and all that because because Joshua and Caleb just would not listen to anybody all down to the through through and well let's see what Moses had to say about this first you know and maybe they would try to jive with them and try to whine and dine them tried to get them over to their side so they could all come against Moses but thank God there was somebody that stood with Moses through it all amen and it may have been just a few amen but they didn't see amen what the critics saw they didn't listen to what the critics were listening to amen they were seeing Moses in a different light and I say I see this message in a different life brother Andrew I See You In a Different Light I see brother Terry In a Different Light I see these ministers in a different light amen than what the critics are what the world and all these other guys amen got to say about it this message is right can you say Amen this message is right there is a Rapture there is a amen a body change that's on its way the angel of the Lord is here with us you just got to separate yourself from all the trash I'm coming and you say man I think it would be good for people to do it for about Faith Tabernacle too separate from all the nonsense out there amen and see that God is with us and see that God if there is something valuable in this church can you say Amen but you see Joshua and Caleb that's the elect they had to separate from from the other people amen and Kadesh Barney approved that they had done just that their hearts weren't tainted with the unbelief and skepticism as the others their confession didn't bring an evil report as did the others amen they didn't have an evil heart of unbelief as did the others can you say amen and even God bore record of that for Jesus or Paul said they uh well even Jesus said that they're all dead can you say amen and they're all dead ain't that right amen and what that was that brother Brown said eternally separated from God that Joshua and Caleb God honored them amen God honored their faith God honored them for separating from the world can you say Amen brother Brown said in speaking of the rest of Israel he said when carnal Minds begin to come among them it finally drove them off the main path into the desert and they made their fatal mistake when they failed to go on ain't that right always carnal Minds always carnal Minds that are trying to get the people off the paths of righteousness oh you can still be religious y'all yeah we know the way that Moses is trying to go oh you don't have to go that way you don't have to do this you don't have to do that but what they done is them carnal Minds got the people from looking got him to look away from the pillar of fire got him to look away from the Supernatural and all they could see was Moses a man all they could see is the Moses that got faults and all they could see is Moses this and old fatty daddy Moses and all this and and all of that that what they failed to see was there was a pillar of fire they should have stood with Moses and separated from their unbelief now Church separation is a is something that is required Joshua had to separate Israel from Aiken and his family ain't that right Aiken's sin had caused Israel to fail in battle and we know how Joshua made that separation amen he made that Separation by putting to death amen Aiken and his whole family amen ain't that right you see he cut uh uh and Joshua knew how to make that separation amen there was sin in the camp and he wanted to get rid of that sin ain't that right amen and sin will go in a man's genealogy in his seed after him amen uh we find that in the Old Testament a man's sin lived on in his seed Adam's sin affected his seed ain't that right Adam not only lost everything but the prophet said Adam's seed lost everything as well amen lost absolutely everything see now now you could go we could do a study on that Ahab and how did the sins came upon his children and all the way down amen now we know we know though that there is a way to cut that sin off aren't you glad for that amen there there is a way and that's the blood of Jesus Christ amen for first John 1 7 if we walk in the light as he is in the light key word if everybody say if if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from some sins all sins ain't that right all sins that means my sins my daddy sins my mama's sins my my great-grandfather's sins you understand what I'm saying amen all of that from the family tree is cut off and it makes a paradox out of us well it's true amen I just believe that there's power in the blood can you say Amen well we we find but but Joshua amen he he he had cut that sin out Amen to show us that you've got to cut the sin out separate from the sin can you say Amen you got to separate from all unbelief do you believe that God is separate it if something is causing you to stay behind and not fight not win your battles find out where it is separate from it I don't care if it's thoughts of unbelief I don't care if it's words of unbelief I don't care if it's actions of unbelief separate yourself if your thoughts are contrary to the word of God to separate yourself if your five senses are contrary to this word separate yourself if your emotions are are contrary Amen to What God Says separate yourself can you say Amen if you're hanging around people who speak or act contrary to the word of God separate yourself now brother that's important that you separate yourself and you say man brother Brown says now be careful of your Associates when you get out there and get amongst the people and this one begins to tell you this and this one that and then you get yourself all mixed up and now you don't know what to do see you don't know what you do believe can you say man why you didn't separate yourself that's right I've seen good-hearted people that used to believe this message was all their heart then get mixed up with a bunch of uh of unbelievers now they don't know what to believe I'm sure you've talked to him too if they don't know what to believe then you say Amen some of them have turned completely against it they should have separated themselves then you say Amen you got to separate if you're going to walk the paths of righteousness ain't that right I've seen people that were pillars in the church they want support of the local church they weren't supported amen the pastor the ministry and only to to end up listening to a bunch of Renegades that do nothing but complain about anything they can and find fault about anything that they can amen and and the the people that used to be the the pillars in the church amen now they they have no Zeal for the Lord they have no Zeal for the things of God they they have no and you wonder where are they at it's because they've listened Amen to things they shouldn't have listened you've got to separate yourself can you say man it's not he that starts this race it's he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved ain't that right now proverbs 4 and 24 it says put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee ain't that right whether it's you that has these things or you're associating with such a one put it far from there ain't that right Believers ain't to have perverse lips and a forward mouth speaking perverse things we know what that is things contrary to the word of God ain't that right Believers ain't supposed to have that and ain't supposed to be around it separate yourself cut it off we're walking the paths of righteousness ain't that right he says let Thine Eyes the 25th verse let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before the Ponder everybody say Ponder consider the path of thy feet ain't that right Ponder the path see and let all thy ways everybody say all thy ways be established let all thy ways be established don't don't don't come unbalanced amen don't don't let the winds cause the winds are coming to blow amen the trials are going to come the pressure's going to come but let thy ways be established Amen to where you know where you're at you know where you're going you know you know you know you're not sitting there guessing about it you're not sitting there wondering you're not sitting here confused if you make a step Let It Be An established step amen if you make progress let it be a progress to God Amen whatever you do let it be that you know that God approves of it can you say Amen turn not to the right hand or to the left so this path is the middle the middle of the road turn not from the right or to the left and remove thy foot from evil ain't that right hope this all right Psalms 26 2 examine me this is David examine Me O Lord and prove me try my Reigns and my heart for thy loving kindness is before mine eyes and I have walked in thy truth oh my I have not sat with vain persons neither will I go in with uh dissemblers see I have not in other words and I will not be part of them ain't that right I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked amen see in other words David said I'm not going to be associated with things that are contrary to God Amen if if someone wants to disbelieve that ain't me and I don't want to associate with it my ears are not garbage cans can you say amen amen I I'm I don't care what the critic says I don't I'd rather stand with a Believer any day in and and deal with all the faults and the failures and and all the struggles that they're going through amen then to associate in the in the congregation of the wicked can you say amen and so here David says I've hated the congregation of evildoers and will not see it with the wicked remember he's the one that's being led in the paths of righteousness so his works his actions is showing the path that he's walking on Amen this is a narrow path I ain't got time I ain't got time to to Baby everybody else I ain't got time Amen to bring everybody over amen if you want to come over come under the blood if you want to come over make the Lord your Shepherd if you want to come over you've got to walk the paths of righteousness can you say Amen this is not a broad way it is a narrow way David he didn't hate for he says I've hated the congregation of evil doers he didn't hate in the way that the world hates the believer mean hateful seeking to destroy but what David is is is is saying is he's letting it be known as to what side he's on no don't don't you don't you just hate being around someone that they're being nice to you but you know down in your heart or or the that they they would they would love to to hit you or they would love to to whatever you you really don't know where they stand with you you understand what I'm saying you you don't know you know they they love you Pat you on the back and then you know give it just a little ways and then they turn on you and before you know it their their fangs are sticking out and their claws are sticking out and and and all these things but David is making it clear he's making it known God I'm not one of these people can you say Amen I'm not saying I love you through one part of my mouth and and the other part I'm saying oh it's okay I know I know I know you're okay I know that preacher is a little bit hard bless his heart and bless your heart too you'll be okay you just you just go on somewhere else he's a little narrow-minded well it's a narrow way can you say man it's a path of righteousness oh yes sir see so he did not mingle his colors to where a man didn't know where he stood can you say man I don't know about you but I want the Lord to know I'm on his side I want the believer to know I'm on their side amen I want to know I want the world to know that I'm on God's side can you say man I'm on the side of the redeemed I'm on the side of the people that is determined to make it to heaven I'm on the side of the people that ain't playing games and and wondering here and wondering there and wondering there and wants to be padded and babied and all of these things I want to be on the side of those that are rugged true blue Christians and this is what David is saying he's letting it be known as to what side he is on can you say man he sided with truth because he walked in truth he is associated with the believer because he was a Believer he walked in righteousness because he was righteous ain't that right he stayed with Integrity because he had integrity and there was no other alternative for him amen he was standing with those that were true brother Brown says all in water don't mix and many times a many good life has been completely wrecked by your Associates show me your company I'll tell you who you are that's right it's an old proverb but it's the truth associate with people who believe God can you say man associate with people that ain't trying to destroy you associate with people amen that ain't trying to tear down the ministry associate people with people that's got anointing upon their life associate with people that you know that God has proved of their lives and they're living right and they're they're living true amen they're walking on the paths of righteousness they ain't living as a hypocrite they trying to cut Corners amen they're just trying to live for God can you say Amen as I have already stated in the past a man's character conduct Behavior and lifestyle tells what pathy's walking on if you're walking on the path of righteousness you ain't got room for other things if you're walking on the Broadway you can carry anything you want live any way you want act any old way you want talk about anything you want watch anything you want listen to anything you want can you say man I hope this is okay and and we'll get you excited and hopefully in a minute but brother Branham says any man can watch your own life and tell what you are if you just check up on yourself whether you're a really a Christian or not watch the things you do what you say and your Associates and so forth and you'll find out whether you really got anything there or not can you say Amen now Matthew 6 and 19 Jesus says lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal listen for where your treasure is there your heart will be also ain't that right so Jesus is telling us that there's Treasures both in Earth and both in heaven there's Treasures in Earth and there's Treasures in Heaven and wherever your heart is whatever treasure whether your heart is in heaven or your heart is on earth and the treasures there's where your treasure is going to be can you say man now if you're if you value the treasures in heaven then you'll look at the treasures see one man's junk is another man's treasure can you say man and I think that goes the same way a man that is not Heavenly minded that's junk to him but that's life to us it's a pearl of great price to us can you say amen he doesn't understand why to give up this and and the need to give up that and the need to give up this and and to live a holy life live a blameless life and live a life that is so pleasing unto the Lord can you say Amen but see a man that's got his heart in Heavenly Treasures amen that's where he's after that's what he's seeking for that that's that's his goal can you say man we'll leave anything here behind let me just have him but now if a man's got his if if his treasures are in heaven then then the Earthly Treasures are junk but if the man's heart is here in the treasures of this life then the Heavenly things are junk see you can't the the two men can't understand one another because their heart their passion their desire is is after two totally different things and you say Amen now I I just believe in people and I'm not talking here I'm just talking worldwide but if people can get out of their backslidden condition ah so to discern the difference in the treasures and to discern what we need to be holding on to and what we need to be letting go of can you say Amen because if we're walking the paths of righteousness there is a certain treasure there there is a certain desire there there is a certain thing we are after listen Colossians 3 1 if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above how many is risen with Christ risen with Christ if you're risen with Christ then then here's your actions now here's the works that follow that seek those things that are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God we could get into that that's but set your affections on things above and not on things on the Earth for you are dead you're dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then you shall appear also with him in glory ain't that right so when a man is dead and and and his life is hid with Christ and God then he seeks those things that are above because that's where his treasure is that's where his affection is that's where his heart is can you say amen and they're Heavenly Treasures now notice David says he leadeth me and I won't keep you much longer but Dave says he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and this is not talking about our own righteousness so so when we're talking of works and we're talking of these things we're not talking legalism we're not talking of of of these things but I'm I'm just here to tell you walking the paths of righteousness produces works now let's go into that for just a moment before we close it's not talking about our own righteousness um uh Isaiah 64 6 we are all as an unclean thing and all everybody say all our righteousness our s filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away ain't that right see so all of our righteousness is is are as filthy rags Galatians 2 19. Paul would say I do not frustrate the grace of God amen I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law which is the works of the flesh right that's what the works of the law was is men doing it without the help of God without the aid of God without the grace of God right that's right see amen he says then Christ is dead if righteousness if our righteousness the righteousness we gain come from by the law and and again the works of the flesh then Christ died in vain ain't that right correct the law produces righteousness leaves Christ out of the picture but Paul is saying there are works and yet it does not do away with the grace of God ain't that right we're not walking in our own righteousness and the law produced or or promoted self-righteousness ain't that right self works but yet we so it's not our we don't walk in our own righteousness but yet he leads us in the paths of righteousness but these are his Paths of righteousness look look at this second Timothy 1 9 he hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our own words but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ain't that right so now the message of the hour gives us a greater understanding of what uh uh righteousness means Matthew 3 and 13. it says then Jesus then then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized to thee and cometh thou to me and John answering and said unto him suffer to be so now for thus it becometh everybody say it become us to fulfill all righteousness ain't that right then he suffered him now John being a prophet he knew who Jesus was it was revealed to him that he was the Lamb of God he knew that his Revelation was correct ain't that right and he did the prophet said he did need to be baptized to Jesus they needed it but notice Jesus did not consent to that but Jesus being the word told John and said it was becoming to both of them to fulfill all righteousness keep that in mind fulfill our righteousness brother Brown said see if John and Jesus were the lights of that day then they had to fulfill all righteousness can you say Amen so it's been a question you know brother Brown talks about it even he wondered how is it that Jesus needed to be baptized of John for for baptism is after your confession and Jesus after your confession of sins and Jesus had no sins to confess so why is it that that that that he needed to be baptized of John uh uh when he was without sin and so Jesus just simply tells us why it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and he and seeing this without saying it he was referring to a scripture in in in the Old Testament can you say Amen so here we find that the prophet now takes that scripture it becamethas to fulfill our righteousness and takes us to the scripture that Jesus was referring to so Exodus 29 4 and Aaron and his sons uh Thou shalt bring unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and shalt wash them with water and thou shalt take the garments and put air upon Aaron the colt and the robe of the IP iPod and the iPod and the breastplate and gird him with the Curious girdle of the ephod and thou shall put the the miter upon his head and put the holy crown upon the miter then then Thou shalt take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him can you say Amen but what was the first thing he had to be washed before he was anointed he had to be washed now the understanding that Jesus had of this scripture was it pertains to me ain't that right so so even a prophet John feeling so humble and feeling so needful of to be baptized by Jesus recognizing who he was but Jesus stayed with the scriptures Jesus knew that he had to fulfill all righteousness and John was part of the scripture yeah for Jesus had to be baptized of John can you say Amen so we find it becometh us to fulfill now all righteousness now we know that he was the lamb he was Meek and gentle he was led he said my meat is to do the will of my father or the will of him that sent me and to finish his work ain't that right he was flexible to the word that he was predestinated to fulfill he was compliant to the leading of the spirit hello remember he's saying it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he's letting us know he's walking a path ain't that right he's not dumb to the word he's not ignorant to the word he knows he's predestinated can you say amen he was the word so he knew the word so he could be led to the Wilderness to be tempted flexible he could be led to the pool of Bethesda for one man flexible he can be led out of his way for one predestinated Soul who was a prostitute ain't that right he can be led to the Garden of Gethsemane he can be led to pilate's Hall he could be led like a sheep to the slaughter and yet it was all to fulfill all righteousness then you say man he was led in the paths of righteousness hope that's all right I want you to I want you to know now that being led by the spirit has its high and lows you're not always going to feel Goosebumps you're not always and again this is the narrow way you ain't got all kinds of purpose Jesus did not have all kinds of purposes he wasn't a jack of all trades he was there for one purpose and that was to fill fulfill the word of the father the will of the father can you say Amen and he has his highs and he had his loge have you ever just had your highs and your lows when you're high you're not questioning God where you are you know where you are but when you're down in the low you just wondered did I miss the boat where you at don't feel anything been there yeah well that's your half but one thing about Jesus is he did not need to feel anything he knew what the word was concerning him that's why you've got to have all your ways established and Ponder the feet of your paths amen so you have people do that understands and you have people that don't understand yet all the word the prophet says that God has spoken must be fulfilled ain't that right he says God cannot say anything without having it fulfilled when he has spoken it it is a finished work you believe that yes sir it's already finished when God speaks it God never speaks it until he's ready for it to be and when he speaks it's just as well as already happened ain't that right so as we close now Jesus was the word made flesh ain't that right he wasn't an impersonator he was the word made flesh brother Brown said his sinless nature expressed God's word see he was the word so God expressed himself by that sinless nature he another place he in the word was the same so the word could just flow through him there was no doubt at all oh my God help us right no doubt at all he was completely separated from all unbelief he lived in a world unto himself ain't that right amen now notice what the prophet said God is trying to get somebody through the sanctifying power of Christ to yield to that word that he and the word can be won again then he can use his word through that person and you say Amen your dreams have got to go your ideas have got to go your Ambitions have got to go and they got to focus on one thing and that is the word of God you understand that you were predestinated brother Tim for this message of the hour you were predestinated to fulfill the word for this hour ain't that right now notice if his sinless nature God expressed himself through that sinless nature and it shows that our nature is evil and is no matter how much we try to patch it up see it's still evil or how much we try to in document made it with other things it's got to become sinless everybody say it's got to become sinless who your nature those that are walking the paths of righteousness it's got to become sinless like his was and then hereby say and then God's word can flow through it can you say Amen but it wasn't it's not meaning perfection in yourself it's not meaning that you've got to be perfect in yourself you go because because you can't do that ain't that right amen even though we practice the way of Holiness I believe in Holiness standards do you believe in all in his standards we still believe in Holiness ain't that right but that is not making us perfect that only reflects a Perfection has been done it reflects a perfect life that is in US ain't that right brother Brown said it only reflects what we're possessing so he says he is our example he is our sin Bearer and if then if we profess that he is our Peacemaker he is our propitiation then if we profess that then that is supposed to reflect him back in US right so so we're not here trying to be sinless in that it's our own righteousness but we're looking to him as our peace we're looking to him as one that has taken our sins we are looking unto him as the one that is the justifier can you say Amen we are we we are looking to him as the cause of our righteousness and when we're confessing that and we're looking at that then he is reflected back in US can you say man supposed to reflect him back in us we are written epistle a looking glass or a mirror that people can see Christ in US now if they don't then we're looking at something else and we're not looking to him looking to him all the ends of the world and live can you say Amen so what did Jesus tell us to do seek ye first the kingdom of God and his everybody say he is righteousness ain't that right that's what you're to do that's what I'm supposed to do is seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness brother Brown said his sinless nature expressed the word of God so much that he and the Word was one he said so I and my father are one I always do that which pleases see uh uh I and my father are just one he was so perfect in the image of God until he and God was the express same thing he was the flesh the son that expressed the deity of God so that made him deity in a man in order to redeem a man can you say Amen notice now he and the word became one that the word could express and could show to the world that example of what man should be aren't you glad for that he being that example now again you can't be that in yourself brother Brian said you can't educate yourself into it you can't School yourself into it you you you you can't join it baptize it he said the only thing you can do is kill it kill your nature kill it right that's right and he says and let it be born again and a new nature come in that's the only thing kill that nature of yourself that you might become and then the word everybody say then the word becomes a living thing and the word becomes a living thing right what Treasures it just expresses itself through you then you're looking in the looking glass or the mirror when people sees you as a mirror oh do you love him any wonderful we could go on but if the musicians will come he leads me in the paths of righteousness and brother Brown said what is the righteousness his word his word it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness or all his word he leads me in the paths of his word can you say Amen and if you notice first of all David would tell us that his soul was restored he restoreth my soul amen he couldn't write about the paths of righteousness if the soul the soul has to be restored as we've as we've seen your flesh can be anointed if that doesn't mean you're saved your spirit can be anointed but that doesn't mean you're saved you can shout dance speak in tongues prophesy dream dreams roll on the floor ain't that right but when that Soul has become restored where God is able to establish his throne in your heart that's the throne room then brother Brown said it's the soul that controls the spirit and the spirit controls the flesh [Music] that whoever's in that soul and if Christ is in that soul it brings everything in subjection to the word of God remember I'm talking about the man that was prophesying speaking in tongues and it was true shook his hand found out he was living with a totally different woman a children buyer wasn't even his wife living an adultery brother brim brought it up to him and he took off why he was anointed but the soul and we've seen a lot of that we've seen a lot of junk if I could say it that way that that really makes the the message a uh laughing stock is because people hadn't had a nature change can you say man but there's a people that has the Lord as their Shepherd they're not just going after the gifts they're not just going after the Thrills and the Frills they're not just going after anything the glittery things [Music] but their purpose is to be led and to fulfill all righteousness every promise that God spoke for this age must be fulfilled by you and I can you say man you love the Lord [Music] what song give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the word it's a light that I might see give
