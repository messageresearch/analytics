one more time and it reaches have you experienced it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh it flows flows to the Lord foreign that gives me strength s from there day today it will never lose it's time where would we be without his blood would be lost would be undone we wouldn't be able to have fellowship with our Lord and have no hope of a rapture all the things that we believe in would be in vain a man would never be able to grasp the promises of God and partake of them but it's because of the blood of Jesus Christ amen after that blood was shed then we received the command come boldly before the throne of grace don't come timid don't come doubting don't come worrying you come boldly why there's an atonement that blood speaking on our behalf every day that blood is there atoning for us you say well I've made mistakes don't matter the blood is there speaking on your behalf come boldly it doesn't change the command of God no matter how much a man has fallen a man he still comes to that throne of grace boldly because he knows there's a blood there atoning amen and I'm so glad for that and no matter how much this you know impossible the situation looks you never let your situation intimidate you you come boldly before the throne of grace because the blood is so much greater than your problems it's it's so much greater than your weakness it's so much greater than anything Amen in the blood of Jesus Christ and I'm so glad for that it's a perfect blood because it come from a perfect sacrifice God himself become man so he could bleed for you I think that's powerful God himself become flesh and blood bones so he could take his own blood and produce an atonement what other atonement do we need there is no other atonement that could make it happen but then the prophet would tell us a perfect blood brought forth a perfect loosening amen Amy's loosed it's a perfect loosening if he and and you know if he loosed you one day then you can never be bound the next it's a perfect loosening you say but I have gone through so much trouble since I gave my heart to the Lord that doesn't matter it's a perfect loosening yes in this life you're always going to go through your battles amen but there's an atonement and I'm so glad for that you love the Lord in the wonderful just to be a Christian Hallelujah I'm so glad to be a Christian and not just that I'm glad to be an heir to every promise of God amen so we're not Beggars here this morning we are Sons and Daughters of God with the authority from heaven so whatever you have need of today you can have a man you can have your

so we the good time of Fellowship around their grandson's birthday party yesterday and a little Malachi and uh a little warm but uh tell you what it made us want to get closer to heaven or to God and get closer to him I was listening to brother Ron and I think it was Friday night and he made a good statement and he said you know he says this this is the closest to Heaven that this sinner will ever come to is here on Earth and he said but he said it's the closest to hell that a real believer will ever get to I'm thinking thank God for that amen and uh so as we were in that Barn watching Everybody sweat and it was hot and I'm thinking this I'm just thankful that this is the closest to hell that we'll ever get to praise the Lord amen we're going to a great land amen land of promise and good to have brother Tim back with us and and I always miss the home folk when they're gone and and but glad just always we have the opportunity to come together and Worship the Lord and so uh we're

that for the message of the hour and and stand strong with it and preach and uh to bless the bride of Christ and so we want him just to take his time his Liberty and preach what the lord has laid on his heart and we want a pool we want to pull on the gift and how he's come just hungering for more of God I sure am and and uh we just need the Lord amen and no doubt there are needs here that are present and as long as we're in this Mortal body there'll always be needs and sometimes we don't even know we have the needs that God does and so he speaks to through a minister and to just to deliver

your heart there's nothing past present or future amen that can separate you from the love of God that is in Christ amen I was just hearing the prophet of God say this morning he was quoting The Book of Romans and he said not death Peril famine sword nakedness nothing can separate us from the love of God and amen I'm thankful this morning to be covered by his love amen amen we want to say God

he's mindful Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this beautiful Sunday morning Father Lord this Resurrection Sunday that you've allowed us to gather ourselves together and your house once more Lord we're not coming to a building we're not coming to A A an organization but Lord we're coming to the presence of God we're coming into where reality is Lord father these are not just Services these are not just Gatherings but Lord these are conferences with you where you come on the scene and Lord you discern the thoughts and intents of the Heart by the preaching of your word and Lord I believe that you're still a fixture I believe you can still fix situations I believe you can still change circumstances so this morning dear God as we've sung the songs of Zion Lord your Prophet said that the singing went before the word he said then when the when the ark came he said then the battle battle set in and Lord we know that that that's where the enemy battles us Lord is when it comes to this word but Lord we know you've never been defeated anywhere anytime any place under any conditions so Lord I'm not standing here this morning hoping that you will get the victory out of this service but Lord you've already gotten it Lord and I know that you're going to reveal that Victory to hearts and lives here this morning father I pray for those that are sick May

and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen just before we read this morning I do want to say happy anniversary to my wife on yesterday uh I sure sure love her and appreciate her and I think I thank God for a holy ghost wife amen that amen she told somebody I said actually we got married we went on our honeymoon come home for one day and hit the road and I think the first place we come after we got married was here and preached and she's just been a faithful support and help to us and we sure sure love and appreciate her this morning amen The Book of Job the 42nd chapter in the first verse the Bible says then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou cast do everything how many believes that and that no fault can be withholding from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak and I will demand Of Thee I watch these words declare thou unto me so job is actually wanting God he's demanding God declare yourself to me in the fifth verse he says I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now mine I see a thee amen declare thou unto me I've heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now might I see a thee he says wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and Ashes now in the book of First John the first chapter I want to look at the first verse of First John 1. I know it's a very familiar reading to you in first John 1 and verse 1 the Bible says here John is describing the person of Christ and he says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested so this is not any kind of life this is absolute life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now look here in the third verse that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full I love verse 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him here's that word again and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all amen we ask Lord this one and to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning amen how many can say thank you Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen I want you here by the help of the Lord for just a few moments I want to speak to here and if I will title this this morning I want to speak to you on a hearing seeing and declaring the message hearing seeing and declaring the message you know first John 1 5 he uses the word there message which we believe that we are followers of the end time message amen we're not ashamed of it that's who we are that's what we believe it's what we preach it's what we study amen we are uh Vindicated Believers of this end time word now when John uses this word word message the Greek definition is an announcement it is a promise it is the act of promising it is a promise given or to be given amen it's a promise good or a blessing so when John says this then is the message he's actually saying this then is the promise this then is the announcement this in this the the blessing that God is going to give to you amen and what he's showing you here amen is you've got to hear it you've got to see it but then you've got to declare it now brother Brandon preaches hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God and he said now first Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God he said then the believer hears it and recognizes it and then acts on it he said the carnal man will hear it the sound of it but never so the carnal man will hear it they will hear the sound of it but they will never act upon it because here means to understand it right now look at it it's looking at something but you see it is to understand it so so when you're looking at it you're actually looking at it physically but when you see it you actually understand it and Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God in other words he cannot understand the kingdom of God now amen I believe that we have seen the message how many will agree we've we've seen the message we've looked at it we've read it amen our physical natural eyes have seen it we've seen the pictures amen some of you all have been to the places where things happen you've been to the to Sabino Canyon to say you've been to all these places so you've seen him amen if you haven't been there to see it you've been in the church and you've heard it we've all seen the message we've all heard the message but I believe Amen brother Terry that the time has come to declare the message I I believe the time has come amen not just to say we've seen it not just to say we've heard it amen but the time has come to declare it I love what Isaiah 48 verse 6 says thou has heard amen see all things and will not ye declared thouest heard you have seen all these things but will you not declare it he said I have showed thee new things from this time even hidden things amen and thou didst not know them in Acts 20 verse 27 I love what Paul says he says I have not shunned to declare unto you the all the counsel of God Amen I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God now look at this word shunned it means to draw back it means to let down it means to lower to withdraw he meant of a timid person to withdraw oneself Amen to hesitate amen of those who from Timothy hesitate to avow what they believe amen so you can actually see something you can hear it amen but if there's a spirit of timidness if there's a spirit amen of shyness upon you then you will actually draw back amen when that's actually the time to declare what you believe they've been seek to be unwilling to utter from Fear now how many knows that fear is not of God Amen it comes from the Devil the Bible says amen he is not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind the book of Romans he said the spirit of fear again no amen but the spirit of adoption whereby we cry by father so God Amen has not given us the spirit of fear amen that he's given us the spirit of anointing and the spirit of Revelation Amen to declare the things that we have seen and the things that we've heard I love what the prophet says here and looking unto Jesus he said now in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here amen under my control to declare the word of God Amen I take every spirit in the building under my control Amen to declare the word of God now he had seen the word he had heard the word but now the time had come to declare the word amen and there were spirits of opposition there was Demons of resistance there were Demons of doubt and demons of unbelief that was pushing against him amen but rather than drawing back and withdrawing himself he stood there today declare the word of God I say thank God Amen for a prophet who is not afraid to stand the hair in the face of whatever the case was and declare amen that Jesus Christ is God Amen he's a Healer he's a savior he's a deliverer come on church amen how easy would it have been for him to come before the boy down on all fours being led around by a chain amen and backed up and said well that's a little too hard amen but he stood there and he declared the same God that saved my soul amen can save the soul that's in that boy because he is a savior and he is a redeemer now I love how John writes here in first John 1 3 he said that which we have seen and heard amen declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us amen and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ can I can I just lay a few words in here amen look at this word scene the Bible says amen which we have seen that word means to see with the eye it means to see with the mind or to receive it means to know to become acquainted with by experience a minute it means this word gives prominence Amen to the Discerning mind when the physical side recedes amen this word that knows perception in general amen as resulting princely principally amen from Vision the prominence being in the mental element so when you see something amen it's actually coming from The Faculty of vision and you all know the Bible says where there is no vision amen the people will perish so if there's no vision then there's nothing to see and if there's nothing to see there's nothing to hear and if there's nothing to hear there's nothing to declare amen but I say to you this morning we have a vision amen and it's a real Vision it's a true Vision amen it's the word of God we have seen the vision of God's word he said we have seen and we have heard that word heard amen means not to be death amen it means to perceive by the ear amen what is announced in one's presence amen so when something is seen are announced by Vision amen you perceive it by the ear amen then you actually have the ability to speak what you have seen and what you have heard amen it means to learn to give ear to amen a teaching or a teacher so when you hear something amen you're giving your ear Amen to hear you're giving your ear to receive what is being given I love this one to declare it means to bring Tidings back from a person or a thing amen it means to bring a word to bring a report amen I love this one it means to Proclaim and to make known openly amen when you declare something there is no hesitation when you declare something there is no reservation you are declaring what I have seen and what I've heard amen is worthy to be told again it's worthy Amen to be repeated and I'll say this I believe that God Amen has sent us a message in this generation amen and it ought to be the faculty it ought to be the focus point it ought to be amen it ought to be more than just books on the shelf and I'm to be more than just tapes in the library or on your iPhone amen but this message ought to be the preeminence of every Church it ought to be the preeminence of her home it ought to be the preeminence of every Ministry listen friends we're not holding a Baptist idea we're not fellowshipping around a Pentecostal idea amen but this message is first John 1 it's the life of God that has come into this Hey listen they've seen it they heard it amen but nobody could declare it like this age amen but in this age the Revelation has come and we have seen the revelation we have heard the Revelation but now there's a voice upon the Earth Amen to declare that God is God and His word is true and his power is here listen we're not playing good church we're not playing with this message amen we've been anointed to declare it you say well I'm young declare it anyhow well I'm old declared anyhow well I'm not rich declare it anyhow well I've got money amen whatever position you're in in life forget that position and declare the word of God it's the life that is coming to this age amen now when you begin to declare this John goes on to say Amen we write these things unto you that's your joy may be full amen so we've just identified the source of joy in the church it is coming from what we have seen and what we've heard and what we are declaring then he said this then is the message somebody say the message this then is the message which we have heard of him and we declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all Reverend said now he reveals these things by his foreknowledge to those who he has ordained to these things otherwise they don't see it see amen standing right there looking right at it and he cannot see it he said how many ever seen the picture of a cow in the bush that you just have to look and look did you ever see that or seen the picture of Christ in the bush or in the sky or clouds amen see that painter has got that fixed up so well to when you just have to look at it at a certain way amen so you you can't just glance at it and see it you can't just walk by it and look at it and see it but you've got to actually begin to study over it and then you got to begin to pour into it amen if you're going to find the picture you've got to look at it in a certain way y'all ever been out in Arizona and actually in the mountains amen is a profile of William Branham amen you stand there and somebody say over there it's a profile of a prophet's face amen when you can stand there and look at it amen and most people will never see it amen but somebody found it because they didn't just look at it amen but they begin to study it and when they studied it they seem there amen is a prophets facing the mountain listen friends if you look at this message the only thing you're going to see is about the quotes and scriptures and ideas but if you'll begin to study this message Amen in a certain way it'll begin to unlock an anointing in your life it'll begin to release a power among church I think it's high time Amen to get back to studying the message amen quick just well God have mercy I might as well preach amen these tapes are not just room noise amen these books are not just books to flip through before service amen but we ought to ponder over these things we ought to lay in these things we ought to give our lives Amen to we see what a prophet was saying listen if you don't look at it in a certain way you're never going to see the picture he said well then when you once see it amen you can't see nothing else amen so until you looked at it in a certain way you never seen it but brother Matt when you actually saw it amen then you can't see nothing else I remember one time Isaac Hatfield now amen we were taking a float trip down the New River we're just going down through there and this guy told us he said look at that rock he said in the 70s they said that rock looked like an elephant he said look at that rock in the in the 70s they said that rock looked like a lion amen now when you go by there look at them rocks amen before somebody told me I did not see what they were talking about amen but now when I go by them rocks I can see it because I saw it well I feel good I can see it because I saw it and now I can't see nothing else oh church are you hearing me when you see this message is Rapture and Faith you can't see nothing else when you see this message it's the power to make you an invincible Army you can't see nothing else when you see this is revelation 10 and Malachi 4 and Luke 17 30 and John 3 and John 4 when you see this message amen you can't see nothing else he said because there it is he said well that's the same way it is with Christ is himself amen the gospel the message is when you once see the message of the hour he said there's nothing else you can see amen but that that's all he said everything else is gone amen the rest of it is just a filler see when you once see the message that's why I don't study Dr Dobson that's why I don't pour into Matthew Henry that's why I don't lay in Charles person that's why I don't study all these reformers amen because cause yeah they had good points amen but I've seen the message amen and the rest of it is just feeling and I might as well preach that now amen I think it's time we load our sermons up amen with things that a prophet taught I'm not talking about surfing Google amen and finding a good few little fiery points I'm talking about laying them tapes and laying them books until you catch a revelation of what a prophet was trying to establish and then you can come to the puppy and you can face any devil any Spirit any pressure and you will not withdraw yourself you will not become timid you will not back away you will stand there in a vow and declare with everything that's within you I believe what I'm saying because it is a revelation to me say in the to the hour amen is a personal contact amen with the person of the message you say well who's the person of the message well don't get mad at me amen but brother branham's not the person of the message don't get mad at me Amen brother Sean brother brother Ron brother Tim amen any preacher I brother Wayne any preacher is not the person of the message amen the person of the message is Jesus Christ probably God said before you come out and confess the Holy Ghost he said confess you have the baptism he said there ought to be such a personal contact with God until all the intellectuals in the world Amen could not explain it away from you he said you know because you've been there you've had the witness and you know it's the truth he said another place we get so soured down on theology till we don't know nothing about the spirit he said I hope you love me after this amen I'm talking to Pentecost too amen just shouting and dancing around doesn't mean you know anything about the spirit he said it's a personal contact amen face to face that's what you need amen that's a kind amen of church God's fixing to raise up amen that's right when they come together in the unity and the power of the spirit amen God is not raising up a church that is looking at him from a distance he's not racing up a church that is looking at him and does not know him face to face amen but he's going to raise up a church amen that's going to know him Amen in the power of this Resurrection listen they're going to know what he looks like they're going to know his nature they're going to know his characteristics you know why because they've not just taken a glance brother will they have seen him in a certain way and they can't unseen somebody say face to face amen face to face Amen brother Matt would you come here for a second would you help me amen amen we're going to see God Amen face to face amen face that wall amen now here's brother Matt I see him he's standing here and I say brother Matt how are you brother Matt what's your name her brother man where do you work brother man uh did you grow up brother Matt how old are you amen I'm asking him all these questions amen but but I don't see him amen but if he turns around amen and I look at him amen I'm looking at him face to face I know what he looks like amen I can shake his hand I can have fellowship with him thank you amen because I've met him in the face-to-face experience thank you buddy amen are you hearing me church this message was not you looking at God Amen from a distance through a denomination amen this message was the person of Jesus Christ they've been coming into the church and he was not facing the wall he was not facing the corner but he's looking at you come on church do you realize this message takes you back Amen to a river of Jordan experience when the Bible said John was baptized in Jesus in the river and he said the word came to the word he said the word stood face to face with a word and this message is the meeting amen of the face of the written word with the face of the predestinated word he meant to manifest the promise of the word in the age that you're living no matter how you know the word is true amen is going to contact you got to see it he's going to turn around you got to turn around you got to look at him you gotta shake his hand you got to feel his presence oh I say oh God this morning come in our church amen and look at us Lord let us fill your presence let us touch your hands let us feel your anointing we want to know you so we can hear you we can see you and we can declare you then you see all the things you've done amen when you know it's the truth then you're on the right road and it will always be scripture amen as long as brother Mass looking at the wall I cannot have Fellowship amen but when we come face to face when we come face to face we come in contact then we can have fellowship and John said this which we have seen heard declare we unto you amen that ye Also may have fellowship with us amen so they were declaring this to you so that you could come and to a Unity into a fellowship amen not just with him amen but truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ look at this word Fellowship it is Association it is a communion it is a joint participation Amen to share which one has anything amen and intimacy it's the right hand as a sign and a pledge of Fellowship amen I love this one brother Sean it is exhibiting amen and embodiment when you are fellowshipping you are exhibiting an embodiment and proof of Fellowship oh I feel like shouting amen what were they writing to you so that the god they were writing about amen could look you face to face and he could come into your soul he could come into your life and you could see him not as he was but as he is I love what the prophet says rich and mercy he said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy amen or a little girl you walk around there were certain things where it wouldn't bother other kids seemed like there was nothing in you or there was something in you rather that cried out he said that was God somewhere amen yet you were a sinner amen there was something in you oh god there was something in me wanting to talk to brother Matt there was something in me wanting to fellowship with him amen but I had not seen him he said now watch amen what was that that was the little form of life that was in you then then after a while you heard the gospel and maybe you went to church and picked this out and pick that out you went from denomination to the nomination but one day somebody shot one day amen but one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you come from and you know what was the truth see you are always the seed amen the seed was in you always listen amen amen when when the quickening power of the Holy Ghost came across that form of life on the inside of you sister Becky it was the Turning of God Amen from looking away from you Amen to looking at you Amen to a union a fellowship by the blood oh God he said the word sing the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world Amen saw the word and you come to it and then the word in you saw the word and you come to it in other words the reason we can't leave amen as we were called by the word oh I feel like shouting on that point we were not called by a preacher we were not called by a denomination we were not called by an association we were called by the word if if we're going to get run off the work's gonna have to do it amen cause we didn't come in by handshake amen so somebody not shaking our hand can't run us off we didn't come in by recognition in the church so somebody not recognizing Us in the church will not run us off we came in by the voice of God Amen to the revelation of Jesus Christ calling our name positionally placing us listen you say called by the word yes sir amen the written word this written word right here amen was the word that was looking for the word you say well that Bible wasn't in me you're exactly right this physical Bible of pink of paper and ink and leather it was not in you but there was a gene seed of God that was in you which the prophet said was the predestinated word so this written word begin to be preached and when that word begin to be oh God when it began to be preached that predestinated word on the inside of you said Mama that's me he's talking about me he's fellowshipping with me come on what was it it was the eagle amen coming back to Eagle amen it was seed coming back to seed then I say this morning church the only thing that will reveal you as an eagle is the message the only thing that will reveal you as a part of the word is the message the only thing that will reveal to you that you have a future in the middle of laodicea is this message then why wouldn't we declare this message then why wouldn't we declare what a prophet said it's the only thing that has the power Amen to break away the clouds to break away the doubt and to bring that seed on the inside of you I'm telling you Church you didn't claim this message this message claims you amen you did not claim Malachi 4 Malachi 4 claims you and then what are you saying I'm saying this we were claimed by the message well that's enough to shout on for an hour brother Kevin we were claimed by the message that's why John said this then is the message amen the life of God claiming you this then is the message which we have heard of him and we declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all amen listen to prophet he says the laodicean age is supposed to receive a message Malachi 4 said they would what house will you build me we as this group of people we have a message for this day and we Fellowship on that fault we're not looking for a message we have a message amen and we believe that God has given us a message so this message has not come from a man this message has come from God then if this message comes from God you know what it'll be it will be a scriptural message because the prophet of God said anyone knows everyone knows that God sends a sign if it's a supernatural sign he sends a message with that sign always does never fails we see things it's not signs of God he said well then it won't be nothing because God isn't in it but when God is in it a message is going to follow that amen and that message must be from the scripture amen it must be a scriptural message it must come thus saith the Lord amen when you see a sign amen if God is in that sign amen your reason your sin that sign is to get your attention because there's a message following the sign I'm only preached at the voice of the sign he said see this man but believe the voice I tell you why we had people ran off in left field amen and went from believing the sign to rejecting the sign it's because they did not obey what a prophet said he never put emphasis on just believing the sign he said you see the sign but you believe the voice and there's a bride here today amen that trouble cannot run her off amen failures cannot stop her situations cannot defeat her because she's not just following a sign amen but she's heard the voice and what the voice said amen she's seen the sign and she's declaring this is the Fulfillment of the life of God in this age to manifest rather Hallelujah then what are you talking about we have come to the saith the Lord we have come to Vindicated words he said we're living in a day where all kinds of things are strange isms that's unscriptural but you just remember as it was in the days of Noah he said you know people perhaps built boats in them days whether they were God constructed or not they didn't float when the time come for it to float he said so I like the message to be God constructed with the scriptures I like the message to be God constructed with the scriptures amen a scriptural message right there with it everything with the scripture amen then it's thus saith the Lord amen then and it's got to stand because it isn't my word that's in question it'll be his word that's in question amen bring it from the scripture amen don't bring it from an idea don't bring it from a tradition bring the message from the scripture it's okay this morning for a few moments I would like to tell you from the messenger the scriptural messenger sure amen what the message is I went through a study the other day amen in Israel in the church part five he said the message is ready so we now know the message is ready and he said the power of God is sufficient so the message is ready and the power of God is sufficient men and women are scared to break out yonder into those fears before God and there to trust him and take his word that's where you got to declare that the message is ready and the power is sufficient you've got to declare it before the people because there's a fear upon the church amen to break out in those Realms with God where all things are possible but listen friends the prophet has done been there and he's come back with a report that is real and we've got rights to go into it amen he said another place you don't come to church just to hear a message or to see a messenger you come to hear the message and the message is the holy spirit amen taking the word of God and giving it to you another place he said now if I understand the scripture right I believe that there's gifts that comes into the church that the Holy Spirit speaks and pronounces to his people the things he wants to do and therefore the people who spoke who's just in order after I got through speaking he said and now the message is to the people that he has already did the blessing for you it's for you to receive it amen the message is the blessing is already paid for now it's time for you to receive it amen what is the blessing amen this then is the blessing amen that the life of God has been manifested and Humanity can receive it in the power of his resurrection listen friends I think it's time to quit receiving every depressive thought I think it's time to quit receiving every negative spirit that comes floating through the atmosphere I think it's time to receive something of authority I think it's time to receive something of power I think it's time to receive something that'll break us out of these fears amen of Earthbound senses and a lift us up into the Sixth Sense where the Christian can dwell by the face of God manifesting to their flesh amen the message is the blessings for you you just got to receive it I love this from Brother Sean the message is to God's children the message is to God's children it's not to any certain organization amen but it's two God's children can I give you another one the message is to the believer the message is to the believer to them that perish its foolishness but to them that are in Christ and are part of that seed amen it is alive they say preacher why why this late in the game are you are you laboring so hard they meant to preach about this message because I heard what a prophet said he said the message is urgent amen why are we why are we hold meetings amen why are we traveling going to conventions and preaching in churches because the message is urgent and he said don't stop you keep going just keep moving we haven't got time for socials and parties and picnics amen and thinks this message is urgent it's got to get out amen listen and the only way it's going to get out is somebody amen will go see it if somebody will hear it and if somebody will declare it amen I admonish our preachers this morning amen declare this message well preacher I don't understand it declare it anyhow amen because I haven't been preaching along but I've been preaching long enough to know if you'll save your the prophet saying amen if you'll just stand there and saying amen the god that anointed him and inspired him and led him to say it amen will come into the church and you will feel the anointing of what a prophet said come into the building and you will actually receive a revelation of it are you hearing me because the message is urgent I love this one no one's at the end time he said see the messages on my heart so I must get it out amen that's my sole purpose regardless of what my wife says what my children says what my pastor says whatever says it's my Lord amen I must get that out amen amen I'm gonna preach a little bit now if that's okay I love this one brother Sam the message is right the message is ready the message is the blessing the message is urgent amen but now I'm going to say this the message is right can we say that together the message is right let's say it again the message is right he said because God sent the message and God sent the messenger no doubt ever gun in hell will be firing at him that's right amen he will stumble he will fall but he will get up and he will shake his head and he will go on see amen we got a message and nothing is going to stop it church and living God we got a message amen and nothing is going to stop it oh brother Sean we got a message amen and nothing is going to stop it you say well preacher what if they stop the messenger the problem of God said the Messenger will fall he will stumble but he'll get up and shake his head and he'll keep on declaring the message you say well brother Andrew I'm just a young person I'm just a young boy just a young girl amen I'm not a preacher you very well may be not be a preacher but you have got a message amen and the message is living in your flesh I don't care how many times you fall amen get up again and dust yourself off and shake your head and keep on living Keep On Believing keep on praying keep on shaking amen the message is right and if you'll just keep on declaring the message in your everyday life before long God will come on the scene and God will whip that devil and bring you a victory like you've never seen before but I gotta tell you you came back up and you can't get scared and you can't get timid when you make the mistake get up and dust yourself off and declare that God is a restorer God is a deliverer I'm not a crazy man I'm talking about a bride that's walking in flesh but she's declaring a message I'm on church amen I wish I had the ability to preach right now the life of God is in you

they can do what they want to the devil can rage and how but Jesus is raised from the dead and he lives today in us the life of First John 1 is living in the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody shot with me he lives he lives somebody raised hand and say he lives amen now let's bring it home he lives in us he lives in us the life of First John the message of first child is Jesus Christ and he's living in us I love what the prophet said in superson he said the message is amen revived again in the last days the message of who he is of what he is amen Emmanuel dwelling in us with the same works that he did manifest himself through you the very same things he did it's the evening lights it was spoke of in the Bible the message of the hour can I say it to you like this the message of the hour is the Revival the message of the hour is the Revival of the Supreme deity of God in the church I studied the other day and I about shouted out of the Hampton Inn amen down there ain't been the message of the hour is the Revival of the Supreme deity of God back in the church listen 2 000 years of Creeds and dogmas and traditions had buried it and killed it and laid it aside amen but in the end time the voice of the seventh angel which sold the entire seed of the word in the church which would bring the entire deity of God back in the church somebody shout the Supreme deity Supreme deity I love what the prophet says he said oh my how I like to preach that deity I like to preach the deity he said the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ if you could ever realize who he was and what he did for you men and women your hearts would Rin within you and you would be willing to throw away the trash of the world Amen to live for him if a life of First John ever come into your life by an experience of face-to-face contact you would be willing to throw away the trash now I might as well preach since I'm here some of you say well I ain't got no trash in my life I ain't got no cigarettes and alcohol I

which was which is to come the almighty do you know what brother bam calls Revelation 1 8 he calls it the Supreme deity right there is the Supreme deity I am Alpha and I am okay I am the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which he is past which was come on sorry which is present which was past which is to come future right there is Hebrews 13 8 right there is Jehovah of behold is the Jesus of the new right there is The Headstone right there is the Capstone right there is your identity right there is your husband right there is your father right there is your seed right oh God are you here in the church somebody declare it that I am in the supreme god and the supreme god is in me and what he did before he's going to do it again because he's the same yesterday today and forever and his word will never be defeated his message will never be stopped it'll March over every devil it'll March forever cancer because it's going to be declared oh I feel good this morning I am our fan Omega the first to last I love Brothers said watch this announcement not of the second party or the third party or anything he said the only party Revelation 1 8 is the announcement not of the second person or the third person sister Becky it's the announcement of the only person and his name is Jesus Christ amen I am both Alpha and Omega he said before I show you anything I want to live oh God brother Tim I love this he said before I show you anything I want to let you know who I am before I show you one Church age before I show you one symbol before I show you one thing I want you to know who I am see and said now watch he said the greatest of all the revelations is the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ and again in the past mission he said the first of all Revelations is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ are you ready for this you must know who he is when you hear the voice you must know who he is when you hear the voice you must know who he is when you hear the voice you say well how am I going to know who he is when I hear the voice because the seed in you is him is a part of him so when you heard the voice the voice in you recognize the voice in him and there was a union took place he said the same voice that sounded on Mount Sinai the same voice that sounded on Mount Transfiguration is the same one that is like the son of man in the Book of Revelation the first chapter then Church of the Living God if you are following the message of the hour you are following the same voice that was in the Garden of Eden you are following the same voice that was upon Mount Sania you are following the same voice that was on Mount Transfiguration you're following the same voice that was on Mount Sunset you're following the same voice that was on Mount Calvary come on turn that same voice is in the church this morning and it's sounding Out and somebody's going to declare it oh I love what Revelation 3 8 says it says I Know Thy Works amen I love this part behold I have set before thee an Open Door somebody say an open door not a closed door an open door and no man can shut it amen because thou has little strength and it's kept my word and has not denied my name can I can I lay this in for a minute an open door he said what was it it was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ not being a second person of the Trinity but being God himself made flesh and dwelling Among Us he said no man can shut that door are you ready for this so there's nobody could ever stop that message nobody could shut the door so the door is connected to the message he said nobody could stop that message of supreme deity and the baptism of in the name of Jesus Christ he said the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against him he revealed in the Church of age of Ephesus and he was the light that first broke through the shine the Christian light is that right the Holy Ghost age started there in Ephesus and the prophet said there would come a day there wouldn't be night or day but in the evening light would come back again you see amen this day of this will come across through there all this dismal organization and everything but in the last days over here way down here he would set that Open Door amen and Jesus said I am the open door amen so here in the end of the end of the end in the final closing moments of time the open door comes into this age and says I am the alpha and I am the Omega oh friends I I feel like I could stop right now I know I can't sing but I feel like I could amen down from his goal Glory I love what the prophet of God said about fans he said that song expresses amen the Supreme deity when they're trying to make him a man when they're trying to just make him a prophet or just some little figment of our imagination amen there's a song that says down from his glory amen came My Savior amen he came down why did he come down he come down to become me he come down to save me he come down to heal me he come down to redeem me he come down to free me he come down to restore me he come down to lift me listen I was already down I couldn't get up but he was already up and the only way I could get up was he come down and because he came down there was a word seed in my soul that connected to the voice of the Redeemer and I can sin this morning and I can cry holy and worthy and glory and honor because I'm declaring what he done for me when nobody else could do it brother Doug he came down he came down and saved me he came down and redeemed me he came down oh God you say preacher what are you getting can you give me Revelation 10 1. amen amen what do you get at I'll tell you what I'm getting at I'm getting that for Supreme deity it's not in heaven it's an Earth this morning and I saw what another Mighty Angel come up no another Mighty Angel come down from where from Heaven clothe with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was at where the sun and his feet his pillars of fire do you realize right there is the head and the body in one verse but what come down was the head you know why because the body was on the Earth showing you whatever was in the head brother Samaya is going to come into the body and they're going to manifest the body is going to manifest the life of the head brother Tim you got one life today you don't have two three four five you don't have five different lives flowing through you you've got one life and you got one body you got one head you got two feet you got you got ten fingers are you here you're a body but you got one head and where is life amen life is in the head and it's flowing to the body listen and whatever life is in the head when it comes into the member of the body listen whether you're the hand whether you're the toe whether you're the ankle whether you're the leg amen it's the same life in oh God it's the same life in every member though the member might not be as big as the other member or might not be as seen as the other member but you're manifesting the same life oh God I wish I could preach this morning you're manifesting the same life that's why the prophet said amen that the weakest of Christians going down to their knees amen causes hell to tremble how could he say that amen because the life that was in the head is in the weakest member of the body tonight and you got a rock this morning by the life of Jesus

already in your tomorrow are you ready for this but message is God Amen pouring his own life into us are you hearing me the Bible says or the prophet of God says listen Blasphemous names he said in this church age he said the message is being poured somebody say poured it's being poured into the church see this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there is no such a thing see he said no individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost not the church and body of groups see therefore it runs out but what this man now watch this man who was pouring the water are you ready for this amen put your seat belt on the messenger of the church amen pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing are you ready for this it was boiling out all the trash amen seven Church ages seven Messengers pouring a message in that age what was it doing brother Daniel it was water and it was bullying all the trash out of that age he said that's what the Holy Spirit does it Bulls it up and out the Holy Spirit pours into the church I know what I'm talking about right now because I I'm fighting against Devils to preachers but I'm not giving up so help me amen the message is being poured in the church right now and I know what it's doing it's bullying right now amen I've been preaching long enough to know this brother Kevin the Holy Ghost right now is pulling all that trash he's mad cause he's being exposed he's mad because the Liberty's in the house of God he's mad because the anointing is resting upon the people and all the trash amen is boiling up together amen you know what we're fishing to do we're fixing to fool it out amen so the message can take the preeminence in our lives and we can declare that God is still a sanctifier glory to God somebody shot bullet out Lord somebody shout bullet out Lord amen somebody shall pour your word in me oh God and pull all the trash out I'm I'm trying to help you right now amen open up My Heart Lord and pour this message in open up my family Lord and pour this message in open up my home Lord and pour this message in open up her church oh God and pull her this message in until for ounce of trash every ounce of unbelief and skepticism and criticism and negativity and film is bull out and the declaring of the message of the hour takes position in our lives bullet out Lord pull it out Lord wash Us by the water of the word Lord oh sanctifies cleanse us Lord among church I know what I'm talking about we need to wash them this morning we need to wash them this morning we need to wash them this morning I'm not a crazy man I'm a preacher of the Gospel we need a washing this morning we need to let the word amen watch our lives it ain't over till God says it's over come on Church remember then I made a mistake well get up and shake your head and left a message to the hour be poured into you well but later I'm sick open up your heart and left a message of the hour be poured into you well brother Andrew I'm bound open up your heart listen friends I'm not for Messenger the Holy Ghost is the messenger I'm not the prophet the Holy Ghost is the Prophet come on the Earthly messenger is gone amen by the Heavenly messenger is right here in this building this morning and he's still a picture sister hope he's still a fixer brother Terry he's still a fixer listen y'all got the wrong preacher up here this morning to believe God can't fix things just this week I've seen God Amen come on the scene unorchestrated unput together and fix some situations you say what are you talking about amen I'm not going to get too open I'm going to say this amen before he walked out of the back room down there and that meeting Friday night brother Joe said brother Ron he said let's all pray he said we need the Holy Ghost to move Sister Sister something just come over me we got done praying I said brother Joel if Jesus can't fix it can't nobody fix it that's an old song in Jesus he fix it can't nobody do it amen amen went out there in that meeting without the headship of some bishop or the headship of some men trying to amen but I'll watch the Holy Ghost come in and begin to fix one situation and fix another situation you know why amen because my God is still a fixing man he'll fix your home he'll fix your marriage I know some of y'all right now thinking your testimony is gone but he'll fix your testimony because he's a fixer he's a holy ghost picture he's a God that can fix this situation he can fix your babies he can fix your marriage he can fix your job he can fix your school he can fix everything about you because he's stealing the fixing business and the only thing that's going to fix it is the preaching of the message of the hour as the Supreme deity over every situation in humanity brother Tim this message is supreme deity over every Humanity over every situation in your flesh this message is the fixture that's what the prophet of God said can I have a few more minutes he said the church needs a washing the church needs a washing he said a Full Gospel Washington not just a part washing but a Full Gospel Washington now y'all may not like this but let me preach I'm saying oh God bring back our services where we didn't just look for a shout we look for a washing come on church I've seen a lot of people shout didn't get washed and y'all know don't start pushing I know I believe in shouting I believe in dancing but I've seen a lot of dancing didn't get washed and you know what a couple years later you go back and they ain't dancing they ain't shouting cause they didn't get a washing but I've seen some folks get a washing and go back 10 years later and they're still shouting you know why because they got a washing you know what we need to do we need to get a washing you want to shout that the devil won't take out get a washing you want to shout that trouble won't take out get a wash and I say oh God bring a shout of worship and correction and word into the church and wash us again oh God until there's a liberty comes in the building listen amen I know I know I know people say well brother Andrew you're getting away from the word well actually if you study the word the prophet connects the washing of the water to the blood you know what he said he said the word bled for you you are washed in the bleeding word he said the life of God the life of God in the word first John 1 the life we seen the life we heard that life has been manifested that life in the word bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutions come on church he said the filth of these prostitutes and be cleansed and Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and make your mind and heart stayed on God and His word for they say that's why this shout last is when the Mind sister Kimberly and the Soul has been washed by the word it brings an anchor of faith into that soul that nothing will shift it away amen what are you getting that preacher let me say this plain as I know how amen pour the message into the church can I say this amen I'm declaring what I believe without fear pour the message in the church and it'll wash the trash out brother Tim pour the message in the church and he don't wash the trash out you say preacher you're getting pretty strong on that yeah I am you know why because we got a lot of situations y'all agree with me we got a lot and we're living in a day in time who would ever thought brother Terry in this message would have so many directions one this way one that way go this way amen amen oh god well I might as well could I have some Liberty amen amen amen preach it this way no preach it this way no act like this no amen and there's all kinds of things and before long it starts accumulating and it starts heaping up and then divisions start coming and then and then Fellowship starts getting broken and then brother starts separating in churches oh God Amen and all this confusion and then five years down the road people sitting around you know what they're saying brother Sean how we gonna fix this how we gonna fix this and I found the clothes the other day and I might just preaching for the next six months it's a prophet to answer the question how are we going to fix this you know what he said he said the message is the correcting well that's enough to shout your shoe heels off amen the message is amen the message is the correcting so what are you saying I'm saying how are we going to fix it we're going to preach the message thank you well Glory Glory Glory I feel good this morning how are we going to change are we going to preach the message how are we going how we going to get everybody on the same page we're going to preach the message I am not going to reduce this message down to a bunch of preachers sitting around trying to discern and decided ID in the direction I'm going to say what a prophet said and wherever God gives me the grace to hold a microphone I'm going to preach this message you know what I'm going to do I'm going to lay in these words I'm going to lay in these tapes and every message church I get to preach in I'm going to preach the message and I'm going to stand back and let the message fix situations fix divisions fix confusion come on church if the message can't fix a division it ain't going to change your body but if this message is going to change your body brother will you better believe this caught enough power Amen to bring every direction back to the center of the road the message of the hour and let the message become the god oh Hallelujah the message is the correcting that's what you need to put in your books the message is the correcting you say preacher why do you say the message the message is the correcting amen a man can't stand the scripture correction he gets all angry and blows up it shows he's not right with God Amen but a genuine saint of God will be reconciled to God by the word see that's why if you just preach the message it'll bring a balance to emotion that's life come on church if you just preach the message it'll bring a balance amen hey come on it'll bring a balance to the gifts it'll bring a balance to it if you just preach the message it has the power to bring the balance but if you don't declare it then there's nothing else to fix it so it becomes a bunch of Babylonian confusion of dictators fussing and fine oh God I might as well preach amen and pulpits no longer a Pulpit they become War zones they become they become places of war to fight somebody else I'm just going to preach okay but I'm going to say this amen we are message Believers and you know what I think it's time to do I think it's time to turn our guns from one another and point them back if the devil and kill that devil unless the people get some Liberty I know what oh no amen I feel that Spirit pushing at me we've done been down these roach are you hearing me we've been through two Souls we've been through return we've been through here I stand we've been through seven Thunders we've been through all these things and you know what we've had more casualties of people laying on the ground Dead from the crossfire than we did Devils but if we would turn our guns back to the devil and get a gun and come on church amen come on Church get a gun in your hand well I'm just a I'm just a little nobody but you're a member of this message and this message is the correcting amen get a gun in your hand and shoot that devil down Oh Come I'll come I'll tell you one thing it affects a lot of confusion in churches if some fathers will be fathers again if they'd be fathers again and teach the message at home the kids wouldn't can be confused in the churches well preach brother Andrew thank you I believe I will are you hearing me amen and if mothers would be mothers again amen and leave them babies in the fear and admonition of God and quit trying to make Hollywood stars out of them there wouldn't be so much confusion you say well what's going to fix it the message of the hour is going to fix it that's why you better play them tapes that's why you better turn on them books that's why you better get some prayer you better get some anointing because there's nothing going to fix it but for message well Belinda I don't have a microphone and a Pulpit in my home but you got the tapes and you can gather your little family together and you can pour that message into him you can say we're not going to dress like the world we're not going to follow the trends of laodice come on you know what else you can say you can say we're not going to Bow our knee to the pressures around the message we are going to be a message believing family because our purpose only Earth is to declare this word now he genuine right now my people say well you can't you can't Strike Back well if you're amongst believer as you can and before you judge that statement I'll read you the quote he said the genuine saint of God will be reconciled to God by the word I'm I'm hurrying but I'm gonna finish this so what is the message the message is the correcting and a genuine saint of God can take the correction he says what is the message 1964 to bring back the word brother Maurice bring back the word watch this bring the people back to the word now don't get mad at me but the pulpit's not the place for personal convictions all right the pulpit is the place for the word but because I'm gonna get in trouble sure the world but because personal convictions invaded the pulpit guy's got too lazy to study so it's a lot easier just to get up and hold a microphone and just preach their personal convictions and that's why we had churches divided on open-toed shoes and Die in Your Hair what kind y'all know I'm telling you the truth it's in the message amen and so guys didn't say the message so they got up blasted hair dye and then when somebody brought in the cult where a prophet had rested they held onto their personal conviction because they thought they were more spiritual than the prophet and you've had divisions for years but just preach the message the message will fix it amen amen so much how are we going to get makeup out of the church Preach the message somebody say how are we going to get the skirts longer preach the message how are we going to get shorts off of boys preach them y'all know I'm telling you the truth amen legalistic Devils harder than been fired 10 years ago it's time to preach the message and it left a message fix the dress that's a Mexican that's a message fix the face come on sir have we got so powered down if the message can change our body but it can't change the clothes we're wearing have we got so late have we got so weak that we preach where the message can do anything but it cannot fix the situation listen I'll lay before this message and I'll preach with everything within me you know why because I know it'll fix it I am a witness that's a message every hour we'll fix the situation if you'll just preach it if you'll just preach it if you'll just preach it I'm gonna end this is if you'll just believe it if you'll just believe it it'll fix it well brother Andrew I don't know how I got here but I'm here should we have televisions or should we not so we had some guy that wanted to go so far in law and we had some guy want to go so far in Grace instead of just saying what a prophet said yeah so they went so far in grace to say well if you got a cell phone you can have a television and they went so far in law well if for television you got a computer and you got a computer where you're not even a ride member and you're going hey well just say what a prophet said you know what he said he said I wouldn't have one in my home sandals had enough for me I may be you may not want me to preach tonight are you hearing me just preach the message so now we're not arguing says okay now we're not arguing over the rest now we're arguing over emotion we'll just preach the message because if you'll say what the prophet said it'll bring about you so you got one guy over here well bless God we don't want no bubble dance or no moving to the Holy Ghost okay you got quotes for that but then you got other coaches says I'd rather have a wildfire than on fire at all so then you've got guys over here with host clubs and then you got Wars going on and you got people going to meetings and they don't know how to react because we're under so many but what if we would lay aside our personality and we would lay aside our ideas and we would humble ourselves and lift up the seventh Angels message again it had fixed the division it would fix the confusion they said I'm moving on from this point but I'm going to say this as for me and my house we're going to serve the word as for me and my family we're going to lay in these tapes we're going to preach this message I'm going to preach it somebody's going to believe it I refuse to get bowed down and countered down in a bunch of fussing and fighting listen we got young people on their way out the door while we're facing over this and fussing over that I say lay down the swords against each other and pick up the sword of the Lord and fight that devil down until we restore our young people until we restore our churches bring them back to the word you know why because the word corrects the error the word corrects the error hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error listen father God said Airway shows or definition error which shows yourself an action a wrong mode of acting error which leads in the air into further error this Seton fraud can I tell you this you're never going to fix error by studying error okay it's an error brother Shabbat if you're trying to get red paint off a wall you're not going to cover it up by putting more red paint on it it's directions probably God said there's a grocery today on the godhead but you know what corrected item didn't go steady and lay out there and all them denominations and study their errors and fellowship with them he preached the word and the word correct to the error you know why and I'm going to tie this together you know why because Jesus knew he was the word so when you know who you are you can boldly declare who you are and not be ashamed to do so Jesus himself when he came he knew he was the words he he was pause to that he would can I give you something here this morning can I give you something you say well preacher you're talking about laying down the source for the pulpit now let's lay him down in the pews oh yeah is that okay let's lay them down in our meetings see he was positive for that he was just 12 years old we found him in the temple debating with the Priestess his knowledge could surpass her traditions and he was teaching him and his own mother come to him and said a word that was wrong he said now watch the word correct the air the word always corrects the error and if the people can only see today the word corrects the air the whole thing and I watch a prophet the whole thing is becoming there but God's word is what is right see Heaven Earth will pass away but my word shall not and though are you ready for this the word that is prophesied for this day is what corrects the error of the day so not the word of Luther or the word of Wesley or the word of Pentecost or the word of Spurgeon or the word of pink or the word of hint the word prophesied of this day corrects the air see the word itself now watch and the word comes back and corrects that error are you ready by identifying itself the hour and the time of the hour this is bright time this is bright hour this is bright age see and now he said not dishonor you Catholic people they call Mary the Mother of God but let me just show you an error Jesus was told by Mary your father and I have been looking for you and you know what he's saying know ye not that I must be about my father's business watch the word correct the air he said now you know what 12 year old boy wouldn't do that he was the word he was the spoken word of that age so therefore the identified characteristic of God was in Christ and he corrected the Earth listen Church Christ was in a 12 year old boy and he corrected the heir and said I must be about my father's business listen everybody this is the word always corrects the air are you ready for this by identifying God among them so if you'll just preach the message the message will bring God in the midst and God will identify himself another place he said let's go back just a minute now and identify what Jesus was on Earth and we'll find out what he was then what he's been in the other ages he'll have to be the same thing in this age to make it right now what are you saying preacher I'm saying the message is right saying the message is the correcting and Jesus said this and I'll be done he said if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed I love this one Sister Kim and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the life was manifested we've seen it we heard it now all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church whether you stand with Andrew I'm saying truth is the word says this is our musicians come he said now he said I don't come as a fanatic I do not believe in fanaticism I wouldn't stand for that I know you don't believe in phoneticism you believe in the truth are you ready for this and truth will always speak for itself Russia my truth got its own voice it can speak he said that's right are you ready for this you never have to strain the truth Oh Glory that's why you just preached the message you never have to strain it you just preach it truth will always be right he said now here I am I won't hurt you I don't want to shake your jerk the hide from you for I wish to preach the truth that's the wrong thing brother the truth will never make you popular truth will never make you popular but the truth will make it honest and well hadn't you rather be honest [Music] than popular [Music] wouldn't you rather be honest than popular [Music] I know I would Sister Kim I'd rather be honest than popular then I can just keep on preaching the message to 5 or 50 or 500 or two the truth the truth is here it's time to declare it it's time to declare once you stand to your feet with us this morning [Music] it's time to declare it it's time to declare it you see this this evening this morning rather see me I was thinking if you don't close it's going to be evening [Music] but I've seen it and I've heard it and the only thing I can do is declare it it's brought me it's brought me through a lot it's got me through a lot of lonely nights it's got me through a lot of battles it's got me out of a lot of valleys brother Sean because it's the truth and it's always the same it's always the same see if you pour feelings in the church they're going to change they gonna change let them I was in the barbershop the other day yeah I still got some up there to cut it's getting thin but it's still there it's in the barbershop the other day and there was a grandmother and her daughter brought her brought her son and Grandson in and they were sitting there a junior and that boy I mean he was he's about ready he's about ready to tear that barber shop down he is climbing on stuff screaming hot well the mom was just kind of sitting there laughing looking at a magazine flipping through her phone when I and all of a sudden that girl all there but she got up she went over she jerked that boy's arm she brought him over she set him down she took her hand and laid into his leg and said now sit there and behave yourself he said act like you got some sins [Music] I turned around I said whoa brother my barber cut my hair he said thank God there's some more grandmothers like that still on the Earth you know what that boy done he sit there she was hoping he's going [Music] she got back up I thought oh dear God she walked over she said dried up she said you ain't hurt your feelings are you know what when they got done he hugged her and they walked out together foreign hurt his feelings were that's why I'm gonna preach this message might hurt your feelings but it's going to change your body [Applause] so my brother Sean's gonna keep preaching this message might hurt your feelings might get a little man [Music] what's all said and done Sean we're gonna walk over and Shake Your Hand we're gonna stand before the throne and say thank you for telling us the truth [Music] and pour this message in it's gonna get us out of here how many degrees is time to declare it time left a message bring the correction man's tried and failed they've tried and failed tried to correct this Doctrine tried to correct that I'm not listen I'm you say who after I'm after the devil if we'll just preach the message let the message bring the correcting the word always corrects the error and I'll say it to you like this wherever you are you're in the same position as Jesus was in the temple you say me it wasn't his flesh that corrected the air it's what had been poured into him all that was in God he poured into Christ and brother Birmingham said the identifying characteristics sister Alice in Jesus was Christ and correct there he said and it'll do it today so if you'll let the word pour into you all that was in Christ he'll pour in the church in your life your life your testimony will correct the error you believe it today how many can say I'm ready to declare this life I'm ready to declare this message I'm ready to declare it in my life declare it in my home how many can say I go home today and I take every spirit in my house under control of the Holy Spirit to declare this word you go to work tomorrow take every spirit in that building under your

poured into the church won't you buy your hearts with us this morning Hallelujah how many can say today Lord I hear your voice I hear that life speaking today I hear it speaking in my heart [Music] how many can say Lord it might have hurt my feelings it's going to change my body maybe you come to servicing brother Sean's correcting something might hurt your feelings but it's going to change your body I know I know it's almost getting where people don't want to hear them kind of sermons correction anymore but friends if we're gonna preach the message we're going to preach the blessings and the
