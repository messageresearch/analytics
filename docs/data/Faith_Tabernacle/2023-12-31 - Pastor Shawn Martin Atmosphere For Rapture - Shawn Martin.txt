yes yes yes aren't you thankful that you can come into His presence and enjoy the the presence of the Lord and to be changed and listen to brother brandham um sometime this morning and and um he's talking about you know the the the rod of Aaron he said that represented the the center how we were all cut off from the life of God but then we were able to come into His presence amen and as that Rod began to Bud it didn't Bud bring forth anything than what it was in its original state and I thought you know how wonderful that is is when the presence of God we come into the presence of God we don't bring forth anything else but what God originally predestinated us to be and what a change that is from this old life it's it's truly a change and I'm so glad for that you love the Lord the musicians can be dismissed amen and uh um it's uh just good to have everyone in the house of the Lord and and um good to have sister Martha back amen with us and um uh glad she's recovering and and um uh we want to just continue to remember um sister Hannah and and brother Bob and U maybe there's others that are sick that I don't know about but um good to see sister um um um horn Alice amen good to have you back am man and uh that she's recovering and the sickness just going around everywhere and uh you know i' I've been fighting this uh I don't know what it is but um uh just anyways anyway but we're here uh pressing the battle and um brother Andrew asked me to to greet you all and he's ministering there brother Wayne's today and uh brother Amos and sister Lisa I believe are in Pennsylvania with family and so we um want to just remember them that the Lord give them safe travels back home and um praise the Lord uh you can be seated for just a moment I was planning to have service tonight um uh but I I had heard to the great B that brother Darren kener is going to be having a watch service tonight and uh I'm not sure if anyone else or any other churches I haven't really uh talked to anyone uh as far as if they're having watch night services we usually uh brother Charlie had them or brother Roy and so we would just go over there and uh participate uh support theirs so uh if you know of uh a service that someone is having um a watch Night Service and you want to be part of that and uh I'm sure uh they would appreciate you uh coming and uh uh there and and being part of that also I I want to to say that I appreciate um all those who have labored over the weekend uh to to to make this a change I'm sure it was a surprise to to you uh there but we trust that you like it and uh uh we uh it's been a few months back that um the trustees had talked to me about uh needing a nursery another Nursery we just ain't got a lot of room in the back and um we've got uh uh different ones uh you know children being born and uh so we've been needing to get something you know done so we weren't using the tape room in the back uh anymore so we had talked about uh changing all that there and uh so that we'd have a little bit more room uh for the the nursery and um of course that's been a few months back and hadn't just been setting and a lot of that was just because we didn't have the the funds uh to really uh to do what we wanted to do and so uh my daughter uh she told me she said Dad I'll I'll I'll pay to get all this done if if we needed to do it and uh so uh she bought some paint and began to do it and I uh do some painting and kind of clearing things out and um then the boys uh brother Josiah brother Daniel and brother Junior uh they said well we'll we'll pit you in and so uh I think they got him a door from Brother Sam I think and um they found some tile downstairs that we had left over uh that we'd use downstairs that flooring and so they began to put everything together brother Josiah bought all the lights uh here for the church and U I think they really look nice and um so uh they they they moved the door and they got all that together and and um uh so then they uh they heard me announce to you all that would' be that I'm wanting to do some changing and um so uh everyone pitched in um and uh Wednesday night after church we decided to uh to do some repay and and uh just a little bit of change and so anyways I certainly appreciate them uh doing that not just spending money because I think we've all uh they all spent put some money into it but they've also put their labor in time and uh so we certainly appreciate that and I I I do want to say that I again uh you as a church you all have uh uh been so willing and and have showed such a um a desire to uh to carry on I and I I'd say my my vision I feel like the Lord has given me uh even with our spring meetings and um we started out you know here at the church and um uh from the from the GetGo um uh you were willing to um help feed and and things like that and and uh then we just we just outgrew it we were putting people in the basement during our meetings and so the Lord just opened it up a way and brother John Sister Kim uh you know mentioned about Camp Christie and and that has opened up and you know we've now we've just uh wow you know we've really grown in in the meetings and I I think we had over a thousand people uh this past meeting in uh the Saturday night service and who would have ever thought that that we would be there I that's never what I in you know uh looked for we just I've always just had a desire a burden to bring people in fellowship and then to feed them as they came and uh just uh I I felt it to me it was just a small way of letting them know that we appreciate them for coming and and uh just something to do for the bride of Christ and um but but you have you know you have been willing to to participate and to help and and even as we have uh uh gotten um have have grown in in these things and uh you know uh God has given a lot of you the the the ability the knowhow the and the willingness uh to to want to carry this out and I I I want to say I thank you so much well I first come here uh which I guess was about 12 years ago um you know brother Mark and Brother Sam uh they they were the the big um main ones that done a lot of work around here uh man I I remember them both spending hours brother Mark used to uh he was in the closet there and we got him out of there and uh just a little old board uh sound board now we got one you know big and brother Mark uh put so much effort I mean kept that thing uh just SP and span so orderly and I hope these guys are doing the same continuing with that and uh but but a lot of times they they spent uh hours uh here during the night uh you know I they they work late late night sometimes and um and God has has blessed us with young men that are rising up that carry that same desire and um I certainly appreciate that appreciate just everyone just just God knows what he's doing and if he wants something to stay alive he'll keep it alive and he'll keep he'll keep people uh you know bring the help as we need them and things but I I certainly appreciate all the the labor and you know when we um um um when I first started doing the meetings here in January which is coming up next week um you know my goal was is to just to for our church we didn't even announce it for the first several years then people would hear about it and ask why they weren't invited or ask can they come things like that but my goal was is just for the church to where we wouldn't have to uh no no cooking no nothing like that you just come enjoy it and then we would and you know we have tried to keep that just because I want you all to enjoy uh en enjoy yourself here at the meeting but you know what it just it again it just goes to show uh that it's really in the heart of the people and and the type of people that we do have here at the church um you know again I've always I'm I I've always liked Fellowship I've I've always you know but again I've been pretty ridiculed pretty hard for put in meeting uh cooking after you know us cooking and uh one told his congregation you know that it's a shame that a pastor would do that and but I've I've never and he was referring to us but I've never um I've never tried to demand that to be I've always just if you don't want to do it then don't do it if you do want to then we'd love to have you but I um Brother Sam I think it was last year opened his his uh the barn up for for the visitors uh to come and and and and people just so appreciated it you know and even though I you know uh my my goal was not to do any of that but yet cuz I didn't want you all to feel burdened to do it like you had to do it or that I was asking or expecting you all to do it but and I appreciate Brother Sam opening that just shows brother Sam's heart to to want to just help people and that's just been Brother Sam all through the years that I've known him is to want to help people and um and then you know uh a couple sisters um you know uh you know and I hope it's okay to mention your name but sister hope uh you know ask well can we do that again this year you know and um and uh so you know I of course I made it just very clear now you don't have to do this don't feel obligated this is just you know cuz I've already put it on the flly no food we ain't cooking but uh but then I I tell you know but I told her you know if if that is something that you all want to do then you know who am I to tell you not to do it uh cuz I always know it's going to be a blessing you know uh to those that do come and um so again I I I want to thank just all of you all for for your support what you know just just coming to the house of the Lord and being a part in that way or what whatever you know you God has called you to do thank you thank you so much um because you know um I um you know I just well just thank you so much you know God God knows what we need and he sends the right people along and um I think we all got a part in this um and uh sure wouldn't be uh preaching to pews wouldn't be a good way to do it huh that'd really be discouraging uh so God brings the people but also people that want to help people that want to put their labor in in any in in any way and uh so God bless you very much and if it's just just coming to the church coming to the house of God saying Amen to the word uh that that that is so much you you everyone has their part in in this thing and so God bless you very much and looking forward to the meetings that are coming uh I guess it' be next week Monday next Monday and um looking for what God's got in store uh for us all and um I'm believing God's going to do great things amen and so um if you'd like to stand with me we're going to to read here in first Thessalonians the um the fourth chapter it's a it's a scripture that we we're very familiar with and we'll start at the 13th verse 1 Thessalonians 4 and 13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen let's just bow our heads we talk to our Lord father truly we are honored that you would bid us to come today to your house to meet with you father we realize that we're not just a normal Gathering that Lord we it's a gathering of your children your redeemed your elect father Lord and you thought of us Lord more valuable than your own blood and oh God as we sit here under great anticipation Lord for you to speak to us I pray that you would just anoint us all help me to get myself out of the way and Lord may you be able to speak through me Father anoint the gift that you placed in my life Lord and anoint that word seed within each and every heart Lord father we give this service now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen you can have your seats you know we're at the closing of another year time is just rapidly wow rapidly uh uh passing uh brother Ward uh text me in the office and he's he's up there preaching for brother Mike walls today and but he said you know it's been 18 years uh he said I remembered just sitting here been 18 years uh New Year's Eve that he was preaching a meeting here I guess and got a called that his mom was passing so he left the meeting and and um his mom had already passed the time he got there but you know he said how time just goes and that's true time just just flies and who who would have ever thought that we'd be here at 20 facing 2024 but it it it it just just time goes and uh but with with that each closing year here it brings us closer to the coming of the Lord it brings us closer to the Rapture and of course we know the word rapture is is to be caught up it that that's what it is and brother brandham was very clear that there is going to be a Rapture and uh he taught that in the message the Rapture uh 65 uh brother brandham said all Christians uh believe that there will be a r Rapture so all Christians if you're a Christian you're going to believe that there's going to be a Rapture and he said how many in here believes at the Bible teaches there will be a Rapture of the church he said yes sir that's right exactly a catching away of the church he said this Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride remember the Bible says and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years see this great rapture if there's not a Rapture friends then where are we at where what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have but there is going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be and it'll only be for the elected the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church ain't that right now he preached that um after he preached that message the Raptor he had four more sermons to preach uh before the Lord took him home and so he preached the Rapture then the next night he preached on the subject things that are to be and he said now speaking last night on The Rapture so tonight I want to speak on this subject that we might I might tie it together with last night's message now there's going to be a rapture we know that that's in the future to be now Jesus is here speaking about he's gone ahead to prepare a place for us and that's important he's tying that that scripture to the Rapture he's gone to prepare a place for us and then on down he in that sermon the things that are to be he says now he Jesus said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose and I'm going away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also so that's what this Rapture is about is that where he is that we could be there with him also and it's it's not that we're going to see Jesus as a as a Halo there I believe we're going to see him in his physical body amen I know some teach that that that body is done away with but that's not true amen uh it's it's a glorified body it's an eternal body and if it's an eternal body and and you say well how do you know that because the Bible says that our bodies will change like un his own glorious body so so there is no corruption with his body and there will be no corruption with our body and so we're not going to see a Halo We're going to see him in his body and he says I go away I'm going away to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be there also see so Jesus is telling his disciples that this life is not ended in death amen see he says because I go and prepare a place see that is to receive them see shows that there uh he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life is ended and and and and and we we we know by our scripture reading that this life is not only ending uh when you die amen but there is going to be a people that will never die and this life will end for them and they will enter into another life can you amen so after this life is over there is a life that we go into so as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you see every year it it should becoming a more of a reality to us that there is another life there this life cannot continue I thinking of uh uh my my wife you know she was doing stuff on the floor and uh last night and and she was there for a while and and uh uh uh you know maybe had had her legs crossed or whatever and set in Indian style as we would say that and and uh but I had to help her up she say I'm just getting too old I you know I can't do this much more you know and I'm thinking old you know uh but but you know it just tells us that life life is is we we start feeling things that maybe we didn't feel and experiencing things that we didn't feel when we were 15 16 18 years old you don't understand what I'm saying and and so then it lets us know that that we we start looking after for another life what what's going to happen to us you know what I'm saying and and and you know I that's becoming more clear to me or more of a thought is is I ain't got much time left uh you know it could be an accident it could be some you know it could be a health problem it could be just whatever but but if all of us really think about it there's no age limit amen that God takes people home and and when you're number called that's it ain't that right so every day we should be thinking of that life thereafter and and uh the the life thereafter you can have plans but uh uh in this life and them plans can just stop automatically and and be totally uh uh uh uh you know disrupted but he says see you begin to uh as you begin to see your your days uh your life see drawing close then you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event it's a continuing of this same life in another world another place can you say Amen so you'll be in a body and and and and but you'll be in another world it's it's another place that's what the Rapture is about so so he he talks that in in in in the things that are to be but the next n uh uh uh uh brother Brandon preached on the subject modern events are made clear by prophecy and and you ought to go listen to the five sermons uh back to back just uh uh he's getting ready to leave and and and in them sermons he preaches Jean seed he mentions that more than he ever did in in any other tape uh uh uh of his of his life is Jean seeds and and he's he's preparing the people he's telling us there's something else he's got something to say in other words you know and so he preaches modern events made clear by prophecy he says we're not living in a Pentecostal AG we're living in another age we're not living in a Methodist age we're not living He said we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bright age the calling out of the church and and if if I'm not mistaken he mentions bright age more in them five sermons than he ever did in in in in the uh his other time uh we're living up here to the bride age the calling out of the church getting it together for the rapture that's the age we're now living getting get ready for the Rapture so he has come to understand his purpose and his uh uh for his ministry of being on this Earth and he's telling us now amen and and if I could say it this way amen it it it his he didn't want us get caught up in in in in in making Souvenirs of his suitcase and his belt buckle and his whatever and and and then we've arrived because our children now have all of these things and and and who cares about a belt buckle that he had and who care you know I and and don't get me wrong I I I love going and visiting the places that he was at and and them things but but that doesn't that that's fine but but that's not why he came so that I could go and touch his Tombstone and I could touch this and and and take some dirt home and and all that that that has no bearing amen but because he come to get us together for a Rapture amen this thing is winding up this thing is coming to a close can you sayen so the Rapture isn't a a a a metaphor a figure of speech it's a it's a real happening see Jesus said in John 5 and2 the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live amen see the hour is coming and and now is that the dead is going to hear the voice of the Lord amen see well when he died and he rose again there was the the Old Testament saints that had waited upon Him believed upon him they rose with him amen see amen they heard the voice amen but here we are we're in a generation amen and that was just the dead amen but look at all the saints that that the disciples that followed him and they were never changed amen they just continued on in the natural life but in this age the cycle of Life of this mortality is going to be broken and not only the dead is going to raise but those that are alive and remaining are going to be changed and caught up to meet the Lord in the air amen see so uh the dead is going to hear the voice of the Lord a Son of God and shall live uh uh so so that's at the time of rapture amen see and and so it's going to break the cycle of death and corruption that's what the Rapture is about breaking the death of the cycle of death and Corruption and it's not just for one man amen not just for one man but it's for All Peoples of every out of every tongue and tribe and nation and Kindred ain't that right amen not just for Israel amen but out of every every tribe Kindred tongue and Nation there is going to be a Rapture that is going to take place it could be out in the very jungles where they don't know their ABCs but they'll be caught up with us Amen to meet the Lord in the air amen see so now one might think I I I had a brother tell me you know uh a couple years ago that that the Rapture is not a literal thing uh but it is actually being caught up in Revelation amen that that's what the Rapture is is being caught up but brother brandham didn't teach that at all now now uh uh now now notice brother Brown did say this he said to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her amen see the Rapture is a revelation it's revealed to her see that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture see now we've already got that revelation of the Rapture amen but now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith Can you say Amen you cannot have a revelation without it being Faith see faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you ain't that right so so the Revelation gives Faith to the bride in order for her to be taken up ain't that right so the Revelation has got to come to you the revelation of this Rapture has got to come you amen see so brother brandom says see he says I want you to get built up now in these holy Oracles of God in the faith everybody say in the faith then he says the faith of this hour not the faith of Methodist not the faith of of of of the Pentecostals not the faith of Baptist not the faith of Lutheran and all that the faith of this hour can you say amen amen see so he says see it's going to take more faith a greater Faith than ever was in any age that's why you don't need to listen to theology amen those that don't they could be great speakers they could be great theologians philosophers and all of that but there's got to give a faith for this hour can you say amen and if God is going to require a greater Faith than ever before then surely he's going to give it to us surely he's going to provide some way that you can have that Faith so it's going to take more faith than it ever was in any age for this this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up ain't that right see so the Revelation comes before the Rapture the revelation of the Rapture comes before the event amen see when the Holy Ghost he says comes and reveals the word and makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you can you say Amen say that again when the Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word which he did by a prophet and makes it live just exactly and we know he did amen what other man could stand up outside of Jesus Christ and look at that and say this day this scripture is fulfilled and take scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture and not only can he do that this bride can do that yes sir amen see you it makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you you see it it's un it its promise for the hour ain't that right see so the spirit Jesus told us that the spirit of Truth he would send the spirit of Truth amen and we know the spirit of Truth has comeing this day and has made the word known to us and is making it live just exactly what he said it would amen see then then it becomes a revelation and when it becomes a revelation then you can start walk Walken by faith can you say Amen when see because Faith doesn't come but by Revelation amen and when God reveals it amen he he Reveals His word he makes it he live just exactly the way he promised it it doesn't matter if the world accepts it or not amen God's word Still Remains the Same and it lives he makes it live just exactly the way he said it would live then it becomes a revelation can you say amen and the elect will see it see amen then it becomes a faith to us amen then you can start walking with God by faith Walking with God by faith can you can't walk with god without Revelation amen for the faith is the Revelation the Revelation is the faith that comes to you see amen that's right see amen then then you you now begin to fulfill what Enoch typed out for the Bible says he walked with God he walked with God God did he walk by feelings no did he walk by sensation no did he walk by theologians no did he walk by what he thought it should be no he walked by faith it was a revelation to him how else did he build that pyramid amen as brother Wayne brought to us last year I believe it was this around this time amen and what a revelation that Enoch had of the whole church and the coming and and all of these things had it a revelation of this day and he began to walk with God by faith and it took him home and that was only a type amen that he was the type of us can you say amen amen see Amen brother Brown said his whole body was transformed to meet a type in God and he was taken to heaven without even seeing death now you're that people sitting here in this in this building there's people all in this around this world Amen that Enoch typed for this age didn't type any other people but this age Enoch was the seventh from Noah which was a type of the church ages and all he said now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh showing that it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture can you say Amen another place there's no doubt that we're in the seventh Church age we all know it why it's been revealed to us it's been revealed the re has come to us can you say Amen we're we're not in we're not waiting for an eighth day messenger we're not waiting for another Prophet to come amen it's been revealed to us we're living in the seventh Church age amen we all know it see it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture amen he says the end time bride will be called out of the rapturing or called out he said the rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age see we we which we are now bearing record of that age can you say Amen we know it not because some some teacher come and told us but the word was revealed to us and the spirit of God made it live now it's a revelation we're not in the first church age we're not in the sixth Church age we're not in I had one you know brother a man tell me years ago oh no no I was trying to tell him about this I just come in the message I'm trying to tell him about that were you know uh uh uh in the seventh Church age and all he said we're not in the seventh Church age we're in the sixth you know and and and I don't know if he just was mocking or what I don't know uh I was pretty young you know uh about it but I was excited telling everybody man we're ready man for this Rapture you know and but but now we we're not guessing about it we're not taking some man's word the word has been revealed and it's made now living and now we've got the revelation we are that seventh age people we are that rapturing people we are there is no other time amen I so that's why all these other doctrines don't move me that's why all these moves don't move me all these these things that the world's getting and the churches are having and it doesn't move me I'm not looking for the prosperity of America I'm looking for home it's a revelation to me yes sir Glory so now the Rapture involves being change from Mortal to immortality that's what the Rapture involves in now see because he says here Paul 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all everybody say we shall all be changed we shall all be changed see in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we're not all going to sleep we're not all going to go by the way of the grave but we all have a promise we're going to be changed amen so this WAP rure is is including uh uh uh both dead and living we're all going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump not not president Trump either see at the last Trump for the Trump shall uh sound amen and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption Amen and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on corruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying the scripture the prophecy that is written death is swallowed up in Victory No More Death to contend with no more corruption to contend with no more agonizing to contend with we're going to be changed that's what this Rapture is all about you can be caught up in Revelation and still have heartaches and still have agonize and and still shed your tears and and still go through the hell and and all of these things but when this Rapture really takes place that all will be over with you'll never have another mind battle you'll never have another River to Cross you'll never have to have all the things that you go through today it'll all be like another past it'll all be past tense what a Rapture what a Time both the dead in Christ who have risen and those who are alive and remain going to be changed changed amen see amen now notice he says now we become part of that the changing we become part of that see uh uh that time come before that time comes catching up into the Rapture see so so all this is part of the Rapture but the dead in Christ is going to raise amen and we're all going to be changed then caught up can you sayen oh man the gray hairs brother Tim is going to be gone the hairs that we've lost you know brother BR you you heard brother Bram talk about it amen and and uh uh uh how you know losing his hair and all that and she he's well you know I've not lost the one and she said well pray tell me where they're at if you hadn't lost them he says where they're at where wherever I'm I got him from he says that's where I'll be going and and you know good and well when he went into that body amen he wasn't in that Earthly body when he went Beyond curtain of time and he had a full set of hair amen and and and and these things see so so we're changed we're we're we're changed amen now now notice brother Brown said see standing and feel a change everybody say a change wherever you're at you could be at work you could be here right now you you could be at the grocery store you could be at school you could be at home or whatever you could be in your prayer closet you could be listening to a message you could be just combing your hair and all of a sudden feeling a change amen come on the gray hair go out and the wrinkles Fall Away see going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and we shall meet our loved ones first H there's mama there's papa there's my buddy see oh hallelujah we're ready see and then together with them that were dead says the scripture we'll be caught up in the air to meet the Lord see that's the order of the coming amen oh to see that old daddy of mine and and and to see the them old loved ones that went down in faith Yonder to meet them see see the sweetness of God knowing that if we had met him first if we had met the Lord first then we'd be wondering in the back of our mind see uh uh well did did Mama make it did did did she was she in this uh uh we preached so hard we tried was she there is Uncle Joe here his brother here and so and so here see Lord we love you love you see oh thank God but but you know we're kind of just uh who who made it who who didn't make it you know what I'm saying so he says see first we're going to meet one another then there'll be no wondering about it see we'll know that they've made it see and we're all there then we can join around the throne and Worship the Lord oh the Lord is so good to us he's loving to us you say Amen now then the prophet says that this Rapture is going to take place between 600 and 9 ain't that right so it's not just about getting caught up in Revelation this is a real event yes sir 6 and N some morning he says see so and and a people who truly believe this message amen and and and are following it we believe exactly what brother Ram said about it amen that's right amen see brother Bram did not change that his latter I mean he's talking all the way up uh uh the the the you know them sermons last five sermons of his life he's talking about a Rapture he's talking about a literal Rapture he ain't now if if if if all of a sudden God has changed that that that thought amen that now it's just going to be caught up in Revelation and it's just going to be some other way then then surely God wouldn't have a prophet that is supposed to get us ready for whatever Amen to preach the last sermons of his life about a Rapture and he ain't got time to change what he said no it's preachers that change what he says it's these Scholars that change what he said it's the doubters that change what he says but there is going to be a Rapture amen and we must be looking forward to it ain't that right Amen brother R said you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers and so forth he said well we better leave that alone he said here all these people come up missing you say they don't hear he from them they're standing there and then they're not that's the way the Rapture is going to be one of them will drop right down and this T terestrial body would take on a Celestial body and there will be no hide or hair or bones left it'll be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that amen he said see we see all this going on right now we see it all going on right now things that are happening weird things that are happening that scientist and the world does not know our government is keeping secret trying to keep it secret but you and I already know it we've had a prophet tell us all this stuff glory amen see and so he said we see all this going on the pentagon's wanding about these lights Mystic lights that they're seeing in the sky you seen that they had one here in the paper Jeffersonville this week so forth a Mystic light they don't know what that is but listen little children it's going to pick you up on these days think of it it's it's come more more prevalent in this age Rapture age than any other age why they're sitting here going to pick you up brother Tim one of these days are you with me now they don't know what it is they're trying to figure it out but that's our right home they're here it's Rapture time it's going to pick you up one of these days see don't worry everybody say don't worry amen they wrote that song Don't Worry Be Happy Well he can write that but now we got a prophet telling us don't worry be happy amen I'll take his word he says see what happened just before Sodom God came down with some angels and they had an investigation judgment said I've heard the cry and it's uh so sinful so great so I've come down down uh to find out whether it's altogether the truth or not that right see watch that main one that main one that stayed with Abraham could discern the thoughts was in Sarah's heart behind him see you look around just a little bit and notice watch what it's doing the same thing today wow the same thing it's an investigation judgment why after a while the church when it can stay in that place now and I going to say this when it can stay in that place and every seed has been brought to its spot they will be gone are you with me see so so that that's it see when the church can stay in that place amen and and mature basically is what he's saying see amen come up come up see to where it's been brought to that spot they're going to be gone so that's that's that's what I want to say tonight or to you this morning right fast is is is stay in that place stay in that place no matter what goes on in your life no matter what confusion no matter what what Satan throws at you you stay in that place till you come to a maturity can you say Amen stay in this word stay in the message and I want to tell you you young people amen you better listen now if you're going to go in that Rapture you better stay there in that place too you better get into that word you better get into this message you better get in with all your heart you say well I got the Holy Ghost well the Holy Ghost ain't going to let you just go happy go lucky and just do all your little old thing and and any parent ought to make sure that their children amen are staying in this message stay in that message play that message this me basketball ain't for them Sports ain't for them this message is for them amen football ain't going to get them in a Rapture this message is going to get them in a Rapture volleyball ain't going to get them in a Rapture this message is going to get him in a rapture well I got to keep them well church if the message can't keep them start living a life start living a Godly life quit hanging around the trash that you hang around can you say Amen poor kids little Minds all confused because we hang around these that that wear their bathing suits and all that and then we got our little old dresses on amen they talk down the message they talk down Holiness they talk down everything that we believe in then our children are hearing that it's it's Rapture time it's Rapture time believe in this message with all your heart believe this message see when that seed see after a while the church when it can stay in that place and every seed has been brought to its spot they're going to be gone see they won't know what happened to them the world your friends your neighbors won't know what happened even some church folks won't know some pastors won't even know see but you're going one one will be going one way one will be going over to the pastor's house one will be going here or down there and the first thing you know they're not there now you know what brother Brandon called The Rapture he actually called it the titled the message a sudden going away of the church that's what the Rapture is going to be that's what he called it a sudden going away of the church ain't that right so I looked up what sudden it it's marked by an abruptness you got plans to do something you got you you you got your whole life scheduled out you got your whole day scheduled out amen you you you may be going on a vacation you may be meeting you uh other people at for the coffee shop or to go have lunch or whatever and all of a sudden they Su in abruptness amen and not just your plans but life life Trials come to sudden abruptness everything that you've gone through whether it's it's in your health whether it's in your mind whether it's whatever it is it all comes to a sudden abruptness see sudden is marked by an abruptness H or an unexpected occurrence unanticipated right see so then that tells us that the sudden going away of the church does not the suddenness is not does not happen to the bride in other words it it's not the bride that is left un un un unguarded or caught by surprise it it's not the bride that that it happens unexpected to she's already had the Revel she knows that this is rapturing G she's looking for the Rapture she's preparing this is what her life was is preparing for the I understand we got to work I understand we got family I understand we've got obligation but the Rapture is our first priority we're leaving here it could be today it could be tomorrow it could be any second that's how close we are brother brandham said it's later than you think it's later than you think can you say Amen when you think it might happen in a minute it's later than that it's later can you say Amen so it's not going to be a sudden thing to the bride because she has been expecting this to happen she's been preparing for this to happen she's been unloading for this to happen Hallelujah can you say amen hallelujah so she's doing exactly what the Prophet told her to do bless the Lord look notice the warning brother Bram said I want you to be on your toes amen be ready watching every minute quit your nonsense yes sir just get down to business with God C it's later than you think that's true amen another place said just wait just wait don't get impatient just wait go listen to the message Shalom peace don't worry peace just wait keep your lamps trimmed amen all filled full of oil pray up every hour Lord not every day every hour just keep ready be ready everybody say be ready be sweet and watching that's the warning to the church be ready don't don't don't get your eyes on everything else be ready keep watching amenl that's right who are the ones going in the Rapture well the wise virgin the called out the elected the predestinated amen for orain the redeemed amen right remember Prophet told us now he come to redeem those that whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life prise the Lord he come to redeem them Calvary 2,000 years ago he'd been under anticipation pise the Lord knowing that this day would come so he goes through all the trouble for you he becomes your lamb he becomes the great high priest all through these ages he become he's been our high high priest for this moment the Lord securing you now he's come to claim he's come to claim what he has redeemed sir now the only the only ones that should be worried about that is those that aren't redeemed but for you and I that have been redeemed and you know you're redeemed it's already been a revelation that your name's in the book that's a joyous time you can interrupt my life any day I don't have to see who's the next president I don't have to I don't have to wait for my children to grow up I I don't have to hello there there's going to be a change that's coming yes sir see brother BR said see Jesus come to seek and save that which was on that book he bought the book of redemption it was lost and he redeemed us and all names was on that book was redeemed when he was when he redeemed us then as I have said many times you recognize that amen GNA say that again Jesus come to seek and save that which was on that book he bought the book of redemption he bought it now it's open been handed down right and now we should be able to see our name that's what John did when he looked upon the book when he looked upon the promises that's right he saw himself every promise in the book he saw was his Hallelujah can you say Amen see that's that's what this message is it's not about legalism it's not about dos and don'ts it's not about whatever people wanted to make of this message that ain't it it's a message of grace to you that you're able to see it clearly and see your name in the book see it was lost he redeemed us and all names was on that book was redeemed when he redeemed us see and you recognize that that's why you're here this morning why you're coming up out of all these organizations and things you're not crying about it you're not you're like man I wish we could go back you know uh uh you know maybe they were better there and I just don't want people to people are turning against me and all that you understand why it's happening you understand why you're in a Methodist Church and not in a Baptist or a Pentecostal or or some other organ ation a amen and you can be friends with people amen out out of this message anytime it's it's people that usually don't want to be friends with you especially if you start believing the message the way it should be you understand amen because they think well you're holier than now and you're this and you're that and you know more about it and then all these things no there's just something that has called us out now we understand why there was a book that was redeemed there was a book that was opened my name is in the book brother Brown said there's something that is pulling youall see that's why you're here that's why you're sitting here that's why You' come out of the organizations and all of the world and all the filth and all that some people think this message is about legalism and all that the dos and and that's way they look at it well I got to I got to do this I got to do that I got to make my dresses a little little long and I don't you know and and usually when people are like that then they want to see how far they can get away with what they can get away with you know what I'm saying we we were in it I mean we were in the Apostolic Pentecostal and women you know the women would trim their bins it's just enough so the preacher won't preach against there just enough people won't it's Same Spirit just cut it off shave him you understand what I'm saying or or they try to get along see they try to get as far as they could go see and you know and or if someone's got the desire wear high heels and they want to know how much they can get away with before it starts becoming illegal you you know what I'm saying but for us none of that matters anymore we our names been written in the book something else is calling me the preacher didn't call me Mama didn't call me daddy didn't call me amen you didn't call me I didn't call you something is pulling me home something's pulling me why it's Rapture time it's the time that Redemption is now made known the lamb has come to redeem those he has purchased remember the eaglet in the chicken yard brother Brown uses that a lot oh yes well there's a reason he's using that right Parable that little eaglet heard the scream of Mama and realized all of a sudden something was different see he couldn't find his identity in the chicken yard couldn't find it in the the trucks couldn't find it in the hunting couldn't find it in the girls and the boys couldn't find it in the church he couldn't find it in the seminaries he couldn't find it in the concerts he just couldn't find it I mean he searched it in the bars he find I mean you can search in the bars you can search it in the churches it's just about as bad as the B as as either one and and you're searching everywhere right he search and he couldn't find his identity everything was too Earthly he went all around in the Earth or in that chicken yard Earth and he couldn't find something something was wrong something was different but he heard something from above the voice from above that was not Earthly amen looked it up looked up there and he found his identity he was looking as though he was in a mirror amen see so we find amen that that you know the prophet of church didn't have that satisfying something the world didn't have that satisfying something but you heard something else that was a scream ain't that right well Matthew 25 calls it the voice of a bridegroom can you say Amen yes sir see he said you realize that you were born for that right you realize that when you heard the scream you realize you were born for that you were born for this message Hallelujah ain't that right you're part of it you fit into it like a glove on a hand you fit in this message the message fits you you fit this message it's like hand and gloves am amen you see birds of of a Feather they flock together because they have something in common Lord Brother Bram said birds and doves has nothing in common their diet is different although a dove could be hatched under a buzzard that's right depends on what it was to begin with now in that see though the dove might have to be mothered a while by that by that Buzzard but finally he'll find his mate right right we might maybe there's some of us here that was Mother by a buzzard denominational Buzzard oh yeah that's okay but then you had to find your mate he said see that's what the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is part of the groom right therefore the word that is is to be filled fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day it's the same word same experience same life all right that's why this message is appealing to us yes it's the same Lord Jesus right am am so that's the ones that's going to be in the Rapture remember Adam was both masculine and feminine Spirit male and female because he was Spirit man before he came into a body amen then when he become flesh man animal Flesh on Earth he is showing portraying here the bride see God never took and made another being but he took part of Adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side took the feminine Spirit out of Adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his Spirit part of his body part of Flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to Christ that's why the Rapture of the r seed has to come first see the argument decades long argument centuries long argument is that the bride has to go through the tribulation first but this brother brond is explaining this this is why the Rapture has to go first before tribulation right see the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years and they're brought up at the white Throne judgment and remember brother BR said we do not want to be at that th white Throne judgment he said flame me alive cut me piece by piece inch by inch and tear me apart do whatever you can but don't let me stay at the stand before the white Throne judgment then at that time there's no mercy ain't that right amen see the rest of the Dead going to live not for a thousand years they're going to be at the white Throne judgment but there is no judgment to the roll seat or the predestinated Seed of Abraham because you're part of him are you with me now see you're part of him and how do you know you're part of him the scream of mama has come the eagle scream has come and you no longer kept wandering around in the barnyard amen trying to cluck and trying to practice here you're scratching and all that the scream caught your attention and before you know it you're trying to fly amen you're trying to now you found another identity so you can say oh you can't fly oh yes I can fly that voice is telling me I can fly that voice is telling me it's time to come up the voice is telling me it's Rapture time the voice is telling me it's time to change your environment change your condition change the atmosphere and you respond to the voice HJ you get your nose out of the television and you respond to the voice you get your nose out of The Honky ton and you respond to the voice you get your nose out of the movie theaters and you respond to the voice you get your nose out of everything and out of people's business and all and you respond to that voice now you put your energy into Flying Like an Eagle Hallelujah yes sir why now you've known that you're part of his flesh of his flesh you're part of him word of his word life of his life yes sir you've heard the voice that's why the Rapture has to take place God will not leave you here I promise you the things that are had coming up on this Earth no man knows what's going to happen it it you can't even fathom what's going to happen after the bride is gone but God rich in Mercy has identified himself with you you and you could identify yourself with him and before that takes place amen before the tribulation and all hell breaks loose and Satan is actually able to have his way Amen on the earth like he has always wanted to amen God is going to snatch you out the only reason why Satan can't have his way in everything that he's doing you look at the corruption you look at the evil and the perverseness and all that amen and yet we think that's that's horrible and it is horrible but you can just imagine amen there's something there that is stopping him from going all the way with it is because there's a bride upon this Earth amen that God says oh no don't you touch it amen don't you do nothing yet can you say Amen you and I as the bride of Christ has got a protection around us amen you've got a protection and not only that you've got the authority to claim your children you've got the authority to claim your spouse you've got the authority God has given you that Authority upon this Earth good but before the wrath of God comes he's going to take you out here amen and his brother Brown said woe to them that are left behind then good amen so brother Bram I hope this all right this morning the Lord Brother Braham said don't get the Rapture of the church and the white Throne judgment mixed up because the Rapture of the church there is no judgment amen that's true there is no can you say amen amen another place it said the elected goes first in the Rapture because they cannot they cannot everybody say they cannot say it personally I cannot go in the Judgment that's amen the elect goes in the Rapture first because they cannot go into the Judgment you see there's a word concerning this John John 5:24 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation he knew what the wrath of God was going to come he knew that it was going to be poured out he knew the darkness that that was coming upon the Earth but he left us a promise you will not go into into condemnation you will not be judged you will not face that that wrath you will not take this is why a prophet could say Shalom Church shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death un life ain't that right so by God's grace we have been tied to the very thing that is going to take us out amen is bringing on this Rapture remember the prophet said the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture see what what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith the faith now with that that and and and what What My Title was I didn't tell you was atmosphere for Rapture atmosphere for Rapture you see the message changes your atmosphere see bring you back bring them back to the faith that see and and and the faith has a different atmosphere from unbelief atmosphere bring you back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the father's the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore sayith the Lord that's real event in time evangelism end time evangelism right remember the angel of the Lord told Brother brandham that his ministry would be that liken unto uh John the Baptist and he was in the Ohio River baptizing a group of people and on his 17th person amen as he was baptizing them a light appeared and brother brm tells it in many places but this one he says I was baptizing at 2:00 in the afternoon and right out of the out of that brassy sky where there hadn't been rain for weeks here he come with a Roar and said as John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming Christ you're sent forth with the message to forerun the second coming of Christ amen so brother brandham is getting his commission he knows now even though he may have not known it fully at that time but now it's is Lord is establishing to him that his ministry going to be different from till osburn's and and Jack Cole's and uh uh who all them other men his ministry would be like John the Baptist forun the second coming amen and so this explains why his message is so important because later on in his ministry it was revealed to him that his message that that was to forun the the second coming was that of the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 right his message was of that and then in that message would be what Jesus Promised in Malachi 4 he would be that prophet and his message would actually turn that the heart of that elect back to the faith right see so so uh uh it's it's all preparing for Rapture so this uh uh brother Braham said see the seventh Angel's message under the seven under the same trumpet and this is the Feast of trumpets uh the message that he's preaching B said the seventh Angel's message under the same Trent same everything exactly same seal what is it to do to call the people the bride out of that Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine wine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us science has proved it by pictures right the church knows it the world around see we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing and thus say the Lord but what's been the truth see did he not say down there on the river as John the Baptist was sent so will this message see so then so his message is that of the angel of seventh angel his message is tied to the Rapture for it's the shout right 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself shall descend with a shout and in that Rapture message brother Brown says the shout is the message to gather the people right see so the message of the seventh angel is is the key to the Dead Rising out of the ground it it's it's the key to the changing of our bodies it's the key to us being caught up to meet the Lord in the air and and brother Brown said the bridegroom call comes through this right the message it it's the bridegroom call so this is why they want to nitpick brother brandom they want to say well that's his opinion and this opinion all that well whatever they want to say that's fine all I know is the bridegroom call it is the bridegroom call amen see amen and and calling us to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen see so so this message is is like Mama's voice was to the eagle that little eaglet see Amen in it it's to us the message is to us that same way brother brandham he said a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming in the Rapture well we know we've lived the time out we've lived the time out the at the time of rapture is at hand and we're looking everybody say we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in and now we when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to shatter and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people that when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into the heavens can you say Amen now I say to you that we're not waiting for something we're not looking for something to give us WRA uh Supernatural strength this message is the thing that's given this elect a supernatural strength prise the Lord can you say man the fly amen we found that we're not like nothing like the chicken and we've also found out we're nothing like the hawk now you go listen to uh uh uh the yeah spiritual food seed is not air with the Shu shall not be air with the Shu uh uh them and and brother brandom talks about the hawk and how that the hawk is a brother to the eagle and and we we uh we got a couple Hawks that hang out in our yard you know and they just sit in the trees and they're looking for us to skin deer and throw yeah throw the access out and uh away and things like that and so they they they they learned just to kind of hang out for a while in the trees and stuff and and so brother BR says see but the hwk was similar to The Eagle he he was made he he was made to fly in the heavenlies to hunt for his food and he used to fly in the heavenlies to hunt for pursue food but nature always always God has nature to testify what's really going to happen or what is happening or whatever and and brother Bram says but that haulk has gotten so soft he's so soft that he won't go hunting anymore he just sits on the poles he sets on the trees you you drove around the the highways and you see this Hawk on that on the telephone pole or the fence pole he's waiting for food you know he's got the god-given talent to go up you know but he's too soft he's too lazy he he's content just sitting there until someone squishes the mouse and then he goes and gets it you know and and that's food to him right see so he he he's gotten soft brother BR said he has long lost his identification of his original creation he don't fly in the skies anymore he Ops on the ground like a vulture sets upon a telephone post hops along hunting for Dead Rabbits the hawk wasn't made to do that see that's just like the natural or the church and he's talking of the natural church church natural it was made see the church was made similar to The Eagle it should take the place in the heavenlies but instead of that it's gotten soft it don't fly into the unknown no more and and and Into the Blue right that's right see no sir it's dependent on its modern ways of adoption of Education of Theology and in some man-made denomination looking for a bunch of Dead Rabbits half rotten that something uh else had and you know what now they're willing to accept gays and G transgenders and and all of that they're so soft eating maggoty food and and filth and and all of that you know brother Bram even talked about that these guys will you know put their keys in the Hat and and and then then pull a key out and whatever key they got that's the woman they go to to to to bed with and swapping wives and all that happens in the church amen and and and they're soft when they should be flying in the heavenlies they should be a a a a a real uh uh Powerhouse for the for the world to look at look where they're at today so steep in politics and and just corruption can you say amen he said see what is it they're hopping along on the ground now that's right just a hawk see that that that's what tells it see but the eagle hasn't changed a bit see he stays an eagle and you know what an eagle lives in a different atmosphere than that Hulk and then that chicken and that Sparrow and all of these things he's in a higher he's in an Heavenly atmosphere and that's where you should be as Eagle when you're at home and sickness comes don't you sit there like some old chicken and say I just don't know I just I'm just going to pull my hair I don't know what to do oh yes you do if you're an eagle you've been feeding off this work you know what it is to pray you know what it is to believe you know that God still works miracles quit acting like a chicken quit acting like a hawk I'm afraid to shake somebody's hand I might get what they got soft chicken well it's true anyhow you want to get out of here you better have a rapturing faith and brother brand said how can you have rapturing faith you can't even have faith for headache Lord the World falls apart on some little old iny little thing School calls and says they can't handle our children well we can't handle either I know well you're not an eagle Act Like an Eagle you know the power of prayer amen you should be walking with God good good the world has to lean upon this psychology they have to lean upon the Sciences they have to lean on the technology and the medicine we don't have to GL come on Church don't get don't get quiet on me it's just the truth we got all these Essentials and all of these things like they are a miracle worker why not just go back to the Bible and take God at his word I am the god that Health thee fly in a different atmosphere and faith will put you there either you got the faith of a chicken a faith of an eagle or a hawk or you'll have a faith of an eagle oh try it one time it'll make you different but you'll be glad you're different because God will walk with you that's free Lord but still true eagles live in a different atmosphere that's right eagles live in a different atmosphere start walking with God don't sit here and say oh I believe God sent a prophet and then have a Baptist Faith Methodist Faith a world Faith a sinner faith if God can save your soul fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then promise you a catching a changing way of your body surely he can heal your little sniffy nose you're saying I'm going in a Rapture well you think about that how in the world you're going in a Rapture and you've got to have your body changed that's right and God can't touch that arthritis God can't touch that heart situation come on church I'm not against medicine but when we look at that as the as the goto all the time time what about God's word you can take it or leave it whatever but we got to live in atmosphere quit talking negative quit talking doubt amen Lord BR said in one place it doesn't I mean if you're sick you're sick there's nothing wrong with say y I'm sick okay what now next I don't know brother Bram go listen to perfect faith brother Bram said if you had that faith that type of Faith perfect Faith doctor tell you Friday that you're going to die tomorrow Monday die Monday which will be tomorrow half of us wouldn't be in church half of us would be mad if the family come to church here I'm dying I'm dying tomorrow going to kick the bucket cuz the doctor said God had nothing to say about it the doctor says about it come on now my body is telling me he's right and my family goes to church and everybody else goes to church for Pete's sake they should be mourning and crying and everything else well the prophet says if we really had that Faith we'd laugh in the doctor's face we wouldn't go home and cry it's like the man that that got the wrong diagnosis true happening he got the wrong Di nois the the the doctor told him he had cancer and he was going to die he went home and shot himself doctor found out he didn't it was the wrong patient he told the wrong guy World falls apart you going to let a doctor rule your life you're going to let some symptom rule your life you're going to let your dad rule your life your mama rule your life the preacher rule your life you're going to let some skeptic and unbeliever Rule your life you going to let your spouse rule your life they want to live in doubt and unbelief where they want to talk about it that's fine but don't talk about it in my house can you say Amen why I'm an eagle I live in a different atmosphere we're going to change this thing the message tells me to change it'll change your beliefs it'll change your habits it'll change the way you live the way you look at things it'll change your outlook if there's ever a time that we should be rugged Christians the message should make us rugged Christians and brother Braham said we ought to be rugged Christians not some soft soaped up you know to where someone sneeze we all pass out be rugged Christians God's looking for rugged Christians Praise You Love the Lord hallu now notice eagles live in that different atmosphere brother Brian said see the church was once the carrier of a true word justification then it become a carrier of sanctification then it become a carrier of the baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on and keeps going back see this the the the the see that that believer or whatever churchgoer see tried to eat something Mana of another day it's rotten it's no good right but an genuine Eagle of this day knows that that was all right but we've got that plus until Jesus Christ is made manifest in the fullness of his power as he promised to be in the last days now she talking about the church which if you go listen to the Future uh not future home uh the the the the seed shall not be air with the shuck brother B identifies that shuck as the Pentecostal age she is now a a dry shut the life has passed from her the spirit of God passed through her is true and will not she will not be Heir with the Vindicated seed word she sure will not be she will not be in the Rapture she'll be a church member may come up come up in the second res resurrection and be judged according to what she's heard ain't that right but she ain't going to be in a Rapture that Pentecostal shuck ain't going to be in a Rapture anyone that keeps looking back and looking back instead of ref instead of moving on with the light is going to be is not going in a Rapture can you say Amen now the world wants to move and and advance in technology but they don't want to advance in God Amen brother Bram talked about that too you know back at we py Beal you know we lived in py where Pony Beal was right y'all know who Pony Beal was thank you Terry out west well he was with Wild Bill hickcock and boy you go PA me you'll learn all about him yeah and so he lived you know I don't know when he lived but he lived out there in the in the air of the West Western days and so you know but but every year uh everybody dresses up you know a certain time of year and they reenact the pawn he Bill and what he done and and you know and and and these guys will walk down to our little through the little old town of 2,000 people you know and uh all the little guys just oo and all wow that's so cool you know but brother Brandon talks about that how they always want to reenact the past always lived out you know and then he tells them modern women he says well why don't don't you wear Grandma's dress then if you want to really go back then wear my grandma's dress wash that makeup off your face quit cutting your hair and act like a woman but they don't want to do that right amen see so if they want to go they only want to go just a little bit back not not too far back not to the day of Pentecost where you get really get a holy ghost experience right see so the prophet says see she no more flies into the blue into the unknown unto the supernatural where the powers and Heights and the promises of God Eternal Word is made possible see where all things uh all things to them that believe she won't believe that see she said see she falls right back on the telephone wire and said well my denomination says the rabbits is all right well if denomination you know one Deacon told told told the pastor you know and says well well they've legalized marijuana so I can I can I I I have ever right to to to to smoke marijuana if I want to you know well that Deacon got set down and and but but you you just because they say it just because they say it's okay to go half nude not even half anymore does that make it okay absolutely not we go by the word of God ain't that right see so so my denomination says the rabbits is all right though they got maggots in them see but they're all right and she depends on that but she's not going in Rapture you understand what I'm saying see so so when you're really feeding off the message it's going to change everything about you because it's preparing you for a Rapture it's preparing you for a body change it's preparing so therefore instead of falling apart on things you know what brother Bram even told us and and this is not a to bring chew out or even into a legalism brother brand is just telling what is really in us as as the sons of God that even if you burnt your hand on on the fire on a stove he says usually what we do is and we start panicking go get the whatever turpentine or whatever he said go get something and and put it on there he said but if you would just shake it off and not even pay a b he said it wouldn't even it wouldn't even touch you but he's telling us this because of what we are made to be praise the Lord are you with me I can give you a quote I I don't have it right here but I can give you a quote where he says that but what is it we fall apart because the world does it if the world is falling apart let them fall apart but you've been lifted out of that barnyard there's nothing left there but judgment but God has prepared you for a Rapture and it ain't just going to come you've been changing your environment you've been changing the atmosphere all around you brother R said you got the ability to change your atmosphere you got you you got the power to change it don't you let somebody else in influence you you let this word influence you can you say amen that's right so we've not changed from what God started us out to be on the day of Pentecost see the seed that was that the seed that was planted on the day of Pentecost was the original seed God planted that he started his church now we're living in this day where the seed that same seed has ripened that's right can you say Amen what they claim to be the church they take out miracles did they did did that seed that God planted in its infancy did it work miracles did it perform signs and wonders sure it did so now we are that same church that same seed that has come to maturity for Rapture that's the truth so then if we are that one then notice brother BR said the shuck has to pull away so the grain can get in the presence of the sun I hear the coming of the combine Lord it won't be long and then the great elevator will take up his bride into the glory for in the presence of God another place what did it pull away for so that it would bring the Grain in the presence of the sun to ripen the grain to a golden ripen for the Master see so that's why everything is pulling away from you amen everything you know quit quit trying to be attached to things that people that that God is trying to take away from you you you got to stand alone in this message and and let it ripen you to where you you you're not hanging on to this idea and this idea and that idea and what what grandma says and what mama says and what daddy says and what preacher says and what this says stay with this message stay with it and then let it it ripen you receive it in you let it ripen you can you say Amen see oh yes see it it it it pulls away so that it brings that grain that seed you that's where we're at see not Chuck we're we're bright it's bride time sea time in presence of the sun to ripen the grain to a golden ripen for the master why is it pulled away sure it causes heartaches tears see that they don't lay before the s n but the s o n to be ripened to the true Full Gospel to manifest everything that Jesus Promised in the Bible didn't you say Amen so when we hear that voice and we're connecting as Mama to that eagle that eagle didn't say oh wow that's so pretty I believe it I believe you up there no he wanted to be part of it he's like well if that's me why am I over here that's what I want to be he didn't sit there and say well well that's good that's brother brandom up there buddy that's a prophet yes sir I believe in that everybody an eagle now what do I do next no no he wanted to become part of it part of it if we can if if they can believe the word why can't we believe the word if they can see signs and wonders why can't we believe signs and wonders if brother ramam can put a token over his children why can't we put a token on our children if he could rest in that token why can't we rest in that token can you say man if he walked with God why can't we walk with God Amen you say oh well he was a prophet oh nonsense that's the devil talking in in that sense he had a particular Ministry we understand that he walked in he lived in the presence of that angel and all that stuff amen but as brother BR said Moses was just he was not the bride he was part of the of the of the of the Bride of the people brother Brandon was not the bride he was part of the Bride he was part of us and he was calling us to come up higher come up higher and you walk with god brother R didn't walk with God for us we walk with God for ourselves Lord you love him amen so we've been called see he said there's a raising up of a body today among the people there will be no more organizations it goes that goes right into Rich l osia so the Angel's message is to pull us out of the Pentecostal and World Traditions now notice what brother brm said in the invisible Union of the bride yes sir he the bridegroom took away your shame oh is't that wonderful there's no excuse why you can't come up higher he took away your shame he tied on he he he loosened you from the Rope remember I think it was brother Brandman that talked about that little that Crow yeah every time the crows would come that Crow come on come on join us come on we're we're but he was tied man tied him up and he would he would run out so far and he'd fall over and make a big mess of himself and everybody be gone and he just sitting there and but one day a poor old man a man come by and saw that poor old thing and he picked it up and he cut it loose and he set it on the ground the buzz that Crow just sat there and here they all come but he gotten so used he gotten so used to run so far so far become a mental thing so far then when them buzzer or them crows come come on join us we're we're having a good time he was loose but he run out so far to where he knew would stop and he stopped right there and I thought oh God help us not to stop amen we've been loosed right he took away your shame put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your H your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which forain you has washed you by the washing of Water by the church no that doesn't sound right you might find that in the AL Almanac but it's not in God's Bible but by the washing of the Water by the word in the word you're standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church that's what he said that's my message see is not to keep you bound but to say you're free free free free free he said see he said you're standing if you're standing on God's word with God's word every amen every jot every turt where you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks amen get out here in the wheat where you can right get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it I love it in the first place amen so what's he doing he's telling you that the Rapture is for you can you say Amen praise the Lord that's you love the Lord amen amen if the musicians will come bless his name praise the Lord oh what a time it will be amen what a timeall I thought of this um I got I mean taken a long time but I got a lot to go but I do you know in the early years brother brandom of of his ministry um he was in San Antonio Texas and he was walking out on the platform to speak and a man started speaking in tongues brother Bri said it was like a machine gun rapidly way back way back there the fellow raised up and said thus sayth the Lord the man that's walking to the platform is going forward with the ministry that was ordained of almighty God and as John the Baptist was sent as the first Forerunner of the coming of Jesus Christ so he packs a message that will cause the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ brother brandan was so astounded I guess or whatever he began to ask do you know that man do you know who he was nobody knew who he was then after that happening Brother Brandon talks about being in Arkansas after after after that and he said I was trying to explain it trying to explain the pillar of fire cuz he had seen it but nobody else had as of yet and he said people knew they would sit and listen Methodist Baptist Presbyterians and so forth and then I happened to look and coming in the door here it come that Pillar of Fire it was just going he said I I I said I will not have to speak anymore for here it comes now and it moved up and people began screaming and they come up to where I was and settle down around just as it was settling down a Min Minister run up and said I see that and it struck him blind as could be and he staggered back you can look at his picture right there in the book and see as it as see it as he staggered back with his head down like that you can see his picture and there it settled down just the newspaper photographer caught it at that time but the Lord wasn't ready then after that he he talks about how he had went after that event he he sometime later he went to that Houston Coliseum there in Houston Texas and there's that skeptic that was trying to prove that brother Brian was a fraud in healing and that God didn't heal and d d and but then the angel of the Lord come down whirling in that room and all the thousands people that had gather he said saw it but notice what he said this is profound because we weren't there when that happened but he said yet the one that sees the picture see that picture was taken there in that Houston colum Coliseum when brother branham's critic you know hired a photographer to take pictures of him not brother brandham but him and he had his picture with his fist taken with his fist right under brother FF Bosworth's nose and Posen none of them pictures took took but that photographer took a picture when that angel of the Lord settled and here it was right there brother BR said see the one yet the ones that sees the picture has a greater proof than you that seen it with your natural eye cuz with your natural eye you could have been mistaken it could have been an optical optical illusion but that's not an optical illusion that's the truth where scientific research proves that it's the truth and the Lord Jesus Christ has did this amen what's he done he's done it for you and I Amen to give us proof that what we're believing what we're following is the truth it's the very thing that's going to get us Rapture Ready Church follow it believe it with all your heart practice it can you say Amen good you love the Lord amen prise the Lord
