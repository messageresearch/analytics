that Lord You've laid this on brother Sean's heart to have a meeting like this and Lord to give an opportunity Lord for people to come together and feed on the word of God and Lord an opportunity Lord that where Believers come together and unite their hearts together Lord we know Lord that it's a it's a special thing Lord Lord Faith Lord be begins to be energized and Lord we know that faith by hearing and hearing of the word of God so God that's what we're here to do tonight we're here to Lord just preach the word of God and Lord I pray that as we open up the Bible tonight we know Lord that Lord anybody that can read has the ability to read can read the words off the pages but Lord we're asking that the author of the book lord would just come down and Lord that you would begin to break the bread of life to our hearts and Lord we know that that would make all the difference tonight Lord Lord if you had just stepped down in the room and and Lord that's what we're we're we're giving you invitation Lord to come and Lord you move among us the way you see fit to move and do the things that you desire to do Lord that's what we're here for Lord we're just giving ourselves over to you and we give you the preeminence in this service God lord we don't invite you to come as a as a as an onlooker or a recording Angel as the prophet would say but Lord we want you to be active in this service we want you to take an active part Lord we want you to do the ministering and Lord and we'll do the hearing Lord and and Lord we we'll do the receiving tonight and Lord I pray God that you'd meet every need heal the sick Lord Lord encourage the discouraged heart and Lord Just Have Your Way among us as we just commit ourselves in this service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen if you take your Bibles tonight we'll turn to the Book of Matthew once again Matthew chap chapter 5 I want to read just one verse of scripture there Matthew 5 and verse 6 and uh also going to read a few verses out of the book of Psalms Psalms 42 I'd like to read um we read this last night Matthew 5 and um verse 6 and the scripture says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen what a promise in the word of God tonight amen blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled Psalms 42 very familiar passage of scripture Psalms 42 and verse one as the the heart panth after the water Brooks so panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God may the Lord just at his Blessing as you're seated tonight want to um we spoke last night on the blessing of hunger and uh I wanted to um just take this evening for a few minutes and speak on the blessing of thirst and you know as we was looking at uh the the blessing of hunger last night um brother brandham said that if we get if if the church would get hungry he said that there's got to be something there's got to be something to satisfy that hunger so when the church begins to get hungry and brother br would say uh in many places and many different ways you know that if people uh begin to hunger for God he said then there's got to be something that will satisfy that hunger amen he and and I believe that really and truly amen the that the problem in this day is not a lack because you know as we was looking at it last night there in the Book of Amos in the 8th chapter of Amos there that there would be a famine in the land in the last days and that famine would not be for bread and water but for the hearing of the word of God Amen and it's really not a lack of the word of God even because we have the word even brother Brandon would say there in the church age book he said we got more Bibles than we've ever had and and we've got you know and and not only that friends we got a message in this hour and God has provided these things for us and amen there's more provision than we've ever had we've got the word of God is more available to us and amen we've got it in the in in book form we got it in tape form we got it on our phones we got it in every kind of way that you can think of we have access to that word but so we can see by that that really and truly the problem if there is a problem amen it's the appetite of the people see amen it's the desire that we have amen because see whatever desire message thirst he said I just want to speak from tonight that one word out of the Bible and he said I was thinking about that that I'd preach the sermon on it thirsting after life and brother Brandon would take that and he said he looked up the word in the dictionary and he said he said it means see Webster says it's a painful desire a painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you amen when you want something so bad brother Brandon would go on to say he said I think David in writing this of the Psalms it must have been in distress and usually it takes distress to bring the best out of of a man it really when God when you get down to when we fast many times to and get to oursel and position see to get oursel out of the way and I think when David got in these places then he began to meditate on the Lord and begin to think about things and many times God gets us in tight Corners amen listen brother R saying many times God gets us in tight Corners amen where we have to look up sometimes even we have to get on our back in a hospital or or on a bed somewhere that we can look up and see where the great blessings of God are coming from amen he said now it's not an unnatural thing to thirst it's a natural thing it's just simply something that God has given us that we could a a desire for something something God has given us and see he's given you a control tower something that sits on the inside of you that controls these different desires see and this thirst this control tire is set in a man's heart is something that God gave him to warn him of the desires and the things that's needful for him amen so you can see by what brother Bram is saying that God Amen puts a thirst in a man brother bam would even take it to the Natural thirst and he would show that God put that in you to show you that you got a need for something let me just say this in starting out tonight The Thirst alone amen it will never uh see if you only had a thirst and that's all you had and there was nothing to satisfy The Thirst listen thirst only shows you what you don't have a thirst is only revealing to you something that you need amen so you see amen it could not be just it's not enough just for us to be thirsty amen there's got to be something that would answer or satisfy that desire amen that's why brother B said if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to that call amen but listen friends if there was no thirst there amen then you would not realize you had a need it takes The Thirst to reveal to you amen that you're lacking something amen that's why just having The Thirst alone is a blessing as we said last night just to be hungry is a blessing listen friends I'm going to tell you in the day we're living and just to have a desire to serve God is a blessing amen just to have a desire to come to the house of God that's a blessing listen friends it's a great blessing that a amen that a pastor could call a weeklong meeting like this and amen even after four or five nights there's still people showing up to church amen that's a blessing amen it shows that somebody's got a desire listen you could be a lot of places tonight amen these young people could be a lot of places tonight amen but because there's a thirst there's a hunger there's a desire Amen in your heart amen that's what brought brought you here hallelujah amen and just to have that desire just to have a desire Amen to to to to serve God and to love God and to feed on the word of God oh it's a great blessing to have that desire tonight brother B said God put that in a man to show him amen something that he needs amen I love this amen the prophet said see it's not an unnatural thing and David said here thirsting for water amen thirsting see the body is in need of something and if you don't Supply that amen you're going to perish amen then David would describe it here as a heart panth after the water books so my soul after thee Oh God as a heart see Amen in the heart brother BR said it's a great lesson that's laying there amen David said as a heart panth after amen that's a deer we all know that amen it's a it's a deer and and how that deer would amen when he's wounded brother B said he would go searching for the water amen this is going to open up a a a further revelation of what the prophet's talking about amen because David is comparing the thirst of a man's heart for God with a thirst that a a deer has for the waterbrook amen but a prophet op opens it up and he says listen this is not just a deer getting thirsty amen and wanting to take a drink of water this is actually a matter of life and death amen if he don't find the water he's going to die amen listen re amen that makes it so much different then it's not just a little bit amen you got a little appetite or or you got a little thirst and you know you want to just drink a little bit to quench The Thirst oh no amen listen this is a matter of life and death amen this is something that you come to a place that you realize if I don't have it I'm going to perish if I can't get it amen I'm going to die amen I can't live without it oh church I tell you when we get people thirsty like that in the house of God Amen we get a desire like that in the house of God again amen listen friends amen I got to have the word of God or I'll perish Hallelujah I got to have a refilling of the Holy Ghost or I'm going to die amen then you'll see people get down to business with God you see people like the man brother Brown talked about he went and nailed down in a corn field one day and he said God if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back to this spot you'll find a pile of bones laying here amen he metant business with God he got to a place listen friends he amen it wasn't just coming to church and going home and amen coming walking up to an altar and amen putting your name on a church book amen oh no he got to a place amen he said I got to have it or I'll perish hallelujah amen I got to have a real experience with God or our perish see that's what David's talking about here as a heart panth after the water books am me a longing a longing a painful desire now the prophet said there's many thirst and brother BR would take this and he say it's just like a a young man young woman it's not unnatural for a young man young woman to love one another see or to thirst for love see when they come to Aid there it's not a natural it's just a natural thing for them to do that brother Brown said God put it in them he put it in you am me that's even a reflection of God's desire yeah because even God long to have a family God longed for companionship God long for somebody that he could have relationship a fellowship amen with a a a and and then God reflects that in his creation with Adam and and when God looks at Adam he said it ain't good that man should be alone is that right so you see brother Brown said when the when our children become of age and you see young boys and young girls and they become attracted to one another and I tell you what in the day we're living in we ought to thank God am mean if your sons attracted to a girl you ought to just thank God for that Amen in this hour that we're living in amen I I tell you because there's so many perversions of that thirst that's what brother man we go into he says see that's a natural thing amen a desire that God has placed within them he said but what happens is is Satan will come and pervert amen that thirst amen that God has put in their heart amen for companionship and Amen brother B we go on and he says he says um he say it's not an unnatural thing he said for a woman to thirst to be pretty he said that's her god-given Instinct see her beauty that God gave her for for her mate and now we find out that women want to be that way and why is it that's just because it's something God gave her it's not wrong for a woman to be pretty the prophet said they should be amen amen there's nothing wrong with that see he said but the true thirst that a woman should have would be to Adorn themselves in modest apparel to have a Christlike spirit amen according to 1 Timothy 2:9 that's the way a woman should

it how that Ishmael comes along but the brother Brown would use it and show us a great Revelation the seed where Paul deals with it in the scripture amen the seed will not be air with the shuck amen but how many know scriptures have compound meanings brother Brown would take Hagar and brother BR would begin to talk about Hagar there in the message remembering the Lord he said I can think of the remembrance of the Lord again at a place of refreshment which we which was in the the well called be the Hera I can't pronounce it amen which in the Hebrew tongue is The Well of him that liveth and

uh uh Abraham had dwelt there in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife and and he went in under Hagar and she conceived and and and and and and and whence uh and when she saw that she had conceived her Miss mistress was despised in her eyes amen and and you know the scripture as it continues on how that that the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness amen and the angel of the Lord told Hagar amen he asked the question where did you come from and where will you go and she said I flee from the face of my mistress sah and the angel of the Lord said to her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands amen and her testimony was because God met her by way well amen and she called the name of that well in the Hebrew amen The Well of him that liveth and seeth me Amen in other words amen she was refreshed by that well to know that God Amen knows what I'm going through oh Hallelujah brother bham says he said misunderstood

Sarah to Abraham the wife there's nothing the woman had done out of the way yet misunderstood by her mistress and put her out in the wilderness to die what a place to be and that water was spent from the bottle and little ishmael's throat was beginning to dry he was crying for water and then there appeared a whale oh my The Well of him that liveth and seeth me and she heard a voice speak and say why weepest thou what are you weeping for and she looked up and saw a whale bubbling up a spring of refreshment amen I I listen friends the prophet of God said it's The Well of him that liveth and
