and amen we are sure blessed you with a wonderful pastor and we sure love him this morning and his family and we want this morning to just bow our hearts together before we read the word and let's just ask the Lord to come and maybe you just lay your hand over on someone standing next to you and just join together in prayer this morning and let's just ask God to come and bless us this morning with his presence Heavenly Father Lord You're our God this morning you're the faithful God you're the god that Lord created all things your Elohim your El Shady eye father Lord I think of Isaiah in the Bible and he was father trying to describe you and Lord he would say you're the counselor of the prince of peace and Lord words would begin to fail him and he would just sum it up and say that you're wonderful and Lord this morning as We Gather here today Father we are indeed a grateful people or to be under Lord the wings of your Covenant promises here father Lord As We Gather here today we've not come for religion we've not come for tradition we've not come to fulfill religious duties but Lord we have come together to bring our little licks of Fire Lord to make that one great Pillar of Fire Lord that you could come and burn Among Us father and Lord every need could be met father I pray this morning as we would begin to come into one mind in one Accord Lord pray that you would drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord May a warmth of the presence of God may it fill this Sanctuary today Father May Our Sick be healed Lord May our loss be found o God May those who are discouraged Lord may they be encouraged today God those that are Lord may be weary may they receive strength father Lord I pray now as we Endeavor to open your word Lord may you send the spirit of Revelation and understanding into the building Lord that it would not just be scriptures and quotes but Lord it would be Revelation they would begin to permeate hearts and lives that we would not leave here educated we would not leave here Lord with more knowledge but Lord we would leave here changed oh God we we would leave here Lord a radiant light of your presence in this hour and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says a man and amen the book of Philippians the second chapter and I just want to read one verse there the 15th verse we read it Wednesday night Philippians 2 and verse 15. the Bible says that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God how many sons and daughters of God that we have here today the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as light in the world among whom you shine as light in the world let's look at the Book of Matthew the fifth chapter again if we can Matthew the fifth chapter I want to read the 14th verse there Matthew 5 . I have just been studying here the past few days and the Lord has been opening some things to me from these verses so we just want to share those with you this morning if the Lord would help us and Matthew the 5th chapter the 14th verse he says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hit neither do men light a candle put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it gives light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing unto the reading of his word as you can be seated here today I want to by the help of the Lord this morning to speak to you for a few moments if I could if I titled this today I want to speak to you on the radiant bride of Jesus Christ the radiant bride of Jesus Christ I just want to share this verse again with you from the Amplified translation of Philippians 2 15 says so that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and guileless innocent and uncontaminated children of God without blemish in the midst of a morally crooked and spiritually perverted generation among whom you are seen as bright lights beacons shining out clearly in the world of Darkness so there's no question this morning that the world is in darkness Isaiah said it like this he said Darkness would cover the face of the Earth he said in Gross Darkness would cover the people so there's going to be an element of Darkness up on the Earth but then there's going to be a deeper or more darker Darkness if we could say it that way upon the people so here we find and we'll all agree that the morals of the age in the world that we live in are at an all-time low there amen mothers are no longer being mothers fathers are no longer being fathers I mean the world has reached its lowest air of morals in the world's history at the same time on the other hand amen perversion has reached its all-time high the morals have reached its all-time low and perversion has reached its all-time high now if you don't believe that and then just look at the news we've got boys that think they're girls and girls that think they're boys we've got men amen marrying other men and raising babies as if that's the modern family amen you see the age that we're living in is a morally crooked and a spiritually perverted generation but what I love about that is the Bible says that right there in the midst of those conditions there would be a bride who would be standing out amen she would not be influenced by those conditions she would not be going the direction or the way the world's going amen but she would be standing out now amen the prophet of God says in the greatest news flash I left off here Wednesday he said what a glorious thing it is for his church after 1900 years almost 2 000 years ago to know that he lives and we meet him on every Bend of the road at every turn at every place we go we see Jesus we see his living presence flowing like radiant light from his glorious Church of the Living God how thankful we should be for them so in other words we see them the light that is in the world today amen is not coming from the world Amen but the light that's in the world is coming from the presence of almighty God he said oh how it is today my poor decrepit friend that man who has never noticed power to give new light and to give New Hope when he walks into the presence of the Divine person of Christ with the faith that holds him Spellbound to his majesty he said isn't it like walking to the altar and giving the minister your right hand he said neither is it like going to the pool to be baptized or standing with a shell he meant to be sprinkled it's walking into a line that you have never witnessed before it's an anchor of a Divine faith that calls anything amen contrary to the word of God as though it was and he said it puts new life it gives New Hope to the dime it gives courage to the weak it gives healing to the sick it gives blessings to the unfavored how wonderful it is Amen to step into the light of his presence how how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence not a myth amen neither is it something that somebody has just fleshly in their minds drawn up but it is coming directly into the presence of the king of glory the Eternal Light of the Living God so amen we're not stepping into a myth we're not stepping into a story we are not here this morning stepping into some idea amen of some denominational system but as the mind of Jesus Christ amen we have stepped into the light of his presence and that light has power Amen to give courage to the weak it has power to give healing to the sick it has power to give Deliverance to the bound it has power Amen to give sight to the blind come on Church it has blight to Old it has power to open the deaf ears amen the radiant light of the Mighty God is the presence of Jesus Christ now amen when you look at this word radium amen it means sending out loud it means shining or glowing amen brightly it is of a person of their expression amen which is clearly emanating great joy amen love or health it is of an emotion or a quality a man that is emanating powerfully amen from someone or something so in other words you're not just standing up on the earth amen receiving light amen but you have become the light by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then out of your very being in the middle of a morally and reverse generation there is a light that is shining out of your heart amen it is pushing against the darkness among the prophet said the manifested word is what will separate the light from the darkness listen friends without this message we are as confused as the son of mites without this message we are as crooked amen as the politicians without this message we are as blameless as 900 denomination amen but in the evening time it shall be light there shall come a line in the church it'll separate you listen if you're thinking you're going to fit in amen you're not a part of this message because this message did not bring you to this world Amen to fit in this message brought you to this world Amen to stand out as a lighthouse amen as a bright shining life amen the promise that Heavenly Father we thank thee tonight amen from the depths of our heart amen that there is a fountain opened in eyes it is a healing fountain that is coming from God out of heaven with his radiant hours amen pouring through amen it is enough to take a cancer-ridden person to Good Health it is enough to make the blind see the death to hear and that come to speak then whatever is Flowing Out of Heaven has got to have something to pour into listen God is not pouring his power into denomination he is not pouring his power into this building amen but there are some prepared vessels amen that were prepared from before the foundation of the world Amen to receive what God was poured into this generation amen and you are now manifesting the radiant powers of almighty God he said listen to the Holy Spirit from the Tower of Glory tonight amen broadcasting by the radiant power of the Resurrection to every believer's heart now the province said in the Statue of a perfect man he said you take us that we're nothing this morning but a wild gourd he said or a not head see there's nothing to us we were all dead and sin trespasses we were all in these kinds of conditions then we ourselves can prostrate ourselves give ourselves up until God takes this transfusion to the name of Jesus Christ amen because there's no other name whereby men must be saved and transfers The Life of Christ into US amen then the life of Jesus Christ amen it's not just in a Corporal body on the throne this morning amen but by the name of Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the life of Jesus Christ has come into the Church of Jesus Christ and she is now manifesting the life and attributes of almighty God he said then we have that kind of Faith the faith that Christ had and Christ's Faith was not based in those Pharisees or those Sadducees or in the pots and Kettles and pans and they're washing amen it was based on the word of God Amen see amen so much until Christ was the word amen the word made flesh remember Wednesday night amen the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming word right here in the middle of a morally crooked and a spiritually perverted generation amen the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word am I to thank the prophet then when we get transfused by his power we die to our own thinking and our faith becomes a genuine Faith Hallelujah he said the Life of Christ is transfused into us we become living creatures of God a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can send his radiant blessings down through there and we're in the stature of Christ amen let me just stop and say the stature of a perfect man was not a good idea it was not a mythical something that brother Branham hatched up in the woods while he was squirrel hunting amen but those were divine attributes they were divine virtues that were not coming from a man they were coming from the life of God and it was God's desire that in this age there would be a people upon the Earth who would be manifesting amen faith and virtue and knowledge and temper they send friends do you realize you're an oddball You're A peculiar person now come on amen amen are we going to have church you're going to look at me amen you are an oddball you are a peculiar person amen you're living in the middle of a morally crooked spiritual perverse nation and you've got faith you've got Temperance you don't just fly off and act like a crazy man when somebody does you wrong amen you got patience and you got you got knowledge and you got all these things you know why amen because God has raised you up he meant to be more than a Bible reader to be more than a quote holder he has raised you up to be the display of the very life of God in an age of such wickedness and Corruption he has put you up on the earth Amen to express his life through your flesh prophet of God said there's only one form of eternal life and that was God Amen then to be a sign of God you had to be in in him always he said the gene of your life spirit your life amen tonight was in God the Father before there was ever a molecule and you are nothing listen out you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God that's how he could say when he went to the Cross she was with him that's how he could say when he raised the Widow of named son you was with him that's how he could say when he opened bartimaeus's eyes that she was there with him was you there in a physical Corporal body no but you was there in a gene but that Gene would eventually come to expression see the prophet said you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God he said but now you're expressed amen so you've moved from the form of Gene amen into expression after his word has come into you Amen to light up this age amen God by his Sovereign will knew that there would be a gene expression of his own life in the middle of a perverted and morally crooked generation amen see his word has come into you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son and a daughter of God therefore do you get what I mean you are now made you are sitting in this church because your duty is to express God to this nation this people this neighborhood where you associate among friends amen I know we're not going to change America amen but that does not remove the responsibility amen from this bride to be the bride in the middle of this crooked Nation I know we're not going to change politics amen but that does not remove the duty and it's been placed upon you by the gene seed of almighty God Amen to be a manifestation to be an expression of what God thinks about things listen I don't know about you this morning amen but this gospel that I'm talking about it is a powerful gospel it is it is a gospel that manifests itself it is a gospel that doesn't shine amen it is a gospel that glows the problem of God said it's true that the big church shines and Glitters with polished theology while the kingdom glows with humbleness the poor and humble listen the gospel don't shine it glows he said Fool's Gold shines but real gold glows Fool's Gold shines amen but real gold glows there's a difference between a glow and a shine we know that whether big church Glitters and shines amen with high polished Scholars fine peers crucifixes all over the wall and the highest and finest of structures and buildings and great tower and things but the Little Kingdom how many is thankful Amen to be a part of that little kingdom he said but the Little Kingdom down in some little alley like here somewhere is glowing with the glory of God Amen filled with humble in every heart amen God working in them Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils so forth amen just letting them pass on by in other words the glow of God is the manifestation of the desires of God and God's desire according to Mark 16 was that they would lay hands on the sick and they would recover amen God's desire was that they would cast out devils in my name God's desire was it they would speak with new tongues amen listen and the Crooked perverse generation that we live in says that don't work no more we've got to have psychologists we've got to have education amen but I happen to be a beacon of lies that will lift my voice and say God said there would be somebody in the middle of this crooked world that would say God's word is still the truth amen God's way is still better than our way I'm on Church his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than I thought amen what is his ways his ways is his word amen his ways is to heal the sick his ways just to deliver the demon tormented come on now Hollywood do not that's not Hollywood's way but we're not here to reflect Hollywood we're here to reflect the gospel the problem that God said Hollywood shines he said but the gospel glows he said there's a lot of difference between glowing and Shining brother Terry I love this to shine means to reflect light clearly and sharply amen but to Glow is to emit light amen usually softly or weakly from itself a glow is always caused by some form of energy amen listen the problem of God said he's pouring his energy into his church not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord he said see the spirit energizes the word then in other words in you was the word can you can you can you can you receive that that you was born with the word in you I didn't say that William Bradham said that he said the word was in you always so the word that was in you amen was laying there dormant amen it was not going until a quickening power of the Holy Ghost amen Came Upon that seed word and begin to Quicken that word and it went from being just a seed into being an expression come on now amen see it in the prophecy we glow we're not shining with outward appearance but we're glowing on the inside by the Holy Ghost amen with sweetness and meekness and gentleness and patience and love amen glow don't shine amen that that word shined amen means a brightness from a source of light can I tell you amen that the world in Hollywood and education and science has become denomination source of light everything they do is be an influenced from a morally and perverse generation among now we might as well preach we're here amen their song services are no longer a bunch of people getting together and singing to the glory of God comes down but it's a big rock and roll show it's a big light show where did that come from that didn't come from the Bible that came from Hollywood I'm on their preaching is no longer amen a man getting behind the pulpit and yielding himself to the Holy Spirit and preaching wherever God leads him in and whenever God tells him to say oh no it's now controlled by some manual and some educated degree that the manhole where did that come from that did not come from the gene expression of God's word that came from a morally amen and spiritually perverse generation but my Bible says in the end time that God would restore our people Amen to the way it was in the beginning listen I don't care what denomination says they were not so in the beginning but whatever this word says was in the alpha and it'll be in the Omega bride there were signs and wonders in the beginning there'll be signs and wonders in the end they were shouting and Holy Ghost manifestation in the beginning and they'll be shouting and Holy Ghost manifestation in the Ammon now it's in the word that which discernment in the beginning and they'll be discernment in the end but it'll be by the word [Applause] are you hearing me this bride will not be under the influence of Hollywood light she will not bear the influence of educational line she will be walking under the glow of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you say how can you say that because Jesus was the glow of God can I say that like that Jesus was the glow of God he was not the shine of God he was the glow of God the part of God said then I've tried to think and make Jesus Christ my pattern he could have created fish he could have created money he could have made wine from water he could have had thousands but yet he didn't have a place to lay his head he was our example nothing to shine but something that glows the gospel do you see then this morning we are not here amen as animals that are attracted to shiny things the problem that God said that's what attracts animals into traps it's shiny things let me set you like this we are not chickens we are eagles therefore Eagles are not looking for shine they're looking for glow the prophet of God said the real gospel glows with power and Eagles hear that they don't look for a shine they look for a glow with humility and love and power amen that's what the real Eagle hunts you can't scratch in a barnyard and please him he'll never be able to do it you'll never tell him because he don't believe it but let the voice scream from Heaven I am he that was dead and is alive again and something takes place I am the same yesterday amen today and forever and it shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out myself upon All Flesh glory to God I'll Quicken your mortal language I'll Quicken your mortal tongues I'll give you the evidence that I'm going to bring you in the resurrection with me he said hungry hearted Eagles amen reach for that just as hard as they can it's the pearl of great price they sell everything to buy amen God help us he said our churches are losing their identification alone Church in the beginning the church was identified amen by the manifestation of God in the beginning the church was known amen for their courage and for their strength and for their for their stamina for the for their ability to persevere but brother Bob in the end time they become a bunch of hybrid sissies Amen to everyone are paying offensive and can't nobody work through nothing no more come on I'm on a preach this morning amen but we are not here as a hybridized hot bed plants we are here as the pride of Jesus Christ and I tell you what it's time to do it's time to come to maturity it's time to come to Authority it's time to come to adoption we have not come here Amen to become a bunch of offended sissified babies amen that throws up our hands and quits at the first sign of trouble but we're some hungry hearted Eagles this morning and we'll fight till we find some fresh meat we'll preach into the word amen opens up and fervor and strength and begins to put vitamins in the hearts of these hungry hearted Eagles our church amen I'm just going to preach if that's okay brother Sean Faith Tabernacle has not lost its identification we are still a Bible believing Holy Ghost preaching devil stomping message believing Church of the Living God Amen we may have gone through some troubles and we may have gone through some hurts but there's no devil in hell amen that can take away our identity vacation I said devil didn't give it to us and the devil can't take it away from us amen you may hurt us you may talk about us you may scandalize her name but there is a goal that is coming from an expression of a ging seed of almighty God on the inside of this church and there ain't no devil can put that fire out among Church trials don't change our identification can I preach to you hard days don't change her identification people coming and people are going let's not change our identification we are identified by one thing and that is the expression of the gene which was quickened by the message of the hour and there's no devil can change that expression I'm on now you got to know who you are can I preach to you you got to know who you are you got to quit letting every little thing change who you are either you're the bride or you're not either you're an overcomer or you're not but I know who you are cause I've been listening to a prophet talk about you and a prophet said you're an invincible Army he said you're more than a match for the devil not you amen but the god that's on the inside of you I'm on Church you got to come back to the landmark and remember who you are you were not put here to be a walking billboard for every little negative thing that flies through Faith Tabernacle you are not put here to be a billboard for every little thing get a thing that comes through this message you were put here to be a beacon of light in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation to let a dog to let a lost and Dying World know that there's still some real Christians that is left in the world there's still some people who's under the influence of the original light now when I start thinking about this radiant my Bible actually speaks of radiant lives in the Book of Job 11 chapter 13th verse he says if thou prepare thine heart stretch out my hands towards him if iniquity be in thy hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in my Tabernacles for then shalt thou lift up The Voice without spot Thou shalt be steadfast and shall not fear but oh my because Thou shalt forget thy misery amen and remember it remember it as the waters that pass away amen Thou shalt forget thy misery and forget it amen it shall be as the waters that pass away thine age shall be clearer than the Noonday amen lose this Thou shalt shine forth Thou shalt be as the morning Psalms 34 Verse 5 say yes they looked unto him and were lightened amen and their faces were not ashamed Amen in other words their troubles did not cause them to come embarrassed amen their their God amen amen they're hard times did not cause them to become ashamed amen but they were looking at something they were beholding something they were staring at something and as they were staring at it amen they were focused on it and as they were focused on it it began to influence them I'm on church amen if you stare at something amen it'll influence you if you stare at something it'll change it'll affect you I'm old now amen I'm just gonna preacher for a second you you're standing a store and you're staring at somebody you're just staring at him and then all of a sudden they look at you and shake their fist at you amen you know what that's going to do that's gonna affect you amen you're gonna respond to the way they responded to you come on now and I'll tell you what I think it's time to do I think it's time to stare at the manifestation of the world I think it's time to stare into the third pool I think it's time to stare into the seventh seal I think it's time to stare at Cold Cut I think it's time to stare into what a prophet said and let that become the influence of Our Lives let that become the identification of who we are amen look unto him and let that light lighten you and your face will not be ashamed look at Ecclesiastes 8 verse 1 who is as the wise man who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed Isaiah 62 verse 1 for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace I'm going to put your name there church amen Zion is the top of the Bride he said for the bride's sake I will not hold my peace for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the Salvation thereof amen as a lamp that burneth in other words God is telling you he's not going to lose his dedication to you he's not going to let you come into a time of a Dark Age of a promoted age and then turn his face on you amen but he's going to put a fire in you he's going to put a strength in you he's going to put an anointing upon you amen and he's not gonna back up until your bodies are changed come on let me just go and say this God is dedicated to you God is committed to this this minute decision about her he is committed to see that her body has changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye God is committed and designed God is committed unto this bride he's not going to go halfway and leave you he's going to take you all the way he's going to make good every promise that he spoke concern in your life amen I shout like David this morning Thy word is a lamp under my feet and I lied unto my path are you hearing me this morning amen it may get hard but follow the light can I preach to you it may get difficult amen but follow the light come on now stare at the star you remember in the Book of Matthew the second chapter the Bible speaks about three major eyes you know what the Bible says the Bible says this amen now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem and Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the east of Jerusalem saying where is he a man that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his what we have seen his star Amen in the East and are come to worship him we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him preaches the great Shining Light he said we find these Mages honest in their heart Desiring to see the one true God looking for his prophecy to be fulfilled when said that the Lord shall raise up him and a kingdom shall have no end it'll be an everlasting Kingdom it was at that time the star we know today is called star appeared in the sky among hungry hearted Believers were hungry to see the manifestation of Prophecy the Bible said there would be one raise up who would have a kingdom and to that Kingdom there would be no end it would be an everlasting Kingdom and something in that prophecy amen lit something in their souls and them hungry hearted Eagles started out to find the Fulfillment and the prophet said I can imagine that those many times with one Accord amen stood speechless as they looked at the phenomenon of a star listen that defied that one star defied the laws of the solar system that had come from the great consolation of the heavenly bodies to declare something amen something it was fixing to happen are you hearing me one star Amen brother Josiah defied an entire solar system one star appeared in the sky amen one star found out some Eagles one star ignited a journey on some major eyes to go find the fulfilled word and the prophet said I hope you can read between the lines that in this day I love this that is stay I'm on now brother Bob that star would return to the church and this day amen and God has defined everything to declare himself are you hearing me God he's defied governments to declare himself he has defied churches to declare himself he has defied the greatest amen religious system called the Roman Catholic church amen to defy him to declare himself in this age He Is Alive come on now he's alive my God is not dead sister Kimberly my God is alive he is raised from the dead and the prophet said see in his great Celestial body Now watch how he turns this the picture here of his being would defy every Infidel in the world come on he took that star brother shamai and connected it to that picture and said that star was in that picture I'm on that star was none other than the light of almighty God and that star was a Godly light that star was a light to light your path amen amen see he defied the solar system to declare himself among now in the beginning he defied the solar system with one star to declare his infinite being upon the Earth in the end time with one picture he is defied 900 denominations to announce to them that the god of the Bible is not in a museum somewhere but he's right here in his church and he's dressed in the Robes of his righteousness he's walking in the power of his resurrection among friends we are not able to help us hope us amen stargazers we have been identified by that star and Coke I'm on now amen I might as well preach to you that star has defined things in your family tree to get you to where you are today that star testified situations that the devil got you trapped into to see that you would sit here this morning under the influence of this message amen it's more than a star it's an announcement brother Daniel He's Alive forevermore it's an announcement that the great God has returned to the church and he's doing things in his own way but it's unusual I love having sex he says that star is relevant to today and he goes to Daniel the 12th chapter and the third verse and says they that be wise amen shall shine as the brightness of the permanent and that turned many to righteousness amen as the Stars forever and forever Prophet God asked the question what does the star mean to us today he said we are today then we are his Stars every born-again Christian is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ to reflect the power and Holiness of the Lord to reflect him in his life to perfect him in his speech to perfect him in his healing to perfect him in his Resurrection come on now to reflect him in every way he was reflected To Us by God the father he said what kind of star should you be he said this star was not Guided by its own power it was Guided by the celestial powers of almighty God that star was told that star was not in control by the maytags the magi's was not okay they were not in control of that star that star was in control of them and may I tell you this morning this message you're not in control of this message amen but this message is in control of you if you was in control of this message some of y'all wouldn't be sitting here this morning you didn't give up a long time ago because you've crossed too many mountains crossed too many hot deserts amen but because there was a seed in you that was connected to that star it was not you got in that scar it was that scar God knew and that star someday is going to lead you to the change of your body it's going to lead you to the loved ones and if God be on the way of the Grave it's going to lead you back to where you come from Hallelujah talking about a church that control of God I'm talking about a message that God has sanctioned by the visitation of his Angelic beings to this generation we're not in control of this car this star is leading us are you hearing me are you hearing me we cannot be ordinary come on now amen them three Mages were ordinary magized military to that star got a hold of him I'm come on they were just ordinary stargazers until that Supernatural star that defied the solar system got a hold of him he said we got to be unusual we cannot be usual because God's people are A peculiar people they have been through the ages although peculiar yet the star was brilliant not brilliant in the world's educational world's Affair but brilliant as the sacrifice before the Lord then what what are we to do then as stars rise and shine amen the light of God to the died in the depth of Darkness of this world we are to reflect and Shine the presence of the Lord Jesus in his resurrecting power as he is yesterday so he is today to reflect him listen remember then the star again I love this the star again when it finished its course it took no honor um I'm gonna think about that when the star finished its course it took no honor the star largest brought them in to their destination and showed them the perfect light and we as members of the body of Christ this morning friends we are God's light but we take no honor to ourselves when we get our patient or our person that we're leading when we got them we must just honor ourselves and lead them to the great and perfect Clyde which shine until out the way of every man that cometh in the world the lord Jesus Christ not a myth called Santa Claus not some church by the nomination but that true and Perfect Light amen Jesus Christ the son of the Living God can I tell you an Evidence amen that this message is a part of that star it was in Matthew the second chapter because that stole God Sean can I preach that star let that star was there when William Branham was born that star was there in the cabin that star many men a tree that light met him amen packing water to a moonshine still he was following that star that star took him to the Ohio river that star came down and spoke the word of the message of the end time coming amen that star went to Houston Coliseum and stood with him when the power of God was being challenged by an Infidel experience Spirit star amen stood with him around the world seven times and when he got ready to go off the scene he could stand there and say it's not me amen I was just standing here when he come by you know why because he was not about to start it was not about the man it was about to lie that was going to radiate through the Bride of Jesus Christ oh hear me this morning that star is not dead this message is not dead it's permeating it's radiating right here in Faith Tabernacle this morning come on when I see in that picture I see in this building when I see in this message I see in your face when I hear on them tapes I behold it permeating from the Flesh of Terry Horn permeating from the flesh permeating from the Flesh of Shalom this is not a man it's a word you're not just a church you are the radiant bride of Jesus Christ and it's putting off a light that is close in the darkness to back up oh somebody Praise Him somebody praise him we have seen his star and we've come to worship Him we have come to be an expression of the light of light of you saying preacher I'm saying you are a star your family may not think you are amen but a prophet said you are you are a star you know what John the Baptist was he was a star John 5 35 he John amen was a burning it was a burning and a Shining Light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light remember said John was the light but he was more than the light of Elijah in them had he wasn't Elijah's light but he was Elijah another form of vindicating the light see when Jesus come he said it was a bright and Shining Light for a season and you love to walk in his light but now watch John I messed them out I must go out amen notice this and he must increase he's the light he said I am the light of the world Amen see he's the light he's still the light of the world in the beginning what's the word the word was with God the Word was God why was he the light of the world if he'd come said he was Messiah he didn't do like the Bible said the Messiah would do then he wasn't the light of the world but it's the a Vindicated word that makes it Lie To The World the word Vindicated becomes the light to the world in other words John brother Sean was not a glare of the Messiah he was a reflection of the Messiah he was not a false conception or a false Mirage brother Judah of the Messiah amen he was a manifested beacon of light come on now you want to talk about crooked perverse generation look at the Pharisees and Sadducees you're not the first one that God has chosen to be a lighthouse in the midst of Darkness John was in the middle of religious amen pharisaic sadness amen lawyers and scribes and all kinds of tradition and John with a message stood there in the middle of that and said my commission is to make the high places low and the low place is high in order to give the Messiah a fit reception when the light that is the word comes in the manifestation I'm on church amen if you make a rational mistake amen like the Churchman of that day don't do that he said don't you think it's time that we stopped and considered what is light if we are light then don't you think it's time we stop and consider what is light the prophet of God can I tell you what a prophet said he said the Vindicated spoken word of God the light brother Shema is the Vindicated spoken word of God outside of that there's no light you cannot light in the Earth with flashlights it takes God's word that's made manifest he said see the s-o-n the son do you realize amen that your Bible was not wrote Under artificial light what do you mean I tell you what I mean you're like your Bible was not rode under electrical light because that light is artificial light come on now again darkness and darkness cover the face of the deep and God said let there be a light bulb let there be a lamp let there be a bulb no the Bible said let there be a son amen the original light was the Sun come on now what was the sun the sun amen if you trace it back amen is fire so the original light was fire in the beginning was fire if you trace it back what is this in this picture it is the pillar of fire here in the end time the original Bible light would return to the church and they would not be sitting here under man-made flashlights of Baptist and Methodist they would be seen here under the original light which is the fire of God that would allow their past it would light their families oh come on church I tell you what this morning that's why if the power went out we could still have church that's why the microphones went out and the blots wouldn't turn on we could still have church because we're not the hybrid Church depending upon artificial light we are the manifestation of the word born bride who has been restored to the original line which is the fire of God I'm on church that's why them Christians work cold because they was around too much power to get cold hello now amen what is light it's the spoken word of God Vindicated in the evening time it shall be light he said then what is light Sent for so you can see how to get around see where you're at what does Light Produce he said light produces life there can be no life outside of Life natural or spiritual then what is his word his word is the light and the life to this age can I say that his word is light and life now what did Jesus say he said I am the light military he could have very well said I am the word I am the light of the world that those that followeth me shall not work in darkness work but shall have the light of Life John 9 5 as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world the father God said they worship the one true God by what a sacred fire they watch the licking of the Blazers for they knew that the one true God Amen dwelt in light so the original light was power can can we can we agree on that brother Doug the original light was fired he said and that's true amen God dwells in light so what was God dwelling in before he come into a body called Jesus he was dwelling in a pillar of fire I'm on church that fire god and a man that fire gone into a flesh-born body I'm on Church amen and that fire is not in a picture this morning it's not just in heaven it's not just in a tomb in Jeffersonville it's not in a museum in Jeffersonville that fire has returned to flesh and it set our soul among Church how could Jeremiah stand there and say his word it's like a fire and it's set up in my bones amen because it's a unquenchable fire it's a burning fire it's a hot fire my God is an all-consuming fire and whatever will lay on the altar he will lick it up in the bleaches of his fire and he will change that from be a Darkness into being a manifested light God dwells in light when he was on Earth he manifested in flesh he said I am the light of the world because God was manifested through him and he was the LIE the pillar of fire that led Israel he was alive that struck Paul down on the road to Damascus he was alive that come to prison and Peter he's alive that's on that picture he's the light that's in my heart he's the life that's in this church he's the m Everlasting Light and in him is no Darkness come on now remember said where is that fire coming when you get up in the morning as a 50 some year old man and you don't feel like you can fix another day he said quickening power is already in your bones he said the fire of God Is In You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire what are you saying I'm saying like I said Wednesday Jesus is the word he is the concept of God expressed in flesh when God was truly revealed he was manifested in flesh remember said Jesus was all inspired prophets testimonies and all their prophecy was brought to light in his age come on now the Prophecies of Isaiah and Micah and Malachi and Zechariah and Moses all the prophets concerning the event of the Messiah was brought to light in a flesh body called Jesus he said he was the oh God he was the prophesied word let's say what he says here brother John on he lit up every candle of word that was in the Bible that was prophesied of him listen amen he come on now them words was controlling him amen he could not change those words he had to become those words when he read it he had to become it because it was the word spoken of him my then what is the word made flesh I'll tell you when the prophet said he said the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it come on now Isaiah 7 was concerning the Messiah amen Zechariah 9 concerning the Messiah Genesis 3 15 concerning the Messiah amen but Malachi 4 is concerning Messiah John 14 12 is concerning Messiah Mark the 16th chapter come on now amen to Luke the 17th chapter first Thessalonians 4 First Corinthians 15 Revelation 5 10 Revelation 21 them are not containing to the Messiah amen they are containing to the bride and the same better fire that quickened his body to Genesis 3 and Zechariah 9 and Malachi 4 is the same light and his return to the church and he's lighting the candles of God's word and you are becoming Revelation 10 you are becoming Luke 17 30. you are becoming the resurrection in John 11 chapter are you hearing me we are not about to help us hope us crooked perverted generation we are the bride radiating with the light of God the original fireborn light [Applause] his original lie has returned to his church this is the promise for his age the word made flesh can I say it to you like this or the word made manifest amen the word made manifest the manifested word or the manifestation of the word is the light of the age worry now can I just preach to you for a second I said that to put every devil out of here the word made flesh is the light of the age the part of God said Jehovah God created those things brought himself down to live in the human heart of you and I before he did he had to clean his Road who cleaned his road for him John the Baptist raise the high places down low back that up then lower the high places and raise the Low Places I got to be careful there we've had some discussions about going up to Florida are you hearing me amen he raised the Low Places and made the high places low he come down and showed them love notice what he did then then he broke his way right into the heart of man oh God and God I love how he says that he broke his way right into the heart of man and now God is in us we are his gospel on Earth the word made manifest is the gospel come on now there's a son of my church a church nominal amen which the promise said Billy Graham went to them he said see as it was in the days of Sodom there's Billy Graham g-r-a-h-a-m out there in the field but now he sends the messenger to the church elected Pentecostal elected pulled out not out there nominal church but the church elected the Holy Spirit moving in the church is what does the works that that wasn't that body of Flesh it probably vanished but it was God in that flesh come on now the prophet is showing you amen the God that was in the flesh called Melchizedek was the God Amen that changed the body of Abraham and Sarah to put him in the condition to fulfill the promised word amen showing that God God but do you see what that was it was a foreshadow I love the way but remember since these things that God would again somebody say God but again God would again dwell in the redeemed flesh of his church in the last days and would do the same sign as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man what would you see the manifestation of the word the word is sharper it is a discerner and if the word is manifested again today then won't it be Jesus today if a word is manifested again today then won't it be Jesus then what did he call you he did not call you miss Baptist he did not call you miss Pentecostal he said Mrs Jesus Christ amen why because the word the fire the light has become flesh in your flesh the layout of sin Church ages blind he says blind the what to the manifestation of the word that's why they're hollering for Revival and they're not getting nothing because they're blind to the source of Revival that has returned to the church amen but the manifestation of God I'm old church I'll tell you what I see in that picture I see the manifestation of God I'll tell you what I hear in Souls that are in prison when he stood there and be held Colorado amen them crowd Peaks and said we're on the seventh Peak at the continental divide the gospel must return East again I'll tell you what I see there I see the manifestation of God I'm about to explode up here I tell you what I hear on them seven seal tapes I hear the manifestation of God I'll pay you what I hear when I hear him say I'll turn my back to this congregation and you're so and so went to Dr so and so diagnosed with such and such sister Jane I hear the light the fire the manifestation of God at his return to this age but can I tell you this it's not just wanting to stay in book form it's not just one to be on tapes it's one to get out of the picture and get in flesh are you hearing me that is what makes you the manifestation of God the word Bride for the word groom he says in modern events May clear by prophecy we're living in that day when the manifestation of God has come to a different age than the Pentecostal age now let's not leave that open for somebody else to Define let's let a prophet Define it the bright Age The Bride age which would have what bright light come on now do you oh God help me Lord do you realize the bride age is an age that is not contaminated with artificial light the layout of sin Pentecostal age was contaminated with artificial light amen but you cannot come to maturity come on because you're not a church and it's a hotbed plan that is birthed in a greenhouse you are a genuine seed and you've got to have the nurture into the soul you got to have the sunlight of the Rays you got to have the water you got to have everything that a natural seed has to have so God had to call you out from under the influence of artificial light into the presence of the s o n that you can ripen and come to your full potential and could radiate the life of Jesus Christ oh somebody shout bright age bright age it's a different age it's gonna be on the manifestation of the Pentecostal age it's the bright age what is the word bride she is the manifestation of the hour not a Creed a living Oracle living attribute of God this play into the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living so Jesus the light of the world said ye are the light can I have a few more minutes Jesus the light of the world turned his disciples and said you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill notice this the promise said the moon and the son is husband and wife while the sun is gone it throws his light against the moon to give us a smaller light until the sun comes and when the sun comes the mood Fades out and Christ is the son who's gone to Glory but is shining on the church with the same kind of light he shine when he was here and the church is the light of the world until Jesus comes and it all melts together see today ye are the light of the world in his absence his presence is giving you light to shine with while he's here Reverend said see I'm talking about Messiah they are the light of the church today the light of the world you are a candle that sets on a hill a light that can be seen from everywhere we are the light can we can we say that together we are the LIE Orlando that seems pretty boastful we are the light what are you saying brother Matthew I'm saying this it is time Amen to start confession with conviction when a prophetess spoke over this church come on now I think it's time you can tell the difference between a confession and a conviction fish a confession by conviction I'll get it out in a minute amen somebody come and say oh I believe the message that's a confession amen but let but let somebody say what do you believe I believe the message of the hour I have become the word I eyes have been Open the Eyes that's more than just a confession that is a confession with some conviction behind it and I think it's time that our young people start confession who you are with more than just what I attend the church I go here no I think it's time to start saying I am a messiah at I think it's time to start saying I am an overcomer I think it's time to start saying what a prophet I think it's time for more than the preachers to take the gloves off and confess what a prophet said I think it's time for some Housewives Amen to take the gloves off and stand in their home and say I am a messiah and Satan take your hands off my baby I think it's time for some people that's a part of Faith Tabernacle to take the gloves off and stand on the confession amen that this church is a church that believes the message and Satan take your hands off of it I'm on church I think it's time some of y'all start confessing the Divine Healing promises with some conviction we've had enough weak confessions well brother Jr we need some confessions with some conviction I'm gonna preach around a few days confession with some conviction quit talking like a defeated Church entity lay out a sin it's a different age for you it's a different language for you it's a different season for you you're under a different light or you may get mad at

all the inward parts of the belly now do you realize what he's speaking thereof this is Bible commentary of No Authority take you to believe it it is a Divine Light it is a discovery light so the Divine Light comes into the soul of man and that light becomes a discovery light come on now that discovers all the things that's in the heart of man we could very quickly turn brother shamai and start preaching on doors in a door are you hearing me the part of God said see you now now one day one one commentator says that that spirit is speaking of the conscience well I love what the prophet said you can't sell anybody anything to eat unless they're hungry the only way the world will ever see Christ is when they see it in you and me the only way they'll ever see Christ their conscience are numb to the sunsets can the guy say it to you like this you've heard it for years you're the only thing standing between this world and tribulation judgment but can I tell you something else you're the only thing left upon the Earth that the world is not numb to see God in come on they're numb to the sunsets they don't see God they see a solar system they see a Big Bang Theory they're none to the trees they don't see God they hug them come on somebody or you hear me they don't see God in the wind they don't hear God in the creek amen but look he said they're numb to God in the call the birds to the leaves to the grass the flowers the music the message and so forth that we enjoy after we found Christ remember you are God's billboard you are God's advertising agent listen friends don't don't misunderstand me I don't have time to dig into this deep I'm not trying to go out on a leaf but you are The Mercy Seat of God the mercy seat is in the heart of the Bride come on now you're the last thing on the earth that the war oil has got a chance to see God in I'm about to shout all over this place you're the last saying among young lady quit being ashamed of that long hair you're the chance that some girl may see to be a real decent woman come on young man quit being ashamed of the morals and convictions that your Mom and Daddy's raised you under you are the last chance that this layout of age may have to see what a real Son of God is I'm on preachers amen don't be ashamed to stand behind a poor pen and quote what a prophet said you may be the last chance that somebody ever has to hear something Beyond artificial man-made denominational temper with lot somebody said well what do you believe I believe the message are you hearing me somebody say well I don't know I don't know if we ought to quote the message I think we ought to somebody say well we got visitors in the church so I think we ought to change our language come on now come on now are you hearing me I am an English-speaking American country boy raised in the hills of East Tennessee I have never gone to the country of Africa and tried to change my language I've with her and spoke what I speak but there's an interpreter there Amen to break it down so the people can understand what I'm here and we need some god-called preachers it'll get in the pulpit and forget who's visitors and forget who don't know about a prophet and say what a prophet said and let God who is The Interpreter of his own word take the language and break it down in the hearts of his people till they manifest something more than a Creed or an idea they manifest the attribute the gene expression of the radiant presence of almighty God come on now you ain't gonna change your language if you got an interpreter in the house come on our brother our brother here is it Ghana is it from Ghana gone to West Africa right amen God bless you hi brother go to Ghana sometime you have to go over and learn their language there's interpreters there come on friends you know why there's somebody that can break it down for you and I say this there's a man here who can break the lingo of this message down a guy got up not long ago well it's public I might as well say it well we just need some preachers that can get up and preach an hour without mentioning brother Brandon preach a hour without saying William Branham I think we need some preachers that's got the guts to say what a prophet said we've had enough sissies behind the pulpit we've had enough artificial revivals and artificial youth Gatherings we need some light to come back in the church you know why there's so much nonsense it's cause a bunch of men quit saying what a prophet of God said and the fire of God left the church there was no power to clean out the Devils there was no lie to scatter the roaches but there is a man here who can turn on the light there is a man here who can find redeemed flesh and manifest himself through it and Scatter the demons scatter Superstition scatter and believe and let Faith take preeminence in the heart turn on the light for God's sake somebody turn on the light somebody preached this message well brother Andrew you ain't gonna be Piper don't y'all know me better now now I don't care about popularity I care about what a prophet is said I'll tell you what we got about your cold intellectual sermons it's cause a bunch of artificial light come behind the pulpit and so we don't need anointed preaching we don't need anointed move of God but that is an artificial devil from the pits of hell well brother you better be careful careful about what your Baptist feelings not careful about that careful about this message it's the truth well now this message is the truth I'm not being rude I'm being bold I'm not being I'm not being arrogant I'm being truthful I do not care about denominational feelings I care about Vindicated spoken word you're the lie you're the candle oh God Boda says I'm closing here put it under a bushel no put it on a Candlestick and give it locked unto all that are in the house brother Andrew what are you saying I'm saying get these books off the shelf foreign this far I guess we'll just kill it right here won't we if your books had got more dust on them than your magazines you got a problem well glory to God somebody preach if you're if your iPhone playlist has got more worldly entertainment than it's got this message on it you got a problem don't put this message on the Shelf it ain't a tool Hey Brother Sean you know what I'm talking about can I get him say Well this message is like a two when you're done with it you put it on the Shelf this message ain't a tool this message is your source of life it's a candle it's a light it's a fire fire and the Bible said don't put it under a bushel put it on a Candlestick look here Nexus 25 31 I'm gonna I'm gonna tie this up here Thou shalt make a Candlestick of what pure gold I've beaten Works how about Candlestick be made his shine his branches his bowls his knobs his flowers shall be of what of the same somebody said it with me of the same everything that's in this Candlestick is going to be of the same in other words it's going to be original in other words it's going to be from the beginning in Exodus 26 35 thou shall set the table with the veil and the Candlestick over against the table on the side of the Tabernacle toward the South and thou shalt put the table on the North side 27-20 Exodus and now shall command the children of Israel that they bring the pure of olive oil beaten for the light Amen to cause the lamp to burn sometimes to burn to cause the lamp to burn when everything's going good to cause the lamp to burn when everybody's happy to cause the lamp to burn always now do you realize if you leave Exodus which is in what the beginning of the Bible and you go to Revelation which is what at the end of the Bible in 112 says I turn to see the voice that speak with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in what the midst of the seven candlesticks there was one like in the son of man he was clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about with perhaps with a golden girdle but then preachers in the seven Church ages he said the seven golden candlesticks had little lamps on top of them that did what they burnt oil Zechariah saw it in the vision the Jew and the Gentile the golden centers to all the branches see but the but the same olive tree that tame Olive Tree of course was broke off was what gave the Wild Olive Tree grafted into it notice this all represents the Holy Spirit he said we'll get in that little Mark of the people all represents the Holy Spirit what does he say in the third seal in Revelation 6 see thou touch not or hurt not amen the oil and the wine notices see thou hurt not the Holy Ghost and the revelation are you with me see thou hurt not the Holy Ghost and the stimulation that giveth Revelation he said notice these golden candlesticks this all poured into these candlesticks but the oil was put into the lamp to burn now Aaron if it was his duty to lock these lamps he said hold on now keep it real reverent and listen these lamps had to be lit by the fire that God had lit then pray tell me what was the fire that God had lit it was not in a it was not in a cigarette lighter it was not in a match come on now amen it was not amen a little a little torch or something the fire that God lit was the pillar of Fire come on now the pillar of fire had to light the thing because it's what God had lit but notice what Aaron's sons did oh God the Lord give me this yesterday about shout it all over my little study amen Aaron's sons went in with some strange fire amen there they are all the way in the Book of Leviticus they've got the original fire they a pillar of fire amen but they're already trying to bring Strange Fire in and they said we'll light these lamps with some strange fire and you know what God did he slew him at the door he would not allow his lamps to be Litton which trains fired in Leviticus 10 verse 1 and nadab and Abraham the sons of Aaron took either of them his censure and put fire therein and put incense their incense thereon and offered a strange fire before the Lord which he commanded them not and there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord come on Church The Strange Fire amen could not come on now it could not withstand the pillar of fire and God said you will not bring that Strange Fire and light it in the house of God look at what this word strange means it means of a woman strange a prostitute or a harlot in Revelation chapter 4 61 if somebody started into the holies of holies without coming through here he died see Aaron's sons took Strange Fire one day amen some denominational power when it was the nominational fire and they died at the door they brought Strange Fire which a prophet said was denominational power which that word strange was a harlot or a prostitute and the Catholic church is the mother of every one of them Revelation 17 she was a mother of harlech and couldn't been Sons they had to be daughters so the Protestant harmless nominations with her notice this the denominational fire could not come upon the true fire of God what are you saying preacher I'm saying this I think it's time that we salute and welcome the return of the original Power which is the original line back in the church which is making you an original church with the same sign same Wonder same word same power same sensation same manifestation act in the same kind of way those candlesticks or we'll find a little later represents this Heaven Church ages he says and each one of these little candlesticks had a little Cruise of all sitting there and this all burned on this candle now when one candle was lit by the fire of God they'd taken that candle and lit another one then set it down and it let the other one and then it lit one off that one off the other one off the other one till the last candle same oh same off same fire he says that burnt the oil they're in Ephesus they're in taitara they're in pergamus they're in laodicea he said the same Holy Spirit lit by the same God by the same fire the fire that fell on Pentecost has lit the candle the church through every age right on down now same fire same light same old same Radiance same presence same seed same word yeah what are you saying I'm saying you are the radiant bride of Jesus Christ can I say it to you like I believe it you're

remember we parked he parked over there he said he'd come in here and preached the message so strong said it changed me it it affected me he said I should not see him again what Sean Martin it was the

radiant bride of Jesus Christ in the life of the presence there's a there's a heart here sister Jane you may just feel like you're coming to church and getting up here and singing a few songs but I'm a witness when you got up this morning started singing I feel the presence in that office down there and that's one of my favorite songs I sit in concerts and heard people sing it and never felt what I heard what I felt down there this morning [Music] she's not on a bus touring around the world singing it but she's in the house of God and there's a Radiance about that lady there's a glow around her there's something permeating from there's there's something coming out of her and friends I don't believe you're just here taking up space I believe you're making a difference would you stand to your feet with this this morning I remember one time I was over in Phelps Kentucky brother Eddie Hurley's telling me a story he said he said years ago he said we went elk hunting with brother Shrewsbury he said we went out in this this place and we never stayed here before he said it was a cabin he said I didn't know really what we was getting into he so he went in there he said now brother Roy some of y'all probably remember hunting brother Roy he said back in them days you just went out there and all the Believers got together and hunted and had a good time he said but this time we went and they were standing in the cabin I think there were some early folks there and brother and he said I didn't really know what we was getting into when we walked in he said we walked in he said he was cussing and smoking and drinking he said I thought oh dear lord what have I got brother Roy into he said brother Roy walked in there he said him as a man of God walked around to every one of those men shook their hands and said my name's Roy Shrewsbury what's your name introduced himself to everyone but her then he said but Andrew he said by the time he got done he said the whole atmosphere was subdued he said by the time that week was over that man had them guys talking about Jesus [Music] listen it's more than a book it's more than a tape it's that word has found redeemed flesh in a bright body and is radiating the prophets hit those lamps all fit into one great big bowl one great big holder seven different seven different lamp holders come out of it and when they did each one of those lights was drawing from the main resource of his life of its life and his light was because it has been a candle dipped down in the main Barrel he says Oh what a beautiful picture of one of those Seven Stars it represented that with his life on fire with the Holy Ghost he said by faith he's burned with the Holy Ghost his life is a candle not a candy says but a wick that's dipped in the Holy Spirit into Christ and through that Wick he's drawing the life of God out to give Life Light to his church oh what a picture of the True Believer what kind of a lot he's given the same kind of light that was when the first candle was lit military I don't know about you but I'm thankful to be lit right oh is it that brother said over at our meetings this year we lit we lit friends

hillside Lord I'm speaking from my heart to the assembly this morning I know there's been some rough days some hard times but Lord all the hard times and rough days and difficult seasons cannot stop the glow in radiance of this message from shining forth and ultimately Satan that's what you're trying to do you're trying to put out the fire of God you're trying to silence the fire and silence the

can't eat says uh pray that they can get the nausea lesson so he can eat and they won't have to put feeding tube in his nose the inazia is because of the blood on the brain which is the same term as brain bleed said the last scan of the brain bleed last night showed an increase from five to eight thus the reason for increased nausea yesterday so they will continue to keep a close monitor of brain bleed they will scan the heart this afternoon to check on the aneurysm and also looking for any other possible trauma to the heart so he's got a he's got an aneurysm that the doctor didn't apparently didn't tell them about until this this time and so if it if it if if that bird
