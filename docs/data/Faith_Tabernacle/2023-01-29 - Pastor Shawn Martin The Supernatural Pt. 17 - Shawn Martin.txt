fault and see the need and Supply what we have need of a man and thank the Lord for that are you glad to be a Christian amen I think anyone ought to be glad to be a Christian if you've a man experienced the Lord amen I tell you it's something that we can't take for granted can't take this message for granted can take our being here this morning for granted it's just the grace of God and if you have a desire to serve the Lord in any little inkling to serve him and to believe what God has done in this age you're blessed you're blessed amen and we must never take these things for granted amen and the musicians can be dismissed today and appreciate all that the they do the hard work that the musicians do and song leaders and all the officers of the church and we certainly appreciate them and here's the cards is a very special thank you with sincere appreciation we deeply appreciate the cards flowers and prayers during our time of loss the thoughtfulness and love showed to us means more than we can say we love you all may God richly bless you brother Tim sister Martha and family amen and we we certainly love brother Tim and sister Martha and their family and just been a great help to not only me but to the church here and we certainly love them very much amen and uh tell you we uh enjoyed ourselves as we traveled it was a really fast trip what 2 000 miles and 48 hours and so we're a little droopy today but uh it was worth it and we got the 10th thanked the Lord and and I tell you though if brother Tim and and brother Shaman and Judah didn't go with me we'd been in trouble I uh we had to load that puppy up and and uh and it was heavy so uh sure thank the Lord for brothers amen that uh wanted who was able to go and uh brother Tim drove most of the way and and uh stayed awake and then brother shamaya drove us on in and so we certainly appreciate them very much and and tell you what it's nothing like good just good Fellowship a man just be able to talk about the Lord and and just to have Christian atmosphere when you're traveling and so it was just really nice and and so um Lord willing we're planning on putting the tent up two weeks before the meeting and so I will give you a uh let you know more about that but it'll be April 10th for those that would like to help us put it up and um looking forward to what God has in store for us amen and um the book of Ephesians the first chapter amen and we're going to read the 22nd and 23rd verses just so thankful that we could all come together today a man and it's amazing just how the devil will try to put everything in our way just to hinder us from coming to the house of God and we're glad that we persevered and and come anyways just just to glorify his name amen you know brother Brown talked about that you know I think it was in adoption of how that uh you know the tutor talking to the father and uh you know says I I put everything in his way you know and yet he would come to he'd come to church anyways come to the house of God and and uh you know and he just bragging about the sons of God and and I think God is bragging on us today amen and uh you know we shouldn't be here by any means and um I think it's a paradox when you get a people that are mortal that have trials and tribulations and still can praise God that's a paradox amen but you know what I think that's just a Wonder amen we could have every excuse not to come we could have every excuse not to you know uh in naturally speaking to even serve the Lord look how many people have all their excuses of why they don't serve God and they don't see any benefits whatsoever but here we are we see all the benefits even through all the trials you know we see the benefits and I say the the benefits outweigh uh far outweigh the trials that we go through amen but the book of Ephesians 1 and 22 it says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen let's just bow our heads talk to our Lord father it is a good day to serve you that good day to come to your house Lord just to offer thanks and if we would just go around and given the testimony of what you've done for us Lord this week we could stay here for hours Lord you've been so good and yet there's there's many things that you've done that we we aren't even aware of it's escaped or noticed but lord it's because you were with us that we can praise you and glorify you today and Lord I know that you've desired to meet with this father and we pray that you would just have your way Lord and let everything that is said and done be pleasing to you father take complete control of this service of my body Lord of Let It Be you that speak through these mortal lips may it be you that believe Lord through your people father and oh let it be all you we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the church says amen amen you can have your seats this morning and um you know I I certainly think it uh amazing that God would choose or what God would choose to make his church with and uh we know it's a supernatural Church it's a powerful Church but yet the the the what he made uh his church with is incredible unlearned men and women and and men and women that are full of faults and failures and you know when he started the church there in Pentecost there were people that didn't even know how to write their name uh ignored and unlearned and and they weren't much to look at and and and in this day is the same same way we're just the average person uh naturally speaking and these things but when it when it comes to the value uh that that God sees in us it's we are invaluable um the world may not see value uh but God sees value and I'm so glad for that if if he didn't see value in you he wouldn't have chose you a man but God saw the value and and he would call men and women to be his church to be his body a man and many times that becomes that's a paradox in itself and because here we are flesh and blood and and uh uh human and and full of faults and failures and subject to all kinds of things but yet God chose us uh uh to to be his body and and and as he did as he started that church on the day of Pentecost it was a supernatural happening it and he it was a supernatural work in in their lives and God God made them his church God took these people that were ignorant and unlearned that that were not just really valuable to society and uh he he would take them people and make them his church by uh uh coming into them God came into them a man and uh you know the the as we've read you know where it was a tongue of fire that rested upon each and every one of them a man and the prophet said that was God dividing himself up amen and and and and and to live in inside of them which made them his body ain't that right his church and and God knew he was going to have a church that's exactly why he he he redeemed uh uh man and that's the whole point of the work of Calvary and he would even prophesy Upon This Rock I'll build my church and and it would be that church that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against and and that rock is the Revelation that the church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ ain't that right it's it's it's about him not about us ain't that right it's about him God's church is about him and and not about us and that that's the Revelation is that we could see him and have a revelation of him amen and our own selves just diminish a man and and so we we find that it is a many-membered body and on that day he gave them a Heavenly language amen until they didn't know what they were saying as as the prophet said and and he gave them the abstract which showed that everything uh uh that that was against them had been taken away no everything was cleared off there was nothing against them and and and when God come into them it quickened their body it quickened their tongue it quickened their soul brother Branham said it quickened their bodies until they flew so close to Heaven till it quickened their body to speak in a language they never heard of before it quickened their bodies they spoke in a new Heavenly language they they were quickened into the presence of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost God's quickening power baptized them into that they were in the place of worship then to where they could worship the Sanhedrin and nothing else could ever bother them because they were quickened and notice how he puts it they were a new people amen they were not the same uh Peter was different he wasn't the same Mary uh Mary wasn't the same and and and we're so thankful for that amen you you would think that that uh her having being impregnated uh and and and and bearing the Messiah that would have changed her forever amen but she needed a Pentecostal experience to make her a different person ain't that right amen and no matter what experience comes to you you need a Pentecostal experience to change you forever and and that's what God wanted ain't that right and they didn't need someone to teach them how to cope with life they they didn't need somebody to teach them how to cope with their failures and mistakes and but they were quick and the prophet said to a new way of life aren't you glad for that a new way of life we were one one's uh uh living at uh One Life by the birth of our natural parents but when the Holy Ghost came it quickened us to a new way of life amen and that's the body of Jesus Christ amen the old man the old nature the old desires have died to a man and and we're so glad uh uh second Peter 5 17 we know it but Paul says if any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a creation New Creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new I think you get a new thought when you get the Holy Ghost I I think you get a new life when you get the Holy Ghost new desires new way of of language new way of of acting new way of of everything about you become is different ain't that right yes sir no more conforming to the world that's what we desired we we desired to be like the world we desire to be popular with the world we desire to have friends of the world we we desire to be understood by the world but you know what when the life of God came into us all them desires are gone we don't care what the world thinks of us we don't care what what our friends our neighbors think of us we don't we don't care if we're a number 10 on their chart or number one on their chart it doesn't matter to us as long as God is pleased with us can you say Amen uh uh I'd rather have him living in my life working through me amen I'd rather if if they call us a puppet let them call us a puppet but as long as I'm I'm used of God that's all that matters amen but we know it's a prisoner of Jesus Christ ain't that right so this creation nation of his uh uh it's a creation of his broad body and this is what the Pentecostal experience means amen you cannot get an a Pentecostal experience by joining a Pentecostal denomination that's that's not where we seek to to be uh uh but it's a supernatural thing uh that that that causes the uh Pentecostal experience and and I say to you only the elect can receive that Pentecostal experience I just believe that I think all that was up there in that upper room was the elect of God Amen no this wasn't Judas now the Judas Judas yes he he he worked miracles and and he he he performed uh cast Devils out and things like that but Judas wasn't there receiving a Pentecostal experience with uh with the rest of them because he wasn't predestinated seed he shouted as good as the rest of him did he danced as good as the rest of them did he said amen just as good as the rest of them did ain't that right amen he worked the Miracles just as good as the rest of them did but when it came to going up and receiving the Pentecostal experience he showed his colors hey ain't that right yes sir he couldn't go because you know the prophet said in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken and that's what the Pentecostal experience is about it's a quickening amen it's the Dynamics coming and quickening the mechanics yes sir so brother Brandon would tell us we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed everybody say we were seed therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn ain't that right so he says as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we everybody say even so we you know we we can we can look and talk about God being in Christ but but I'm so glad God would send a prophet to let us know what what is really going on in this hour even so we Eternal in his thoughts that's why you cannot die that's why eternal life had to come to you amen because you were Eternal in his thoughts amen God just didn't think of you one day as you you prayed a prayer amen or come to the altar started seeking for the Holy Ghost you were Eternal in the thoughts of God Amen see and and so in our turn we became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God are you the Son of God are you a daughter of God Amen see that's that that's something that was a a thought of God and here we are a manifested son and daughter of God Amen and that isn't by mistake ain't that right amen we we've talked about it and you know it but brother brother Brandon talks how Jesus was predestinated to be what he was so pretty no one could take his place many people had tried to take his place then he said well I'm that Messiah and I'm this and they would lead people out in the wilderness and they'd lead this and they would all perish amen with the leader and and these things but but because they tried they they tried to do something they weren't called to do but here was Jesus a man not trying at all he just was ain't that right and he just yielded to himself to the scriptures he yielded himself to the promise of the age because he believed in it do you believe that he believed in it he said the scripture spoke of him and he told them if you would just search the scriptures if you really believed it and and and really understood what the scripture said then searched them for their testifying of who I am amen they're the one that struggled with it they're the one that struggled with who he was because they didn't believe in him amen but he didn't struggle in who he was he just knew that the father had that spoke of him he knew that the father was with him he knew amen exactly that he was with the word can you say Amen well that's the same way with you and I amen uh uh uh we know we know we're not struggling to be a Christian we're not struggling to be sons of God you're You've Got Roots amen not in some family tree You've Got Roots in the mind of God that's where your roots came from that's where your Source comes that's where your start came from was in the mind of God he declared you to be a Son of God he he declared you to be his body in this age you ain't that right we know that God being a spirit he needs a body Amen to work through he needs hands he needs eyes he needs a mouth he needs feed amen he needs a body to express himself through ain't that right amen well he spoke the body of Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world Amen he said that will be the body that I will come and redeem my subjects to me but then he spoke of another body and he saw many membered body amen that would be his bride Not only would he be bridegroom but he says now I need a bride I need somebody that I can work through and they ain't going to be a redeemer they're going to be the redeemed amen they're not going to be bridegroomed but they'll be part of me and I will be the bride throughs him amen they'll manifest bright ship they'll manifest everything that I would speak about the bride of Christ and when he spoke of them things you were in his mind can you say amen amen so this isn't by Act accident amen now brother Brandon would tell us whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant again whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant a man and thens into fruits ain't that right so that's the law of God it's dark by seed let every seed bring forth of its own kind and it started the life that was in the seed amen came forth into the plant and now into the fruit amen the life amen and the very same law applies he says to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed and in these last days the true bright Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone ain't that right see the Pentecost did not come to The Headstone amen see they were seed it was God planting a Pentecostal seed but in this last days the true bright Church cry seed will come to The Headstone amen see and she will be the Super Church a super race do you believe that a super Church a super race you think of what they've done in the book of Acts look what this church amen is going to be what she is today she is a super race a super church because she has come to The Headstone yes sir as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image in this in order to be United with him they will be one everybody say they will be one they will be one amen I my father are one they will be one Hallelujah aren't you glad for that well do we got to work to get there absolutely not amen you were called to be there amen you were ordained to be there and no one can take your place people have tried to do it and they failed people have tried and they got burned out I've heard that you know through through my life of in the Pentecostal uh uh growing up people of getting burnt out and burn out this and preachers burn out and and musicians burn out and song leaders burn out and this burn out and and I thought oh my you know uh uh am I going to get burned out you know I don't know you know but then I found out that I was predestinated for this I can't get burned out Christians don't get burned out can you say man why it's something that's within them you know it'll last longer than your physical body will ever last that that experience that quickening I thought of brother Walker out of how feeble he is but you get him to talk about God or something that is just vibrating in him amen he gets excited about what he's doing you hear Brother Brown I'm talking about that old uh colored man that come up and he's feeling sorry for him and and thinking man why didn't you get somebody younger up there and he's just all been over him he said he got to preach in and he got excited and he jumped up clicked his heels together and said you ain't got enough room up here to preach and he said he had more room than what he had you know amen but what is it it's the fire of God that burns within and you cannot wear out you cannot burn out whatever God God has called you to do you wield to he's ordained for you to do can you say amen and it's something that is Supernatural you can't be held by man you can't be held back by man you didn't start by man and you won't end by man can you say amen that's exactly right so they're going to be near him amen they'll be in His image and this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God now I want you to notice Judas Judas now look at his life Judas when the spirit of God Came Upon him that Supernatural fell upon him he could cast out devils and and and and perform Miracles ain't that right but then we see what happened when the supernatural left him he betrayed our lord Jesus ain't that right carefus amen could prophesy and tell things that would come to pass amen when the supernatural rested upon Him amen but when the supernatural left him he offered Christ up to be crucified hey ain't that right yes sir he he didn't believe it at all he didn't believe that Jesus was the Vindicated word at all but he could do something when the supernatural was upon Him amen Balaam prophesied and foretold of things do you realize there to them things that he prophesied up are still coming to pass today amen a prophet but yet the Bible called him a false prophet but he could prophesy when the spirit of the Lord come upon him and be Act in his prophecy and tell exactly the things that are would come to pass but when the spirit of the Lord left him we see what he really was and he calls to Israel to stumble ain't that right to where God would never forgive them for their act of idolatry amen safe and so uh uh these men would return Amen to what they was before the supernatural Came Upon them amen but see we we find that that is different amen from the elect of God we find it is different a man from what happened on the day of Pentecost amen the spirit of God didn't just come upon them and cause them to dance and to shout and to speak in tongues and and to do whatever and then lived and and they were just the average person but Peter never did return back to his old life none of them men and women returned back to their old life hey ain't that right amen even before Pentecost before the Holy Ghost Came Upon them Peter denied the Lord that bought or denied the Lord denied him and that of even knowing him because he was scared that they would kill him too amen but look at the end of Peter's life amen knowing that they were going to crucify him amen he was walking out they're going to escape history says that as he was walking out of the city amen he meets the Lord and has uh and he's going up to the city and and Peter asked him Lord where are you going he says I'm going to be crucified again and and and it says that Peter understood what they what he meant by that and he turned around and went to the city and offered himself up Amen to be crucified and he told him if you're going to crucify me do not crucify me the way you've done the Lord amen crucify me upside down for I'm not not worthy Amen to be crucified the way he was amen a man that once had denied the Lord amen scared of being crucified now I'm full of the power and the unction of the Holy Ghost oh my that's that's what it'll do to you ain't that right amen see so we find uh the spirit of God the anointing uh anointing a person doesn't make them the body of Christ amen for we realize there's all kinds of anointed ones Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false christs false anointed ones ain't that right false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now I want you you know what the prophet said about the Antichrist he said the Antichrist will be Pentecost to the DOT ain't that right so people that don't believe in the Pentecostal experience amen even the Antichrist knows better than you do ain't that right they know better they say well we don't need gifts for Antichrist knows better than that nonsense well we don't need this we don't need the dancing and we don't need to shouting we don't need the Miracles we don't need the all of that the devil knows better than that amen but the Antichrist that deceiving spirit will be Pentecost to the dot ain't that right he said uh brother Brown said see the whole thing is in such a great conglomeration of every kind of mix-up and Satan with all of his kindness come in and impersonated just to the dot almost to the dot there's one only one way everybody say there's only one way only one way that you can absolutely be sure is check the word by word word by word that's the only way you can can you say amen amen so when they look at them people on the day of Pentecost and saw them doing what they done amen they all of a sudden the critics were were saying well they're drunk and they're this they're that but Peter understanding amen the the confusion amen and what they were trying to do they were trying to put this experience to some human thing amen but he would stand up and say no this is the word being made manifest can you say man it is the word being made manifest and God started his church by a Pentecostal experience amen and we as we read last Sunday the Pentecostal experience is his word made flesh in you can you say Amen it's his word made flesh in you yes sir and so we we find that they that they that was up there in the upper room that 120 and everyone after them a man that received the Pentecostal experience were changed they were changed can you say Amen they weren't trying to serve God on their intellect they were changed amen it's a supernatural happening you cannot make a carnal man cannot join this Bride of the Living God that it can amen we couldn't join it it took God to give us a supernatural birth living inside of us making the word live brother Branham says if you notice Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern that Moses saw on Mount Sinai in heaven when Moses when he returned from his vision pitched the tent and made it just exactly like he saw in heaven and when Solomon built the temple he made it just exactly the way he seen the pattern the type and Moses pitched the tent a Perpetual type because it was moved from place to place but Solomon he made the Tabernacle just exactly in the fashion that Moses had seen in heaven it was all put together set in order just exactly what a spiritual application we could apply here that we are never to leave the scripture stay exactly with the pattern that's the reason I believe that the way the first church was patterned that's the way the next one should be patterned that's the way everyone should be patterned just the way it was at the beginning and I just believe that God has it that way I believe the real church can you say Amen another place said what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that's the pattern see there is no other pattern everybody say there is no other pattern amen they want us to get us away from that Pentecostal beginning amen they want to steer us away but here's your Prophet saying if that is the pattern amen now tell me verbally tell me verbatim where he said I've changed that that ain't true amen we find it all all the way through this the devil that is telling us that the apostolic agencies it's the devil that is telling us get away from all that we don't need that junk anymore that's the devil that is doing that but he himself when he comes as the Antichrist spirit in this age he is Pentecost to the dot can you say Amen it's so close that it would deceive the elect ain't that right but what he thinks Pentecost to be amen uh uh he can't obey the word he cannot fulfill all the word ain't that right amen he's like a Judas that will walk with Jesus talk with Jesus you know so close with Jesus to where it that that when when Jesus said one of you will betray me everybody looked and says he said I they they had no inkling that he was referring to Judas it would be so close in this last day but Judas did not go to Pentecost he could not receive that Pentecostal experience ain't that right but every member of this body will receive the Pentecostal experience that's the only way you're going to make it in that to be this body of Jesus Christ you can be so smart you can educate and and educated in the Bible to where you know that Bible backward and forward you know the message backward and forward but until you receive a Pentecostal experience you are not part of the body of Jesus Christ can you say Amen yes sir I know they're trying to do it with psychology I know they're trying to amen uh and all they're doing is just keeping teaching us how to cope amen with life amen God doesn't want you to learn how to cope with life God wants you to cast them Devils out God wants you to defy them Devils God wants you to overcome every devil that is here in laodicea overcome the spirit of drunk overcome the spirit of flawless I think they call it flolic uh uh where it's just comedy and laughing and just reveling and and all these things and and God wants you to overcome them things amen and it doesn't mean you can't rejoice and be happy in the Lord amen but you getting your happiness off of Television amen shame on you amen you're getting your happiness off of these comedians I don't care if they're Christian comedians or what shame on you the joy of the Lord is our strength can you say Amen the joy of the Lord amen it's not entertainment that makes us happy amen it's not because we've got a a million dollars in the bank that makes us happy we ought to be happy if we've only got one dollar in the bank we ought to be happy just to be content in God knowing that he's done a work within us he's the joy he's the source of our joy ain't that right so what the church was that Pentecost is the standard he says no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close can you say Amen that's right and brother brown or Paul Peter said this this promises to you and to as many as the Lord thy God shall call and if God is still calling then this Pentecostal blessing is still for us the Pentecostal experience is still here can you say Amen so every person that is baptized into the body of Christ is quickened to the word now that that's not now the supernatural came on Judas but it didn't quickening do the word amen the supernatural Came Upon upon on Caiaphas and Balaam and and all these things but it didn't Quicken them to the word ain't that right oh yeah they they were able to do things uh foretell things prophesied dance Shout cast out Devils all these things but it never quickened them to the word you know what the Holy Spirit does for you and I hope this is all right today but I don't care if you're in the worst Valley of your life the worst trial the holy spirit is still there to keep you quick and do the word can you say amen amen and that's that's true we this this ups and downs all the time and ups and downs and all the time and and all these things that you know there's some people it you just want to stay away from if they're in The Valleys you you just you want to just stay away from them amen because you don't know what they're going to be like amen they they might be a monster one day you know and and then get back on the valley and they're just as sweet and kind and whatever see amen but see the word the Holy Ghost quickens us to the word and it's a constantly quicking it's a it's a constantly see and so the word seed the gene seed is in them and is quickened ain't that right that's that's what is quickened in US is the word seed that Gene seed thought of God is in us and it is quickened now the 120 they had to wait before they received the Holy Ghost and they had to tarry in the city of Jerusalem amen until they were endued for power from on high but you don't have to wait anymore you you don't have to tarry amen uh uh brother Brandon said that you don't they had to do that to wait for the day of Pentecost Amen to fulfill scriptures and these things see but you don't have to wait to receive the Holy Ghost amen but but you must receive exactly the same thing they received can you say man and if you receive what they received it will Quicken you to the word for this age you believe that see but but but don't sink for a moment that we are totally different than what they are or that we are receive something different than what they have received and and and that that the you know that that we are to cut all of that off from us and act as though it really didn't exist or that that is history amen because that was the work of God okay so you're right it was the work of God and if that same God that birthed that church and that's and done that that same God is going to be in us today do you believe that yes sir see so so the message of the hour I did not cut us off from what God started in the beginning what the message came to do is to cut us out of these denominations that we could come back to being what was in the beginning can you say man to cut us out of the Creeds and the dogmas and all of these things that that has been filtered through or has come out through the church and all of these things amen the message of the hour is here to cause us Amen to return to the power that the first church had forward brother Branham says in the last day in the in the last stage there will be a group rise up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day a gross a gross uh see in that day of gross Darkness the light will return by the pure word ain't that right pure word not by Dogma Creed nothing all that mixed up by pure word and we will return everybody say we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ did he lie about that nope that's exactly what we have today we will return back to the power of Pentecost a man to welcome back the holy the Lord Jesus Christ so again God planted his word and I'm not going to keep you long but God planted his word or uh a seed and the day of Pentecost it was a Pentecostal seed it was a perfect seed all the potentials laid in that seat ain't that right and and so the book of Acts showed as to what kind of seed it was that God planted but again they did not fulfill uh the prophecy that was foretold in the story of Ruth and Boaz they did not fulfill the prophecy that was foretold in the story of Esther they did not fulfill the prophecy that was foretold in the story of Ellie easier taking a man Rebecca amen uh to meet Isaac amen they didn't fulfill the prophecy that was foretold in the story where the double portion of Elijah's Spirit Came Upon Elisha ain't that right amen they were a perfect seed but they did not fulfill these these prophecies and and many more prophecies a man was not fulfilled many things that they did not fulfill for it had to wait until this time ain't that right see but the potential was there the penitential was there but yet they didn't do the Greater Works that Jesus said that we would do for it was for this day ain't that right now brother Brown talked to Elijah fixing to be taken up in the chariot uh and and he says he was tired and weary and there was a chariot hooked across the river to take him up home with the horses of fire and did you notice then when Elijah and Elisha crossed the river the school of prophets was up there watching and Elijah took his mantle and struck the river and when it did it divided and went across and he said to the young Prophet what are you following me for what do you wish see and he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me a double portion of that Mighty Prophet come up on me and he said you've asked the hard thing but if you see me when I go away then I will then it'll come upon you so you can just imagine how he wants the prophet now in that day that Prophet was the word for he was the manifestation of the word to the world and he knew there had to be a greater Ministry come because it required a greater thing you with me he knew there had to be something greater come for it required a greater thing and when Jesus was here on Earth see uh he said he was the Elijah see these things that I do shall you do also greater than these things shall you do because I go unto my father ain't that right so he's using this for a different type amen see because I go to my father now how are you going to do it watch him and who is he the word what's the word Keep Your Eyes Upon that word ain't that right watch him see and when it comes to creation of things it's true Jesus never writes straight out created anything and brought it into existence he took a substance first and he took water and made wine he took bread and made more bread he took fish and made more fish but everybody say but he promised a greater thing see he promised that greater things than this would be done you see now why it's in a more evil day than it was when he was here ain't that right it's in a more evil day than it was in in and and if Satan can get our minds off the Supernatural and just believe that them things don't happen anymore amen look where you're gonna stand but it's in a greater day it has it has to be a greater works for this is a more evil day than ever before it's a more in a more evil day than it was when he was here see it's still him everybody's saying still him it's still him it's still the same God but he's using your Tabernacle Hallelujah now we started God started building that church on the day of Pentecost to build a masterpiece a seed that he planted but we are living in the age where God has completed or is finishing his masterpiece do you believe that go listen to the masterpiece listen to it they without us cannot be made perfect amen the first church is resting upon us all the other Church ages are resting upon us can you say Amen the responsibility is upon your shoulders don't don't waver in in this keep your eyes upon the word ain't that right Satan's doing everything he can to stop this little bride but he ain't going to be able to stop it God has sent something greater remember when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard and when has the enemy come in like a flood in this age right now and you say man it didn't come in like a flood on the day of Pentecost he came in like a flood on this day he's been watching the enemy so don't think he's not don't think the enemy sneaks in unaware don't think you're in a you know you're in your trials and God doesn't know don't think you're being tempted and God doesn't know these things he knows it and he says and when he does come in like a flood I'll be there to raise up a standard and what is that standard he makes the word more real he makes the word more real the word becoming more real in your flesh than ever before [Music] ain't that right so we're at the finishing touches of the masterpiece yes and as Michelangelo you know now brother Brown talks about it in the Masterpiece about Michelangelo working all them years he had something in his mind and he he thought well I'm going to bring what is in my mind to reality and he labored and he labored he took old piece of Rock to make his masterpiece and and we could say that's what he done on the day of Pentecost he took a group of people start making something ain't that right and and we find that all of them years that he he labored he finally got it done and when he stood back he's tired and weary all them hours but he looked back and what was here was there in front of him and become so real he lost his senses and he struck it and then he was his hammer and said speak right speak he got so inspired by it oh my his his thoughts his his dreams he'd become a reality Abraham said see when it when it was completed he was so inspired by it till he thought his own Masterpiece should speak back to him and he struck it across the leg and hollered speak and it made a flaw on it made a flaw in the image now to me the flaw was what made it the masterpiece maybe to the mind that might think different you think that spoiled it but to me it made it what it was because of so many years of careful work and tolls and inspiration and so forth of making it his tools had proved not to be in vain it was perfect that's why cried outs speak because he had seen before him that he was able to achieve to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind and therefore under inspiration he done something out of the reason out of the ordinary he struck it in hall or speak see he wouldn't have done it if you if he had just thought but he didn't think it was inspiration of seeing what it's what he had in his mind setting there perfectly before him ate that right see what was in his mind had become real it become positive therefore it sprung into him and it was so real that he must cry out speak well then he goes into Jesus right how he was God's perfect Masterpiece what God had in his mind amen he labored and he labored all them years what two thousand years or 4 000 years he labored and he labored and he labored profit after profit patriarch after patriarch amen Through the Ages there he labored and then there stood the perfect Masterpiece what he had in his mind what he had ordained was there in reality before him Hallelujah he said the perfect one no fault in him at all you get a church no fault in him at all they found fault with him the religious found fault with him but when God looked at him there was no fault it was perfection what God had in his mind was standing there faultless so the perfect reflected the Builder himself see his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were won and so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then the even the image and the Builder became one ain't that right and what was he that perfect Masterpiece he was the Fulfillment of all the Old Testament scriptures that's right and it was on the mount Transfiguration that a voice come out of the cloud amen spoke from that cloud and said that this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to live in to dwell in right in whom I'm pleased to dwell in hear ye him ain't that right and it was just a few days after the prophet said that he was smitten at Calvary amen that's right the Bible says Isaiah says he was smitten of God he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity by his stripes we were healed Moses had the potential ain't that right Joseph had potential they all had the potentials for they reflected Jesus Christ David had the potentials but they was not the masterpiece amen they just was a portion of him ain't that right but when Jesus came on the scene the prophet said he was the Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment of everything God had promised he was the perfect identical image of the promise do you see where you're at now God could look at his promise in the word and look at Christ and say that's it ain't that right the word became flesh perfect perfect masterpiece yes yes sir you think of it when you look at the word you're this is a mirror you should see yourself well what what what about God looking in the in this mirror what are you gonna see he's gonna see you in the word I can't help it but when he looks at that word it looks at his promises he can't help and look at this bride look at you sitting this morning there they are it's Perfection again and you know what there's no fault God can't find fault with you [Applause] man may be able to find fault with you the church may be able to find fault with you but God can't find fault you are his workmanship you are the finale of what he's doing can you say Amen you see it's the thing that God's looking at God never looked at your sin God never looked at your failures he doesn't look at them now yes he's got an atonement there but don't think for a moment that he's just choosing you over everybody else and overlooking you like like maybe a parent does and overlooks all these your fault I'm telling you the truth there is no fault why you are his workmanship he's not looking at the natural he's looking at what he had in his mind can you say amen and we have come to what is in his mind the material or the thoughts of God has become material once again foreign [Applause] see therefore he was the perfect identical image of the promise therefore all Promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met in any of the prophets but it was met in the Masterpiece it matched everybody say it matched all that it said it was going to be Jesus Christ that perfect Masterpiece matched all scriptures [Applause] of what it said it would be now he doesn't just stop there and give us a history lesson he brings it on and says so will the church have to be a match to everything that God has promised can you say Amen God didn't now now listen you know God didn't just build establish a Pentecostal experience with the 120. I know you know there's some people say well they should they they could have made it in the Rapture and they could have been the Seven Seals was open in that time and all that I personally don't see it that way hey man there's only one time the angel of God opened up the the book and that was in this day in 1963 . can you say Amen there were too many scriptures to be fulfilled that they did not fulfill and and and don't think that God planned it and say well I was going to do it but they fail and so I can't do it now that's that's brother Ram tells us it was in the plan of God for that seed to be buried and die and rot can you say amen and if it didn't die we couldn't these other scriptures could not be fulfilled because we were predestinated to fulfill it we are the finale We Are The Rapture people amen so he said see so will the church have to be a match to everything that God has promised it must be the peace that smitten off of it so if the original is the word so will the subjects that's been taken from it be the word to match its side now that's where we stand today do you believe that that's where we stand notice he says he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled the new the new and old is his husband and wife and had taken the new or the old to foreshow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament right he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word started in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifest promised that had been given Joel 7 it or Joel said it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions what he would do in the last uh days two thousand last two thousand years notice it started out as the original as Jesus said the word of God is a seed that a sore sold he was the sower the seed was the word any seed that abides alone doesn't never does anything it's got to fall into the ground to bring forth its production again ain't that right you'll you'll never get an Apple just from a seed you can say it's an apple seed and it is but if you're wanting apples you better do something with that seed ain't that right and God planted a church seed and they had the potentials that in order to get what God really wanted in his mind that seed had to die and rot and come back up again right so he said see this seed that perfect Church fell to the ground that and I see a room when she become a denomination now historians remember you that's going to hear this state check it up and find out if see if it's right uh uh the church died and I see a Rome when she took dogmas and Creeds in the stead of the original word what was it God had showed by that first church that he was God he had a church perfected but the church like all other seeds must everybody say must fall into the ground and die now it fell into the ground and died and wasted away ain't that right and you know what the prophet said the denominations is your dirt that the seed was buried in the denominations was the dirt he said there is where the word was crucified and they accepted dogma and for hundreds and hundreds of years of Dark Ages the power and manifestation of the word was hid from the world and only Catholicism ruled ain't that right but then as we hear you know read the the seed shall not be aired with the shark and the other one the seed is not here with the shock in and so much you know brother bran brings that in and how the the seeds started to sprout yet in the mark in the days of Martin Luther right as a what tussle I think or stalking and then it came up a little bit more into John wesleys amen that that that coming from growing up now amen uh as the tussle see and yet these two stages didn't even look like anything like the seed at all ain't that right but then here come that Pentecostal age and we thought it was thought to be the real thing because it's looked so much like the seed but it wasn't seed because they don't denominated they went the way of traditions they went the way of creeds ain't that right yes sir see amen see so it it was the shock Amanda not the seed but brother Brown says now watch The Gospel is going to come out through Luther through Wesley into Pentecost and at the last days it'll deceive the very elected if possible the elected ain't that right oh Pentecostal Brethren can't you see the wheat in its first beginning is just like the seed when it begins to form uh they did uh form like the seed but it's the husk it denominated exactly done the same thing they did down here in Luther Revelation 17 it proves the same thing of the churches now the grains seed the in the original fell at nicia for it was the first denomination notice here the life that was in the stock tousle all now ends up in the seed the life that come out of the original seed come up through the different processes three different processes and then turns back till its original condition and today we are back to seed again Satan has tried his best to denominate this message tried his best you realize how hard Satan has worked he has been Sons he has been successful in every age to bring it back to denomination back to denomination so in this age he's doing everything possible to make us a denomination but it will never go to a denomination brother Brown said it won't it won't cause your seed again can you say Amen so just to think of that and I you know I was telling some ministers the other day I really appreciate them through all the false failures and disagreements and all these things that may be ministers have they talk about it in the backyard so to speak and I just had you know I'm on a group chat but I I told him man I just want to say I appreciate every one of you because it seemed like you know you're getting people getting you know especially minutes to get discouraged and doesn't look like they're doing anything and I was telling them I said you realize how Satan would love to denominate the people again hold him in bondage like he's done in for years and years and years but it's because of the ministry I just believe that because of the ministry that believe this message that even though there may be disagreements and there may be things that we all don't see eye to eye on we're still willing to put our arms around each other and call each other brother we're still willing to to say let's fight let's go let's do this thing hello and so I I appreciate them very much because it shows that we're back to seed again we are the seed everybody say we are the seed this this has a real meaning and and I'm hoping to get more into that because brother REM says you know tells us that everything is pulled away everything has pulled away and the seed is ripening in the presence of the Sun with that thought there is no time like now no greater time than to show Hebrews 13 8 to the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever one little ounce of unbelief one little ounce of whatever it kills it but a people on the Earth today is back to the original seed we've been cut away from all denominations and all Creeds and all all isms to where we can just accept the word for what it is whether we understand it or not we just say Amen to it if God said it I believe it that settles it can you say amen and the life of God is able to flow in the seed again all the life that is gathered brother Brown said that all the life is gathered in the seed again all the life of God is gathered in the seed again Anything is Possible can you say Amen we're not just in the days of Jesus that brother Brown said he's Jesus had a greater success in my Ministry than he did his own why this is the greater time for him it's a greater age it's a more evil age and it requires a more greater work do you believe that and where is he doing it just in a prophet absolutely not he's done it in a mini member body that's been cut away from all the isms and Creeds and denominations to where they're standing and the shuck has pulled away the Pentecostal shuck the denominations and all this has pulled away and yes we're standing alone but thank God for it because he's with us he's in US can you say Amen I think of it here we're called to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and yet God would choose us as mortal beings not super men women boys girls but just mortal human beings and he chooses us to show that he cannot change and yet we change we don't know what will happen in five minutes from now we are healthy today but could be sick tomorrow we could be on the Mountaintop today and be in the valley a week from now right we could be happy today nothing there to bother us and in 30 minutes now a tragedy hits our lives that turns our world upside down we never know we don't know the future we don't know all these things and yet God has called us to show the world that he is the same yesterday today and forever what a paradox and all the ups and downs that you go through does not change that fight that he is the same right so he chose us to be his body and he chose us so that his own life his own life can throw flow through us and if it doesn't then we're dead if the life would ever leave my body then I won't be able to talk I won't be able to see this body just lays there dormant and all the things that it used to do can't do it no more because the life is gone right I won't be able to hear you won't be able to see you wouldn't be able to communicate wouldn't be able to express the nature I wouldn't you'd say well where did Sean go you put the body in the ground but the light's gone right yes well that's the same way God wants to be known to be alive he wants to be aware he wants people to recognize that he's alive so he's got a body here on Earth that he puts his own life in and it quickens praise the Lord come on you see things different because it's his eyes now you see things different because it's his mouth now right yeah you as a carnal Man live in there but he's also living in there you hear things different because it's his ears you're quickened they got old dead corpse and bring life back in that it'll wake it'll move right well that's the same way the church has been dead and dead and dead but in this age that quickening life has come to Quicken us you believe it yes sir then if it's his life then what are we Messiah Messiah the anointed one ain't that right the last Commission because we're an honor to the word and the last commission Jesus said gave the church March 16 15 and said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believer then is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover do you believe that that scripture was not only for the first church that is for our day too Hallelujah and do you know what if every one of us boys and girls men and women if we've got that quickening power it quickens us to that scripture you young people don't have to say well well I I got to be a certain age no you can pray in which God do something ain't that right I remember my my first wife 10 years old just you know a Christian young Christian in the Lord and but she was excited about about God and and you know uh she used to play basketball and you know and and things and she told her mom says Mom I'm not doing that no more I'm not wearing shorts and things I'm I'm going to be a Christian you know of course her mom about had a cow and and uh but she said I'm I'm going to serve the Lord and so her you know people the children was was really persecuted or a lot made fun of her and things at school but didn't matter she's just going to serve the Lord and one of her chief persecutors came to her one day and says Rebecca I've known I know I've given you a hard time about you know the way you've been and you live and things but she said I've seen something real about you and she said you know I'm sorry for for giving you a hard time but she says I've got cancer and she said you know I just want to know if you'd pray for me remember said yeah I'll pray for you so right there in the school she laid hands on that girl and she prayed for now I don't know if she was 10 or a little older but at that time when that happened but it's prayed for and after a while I think it was six months or so after that that girl comes smiling she said Rebecca I've just been declared cancer free uh didn't even have to take chemo nothing just God touched me but that was that was a little girl that recognized who she was and that can happen to any of us here today see you're quick and do the word it's not by age it's it's by experience can you say man and and so we find and I'm I'm going to close if the musicians come but someone in question answers please explain he said people are saying brother Branham is more than a man he can create and Jesus can look just like brother Branham he said brother Graham replies this person said this he said whoever it might be I don't know but I am your brother Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person is now he goes on to talking later down he said now remember we are not the word but we are the word uh-huh now You Gotta See Jesus was not God but he was God he was a man yet he was God he could cry and yet he could raise the dead he could cry for a man being dead and raise him back again he was Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissa he was Jehovah all completely he was Jehovah and yet he was a man he on the earth made the Earth and yet had not a place to lay his head he said the birds that I made got nest and I haven't got a place to lay my head the foxes that I've created has hoes in the ground and I haven't got one myself to even to be buried in that's right he had to borrow somebody's grave to be buried in he created a womb that was in a woman and he had no womb to be born in he had to borrow a wound he craved the Earth and he had not a place to be buried in he had he had to borrow a hole in the ground to be buried in Joseph see and they had to borrow a place and yet he was God and prove that he was God you know you understand see we are Messiahs but not that Jesus he is our father we're just an owner with this spirit and that's the reason his life and that gets people if you don't sit and think it through it gets you know people to believe well this guy would be the Messiah sure he is this one over here could be they both are well how can that be two of them there's thousands of them but see you see his life is separated on the day of Pentecost and when that Pillar of Fire came down it separated like tongues and set up on each of them God dividing himself among his people because the church and Christ is one just as husband and wife is one ain't that right now I like this as we close but he said this he said now this person that's in you which is your birth you are John Dole you were born in a certain month you were born under a certain star you were born under a certain thing and that something that has something to do with you as a natural certainly does he said that's your birth path that's what you are a natural man a natural woman but when you're reborn again see see that's not the outside conscience the outside is what you see taste feel smell and hear but the inside of that is what you really are now this out here this old flesh Satan just tempts you and knocks you around every way here but down in here he can't do that [Applause] unless you let him do it right so how many goes through seasons in your life boy I go through him foreign go to bed happy wake up the next day I'm wondering what happened something tonight happened [Music] it could be a rainy day just dreary and it affects you all these things and Satan takes advantages of these things but that's only the outside but that inside he can never ever touch you aren't you glad for that [Music] and and and the Pentecostal age the Pentecostals they they always went for Sensations and emotions and feelings they had to feel good and if they didn't [Music] man just get out of their way [Music] they you know I mean and and I'll be honest and I I feel like that's how the preachers were able to control the people they get them to the Altar and them same people would be at the altar every time seek him for the Holy Ghost something that they once had and they lost it but we found out that if you ever get the Holy Ghost you can never lose it it'll never happen so then we find out that there there is a natural person that's us that natural person that Satan can mess with any time and when I say that he messed with our feelings he messes with our passions he messes with our emotions he messes with our memory I'm sure you've had it you've had maybe a terrible experience in your past and you could be just doing great and then somehow something triggers your memory to where you start dwelling on that before you know it you're not careful you'll lose your song you'll get down in the dumps all because of that memory but that's your natural that's just a natural side but inside see that's what you really are he said now this out here Satan just Tims you and knocks you around every way here but down here he can't do it unless you let him do it for in here you've got faith and Faith don't come come from the outer conscience and it reasons but in faith there is no reasons you got it from God aren't you glad for that you got it from God and you know it's there how many knows this there now look at it he says I don't care how much it looks wrong you still know it's right it's thus saith the Lord and there's nothing going to bother that nothing can bother that it's moving right straight on difficult means nothing to it wage right on through it for it's the word and the words The Sword and the word cuts the word Cuts itself free from everything else you're the body you're the body of Jesus Christ oh do you love him I'm so glad for our lord Jesus what song are we singing he's he's alive and well [Music] living in me to tell
