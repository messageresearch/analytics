[38:56] the sisters did so amen but Matthew the
[39:00] 20th chapter and the uh 20thth verse we
[39:04] can start
[39:07] there says then came to him the mother
[39:11] of Zed's children with her sons
[39:15] worshiping him and Desiring a certain
[39:18] thing of
[39:19] him and he said unto her what will
[39:22] thou she saith unto him grant that these
[39:26] my children or my two sons May sit the
[39:29] one on thy right hand and the other on
[39:31] the left in thy kingdom but Jesus
[39:35] answered and said you know not what you
[39:38] ask are you able to drink of the cup
[39:41] that I shall drink of and to be baptized
[39:44] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[39:48] they say unto him we are able and he
[39:50] saith unto them you shall indeed uh
[39:53] drink indeed of my cup and be baptized
[39:57] with the baptism that I'm baptized with
[39:59] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[40:01] left is not mine to give but it shall be
[40:04] given to them for whom it is prepared of
[40:07] my
[40:08] father and when the 10 heard it they
[40:10] were moved with indignation against the
[40:13] two Brethren but Jesus called them unto
[40:16] him and said you know that the princes
[40:18] of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
[40:22] them and they that are great exercise
[40:25] Authority upon them but it shall not be
[40:29] so among you but whosoever will be great
[40:33] among you let him be your minister and
[40:36] whosoever shall be Chief among you let
[40:38] him be your servant even as the son of
[40:42] man came not to be ministered unto but
[40:44] to minister and to give his life a
[40:47] ransom for many amen then we're going to
[40:51] go to the book of Philippians the 2
[40:55] chapter
[40:56] amen Philippians chapter
[41:07] 2 praise the
[41:13] Lord
[41:15] and we'll start at the first verse if
[41:18] there be any consolation in Christ if
[41:20] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[41:23] the spirit if any bowels and mercies
[41:27] fulfill you my joy that you be like
[41:28] minded having the same love being of one
[41:32] Accord and of one
[41:33] mind let nothing be done through Strife
[41:36] or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind
[41:39] Let each esteem other better than
[41:44] themselves look not every man on his own
[41:47] things but every man also on the things
[41:49] of others and let this mind be in you
[41:52] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[41:54] in the form of God thought it not
[41:57] robbery to be equal with God but made
[42:00] himself of no reputation and took upon
[42:02] him the form of a servant and was made
[42:05] in the likeness of men and being found
[42:07] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[42:10] and became obedient unto death even the
[42:13] death of the Cross amen let's just bow
[42:17] our heads and talk to our Lord
[42:22] father as we have come here this morning
[42:26] our hearts yearning for more of you and
[42:30] Lord we realize that is a supernatural
[42:34] thing it's a pull that only you could
[42:38] give to us for we're not here just as a
[42:42] society we're not
[42:44] here as a member of a
[42:47] club but Lord our hearts have a
[42:51] genuine hunger a genuine thirst to know
[42:56] you in a greater way father we want to
[43:00] reflect you in everything that we do
[43:03] that now Lord we just humble ourselves
[43:05] before you and ask for your grace and
[43:07] your mercy that you would Grant the
[43:09] desires of our heart and Lord that you
[43:12] would anoint both speaker and hearer and
[43:14] just help me to get myself out of the
[43:16] way and that you would anoint these lips
[43:19] of clay father oh God anoint our hearts
[43:22] and our ears to hear and receive of you
[43:25] we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name
[43:29] and the church says amen amen you can
[43:33] have your seats this
[43:36] morning and I'm going to continue on the
[43:38] subject of the son of man came to
[43:41] minister and this may seem Elementary to
[43:45] us um but I pray that
[43:51] um it'll be uh of some help to you uh I
[43:56] just have this on my heart and so uh but
[44:00] here we're we're looking at the the
[44:03] ministry of Jesus and we can
[44:07] identify um ourselves with that Ministry
[44:10] because we are to have the same
[44:13] Ministry so this speaks volumes for us
[44:17] uh for Jesus is saying I the son of man
[44:21] came not to be ministered
[44:25] to but to
[44:26] minister sometimes we focus upon our
[44:29] needs we focus upon our wants we focus
[44:33] upon ourselves and
[44:36] we demand or
[44:38] require that everybody help us everybody
[44:43] Focus their attention upon
[44:45] us and we forget that that's really not
[44:49] the kingdom of
[44:50] God and the reason why that we can
[44:54] Minister the reason why that we should
[44:57] be able to
[44:59] forget and and and I understand that
[45:02] that we all have needs
[45:04] here but we're not to to focus on
[45:09] them in in such a way to where uh that's
[45:13] that consumes
[45:15] us and the reason why is because we have
[45:18] promises we are taking care
[45:20] of I
[45:23] mean he's he's he's revealed we are the
[45:26] people that he's revealed himself to as
[45:29] Jehovah Gyra the Lord that would provide
[45:32] amen Jehovah Shalom our peace the god
[45:35] that Health us of all of our diseases
[45:39] forgives us of all of our iniquities he
[45:42] forgives us of our sins he's he's loosed
[45:45] us so there there are so many promises
[45:48] that we as Believers should be able to
[45:50] take comfort in Take Rest
[45:53] in to where that we just cast all of our
[45:56] cares upon Him and let him take care of
[46:00] it to where we can focus on needs of
[46:04] others and and
[46:06] so Jesus was sent of the father to
[46:09] redeem those that were lost there's a
[46:13] specific Ministry that Jesus had and
[46:16] that was to
[46:17] redeem and and the people that he came
[46:20] to redeem these people were wretched
[46:24] broken miserable
[46:26] scarred
[46:28] bound and he came to rescue them Lord so
[46:34] therefore he didn't live for himself he
[46:36] didn't think of
[46:38] himself he gave of
[46:40] himself and he came to minister but not
[46:44] in the way that man would do it for his
[46:48] ministry reflected the heart of God it
[46:51] revealed God Amen another thing that his
[46:54] ministry did it pleased God his ministry
[46:59] revealed God pleased God it reflected
[47:03] the heart of God it was a
[47:05] Ministry that stemmed from the love of
[47:09] God and reflected the love of God Amen
[47:13] what a Ministry a Ministry established
[47:16] based on the love of God God so loved
[47:20] that he
[47:21] gave ain't that right God so cared that
[47:26] would produce such a Ministry that Jesus
[47:29] had amen and and other other Ministries
[47:33] that man has
[47:35] established uh it's it's based on love
[47:38] and compassion for the most part but
[47:40] it's a human love it's it's a human
[47:43] compassion but Jesus came to do the will
[47:47] of the
[47:48] father he didn't just set out to do what
[47:53] he thought would be best but he come to
[47:56] do the will of the father for he said my
[47:58] meat is to do the will of of him that
[48:00] sent me and how many Ministries today
[48:04] whether it be just in the world or in
[48:07] churches or whatever that really do not
[48:09] reflect the will of the
[48:11] father but but his ministry did for he
[48:15] was sent of the father we know this
[48:18] scripture very well John
[48:20] 3:16 it tells us is why why the father
[48:23] sent him for God so loved the world
[48:27] ain't that right can you say that with
[48:28] me for God so loved the
[48:31] world he loved you did he
[48:34] not but then he didn't stop loving did
[48:37] heall he loved you but his love still
[48:41] he's Still
[48:42] Loving he's loving other people in need
[48:45] just like you were he's still trying to
[48:47] reach people just like
[48:49] you and so he so loved the world but not
[48:53] his love provided a solution ution and
[48:56] that was he would give his only begotten
[48:59] son that whosoever believeth in him
[49:02] should not perish but have everlasting
[49:04] life for God sent not his son into the
[49:07] world to condemn the world but that the
[49:09] world through him might be saved now we
[49:13] know the son was the Flesh of God uh he
[49:16] was the human Tabernacle that God dwelt
[49:18] in and so it it's it's actually God
[49:21] becoming human God so loved the world
[49:24] that he became human
[49:26] he produced the body that he could live
[49:29] in and that he could reflect himself
[49:31] through so so this would be a man that
[49:34] would be a total uh reflect something
[49:38] totally different than just normal men
[49:40] could could reflect amen man can reflect
[49:44] love but it it can only go to so far and
[49:47] it's it's all a perverted love that man
[49:49] can can do man can reflect compassion
[49:52] but but but but it's a it's a perverted
[49:54] compassion but God himself would become
[49:58] man and reflect a pure love a a pure
[50:02] compassion a a pure sympathy sympathy
[50:06] sympathy a a pure uh uh attribute ain't
[50:10] that right and so it was God in Christ
[50:14] reconciling the world unto
[50:16] himself God in Christ reconciling and he
[50:20] did not establish any other thing but
[50:23] his son he gave his son amen and that
[50:26] would be he would live in that son in
[50:29] his son that he could reconcile the
[50:32] world unto himself other Ministries are
[50:35] out there but but this is God
[50:38] reconciling the world to himself prise
[50:41] the Lord now John 1:1 in the beginning
[50:44] was the word and the Word was with God
[50:46] the Word was God 14th verse and the Word
[50:49] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the
[50:53] word was made flesh God made flesh and
[50:56] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[50:58] the glory of the only begotten of the
[51:00] father full of grace and truth ain't
[51:02] that right so the word made flesh
[51:06] reflected the heart of God the word made
[51:09] flesh and is this not what the word
[51:12] being today it's being made flesh in us
[51:16] the word made flesh reflected the love
[51:19] of God the word made flesh reflected the
[51:22] the the uh the the Deep of God the part
[51:27] of God it reflected God that has been
[51:30] hid from from ages and yet then God
[51:33] becomes flesh the word becomes flesh
[51:36] amen and and reflects what God was it it
[51:41] it was the
[51:43] ideal well the Bible says he was the
[51:46] image of the invisible god brother
[51:49] Brandon would say it the visible image
[51:51] he was the visible image of the
[51:54] invisible God God ain't that right amen
[51:57] God is the spirit amen but now God took
[52:01] on form of a man and everything God was
[52:05] was reflected through that man do you
[52:08] believe that he became the visible image
[52:11] of God Amen so so brother Brandon would
[52:16] say Jesus so loved the enemy that he
[52:19] gave his life for the condemned to save
[52:23] those who were unkind to him him and
[52:26] prayed on the cross father forgive them
[52:28] for they e they don't even know what
[52:30] they're doing they couldn't understand
[52:33] him I'm talking about people just like
[52:35] you they couldn't understand him see he
[52:39] was his preaching was misunderstood his
[52:42] life was misunderstood his speech was
[52:46] misunderstood they didn't even
[52:48] understand him and them are the people
[52:50] he died
[52:51] for he didn't wait for them to
[52:54] understand him he didn't wait for them
[52:55] to accept him he didn't wait for Amen to
[52:58] see what they would do he just died for
[53:01] them because he so loved the
[53:05] world he died for
[53:07] Sinners he died for the Unholy he died
[53:11] for the nobodies The Wretched The
[53:13] Impossibles he died for them you believe
[53:17] it and and and and then the prophet
[53:20] would tell us there there will be nobody
[53:23] there can be there cannot anyone who
[53:26] could love the way Jesus
[53:29] loved because it's such a pure love
[53:32] ain't that right and so he he would say
[53:35] it this way from the very first time his
[53:37] little baby hand stroke those pretty
[53:40] cheeks of his beautiful mother he was
[53:43] love from that till he forgive His Last
[53:46] Enemy on the cross he was God's
[53:49] expression of love no one could love
[53:53] like Jesus see God God being manifested
[53:56] in a little tiny baby come in order to
[53:59] take away the sins of the world and when
[54:01] you just speak the word Jesus there's
[54:04] something about it that means
[54:07] love Jesus means love can you say amen
[54:11] amen and and and we are not called
[54:14] Baptists we're not called Pentecostals
[54:16] we're not called any other thing than
[54:19] Miss Jesus Christ we bear that same
[54:23] name do you believe it
[54:25] we bear the same name see and no one see
[54:29] and so he says that's what the world
[54:31] needs more today is not a Jesus of some
[54:35] past
[54:36] tense not not a memorial not another
[54:40] play and and we're not against them
[54:42] things of plays and things uh if it's
[54:45] done right and things but but it's it's
[54:48] it's that's not what the world
[54:52] needs they don't need a Jesus of past
[54:55] tense they need a Jesus of
[54:58] today do you believe it see so it the
[55:02] world needs more world uh what the world
[55:05] needs more today is not a Jesus of some
[55:08] past T some Jesus of of some high ethics
[55:12] but a Jesus of love that can be
[55:15] expressed in the Church of the Lord
[55:18] Jesus especially as its members one to
[55:22] another ought to always greet one
[55:25] another in
[55:28] love
[55:31] Hallelujah can you say amen I think it
[55:34] starts at
[55:35] home I think we shouldn't just call
[55:37] someone well
[55:39] Sam you know it should be Brother
[55:42] Sam we shouldn't just just throw our
[55:45] name each other's names around it it
[55:48] should be a brother it should be sister
[55:50] it should be said with
[55:54] respect can you say
[55:56] Amen see and so uh um it's it's very
[56:01] easy and and I think we can
[56:04] all
[56:07] um
[56:10] agree it's very easy for us to love
[56:13] someone that loves
[56:16] us we can love someone that doesn't hurt
[56:20] us we can love someone that doesn't
[56:23] misunderstand us we can love someone
[56:25] that we can be relaxed
[56:27] around relaxed when we're around
[56:30] them we can love someone who doesn't
[56:33] criticize us complain and
[56:38] question I think I you know um been here
[56:42] 12 years
[56:44] and the more I just
[56:47] hear of the history around in this
[56:52] area
[56:53] um
[56:57] I think all of us have uh endured or
[57:01] been in one way or another and it's it's
[57:04] human but yet it's with in the message
[57:07] around here been hurt been been
[57:10] scarred have got a past
[57:15] and and so many have left the message
[57:19] just because of past
[57:21] actions uh bad experiences
[57:25] and they're
[57:27] hardened they don't want nothing to do
[57:30] with the message they don't want to do
[57:32] anything with God or if they do they
[57:34] just go back to a a
[57:37] nominal church or whatever and to me
[57:43] it's it's sad because they didn't really
[57:45] get the taste of what the real message
[57:52] is but you're here
[57:55] you you you could have turned aside just
[57:58] like others you could have found all
[58:00] kinds of excuses I've talk to and not
[58:03] just here but around the nation of of
[58:07] people that won't even go to church
[58:09] because of past experiences with
[58:12] Ministry uh
[58:14] confusions um it's just just all kinds
[58:17] of
[58:19] things and
[58:23] um it and and and and the wounds are
[58:28] there and yet yet you know you you have
[58:33] come from different backgrounds and and
[58:35] things and and um you're you're still
[58:39] pressing the battle
[58:40] amen hallelujah and you know
[58:45] uh we can build on
[58:48] hurts we we can build our whole life our
[58:52] whole actions upon the wrong wrongs the
[58:55] misunderstandings the scars the all of
[58:58] these things and and and to be
[59:01] honest
[59:04] um if we're not careful we can start
[59:07] using excuses for these things we we
[59:10] it's so easy to become a
[59:12] recluse it it's so easy just to hide
[59:15] within ourselves so we don't get hurt no
[59:18] more so that we don't get scarred that
[59:21] that that someone won't wound us again
[59:23] or or whatever it's
[59:25] and and and and and and it's hard even
[59:28] to the point that we we can even get to
[59:30] a place that we don't
[59:32] trust that that we don't
[59:35] um that we don't give
[59:41] anymore there's been very few men that I
[59:45] have seen wounded scarred
[59:49] hurt go through things in life and one
[59:52] of them is my dad
[59:55] and of course mom but but I've seen the
[59:58] things that have been done
[1:00:03] said you
[1:00:06] know he stood with the pastor for 30
[1:00:09] some years built that church from ground
[1:00:13] up labored very
[1:00:16] hard and he stood with that and because
[1:00:21] he stood with the pastor those that were
[1:00:23] against the pastor anytime that Dad
[1:00:25] would preach I remember it dad always
[1:00:27] preached you know Tuesday nights uh we
[1:00:31] had Tuesday night Thursday night Sunday
[1:00:33] mornings Sunday nights and then in
[1:00:35] between prayer
[1:00:36] meetings and uh we was at church
[1:00:41] constantly and but
[1:00:43] um soon as I I remember as a boy as soon
[1:00:46] as Dad get up and preach several people
[1:00:48] just up and walk out and they they
[1:00:50] wanted just to show something to him
[1:00:52] they wanted to send a message and and
[1:00:55] you know and then of all the times you
[1:00:57] know that that Dad would stand for the
[1:01:00] pastor you know and all that Pastor
[1:01:02] kicks him out of his home don't don't
[1:01:05] you know don't come back and I remember
[1:01:07] dad said I'll never go back by George
[1:01:10] you
[1:01:11] know and
[1:01:14] uh you know and it was over you know Dad
[1:01:17] believed in Grace Pastor hadn't come
[1:01:19] into that
[1:01:20] yet and and then it was the second time
[1:01:24] us boys we'd come into the message
[1:01:26] Pastor didn't say he thought we went wo
[1:01:29] so he wanted dad to straighten us boys
[1:01:32] out and dad says I ain't doing it then
[1:01:34] what they're doing is right and they got
[1:01:37] you know it it got a little heated and
[1:01:40] and he got kicked out got kicked
[1:01:43] out and and I've I've seen him I've seen
[1:01:46] a life of of just constant constant not
[1:01:50] not just just with that but other things
[1:01:53] and and and one thing that that I've
[1:01:56] noticed about Dad that I've I've prayed
[1:02:00] that God would let me be that and that
[1:02:02] is that that always came back dad always
[1:02:06] came back dad always fought for love God
[1:02:09] dad always fought for Unity that always
[1:02:11] pushed past the hurts and a past the
[1:02:14] scars and a past the words and a past
[1:02:16] the attitudes and the past to where even
[1:02:20] even our our pastor former Pastor you I
[1:02:23] think most most of y'all know what he
[1:02:25] done you know he ended his wife's life
[1:02:27] and and ended his own life and what a
[1:02:30] shame what embarrassment and dad you
[1:02:33] know Dad could have had by all right say
[1:02:35] see I knew he was a scumbag I knew it
[1:02:38] you know cuz us boys you know we we had
[1:02:40] some pretty thoughts about this you know
[1:02:43] when I heard about I just I cried and I
[1:02:45] was I was mad than the Hornet why would
[1:02:47] he if he want to do his own self that's
[1:02:49] fine but don't take sister Donna you
[1:02:51] know she's like a second mother to me
[1:02:53] and and so we you know so we had these
[1:02:56] things and and and then of all things
[1:02:58] they asked Dad to preach the funeral and
[1:03:00] we're all there all these critics are
[1:03:02] all there you know and and from all
[1:03:05] these years people that I've growed up
[1:03:08] with all my life and there they are you
[1:03:10] know and and it must have you know I
[1:03:13] seemed like a Victorious time for all
[1:03:15] everybody and then Dad would start
[1:03:17] telling about the things of that brother
[1:03:19] burst was and how good he was and what a
[1:03:21] man he was and how he loved this gospel
[1:03:25] and you know I mean you know and then
[1:03:27] he'd say you know he says I've always
[1:03:28] had his back and he says you know he
[1:03:31] says I Brother David you know and he
[1:03:33] just yells out Brother David he said I
[1:03:35] still got your back you know and I
[1:03:37] thought now there's there's Dad that's
[1:03:39] that's dad now now Dad could have Dad
[1:03:43] could have sold them seeds in my life of
[1:03:45] bitterness he could have sold uh hate
[1:03:48] toward that man he could have sold all
[1:03:51] kinds of of things in our life
[1:03:55] uh uh that that um would have caused us
[1:03:59] to to hate that man to despise that
[1:04:02] church to despise it all but Dad in
[1:04:06] everything I was talking to him just you
[1:04:08] know a couple months back and he said
[1:04:10] you know why I said dad why why didn't
[1:04:12] you just walk away why did you just keep
[1:04:14] coming back he said well for one he said
[1:04:17] I remember my grand my dad got bitter
[1:04:19] and he said I refused to get bitter I
[1:04:21] just would not get bitter he said I
[1:04:23] fought bitterness all my life and I
[1:04:25] won't get bitter he said but then also
[1:04:28] he said I knew y'all were coming uput
[1:04:30] and he said my actions depended on you
[1:04:32] all or what you all would be would
[1:04:34] depend upon what I did and how I reacted
[1:04:37] and how you know and I look back and I
[1:04:39] say thank God for a dad that that that
[1:04:42] through all of his failures now he was
[1:04:45] not a perfect dad I could just stand
[1:04:47] here and tell you everything about my
[1:04:48] dad amen and and and y'all may not like
[1:04:51] him afterward I don't know but but what
[1:04:53] would be the point point of it you
[1:04:56] understand what I'm saying and and we've
[1:04:57] all got our failures we've all got our
[1:05:00] our our our things that are just and we
[1:05:02] regret I've seen my dad cry and I've
[1:05:04] seen him you know weep over things that
[1:05:07] maybe you know uh uh uh that that he
[1:05:10] knew he had made mistakes on and all
[1:05:12] that but I've seen the man get back up
[1:05:14] and keep pressing on you understand what
[1:05:17] I'm saying and it wasn't for his benefit
[1:05:20] it was for my benefit it was for
[1:05:22] Wendell's benefit alen's benefit
[1:05:24] Jonathan's benefit and not only that it
[1:05:26] was for his grandchildren's benefit and
[1:05:29] and and I look at him and now that that
[1:05:31] he's got this Parkinson and he's shaking
[1:05:33] he can barely talk barely walk and
[1:05:35] anytime now anytime that that you go
[1:05:38] talk to him he barely whispering but
[1:05:40] he's going to crack a joke or he's going
[1:05:42] to talk about the Lord he you never find
[1:05:45] him talking negative and you know why
[1:05:49] because he's got grandchildren coming up
[1:05:51] he's got somebody that is watching him
[1:05:55] you understand what I'm saying Ministry
[1:05:56] is not always behind the
[1:06:01] pulpit and so he he would push aside all
[1:06:04] of these things thinking amen of others
[1:06:07] thinking of others well so so here and I
[1:06:10] hope that's okay to say that but but it
[1:06:13] we can love someone who doesn't
[1:06:15] criticize us but but for someone that
[1:06:17] would criticize us someone that
[1:06:19] would complexes complexes are built up
[1:06:24] by words that are said by by things that
[1:06:27] are done by by all of these things we
[1:06:29] build complexes and and there's plenty
[1:06:32] of people to build complexes in our
[1:06:34] lives there's there's plenty of things
[1:06:37] that that that we could take and use as
[1:06:39] excuses church can you say amen and and
[1:06:43] if we're not careful then we become just
[1:06:45] us for and no more amen and and we lose
[1:06:48] the value of souls because we're so
[1:06:51] caught up in our own problems and our
[1:06:53] own own needs and our own things and God
[1:06:57] never called us to be that that's right
[1:06:59] amen that's
[1:07:01] right amen yes now the prophet said
[1:07:05] Jesus didn't have that kind of love what
[1:07:09] kind of love love that would love
[1:07:11] somebody that loved
[1:07:13] him he said he had God's love and God
[1:07:17] loved his enemies for God so loved the
[1:07:20] world when the world was unlovable God
[1:07:23] still loved the world world and you say
[1:07:25] Amen as I was saying last Sunday he was
[1:07:28] despised and rejected and yet he didn't
[1:07:30] allow bitterness to take root in him he
[1:07:33] was mocked scorned and laughed at and
[1:07:36] yet he didn't allow the hurt to harden
[1:07:38] his heart that's right amen he felt the
[1:07:41] pain from being rejected and and and and
[1:07:45] despised he he felt that because he was
[1:07:48] a man of of of of Sor he was a man of of
[1:07:52] grief he was a man that goes through
[1:07:54] kinds of things that we all go through
[1:07:57] God wanted to know what you go through
[1:08:00] God wanted to know what you suffer God
[1:08:03] wanted to know the trials that you go
[1:08:06] through can you say Amen so he had to
[1:08:09] feel he had to feel the pain and not
[1:08:12] just pain in the flesh he had to feel
[1:08:14] the pain in his Spirit he had to feel
[1:08:17] amen the the the hurt that word that
[1:08:20] come from words and he had to know the
[1:08:22] pain that comes from rejection he had to
[1:08:25] know the scars amen that that you and
[1:08:28] all all of us deal with can you say amen
[1:08:32] he he had to know that so it wasn't an
[1:08:35] easy life for him amen and yet he come
[1:08:39] with one purpose not to be minister to
[1:08:42] but to minister so through all the pain
[1:08:44] and all the suffering and all the agony
[1:08:47] and all the rejection he came to
[1:08:49] minister he never forgot that can you
[1:08:52] say amen he never stopped focusing upon
[1:08:55] what his mission was Amen to where he
[1:08:57] turned it all to himself and said well
[1:08:59] why if I get back up there and preach
[1:09:01] you're going to re are going to walk
[1:09:02] away well why do it no he did it he did
[1:09:06] it he did it for you and
[1:09:10] I praise the
[1:09:12] Lord
[1:09:14] Hall it wasn't easy for him to live this
[1:09:18] life but he it was a life of
[1:09:20] ministry a life of serving
[1:09:24] as we
[1:09:25] know he could have called 10,000 angels
[1:09:28] to come down and set him free deliver
[1:09:30] him to where he wouldn't have even had
[1:09:32] to be arrested amen there in the Garden
[1:09:35] of
[1:09:37] Gethsemane he could have been kept from
[1:09:39] being evily mistreated by his so-called
[1:09:46] friend
[1:09:49] but Paul says that he endured the
[1:09:52] cross and despised the shame I looked up
[1:09:57] that word despised it means
[1:10:00] ignored he endured the cross and ignored
[1:10:04] the shame thank you Lord
[1:10:07] ignored they stripped his clothes from
[1:10:10] him there he hung there as as a laughing
[1:10:14] stock the god of
[1:10:17] heaven and there he was everybody
[1:10:20] spitting on him but he ignored it praise
[1:10:22] the Lord
[1:10:24] ignored
[1:10:25] it Lord Paul in speaking of Jesus said
[1:10:28] he endured such contradiction of
[1:10:31] Sinners against himself one one uh um um
[1:10:37] one translation says he endured from
[1:10:39] Sinners such Grievous opposition and
[1:10:43] bitter hostility against himself yeah
[1:10:46] see so so then we we we look at this
[1:10:50] ministry takes enduring yeah he that
[1:10:55] endureth to the end the same shall be
[1:10:57] saved not just enduring being Christian
[1:11:01] enduring going to
[1:11:03] church but enduring in what God called
[1:11:06] you to
[1:11:07] do you you we all started out when we
[1:11:11] come to the calvary when we come to the
[1:11:13] altar when we gave our hearts to the
[1:11:14] Lord wherever it was we all started out
[1:11:17] clean feeling great
[1:11:20] fresh y'all remember
[1:11:22] it burdens rode away no guilt we loved
[1:11:28] everyone we want to tell
[1:11:32] everyone ain't that right so we start
[1:11:35] out that
[1:11:36] way we start out with that love we start
[1:11:39] out with that Zeal we started out with
[1:11:42] wanting to tell everybody what God done
[1:11:44] for us we started out believing every
[1:11:47] promise in the book we started out with
[1:11:50] such such faith and and desire to know
[1:11:53] more of
[1:11:54] God he that endureth to the
[1:11:58] end can you say Amen not someone that
[1:12:02] starts out this way and ends up a bitter
[1:12:04] old
[1:12:06] man a bitter
[1:12:09] woman scarred up
[1:12:13] hateful
[1:12:15] indifferent mad at the world striking
[1:12:18] out at the world blaming everybody for
[1:12:22] what they done to us
[1:12:26] can you say
[1:12:27] Amen but he that endureth to the end
[1:12:31] there's a love that'll endure there's a
[1:12:33] peace that'll endure there's a Ministry
[1:12:37] he showed it to us a Ministry that'll
[1:12:42] endure hallu that's true takes
[1:12:47] enduring how how can a man endure such
[1:12:51] things how how what kept Jesus from
[1:12:54] being bitter what caused him to
[1:12:56] disregard ignore the Hurts The Words the
[1:13:01] actions everything that came against him
[1:13:04] what caused him just to ignore it as if
[1:13:06] though it never
[1:13:08] happens God have
[1:13:10] mercy that he could get up every
[1:13:14] day not being bothered by that not being
[1:13:18] contaminated with
[1:13:20] that facing the same people
[1:13:24] hello yeah he knew his death was
[1:13:27] coming he knew that most of the people
[1:13:29] that he talked to was going to kill
[1:13:33] him can you say amen amen so what would
[1:13:38] cause him to disregard the hurts and not
[1:13:42] abort his mission what caused him to get
[1:13:44] up every day without resentment toward
[1:13:47] God toward
[1:13:49] God people people forget they don't pray
[1:13:52] no more because they just so
[1:13:56] hurt right they forget reading their
[1:13:59] Bibles they don't go to the house of God
[1:14:01] no more just tired of it all how many
[1:14:04] people say I'm just tired of the
[1:14:06] Hypocrites in the church just tired of
[1:14:09] this tired of that well what all you
[1:14:11] doing is you're just blaming
[1:14:14] God but he got up every morning without
[1:14:17] blaming God and he's still done the will
[1:14:20] of the father he still maintained he
[1:14:23] endure sir he didn't just say well my
[1:14:25] meat is to do the will of the father and
[1:14:27] that was on a Monday and by Friday he
[1:14:29] was so upset quitting and giving up and
[1:14:32] and telling the disciples I don't you
[1:14:34] just go do what you want to do I'm tired
[1:14:36] of messing with all of
[1:14:38] you
[1:14:39] Hallelujah
[1:14:42] on but he got up every day without
[1:14:44] resentment toward God and toward the
[1:14:47] people that's true what caused him to
[1:14:49] say father forgive them for they know
[1:14:51] not what they do as he was hang hanging
[1:14:53] there on the cross they're mocking him
[1:14:57] they're spitting in his
[1:14:59] face they're the one that's crying out
[1:15:01] well if he be God if he is the one who
[1:15:03] says he is and get him on let him get
[1:15:05] off the cross you all that time he's
[1:15:08] hearing all this he's hearing their
[1:15:12] mockery he's feeling their hate toward
[1:15:16] him amen and then he says father forgive
[1:15:19] them for they know not what they do
[1:15:22] right well why why how could he do it
[1:15:25] because the Bible gives us the answer
[1:15:27] and here it is so many scriptures go
[1:15:29] look it up type it in his mercy endureth
[1:15:36] forever his righteousness endureth for
[1:15:39] the ever the truth of the Lord endureth
[1:15:44] forever his righteous judgments endureth
[1:15:48] forever his name endureth forever his
[1:15:52] Domin iion endureth throughout
[1:15:56] Generations the word of the Lord
[1:15:59] endureth
[1:16:01] forever can you say Amen see so
[1:16:04] everything about the Eternal God
[1:16:07] endures his love endures that's why he
[1:16:09] cannot love you today amen and hate you
[1:16:12] tomorrow he couldn't save you a year ago
[1:16:15] and then you wind up in hell he can't do
[1:16:17] it there is something about God that
[1:16:20] endures his thoughts about you have
[1:16:22] endured all this time through all of
[1:16:24] your mistakes and all of your mess up
[1:16:25] and everything about you amen that when
[1:16:28] the world the church the preacher the
[1:16:30] wife the mother uh uh the the Father the
[1:16:33] the husband and and everybody else and
[1:16:36] all your friends have forsaken you and
[1:16:38] say I don't think there's any hope his
[1:16:40] Mercy endures his love
[1:16:46] endures Hallelujah can you say Amen it
[1:16:49] endures the test it endures the trials
[1:16:53] you see we're the one that comes up with
[1:16:55] the the the mental blocks we're the one
[1:16:57] that comes up with the question whether
[1:16:58] he loves me or not but he has no
[1:17:00] question about
[1:17:02] you that's true it endures the
[1:17:05] loneliness we feel we go through the
[1:17:08] tests right we go through the trials we
[1:17:11] go through the misunderstandings we
[1:17:13] experien all of these things but his
[1:17:15] love his Mercy his word his promises
[1:17:19] endure
[1:17:21] forever they endure
[1:17:23] amen so the prophet said Jesus was
[1:17:27] manifested to show God to the people
[1:17:32] amen so what he had wasn't a natural
[1:17:36] thing his ministry didn't have a natural
[1:17:39] quality it wasn't on the human
[1:17:42] element can you sayen but it had an
[1:17:45] eternal quality what Jesus had endured
[1:17:48] the love that Jesus had endured the
[1:17:50] mercy that Jesus showed endured the word
[1:17:53] that Jesus was endured the ministry that
[1:17:56] Jesus had
[1:17:58] endured amen ain't that
[1:18:06] right now the prophet said Jesus knew
[1:18:08] that he couldn't
[1:18:10] save everyone he
[1:18:14] encountered and he didn't worry about
[1:18:17] the ones that he couldn't
[1:18:21] reach and
[1:18:23] when I'm saying
[1:18:26] this I'm I'm not saying that he just I
[1:18:29] forget
[1:18:30] them
[1:18:33] no but he didn't worry about their
[1:18:35] unbelief toward
[1:18:38] him he didn't you understand what I'm
[1:18:41] saying if people don't you know we say
[1:18:44] well we're Christian well if people
[1:18:45] don't believe you're a Christian then we
[1:18:47] just well what's the use
[1:18:49] then you know no they despised
[1:18:54] him they rejected him but he didn't
[1:18:58] consider their
[1:19:00] actions he he didn't build his ministry
[1:19:03] around them that's right if he did he
[1:19:05] would have just Gott hurt all the time
[1:19:07] that's right he would have gotten angry
[1:19:09] he would have gotten he he it would have
[1:19:11] affected him he did not allow their
[1:19:13] thoughts of him to affect
[1:19:16] him hello he didn't allow their
[1:19:19] criticism of him to offend him to where
[1:19:22] he would just quit but he ignored the
[1:19:24] shame he endured the suffering to save
[1:19:29] the ones he could
[1:19:37] help and Jesus said that he Sanctified
[1:19:41] himself for their sake that's true he
[1:19:44] Sanctified himself Paul here in 2
[1:19:47] Corinthians 88:9 says you know the the
[1:19:50] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:19:52] though though he was rich yet for your
[1:19:54] sakes everybody say for my sake s he
[1:19:58] became
[1:19:59] poor that you through his poverty might
[1:20:03] become rich what a
[1:20:06] Ministry what a
[1:20:08] Ministry it wasn't a Ministry about
[1:20:10] building himself it was for your sakes
[1:20:14] and his ministry was so for you that he
[1:20:17] would become poor that you could become
[1:20:21] rich
[1:20:31] am I believe with all my heart that if
[1:20:33] he was sent for only one person he
[1:20:36] wouldn't have changed a
[1:20:40] thing he would have endured more of the
[1:20:42] criticism because there had been more
[1:20:44] people against
[1:20:46] him if he just come for one
[1:20:49] person but through this whole entire
[1:20:52] time time through all the history you
[1:20:55] realize Satan has persecuted the
[1:20:57] Christians and Christianity he hates it
[1:20:59] to a
[1:21:00] passion and yet God
[1:21:04] continues and with
[1:21:07] longsuffering right with
[1:21:11] longsuffering well who's that long
[1:21:13] what's that long suffering being
[1:21:14] projected through you
[1:21:19] me
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:24] not saying God just kill
[1:21:27] him just wipe them off the face of the
[1:21:29] Earth God just any day
[1:21:35] waiting you know there's remember when
[1:21:38] brother brandom open them when when the
[1:21:40] seals were
[1:21:42] open there were Souls under the
[1:21:46] altar that people thought that was the
[1:21:49] bride yeah go ahead but he said no it
[1:21:53] couldn't be the bride and what how did
[1:21:55] he distinguish this how did he tell the
[1:21:58] difference he said because these people
[1:22:01] were crying for
[1:22:03] vengeance how long Lord will you avenge
[1:22:05] us that's right how long Lord he said
[1:22:08] see that ain't the bride because the
[1:22:09] bride would be saying father forgive
[1:22:11] them Father don't don't don't hold that
[1:22:13] against them Father help them can you
[1:22:16] say Amen that was the difference it was
[1:22:19] the Jews he said that was crying for
[1:22:21] vengeance that's right their blood was
[1:22:23] crying out for vengeance but here is a
[1:22:27] bride in this day now you think of it in
[1:22:30] this day of every pressure
[1:22:36] imaginable and yet she has the
[1:22:39] qualities think about it of
[1:22:41] Christ amen forgive them Father yes
[1:22:45] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:22:47] do can you say
[1:22:50] amen that's good became
[1:22:54] poor became poor that we could through
[1:22:56] his Pro poverty become rich reminds me
[1:23:00] of the same thing of Paul where he said
[1:23:03] I become all things to all men yeah that
[1:23:06] I might save
[1:23:09] some
[1:23:12] amen when Jesus was sent to Earth he was
[1:23:16] sent to a specific people Matthew 15:24
[1:23:20] and I hope this is all right amen but
[1:23:22] Matthew 15:24 says I am not sent Jesus
[1:23:26] said I am not sent but unto the lost
[1:23:27] sheep of the House of
[1:23:30] Israel and then when he sends his 12
[1:23:33] disciples
[1:23:36] out he tells them not to go by the way
[1:23:38] of the Gentiles or the Samaritans don't
[1:23:41] don't go by them but he says here uh
[1:23:44] there in Matthew 10: 6 go rather to the
[1:23:48] lost sheep of the House of Israel and
[1:23:52] that as you go preach saying the Kingdom
[1:23:54] of Heaven is at hand heal the sick
[1:23:58] cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast
[1:24:02] out Devils freely you have received
[1:24:06] freely give what a Ministry amen ain't
[1:24:10] that right yes sir see and and so the
[1:24:13] gospel was to be preached the prophet
[1:24:15] said to the Gentiles at a later time and
[1:24:18] and and we know when it turned to the
[1:24:20] Gentiles when Paul after the Jews had
[1:24:23] rejected and rejected and rejected
[1:24:26] finally says lo we turn to the Gentiles
[1:24:29] and that was when the dispensation of
[1:24:31] Grace turned to the Gentile uh uh the
[1:24:34] grace turned to the Gentile
[1:24:36] dispensation but notice the ministry the
[1:24:39] prophet said that Jesus gave his
[1:24:42] disciples was actually sharing his own
[1:24:45] Ministry with
[1:24:48] them ain't that right see go Matthew
[1:24:51] 9:35 5 and Jesus went about all the
[1:24:54] cities and Villages teaching in their
[1:24:56] synagogues preaching the gospel of the
[1:24:58] Kingdom healing every sick and every
[1:25:02] disease among the people ain't that
[1:25:04] right see so he gave them that part of
[1:25:07] the ministry as well go heal the lepers
[1:25:10] cleans you know heal the sick cast out
[1:25:12] those devils and and all of that so he
[1:25:14] gives them a part of his
[1:25:18] ministry hello don't just go learn I'm
[1:25:22] going to said yet but you go learn
[1:25:23] psychology and you learn to be a
[1:25:25] theologian and and and and you learn to
[1:25:27] do this and you go get your license and
[1:25:29] all that no no no I'm not going to give
[1:25:30] you a Ministry of men I'm going to give
[1:25:32] you a Ministry of
[1:25:36] myself gives them that power and and
[1:25:39] then the 36th verse but when he saw the
[1:25:41] multitudes he was moved with compassion
[1:25:43] on them because they fainted and were
[1:25:46] scattered abroad as sheep having no
[1:25:48] Shepherd then he saith unto his
[1:25:51] disciples the the Harvest truly is
[1:25:53] plenteous but the laborers are few there
[1:25:57] was all kinds of churches there was all

[1:27:49] laborers that that God has has was
[1:27:52] called or was looking for when Jesus was
[1:27:56] calling for Laborers that's not that's
[1:27:58] not necessarily what he was looking for

[1:28:26] labors in his
[1:28:29] church I will build my church and the

[1:28:42] that God is depending
[1:28:44] on Amen you with me we are the
[1:28:48] ones that God has called and elected you
[1:28:53] can't be in the church without being
[1:28:55] elected predestinated having your name
[1:28:58] written in the Lamb's Book of

[1:29:20] unconverted men are brain surgeons and
[1:29:23] and and lawyers and whatever else out
[1:29:29] there but to be part of his church to be
[1:29:32] part of his body there's got to be
[1:29:34] something Supernatural that happens to
[1:29:37] you you don't have to be smart you don't
[1:29:40] have to be rich you don't have to have
[1:29:41] it all together thank you Lord amen but

[1:29:53] hallu we are the ones that God is
[1:29:56] depending on and and and I have to tell
[1:29:59] you God didn't send us out as doctors to
[1:30:01] work in medicine and science I'm I'm I'm
[1:30:04] saying you can do that and that's fine
[1:30:07] you you can do that in the natural but
[1:30:09] but to be part of his church he didn't
[1:30:11] tell the church to go out and build
[1:30:13] hospitals he didn't tell the church well
[1:30:15] learn all the medications that you you
[1:30:17] got and I'll be with you you know just
[1:30:19] pump them needles in them
[1:30:22] he he didn't teach us them things he

[1:30:27] the steps to
[1:30:31] AA can you say amen he didn't send us
[1:30:34] out as doctors of divinity and
[1:30:36] theologians and psychologist he didn't
[1:30:40] he didn't send us out to exercise our
[1:30:42] human faith and human love and human
[1:30:46] compassion and human
[1:30:49] sympathy and then human
[1:30:52] intelligence
[1:30:56] Amen brother BR said human Faith doesn't
[1:30:58] go very far it'll deny the promises of
[1:31:01] God and it stems from intellectual
[1:31:04] reasonings we know we know we've talked
[1:31:06] about it we've read it we've heard it
[1:31:08] human love human compassion human
[1:31:11] sympathy it just throws everything in a
[1:31:14] in a
[1:31:15] puddle and and and brother said doesn't
[1:31:18] even consider the word of God ain't that
[1:31:21] right
[1:31:22] but I want you to notice there in
[1:31:24] Matthew
[1:31:26] the The Book of Matthew and I didn't
[1:31:29] give it to them and so but but here it
[1:31:32] says and there shall come forth a
[1:31:34] ruler can you say that with me there
[1:31:37] shall come forth a
[1:31:39] ruler out of Bethlehem that shall rule
[1:31:44] over my
[1:31:46] people Lord there shall be a
[1:31:50] ruler that to rule over my people he'll
[1:31:54] be that
[1:31:55] government praise the Lord ain't that
[1:31:57] right now notice as Jesus getting ready
[1:32:00] to go up and Ascend into heaven what
[1:32:02] watch what he tells his disciples acts
[1:32:04] 1: 18 but you shall receive
[1:32:07] power what power after that what the
[1:32:11] Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:32:14] you see and you shall be what Witnesses
[1:32:19] unto
[1:32:20] me this is what's going to make you
[1:32:23] laborers I'm going to send the Holy
[1:32:26] Ghost to you and it's going to Quicken
[1:32:30] you can you say Amen what love you
[1:32:33] thought you have but then here's he's
[1:32:36] talking to people that were broken he's
[1:32:37] talking to people even Peter's among
[1:32:40] them I said I'll never forsake you and
[1:32:42] he done it
[1:32:43] anyhow but it was because his human love
[1:32:46] his his Human Side failed
[1:32:50] him
[1:32:53] yeah but you'll be Witnesses unto me
[1:32:56] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[1:32:58] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[1:33:01] the earth Luke 24:49 behold I send the
[1:33:05] promise of my father unto you see what
[1:33:08] the promise of the Holy Spirit but tear
[1:33:11] ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:33:13] endued with power from on high ain't
[1:33:16] that right John 16:13 how be it when he
[1:33:19] the spirit of Truth is come he he will
[1:33:22] guide you what is it now they've got a
[1:33:24] new ruler it's not their old lust it's
[1:33:27] not their own flesh it's not their own
[1:33:29] self not their own desires and selfish
[1:33:32] motives and selfish this amen they're
[1:33:34] not longer no longer being led by that
[1:33:38] anymore because it would not lead Peter
[1:33:40] to stand there and be crucified with him
[1:33:43] he denied the
[1:33:46] Lord hello cuz he is scared for his
[1:33:50] life right but alad you amen he's going
[1:33:55] to guide you into all Truth for shall
[1:33:57] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[1:33:59] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:34:01] shall show you things to come he shall
[1:34:04] glorify me for he shall receive of mine
[1:34:06] and shall show it unto you all things
[1:34:09] that the father hath are mine and
[1:34:11] therefore I said I that he shall take of
[1:34:14] mine and show it unto you can you say
[1:34:15] Amen so what is it the Holy Spirit today
[1:34:19] rules over the people of God
[1:34:22] ain't that right and the Holy Spirit is
[1:34:24] the word are you with me the holy spirit
[1:34:28] is the word the Holy Spirit rules the
[1:34:32] word rule over the people of
[1:34:37] God and if you notice Jesus did not want
[1:34:41] his disciples going out doing anything
[1:34:43] for the kingdom until they first were
[1:34:46] endued with
[1:34:48] power until they first received the Holy
[1:34:50] Ghost brother BR says he told his
[1:34:53] disciples to T until Pentecost at which
[1:34:57] time the very same spirit that was upon
[1:35:00] him would come back and fall upon them
[1:35:02] and fill them notice he would fall upon
[1:35:05] them F them then that called out body
[1:35:09] the church would be in his stad up on
[1:35:12] the earth taking his
[1:35:15] place denominations can't take his place
[1:35:18] there is no people that can take his
[1:35:20] place but his church that has been
[1:35:22] filled with his very Life quickened by
[1:35:25] the Holy
[1:35:27] Ghost then they stand in his stead
[1:35:30] taking his
[1:35:32] place amen because that same spirit that
[1:35:36] was in him would be in them and they
[1:35:38] would do the very works and any people
[1:35:41] that is truly the body of Christ the
[1:35:44] true church WIll manifest the same works
[1:35:47] as did Jesus the Pentecostal Church be
[1:35:50] and the Pentecostal church because the
[1:35:52] same spirit will be in them and any
[1:35:55] other church that does not have the
[1:35:57] spirit and the manifestations is going
[1:35:59] to have to account for God to God can
[1:36:02] you say amen amen I read other quotes
[1:36:05] The Same Spirit that was on Jesus Christ
[1:36:07] has come back on his church doing the
[1:36:09] same signs same wonders same Holy Ghost
[1:36:12] same power it's the Covenant that God
[1:36:15] has given to them another place the holy
[1:36:18] spirit is the spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:20] Christ that has sended upon the church
[1:36:22] to continue the works of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:25] in his going away can you say Amen see
[1:36:28] that same Holy Ghost was that one was on
[1:36:32] the Messiah is still on his church today
[1:36:36] yes sir do you believe that amen so it's
[1:36:39] quickened us that we could continue that
[1:36:41] work but
[1:36:43] Church Glory we're going to be a people
[1:36:46] that's scarred we're going to be a
[1:36:48] people that's wounded we're going to be
[1:36:50] a people rejected we're going to be a
[1:36:52] people that is going to
[1:36:54] hurt we're going to be a people
[1:36:56] misunderstood we're going to be a people
[1:36:59] that be tempted just to walk away maybe
[1:37:02] not not walk away from God in that sense
[1:37:04] but walk away from Ministry walk away
[1:37:07] and just hide ourselves and and build up
[1:37:09] walls and complexes we're going to be a
[1:37:11] people like that but God has called
[1:37:14] us to continue on his
[1:37:19] ministry and he knows you can do it
[1:37:21] because he gave himself he filled you
[1:37:23] with himself that Eternal quality that
[1:37:26] Jesus had now is in his
[1:37:30] church cry your tears but keep pressing
[1:37:36] on can you say
[1:37:39] amen
[1:37:41] amen notice what was given to the church
[1:37:44] and I hope this all right acts 3:1 it
[1:37:47] says now Peter and John went up together
[1:37:50] into the temple at the The Hour of
[1:37:52] Prayer being the ninth hour and a
[1:37:54] certain man lame from his mother's womb
[1:37:57] was carried whom they laid daily at the
[1:38:00] Gate of the temple which is called
[1:38:03] Beautiful to ask arms of them that
[1:38:05] entered into the
[1:38:06] temple who seeing Peter and John about
[1:38:09] to go into the temple asked an
[1:38:12] arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon
[1:38:15] him with John said look on
[1:38:17] us and he gave heed unto them expecting
[1:38:21] to receive something of them but notice
[1:38:24] what Peter said cuz he's expecting to
[1:38:26] receive something natural today there's
[1:38:29] so many people in the same boat looking
[1:38:32] to a personality looking to a politician
[1:38:36] looking to something that can appease
[1:38:38] them give them a television give them
[1:38:41] money give them give them the
[1:38:43] lottery give them a a free
[1:38:46] vacation I ain't got all that to
[1:38:50] give and this is what Peter he didn't
[1:38:53] have medication to give he he didn't say
[1:38:56] well I I I'm doctor so and so you just
[1:38:58] come to my to into my surgery room and
[1:39:01] I'll open your eyes he didn't have
[1:39:04] that P had been up in the day of
[1:39:07] Pentecost he had been up there anded the
[1:39:10] same God that was in
[1:39:13] Christ can you say Amen see and so he
[1:39:16] had expected to receive something of
[1:39:18] them and then Peter says silver old Have
[1:39:21] I None but such as I have give I unto
[1:39:24] thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:39:26] Nazareth rise up and walk and he took
[1:39:30] him by the right hand and lifted him up
[1:39:32] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:39:34] received strength and he leaping up
[1:39:37] stood and walked and entered with them
[1:39:39] into the temple walking leaping and
[1:39:41] praising
[1:39:42] God now what did Peter have
[1:39:48] amen certainly didn't have silver and
[1:39:50] gold
[1:39:52] certainly didn't have an education CU he
[1:39:55] was ignorant and unlearned so what did
[1:39:57] he have well in the 16th verse it says
[1:40:01] and his name
[1:40:04] Jesus through faith in his name Jesus
[1:40:09] hath made this man who was once
[1:40:12] strong whom you see and know yay
[1:40:17] the faith everybody say the faith which
[1:40:20] is by
[1:40:22] from him Christ hath given him this
[1:40:26] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:40:29] all can you say Amen so brother Ram said
[1:40:32] see it was jesus' name and Jesus faith
[1:40:36] that brought about the miracle it wasn't
[1:40:39] human faith it wasn't a human name he
[1:40:42] had something greater than that right
[1:40:46] all together amen abam said see Peter
[1:40:49] did not claim that it was his own faith
[1:40:51] that did it neither did he claim that it
[1:40:53] was his own name that did it he didn't
[1:40:55] get the glory he didn't say see look
[1:40:57] what I've done it was nothing about
[1:41:01] him oh how we need people with the Holy
[1:41:03] Ghost to quit exalting
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:07] themselves and give all the glory to
[1:41:10] God who are we
[1:41:13] anyways how are we standing
[1:41:16] today that is
[1:41:18] true you said that jesus' name used in
[1:41:22] the faith which is from Jesus perform
[1:41:26] that work can you say amen that's right
[1:41:28] see so what was it that Peter had Jesus
[1:41:31] on the day of Pentecost gave his faith
[1:41:34] to the
[1:41:36] church can you say Amen how in the world
[1:41:39] do we preach day and day out of Miracles
[1:41:42] and Promises when everything is looking
[1:41:44] ugly and and and all these say there is
[1:41:46] a faith beyond my faith what causes us
[1:41:50] to keep claiming our children when it
[1:41:51] looks like there's nothing it's
[1:41:53] impossible here's a faith that's been
[1:41:56] given us what causes us to keep singing
[1:41:59] what causes us to keep loving what
[1:42:01] causes us to keep preaching what causes
[1:42:03] us to keep
[1:42:05] testifying there's a faith faith that
[1:42:09] has been
[1:42:10] greater can you say
[1:42:12] Amen yes sir see so he says see it's
[1:42:16] it's in Jesus name used in the faith
[1:42:20] which is from Jesus perform that great
[1:42:23] work right see jesus' name used in the
[1:42:27] faith which was from Jesus perform that
[1:42:31] great work see see so how are they going
[1:42:33] to be Witnesses of him Jesus gives him
[1:42:37] there gives them the his
[1:42:42] faith a faith that can move mountains a
[1:42:46] faith that can walk on Waters a faith
[1:42:48] that could stand there at the grave of
[1:42:50] Lazarus amen that had been 4 days dead
[1:42:52] and say Lazarus come forth the same
[1:42:55] faith that God had to stand there and
[1:42:57] say Let There Be and there was and he
[1:43:00] gave the church that same
[1:43:03] Faith hallelujah
[1:43:05] amen you know what the prophet said it
[1:43:08] was Pentecostal faith that he gave them
[1:43:11] Pentecostal faith that he gave them no
[1:43:13] wonder we can believe in miracles no
[1:43:15] wonder we can believe in in gifts when
[1:43:17] they're operated right no wonder we can
[1:43:19] believe in the super natural it's a
[1:43:21] Pentecostal
[1:43:23] faith not some faith that just well you
[1:43:27] can tell what happened here if if you
[1:43:29] look at it in in the church ages in
[1:43:32] Revelations
[1:43:35] 2:13 God addresses the Saints in the
[1:43:38] peram pergamus church age he said I Know
[1:43:42] Thy works and where thou dwellest even
[1:43:44] where Satan's seed is and thou holdest
[1:43:48] fast my name Jesus right and has not
[1:43:51] denied my
[1:43:53] faith Jesus Faith right see so now
[1:43:57] notice what the prophet said it wasn't a
[1:44:00] faith in him that he was speaking of it
[1:44:03] wasn't a faith in him it was his own
[1:44:07] faith that he had given to the Believers
[1:44:10] amen they had not denied his faith they
[1:44:15] had not relinquished his
[1:44:18] faith can you say man yes sir now I'm
[1:44:21] going give you some scriptures Romans
[1:44:23] 12:3 according as God hath dealt to
[1:44:26] every man this is always I I always
[1:44:28] question this
[1:44:30] scripture and and wondering what that
[1:44:33] meant and and I'm telling you what I I
[1:44:35] reading it the other day and and what
[1:44:38] brother Brown said about that scripture
[1:44:39] and
[1:44:40] wow yeah it happens to me too you know
[1:44:44] but Roman say according as God ha dealt
[1:44:47] to every man and then brother Brown says
[1:44:51] every
[1:44:52] believer so not every man just
[1:44:55] general cuz I thought well if he's dealt
[1:44:57] every man inord of faith and then you
[1:44:59] hear so many people so Skeptics and
[1:45:01] unbelief and they just talk doubt and
[1:45:03] that that's not what he's saying every
[1:45:05] man
[1:45:07] believer a Measure of Faith Can you say
[1:45:11] Amen what faith his faith his faith
[1:45:16] right oh yes sir see he's giving it to

[1:45:46] Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory
[1:45:49] with respects of persons can you say

[1:46:25] God and limit
[1:46:28] it you ain't going to work the ministry
[1:46:30] of Jesus Christ with
[1:46:35] that so it was by that faith that the
[1:46:39] ministry of Jesus Christ operates in the
[1:46:42] Church of the Living God praise the Lord
[1:46:44] and so but in this pergamin church age
[1:46:49] brother brownan said the majority of the
[1:46:51] people had forsaken the faith of God and
[1:46:55] taken the faith of
[1:46:59] nickan
[1:47:00] Creeds dogmas right and they forsook the
[1:47:04] faith of God
[1:47:09] hello and he says they had turned away
[1:47:12] from the truth that salvation is of the
[1:47:15] Lord and we're now humanizing salvation
[1:47:19] yeah
[1:47:20] they had cast aside the doctrine of
[1:47:22] election and open wide The Door Church
[1:47:25] door and their Fellowship to any and all
[1:47:28] who subscribed to their doctrines never
[1:47:30] mind the word right but there were a few
[1:47:34] who still had the measure of that faith
[1:47:37] of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:39] Christ and they not only used that faith
[1:47:42] in Acts of power but they also with stod
[1:47:45] by that Faith they with stod those who
[1:47:48] dared to say that they were saved simply
[1:47:51] on the grounds of joining a
[1:47:53] church the ministry had changed from a
[1:47:58] Supernatural Ministry to a human
[1:48:04] Ministry same thing today give them
[1:48:07] Donuts give them gas
[1:48:09] cards give bicycle giveaways or whatever
[1:48:12] giveaways and let's fill the church up
[1:48:15] humanizing salvation shake the
[1:48:17] preacher's hand do this and do that say
[1:48:20] s De Creed and and and all these things
[1:48:23] humanizing salvation but there's a
[1:48:26] people that still have the faith of God
[1:48:29] they can believe they can believe amen
[1:48:32] that that God can deliver that soul from
[1:48:34] the pits of hell don't have to give you
[1:48:38] a substitute but what I do
[1:48:40] have sir I give in the name of Jesus
[1:48:43] Christ amen that's
[1:48:45] good amen that's
[1:48:49] true
[1:48:53] I
[1:48:55] remember we we done a lot of
[1:48:59] Outreach uh me and
[1:49:02] Wendell my dad well our whole church
[1:49:06] done a lot of Outreach among the Native
[1:49:09] Indians tent meetings Street
[1:49:13] meetings and we
[1:49:18] were uh living dad had moved up to a
[1:49:23] place called kinwood Oklahoma among the
[1:49:29] Cherokees
[1:49:31] and if you ever been on a for the most
[1:49:34] part A a Indian
[1:49:37] Reservation it's so much really it's
[1:49:40] it's so shame but so much uh
[1:49:44] alcohol
[1:49:46] drugs just hopeless hopeless people
[1:49:53] you go into some of these places like
[1:49:56] in South Dakota Fort Thompson on the Sue
[1:50:02] reservation back at the time that we
[1:50:04] were there they were having what they
[1:50:06] called suicide
[1:50:07] packs where young people would come
[1:50:10] together and they would agree on a
[1:50:11] certain night they would hang
[1:50:14] themselves and that was pretty common
[1:50:18] that they were just hopeless
[1:50:21] so here we are in Kenwood
[1:50:25] and we'd have Outreach
[1:50:30] and it was kind of a Healy country we
[1:50:33] was kind of in a valley with heels and
[1:50:36] so we set speakers in in the summertime
[1:50:40] we'd set speakers out on our roof of the
[1:50:44] little building that we
[1:50:46] had and crank that puppy up and and it
[1:50:50] would Echo out in the
[1:50:53] valley and we'd have service
[1:50:57] outside and just preach
[1:51:01] away but I remember this one Cherokee
[1:51:07] Indian and
[1:51:09] I His Name Escapes my memory right
[1:51:14] now um that he was a tall fell
[1:51:21] unshaved and uh teeth broken what he had
[1:51:25] was rotted
[1:51:28] and he was a drunk and
[1:51:32] alcoholic mean
[1:51:34] man everybody was scared of
[1:51:37] him and the police they were 10 the
[1:51:42] closest was 10 miles
[1:51:45] away that he would set he would put
[1:51:49] stuff in the road and all that for them
[1:51:51] and call on them and you
[1:51:54] know it wreck you know watch them wreck
[1:51:58] and he just loved you know it was it was
[1:52:01] just he was
[1:52:03] honor and he had a boy just uh I don't
[1:52:07] know he might have been seven eight
[1:52:09] years old he wasn't married but he had
[1:52:11] this boy with him and his boy had sores
[1:52:15] and just like they just never took a
[1:52:17] bath and um
[1:52:21] um just a sad
[1:52:23] situation everybody just Mitchell his
[1:52:26] name was Mitchell everybody just stayed
[1:52:27] away from
[1:52:29] Mitchell I remember you know I don't
[1:52:32] know wend might have
[1:52:36] been 17 I would
[1:52:40] say so that that would have made
[1:52:43] me
[1:52:47] 1314 but one said Sean you want to go
[1:52:49] with me to witness to
[1:52:51] Mitchell MIT
[1:52:57] Mitchell yeah I I said well isn't that
[1:53:00] the one that no one wants to witness
[1:53:04] to
[1:53:06] yeah um well yeah we'll go so we we
[1:53:12] found this place out in the woods and
[1:53:15] you get out there and it's just a
[1:53:18] shack and it's even worse than Brother
[1:53:21] Sam
[1:53:24] Shack and it just put up by Boards and
[1:53:27] it was it it was a lean when I say lean
[1:53:30] to it was a lean the floor
[1:53:35] leaned and so we knocked on his
[1:53:38] makeshift
[1:53:40] door and trash just all around the yard
[1:53:44] and all that you know and so we knocked
[1:53:46] on the door and no one answered
[1:53:52] so we knocked a little bit louder window
[1:53:55] did and F we heard a who's
[1:53:58] there you know and didn't even bother to
[1:54:02] open the door you know so we're kind of
[1:54:03] talking to the
[1:54:05] door uh wend found his voice says uh um
[1:54:11] I'm Wendell and this is my brother
[1:54:13] Sean what do you
[1:54:16] want well we came to talk to you about
[1:54:20] the
[1:54:21] Lord get
[1:54:23] lost so we
[1:54:27] did we
[1:54:30] left and I was kind of
[1:54:35] relieved a few days later wend last says
[1:54:39] Sean you want to go back and see if we
[1:54:42] can witness to Mitchell I said sure
[1:54:44] let's
[1:54:44] go so we go same
[1:54:48] process who's there well this is I'm
[1:54:53] Wendell and this is my brother Sean I
[1:54:55] thought I'd told y'all to leave well we
[1:54:57] did but we're
[1:55:01] back said would you just let us
[1:55:05] in and it a long
[1:55:08] wait and we didn't know what was going
[1:55:10] to
[1:55:11] happen and finally says come
[1:55:14] in so we opened the door best we could
[1:55:18] and like I said the floor was a little
[1:55:22] leaning so we walked in there and it
[1:55:25] stunk just
[1:55:28] filthy
[1:55:30] dark there he was just beer cans
[1:55:33] everywhere
[1:55:34] and what do you
[1:55:37] want so we just started talking to him
[1:55:39] about the Lord and how that the Lord
[1:55:42] just loved him and that he could change
[1:55:45] his life to where he just wouldn't have
[1:55:46] to be a wretched
[1:55:48] drunk
[1:55:50] that God can make him a respectable
[1:55:52] Citizen
[1:55:54] and and as we begin to talk the tears
[1:55:56] just begin to roll down his cheeks the
[1:56:00] presence of the Lord just come into that
[1:56:01] little old
[1:56:04] Shanny and we LED old Mitchell to the
[1:56:07] Lord that
[1:56:08] day hallu that man quit his drinking
[1:56:13] immediately threw away his tobacco never
[1:56:18] smoked that man God so changed that man
[1:56:22] that he would just walk around
[1:56:24] everywhere smiling just barely any teeth
[1:56:27] he was so he was so happy he just
[1:56:31] talking to everybody just all that
[1:56:33] community in Kenwood just talking about
[1:56:34] what God done for him God was so
[1:56:39] good and I thought but what if what if
[1:56:41] we would have just left loud things to
[1:56:43] get in our way what if we would have
[1:56:45] built complexes well he stinks and well
[1:56:48] I don't know if everybody else don't
[1:56:50] like him then we probably shouldn't
[1:56:52] maybe he's got a gun I don't know you
[1:56:54] know but there was we had to press past
[1:56:59] that so we could reach
[1:57:03] somebody can you say Amen somebody
[1:57:06] there's somebody that we got to reach
[1:57:09] church and we've got to look past what
[1:57:12] they
[1:57:14] are we've got to look past the
[1:57:17] conditions that they're in we you got to
[1:57:19] look past because they've got the
[1:57:21] they've got a wall built up and they're
[1:57:27] hurting I think the best thing that we
[1:57:30] could do is remember where God brought
[1:57:31] us
[1:57:33] from look at what we were look at the
[1:57:38] conditions God had to have done
[1:57:41] something for
[1:57:46] us and if he can do it for us he can do
[1:57:48] it for them
[1:57:51] but we are his laborers we've got to
[1:57:54] tell
[1:57:55] somebody about
[1:57:58] God you love him amen if the musicians
[1:58:01] will come the
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:08] Lord and I
[1:58:11] know not everybody's going
[1:58:14] to accept it not everybody's going to
[1:58:17] understand it
[1:58:19] but do we stop because of it no do we
[1:58:23] get discouraged to where we just quit
[1:58:24] saying things talking about the
[1:58:28] Lord if we do that then all we are we're
[1:58:31] just going to hear them we're going to
[1:58:33] hear them talk and trash God we're going
[1:58:35] to hear them talk negative we're going
[1:58:36] to hear all them talk of all their bad
