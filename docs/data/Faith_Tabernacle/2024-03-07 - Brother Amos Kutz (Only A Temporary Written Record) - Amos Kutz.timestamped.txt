[46:06] glad we can have
[46:08] peace amen I've I've often said this you
[46:11] know we we prayed for a lot we got a lot
[46:15] of requests we've got things that we
[46:17] would like to see God save people
[46:20] probably the most thing above even
[46:23] physical healing is salvation of the
[46:25] Soul go and I see Sons and Daughters bir
[46:29] from above amen into a new birth and I
[46:33] think that's our greatest desire but you
[46:36] know I I believe this brother Terry with
[46:38] all my
[46:39] heart I don't know how God would do it
[46:41] and I don't even try to figure out how
[46:43] he would do it but if the Rapture was
[46:46] going to come in the morning I'm not
[46:48] worried about those people I'm praying
[46:50] for cuz I prayed and I'm believing that
[46:54] some way somehow now they're going to be
[46:58] there Hallelujah so if if it was let's
[47:02] say it was going to happen in the
[47:04] morning I'm not I'm not worried one bit
[47:07] I've applied the token and I believe
[47:10] that God is faithful and just to his
[47:13] promise
[47:15] hey only
[47:18] believe all
[47:20] things are possible we sing it so many
[47:24] times but when we put the where the
[47:27] rubber meets the road so to speak it's
[47:30] like I told uh some sisters up there in
[47:32] Canada years
[47:34] back you know their families were
[47:36] Wayward and oh my it was so much trouble
[47:40] in those families it was scars and and
[47:44] you talk about complexes and all kinds
[47:46] of
[47:47] stuff but I told the sister said if go
[47:50] do you have enough of faith in God that
[47:53] if God by his divine perect perfect will
[47:56] chose to take you home that got to take
[47:58] care of your

[52:06] blood he entered once into the holy
[52:09] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[52:13] for us for the blood of bulls and of
[52:16] goats and the ashes of an hepher
[52:18] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the
[52:22] purifying of the flesh how much more
[52:25] shall the blood of Christ who through
[52:27] the eternal spirit offered himself
[52:30] without spot to God Purge your
[52:33] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[52:36] Living God and going over into Hebrews
[52:39] 10 and verse
[52:40] one Hebrews 10 and verse1 for the law
[52:44] having a shadow of good things to come
[52:47] and not the very image of things can
[52:49] never with those sacrifices which they
[52:51] offered year by year continually make
[52:54] the comers there unto perfect for then
[52:57] would they have not ceased to be offered
[52:59] because that the worshippers once purged
[53:03] should have had no more conscience of
[53:06] sins but in those sacrifices there is a
[53:10] remembrance again made of sins every
[53:13] year let's bow our heads in pray and ask

[54:58] amen and amen as you seated
[55:03] tonight the brother asked me what I
[55:07] would be uh speaking on tonight and I
[55:10] thought an appropriate
[55:12] title would be
[55:14] this and I may come up maybe a you might
[55:18] put you might put a better title to it
[55:20] than what I've got but I'd like to speak
[55:23] on something tonight that I believe that
[55:25] the Lord Jesus spoke to me while I was
[55:27] sitting here in the service one service
[55:30] listening to brother Shawn Minister and
[55:33] and this thought come into my heart and
[55:36] almost I I I I just I was just
[55:41] completely I I it was just such a joy in
[55:44] my heart when I something that I been
[55:47] looking at for years and years and never
[55:50] noticed it before Suddenly It's like the
[55:54] he lifted the veil off of the
[55:58] sculpture he lifted the veil he pulled
[56:01] it back a little bit further so that I
[56:04] may
[56:05] see to show me to show us
[56:10] all Hallelujah where we're
[56:13] at and I pray what we're going to talk
[56:15] about
[56:16] tonight would be a would be a blessing
[56:19] to you as it was to
[56:21] me I say as brother randam said May the
[56:23] same inspiration that came to me in
[56:26] study and and in meditation and so forth
[56:30] may be with us
[56:33] tonight
[56:35] now as as we read there in Isaiah 65
[56:38] And1 17 if I could just allude to this
[56:41] he says behold I create new heavens and
[56:44] new earth and a former shall not be
[56:47] remembered nor come into
[56:49] mind if you go back and you listen to
[56:52] the message I was listening a little bit
[56:54] to it this
[56:56] afternoon uh uh the uh future home
[57:00] message the future home of the Heavenly
[57:04] bride and the Earthly or the Earthly
[57:06] bride and and how that the
[57:10] bride how this
[57:12] Earth is going to be
[57:15] changed and I think we've been speaking
[57:17] about new book old book if you some of
[57:20] you remember maybe a few times that
[57:23] we've been here we we talked about that
[57:26] we know that there is the old Old
[57:29] Testament and then there's a new
[57:32] testament oh my the Old Testament and
[57:37] then there's the New Testament oh my wow
[57:42] but we find out that we realize
[57:48] that when brother random preached that
[57:50] sermon he he brought it back to how
[57:53] God he does that work in us
[57:57] first in this
[57:59] earth he brings a baptism of fire into
[58:04] the soul to remove the old man the old
[58:06] man dies an invisible Union you read
[58:09] about it's not just a
[58:11] divorcement he can't be married to
[58:13] somebody that's got a living husband you
[58:15] see that's the difference and I I spoke
[58:17] on this Sunday morning down there uh in
[58:21] Tennessee the difference between a party
[58:24] in which praise God for
[58:28] it but there's an
[58:33] exoneration two different
[58:35] things you know we we hear about a
[58:39] presidential
[58:41] pardon and this man or this
[58:44] woman is pardoned and they they're let
[58:48] out of
[58:49] prison but they still got a record
[58:51] behind them now that goes with a pardon
[58:55] and that's why people today they they
[58:59] believe on the Lord Jesus for God so
[59:01] loved the world that he gave to his only
[59:04] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[59:06] him should not perish and that's
[59:09] good but that's all the further they
[59:12] go and so they received a pardon but the
[59:16] old husband's still
[59:18] living they're and they try to live in a
[59:21] Sanctified State that's why brother
[59:22] random said the foolish virgin has to go
[59:25] into the tribulation period to be
[59:28] purged in order to go into that City cuz
[59:31] he said not a bobbed haired woman's
[59:33] going to walk through those doors of
[59:34] that Gates of that
[59:39] City I didn't just pick that
[59:42] one that's the first thing come on my
[59:45] mind the Bible says nor drunkers nor
[59:47] thieves nor Liars will enter into that
[59:51] place so there you have
[59:55] hardened brother and said there's
[59:57] millions of
[59:58] people be allowed to go into eternal
[1:00:01] life will be given eternal
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:05] life you see but they had to go to the
[1:00:07] great white Throne judgment I'm so
[1:00:09] thankful for this
[1:00:12] message that tells me that once I become
[1:00:15] bold of his bold and flesh of his flesh
[1:00:17] and he old man is
[1:00:19] dead he shall not come into the Judgment
[1:00:23] Hallelujah
[1:00:25] I'm passed from
[1:00:29] Death under
[1:00:31] life the pardon receive
[1:00:34] life but the Sinner and the
[1:00:39] ungodly like I
[1:00:41] said last
[1:00:45] weekend when the judge
[1:00:48] says depart from
[1:00:50] me I never knew you you and he turns his
[1:01:00] back it's all over for that
[1:01:08] Soul see now they're living under a
[1:01:11] blessing because you and I are still
[1:01:18] here their life continues on but their
[1:01:22] sins do follow them
[1:01:26] and someday and I look at these World
[1:01:29] rulers and I look at these evil wicked
[1:01:31] men today or even the religious crowd
[1:01:34] who denies the word of God when they're
[1:01:38] summoned there won't be no they might
[1:01:41] they might be in contemp of court right
[1:01:43] now hey you
[1:01:46] Sinners because you're not here tonight
[1:01:48] because you're not somewhere in a house
[1:01:50] of God somewhere you're in contempt of
[1:01:53] court
[1:01:54] brother
[1:01:56] Amos how could they be in contemp of
[1:01:59] Court
[1:02:01] yeah you ever hear of settling on a
[1:02:08] court the Lord Jesus Christ the merciful
[1:02:13] lamb is inviting Sinners to come to now
[1:02:17] but you can settle
[1:02:20] now you can receive a
[1:02:22] pardon for your in
[1:02:26] sir and they don't
[1:02:29] come an evangelist goes into a place and
[1:02:32] they invite the the general public to
[1:02:34] come and people feel a funny
[1:02:37] feeling like I said
[1:02:39] about some guy in Toronto Canada opens
[1:02:43] up the
[1:02:44] newspaper and sees the
[1:02:46] headlines and say it was Billy Graham
[1:02:49] years
[1:02:51] ago funny feeling hits him
[1:02:55] maybe you ought to
[1:02:58] go oh but I'm care I sa my H marage I
[1:03:02] say all
[1:03:03] this somethingone speaks to
[1:03:05] him Holy Spirit speaking to that Sinner
[1:03:08] Man that religious Catholic
[1:03:11] man and he maybe another he goes to work
[1:03:15] the next day comes home and sits in the
[1:03:18] recliner again enjoying his cup of
[1:03:21] coffee and he sees the ad again
[1:03:25] and the Holy
[1:03:26] Spirit
[1:03:28] wo just coming around him and he feel
[1:03:32] such a feeling like my I ought to go I
[1:03:36] feel like I've heard of Billy Graham
[1:03:39] there's just something about that man
[1:03:40] what I've seen him on television and so
[1:03:42] forth something about his ministry but
[1:03:45] the man Harden his
[1:03:47] heart he's in
[1:03:50] contempt turning down
[1:03:52] Mercy brother Bram said God I will not
[1:03:54] condemn The Sinner for them being a
[1:03:57] sinner but that fail they failed they
[1:03:59] rejected the way out they rejected Mercy
[1:04:05] when it come to him and think about it
[1:04:07] when all these people out here there's
[1:04:10] enough of Bible around there's enough of
[1:04:12] word around the messages out there in
[1:04:14] the
[1:04:15] internet even with services like
[1:04:18] this that rich
[1:04:20] men could hear the truth and no doubt
[1:04:23] have tapped into
[1:04:25] it and hurt
[1:04:28] it one thing about it they're in
[1:04:31] contempt of court
[1:04:33] now they're going to be at that Court
[1:04:36] sitting oh God have mercy I I I'll be
[1:04:40] honest with you I'm not I'm not gloating
[1:04:43] in that I don't gloat in a sinner's
[1:04:46] demise neither does God I think there's
[1:04:48] a scripture I was trying to I've got it
[1:04:51] up here in my notes where he said I did
[1:04:53] don't Delight in anger delight and
[1:04:55] mercy he don't take no pleasure in the
[1:04:57] death of the wicked he doesn't take
[1:04:59] pleasure in allowing judgment to fall
[1:05:02] upon
[1:05:05] people he's not that kind of God you
[1:05:08] better get rid of that carnality cornal
[1:05:11] thinking that come from a lot of these
[1:05:13] denominational husbands eternal hell the
[1:05:17] whole nine yards I was thinking about
[1:05:20] that tonight how in the world could I
[1:05:23] after having received this glorious
[1:05:26] truth to know that I am absolutely free
[1:05:29] believe such a
[1:05:30] thing but even if I did the blood's
[1:05:34] already gone before
[1:05:38] me I have nothing to
[1:05:40] fear but he Jesus said he'll not come
[1:05:43] into that judgment we'll stand with him
[1:05:46] in
[1:05:46] judgment but now we look at the
[1:05:50] pardoned those who who rejected their
[1:05:53] sins follow them to judgment and Jesus
[1:05:55] said you'll die in your sins he told
[1:05:58] those Pharisees you're going to die in
[1:06:00] your
[1:06:02] sins that's pretty heavy I think I'd
[1:06:06] have prostrated myself right there and
[1:06:07] say oh lord lord Master see me have
[1:06:11] mercy upon
[1:06:14] me who are
[1:06:17] you we're
[1:06:19] educated where'd you come
[1:06:23] from
[1:06:25] so we move from the parland to the
[1:06:29] exonerated exonerated also it includes
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:33] pardon but actually
[1:06:36] exoneration over over uh I don't know
[1:06:39] what the word would be not
[1:06:42] supersedes but it actually eliminates
[1:06:46] pardon and it it says you're
[1:06:49] completely absorbed of
[1:06:52] guilt and that's like a man accused of a
[1:06:55] crime that he never
[1:06:57] committed exonerate the man means they
[1:07:00] take it off his record and you could
[1:07:02] they could take the governor or whoever
[1:07:05] take that man and stand him right up
[1:07:06] front say anybody want to hire this guy
[1:07:09] if you don't cuz you think he's got a
[1:07:10] record his record is done away
[1:07:17] with put it on the TV put it on the
[1:07:20] newspaper in the
[1:07:22] magazines this man is
[1:07:26] Guiltless there is no stain of of
[1:07:30] wrongdoing On this man's
[1:07:32] reputation he is
[1:07:38] exonerated
[1:07:41] Justified yeah that's the
[1:07:43] word there's no point because
[1:07:47] Christ took your judgment and my
[1:07:51] judgment for us the full penalty hell
[1:07:56] included that we should have got was
[1:07:59] placed upon
[1:08:01] him he bore our
[1:08:04] punishment and the blood that it was so
[1:08:08] holy that God accepted it brother
[1:08:12] Josiah God accepted that
[1:08:16] blood as holy as that
[1:08:19] is that
[1:08:21] Holiness is now a upon you and
[1:08:25] I who are you to say that my past is so
[1:08:33] terrible look at the
[1:08:36] Holiness of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:39] look at the Holiness of the supernatural
[1:08:41] life of God coming into
[1:08:45] you you're just as
[1:08:49] holy as the blood of Jesus
[1:08:52] Christ
[1:08:54] nothing
[1:08:56] less nothing
[1:09:03] less
[1:09:06] now Hebrews 8
[1:09:09] and12 I will be
[1:09:14] merciful tell me how could somebody
[1:09:16] continue to believe that the bride has
[1:09:19] to go to the great white Throne judgment
[1:09:22] that the elect to pred destinated
[1:09:24] ordained of God has to go to the great
[1:09:27] white Throne judgment after you read
[1:09:29] what I'm about to read taken from this
[1:09:32] was actually I believe found over in the
[1:09:34] Old Testament uh yes Jeremiah
[1:09:39] 31-34 they shall all know me from the
[1:09:41] least of them unto the greatest of them
[1:09:43] sayith the Lord for I will forgive their
[1:09:47] iniquity and I will
[1:09:50] remember their sin no no no no
[1:09:55] more no
[1:09:57] more remember no more Jeremiah Prophet
[1:10:00] Jeremiah spoke it Hebrews 8:12 again
[1:10:03] it's repeated by Paul the Apostle I will
[1:10:06] be merciful to their unrighteousness and
[1:10:08] their sins and their
[1:10:10] iniquities will I remember no
[1:10:17] more might took the microphone right
[1:10:19] right right now started hearing went all
[1:10:22] the way to the back
[1:10:24] I'll start with
[1:10:27] myself and and ask you this do you got a
[1:10:31] record
[1:10:35] somewhere I'm talking about out there in
[1:10:37] the
[1:10:38] world not don't I'm not just saying a
[1:10:41] trick
[1:10:42] question but I'm asking you this there's
[1:10:46] things you
[1:10:47] done you're you're terribly ashamed
[1:10:50] of but you know what I don't I don't
[1:10:52] Harbor on that I look to the blood the
[1:10:55] Holiness of the blood I'm just as holy
[1:10:57] right now I am justified by the blood of
[1:10:59] Jesus Christ I truly repented I've
[1:11:03] confessed my sins I've identified myself
[1:11:06] in water into baptism in the name of
[1:11:08] Jesus Christ and receive the baptism of
[1:11:10] the Holy Ghost In My Soul burning out
[1:11:14] the old man

[1:11:24] me how could you even go to a great
[1:11:27] white
[1:11:28] Throne when he doesn't he
[1:11:31] remembered if you let's just say don't
[1:11:34] want to plant any seed in your
[1:11:36] mind but let's say you come up
[1:11:40] there and you're real believer you're
[1:11:42] really
[1:11:43] like all he see would be the Lamb's
[1:11:47] blood and his robe of
[1:11:50] righteousness because right now we are
[1:11:52] in judgment judement judgment must begin
[1:11:56] at the house of God so you're already
[1:11:59] there but you're standing here baptized
[1:12:02] and immersed in the precious blood not
[1:12:04] just the
[1:12:05] blood but the life of the blood flowing
[1:12:10] through you
[1:12:11] supernaturally has transformed your soul
[1:12:14] taken away the old man the old sin
[1:12:17] nature of
[1:12:20] unbelief whether he's Pagan or religious
[1:12:23] thought I'd throw that one in there
[1:12:26] don't
[1:12:27] matter he's
[1:12:29] dead he's dead because Christ can't live
[1:12:32] in the same house that's why our
[1:12:34] Pentecostal friends Baptist friends and
[1:12:36] so forth like that they can never come
[1:12:38] to
[1:12:40] this until they receive the opening of
[1:12:43] the word and see what the lamb has done
[1:12:47] for them they'll stand apart in state
[1:12:49] some of them praise God for that but
[1:12:53] they're not
[1:12:54] exonerated that's why they sang the song
[1:12:57] of Moses standing brother B said
[1:12:59] standing on a sea of glass like like
[1:13:01] fire what was it he said those are the
[1:13:04] people that go through the tribulation
[1:13:07] period they had to be purged but they
[1:13:10] sing the song of Moses praise God for
[1:13:14] that that's why we need to pray for
[1:13:16] people I don't I i' I I witnessed to
[1:13:19] somebody I gave him message books gave
[1:13:21] him brother R books I'm not worried
[1:13:24] about
[1:13:25] it I I ain't going to spin my tires keep
[1:13:28] spinning my tires with them but just
[1:13:30] pray for them and let them alone all you
[1:13:33] can do is seow the
[1:13:34] seed and and let God do the
[1:13:38] whatever he'll take care of it now he
[1:13:42] says I will be merciful to their
[1:13:45] unrighteousness their sins and
[1:13:46] iniquities will I remember no more it
[1:13:49] just
[1:13:50] destroys the doctrine of having to stand
[1:13:54] before God then and what are you what
[1:13:56] are they trying to say that the blood
[1:13:59] that they believe in which I'm not
[1:14:00] saying they don't believe the blood of
[1:14:02] Jesus Christ but they have no
[1:14:04] understanding to know that it goes to
[1:14:06] the deepest recesses of your heart and
[1:14:09] eliminates the old
[1:14:12] man they don't have that
[1:14:15] understanding that's why they got their
[1:14:17] wires all tangled
[1:14:20] up messed up mixed up
[1:14:26] you're like a bunch of
[1:14:28] wondering
[1:14:32] well I can make a statement there but
[1:14:36] don't be too hard on
[1:14:37] them say can help
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:42] it I don't know who is elect and I don't
[1:14:46] know who is but I'm believeing I'm elect
[1:14:48] and I believe I'm looking at elect here
[1:14:50] tonight or I wouldn't be standing here
[1:14:52] wasting in my time in this Pulpit
[1:14:55] neither would brother sha and any of
[1:14:57] these other ministers be standing up
[1:14:58] here and preaching if they didn't
[1:15:00] believe that there's elect coming in
[1:15:02] this
[1:15:03] assembly
[1:15:07] amen I hope I don't sound too mean and
[1:15:11] harsh my voice to thank the Lord I pray
[1:15:13] God give me a good voice
[1:15:15] tonight and uh I've had trouble with it
[1:15:19] maybe I'm just kind
[1:15:20] of really going out there so you can
[1:15:22] adjust the volume if you need to but he
[1:15:25] said how much more shall the blood of
[1:15:27] Christ through the eternal spirit
[1:15:29] offered himself without spot to God
[1:15:32] without
[1:15:34] spot that was a that was the Perfection
[1:15:36] of the
[1:15:37] sacrifice without spot to God Purge your
[1:15:41] conscience now he's not going to say
[1:15:43] well I can I can come before God but see
[1:15:46] this is the way the denominational minds
[1:15:48] think they think yes oh yes Jesus Jesus
[1:15:52] but like brother Donny Reagan said years
[1:15:54] ago is Jesus in the manger praise the
[1:15:56] Lord but you go in the
[1:15:59] manger
[1:16:01] what you go down to the baptismal pool
[1:16:06] what you go to mount Transfiguration and
[1:16:09] adoption
[1:16:16] what and you know what I say to
[1:16:19] that wish you
[1:16:21] not that Jesus was the
[1:16:24] beginning of the creation of God and if
[1:16:28] he not to be sarcastic sound
[1:16:32] sarcastic but if he's the beginning of
[1:16:34] the creation of God then there's got to
[1:16:36] be some more the beginning there's got
[1:16:39] to be an
[1:16:40] Omega there's got to be a body follow
[1:16:43] the
[1:16:46] hand you're new creatures in Christ
[1:16:49] Jesus I'm a new creation I'm a brand new
[1:16:52] man old
[1:16:55] things pass
[1:16:58] away and All Things become
[1:17:04] new
[1:17:07] [Laughter]
[1:17:12] okay blessed be the Lord
[1:17:15] Jesus God shall wipe away Revelation
[1:17:20] 21:4 wipe away all tears from from their
[1:17:23] eyes there shall be no more
[1:17:27] death did you hear
[1:17:29] that no more
[1:17:33] death neither
[1:17:37] sorrow neither
[1:17:41] sorrow nor
[1:17:45] crying neither shall there be any more
[1:17:52] pain neither shall there be any more
[1:18:03] pain my memory as much as hard as I try
[1:18:06] and I can tell you this brother and
[1:18:08] sister blessed is a
[1:18:10] man who stays in the
[1:18:13] word and in his law does he meditate day
[1:18:16] and night many times we find ourselves
[1:18:20] weak like I said last Sunday
[1:18:23] because we got too many other
[1:18:28] things and then not necessarily those
[1:18:31] things they can become sin To Us by our
[1:18:36] negligence
[1:18:37] neglecting the word of
[1:18:41] God and Satan knows how to Allure us and
[1:18:45] I that's why I yeah I'm I'm probably
[1:18:48] somebody that's got lots of
[1:18:50] hobbies I got things that I like to do I
[1:18:53] like to work on
[1:18:55] vehicles that's a hobby of mine I like
[1:18:58] to fix
[1:19:00] things I like to work with wood as a
[1:19:04] carpenter when I
[1:19:06] can and a lot of other
[1:19:09] stuff I'm a
[1:19:13] collector
[1:19:15] so there's plenty to take my
[1:19:18] attention and I like to ride motorcycle
[1:19:21] I'll just be honest
[1:19:24] in case some of you oh you're so
[1:19:27] Sanctified but I I guess some people got
[1:19:30] horses I just got a a Horseless
[1:19:33] two-wheeler so I enjoy riding out in the
[1:19:39] country I like doing
[1:19:42] that yeah that's my hobby I guess
[1:19:45] everybody can buy an expensive gun and
[1:19:48] go out in the woods and sit there and
[1:19:49] freeze to
[1:19:51] death
[1:19:53] Been There Done brother Levi you've had
[1:19:57] more Fortune than I've had I've stood
[1:19:59] all day brother and not seeing hardly a
[1:20:02] white
[1:20:03] tail but sometimes the Lord has blessed
[1:20:07] and there's nothing wrong with those
[1:20:10] things provided he stays first
[1:20:16] place so that the enemy cannot come in
[1:20:19] now no a parallel I don't know better
[1:20:23] not get into
[1:20:24] that
[1:20:26] but there's a balance to things why
[1:20:29] we're on this Earth we can't walk around
[1:20:31] like a bunch of
[1:20:33] monks I was in some Holiness Wesley and
[1:20:36] Holiness meetings years ago they only
[1:20:38] dressed in black and white if you ask me
[1:20:41] I think they look like a bunch of
[1:20:44] vultures so straight-faced
[1:20:47] thought they were so Sanctified they
[1:20:50] couldn't hardly laugh at anything
[1:20:53] boy what kind of a home do you think
[1:20:55] they
[1:20:56] had I'm not mocking them people some of
[1:20:58] them I know is very sincere you get
[1:21:01] around some of them people that I was
[1:21:02] around brother Sean I'm telling you I
[1:21:05] walked into a meeting one time I was the
[1:21:08] only man there with a short sleeve shirt
[1:21:10] on woo boy I noticed it right away had a
[1:21:15] big bonfire at that used camp out there
[1:21:18] in the woods and they said anybody got
[1:21:20] any short sleeve shirts you want to get
[1:21:22] rid of bur rest not a
[1:21:26] time I guess I just didn't get
[1:21:28] Sanctified to their
[1:21:31] level boy talk about being enough to
[1:21:34] drive some people away but I hung in
[1:21:39] there but you know I couldn't stand
[1:21:42] around that kind of stuff self-made
[1:21:45] righteousness brother random talks about
[1:21:47] that in 64 he talks about the the the
[1:21:50] pilgrim Holiness and and those different
[1:21:52] ones and and how they they they have
[1:21:55] their
[1:21:56] standards and so forth I'm not saying
[1:22:00] there may be a reason a man wears a long
[1:22:02] sleeve
[1:22:03] shirt he might have tattoos going up his
[1:22:06] arm he running not that he can't get rid
[1:22:09] of he'd rather not be offensive to
[1:22:14] people judge not that you be not judged
[1:22:18] you don't know why you're a brother
[1:22:19] sister I don't try to push my
[1:22:21] convictions on anybody else El anything
[1:22:24] that I don't have word for yet I feel in
[1:22:26] my heart I shouldn't be doing I'm not
[1:22:28] going to try to shove it on other
[1:22:30] people that's just
[1:22:33] me it's every man every man has to know
[1:22:37] because you see I know where some of
[1:22:39] these things take you so I
[1:22:41] avoid any little any little crack any
[1:22:45] little crevice that the devil would try
[1:22:47] to open up to me I avoid it I've learned
[1:22:50] one
[1:22:51] thing
[1:22:53] there's some things you was ever
[1:22:54] involved in stay away as far as you
[1:22:56] can you're looking at somebody tonight
[1:22:59] that messed around with some things that
[1:23:01] a man no man or woman should ever mess
[1:23:04] around with I ain't talking about what
[1:23:07] you may be thinking I'm talking about
[1:23:10] satanic
[1:23:14] power don't open those
[1:23:17] doors matter of fact it's even it's got
[1:23:20] into the
[1:23:21] message young people you're seeing a
[1:23:24] even adults is seeing a power of God
[1:23:26] manifest demons being cast out and
[1:23:29] you're opening the door and let them
[1:23:30] them back
[1:23:39] in forgive me
[1:23:43] flee the very appearance of
[1:23:46] evil
[1:23:47] these
[1:23:49] videos that show monsters and all this
[1:23:53] horrible stuff is
[1:23:56] demonic it is absolutely
[1:23:59] demonic and I speak for one that's had
[1:24:02] problems with that in the past and I
[1:24:05] warn you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:06] don't never go that way don't ever go
[1:24:10] the devil's way no matter what it
[1:24:12] is you're messing with stuff that you
[1:24:18] we I better leave that
[1:24:20] alone well I don't know how got on
[1:24:23] that now we find out that brother rhom
[1:24:26] says this in a
[1:24:30] sermon forgive me I've got to put my
[1:24:33] lenses
[1:24:36] on do you think I'm being ugly
[1:24:39] tonight
[1:24:41] I you know I'm shouting up here but I
[1:24:45] don't mean to blast
[1:24:48] you brother Bram says this confessing
[1:24:50] our sins recking ourselves dead buried
[1:24:53] with him in baptism raised with him in
[1:24:55] his resurrection what to set in Heavenly
[1:24:57] places with him that's where we are at
[1:25:01] tonight sitting not physically
[1:25:04] spiritually our minds our thoughts our
[1:25:06] souls are far
[1:25:08] beyond the cares of the world right now
[1:25:10] what are we in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:25:13] Jesus how do we get into it by one
[1:25:15] Spirit he says in 1 Corinthians 12th
[1:25:19] chapter by one Spirit are we are all
[1:25:21] baptized by the holy goes into one body
[1:25:23] of Believers the mystical Kingdom of God
[1:25:27] in there we look back now listen to this
[1:25:29] in there we look back and see where we
[1:25:32] used to lie and steal and cheat and
[1:25:35] smoke and do the things that's wrong
[1:25:37] we've raised from
[1:25:40] that
[1:25:43] resurrected we we're in Heavenly places
[1:25:45] what is it the evidence that someday
[1:25:48] we'll have a body like his own glorious
[1:25:50] body it's the exact evidence of the
[1:25:53] Resurrection because
[1:25:54] potentially we are already raised with
[1:25:57] him potentially we've already
[1:26:03] died now here's the
[1:26:08] paragraph William renam that used to
[1:26:11] live doesn't live no
[1:26:13] more he's been dead some 30 odd years
[1:26:17] now it's a new
[1:26:19] creature listen to this Orman Neville
[1:26:23] that used to live isn't living
[1:26:27] anymore he died many years before that
[1:26:31] this is a new
[1:26:33] creature Orman Neville's
[1:26:36] dead the horse
[1:26:38] racer
[1:26:40] Gambler whatever he
[1:26:42] was the man that once lived is
[1:26:46] dead I don't know brother nille wasn't
[1:26:48] that but whatever it was he's guilty of
[1:26:51] all of it guilty of the least it's
[1:26:53] guilty of the whole ever what you were
[1:26:55] you are a sinner that's what you
[1:26:58] are now I jumped down a few
[1:27:01] paragraphs like to read more of this but
[1:27:03] we've limited on our time he says and
[1:27:07] look back where I once was now I'm above
[1:27:09] that why by his grace he Lifted Me Up
[1:27:13] and here I am now sitting in Heavenly
[1:27:15] places in Christ oh my there you are
[1:27:18] then the
[1:27:20] Bible now here here is the a key
[1:27:26] phrase then the Bible becomes a new book
[1:27:35] lord I pray that God will open our eyes
[1:27:38] tonight to recognize what is wrote
[1:27:41] between these
[1:27:43] covers and to recognize the voice of
[1:27:47] God and to
[1:27:50] recognize the voice of of
[1:27:53] Satan because the description is given
[1:27:58] in this
[1:28:00] book how Satan approached people how he
[1:28:04] talked to people caused people to
[1:28:07] stumble albe
[1:28:09] it
[1:28:13] temporarily and that's why Jesus brother
[1:28:16] Shan said when Satan said I got it right
[1:28:20] here Jesus it is written
[1:28:23] and Jesus says oh but it is also written
[1:28:29] again you left out part of it
[1:28:32] devil you ain't going to pull the W over
[1:28:34] my eyes it is also written
[1:28:38] again that's where our denominational
[1:28:41] friends get sold on these doctrines of
[1:28:44] devils that's how they get caught up and
[1:28:47] they don't believe in the the imbalance
[1:28:49] to predestination or the IMB bence to uh
[1:28:53] what was the other other side of the
[1:28:55] coin there uh
[1:28:58] arminianism they got all filed up on one
[1:29:01] side of the
[1:29:03] other because they don't see the
[1:29:06] junction of the scriptures they don't
[1:29:08] keep the middle of the road the crown of
[1:29:10] the
[1:29:15] road he
[1:29:17] says a new book you're reading it
[1:29:19] through spiritual eyes and spiritual
[1:29:21] understanding then you see the nouns and
[1:29:23] pronouns then you see the Junctions and
[1:29:25] conjunctions I mean so forth in the
[1:29:28] Bible
[1:29:30] now I'm just going to read one thing
[1:29:34] we've told this story several times I
[1:29:36] know other preachers here have preached
[1:29:38] on this I believe that brother brandom
[1:29:41] gave this vision for many many
[1:29:44] purposes and I believe this this thing
[1:29:47] this is why it's so important that's why
[1:29:49] Hosea I believe it's Hosea 46 my people
[1:29:51] people are destroyed for the lack of
[1:29:55] knowledge
[1:29:57] Revelation they're destroyed when you
[1:30:00] don't know what to do and you feel like
[1:30:02] you should be doing something but Satan
[1:30:05] has jumped in front of you somehow it
[1:30:08] kept you out of the word and you Mo
[1:30:10] immobilized your mind you got a lot of
[1:30:12] stuff up here instead of the word of God
[1:30:14] that's why I said even last Sunday some
[1:30:16] Baptist put us to shame and that ought
[1:30:18] not
[1:30:20] be every person in here ought to know
[1:30:22] the Bible frontwards and
[1:30:24] backwards at least to the extent that
[1:30:27] you could do it to know the
[1:30:30] scriptures the dry word as I would call
[1:30:32] it it's good to know the scripture
[1:30:37] amen goes for me too I'm preaching up
[1:30:42] myself brother brand said you know the
[1:30:46] story I I just call it this it's my my
[1:30:50] terminology so Sunday morning brother
[1:30:53] Bram wants to get breakfast he can't
[1:30:55] find it he's been in a holy ghost
[1:30:56] speeding up the street the sick are
[1:30:58] being healed demons cast up people
[1:31:01] getting saved filled with the Holy
[1:31:03] Ghost he's hungry little Amish or men
[1:31:07] night restaurant whatever it was isn't
[1:31:09] open on Sundays so he's got to go down
[1:31:11] to Joe's Bar and
[1:31:13] Grill and you know what was going on
[1:31:15] there we don't have to go into all the
[1:31:18] details you can look it up you can and
[1:31:20] brother Rand gets to and that poor woman
[1:31:22] turns out she was a daughter of a pastor
[1:31:26] and she knew brother Brandon was up the
[1:31:28] street preaching and having
[1:31:29] meetings she was horribly backslid
[1:31:32] entertaining men half drunk
[1:31:35] men a lot of devilish other stuff on
[1:31:38] going on in that
[1:31:41] place God made brother randam hungry
[1:31:44] that
[1:31:44] morning I don't know if he ever sat down
[1:31:47] and got
[1:31:49] breakfast but God had a purpose because
[1:31:51] cuz there was a sheep in there and maybe
[1:31:54] others I don't know he don't really say
[1:31:56] if there was but he had to have a
[1:31:59] testimony go from a holy ghost
[1:32:03] meeting this place ain't very
[1:32:06] clean some of us used to go in some of
[1:32:09] these places that uh you had to watch
[1:32:13] where you
[1:32:14] walk vomit all over the
[1:32:17] floor bartender didn't have time to mop
[1:32:20] it all up I'm just being
[1:32:24] plain I I don't know why we get to
[1:32:26] painting these sanctimonious pictures
[1:32:29] brother brand said a state police
[1:32:31] Trooper was over there playing a slot
[1:32:33] machine with his arm around the waist of
[1:32:35] some woman playing a gambling machine
[1:32:39] I'm not knocking I'm just telling you
[1:32:41] what he said there's a motorcycle gang
[1:32:44] in there young boys their pants halfway
[1:32:47] down and
[1:32:49] they're trying to get a date with some
[1:32:51] teenage girl or
[1:32:53] whatever that's the kind of environment
[1:32:55] that was in that place but little did
[1:32:58] they know the pillar of fire was about
[1:33:01] ready to manifest itself in a
[1:33:03] supernatural
[1:33:05] way and a man of God humbly goes in
[1:33:08] there he starts condemning that woman my
[1:33:10] God he said you I got to raise my
[1:33:12] children up in this kind of a
[1:33:13] world and the Holy
[1:33:16] Spirit starts grabing him by the
[1:33:18] shoulder I got to talk to you my my son
[1:33:22] takes some over beside the door and you
[1:33:23] know what happened the Earth the spray
[1:33:25] of blood around the earth he said that's
[1:33:29] the reason I you know I I can't quote
[1:33:31] the exact words I've got it up here but
[1:33:34] he
[1:33:35] said blood spraying around it every time
[1:33:37] I'd do something wrong my sin would go
[1:33:39] start before God God would slay me for
[1:33:42] it think about
[1:33:43] that but Jesus was standing there like a
[1:33:46] bumper he caught it I seen the tears run
[1:33:48] down his
[1:33:50] cheeks
[1:33:53] I went up to him he said Lord I'm
[1:33:55] ashamed of myself there laid my book my
[1:33:57] book my book not the Lamb's Book his old
[1:34:03] book Layon
[1:34:06] there his blood and he
[1:34:10] said wait a
[1:34:13] minute my sins were he said I do
[1:34:16] something else blad his blood would holy
[1:34:18] keep it from touching me from K from
[1:34:20] killing me God would kill me in the day
[1:34:23] you eat thereof he quotes the scripture
[1:34:24] in the day you eat thereof that you die
[1:34:27] and I looked at it there in the vision I
[1:34:29] went up to Lord I'm a shame of myself
[1:34:30] there laid my book laying there with all
[1:34:33] kinds of
[1:34:37] evil now I hear that really good cuz
[1:34:41] some of us that think the prophet was
[1:34:43] way up there so spiritual I could take
[1:34:46] you to a quot and show you where brother
[1:34:48] randam had to get his window in his
[1:34:50] house fixed to the second time cuz they
[1:34:53] locked their keys in there and then
[1:34:55] people say he was a master of all
[1:34:57] circumstance I beg the differ with you
[1:35:01] if he would have been that way that
[1:35:02] wouldn't have been fair to you and I he
[1:35:05] had the same battles a vehicle breaking
[1:35:08] down he had to he had those same things
[1:35:12] said he just had to win and repaired and
[1:35:15] don't lo and behold they locked the keys
[1:35:17] in the house again and he's got to go
[1:35:20] back to the routine again and break the
[1:35:23] window to get the door open from the
[1:35:30] inside is anybody hearing me he says I
[1:35:33] was hunting a grizzly somewhere up north
[1:35:36] and he said he I was trying to get a
[1:35:38] picture of him but he wouldn't cooperate
[1:35:40] with me he said I was riding a horse and
[1:35:43] that horse he just didn't want to be
[1:35:45] cooperative with
[1:35:48] me so you think you know he could get on
[1:35:51] a horse and that thing be wild as a buck
[1:35:54] a Bronco or whatever an unbroken horse
[1:35:57] and the horse just calms down oh I got a
[1:35:58] man of God on there I'm not saying it
[1:36:01] couldn't be couldn't have been that way
[1:36:03] sometimes that was sovereignly
[1:36:08] given and he said that horse in addition
[1:36:11] to the grizzly didn't want to cooperate
[1:36:13] with me I thank God for a man of God to
[1:36:16] just be honest say hey you're made I'm
[1:36:20] made all the same stuff you you all
[1:36:22] are that's the kind of a prophet I'm
[1:36:24] going to be able to
[1:36:25] follow you can't picture
[1:36:31] Jesus was Jesus a
[1:36:33] man did he eat did he sweat did he have
[1:36:38] a heart that pumped blood did he have a
[1:36:41] digestive
[1:36:44] tract where do we get this in our minds
[1:36:48] some Vision or some picture that we'
[1:36:50] seen years years ago religious picture
[1:36:53] of Jesus the holy Son of God and I'm not
[1:36:55] mocking that but it's created this image
[1:36:59] that wasn't Jesus at
[1:37:04] all he was made all the same stuff you
[1:37:08] he was
[1:37:09] tempted in all points as
[1:37:12] we in a l points as we so this image
[1:37:17] that somehow we've
[1:37:19] conjured and I tell you it comes from
[1:37:21] unbelief it comes when people try to
[1:37:24] interpret the word of God with a mental
[1:37:27] capability it don't work that way you
[1:37:29] find yourself way out on planet Pluto
[1:37:32] somewhere that's how far you get off the
[1:37:35] word that's how far that Branch prary
[1:37:37] goes out there some of them got out
[1:37:39] there and they don't know how to come
[1:37:41] back come back to the trunk of the
[1:37:46] tree
[1:37:49] well he he reached down he said did my
[1:37:53] sins cause you to die for me he's a l
[1:37:55] lamb please forgive my sins won't do it
[1:37:57] no more he reached down tapped his hand
[1:37:59] and like this wrote across my book with
[1:38:02] its own blood
[1:38:07] pardon I've done
[1:38:09] it he just chucked
[1:38:12] it yeah he chucked it brother Ram's old
[1:38:16] book after he wrote
[1:38:20] pardoned he didn't put it somewhere and
[1:38:22] said you know I've got A Sneak and
[1:38:25] hunch when you you still don't have
[1:38:28] faith when you have those kinds of
[1:38:29] thoughts about God you need to ask God
[1:38:32] to give you perfect
[1:38:34] Faith because you'll think if you're
[1:38:37] bone of his bone brother jiah and flesh
[1:38:39] of his flesh power of his power Spirit
[1:38:41] of his Spirit you and he are
[1:38:45] one you got a lot we got a lot going for
[1:38:48] us
[1:38:49] brother we got a whole lot going for us
[1:38:53] that's with the revelation of Truth
[1:38:55] which Satan tries to hide us from so he
[1:38:57] says Thank You Lord I'll do and and he
[1:39:00] goes on to say that
[1:39:03] anyway he opened up a new
[1:39:07] book I believe it was a Lamb's Book the
[1:39:10] Lord Brother Brandman had a page in
[1:39:13] there or a verse or whatever you've got
[1:39:16] you've got a place in there too your
[1:39:18] name's in there I believe my names in
[1:39:21] that book it was a new book and I like
[1:39:25] to say the book of Acts of the Holy
[1:39:27] Ghost he had brother randam the book of
[1:39:29] Acts and brother sha the book of Acts
[1:39:31] and brother Josiah by the Holy Ghost
[1:39:35] you'll write another book of Acts
[1:39:41] sister
[1:39:43] my
[1:39:48] now more we could read on that we'll see
[1:39:51] say that for another time brother Ram
[1:39:53] said since the opening of those
[1:39:55] seals
[1:39:58] this has become a new
[1:40:03] book that's what the seals did it un the
[1:40:08] lamb unlocked the
[1:40:10] Mysteries that had been tied up with
[1:40:12] denominational teachings and beliefs
[1:40:15] which originate from Satan by the way
[1:40:18] they tied up the word of God and Holy
[1:40:21] Ghost but when the evening time message
[1:40:23] when the lamb had opened the seals it
[1:40:26] also released the
[1:40:28] fullness of the Holy Ghost a very
[1:40:30] Supernatural life of God to come into
[1:40:32] the believer through a new
[1:40:36] birth cuz they couldn't have another
[1:40:41] living
[1:40:44] husband to get to that
[1:40:49] level now
[1:40:52] brother BR
[1:40:53] said and this is what we've talked about
[1:40:56] invisible
[1:40:58] Union here we are today L A see the
[1:41:00] bride just as clear you can't be a
[1:41:03] virtuous Bible believing Christian and
[1:41:04] Associate yourself in a denominational
[1:41:06] Affair you just can't do it at the same
[1:41:08] time one's got to be dead to let the
[1:41:11] other live in other words a woman can't
[1:41:14] have two living
[1:41:15] husbands neither can you bear God's word
[1:41:18] Sons neither can the church bring forth
[1:41:22] okay he goes on to say now it was nature
[1:41:26] associated with death the same invisible
[1:41:28] Union your first husband that had ruled
[1:41:31] over you was your Nature by natural
[1:41:33] birth natural you love the world because
[1:41:35] you are the world and part of the world
[1:41:37] your desires was by nature to love the
[1:41:39] world which you're a part
[1:41:42] of he says you're a part of nature you
[1:41:44] believe that and that's your natural
[1:41:46] thing that's the reason you have to be
[1:41:48] born again you have to separate you have
[1:41:51] to die to that first husband you can't
[1:41:54] live with it let me tell you something
[1:41:55] we're not preaching a Baptist sermon
[1:41:58] we're not preaching a Baptist message
[1:42:00] we're not preaching uh an Evangelical or
[1:42:03] whatever message we're preaching a word
[1:42:05] message ordained for the
[1:42:07] hour that produ Supernatural
[1:42:13] person you have to separate you have to
[1:42:15] die to that first husband you can't live
[1:42:17] with it no sir well he says I well you
[1:42:21] just can't say well I'll divorce them
[1:42:22] hang him up here till the
[1:42:24] occasion now ain't don't work that
[1:42:29] way no sir no writing our divorcement he
[1:42:32] dies the nature of the world has to die
[1:42:34] every Speck of him has to die you have
[1:42:37] to be reunited again with another nature
[1:42:40] he goes on to say the call of the Holy
[1:42:42] Spirit searching the hearts you're
[1:42:43] standing completely you never sin in the
[1:42:46] first place God don't even know it's in
[1:42:48] the sea of forgetfulness and in the sea
[1:42:51] of
[1:42:57] forgetfulness Paul the Apostle at the
[1:43:00] church of
[1:43:03] Corinth there was the elect
[1:43:05] predestinated seat of God in that place
[1:43:09] you talk about a lens
[1:43:11] sensual
[1:43:13] place because it lists sins and Paul
[1:43:16] goes on to mention even
[1:43:18] effeminate there was this there was
[1:43:21] there was all kinds of immoral impurity
[1:43:24] immoral
[1:43:25] Lifestyles but
[1:43:27] God saw
[1:43:30] seeds God saw a son God saw a daughter
[1:43:34] in that
[1:43:36] prostitute when our precious brother
[1:43:38] Paul
[1:43:41] oh oh
[1:43:43] my oh when need preach the gospel many
[1:43:48] the Devils came out of out of people and
[1:43:50] they begin to live holy
[1:43:54] lives and they come to church like
[1:43:57] this and no doubt a woman come in and a
[1:44:01] man come
[1:44:02] in and they greet one another God bless
[1:44:05] you Sister God bless you brother maybe
[1:44:08] she had been a woman of ill Fame and he
[1:44:12] was one of their clients her
[1:44:19] class
[1:44:21] are you all hearing
[1:44:23] me I remember what God told Peter in
[1:44:28] that that that that that sheet that came
[1:44:31] down what God has
[1:44:34] cleansed oh
[1:44:36] my and Paul brought that communion wine
[1:44:41] and that
[1:44:42] bread and he began to serve it and Paul
[1:44:45] knowing their
[1:44:46] backgrounds yet the love that he felt
[1:44:49] because there part of the
[1:44:54] body and the precious Bond of love was
[1:44:57] in that place dur that communion service
[1:44:59] here was hands that had been hands and
[1:45:01] fingers of
[1:45:04] iniquity and sin and
[1:45:08] transgressions now they're alive in
[1:45:10] Christ Paul with tears streaming Downs
[1:45:13] his cheeks looks at trophies of
[1:45:17] Grace trophies of the Gospel transformed
[1:45:23] lives the same
[1:45:27] woman same
[1:45:29] boy walking down the street this time
[1:45:32] instead of acting like little
[1:45:37] walking with his hair
[1:45:42] trimmed in a look of
[1:45:46] Innocence don't tell me the blood can't
[1:45:49] give you that kind of experience oh yes
[1:45:52] it can and that woman who was a
[1:45:56] harlot that sold herself and that was a
[1:45:59] practice back then may have even had
[1:46:02] diseases in her own
[1:46:05] body he yet she was made
[1:46:08] Holy by the precious blood of Jesus
[1:46:10] Christ and she comes through that line
[1:46:12] and Paul's crying thank you Lord Jesus
[1:46:15] God bless you my sister and she he and
[1:46:18] his deacons serve her the bread and the
[1:46:20] wi

[1:46:47] Son of
[1:46:48] God Amen
[1:46:51] seen that innocent looking
[1:46:55] woman he say
[1:46:58] innocent
[1:47:08] yeah yes innocent as the
[1:47:12] lamb walking down the street
[1:47:15] say they're over there chisling on
[1:47:19] blocks of marble
[1:47:22] whoa who was
[1:47:26] that she look
[1:47:29] familiar wasn't that the party
[1:47:32] girl that we went to
[1:47:37] see what's happened to
[1:47:42] her
[1:47:46] transformation even in that
[1:47:49] vessel
[1:47:51] that's the power of the
[1:47:53] Gospel the power of God to
[1:47:56] transform you would never think they had
[1:47:59] such a
[1:48:04] profession
[1:48:06] why is it mentioned that's the theme
[1:48:09] tonight Paul
[1:48:11] said it's for
[1:48:14] examples in the book of First
[1:48:16] Corinthians they are given for
[1:48:19] admonishing us
[1:48:21] the history of the elect now I'm going
[1:48:24] to drop something on
[1:48:26] you I'm going to have to wind this
[1:48:32] up see the new
[1:48:35] book you read the Old
[1:48:38] Testament it's a temporary written
[1:48:43] record that
[1:48:45] God does
[1:48:48] not even remember
[1:48:54] now what is what we have
[1:48:57] now is what they had what they also
[1:49:02] possess so you see why the accuser this
[1:49:04] book is all over the
[1:49:06] world and it tells the good the bad the
[1:49:10] ugly the righteous and the
[1:49:13] evil I got a list up
[1:49:17] here this this is what really hit
[1:49:23] me Adam and Eve the
[1:49:27] fall Noah got
[1:49:29] drunk job
[1:49:31] questioned Jacob
[1:49:35] deceived Abraham lied Sarah
[1:49:43] laughed look at Judah one of the sons of
[1:49:46] I believe was
[1:49:47] Jacob well he was a carnal man
[1:49:52] Joseph lied he's guilty and Elise is
[1:49:54] guilty the whole don't whitewash it all
[1:49:58] have sinned and come short of the glory
[1:49:59] of God yes he was a man he was truly
[1:50:04] elect God was preserving him God kept
[1:50:08] him he would have kept Judah well I
[1:50:11] better not go down that
[1:50:14] road but when he was in Piper's house
[1:50:17] God had placed Integrity in his heart
[1:50:20] don't tell me he wasn't
[1:50:21] tempted but he would not displease the
[1:50:25] Lord but he told a lie he caved Under
[1:50:29] Pressure because Pharaoh did not like
[1:50:33] Shepherds they were cattle
[1:50:36] raisers and then we
[1:50:38] find sins of
[1:50:41] Jacob how he did what he did
[1:50:46] deception Moses killed an Egyptian
[1:50:50] Soldier or guard he got
[1:50:57] angry
[1:50:59] Samuel man he was a real prophet of God
[1:51:01] but look what happened to his sons and
[1:51:04] I'm not casting blame on him but just
[1:51:07] look at look at what happened that
[1:51:08] follow at some of these people jeffa
[1:51:11] he's found in the book of Hebrews we
[1:51:13] spoke on him a lot of people don't want
[1:51:15] to accept it he's I believe he was elect
[1:51:17] of God God puts his place here is seed
[1:51:21] sometimes in the most peculiar
[1:51:24] places the strangest places that we
[1:51:26] can't even
[1:51:30] understand I could tell you people in
[1:51:32] this
[1:51:33] message but I'm not going to do it I'd
[1:51:36] happen to know people in this message
[1:51:38] that have
[1:51:39] really
[1:51:41] God has done great things in their
[1:51:45] lives I I could go further with that but
[1:51:49] I better not
[1:51:53] Samson great man of God
[1:51:56] womanizer he just couldn't stay with his
[1:51:59] own he had to go down there and mess
[1:52:00] around with the very ones that God
[1:52:02] called him to deliver Israel from he
[1:52:05] starts messing around
[1:52:07] with Elijah run from a
[1:52:10] woman David guilty of adultery and
[1:52:16] murder Elisha angry prophet
[1:52:20] yeah Jonah
[1:52:24] complexes I wonder if he wasn't maybe a
[1:52:26] had a little bit of uh what do you call
[1:52:28] it uh not Grace but uh what's the other
[1:52:31] word for that can't think of it right
[1:52:34] now but he thought judgment should
[1:52:36] strike you that's that was his mindset
[1:52:40] God had to teach him a
[1:52:41] lesson but he's still an elect of God
[1:52:44] Peter lied over in the New
[1:52:47] Testament denied the Lord and cursed
[1:52:53] even after they got the Holy
[1:52:56] Ghost they had sharp contention between
[1:52:58] some of the Apostles and the different
[1:53:01] workers evangelists or whatever that
[1:53:02] were with them you remember John Mark
[1:53:04] and all of
[1:53:05] that that's a written
[1:53:07] record but you want to know something in
[1:53:11] the mind of God it never happen in the
[1:53:14] first place they're
[1:53:17] Justified yet we read it why because
[1:53:20] Paul said it's there for an example
[1:53:22] nobody walks up to anybody over there in
[1:53:25] that other realm and says if I just
[1:53:27] don't under why in why that kind of
[1:53:31] thinking ain't going to make it in there
[1:53:34] let this mind be in you which was in
[1:53:36] Christ
[1:53:38] Jesus if you have the mind of God you
[1:53:42] ain't going to walk up to David and say
[1:53:44] David what in the world why didn't you
[1:53:46] get off that
[1:53:48] rooftop
[1:53:52] but yet the Bible says he was a man
[1:53:53] after God's Own
[1:53:56] Heart brother BR said Saul was saved so
[1:53:59] King
[1:54:01] Saul David didn't walk up to Saul
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:07] Saul you slayed your thousands why did
[1:54:09] you why were you trying to kill me on
[1:54:13] Earth that thinking didn't make it over
[1:54:15] there thank God for that no doubt when
[1:54:18] they Join one another
[1:54:20] David come with open
[1:54:22] arms oh my precious brother why I don't
[1:54:26] I don't know the the full extent of
[1:54:28] everything there but I'll tell you one
[1:54:30] thing there was no
[1:54:32] evil
[1:54:34] anymore to trouble
[1:54:38] people especially when that blood was
[1:54:40] made retroactive there at the cross and
[1:54:43] went backwards he led captivity out of
[1:54:46] that prison cell of
[1:54:48] paradise
[1:54:50] there's nobody over there fighting each
[1:54:52] other right now that is all
[1:54:57] forgotten they're all Justified
[1:55:00] except those who
[1:55:03] rejected those who died in the flood
[1:55:06] can they're still got a record that
[1:55:09] exists that God still remembers because
[1:55:12] they didn't accept the preaching of
[1:55:15] Noah they've got to come up to right
[1:55:17] Throne judgment the men of Sodom have to
[1:55:19] come up there
[1:55:20] Dayan and Cor in their crowd they got to
[1:55:22] come up to the great white Throne

[1:55:36] lost they got to come up at the great wi
[1:55:38] Throne judgment there's a record there
[1:55:40] for them God can't forget that they
[1:55:43] didn't repent their sins are following
[1:55:45] them to
[1:55:47] judgment now
[1:55:50] here we have all these people but God
[1:55:54] doesn't even remember Moses getting
[1:55:58] angry he doesn't remember the sins of
[1:56:03] David David even said I believe he was
[1:56:05] in one BL blessed is man whose God does
[1:56:07] not impute sin unto
[1:56:11] him though he's
[1:56:13] forgotten never cast into the sea of
[1:56:16] God's forgetfulness let's just
[1:56:18] stand
[1:56:21] it's Cast Away it's over it's
[1:56:25] finished they're waiting on you and I
[1:56:28] they're waiting on you and
[1:56:32] I and then we'll all be caught up
[1:56:34] together to meet the Lord in the air
[1:56:36] you're waiting on us God doesn't have to
[1:56:39] go back to the past with his elect and
[1:56:42] and get get think it's already squared
[1:56:46] away I I had a quote up here and I don't
[1:56:49] know if I can read it here in closing
[1:56:51] taken from the church age book it's
[1:56:53] showing that God
[1:56:56] forgets I want you to watch this
[1:56:58] carefully now and see something really
[1:57:00] sweet and beautiful I said This is the
[1:57:02] End Time revelation of himself when the
[1:57:05] day of Grace
[1:57:06] closes then the Millennium comes very
[1:57:09] shortly thereafter doesn't it well read
[1:57:10] with me Isaiah 65:16 and 19 and he I
[1:57:14] won't take the time to read all of this
[1:57:16] but he says because the former troubles
[1:57:19] are forgotten because they are HID from
[1:57:21] mine eyes for behold I create new
[1:57:22] Heavens new Earth former Earth former
[1:57:25] shall not be remembered nor come into
[1:57:30] mind you're already in that place you're
[1:57:34] already there you're You're A New Earth
[1:57:37] brother Sean we're A New Earth so to
[1:57:40] speak we're made God has Tabernacle
[1:57:43] himself in us the inner man we're ruling
[1:57:46] this outer
[1:57:48] man
[1:57:50] he says for behold I create new Heavens
[1:57:52] new
[1:57:54] Earth nor shall not be remembered nor
[1:57:56] coming into mind but be ye glad and
[1:57:58] rejoice he goes on to finish that
[1:58:01] scripture this is about the New
[1:58:03] Jerusalem this is a millennium but as we
[1:58:05] go into the Millennium hear what he says
[1:58:06] about being a certain kind of God verse
[1:58:09] 16 that he who blessed himself in the
[1:58:11] Earth shall bless himself in the god of
[1:58:14] truth yes that is true but the real
[1:58:17] translation is not God of Truth it is is
[1:58:19] God of the amen so we read it shall
[1:58:23] bless himself in the god of the amen and
[1:58:25] he that sweareth in the Earth shall
[1:58:28] swear by the god of the amen because the
[1:58:30] former
[1:58:31] troubles are
[1:58:34] forgotten
[1:58:36] wow the former troubles are forgotten
[1:58:40] because they are HID from my eyes for
[1:58:42] behold I created new heavens and a new
[1:58:45] Earth the former shall not
[1:58:47] be REM remembered nor come into mine but
[1:58:51] be ye glad and rejoice
[1:58:56] forever he
[1:58:58] says finishing this word verse I create
[1:59:01] Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people of
[1:59:03] Joy I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy
[1:59:07] my people in the voice of weeping shall
[1:59:10] be heard in her nor the voice of crying
[1:59:14] Hallelujah here is Jehovah of the Old
[1:59:17] Testament the god of the amen here is
[1:59:19] Jesus of the New Testament the god of
[1:59:21] the amen here over Israel the Lord thy
[1:59:24] God is
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:30] one there's actually another quote
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:35] here now if I can find
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:43] that but God has
[1:59:48] completely it's here on paper it's
[1:59:51] around the world of all these elect sins
[1:59:55] it's there Satan knows it but there's
[1:59:58] another promise in there that says he's
[2:00:01] cast all sins into the sea of his
[2:00:03] forgetfulness so Satan the accuser comes
[2:00:05] up says well Sister Lisa there she's got
[2:00:09] a record she did this she did that the
[2:00:12] other day and
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:16] accuses oh there's people even heard it
[2:00:18] and there going around you see Lord over
[2:00:21] there they're gossiping about Sister
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:25] Lisa yeah
[2:00:27] really but Satan you missed
[2:00:30] something I see her down there on the
[2:00:32] knees confessing to me her sin and
[2:00:35] getting right with the Lord getting
[2:00:37] right with
[2:00:38] me I don't know what sin you're even
[2:00:40] talking about because I I don't remember
[2:00:44] it
[2:00:48] Satan
[2:00:50] stop and think about
[2:00:52] that despite a written
[2:00:55] record in the mind of God and I say to
[2:00:58] you what really is God's
[2:01:02] word when you read in the Book of
[2:01:04] Genesis in the beginning God created the
[2:01:06] heavens and the Earth and he saw that it
[2:01:09] was good and he created he created and
[2:01:12] then you hear the hiss of the serpent
[2:01:14] that wasn't God's word Eve was trying to
[2:01:17] recognize something
[2:01:19] has God
[2:01:21] said look at all these other things
[2:01:23] where it tells the mistakes and
[2:01:27] Disobedience that people made that
[2:01:29] wasn't God's word but it's there as an
[2:01:32] example someday the written record of
[2:01:34] that is going to disappear
[2:01:37] forever it'll not even come into mind it
[2:01:41] ain't even in God's mind now and it
[2:01:43] really we're we're still troubled by
[2:01:46] memory we remember we remember you know
[2:01:49] the Holy Spirit can come down and anoint
[2:01:51] us to preach things that God has
[2:01:55] completely forgotten and he don't
[2:01:57] remember it I can stand up here and say
[2:02:00] it and say it and say it about David and
[2:02:02] Noah and all these others but God don't
[2:02:04] even remember it it don't jog his memory
[2:02:07] it don't bring it up out of some deep
[2:02:09] memory B cuz it's not even
[2:02:11] [Music]
