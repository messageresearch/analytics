this evening hope y'all can uh pray for me I I hit some allergies and then um I was at a home builder Expo and I talked to probably over 500 people while I was there and my voice is shot and then of course it caused me to start coughing so if I get into a coffin fit I have a couple couple cough drops so y'all have to forgive me if I have to get them all right amen do do do do you love the Lord the the Lord this evening amen let's turn into the scriptures to uh Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one amen Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one amen when you're there just just say just say amen amen God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hathen these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world who who being who who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the by the word of his power when he have when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high amen let's all bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you and Lord how thankful we are father to be able to come in your presence just once more father and just sit at your feet and worship you and Lord we ask you father now just just uh just just to come on down lord this evening and walk the aisles and touch each and every heart life here Lord we ask you father that this this thought that's on my heart we ask you Lord just to let it come out father as and and and make sense to the people Lord and just let it let just and just let it be real to them we pray we love you and thank you in Jesus name amen I me y'all can have your seats um I wanted to speak a little bit tonight on um on the unchanging God um it's it's it's kind of been on my heart for a while and um so if it seems like maybe from the last time I preached it's similar you guys have to forgive me I it's just been all my heart and I couldn't really really get get get get get get away from it but uh but but but if you look in the scripture here it says God in Sury times and diverse manners and in that sundry and divers man manners means in in in in in in in in in in in many ways and diverse ways have he he he he he has spoken to us spoken to us through through through the prophets um but and and what he's done is he's identified himself to us through the prophets um um throughout the Old Testament and so so so so so so so so we notice now now that um that that that that that he has he's showcasing his characteristics of himself by identifying himself to us to us through through the prophets through the prophets throughout the Old Testament he's he's he's um and but but and and and brother brand and brother brand brother brandham said it was the prophets and their Visions Vindicated who God's characteristics was it was made known by the prophets by the prophets visions and and he says and he says and he says and in in in another place he says it's God's placing he sends a man takes the word of that age but now before you can believe that word of that age he identifies himself in his characteristics see by knowledge by by Vision he told things that would happened and it happens and God said when that happens when when when when you believe he has the interpretation of the word because the word of the Lord comes to this man and his and his and his and his credentials he is identified by being a seer in the Old Testament just as plain as can be his characteristics is identified made known his characters so so so so so so so so we know we know we know we know we know with the scriptures and and and with what the prophet has taught us that that that that that that that the prophets were was God was God to to those people in the Old Testament um Jesus said Jesus said if if you call them if you call them who the word of who who the word of God came to God God he said how can you how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God see see so so so so so where the word that's been spoken by God is Vindicated then that's then that's been spoken by God is a Vindicated and this brother brandom said then that is god making himself known by his characteristics fulfilling his word it needs no interpretation it's already interpreted itself it proves what it is just the same as he said let there be light and there was light you don't have to say well what did that means it just means there it is that proves it it's already come to pass now Jesus said if I do not the works of my father or other words if you if you don't have the characteristics of my father don't believe it they they identify my character who I am if you can't believe me then I believe the identification that God has has then believe the identification that God has that God has given he he said he said he said if my if my character identify my my my position then don't believe my claims a a amen so so so so we notice now if when Jesus come come come he couldn't have come with with with with Noah with with with with Noah's message he had to come with with with the message for his day and and if Jesus had had showed up and was preaching that that God was going what that God was going to to to to send a flood we we we would see that it was out of the the the season because God had placed Noah in his time in his season to preach to preach that that that a FL was coming and and a a and and to board the ark we notice that Noah was the only man the only man that that that could have have have preached that Moses couldn't have preached it and Noah couldn't have preach preached preached preached preached preached Moses's Moses's this message each man had to preach what God sent to them in their time and then their place and their calling if if they came in in in in in any in any other time it wouldn't have worked because um but now we notice though that that Noah was God and a portion Moses was God was God was God in a in a portion they were made they were made manifested fested in in in in in their word for for their hour they were the word made made expressed for their hour but Jesus could not come in their age and and and and and die and Jesus Jesus Jesus could not come come in that in that way because it was out of the time and out of the season and besides that the Bible had never said that that that that he was he was going to he was going to he was going to come come that come come that that that that that way but but but brother brand brother brandom said when he come expressed exactly like the New Testament exactly like the Old Testament had said he he said that he that that he would be expressed and all those who who was who was re redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to God as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God because they were they was re re redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression and and and in Joel 2 2 22 in Joel 228 he he he he um brother brother brand said he promised that in these last days there would be a latter rain poured out upon the people in the last days and I think the Greek word there is kenos which means that he emptied himself out not in the way that we would say like something was inside of of of of somebody that that he emptied out but he poured him himself out he changed he he he said it his inor he changed from what he was to to what he is he never changes his nature but on the day of but on the day of Pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the Son of God he came not he he he he came not he came not with the people he he he came in the people see the same God to carry his ministry on through in this great age and in Joel 2 2:28 it says and it shall come to pass that that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young man shall see Visions so so a supernatural God had rose up had rose up Jesus Jesus Jesus supernaturally he and and and and he presented him alive alive alive to to to to to to to the Earth that in Abraham's seed in these last days in in in the last days he would show that same Supernatural seed that super seed in these last days that that that the same seed that he showed in Jesus's day and the same seed that he showed in in Abraham's day he was going to show again in these last days it says as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man why and and and where where where where where when th when those three men showed up showed up out there on the Plains and two of them went went down there to to to Sodom and Gomorrah and the one man and the one man stayed back and and he asked Abraham he said where is thy wife Sarah and he said she's in the tent behind you and Sarah laughed up up up her her her sleeve and and and and and and and Abraham called him Elohim Elohim the the the the god manifested in flesh turned turn turn to Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh and and and brother bandam said said that that that same Supernatural seed that that that was that was his super sign showing his characteristics showing just exactly who he was turned he turned he he when when he turned to Abraham and and he said why did why did why did did did did did did laugh and from that Vindicated sign there was not another one all the way up until Christ walked the Earth Earth Earth Earth when God when God Vindicated or when Christ Vindicated the hearts and lives of man man there was there has never been another one has has never been another one has never been another one since then until the days of of willing of brandom and and these last days when when when those two men and brother brandom called them called them Billy Graham and and and and Oral Roberts and they came to preach he brother rown called it to the denominational people he said he he he said he he said he he and and and and he said he said when Elohim stayed behind and talk and talked and talk to Abraham that was that was to the bride and and and and and those other two was was to the denominational churches trying to pull the people out out out out out of of judgment but but yet but yet we look we can see it's not a theological sign it's it wasn't it was wasn't a um a um um a a psychological sign it was a super it was a supernatural sign it was our super sign that that go pointing out what God was to show us again in these last days what was it it was a messiah in in in in human flesh it was a super sign the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the resurrected the resurrected Messiah living in a people it's it's he's in the seat of Abraham it it becomes this and brother Ram said it's the same Supernatural seed will believe like their father a a Abra did if they are the same seed they will believe the same sign he said Glory he said he said two of them went down and preached and and preached in and preached in Sodom which is a modern testimony testimony testimony today those are three classes of of people Sodom and the church in Sodom and Abraham the the elected is not in the and or say Abraham the elected is not in Sodom two Messengers a modern Billy Graham and and remember of all the messengers of all the messengers of all the messengers to the church there's never been a man that went out in that in that church in that church in that church nominal nominal out there ending ending his name with hm before he said it's been a finny sanki Knox Calvin and so forth Billy Sunday and everything else but never g r a h a or anything ending with h which means the father of Nations and there he went he went that he went down there down there preaching he said look at the hour he's the make Believers unbelievers and and the Believers he he said there's there's three men come two of them went down to a city a modern Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts and Oral Roberts down amongst the people preaching the setting Jesus referred referred referred to it so so so so we can sit there and sit back and and and and and and we can now see that these denominational churches are just in Sodom and Gomorrah they will and that's and that's all they are but yeah that's why we as as as as message Believers we have to take them we have to take them to a living God to a living to a living to a living reality showing exactly who this promises seed is those those those those angels those angels that that that that that that that that went down there they they never discuss the promises with them they they they they never discuss did did discuss um um a Abraham's ham Abraham's SE see coming forth the only thing thing that they preached was get out right so so so we as the bride of Christ and we as message Believers can can sit here and see and and see the trouble that's all around us we it is our I feel like it's our solemn Duty and and and and and and and and and and and should be our our great honor to sit there and as brother brother Shan has been preaching to present the message of Jesus Christ C Christ to a dying people why because the Baptist they have nothing to offer methodists have nothing to offer Pentecostals have nothing to offer anymore why because because they are dead and dried up at the roots the bride of Christ is coming forth in such a great power and and an authority where where she can stand forth with all authority and all Assurance assurance and declaring that Jesus Christ is alive in our midst M mid midst still um so so so so um um um and so we get to look at now the the um um Abraham called him called him called called that man Elohim and which which means he all sufficient one he he's he he was identified in a human body body and he sat there and he ate the and he ate the meat of a calf and and and drank the milk and and and and and and but but yet Elohim identified the characteristics of of God God and sunre times and diverse manner spake to us but go Elohim identified the characteristics of God and Abraham called him God he was identified as Elohim and and and and the Bible said that it said that that Abraham's body was as good as dead and Sarah womb and Sarah's womb was all dried up but yet Abraham but but Abraham staggered not at the promise of God when when it seemed like all when see when it seemed like that all that that all of hell that all of hell that all of hell was against him he was able to stand on that on that promise knowing knowing that he that he that he that he who had made the promise was just and willing and willing to to to to to to to to fulfill it right um um um um in Elohim that self-existing one Elohim in in in human flesh again in these last days what was it a sign of brother random that said said said brother brother random said what what is it is it a sign of Elohim back in the bride again human flesh in the last days doing the same thing where is it at there's your sign for these last days why when when and in Zechariah and Zechariah 14:7 says there can there will be a day that that that that that cannot be called day day day nor night it's a dismal a rainy day like like like um but it says in the evening time it shall be light and and and as the sun as the sun will rise in the in the East and sets in the west so so so so so has has has has has has Christianity as as we all know but but but but they've had organizations they've had just enough light to build to build churches and organizations and and seminaries and but but but but but but yet just dust enough light to sit there and say to sign their name on a book and accept Christ and and to say oh I'm I'm a Pentecostal or I'm a Methodist or I'm a Baptist but brother Bram said in the evening light in the evening time it shall be light what is that he said that Gospel Light what does that do the holy spirit is what does it it ripens the crop in the last days the holy spirit will pour out in time in the last days to bring in the latter rain the real rain but first how how how how how he said that but first how are you going to H how you going to have a rain when we're still planting denominational seeds bringing forth more more more unbelief all the time he said why don't you plant the gospel seed and bring forth the power of God in the resurrection there's the Last Day signs this is his promise friends and in another place in another place he said this stumps grow has grow from Wesley through Luther to to to Wesley to Pentecost and now it's honing out these Pentecostals and all them and all those that's got the bapt that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and shall come someday The Headstone Jesus Christ in these last days and we will have a we will have to have a Ministry just exactly like his like like his whole Spirit as it gets closer and closer and closer the negative becomes so positive that after while that after while the negative and and positive and positive have blend blend negative and positive Blends together Christ and and church to make one for we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone amen we believe it it shall be light in the evening time amen we're here we're uh we are here we are here today you you believe it so so so so so we look at um at grafting these trees and stuff brother random has has talked about this many times and and and I would really encourage anybody to to go and listen to it because it it's quite powerful what he says but but how how how you this farmer could could take a tree and it might be an orange tree let's say it's in the Citrus say it's it's it's in the citrus family and it because it comes up the the original tree is an orange but they've started to cut they would Graft in these lemons um um grapefruit anything Citrus anything anything that with Citrus it would be grafted in and it would take root and take life and and and every year after year that same branch that was grafted would produce a lemon or it would produce or the other Branch might produce a grapefruit and the other Branch the original Branch will keep on on on on on producing an orange year after year after year but but but yet when we as when we as the bride of Christ when that when that Sprout that came up that that that came up and and It produced an an orange an orange branch and yet all these denominational kept graft again and graft again and graft again but yet in these last days it has put forth another branch and that and that branch and and and and and that original tree is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she has put forth her herself another branch and the bride the bride has come forth has come forth standing and she and and she is just like and she is just like the original which is Christ why why because each each each but yet each each each each one of these branches it's it's it's coming forth that they that they that they've drafted in it's just suck it's just sucking on the life of on the life of of of of that original tree and and they and they might they might can say oh I'm a Christian I'm a Christian see see me I'm attached I'm attached here but but yet it's not of the original why why it's nothing it has become nothing but a hybrid dried up dried up denominational branch and and and and and and someday soon and someday soon she's going to be hued off and thrown in the fire and and and and and now the original the original tree has put forth another Branch when when when Christ when Christ was in the ground and and up came and it started coming up on up through through through through through Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals and now it's come forth and and it's manifested itself another original branch and it has come forth as the bride of Christ it is the same exact same exact thing that had went go down and died has come forth up again the original the exact same thing we are Christ in these last days why because so now that that says we have the same exact Authority the same exact exact attributes that Christ had with what Christ had died for every attribute that that that that Christ died for we can now stand in all assurance and all confidence knowing knowing that we are of that of of of that original tree why we can stand here with all authority and all confidence in and the winds can blow the the the the the storms may come at us but what we have an anchor we can stand here with all confidence and all authority Jesus said that I am the vine and ye are the branches if and and and and and and and if that if that the first branch has put forth um love joy and loyalty and the fruits of the spirit that the the next original branch has to put forth the same exact thing if if if if if that original if if if that original branch that um um um um um um um spoken tongues cast out Spirits believed in in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and and and and and and that that that that next branch has to come forth and and produce the same exact thing we're not going to sit there and and keep going well if we just sprinkle Lord if you baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost or or or or the days of Miracles has passed or or or or or or God don't move exactly like you like like like you used to anymore that's nothing but a grafted denominational denominational rotten Branch but but but and and brother Rand said any church that's professing to be Christian Christians Thrive off of the glory and Praises of Christ but it can't bear the fruit it won't bear it won't bear The Life of Christ until Christ puts forth that Branch himself then it'll write another book of Acts behind it because it's the acts of the holy spirit in the church see that's the way it is tonight Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so that's why I say it's it's so important say exactly what's on those tapes why because it is the original it is the original Pentecostal the original Pentecost back in our midst again um so so so so we can sit there and look at it and see and see that God had taken one man and and and in in the wilderness he uh he he he he he he he he he he he he trained him up and brought him back and and and and and and and and and and and he came back and took the thing over and brought the children of Israel and brought the children of Israel out out out of the land of Egypt but but God cannot ever change his his program he is God he he he will and brother Bram said that he never deals he never deals wi with a group he never did he says he deals with an individual and he said he did and he will and he's promised even in Malachi 4 he would do it again that's right so then there is his promise what he was promis what he said that that that what he said that he said what he would do and here we are what a people happy we should be given them the sign by his promised word sign promised word his promise that he would do it and they shall restore the hearts of the faith of the people and the hearts of the people back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers he promised to do it showing he he his his signs prise the Lord yes and and and as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be again in the day in the days in the days of the coming of the coming of the son of man they shall eat they shall drink they they shall be they shall give in marriage they shall they shall be taken in marriage but but yet while all the all the Sodom when all the Sodom conditions is is is is is is going around round up up in on the back back side of the desert is Elohim and Abraham communing one onone they they they are fellowshipping with each other they're walking and they're talking with each other and and honestly whatever's happening in Sodom is happening in Sodom we as a bride of Christ can sit there and sit back and commune with with Elohim God manifested in flush again and and it doesn't matter matter matter what comes our way it doesn't matter the storm's going to blow all hell can come against us we are in community we are in fellowship with with Elohim God in flesh again why as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man we see the Holy Spirit Among Us he's working Among Us he's doing the same things he's working in human flesh again it's the hour see we're just we're we're we are here we are at the threshold of the coming of the Son of God where we get to go home and exodus is on why [Music] why it it's just the same Holy Spirit again tonight and and and that he promised that he would send in these last days that same holy spirit that fell that fell that fell on on the days of Pentecost cost is here again is here again tonight why because because he's walking with us he's talking with us he's communing with us he's living and breathing through us why when when he promised us in Mark 16 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature oh um and these signs shall follow them that that that that that that these signs shall follow them that Bel why and it's not it's not for the unbeliever it's not for the makeb believer it's not it's not it's not for them that's down in Sodom it's for us here on the back side of the desert with with with our God why why because because he's promised us the former Reign and the latter reign and and and and and and and brother R said now said we're living now and have been for years under the latter rain see and and he says here in another spot he says so the hour has come for the repeat of the Bible and the fulfilling of the word now God promised that he was going to send a former rain and a latter rain and he promised the former and the latter rain in the latter rain or no he promised the former rain and the latter rain yeah in the latter rain so in other words it's a double portion like the Garment of Elisha when Elijah when Elijah dropped it Elisha picked it up and had a double portion he was a type he was he was a type as a type of the of the church and Christ Christ was taken up and The Same Spirit and the same spirit that was upon Christ is on the church on is is on the church is on the church on the church tonight the Holy Ghost see NE never never nevertheless if you see me go away is he and took the Garment and now he struck the Jordan said let the he where be the god of Elijah let the god of Elijah speak speak to us and and and and and yet we have so many people even in in these message ranks that say oh it's it's it's it's psychology or it's a mental it's a mental telepathy or oh that was just his opinion or or or or or or or or whatever whatever it is whatever it is they may say God has shown his super sign again in these last days who where where where where he sat there when he was s there he was he was Discerning the thoughts and intents of the hearts and the audiences and he said so you may know and he turns around with his back to the audience and starts calling him out showing that's the same super sign the same Supernatural God that that that was that was in the flesh of Elohim in those last days and the same flesh that was in Christ it came came to flesh in these last days again showing that he is the same yesterday today and for forever and we as the bride say amen he says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh well there will be a former rain and and and a latter rain where the former and and latter rain would come together as a double portion and we as a bride of Christ can sit here and just and be and and be the Bene the beneficiaries of all of it where and brother R says says that that then if we see what the former Reign has with the former rain produced how much more will the latter rain will the latter rain will the latter rain produce when God pours out his Spirit there will be signs and wonders wonder and wonders and wonders and wonders take place as I was speaking not not long ago he said when omnipotent speaks miracles happen it has to and that word word word and that and that word and that word omnipotence means means means basically it's I can't the exact definition of but but it basically means the Mighty God the the he who cannot be defeated he who who is everything he he he he he's he's he he's everything to everyone and why because so so when we when so when God has spoken forth Miracles Miracles just start happening why why because because because the Mighty God has spoken and we who are of that original vine have have spoken back amen and we receive it amen and in Exodus 14:1 he says and they said on on onto Moses because there were no graves in in in in in in in because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die to die in in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt has thou as thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt and said is is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyp Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians that than than than that we should die in in in in the wilderness and Moses said on un un un Moses said unto the people fear ye not and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever and the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou c c criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward so so so so so those those those that children the the children of of of Israel will sat there and there were all congreg Cong congregated around Moses and all of a sudden that Red Sea begin to open up and they begin to March through it and when they and they and as they begin to March through it all night long it was all night long and as they marched as they marched on that their hopes begin to get better and they began to get stronger and and and they C and they and when they cross when they crossed the that sea and they stood and they stood on the opposite bank and when that Red Sea rolled in rolled rolled in in in in around the the the armies of the Egyptian those people who had who had enslaved them for 400 years and and and you guys realize that America's only been here for 250 Years or or so something like that so when you realize that it's over almost double of how the the age of America that these Israelis had had had had had had had had been had been had been enslaved but yet when you think about that and and yet and and yet they stood on the banks and watched that Red Sea rolling around their enemies and and they realized that those Egyptians that had beat them day in and day out when they were when they when they were hungry when they were hungry they just stayed hungry they they got beaten their victory was stolen from them year after year after year but yet but yet when they stood when they stood on that opposite bank and seen those Egyptians they would never see no more when they seen that God had totally wiped them out brother random said said said that it had started an old faster fashioned Pentecostal Campground meeting he he said he said he he said he said he said brother if this is the latter ring that must have been the former rain hallelujah what was it the same Holy Ghost the same Pillar of Fire that same Redeemer walking in light moving on on on on on on he's moving on what a time he said and then those Jews that had seen their slaves Masters who had beaten them who had enslaved them were were dead when they were dead and and and and and and and and the bottom of the sea brother they got to rejoicing they got to dancing and and and had grabbed a tambourine and she began to dance up and down that beach why brother B said it's a dance of Victory why and when we as the bride of Christ Christ can stand here and see for see all the victories that God that God has has has done for us when when we can when we can look around us and see that what that devil has tried to Rob us year after year after year after of our blessings when we can stand forth and realize just who we are and all authority and all power that God that God has wiped out the Egyptians from our Lives why it be it it it it it it it can cause a shout with us it can cause a dance with us why it's a dance of Victory it brother Ram says it always takes the miraculous to to speak of of of of of of of of omnipotence omnipotence is the all powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate to vindicate the the omnipotence and the all and only the miraculous can can can can do that so so so so so so you know it always takes the miraculous to vindicate to to to vindicate that the that the omnipotent still lives and still Reigns and brother R said we must have the miraculous when omnipotent speaks miracles happen when the when when the all powerful almighty God speaks and Goes Forth forth Miracles have to happen Satan cannot cannot stand before the bride of Christ when when his word has gone forth and when we as a bride of Christ when we as that same original fruit that Christ was was when when when when when we can speak speak speak Miracles have to happen because we have omnipotence in in us why because because because we are the the the the the we are the the the the the the fully Vindicated bride of Christ we are heirs and Joint HS with with Christ nothing can ever stand before us again it says I and brother ROM said I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest Vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known oh my we are we we we have been Vindicated we have seen we have seen our Prophet Vindicated Time After Time After Time After Time When in one prayer he he can make one make make a prayer and seven truckloads of wheelchairs Cs and stretches leave leave and and so the miracle after miracle and the time after time where he stood on the prophet or or or on on the platform and said he said thus sayith the Lord and he was sat on call calling an individual out showing that he that same sign that same super sign that that that God had had had done on the backside had had done on the on the backside on the backside of the desert of the desert with Abraham and when and when Christ was standing in the flesh and and he sat there and said and and and he and he and he called out the woman at the well and and showing showing that sign and that and that Samaritan woman recognized it she caught it and recognized it why because because she was of the of of of of that seed and yet when we as the bride of Christ today we see it and it's been Vindicated thousands upon thousands of times we can stand here with all assurance and and all confidence knowing just who exactly we are we are the the we are the Bride of the unchanging God the Holy Spirit has come has come has has has come into the church again in these last days why because we we can stand here with all assurance and all confidence knowing just who exactly we are amen and it says and brother M said said now the Holy Ghost has come right back around and has confirmed with the former rign into the latter rain to prove that it it was his move that they're both falling together amen he said oh I wish that you could see that that great move of God that that started 40 years ago back Yonder when the latter rain had begun to fall the former Reign the former power that started with Jesus Christ has come into his church and proven that he is the same that he is the same Jesus Christ again showing that the omnipotence of God is now in his bride and all that Christ that all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his church amen if the musicians will come brother Ram said he said said said said brother brother BR brother Bram said in a prayer he said he said oh he said he said oh Lord truly these words are the truth we believe that the hour is so close that's so close to the coming that the world is quivering they don't know what's the matter but we know that Jesus is on his road and we have begun to congregate ourselves together by the gate the Gate of the power of God those who believe in God those who who's born of his Spirit those who who have the Holy Ghost they know they know that the Holy Ghost ghost is the spirit of God and that he is the same yesterday today and and yesterday today and forever he cannot change his nature for he he is God and when God comes into people it makes them believe for the impossible it also produces this produces the same kind of fruits that the former rain had had has H has has has that the former rain same kind of fruits that the former rain produced because it's the former rain mix with the with W with the latter rain and the world cries out who is this or what is this they don't have it they don't have it they they they don't have it in the books the books they don't believe in that kind of a coming of Christ they're still having their their they they they're still having their their ceremonies walk Walking the statues and blessing themselves and washing and sprinkling of the waters and wearning of clothes he said but the Church of the Living God is making herself ready Inside by renewing their faith daily and the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit now has come in and in this light of rain he has placed Us in here already confirmed around the world amongst the Believers that he is the same yesterday today and and and and forever he is the same Jesus that a woman touched His Garment in the former rain and he and and he turned and told her what her trouble was and and she was healed he's the same Jesus who told Peter what his name Simon was and he was going to call him Peter and his father's name and what he was and they told him Daniel before he before he before he he before before before he before he come to the meeting he told the woman of Samaria what her sins was looked out all across the audience and perceived the thoughts of their hearts and when the Great St Paul wrote the spirit of God are sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the sun of the marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart do we not have did we not have that that's that's that's that that same spirit Spirit walking amongst us again in these last days has he not Vindicated himself to us over and over and over again why he is the Mighty God he is the unchanging God he has identified himself in his characteristics to us Time After Time After Time oh my I love him don't you love him aren't you thankful for what he's done for us in the in these last days the Lord amen I can't get over how much I love the Lord and how much I love this message he it is everything to me it is My All In All we are nothing without this message without this message we'd be a bunch of denominational chickens in the barnyard scratching around from day to day just hoping we wasn't going to we wasn't going to end up in Colonel Sanders Sanders Sanders frying pot but yet we are we are an eagle and we were made to soar above all the heavenlies when when when when the when the storms come at us when when Satan tries tries TR tries to come in like a flood that Spirit of the Lord just raises up a standard and we can set our wings and just fly above it all why because we have come in contact with God we have come in contact with with with with Elohim again in these last days nobody else else else else even knows what we're talking about I was talking to one of my employees the other day about the message he looked at me like I was crazy why because because because because he's stuck in sodomy he's stuck in in in Sodom and a and and and and and gamor when we as a bride of Christ we we we you're standing here with all confidence and all assurance and we are having a relationship with Elohim God manifested In the Flesh again in these last days through the body
