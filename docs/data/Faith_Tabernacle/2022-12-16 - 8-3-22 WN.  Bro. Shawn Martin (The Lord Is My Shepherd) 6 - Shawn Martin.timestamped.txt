[1:02] the house of the Lord
[1:03] trust everyone's had a good day today

[1:09] uh we um certainly discounted an honor
[1:13] to to be here with you
[1:16] and just to Worship the Lord for he's
[1:18] certainly worthy of our praise
[1:21] and
[1:22] um you know this is only just a
[1:24] reflection of what it's going to be on
[1:26] the other side and
[1:28] amen praise the Lord if you have your
[1:31] Bibles we're going to turn to the Book
[1:32] of Psalms the 23rd chapter
[1:36] and as it's been said and we want to
[1:40] keep brother Burley in our prayers
[1:43] he is should be in surgery now and so
[1:48] that the Lord would just keep him and
[1:51] um
[1:52] helping through these times
[1:54] and
[1:56] guide the doctor's hands amen and give
[2:00] the doctor the wisdom that they need
[2:02] praise the Lord
[2:04] but we want to look at Psalms the 23rd
[2:08] chapter
[2:10] and may we just go to the Lord in prayer
[2:13] before we start reading

[2:18] truly we love you and we count it an
[2:21] honor to be here
[2:23] gathered with your people
[2:26] father of who you have redeemed you've
[2:29] called out of this dark evil age and to
[2:33] walk in your Marvelous Light
[2:35] and oh God we just humbly asked that you
[2:39] would now come Among Us and speak to us
[2:43] father help me just to get myself out of
[2:46] the way Lord and
[2:48] that you could use the gift that you
[2:50] placed Within Me
[2:52] father and I pray that you would just
[2:55] anoint people's hearts and ears
[2:57] Lord that they could hear and receive of
[3:00] you

[3:07] we want to we want to walk in the way
[3:10] that is pleasing to you
[3:12] Lord just ask that you would bless this
[3:15] church
[3:16] father the congregation I pray Lord that
[3:19] you would just be with brother Burley
[3:21] now through the surgery and
[3:23] just guide the doctor's hands father and
[3:27] Lord we just love you we thank you for
[3:29] all things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[3:34] mm-hmm
[3:36] I want to read just starting at the
[3:38] first verse again
[3:40] and I'm just going to read the first
[3:42] verse the Lord is my shepherd
[3:45] I shall not want.
[3:48] and you say that with me the Lord is my
[3:51] shepherd I shall not want
[3:54] you can have your seats this evening
[3:56] and before I get started I think the
[4:00] there was a notice that had already been
[4:03] sent out
[4:04] but uh for all of those that would like
[4:08] to gather for some fellowship
[4:10] and uh some volleyball you're more than
[4:14] welcome
[4:15] to come this Saturday
[4:18] and we're going to be meeting at the
[4:20] Gateway the Gateway Baptist Church has
[4:23] been so nice to
[4:25] to allow us to use their facilities and
[4:30] in times past and so we're going to be
[4:32] meeting at Gateway Baptist Church and I
[4:35] guess around five o'clock and we'll be
[4:38] uh try to start eating at around 5 30.
[4:42] and so um if you'd like to come love to
[4:47] have you and also a reminder
[4:50] uh that we're going to be taking up an
[4:53] offering for brother Andrew and sister
[4:55] Mariah this Sunday
[4:56] and it'll help
[5:01] them with their bills and things as we
[5:04] know that brother Andrew
[5:06] is full-time in the ministry and and
[5:10] he's been a real blessing to us as a
[5:13] church and to to people all over and so
[5:18] we want to be a blessing to them in this
[5:21] time and I think it would I just hate to
[5:26] see him get out have to go out on the
[5:28] road so soon after that baby and are
[5:31] having that baby and and so I think it
[5:35] would be nice to be able to do something
[5:37] for them to where he wouldn't have to
[5:40] feel that pressure and of course we know
[5:42] brother Andrew Don't Preach for money at
[5:45] all but at the same time he's got bills
[5:49] that needs paid and so we can help him
[5:53] in that area so just remember that also
[5:56] we're going to be only having one
[5:59] service this Sunday and that'll be at 11
[6:01] o'clock
[6:03] then we're going to be having fellowship
[6:04] at Camp Christie afterward
[6:07] um
[6:08] and and I I kind of messed up on the
[6:11] dates
[6:12] and I was doing trying to do it every
[6:16] other Sunday well Camp Christie was
[6:19] booked up June and July and so we we got
[6:24] the uh the dates for the seventh and on
[6:28] and uh so I thought well okay so I was
[6:31] looking at my calendar and so when we
[6:34] were reserving things for in June and
[6:37] July
[6:38] I thought I had it all planned out and I
[6:40] didn't and so I uh so we we've got a a
[6:46] schedule with Cam Christie for this
[6:48] Sunday
[6:50] um for fellowships so uh anyways if
[6:53] you'd like to come we'd love to have you
[6:55] at uh Fellowship also um uh sister
[6:59] Brittany said there's a sign up sheet in
[7:01] the back for those who would like to
[7:03] contribute in in meals in the meal for
[7:07] Sunday and so if you would want to come
[7:11] we'd love to have you brother Andrew
[7:13] will be ministering the Lord willing
[7:15] this Sunday and so we're looking forward
[7:20] to that as well
[7:21] uh that I want to title the subject
[7:25] we've just been speaking on the Lord is
[7:27] my shepherd
[7:28] but tonight I'd like to deal with I
[7:31] shall not want. the Lord is my shepherd
[7:34] I shall not want and uh again we are
[7:38] looking at David's relationship with the
[7:41] Lord and uh and it's it's the same
[7:44] relationship that every believer has
[7:47] with God and so uh The Lord Is Our
[7:52] Shepherd which means he's our leader
[7:54] he's he's the one that is doing the
[7:56] leading and uh uh and we as his sheep
[8:00] are followers we're following him and uh
[8:06] so we quoted the scripture Romans 8 14
[8:09] as for many as are led by the spirit of
[8:13] God they are the sons of God never in in
[8:17] the Bible does it say that we are to
[8:20] lead it doesn't and then God is to
[8:22] follow and and I think we we put that
[8:25] the world has got misconception of God
[8:28] as though he he just follows our every
[8:31] whim and and and and and whatever we ask
[8:35] him or tell him to do it's got now that
[8:36] we tell him we demand we expected of him
[8:40] and he just so happens to do it and and
[8:43] and you know
[8:45] um and and it's good to expect if you're
[8:47] expecting the right thing
[8:49] but we we find uh that the the Bible
[8:52] never puts God in the back as though uh
[8:57] he follows us but we are to follow him
[9:00] Elijah put forth the challenge to Israel
[9:03] if the Lord be God then follow him ain't
[9:07] that right David wrote and sang My Soul
[9:11] followeth hard after thee Jesus said
[9:15] unto his disciples unto Matthew follow
[9:18] me he goes to Levi follow me if he he
[9:22] goes to Peter and Andrew follow me
[9:25] everywhere it's it's follow me it's it's
[9:28] not well what are you guys doing and can
[9:30] I go with you it's it's drop what you're
[9:32] doing Drop what you you have and follow
[9:35] me and they drop their Nets and they
[9:38] left the tax office and they quit their
[9:41] occupations to follow follow the lord
[9:44] ain't that rhyme and in Matthew 10 37
[9:47] Jesus said he that taketh not his cross
[9:51] and followeth after me is not worthy of
[9:55] me ain't that right amen so to be worthy
[9:58] of Christ we have to follow him amen and
[10:02] so it's not us leading God but rather
[10:05] him leading us and that's the whole
[10:07] point is he wants to have preeminence in
[10:10] our lives ain't that right amen and and
[10:13] so there are absolutely no benefits in
[10:16] us trying to lead God if you want to
[10:18] lead God and tell him what to do you
[10:21] you'll you'll never find the benefits
[10:23] that David's talking about it's only to
[10:26] those that follow him and accept him as
[10:31] their Shepherd ain't that right amen and
[10:34] so uh John 8 and 12 Jesus says I am the
[10:38] light of the world and he that followeth
[10:40] me shall not walk in darkness but shall
[10:43] have the light of life amen so you have
[10:47] to follow him in order to to not walk in
[10:51] darkness ain't that right and so one of
[10:54] the benefits in following the Lord is I
[10:58] shall not one and and you know I I pray
[11:03] that I can bring this uh to where what I
[11:06] feel in my heart as to what this truly
[11:09] means of I shall not want and and uh we
[11:14] we've dealt with this of a few Services
[11:16] back
[11:18] but I would like to look at it just a
[11:20] little bit more and and one definition
[11:23] for the word one
[11:25] is Desiring to have or uh to lack to
[11:30] lack in other words there's a need there
[11:32] uh to be without having a need so so
[11:36] this is what I shall not want I I shall
[11:39] not have a need I I shall not be lacking
[11:42] I I shall not see and so uh uh sheep of
[11:46] course have certain needs as as well as
[11:48] anything but but we're talking about the
[11:51] shepherd and the sheep and and the
[11:54] shepherd does not lead the Sheep based
[11:56] on his own needs he doesn't care for the
[11:59] Sheep based upon his own needs but the
[12:02] shepherd cares for the Sheep he leads
[12:05] the Sheep according to the needs that
[12:07] they have ain't that right so we don't
[12:10] have a selfish Shepherd a man but this
[12:12] Shepherd cares for the Sheep he he knows
[12:15] his sheep he he wants his sheep to
[12:18] thrive he wants his sheep to be fed on
[12:21] on the right things and and so he's a
[12:24] good shepherd ain't that right amen and
[12:27] so we we find the prophet says that God
[12:30] has always been the god to meet the need
[12:33] when there is a need for his people and
[12:36] you know that see and God promised that
[12:39] he would Supply their need amen aren't
[12:42] you glad he supplies the need amen uh uh
[12:45] Philippians 4 19 says but my God shall
[12:49] supply all your need according to his
[12:52] riches in Glory by Christ Jesus ain't
[12:56] that right so the prophet would tell us
[12:58] anything that you have need of in this
[13:02] earth Journey God Will Supply it if you
[13:06] have need of it now that's the
[13:09] confidence that we can have anything
[13:10] that you have need of in this life's
[13:13] journey God Will Supply the need if you
[13:17] have need of it he promises to supply
[13:20] your needs not your wants but your needs
[13:24] ain't that right amen so we have seen
[13:26] I've seen God put food on my table amen
[13:30] when I needed it I've seen God put money
[13:32] in my hand when I needed it I seen God
[13:35] put clothes on my family when we needed
[13:38] it ain't that right amen I've seen God
[13:41] Supply the gas when we needed it amen
[13:44] I've seen God Amen turn on the electric
[13:46] when we needed it I've I've seen God do
[13:49] many many things amen uh because he's
[13:52] promised to supply our needs ain't that
[13:55] right God has supplied the needs amen
[13:59] but if we're not careful we will only
[14:02] limit our needs to materialistic things
[14:06] well I need this and I need that and I
[14:09] need you know and and and and and and
[14:12] then our needs turns into ones or our
[14:14] ones turns into needs and and and these
[14:17] things but brother Brandon would tell us
[14:19] in this layout of sin age and I think
[14:22] it's important now but he says I want to
[14:24] give a warning right here it says
[14:27] concerning the last days that because of
[14:30] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[14:34] wax cold a man in the layout of sin or
[14:38] last age self-love and love for material
[14:42] things will take the place of the true
[14:46] love of God Amen see and so this is
[14:49] where we're at and and so if we're not
[14:52] careful we will start basing or start
[14:56] Desiring or or we'll find our wanting a
[15:00] man to be materialistic amen but but I
[15:04] thought Jeremiah 21 11 amen for I know
[15:08] the thoughts that I think towards you A
[15:10] man uh saith the Lord thoughts of peace
[15:13] and not of evil to give you an expected
[15:17] in now I I believe there are needs that
[15:20] are greater than just materialistic
[15:23] things I just believe that and I'm going
[15:25] to I just kind of want to uh go into the
[15:28] needs that that maybe we would have as
[15:31] as the people of God Amen brother
[15:34] Branham said God has never had a new
[15:37] thought about anything because all his
[15:40] thoughts he always had and always will
[15:43] have and knows the end from the
[15:46] beginning because he is God thus the
[15:50] thoughts of God are Eternal and they are
[15:53] real can you say Amen now I want to just
[15:55] stop here we would never know that we
[15:57] had needs except we found the mind of
[16:01] God that we were able to get into the
[16:03] mind of God thank God for a prophet a
[16:06] man that would reveal to us the the
[16:09] Eternal thoughts of God Amen that was
[16:11] from the foundation of the world and
[16:14] these thoughts of God are Eternal and
[16:17] they are real God will never change his
[16:19] mind about anything you can't change
[16:22] God's mind about you I don't care how
[16:25] low you feel I don't care you can
[16:27] complain to him about yourself you can
[16:30] you can tell him all the negative about
[16:32] yourself and you'll never change God's
[16:35] mind of what he thought of you can you
[16:38] say Amen see because they are Eternal
[16:41] and they are real they are not simply
[16:44] like a man with the blueprint he is
[16:47] drawn up in which one day will be
[16:49] translated into substance and form now
[16:52] think of that it's not like a blueprint
[16:54] amen and you're looking at the blueprint
[16:56] and and then you're waiting for it to
[16:58] come into materialistic and and and and
[17:01] then you can identify but brother
[17:03] Branham is saying the thoughts of God
[17:05] are Eternal and they are real
[17:08] oh my to think of that you already were
[17:12] a Son of God Amen you already were amen
[17:16] uh uh uh perfect in his mind you already
[17:19] then we're real then we're just
[17:22] substance this isn't just a thought
[17:24] drawn out but these are real a reality
[17:27] ain't that right so be uh but they are
[17:31] already real and eternal and the part of
[17:34] God ain't that right but I can tell you
[17:36] this in the natural sense amen we did
[17:39] not come into this world reflecting the
[17:41] thoughts of God Amen we didn't come into
[17:43] this world uh uh as as reflecting saved
[17:47] and and Perfection and and sons of God
[17:51] Daughters of God Amen we we didn't come
[17:53] into this world we actually come into
[17:56] this world complete opposite of what God
[17:59] predestinated us to be but you know what
[18:02] that didn't mind bother God a bit
[18:04] ain't that right now you know we can
[18:07] waver sometimes and when when things are
[18:09] going good we see it as going good but
[18:12] then when things drop and the bottom
[18:13] drops out and then we can't see what we
[18:16] saw that was good we're looking at what
[18:18] is the bad you understand what I'm
[18:19] saying and it's hard for us to get out
[18:22] of that negative and to look into the
[18:24] positive again amen but see God when the
[18:27] bottom dropped out and and we were born
[18:29] in another way than what he had
[18:31] predestinated us to be God never looked
[18:34] at that and said oh my God this is a
[18:36] mess I I don't understand I don't know
[18:38] if there's any hole he always saw you as
[18:41] the Son of God he always saw it was more
[18:44] real to him amen than you were as a
[18:47] sinner
[18:49] because his thoughts are real and
[18:52] they're Eternal ain't that right you
[18:54] could have been drinking you could have
[18:55] been down staggering amen uh in a bar
[18:58] somewhere that didn't matter to God Amen
[19:01] he didn't even look at that because he
[19:04] saw you what was in his mind and that
[19:06] was more real what was in his thoughts
[19:08] were more real than you sitting there
[19:11] staggering in a bar room
[19:15] ain't that right that's what he said
[19:17] it's more real so he would stay with the
[19:20] thoughts and not with what your
[19:21] condition is
[19:23] that's why we can have hope
[19:25] can you say man we can have hope when we
[19:28] see that things are going bad and and
[19:30] our loved ones uh taking a turn for the
[19:33] worse amen we can look and say hold it
[19:35] hold it that's not what God thought of
[19:37] this to be
[19:39] the thoughts of God are eternal
[19:42] that God didn't predestinate us to be
[19:44] Sinners but we came that way God didn't
[19:47] predestinated us to be weakened Beverly
[19:49] but we came that way God didn't
[19:51] predestinated us uh uh to be subject to
[19:55] the powers of Darkness but we came that
[19:57] way ain't that right we came into this
[20:00] world having a fallen adamic nature amen
[20:03] we came into this world full of lies and
[20:07] and hypocrisy having a carnal mind which
[20:10] is enmity against God do you believe
[20:12] that amen that's why we all come into
[20:14] this world just like that that cute
[20:17] little old baby you know and and uh but
[20:19] yet born with the sinner's nature with
[20:22] the with the nature that was against God
[20:24] cannot be subject to the law of God and
[20:27] all that but yet God had called us to
[20:30] walk with him and to fellowship with him
[20:32] aren't you glad for that God called us
[20:35] so so as you begin to see what you are
[20:38] in the now a man or in in this a
[20:41] contrast as to what he's called you to
[20:44] be we can say there's a need
[20:46] ain't that right there's a need amen see
[20:49] now the prophet would tell us well uh
[20:51] Amos you know he asked the question how
[20:53] can two walk together except they be
[20:56] agreed amen here God is wanting
[20:58] fellowship and here we have the nature
[21:00] that is against God so we can actually
[21:02] say there is a need ain't that right
[21:05] amen a need we have a need of uh we
[21:09] needed a change of natures ain't that
[21:11] right well we find that God has called
[21:14] us for a greater purpose than what you
[21:16] could ever dream of you you young people
[21:19] may already have your plans already
[21:21] picked out but God's got a greater plan
[21:23] for you he's got a greater purpose for
[21:25] you amen ain't that right amen we're
[21:29] called to be Sons and Daughters of God
[21:31] you believe that we're called to reflect
[21:34] his nature his power his glory we're
[21:36] we're called to be the habitation of God
[21:39] himself we're called see we've been
[21:42] predestinated to be conformed to the
[21:45] image of Christ
[21:46] brother Brown said we've been invited to
[21:48] be molded into His Image his character
[21:52] so we can say that there is a need ain't
[21:55] that right how many believes you've come
[21:57] you you've come into that full character
[21:59] well see we we find that there's a need
[22:02] when you when you see your folds when
[22:04] you see your failure then you find out
[22:06] there's a need there there's a lacking
[22:08] there there there there is something
[22:10] amen not saying that you don't desire to
[22:12] to be further up the road amen but that
[22:15] desire amen is in You by God that you're
[22:19] following a Shepherd that will promise
[22:21] to meet the need
[22:23] amen ain't that right we know we're
[22:26] living in a a Rapture age
[22:29] Amen brother Brandon said it's going to
[22:31] take more faith than there ever was in
[22:33] any age for this have to be rapturing
[22:36] Faith to be taken up ain't that right he
[22:39] said if I want you to get built up now
[22:41] in this holy Oracles of God in the faith
[22:45] the faith of this hour
[22:48] so we can say there's a need there
[22:50] hey man I don't know about you but every
[22:52] time I look at the promises of God and I
[22:55] hear the prophet preaching I I see that
[22:57] there's a need there's a need can you
[23:00] say amen amen if if you're Desiring
[23:03] something it's because there's a need
[23:04] there ain't that right yes sir well
[23:07] maybe not but I know if there's
[23:09] something in me crying out that means
[23:11] there's a need there if you're thirsting
[23:13] for something you know there's a need
[23:14] your body needs something ain't that
[23:17] right if you're hunger and it's because
[23:18] your body is needing something ain't
[23:21] that right so if you're crying for God
[23:23] if you're hungering for God if you're
[23:25] thirstian after the things of God that
[23:28] shows there's a need there and he
[23:30] promised to meet it
[23:33] we're living in the in the astronaut age
[23:37] amen and as man needed something
[23:40] to lift him up
[23:42] a man from this Earthbound Rim into the
[23:45] orbit
[23:46] amen's Soul are we because the prophet
[23:49] said we are in the astronaut age
[23:53] you ain't gonna you ain't gonna get up
[23:54] there you ain't you ain't the pilot that
[23:57] flies to 747 boiled jet amen that's not
[24:01] an astronaut he can fly but that don't
[24:04] make him an astronaut amen because that
[24:07] don't take him into orbit ain't that
[24:09] right you can drive your car but that
[24:11] don't mean you're an astronaut see we
[24:12] needed something to take us into orbit
[24:15] into outer space and the prophet
[24:17] declaring that we as Believers are
[24:20] living in an astronaut age lets us know
[24:23] there's a need that is there a man that
[24:26] will lifts us up we need something a
[24:29] power a something Amen to lift us up
[24:32] into the heavenlies God doesn't want you
[24:34] to be Earthbound anymore amen horse and
[24:37] buggy Days Are Over Pentecostal Days Are
[24:39] Over Baptist Days Are Over
[24:41] denominational Days Are Over can you say
[24:44] Amen all the man-made Doctrine is over
[24:46] it ain't enough to lift you up into the
[24:50] heavenlies
[24:51] there's a need
[24:59] Joel 2 23.
[25:02] says and I will restore to you the years
[25:05] that the locusts hath eaten
[25:07] the canker worm the caterpillar and the
[25:10] Palmer worm my great Army which I sin
[25:13] among you
[25:14] I will restore
[25:16] so God is saying there's a need
[25:19] ain't that right
[25:21] and when was this restoration going to
[25:23] take place
[25:24] today
[25:26] he didn't wait for Luther he didn't wait
[25:28] oh he started the restoration
[25:32] but we find out that they they would go
[25:34] back come out a little bit go back come
[25:37] out a little bit go back come back a
[25:39] little bit and go back ain't that right
[25:41] go back into dominations go back with
[25:43] the the same old ruts and and all of
[25:46] these things amen but we find that even
[25:49] God is saying the church needs a
[25:52] restoration
[25:53] we didn't know when that was going to
[25:55] happen but we found out by the message
[25:57] of the hour this is the age of
[26:00] restoration this is the time that the
[26:02] church is going to be restored can you
[26:04] say Amen the darkmas of man decrees of
[26:07] man the the the the traditions and ideas
[26:10] of man they killed the tree amen they
[26:13] sat the life out of it they stripped it
[26:15] bare amen until it was nothing but a
[26:18] stump amen but God would say I will
[26:21] restore now we didn't know there was a
[26:23] need we thought all church was is just
[26:26] being a member of a church being a good
[26:29] citizen doing our do's and don'ts and
[26:31] and all of these things that we found
[26:33] out there was a need in the church now
[26:36] we knew there was something crying out
[26:38] for more of God we knew there was
[26:41] something in our hearts but we didn't
[26:43] know where it was we were lost we didn't
[26:45] know how to get back but God promised he
[26:48] would be our Shepherd to take us back
[26:51] and to restore it all back to us hey
[26:57] amen that's why you don't need to listen
[26:59] to The Very things that stripped a tree
[27:02] in the first place
[27:06] why does people seek Revelation outside
[27:08] this message
[27:09] anything else would strip the tree
[27:14] ain't that right
[27:16] amen so the church
[27:18] the need of the hours for the church to
[27:20] be restored
[27:22] I hope it's all right and I know these
[27:24] ministers could do a far better job
[27:27] but but I'm just skimming over a lot of
[27:29] this
[27:30] but brother Brown said we got 900 and
[27:32] something different organizations of
[27:33] Christianity and each one condemning the
[27:36] other
[27:37] and saying this is right and they're
[27:39] wrong this is right and that's wrong and
[27:41] so forth and the poor people are so
[27:43] confused they don't know what is right
[27:46] and wrong
[27:47] so now he asked the question what do we
[27:49] need we need to get back on the course
[27:53] ain't that right get back to the Charter
[27:56] what do we need we need a genuine true
[27:59] scriptural sign of the truth a vending
[28:02] Vindicated gospel truth is what the
[28:06] church needs for this end time way amen
[28:09] I'll just read some more in other places
[28:11] he said we need a rising of a true
[28:13] Prophet to bring us back to the word
[28:16] every time the people are gathered
[28:18] together at the end of the road which
[28:20] we're at the end of the road we're at a
[28:23] junction ain't that right amen see God
[28:26] sends a true prophet and the devil sends
[28:28] a false prophet we need a prophet
[28:33] that's sad that the church don't know
[28:35] they need a prophet America didn't
[28:38] realize they needed a profit it would
[28:40] have stopped a lot of this confusion if
[28:42] they would have followed the voice of a
[28:44] prophet
[28:47] ain't that right
[28:48] Dogma depending upon the social
[28:51] succession with men and with their
[28:54] man-made Creed and leaving the word of
[28:55] God what we need is a prophet today to
[28:59] blast that word in there
[29:03] the need
[29:04] another place I think the church the
[29:07] organization and denominations they've
[29:09] been on the field for a long time
[29:11] and they're beginning getting latched
[29:14] and the work of the Lord is being left
[29:16] undone
[29:17] the word of truth because the church in
[29:19] itself has become
[29:21] stemsided and what we need today is the
[29:25] voice of God to speak among us to bring
[29:28] us back
[29:29] ain't that right
[29:31] and notice another place God has
[29:33] promised to meet the need of the hour
[29:35] he always does that what and we need the
[29:38] voice of God today how many believe that
[29:41] we need the voice of God today to meet
[29:44] the need of the hour to meet the time
[29:47] that we're living in and after he is
[29:50] promised that we can rest assure that he
[29:53] will keep his promise that's the
[29:55] confidence that the believer has in his
[29:57] maker that God promised to meet the need
[30:00] aren't you glad for that God promise now
[30:03] you and I both know we're not looking
[30:05] for a prophet God has already provided
[30:08] the prophet we're not looking for a
[30:10] voice on the earth we've already got the
[30:12] voice of God that is the promised to
[30:14] meet the need for the hour
[30:17] can you say amen amen see and all I can
[30:21] say to this amen we can mention need
[30:24] after need after need that the church
[30:26] has and and and and has had for a long
[30:30] long long long time amen Through the
[30:32] Ages and all of these things but one
[30:35] thing we do know that if we follow the
[30:38] shepherd we shall not want
[30:42] can you say amen I don't believe this
[30:45] bride is going to go in a Rapture amen
[30:47] still lacking
[30:49] are you with me now amen you say well
[30:52] but look at me I don't care about what
[30:54] you are thinking I'm caring about the
[30:56] need can you say amen God knows what you
[31:00] have need of
[31:02] [Music]
[31:04] one thing about it the life that is in
[31:06] you is calling out for it
[31:09] ain't that right it's calling out
[31:12] there's a need it's calling out
[31:14] calling out
[31:17] amen is what makes you different from
[31:18] the world
[31:20] something calling out
[31:22] but he's here to meet the need
[31:27] so we say that we have that God has sent
[31:30] to us a prophet of Malachi for
[31:33] the message of the hour is the voice of
[31:35] God
[31:36] and it's the voice of Our Shepherd
[31:39] [Music]
[31:40] right
[31:41] I think we're old
[31:43] acceptable to that
[31:45] if not you need to pray that God will
[31:48] open your eyes for this message
[31:50] it is the voice of God
[31:54] it is the voice of God you don't need to
[31:56] despair just believe the voice
[31:59] ain't that right
[32:01] it's the voice of Our Shepherd
[32:03] now brother Brown said what did he say
[32:05] in Malachi 4.
[32:06] that he would restore
[32:09] Malachi 4 was to restore
[32:12] restored back the original Pentecostal
[32:14] Faith back to the people with the same
[32:16] Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal
[32:19] sign the same Pentecostal evidence the
[32:23] same God the same power the same
[32:25] teaching everything exactly with the
[32:28] Vindication of the same Pillar of Fire
[32:29] that struck Paul down on the road down
[32:32] to Damascus among us today doing the
[32:34] same things that he did that day see
[32:37] it's a uniting ain't that right
[32:40] that's what we needed we needed to unite
[32:42] with the Lord
[32:44] bride and bridegroom to unite ain't that
[32:47] right that was a need
[32:49] that's what it was needing and God
[32:51] promised to meet the need
[32:53] he said we see the Nations uniting we
[32:55] see the world uniting we see the church
[32:57] uniting and notice we see the bride
[33:00] uniting uniting with the word why the
[33:04] word is God and as the word as the
[33:07] bridegroom being the word and the bride
[33:09] being the hero of the word they come
[33:11] together in a union
[33:13] they unite like a wedding they're
[33:15] they're getting ready for a wedding they
[33:18] become one the word becomes you and you
[33:21] become the word
[33:23] ain't that right
[33:24] Jesus said at that day you know what oh
[33:27] the father is I am and all I am you are
[33:30] and all you are I am and in that day
[33:33] you'll know that I'm in the Father the
[33:35] father and me I and you and you and me
[33:37] at that day what day this day and we
[33:41] find out the great hidden mysteries of
[33:43] God being revealed
[33:46] in this day
[33:48] Hallelujah
[33:52] now notice he says we notice that God
[33:55] began
[33:55] to make him a bride for Christ and the
[33:59] bride must be identified with him and in
[34:02] him because it is part of him
[34:06] and now the brightest part of him she is
[34:08] part of him the word for that date the
[34:10] bride becomes part of that word for it's
[34:14] Christ you have to be in Christ in
[34:17] Christ we have to be of Christ in Christ
[34:20] part of Christ
[34:22] and Christ is the word
[34:24] so he ain't Dogma he's not Creeds he's
[34:27] not made by of ideology that's why we
[34:30] had to have a prophet for the word of
[34:33] God to come to
[34:35] you ain't ain't that right
[34:37] see because we needed to be part of him
[34:39] we needed something to magnetize too we
[34:42] were trying to magnetize to a church
[34:45] to a denomination to a belief a Doctrine
[34:48] a Creed
[34:50] that wasn't Christ
[34:52] ain't that right so there was a need
[34:56] now he says what is a woman when she
[34:59] takes a man or a man takes a woman that
[35:01] woman has to be a part of him they no
[35:03] longer are two they're one and when God
[35:06] and Christ become one they were one
[35:08] because God was the word and the Word
[35:11] was made flesh the Flesh and the word
[35:13] became one and when the church becomes
[35:16] Christ's bride she and the gospels are
[35:20] the same
[35:24] amen
[35:26] she and the gospels are the same
[35:29] the same power the same life the same
[35:31] Supernatural works is in her
[35:36] I shall not want you see God's been
[35:39] supplying the need all alone
[35:41] he's been restoring this bride Amen in
[35:45] this last day and the world does not
[35:47] knows nothing about it and they want to
[35:49] take a little bit from the message and
[35:51] they want to say this is inspired this
[35:53] isn't inspired they want to make it look
[35:55] like it was all psychology but what we
[35:57] find is God himself meeting the need for
[36:01] this hour
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] Lord amen
[36:07] so he says how can you say them the days
[36:09] of Miracles are passed how can you say
[36:11] then that he's not the same yesterday
[36:13] today and forever how can you say that
[36:16] those things uh is for an apostle or
[36:18] disciple or somebody in another day when
[36:21] you are to be part of him
[36:23] ain't that right
[36:25] see we're realizing the need that we
[36:27] have as Sheep amen say we need to be
[36:30] like him we need to be a part of him
[36:31] that's why we cling to this word with
[36:33] all that's within us
[36:35] when he said heavens and earth will pass
[36:37] away but my word shall never pass see or
[36:40] never fail how about Revelations 22 when
[36:42] he got through writing the book he said
[36:44] I testify that if any man shall add one
[36:46] word or take one word out of it his part
[36:48] will be taken from The Book of Life how
[36:50] are we going to come to heaven then to
[36:52] say well I believe this but I don't
[36:54] believe that you've got to be the full
[36:56] word everybody say I've got to be the
[36:57] full word that's the need for this day
[37:00] is you've got to be the full word don't
[37:02] don't don't just play around with it
[37:04] amen don't just become punctive become
[37:06] complacent with it and treat it like
[37:08] just any old book any old message any
[37:10] old amen uh uh preacher amen you've got
[37:14] to become the full word
[37:16] can you say Amen
[37:19] that's right see and he says see for you
[37:22] are part of him that's how God is going
[37:24] to try to me is trying to make his
[37:26] church today not by a Creed oh yeah
[37:29] they're trying to force us into that
[37:30] folks you can see it coming the
[37:33] handwriting is on the wall it won't be
[37:35] too long until we're going to be a World
[37:37] Church and every church is going to have
[37:39] to fall right into that or stand the
[37:40] circumstances well are you ready to
[37:43] stand that you better not do it just
[37:44] because you think it's the right thing
[37:46] you better have Christ in you because
[37:49] that word is eternal and that word is
[37:52] what will raise you up again
[37:55] you see the need
[37:56] we need the word because it is eternal
[38:00] and it'll raise us up again
[38:03] you become part of that word you're
[38:04] identified with that word
[38:06] amen see so if we're following the
[38:09] shepherd we shall not want
[38:11] we shall not lack
[38:14] ain't that right
[38:16] now I'm going to get into this just for
[38:18] a few moments today so many are left
[38:21] wanting
[38:23] but it's not God's fault
[38:25] if you'll take the time to look around
[38:27] what God has done for us in this message
[38:31] everything that you have need of is in
[38:33] the message
[38:35] God has done his part to supply the need
[38:44] can you say Amen
[38:46] if you're laodicea look warm it's not
[38:48] God's fault
[38:50] you'll never put it on God and say well
[38:52] God I just didn't have what it takes God
[38:55] promised to meet the need and he has met
[38:57] the need
[38:59] it's here it's it's everything that you
[39:02] young people need to overcome it's here
[39:05] everything that we need to overcome this
[39:08] laodicea lukewarm age it's here
[39:13] but yet people are still found wanting
[39:18] but why is it that they still want
[39:22] there's another word for want and that
[39:24] is the word lust
[39:27] lust
[39:29] Desiring
[39:31] craving to covet
[39:34] lusts makes people uncontrollable
[39:39] and if you'll notice that's not sheep
[39:41] for the voice of the shepherd controls
[39:44] the Sheep
[39:45] the voice of the shepherd
[39:48] when the Sheep is being tempted for
[39:50] something the shepherd calls out and the
[39:53] Sheep come back in line
[39:55] because they know only one and that's
[39:57] the voice of the shepherd they trust the
[40:00] shepherd they they've got confidence in
[40:02] that Shepherd and the shepherd is is the
[40:04] very thing is all they depend upon
[40:07] but the word lust this lust makes people
[40:10] uncontrollable the Bible prophesied that
[40:13] people at this last day would be
[40:15] incontinent and this word incontinent is
[40:18] powerless without self-control they
[40:21] become self-indulgent
[40:24] remember lovers of their own selves
[40:27] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[40:30] God
[40:31] they they're craving they're Desiring
[40:33] they're wanting
[40:35] but their one is Twisted it's it's a
[40:38] perverted want
[40:40] ain't that right
[40:41] you know look look at the the natural we
[40:45] we talked about it before but you can be
[40:46] thirsty just dying of thirst
[40:49] have you ever just drunk a Coke Dr
[40:52] Pepper something real sugar
[40:56] after you drink that whole bottle
[40:59] you're still where you're at you're
[41:01] thirsty
[41:03] there's nothing to quench The Thirst
[41:07] and that's that's where that lust comes
[41:10] it's it's unsatisfiable
[41:14] are you with me
[41:16] young people you know boys say if I ever
[41:18] get married it'll stop everything
[41:21] they get married and they got the woman
[41:22] that they have their dreams so they say
[41:24] and it still doesn't stop it
[41:27] they're still after something
[41:29] still looking still wanting still
[41:31] craving
[41:33] we got divorces all over the place
[41:35] men marrying one woman then another
[41:37] woman another woman and same thing with
[41:39] the woman amen what is it it's a lust
[41:43] that can never be quenched
[41:47] lust for power
[41:49] I could just become superintendent I'd
[41:52] be great and and that ain't satisfactory
[41:54] you want to be something else
[41:56] you become the president and you still
[41:58] ain't satisfied
[42:00] you want to be the governor of the world
[42:05] it's it's a lust it's a craving it's a
[42:09] desire
[42:10] can you say Amen
[42:11] we have our automobiles instead of the
[42:14] horse and buggy but we still want
[42:18] we have our nice house with plenty of
[42:20] rooms and air conditioning instead of
[42:22] having to live in the old Hut with dirt
[42:24] floors but we still want
[42:27] we can send emails and texts to one
[42:29] another instead of having to send smoke
[42:31] signals a man for every little word that
[42:34] we want to say and we steal once
[42:38] hello
[42:41] got the Worcester and drier and instead
[42:43] of having to to hang out the clothes and
[42:45] and use the worst bin and scrubbing on
[42:48] and we still watch
[42:52] nothing has been able to satisfy the
[42:54] lust with him
[42:58] I want to ask you is technology that we
[43:00] have today is a satisfying the world
[43:02] absolutely not we've gone from our flip
[43:05] phones to our iPhones and we still want
[43:07] a better one
[43:08] we still want
[43:13] yeah hello
[43:14] the Bible says ever coming to the uh uh
[43:16] what what is that ever learning but
[43:18] never coming to the knowledge of Truth
[43:21] it's a lust that that just has no end a
[43:25] desire a craving
[43:27] is education satisfying the world
[43:30] absolutely not
[43:33] is the progress of science satisfying
[43:35] the world is Hollywood satisfying the
[43:38] world is all the movies is the
[43:40] television that you so wanted is it
[43:42] really satisfying yeah
[43:46] are the peace talks of this world
[43:49] satisfying the world
[43:52] absolutely not
[43:54] we get our president in the one that we
[43:56] want and it's still not satisfactory
[44:00] we think everybody should be just like
[44:02] us if everybody was like us we still
[44:04] wouldn't be satisfied
[44:07] can you say Amen
[44:09] so there's a want that can never be
[44:12] satisfied because it stems from our own
[44:16] lusts
[44:18] but the one that David speaks of stems
[44:22] of a need
[44:25] hello
[44:27] not less I need
[44:29] and God promised he would Supply the
[44:32] need
[44:34] now notice hope that's all right
[44:37] we read this last Wednesday thinking of
[44:39] good to read it again
[44:41] God gives the control tower to you to
[44:43] give you the things that you need
[44:46] the control tower in you is what directs
[44:48] you
[44:49] tells you what you have need of
[44:51] spiritually speaking there is a control
[44:52] Tire in the body that tells you the need
[44:55] that's needed in your body and it's
[44:57] brought to you by thirst
[44:59] also there is a control tower in your
[45:01] soul that tells you the spiritual things
[45:04] that you have need of something in your
[45:05] spirit and you buy this can tell what
[45:08] kind of a life is controlling you by
[45:10] whatever desire you have tells you what
[45:12] kind of life is controlling you and when
[45:14] you can see that what your desires are
[45:16] then you can tell by that but what kind
[45:19] of something that's in you that's
[45:20] creating this desire that you have see
[45:24] there is a certain thing that you thirst
[45:25] for and it can tell you in your soul
[45:27] what this desire is by the nature of The
[45:30] Thirst that you have he said I hope you
[45:32] can understand that there is a control
[45:33] Tire of the Soul one and one for the
[45:36] body and each Tower is warning caller
[45:39] for the needs of the other each one
[45:42] calls to the uh to the Need For What the
[45:45] caller is calling for and it sends out a
[45:47] wave of warning for instance the flesh
[45:50] thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in
[45:52] the body and the spirit desires the
[45:54] things that's in the soul and desire see
[45:57] and many times these War against one
[46:00] another and we find there what's a great
[46:02] trouble today that too many people tried
[46:05] to live between those two desires
[46:09] for one of them desires the things of
[46:12] the earth and the other desires the
[46:13] things of Heaven
[46:15] ain't that right now let's look at the
[46:17] Bible First Peter 2 and 11 it says Dear
[46:20] beloved I beseech you as strangers and
[46:22] pilgrims abstain everybody say abstain
[46:25] now do you all know what abstain means
[46:27] get away from
[46:30] shun shun it
[46:32] flee it don't touch the beer bottle
[46:36] get away from it
[46:37] get away from its company
[46:40] abstain
[46:41] can you say amen that's right see
[46:44] abstain from fleshly lusts desires
[46:49] cravings
[46:51] which war against the soul
[46:54] can you say man first Peter 4 and 1 for
[46:57] as much then as Christ has suffered for
[46:59] us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise
[47:02] with the same mind for he that has
[47:04] suffered In the Flesh has ceased from
[47:06] sin that he should no longer live the
[47:09] rest of his time in the flesh to the
[47:12] lust of men but to the will of God
[47:16] so we're we're understanding I hope
[47:19] you're understanding more of what David
[47:21] is saying I shall not want he's not
[47:24] living by his lusts
[47:26] them lest ain't driving him to where
[47:29] he's uncontrollable
[47:31] can you say amen I tell you what if
[47:34] you're going by the lust that's within
[47:36] you you'll never find God to be an
[47:38] appeasing you'll never find Christianity
[47:41] to be appeasing you'll never find this
[47:44] message to be the real need for you can
[47:46] you say Amen because God is not your
[47:49] Aaron boy God is not here to satisfy the
[47:52] needs or the the the lust the Cravings
[47:54] the desires of the flesh he's after that
[47:57] soul
[48:01] now the Bible prophesied of this day
[48:03] saying that people would be led of their
[48:05] own lust
[48:06] and yet they are religious people
[48:09] Paul speaks of Israel saying they were
[48:11] all under the cloud they all passed
[48:14] through the Red Sea they were all
[48:15] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[48:18] the sea they all ate of the same
[48:21] spiritual meat they all drank of the
[48:24] same spiritual drink for they drank of
[48:26] that spiritual rock that followed them
[48:28] and that was Christ ain't that right so
[48:31] they were religious they they went to
[48:32] the blood they went through baptism they
[48:35] they tasted of the good things of God
[48:37] but notice what Paul says but they
[48:40] lusted after evil things
[48:44] therefore the works of God could never
[48:46] satisfied them the miracles of god could
[48:49] never satisfy them the promises of God
[48:52] the Vindication of God though it be in
[48:55] their midst the pillar fire the cloud
[48:58] that led them could never satisfy them
[49:01] for they lust it
[49:03] after evil things
[49:06] and notice the prophet Paul would tell
[49:08] us some of them were idolaters
[49:13] and then he says don't be idolaters as
[49:15] them
[49:16] now brother Brown would say and I'm just
[49:18] going to put this in but he says you say
[49:20] well I wouldn't worship an idol he said
[49:22] that doesn't altogether mean you worship
[49:23] an idol you just have to be idle doing
[49:26] nothing
[49:27] go to church
[49:28] yeah that's all right go back home do
[49:30] nothing about it
[49:31] brother a real born again man or woman
[49:33] can't stand still there's something in
[49:35] them they've got to testify they got to
[49:37] do something they're bound to do
[49:38] something they can't hold their peace
[49:40] that's what it means by don't be idols
[49:43] idolaters can you say man amen so does
[49:46] it always mean worshiping an image amen
[49:49] but it's coming to church and listen to
[49:51] the word of God and they never do
[49:52] nothing about it
[49:54] always keep keep our mouth shut and
[49:56] don't tell somebody about the goodness
[49:58] of God and what God is doing but all
[50:00] we'll listen to every negative thing
[50:01] that that Satan will bring to us
[50:06] can you say Amen see look the Bible also
[50:09] Paul goes on they were idolats some of
[50:11] them were idolaters some of them
[50:13] committed fornication and 23 000 of them
[50:16] died in one day some of them tempted
[50:19] Christ and were destroyed of serpents
[50:21] some of them murmured and were destroyed
[50:23] of the Destroyer ain't that right see
[50:26] God's Prophet a messenger Moses his
[50:29] Prophet Shepherd was trying to lead this
[50:32] the people into the promised land trying
[50:35] to take them over but instead of being
[50:38] able to do that he had no control over
[50:40] the influence of God could not control
[50:44] them
[50:45] because they lost it
[50:49] they lost it after evil things
[50:51] can you say man
[50:53] now see that word lusted
[50:56] means to long for to set the heart upon
[51:00] so here the prophet is telling here's a
[51:02] little here's a lamb here's a land but
[51:04] every time dates went to rise up he they
[51:06] could influence him them people because
[51:08] they lusted after evil things their
[51:11] heart was set upon the evil can you say
[51:14] amen that's right sin and they were LED
[51:17] amen well the the it also lusted means
[51:20] to turn upon a thing to have a desire
[51:23] for long for to desire to lust after
[51:26] covet of those who seek things forbidden
[51:29] see so they were led by their own lusts
[51:35] is this okay they were led by their own
[51:39] lust so no wonder again they were so
[51:41] easily influenced this one could rise up
[51:44] and they'd go after it amen even though
[51:46] God would swallow a lot of them up amen
[51:49] yet another would rise up and they'd go
[51:51] after that is because they lasted after
[51:55] evil things and they were led by their
[51:57] own lust the word of God could not have
[52:00] influence over their lives
[52:08] and then Paul tells us that they were
[52:10] overthrown in the wilderness because God
[52:13] was displeased with them
[52:15] but we're back to the same thing today
[52:18] I've got just a few more minutes
[52:21] so you just bear with me
[52:23] Jude 17.
[52:25] through 19 but beloved remember ye The
[52:27] Words which were spoken before of the
[52:30] Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:32] how that they told you that there should
[52:34] be mockers in the last time who should
[52:36] walk after their own ungodly lust
[52:39] these be they who separate themselves
[52:41] sensual not having the spirit
[52:43] second Peter 3 1 this Second Epistle
[52:46] beloved I now write unto you in both
[52:49] which I steer up your pure Minds by way
[52:51] of remembrance that you may be mindful
[52:54] of The Words which were spoken before by
[52:57] the holy prophets and of the Commandment
[52:59] of us the Apostles of the Lord and
[53:02] Savior knowing this verse that there
[53:04] shall come there shall come everybody
[53:06] say there shall come in the last day
[53:10] scoffers walking after their own lusts
[53:13] ain't that right so that's a promise for
[53:16] this day amen second Timothy 4 3 for the
[53:19] time will come when they will not endure
[53:22] sound Doctrine but after their own lust
[53:25] shall Heap to themselves teachers having
[53:28] itching ears and they shall turn away
[53:30] their ears from the truth and shall be
[53:32] turned unto fables Jude 14 and Enoch
[53:36] also the seventh from Adam prophesied of
[53:38] these saying behold the Lord cometh with
[53:41] ten thousands of his Saints to ask you
[53:43] to execute judgment upon all and to
[53:47] convince all that are ungodly among them
[53:49] of all their ungodly Deeds which they
[53:52] have ungodly committed and all of their
[53:55] hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have
[53:58] spoken against him these are murmurers
[54:01] complainers walking after their own lust
[54:04] and their mouths speak great swelling
[54:07] words having men's persons in admiration
[54:10] because of advantage in other words if
[54:15] if brother Bill if you couldn't give me
[54:17] some Advantage some some Prestige I
[54:19] would put you off and I'd cling to
[54:21] brother Amos amen he's got Prestige he's
[54:24] got a position he can benefit me he can
[54:26] put me up somewhere you understand what
[54:28] I'm saying instead of making every man
[54:30] equal amen they would look at this and
[54:32] having uh uh men's persons in admiration
[54:35] because of advantage
[54:40] we don't look at any preacher in this
[54:42] message as high or low or whatever
[54:46] you understand what I'm saying
[54:48] amen something's got great gifts
[54:51] some are just for the local church some
[54:53] are for convention some are for you know
[54:56] whatever
[54:57] but they're all in the body
[54:59] benefit for the body ain't that right
[55:02] Romans 1 21 because that when they knew
[55:05] God they glorified him not as God
[55:08] neither were thankful but became vain in
[55:10] their imaginations and their foolish
[55:12] heart was darkened professing themselves
[55:15] to be wise they became fools and changed
[55:19] the glory of the uncorruptable god into
[55:22] an image made like two corruptable man
[55:24] to birds four-footed beasts and creeping
[55:27] things wherefore listen wherefore God
[55:30] also gave them up to uncleanliness
[55:32] through the lusts of Their Own Heart
[55:37] there came a time where God says okay
[55:39] that's what you want have at it
[55:43] I'll Supply it
[55:46] and you say Amen they didn't want God
[55:49] they didn't want the truth of God they
[55:50] didn't have the love for the truth so
[55:52] God sent them over to strong delusions
[55:54] that they believed believed the lion be
[55:56] damned
[55:57] and yet they're religious
[56:00] our church is it's not not message
[56:02] churches by God's grace but church is
[56:04] all around except in homosexuals behind
[56:06] the pulpit
[56:09] why God gave it in the over to the lusts
[56:12] and it shows that denominations were not
[56:14] of God in the beginning
[56:17] it was started by the lust of men
[56:21] can you say amen and you found out they
[56:24] started one denomination and couldn't be
[56:26] satisfied with that so they'd start
[56:28] another one can't be satisfied with that
[56:30] they'll start another one
[56:34] hello
[56:35] you could go on and on and on and see
[56:38] amen but we find this this kind of want
[56:42] is ungodly it's evil and will never be
[56:45] satisfied
[56:46] the church world is wanting because of
[56:49] their lust they Lust For popularity they
[56:51] lust for Prestige they lust for
[56:53] knowledge they Lust For more members
[56:55] they lust to be the biggest church they
[56:58] lust for fortune and fame they Lust For
[57:00] recognition they lust and God can never
[57:04] satisfy that kind of wanting
[57:09] ain't that right
[57:12] all right I'm going to close
[57:15] I want you to look at this Mark 10 17.
[57:19] speaking of Jesus and when he was gone
[57:21] forth into the way there came one
[57:23] running and kneeled to him and asked him
[57:25] good master
[57:29] what shall I do
[57:30] that I may inherit internal eternal life
[57:33] now we know this is the Rich Young Ruler
[57:36] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[57:38] me good
[57:39] there is none good but one and that is
[57:41] God
[57:43] thou knowest the Commandments now I want
[57:45] you to notice this man's condition this
[57:47] boy's condition
[57:48] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[57:50] commit adultery do not steal do not kill
[57:52] do not bear false Witnesses defraud not
[57:54] honor thy father and mother and he
[57:57] answered and said unto him master all
[58:00] these things I've done
[58:03] or observed since a youth
[58:07] ain't that right
[58:09] then notice
[58:11] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[58:14] said unto him one thing thou lackest
[58:19] yes I want you to understand this
[58:22] because he he was obeying the law
[58:26] he was living strict coherent to it
[58:30] he wasn't one of these rebel Rebels
[58:33] he was actually following the line doing
[58:36] toeing the line with everything that was
[58:39] required in that law and yet Jesus would
[58:42] tell him you're lacking
[58:46] and he knew he was lacking
[58:49] went to church since he was a boy
[58:51] learned all the do's and don'ts learned
[58:53] that the rules
[58:56] and did them
[59:00] and yet he lacked
[59:04] go thy way so whatsoever thou Hast give
[59:07] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[59:10] in heaven and come take up the cross
[59:14] and what
[59:16] follow me
[59:19] now this tells us a lot
[59:22] there's a lot of people going to church
[59:25] there's a lot of people that are
[59:26] religious
[59:28] there's a lot of religious people that
[59:30] are more strict than what we would be
[59:33] and they're lacking
[59:36] because they're not following
[59:38] him
[59:41] you say oh they say Jesus Jesus
[59:44] but notice
[59:47] he knew he had to have eternal life and
[59:50] where did he come to
[59:51] the word of the hour
[59:55] you believe it
[59:57] now notice what the prophet said
[59:58] remember Jesus said follow me follow me
[1:00:01] get rid of what you got and follow me
[1:00:06] and that's the only way to have eternal
[1:00:08] life
[1:00:09] by following
[1:00:11] not eternal life by doing
[1:00:14] you got to do things too
[1:00:16] right
[1:00:18] but all you're doing won't get you
[1:00:20] anywhere if you ain't following him
[1:00:25] that's the only way to have eternal life
[1:00:27] that's the only remedy he'd give this
[1:00:29] man was the only remedy he give this
[1:00:31] businessman is the only remedy he gives
[1:00:33] anybody his choice he makes his decision
[1:00:36] it's perfect every time and we must
[1:00:39] follow him it's the only way to have
[1:00:41] eternal life so the leadership of God is
[1:00:45] follow the Vindicated word of the hour
[1:00:48] and Pie of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:52] yeah amen
[1:00:55] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:00:57] well how do you know he's your Shepherd
[1:00:59] because I'm following the Vindicated
[1:01:01] word of the hour
[1:01:04] and it's applying my need
[1:01:07] I shall not want. I'm finding that my
[1:01:11] lacking
[1:01:12] my need is being met
[1:01:14] are you with me
[1:01:17] see Jesus was there to satisfy the word
[1:01:19] of the hour the Vindicated word was
[1:01:22] there to satisfy that which he lacked
[1:01:25] all right
[1:01:27] and he failed to do it
[1:01:29] and you say Amen
[1:01:31] brother Brown said you know there is in
[1:01:34] the country today so many dissatisfied
[1:01:36] people
[1:01:38] and it's amazing when you get around and
[1:01:40] find out so much dissatisfaction
[1:01:43] people hardly know what they want to do
[1:01:46] they come down the road at about 70 80
[1:01:48] miles an hour in a 30-mile Zone Slide
[1:01:52] the brakes and turn around the corner
[1:01:53] and start up with such speed till they
[1:01:56] burn their tires half off to go to a
[1:01:58] city block to sit and talk a while
[1:02:01] seemed like people just don't know what
[1:02:03] they want to do or what they do want
[1:02:05] some of them get so disturbed until they
[1:02:08] go down into the drugstore go down to
[1:02:10] the drugstore and purchase for
[1:02:11] themselves a bottle of arsenic or
[1:02:13] sulfuric acid or something and commit
[1:02:15] suicide they find they they find them
[1:02:18] laying dead some will turn their gas
[1:02:20] jets on in the room or set in their
[1:02:22] automobiles with the pipe for the carbon
[1:02:25] monoxide gas trying to get away from
[1:02:27] Life some of them will climb up to the
[1:02:29] bridge and write a little note and stick
[1:02:32] it on their coat and lay it down and
[1:02:33] plunge themselves to death in the river
[1:02:35] jumping off mountains High Towers some
[1:02:38] will take a pistol put it to their head
[1:02:40] and blow their brains out see they're
[1:02:42] just dissatisfied
[1:02:44] that lust ain't being quenched
[1:02:48] the hospitals are full of dissatisfied
[1:02:50] people the insane institutions are
[1:02:53] overrun dissatisfied they don't know
[1:02:56] what they do want and there seemed to be
[1:02:58] something that they're reaching after
[1:02:59] but they just never come to it
[1:03:05] can you say Amen
[1:03:07] you love the Lord
[1:03:10] I I'm going to close now but Psalms 90
[1:03:14] and 14 says oh satisfy us
[1:03:18] all satisfy us with thy mercy early with
[1:03:22] thy mercy
[1:03:23] that we may rejoice
[1:03:25] and be glad all our days
[1:03:29] you know what that word satisfy means
[1:03:32] to meet the need of
[1:03:35] the need is met
[1:03:37] and I'm satisfied
[1:03:39] I shall not want
[1:03:41] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:03:43] and I'm satisfied
[1:03:45] can you say Amen
[1:03:47] now look what the the prophet says
[1:03:49] because there's a scripture that I wish
[1:03:51] I could really get to you because when I
[1:03:53] read it I just about shouted
[1:03:55] but I listen to what brother branham's
[1:03:58] saying she held two traditions now you
[1:04:01] know what he's talking about is the
[1:04:03] church
[1:04:04] throughout the ages
[1:04:06] she held to traditions and substitute
[1:04:08] she held to the substitute blood instead
[1:04:11] of the real blood to instead of the real
[1:04:14] blood Jesus the word said when it was
[1:04:17] manifested to her because she held to
[1:04:19] these Traditions Jesus the manifested
[1:04:22] word said to the bride the Hebrew bride
[1:04:25] because you hold to your Traditions you
[1:04:28] make the word of God without any effect
[1:04:30] to you see it can't be effective now
[1:04:33] that's what's the reason today the
[1:04:35] revivals that we're supposed to have we

[1:05:29] I read this scripture
[1:05:32] and I found it applicable
[1:05:36] prophetic for us
[1:05:39] Psalm 17 15.
[1:05:42] David said as for me I will Behold thy
[1:05:46] face in righteousness of course the word
[1:05:50] righteousness is the word being
[1:05:51] fulfilled
[1:05:53] that's righteousness hello

[1:05:57] righteousness but notice
[1:05:59] I shall be what
[1:06:01] satisfied
[1:06:03] when I awake
[1:06:06] with thy likeness
[1:06:11] we've had nothing to waken this bride up
[1:06:14] yet he says
[1:06:16] it will take these unknown Thunders to
[1:06:19] do it
[1:06:20] but it'll be there
[1:06:22] God promised it
[1:06:24] right

[1:07:37] happen it's already been promised that
