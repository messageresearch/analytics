[53:47] pray amen and amen if you take your
[53:50] Bibles tonight we'll turn to the Book of
[53:53] Matthew once again Matthew chap chapter
[53:55] 5 I want to read just one verse of
[53:58] scripture there Matthew 5 and verse
[54:04] 6 and uh also going to read a few verses
[54:07] out of the book of Psalms Psalms 42 I'd
[54:10] like to read um we read this last night
[54:13] Matthew 5 and um verse
[54:18] 6 and the scripture says blessed are
[54:22] they which do hunger and thirst after
[54:24] righteousness
[54:26] for they shall be
[54:29] filled amen what a promise in the word
[54:31] of God tonight amen blessed are they
[54:34] which do hunger and thirst after
[54:37] righteousness for they shall be filled
[54:40] Psalms
[54:43] 42 very familiar passage of scripture
[54:48] Psalms 42 and verse
[54:53] one as the the heart panth after the
[54:56] water
[54:57] Brooks so panth my soul after thee Oh
[55:00] God my soul thirsteth for God for the
[55:03] Living God When shall I come and appear
[55:07] before God my tears have been my meat
[55:10] day and night while they continually say
[55:13] unto me where is thy God may the Lord
[55:17] just at his Blessing as you're seated
[55:21] tonight want to um we spoke last night
[55:26] on the blessing of
[55:28] hunger and uh I wanted to um just take
[55:32] this evening for a few minutes and speak
[55:34] on the blessing of
[55:35] thirst and you know as we was looking at
[55:38] uh the the blessing of hunger last night
[55:42] um brother brandham said that if we get
[55:44] if if the church would get hungry he
[55:46] said that there's got to be something
[55:49] there's got to be something to satisfy
[55:51] that hunger so when the church begins to
[55:53] get hungry and brother br would say uh
[55:56] in many places and many different ways
[55:58] you know that if people uh begin to
[56:01] hunger for God he said then there's got
[56:03] to be something that will satisfy that
[56:06] hunger amen he and and I believe that
[56:09] really and truly amen the that the
[56:11] problem in this day is not a lack
[56:14] because you know as we was looking at it
[56:16] last night there in the Book of Amos in
[56:18] the 8th chapter of Amos there that there
[56:20] would be a famine in the land in the
[56:21] last days and that famine would not be
[56:23] for bread and water but for the hearing
[56:25] of the word of God Amen and it's really
[56:28] not a lack of the word of God even
[56:30] because we have the word even brother
[56:32] Brandon would say there in the church
[56:33] age book he said we got more Bibles than
[56:35] we've ever had and and we've got you
[56:37] know and and not only that friends we
[56:39] got a message in this hour and God has
[56:41] provided these things for us and amen
[56:43] there's more provision than we've ever
[56:45] had we've got the word of God is more
[56:47] available to us and amen we've got it in
[56:50] the in in book form we got it in tape
[56:52] form we got it on our phones we got it
[56:54] in every kind of way that you can think
[56:55] of we have access to that word but so we
[56:58] can see by that that really and truly
[57:01] the problem if there is a problem amen
[57:03] it's the appetite of the people see amen
[57:06] it's the desire that we have amen
[57:09] because see whatever
[57:16] desire message thirst he said I just
[57:19] want to speak from tonight that one word
[57:21] out of the Bible and he said I was
[57:23] thinking about that that I'd preach the
[57:26] sermon on it thirsting after life and
[57:28] brother Brandon would take that and he
[57:29] said he looked up the word in the
[57:31] dictionary and he said he said it means
[57:33] see Webster says it's a painful desire a
[57:37] painful when you want something so bad
[57:40] until it becomes painful to you amen
[57:43] when you want something so bad brother
[57:45] Brandon would go on to say he said I
[57:47] think David in writing this of the
[57:48] Psalms it must have been in distress and
[57:51] usually it takes distress to bring the
[57:54] best out of of a man it really when God
[57:56] when you get down to when we fast many
[57:59] times to and get to oursel and position
[58:02] see to get oursel out of the way and I
[58:04] think when David got in these places
[58:06] then he began to meditate on the Lord
[58:09] and begin to think about things and many
[58:11] times God gets us in tight Corners amen
[58:14] listen brother R saying many times God
[58:16] gets us in tight
[58:18] Corners amen where we have to look up
[58:22] sometimes even we have to get on our
[58:24] back in a hospital or or on a bed
[58:26] somewhere that we can look up and see
[58:30] where the great blessings of God are
[58:32] coming from amen he said now it's not an
[58:35] unnatural thing to thirst it's a natural
[58:38] thing it's just simply something that
[58:40] God has given us that we could a a
[58:43] desire for something something God has
[58:45] given us and see he's given you a
[58:47] control tower something that sits on the
[58:49] inside of you that controls these
[58:52] different desires see and this thirst
[58:54] this control tire is set in a man's
[58:56] heart is something that God gave him to
[58:59] warn him of the desires and the things
[59:01] that's needful for him amen so you can
[59:04] see by what brother Bram is saying that
[59:06] God Amen puts a thirst in a man brother
[59:09] bam would even take it to the Natural
[59:11] thirst and he would show that God put
[59:13] that in you to show you that you got a
[59:16] need for something let me just say this
[59:18] in starting out tonight The Thirst alone
[59:21] amen it will never uh see if you only
[59:24] had a thirst and that's all you had and
[59:27] there was nothing to satisfy The Thirst
[59:30] listen thirst only shows you what you
[59:32] don't
[59:33] have a thirst is only revealing to you
[59:37] something that you need amen so you see
[59:40] amen it could not be just it's not
[59:42] enough just for us to be thirsty amen
[59:46] there's got to be something that would
[59:48] answer or satisfy that desire amen
[59:51] that's why brother B said if there's a
[59:53] deep calling there's got to be a deep to
[59:55] respond to that call amen but listen
[59:58] friends if there was no thirst there
[1:00:00] amen then you would not realize you had
[1:00:02] a
[1:00:03] need it takes The Thirst to reveal to
[1:00:05] you amen that you're lacking
[1:00:08] something amen that's why just having
[1:00:10] The Thirst alone is a blessing as we
[1:00:13] said last night just to be hungry is a
[1:00:15] blessing listen friends I'm going to
[1:00:17] tell you in the day we're living and
[1:00:18] just to have a desire to serve God is a
[1:00:21] blessing amen just to have a desire to
[1:00:24] come to the house of God that's a
[1:00:26] blessing listen friends it's a great
[1:00:28] blessing that a amen that a pastor could
[1:00:30] call a weeklong meeting like this and
[1:00:33] amen even after four or five nights
[1:00:34] there's still people showing up to
[1:00:36] church amen that's a blessing amen it
[1:00:39] shows that somebody's got a desire
[1:00:42] listen you could be a lot of places
[1:00:43] tonight amen these young people could be
[1:00:45] a lot of places tonight amen but because
[1:00:48] there's a thirst there's a hunger
[1:00:50] there's a desire Amen in your heart amen
[1:00:53] that's what brought brought you
[1:00:55] here hallelujah amen and just to have
[1:00:58] that desire just to have a desire Amen
[1:01:01] to to to to serve God and to love God
[1:01:04] and to feed on the word of God oh it's a
[1:01:07] great blessing to have that desire
[1:01:09] tonight brother B said God put that in a
[1:01:11] man to show him amen something that he
[1:01:14] needs amen I love this amen the prophet
[1:01:18] said see it's not an unnatural thing and
[1:01:20] David said here thirsting for water amen
[1:01:23] thirsting see the body is in need of
[1:01:25] something and if you don't Supply that
[1:01:27] amen you're going to perish amen then
[1:01:29] David would describe it here as a heart
[1:01:31] panth after the water books so my soul
[1:01:34] after thee Oh God as a heart see Amen in
[1:01:37] the heart brother BR said it's a great
[1:01:39] lesson that's laying there amen David
[1:01:41] said as a heart panth after amen that's
[1:01:43] a deer we all know that amen it's a it's
[1:01:46] a deer and and how that deer would amen
[1:01:49] when he's wounded brother B said he
[1:01:51] would go searching for the water amen
[1:01:54] this is going to open up a a a further
[1:01:56] revelation of what the prophet's talking
[1:01:58] about amen because David is comparing
[1:02:01] the thirst of a man's heart for God with
[1:02:04] a thirst that a a deer has for the
[1:02:07] waterbrook amen but a prophet op opens
[1:02:10] it up and he says listen this is not
[1:02:12] just a deer getting thirsty amen and
[1:02:14] wanting to take a drink of water this is
[1:02:17] actually a matter of life and
[1:02:19] death amen if he don't find the water
[1:02:22] he's going to die amen listen re amen
[1:02:24] that makes it so much different then
[1:02:26] it's not just a little bit amen you got
[1:02:28] a little appetite or or you got a little
[1:02:30] thirst and you know you want to just
[1:02:32] drink a little bit to quench The Thirst
[1:02:34] oh no amen listen this is a matter of
[1:02:36] life and death amen this is something
[1:02:39] that you come to a place that you
[1:02:41] realize if I don't have it I'm going to
[1:02:43] perish if I can't get it amen I'm going

[1:03:11] people get down to business with

[1:03:16] Brown talked about he went and nailed
[1:03:17] down in a corn field one day and he said
[1:03:20] God if you don't give me the Holy Ghost
[1:03:23] when you come back to this spot you'll
[1:03:25] find a pile of bones laying here amen he
[1:03:28] metant business with God he got to a
[1:03:30] place listen friends he amen it wasn't
[1:03:32] just coming to church and going home and
[1:03:34] amen coming walking up to an altar and
[1:03:37] amen putting your name on a church book

[1:03:44] perish hallelujah amen I got to have a
[1:03:48] real experience with God or our
[1:03:53] perish
[1:03:56] see that's what David's talking about
[1:03:59] here as a heart panth after the water
[1:04:03] books am me a longing a
[1:04:06] longing a painful
[1:04:09] desire now the prophet said there's many
[1:04:12] thirst and brother BR would take this
[1:04:14] and he say it's just like a a young man
[1:04:18] young
[1:04:19] woman it's not
[1:04:21] unnatural for a young man young woman to
[1:04:23] love one another see or to thirst for
[1:04:27] love see when they come to Aid there
[1:04:29] it's not a natural it's just a natural
[1:04:32] thing for them to do that brother Brown
[1:04:34] said God put it in them he put it in you
[1:04:38] am me that's even a reflection of God's
[1:04:40] desire yeah because even God long to
[1:04:43] have a
[1:04:44] family God longed for
[1:04:47] companionship God long for somebody that
[1:04:49] he could have relationship a fellowship
[1:04:52] amen with a a a and and then God
[1:04:55] reflects that in his creation with Adam
[1:04:57] and and when God looks at Adam he said
[1:04:59] it ain't good that man should be alone
[1:05:02] is that right so you see brother Brown
[1:05:05] said when the when our children become
[1:05:06] of age and you see young boys and young
[1:05:08] girls and they become attracted to one
[1:05:10] another and I tell you what in the day
[1:05:12] we're living in we ought to thank
[1:05:15] God am mean if your sons attracted to a
[1:05:18] girl you ought to just thank God for
[1:05:20] that Amen in this hour that we're living
[1:05:22] in amen I I tell you because there's so
[1:05:25] many perversions of that thirst that's
[1:05:28] what brother man we go into he says see
[1:05:30] that's a natural thing amen a desire
[1:05:33] that God has placed within them he said
[1:05:35] but what happens is is Satan will come
[1:05:37] and
[1:05:39] pervert amen that thirst amen that God
[1:05:42] has put in their heart amen for
[1:05:44] companionship and Amen brother B we go
[1:05:46] on and he says he says um he say it's
[1:05:49] not an unnatural thing he said for a
[1:05:52] woman to thirst to be
[1:05:54] pretty he said that's her god-given
[1:05:57] Instinct see her beauty that God gave
[1:06:00] her for for her mate and now we find out
[1:06:03] that women want to be that way and why
[1:06:05] is it that's just because it's something
[1:06:06] God gave her it's not wrong for a woman
[1:06:09] to be
[1:06:10] pretty the prophet said they should
[1:06:12] be amen amen there's nothing wrong with
[1:06:15] that see he said but the true thirst
[1:06:17] that a woman should have would be to
[1:06:20] Adorn themselves in modest
[1:06:22] apparel to have a Christlike spirit amen
[1:06:26] according to 1 Timothy 2:9 that's the
[1:06:28] way a woman should thirst to be see amen

[1:45:50] and we showed you that not only are you
[1:45:55] hungry but Jesus is hungry
[1:45:59] too and your hunger brought him on the
[1:46:01] scene but it was his hunger that brought
[1:46:07] you and
[1:46:09] Jesus looked at him he said I got a need
[1:46:12] go by the way of
[1:46:14] Samaria cuz he had an
[1:46:17] appointment he got thirsty
