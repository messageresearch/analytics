========================================

man why David was King and there was a prophet in the land and he that prophet amen should have been the one bringing the word back not David ain't that right the word should have been brought back to the prophet brother Brown said the reason that God sends prophets is because they have the word of the Lord now I hope this is all making sense to you tonight Amen to show you amen these things the word of the Lord comes to the prophets and if he doesn't have the word of the Lord then he's not a prophet ain't that right and the prophet is the Divine interpreter of the word yes sir so as we talked about it uh or just mentioned it about the he the lamb taking that book amen and opening the seals or loosening the seals opening that book and sending it down to his angel that seventh angel ain't that right to reveal it to his people and brother Brown said the seven Angel has to be Prophet for the word of God to come to no priest popes your young people don't don't get confused as to who you need to listen to you might have friends that trying to get you to listen to this radio preacher in this television evangelist you may have preachers leave this message and they might send a tape to you they've never been a prophet I ain't got time to listen to them hello I gotta live I need that food to live and so no priests popes or anything else can get it the word don't come to such the word of God comes only to a prophet always Malachi 4 promised such and when you would come forth he had take the mysteries of God where the church had got all scrupled up in all these denominations and restore restore the faith restored the life see restore the faith of the children back to the fathers then the world judgment will strike and the Earth would be burned up and and then the righteous will walk out upon the ashes of the wicked in the Millennium ain't that right oh we got a bright future yes sir see and and so but notice now amen what what how did it affect John when the book was open now this is all personal to us amen uh how did it affect him brother Branham he's saying this uh everything in heaven everything in Earth everything beneath the Earth every creature everything else heard me speaking of John was John is saying this in Revelations amen blessings Glory wisdom power might and riches belongs to him amen and then brother Branham would ask why why why would he do this why why is he so excited and what what happened when this book was open well brother Brown said the Revelation had come to John that the lamb the Redeemer our Kinsmen had come back from the Throne of minitorial and it walked out here to take his possession Hallelujah he had walked out to take his possession and that's what that open book meant to him now Church John represented you and I that's what the prophet said he was a type of us amen and and I know they want to criticize our shouting they want to criticize the way we we get excited about this word but see if you're eating from the open book one thing is going to come clear to you that you are his hello you were in his mind before the foundation of the world and if there's anybody that he come to redeem it was you ain't that right and we are in Redemption claims and if there's every anyone that he's going to claim it's me I'm the one that's going to be in the Rapture I don't know about everybody else but I know this the book has been opened and has become a personal thing to me I am feeding off of it I'm going in a rapture all right yes sir and notice when the book was open he wasn't weeping he wasn't sad you know he was he was weeping sad before the book came open but the lamb came forth and opened the book ain't that right amen and and instead of weeping instead of being sad and down face he entered into worship he entered into praise can you say amen he is wearing his fretting was over ain't that right he knew that his future was settled [Applause] amen he was at rest is that what the green pastors he maketh me to lie down isn't that what it's typifying I'm at rest I'm contented he leads me by the Steel Waters brother brother Andrew said he looked it up in that in his in his Bible there and it said Waters of rest it's rest the food that we're eating is giving us rest the word from our bridegroom is nothing but a word that gives us rest can you say Amen I I know the world is falling apart but I'm at rest I know judgments are coming all around but it does not concern me I'm in the book of redemption can you say Amen I'm eating a different food resting in his word think of it I saw another Mighty Angel come down with an open book and he cries out with a loud voice Paul would say for the Lord himself shall descend with a shout voice and Trump what is it this is Our Redeemer claiming what he has redeemed pouring life into his redeemed bringing a restoration ain't that right did not the words of Boaz put Ruth's thrust hello for he said unto her fear not that's what Boaz said to his bride fear not I will do to thee all that thou requireest I will redeem thee and them words put her at rest oh Hallelujah I've noticed that of all the seminaries that have produced preachers they still can't give the people rest that's right amen the God would send the prophet to us to reveal the open book and through this message it puts us at rest because we realize it's more than a prophet it's the voice of a bridegroom speaking to us Redemption now if you'll notice David said he leads me beside the Still Waters water is a type of the Holy Spirit water is also important because it it represents life ain't that right if you're thirsty for fresh water you have to know where it is in order to get a drink you can't also you can't water anything if I say well I'm going to I'm going to go water the grass I gotta have water first in order to water that's right ain't that right so water is important but God made sure he's always made sure that there's water when the children of Israel were dying of thirst God calls water to come from The Rock and that rock was Christ Paul said ain't that right and so David was led by The Still Waters showing that Christ was present that rock where else would the water come from but Christ the Rock then you say Amen so wherever the water is you'll find Christ and wherever Christ is you'll find the water ain't that right in the Old Testament there were two kings that led both their armies out into the desert Jehoshaphat and maybe ahab's son or Ahab I don't know but but they they LED their armies out into the desert and and someone forgot to bring the water Jack right and and and so they were dying of thirst and they didn't know where to find the water now to think of that you're thirsty but you don't know where the water is you as far as they were concerned there was no water but but one was you know had enough sense to know there's a prophet in the land let's inquire of him surely he will know where the water is can you say man see the water was hidden to them that's right see amen so they consulted the the the the prophet and he told them where the water was and our Prophet tells us it was the same water that flowed out of that rock for the previous generations same water not a new water same water can you say amen I I thank God for uh sending us a prophet because it's in this day that he would show us where the water is can you say Amen it's that same spirit that was in Christ that fell on the day of Pentecost is here with us today and that's where the water is the water amen see so hidden food hidden water it takes a profit to tell us take so profit to bring us our food takes the profit to reveal where the water is ain't that right so you must must not never underestimate the prophet in his message I know people you know Satan's got them always you got them you know uh down on the prophet and all that and then you got them worshiping the prophet there's always two ways of it in two extremes but the rats stand right in that middle can you say Amen we're not one worshiping the prophet we worship the god of that prophet yes sir you know Israel was blessed because they had a prophet among them brother Branham said they were not an organized Nation like the other nations but they prospered They Came Upon the Nations and took them anything that came in the way he said they they took it because they had a prophet and this is balak's words the king of Moab when he looked down upon Israel he says they lick up all that are around about us as the ox lift licketh up the grass of the field and they cover the face of the Earth and and and this is balak that was looking at the people of Israel and he didn't understand why ain't that right he didn't understand why they prospered he just knew they did he didn't understand the the the key of them conquering but he just knew they did but brother Brandon would tell us the key was there was a prophet among them someone that led them can you say Amen the key to their prospering was a prophet being among them the key to them looking up Elder enemies was because a prophet was among them I think that applies it today and brother Brown said that Prophet was a Divine called leader ain't that rocked so notice David would say the Lord is my shepherd He leadeth me beside the Still Waters and a lot of people say well I don't need a prophet I got the Holy Ghost to Lead Me you've got to go the way God does it [Applause] can you say Amen now he told Moses I'm going to send mine Angel to go before you he's going to lead you but who was there before the people a prophet wherever that Prophet was the people needed to be and wherever the spirit of God was the prophet was he was the key to the spirit of the Lord he won't say it that way I just believe that amen but see is this not what happened Amen to Rebecca in the Old Testament being led to the waters brother Brown said it was in the evening time when she was led to the Water of Life about the time she had to make a decision [Applause] and the angel of the Lord told her to go and at the evening time she was led to the Waters of life ain't that right now Romans 8 14 says as many as are led by the spirit of God these are the sons of God ain't that right so these these these Sons again have a sheep like nature and Rebecca is a type of the uh of the Bride in these last days the evening time and notice what the prophet says the evening lights are here it's the time that the angel of the Lord in a Supernatural is revealing himself to the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac and somehow or another she's moved to go to the Waters of life amen oh my heart is turning over with joy I can hardly preach when I think of that the evening time is here it's come the angel of the Lord is in the message Goes Forth and Woos the Rebecca to come to the Waters of life is that not what the message is doing the Lord he leadeth me beside the Still Waters and it would be so happened that it would be in the evening time that the angel of the Lord in the message of this hour is leading us to the waters can you say man and notice now I think this is important I'm not going to keep you much longer but I believe this is important because what did Rebecca do with that water what did she do with the water she took the water and watered the very Beast that was going to take her away from where she was to meet her Isaac Hallelujah isn't that wonderful she was sustaining the life of that power of that Beast brother Branham says power Beast represents power can you say man in other words she ain't gonna let that power die she wasn't going to let that Beast get so famished amen that it wasn't able to take her where she needed to go hello church amen and we are watering we've been led to the Waters of Life what are you going to do to the waters what are you going to do with that water you're going to water the power that's right now notice the prophets that Jesus wants a good drink of uh wants a drink of good old Pentecostal not some old Baptist dried up dead formalism [Applause] contaminated water he said Jesus is thirsty for a good old Pentecostal fresh drink of water can you say Amen who is able to give him that water those that is led to the water those that have been planted by the water those that have been predestinated to eternal life they've got eternal life they know what to do with that eternal life not just sit on a Pew like a not on a log and don't know what's going on and wish that they were out of the outer church and it's just boring and you know I guess we just go go to church for a little bit and then we'll go do our own thing get more excited at a baseball game at a tennis ball game or or at a soccer or football whatever you want to call it get more excited about fishing talking about the fishing talking about hunting more than we do about the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] Jesus wants a drink of good old Pentecostal fresh water so then I guess when David is saying he leads me beside the Still Waters he was led to the good old Pentecostal freshwater he said see these denominational stagnant Waters is sickening to him now you think of it aren't you glad for his leading well some of us aren't you glad for his leading you could have been one of those that all you had was that a a stagnated denominational water to give him that would make him sick but you are one that's been LED to the waters and you say Amen now he says take the word of God and pull it you got sustaining strength so don't just I don't know if I can pull it no strong bride that's been inoculated from all these diseases and germs you've got sustaining strength in you pull that word out and start cutting through every demon of unbelief cut through all these Creeds and things till we can hit that place where there's fresh drink for him a real true worship a genuine heart [Applause] God have mercy where he can pour down his and make his word live in this day and he will have it he will have it is there someone going to give him fresh water tonight amen he will have it well I've been raised in this message all my life I don't see anything excited oh you got to get to the waters let him lead you to the water can you say Amen don't just be led to the church that's what the pro now that's what the prophet was saying too many people get him to the church instead of to Christ but there was a prophet in this day that would take a people to Christ to The Living Water to where they could take a drink and begin to pour water and praise him [Applause] [Music] yes sir see the bride today has what it takes to take that Water of Life and water the very power that's going to take her to her Isaac all right amen that's it praise God you say well I've been in the mess but I just don't know I just don't know well you ain't watering it come on because I guarantee if you're watering it you know your camel's gonna have life you know your camel's gonna make it and you keep watering her in power don't you just sit there like a a a log on a a knot on a log don't you just sit there amen and pretend like nothing is happening there is something happening there is a power and it's up to you to water it [Music] now listen brother Brown says the very power that we're watering now now how are you going to water it how do I water it by coming to church and just sitting there now you ain't doing nothing well I wish that I wish that I wish the musicians would get their act together you ain't watering by criticizing can you say Amen well I just don't know about that preacher I just I wish my pastor was a better one and I wish this and I was I wish my wife would be better I wish my I was my children was perfect amen you ain't gonna get anywhere by doing that that ain't watering brother Branham says we the very power that we're watering now with praises everybody say Praises Thanksgiving Glory power might is the very Holy Spirit that'll pack us up to see Jesus someday and I tell you that power is here through the open book that's what John saw he saw himself in the book and he began to water he began to praise he began to glorify he knew that it was going to take him home come on could you imagine if God would lead you out in the middle of a desert with no water but God was good enough to Lead You By the Waters to bring you to the Waters of life that you could take a drink that means taking a drink of that Waters of life that spirit of God upon that word to make that word and you live amen but now you've got that water and you're watering it back watering the power with your praise [Applause] where does this water come from there was a little old lady that wanted to know where the water was John 4 5. then cometh he to the city of Samaria which is called psychar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his own son Joseph or to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey set thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then set the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asks a drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said to her if thou knew us the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me a drink thou would ask of him and he would have given thee Living Water and you can imagine she's looking around for that water I don't see anything but my water on the water I got is to give you is that from this well of Jacobs and he's talking about living water now notice and the woman said to him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from Winston hast thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which he gave us the will and drink thereof of this well himself and his children and his cattle and Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and notice what the woman says there's something beginning to strike her heart and she sits her give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw notice now Jesus is going to give her the water Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither and the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou has now has is not thy husband and in that sentence thou truly and the woman said unto him sir sir I perceive that thou art a prophet oh she's starting to drink our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believed me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet had Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we we know we what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father's sake of such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he is come he will tell us all things that he's going to give her the water Jesus saith unto her eye that speak unto thee am he a oh my now let's look he the Fountain of Living Waters was talking to her and he proved it by the Messiah sign and you say Amen the water was right there and he proves it to her by the Messiah sign and gives her a drink ain't that right now now we're going to show you why she got how she got drink uh uh and now the prophet said when that predestinated seed struck that Water of Life she said sir you must be a prophet I know that when the Messiah cometh he will tell us all things so you knew that she took a drink of water of life because all of a sudden it's her ass came open and said sir that must be a prophet and we know when the Messiah cometh he will do these things now look at all the others that kept after when he would do them things they would say oh that's of the devil that's Beelzebub that's this that's that all right they didn't drink of the water of life but she took of the Water of Life and it opened her eyes can you say Amen now notice this living water is divine revelation that's it right there brother yeah everybody say Living Water is divine revelation now notice brother Brown says that woman left her pot water pot and ran into the city with a heart full of Revelation she took a drink and got a Heart full of Revelation oh my god well do you love him you know remember the time that Elijah went into the cave after preaching to the White House of his day he had preached and brother Brown said they had been rejected and so he preached the White House they rejected him and then he went off the scene the Lord took him off the scene his voice become quiet ain't that right brother Brown said God called him off the scene and said you've Elijah you've done major message known to all of Israel they know it now come up here in the wilderness get away from them separate yourself because I'm going to do something I'm going to show them what it is to turn my message down and what set in war famine and starvation then brother Branham says thus saith the Lord watch what's coming what's what's what's going to follow there was a famine there will be a famine oh maybe not for bread but for the hearing of the word of God and his truth all the churches will socialize and go right on in it just the same just like they've already been swallowed up with it ain't that right but notice when Elijah left he found a Hidden Spring all right up in the mountain found a little spring and brother Brandon says see he got some Water of Life Divine Revelations from God as he set up there under the power of God so when David is saying he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he was led to Divine Revelations can you say Amen and that's exactly where we've been LED in the evening time amen do you believe that sold them Revelation the revelations that that Elijah that was receiving was a little Hidden Spring that he was drinking from while the rest of them were famishing that's what the prophet said ain't that right I'm gonna close now he has led us by The Still Waters if you look at Revelation 6 6. John would write in I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine man all right ain't that right we know what the wall is it's the Holy Spirit and what is the what is the wine it's stimulation of Revelation when that Revelation comes you get stimulated ain't that right and brother Brandon said oil and wine is always connected with Worship in the Bible and so what stimulates the church revelation ain't that right now that that word stimulate means to excite to activity sir growth to Quicken ain't that right now notice what brother Brown would tell us and I'm closing the wine is the water the Revelation that reveals that interpretation of the word which stimulates the believer so what are you watering the power with you got the water right and you're worshiping now there's a lot of people worshiping today but what did the prophet say their awards are being the devil Satan thinking they're worshiping God they're worshiping without revelation can you say Amen they're playing their music they've got their choirs they've got it all but it's all in a worship that they're thinking they're worshiping God but they're actually worshiping Satan [Music] can you say Amen but now is the time for King lamb worship foreign the bride she has been eating off of the open book she has been partaking of the water of Revelation amen and with that water she is worshiping and watering the very power the very power that's going to take her home well do you love it if there's ever a people whose worship means something to God it's this bride it's the people that believe this message the people that's got a revelation of this message it don't mean that you know it all I don't understand all this message but all I know that Revelation that I have come is from God [Applause] well do you love him my my mind if the musicians will come taking that water that we have received the Water of Life that's what it is it's a fountain of life it's Waters of life a man that has been made known to us through the message of this hour and the same sign that Jesus performed for that woman at the well he's done it again today and brother Bradham said it's more of a supernatural act than a man was getting out of the wheelchair he said because a man that gets out of that wheelchair he could get rise up on emotions they said there ain't no emotion that can do this there ain't no psychologists that could do this there ain't no soothsayer that could do this and we all have to say this is God this is God can you say bad do you love him aren't you glad you've been LED to the Green Pastures The Still Waters how about we water the word tonight let's lift our hands unto the Lord and just worship Him to love him Church we've got something to worship God about we got something to praise God about he's worthy of our praise he's worthy of our love he's worthy of our Thanksgiving we ain't got room for complaints we ain't got room for gripes we we ain't got room for downhearted the book has been opened we've got a bright future I don't know what I don't care what's happening to you right now look at your future it's bright amen whatever you're going through that's only temporary to think of it tomorrow the Lord could come right now the Lord can come any moment the Lord could come and you've got that Revelation that you're one of them that he's coming back for we ought to praise God we ought to worship God when the world don't know what to do they they don't know nothing about the future their their future is Bleak they're they're headed to tribulation the wrath of God is hovering upon them but the grace of God has covered us oh my my my my I love him I
