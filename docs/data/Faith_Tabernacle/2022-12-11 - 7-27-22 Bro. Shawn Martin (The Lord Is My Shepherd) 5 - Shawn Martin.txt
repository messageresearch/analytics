Sunday and the Lord just really moved Sunday night and and just had a wonderful time and you know just always good to to see the people of God helped delivered set free couraged a man and just thanked the Lord for passing by our way and we certainly want to keep sister Mariah in our prayer she's uh at the hospital they said she had preeclampsia and blood pressure high this has got a little ring in it but the blood her blood pressure's been high and so but they I guess induster oh I don't know about three o'clock today and so I text Brother Andrew to see how she's doing and she's she's resting

sister amen so it's certainly good to have you tonight and just everyone praise the Lord and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father as we come to this part of this service Lord we we realize just how needy we are and Lord we can open the book this Bible with our hands with physical strength but it takes you to open our understanding and may you do so tonight father that you would just help us Lord and just anoint both speaker and hearer that when we leave this place Lord we we know that we've met with you father we're just so thankful for what you've done Sunday evening and ministering to your people the Lord this is another night Lord this is another service and father if you just come in your special way we just pray a special blessing on brother Andrew and sister Mariah father give them rest and peace Father Lord and just let everything just work out okay we ask it in Jesus Christ's name the church says amen amen just the first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. amen and then if you'd like to turn with me the Book of John the first chapter amen John 1 and I think we're going to start at the 28th verse says these things were done in [Music] bethabara Beyond Jordan where John was baptizing the next day John saith Jesus coming into him and saith Behold the Lamb of God was taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which referred before me or which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore I am come baptizing with water and John bear records saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and yet Abode upon Him amen you can have your seats this evening and I want to just continue with the thought the Lord is my shepherd and pray that it'll be a blessing and certainly don't want to be repetitious but yet I I have a just uh something on my heart and yet I don't know how to get it out per se but pray the Lord will help us but of course David here saying the Lord is my shepherd and and and David you know he was a a shepherd and he was a Woodsman and and uh so he he used different terminologies um as that would be fitting uh maybe for his understanding his way of life and just like in one place he said as the heart penneth after the water Brook so does my soul long after thee and so him knowing the nature of the of deer and um so he he would compare the same thirst that a deer would have maybe when it was wounded and it's searching for water and and it's just that desperate need for water and he would compare his soul to that that he was desperate for God and and so um uh and and so the prophet said that God dealt with David according to the way his mind ran and he says he he does that with all of his uh men he said God always deals with men just according to the way that their minds run and so you know David being out in the in the wilderness way out there with the the sheep and it was drives thirsty and there he would say in Psalm 63 1 my soul thirsteth for thee My Flesh longest for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is and so he he would compare his experiences with God to to the things of the natural but here in our opening scripture he writes the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadeth me and you know talking there I I believe that this is very applicable uh for us today the Lord being the shepherd and weeping his sheep and David didn't say they lead me but he said he leadeth me so it's not speaking of plural but it's it's one it's it's a relationship and there is no other that would lead David or lead the children of God than the Lord himself it is he that leadeth me David would say beside the Still Waters he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake ain't that right now this is this leading is is is um very very few can follow that leadership especially in this day and and because Paul would write in second Timothy three and two he said for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and holy with now without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despisers of those that are good brother Brown puts that emphasis the bride Traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and and he would say now people say well that's just that's the heathens that's just flat ungodly hell-bound people we all can recognize them but then Peter or Paul would say but having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof ain't that right so so brother Branham would let us in on it having a form see anointed ordained ministers having a form of godliness but denying that he's the same yesterday today and forever that now notice these so that they would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God lovers of their own selves and and they would have this form of godliness so religious going to church worshiping God so they say but they would deny his power they would deny the power that would come and and so uh in other words they deny his word and and so the prophet would say how do they deny Jesus in that day who did they deny when they denied Jesus it was the word for in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us ain't that right and and so whatever word that that was prophesied of of the Messiah in the Old Testament well that word became flesh and fulfilled every Prophecy of the Old Testament that spoke of the Messiah he he was the sacrifice that that natural lamb spoke of in the Old Testament he was the altar he was the high priest he was he he was at all and and everything was types and shadows that spoke of the Messiah ain't that right so when they rejected him they rejected the word every prophecy in every type and every shadow that was in the Old Testament that spoke of him they denied it all and said that it can't be so because here he is he's fulfilling the very word so they they didn't realize they were thinking they were they they were just rejecting that man but they were actually rejecting the word and so they were religious they talked from their Bible but they denied the present day were now we all know that he's the word ain't that right we know he's the word because John said he was in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God John 1 1 and then John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so they crucified the word they denied the word and and it was the present day word oh they could tell you about Moses and said where of Moses and and they were clinging to Moses but Moses was already gone past he had already he had already preached his day but here was Jesus the word fulfilling what Moses said would happen and they denied him so what what are they doing today the same thing anointed preaching the gospel of Pentecost but denying the present day promise of the word being Vindicated Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever ain't that right so we can say well Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then why does people turn him down when he tries to do what he'd done back then he tried to do today they say oh that's mental telepathy well he discerned Peter he told Peter he was he told Nathaniel who he was didn't even know them and yet he told them who who they were and what they'd done and all of that ain't that right but when Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever done it in this day they turned him away and said oh that's Beelzebub that's mental telepathy that's of the devil don't you listen to that ain't that right so so then he says from such turn away Pete Paul says that for this of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with divers lost so now this is prophetica of today in this age an hour that they would the ministers would deny the Lord or deny the power they would have the form of godliness the people would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof and this would be those that would creep into houses televisions and and TV evangelists and radio preachers and and all of these things and and and Lead captive silly women Laden with sin LED away how are they LED away not by the shepherd but with divers or various lusts now brother Brown says see it's ours they say well our sowing parties and our so and so somebody come around trying to misinterpret the word and saying this will it's all right sister for you to have short hair see don't pay no attention to that nitwit see you you you just wear this it's not that it's it's not about pants it's not about the the the the clothing that you wear your outward appearance see it's what comes out of the man's heart that defiles him see and so he says do you realize that you're Anointed with an evil lustful dirty spirit ain't that right see you might sing in the choir with short hair but you've got an evil spirit and that's contrary to the word ain't that right so then he says see it's these groups of people full of Blasphemous names calling themselves Christians that with forms of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is the sword that leads silly women Laden with various or diver's lust now notice it's not talking about Godly Godly sisters and that that that's not what he's talking about see and and you sisters should be thankful every day that God has separated you uh from such scriptures as this because there are women that that aren't silly women you know you understand what I'm saying that's what Paul called them they're LED away silly women leading lead way captive by their uh various loves but God's got real genuine sisters that that just believe the word of God ain't that right see and and so you you you understand that they are being led but they're not being led by the shepherd amen they're they're they're uh the shepherd's not doing the leading now another place in second Peter 3 and 14 it says wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless ain't that right and the count that the long-suffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his of his Epistles see speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest in other words they wrestle with these scriptures see as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction amen God didn't write the scriptures that we would wrestle with them and fight with them and struggle with them but we would accept them as the truth do you believe that now now Peter is saying that these things are hard to be understood but none other but nonetheless they are for our benefit and if we wrestled against them therefore our destruction now ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before listen beware lest you also being led everybody say LED away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness ain't that right so it's in this age in this hour that many people are being led by the error of the wicked ain't that right but then there is a group you know Romans 8 and 14 Paul would write for as many as are LED everybody say lead by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen so they're not being led by their various or divers lusts they're not being led away with the heir of the wicked but these are actually sons of God that are led by the spirit of God so many today are being led by their own lusts and that word lusts is desire their own desire their own craving their own ones their own passions amen the way they view their scriptures the way they interpret things and way they really want to be and and all of these things and you know we can get our own interpretation of scriptures by our own desire you understand what I'm saying amen well if we don't want to do this certain part of the scripture well we can actually explain that part away and just tell you know to show amen and justify ourselves but see they're being led by their own lusts and then there's millions that are being led Away by the error of of the wicked ain't that right but very few are being led by the spirit of God now now as I said you know uh last time uh this scripture Psalms 23 it's been used in funerals it's been used everywhere as a as a comfort to many people but yet it's not to be used as just a cliche it's it's not just to be used as just to pour them on the wall but but this is a literal thing the Lord is my shepherd you see when the Lord when we view the Lord amen we must view him not as just a god up in the in the heavens uh uh not as one that is just coming back amen but we must view him as our Shepherd personal can you say man it's not just the Shepherd of the world he's my shepherd and I am his sheep I'm his lamb ain't that right and and so uh the sons of God can be led by the spirit of God because they are Lambs of God do you believe that they are lambs and the prophet would tell us when he can have complete everybody say complete control of us when he can have complete control of us a man then he can lead us and guide us ain't that right amen but as long as we've got we're giving him Park control amen he's not going to be able to lead he's he's not going to be able to guide and this why it takes a lamb because as we said a lamb is willing a lamb forfeits everything a lamb is dumb a lamb cannot a sheep cannot lead sheep sheep cannot lead itself they've got to have a Shepherd can you say amen and this is why that God would like in his people as sheep not trying to tell God what to do not trying to explain this Bible away not to spend all your Christian Life a man just uh uh ignoring the word of God ignoring what the events are happening today amen and and these things because we just can't believe it we just can't see how it how God would send a prophet in this days so we'll shut up Malachi 4 and 5 and act though as though it doesn't exist we'll we'll take all of these scriptures that explained today and the events of what's happening and if we're not sheep if we don't have that sheep like nature amen we'll sit there and argue with God but God cannot lead us and guide us into uh until he has the complete control of us can you say man and and so he must have complete control everybody say complete control the shepherd must have complete control of us in other words he's got to have a strong influence in your life ain't that right he's got to have more influence in your life than Mom and Dad he's got to have more influence in your life amen than the president of the United States or the or the Republican party or the Democrat Party or he's got to have more influence in your life than your job your money your retirement package your wife your husband the preacher whatever God's got to have the strong influence the main influence in your life he's got to have that because he's the one that has to have complete control do you believe that a man see and so now if you're looking at it the word again the Lord is my shepherd and you know what the shepherd is it's the anointed word the anointed word is what you're following ain't that right amen well it's it's true and and so uh we find that that in the Book of John and I won't keep you alone tonight but in the Book of John we we read where Jesus is identified as being the Lamb of God and and the Lord God is identified as the dove ain't that right he saw the spirit of God descending upon him like an unto a dove and where did he send descend upon where did he light upon not the church not denomination not some Priest Some Bishop he he landed upon the lamb John just identified him and said this is the Lamb of God he's the lamb ain't that right to take away the sins of the world Amen and when he identified that God would identify with his Spirit forming as a dove in the form of a dove why the dove is the gentlest most meekest most cleanest bird in all of heavens and the lamb is the most jetless the meekest the uh uh uh animal of all the Earth amen and so we find that when the land the dove descends upon the Lamb of God a voice speaks from heaven and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in ain't that right he was pleased to dwell in now the prophet said this was one of the greatest events that had ever taken place up to that time amen why amen you sin the dove come up on that lamb what is it it was the Dove and lamb uniting together Heaven and Earth embraced each other God and man become one can you say amen God was able to become one with man again amen see and so this is when God came down from the spirit form and was made a man and dwelt Among Us that's when all eternity embraced each other that's when the human Fallen race of Adam's people and Jehovah God and every angel came together when God and man was made one on that great Memorial Day when John baptized Jesus ain't that right so what a time that was and When sin had separated man and and and and and Driven Man from God and and and and and oh my what a what a a wreck we were that God finally had a man upon the Earth with the right nature that he could come down and be with man again and unite himself to where the word would become flesh ain't that right in so much that when Philip says oh talking to Jesus said it would suffice us if you would show us the father and fill it and Jesus said Philip have I not have I been so long with you and you still don't know who I am he that has seen me has seen the father can you say Amen then how sayest thou show us the father a Oneness amen that you realize this couldn't have happened if Jesus would didn't have a lamb nature if he wasn't a lamb so as we stated before that Jesus was led not driven and sons of God are LED and not driven when it gets to the place you have to be driven driven it's it's it's wrong relationship you got to get the lamb like nature ain't that right he was led by the spirit the prophet said to take Peter James and John to this exceeding high mountain he was led he was led to Golgotha he was led to pilate's Hall he was led to the mountain of uh to the Wilderness to be tempted why he was a lamb ain't that right so now this is the same Oneness that Jesus prayed for In You and I you believe it John 17 19 and for their sakes I sanctify myself again that showed he was a lamb he forfeited every right he had as a human being for your sake that's what the prophet said he could have had a wife but he forfeited for your sake he could have done this he could have done that he could have done he could have had it all he could have the wealth of the world but he forfeited it for your sake and he said I sanctify myself for their sakes that they also might be Sanctified through the truth ain't that right what a lamb neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I am thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One thank you hello now they try to show that Jesus is one in the sense that the flesh was one deity the flesh was not deity or that flesh couldn't have died and you say man that flesh bled that flesh hungered that that flesh thirsted that flesh sought for the father's will that flesh had to pray just like you have to pray ain't that right see make them one even as We Are One i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sick me and has loved them as thou has Loved Me Do You Realize they're questioning the the the legitimacy of Jesus birth they're re they're they're questioning the legitimacy of his life they're questioning the legitimacy of who he is but when you and I become one with the father it's when they will know that what he truly was hello amen because he says this now because he says I am them thou and me that they may be perfect and one that the world may know that thou has sent me and just love them as thou has left me father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world o righteous father what a prayer huh the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love we're with thou has loved me may be in them and I am them can you say Amen so see he's praying for Oneness now you know when man traveled to this part country or to this land they United themselves as one people and you know that that's all right but the thing of it was is they United under the wrong leadership they United themselves under the leadership of men can you say Amen and the prophet said but God wants man to unite unto the leadership of himself so so when when we're looking at the Lord as my shepherd it's not just easy to say the Lord is my shepherd amen you you he cannot be your Shepherd when you're trying to unite unto the leadership of some man when you're when you're coming under the wrong leadership and remember the church is all over are coming under the wrong leadership oh yes they're joining themselves together they are becoming one that they're becoming one under the World Council of churches instead of this word it ain't that right now God wants us to be one but he wants to be one in us and with us that's his Oneness ain't that right that's what the prophet said he wants to be one with us a man so man wants his fellow man to be his leader and unite under the wisdom of his fellow man man wants to be one why does man want to be one because God made him to be one ain't that right a banshee and so God designed him for that purpose God designed man the prophet would tell us made him up to be one to work together to cooperate together that's the makeup of man that's the way God made him but man wants to have his idea about it he wants to project something God that God never intended him to do he wants to figure his own ways out he wants to make his own plans he won't accept the plan that God made for him why it's because of his Fallen nature ain't that right so we see that being led of God just doesn't come automatically because you're raised in church or you've been raised in a Christian home and it isn't even because you accept the Lord Jesus as your savior or baptized you know in in the name of Jesus Christ amen we all know we all have this carnal nature and and a carnal mind carnal nature it and and it's something that is constantly working against God working against God be so religious as you want and still work against God ain't that right because it's not subject to the laws of God and Paul would tell us in Romans it cannot be it cannot be subject to the laws of God Amen see a man Isaiah 55 and 8 it says for my thoughts this is God telling us my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth think of that as high as the heavens amen are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts can you shame man that's right see so it shows that there can be no connection between God and man a man with the carnal nature you can think about God but you'll think of him in your own ideas you can talk about God that'll be in your own interpretation of him can you say Amen that there can be no connection between God and man until the nature their nature agrees together Dove and lamb ain't that right amen Dove nature doesn't agree with the wolf nature it just can't do it it takes the lamb nature yes sir now we know that a man can do God a service and not be his in his will and well I'm going to do this and I'm doing that and I'm doing this and it's all religious and it all looks good and yet it can be a service unto God and it not be the will of God but notice the prophet says but a man cannot be led by the spirit of God and get out of the will of God if you're LED if a man is truly led by the spirit of God it's impossible for him to get out of the will of God that you can do god of service and not be his will ain't that right brother Brandon said because as long as he's led by the spirit that's God's will sometimes he does things that he don't even know why know what he's doing himself and don't realize why he does do it but it's God working it around for the good ain't that right but then we find a group of people Matthew 7 and 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he everybody say but that's a big word but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven ain't that right there's going to be many people busy doing the things of God doing for the kingdom of God and yet not all of them are going to enter into the kingdom in that day but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven in other words he that was the sheep and I could lead him and I could Shepherd him amen and lead him in the will of my father can you say Amen many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works see it was their interpretation amen of what they thought God wanted ain't that right that they were led by their own pernicious ways they they were led by their own divers lust they were led by the the heir of the wicked can you say Amen thinking that was that was that's the thing that God would uh approve of well sure we would think God would approve of the blind eyes being open we think God would approve of all the Miracles that we're doing and all the things that are done but if it's not according to his will and you say Amen so although they were performing Miracle signs and wonders they don't have that lamb-like nature to be led by the spirit you remember Peter Peter before he was converted he did what he wanted to do too yeah ain't that right John 21 18 Jesus tells Peter verily verily I say unto thee when thou was young now Curtis thyself and walk just wither thou woodst but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thine hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee wither thou wouldest not ain't that right but I want you to notice the day that we're living in because I think this Bears a great responsibility upon every believer for this age now brother Bram says this he says no one would have any more respects for John Wesley sancti Moody Finney Knox Calvin a lot of them great men of past ages and and and any of those men than any of us ministers who appreciate men of God that would have for those men amen but you see we're coming on up on up we're not in that age you with me we're not in that age each one of them served in a different age and in a different measure but we're serving God today in a different measure from what they were you with me and he says if there is a tomorrow there will be an age and there will be a gospel for that age that will still advance until the whole thing is complete in God and God becomes one with us so as the day goes by there is a church that is becoming more like God the very thing that Jesus prayed for of a church becoming one with the father as he was one with the father it's happening in this age so I want you to understand that now we're Beyond just church ages we're just we're not just playing Church we're not we're not just Patty caking around we're not just doing our little Duty coming to church and hearing John 3 16 of how God so loved the world and we just all have a little a simple little message and it's just flowery and and then we just go home and just continue with our lives that's not what we're doing but we're understanding to brother Amos the true purpose of God there's a reason why he saved you there's a reason why he filled you with the Holy Ghost that there's a reason why he Sanctified you from all the filth and the sin and the uncleanliness of this world he wants to come to you like he came to Jesus on that day in the form of a dove he wants to come but you must have a nature that can be acceptant of him God becoming one think of that that's why I had no wonder Brandon would preach the lamb and the dove many times he had preached that sermon and other other sermons he would preach and he would talk about that lamb and the dove everybody now notice John 16 12. Jesus says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot hear them or bear them now albeit when he or by say he personal pronoun one person when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me and he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you I believe this is in connection with Revelations 10 1. where John saw the mighty angel coming down he the spirit of Truth came hello he the spirit of Truth came with an open book man was shut up from the truth there were truths in every age but it was just a little truth just a sliver of Truth uh we know these things uh Martin Luther had truths but he didn't have all the troops yeah just a little truth just shall live by faith ain't that right but he was still a drunk he didn't even teach he didn't teach the ways of holiness and they they were all worldly but then God would send a little bit more truth John Wesley with the with the message of sanctification to line it all back up and said yes it is just shall live by faith but you can't just live anywhere you want ain't that right but then here come that restoration of gifts there's a little more truth along at a time amen and here come the Pentecostals with the restoration of gifts ain't that right that yet they still didn't have all the truth because they were still baptized at Him Father Son and Holy Ghost some of them didn't believe in miracles a lot of the truth they didn't even know him as this Jesus Christ that's the same yesterday today and forever and even though they were up there in Azusa Street having a great time and still didn't have the truth that he was the same yesterday today and forever but then the lamb opened the book Revelations 5. the lamb opened the book ain't that right and John saw that Mighty Angel come down with an open book now we know it wasn't a literal book it was the revelation of the book being made known to the people can you say Amen the prophet said the lamb took the book Glory open the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel Revelation 10 7 talks about that angel to reveal it to his people can you say Amen well do you love him can we just go there Revelations 10 7 right fast amen Revelations 10 and 7. but in the days of the wars of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be what vanished revealed as he hath declared to his servants the prophets ain't that right so all the Mysteries were revealed at the sounding of the Seven Angels message ain't that right what did it reveal the hidden thoughts of God all right ain't that right it revealed the truth it revealed what was the truth ain't that right what was in the mind of God is the truth what is the doctrines of God is the truth there's the doctrines of man that ain't the truth but there is a doctrine of God that is the truth ain't that right the thoughts of man are nothing but lies but there is a thought that is the truth and that's the thought of God ain't that right did you know that there is a real truth about a son of God we think a Son of God is just about church membership signing a a a name on a piece of paper all right I'm going to heaven because I belong to I belong to this denomination I belong to that that ain't the truth that some man-made thing that was conjured up years ago ain't that right people sign their souls away trying to be Catholic and and they're all good people and they're trying to be right before God but there is a truth about it there's a truth about being a son of God did you know a Son of God was never saved on any given day you as always saved now aren't you glad that that mystery has been revealed to you you always were saved in the mind of God you were an eternal thought of God before the foundation of the world God just didn't know you when you was born he always knew you [Music] the Bible says that Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he was slain before the world was ever formed in the mind of God yes it happened on Earth that it was already done in the mind of God and you were saved yes you come to an altar but you were already saved in the mind of God praise God God knew you were going to have to do it God knew that a prophet of Malachi 4 would come in this age it was the mind of God ain't that right the prophet said you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with think of the god is eternal what is the son a son is a gene seed of their father ain't that right well if that's in the natural then you're a gene seed of God if you're a Son of God you're an attribute of God you're an attribute of his thinking ain't that right so you was always with God in his mind he knew you would come you're not an accident he knew you would come in this Sage he knew you'd be here tonight yes sir and he knows where you're going he knows what your future is that's the truth and he sent his blood to loose you from your sin that's the truth you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're sealed them that's what Paul said you grieve not the spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption how can you be lost then [Music] he's going to lead you into all truth isn't he we want to know what's truth well then say oh you can't be that you can't there there cannot be no security to Salvation there is a security to Salvation he does it when he seals you praise the Lord see a trout fish can never be a gar or a tadpole he might be in the same water with him but he was from the beginning of trout the Ned only caught him but he was that from the beginning and you were a Son of God from the beginning is this all right I know it's simple I uh we think of redemption the Bible says he come to redeem now we think of saved that he come something new but the Bible says he redeemed us with his own blood we are redeemed now the word redeemed is to bring back to the original place I've told you this before and I I think it's worth telling tonight but I had a well first of all we had young people over a few years back and the boys got to wrestling in the kitchen and one of them hit a plate I think it was or a pitcher or something glass and and it fell to the floor and it just shattered you know and actually I just bought that for my wife and now you're thinking of it now there's no way no way possible that I could put that plate or picture back together I had not the power to to put it back together and present it to my wife as it was in the beginning so therefore I could not redeem it now I could replace it which I think I did hopefully I could go to the store and get one just like it but I didn't redeem it because to redeem I had to take that very plate that was broken in thousands of pieces put it back together as though it never happened now what if I had the power to glue it all and I put it all pieces glued it's been hours to glue it all back and it's I say here you see all the fractures in it the line it still wasn't redeemed it had to be back the way it was ain't that right so I was not its Redeemer I couldn't redeem it I I only replaced it but the Bible says we were redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ right now this is the spirit of truth that come to lead us in the truth that we weren't just saved we were redeemed so if he redeemed us we had to be somewheres and the where we were in the beginning was in the mind of God now can I tell you where we were in the mind of God we were perfect in the mind of God we were holy in the mind of God we were Sanctified in the mind of God we were not a sinner in the mind of God we were Sons and Daughters of God in his mind I came here as a sinner and I need it to be redeemed but who was the one that could put me together can you say Amen there was nobody that could put me together no preacher could no Pope could no denomination good but God himself became a lamb and was led to Calvary and by that shedding of his blood was able to put all my pieces back together as though I never did it in the first place that's why you're not just forgiven you are Justified and the word Justified is though you're never done it in the first place aren't you glad that the spirit of Truth in this day would lead us in all truth oh goodness never did it now what did the prophet say he said now you could forgive me he said so let's just say how was that you know you heard that I went and done something or maybe I'd done something wrong to you brother peel and I come to you and ask you to forgive me and you'd say well I forgive you it's all done it's it's forgiven well you could forgive me but I'm still not justified because I did it you understand what I'm saying I did it now God didn't want to just forgive you of your sins he wanted to so redeem you that you could be justified right so then brother Branham uses the other analysis of how that maybe you heard that we'll use brother Amos you heard brother Amos went and got drunk he's out in the bar you heard he was out in the bar just stumbling around crousing and you heard that and he's just like oh my goodness a preacher brother Amos would do that poor Sister Lisa did she drive him to that or what and you'd have all these thoughts probably the first thing on the phone but then you heard that it was all a lie you heard that it wasn't true right you heard he he wasn't at the bar he wasn't drinking he wasn't caroused everything you heard about it was a lie it was wrong it was it was false to it and yet you still went to him and said brother Amos I forgive you then he could look at you and see but but what would you forgive me for I didn't do it can you say man I I I wasn't there I didn't do it that's what Justified means that God would so redeem you that you would be justified that there would be nothing to accuse you anymore that you could say but what sin are you talking about I never did do it why because now you're coming back to the thoughts of God God never saw you as a sinner he saw you as a son [Applause] well do you love him he's going to lead you no truth aren't you glad for an open book I'm glad for the spirit of truth that would come in this age he shall Lead You In All truth about Jesus name baptism he shall lead you into the truth about there being only one God working in three offices he shall lead you into the truth of the four stages of perfection three stages of the new birth four stages of perfection he's going to lead you into all truth can you say Amen he's going to lead you into the truth of what Romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for no he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren more over whom he did predestinate them he also past tense called and whom he passed ins called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also past tense already glorified can you say amen and ye shall lead you into all truth not just to see your present but to see your past not of what you did in this time but what you were in God and to show you what you are in the future you realize your future is secure and it takes the spirit of Truth to lead you into all truth can you say Amen he led you this far did he not he led you to an altar he led you to baptism he led you to the infilling of the Holy Ghost he leading you to the manifestation of sonship why it's the truth about you that's what he thought about you that's what is true and he's leading you from truth to truth the truth the truth everything about what he's leading you is truth Hallelujah Hallelujah Romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God that's truth for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly he was made a sinner not willingly but we were we were born in sin shape and iniquities come into this world speaking lies not willingly but we were we were slaves to the devil not willingly but we were can you say amen amen but by reason of him who has subjected you also in Hope even just to subject you into this world of sin but he subjected you in a hope glory to God because the creature itself shall so shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into this glorious Liberty of children of God that's the truth so the spirit of Truth didn't just come to educate us about truth he come to lead us into all truth well do you love him second Corinthians 3 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty What Spirit the spirit of Truth there's liberty aren't you glad you got Liberty to be sons of God how did you get that Liberty the spirit of Truth came and opened a book and he's leading you all truth and you're finding there's more Liberty than you've ever had you didn't have Liberty in the denomination you didn't have Liberty out in the world but when you heard the spirit of truth and the spirit of Truth began to lead you it began to give you Liberty we need the spirit of the Lord how many believes that we need the spirit of the Lord why it breaks the shackles it breaks the Fetters it frees you oh yes sir yes sir it changes things look Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters what did it do it changed the situation around it transformed everything what looked Bleak what looked hopeless the spirit of God changed it all amen that's why it's so important to entertain the spirit of God when he comes Among Us like he did Sunday night as the spirit of God coming Among Us why amen he's trying to lead us into truth and Satan was trying to bind us and he was trying to put shackles upon us he was trying to get us into a place of discouragement a place of hopeless but the spirit of God came and broke the shackles that he could continue to lead and guide and what does Satan always want to do he wants to point all the ugliness about it yeah yes sir he'll show you everything that is wrong and if you're not careful you'll miss your opportunity when God comes knocking some people have walked away from the spirit of God because they looked at it as being wrong they looked and say well I can't believe that's happening I can't believe that I can't believe that and what they don't realize is why they're looking at that the spirit of God is moving and many times they miss their last opportunity [Music] can you say man the spirit of Truth is more than an intellectual speech it's the spirit of God come and breaking shackles breaking yokes amen well surely you can say Amen to that it's truth ain't that Ryan he's going to lead you and guide you into all truth amen that's why the devil fights you with mind battles but then the spirit of God comes and breaks that power Hallelujah we didn't have the spirit of God breaking the Batman the shackles how we going to be led hello you find the shepherd is one that takes care of us he don't just lead us he takes care of us he keeps us from the evil when the lion come after that sheep David under the inspiration of God portraying the very spirit of God went after that line and brought that sheep back then you say man he brought and went and got that sheep out of the Bear's mouth and brought that sheet back and I'll tell you what God does it a lot when he brings his Spirit down upon us amen he's putting us he's rescuing us from the enemy I don't care if it's an enemy of sickness I don't care if it's an enemy of depression I don't care what enemy he's troubling you the spirit of God will rescue you amen that's why we need the spirit of God in our services amen now listen as we get ready to close how did he lead Israel Exodus 13 21. and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire you realize that Pillar of Fire is the same pillar fire that we're just reading about that is not a makeup it's not a Photoshop it's proven to be the genuine Pillar of Fire and that same pillar fire was hearing the scriptures leading to Israel can you say Amen oh goodness and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of the cloud now we saw that in 1963 come did we not the whole world recognized it they didn't know what it was but there was a prophet on the earth that said that's what this is it's the same pillar of cloud it's a cloud of angels the world has again has that traditional thought that it's always a Thunderhead cloud but if you trace it all the way back in the Bible days it was a cloud of angels can you say Amen now you say well I don't believe that then you've got to be a sheep to be led into all truth can you say man see you have to forfeit your rights but he says see and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night can you say amen he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor at the pillar of Fire by nine from before the people and why did he send them send these to lead the people to a land of promise oh my isn't the Lord wonderful
