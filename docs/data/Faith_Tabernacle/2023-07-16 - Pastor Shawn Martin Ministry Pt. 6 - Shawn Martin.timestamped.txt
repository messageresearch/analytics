[50:05] appreciate them and
[50:07] good to have Mark again back with us
[50:10] amen and we've had some good discussions
[50:13] on over the phone
[50:15] and
[50:17] he's uh he's not heard of this message
[50:20] before and
[50:23] but he's seems eager to learn and want
[50:27] to know more about it and so we just
[50:30] pray that the Lord will help him and
[50:33] reveal things I I believe if a man is
[50:36] truly truly hunger and for the Lord God
[50:39] will help him and show him and reveal
[50:43] things to him and where we've we're so
[50:46] blessed to know what God has done in
[50:48] this age
[50:49] and it's not been something that God
[50:53] done in the corner but it's it's he's
[50:55] done this worldwide and
[51:00] the world has rejected it of course but
[51:04] the Bible says it would but there's an
[51:07] elect and uh
[51:10] that well the Bible Jesus said wherever
[51:13] the carcass is there where the Eagles be
[51:15] gathered and so I am
[51:20] honored that the Lord would choose me to
[51:23] to be part of the message of the hour
[51:25] and it's our life and and I just thank
[51:29] the Lord for it
[51:30] before we go into the word may we just
[51:32] bow our heads and talk to our Lord

[52:38] father we desire that in Jesus Christ's
[52:41] name we pray and the church says amen
[52:45] and amen
[52:46] the John 10 10
[52:51] it says the thief cometh not but for to
[52:54] steal to kill and to destroy
[52:57] I am come that they might have life and
[53:01] that they might have it more abundantly
[53:04] amen you can have your seats
[53:07] this morning
[53:10] and um
[53:14] I uh I again want to use the title
[53:18] Ministry and we've we've kind of talked
[53:22] on it and here past few Sundays I guess
[53:25] and
[53:26] and
[53:27] the ministry of God
[53:30] and it's not it's not man's Ministry
[53:33] it's God's Ministry and again the word
[53:37] ministry refers to an agent
[53:40] or an instrument a person or thing
[53:44] through which
[53:46] uh something is accomplished and and so
[53:51] uh
[53:52] we've talked about there's Ministries in
[53:55] the government
[53:56] by which uh uh things are carried out
[54:00] and laws are are
[54:03] enforced and and these things but behind
[54:08] it all there's a purpose and God has a
[54:11] purpose for Ministry he has a purpose he
[54:14] has a plan
[54:15] and um
[54:18] but in order for it to be carried out
[54:21] uh uh he needed an agent through which
[54:24] he could carry out his plan and his
[54:28] purpose
[54:29] and just to talk about that plan most of
[54:33] us are familiar with the plan uh of God
[54:37] but it's a Plan of Redemption
[54:39] and uh so so God wants this this this
[54:44] uh plan to be carried out and this this
[54:48] word redeemed uh uh it means to bring
[54:53] what has fallen to its original
[54:56] condition bring back uh it was there at
[55:00] one time
[55:01] and then it fell and then to bring it
[55:05] back and
[55:07] um I guess
[55:09] I I you know maybe the best way I could
[55:12] describe it uh and we've used this
[55:14] illustration before but
[55:17] um
[55:20] redeem my uh we we had a dog uh her name
[55:24] was Ginger it was a corgi
[55:28] and
[55:30] no one like that dog I thought it was
[55:33] cute and Purdy and uh
[55:36] and so uh but but it would follow us
[55:39] through town we lit Pawnee is just a
[55:41] little old town but is a mile or two
[55:45] from the store and uh we would go to the
[55:50] grocery store and uh we'd do a little
[55:54] shop and come out and Earth gender
[55:56] and I you know I've always puzzled me
[55:59] how did she know where we were but
[56:01] anyway
[56:02] uh anyway she she did but but she did
[56:06] roam around a lot you know and uh we
[56:09] tried to keep her in the fence but
[56:10] somehow she got out and that was before
[56:13] they had these Invisible Fences and all
[56:15] of that you know and uh and I I did
[56:18] never just felt that it was right to
[56:21] have a dog on it on a chain you know if
[56:23] I'm on keeping and do that put him in a
[56:26] zoo then but so I
[56:29] uh he got out and sure enough we we
[56:32] didn't she didn't show up for a few days
[56:34] and so we started looking around for
[56:37] ginger you know and and uh so we called
[56:41] the dog pound and sure enough they got
[56:43] her you know and uh so I I told my wife
[56:47] I said now I'm gonna go and I'm gonna go
[56:49] get her dog so now I'm going to go get
[56:52] her so now I'm gonna put myself as a
[56:55] redeemer
[56:56] because I'm going to bring back what was
[56:59] rightfully mine in the first place
[57:02] and so now she didn't have to worry
[57:05] about me bringing all kinds of dogs uh
[57:08] because I've got a specific purpose and
[57:10] that is to go get Ginger now no matter
[57:13] how ugly that dog was I I walk in and
[57:17] and there you know other dogs bigger
[57:20] badder you know uh some of them probably
[57:24] a man's dog you know nice German
[57:26] Shepherd or a uh whatever you know and
[57:29] and all that bit and and if you could
[57:32] think just for a minute of Ginger you
[57:34] know here she is a little old
[57:35] short-legged dog long Corgi you know so
[57:39] and uh but but if she she might have it
[57:43] just just thinking of for a moment she
[57:45] might have had a little complexes man
[57:46] what if he sees all these other dogs you
[57:50] know and he's gonna forget me you know
[57:51] what if they distract his attention and
[57:54] here I am just you know my bark ain't
[57:57] even as loud as these other dogs and I'm
[57:59] gonna try to grab her you know and it
[58:01] doesn't surprise that's what these other
[58:03] dogs are doing and and all these things
[58:05] see but she didn't have to worry about
[58:07] it it wasn't competition
[58:09] I came to redeem
[58:12] she was mine in the first place so it
[58:15] didn't matter about everything else I
[58:17] didn't come to shop
[58:18] I come to redeem
[58:21] I didn't come to replace
[58:23] I come to redeem
[58:25] right
[58:26] so a lot of times you know you you might
[58:30] break a picture or a plate or whatever
[58:32] well you say well I'm gonna go get me
[58:35] another one well that's fine but that's
[58:37] not redeeming that's only replacing
[58:40] and and uh uh you can even you can even
[58:43] replace the one that looks just exactly
[58:47] like the one that broke but it's still
[58:49] not Redemption that's just replacing and
[58:53] so God did not come to shop
[58:55] he didn't like we go to Walmart or go to
[58:58] Krogers or whatever to shop he didn't
[59:00] come to shop he did not come to this
[59:03] world to do any shopping the Bible says
[59:06] the foundation of God's standards sure
[59:09] the Lord knoweth them that are his
[59:11] so he come to redeem so you cannot be
[59:15] replaced he come to be your Redeemer
[59:19] no matter how low you are no matter how
[59:22] rotten you were no matter how deep in
[59:25] scum and and even in the in the in
[59:29] whatever you you chief of Sinners and
[59:31] and all of these things and the world
[59:34] kind of considered you a reject and
[59:36] maybe there's more talented people more
[59:38] better speakers more better this more
[59:41] better that but it didn't matter God
[59:43] come to redeem and so that's what
[59:46] Redemption is is to bring back that
[59:49] which had fallen in the beginning ain't
[59:52] that right so then we we find that the
[59:56] original condition of the believer is
[59:59] not what he was at Birth
[1:00:02] a man for as we've said so many times
[1:00:05] that we were all born in sin and shaping
[1:00:08] in iniquity uh conceived in sin so that
[1:00:13] wasn't your original condition uh as
[1:00:16] much as maybe a cutie pie you were and
[1:00:18] people pinched your cheeks and and you
[1:00:20] look so innocent and and Google you
[1:00:24] ain't total lie yet and all that but
[1:00:25] that's not your original condition so
[1:00:28] when he come to redeem he didn't bring
[1:00:30] you back as you were as a baby thank God
[1:00:33] for that right amen uh uh but but uh uh
[1:00:37] your original condition is what you were
[1:00:40] in God's mind before the foundation of
[1:00:43] the world
[1:00:44] a couple Sundays ago we talked of how
[1:00:47] that God uh wrote a select number of
[1:00:51] names on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:00:54] the foundation of the world
[1:00:56] and these names represent people uh uh
[1:01:01] who are the elect this is what the Bible
[1:01:03] would call them is the elect of God we
[1:01:07] also know that they they are the
[1:01:09] children of God these elect
[1:01:11] uh uh precious uh Peter would call them
[1:01:14] elect precious but uh uh uh the these
[1:01:20] these names this elect makes up the
[1:01:23] children of God which make up the Bride
[1:01:27] of Jesus Christ
[1:01:28] and and so we we look uh uh these are
[1:01:32] the ones that the Apostle Paul referred
[1:01:36] to when he uh uh said in Romans the 8th
[1:01:40] chapter and 29th verse for whom he did
[1:01:43] for no them that elect that he foreknew
[1:01:47] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:01:51] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:01:54] the firstborn among many Brethren whom
[1:01:57] are more over whom and and we know what
[1:02:00] that whom is that's them names that were
[1:02:03] written in the Lamb's Book of Life the
[1:02:05] elect the bride of Christ the children
[1:02:07] of God children of light uh for whom he
[1:02:11] did predestinate them he also called and
[1:02:15] all these words are past tense he did
[1:02:17] predestinate past tense then he called
[1:02:20] not calling called past tense and
[1:02:25] Justified and whom he them he all so
[1:02:29] glorified ain't that right so so it's
[1:02:33] already done he predestinated he called
[1:02:36] he justified and he glorified past tense
[1:02:40] when does he do that before the
[1:02:42] foundation of the world not when you
[1:02:45] come to an altar and gave your heart to
[1:02:47] the Lord ain't that right now and and so
[1:02:50] uh uh there uh now now the prophet would
[1:02:54] tell us the power that God had promised
[1:02:57] and ordained you and called you before
[1:03:00] the foundation of the world and put your
[1:03:04] name in his book you had nothing to do
[1:03:09] with it God did it aren't you glad for
[1:03:12] that can you say that with me God did it
[1:03:15] God did it amen you had nothing to do
[1:03:18] with it see in another place he says God
[1:03:21] before there was a world had you in mind
[1:03:25] he had a church in mind ain't that right
[1:03:29] and that church is made up of a group of
[1:03:32] people that have their names written in
[1:03:35] the Lamb's Book of Life Now John we know
[1:03:39] rights of another group of people
[1:03:41] they're in Revelations 13 4 and 8 but
[1:03:46] whose names were not written in the
[1:03:49] Lamb's Book of Life and he says this and
[1:03:52] they worshiped the dragon which is uh uh
[1:03:57] Satan and which gave power unto the
[1:04:00] Beast and they worshiped the Beast
[1:04:02] saying who is like unto the Beast who is
[1:04:05] able to make war with him ain't that
[1:04:07] right and then the eighth verse and all
[1:04:10] that dwell upon the Earth shall worship
[1:04:14] Him
[1:04:15] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:04:19] of Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:04:22] foundation of the world ain't that right
[1:04:25] so so there there's uh uh that that
[1:04:29] select group that have their names
[1:04:32] written in the Lamb's Book of Life a man
[1:04:35] that that God come to redeem and and
[1:04:39] these others that have knocked their
[1:04:41] names written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:43] uh are going to worship the Beast amen
[1:04:47] and uh uh the dragon and so uh those who
[1:04:52] have their names written in the Lamb's
[1:04:56] Book of Life is the the main focus of
[1:05:00] God God's main focus can you say that
[1:05:03] with me God's main focus are those who
[1:05:07] have their names written in the Lamb's
[1:05:09] Book of Life Now there will be others
[1:05:12] make it to heaven right we know that
[1:05:14] there's going to be those that going to
[1:05:16] be friends of the Bride Matthew 25 talks
[1:05:19] about it where Jesus will come to tell
[1:05:23] you know say to them you know when I was
[1:05:25] in prison you visited me when I was
[1:05:27] naked you clothed me when I was hungry
[1:05:29] you fed me and thirsty you gave me what
[1:05:32] drink and they said when did we do this
[1:05:34] and he said when you did it unto the
[1:05:37] least of these my brethren you did it
[1:05:39] unto me ain't that right so there will
[1:05:42] be those that will make it then then I
[1:05:44] believe in Matthew 25 as well it talks
[1:05:47] about the the wise versions which which
[1:05:49] is the bride of Christ that's got oil in
[1:05:52] their lamps these are the ones that have
[1:05:53] their name written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:05:55] Life and then there are the foolish
[1:05:58] virgins ain't that right amen and and
[1:06:01] the the prophet talked and talked about
[1:06:04] it like a woman you know she's got a
[1:06:06] material out there but she wants to make
[1:06:09] a dress so she gets her pattern and She
[1:06:11] lays it all the way she wants it see and
[1:06:13] then she begins to cut that dress out
[1:06:15] well it's all the dress right it's all
[1:06:18] part of the material see uh uh the the
[1:06:21] foolish virgin and the wise virgin
[1:06:23] they're all virgins that one's wise and
[1:06:26] one's foolish ain't that right but see
[1:06:28] the prophet says see all of this other
[1:06:31] is material but she's already cut her
[1:06:34] pattern out and she lays the rest of the
[1:06:37] material aside for something else later
[1:06:39] on ain't that right amen but right now
[1:06:43] she's working with the pattern that
[1:06:45] she's got elected out she's cut out see
[1:06:47] and so that's the way God is his main
[1:06:50] focus is upon his people whose names he
[1:06:54] wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life they
[1:06:57] are his elect they are his children he
[1:07:01] is Offspring ain't that right and so uh
[1:07:04] they are what the prophet would call the
[1:07:07] Eternal thoughts of God Amen the Eternal
[1:07:11] thoughts of God you see God is eternal
[1:07:14] and and his thoughts are Eternal
[1:07:18] therefore if you were in God's thinking
[1:07:21] from the foundation of the world then
[1:07:24] you were with him then
[1:07:27] Eternal in his mind ain't that right
[1:07:30] Eternal in his mind God God's Eternal
[1:07:33] and everything about him is eternal
[1:07:36] Eternal quality God cannot change he
[1:07:39] cannot have a new thought about anything
[1:07:42] for his thoughts are Eternal so you
[1:07:46] can't change anything about about if God
[1:07:49] called you you can't change it
[1:07:51] ain't that right
[1:07:53] so uh uh here the the the prophet would
[1:07:58] tell us God is infinite in his ability
[1:08:01] so therefore he as God must be
[1:08:05] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[1:08:09] is not now learning or nor is he taking
[1:08:13] counsel with uh even with himself nor is
[1:08:17] he at any time adding to his knowledge
[1:08:20] if he can add to his knowledge then he
[1:08:23] is not omniscient see the best we could
[1:08:26] say that uh is that sometime he will be
[1:08:29] see but that is not scriptural he is
[1:08:33] everybody say he is
[1:08:35] omniscient see he has never had a new
[1:08:39] thought about anything because all his
[1:08:43] thoughts he has always had and always
[1:08:46] will have and knows the end from the
[1:08:50] beginning because he is God so that us
[1:08:54] the thoughts of God are Eternal and they
[1:08:58] are real they are not simply like a man
[1:09:02] with the blueprint he has drawn up and
[1:09:05] which one day will be translated into
[1:09:09] substance and form no that's not God's
[1:09:12] thoughts see notice but they are already
[1:09:15] real can you say Amen they are already
[1:09:18] real and eternal and part of God so
[1:09:23] that's God's thoughts they are real
[1:09:25] they're more real than you sitting here
[1:09:27] right now they're more real than you uh
[1:09:30] being a sinner that God's thoughts are
[1:09:33] more real than anything you say well
[1:09:36] I've got mistakes but his thoughts are
[1:09:37] more real than your mistakes well you
[1:09:39] say well I got issues well his his
[1:09:41] thoughts are more real than your issues
[1:09:43] can you say amen amen we're living in a
[1:09:46] in a in a place that is temporary that's
[1:09:48] gonna that's gonna lead that's going to
[1:09:50] vanish that's gonna end but there is an
[1:09:53] eternal power word of God and that
[1:09:55] starts with his thoughts and eternal
[1:09:57] thought of God now notice the thoughts
[1:10:00] of God Eternal Jeremiah 29 11 God speaks
[1:10:05] through that prophet and says I know the
[1:10:07] thoughts that I think towards you well
[1:10:10] what are they Eternal thoughts ain't
[1:10:11] that right saith the Lord thoughts of
[1:10:14] peace and not of evil
[1:10:18] to give you an expected end ain't that
[1:10:21] right so when did all this trans uh uh
[1:10:24] happen in the mind of God in his
[1:10:27] thoughts you realize as I said so many
[1:10:29] times you were holy before you ever
[1:10:31] become Unholy you were saved before you
[1:10:33] ever become unsaved you say well I was a
[1:10:36] born I was born a sinner well we all
[1:10:38] were born a sinner but that's not your
[1:10:40] beginning your beginning was in the mind
[1:10:42] of god of what he thought of you before
[1:10:46] the foundation of the world ain't that
[1:10:48] right well it's true a man's seat so
[1:10:51] these are Eternal thoughts and and we'll
[1:10:54] set this way you are if I say I am a
[1:10:58] premeditated thought of God not just a
[1:11:02] passing thought not just something that
[1:11:04] just come into your mind it's a
[1:11:06] premeditated thought there's a
[1:11:08] difference in just murder on an instinct
[1:11:10] someone just killed somebody out of
[1:11:12] instinct or out of just out of uh
[1:11:14] spontaneous but then there's those that
[1:11:16] that really paid the crime or should
[1:11:17] good of premeditated they they thought
[1:11:20] this thing out they they done everything
[1:11:23] you know and and and and I mean they
[1:11:25] done it by the book you know and they're
[1:11:27] premeditating it on how they're going to
[1:11:29] do it what weapon they're going to do it
[1:11:30] when they're gonna do it and everything
[1:11:32] ain't that right well if if Satan can do
[1:11:35] that through a man uh with murder and
[1:11:38] whatever else what about God God he's
[1:11:41] been alone he he's
[1:11:43] the prophet said he dwelt alone with his
[1:11:46] thoughts
[1:11:47] his thoughts ain't that right he wasn't
[1:11:50] just sitting up there just dumbfounded
[1:11:51] you know just just with nothing there
[1:11:53] you know some people just sit there and
[1:11:54] just with nothing you know and he's like
[1:11:56] you know well that wasn't God he was
[1:11:59] dwelling with his thoughts and they were
[1:12:02] premeditated thoughts ain't that right
[1:12:05] well premeditated it it it it it uh uh
[1:12:09] if I can get my uh uh screen to work
[1:12:11] here uh it says characterized by fully
[1:12:16] conscious this is what premeditated
[1:12:18] means fully conscience willful intent
[1:12:23] and a measure of forethought and
[1:12:26] planning ain't that right so the prophet
[1:12:29] would call it premeditated thoughts God
[1:12:32] was fully conscience
[1:12:36] when he thought of you he was fully
[1:12:38] aware
[1:12:40] when he began to plan your life he was
[1:12:42] fully conscious and he thought and he
[1:12:46] planned with intent he planned with
[1:12:48] purpose he not accidental there's
[1:12:50] nothing accidental with God
[1:12:52] ain't that right see so characterized by
[1:12:55] fully conscience willful intent and a
[1:12:59] measure of forefoot thought and planning
[1:13:02] so Ephesians 1 4 Paul would tell us
[1:13:06] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:13:10] before the foundation of the world that
[1:13:14] we should be holy everybody say I should
[1:13:16] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:13:20] love when did that start in his mind can
[1:13:25] you say Amen having predestinated us
[1:13:28] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:13:31] Christ according to or to himself
[1:13:33] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:13:36] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:13:39] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:13:43] in the Beloved
[1:13:45] man that's awesome in whom we have
[1:13:49] Redemption
[1:13:51] through his blood ain't that right amen
[1:13:54] see the Forgiveness of sins according to
[1:13:58] the riches of his grace so when did he
[1:14:02] make us accepted in the Beloved
[1:14:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:09] not when you got gave got gave your
[1:14:11] heart to the Lord not not even when when
[1:14:14] when Christ died at Calvary you was
[1:14:17] accepted in the Beloved in the beginning
[1:14:20] before the world began amen when did we
[1:14:24] have Redemption through his blood
[1:14:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:30] you say well I know you know people get
[1:14:33] smart and they say well yeah but but the
[1:14:36] blood wasn't shed until this but the
[1:14:38] Bible says that the lamb was slain
[1:14:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:42] so God took care of everything before
[1:14:44] the foundation of the world
[1:14:46] ain't that right see when did we have
[1:14:49] the Forgiveness of sins
[1:14:51] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:54] it was all in God's plan it was a
[1:14:58] Redemptive plan Plan of Redemption see
[1:15:02] so is the premeditated thoughts of God
[1:15:05] and they are Eternal and they are real
[1:15:11] yeah
[1:15:12] God God had always had his thoughts for
[1:15:16] Adam
[1:15:17] but yet his thoughts wasn't expressed
[1:15:23] because Adam wasn't created
[1:15:27] that right God dwelt Alone with his
[1:15:30] thoughts so here we we look in Psalms
[1:15:34] 139 15 and 16 it gives us a little idea
[1:15:38] of this but it says my substance was not
[1:15:42] hit from thee when I was made in secret
[1:15:45] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[1:15:47] parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my
[1:15:51] substance yet being unperfect and in thy
[1:15:56] book all my members were written which
[1:16:00] in continuance were fashioned when as
[1:16:03] yet there was none of them
[1:16:06] ain't that right so God did not just
[1:16:09] think of you when you happen to be born
[1:16:13] that he already had you in his mind
[1:16:19] that elect yes sir so this scripture
[1:16:22] gives us the knowledge that the thought
[1:16:25] the thought of us was there in his mind
[1:16:31] that thought was eternal
[1:16:34] and had to be expressed
[1:16:37] it had to be expressed
[1:16:40] it couldn't just remain as a thought it
[1:16:43] had to be expressed that's why there is
[1:16:46] no devil big enough to hold you back
[1:16:50] there's no sin great enough to keep a
[1:16:53] child uh down in in the pits and the the
[1:16:59] filth amen because there's an assault
[1:17:02] and it's an eternal thought and that
[1:17:05] thought had to be expressed
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:09] thought
[1:17:11] so when Adam was formed out of the earth
[1:17:15] and his spiritual being
[1:17:17] created by God then Adam
[1:17:20] uh uh see was was God's thought
[1:17:25] expressed and those thoughts were
[1:17:28] manifested see so so Adam became not it
[1:17:32] wasn't just a thought now but he become
[1:17:35] a manifestation or expression of God's
[1:17:40] thoughts ain't that right and and we
[1:17:42] find that Moses Jeremiah David Daniel
[1:17:46] um uh all the all of them uh John the
[1:17:49] Baptist they were God's Eternal thoughts
[1:17:52] expressed in in its season ain't that
[1:17:56] right see so by God's thoughts already
[1:17:59] having that that's why he could tell he
[1:18:02] foretolded John the Baptist uh uh uh uh
[1:18:06] before way before he came do you realize
[1:18:09] that the Bible foretells of a bride of
[1:18:11] you in this age there's more scriptures
[1:18:14] that speak of this age than ever than
[1:18:17] any other age but God could do it
[1:18:19] because they're Eternal thoughts and
[1:18:21] they had to be expressed ain't that
[1:18:24] right see so we are any Eternal thought
[1:18:27] a man as well for we were chosen in him
[1:18:30] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:18:33] world that means the prophet says that
[1:18:36] we were right there with him with him in
[1:18:40] the mind and thoughts of God before the
[1:18:43] foundation of the world ain't that right
[1:18:45] when when the prophets come and they
[1:18:48] spoke of Messiah to come and and all
[1:18:51] these they God already had Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] in mind it wasn't just a guesswork well
[1:18:58] now let's see you know who's going to be
[1:19:00] the better pick when that time comes I I
[1:19:03] don't know we'll just have to wait and
[1:19:04] see no Jesus Christ was what God had in
[1:19:08] his thoughts and then when he come to
[1:19:10] this earth he become the expression
[1:19:12] ain't that right amen that's true he was
[1:19:16] the word made flesh and so so then so so
[1:19:20] brother Brown says see that that means
[1:19:23] that we were right there with him Christ
[1:19:26] in the mind and thoughts of God before
[1:19:28] the foundation World notice that gives
[1:19:31] an eternal quality to the elect
[1:19:35] you can't get away from that it's what
[1:19:38] he says for people that don't believe in
[1:19:40] the predestination and the the well you
[1:19:42] take the power of God away from him you
[1:19:45] take sovereignty of God away you you
[1:19:47] diminish God in in such a low form to
[1:19:50] say that he can't predestinate and he
[1:19:52] can't he can't control I don't care how
[1:19:55] bad this world gets there's not one
[1:19:57] elect that's going to be lost for Jesus
[1:20:00] said all that the father hath given me
[1:20:01] or will come to me and I will not lose
[1:20:04] one of them for this is the Father's
[1:20:07] will can you say amen amen says so now
[1:20:10] again uh uh Revelations 13 8 tells us
[1:20:14] that the lamb was slain before the
[1:20:17] foundation of the world he was a
[1:20:21] premeditated thought of God but it never
[1:20:25] happened until 4 000 years later ain't
[1:20:29] that right it took 4 000 years for that
[1:20:34] thought of God to become materialized or
[1:20:38] expressed amen but Jesus wasn't there by
[1:20:41] accident he knew where he was from the
[1:20:44] beginning and neither is God's elect
[1:20:46] today
[1:20:48] so the prophet says but when but God
[1:20:52] when he spoke it he had to do it can you
[1:20:55] say that with me he had to do it when
[1:20:57] God spoke it he had to do it because he
[1:21:00] has to keep his word
[1:21:02] and the same time that the lamb uh uh uh
[1:21:06] was wrote down he said you were wrote
[1:21:09] down with him
[1:21:11] amen the same time at the Lamb's name
[1:21:14] was written down we're going to say it
[1:21:15] that way or the lamb was slain before
[1:21:18] the foundation of the world a man you
[1:21:20] were written with him you were
[1:21:23] identified with him ain't that right
[1:21:25] that's why God can't you weren't
[1:21:26] identified in your first birth you you
[1:21:29] come as a sinner but that's not what
[1:21:31] your identification you come trapped in
[1:21:34] sin but that's just not your dead
[1:21:36] identification you were identified
[1:21:38] before the foundation of the world with
[1:21:40] your lamb that God had provided for you
[1:21:45] see our names were written in the Lamb's
[1:21:48] Book of Life not the night we come to
[1:21:50] Christ
[1:21:51] but before the foundation of the world
[1:21:53] ain't that right so when the lamb was
[1:21:57] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:21:59] in the mind of God our names was
[1:22:03] associated with him amen see and notice
[1:22:07] what the prophet said Christ died to
[1:22:10] save those who God by foreknowledge
[1:22:13] elected to meet him Yonder without spot
[1:22:16] or wrinkle you realize that that the
[1:22:19] Bible already speaks of you that says
[1:22:21] there would be a bride without spot
[1:22:23] wrinkle or a blemish amen it's it's
[1:22:26] already done it's already settled it's
[1:22:28] it's it's in God's mind it's it's
[1:22:30] already done it's and they're real more
[1:22:33] real than you're sitting here so don't
[1:22:34] don't try to bring up your faults before
[1:22:36] God get them under the blood of course
[1:22:38] amen but but don't try to bring up all
[1:22:41] your excuses as to why you can't do
[1:22:43] things amen I'm telling you God's
[1:22:46] already already taken care of it it's
[1:22:49] already written it's already been spoke
[1:22:52] now you're here expressing it
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:58] if God
[1:23:00] if Prophet says if God predestinate us
[1:23:03] before the foundation of the world and
[1:23:04] knew every one of us by name before the
[1:23:07] foundation world and he elected us to
[1:23:09] eternal life and sent Jesus to redeem us
[1:23:13] that 6 000 years ago he saw us
[1:23:18] that we might appear uh to his Praises
[1:23:22] in glory notice the question after that
[1:23:25] how can you ever be lost
[1:23:31] ain't that right
[1:23:33] now again
[1:23:36] brother Branham says well one might say
[1:23:39] well then that means I can do anything I
[1:23:41] want to do then that's Baptist Doctrine
[1:23:44] that's that's what they think that you
[1:23:45] can do once they've always saved and we
[1:23:48] believe that to an extent but you gotta
[1:23:49] get safe first
[1:23:51] God get sealed with the Holy Ghost first
[1:23:55] a man see and then when you get the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost it takes all that desire for sin
[1:23:59] out you used to want to cuss you don't
[1:24:02] cuss no more you used to want to party
[1:24:04] don't want to don't want to party no
[1:24:06] more there's your Associates change
[1:24:08] everything about you changes and the
[1:24:11] more you grow and the more you mature in
[1:24:13] Christ you're going to find things start
[1:24:15] with the things just start falling off
[1:24:17] amen if if you say well man I got crave
[1:24:20] for movies and I'll just get in Christ
[1:24:22] and grow in Christ and you'll watch you
[1:24:25] won't want them no more you you won't
[1:24:26] crave it Satan will try to tempt you and
[1:24:28] you just say I don't want that no more I
[1:24:30] just there's just something about it I
[1:24:32] don't want see what is it you're coming
[1:24:33] to an expression of God
[1:24:35] you're you're coming to what he thought
[1:24:37] of you in the beginning ain't that right
[1:24:39] now if that desire keeps remaining there
[1:24:41] and it's just staying there and and
[1:24:43] there's not a change in you then then
[1:24:45] then then I I just have to tell you you
[1:24:47] need the Holy Ghost
[1:24:49] you need the Holy Ghost because you
[1:24:51] cannot have the Holy Ghost and still
[1:24:53] remain in the pig pen
[1:24:54] just can't I I I'm just that's just the
[1:24:58] truth amen uh uh you you can hold on to
[1:25:02] your your Baptist ways your Pentecostal
[1:25:04] ways and and and your charismatic ways
[1:25:07] or whatever amen but but when when it
[1:25:09] comes to Redemption you you got to go
[1:25:11] back to what God called you to be in the
[1:25:13] first place people that says well I got
[1:25:15] the Holy Ghost I'm redeemed and don't go
[1:25:16] like church don't want to go to church
[1:25:18] and all that something wrong with that
[1:25:20] something wrong with that relationship
[1:25:22] ain't that right and it's just just
[1:25:24] going to be honest with you it's just
[1:25:25] wrong people that said well I got the
[1:25:28] Holy Ghost blessed God and but you
[1:25:29] desire to drink and you want to go out
[1:25:31] there but I can't do it because I'm a
[1:25:33] Christian something wrong with your
[1:25:34] experience we don't serve God because
[1:25:36] we're afraid to go to hell
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:39] we're serving God because he came and
[1:25:42] redeemed us
[1:25:44] he come to redeem us
[1:25:46] hey man it's true see so so then six
[1:25:51] thousand years ago before the foundation
[1:25:53] of the world he saw us aren't you glad
[1:25:55] for that he saw us then why would it
[1:25:58] bother people now think of that why
[1:26:00] would it bother people when a prophet in
[1:26:03] this day went beyond the curtain of time
[1:26:05] and and he and he's up there and he sees
[1:26:08] the people out there uh in another land
[1:26:11] in another dimension and and and then he
[1:26:14] comes back and tells tells us I saw I
[1:26:17] saw you there I saw you there well what
[1:26:21] was it was it a man just trying to dream
[1:26:23] something up and give us a little hope
[1:26:25] no it's a reality it's reality
[1:26:30] can you say man now the Jesus came to
[1:26:34] redeem those that were in the book
[1:26:37] he come to redeem now Revelations 5
[1:26:40] talks about how the lamb came and took
[1:26:43] the book from him that set upon the
[1:26:45] throne Revelations 5 and 1 starting
[1:26:48] there and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:26:51] that said on the throne a book written
[1:26:53] within and on the back side sealed with
[1:26:56] Seven Seals now
[1:26:59] I'll say it this way that's your Lamb's
[1:27:01] Book of Life
[1:27:03] amen the book has been opened ain't that
[1:27:05] right because John says I shouted all in
[1:27:09] heaven heard me all in the Earth all in
[1:27:10] the sea and and everybody All Creatures
[1:27:13] heard me shouting amen glory and
[1:27:16] Hallelujah and honor and the prophet
[1:27:18] said he must have saw his name in the
[1:27:19] book amen so we're going to call it
[1:27:23] Lamb's Book of Life that was opened up
[1:27:27] can you say man that's right see and and
[1:27:30] he says I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:27:32] with the loud voice who is worthy to
[1:27:34] open the book and to loose the seals
[1:27:36] thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:27:39] neither under the Earth was able to open
[1:27:42] the book neither to look thereupon and I
[1:27:45] wept I went much because no man was
[1:27:48] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:27:50] book neither to look there upon and one
[1:27:52] of the elders saith unto me wheat not
[1:27:56] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:27:58] the root of David hath prevailed there
[1:28:01] there was a wrestling there there was a
[1:28:04] fight there was a struggle right Satan
[1:28:06] was claiming your soul Satan was saying
[1:28:08] here no they're damned they're doomed I
[1:28:10] got him I got him in a stronghold that
[1:28:13] the lamb prevailed and he opened the
[1:28:15] book and he says no Satan they're mine
[1:28:18] they're an eternal thought of mine
[1:28:20] before the foundation of the world ain't
[1:28:22] that right you can't have them you got
[1:28:25] to break your hold and and that's when
[1:28:26] we find out that there is an enforcer
[1:28:29] called the Holy Ghost a man that if he
[1:28:31] won't if that devil won't get out of
[1:28:33] your home he won't get out of your life
[1:28:35] and he's squatting on your property
[1:28:37] you've got every right go to the Holy
[1:28:39] Ghost go to the one that'll enforce it
[1:28:41] and he'll make him give it up he'll make
[1:28:44] him give give all of that up why the
[1:28:46] book has been opened you see your name
[1:28:49] in the book
[1:28:51] you're not guessing if you're going to
[1:28:53] make it you know you're going to make it
[1:28:55] you're not guessing wondering if you're
[1:28:57] safe you know you're saved ain't that
[1:29:00] right amen I I know Satan fights us on
[1:29:03] these things as you know and you know
[1:29:06] hey I'm I'm one of them that do fight in
[1:29:09] in my mind and things like that I think
[1:29:11] we we well we might all I guess but but
[1:29:13] I am one of them that Satan tries to
[1:29:15] tell me a lot of stuff tell me you cross
[1:29:17] the line can you imagine you crossed the
[1:29:20] line amen there's no more grace for you
[1:29:22] and I fight that just as well amen well
[1:29:25] you'll never overcome you'll never do
[1:29:26] this you'll never do that you're going
[1:29:28] to fall short of of these things and
[1:29:31] might as well give up and and there
[1:29:33] ain't no more hope and and I mean just
[1:29:35] you know there's battles there that we
[1:29:37] all face amen but I look back and I say
[1:29:40] no no no this message means more than
[1:29:42] just a man preaching to me I see my name
[1:29:45] in a book I see that every promise in
[1:29:48] this book is mine and I'm going to claim
[1:29:51] it let Satan get away from me healing
[1:29:54] his mind salvation is mine Redemption is
[1:29:56] mine Deliverance is mine the Rapture is
[1:29:59] mine the body changes mind amen
[1:30:01] everything that God promised me is mine
[1:30:04] can you say Amen I'm an heir of every
[1:30:07] promise that God has made me and you
[1:30:10] know the prophet also said I was reading
[1:30:11] a quote to the church uh uh down there
[1:30:13] last week brother Brown said if you're a
[1:30:15] Son of God then you're an heir to
[1:30:17] everything that God is that God is not
[1:30:20] that God has you're an heir to
[1:30:23] everything that God is can you say Amen
[1:30:27] Hallelujah that's right see so the the
[1:30:31] book has been opened the lamb has
[1:30:33] prevailed now just for simple terms this
[1:30:37] book
[1:30:38] this Bible
[1:30:40] now this this may not have your name
[1:30:43] written on it
[1:30:44] where you can plainly see it
[1:30:47] but see it talks about you
[1:30:50] and this book has been sealed up
[1:30:52] before the foundation of the world and
[1:30:55] people have guessed at it teachers have
[1:30:57] probed at it trying to understand this
[1:30:59] book that has never been able to
[1:31:01] understand amen the contents of the book
[1:31:05] it took the lamp to open the book in
[1:31:10] other words to open our understanding
[1:31:14] that we're not reading the Bible we're
[1:31:16] not teaching the Bible we're not
[1:31:17] preaching and behind the pulpit today a
[1:31:20] man without understanding of what this
[1:31:22] really says we're not preaching
[1:31:24] according to man's interpretation a
[1:31:26] man's ideologies and man's this and
[1:31:28] man's that no no no we are seeing the
[1:31:31] book for what it really is and it's
[1:31:35] calling us and it's telling us every
[1:31:38] promise in this Bible is yours
[1:31:42] it's a love letter
[1:31:45] and you say man
[1:31:48] so that book again was sealed with Seven
[1:31:51] Seals no one could understand it it was
[1:31:53] a mystery God's plan God's purpose was a
[1:31:57] mystery
[1:31:58] ain't that right
[1:32:01] yeah that's right
[1:32:03] and the lamb came and opened the book
[1:32:07] why why would he open the book so to
[1:32:09] claim all everybody say all
[1:32:12] to claim all that he had redeemed
[1:32:17] that's why he wants you to serve him in
[1:32:20] love
[1:32:21] walk with him love it's a love story
[1:32:25] right
[1:32:26] you talk about coming to the end of the
[1:32:28] Cinderella story they lived happily ever
[1:32:30] after
[1:32:32] buddy this already tells your Victory
[1:32:34] this already tells your end and I'm
[1:32:37] telling you we're going to live happily
[1:32:39] ever after
[1:32:40] he come for you
[1:32:42] he come to claim you it's Redemption
[1:32:45] claim he redeems you at Calvary brother
[1:32:48] Doug he's here to claim you now to let
[1:32:51] you know that you're in the book
[1:32:55] can you say man so it's not living our
[1:32:58] Christian Life worrying about what we
[1:33:00] are worry and worry and Satan tries to
[1:33:02] put that worry and put that fear that
[1:33:04] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:33:06] every fear is of the devil
[1:33:09] fear is of the devil questions are of
[1:33:13] the devil can you say Amen well I wonder
[1:33:16] if God loves me I wonder if I'm really
[1:33:18] going to make a quit thinking them
[1:33:19] things quit let the devil plant them
[1:33:21] things in your mind oh yeah it's just
[1:33:23] you say well I can't help it you know
[1:33:25] and and we've used that illustration so
[1:33:27] many times of of you know you you you
[1:33:30] you you can't keep a bird from flying
[1:33:33] over your head but you could sure keep
[1:33:35] him from building a nest in your hair
[1:33:37] ain't that right and a lot of times you
[1:33:40] can't help thoughts that go in your mind
[1:33:41] but you can sure keep them from being
[1:33:43] rooted in your mind you don't have to
[1:33:45] dwell on that
[1:33:47] ain't that right
[1:33:48] see so so we we find the lamb came and
[1:33:52] opened the book so to claim all that he
[1:33:56] had redeemed
[1:33:59] I'm telling you those that have their
[1:34:01] names on the that's his Focus
[1:34:06] brother Brown said all whose name was
[1:34:09] written on the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:34:12] redeemed
[1:34:14] redeemed
[1:34:15] he says God had to open up those Seven
[1:34:18] Seals not in a denomination he said I've
[1:34:21] always been against it
[1:34:23] that out of denomination he might take a
[1:34:26] bride not a denominational bride
[1:34:30] he couldn't do it it's against his own
[1:34:32] word he opened those seven mysteries in
[1:34:36] there that shows forth brings forth
[1:34:39] those things that's been hid since the
[1:34:42] foundation of the world might be
[1:34:44] revealed in the last days to who the
[1:34:48] sons of God
[1:34:51] the world ain't going to understand they
[1:34:53] ain't want nothing to do with it but
[1:34:55] it's revealed to sons of God that elect
[1:34:58] those who have their names written in
[1:35:01] the book of Lamb's Book of Life ain't
[1:35:03] that right he says now he says see they
[1:35:06] brought that forth now before the people
[1:35:09] and they see it there
[1:35:12] the book has been opened up before the
[1:35:15] people and they see it
[1:35:18] the mysteries of God that's been shut up
[1:35:22] sealed up now has been presented and the
[1:35:26] the people the sons of God see it there
[1:35:29] he says see he says uh he says they
[1:35:31] brought back now before the people that
[1:35:34] they see it there you now he says uh to
[1:35:38] this undenominational bride
[1:35:40] undenominational
[1:35:42] not denominational undenominational he
[1:35:45] said there's your two books one of them
[1:35:47] is the Lamb's Book of Life your name on
[1:35:49] there is predestinated on it can't go
[1:35:53] because you can no more take that away
[1:35:56] than anything Satan can't take that name
[1:35:58] away
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:02] because it was foreordained to be on
[1:36:05] there
[1:36:05] now the regular Book of Life can take
[1:36:08] that off anytime
[1:36:11] and and you know some of you may not
[1:36:13] understand that but that's okay just
[1:36:15] keep that in mind he said see so you
[1:36:19] don't repent he said it's off anyhow
[1:36:21] because you're going to stand judgment
[1:36:23] but the bride everybody say the bride
[1:36:25] the Alexi don't even stand
[1:36:30] the Judgment it goes in the rapture
[1:36:34] is this okay
[1:36:36] it goes in the Rapture now notice we've
[1:36:39] talked about it last time we've spoke on
[1:36:41] this subject is that at the white Throne
[1:36:44] judgment the books
[1:36:46] are going to be opened according to
[1:36:49] Daniel 7 9 and 10.
[1:36:51] and Revelations 20 and 12-13
[1:36:56] the books are going to be open
[1:36:58] but not it at least the way I'm seeing
[1:37:01] it is not the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:37:04] hello
[1:37:05] why because that book is the book of
[1:37:09] redemption and it's already open
[1:37:14] it's already open ain't that right
[1:37:17] you are being judged now
[1:37:21] but you have not just as a sinner
[1:37:24] you have representation
[1:37:28] it's the Lambs
[1:37:30] Book of Life
[1:37:33] it's his life
[1:37:35] that represents you
[1:37:38] can you say Amen so God cannot see you
[1:37:40] as a sinner
[1:37:42] there's a blood that's covering you
[1:37:45] and the life of the Lamb is in you
[1:37:48] you're spotless
[1:37:51] you're free
[1:37:53] your Clans
[1:37:55] can you say Amen because you've got a
[1:37:58] representation
[1:38:00] the lawyer that represented you has now
[1:38:03] come to live in you
[1:38:06] then you say man he not only took your
[1:38:08] place and died for you as the substitute
[1:38:12] so you wouldn't have to die but now he
[1:38:14] come back and lives in you it's Christ
[1:38:17] in you the hope of glory Christ in you
[1:38:20] that lives Christ can you say man
[1:38:23] now the life that I now live
[1:38:25] I live by the faith of the son of God
[1:38:28] I don't live a sinner life brother Brown
[1:38:31] said your old life by the blood of
[1:38:33] Christ your sexual blood has been
[1:38:34] dismissed
[1:38:38] amen
[1:38:39] man that's why you had to be born again
[1:38:41] ain't that right
[1:38:43] you love the Lord
[1:38:45] so that book is the book of redemption
[1:38:47] and it's already open
[1:38:49] notice before the foundation of the
[1:38:51] world God wrote your name in the Lamb's
[1:38:54] Book of Life by his spoken word
[1:38:58] so he's going to deal with all those
[1:39:01] that that that have their name written
[1:39:03] in the book of life but right now he's
[1:39:06] dealing with us
[1:39:08] that elect who has their names written
[1:39:10] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:12] that book is open now
[1:39:15] ain't that right
[1:39:17] so he said see God wrote your name in
[1:39:20] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:22] by his spoken word and sent Christ the
[1:39:26] sacrifice to buy to redeem that same
[1:39:30] group that had wrote that he had wrote
[1:39:34] their names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:35] before the foundation of the world now
[1:39:37] those who he has called he has Justified
[1:39:40] he called them before the foundation of
[1:39:42] the world and those who he called he
[1:39:44] justified and those he have Justified he
[1:39:48] hath already glorified the same God that
[1:39:52] before the foundation of the world
[1:39:53] called your name and wrote it on the
[1:39:55] Lamb's Book of Life but from the
[1:39:57] foundation of the world has already
[1:39:59] everybody say he has already made a
[1:40:03] place for you in glory
[1:40:09] now that ought to just take the pressure
[1:40:11] off
[1:40:14] he's already prepared a place for you in
[1:40:16] glory
[1:40:22] have you ever just gone somewhere and
[1:40:24] you want to get there early some people
[1:40:26] do that here
[1:40:27] church so he can get their favorite seat
[1:40:34] did you go somewhere
[1:40:37] and and if you don't have a ticket with
[1:40:39] with seat numbers
[1:40:41] I I want to get there early
[1:40:44] if I really want to get a good seat
[1:40:47] you know and and you know you hope you
[1:40:51] hope that there's a seat for you now
[1:40:53] there are some times I go to places and
[1:40:55] I don't get the right seat sometimes I'm
[1:40:57] made to sit up front
[1:41:01] you know and
[1:41:05] you know and but but then
[1:41:07] if we're going to go to a you know a
[1:41:09] gospel concert or whatever and you know
[1:41:13] I'll ask and say well do they already
[1:41:16] have our seats assigned yeah ah takes
[1:41:19] the pressure off
[1:41:22] I don't have to block somebody's eyes
[1:41:25] knock them out so I can get their seat
[1:41:26] you know
[1:41:28] it's uh it's it's mine
[1:41:31] it's paid for it
[1:41:34] and have you ever been to a place where
[1:41:36] your seat's been assigned and someone
[1:41:37] sits in your seat
[1:41:40] and you just kindly smile you can smile
[1:41:45] you can actually be friendly at this
[1:41:47] point
[1:41:49] because it's your seat
[1:41:51] so you just say can't you move
[1:41:55] this is my seat or you kind of act dumb
[1:41:57] uh
[1:41:59] I don't know but I think that might be
[1:42:01] my seat I don't know so we're all
[1:42:03] looking you know but you already know
[1:42:04] it's your seat
[1:42:05] because you got the ticket
[1:42:11] well when we go in the Rapture it's not
[1:42:14] going to be a rush to get a seat
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:18] every every every chair has been
[1:42:21] assigned at that wedding supper
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:25] and no one no one can take my place no
[1:42:29] one can take your place
[1:42:31] ain't that right gonna be love and joy
[1:42:34] over there
[1:42:35] because you already got a seat assigned
[1:42:38] and nobody gonna be sitting in that seat
[1:42:40] because he has already prepared a place
[1:42:44] it ain't switching bodies and
[1:42:45] theophanies and all that trying to find
[1:42:47] which one's yours and all that he's
[1:42:49] already got a place prepared
[1:42:51] everything is yours it's designed and he
[1:42:55] just welcomes you says I've been waiting
[1:42:56] on you everything's prepared your seed
[1:42:59] is ready this is ready that's ready I
[1:43:01] prepared it all for you
[1:43:08] he's already prepared a place
[1:43:12] for you in glory
[1:43:14] notice he says and when this Earthly
[1:43:17] Tabernacle be dissolved which Paul says
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:20] we have one already
[1:43:24] can you say that already waiting
[1:43:27] for us in the way he's fashioned there
[1:43:31] he are that's the gospel
[1:43:36] so in another place he says in the last
[1:43:39] days when the Antichrist raised up on
[1:43:42] the scene so close like the real thing
[1:43:44] it would deceive the very elected if it
[1:43:46] was possible
[1:43:48] but then he said again he deceived all
[1:43:51] upon the Earth whose names were not
[1:43:52] written on the Lamb's Book of Life slain
[1:43:54] before the foundation of the world see
[1:43:56] their names were put on The Book of Life
[1:43:58] the book of redemption
[1:44:00] so he's telling us what section of the
[1:44:03] book it is written on
[1:44:05] and Jesus come to redeem those that had
[1:44:08] their names in the book and when that
[1:44:11] last name is redeemed the lamb takes the
[1:44:14] book and walks away that's all
[1:44:16] redemption's over it's closed ain't that
[1:44:20] right
[1:44:21] so see if your name is written on the
[1:44:25] book the Lamb's Book of Life then you
[1:44:29] don't worry about it
[1:44:31] you come to arrest
[1:44:34] ain't that right don't worry about
[1:44:36] anything else brother Branham in
[1:44:38] speaking of the Samaritan woman said she
[1:44:40] was the one she was one that had her
[1:44:43] name there and no matter what kind of a
[1:44:46] state she was in there as soon as that
[1:44:49] true Gospel Light struck that little
[1:44:51] prostitute she recognized it why there
[1:44:55] was something in there to spark it off
[1:44:58] and she recognized it how many is
[1:45:01] recognized
[1:45:02] oh I recognized it I wasn't seeing I was
[1:45:06] this I was that but I recognized it
[1:45:11] now then we find and and we're very
[1:45:13] familiar with this
[1:45:14] bit Revelations 10 and 1.
[1:45:18] it says and I saw another Mighty angel
[1:45:22] uh come down
[1:45:24] I don't know if that's this mic or what
[1:45:29] that worked
[1:45:32] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:45:34] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[1:45:37] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:45:40] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:45:44] pillars of Fire
[1:45:45] and he had in his hand a little closed
[1:45:49] book
[1:45:50] a little open book
[1:45:52] why this is the in the fifth chapter of
[1:45:55] Revelations the lamb come to open it now
[1:45:58] here he is with the with the book in his
[1:46:00] hand and it's open and he said his right
[1:46:03] foot upon the Earth his left foot up on
[1:46:05] on the sea and cried with a loud voice
[1:46:08] as when a lion roared and when he had
[1:46:10] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:46:12] voices see now notice brother Branham
[1:46:15] says if now if you were in the
[1:46:18] quickening at his beginning that's what
[1:46:21] he come to redeem and your name was put
[1:46:23] on the Lamb's Book of Life in his
[1:46:25] thinking at the beginning and he come to
[1:46:28] redeem all names that's in that book no
[1:46:33] more not one more just what was in there
[1:46:37] and when the last name is redeemed he
[1:46:40] takes his book and he claims what he has
[1:46:43] redeemed
[1:46:45] then you say man
[1:46:46] now I know uh uh this this quote might
[1:46:51] be a little lengthy but I want to read
[1:46:52] it but it says now now the forfeited
[1:46:56] title deed is now in the hands of the
[1:46:58] original owner almighty God the title
[1:47:00] deed to the Earth
[1:47:02] to eternal life and when Adam forfeited
[1:47:05] it then Satan's dirty hands could not
[1:47:07] take it so it went back to its original
[1:47:09] owner God himself
[1:47:12] we're going to find out he says see
[1:47:14] there he sits on the throne with it in
[1:47:16] his hand the title deed see so oh that
[1:47:19] makes me feel religious friends the
[1:47:21] title deed to eternal life the abstract
[1:47:24] title deed to eternal life when Adam
[1:47:26] forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith
[1:47:29] and went back to the hands it went back
[1:47:32] to the hands of the owner almighty God
[1:47:33] what a great thing all right what's it
[1:47:36] doing it's in the hands of God waiting
[1:47:38] for Redemption claims he made a way of
[1:47:41] redemption he made a way back and
[1:47:43] someday the Redeemer is to take it back
[1:47:46] you see what we're getting to now watch
[1:47:48] he said we'll watch this fella setting
[1:47:50] up on the throne waiting for Redemption
[1:47:51] claims what is the book of redemption
[1:47:54] it's the title lead
[1:47:57] it's the abstract titled deed
[1:48:00] and you say man you say abstract what
[1:48:03] does abstract means it means it's
[1:48:06] searched all the way back to its
[1:48:07] beginning
[1:48:08] see Satan has tried to accuse us Satan
[1:48:11] he's the accuser of the brother and
[1:48:12] that's what the Bible says but the
[1:48:14] abstract has been given back
[1:48:18] there's no accusation
[1:48:20] what what has been said is we've been
[1:48:22] Justified as though we've never done it
[1:48:24] in the first place
[1:48:25] ain't that right so see he says it
[1:48:28] searched all the way back like that
[1:48:30] little drop of ink this morning when it
[1:48:32] struck that bleach it went all the way
[1:48:34] back and when sin has been confessed and
[1:48:37] fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:48:39] gives an abstract right straight back to
[1:48:41] the Creator again and you become a Son
[1:48:43] of God Abstract title deed is held in
[1:48:46] the hand of Almighty it's Redemption
[1:48:48] everybody say it's Redemption means all
[1:48:51] legal possession to all that was lost by
[1:48:54] Adam and Eve he said oh my what that
[1:48:57] ought to do to a born-again Christian
[1:48:58] it's legal possession to the abstract
[1:49:01] titled deed of eternal life means that
[1:49:03] you possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:49:06] lost you possess it
[1:49:09] can you say man so so if I can set this
[1:49:12] way
[1:49:13] don't worry about being lost
[1:49:16] now you when I'm saying that now they've
[1:49:19] asked Peter what do we what must we do
[1:49:21] to be saved and he gives the he gives
[1:49:23] the formula repent be baptized in the
[1:49:25] name of Jesus Christ every one of you
[1:49:27] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:49:29] receive the Holy Ghost ain't that right
[1:49:31] these three things when you get the Holy
[1:49:33] Ghost you're sealed the Paul says to the
[1:49:35] day of your Redemption ain't that right
[1:49:38] so don't live your Christian Life
[1:49:42] being tossed to and fro you don't have
[1:49:44] to worry about a thing it's yours now
[1:49:46] look to claim claim everything that God
[1:49:49] has given you in this age can you say
[1:49:52] man that's right see because if your
[1:49:54] name is there it can never be removed
[1:49:57] and and uh uh I'll tell you what is
[1:50:01] removed
[1:50:02] it's your transgressions
[1:50:06] what is removed is not your name
[1:50:09] it's your transgressions
[1:50:12] can you say man notice Psalms 103 and 10
[1:50:16] he has not dealt with us after our sins
[1:50:18] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:50:21] iniquities for as high as for as the
[1:50:24] heaven is high above the earth now go
[1:50:26] measure the how high the heaven is on
[1:50:28] the Earth
[1:50:29] so great is his Mercy toward them that
[1:50:31] fear him as far as the East is from the
[1:50:34] West so far has he removed our
[1:50:37] transgressions from us
[1:50:39] oh do you love him so he did not just
[1:50:41] just separate you from your
[1:50:43] transgressions and your transgressions
[1:50:45] is right here huh you know with you all
[1:50:47] your life he removed them from you as
[1:50:50] far as the East is from the West
[1:50:54] amen I just love God
[1:50:57] loving so the prophet says who could
[1:51:00] tell God how to make things in the
[1:51:02] beginning when there was just him alone
[1:51:07] and and if we have eternal life there's
[1:51:09] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:51:11] God so if we have eternal life we were
[1:51:13] with God right then a part of God we
[1:51:16] were his attributes we are now his
[1:51:19] attribute and because in the beginning
[1:51:21] was the word and a word is a thought
[1:51:24] expressed so we were his thoughts then
[1:51:28] expressed into word and become what we
[1:51:31] are that's the reason our names maybe
[1:51:33] not what we have now but our names were
[1:51:36] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:51:37] the foundation of the world and if it
[1:51:40] wasn't there then it'll never be now
[1:51:43] and you say man and Jesus come to redeem
[1:51:46] all those whose names are were on that
[1:51:48] book
[1:51:49] now we we could go on but here
[1:51:52] the whole again the whole Plan of
[1:51:54] Redemption
[1:51:56] is for those names that God wrote before
[1:51:58] the foundation of the world
[1:52:00] and brother Brandon said this it was
[1:52:02] God's purpose can you say that with me
[1:52:04] it was God's purpose
[1:52:06] to bring forth a people like unto
[1:52:09] himself that would be a word bride
[1:52:12] that's his purpose
[1:52:14] she was chosen before the foundation of
[1:52:16] the world in him
[1:52:19] I'm going to change microphones see if
[1:52:27] she was chosen before the foundation of
[1:52:30] the world in him
[1:52:33] she was foreknown and beloved before she
[1:52:36] was ever brought forth during the ages
[1:52:40] upon the Earth
[1:52:41] she was Redeemed by his blood
[1:52:44] and can never come into condemnation
[1:52:48] she can never be in the Judgment because
[1:52:51] sin cannot be imputed to her
[1:52:57] uh
[1:52:58] what a blessing it is to be his elect
[1:53:03] Romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom
[1:53:06] the Lord will not impute sin
[1:53:08] but indeed she shall be with him in his
[1:53:11] throne of judgment judging the world and
[1:53:13] even angels
[1:53:15] her name each of her members was written
[1:53:18] in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:53:20] before the foundation of the world can
[1:53:22] you say man
[1:53:24] now I'm I'm getting somewhere I've been
[1:53:26] laying this thing to get somewhere here
[1:53:29] but our name as the prophet said was
[1:53:31] there by the spoken word of God
[1:53:34] and the word is is what a thought
[1:53:37] expressed it enters as a thought and
[1:53:40] then it becomes a word amen uh uh can't
[1:53:43] speak anything until it becomes a
[1:53:45] thought and then it processes the word
[1:53:47] well God spoke our name it was a thought
[1:53:51] it became a war expression by word ain't
[1:53:54] that right amen and and in Isaiah 55 and
[1:53:58] 1 God said the word that go forth out of
[1:54:03] my mouth shall not return unto me void
[1:54:05] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:54:08] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:54:10] whereto I sent it ain't that right so
[1:54:14] this is God's purpose a word bride that
[1:54:17] elect Redemption bring him back all of
[1:54:20] these things is dealing with the with
[1:54:23] the elect of God this means that God has
[1:54:27] an agent to make sure that his word is
[1:54:31] accomplished and that it will prosper
[1:54:34] in the thing that he sent it
[1:54:36] ain't that right see so he has a
[1:54:40] Ministry whereby his will his purpose
[1:54:43] his agenda is accomplished
[1:54:47] now this word agent or agency again is
[1:54:51] the capacity condition or state of
[1:54:55] acting
[1:54:56] uh or of exerting power it's an
[1:55:00] operation a person or thing through
[1:55:03] which power is exerted or an end is
[1:55:08] achieved ain't that right so the
[1:55:11] ministry or the agency of God through
[1:55:14] that agency through that in Ministry a
[1:55:17] man the the the purpose of God will come
[1:55:21] to uh uh uh to be accomplished it'll be
[1:55:24] brought to pass so the ministry or the
[1:55:27] agency of God has full Authority
[1:55:31] are you with me has full Authority so to
[1:55:35] bring that word to pass we have talked
[1:55:39] about the angels of God being part of
[1:55:40] the ministry of God because I I believe
[1:55:44] in the ministry of angels amen and and
[1:55:47] they are messengers of God and and are
[1:55:50] sent of God to watch over his believing
[1:55:53] children
[1:55:54] and and here Psalms 91 and 9 it says
[1:55:58] because thou Hast made the Lord which is
[1:56:01] my refuge even the most high thy
[1:56:04] habitation there shall no evil befall
[1:56:06] thee neither shall any plague come nigh
[1:56:09] thy dwelling for he shall give his
[1:56:11] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[1:56:15] all thy ways ain't that right the
[1:56:17] prophet said the angels are watching
[1:56:19] over us day and night they never leave
[1:56:23] they are in Camp to Bow and we can
[1:56:25] expect God to do most anything at any
[1:56:28] time because of the presence of the
[1:56:31] angels of God who are commissioned by
[1:56:33] him to watch us and to care for us can
[1:56:37] you say Amen so so God's uh uh uh uh uh
[1:56:42] Ministry there see and and another place
[1:56:45] he says they are with us to minister
[1:56:48] spiritual blessings to us and to help us
[1:56:51] along the road and encourage us as we
[1:56:53] see the the heel of Zion Yonder inside
[1:56:56] ain't that right so so we we find that
[1:57:00] the angels of God I believe they're here
[1:57:01] this morning and they're encamped about
[1:57:03] these pews they're in they're encamped
[1:57:06] by you and and they're helping you
[1:57:08] Prophet said they're helping us to
[1:57:09] believe they're they're they're giving
[1:57:11] us a faith they're they're inspiring us
[1:57:14] ain't that right they give us a charge
[1:57:16] they're they're making sure that God's
[1:57:18] word is carried out but as I've stated
[1:57:21] that the angels are limited in what they
[1:57:23] can do they cannot create they cannot
[1:57:26] mediate or intercede for us they cannot
[1:57:28] redeem they cannot bring man into
[1:57:30] fellowship with God they cannot secure
[1:57:33] our soul God never send Angels uh to
[1:57:36] live inside of us so then God has
[1:57:39] another agency and or an agent and that
[1:57:41] is the Holy Ghost ain't that right
[1:57:43] that's God's agent look uh uh Genesis 1
[1:57:47] and 2 it says and the Earth was without
[1:57:49] form and void and darkness was upon the
[1:57:53] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[1:57:56] see the spirit of God the Holy Spirit
[1:57:59] moved upon the face of the waters see
[1:58:02] God's agent and God said let there be
[1:58:05] light and there was light
[1:58:07] ain't that right see so the holy spirit
[1:58:10] being God's agent it it takes the word
[1:58:15] of God and makes it live for he is the
[1:58:18] enforcer of God's law of God's word
[1:58:21] if you need healing amen God's agent the
[1:58:25] holy spirit is here to give it to you if
[1:58:27] you need Deliverance God's agent the
[1:58:29] holy spirit is here to give it to you
[1:58:31] ain't that right every Redemptive
[1:58:34] promise Belongs to You amen and God's
[1:58:37] holy spirit amen is here amen as his
[1:58:41] agent to give everything that you have
[1:58:43] need of
[1:58:45] ain't that right so we have talked about
[1:58:47] it um
[1:58:49] John 16 and 12 I have yet many things to
[1:58:52] say to you but you cannot bear them now
[1:58:55] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[1:58:57] has come he will guide you into Old
[1:58:59] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:59:01] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:59:04] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:59:07] come what God's agent ain't that right
[1:59:10] amen he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:59:13] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:59:15] you all things that the father hath are
[1:59:18] mine therefore said I that he shall take
[1:59:20] of mine and shall show it to you why he
[1:59:23] is God's agent amen that has been given
[1:59:25] to us ain't that right he is the one who
[1:59:29] has come in this day and revealed the
[1:59:31] mysteries of God to us why it's it's the
[1:59:34] ministry of God ain't that right and and
[1:59:38] the spirit of God that lives inside of
[1:59:41] us amen it lives inside of me lets me
[1:59:44] know that I am heir to all the promises
[1:59:46] of God why he's God's agent
[1:59:50] ain't that right he's God's agent and
[1:59:53] and Romans 8 16 says the spirit itself
[1:59:56] bearth witness with our spirit that we
[1:59:59] are the children of God
[2:00:02] have you ever just gone through your
[2:00:04] discouragements then just something just
[2:00:06] begins to rise up in you I am a Son of
[2:00:08] God well that's the holy spirit inside
[2:00:11] of you telling you and confirming to you
[2:00:14] that you're a child of God he's God's
[2:00:16] agent
[2:00:19] it's true
[2:00:20] God God doesn't leave leave his people
[2:00:22] without nothing it's our comforter it's
[2:00:25] our hope it's our help and you say Amen
[2:00:29] he said you was baptized by the grace of
[2:00:31] God into this great big arcade that's
[2:00:35] got every Redemptive blessings in it
[2:00:37] Everything Jesus died for is right here
[2:00:40] in the body of Christ healing salvation
[2:00:43] joy peace all these things belong to you
[2:00:46] it's yours well let the devil say oh
[2:00:48] don't you do it don't you do it well
[2:00:50] that's that old nasty Porter at the door
[2:00:52] don't you believe in that see walk right
[2:00:55] on in it's yours you've got a pass
[2:01:01] then you say man see you've got an
[2:01:03] abstract Deed on the place if sickness
[2:01:05] dwells in there it in in there you've
[2:01:08] got an abstract deed if you went home
[2:01:09] tonight and what if there's an enemy
[2:01:11] sitting in your house and the enemy said
[2:01:13] now wait a minute this house is built
[2:01:15] for a human being it's mine just as much
[2:01:17] as is your home see I'm just as much as
[2:01:20] a human being as you are but see you can
[2:01:22] walk right down to the courts get your
[2:01:24] abstract deed and show him this is my
[2:01:27] property it belongs to me
[2:01:29] praise the Lord that's right make that
[2:01:32] right now I I'm gonna be honest I I
[2:01:35] believe this thing's of the devil uh uh
[2:01:37] that's inspiring things today to where
[2:01:40] if you you you rent you you renting
[2:01:42] something a house you own that house but
[2:01:44] you rented out to somebody and then you
[2:01:45] they ain't paying their bills and they
[2:01:47] ain't paying their rent and all that and
[2:01:48] you want them to get out and they say I
[2:01:49] don't have to and you can't do nothing
[2:01:51] about it
[2:01:52] you know and basically they can own that
[2:01:54] house and or squatters rights or or
[2:01:57] whatever see and I I think that's that's
[2:01:59] just a a perversion of but but I'm
[2:02:02] telling you as a Believer them laws
[2:02:04] don't work when it comes to Heaven it
[2:02:07] does not work when it comes to the
[2:02:09] kingdom of God you have every right to
[2:02:11] tell that thing that devil that demon
[2:02:14] get out of my life get out of my home
[2:02:16] get out of whatever
[2:02:17] and he has to do it by your words
[2:02:21] can you say man
[2:02:22] so he says when you serve warning on the
[2:02:25] devil then he's got to get his nasty
[2:02:26] self camped on God's Property see he's
[2:02:29] got to get out he said if he don't get
[2:02:31] out don't want to get out just call on
[2:02:33] the authorities of Heaven God's law
[2:02:34] agent the Holy Ghost and he'll throw him
[2:02:37] out yes sir it's your property every
[2:02:39] Divine promise in the Bible belongs to
[2:02:42] every Christian
[2:02:43] do you believe that
[2:02:45] so that's God's agency is the Holy Ghost
[2:02:47] but then we look and just briefly here
[2:02:51] as we get ready to close that we see
[2:02:54] that man is God's agent as well
[2:02:58] God doesn't fall on mechanical or
[2:03:01] devices he doesn't fall on denominations
[2:03:04] the Holy Spirit falls upon men
[2:03:08] Abraham was God's agent Elijah was God's
[2:03:12] agent
[2:03:13] uh Jeremiah all the prophets of old
[2:03:15] Abraham uh David and and and all these
[2:03:20] men John Jesus even was God's agent and
[2:03:24] and in every generation God speaks to
[2:03:27] his people through human lips
[2:03:30] can you say Amen this word agent is a
[2:03:33] representative representative uh
[2:03:36] Emissary or official of a government one
[2:03:40] that acts or exerts power something that
[2:03:44] produces or is capable of producing an
[2:03:47] effect
[2:03:48] ain't that right so there's something
[2:03:51] behind this agent that has the ability
[2:03:54] to produce effectiveness
[2:03:57] see it's it's an active or if uh
[2:04:00] efficient calls a means or instrument by
[2:04:03] which a guiding intelligence achieves a
[2:04:07] result one an agent is one who is
[2:04:10] authorized to act for or in the place of
[2:04:13] another ain't that right so now now
[2:04:16] notice brother Branham explains the
[2:04:18] purpose of ministry and I I I I think
[2:04:22] this is is good he says we're trying to
[2:04:24] get every so saved so that Jesus can
[2:04:27] come and he cannot come until that last
[2:04:30] one that has the name of the book of
[2:04:32] life that was put there before the
[2:04:35] foundation of the world when that name
[2:04:37] is called that's the last one then he
[2:04:40] come to redeem to bring back redeem is
[2:04:43] to bring back and when he brings that
[2:04:45] last one in he's sitting at the right
[2:04:47] hand of God tonight doing his militarial
[2:04:50] work and when that last Soul was saved
[2:04:52] that was redeemed and seen and known by
[2:04:55] God before the foundation or when that
[2:04:56] last Soul was saved that closes the book
[2:05:00] can you say Amen that closes the book
[2:05:03] now I I'm thinking of this ministry
[2:05:07] uh as as we wind down
[2:05:11] we understand that there's there's three
[2:05:13] there were three Ministries in the days
[2:05:15] of lot
[2:05:16] ain't that right
[2:05:18] three Ministries all together that was
[2:05:20] going on at the same time and and uh
[2:05:24] there were the two angels uh that that
[2:05:28] were sent down uh to Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:05:31] and they went down to get locked
[2:05:35] out of Sodom
[2:05:37] ain't that right and we noticed that
[2:05:39] they blinded they blinded the the
[2:05:42] citizens of Sodom now lot represents the
[2:05:46] carnal believer
[2:05:48] ain't that right so let's put the
[2:05:49] Ministries in perspective
[2:05:51] amen lot represents the carnal believer
[2:05:55] and the angels went down to Sodom
[2:05:58] but then there was another angel now
[2:06:01] them two angels had their Ministries but
[2:06:04] then there was another Angel which was
[2:06:06] God himself
[2:06:08] Melchizedek that stayed there with
[2:06:12] Abraham which was God's elect
[2:06:16] ain't that right now Melchizedek was
[2:06:19] none other than God himself in human
[2:06:21] flesh Paul says he had no beginning he
[2:06:24] had no ending of days beginning of Life
[2:06:26] ending of life ain't that right and what
[2:06:29] was Abraham Abraham was elected and
[2:06:31] called of God not lot
[2:06:34] it was Abraham that God made an
[2:06:37] unconditional Covenant to not lot
[2:06:40] not lot never did receive a visitation
[2:06:43] from God but Abraham did
[2:06:47] Melchizedek coming to the Earth being
[2:06:49] made flesh God being made flesh was
[2:06:52] strictly for Abraham to give a promise
[2:06:55] of life to Abraham
[2:06:58] ain't that right so notice the
[2:06:59] difference in the Ministries see now lot
[2:07:02] lot never had had a visitation he was
[2:07:05] never called out of out of Sodom or out
[2:07:07] of out of the land of UR like Abraham
[2:07:10] was amen lot went just for the ride
[2:07:14] ain't that right and and the prophet
[2:07:17] said God never did uh uh bless Abraham
[2:07:20] until he fully separated from lot
[2:07:24] ain't that right so now notice as we we
[2:07:27] most of us know but Luke 17 28 it says
[2:07:31] as it was in the days of lot they did
[2:07:34] eat they drank they bought they sold
[2:07:36] they planted they build it now they're
[2:07:38] doing that just right now right we're in
[2:07:40] that same day but the same day that lot
[2:07:43] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[2:07:44] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[2:07:46] all even thus shall it be when in the
[2:07:50] day when the son of man is revealed
[2:07:54] ain't that right now how many believe
[2:07:56] we're living in the days of lot we're
[2:07:59] living in them days now so then we've
[2:08:02] had a a a a a a Prophet come in this day
[2:08:06] and he tells us and he compared amen the
[2:08:09] two angels just like it was in in Sodom
[2:08:12] we've had two angels uh uh or well three
[2:08:15] but but two uh angels that that had the
[2:08:19] ministry to the Sodom and to this world
[2:08:22] and that was brother Branham called it
[2:08:24] Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and their
[2:08:27] Ministries are are uh uh compared to
[2:08:30] that of the two angels that went down to
[2:08:32] Sodom he says There came up Three Angels
[2:08:35] and one of them was God ain't that right
[2:08:38] and so he sit down with Abraham and two
[2:08:42] of them went down and Sodom and preached
[2:08:44] the gospel to them is that right a
[2:08:46] modern Billy Graham to the church
[2:08:48] nominal that's in Sodom great men like
[2:08:51] that Oral Roberts going down there and
[2:08:53] Performing see they didn't do much of a
[2:08:55] miracle not too many they did something
[2:08:57] smiting the people blind and the
[2:09:01] preaching of the Gospel smites there
[2:09:03] they was in that denominational realm
[2:09:05] down there preaching uh the gospel see
[2:09:08] Billy Graham that Mighty uh Great Mighty
[2:09:11] evangelist through the Baptists and
[2:09:12] Presbyterians and all of these things oh
[2:09:14] he lays the line down to them but you
[2:09:16] see he preached to them calling them out
[2:09:18] but then there was one that stayed
[2:09:22] behind with Abraham and he gave Abraham
[2:09:25] a sign now we all know this as or most
[2:09:28] as Believers of the Gospel that that
[2:09:30] same sign that Melchizedek showed
[2:09:32] Abraham we have received in this day
[2:09:35] and and and and I'll just go through it
[2:09:37] right fast but that that sign uh uh was
[2:09:41] that uh God Melchizedek God in flesh
[2:09:44] told Abraham said you're going to have a
[2:09:47] son I'm gonna bless you amen and Sarah
[2:09:49] the Bible says was in the tent behind
[2:09:52] him and she laughed within herself she
[2:09:55] didn't go ha ha ha she
[2:09:57] snickered with the inner self and and
[2:10:00] Melchizedek looked at Abraham and said
[2:10:02] why did Sarah laugh
[2:10:04] ain't that right why did she laugh and
[2:10:07] she says oh I didn't laugh he said but
[2:10:09] you did laugh
[2:10:11] see he discerned the very heart that of
[2:10:14] her her actions and and everything well
[2:10:16] we've had in this day a man by a prophet
[2:10:19] God would come down amen and discern the
[2:10:22] very hearts and intents of the uh of the
[2:10:25] heart the thoughts ain't that right so
[2:10:27] we've had a visitation just like Abraham
[2:10:30] did God manifested In the Flesh and we
[2:10:33] received the same sign this message that
[2:10:36] we have received is to the elect
[2:10:39] do you believe it it's a Ministry amen
[2:10:43] so here amen so so we're looking here
[2:10:46] and and again we're trying to get every
[2:10:49] so saved so that Jesus can come he
[2:10:52] cannot come until that last one that has
[2:10:54] in the name written on the book of life
[2:10:57] that was put there before the foundation
[2:10:59] of the world can you say Amen so what is
[2:11:02] the ministry looking for the names
[2:11:05] amen
[2:11:08] hello this message is not for everybody
[2:11:14] ain't that right
[2:11:15] I don't believe that brother Brandon
[2:11:17] wasted his time going seven times around
[2:11:18] the world
[2:11:20] I don't believe that these these tapes
[2:11:22] and these these uh the messages uh uh
[2:11:24] being spread out through the world is in
[2:11:26] vain
[2:11:28] it's God looking for that last seed that
[2:11:31] had his name written on the Lamb's Book
[2:11:33] of Life
[2:11:34] ain't that right now notice what brother
[2:11:36] Brown said when the last name comes out
[2:11:38] that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:11:40] see that was slain before the foundation
[2:11:42] of the world when that last name has
[2:11:44] been redeemed his work is finished he
[2:11:47] comes forth to claim what he has
[2:11:48] redeemed now that makes our heart bleed
[2:11:51] but if it went on for a thousand years
[2:11:53] later there would not be one redeemed
[2:11:57] if God would wait for another ten
[2:11:59] thousand years and we all preach and
[2:12:01] we're all doing the same and if there's
[2:12:03] if the name of that on that that book
[2:12:05] amen has already been called there's can
[2:12:08] never be another one saved
[2:12:12] I know that's deep you know I mean maybe
[2:12:15] a little rough but that's okay we're
[2:12:17] just it's Bible
[2:12:19] can you say amen God is not currently
[2:12:22] adding names to the book
[2:12:24] he's already done that
[2:12:26] ain't that right see so then as message
[2:12:30] Believers and I'm I'm going to put all
[2:12:33] of this as as as part of this ministry
[2:12:36] in one way or another but as message
[2:12:38] Believers we are as responsible to get
[2:12:42] this message out
[2:12:45] can you say Amen
[2:12:46] we aren't to water this mess is down so
[2:12:49] that we don't offend somebody
[2:12:53] are you with me
[2:12:55] we aren't supposed to just to take this
[2:12:57] message and hide it so that we won't
[2:12:59] scare people
[2:13:04] brother Branham you know if he was the
[2:13:07] Forerunner of this message he's the one
[2:13:08] that brought the message
[2:13:10] and he didn't he didn't care he loved
[2:13:12] people and you know he did
[2:13:15] he never wavered one time bringing this
[2:13:17] message
[2:13:18] knowing that it would cost him his
[2:13:20] ministry knowing that the church would
[2:13:23] kick him out knowing that he would just
[2:13:25] be despised he would lose friendship
[2:13:28] but he stay true to this message
[2:13:31] then what about us
[2:13:33] we're going to water down the message so
[2:13:35] we don't offend
[2:13:36] so we don't be as odd so we don't scare
[2:13:38] or we don't run people off
[2:13:41] the ministry is God's Ministry
[2:13:44] we are God's agents
[2:13:49] and you say Amen
[2:13:51] see The Messengers that went down the
[2:13:53] lot they didn't have a message for
[2:13:54] Abraham
[2:13:56] their message was to locked
[2:13:59] but the one that stayed with Abraham he
[2:14:01] had a message of promise
[2:14:03] ain't that right God was with Abraham
[2:14:07] amen a man isn't going to have influence
[2:14:10] on a soul that has their name written in
[2:14:13] the Lamb's Book of Life by preaching
[2:14:15] some watered-down social gospel
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:22] you say man
[2:14:24] I'm trying to show you his message
[2:14:26] believers
[2:14:28] as what Ministry you have
[2:14:30] because man is part of the ministry of
[2:14:32] God which makes him a representative God
[2:14:35] he's the one that is acting instead of
[2:14:38] God instead of God can you say Amen he's
[2:14:43] the one that acts or exerts the power
[2:14:45] see we as the Church of the Living God
[2:14:47] are not to be powerless
[2:14:51] all right lay down and you say Amen
[2:14:54] we're not to be powerless we're not to
[2:14:57] let the devil take away our the
[2:14:59] supernatural out of our lives out of our
[2:15:02] churches out of our homes out of
[2:15:03] whatever
[2:15:04] amen because when he does that we become
[2:15:07] formal
[2:15:08] and if you look at the ministry of God
[2:15:10] it's never been formal
[2:15:12] it's been with power and demonstration
[2:15:15] of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen
[2:15:18] amen I just believe that do you love the
[2:15:21] Lord
[2:15:21] amen if the musicians will come
[2:15:24] we could go on and on Amen but I hope
[2:15:27] it's been some type of a help to you
[2:15:30] and we'll we'll carry on at another time
[2:15:33] but we we the Church of the Living God
[2:15:35] is not to be powerless
[2:15:38] why because men and women
[2:15:40] whom God is called to be his agents in
[2:15:42] this day
[2:15:43] are capable of producing an effect
[2:15:47] are you with me if you're part of the
[2:15:50] Church of the Living God you're part of
[2:15:51] his ministry
[2:15:53] mothers are part of the ministry of God
[2:15:56] you don't have to stand there helpless
[2:15:58] and once the devil take your children
[2:16:00] and and and and Destroy them
[2:16:04] amen hello
[2:16:09] as preachers we don't have to stand
[2:16:11] helpless as as lay members don't have to
[2:16:14] stand helpless as men fathers husbands
[2:16:17] we don't have to stand there helpless
[2:16:19] we're agents of God
[2:16:23] but the full Authority
[2:16:25] why because God speaks through man God
[2:16:28] uses men how else is that last name
[2:16:31] going to come forth by men that has
[2:16:33] preached this gospel by people that have
[2:16:36] shared this message
[2:16:38] had the burden for Souls
[2:16:41] and you say Amen
[2:16:44] yes sir I love the Lord
[2:16:47] you love him
[2:16:48] Lord is so wonderful
[2:16:50] amen we are not to be dilatory
[2:16:53] we're not to be complacent
[2:16:55] amen we got a Ministry we've got a work
[2:16:57] to do
[2:16:59] you say well I've been in the message
[2:17:00] that's all there just is well
[2:17:02] if you're not being active in this
[2:17:04] message something wrong
[2:17:05] God didn't just call you to be this
[2:17:08] message so you can be all saved and
[2:17:09] glorified and saved and you know all
[2:17:12] these things what about others that are
[2:17:14] needing help
[2:17:15] you think denominations got that power
[2:17:17] to do that absolutely not
[2:17:20] [Music]
[2:17:23] it's true
[2:17:24] I believe that God is still using people
[2:17:26] today his elect
[2:17:28] his agency his church to bring souls in
[2:17:33] and I just believe that you love him
[2:17:39] I am redeemed
