[37:47] Christ's name we pray amen you can be
[37:50] seated
[37:51] amen I I had just a little thought on my
[37:55] heart uh if I could give it a title
[37:59] um I would like to maybe title it the
[38:01] blood will never lose its power
[38:05] and are you thankful for the blood
[38:07] tonight
[38:08] amen so if we go
[38:11] and I may kind of go back and forth and
[38:15] you guys are just going to have to have
[38:16] to bear with me tonight but uh if we go
[38:20] back to the very beginning when God
[38:23] created uh the universe when God
[38:27] of the universe longed for Fellowship
[38:31] and the God who formed the mountains the
[38:34] God who carved the rivers who spoke
[38:38] light and the sun came forth
[38:41] he put the moon and the stars in its
[38:43] place
[38:45] yet he longed for Fellowship he longed
[38:48] to be able to express himself amen see
[38:53] he couldn't have fellowship with the
[38:54] angels
[38:56] see they were made to Give Him worship
[38:58] night and day they were made to sing
[39:00] Holy Holy are you Lord God Almighty
[39:02] every day and night you know the God
[39:05] created them to worship him but he
[39:08] wanted to express every attribute that
[39:12] was within himself
[39:13] he couldn't Express himself to the
[39:15] angels and he couldn't Express himself
[39:18] to anyone else
[39:19] inside of him was the attribute of
[39:22] Savior inside of him there was an
[39:25] attribute to be a Healer
[39:27] he wanted to express himself
[39:30] amen he couldn't Express himself to his
[39:33] angels they couldn't be lost
[39:35] his angels couldn't be lost they
[39:36] couldn't be sick they were Immortal
[39:39] beings his brother Branham says so he
[39:41] wouldn't display his healing power he
[39:44] couldn't display his salvation
[39:46] so what did he have to do
[39:48] he had to create man
[39:51] he had to create a man in his own image
[39:55] so he put a man on a free moral agency
[39:58] to make a choice if you take this uh you
[40:02] live if you take that you die and every
[40:05] man that comes into the world is still
[40:07] set with the same thing so God gave us
[40:10] each a a a choice uh he put within us to
[40:14] make decisions so every day we wake up
[40:16] we have to make a decision we have to
[40:18] decide whether we're going to get out of
[40:20] bed and go to work we're going to have
[40:22] to decide which vehicle we're going to
[40:23] take to work amen we have to uh uh uh
[40:28] some of the decisions are not easy uh my
[40:31] wife was actually just telling me
[40:32] yesterday she says decisions to cook is
[40:35] just so hard I don't know what to do I
[40:38] want to make this or I want to make that
[40:39] but uh so she's all the time what do you
[40:42] want and I said well I'm not I'm not the
[40:44] the queen of the kitchen I said you are
[40:46] you are the queen of the kitchen you can
[40:48] decide and and I'll just have to eat it
[40:51] amen so so God put uh
[40:55] uh the free moral agents and the human
[40:58] being amen so so what did God do he then
[41:02] created
[41:03] Adam and Eve amen God then tells Adam uh
[41:08] uh and Eve he says Thou shalt not eat of
[41:12] the fruit of the tree of Good and Evil
[41:14] you know so the decision he God told him
[41:16] God laid his judgment out right there on
[41:18] the table God told him you shall not eat
[41:20] of this tree but the choice was still up
[41:23] to them whether they did it or not you
[41:25] know he said if you eat of this tree you
[41:28] will die so so he his judgment came
[41:30] forth amen so when God began to
[41:34] fellowship with Adam and in the cool of
[41:36] the evenings Amen brother Branham says
[41:39] now man was born to have Fellowship man
[41:43] in the beginning back in the Garden of
[41:45] Eden he had wonderful Fellowship God
[41:48] came down fellowship with the company of
[41:50] men and women every evening in the
[41:53] quality evening God would come down
[41:55] under the big palm trees perhaps his uh
[41:58] sacred light as it was shining down on
[42:00] Adam and Eve and that get great cathed
[42:03] neutral in the open fellowship with God
[42:07] and nothing to worry about as long as
[42:10] they were fellowshipping amen see it was
[42:13] a perfect Fellowship between God and man
[42:16] amen aren't you thankful for that yeah
[42:19] uh you know maybe maybe Eve would then
[42:22] say uh uh uh uh Adam you know it's a
[42:25] little chilly over here you know I'm a
[42:28] little cool and then Adam being in
[42:30] perfect fellowship with God would then
[42:33] say uh uh wind peace be still you know
[42:36] he then could say you know it's okay you
[42:39] know I I'll just speak to the wind and
[42:41] maybe uh she would say Adam you know the
[42:44] sun is just a little bright but you know
[42:47] I like this view over the mountains and
[42:49] and then Adam would say you know don't
[42:51] have no fear but then he would turn
[42:54] around and say tree be plucked up there
[42:56] and be planted right here as a shade for
[42:58] E see it was perfect uh commune with God
[43:02] Amen man but then
[43:06] sin broke that Fellowship
[43:10] amen causing a separation between God
[43:14] and man
[43:15] hey man what a tragedy what I well I was
[43:19] just studying I I was uh putting this
[43:22] together and
[43:23] and as I was just studying the the
[43:26] fellowship and listening brother Brown
[43:27] I'm talking about the fellowship God had
[43:30] with Adam
[43:31] hey and it broke my heart that that uh
[43:36] when I come down to this part the part
[43:39] that brother Branham says that sin is
[43:42] what uh separated God between man it
[43:46] broke it broke that Fellowship
[43:49] so that's why you know uh there's so
[43:52] many denominations today in the world
[43:55] they are trying to find a way back to
[43:59] God you know so so so what do they do
[44:01] they they try to bring a religion they
[44:05] try to bring uh uh they tried to bring
[44:08] their works and and uh that was the same
[44:12] with Adam and Eve when they had eaten of
[44:14] that tree their eyes were open and they
[44:17] knew that they had sin they knew that
[44:18] they were naked so what did they do they
[44:20] took out fig leaves and made a covering
[44:22] brother Branham says that covering or
[44:25] covering means religion so just like in
[44:28] the church world today you know uh they
[44:30] see that they're wrong they see that
[44:32] they were born in this world of Sinners
[44:34] so what they're trying to do is they try
[44:36] to bring their denomination they're
[44:38] trying to bring their covering to God as
[44:41] a sacrifice they're trying to get God to
[44:43] accept the Badness but some of them seen
[44:46] that the Baptists don't seem to be
[44:47] working so they try to create this and
[44:50] then they try to create that you know
[44:52] and to bring themselves back into that
[44:55] relay relationship that was once back in
[44:58] the Eden our Garden of Eden amen Genesis
[45:01] 3 verse 8 says and they heard the voice
[45:05] talking of Adam and Eve they heard the
[45:08] voice of the Lord walking in the garden
[45:10] uh in the cool of the day
[45:14] the time that God would meet them for
[45:18] Fellowship
[45:19] and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[45:23] from the presence of the Lord God
[45:25] amongst the Trees of the garden and the
[45:28] Lord called unto Adam and said Where Art
[45:31] Thou and he said I heard thy voice in
[45:34] the garden and I was afraid
[45:37] see that never happened before when God
[45:39] would call unto Adam Adam was always
[45:41] there
[45:42] and where when God would always come to
[45:45] meet Adam Adam was always there to have
[45:47] that relationship but when God showed up
[45:49] Adam was nowhere to be found
[45:51] see and he hid themselves he said I was
[45:55] afraid I was naked and I hid myself what
[45:59] caused them to be afraid
[46:01] sin
[46:03] sin is what broke that relationship
[46:05] between God and and man but God who is
[46:08] in rich in Mercy still long for that
[46:11] Fellowship aren't you thankful for that
[46:13] he still Longs for that fellowship and
[46:16] he said I will put enmity between thy
[46:18] seed and the Serpent's Seed in order for
[46:21] them to come back into that relationship
[46:23] with God God himself had to provide a
[46:26] covering so what did God do God took the
[46:29] blood of a lamb he took the blood of a
[46:31] lamb and he clothed Adam and Eve with
[46:33] him so Adam and Eve's religion didn't
[46:36] work Adam and Eve's religion I couldn't
[46:39] bring God in and then back together a
[46:42] sin was still in the way so God said I
[46:46] will bring you a covering and by the
[46:48] blood of the Lamb there will always be
[46:51] you will always have to come under the
[46:53] blood to have fellowship with me
[46:56] amen so he took the blood of the skin or
[46:59] the skin of a lamb and clothed Adam and
[47:01] Eve with it
[47:03] signifying that one day there was to
[47:06] come a perfect lamb to take away the
[47:09] sins of the world
[47:10] amen they had to come by gloss provided
[47:13] way not their provided way we have many
[47:16] people in the world today trying to come
[47:18] up with their own ideas but they have to
[47:21] become God's provided away and that is a
[47:24] blood sacrifice amen
[47:27] Adam and Eve came back into fellowship
[47:30] with God
[47:32] but still couldn't be that perfect
[47:34] Fellowship
[47:35] that they had once had amen because sin
[47:38] was still there see the blood that
[47:40] covered them was only a type of what was
[47:42] to come
[47:43] and Israel used to uh uh Israel used to
[47:46] take the red heifer and sacrifice uh her
[47:50] upon the Altar for the remissions of
[47:52] sins
[47:54] amen
[47:55] they would take the heifer and lay it on
[47:59] the altar
[48:00] and when they would uh then they would
[48:02] maybe take a rock
[48:04] so after they took this heifer they laid
[48:07] it on the altar and then maybe they
[48:09] would take a a rock or they had to take
[48:11] something uh sharp and they will begin
[48:14] to cut the after at the lamb or the or
[48:17] the heifer's throat and the animal and
[48:21] as they were cutting the throw uh as
[48:24] they were cutting the animal the the
[48:26] blood of the animal we would begin to
[48:28] cover them the blood would begin to pour
[48:30] out upon them so they had a place the
[48:34] lamb in a certain way that when they
[48:36] began to cut that uh the throat of that
[48:39] lamb uh or heifer the blood would cover
[48:42] them amen and they had to be fully
[48:46] covered amen the believing worship our
[48:49] worshiper had to be identified with his
[48:53] Sacrifice by the token and when the
[48:56] blood was placed to where he could stand
[48:58] under the blood the blood must be over
[49:01] him and that was a token that he had
[49:04] identified himself guilty and have
[49:07] proven that an innocent substance
[49:08] attitude to have taken his place
[49:11] amen God had to see the blood
[49:15] and for years
[49:17] the guilty one was just covered
[49:22] but that covering could not take away
[49:24] the desire for sin
[49:26] it was not a perfect offering it it was
[49:29] a shadow of the real thing to come
[49:33] so each year the man would sacrifice
[49:36] and each year come back because he still
[49:39] had the same desire to sin
[49:41] so every year they had to take a lamb or
[49:43] a heifer every year they had to come
[49:46] back and they would cut that Lamb's
[49:48] throat year after year in order to be
[49:51] covered
[49:52] but he still had that desire to sin he
[49:54] still had the desire to to to do the
[49:57] things of the world
[50:00] amen the life of the animal atoned for
[50:04] his sin but being an animal's blood that
[50:07] was shed and animal life that was given
[50:10] it could not come back upon the man
[50:13] God could not come to that full
[50:15] relationship with man because that sin
[50:18] was still there
[50:20] and he still craved those things of the
[50:23] world Amen because there wasn't a
[50:26] perfect sacrifice a perfect sacrifice
[50:29] hadn't come yet
[50:31] amen so so what they did ah
[50:36] see it could uh
[50:38] so year after year
[50:40] maybe little Johnny would have to come
[50:42] with his little lamb
[50:45] maybe maybe year after year maybe maybe
[50:48] uh his father would send Little Johnny
[50:50] to go out and and grab his lamb
[50:53] and bring it before his father and
[50:56] as he stood there the father would then
[50:59] take the knife
[51:01] and he would begin to cut the throat of
[51:02] that little lamb and as a little boy
[51:04] watched
[51:07] as he watched his little lamb
[51:12] who was so innocent give his life the
[51:15] father would begin to say shut
[51:17] one day we'll do this for the last time
[51:21] and you'll have to sacrifice your lamb
[51:23] no more
[51:24] one day there will come a perfect
[51:26] sacrifice
[51:27] hold on my son be of good cheer
[51:31] amen there will come a perfect sacrifice
[51:36] and year after year they waited amen
[51:39] first John 1 29.
[51:41] and then the next day John seeth Jesus
[51:44] coming unto him and say behold
[51:47] the Lamb of God which taketh away the
[51:49] sin of the world so year after year ever
[51:52] since the fall of Man they become an eye
[51:55] they wanted they longed for that
[51:56] fellowship with God so ah they could
[51:59] only sacrifice that lamb but see it was
[52:02] only a covering
[52:03] and see we uh we who was lost in sin
[52:09] needed uh something greater than that
[52:12] animal blood we needed something greater
[52:15] to make us clean we needed something
[52:18] greater to take away the desires of the
[52:20] world we needed a perfect sacrifice and
[52:24] John says here he comes John says behold
[52:27] this is the Lamb of God who taketh away
[52:29] the sin of the world
[52:31] so God being made perfect sent his son
[52:33] in the form of a man to be made lower
[52:37] than the angels to be beaten to be
[52:39] warned to suffer Agony on the cross
[52:43] to Bear our shame and reproach so that
[52:46] we could be made perfect through him in
[52:48] love
[52:50] so that blood
[52:52] of the animal could not come back upon
[52:54] the worshiper
[52:56] because there was no Power in the Blood
[52:59] It could only cover the worshiper so
[53:01] maybe we would maybe if we would take
[53:04] maybe this this cup
[53:06] and we see that it's a cup but then as
[53:09] we place something over it
[53:12] see that blood could only cover the cup
[53:15] this rack could only cover the cup but
[53:18] see you know it's a cup you still see it
[53:20] there so see that's that the blood could
[53:23] only cover the sin the sin would never
[53:26] go away that sin was still there so we
[53:29] needed a perfect sacrifice
[53:32] to take away the sin and the desires
[53:36] that when God sees the blood he sees a
[53:41] perfect sacrifice he don't see the sin
[53:44] no more amen are you thankful for that
[53:47] brother Branham says if it had come back
[53:49] talking of the animal our blood it would
[53:52] still not have availed but when Christ
[53:55] the perfect substitute was given and his
[53:58] blood was shed then the life that was in
[54:01] Christ came back upon the repentant
[54:03] sinner that the life being the perfect
[54:05] life of Christ sinless and righteous
[54:09] then the guilty one could go free for he
[54:11] had no desire to sin The Life of Christ
[54:15] had to come back upon Him amen that's
[54:18] what it means in Romans 8 and 2 the law
[54:21] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[54:24] hath made me free from the law of sin
[54:27] and death
[54:29] amen has made us free
[54:32] amen how how can we have life
[54:36] how can we have life if the dead things
[54:39] of the world are still in US you can't
[54:41] you can't have the The Life of Christ in
[54:44] you with the dead things of the world in
[54:46] you
[54:47] you know how can light have fellowship
[54:49] with Darkness
[54:51] it can't happen
[54:52] so there had to come a perfect sacrifice
[54:55] there had become something to to take
[54:57] away the desires
[55:01] you can't be born again and still crave
[55:03] the things of the world it won't work it
[55:05] won't
[55:06] so what did he have to do
[55:08] God had to take you through
[55:11] justification by faith
[55:14] Sanctified through his shed blood and
[55:18] then he gave you the baptism of the Holy
[55:21] Spirit which is Christ Living in you
[55:24] amen Christ didn't come just to cover
[55:27] our sins
[55:28] Christ didn't come just to to uh try and
[55:32] just uh well I'll just cover you but you
[55:35] just go on as you were but no he he
[55:38] longed for a fellowship he longed to
[55:40] fellowship with you he longed to have
[55:42] fellowship with me and the only way to
[55:45] do that he had to come God himself had
[55:49] to come in the form of a man and
[55:51] sacrifice himself
[55:53] amen he says Christ didn't come just to
[55:56] cover our sins but he said I have come
[55:59] that you may have life
[56:01] because I live you shall live also
[56:05] amen the blood shall be to you
[56:08] hey man as a token
[56:11] amen are you thankful for that
[56:14] amen because I live you shall live also
[56:18] amen what is a token
[56:21] it's a sign that the price has been paid
[56:25] amen a token ah to board a plane
[56:30] would be a ticket
[56:32] so so if you were to go five plane or uh
[56:36] ride in a plane then you had to purchase
[56:39] a ticket before they let you on
[56:41] you couldn't just go up to that pilot
[56:43] and said here here's fifty dollars or
[56:45] here here here's a hundred dollars that
[56:47] pilot would say no you have to go you
[56:49] have to go and make a purchase of your
[56:51] ticket amen and to board that plane and
[56:55] brother Branham says then the blood was
[56:57] a token or an identification the blood
[56:59] identified the worshiper uh had slain
[57:03] the lamb and accepted the lamb and
[57:06] applied the token to himself that he was
[57:09] not ashamed amen and of God didn't see
[57:12] the blood upon the worshiper
[57:14] he couldn't recognize his sacrifice
[57:19] so if we refer back to the cup
[57:21] if we if we take that if we take this
[57:23] and we hide it again
[57:25] if we if we only covered it up yeah God
[57:29] seen God sees the uh he covered the
[57:32] Lamb's blood covered it up but see God's
[57:34] still seen that God still sees the sin
[57:38] but but if you take away the blood
[57:41] God couldn't God couldn't uh God
[57:45] couldn't
[57:46] the atone for the I'll get it out the
[57:50] atone uh the the Lamb's blood could not
[57:52] atone for that worshiper
[57:55] because he hadn't applied the blood
[57:57] so what did he have to do he had to go
[57:59] get the lamb he had to go get the lamb
[58:02] and he had to come and he had to
[58:04] sacrifice
[58:06] and order for that blood to come upon
[58:08] him
[58:09] but see if God didn't see that blood if
[58:12] if this rag was not on this cup I mean
[58:14] you see the cup now and but see God
[58:17] could not their sins couldn't be
[58:19] forgiven God God couldn't look as them
[58:21] as clean amen he remained Unforgiven
[58:25] there had to come a lamb there had to
[58:29] come a death amen just like today there
[58:32] has to come a death if you're going to
[58:34] get the token hey man you have to
[58:37] surrender yourself you have to prepare
[58:39] yourself for God to receive uh to give
[58:42] you the Holy Ghost amen the believer had
[58:45] to be covered in thou Lamb's blood the
[58:48] believer had to be identified with his
[58:50] sacrifice as a token that he uh had done
[58:54] what God Said do amen we we look at Cain
[58:57] and Abel you see uh Cain had brought a
[59:01] sacrifice but see he came brought his
[59:03] fruits
[59:06] the fruits of his labor he brought in
[59:09] the uh Bocce God wouldn't accept that
[59:12] but see Abra or Abel had a revelation
[59:16] from God that it took a blood sacrifice
[59:19] it took a blood sacrifice to be free and
[59:23] you know of course you know the story
[59:24] King gets jealous and he smites Abel uh
[59:28] uh but just like the church world today
[59:30] they're trying to bring God the fruits
[59:33] of their labor amen Matthew 7 22 says
[59:38] many will say to me in that day Lord
[59:40] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[59:43] and in thy name have we not cast out
[59:45] devils and in thy name done many
[59:47] wonderful works
[59:49] and then I will profess unto them I
[59:52] never knew you depart from ye that work
[59:55] iniquity see Cain was religious
[59:59] Cain was a religious person
[1:00:02] but he didn't come with the right
[1:00:04] sacrifice there are many religious
[1:00:07] people out there in the world today but
[1:00:09] only there's only one person there's
[1:00:11] only one Church there's only one bride
[1:00:13] who has received the Revelation that you
[1:00:16] have to come under the perfect sacrifice
[1:00:18] of the Lamb of God Amen uh Christ didn't
[1:00:23] shed his own blood for us to still crave
[1:00:25] the things of the world when when his
[1:00:28] blood was shed it took every desire I
[1:00:31] once had every craving I once had and it
[1:00:35] did it away
[1:00:37] hey man Psalms 103 verse 12 says as far
[1:00:41] as the East is from the West
[1:00:43] so far he's even remove my
[1:00:45] transgressions from me he doesn't
[1:00:48] remember them
[1:00:50] he doesn't remember your sins
[1:00:53] [Applause]
[1:00:54] brother Branham says you're standing
[1:00:56] completely you never sin at the first
[1:01:00] place
[1:01:01] God didn't even know it's in the sea of
[1:01:04] forgetfulness brother Bill you never did
[1:01:06] it in the first place you are accused of
[1:01:09] it by the Accuser
[1:01:11] oh yeah Satan accuses you every day of
[1:01:13] it but God don't remember
[1:01:16] brother Branham says but really from the
[1:01:18] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[1:01:21] son and daughter of God you're standing
[1:01:23] there washed and your old book of
[1:01:25] divorcement is put away and it's dead
[1:01:27] absolutely out of existence even in the
[1:01:31] mind of God
[1:01:32] Amen God don't remember it
[1:01:36] amen a greater sacrifice has come in
[1:01:39] this day
[1:01:40] they didn't have that back then it could
[1:01:43] only cover God could still see the sin
[1:01:46] but in this day
[1:01:49] God don't see it no more
[1:01:52] in this day you're free amen from the
[1:01:56] guilt of sin
[1:01:58] now Satan may try to condemn you and he
[1:02:00] does every single day every single day
[1:02:02] Satan comes to me and tries to remind me
[1:02:04] of my sin
[1:02:06] he may try to torment your flesh he may
[1:02:09] try to remind you of this he may try to
[1:02:11] remind you of something you did years
[1:02:13] and years ago
[1:02:14] and but as long as you're under the
[1:02:17] blood
[1:02:17] that's where God drew the line
[1:02:20] Satan can't cross that bloodline
[1:02:23] it's become our Shield
[1:02:25] the blood is our Shield
[1:02:28] amen so you take the cap

[1:03:33] blood does for us
[1:03:34] the blood has come to set us free the

[1:03:39] condemnation has no hold on you
[1:03:42] amen

[1:08:06] for many years day after day
[1:08:09] beaten
[1:08:11] being torn apart
[1:08:13] being a slave to sin
[1:08:15] then one day there came a message
[1:08:19] there came a call a message calling them
[1:08:22] to come out
[1:08:24] Moses says hey you don't have to suffer
[1:08:27] no more

[1:08:47] has everything you have need of
[1:08:49] and whoever took heeda to that call was
[1:08:52] saved
[1:08:53] and it's the same today
[1:08:56] there came a message from God through
[1:08:57] the through the prophet through the
[1:09:00] voice of brother Branham
[1:09:02] there came a message calling us to come
[1:09:04] out
[1:09:05] amen come out of what come out of the
[1:09:08] formal ideas come out of that sin come
[1:09:12] out of laodicea come there's a new land

[1:09:17] land I'll take you to
[1:09:19] this land is Flowing with milk and honey
[1:09:21] you see you see this land is where the
[1:09:24] lion lays down with the lamb
[1:09:27] then this lamb the the lame leaps for
[1:09:30] joy
[1:09:31] in this land there are sickness and
[1:09:34] disease can't enter there
[1:09:38] for this land is pure This Land Is Holy
[1:09:41] and all who take heed this message
[1:09:44] shall be saved
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:50] so death
[1:09:51] getting ready to strike Egypt at night
[1:09:54] and all those who had the token would be
[1:09:56] saved
[1:09:58] and it's the same today God getting
[1:10:01] ready to strike the land
[1:10:04] getting ready to strike this Earth and
[1:10:06] only those who have the token will be
[1:10:09] saved
[1:10:10] what is the token for us today it's
[1:10:12] Jesus Christ
[1:10:14] and what is Christ it's the word
[1:10:17] and what is the word for us today it's
[1:10:20] the message of the hour
[1:10:24] under the message
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:28] so that's what the trouble is with our
[1:10:30] schools today
[1:10:33] they've taken the token out
[1:10:35] they've taken Christ out of our schools
[1:10:39] so shootings take place all the time you
[1:10:41] you read the news I I don't get on I
[1:10:44] hate the news it's too depressing
[1:10:46] my wife lets me know it keeps me updated
[1:10:49] with everything in the world because I
[1:10:51] have no idea and uh
[1:10:56] and uh so that's what's happened with
[1:10:58] her schools today
[1:11:00] that's why there's so many shootings in
[1:11:02] the world that's that's that's why
[1:11:04] there's so many uh here years ago I
[1:11:07] actually remember
[1:11:09] um uh this big shooting that happened
[1:11:11] here at Virginia Tech I remember uh we
[1:11:14] was I'm almost thinking he's at brother
[1:11:16] Roy's or we were somewheres uh near
[1:11:20] uh are not way somewhere we was at a
[1:11:23] hotel and dad was getting ready to
[1:11:24] preach somewheres and we actually seen
[1:11:26] it on the news that a shooting had taken
[1:11:29] place
[1:11:30] um here in Tech and I don't know if it
[1:11:31] was that same year or if it was like the
[1:11:33] next year but I know it was like it
[1:11:35] wasn't really far apart but I know they
[1:11:37] were talking about it on the news and
[1:11:40] then but that but that's what that's
[1:11:42] what's happening in the world today is
[1:11:45] they've taken Christ out of the schools
[1:11:46] they said well because you used to they
[1:11:48] used to pray before they started school
[1:11:51] and you know us being homeschooled mom
[1:11:53] would always pray with us every morning
[1:11:55] we'd always do our devotions every
[1:11:57] morning before we start school brother
[1:11:58] Branham teaches us that and so they
[1:12:01] would always they would always uh pray
[1:12:03] before but then somewhere somewhere uh
[1:12:07] someone didn't like that idea so they
[1:12:09] kicked God out of their schools and then
[1:12:12] someone comes in possessed by the devil
[1:12:15] and shoots a bunch of people up and then
[1:12:18] they go where where is God
[1:12:20] God
[1:12:23] this world is crazy they kick them out
[1:12:26] and then they want him back in
[1:12:30] the students are now identifying as cats
[1:12:33] and dogs
[1:12:34] I don't understand I mean blessed God
[1:12:37] bless brother Branson who has to teach
[1:12:38] them students I just I I don't know God
[1:12:42] that's why God didn't put me there
[1:12:43] because he knows I wouldn't be able to
[1:12:44] handle it I mean them kids identifying
[1:12:47] as dogs and cats and using the potty
[1:12:49] right I mean not even in the stall

[1:22:33] being scared to identify themselves with
[1:22:36] the message so they're taking down the
[1:22:38] pillar of fire they're taking down the
[1:22:40] cloud all because they're scared to be
[1:22:43] identified with this message scared to
[1:22:46] lose their congregation scared to think
[1:22:48] what what the world thinks about them my
[1:22:51] in order for the blood to work for you
[1:22:54] you must be identified by the blood in
[1:22:57] order for the message to work for you
[1:22:59] and your family you have to come under
[1:23:01] the message you have to be willing to be
[1:23:04] identified with the message
[1:23:07] amen you must have to want to be
[1:23:09] identified with a message
[1:23:12] don't Nick pit the prophet don't Nick
[1:23:15] bam man Nick pick this what he says
[1:23:18] about this and what he says about that

[1:23:30] is just pushing this way pushing that
[1:23:33] away she did nitpicking picky and being

[1:23:45] that's why
[1:23:46] that's why she don't want it if she's
[1:23:48] not hungry enough to want it she
[1:23:51] because she replaced his desire was
[1:23:54] something else
[1:23:55] amen you understand what I'm saying and
[1:23:58] it's the same with the people today see
[1:24:00] see no matter if you try to give my
[1:24:02] daughter something that she really likes
[1:24:04] she really likes rice and beans and when

[1:24:07] last night and she wouldn't take it she
[1:24:09] came no no

[1:24:13] she'd been snacking yes yeah well that's
[1:24:16] why she's already full
[1:24:19] and it's the same with people today

[1:24:31] time I'll go we'll see they're already
[1:24:33] full
[1:24:35] they're feeling those desires for God
[1:24:37] for something else maybe they're
[1:24:39] listening to this preacher T.D Jakes
[1:24:41] maybe they're listening to that or maybe
[1:24:43] they're listening to Benny Hinn see then
[1:24:46] they try to bring their ideas in but see
[1:24:49] it won't work you're nitpicking the
[1:24:51] message because you already uh been full
[1:24:54] you've already been feasting on
[1:24:56] something else
[1:24:58] you've got to become clean you've got to
[1:25:00] become empty for God to fill you
[1:25:04] amen it just tells me they're they're
[1:25:07] not hungry it just tells me they don't
[1:25:09] want it enough
[1:25:11] somewhere along the line they've been
[1:25:13] eating on what this other person said or
[1:25:15] what that other preacher preached
[1:25:16] instead of feasting on the word on what
[1:25:19] God sent for us in this day
[1:25:22] now see when you become hungry enough
[1:25:24] you you won't care if that barbecue gets
[1:25:27] all over your face you won't care about
[1:25:30] wearing the mashed potatoes a little bit
[1:25:31] because you be you were empty you were
[1:25:33] starving I tell my wife about when is
[1:25:36] supper gonna be ready I'm starving and
[1:25:39] she says well it's almost ready so so
[1:25:41] when she places that food man I can eat
[1:25:43] away I don't care about the barbecue
[1:25:45] sauce I don't care about what what that
[1:25:48] person thinks of me about what that
[1:25:50] person thinks of me all I know is this
[1:25:52] is good food and I'm going to indulge in
[1:25:54] it hey man you've got to be identified
[1:25:58] sometimes we have to wear our food to be
[1:26:00] identified with it it just happens
[1:26:04] amen and it's the same thing with the
[1:26:07] word of God you won't become hungry
[1:26:09] enough
[1:26:10] uh or you'll become hungry enough you
[1:26:13] won't care what this person says or what
[1:26:15] that person says when you're hungry
[1:26:17] enough you're just going to indulge in
[1:26:19] everything that God has for you oh you
[1:26:22] don't care if they have the idea lines
[1:26:24] up with what you believe you're gonna
[1:26:26] indulge in it you're gonna say thank you
[1:26:28] Lord thank you for that message amen
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:34] you have to be identified with every
[1:26:37] word of God
[1:26:40] identified with every word of God
[1:26:44] so God told Israel to take the Lamb's
[1:26:46] blood and apply it on the door
[1:26:49] for when I see the blood I will pass
[1:26:51] over you
[1:26:52] can you imagine
[1:26:54] if Israel had killed the lamb taken the
[1:26:57] blood
[1:26:58] and they put that blood in a jar
[1:27:01] and said well I killed the lamb like he
[1:27:03] told me to
[1:27:05] but I'll just put the blood over here
[1:27:06] because I'm not sure what my neighbors
[1:27:08] will think about it well I'll put the
[1:27:11] blood in a jar because I'm not sure what
[1:27:12] this person said will think about it
[1:27:15] see they're scared scared to be
[1:27:17] identified
[1:27:19] come on are you listening now
[1:27:22] scared
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:28] you have to be identified
[1:27:31] you have to be identified with
[1:27:33] everything God's God gives you
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:40] me spitting all over this is messing my
[1:27:43] iPad up so God told Israel to take the
[1:27:45] blood well I killed the lamb like he
[1:27:48] said well I'm not sure what my pastor
[1:27:50] will say well I'm not sure
[1:27:53] I'm not sure about this over here or
[1:27:55] that person over there you see it might
[1:27:57] make me shout a little bit what's you it
[1:28:00] might make me cry a little bit well I
[1:28:02] don't know I don't well is it really for
[1:28:05] this day is is that is the can you
[1:28:08] imagine God telling them to to kill the
[1:28:10] blood and apply it and your family will
[1:28:12] be saved can you imagine them going up
[1:28:14] to God and says God
[1:28:15] is that for us I mean you're talking
[1:28:17] about that's for us today I mean I just
[1:28:19] I just don't know come on now brother
[1:28:21] Brandon says and then when you take a
[1:28:24] person that doesn't believe that the
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost is for the day
[1:28:27] see what they're doing they are denying
[1:28:30] the token which is the very symbol of
[1:28:33] you being connected with your sacrifice
[1:28:36] see how high the token will work for you
[1:28:39] if you keep questioning it how can the
[1:28:41] token work for you if you keep
[1:28:43] questioning the token well I just I just
[1:28:46] don't know I just my sin is just too
[1:28:48] great I don't know just take God at his
[1:28:51] word
[1:28:52] if he says do it then you better do it
[1:28:56] take every promise and apply to your
[1:28:58] life apply it to your family
[1:29:01] come on now so Israel couldn't take the
[1:29:04] blood and sprinkle here or he couldn't
[1:29:06] just dab it over here God had to see the
[1:29:09] blood
[1:29:10] if he wanted to keep the death angel out
[1:29:13] of his home he had to make it visible on
[1:29:15] his door God had to see it everybody had
[1:29:19] to see it and it's the same today you
[1:29:21] can't just well I'm gonna take this idea
[1:29:23] well I'm gonna take that idea no no you
[1:29:26] got to be identified this blood has to
[1:29:29] be visible to everybody it don't care
[1:29:31] who sees it come on now
[1:29:35] God has to see the blood I know that's
[1:29:38] the only part that matters that God has
[1:29:40] to see the blood but sometimes your
[1:29:42] neighbor's gonna see it
[1:29:44] sometimes your church family is going to
[1:29:45] see him
[1:29:48] Hallelujah
[1:29:50] you could say God whatever it takes
[1:29:54] whatever it takes God I want the power
[1:29:56] to be over my family
[1:29:58] God whatever it takes I want that power
[1:30:01] of the blood to cover me
[1:30:03] I wanted to cover my home I want to be
[1:30:06] so lost in it Lord that all you see is
[1:30:10] the blood
[1:30:11] it don't matter who sees it
[1:30:14] God as long as you see it that's all
[1:30:16] that matters
[1:30:18] I wanted to cover my church friends I
[1:30:20] wanted to cover my church family my
[1:30:22] church my pastor Let It cover me Lord
[1:30:26] because without thou token it's
[1:30:29] impossible to come into that perfect
[1:30:30] fellowship with God
[1:30:32] without the token you're lost
[1:30:35] and when the believer began to take the
[1:30:37] blood and cover his door
[1:30:40] the eldest child could rest in peace
[1:30:44] because he knew that if the blood was
[1:30:46] applied over the door like God said it
[1:30:48] was
[1:30:49] it would be enough
[1:30:52] that boy said that blood would be enough
[1:30:54] as long as it's over the door that's
[1:30:57] enough for me that's good enough for me
[1:30:59] lift our death angel come
[1:31:02] the promise had become stronger than the
[1:31:04] death angel
[1:31:06] just like the bride today when you begin
[1:31:09] to put God's word into action when you
[1:31:11] begin to proclaim the message over your
[1:31:13] home you can watch the blood carry you
[1:31:16] through every trial you can watch the
[1:31:18] blood become stronger than your sickness
[1:31:20] come on I'm talking about the blood you
[1:31:23] go from gossiping to testifying of God
[1:31:26] come on you'll go from listening and
[1:31:28] singing to worldly music
[1:31:30] and singing oh the blood of Jesus
[1:31:36] you go from watching the movies the
[1:31:38] dirty movies into listening to the
[1:31:40] message I'm telling you it happens
[1:31:45] it will change your life forever
[1:31:48] it'll turn you from a sinner to a saint
[1:31:50] brother Bill is a witness to that I'm a
[1:31:53] witness to that
[1:31:56] that's what the blood can do
[1:31:58] that's what the blood has the power to
[1:32:00] do it'll keep you in your lowest time
[1:32:03] sister Jane
[1:32:05] when you feel like giving up and you
[1:32:07] can't seem to press on
[1:32:09] it'll be there to carry you
[1:32:12] it'll turn your sadness into Joy
[1:32:16] it doesn't mean that he'll keep the
[1:32:18] mountains away
[1:32:20] it doesn't mean that he'll keep the
[1:32:22] valleys away
[1:32:23] he's not going to keep the Giants away
[1:32:25] from you
[1:32:26] but he has promised to bring you through
[1:32:28] them
[1:32:29] he promised that you will have Victory
[1:32:31] if God before me who can stand against
[1:32:34] me if I am covered by the blood who can
[1:32:38] stand against me
[1:32:39] Revelations 12 11 says and they overcame
[1:32:42] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:32:45] word of their testimony they overcame
[1:32:48] them by the blood of the Lamb
[1:32:52] God has put confidence into you that you
[1:32:57] not might will overcome but you will
[1:33:00] overcome
[1:33:02] he's going to defeat Satan through you
[1:33:05] amen we've already read the back of the
[1:33:08] book and we've won
[1:33:09] you can't sell you can't fall
[1:33:14] sure the struggles sure we struggle sure
[1:33:17] he sees the failures
[1:33:19] but it's not how many times we fall it's
[1:33:22] about how many times we'll get up sure
[1:33:24] we're gonna fall we fall every single
[1:33:26] day but you gotta get up you gotta keep
[1:33:28] pressing the battle
[1:33:31] you've got to keep fighting for the
[1:33:33] blood will never lose its power as long
[1:33:36] as you have the blood you are victorious
[1:33:40] Satan will bring up your past
[1:33:43] but you'll have to remind him of his
[1:33:44] future
[1:33:45] you read the back of the book and we've
[1:33:47] won
[1:33:48] hey man and as long as you're under the
[1:33:50] token sin has no hold on you
[1:33:52] depression has no hold on you
[1:33:55] complexes has no hold on you
[1:33:58] as long as you're under the shed blood
[1:34:00] of Christ you remain Victorious
[1:34:03] but if that same spirit that raised

[1:37:07] of Jesus Christ all because he gave us
[1:37:10] the token the message of the hour to
[1:37:12] prove that he is the same yesterday

[1:37:58] says I want them for my own
[1:38:01] I want them as my child I want to
[1:38:04] express myself to him I want to express
[1:38:06] myself to sister Bethany how do I
[1:38:08] express myself to brother shamaya
[1:38:13] so we give you the token
[1:38:17] give you the token that you can be free
[1:38:23] brother Branham says I've often wondered
[1:38:26] what to do if I had a few drops
[1:38:30] that little blood of Jesus in a charger
[1:38:34] and cut it back and could put it back in
[1:38:36] my hand
[1:38:38] I thought how would I hold it
[1:38:40] how would I cherish it with my own life
[1:38:43] not just spoil or destroy it in any way
[1:38:47] but do you know in his side I have a
[1:38:51] greater
[1:38:52] than the blood of the Lord Jesus in my
[1:38:54] care tonight and that's the purchase
[1:38:58] of his blood and then he turns around
[1:39:01] and says
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:03] you
[1:39:04] are the purchase
[1:39:06] of his blood
[1:39:07] [Music]
[1:39:09] he gave his blood that you could be free
[1:39:11] that you could be his and therefore he
[1:39:15] would cherish you more
[1:39:17] than he does his own life
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:21] cherish you more than he does his own
[1:39:24] blood
[1:39:25] is because he gave his life
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:31] that's
[1:39:33] the power of his blood
[1:39:36] oh my
[1:39:39] so when you're covered you don't have to
[1:39:41] be scared about missing the rapture
[1:39:44] when you're covered you don't have to
[1:39:45] worry about tomorrow you don't have to
[1:39:47] worry about your children you don't have
[1:39:49] to worry about your husband or your wife
[1:39:53] whatever you have need of right now
[1:39:57] the blood still has power
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:00] to meet your need
[1:40:02] aren't you thankful for that
[1:40:04] the blood still has power to save
[1:40:06] brother Matthew
[1:40:07] [Music]

[1:40:12] story his testimony

[1:40:16] to a child of God I'm telling you the
[1:40:18] blood still saves the blood still works
[1:40:22] but not only has it come to cover us
[1:40:27] to make us free
[1:40:28] it's come to bring us back into that
[1:40:31] relationship that Adam once had and I
[1:40:33] know I keep saying this but I I Andrew
[1:40:36] called me brother Andrew called me uh

[1:40:43] yeah well you know what have you been
[1:40:45] studying on and I said well I've been
[1:40:48] studying about the blood but I told him
[1:40:49] I said I said brother Andrew I said
