Lord he is so worthy of our praise the elders and Angels bow the redeemed worship you now holy holy holy are you Lord you know we we have been given an opportunity to to see the Lord uh in in the most spectacular way than than the generations before us amen for he's been you know hidden but in this day he has he has revealed himself and we see him totally totally unveiled in in in the age that we're living in and we find that there's there's no room for personalities there's no room for Kingdom Builders there's no room it's left nothing but Christ alone and uh I am so thankful for that that when we sing such songs as this it's not just because we've heard about him 2,000 years ago but he has truly been revealed to us that we can openly declare openly see him that he is Holy he is worthy and I'm I'm so glad for that uh you can have your seats for just a moment uh I tell you we we had such a wonderful meeting um this year and it seems like every year it just gets better and um the ministry uh that was brought forth um was just really uh incredible and you would have thought that uh they all sat in a room and uh talked on what they were going to speak on uh but I believe it was all divinely orchestrated of God and all the ministers you know they said well we didn't know what the other one was going to speak on and but yet it was just continuity uh all the way through and and um I certainly appreciate uh ministers that will uh just lend their heart over lend themselves over to let the Lord speak and I truly believe that the Lord did I I believe that there were many many things that took place uh in in the services uh the prayer line uh this year it just seemed like uh it was so Supernatural um you know all of the uh you know I've been in prayer lines before and and uh helping with it and and there is there's just a power there but this this year it just seemed like it was greater than than I've ever seen before and U you know just um I've always been amazed you know here uh at at where at this the camp um you know I I stand in the front where the line is where it starts and and just kind of um uh direct you know helping the line to go you know to go um smooth smooth and um and you know I see them little guys uh how they they don't know why they're just there in the prayer line and uh maybe kind of looking around seeing what's going on and then they hit that certain spot um where that anointing is is at and and you just start to see them just cry and just then they don't really know why they're crying uh but this year um we've seen that but also uh seen some of them just just uh they they get to that certain spot and they can't stand and they're they're trying their best to hold on that to to you know and and end up just falling out and uh without hands being laid on them or whatever but it was just a a real Supernatural and uh one uh man you know uh had told a brother said you know it says I I it's been either a long time since we've been to a meeting or uh but he says I've never felt such a a presence uh like I did you know when went into that through the prayer line say there was just something that that I've never felt before he said and he said I've left a changed person and um so you know we we certainly appreciate that and we've got testimonies of uh and I'll read to you later about them of what God has done in in different individuals lives and so we we certainly appreciate the Lord uh uh working in a supernatural way from the beginning of the meeting to the end of it and uh I just love the Lord I want to just to say thank you to all um to all of you who helped in the meeting before the meeting during and then after uh uh and no matter what part you played whether it's just cooking something or or helping serve in the line or um whether it's prayer whether it's cleaning the restroom uh whether it's just uh helping with the ushering or working in the prayer line uh whatever you did it was no small task uh even the brothers with the golf carts uh uh helping bring the people down to the tent and with the parking um everything was so needed and it it it it was a a very very great blessing to us and uh to the to help the the meeting go smoothly and um I know it was a lot of work um but uh you you did it uh um willingly from the heart and to me that's what makes the difference and I believe that the Lord will um honor that and we'll will bless you in a in a great way uh the the food was just uh very very good and and um brother will you just do the best at chick cooking chicken it it was good and and we really appreciate you putting your all into that and he uh I heard the the pork just didn't get done at at that time but uh I want to help you with that too uh but we uh we appreciate brother will uh giving his time appreciate uh uh all the the leaders brother Tim uh taking that responsibility on his shoulders uh to get us all lined up on how to get that tent set right and I'm going to tell you that that tent uh endured a lot of wind and um rain uh before the meeting and there was not one sag in that thing I mean it it uh it went just really well and uh uh so brother Tim just really took it uh there and and helped us out and I really appreciate that and also helping us uh we were supposed to be taking the tent down today um and uh but due to the weather uh we uh in the forecast there we decided spur of a moment to uh take it down uh Friday evening and appreciate the brothers that were able to come and to help us and of course it went down easier than it went up and uh but we really appreciate that and appreciate uh Sister Kim weeks for uh taking that responsibility on getting all the food prepared and buying it and and preparing the menu and uh just making sure that everything just went smoothly appreciate you sisters for just endeavoring as the Bible would say keeping the unity of the spirit and I heard y'all just had a a a good time as far as a atmosphere was great and I appreciate that appreciate you Brothers putting when we put up the tent or even working uh just the past I guess we've been working the past month um some of us brothers and of course the sisters but endeavoring to keep that Unity of the spirit no matter you know of course when when you're all together and we're all working you know something some hurt feeling or some little thing will be said or whatever and but we always were able to squash it and U uh remember who we were and who we are and and uh I just appreciate that very much and I just say God bless you to all of you who have labored uh sister Martha taken that responsibility to um uh to put everybody up in the cabins and and and that's that's a responsibility in itself and a challenge and we certainly appreciate everything that was done and I hope I don't leave anyone out but um I just want to say that all of your work was very very much appreciated and um I uh thinking of Hebrews the 6th chapter the 10th verse where it says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and I believe that's what was done this past week was not only the ministry standing behind the pulpit but every every part was a Ministry ministering and um uh we we just certainly appreciate that very much and I um uh I will read uh one uh uh maybe a a a deal here uh from sister and she said words cannot describe the power of a long weekend in the presence of the Lord Jesus and fellow Believers we spent 30 Thursday through Sunday at Faith Tabernacle annual tent meetings with brother Shawn Martin with his brothers brother Wendell and brother Jonathan as well as others the preaching uh preaching the powerful message of Jesus Christ she said I didn't want to go I was so exhausted from three trips to Arkansas along with the grief and emotional and pH physical strain of supporting my grieving sister and best friend I just wanted to stay home sleep and cry but we packed up our family and drove the six hours and oh it was so worth it the campground itself is in a beautiful mountainous setting restful to the soul and body we camped in A Primitive uh cabin on the grounds with no driving for those four days just walking up and down the hills from our cabin to the tent and occasionally getting a lift on the golf cart to save my sore knee uh four days of no cooking or shopping the food was all prepared on the grounds by an amazing army of men and women feeding up to a thousand people four days of Glorious worship and word four days of amazing fellowship and sleep said I chose to sleep every afternoon instead of fellowshipping which if you know me is not typical but I needed to rest and restore and on the night of the prayer line I entered into the presence of the Lord and the Holy Spirit got a hold of me and I danced with arms raised like I hadn't even had shoulder surgery now my range of motion is so much better I feel stronger rested rejuvenated truly the Lord Jesus still does miracles in our day amen and that's just the one of many that have been coming forth from the the the meeting and so we certainly appreciate that I know uh I've asked brother Ronnie long to minister today uh due to just being busy setting every putting away everything and and uh we certainly love brother Ronnie very much and enjoyed his ministry so I he was gracious enough to come and but his wife uh just received a real touch of the Lord as well and been struggling for a few years in a certain area but God just totally delivered her uh this year and so we we just thank the Lord for that and um just God is good and uh so uh just want you to know your your efforts your labor is not in vain at all and uh we we love you and and I uh we love God's people we love the Lord Jesus Christ and um it's good to have Dad uh with us and Mom and uh dad came up well both come up for the meeting but Dad wasn't able to make it uh a couple times he was dressed to go and and just wasn't able to make it but um he's here this morning and so we're just really glad to to have him and um um but we could just stand to our feet and um and it's good to have our our visitor back there was and sister Bonnie as well uh good to have her back with us and and and uh sure love sister Bonnie uh very much and and uh just love God's people amen and uh how many's expecting God to speak to us this morning amen um we had cancelled service and we'll still have no service tonight but uh let's just put our all into it today this morning and may God just speak I enjoy that song enjoyed all the songs but thinking as brother Matthew was saying there just singing God just speak to our hearts amen I I want to know what God has to say and uh there's a lot that he has in store for us as his people and uh thinking of how that um uh you know when God in MDC in the form of Flesh he he said how can I keep my secrets from Abraham saying that he's my friend and I thought of that um uh and how how that God couldn't withhold the Mysteries he couldn't withhold them things within himself and as the Bible says the secrets of the Lord belong the secrets belong to the Lord but that which is revealed belongs to us and I say God reveal it to us today speak to our hearts amen praise the Lord so let's just sing the song Here's my cup Lord as brother Ronnie will come and share what's on his heart oh he here's my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quench this thirsting of my [Music] soul Bread of Heaven Fe Le me till I want no [Music] more here's my cup fill it up and make me whole sing it again here's my cup Lord [Music] tell [Music] and this thirsty of my soul bread of he feed me till I want no more here's my cup feel fill it up and make me whole amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your grace that's brought us here with a cup father and Lord you're not going to leave us empty but father you promis you'd come and you'd fill our heart's desire this morning Lord and we just ask you'd anoint this word to us father Lord that you'd open our ears and our understanding father that you'd anoint our lips father that you'd just be and every word that's spoken father may it have quickening power behind it father Lord many men can read texts and can read words but Lord it takes you the the life of the word to come and bring it to our hearts father and Lord that's our desire this morning that we would have a have a have a meeting with you father have a communion with you Lord may you come and fellowship with us now Lord and father we thank you for the mighty Works you've done Lord the testimonies we've heard Lord and the ones that are unfolding even now father we thank you for your hand in our lives father Lord we thank you for this assembly Lord that Lord has a heart for your people in this age Lord that beyond their comfort and Beyond what they think and understand Lord they realize that there's there's a Jesus on the inside of Flesh today and they want to serve him Lord father I ask that you bless them Lord that you would multiply abundantly father all that they've given Lord may you bring it restored H hundredfold father Lord that they would know that you are pleased with with the actions father and Lord for your Prophet taught us what hands do you have but our hands and what feet do you have but our feet Lord and we want to be found faithful Lord when you come back and father I pray that you bless this assembly Lord and all those that put their efforts to the wheel here father Lord is now as we look upon these words we just ask you the author of it Lord to come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name name amen amen God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord with you and know we just saw each other a couple days ago but we're back man that guy can cook chicken praise the Lord we thank you for all your efforts and of course goes without saying I just Echo what brother sea said that it's um there's something special in this time and age when you see people just just come together to serve God's people and I believe he's he's smiling upon it I believe he's pleased amen praise the Lord and we don't want to take too much time today but let's turn to the book of Hebrews the 2 chapter it's kind of like a message is kind of like cooking chicken you just need a little bit more time sometimes but but it all works out right we can't get to it all in one service but we're just going to uh enter into a portion here I'd like to speak for a few moments this morning on uh the voice of Grace Hebrews the 2 chapter but in one certain place the sixth verse testified saying what is man that thou art mine of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou mest him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands and thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him and he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory andon honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom all are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death and that is the devil and deliver them through through who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted amen may God bless this word this morning you can be seated so we read here in this passage of scripture that that that death is to be conquered but there is a process of this right there's a process process of this uh uh um overthrow of death and and so if we just kind of go back a little bit in in in this in this scripture we we know that in the beginning it was a perfect harmony with man and God and we could go back into Genesis and we could see where Adam had that relationship with God and where they communed one with another and you know you could just kind of put yourself in Adam's shoes where you're walking uh with your father through the garden and everything is calm and all is well and just kind of puts his arm on you and everything feels like it's going to be okay and you know just without a worry without a fear with you know he could he could command nature he could command the Seas he could he could do all the things that God could do for he was a God he was just as God was and and and and and to see that Interruption take place something took place to interrupt that and that was lost so we could say it Adam had dominion over something that we do not have Dominion of right now right and that would be the access to all those Dimensions so when when there was a fall that took place uh and this I know this is little Sunday school we we aware but I just want to background this a little bit but but there's a fall that took place and something was lost and fell down below where Adam could reach right there was there was something that fell down below where Adam could get to and he lost access to to what his Dominion was and now God God could just you know remain in those in those greater seven dimensions and he could go to and fro as he pleased but Adam lost access to those areas because he had fallen down and those keys if we could put it like that Keys fell down lower than Adam could get there right and they fell down below the reach of Adam and there there had to have been something to take place in order for that to be redeemed right and that's what brother brandom says that that's what time is is is it's a Plan of Redemption it's that's when time started and there was a there was an interruption in the eternal Circle where a Redemption plan would come to pass and brother B say that's all time is is it's just time for Redemption it's not it's not just a punishment or a sentence but it's a time of redemption for us that Jesus can restore back all that Adam lost right that's what the prophet said and all that Adam lost will be restored back to the church and I believe there's only one Avenue that is going to get restored back to the church and it's through the grace of Jesus Christ and somebody had to go and redeem back what Adam lost and bring it back to its original condition and this person would have to have the ability to not only descend for any man could descend that low but also Ascend so there would be a greater power than just to descend to the deeps but it would have to be a power that would be able to ascend back to restore back to where it once was so we we we can see through the fall of mankind that there was there's there every man that's ever been born under sin was was born shaped in iniquity uh you know full of trouble short of day speaking lies nobody had to teach you how to how to lie or how to steal or how to uh you know misuse your your your manipulation or nobody had to teach you how to do that but a child a very small child you can see that they will try to even manipulated a situation for their benefit and it's just something that comes naturally to them but I believe we're being restored back to a a supernatural people not just a natural relationship with our with our serpent nature but a supernatural relationship with where we came from to be restored back to that original where Adam was so there would have to be something that would take this man Jesus far enough down where he could access those keys cuz when Lucifer fell and he was cast out of Heaven he had those keys with him to those Dimensions right he had the keys with him to power over death hell in the grave and he took those down with him and they were in his ownership so every man from Adam on would have to to go by the doorway of those ke they would have to come under the submission of the one who held those keys which would be Lucifer himself to hold the keys to death Hell In The Grave right but I believe we're coming to an age and now now in that age where death has no power over the church hell has no power over the church but somehow this must have been redeemed back to man and not just one man but a group of Believers that would put on the mind of Christ so there's access to these Dimensions here but it would take a process of time in order for Jesus to go down there so we could just go on a little journey for for a little bit here on Jesus's walk and so God puts himself he puts himself into this man Christ Jesus and he's walking among flesh and he could have put of course we know you know the 42nd generation of Jesus Christ he could have put himself into Levi's tribe or you know anywhere he wanted but he put himself in judah's tribe where there was troubles and there was there was uh there was prostitutes and there was unbelievers and there was you know David and there was Tamar and there was ruths and there was and he put himself down into that line to prove a point that his grace would be greater than what we go through on this Earth and so he places himself into this line of Judah and by this Fallen root he's going to restore all of judah's names back onto the book right because Judah wasn't a very looked after name it wasn't very uh it wasn't the Priestly tribe it wasn't the ones that were reading the Scrolls or the pH the Pharisees sitting there but it was just plain old the line of Judah but that's where Jesus came and I thank God that he comes not based in our names or our our genealogy or what this Earth had for us before but he comes based on the heart that's within us by a seed he placed in there so he knew that the seed was in the line of Judah and he would take and place his name there in that line and so he comes into this line he begins to fellowship and I just I just started to think on these things that Jesus would put himself into flesh and and he didn't find you didn't find Jesus in the synagogue you didn't find him in the great church you didn't find him wearing a fancy suit or you know wearing fancy garments or driving a nice car or living in a nice house but you found Jesus among the common people that's that's where God likes to dwell as among the common people because we recognize as common people that we can't do this on our own there's no amount of merits that we could reach or amount of strength we could reach or amount of studying we could reach to to be able to have this restoration but we need him and that's why he comes to people that recognize we need him it's nothing we can do in our own strength but we are he came to the lowest of the low and I just you know if we take this journey with Jesus as he's walking along he doesn't find his disciples in the Seminary he doesn't find his disciples in the in the great riches or the tajma Halls he he finds them fishing somewhere and you know he goes to Peter who's who's maybe not even wearing clothes that day and he's out on his boat somewhere and he doesn't come to him with great words or great you know a great thunder lightning crossed across Peter's life but he just simply said hey Peter are you catching fish today what what are you doing out there why why are you here and began to just begin to to have a communion with him but he knew all along there was a seed within Peter and at the right time Peter would recognize who he was right so he didn't come to the churches and and to find that and I wonder where where we were when he came to find us and we have seeds within us and at some point Jesus is Jesus has crossed our path and ignited that seed within us and for a lot of us we were sitting in some church somewhere or maybe we were labeled a Methodist or a 7-Day Adventist or maybe we were in a church called the message of the hour that was the denomination but somewhere Jesus came across our path and spoke to that seed and we became awakened to that but Peter had already lived a life somewhere in his 30s and what happened to all of the sins that Peter had committed what happened to all of Peter's life and there he is and and and he becomes a friend to Jesus and then he denies him three times but yet Jesus has already prayed for him so what happened to that unbelief that Peter had committed what what happened to the denial of Christ so somebody had to be owed that right because somebody has the keys to those three things and they've got to have their their payment it would be it would be like if I if I asked Branson to borrow $200 and I said hey can I have $200 today to get home and you know he gives me $200 reluctantly but you know he he he sees that I need to get home and so I take the $200 I spend it I go home and I'm thinking I've got to pay him back the $200 but then Judah calls me and Judah says you know what that money you owee Branson you don't have to pay him back well that sounds good to me but Branson still owed the Money Right Branson still owed some money and and I've got to pay it back so who's going to pay the debt so then Branson's immediately going to call Judah and say hey where where's this money going to come from why'd you tell that guy I didn't have to you didn't I didn't have to pay him back where where's my money at see there was still a transfer took place and every sin that was ever committed somebody's going to have to pay the price for that sin it doesn't just disappear but where did it go where did that sin go but it had to go somewhere it had to go on somebody's account somewhere and and somebody would have to settle that debt it doesn't just disappear that we can't pay it but somebody had to make a payment for that sin and somebody somebody and I I thank God that one day I had a big long list and I Heard a Voice tell me you don't have to pay it back but I will pay the debt for you and everything that I owed up to that point was settled I don't know how he came up with the funds but it got taken care of and the accounts been settled and the same thing for every one of us that have gone through our life and gone through our Saga there's been a tab been racking up in our life of all the things that that that the devil would like to keep track on us right he let's just say it like this the devil's got a little black book and he likes to write down everything that we do and he follows us around and say well you didn't do that right and you didn't do that right and you didn't do that right so now we can recognize what voice we're dealing with when when we're we're fighting with ourselves on the inside and we say well just a failure we can't do that we can't do that well that's the influence of the devil that's following you around saying you're not doing anything right but he's he's writing it down according to his little black book right so Jesus didn't come to the ones that didn't that had a perfect record you know the Pharisees didn't have a very long book but they were greater Sinners than those that were out fishing and the publicans and because they didn't recognize who God was when he was in front of them and so we see Jesus came and he fellowshipped among people like you and I and I I I find great confidence in this brother Terry because it's not based on my works or my ability it's not based on anything I can do for him you know it our works are what we show in gratitude towards him but that's not why we're where we're at The Works have nothing to do with where we're at if we were going to stay in works we could have stayed back in Amish or menite or we could have stayed the the monks we could go over to overseas and their Works will outshine us a million times but it's not by works it's by grace and there's got to come something in our life that overrides our own thoughts about ourselves and Grace will take the place of the debt that we owe because if it was up to us we'd have ourselves chained up cuz we know ourselves right we know what a failure we are we know we know how we can't seem to do anything right and it just we just mess everything up and we'll talk ourselves out of every Victory we've ever had but Grace takes the place of how terrible we are and puts us where Christ is so Christ not only came to them where they were but he took them from where they were to where he was and so we can enter into this uh we'll just jump into an example here where Christ was was invited to a feast of the Pharisee right and Simon the Pharisee invited Jesus to his house now many churches are inviting Jesus this morning to their to their church assembly and many many homes are opening up and many many uh uh pulpits will be opened up to invite Jesus to their assembly but they invited Jesus there not knowing the power that he had within him and they invited him to make fun of him they invited him there to make fun of them you ever get into a situation where you know you're walking into the into a table of your enemies and you know it but you feel like you're to go there and that's where Jesus was where he was walking into a table of his enemies uh the the the the every every scorner every mocker was there to to pick on Jesus and brother brandham takes this in the message pride in campbellville Kentucky and he begins to describe what this Feast would look like and how how this Pharisee was so rich he had everything at his access for entertainment but but but he thought it would be fun to have Jesus there to make fun of him and it would it would be fun to have Jesus there to just let him sit there unwelcomed and with dirty feet and and and and and ashamed and unano and and try to make him feel like the small man in the room and you see that's how the devil works is he tries to Puff himself up so big in our life that he tries to make Jesus the small one in the room and and make him feel unwelcomed and and and unappreciated and and unwashed and I don't know about you this morning church but I'm not going to let Jesus sit there unwashed and in the corner somewhere with dirty feet but I came to the House of God this morning to wash the feet of Jesus because I recognize why I'm here and there was one there let's just put ourselves in that type of that woman where she recognized why she was there and she walked through the Hall of critics knowing she was going to be criticized knowing she was going to be attacked knowing what she was opening herself up into but within here there was a there was a calling coming out to say I've got to get to Jesus I've got to get to Jesus and no matter what the critics were saying about her and she was walking down you can just imagine brother Matt she walks in this room and and everybody knows her everybody knows it'd be like your life on display and everybody knowing every sin that you committed and every every deal that you did and she's walking through hearing all of these demonic influences attacking her you're unworthy what are you doing here you should leave why sh why are you here you shouldn't even come to church today you should turn around and go home what are you doing there you don't God doesn't hear your praise God doesn't hear your amen you see how the critics work and it just attacks our mind and our attacks and attacks and attacks so you're not alone in that but he does that to everybody are we okay this morning and he he his job is to criticize us so I think as a Church of God we should move beyond the critics because the critics are always going to criticize the critic is going to do what he does best and that's critic everything we do every move we make and you know what I'm kind of on the side where brother bam said that I'd rather be doing something for the Lord and make a mistake then not do anything at all and if we have to get a bigger eraser let's get a bigger eraser but an eraser is humility a eraser is something that we can come down and say you know what I messed up there but I'm not giving up I'm going to get back up and I'm going to do it again because God had given grace to the church he knows we're imperfect he knows we don't do everything right he knows that it's not by our ability but he wants to see a bride in action taking him at his word and moving into the plan of God so let me say you're going to make mistakes you're going to make the wrong call sometimes you're going to handle something the wrong way but don't give up get back up and use your eraser and say you know what Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I did this wrong I'm sorry I'm just forgive like brother B would say forgive your stupid servant but get your eraser and then get back up because mistakes will happen you'll handle something wrong we're human beings if if we could handle everything right we wouldn't have need a Plan of Redemption to come but the fact that we're in time proves that we do need Redemption and we do need somebody greater than us and he's not expecting us to be perfect you know you can search this through the message you will never find brother brandham says the term sinless Perfection because it's not there brother brandham doesn't teach it like that he doesn't show adoption like that it's not about our works it's not about how good we can live it's about accepting the grace of God in our life that it overrides our own will our own ability Our Own Strength our our our strength is made weak in his presence right because we want his strength we want our our weakest moment to be our strongest one in his presence and what would be the point of that if we could do it ourselves but we can't so God's trying to show us something it's by his grace it's by him and him alone so something would have to be greater than what the critics were saying and this woman there she she didn't she didn't just sparingly we know the story so well she didn't just sparingly go out and buy the cheapest oil at Dollar General no she could buy but she knew the importance of the man that was sitting there so when we come to the house of God it's not just about how good we can sing or who's songling or who's preaching or who's who's playing the piano today or what are we going to eat for lunch after service or who's there or who's not there but recognize why you're coming to this place is not to not to so much shake hands with one another but there's another being in the room that is greater than anything we could ever achieve in this life if we could recognize that every time we come into His presence to say what can I do for you Lord how can I serve you how can I worship you better how can I wash your feet and not so much what he can do for you but what can you do for him because we know he's able to do whatever we have need of we know that he's the able one we know that he can come and change the situation we know that whatever Darkness we're facing one thing we know that God can change the situation now our question to him is what can I do for you how can I worship you how can I wash your feet how can I anoint you how can I give you reverence how can I give you praise how can I do better than I did yesterday to serve you in a greater portion that's our desire as a Christian Church not to not to just you know I think sometimes we look for the power of God to to to magnify our own individual testimonies and that's not what God's after he's not over Great Men he's not after uplifting men God will never share his glory with any Ministry with any man with any woman with any sister but yet God uses hands to deliver his his healing and to deliver his portion and to deliver his anointing he uses hands but he cares not for the hands he's just looking for Willing servants brother bandam himself the greatest servant in this age would say the greatest gift I have is surrender to get out of the way and let God be God in Me and I find that we would be a lot further on in our in our happiness a lot further on in our joy if we just let God be God in us if God wants to use you to sing let him use you if God wants to use you to shout let him use you if God is in your hand raised let him let him be in your hand raised if God's in your working in your cooking and your delivering and you're singing and whatever it is let it be used by God and let God handle the rest and don't search after the gifts let let God use you how he wants to use you God will use gifts God will use singing God will use preaching God will use laying on of hands but let God be God don't try to force God to do something because then we're making it about ourselves and not about God but we've got to relax and let God be God in the church right we come to the church with anticipation and and and and it creates a pressure on us if we're not careful that there's so much anticipation to get this right and get well I'm speaking to the right group this morning you guys just put on a church hosting a thousand a thousand people for what six Services it was and there's pressure that comes with that there's a pressure around that to we there's so much anticipation and and even something that's unspoken that you know you just feel this Force on there but let God be God because you're going to make mistakes Judah you're going to make mistakes sometimes the microphone's going to go but you don't quit you just fix it and you move on and next year you learn again and you don't quit but you get back up and use your eraser and you get back up and keep going that's what God wants is servants who are willing to get knocked down and get back up because by his strength we're made perfect we're not quitters we're not Giver ERS we're not going to turn around we've come way too far in our journey to turn around now but we're marching on with Christ why would we give up now when we've come so far why would we turn around now when we can look back at all of the mountains that he's brought us through why would we turn around now when we see it's just a couple more turns of the road and I believe we're going to overcome this thing let's not look back to where to to to everything that we could say well well we we messed up there we messed up there we messed up there we messed up there God knows that he knows we messed up brother will he knows our inabilities but his Grace is greater than our mess ups his grace is greater than everything that we could do in this life so this woman realizes this is she's walking to Jesus's feet and and and she's she's in herself having this inner Battle of all of my critics they know everything about me and there they are they don't even recognize the presence of Jesus in the room then this woman walks in and oh this will be a good show if he's a prophet if he's a real man of God you know and his disciples were fighting him at the same time they he just preached against Pharisees he just had preached against dealing with these religious spirits and and and in high places and yeah he then he gets invited to this feast and he says I'll go and I can imagine Peter saying what do you mean you're going to go you just told us that that's the wrong thing to do he says but there's one there he doesn't go anywhere unless first his father shows him to go and he must have had a vision that he'd be sitting at that Feast of the Pharisee but there'd be one Soul there and he went anyway and his disciples Josiah were telling him don't go it's a trap don't go they're they're going to ridicule you they're going to mock you they're not going to wash your feet they're going to embarrass you it's you preached against this and now you're going to go and have fellowship with him but he doesn't go anywhere unless first his father shows him and he went on a mission there to find one and that's how great my God is is he'll he'll forsake his reputation he'll forsake all of his his Earthly critics he'll do anything to go get to that one because that's all he cares about because you know why in just a few years all those critics were dead but that little woman there had eternal life and all those critics will cease to exist one day but that little woman there will always have life because he was able to forsake what they thought about him to come to that one and so she finds herself pouring her pour bring her anointing oil and I love how brother bam says this he says she she thought all she had to bring was that oil and she spent her life savings on it and she thought that's all she had to give but yet brother BR said there was more she could give because she furnished the water and the towels and as her glory began to fall upon his feet and she began to wash him and I wonder how many times as Christians we forget why we're here we're not here to look good or prestigious or better than anybody else but let's let our Glory fall and wash his feet and let him be the master in the room it's not about how great we are or how big we are but let God be God and recognize who's in the room that's right she began to worship and wash his feet and began to cry out and you know and and and and and the devil's right there behind her with this big list I mean if it was a list it probably would have been a scroll going down the road this sin this sin this sin this sin and there she is washing his feet amen what about this what about this what about this you ever feel that you ever feel that when you Worship the Lord and you feel what about this what about that where's that coming from it's not coming from God but there's another voice speaking to us and this devil was tempting her and tempting her and giving her every every reason to just walk out and say you know what today wasn't the day I tried but I'm going to go ahead and walk out imagine if that woman would have turned around and walked out in the middle of that worship she would have never heard the words that would set her free from that bondage but there was something greater that was there than all of those cuz by the Jewish custom she would have been stoned right there was more on her there was enough ammunition there to Stone her where she would never live another day and it was all true that's the thing about it is it was all true and they had her they had her pinned to the wall and they they were getting ready to Stone her but there was a voice that cried out greater than the laws now who wrote those laws where did the where did the Jews get those laws so who wrote the Ten Commandments well God did right it was the Finger of God that wrote The Commandments and handed them to Moses on the tablets so those are God's morals right those were something that he wrote down but but yet when the children of Israel the very same the very same moment were defying those laws and God was going to wipe them out and said get out of the way Moses I'm going to destroy him and Moses said no Lord yeah but your grace well wait a minute he just wrote those laws what's greater than the law of God there's got to be something greater than the law there's something greater than just what God just wrote that down fresh but yet in the same moment something interrupted that that said it was greater than the law of God and it was Grace Sovereign Grace moved in and it was greater in the mind of God than even his own law right cuz that woman would have been stoned but yet Jesus is sitting there and knows the law he knows the Scrolls he he knew what his father had wrote about it he knew what they were preaching in the synagogues and yet he told her the greatest words that a human being could ever hear thy sins which are many are all forgiven are all washed away and I church that would be the greatest thing I could ever hear and if we're searching for a word from the Lord there's not a greater word from the Lord than that thy sins which are many are all forgiven are all washed away thy unbelief which is much is all washed away because there's no greater voice than the voice of Jesus crying grace to the church because he has the authority over the law and with the law would have us bound Grace came in and took its place and said thy sins are forgiven thy mistakes are forgiven thy iniquities are forgiven Thy Thy Thy unbelief is Forgiven All Is Forgiven when he comes and speaks over your issue that's the word from the Lord we're looking for for and it doesn't come from just an individual or just some preacher with a microphone don't take it from me but the voice of Grace has cried in this age and it's cried greater than the law something [Music] greater greater than the law has come in and I thank God because if it were up to us we would all be bound by the law and tell me who in here could keep every Everything of the law who in here is perfect Church order every time go through the Cod book can you keep it in perfect time every time is your life worthy of the Gospel you listen to that message and you realize you're not as good a Christian as you thought you were what is it it's you can't fulfill the law you cannot in your this flesh and this Fallen nature fulfill the law but Grace has come into an age to take the place of that Grace has come in Hallelujah 1 John 3 would say behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God am what a statement what manner of love is this amen that's right therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not am what manner of love is this I think about this what manner of love with a man that had no no ties or no relationship naturally to that woman a prostitute woman that she should have been stoned but yet he spoke over her that money you owed him you don't owe him anymore where did it go amen where did that long list of sin go amen I had to go somewhere amen yes there was a man sometime in the 1940s his name was Daniel Curry preacher right you know the story and he had a dream that he was a good man kept his life right kept everything up and the up and up the paperwork looked good and he had a dream that he died and went to heaven and there he comes in his in his version of this of this Heaven he's walking up to the white pearly gates and and there's there's Peter St Peter at the gate and he walks up there you know he's thinking my life's right you know I'm ready for this I I've been waiting for this I preached your law I preached it I I've I've held to the word and he gets up to the gate and there the the saint at the gate is says now what's your name he says Reverend Daniel Curry no no I don't have that name amen goad uh D Curry no no I don't see that name I've actually only got one name on this list and it's not Daniel Curry are you sure yeah yeah no you're going to have to be sent to the Judgment next and he goes on his way and I know it's it's little little Christians it's the greatest fear in the world is the white Throne judgment and it's the greatest fear that some people ever face but I thank God that I'm not going there I thank God that I'm not going to a judgment where he's going to have to look over everything I've done but the bride's being judged right now by the power of the Holy Ghost and so he goes to this judgment and there's the great judge there and he's looking through the list he says you know Daniel Curry did you did you ever did you ever lie well yeah I guess I have did you ever covet your neighbor possessions yeah yeah I guess I have you can just see he began to recognize his insufficiency sure did you ever do anybody bad in a business deal did you ever steal candy yeah yeah I have you ever you ever looked upon something that wasn't yours and coveted it yeah yeah I guess I have and he began to have that moment there that's the wrong time to have that moment I'm insufficient amen I'm not going to make it by my works and my abilities and my strength and all of a sudden he wasn't Reverend Daniel Curry anymore he was just a he was just a a little man begging for the mercy of God and he began to cry out I I just kind of put myself there in his shoes and you can just see him there he's I spent my whole life serving you I I preached your word but yet in this presence I recognized it was all just my works it was all just something I was trying to do it was something I was trying to be strong enough to overcome and I was trying to be you know and it was all I I I I right and in that presence that Sovereign Grace Just sweeps in and he begins to recognize all of his inabilities and begins to cry out Lord Lord is there any way and the judge says by the by the power of the law I've got no I've got no other choice but to send s you to a grave of hell and as he began to lift the gavel he said in the dream a voice rang out in that dream and it was sweeter than any mother's voice he'd never heard and he said wait on Earth Daniel Curry stood for me and now I'll stand for him and he began to Rejoice within himself and he turned to look and it was the face of Jesus Christ something greater than the law that the judge was about to ring Cried Out across his life and said there's still Grace for you I thank God this morning church there's still Grace for us there's still a mercy seat he's still he's still interceding on our behalf before the father we're not in this uh it's not it's not a failure that's right but there's Mercy for us there's Grace for us there's there's a way out for us he's made a way for us in that voice sweeter than any mother's voice oh Church we're not preaching disgrace I I hope you understand where I'm at yes amen amen but to think that something greater than your own sins and inabilities to cry out that he wrote the law he was the one wearing the wig and he was about to send the Judgment but it depends on what side you're on right and in our day I could say it like this Elijah fulfilled a twofold purpose Elijah came to judge the Earth but Elijah also came as zerubabel and zerubbabel's message to the church was Grace Grace Grace Grace so which side of it are you on are you on the side of judgment or the side of Grace I don't know about you friends but I want to be on the side of Grace because I know if it was up to me I would fail with the law if I was on the law side of it I would be cast down forsaken thrown into a fiery furnace there's no way I can uplift that but on the grace side I can say thank you Lord for your grace in my life thank you for your provision thank you for your mercy thank you for your goodness because you made a way when there was no way oh my brother Ram says now the great chain of perfection was broken by time and space and time came because of sin let's draw this picture of time let's see this perfect circle then all at once the sin dropped in and and and and the wife calls it like a little hickey and so eternity comes on into but it's not in its perfect condition there's a little Gap that comes down and breaks over this way and goes out this way and God had to do do that because Satan caused it so you didn't cause it Satan caused it and it Dro down to a space of time for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost that God by his Sovereign Grace somebody say grace gra might someday lift that little hicke or Gap back into the perfect circle and then she rolls on just the same time now this time is the little loopit Loop down and Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but he stepped into the time space and was made flesh and come through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood across all this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again for all eternity he says that's all time is brother Terry what a statement that's all time is the greatest enemy that the Earth has ever known was put here so that we could have a pathway back to [Music] God where did Daniel Curry's sins go about it he just read him off this this this this this but yet a voice cried out and said no put it on my account put it on my charge not put it under my name put it there on that name on that list put it on that name you ever been eating somewhere at a restaurant and you go to pay your bill find out it's already been paid Lord what do you mean it's already been paid there over the weekend I was getting I was getting coffee and brother Sean just happened to be in front of me and I get up to the window and they said it's already been paid I said Praise Jesus it's already been paid now what about your list of sins when you go and you think in in the dread of having to pay for that list and the dread of knowing what you've done in your life but yet knowing it's already been paid four oh Hallelujah now the right nature you know brother Sean says well I'm going to buy you coffee and I ordered 10 coffees well that would be disgrace right you think well he's paying for it anyway I didn't do that but well I probably did order 10 coffees but it wasn't for me but you see we're not preaching disgrace where you think oh it's been paid for I'm going to go live out and live any way I want to and live but it's all about our love relationship with the Lord and when you actually love somebody you would do anything but hurt them you would do anything above all you would you would you would die out to yourself a million times rather than hurt somebody you really love but yet how many times have we failed to do that but Our intention was to to live right Our intention was to be right Our intention was to serve God the right way but when we can't do it Grace comes in right when we can't fulfill it all the way Grace comes in and I thank God that there's a portion of Grace there I thank God that we can put our name there surely he ha borne my griefs where' they go amen something had to be heavy enough to take him all the way down to the lowest parts of the earth and as he's walking the Earth and he's fellowshipping with people and he's you know he's taking friendships on and he's you know he's meeting one another and he's carrying on the everything that's on their tab is coming to him it was like he was walking around the restaurant grabbing tickets that's right yeah amen hey I'll take that tab hey give me that put it in his pocket where' they go but somebody would have to pay for that somebody would have to pay for that that that debt that was owed right so we know that we know the for the sake of time you know the the scene of Calvary and and he's walking down the road to to to galtha and and there brother brandom kind of types it like that cross knocking on those cobblestones amen they say the cross piece on that cross weighed 300 lb here's a man 140 lb what was so heavy well this one and that one and this one and that one he's walking down the road and he's looking at this face and that face and this sin and that burden but not just that but they put him up up on the cross and in agony he's there crying out and you could go read psalms 22 when you have time and enter into the suffering of Jesus my bones they stare at me my tongue it Cleaves to my mouth I can I can count my bones my flesh is torn from me my God my God Amen what was so heavy well it was just the sins of those people no it was the sins of the world brother bham goes into a little restaurant one time and there's a woman with with blue hair carrying on and and being unrighteous with other men and he he begins to rebuke them in his Spirit thinking oh this is just trash of humanity even a prophet misjudging his situation but God corrected him thank God that he was man enough to tell us because this story means a lot to us and there he goes off in the corner and and and and God drops him into a vision and there he's caught up and he sees the Earth is with this fog over it and there's these black Shadows coming out of it and and and there are these great sins are crying out and there's Jesus on the cross over the Earth and there he is on the cross reaching out and grabbing those shadows and taking them into himself and and the prophet thinking well is that just is that the sins of the world and the voice tells him no that's just your sins oh God oh God help me to think that a man like William brandham that is so Vindicated time and time again to be kept from drinking kept from smoking kept from carrying on with women kept from all these things and yet his sin was even reaching out where Jesus would have to grab it and take it in where does that put us the regular person walking on the earth and in himself he began to feel the the the humbleness of the spirit and say oh God I'm sorry and he said now you're judging that woman and look at the sins that you've committed he said God forgive me God let me have Grace and there he went back to that woman and led her to the Lord there by the spirit of Grace that came in the room and where he once would have just thrown her out as the trash of humanity but yet he came back because God showed him I go nothing and nowhere until first my father shows me and by a vision she was led to the Lord that there was still Grace for her and so while they were there 2,000 years ago and there was a man on a cross he didn't move his hands were pinned his feet was pinned but yet in another dimension he was moving grabbing the sins of today that was in 1950 something here we are and 2024 and yet even now the sins of today he's reaching out and he's reaching out for that sin and taking it into himself to absorb what we could not do he is paying the price for that there's their tab let me take it into myself there's their debt let me take it into myself and he begins to move on our behalf even now this morning and even on our way to church and the thoughts that we've had yesterday but there's going to come a time when the last bride member will sin for the last last time I believe we're very near the time when the last sin will be committed and he'll reach out in another realm and here we are in this little hickey of time and there he is right now sitting on the cross reaching out and grabbing that sin and he's going to say it's finished it's finished the Redemption cycle is finished I've done it I fulfilled it I I've took on the sin of man and I've took it unto myself and he descended down to the lowest parts of the earth why that is when the work began and he goes up to the devil's house and you can imagine all the demons in hell and there's anxiety in the corner trembling he's here and there's depression over there he's here and there's cancer he's here and he's walking down the halls of Hell going straight to the to the one who holds the keys and he's saying this weight that I bore took me all the way down here but I'm not staying here I'm not going to stay here and there he takes the takes to the door of Satan and Satan's turning [Music] latches and he kicks open the door of death and hell oh yeah I believe it's real I believe it's happening we think of this 2,000 years ago it's right now it's happening right now and he kicks open the door of Satan and and he has the keys there on his hip and say says wait a minute I'm old Adam fell I'm old there's a big there's a big list that's got to be paid and Jesus says turn to your list well let's turn to let's turn to Mary Magdalene this was old her I was there when it happened I wrote it down I was there let's turn let's turn to Josiah McClaren it was there I was there when it happened where did it go where did it go and right then Jesus began to raise up Hallelujah I am the sinless Son of God I have never sinned a day in my life although sin was on me it was not in me but I used it as a carrier to get down here to where you were so that I could fulfill the Plan of Redemption for mankind so that I could fulfill the Plan of Redemption for my seed after me and after Abraham that we could be restored back to Eternity and just about that time the cross was still dripping with his blood it worked its way down through the Rocks as it were and a big red drop began to drop on the on the Black Book of Satan and your name was erased and blotted out of his book Satan doesn't even know your name because the power of the blood came and erased every memory that you ever were on the book you have no entry on the book of sin because the blood of the sinless one came and erased and washed it away Satan doesn't know your name he doesn't know where you're at he doesn't know where you live why because the blood the blood made a way when there was no way he came and washed it away and Satan there looking at his red blood now just washed over his book and Jesus says now give me the keys give me those keys and ripped off the keys to your overcoming power and arose with them on his way out he knocked by a few [Music] doors I'm here I'm here he began to preach to those Souls that were lost before why didn't you listen to Noah why didn't you listen to William brandom's message why didn't you listen to Enoch's message why didn't you listen to Elijah's message and began to preach to those that had fallen on but then he turned another door and brother B says job opens the door and throws on the door says there he is he lives I knew I'd see him in my flesh there's the one that I saw when the lightning was flashing all around me and I thought I was just on an ashy for the rest of my life I didn't know where I was going to go what I was going to do where I was going to turn out there's so many decisions to make it but there he is there's the one where the lightning and the thunder rolling there he is he says Abraham look who it is and Abraham runs to the door it's him it's the one Sarah look who it is and brother Braham says in the mighty conqueror that Sarah looked and said it's the one that we had dinner with at the tent door it's the one that we had bread and wine with it's the one that we killed the fatted calf with it's the one I see him and Ezekiel came behind them it's the one he's the wheel in the middle of the wheel in Isaiah he had borne my griefs it's the one I saw he's here and Jesus begins to share with him all that's taking place while they were in paradise and then he pulls out the keys your rides here your ride has come your flight has come it's time to get on board we're going out of here and the Bible says that they ascended with him out of the Grave because he had power over hell in the grave and they ascended all the way up lift you up oh Everlasting Gates who is this king of glory as they ascended the ramp parts of Heaven what is it it's the keys over these Dimensions that tie us down it's been returned to the church and when he arose he gave gifts under man what were those gifts not just the spiritual gifts but gifts over death hell and the grave Hallelujah and they're yours the keys are here who made the law of the gravitation of the planets what being would be powerful enough to cause the sun in orbit and the moon and hold the Earth in Perfect Balance well God would have to do that but what gave Joshua the authority to speak to the son and say son stand still greater than the law the orbits that God had put into motion was the voice of Grace that cried out from Joshua to say son stand still and it obeyed him who made the law of gravity what is this law of gravity well God put it there right but what happened when Enoch was walking with God the lawmaker was walking with a with a son amen and that conversation got so charged in the anointing it got so uplifting in the word they got right to where we're at I be I believe that the seals were breaking under Enoch and he began to see the full Plan of Redemption in God's mind and he began to get rapturing Grace faith and that rapturing Grace Faith Came Upon him and just as they were walking down the road that Grace that was in Enoch's life became greater than the law of gravity who made the law L God did but he is the grace and when you're walking with Grace it's greater than any condemnation it's greater than any any other authority out there even his own law and you can say by the law I should be condemned and you're right but Grace has rang across the church Grace Grace Grace to the church it's Grace over our Lives why would we look to judge one another and judge this so many quotes on this but I'm just preaching this morning that's okay praise the Lord so many so many quarrels and back bitings and but how did you get here by Grace why are you where you're at today Grace I know I do not deserve to be where I'm at I do not deserve to be in a church and have a sound mind and to have a beautiful family and to have friends and loved ones I do not deserve that but Grace has intervened in my life and more than that I do not deserve a token to Eternal Kingdom I do not deserve this key that I have to rapturing Faith but I'll take it by Grace I'll claim it by Grace I'll say I'm already healed by Grace maybe you think I don't deserve to be healed and maybe you're right but Grace says otherwise well I don't deserve to have an overcoming life I'm just a failure but Grace says otherwise let Grace be the voice in your life cuz it's greater than what you would say about yourself but the blood has a voice and it's Grace grace to the church that we're not under condemnation or bondage where men have been under bondage for all of all of time cycle but the cycle breaker has come the cycle breaker has come into time and disrupted Grace he said it I read it Grace will restore us back to Eternity it's Sovereign Grace amen amen how'd the devil get down there he doesn't go any anywhere unless first the father shows him you mean that that was a vision in in his mind to go down there and take the keys how else would he have the strength to say not my will oh but thine be done he knew the Plan of Redemption was coming to fullness he knew that there would be those ones that he picked up along the way and even us here today looking on us what manner of love is this as he as he dragged that cross up that hill what manner of love is this amen a greater suffering than we could ever imagine you think about sometimes sometimes we come to church so burdened with our cares so burdened with our worries and how's this going to work out and I don't see a plan out of this and you think about that that's just you an individual well then take on this whole church and then take on every church out there and then take on the disciples he was walking with and every every age that would come between them and us right a greater suffering than we could ever imagine what manner of love was this I pr you'd preach something deeper than Calvary I don't think it gets deeper if you can't see the seven seal in this you don't understand it it's Christ in this age what is he doing what is he doing in this age he's revealing himself to the church he's revealing himself to the bride how is he doing it by Grace because you studied hard enough no brother Sean you devoted your entire life to the gospel you've you've not studied that hard to find where God would come in but by Grace every Theologian out there brother Terry your whole life been devoted to this you know you couldn't do it sorry you know you couldn't do it on your own but Grace any man who tells you I've got that I've got the revelation of this it's by Grace it's not because we studied it's not to him that willth or him that runneth it's by God that showeth Mercy my grace is sufficient for thee so tell me what sin is too great for that Grace Hallelujah hallu we've just gone through a couple of witnesses a couple of testimonies that have Mong reports on them and you tell me what sin in your life is too great for that Grace Peter denied him three times on but he said worry not Peter my grace is sufficient for thee my grace is suff we're going to stumble we're going to make mistakes we're going to fall apart we're going to get clouded Vision we're going to worry about this and worry about that but tell me what is greater than the grace of God what is greater than the mercy see he had what manner of love is this that he had bestowed upon the church he knows he knows the situation you're in he's not alarmed by it he's not shocked by it but his grace is greater than that his grace is greater than any mind battle that we will face his grace is greater than any depressive spirit that would try to take us down his grace is greater so what are we claiming the law or Grace brother bradam said you're a church this morning and you're choosing law or Grace my church in here decides I'm going to choose Grace Grace Grace Grace what the law could not do Grace has already done I could not keep it but Grace made a way for me there has to be something greater than just the works of the ages Revelations the 4th chapter after this age I looked Leo TOA Behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard whereas it was a trumpet talking with me come up hither and I will show you these things which must be Hereafter what was it it was Grace to John amen it was Grace to John what cried out it was a voice Grace come up higher John come up out of those ages come up out of that Darkness come up out of that confusion come up out of that battling come up out of that and take on Grace become Grace that's right I don't know if you know this or not brother but you're John you're John in the book you are coming up higher out of the ages into Grace and right after that is Revelations 5 right when every man wept because they knew the list that was in front of them of all of their sins and iniquities and John said I I there's no way for it to be fulfilled there's no way we can have this he said but oh a voice said to me weep not John weep not bride Hallelujah thy sins which are many weep not bride this isn't your destination but you've got another destination coming weep not about what you see here but look beyond that weep not John and he said I heard a roar come from behind me it was the Roar of Grace and he said when I turned to look as if it were a lion I saw a lamb cloning in humility clothed in humility coming to Bear the the burdens of the world but no man was found worthy to open the book but Grace came in and made a way to open the book and that same John who was who was in the darkest of Ages who came through all of those ages be before him that same John when he recognized that there was a Grace for him and where that blood had blotted out his name on The Devil's book that same blood had wrote his name in the Lamb's Book of Life and John got so beside himself he didn't care what the critics said said he didn't care what anybody else around him said he didn't care about his own unbelief he didn't care about his own doubt and unworthiness he said Glory holy holy holy is the Lamb holy is the Lamb that's right what was it it was Grace I see it it's Grace together it's come in for me it's made a way for me it's Grace Grace Grace how would I ever be there but by Grace Jesus walked with with with with John John knew what it would take to live a perfect life I can't do it but Grace amen it was Grace thank you Father Bram said when you get there if you don't see me you just listen and you'll hear me somewhere down by the stream of life in a little old cabin somewhere singing amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound is saved a wret like me you tell me a Vindicated man like William Brandon would have to sing the voice of Grace over there then you and I better be singing it as well here Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound the saved a wret like me how would I ever be there amen amen how would I ever get there that's right but by Grace amen How would how would you ever attain that kind of riches and Glory brother baram said you would like to write a check but you ain't got the money that's right it would take one with the money with full Authority all that Adam lost would be restored back to the church and I believe that took place in our age right in our time right to this church I can't speak for everybody else out there but I believe that this vision of the Bride of the message of the hour is rapturing Faith I believe it will Rapture the church and I don't it's going to be one day we'll be driving down the car the the road in our car and all of a sudden there's no driver there but I believe under the anointing of the message of the hour it's the only place where we can come in and get lifted up enough out of this Dark Age that we're in to rise above Le O deia to rise above the chaos of the world to rise above our own inabilities and rise up into Grace and every time he comes on the scene he's fixing to do something there at Abraham's tent when mzc came down and fellowship with him Sarah's body was changed Sarah's body got changed under that anointing every time mzed comes and there in the lower parts of paradise when that when that door knocked and there she said there he is the one at the tent door her keys were there Sarah's body got changed one more time and I believe right now in this age Sarah Sarah you better get ready you better get ready give me that picture of that cloud you better get ready mecdc has come one more time and every time elaz comes Sarah's body's fixing to get changed and I believe a voice of Grace has come out from the center of that cloud and saying grace to the church you better get ready you better lay aside every weight you better let it go you better drop it because I am coming come up higher out of it come up higher out of it grace to the church I believe Sarah's body's getting ready to change I believe we're getting ready to get sent back to our perfect picture I believe we're getting ready to send back to the eternities out of what Adam lost the keys are here a prophet messenger came in our day and was Vindicated by that the keys your rid's here it's here the keys already in the ignition the gas is in there the Dynamics mechanics all you've got to do is turn the switch all you've got to do is push the button it's ready it's liftoff time 76 5 4 3 2 1 countdown is on it's liftoff time Church Grace has come into an age it's taken over what you cannot do you've got no control of this because Grace has taken over your life what you committed to God let no man put us under because God is in control of this situation God is in control of your life you think oh I don't know how I'm going to get out of it you're not going to get out of it but Grace Will Make A Way Grace always makes a way when they were at the Red Sea and Moses said I don't know what to do I don't know what's in front of me a pillar of fire came down and Grace made a way for them to to get out of the devil's snare oh with this snare the devil's got me and is too great it's greater than God's grace really oh no but God's word is more powerful he that is in you is more greater worry not Peter oh but you don't know what I've thought you don't know this is an age we're living in friends this is a time like we have never seen no man before us what is it it's the finishing the culmination of the ages together and God is doing something that he has never done before praise the Lord I believe the third poll is in effect sir when you get time go listen to the message Look Away to Jesus and brother banam brings down the effects of the third PLL and he says that was five evidences g r a c e come on now at our church a couple months ago there's a young man lived in church his entire life 35 years old introverted doesn't talk to anybody leaves right after service comes in late I I've had two maybe two words with him but Grace made a way for him and there at the end of one service he came up for prayer I said I've never seen this brother come up for prayer brother Josiah we didn't have to touch him we didn't lay hands on him he said I need the Holy Ghost and the brother that was preaching said Do you believe it's yours yeah I believe it brother Sean I've never seen something like that happen that fast a 35-year-old Pew riding Christian hallu hallu but knowing that there was something greater for him knowing that he was just going through the motions knowing that I mean he'll testify about this his his literal skin color has changed since this event what was it it was Grace amen you think well I'm too far in this he was 35 years in that why I'm too far deep in this brother Junior you ever go out in the woods you get stuck in the mud you trying to spin your way out it just gets deeper and deeper and deeper you're thinking I'm just H I'm never going to get out of this situation and you know what getting stuck in the mud I don't know about everybody else but it gives me a sense of hopelessness what am I going to do out here I don't have phone signal I don't have a way out I don't have a wench I don't know but you're not still in the mud Junior the Lord Brother will you're not still stuck in the mud and you go back to that moment when you were down there in the trenches you think I'm never going to get out of here I'm going to be stuck here they're going to find a body laying here I'm just going to be stuck out in these Woods I remember one time in in in I had an elk hunt in Arizona and dark got on me faster than I could and you know how it is out there Josiah one range looks like the next I couldn't find my truck I was out there middle of the night wandering around and that Spirit of hopelessness comes on you that's right I'm never going to get out of here brother banon was there one time how am I going to get out of this how am I going to get out of this situation you know what he did he just put up his hands yes and the fog began to lift all of that confusion began to lift and he just put up his hands there he said he felt a Lifeline it was Grace it was Grace that would lead his hands he said I knew as soon as I made contact with that line at the other end of that line was my wife and my children and I was going home he said it was as good as done but what he had to do was override the hopelessness and lift up his hands and say Lord your grace is sufficient Lord I know you're able to fix this situation Lord I know that you're able now I don't know what everybody in here is going through but I do know that God is able I do I don't have to hear your story or how bad it is or how deep in the hole you are but I do know that God is able I do know that no matter how sick you are God's still a Healer I do know that no matter how ruptured your family is God is still a restorer I do know that no matter how deep it might seem God is still a deliverer I do know that God is still a provider he's still our healer he's still our everpresent help in time of trouble he's still all those things it doesn't matter what the situation looks like he's still those things amen and he's wanting to show himself amen God I wish you'd show yourself he's trying amen Lord I wish you'd come down in a physical manifestation but he's trying to show himself in the middle of your situation amen grace to the church that's right yeah what message are we going to choose law or Grace amen I hope you understand where I'm at friends I'm not preaching disgrace amen amen can I say this right am I okay he doesn't know what I'm going to say so I've I've been the message my whole life I've come in a different movements this movement Pentecostal type movements legalist type movements this type movement i' I've I've traveled around let me say there's nothing that'll faster kill your joy than legalism amen I've never seen legalism be victorious I've never seen I hope that's okay brother Sean but I've never seen a legal Spirit the law the law the law have Victory I just in my personal experience why because there's no joy in the law because you'll have to keep it and keep it and keep it and keep it and you're just always under that condemnation and that burden of keeping the law keeping the law keeping the law keeping the law if I I I thought I had the Holy Ghost but now I'm not sure I thought I had a victory but now I'm not sure I thought I was past this but now I'm back here but if you would just take one step over to Grace oh I know I'm not keeping it but Grace oh I messed up but Grace and he's to ing us what is this adoption tutoring us you messed up here let's go Peter come on there's Grace for you there's Grace for us I'm sorry friends I don't know how long I've been but there's Grace for us hallelujah but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen amen musicians would come do you know her Mrs Grace amen is she in your body yes Mrs Grace you guys were singing that song before uh where would I be where would we be if for Grace we've got some strong enabled men in here no matter how strong you get Judah you'll never be able to do it according to your own Works some situations we go through in life that we can't fix you'd like to but you can't sometimes it just gets too hot to touch you'd like to fix it but you can't if only there was some provision for that Grace amen Lord we need your grace we got to have it we can't go on without it I can't go another day with it without it I I've got to have your grace can have all these things you can have all of the gifts working but without that perfect love which brother bandam taught us is Grace it means [Music] nothing we've just went on a journey of the individual Grace in in our life look that Spirit told brother brandham how you want me to give you Grace and you won't give Grace to that woman sitting [Music] there as a prophet to think all the
