[45:01] his dear son in whom we have Redemption
[45:05] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[45:07] of sins so so who has that Redemption
[45:11] through his blood it's the
[45:14] Hees it's the the the those that the
[45:17] father hath made meat to be partakers of
[45:22] The
[45:23] Inheritance you can have your seats this
[45:25] evening
[45:27] and
[45:28] um got a little bit of ground to cover
[45:31] but hopefully um uh we can get through
[45:34] it and it'll be a help to you but um the
[45:39] words we we read here is uh the key word
[45:43] is air and
[45:45] inheritance and and both words go uh
[45:49] hand in
[45:51] hand uh see an and
[45:53] air uh is is uh what is considered to be
[45:57] an
[45:58] inheritor a possessor of an
[46:02] inheritance Lord so then and we we've
[46:05] talked about it about the an
[46:08] inheritance is something that has been
[46:11] left by someone amen uh uh you don't
[46:15] have to earn it you don't have to work
[46:16] for it you don't have to plead brother
[46:19] brah said you don't even have to be
[46:21] worthy of it you you it it was just left
[46:25] to you by by
[46:27] uh we'll put it by divine
[46:30] grace and so um uh that's that's what an
[46:34] inheritance is and that's what it means
[46:37] to be an heir so the person that gets
[46:40] the inheritance uh is considered to be
[46:44] the heir and as we see in the scriptures
[46:48] that the sun everybody say the sun uh is
[46:52] is the air he the sun is the air and and
[46:57] uh uh Galatians 4 And1 now I say that
[47:01] the heir as long as he is a child deth
[47:05] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[47:07] of all amen he he he's he's he's the
[47:11] heir he says but is under tutors and
[47:16] governors until the time appointed of
[47:19] the father amen so then we We Know by
[47:23] the message that at the appointed time
[47:26] of the father
[47:27] then the son is adopted it he comes into
[47:30] adoption and and brother bradam says now
[47:34] notice if the child become a gallant
[47:36] child a a good child obedient then it
[47:41] was told to the father he said oh I just
[47:43] love the word at an appointed time set
[47:46] by the father alone the child was his
[47:49] glory and honor was manifested before
[47:52] the public see the father taken his own
[47:55] child under celebration and took him
[47:59] into the public places being his own son
[48:01] born in his own house yet the son was
[48:05] positionally placed in the family to
[48:08] inherit all things that the father had
[48:12] amen aren't you glad for that amen see
[48:15] at the time appointed of the father then
[48:18] then then the the the the the son comes
[48:21] into an adoption and becomes heir to all
[48:25] the father had amen so now it's for for
[48:29] for most of us I I guess we would
[48:32] believe that we are living in the time
[48:34] of adoption that that's that's the time
[48:37] and and which means that the sons of God
[48:41] are in possession of The Inheritance
[48:45] it's it's it's that way and and so I I
[48:49] looked up this word possessor it it
[48:52] means someone who has possession a or a
[48:56] legal or rightful claim to ownership
[49:00] amen so the heir is possessor amen that
[49:04] that's that's what we are as The Heirs
[49:08] of Jesus Christ The Heirs of God or The
[49:11] Heirs of promise and and so uh according
[49:15] to 1 Corinthians
[49:18] 6:10 uh uh we possess all things aren't
[49:22] you glad for that not some things but we
[49:25] possess all all things if if you get a
[49:28] chance go listen to the message
[49:30] possessing all things uh brother
[49:33] brandham uh preached it and and talking
[49:36] about powerful amen but possessing we
[49:39] possess all things not not some things
[49:43] not part but all things and and uh if
[49:47] you if we that could really uh uh uh uh
[49:51] strike our heart amen that we are
[49:53] possessors of all things then then we
[49:56] don't have have to be sick brother
[49:57] Braham said you don't have to sin you
[49:59] don't have to be bogged down you you
[50:01] don't have to be in bondage you you're
[50:04] you're possessor and and and another
[50:06] thing he says is that we we are
[50:09] possessors of everything that we can see
[50:11] we're we're possessors of the earth
[50:13] we're we're possessors but not only are
[50:15] we possessors of what we see we possess
[50:18] the Unseen as as well we're possessor of
[50:22] all things amen and so Paul would tell
[50:25] us we're heir
[50:27] according to the promise which which
[50:29] means that we were elected we we didn't
[50:32] stumble into this we we did it's not
[50:35] just happened you know uh by chance um
[50:39] uh uh but we were elected and our name
[50:42] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[50:45] before the foundation of the world Amen
[50:48] so as the bride of Christ amen you know
[50:51] there there's all kinds of uh Parables
[50:53] that God uses as Sons were HS but as the
[50:57] bride of Christ we are heir of all
[50:59] things as well and and God shows that
[51:02] even through Rebecca in the Old
[51:04] Testament amen when she met uh um uh um
[51:10] um uh Isaac and she was the type of the
[51:12] Bride in this day and and brother
[51:15] brandham says as Rebecca got a straddled
[51:17] of the camel and rode away to meet her
[51:19] lover Isaac and Isaac had already left
[51:22] the camp and was out in the fields at
[51:25] the evening time
[51:27] when he saw her coming see it was love
[51:30] at first sight she jumped off the camel
[51:33] and ran to meet him she was taken into
[51:36] Abraham's tent and there become an heir
[51:40] and inherited all things amen she she
[51:44] was connected with with uh uh uh uh
[51:48] Isaac through through uh a marriage and
[51:51] she become heir of everything that Isaac
[51:54] had aren't you glad for that Isaac a
[51:57] type of Christ and and Rebecca a type of
[52:00] the Bride SE so now we know we know that
[52:03] we're living in the evening time where
[52:07] Christ and his bride which is you and I
[52:10] amen are being united together in in a
[52:15] wedding ain't that right we are united
[52:18] which again makes us heir of all things
[52:23] amen Zechariah 14 is now now being
[52:27] fulfilled in this age where it says at
[52:30] evening time it shall be light you see
[52:34] we're not walking in Baptist light we're
[52:37] not walking in Methodist light we're not
[52:40] walking in Pentecostal or nazing light
[52:43] or or what other light you know or or
[52:46] glare or whatever it is we are walking
[52:49] in the evening light amen we are walking
[52:53] and it's important to know what kind of
[52:56] light that we're we're walking in and
[52:59] and and the message makes it clear we
[53:02] are walking in the evening light and
[53:04] brother brandom identified the evening
[53:07] light as being the manifestation of the
[53:11] Resurrection amen there was no
[53:13] manifestation of of the Resurrection uh
[53:17] uh in Luther's day Wesley's day the uh
[53:20] uh uh uh down through the church ages
[53:23] but now has come the evening light amen
[53:26] man which is the manifestation of the
[53:29] Resurrection which fulfills Luke 17:30
[53:32] the son of man is being revealed again
[53:37] the son of man not a church not a
[53:40] preacher not a personality but the son
[53:43] of man being revealed so brother BR said
[53:46] what that means is is the same head that
[53:49] was there in the East is here in the
[53:52] west again the same Christ that was
[53:55] there in the East uh uh uh uh uh East is
[53:59] now here in the west again amen oh
[54:03] aren't you glad for that amen so then we
[54:06] as the Bride of Jesus Christ being
[54:09] connected to Christ through a a marriage
[54:12] ceremony amen you see we're we're not
[54:15] going to a wedding we're going to the
[54:17] marriage supper of the lamb but the the
[54:20] union between Christ and his bride is an
[54:23] invisible Union and it happens in the
[54:26] age right now on in in this time and I
[54:30] pray that you have been United with him
[54:33] amen and if you're United with him then
[54:36] know that you're heir of all things amen
[54:41] see God made it very plain to us through
[54:43] many types and shadows that we are heir
[54:47] of all things he wants you to know that
[54:49] he doesn't want us living beggarly amen
[54:52] and and struggling and and and and and
[54:56] don't know uh who we are and and and and
[54:59] what benefits that we have well just to
[55:02] settle it all every benefit is yours
[55:05] they your heir of everything that God
[55:08] has amen now I've been dealing with
[55:12] Caleb you know going into the promised
[55:14] land and CA uh claiming his inheritance
[55:18] you see he had nothing to claim outside
[55:21] the land amen there was nothing outside
[55:23] that land amen uh uh that was his
[55:27] inheritance his inheritance was not in
[55:30] Esau's land it wasn't in moab's land it
[55:33] wasn't in Egypt amen it it wasn't there
[55:37] so so uh Israel had nothing to claim
[55:40] outside the land of promise amen so this
[55:43] was God's intention was to bring them
[55:46] out of Egypt and take them down through
[55:49] the to the promised land amen so they
[55:52] had to keep following the pillar of fire
[55:55] amen all the way through amen but then
[55:58] we find that there there came a time
[56:01] when Moses died and and the unbelievers
[56:04] died and and all of those that just
[56:07] complained and grumbled and and and
[56:09] would not follow Moses and and believe
[56:12] the message of the hour and all of these
[56:14] things amen they died and and we know
[56:18] what that meant is is not just a natural
[56:20] death but it was an eternal separation
[56:23] amen they died and see and and and then
[56:26] God raised up a new leader who was
[56:29] appointed uh by God and that was Joshua
[56:33] with a new ministry amen and and uh
[56:36] Joshua by that Ministry took the people
[56:39] over into the land of promise and
[56:42] positionally placed them in the land
[56:45] Amen brother brandham said Moses that
[56:47] great miracle performer that brought
[56:50] down Israel uh down through the land and
[56:53] brought them up to the promised land but
[56:55] did not not Place their inheritance to
[56:58] them see and Christ brought the church
[57:01] up to the place to where their
[57:03] possession was made to them was given to
[57:05] them just the Jordan to cross but the
[57:08] holy spirit is the one that sets the
[57:10] church in order that Joshua of today
[57:13] puts the church in its order given to
[57:16] each one gifts places position and he is
[57:19] the voice everybody say he is the voice
[57:22] he is the voice speaking to the inner
[57:24] man that Christ has saved the holy
[57:27] spirit amen see and so we we know that
[57:31] the prophet said Moses represented the
[57:33] law amen and the law condemnation could
[57:37] not take the people over into the
[57:39] promised land it would take a Ministry
[57:42] of Grace can you say amen amen a
[57:45] Ministry of Grace and he says the law
[57:48] and Grace were two different aspects of
[57:51] God's command now the law brought them
[57:54] out amen and mo uh uh which was Moses
[57:57] and Joshua Grace took them in amen Grace
[58:02] aren't you glad for that amen Grace
[58:05] brings you to your inheritance Grace
[58:08] amen brings you into the land of promise
[58:11] Grace amen establishes you and and
[58:14] positions you and and and you don't have
[58:16] to deserve it you don't have to you
[58:18] don't have to beg you don't have to
[58:20] plead you don't have to nothing like
[58:22] that this is a Ministry of Grace amen
[58:26] God looking at the predestinated seed of
[58:30] what he ordained you to be what he
[58:32] called you to be and there is a Ministry
[58:34] of Grace that's not looking at your your
[58:37] faults not looking at your complexes and
[58:39] not looking at your inabilities but
[58:42] looking Amen to the for for ordination
[58:45] of God Amen and placing you in the land
[58:49] amen now the Book of Joshua of course as
[58:52] we said deals with the second part of
[58:56] Redemption for a natural people and God
[58:59] brought them out of a natural land amen
[59:03] which was the first part of redemption
[59:05] amen and then uh uh if you notice in in
[59:09] that 2 and a half million people come
[59:11] out they were part of that uh uh first
[59:14] part amen uh two and a half million come
[59:17] out brother Brown said they were all
[59:18] baptized un Moses through the Red Sea
[59:21] they all follow that same spirit being
[59:24] the cloud and the pillar of Fire see
[59:26] they they all were led by the same Angel
[59:29] they all come out by the same Pastor
[59:32] they all was baptized into the sea they
[59:34] all eat of the spiritual mana and that
[59:37] Mana was Christ Christ coming down the
[59:40] mana come down every night from heaven
[59:42] and perished here to sustain uh the the
[59:46] people in their Journey amen he says
[59:49] they had repented and were baptized and
[59:52] come out to walk in a new life in a new
[59:54] land in a new of an a newness Journey
[59:58] amongst new people and the hands of God
[1:00:00] upon them amen but it finally come to a
[1:00:03] place in this walk that they had that
[1:00:06] they was not satisfied with their walk
[1:00:09] of Grace amen they come through
[1:00:11] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:00:14] of the Holy Ghost but it come to a time
[1:00:17] they were not satisfied with their walk
[1:00:19] of Grace amen see he says uh uh see
[1:00:23] repented and were baptized and come out
[1:00:25] to walk in a new life in a new land in a
[1:00:28] newness Journey see but it finally comes
[1:00:31] to this time they were not satisfied see
[1:00:34] amen with their walk of Grace see and
[1:00:37] they all perished everybody say they all
[1:00:39] perished they all perished in the
[1:00:41] wilderness amen you see God knows what
[1:00:44] he's doing and he wants it done right he
[1:00:47] wants it done the way he says it and and
[1:00:49] nothing else ain't that right you can
[1:00:51] call it being narrow-minded or or
[1:00:53] whatever you want to call it but this is
[1:00:55] what God says it ain't that right now
[1:00:58] this tells us that all kinds of people
[1:01:01] can experience justification they can
[1:01:03] come through the stages of
[1:01:05] sanctification and even the baptism of
[1:01:08] the Holy Ghost and still not partake of
[1:01:12] The
[1:01:13] Inheritance can you say Amen you see
[1:01:16] Luther which was the age of
[1:01:18] justification did not put the people in
[1:01:21] the land of inheritance Wesley amen
[1:01:25] which was sanctification did not put the
[1:01:28] people in the land of inheritance
[1:01:31] Pentecostal age amen which put the gifts
[1:01:34] back into the church yet it could not
[1:01:37] put the people Amen in the land of
[1:01:41] inheritance but then God would send a
[1:01:45] message of Grace God would raise up a
[1:01:48] Joshua Ministry in this last day with
[1:01:52] the message of Grace to put us in the
[1:01:54] land and and positionally place us why
[1:01:58] to bring us to an adoption that you and
[1:02:03] I don't have to wait to heaven to be
[1:02:05] partakers of the air of promise but we
[1:02:09] are now we are the sons of God not not
[1:02:12] when we change this old body amen uh uh
[1:02:16] you are now the sons of God you are now
[1:02:19] The Heirs of God and you are now
[1:02:22] partakers of the Divine inheritance amen
[1:02:26] see now justification sanctification the
[1:02:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost is all one
[1:02:33] work of Grace amen see it's it it it's
[1:02:36] it's all one gra uh uh part of Grace
[1:02:39] Grace was with Israel Grace provided an
[1:02:42] atonement for Israel Grace provided a
[1:02:45] mercy seat Grace provided a a smitten
[1:02:48] Rock uh where water would come out of
[1:02:51] that rock U uh Grace provided the a
[1:02:54] Brazen serpent but no notice Grace also
[1:02:57] provided them a prophet who would lead
[1:03:00] them aren't you glad for that amen uh uh
[1:03:04] Grace provided a prophet amen when God
[1:03:07] sends a prophet to a a generation a
[1:03:09] nation that's the grace of God Amen and
[1:03:13] when he sends it it's it's a sign that
[1:03:16] God is ready to speak to his people amen
[1:03:20] see but see they were not satisfied with
[1:03:23] their walk of Grace amen see they wanted
[1:03:26] to walk by their own ideas they they
[1:03:29] wanted to go by their own interpretation
[1:03:31] they didn't need the prophet to
[1:03:32] interpret the land for them amen they
[1:03:35] wanted to go by what they saw by what
[1:03:37] they felt by what they amen was
[1:03:40] experiencing or whatever see amen and
[1:03:43] they went by their own interpretation of
[1:03:45] the word they wanted to walk by their
[1:03:48] own leadership of of uh appointed
[1:03:51] leadership amen but the problem was when
[1:03:54] they got to the land a promise they
[1:03:57] didn't have what it took Amen to go into
[1:04:01] the land amen they trusted in themselves
[1:04:04] but when they met something greater than
[1:04:06] themselves amen fear struck their heart
[1:04:09] amen but see it doesn't matter amen if
[1:04:12] you're able or if you're not a it
[1:04:14] doesn't matter about your abilities it
[1:04:16] doesn't matter amen about you at all
[1:04:19] it's the grace of God that's going to
[1:04:22] take us over it's the grace of God
[1:04:25] that's saved you it's the grace of God
[1:04:28] Amen that that pardon your sins it's the
[1:04:31] grace of God that's bringing us into our
[1:04:35] inheritance do you believe that see so
[1:04:39] amen they needed Grace amen but they had
[1:04:41] turned Grace down amen see and chose law
[1:04:46] amen they couldn't take the land on
[1:04:48] their own they couldn't defeat the
[1:04:50] Giants and and overcome the world cities
[1:04:53] on their own amen their own appointed
[1:04:56] leadership failed them it wouldn't work
[1:04:59] for them their own ideas and their own
[1:05:01] interpretation of the word amen wasn't
[1:05:04] strong enough wasn't good enough to
[1:05:06] bring them in to the land oh my amen and
[1:05:10] look at the churches falling apart today
[1:05:13] amen the enemy is coming in like a flood
[1:05:15] and the people don't know what to do
[1:05:18] amen But Here We Stand amen a sinless
[1:05:21] spotless bride because there is a
[1:05:24] Ministry of Grace amen I couldn't do it
[1:05:27] brother Tim you couldn't do it we
[1:05:29] couldn't overcome in oursel that we're
[1:05:31] under a Ministry of Grace that is
[1:05:34] keeping us protecting us providing for
[1:05:37] us and I thank God for
[1:05:41] itlu through the church ages the carinal
[1:05:44] church hasn't been satisfied with their
[1:05:47] walk of Grace amen God sends them a
[1:05:51] Revival by grace and then before you
[1:05:54] know it they they kill it and they they
[1:05:57] they go after their own ideas and their
[1:05:59] own ways and amen God would send the
[1:06:01] other AG uh uh uh a Grace or another
[1:06:04] Revival and and they would denominate
[1:06:07] and all of these things but now we're
[1:06:09] standing here it's time to possess the
[1:06:12] land it's time to come into this land of
[1:06:16] promise into our our inheritance oh my
[1:06:20] and and they don't have what it takes
[1:06:23] their Bishops ain't got what it takes to
[1:06:25] bring them over amen their clergy their
[1:06:28] seminaries their their their Theology
[1:06:30] and everything that they have it it it
[1:06:33] it they don't have what it takes Amen to
[1:06:37] defeat the enemy
[1:06:39] with can you say Amen you see but when
[1:06:42] when God raised up Joshua and gave him
[1:06:47] the ministry of Grace see Caleb that
[1:06:51] True Believer which is a type of us amen
[1:06:55] he's the he only types us as far as
[1:06:59] Caleb he didn't type any other age he
[1:07:02] types us he crossed over into the
[1:07:05] promised land under that Ministry of
[1:07:09] Grace amen he represented the True
[1:07:13] Believer of today who has crossed over
[1:07:16] into the land under the ministry of
[1:07:19] Grace aren't you glad for that and and
[1:07:22] we know we're not confused as to what
[1:07:25] what where is this message of Grace amen
[1:07:28] God says behold I send unto you Elijah
[1:07:31] the prophet amen and he will have a
[1:07:35] message of Grace anden he will restore
[1:07:38] your heart he will turn you back he will
[1:07:41] he will uh call out amen and bring a
[1:07:44] restoration to the church amen it's the
[1:07:47] message of Grace the message of Malachi
[1:07:50] 4 is the message of Grace do you believe
[1:07:53] that see and so the elect of today is
[1:07:57] being positionally placed Amen in the
[1:08:00] land of inheritance it was not in Luther
[1:08:04] Wesley Columba uh uh to the Dark Ages it
[1:08:07] it was not amen it's today that there is
[1:08:11] a people by the ministry of Grace that
[1:08:15] is being placed in the promised land so
[1:08:18] what are we doing all right this is why
[1:08:20] it requires us not just to be church
[1:08:23] goers amen church members and and just
[1:08:26] going through the ritual we are here to
[1:08:29] lay claim to our inheritance lay claim
[1:08:33] to our inheritance I don't care how bad
[1:08:36] the devil is I don't care how dark it is
[1:08:39] I don't care how many demons are
[1:08:40] surrounding your Mountain you have every
[1:08:43] right to lay claim to that inheritance
[1:08:46] you have the right you are the people we
[1:08:48] are that generation of people amen that
[1:08:51] have the right to speak with authority
[1:08:53] to the devil and say give it up
[1:08:56] amen you you ain't got no hold on me why
[1:08:59] because the time appointed of the father
[1:09:02] has come the fullness of times have
[1:09:06] arrived aren't you glad for that amen
[1:09:09] the manifestation of the sons of God you
[1:09:12] see has not been promised to any other
[1:09:15] age amen outside of the age that we're
[1:09:18] living in this is the time everybody say
[1:09:21] this is the time this is the time for
[1:09:23] the sons of God to be m manifested this
[1:09:26] is the time for the sons of God to have
[1:09:28] full Authority amen not just a little
[1:09:31] portion of authority full Authority amen
[1:09:35] this is the time for the sons of God to
[1:09:37] speak with authority amen this is the
[1:09:41] time amen uh for the sons of God to act
[1:09:45] with authority why because we're not
[1:09:47] living in a leot sea of Pentecostal age
[1:09:51] we're living in Bride age this is seed
[1:09:54] time bride time bride age this is time
[1:09:58] amen for the for the the the the uh the
[1:10:01] son of man to be revealed in the body of
[1:10:05] Flesh amen yes sir now see outside of
[1:10:09] that you're not you're not possessing or
[1:10:12] in in any of your inheritance see you're
[1:10:15] not in possession of that amen see amen
[1:10:19] so so as I said in Luther's age it
[1:10:21] wasn't time to possess the inheritance
[1:10:23] for that was the age of the stock in
[1:10:26] Wesley's age it wasn't time Amen to
[1:10:29] possess the inheritance for that was the
[1:10:31] age of the tossel amen neither was it
[1:10:34] time to possess the inheritance in the
[1:10:37] Pentecostal age for that was the age of
[1:10:39] the Shu that was the time of the shock
[1:10:42] amen the fullness of time hadn't come
[1:10:44] yet amen but now it's the bride age
[1:10:48] everybody say it's the bride age now we
[1:10:50] wouldn't know the bride age we wouldn't
[1:10:52] even know such a word amen if it had not
[1:10:55] been for a prophet to tell us amen where
[1:10:57] we're at it's the bride age amen and the
[1:11:01] sons of God are coming to maturity and
[1:11:05] adoption ain't that right and what is it
[1:11:08] that's when the bride is be being united
[1:11:13] with her mate the
[1:11:16] word which is Christ amen see United
[1:11:20] couldn't happen in any other age it's
[1:11:22] now that the bride is being United with
[1:11:26] the word of God Amen yes sir now if if
[1:11:31] you look you know uh uh uh at the first
[1:11:35] church age or we will look at the day of
[1:11:37] Pentecost and uh that first church done
[1:11:40] many things many wonderful works and
[1:11:44] acts and and things like that and the
[1:11:46] book of Acts tells us what they done and
[1:11:50] and the the power that they had and and
[1:11:53] uh uh you know it it was was a wonderful
[1:11:56] wonderful uh Church in in that time and
[1:12:00] and you know but but it was a word seed
[1:12:03] that God planted on the day of Pentecost
[1:12:06] it was only a seed can you say amen amen
[1:12:11] and and and and even though it was a
[1:12:13] seed it had not yet died it had not yet
[1:12:17] rotted and and it had still had to go
[1:12:19] through the process amen amen it was
[1:12:22] just the seed and and the ible says
[1:12:25] except a seed uh fall in the ground and
[1:12:28] die and rot it it abideth alone ain't
[1:12:32] that right amen see and so uh uh that
[1:12:35] first church what God planted amen that
[1:12:38] was the beginning of the Masterpiece as
[1:12:42] go listen to the Masterpiece and brother
[1:12:43] Brandon talks about it it was the
[1:12:45] beginning of the work of a masterpiece
[1:12:49] but it was not the Capstone age it it
[1:12:53] wasn't the Capstone Ministry can you say
[1:12:57] amen amen but but look now amen if you
[1:13:01] notice the work we we've come through
[1:13:03] all these ages and we're standing here
[1:13:06] amen uh uh and and and the message of
[1:13:09] Malachi 4 is to take us back to the
[1:13:13] original Pentecost amen that's what the
[1:13:16] prophet said amen why we've come to seed
[1:13:19] that went in the ground has now come and
[1:13:22] it's now ripening everybody say it's rip
[1:13:25] rening see so so it it is to take us
[1:13:28] back to the original Pentecost like it
[1:13:31] was on the days of Acts plus everybody
[1:13:34] say plus plus it is to bring us to
[1:13:38] maturity to where the son of man is
[1:13:42] revealed in
[1:13:44] us can you say Amen the son of man is to
[1:13:48] be revealed what what what are you
[1:13:50] saying the word is now being made flesh
[1:13:53] in us the inheritance the promise The
[1:13:57] Heirs of Promise is now being partakers
[1:14:00] of this Divine word not by law but by
[1:14:06] Grace amen amen and so it it's there and
[1:14:11] now notice it's the ministry of the son
[1:14:15] of man in the sons of men go Amen
[1:14:19] brother brandom said the pillar of fire
[1:14:22] which was upon the son of man see
[1:14:25] and has now come to anoint sons of men
[1:14:30] everybody say sons of men to bring back
[1:14:33] a Ministry just exactly like he said it
[1:14:37] would be in order for the head and the
[1:14:40] rest of the body to connect together oh
[1:14:44] my aren't you glad for that now I'll
[1:14:47] I'll try to hurry here but when people
[1:14:50] hear us talking about this age of bright
[1:14:53] age and talking about way we preach and
[1:14:56] and and believe and all that you know
[1:14:58] they they tend to think that we we don't
[1:15:01] think that the previous Ages were
[1:15:05] important and and uh that they were just
[1:15:08] you know kind of the the you know run of
[1:15:10] the meal and and all these things but I
[1:15:13] I no no real True Believer feels that
[1:15:16] way at all see because we know by the
[1:15:19] message of the hour that each age had
[1:15:22] its purpose it it had its time time it
[1:15:25] had its placing and and all these things
[1:15:28] and we know as Believers of the message
[1:15:31] of the hour that each age each Church
[1:15:34] age there was a elect group of people in
[1:15:39] that age and they are going to be part
[1:15:41] of the Rapture do you believe that amen
[1:15:44] and I know you believe that see so it's
[1:15:47] no mystery to anyone who believes the
[1:15:49] message of the hour because brother Bram
[1:15:52] taught it that way amen he says this the
[1:15:55] true bride will be made up of thousands
[1:15:58] times thousands of people but it will be
[1:16:01] the elect out of every Church age amen
[1:16:05] you realize that that we we have come
[1:16:08] down amen the the the it started out
[1:16:11] wide in the first church Age and and
[1:16:14] then it's it's beginning to get narrow
[1:16:16] and narrow and narrow can you say Amen
[1:16:19] now now you know it's not that we're
[1:16:22] narrow-minded it's it's just where we're
[1:16:24] we're at it's it's
[1:16:27] narrow and and the Bible says very few
[1:16:31] are going to make it in this age we we
[1:16:34] can't help that that's that's the Bible
[1:16:36] That's the Way God's got it and very few
[1:16:39] amen the Bible even says that the Lord's
[1:16:41] going to come amen uh uh uh how how is
[1:16:45] that that he will come uh uh for the
[1:16:48] very elect sake uh uh if if he didn't
[1:16:51] come no flesh would be saved or
[1:16:53] something to that effect if I I got at
[1:16:55] all but but see it's it's be it's so
[1:16:57] narrow that it's going to be very very
[1:17:01] very few in this age make it in the
[1:17:04] Rapture but there's going to be
[1:17:06] thousands that come into the Rapture but
[1:17:09] it's going to be the elect out of every
[1:17:11] Church age can you say Amen see now what
[1:17:15] what that elect had was the genuine Holy
[1:17:19] Spirit how many beliefs that it wasn't
[1:17:21] make belief it was a genuine holy spirit
[1:17:24] that they had in every age amen but
[1:17:28] everybody say but amen they only had a
[1:17:32] dip of the the Holy Spirit that's what
[1:17:35] the prophet taught they only had a
[1:17:37] portion so so the elect in Luther's age
[1:17:41] had a portion of the Holy Spirit the
[1:17:43] elect in Wesley's age had a greater
[1:17:47] portion than did the elect in in in
[1:17:50] Luther's age see and and so then then in
[1:17:55] the elect in the Pentecostal age had a
[1:17:57] greater portion than what Wesley had
[1:18:00] amen see uh than then the elect in
[1:18:03] Wesley amen they had it see it kept
[1:18:06] getting more and more and more amen but
[1:18:09] now we're not in the Pentecostal age
[1:18:12] we're beyond that Pentecostal age
[1:18:15] brother Brown says we're way on up to
[1:18:17] the coming of the Lord where the
[1:18:19] ministry that Jesus Christ exercised
[1:18:22] himself has to be ex exactly it's here
[1:18:27] it's here Church there is a people on
[1:18:30] the Earth that has that same type of
[1:18:33] ministry amen and it was proven through
[1:18:36] brother brandham amen see the same power
[1:18:39] the same Christ the so he says see like
[1:18:42] The Headstone on the pyramid it has to
[1:18:45] be so honed till every stone fits
[1:18:48] perfectly and the church has got to get
[1:18:50] in that condition to receive the
[1:18:52] headstone then take the whole thing
[1:18:55] in the resurrection when the body is is
[1:18:58] raised up so what the church has done
[1:19:02] it's moved on up amen into the full
[1:19:06] promise amen that that's where we're at
[1:19:09] we moved up not impartial but we moved
[1:19:12] up into the full promise full power full
[1:19:18] Dynamics full Christ can you say Amen
[1:19:22] yes sir see now no notice brother brah
[1:19:25] said what is the Holy Ghost it's God in
[1:19:28] you well what's it for to continue his
[1:19:31] work among his people to bring his
[1:19:33] church together to bring a church to a
[1:19:37] place in this day far beyond Lutheran
[1:19:40] methodus Pentecostal into a place to
[1:19:43] adoption and rapturing Grace that when
[1:19:46] this part of the church when the spirit
[1:19:48] moves into this church it will just
[1:19:51] raise up can you sayen the power has
[1:19:55] come to Quicken our mortal bodies the
[1:19:58] Dynamics is
[1:20:01] here that's right see when the son of
[1:20:04] man cometh he will come in what power
[1:20:07] and great Glory or great power and glory
[1:20:12] amen see at the revealing of the son of
[1:20:14] man comes power what is it not partial
[1:20:18] power not a dip of the power but the
[1:20:22] fullness of power every everything that
[1:20:25] God was he poured into Christ and
[1:20:27] everything that Christ is he poured in
[1:20:30] the
[1:20:31] church and you say Amen notice he says
[1:20:35] and it'll bring forth all the redeemed
[1:20:38] oh my that's touched that spirit amen
[1:20:42] remember what brother Brown said the
[1:20:43] power that you're watering right now
[1:20:45] with your Praises is going to take you
[1:20:47] home one of these days this isn't
[1:20:49] fanaticism this is a power there's
[1:20:52] something that's holding us there's
[1:20:54] something that's keeping us there's
[1:20:56] something that's motivating us there's
[1:20:58] something on the inside that's
[1:21:00] quickening us what is it it's the same
[1:21:03] power that's going to take us home yes
[1:21:06] sir and it'll bring forth all the
[1:21:08] redeemed that's touched that Spirit
[1:21:10] those Lutheran who stood with all the
[1:21:12] light they had in justification those
[1:21:15] methodists that fell on the floor and
[1:21:17] they throwed water in their face from
[1:21:19] the spirit striking them through
[1:21:21] sanctification those Pentecostals that
[1:21:23] walked up and down the streets and they
[1:21:26] called them tongue uh uh demong tongues
[1:21:30] demong and jabberers and Goose language
[1:21:33] and all of that they'll stand in the
[1:21:35] righteousness in the sight of God at
[1:21:37] that day just as certain as the Bible
[1:21:40] stands here why there was an elect in
[1:21:43] every
[1:21:44] age can you say Amen yes sir see and 1
[1:21:49] Thessalonians 4:14 Paul says for if we
[1:21:52] if we believe that Jesus died and rose
[1:21:55] again even so them also which sleep in
[1:21:59] Jesus will God bring with him every age
[1:22:03] that died in Christ they died with the
[1:22:06] promise there will be a
[1:22:08] resurrection amen they died believing
[1:22:11] the same thing you did there's a Rapture
[1:22:14] we're going to be in that
[1:22:18] Rapture they may have not had the
[1:22:20] understanding that you had they may not
[1:22:22] had the full power that you had but they
[1:22:24] had enough to Quicken them that when
[1:22:26] they went in the ground it's that power
[1:22:28] that they had received is going to
[1:22:31] Quicken their Bo mortal bodies now
[1:22:34] notice the Holy Spirit has come upon us
[1:22:36] in the last days and identified himself
[1:22:39] right in our church and has proven the
[1:22:42] same works that he did when he was here
[1:22:44] in the fullness Upon Jesus Christ he did
[1:22:48] the same thing upon the bride and doing
[1:22:51] the same thing what he did in full Upon
[1:22:55] Jesus Christ he's here doing the same
[1:22:57] thing in the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:00] Christ not in one man but a many
[1:23:03] membered
[1:23:04] body can you say Amen see so we're all
[1:23:08] part of something amen we're all part of
[1:23:11] it now he says the last thing that the
[1:23:13] church is going to see is Christ
[1:23:15] manifested in his power in fullness
[1:23:18] everybody say in fullness in his church
[1:23:22] just before the fire falls
[1:23:25] say that again what a promise you're
[1:23:26] heirs to this now amen the last thing
[1:23:30] that the church is going to see is
[1:23:32] Christ manifested in his power he's
[1:23:36] going to be man he's being manifested in
[1:23:38] Housewives he's being manifested in
[1:23:41] fathers he's being manifested in the
[1:23:43] preachers and the deacons and the lay
[1:23:45] members he's being manifested in the
[1:23:48] children the young people of all ages
[1:23:51] Christ is being manifested in this last
[1:23:54] day in fullness in his church just
[1:23:57] before the fire
[1:24:00] falls no we're not dead we're alive and
[1:24:03] well we're not retreating we're going
[1:24:06] forward amen we ain't weak we're getting
[1:24:10] stronger every day do you believe that
[1:24:13] so what is it we're living in a Time the
[1:24:16] prophet said where the church is being
[1:24:18] positionally placed where the fullness
[1:24:20] everybody Say fullness the fullness of
[1:24:23] the power of the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:24:26] the church it did not happen on the day
[1:24:30] on ausa Street it did not happen amen
[1:24:33] under Wesley and Luther and and and on
[1:24:36] down it's happening right now the
[1:24:39] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] comes into the church then comes to pass
[1:24:46] the
[1:24:48] scripture if you say to this mountain
[1:24:52] amen be moved don't doubt in your heart
[1:24:55] but believe what you say shall but
[1:24:58] believe that what you have said shall
[1:24:59] come to pass you can have what you've
[1:25:02] said really you you understand that that
[1:25:05] prophecy was that was prophetic what
[1:25:07] Jesus was saying and yet that scripture
[1:25:09] laid dormant all these Church ages until
[1:25:13] now where a prophet begin to understand
[1:25:17] even even greater than the first church
[1:25:19] age or the first church amen even an a
[1:25:23] greater understanding standing amen and
[1:25:25] and in one place brother brandom said
[1:25:27] that Jesus never outright created he
[1:25:30] would take dust he took dirt and he spit
[1:25:33] in it made a little spittle clay and he
[1:25:35] put it on the Man's eyes he took water
[1:25:37] and he turned the water into wine he
[1:25:40] took something and he turned he took the
[1:25:42] bread and he multiplied it he took the
[1:25:44] fish and he multiplied but in this day
[1:25:48] this day he would speak his creative
[1:25:51] word and say Let There Be squirrels
[1:25:54] and there was squirrels it was a
[1:25:58] creative word can you say Amen think of
[1:26:01] it Church think of the day that you're
[1:26:03] living
[1:26:05] in say to this mountain amen say to this
[1:26:10] mountain see so now who were the elect
[1:26:13] of each age those who believed and
[1:26:16] accepted the message and all the light
[1:26:19] it was when sent forth to the age do you
[1:26:23] believe that what who was the elect
[1:26:26] those that believed and received the
[1:26:29] message that was sent to them in the age
[1:26:32] they were living in see and they are the
[1:26:35] ones who were truly filled with the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost for brother Brown said the true
[1:26:41] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:26:43] Ghost is for the believer to receive the
[1:26:45] word for the age in which he
[1:26:49] lives amen yes sir what was that elect
[1:26:53] they were over Overcomers of that age
[1:26:57] brother Ram says each son out of each
[1:26:59] Church age overcome the temptation of
[1:27:02] that age that was the elect amen they
[1:27:05] overcome the temptation of the age they
[1:27:08] were living in amen see he overcome the
[1:27:11] Beast overcome his mark That's
[1:27:13] Catholicism uh protestantism
[1:27:16] denominationalism see who overcome the
[1:27:19] Beast his Mark the letter of his name
[1:27:21] see they were Overcomers but notice now
[1:27:24] what Paul said but they without us
[1:27:27] cannot be made perfect brother Brandon
[1:27:30] uses that scripture for us today they
[1:27:33] without us everybody say us cannot be
[1:27:37] made perfect well then who is this us
[1:27:40] amen well they're the ones that are uh
[1:27:44] overcoming this last Church age brother

[1:28:23] that's the US they without us if they
[1:28:26] could overcome we've got overcoming to
[1:28:29] do do you believe that if they overcome
[1:28:32] and they overcome by the message of the
[1:28:34] hour in their day they lived it they
[1:28:37] believed it they confessed
[1:28:40] it and if they overcome then we must
[1:28:43] overcome and the way we can do it is by
[1:28:45] the message of the hour yes sir that's
[1:28:49] right you say well I thought it said you
[1:28:51] know overcome the Lamb by the word of
[1:28:53] their testimony well what is your
[1:28:55] testimony it's
[1:28:57] confession say the same thing as by the
[1:29:01] word of their confession can you sayen
[1:29:03] then what are you going to confess some
[1:29:05] doctor so and so you're going to confess
[1:29:07] what what you know the the the physici
[1:29:10] said you going to confess what you know
[1:29:12] what your feelings say and all these
[1:29:14] things no you're going to confess what
[1:29:15] the word of God says for this age God
[1:29:18] says I'm the heir of promise for this
[1:29:22] age so
[1:29:24] we we find now and I'll try to hurry but
[1:29:29] as message Believers we also know that
[1:29:32] there there are going to be those who
[1:29:34] receive eternal life that are not part
[1:29:37] of the
[1:29:38] bride and they are not the
[1:29:43] elect but neither do they inherit all
[1:29:47] things according to Matthew 25 the
[1:29:51] foolish virgin will be given eternal
[1:29:53] life brother Bri said they missed being
[1:29:55] the bride because they did not have the
[1:29:57] Holy Spirit that's right they missed
[1:29:59] being in the Millennium he said but
[1:30:02] these people being a separated
[1:30:04] god-loving people and trying to abide in
[1:30:07] the word according to what they knew of
[1:30:10] it and being a help in the work of the
[1:30:12] Lord will come up at the end time
[1:30:16] another place he says they will be
[1:30:17] judged according to the way they treated
[1:30:19] the light that they received you say
[1:30:23] Amen and now that part will be up to
[1:30:26] Christ see they they were not lost
[1:30:29] though see then we find according to
[1:30:33] Matthew as well that there is going to
[1:30:35] be those who receive eternal life due to
[1:30:38] being good to the bride now the Bible
[1:30:41] calls them righteous they are called the
[1:30:45] righteous see but they are not the bride
[1:30:48] for they are standing before the white
[1:30:51] Throne judgment being judged ain't that
[1:30:54] right see the bride will not be judged
[1:30:58] but rather she will be sitting with him
[1:31:01] in the
[1:31:04] throne ain't that right not not not
[1:31:08] standing in
[1:31:09] judgment see see brother BR says it was
[1:31:13] God's purpose to bring forth a people
[1:31:15] like unto himself that would be a word
[1:31:18] bride now foolish virgin is not a word
[1:31:22] bride that's true
[1:31:24] amen a ain't that right whoever else is
[1:31:27] not a word bride see there's going to be
[1:31:30] those that receive eternal life but
[1:31:32] they're not word bride but God's
[1:31:35] intention was to bring forth a people
[1:31:38] like unto
[1:31:41] himself that would be a word bride she
[1:31:44] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:31:46] world in him she was forn beloved before
[1:31:52] she was ever brought forth during the
[1:31:54] ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by
[1:31:57] his blood and can never everybody say
[1:31:59] can never come into
[1:32:03] condemnation she can never be in the
[1:32:06] Judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:32:10] unto
[1:32:11] her that's the
[1:32:13] bride what is it she's been
[1:32:16] redeemed now uh Jesus said in John 5:24
[1:32:21] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:32:22] heareth my word
[1:32:24] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:32:27] everlasting life notice brother Brown
[1:32:29] said that is the believer is already
[1:32:32] everybody say already is already the
[1:32:35] recipient of eternal life which he has
[1:32:39] in his possession now that's right hello
[1:32:44] not going to receive it but you have it
[1:32:48] now you are the recipient of eternal
[1:32:51] life and have it now in your your
[1:32:54] possession and shall not come into
[1:32:56] condemnation in other words brother
[1:32:58] Braham said shall not come into the
[1:33:00] Judgment but is passed permanently from
[1:33:04] Death unto
[1:33:07] life well aren't you glad for that amen
[1:33:11] now all everybody say all who are not
[1:33:15] part of the Bride will have to stand
[1:33:19] before that white Throne
[1:33:21] judgment and will be judged according to
[1:33:24] their
[1:33:25] Works amen why because they did not have
[1:33:32] blood they they they they were not
[1:33:35] loosed they did not come to a perfect
[1:33:40] loosening brother Braham said if it's
[1:33:42] perfect blood that brings perfect brings
[1:33:45] the loosening then it is a perfect
[1:33:51] loosening so now brother brandham he
[1:33:54] says see there will be both righteous
[1:33:56] and unrighteous come before the white
[1:33:58] Throne judgment righteous and
[1:34:01] unrighteous not the bride but yet God
[1:34:04] calls them righteous that's see now uh
[1:34:08] uh Jesus himself taught this in Matthew
[1:34:12] 25:32 you if you go home read the whole
[1:34:15] whole chapter there uh well you can
[1:34:18] start with 32 on down but and before him
[1:34:21] shall be gathered all nations and he
[1:34:23] shall separate them from one uh one from
[1:34:26] another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep
[1:34:28] from the goats notice this separation
[1:34:32] happens at the white Throne judgment but
[1:34:35] the bride the separation for the bride
[1:34:37] happens here on this
[1:34:41] Earth why how By the Waters of
[1:34:46] Separation by the word the water of the
[1:34:50] word that washes us separates us
[1:34:55] but there is a separating that is going
[1:34:57] to take place at the white Throne
[1:35:00] judgment and the 46th verse and these
[1:35:03] shall go away into Everlasting
[1:35:06] punishment but the righteous into
[1:35:09] eternal life not speaking of the Bride
[1:35:11] she's already got eternal life she's
[1:35:14] possessed her now ain't that right so
[1:35:18] now
[1:35:19] notice many many names are cast into the
[1:35:22] Everlasting punish M into Everlasting
[1:35:25] punishment were written in the Lamb's
[1:35:27] Book of Life now if if you look he he
[1:35:30] she separates the righteous now what
[1:35:33] what is that why because they were good
[1:35:35] to the
[1:35:36] bride ain't that right the righteous
[1:35:39] receive eternal life but here there were
[1:35:42] many names brother Braham said who are
[1:35:45] cast into Everlasting punishment and
[1:35:47] their names were written not in the
[1:35:48] Lamb's Book of Life but the book of life
[1:35:51] but they were blotted out I want you you
[1:35:53] notice how important this is they were
[1:35:56] blotted out because they failed to honor
[1:35:58] the people of God who were living the
[1:36:00] manifested who were the Living
[1:36:02] manifested Word living Epistles for
[1:36:04] their day right think of
[1:36:08] that there's a people that receive
[1:36:10] eternal life that that that come into
[1:36:12] eternal life that are allowed to go into
[1:36:14] eternal life by being good to God's
[1:36:17] people and there's people that have
[1:36:19] their names blotted out and C they're
[1:36:21] cast into the Lake of Fire amen uh uh uh
[1:36:26] how they treated yeah on because they
[1:36:31] failed to honor the people of God who
[1:36:33] were the living manifested word for
[1:36:35] their day another place those of the
[1:36:38] world system churches who fought the
[1:36:40] bride will be those whose names are
[1:36:44] removed that is who will lose out they
[1:36:48] will be cast into the Lake of Fire but
[1:36:51] then the righteous are allowed to go
[1:36:53] into eternal life because they were good
[1:36:56] to the bride notice now brother Brown
[1:36:59] said now speaking of that righteous they
[1:37:01] are not his Brethren that would make
[1:37:04] them joint hirs with
[1:37:08] Jesus they are not hirs to anything but
[1:37:14] life ain't that right they share No
[1:37:17] Throne or Etc with him their names must
[1:37:21] have been in the Book of Life and not
[1:37:24] removed now because of their love of the
[1:37:27] people of God they are recognized and
[1:37:31] saved no doubt these served and helped
[1:37:34] the children of God perhaps like
[1:37:35] Nicodemus and Gale they stood for the
[1:37:38] children in the time of trouble ain't
[1:37:40] that right so so there there's that
[1:37:43] foolish virgin there's the friends or or
[1:37:46] we call it Friends of the Bride or
[1:37:47] people that were good to the bride uh
[1:37:50] and such stood for them and and things
[1:37:52] like that and and then according to
[1:37:55] Revelations 6 and9 uh through 11 there
[1:37:58] were the souls under the altar which
[1:38:02] brother Bram uh uh tells us that they
[1:38:04] were the Jews and they're given a white
[1:38:08] robe which shows that they are given
[1:38:11] eternal
[1:38:12] life but brother Brown said these were
[1:38:15] not born again people with eternal life
[1:38:17] as their
[1:38:19] possession that's
[1:38:21] hello they are allowed into eternal life
[1:38:26] at that white Throne
[1:38:30] judgment see he says but they were slain
[1:38:33] for the word of God for the testimony
[1:38:35] which they held and they received life
[1:38:39] because of their stand for the word of
[1:38:41] God see these Jews aren't born of his
[1:38:44] Spirit they don't even believe that
[1:38:46] Jesus is the
[1:38:47] Messiah but as they were blinded by God
[1:38:51] for the Gentile sake God gave them
[1:38:53] eternal life on the grounds that though
[1:38:56] they could not come to him yet they were
[1:38:58] truly faithful to all the word that they
[1:39:01] knew and died for it as multitudes died
[1:39:04] under Hitler Stalin Etc and yet will
[1:39:09] die ain't that a merciful
[1:39:14] god now those who are not part of the
[1:39:18] Bride see uh uh or those who are part of
[1:39:22] the Bride they are already
[1:39:25] recipients of eternal life and no one
[1:39:29] else I don't care how CLA they claim to
[1:39:32] be saved if they're not part of the
[1:39:34] Bride they ain't
[1:39:39] recipients you say
[1:39:41] Amen see so but these These are allowed
[1:39:45] to go into eternal life at the white
[1:39:48] Throne judgment now notice I hope this
[1:39:51] is all right uh uh won't keep much
[1:39:54] longer but John 5:28 Jesus said Marvel
[1:39:57] not at this for the hour is coming in
[1:39:59] the which that all that are in the grave
[1:40:02] shall hear his voice everybody say all
[1:40:06] all that are in the graves shall hear
[1:40:08] his voice and shall come forth they that
[1:40:12] have done good unto the resurrection of
[1:40:14] life and they that have done evil unto
[1:40:17] the resurrection of
[1:40:20] damnation notice that scripture is is
[1:40:23] not speaking of the
[1:40:26] Rapture for there is only one group of
[1:40:29] people that comes forth in the
[1:40:31] resurrection at the time of
[1:40:33] rapture so then this is speaking of the
[1:40:37] second
[1:40:39] Resurrection now there are only two
[1:40:42] resurrections ain't that right the Bible
[1:40:45] preaches teaches us that see the first
[1:40:48] resurrection is for is only for the
[1:40:50] bride those that have already are have
[1:40:54] eternal life as their
[1:40:56] possession see they go in the Rapture
[1:41:00] see and and so the first resurrection is
[1:41:03] for the bride only see now 1
[1:41:05] Thessalonians 4:15 speaks of that for
[1:41:08] this we say unto you by the word of the
[1:41:10] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[1:41:13] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:41:15] prevent them which are asleep for the
[1:41:17] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:41:19] with the Shout with the voice of the
[1:41:21] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[1:41:24] dead in Christ not all that are in the
[1:41:28] graves Only The Dead In Christ shall
[1:41:31] rise
[1:41:33] first what is it those that make up the
[1:41:36] bride that's right the elect out of
[1:41:39] every age can you say Amen so this is
[1:41:42] the first resurrection which happens at
[1:41:45] the time of rapture now uh uh if you
[1:41:49] look uh Revelations 20 and 1 we'll start
[1:41:52] there and I saw an angel come down from
[1:41:54] heaven having the key of the bottomless
[1:41:57] pit and a great chain in his hand and he
[1:42:00] laid hold on the dragon that old serpent
[1:42:02] which is the devil and Satan and bound
[1:42:05] him a thousand years and cast him into
[1:42:08] the bottomless pit and shut him up and
[1:42:10] set a seal upon him that he should
[1:42:12] deceive the Nations no more till the
[1:42:15] Thousand Years should be fulfilled and
[1:42:18] after that he must be loosed a little
[1:42:20] season and I saw Thrones and that set
[1:42:23] upon them and judgment was given unto
[1:42:27] them and I saw the souls of them that
[1:42:29] were beheaded for the witness of Jesus
[1:42:32] and for the word of God and which had
[1:42:34] not worshiped the Beast neither the His
[1:42:36] Image neither had received his Mark upon
[1:42:39] their foreheads or in their hands and
[1:42:41] they lived and reigned with Christ A
[1:42:44] Thousand Years speaking of the
[1:42:46] Millennium that's the bride but the rest
[1:42:51] of the Dead live Liv not again until the
[1:42:55] thousand years was finished this is the
[1:42:57] first
[1:42:59] resurrection can you say Amen in other
[1:43:02] words see the bride amen that that that
[1:43:05] has come forth is the first part of that
[1:43:07] first resurrection blessed everybody say
[1:43:10] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:43:15] the First Resurrection on such the
[1:43:18] second death hath no power but they
[1:43:20] shall be priest of God and of Christ and
[1:43:23] shall reign with him a thousand
[1:43:26] years so remember those who are part of
[1:43:30] that first resurrection they are Hees of
[1:43:34] all things aren't you glad for that
[1:43:38] blessed are you who are part of that
[1:43:41] first

[1:43:45] closing did you know that only the bride
[1:43:48] will be living in that City that's true
[1:43:51] amen Revelations 22:14 blessed are they

[1:44:04] to enter in through the gates into the

[1:44:10] the
[1:44:11] Overcomer how many Overcomers do we have

[1:44:16] Overcomer ain't that right amen see amen
[1:44:20] because you go go look in the Old
[1:44:22] Testament or in in the church ages God

[1:44:26] life he that overcometh will I give unto
[1:44:29] him the tree of life amen ain't that
[1:44:33] right see now notice see it's it's it's
