[23:05] I just
[23:09] last first two nights I just felt like I

[23:17] hopeless

[23:39] believe that with all my heart and today
[23:40] I can say I am redeemed I am made whole
[23:43] again in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:45] [Music]
[23:47] foreign
[23:54] scripture in the entire Bible
[23:57] I read it Saturn I believe it was
[24:00] Saturday morning
[24:01] and God really spoke to me he reminded
[24:03] me through this scripture
[24:05] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[24:08] thee o Jacob and he that formed thee o
[24:11] Israel fear not
[24:12] for I have redeemed Thee I have called
[24:15] thee by name Thou Art mine
[24:18] [Music]
[24:19] and I put my name in that scripture and
[24:21] I'm going to read again
[24:22] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[24:25] thee Jordan and he that formed thee
[24:28] Jordan fear not for I have redeemed Thee
[24:30] I have called thee by name Thou Art mine
[24:33] Jordan Hallelujah and I'm so thankful
[24:36] for that
[24:39] so thankful
[24:41] so thankful the Deep still calls to the
[24:44] deep and the Deep will still respond and

[24:48] so thankful

[1:39:45] together here for a word of prayer
[1:39:47] Heavenly Father

[1:39:51] the service of the preaching of your
[1:39:52] word Lord we fill your presence in this
[1:39:55] building this morning
[1:39:56] and father we know that you're not in a
[1:39:58] tomb in Jerusalem you're not in a grave
[1:40:00] in Jeffersonville this morning Lord
[1:40:02] You're not buried in history books in a
[1:40:04] religious Library somewhere
[1:40:06] but Lord you're right here this morning
[1:40:08] in the power of your Resurrection
[1:40:10] learn the same you the same God that
[1:40:13] walked on water that changed the lives
[1:40:15] of humanity two thousand years ago
[1:40:17] you're right here this morning changing
[1:40:19] lives and changing hearts and Lord as
[1:40:22] the songs of design have been sung the
[1:40:23] people Lord have rejoiced we feel angels
[1:40:26] in this building Lord father we're under
[1:40:28] the influence of a supernatural being
[1:40:30] now Lord may you send your grace in the
[1:40:32] meeting May you take these things up on
[1:40:34] our heart Lord Place them into the lives
[1:40:36] of your people Lord for those that would
[1:40:37] be Lord battling in their bodies this
[1:40:39] morning are weary I pray God that you
[1:40:41] would bring a refreshing once more Lord
[1:40:43] to the hearts of your children Lord now
[1:40:45] father we commit this meeting in our
[1:40:47] faithful hands in the name of the Lord
[1:40:49] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[1:40:51] Believers says
[1:40:52] amen and amen The Book of Daniel the
[1:40:55] ninth chapter
[1:40:57] he loved the Lord this morning
[1:40:59] and in the first verse of Daniel 9 the
[1:41:02] Bible says in the first year of Darius
[1:41:05] the son of assurus of the seed of the
[1:41:07] medes which was made King
[1:41:10] over the realm of the Chaldeans in the
[1:41:13] first year of his Reign I Daniel
[1:41:15] understood by books the number of the
[1:41:18] years were of the word of the Lord came
[1:41:20] to Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:41:23] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[1:41:25] of Jerusalem
[1:41:27] and I set my face unto the Lord God to
[1:41:31] seek my prayer and supplication so
[1:41:33] whatever Daniel was reading had power to
[1:41:36] move him he began to pray in
[1:41:38] supplication with fasting and sackcloth
[1:41:40] and Ashes now I want to skip down to the
[1:41:42] 20th verse of Daniel 9. the Bible says
[1:41:45] and while I was speaking and praying and
[1:41:49] confessing my sin and the sin of My
[1:41:51] People Israel and presenting my
[1:41:53] supplication before the Lord my God for
[1:41:56] the Holy Mountain of my God yay while I
[1:41:59] was whilst I was speaking in prayer even
[1:42:01] the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the
[1:42:03] vision at the beginning being caused to
[1:42:06] fly swiftly touch me about the time of
[1:42:09] the evening oblation and he informed me
[1:42:11] now listen to this he informed me so
[1:42:14] whatever Daniel's reading is information
[1:42:15] but I'll say it like this it's revealed
[1:42:18] instruction
[1:42:19] he informed me and talked with me and
[1:42:22] said oh Daniel I have now come forth to
[1:42:24] give the skill and understanding
[1:42:26] somebody say understanding
[1:42:28] at the beginning of thy supplication the
[1:42:30] Commandment came forth and I come to
[1:42:32] show thee for thou art greatly beloved
[1:42:34] therefore understood now does that word
[1:42:36] again understood the matter and
[1:42:39] considered the vision seventy weeks are
[1:42:42] determined upon thy people and upon the
[1:42:43] holy city to finish the transgression to
[1:42:46] make an end of sin to make a
[1:42:47] Reconciliation for iniquity to bring an
[1:42:49] everlasting righteousness and to seal up
[1:42:51] the vision and prophecy and to anoint
[1:42:54] the most holy now I just want to read
[1:42:56] the first part of verse 25 know
[1:42:58] therefore and understand know therefore
[1:43:02] and understand if you read the rest of
[1:43:04] that chapter you will read the vision in
[1:43:07] plain detail but I want to say that
[1:43:09] there know therefore and understand we
[1:43:12] asked for this morning to add the
[1:43:13] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:43:14] you can have your seats here this
[1:43:16] morning for just a few moments I want to
[1:43:18] by the help of the Lord to speak to you
[1:43:20] here and if I will title this sermon
[1:43:22] today I want to speak to you on your
[1:43:24] ticket out of here
[1:43:26] your ticket out of here the word ticket
[1:43:29] means a piece of paper or a small card
[1:43:32] that gives the holder a certain right
[1:43:34] especially to enter a place to travel by
[1:43:38] public transport or to participate in an
[1:43:40] event it means to give the holder a
[1:43:43] certain right especially to enter a
[1:43:45] place so you're leaving one place and
[1:43:47] going into another to travel by public
[1:43:50] transport or to participate in an event
[1:43:53] now I titled that this morning your
[1:43:56] ticket out of here but for a theme out
[1:43:58] of that I want to say this I believe
[1:44:00] that I'm speaking to people this morning
[1:44:02] who are ordained to the message of the
[1:44:04] hour I believe I believe we're not here
[1:44:06] just as church members we're not here
[1:44:08] just taking up time or just feeling pews
[1:44:11] or just going through religious duties
[1:44:12] but I believe amen that we are here and
[1:44:15] we are here for a purpose and we are
[1:44:17] here and we have been chosen to be here
[1:44:19] we didn't put ourselves here amen but
[1:44:21] God chose us to be here in John 15 16
[1:44:23] Jesus said he have not chosen me but I
[1:44:27] have chosen you and ordained you that
[1:44:29] you should bring forth and fruit should
[1:44:31] remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of
[1:44:33] the father in my name amen he may give
[1:44:36] it to you amen I believe that we were
[1:44:39] ordained amen by the foreordination of
[1:44:42] God says it very plain he says I believe
[1:44:44] in the foreordination of God he said
[1:44:47] it's all together by Grace it's not by
[1:44:49] desire it's by Grace he's speaking of
[1:44:51] his own birth he said when they opened
[1:44:53] up the window we had an old grease
[1:44:55] candle there they said to make light I
[1:44:57] don't know whether you've had it or seen
[1:44:58] it or not he said but burn that old Pine
[1:45:00] not through the night to make the life
[1:45:02] and when they opened the window up the
[1:45:04] morning at five o'clock in the morning
[1:45:05] when I was born there was a lot he said
[1:45:07] we have the picture of it circled in the
[1:45:09] room hung over the bed where I was
[1:45:10] standing now do you see why I have to
[1:45:13] believe in the fore-ordination of God
[1:45:15] see it's out of a sinful family none of
[1:45:17] them even went to church another in
[1:45:19] profess religion on either side amen but
[1:45:21] God in His Grace by his Mercy amen I
[1:45:24] can't stop here because I preach here
[1:45:25] all day but but God in his grace amen by
[1:45:28] his Mercy is the reason we're sitting
[1:45:30] here today we're not sitting here
[1:45:32] because of what family we come out of
[1:45:34] we're not sitting here because of what
[1:45:36] church we attend or what background
[1:45:37] we've got we're sitting here because God
[1:45:40] by his grace and his Mercy amen has
[1:45:43] allowed us to be here then I believe if
[1:45:45] God has allowed us to be here then we
[1:45:47] should be in joy in the thing amen that
[1:45:49] he's allowed us to be here to be a part
[1:45:51] of amen he didn't put us here to be a
[1:45:53] part of the Republican Party he didn't
[1:45:55] put his shield to be a part of the
[1:45:57] democratic party amen but he put us here
[1:45:59] to be a witness and in a lost and dying
[1:46:01] amen sinful and adulterous generation
[1:46:04] amen that the son of righteousness would
[1:46:06] arise with healing in his wings and
[1:46:08] would return in this age to declare amen
[1:46:11] that I'm not dead but I'm alive I'm
[1:46:13] still moving I'm still healing I'm still
[1:46:15] saving I'm still giving the Holy Ghost I
[1:46:18] believe the hour has come Amen to move
[1:46:20] out of the shallow Waters to move amen
[1:46:22] out of the ankle and need Waters I think
[1:46:24] it's time to get in the swimming
[1:46:26] Daughters of the stability of the
[1:46:28] message of the hour Amen to move Beyond
[1:46:30] just going to church to move Beyond just
[1:46:32] going to conventions to move Beyond just
[1:46:34] can't meet and experiences amen but to
[1:46:37] move into a place of authority with
[1:46:39] Jesus Christ where you can back every
[1:46:41] devil and hell up and remind that devil
[1:46:43] I didn't buy my way in this amen you
[1:46:46] didn't put me in this brother Mark God
[1:46:48] placed me here from before the
[1:46:50] foundation of the world and if God
[1:46:52] hadn't been on my side I wouldn't be
[1:46:54] standing here this morning but because
[1:46:56] God was on my side there wasn't enough
[1:46:58] devil's hand there ain't enough Devils
[1:47:00] now and there ain't enough devils in the
[1:47:02] future to defeat this bride
[1:47:05] we have been ordained for a Time such as
[1:47:07] this we have been ordained we have been
[1:47:10] chosen we have been placed here listen I
[1:47:12] believe the word is in the people
[1:47:14] because the people is in the word amen I
[1:47:17] believe the word is in the church
[1:47:18] because the church is in the word
[1:47:20] therefore we're not established in what
[1:47:23] God did we're not established in a in a
[1:47:25] history lesson we are established in
[1:47:28] present truth
[1:47:30] we are established in present truth now
[1:47:33] amen I've just got to read this to you
[1:47:34] because I find it very powerful that
[1:47:36] brother Branham 1965 is ordaining some
[1:47:39] men of God to preach the measure to
[1:47:41] preach the word and he said here in 1965
[1:47:44] this God ever change his mind he said
[1:47:46] anybody this brother comes up to be
[1:47:47] ordained he said does anybody know
[1:47:49] brother Merlin Anthony he's new to me he
[1:47:51] says well I'm with the Salvation Army do
[1:47:53] you remember me oh yes he said you're
[1:47:55] from the Salvation Army that's right I
[1:47:57] remember him sure I know him see how
[1:47:59] many knows him to be a man of God Amen
[1:48:01] how many believes God is working with
[1:48:03] him raise your hand they said amen he
[1:48:05] said will you pray for him he said now
[1:48:07] brother we know that you're coming from
[1:48:09] a great group of people the Salvation
[1:48:10] Army they do a great work he said they
[1:48:13] do a great work on the street we can say
[1:48:14] nothing against the Nazarene we can say
[1:48:16] nothing against the Pentecostal or the
[1:48:18] Salvation Army or any of them they
[1:48:20] aren't Brethren but you see we believe
[1:48:22] that we are carriers of a great message
[1:48:24] for this very hour that we're living in
[1:48:27] do you want to do that with us and the
[1:48:29] man said amen amen I find it powerful
[1:48:31] that brother Branham amen was not
[1:48:33] blasting what they were doing he was not
[1:48:35] he was not standing there amen trying to
[1:48:38] tell him how wrong they were amen but he
[1:48:40] was just showing Merlin amen you were
[1:48:42] not ordained to further the work of the
[1:48:44] Salvation Army you were not ordained to
[1:48:46] carry on the Pentecostal tradition I'm
[1:48:48] not ordaining you to be another Street
[1:48:50] worker for the Salvation Army amen but
[1:48:53] if you want to carry this message I'm
[1:48:55] going to ordain you Amen to carry this
[1:48:57] great message and let me just go on
[1:48:59] record and say I was not ordained and I
[1:49:01] was not brought up on the earth Amen to
[1:49:03] continue the traditions of denomination
[1:49:05] amen but God who is rich in Mercy placed
[1:49:09] this seed in my soul from before the
[1:49:11] foundation I was born to preach this
[1:49:13] message I was born to believe this
[1:49:15] message and if I was born to preach it
[1:49:18] and there are some people here that was
[1:49:19] born to believe it if there's some men
[1:49:21] here that was born to preaching or some
[1:49:24] young men here that's born to believe it
[1:49:26] if there was some men ordained to say
[1:49:28] what a prophet said about the way a girl
[1:49:30] on a dress and there's some young ladies
[1:49:32] on the face of the Earth this morning
[1:49:34] that is ordained to manifest amen the
[1:49:37] word and the age they're living it's
[1:49:39] very clear we are not here to play games
[1:49:41] we are not here to reduce this message
[1:49:43] down they're just some shouting
[1:49:45] Hallelujah time this is the Revival of
[1:49:48] the Bride this is the Revelation that
[1:49:50] will change your body let me go ahead
[1:49:52] and say it's your ticket out of here
[1:49:54] it's not a book on the Shelf it's not a
[1:49:58] picture on the wall it's not a tradition
[1:50:00] it's not a group of men it's not a
[1:50:02] personality it's your ticket for
[1:50:04] mortality into immortality it's your
[1:50:07] ticket from time back into eternity
[1:50:12] we are carriers of a great message let
[1:50:15] me put my voice with the voice of
[1:50:16] brother random it's a great message
[1:50:20] the message of the hour is a great
[1:50:21] message I know there's been a lot of
[1:50:23] craziness around it but it's a great
[1:50:25] message
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:27] secret messages in the message but it's
[1:50:30] still a great message
[1:50:34] it's in the message and just track them
[1:50:36] down to the bottom and you'll find a man
[1:50:37] but it's still a great message
[1:50:41] before one man twisted and the prophet
[1:50:43] said it
[1:50:44] and you was ordained to believe it
[1:50:47] and that's why some of y'all are sitting
[1:50:49] here and you had to fight your way out
[1:50:51] of false Doctrine to get where you are
[1:50:52] because you are not ordained to a man's
[1:50:55] idea about this message you were not
[1:50:57] ordained to what somebody thought that
[1:50:59] brother ran a man you was ordained to
[1:51:01] the revelation of the son of man by the
[1:51:04] appearing of Jesus in the AIDS that
[1:51:06] you're living I think it's a Ministry
[1:51:08] it's a message it's a positionally
[1:51:10] placing of the church Reverend said what
[1:51:12] has happened he said we've had a
[1:51:14] personal contact with God until all the
[1:51:16] intellectuals in the world cannot
[1:51:18] explain it from us listen we're not
[1:51:20] looking for personal contact we have
[1:51:23] personal contact and I propose to you
[1:51:25] this morning that we are carriers of a
[1:51:28] great message let me just go and say
[1:51:29] this brother Isaiah I can't help what
[1:51:31] others do I'm not here to correct them
[1:51:34] not here to fight with them I can't help
[1:51:35] what they do but as for me in my house
[1:51:38] go listen to reproach for the cause of
[1:51:40] the word and he comes down to the end
[1:51:41] and says as for me in my house he says
[1:51:44] we're going to serve the word amen and I
[1:51:47] think that to be a declaration of every
[1:51:49] family leaving this meeting this weekend
[1:51:51] as for me and my house we're going to
[1:51:54] serve this message that's for me in my
[1:51:56] house we're going to turn off every
[1:51:58] voice contrary to what a prophet has
[1:52:00] taught and we're going to give our lives
[1:52:02] to the message of the hour
[1:52:04] brother brother I'm sitting my friends I
[1:52:06] don't want to hurt feelings but I'm
[1:52:07] responsible for a message and that
[1:52:10] message is come out of this mess well
[1:52:12] glory to God I feel like preaching there
[1:52:14] that message is come out of this mess
[1:52:16] amen he said and if I call you out he
[1:52:18] said where am I going to take you
[1:52:19] Brandon Tabernacle he said it's the
[1:52:21] biggest mess as much as part as any of
[1:52:23] them he said but there's one place I can
[1:52:25] take you to where you are safe and
[1:52:27] protected from death and that is in
[1:52:29] Jesus Christ it's God's provided place
[1:52:32] of worship listen this message didn't
[1:52:34] call you amen from one mess to another
[1:52:37] this message called you amen from the
[1:52:39] message denomination for the woo from
[1:52:42] the confusion of Babylon into the
[1:52:44] perfect interpretation of the word and
[1:52:46] the age you're living come on Church
[1:52:48] there's not a man coming that can turn
[1:52:50] on the line the lights already been
[1:52:52] turned on there's not a Pride's Revival
[1:52:54] coming the bride's Revival is already
[1:52:56] here there's not another messenger
[1:52:58] coming we have the shout we have the
[1:53:01] voice we have the resurrection in our
[1:53:04] bodies this morning then it's time to
[1:53:06] rise up and remember who you are you're
[1:53:08] not a bunch of weak beat down help us
[1:53:10] hopeless church members you are the
[1:53:12] Invincible Army thank you
[1:53:15] you were prophesied in the Bible and
[1:53:18] you're now in fulfillment here this
[1:53:19] morning therefore we're not in a church
[1:53:22] we're not in a system we have been
[1:53:25] brought into God's provided place his
[1:53:27] name was put in a man his son Jesus
[1:53:30] Christ in which he Tabernacle himself
[1:53:32] and we are in that Tabernacle then what
[1:53:35] did Jeremiah say God say through
[1:53:38] Jeremiah he said before you was born I
[1:53:41] ordained thee a prophet I knew you and
[1:53:44] ordained you a prophet to the nation now
[1:53:46] look at this word ordained it means to
[1:53:48] give bestow Grant permit a scribe it
[1:53:50] means to employ devote consecrate means
[1:53:52] to dedicate in other words I dedicated
[1:53:54] you to be a prophet to the nation it
[1:53:57] means to give over to yield produce now
[1:53:59] Reverend says it very plain he said
[1:54:01] before Jeremiah ever come from his
[1:54:03] mother's womb he was ordained
[1:54:06] so God did not come down in the birthing
[1:54:08] room look at Jeremiah and say man that
[1:54:10] looks like a prophet right there
[1:54:13] but before he was ever conceived in his
[1:54:16] mother's womb in the back part of God's
[1:54:19] mind he was already a prophet to the
[1:54:21] nation can I make a connection for you
[1:54:23] before Daniel was ever born on the Earth
[1:54:25] he was ordained to believe Jeremiah's
[1:54:28] message that was going to be given to
[1:54:30] him by the angel Gabriel
[1:54:32] come on God does not send a message
[1:54:34] hoping somebody will believe it well I
[1:54:36] might as well preach I'm here this
[1:54:37] morning God does not send a message amen
[1:54:40] hoping somebody will show up to hear it
[1:54:42] amen but if God does something he's got
[1:54:45] somebody on the earth to receive it he
[1:54:47] did not go by the way or hoping the
[1:54:49] woman would be there but before he ever
[1:54:51] left his disciples he knew she would be
[1:54:54] there he knew what hair color she would
[1:54:56] have he knew what color clothes she
[1:54:58] would be wearing you know why because
[1:55:00] he's not a week old dirty Grandpa amen
[1:55:02] he's Jehovah he's Jehovah the Bible he's
[1:55:05] Jesus of the new and if he knows you he
[1:55:08] knows everything about you
[1:55:11] when God went by the well he knew she
[1:55:13] would be sitting there and he knew that
[1:55:15] that message would bring her amen from
[1:55:17] being a reject to society into being a
[1:55:20] testimony of the power the
[1:55:22] transformation of Jesus and this message
[1:55:24] has brought well I might as well preach
[1:55:25] I feel good this message has brought us
[1:55:28] we was a bunch of nobody's rejects Amen
[1:55:31] on our way to Hell amen but God who is
[1:55:34] rich in Mercy sent a message in this
[1:55:36] generation Destiny and it claims you a
[1:55:39] minute called you you're not a reject
[1:55:41] amen you're a daughter of God come on
[1:55:43] Brothers you're not a bunch of hopeless
[1:55:45] man you are sons of this last day
[1:55:48] children of God born in the world not by
[1:55:50] the blood of man not by the will of the
[1:55:52] father of your Earthly father but by the
[1:55:55] will of God
[1:55:57] so we have not come here looking for a
[1:55:59] purpose we have a specific purpose you
[1:56:02] didn't know you was cut me preach this
[1:56:03] morning but you are look at somebody
[1:56:04] next you didn't say specific purpose
[1:56:07] you're not just here for a purpose
[1:56:09] you're here for a specific purpose
[1:56:12] now brother Mark we can really hone down
[1:56:14] there couldn't we you're not here for
[1:56:16] just any purpose you're here for a
[1:56:19] specific purpose do you realize Moses
[1:56:21] was born for a specific purpose and that
[1:56:24] purpose was to deliver the children of
[1:56:26] God that could not help themselves the
[1:56:29] Bible says that Israel was born brought
[1:56:31] on the earth for a specific purpose now
[1:56:33] that was that out of Israel would be the
[1:56:36] cleanest bloodstream that the lineage of
[1:56:38] Jesus Christ would come out of now
[1:56:40] brother Ben turns and says now Jesus had
[1:56:42] a specific purpose he said he did not
[1:56:44] come to Calvary to die haphazard oh no
[1:56:47] he didn't come there and say well maybe
[1:56:48] I'll die and it'll be so pathetic some
[1:56:50] people amen will see that I died maybe
[1:56:52] they'll come and serve the Lord Jesus
[1:56:54] come for a specific purpose
[1:56:58] Jesus come for a specific purpose now
[1:57:01] let's just go and say what a prophet
[1:57:03] said he said the specific purpose was to
[1:57:06] redeem those who God by foreknowledge
[1:57:08] elected to come to him so then it's not
[1:57:11] of him that we love it's not of him that
[1:57:13] runeth but it's of God that showeth
[1:57:15] Mercy the only way you're here is God
[1:57:18] shows your mercy now let's just say it
[1:57:20] if Moses had a specific purpose and
[1:57:22] Israel had a specific purpose and Jesus
[1:57:25] had a specific purpose then don't tell
[1:57:27] me that I don't have a specific purpose
[1:57:29] the prophet of God said God did not make
[1:57:31] you and I just to see if he could do it
[1:57:32] he made us for a purpose you are here
[1:57:35] for a specific purpose no matter how
[1:57:38] little you are how big you are how
[1:57:40] important you are how unimportant you
[1:57:42] are you are here to serve a purpose amen
[1:57:44] let me say that again for that complex
[1:57:46] devil that's lingering in this building
[1:57:48] no matter how little you are how big you
[1:57:51] are how important you are how
[1:57:52] unimportant you are you are here to
[1:57:55] serve a purpose well brother Andrew
[1:57:57] Nobody Knows My Name no matter how big
[1:57:59] you are how little you are how important
[1:58:02] you are how unimportant you are you are
[1:58:04] here to serve a purpose well I'm just a
[1:58:06] little nobody on the backside of nowhere
[1:58:08] no matter how little you are you are
[1:58:10] here to serve a purpose you know what
[1:58:12] it's time you do it's time you pick up
[1:58:15] them devils and kick them in the
[1:58:18] kick him in the seat of the britches and
[1:58:20] send them back to the hell they come out
[1:58:22] of and remember you're not here amen by
[1:58:25] accident you're not here by happenstance
[1:58:27] you are here because God who hung the
[1:58:30] moon and placed the stars and put a
[1:58:32] water in the water and put a fire on the
[1:58:35] earth amen put a seed in your soul for a
[1:58:37] Time such as this I say we ought to back
[1:58:40] every Temple a men of complex back to
[1:58:42] the hell he come out of amen amen
[1:58:44] somebody might look at me and think I
[1:58:46] lost my mind I have amen you're not
[1:58:48] unimportant you're not too little amen
[1:58:51] come on David pick up your slingshots
[1:58:52] come on shamgar pick up the ox code you
[1:58:56] have been ordained for a specific
[1:58:57] purpose now I know why the devil don't
[1:58:59] want you to believe that it's because he
[1:59:01] wants you to believe he's going to
[1:59:02] destroy you before you fulfill that
[1:59:04] purpose but according to a Vindicated
[1:59:06] Prophet there is nothing coming that can
[1:59:09] destroy you until the purpose that God
[1:59:12] has brought you upon the Earth to
[1:59:13] fulfill has been fulfilled words of
[1:59:16] indicated profit when God is done with
[1:59:17] me on Earth in this life I am done with
[1:59:20] life well if that Devil's lingering
[1:59:22] around here this morning saying well I'm
[1:59:24] too weak and I'm too insignificant and I
[1:59:26] can't preach and I can't see amen I tell
[1:59:28] you what I'm sick of the I can't I'm
[1:59:30] sick of the excuses amen I don't care
[1:59:32] what family you come out of I don't care
[1:59:34] what tradition you come out of amen God
[1:59:37] Is Bigger than any family bloodline God
[1:59:39] Is Bigger than any tradition God is
[1:59:42] bigger than any curse that the devil's
[1:59:44] trying to place upon you amen come on
[1:59:46] shake yourself Samson the Philistines
[1:59:48] are upon you but your purpose was not
[1:59:50] Amen to serve Delilah your purpose was
[1:59:53] to slay them for his teens
[1:59:56] and nothing can harm us until the
[2:00:00] purpose that God has brought us on the
[2:00:02] earth to fulfill has been made manifest
[2:00:04] he said but Andrew God didn't call me
[2:00:06] well brother Ram said amen amen if you
[2:00:08] want to argue you got the wrong preacher
[2:00:09] because I'm going to tell you what
[2:00:10] brother said what God calls to be will
[2:00:13] be
[2:00:14] so come up with any excuse you want to
[2:00:17] but if God called you to me you'll be he
[2:00:20] said if God wants you to be a certain
[2:00:21] thing and he brings you to this earth to
[2:00:24] be that you'll be it you see because God
[2:00:26] calls by a Divine call then I say to you
[2:00:29] this morning God called you and he
[2:00:32] ordained you by the spirit to the
[2:00:34] message Jeremiah 1 said he ordained you
[2:00:36] John 15 said he ordained you amen look
[2:00:39] at first John 1 5 can I borrow your
[2:00:40] brother Jonathan amen this then is the
[2:00:42] message which we have heard of him and
[2:00:44] declare unto you that God is light in
[2:00:47] him is no Darkness at all look at this
[2:00:49] word message it is an announcement
[2:00:51] brother Sean it is a promise it is the
[2:00:54] act of a promising it is a promise given
[2:00:56] or to be given it is a promised good or
[2:00:58] a blessing remember said do you realize
[2:01:00] this seriousness of this you don't come
[2:01:02] to church just to hear a message or to
[2:01:04] see a messenger I mean you've come to
[2:01:06] hear the message and the message is the
[2:01:09] holy spirit taking the word of God and
[2:01:11] giving it to you the message of the hour
[2:01:14] is the whole Holy Spirit taking the word
[2:01:16] of God and giving it to you then then I
[2:01:20] got to say it amen that little complex
[2:01:22] if I'm unimportant I can't fulfill it
[2:01:24] amen the part of God said the highest of
[2:01:26] Heaven came down to make himself known
[2:01:28] to the lowest of the earth what did he
[2:01:30] do he bypassed all between him and them
[2:01:32] to make I'm paraphrasing her out there
[2:01:35] to make himself known to come and
[2:01:37] Brethren see come into the common
[2:01:38] herdsmen the greatest message of all
[2:01:41] time so between amen thank you brother
[2:01:43] Ron so the greatest of all time amen was
[2:01:46] coming to what the world will call the
[2:01:47] lowest of all time and there was a lot
[2:01:49] in between them that thought they were
[2:01:51] the greatest of all time and here's what
[2:01:53] God done he bypassed all those wannabes
[2:01:56] and went down to a bunch of nobodies
[2:01:58] because the one of these wanted to do it
[2:02:00] the way they wanted to do it amen but
[2:02:02] God said you're not going to deliver my
[2:02:04] message the way you think it ought to be
[2:02:05] delivered so I'm going to bypass the
[2:02:07] Kings I'm gonna bypass the potent page
[2:02:09] I'm gonna bypass the monarchs and I'm
[2:02:11] gonna go find me some old dumb Shepherds
[2:02:14] up on a hill that's just out there
[2:02:15] tending to their sheep and I'm going to
[2:02:17] ordain them and anoint him and I'm gonna
[2:02:20] put my words in their mouth and here's
[2:02:22] what they're going to say Messiah is
[2:02:24] here now
[2:02:26] glory to God should have got the most
[2:02:28] educated brother Kenny but he got the
[2:02:30] most illiterate you know why because
[2:02:32] they didn't have an education they
[2:02:34] wouldn't stand there and try to word it
[2:02:35] a better way they would just stand there
[2:02:37] and say if you got makeup on your face
[2:02:39] you might as well be called what you are
[2:02:42] they they wouldn't stand there and try
[2:02:44] to find politically amen correct words
[2:02:46] they would just stand there and say
[2:02:48] Messiah is here now and you know what I
[2:02:50] think it's high time I think it's time
[2:02:52] we get some preachers that's got some
[2:02:54] backbone to take the gloves off and just
[2:02:56] say what a prophet saying
[2:02:58] it may not be fancy it may not be
[2:03:02] popular but just say it you know why
[2:03:04] because God ordained you and chose you
[2:03:07] to say
[2:03:07] [Applause]
[2:03:09] some ask me other day they said how many
[2:03:11] pulpits have you lost I said as many as
[2:03:12] the message cost me
[2:03:15] oh brother Andrew hey man I won't back
[2:03:17] off of this message for nobody and
[2:03:19] neither should you well brother I'm not
[2:03:22] a preacher don't back off of this
[2:03:24] message for your family don't you back
[2:03:25] off of this message for some friendship
[2:03:27] somewhere and then don't you back off of
[2:03:29] this message and hide your face like a
[2:03:32] blessing Prophet you're not a blessing
[2:03:33] Prophet you are a bride that is
[2:03:35] unashamed of the identification of the
[2:03:38] sign of the Messiah in this age what is
[2:03:41] the message the message is the Messiah
[2:03:43] is here now well brother and if I say
[2:03:46] what brother and said I'll lose some
[2:03:47] friendships well you probably don't need
[2:03:49] him to begin with you just ought to go
[2:03:51] ahead and lose them so you can get
[2:03:52] around your real friends
[2:03:55] well glory to God I might as well shout
[2:03:57] brother Joe amen you might as well go
[2:04:00] ahead and lose your Society
[2:04:01] identification so you can get away from
[2:04:03] the chickens and get among some Eagles
[2:04:05] amen that when the Holy Ghost drops down
[2:04:08] in an old-fashioned Holy Ghost Gospel
[2:04:10] tent needing and the power of God begins
[2:04:12] to shake the building you can lose your
[2:04:14] dignity You Can Lose Yourself
[2:04:16] righteousness you can Surrender Your
[2:04:18] Prestige and you can embrace the
[2:04:20] manifestation of the Holy Ghost in the
[2:04:23] last days
[2:04:24] it should take it out of here I said
[2:04:27] that you're taking out of here if you're
[2:04:29] ashamed of you take it you're gonna stay
[2:04:31] right here
[2:04:33] but if you ever lose your reservation
[2:04:37] you will declare the key message Messiah
[2:04:40] is here now
[2:04:44] I just go ahead and say it God uses
[2:04:46] nobodies without consulting anybody
[2:04:52] I said God for the Jason uses nobodies
[2:04:55] without consulting anybody
[2:04:59] because I guarantee you there have been
[2:05:00] a lot of people said don't use Andrew
[2:05:02] and don't use Wayne and don't use Nathan
[2:05:04] don't you dare use man I mean I mean
[2:05:06] that guy's that guy's a firecracker
[2:05:08] don't you dare use him amen but God
[2:05:10] wanted somebody that would lose the
[2:05:12] shame to stand in the pulpit and just
[2:05:14] say what a prophet said so he went
[2:05:16] bypassed all the somebody's and found
[2:05:19] you come on Church
[2:05:21] y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[2:05:23] amen amen God rich and mercy what about
[2:05:25] it went out to meet Goliath and Goliath
[2:05:28] disdained him you know what the word
[2:05:29] this thing means it means to regard as
[2:05:32] worthless so David is looked at by the
[2:05:34] enemy as worthless but you know what I
[2:05:36] love about this before the enemy
[2:05:38] disdained David God already ordained him
[2:05:43] before the enemy said why do you send
[2:05:45] this little child out here to me why do
[2:05:48] you send this little ready amen young
[2:05:50] fellow out here am I a dog amen God said

[2:06:42] Fallen a false prophet We are following
[2:06:44] a true Prophet you know brother Ben
[2:06:46] preaches the message the way of a true
[2:06:48] prophet
[2:06:49] do you know in the church age book he
[2:06:51] tells you of the way of a true prophet
[2:06:52] he is he says it's to preach the whole
[2:06:55] word
[2:06:57] he said the true prophet of God in this
[2:06:59] last day will proclaim the whole word
[2:07:01] denominations will hate him his words
[2:07:04] may be as harsh as John the Baptist who
[2:07:06] called them vipers but the predestinated
[2:07:09] will hear I love this next part and
[2:07:12] we'll be ready for the rapture
[2:07:15] he will be disdained
[2:07:18] he will be viewed as worthless he will
[2:07:21] be viewed as a contempt as somebody that
[2:07:24] is a rebel but he will preach a word
[2:07:27] that will prepare you for the changing
[2:07:30] of your body then I say with everything
[2:07:31] within me layout of CH has received a
[2:07:35] scriptural message you say what do you
[2:07:37] mean by this term message of the hour
[2:07:38] remember said it's what they're getting
[2:07:40] at is it's God's promise of this hour
[2:07:42] that he promised what he would do see
[2:07:45] them the message of the hour actually
[2:07:47] interprets the hour
[2:07:49] the message of the hour interprets the
[2:07:52] hour that you're living in he said the
[2:07:55] message itself from the scriptures
[2:07:57] interprets to you the hour that we're
[2:07:59] living in now somebody asked for the ram
[2:08:01] they said well the bride of Christ have
[2:08:02] a Ministry before the Rapture he said
[2:08:04] well sure that's what's going on right
[2:08:06] now see the bride of Christ certainly
[2:08:08] it's the message of the hour so the
[2:08:11] ministry of the bride of Christ is the
[2:08:14] message of the hour that it's a message
[2:08:16] of the hour is the promise Amen to see
[2:08:18] Jesus the message of the hour is the
[2:08:21] promise to see Jesus now amen I'm going
[2:08:23] to borrow something from brother Ron
[2:08:24] amen if you don't like this message then
[2:08:26] you're dismissed
[2:08:29] foreign
[2:08:30] to be under this morning the message of
[2:08:33] the hour is the promise to see Jesus you
[2:08:36] say See Jesus why did he preach 21 times
[2:08:39] sir we would see Jesus amen because he
[2:08:42] was bringing it from Zacchaeus who had a
[2:08:44] desire to see Jesus and he said what he
[2:08:46] did was he climbed up a tree and he got
[2:08:48] up there and he found two limbs that
[2:08:50] come together and he met at the truck of
[2:08:52] the tree and there he sat down he said
[2:08:54] now that's a good place to sit we're
[2:08:56] two-ways meet amen that's yours and gods
[2:08:59] he said it's your idea and his he said
[2:09:01] that's a good time to sit down and think
[2:09:04] it over your own thoughts about him and
[2:09:06] what the word says He is what you think
[2:09:08] he is and with the word says he is here
[2:09:10] it is with the message of the hour is to
[2:09:13] your thinking and what the message of
[2:09:15] the hour is to his word he said that's
[2:09:17] the difference amen sit there and think
[2:09:20] it over a little while and I'll just go
[2:09:22] ahead and say this if you sit down at
[2:09:24] the trunk of the tree and you talk
[2:09:25] between you and the Lord when you get
[2:09:28] done talking here if you if you get rid
[2:09:30] of your idea and your thoughts here will
[2:09:33] be your conclusion the message is Christ
[2:09:38] have I got a witness here this morning
[2:09:40] that sat down at the trunk of that tree
[2:09:43] and they have come to this conclusion
[2:09:44] the message is Christ
[2:09:48] what about in the back the message is
[2:09:50] Christ what about it over here the
[2:09:52] message is Christ what about it here on
[2:09:54] the front I meant the message is Christ
[2:09:57] this message ain't a belt buckle this

[2:10:01] this message ain't brother Brown's
[2:10:02] replica of this briefcase this message
[2:10:04] is the deity of Jesus Christ not in the
[2:10:08] heavens but in the earth in the redeemed
[2:10:10] flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ this
[2:10:13] message is Christ and I'll say what a
[2:10:15] prophet said he said we're not come
[2:10:16] together to talk about the message we
[2:10:18] are come together to get in the message
[2:10:20] amen and the message is Christ he is the
[2:10:24] word see we're to get into it we're to
[2:10:27] get beneath it

[2:10:31] get beside it and we're sure not to get
[2:10:33] above it we are to get into it and then
[2:10:36] get beneath it you know why when you get
[2:10:38] into it and get beneath it it becomes
[2:10:41] your headship

[2:10:44] but remember I said the message of the
[2:10:45] hour is this apply the token Exodus 12
[2:10:48] he said I will pass through the land of
[2:10:50] Egypt watch them words pass through amen

[2:11:29] that token is your identification and he
[2:11:32] only recognizes the token that's the
[2:11:34] message of the hour and that's the
[2:11:36] message of this day that's the message

[2:18:13] not here this morning
[2:18:15] so does that mean Isaiah the third pool
[2:18:17] is not here amen no the third pool just
[2:18:20] changed Dwelling Places
[2:18:22] it moved from a profit now
[2:18:26] if that return Ministry Spirit wants to
[2:18:28] push I'll push back it moved from a
[2:18:30] prophet into his prophecy come on Church
[2:18:33] it moved from prophets profit to
[2:18:35] prophecy but come on Church once
[2:18:37] prophecy has been fulfilled it's no
[2:18:40] longer prophecy it's now history and a
[2:18:43] prophet preached an entire sermon called
[2:18:44] this day this scripture is fulfilled and
[2:18:47] showed you what was prophecy three years
[2:18:49] ago it's history today and what was
[2:18:52] prophecy prophecy just a few short years
[2:18:54] ago that there would be a bride's
[2:18:56] Revival we are the manifestation
[2:19:00] if you're looking for the bride's
[2:19:02] Revival then you're not looking at it if
[2:19:04] you're looking for the ultimate word
[2:19:06] then you're not looking at it but if you
[2:19:07] can see that this is that if you can see
[2:19:10] that this is the promises of God if you
[2:19:13] can see that this is the power to live a
[2:19:15] Victorious life if you can see that this
[2:19:17] is the way to overcome two hundred
[2:19:19] thousand thousand Devils then you gotta
[2:19:22] right to get your sword in your hand and
[2:19:25] This Means War oh This Means War the
[2:19:29] third pool meant War the third pool was
[2:19:31] not a picnic it was a battlefield
[2:19:33] because the bride was coming to the
[2:19:35] battlefield for the Battle of Truth

[2:20:09] as well keep going hat now there is no

[2:20:13] third pull is and I know what it does
[2:20:15] well Robinson I put my voice with the
[2:20:18] voice of William random this morning and
[2:20:19] say right here April 26th to the April
[2:20:22] 30th I have seen the third pool I know
[2:20:24] what it is
[2:20:27] and I know what it does
[2:20:30] the third pulley said is the great and
[2:20:33] final pull he said when he begins to
[2:20:35] declare his message see first pull is
[2:20:37] healing second pull is prophesied but
[2:20:40] the third poll is the opening of the
[2:20:43] word the Mysteries revealed there is no
[2:20:46] more higher order to reveal the word
[2:20:47] than prophets but the only way the
[2:20:49] prophet can be Vindicated is by the word
[2:20:51] and remember you're right there's a
[2:20:53] preaching on it up here you can't hardly
[2:20:54] read remember the third pool was the
[2:20:57] opening of them Seven Seals remember the

[2:21:03] Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's
[2:21:06] been sealed in the word somebody tell
[2:21:07] you they don't have time for the third

[2:21:31] real soldier of the cross of Jesus
[2:21:34] Christ then take the penny waste off and
[2:21:37] put on the six Ephesians six ailment of

[2:26:08] I've got One Life to Live
[2:26:10] Mr Sonic I Got One Life to Live I'm not
[2:26:13] going to waste it searching this message
[2:26:14] trying to find where brother Brown got
[2:26:16] his words Twisted just to prove he was a
[2:26:18] man
[2:26:19] I'm sorry I don't have piles of errors
[2:26:21] in this message but I do have files
[2:26:24] where a prophet said this is the
[2:26:26] infallible Vindicated spoken word
[2:26:30] yeah I got the courage to say it Thomas
[2:26:32] it's the absolute
[2:26:36] get in it
[2:26:37] [Applause]
[2:26:40] it should take it out of here
[2:26:43] what is it it's the announcement that
[2:26:45] the word has become the church and the
[2:26:47] church has become the word the bride now
[2:26:49] remember what do you brother Andrew what
[2:26:50] are you getting that brother Batman
[2:26:51] statically teaches us amen that
[2:26:53] scripture
[2:26:55] I don't know if that door right there is
[2:26:56] gonna be enough for that be able to get
[2:26:57] out of here
[2:26:59] he Running Scared right now
[2:27:03] because we're not just around the
[2:27:04] message we're beneath it
[2:27:06] [Applause]
[2:27:08] we're not just standing around looking
[2:27:10] at it I don't know why I'm going here
[2:27:12] but I'm going to go we're not just
[2:27:13] standing here walking around saying Oh
[2:27:15] My My My look what God did but there's a
[2:27:18] people by the way that is stepped
[2:27:21] they've literally taken a step into the
[2:27:24] message
[2:27:25] and they are the message now you say
[2:27:27] brother Andrew how can you prove this
[2:27:28] because the prophet said he said the
[2:27:30] bride and the church or he said the
[2:27:32] bride or the church should become the
[2:27:33] bride it's God manifested flesh now in
[2:27:35] the flesh of his bride for the bride and
[2:27:37] the husband is the same self-flesh
[2:27:40] brother Batman fatically teaches you
[2:27:43] that a prophecy which comes from
[2:27:44] scripture has a compound meaning he says
[2:27:47] it has a natural meaning then it has a
[2:27:50] spiritual meaning one place he says
[2:27:52] every Divine promise has and amen behind
[2:27:54] it can we put one there
[2:27:55] and we're so happy for that to know that
[2:27:58] all these prophecies and so forth most
[2:28:00] of them has a compound meaning again he
[2:28:02] says the cycle of time swings back over
[2:28:04] every so often history repeats itself
[2:28:06] and the scripture repeats itself down
[2:28:08] the age any scholar knows that that's
[2:28:10] ever studied from a spiritual standpoint
[2:28:12] watch the scripts repeat itself not just
[2:28:14] and Prophecy of the New Testament
[2:28:17] come right into this day
[2:28:22] to be fulfilled again
[2:28:28] brother Jesse Prophecy from the New
[2:28:31] Testament
[2:28:34] come right into this day
[2:28:36] to be fulfilled again
[2:28:39] oh God that's breaking for me
[2:28:43] prophecy come from the Old Testament
[2:28:46] about the Messiah into the New Testament
[2:28:49] and Jesus was the Fulfillment of the
[2:28:54] when you read Zechariah and you saw
[2:28:57] Jesus you saw the prophecy fulfilled
[2:28:59] when you read Malachi Jonathan you saw
[2:29:03] the prophecy but when you saw Jesus you
[2:29:05] saw it fulfilled why because the
[2:29:07] prophecy in the Old Testament came over
[2:29:09] in the New Testament and was fulfilled
[2:29:12] in the New Testament and in these last
[2:29:14] days
[2:29:16] the prophet of God said there would be
[2:29:19] another spoken word come on Church there
[2:29:21] would be another spoken word then what
[2:29:23] happened Jesus was the spoken word of
[2:29:26] Isaiah he was the spoken word of
[2:29:28] Zechariah he was a spoken word of Joel
[2:29:30] and when you saw Jesus you saw the
[2:29:33] Fulfillment of the prophecy that he'd
[2:29:35] come into the New Testament from the Old
[2:29:37] Testament well I might as well go and
[2:29:38] say it and there is prophecy in the New
[2:29:41] Testament
[2:29:43] but you know who is speaking of it's
[2:29:46] speaking of the Bride
[2:29:48] so just as you can read Joel look at
[2:29:50] Jesus and see the fulfillments I can
[2:29:53] read Ephesians where it says there'll be
[2:29:54] a bride without a spot without a recall
[2:29:57] without a blemish and I can look at you
[2:30:00] and I can say brother Diego this day
[2:30:03] this scripture is fulfilled come on
[2:30:05] church I can look there and say that
[2:30:08] Greater Works in this shall you do I'm
[2:30:10] on church that was Prophecy in the New
[2:30:12] Testament that has traveled over into
[2:30:15] this age to be fulfilled listen friends

[2:30:18] Works you are the Greater Works
[2:30:21] come on if you're looking for the

[2:30:36] the Old and New Testament is a compound
[2:30:39] scripture amen the prophecy and the
[2:30:41] Fulfillment is a compound then this
[2:30:44] message is a compound message you know
[2:30:46] what it means compound means two
[2:30:48] elements to make up a hole
[2:30:50] two elements to make up a hole amen amen
[2:30:53] so Moses spoke of Jesus and when they
[2:30:56] come together you saw the whole picture
[2:30:58] Abraham had the faith of God and when
[2:31:01] Jesus come on the earth and they come
[2:31:02] together you saw the Fulfillment when
[2:31:05] you saw Jesus you saw the Fulfillment of
[2:31:08] the compound scripture in plain view and
[2:31:11] I gotta go and say it and when you see
[2:31:13] this bride
[2:31:16] Hallelujah when you see this bride you
[2:31:20] will see the Old Testament the New

[2:37:59] reading about but in the end time by the
[2:38:02] voice of Revelation 10 and Malachi 4 we

[2:40:55] the way an unfamiliar Contour area in
[2:40:58] order to learn about or familiarize
[2:41:00] oneself with it it means to search for
[2:41:02] resources to inquire and to or discuss a
[2:41:05] subject or issue in detail it means to
[2:41:08] examine or evaluate an option or
[2:41:10] possibility
[2:41:11] so I got to thinking about this you ever
[2:41:13] go into a theater where they have a
[2:41:15] concert or singers or music or something
[2:41:17] like that you're going to theater
[2:41:19] you walk in there brother Wayne
[2:41:21] and it's real clock the stage is there
[2:41:24] the performers are getting ready the
[2:41:26] singers whatever the drama you're
[2:41:28] getting right watch it's real it's real
[2:41:29] quiet and then it gets real dark all of
[2:41:31] a sudden
[2:41:33] and then all of a sudden brother Josiah
[2:41:35] you hear a voice and the voice says
[2:41:37] Welcome to our theater
[2:41:40] Welcome to our Welcome to our Auditorium
[2:41:43] in the unlikely event of an emergency
[2:41:47] please notarize and familiarize yourself
[2:41:49] with the clearly marked exits
[2:41:54] [Applause]
[2:41:56] so while it's real dark brother Steve
[2:41:59] all of a sudden a lot will come on
[2:42:04] above the door
[2:42:06] and it will draw your eyes to it and
[2:42:09] you'll look at it and say in the
[2:42:11] unlikely event of an emergency that's
[2:42:13] the door I need to go out
[2:42:15] [Applause]
[2:42:16] you know what in that theater or concert
[2:42:19] hall there's exits plural Tommy there's
[2:42:22] X it's plural but you know what Amen in
[2:42:25] this message we heard a voice
[2:42:27] and it got real dark and the voice said
[2:42:31] there is a man here theme there is a man
[2:42:35] here who can turn on the light there is
[2:42:38] a man here who can flip the switch there
[2:42:41] is a man here that can show you the way
[2:42:44] out listen in this bride Church there is
[2:42:47] not X it's plural
[2:42:50] in that Auditorium brother Jeremy
[2:42:52] there's X's plural but in this body out
[2:42:55] of laodicea there is only one exit it's
[2:42:58] not plural it's singular can I tell you
[2:43:00] what it is it is the message of the hour
[2:43:05] foreign
[2:43:08] and you look at the exits and you say in
[2:43:10] the unlikely event but in this day the
[2:43:13] prophet did not say in the unlikely
[2:43:15] event he took his text on the Rapture
[2:43:18] from the most Troublesome time you could
[2:43:20] talk about and said but in the time of
[2:43:22] trouble he shall hide me in his exit he
[2:43:26] shall hide me in his Pavilion I'm on
[2:43:29] church I know they're talking about
[2:43:31] world war three but I'm not biting my
[2:43:33] fingernails I know they're talking about
[2:43:35] the economy collapsing but I'm not
[2:43:37] worried you know why because I'm in the
[2:43:39] provisions of the exit from where
[2:43:42] government controls things from where
[2:43:44] the stock markets controls the mood of
[2:43:46] the people I'm going to Glory
[2:43:50] I'm in the exit and I'm Homeward Bound
[2:43:53] I'm closing with this listen church
[2:43:56] program comes the end of his ministry
[2:43:57] and preaches you a message called this
[2:43:59] things that are to be
[2:44:03] I know that devil right now is pushing
[2:44:04] me but I'll push back devil
[2:44:06] this message is the only way in a
[2:44:08] rapture
[2:44:09] I said it I meant it I represent it and
[2:44:12] I stand behind it this message is the
[2:44:16] only way into a rapture
[2:44:18] without this message brother window
[2:44:20] there is no Rapture without this message
[2:44:22] you will never see Revelation 21 in
[2:44:25] reality but with this message
[2:44:29] [Applause]
[2:44:33] can I have a few more minutes in your
[2:44:35] pulling
[2:44:36] things that are to be he reads John 14
[2:44:39] and then turns and says now last night
[2:44:42] over there in Yuma
[2:44:46] I spoke on the rapture
[2:44:49] and there's going to be a Rapture and he
[2:44:51] said maybe here I'll ask how many

[3:20:09] and we they have given their energy and
[3:20:14] they they've wanted to do it
[3:20:18] their way to hell
[3:20:20] and uh I know it's it's tiresome uh to
[3:20:24] them that I appreciate that they have
[3:20:27] the the willingness to to carry on the
[3:20:31] vision
[3:20:32] and also I want to thank those who have
[3:20:35] helped outside the brothers of the
[3:20:38] parking and the ushering
[3:20:48] they were doing it out in the rain
[3:20:52] and they they got to hear bits and
[3:20:55] pieces of the service but uh they were
[3:20:59] out there not only doing the parking but
[3:21:01] making sure that no one
[3:21:03] Brakes in your car
[3:21:05] and takes the money or whatever you got
[3:21:09] in there and so I I really appreciate
[3:21:12] them doing that and I I want to say and
[3:21:16] I know my church feels the same way as
[3:21:20] thank you to all of you who have
[3:21:22] volunteered to help whether it be in the
[3:21:25] kitchen whether it be here in the
[3:21:27] meeting
[3:21:28] we're just a small group
[3:21:31] and there's no way absolutely no way you
[3:21:36] can turn this down it's ringing but
[3:21:39] there's no way that
[3:21:41] we could have done this
[3:21:43] without Brothers new brothers and
[3:21:46] sisters volunteering to hell and and I I
[3:21:51] so thank you so much I wish I could
[3:21:54] repay you a thousand fold
[3:21:58] um
[3:22:02] [Applause]
[3:22:07] and um and so I those that have
[3:22:12] contributed uh in money I know
[3:22:17] this tent that you see I I last year
[3:22:22] there were those of you sitting in the
[3:22:25] rain
[3:22:26] with umbrellas and we were cold because
[3:22:30] of the we couldn't raise lower the flaps
[3:22:33] because of other people sitting outside
[3:22:35] and and so it was a little catastrophe
[3:22:38] but
[3:22:39] I I purposed that I was going to get a
[3:22:42] 10 and I told you last year I'll have a
[3:22:45] tent next year not knowing how I was
[3:22:48] going to do this but I was going to do
[3:22:50] it by God's grace
[3:22:52] and
[3:22:54] several Brothers came to me afterwards
[3:22:57] and you get that 10 I want to help
[3:23:00] and by God's grace this sin is paid for
[3:23:05] and I thank God
[3:23:08] for it
[3:23:16] praise the Lord
[3:23:20] and
[3:23:21] there there have been brother Mark
[3:23:24] Spencer they have their church not too
[3:23:27] far from here 15 minutes 15 there in
[3:23:30] Charlottesville and but they have
[3:23:34] contributed uh money they they wanted in
[3:23:39] any way to help their Church help us and
[3:23:42] they've been he dismissed this church
[3:23:44] today service today to be here and so
[3:23:47] Mark I really thank you for that
[3:23:50] it has been so much
[3:23:53] and um
[3:23:55] [Applause]
[3:24:02] most of our the the the Brethren uh well
[3:24:06] I guess all that have administered uh
[3:24:10] here uh this week I'm supposed to be
[3:24:12] giving them the offering and they have
[3:24:15] contributed money uh either with with
[3:24:20] paying for lunches or paying whatever
[3:24:24] they they have just been uh very so
[3:24:28] they're not just preaching to you but
[3:24:30] they they have supported it in in other
[3:24:33] ways and I just say God bless each and
[3:24:36] every one of you so much
[3:24:40] um
[3:24:44] for this
[3:24:46] and
[3:24:48] so I I I'm probably missing some but if
[3:24:53] if any of you have contributed brother
[3:24:55] Manuel even though he wasn't able to be
[3:24:58] Eerie you sent money with his dad to
[3:25:01] give to us and
[3:25:03] I know I'm missing a lot here but uh
[3:25:06] just other names
[3:25:08] um that that have contributed
[3:25:12] individuals and I again I want to say
[3:25:15] thank you so much and if I don't get to
[3:25:18] shake your hand or tell you personally I
[3:25:21] want to tell you now thank you and God
[3:25:24] bless you
[3:25:26] dearly

[3:25:34] by God's grace if we don't uh if the
[3:25:37] Lord if we're still here we'll continue
[3:25:39] this next year and so we invite you
[3:25:42] already
[3:25:44] invited to come back and uh my wife did
[3:25:48] tell me to mention this to you that if
[3:25:50] you do think you're coming
[3:25:52] you've got a ring in this but if you
[3:25:54] think you're coming uh
[3:25:58] uh it's best to reserve rooms now
[3:26:04] you can always cancel
[3:26:06] if if somehow you can't because I know
[3:26:08] there are some that have tried to get it
[3:26:12] later and all the hotels were booked uh
[3:26:16] them apart and wasn't able to to come or
[3:26:20] whatever so if you do want to come back
[3:26:23] the best thing you could do is is
[3:26:25] reserve a room and if you're not able to
[3:26:29] by some unseen incident you can always
[3:26:33] count cancel not counseling but cancel
[3:26:36] amen
[3:26:38] so uh also uh God bless you young people
[3:26:42] and I love just to see everyone dancing
[3:26:45] up here uh rejoicing
[3:26:48] amen
[3:26:51] praise the Lord
[3:26:53] we got something to Rejoice about
[3:26:56] what a message have we heard today
[3:26:59] exalting the message that God has sent
[3:27:02] to us and I appreciate every Minister
[3:27:05] that has preached preached this week I
[3:27:08] love them dearly and I know you do too
[3:27:11] and you've been blessed and uh uh one
[3:27:14] other thing uh two other things but uh
[3:27:18] for you young people we do have the gym
[3:27:22] that you all went to Friday
[3:27:26] um we've got that same gem uh reserved
[3:27:30] at four o'clock and uh and so if you
[3:27:34] want to go and have a good time uh we
[3:27:38] would love for you to come and and I do
[3:27:41] ask this apparently there's an upstairs
[3:27:44] uh there and they got video games up
[3:27:48] there please do not go upstairs and play
[3:27:52] their games
[3:27:53] they called us and asked us not to do
[3:27:57] that and so we would just depreciate
[3:28:00] that you uh just don't go up there
[3:28:04] that's their their place and so anyway
[3:28:08] but if you'd like to go and if you need
[3:28:11] directions
[3:28:12] uh Daniel
[3:28:15] guy in the back there
[3:28:17] want to shoot me
[3:28:20] that's my son he can give you directions
[3:28:23] or show you what to do there but he'll
[3:28:27] be around and so and then
[3:28:31] um
[3:28:33] anywhere but he's going to be there as
[3:28:35] well I'm not missing rosham I see you in
[3:28:37] here
[3:28:39] he's like me short
[3:28:42] oh he's in the kitchen okay he's got a
[3:28:44] good excuse so uh anyways
[3:28:48] so we want to do that if you want to
[3:28:51] come also a sister from Arkansas
[3:28:54] uh sister Patty uh Ogden I guess had had
[3:29:00] written a book on shangard and the ox
[3:29:02] gold and it's it's told in the story
[3:29:04] that brother Branham tells it and so
[3:29:07] she's donated
[3:29:10] I think there's 96 books that we have to
[3:29:14] to the children and so if you want if
[3:29:18] you want a book for your grandchildren
[3:29:21] your children uh whatever
[3:29:25] they're they're in the back and you can
[3:29:27] just go straight back there and they can
[3:29:30] uh give them and give you one or
[3:29:33] whatever there but I've read it and it's
[3:29:36] just a tremendous tremendous little book
[3:29:39] and and so your your children won't be
[3:29:42] told a fairy tale that'll be told the
[3:29:44] truth and uh so about what happened in
[3:29:48] the Bible and uh so if you want one it's
[3:29:51] professionally done I say God bless her
[3:29:54] for that and and uh I don't know how
[3:29:56] much she had to pay that it's a really
[3:29:59] quality book
[3:30:01] a man and so
[3:30:04] anyways we've got food prepared got uh
[3:30:08] smoked chicken I think that's how
[3:30:10] brother will done it and got pork up
[3:30:13] there and got all kinds of stuff and so
[3:30:16] we want you to stay and eat because
[3:30:19] there's going to be enough food for
[3:30:21] everyone and I don't want to eat it all
[3:30:22] so you've got to take some food with you
[3:30:25] or if you got to go or stay in
[3:30:27] fellowship and uh also I was going to
[3:30:30] ask uh if you young brothers would want
[3:30:34] to take some time and help us stack
[3:30:36] these chairs
[3:30:38] um we uh we got a lot of them and uh we
[3:30:42] just if we can at least have your help
[3:30:44] on that uh man uh we'll ask your mom
[3:30:49] give you a big hits or something
[3:30:51] but um so in any ways uh it it would
[3:30:55] just be a tremendous blessing amen so
[3:30:58] God bless you may we just bow our hearts
[3:31:01] in prayer brother Nick would you want to
[3:31:03] come and and dismiss us and pray over
[3:31:06] the food we appreciate brother Nick and
[3:31:09] it goes to brother Wayne's church and

[3:31:42] we're in the third pool we are the third
[3:31:44] pool we thank you Lord
[3:31:45] for the tremendous visitation
