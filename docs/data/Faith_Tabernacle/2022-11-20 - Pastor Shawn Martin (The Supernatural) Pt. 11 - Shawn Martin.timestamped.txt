[43:07] out of his father that you can have
[43:10] complete control
[43:12] and I pray father that you would just
[43:14] touch those that are sick this morning
[43:17] Lord that they would love to be here to
[43:20] worship you but just aren't feeling well
[43:24] and but Lord we know you as the great
[43:27] physician
[43:28] and whatever it would be that would uh
[43:31] that they're going through Lord I pray
[43:33] that you would touch them in a great way
[43:36] those that are out of town and would be
[43:39] coming back today I pray that you would
[43:42] just keep them on the highway keep them
[43:44] safe Lord is our prayer and father most
[43:49] of all bless the reading of your word
[43:51] Lord the ministering I pray that you had
[43:54] anoint not only me but the people father
[43:57] Lord may we be lifted up in Heavenly
[44:00] places in Christ we ask these things in
[44:04] your lovely name Jesus Christ and the
[44:07] church says a man and a man
[44:12] um we we want to look at Ephesians 1
[44:16] and the 21st verse we'll start there it
[44:21] says far above
[44:24] um
[44:24] Let's uh let's go down to the 20th he
[44:28] says which he wrought in Christ when he
[44:31] raised him from the dead and said to him
[44:33] at his own right hand in the Heavenly
[44:37] places
[44:38] speaking of Christ and far above he
[44:43] raised him far above uh all principality
[44:47] and power and might and Dominion in
[44:50] every name that is named not only in the
[44:54] this world but also in that which is to
[44:58] come
[44:59] and has put all things under his feet
[45:02] and gave him to be the head over all
[45:05] things to the church
[45:07] which is his body who's his body
[45:11] the church the fullness of him that
[45:15] filleth all in all amen you can have
[45:19] your seats this morning
[45:21] and we trust that something can be said
[45:26] to edify you
[45:28] in Christ and I'm continuing with the
[45:32] title the Supernatural and I'm sure
[45:35] there are are better titles
[45:38] um that that I could use for this
[45:40] subject
[45:42] but if the the church is the body of
[45:45] Christ then then the Supernatural is the
[45:48] main part of the church a man for we are
[45:51] a supernatural body the supernatural
[45:54] life flowing through us uh Supernatural
[45:57] Faith Supernatural love everything about
[46:00] God everything about the church is
[46:03] Supernatural and so we we find that uh
[46:07] wherever God is the supernatural takes
[46:10] place and so if the church is the body
[46:13] of of Christ then then that's where he
[46:17] resides and so uh she is a supernatural
[46:23] uh uh uh uh brighter self a supernatural
[46:28] church for uh we know that she is flesh
[46:32] of his flesh bone of his bone life of
[46:35] his life power of his power she is him
[46:39] in so much she is him in so much that
[46:43] she's been given the name Miss Jesus
[46:46] Christ and so today I'm not just talking
[46:50] to church members or just a a a uh just
[46:55] average people or just humans if you
[46:59] could say it that way we're looking in a
[47:01] higher uh order and that is I'm I
[47:04] believe I'm speaking to miss Jesus
[47:06] Christ
[47:06] amen and people that bear his name and
[47:11] uh you have been given your pardon you
[47:15] have been declared Justified and and so
[47:20] uh brother Branham would tell us you are
[47:23] standing completely you never sinned at
[47:26] the first place God don't even know it's
[47:30] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[47:32] did it you were accused of it not by God
[47:36] though you were not accused of it by God
[47:39] you were accused of it by your accuser
[47:41] and we know Satan is the accuser of the
[47:44] Brethren and so he says but really from
[47:47] the beginning you were predestinated to
[47:50] be a son and daughter of God you're
[47:52] standing there washed and your old book
[47:56] of divorcement is put away and it's dead
[48:01] absolutely out of existence even in the
[48:06] mind of God so you're The Virtuous bride
[48:10] of Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[48:13] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[48:17] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[48:21] word that he Washed by the Water of his
[48:24] own blood that become Flesh and Blood
[48:27] flesh and manifested that he might take
[48:30] you which were predestinated in the
[48:33] bosom of the father before the beginning
[48:35] the same as he was can you say man so no
[48:40] wonder you could be uh Miss Jesus Christ
[48:43] for when you received the Holy Ghost uh
[48:47] brother Brown said your sex your your
[48:49] sexual blood was dismissed ain't that
[48:52] right in another place he says if you
[48:55] ever really come to God and got a taste
[48:58] of the Heavenly gifts of God partakers
[49:01] of his divine nature why you could know
[49:05] more become a sinner again
[49:08] aren't you glad for that you could no
[49:12] more be a sinner again an unbeliever
[49:15] than a stalk of corn could become a
[49:19] cocklebur ain't that right now the Bible
[49:22] uh speaks of Oneness a man and and this
[49:26] word Oneness I looked it up and it it's
[49:29] singleness a Unity same identity uh
[49:35] Union blending melting together amen now
[49:39] you know so many are trying to be one uh
[49:43] today with just anybody everybody we you
[49:47] know and it's it's becoming a generation
[49:49] an age of melting together and we all
[49:52] know that everything's uh it's a uniting
[49:56] time as the prophet would would preach
[49:58] and and so but the the Oneness that
[50:02] Jesus would pray for now the Oneness
[50:05] that Jesus prayed for was was that the
[50:08] one this like he and the father had amen
[50:12] that that type of Oneness and and
[50:15] remember uh there as in his prayer John
[50:18] 17 and 19 uh just break it in he said
[50:21] for their sake I sanctify myself that
[50:25] they also might be Sanctified through
[50:28] the truth neither I I pray I for these
[50:33] alone so he wasn't just praying for them
[50:35] chosen uh uh his disciples there but he
[50:40] was also he said but for them us also uh
[50:45] which Shall Believe on me through their
[50:48] word ain't that right he says that they
[50:51] all may be one as thou father and I uh
[50:57] or as thou father are in me and I in
[51:00] thee so look at that Oneness the father
[51:03] in him and him in the father that they
[51:08] also May maybe one in us that the world
[51:12] may believe that thou has sent me ain't
[51:15] that right and the glory which thou
[51:18] gavest me I gave them that they may be
[51:22] one even as we are one oh my see so how
[51:28] do we have this Oneness brother Branham
[51:31] asked that question you know how does
[51:33] this Oneness work amen and and he says
[51:36] this he said the word in us would be the
[51:40] anointed word ain't that right amen
[51:43] talking of of of of this body of of
[51:46] being the fullness of Jesus Christ see
[51:49] it's not just Faith Tabernacle a man
[51:52] that that makes it the body amen but
[51:55] it's a bride that makes the body it's
[51:59] the Church of the Living God that that
[52:01] and and this is the church is is that
[52:05] church that has that Oneness with the
[52:08] father and Christ can you say man that
[52:12] are in the same Oneness as Christ had
[52:15] with the father and this is how that
[52:17] Oneness works the word in us would be
[52:20] the anointed word that is the Oneness of
[52:24] God see the Oneness of God is the word
[52:29] anointed in you ain't that right amen
[52:33] see so so it's not just hearing the word
[52:35] behind the pulpit and said amen and
[52:38] filling a man a great having a great
[52:40] time in the church but when you leave
[52:43] these doors that word is in you amen
[52:46] when you go to school that word is in
[52:48] you when you go to when you go to work
[52:50] that word is in you when you go home the
[52:53] word is in you and that word is Anointed
[52:57] in you can you say Amen see that's the
[53:00] Oneness and then he says see the Oneness
[53:03] of God is the word anointed in you amen
[53:07] it's it's it's it's not just you reading
[53:10] the Bible and you apart from that but
[53:13] this word is now in you that's anointed
[53:17] as it was in God in Christ he says and
[53:20] then you become a son a messiah of the
[53:23] age ain't that right amen says so now
[53:25] only the predestinated will have this
[53:28] kind of Oneness that's right see for
[53:31] they uh uh are the ones who make up the
[53:34] body of Christ amen that's right and
[53:37] only those in the body of Christ are
[53:41] unified together in the Oneness that
[53:45] Jesus prayed for now we're not United
[53:47] with the World We Stand Alone can you
[53:50] say man we're we're not re you United a
[53:54] man with man's Creeds and dogmas we
[53:57] stand alone we're not United with the
[54:00] politics of this age We Stand Alone
[54:03] ain't that right we're not United with
[54:06] this world or the the church or
[54:08] organization see we're St We Stand Alone
[54:12] see we're not United with the
[54:14] make-believer or the Sinners amen We
[54:17] Stand Alone a man say it's it's not a
[54:20] Melting Pot a man where we just blend in
[54:23] with everything amen the Oneness is with
[54:26] the Father and Jesus Christ can you say
[54:29] amen that's that's where it is
[54:31] everything else we stand alone it's just
[54:34] like a Daniel a man in in Babylon there
[54:37] in in when he was in captivity a man he
[54:41] was only United with three other men
[54:43] Shadrach Meshach and Bendigo ain't that
[54:46] right amen there was other Jews there
[54:48] millions of Jews a man in the same
[54:51] captivity in the same country in Babylon
[54:55] but Daniel was only United with three
[54:58] other people and and the prophet would
[55:01] tell us that they were Overcomers they
[55:04] were the only Overcomers in that age
[55:07] amen and see a man out of the millions
[55:10] of people a man that we're living on the
[55:13] earth in Noah's day he was United a man
[55:17] with only seven of them amen and the
[55:20] prophet said they were the Overcomers of
[55:22] that day for they were found in the ark
[55:26] if safety ain't that right a man see and
[55:29] out of the two and a half million people
[55:31] Amen in the time of Moses amen yet there
[55:36] was only two a man that Moses was United
[55:39] with and that was Joshua and Caleb amen
[55:43] see they were the Overcomers for that
[55:46] age ain't that right see so there is a
[55:49] Oneness a man for they believe the
[55:51] message of the hour amen now notice
[55:54] Matthew 7 and 13 uh uh Jesus said enter
[55:59] ye in at the Straight Gate for white is
[56:02] the gate broad is the way that leadth to
[56:05] destruction and many everybody say many
[56:09] many there be which go in their hat
[56:12] because straight is the gate and narrow
[56:15] is the way which lead us unto life and
[56:19] few there be that find it so see this
[56:23] body of Believers now that few is the
[56:26] one that makes up the Church of the
[56:28] Living God and that few are united
[56:31] together they're not United with the
[56:34] many amen that that goes the broad way
[56:37] but they're United with that few a man
[56:41] that that Lit that uh goes the narrow
[56:44] way which leads unto life ain't that
[56:47] right that few uh they are the ones that
[56:50] are predestinated but I'm going to tell
[56:52] you something that few are the ones that
[56:55] has the supernatural working with the in
[56:57] them amen that few is the one that's
[57:00] walking with God that's connected with
[57:03] God Amen see so the Oneness that Jesus
[57:07] prayed for is fulfilled in this day do
[57:10] you believe that for he said father make
[57:13] them one even as you and I are one see
[57:17] thou father and me and I in you but
[57:20] notice now there is a day that that
[57:23] would be added there would be an element
[57:25] that would be added and it would be this
[57:28] day John 14 20. Jesus said at that day
[57:33] now the prophet said this day you shall
[57:36] know that I am in the father you and me
[57:39] and I in you can you say Amen so that
[57:43] makes up the Oneness it's not only amen
[57:46] the father in me and me and the father
[57:48] amen Jesus speaking but now we can say
[57:52] in this age amen that we are in the
[57:55] Father the father in us we are in Christ
[57:57] Christ in us can you say Amen it's a
[58:01] Oneness ain't that right so we find that
[58:04] the Church of the Living God is the veil
[58:07] of God God as we've been talking a man
[58:10] is the veil Jesus was the veil of God
[58:14] Amen uh uh they they they they they they
[58:17] they wanted to see God the Greek men
[58:19] wanted to see God Amen but when they saw
[58:22] they just saw a man they saw a veil a
[58:26] man of a man ain't that right well the
[58:29] church is the veil of God today it's
[58:32] it's not hypothetical speaking amen but
[58:35] it's a literal thing you are the veil of
[58:40] God for this age
[58:42] amen I'm glad for that can you say man
[58:45] amen the supernatural so you're not
[58:47] you're not as a helpless human being
[58:50] amen you can't overcome you can Prevail
[58:53] you you can make it can you say man I
[58:57] don't care how hot the trial gets I
[58:59] don't care how bad the night and the
[59:01] dark the night is you can make it
[59:03] because the god that is in you is
[59:06] greater amen than the world he's greater
[59:09] than the trial he's greater than your
[59:10] problem he's greater if you just quit
[59:12] looking at your problem and look unto
[59:14] him can you say amen and you'll find a
[59:18] man that is in you for you're the body
[59:22] so the Church of the Living God is the
[59:25] Tabernacle of God on Earth today
[59:28] so
[59:29] don't please don't imagine
[59:33] uh uh yourself looking at an object
[59:36] called The Church of the Living God
[59:39] and you're sitting there looking at it
[59:41] wondering
[59:46] put yourself there you are the church
[59:51] if I say I am the church
[59:54] see if you're baptized
[59:57] into the body by one Spirit right we're
[1:00:00] all baptized into one body
[1:00:02] not separate
[1:00:04] one spirit
[1:00:06] puts us in one body
[1:00:09] ain't that right
[1:00:10] so there there there you find even the
[1:00:14] Apostle Paul makes it personal To Us by
[1:00:17] saying it is Christ in you
[1:00:21] the hope of glory
[1:00:23] ain't that right not Christ somewheres
[1:00:26] and we're trying to find it look in the
[1:00:29] mirror and find Christ in you
[1:00:32] it's Christ in you can you say man look
[1:00:36] at ourself
[1:00:37] it's Christ amen that's right see amen
[1:00:41] if we can get past that human element
[1:00:43] quit looking at that human element quit
[1:00:46] looking at our limitations and look to
[1:00:49] the Christ that's in US
[1:00:53] that's right now notice it's a mystery
[1:00:56] Paul says it's a mystery this mystery is
[1:00:58] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:01:01] and and and and this mystery God is kept
[1:01:04] to himself all these all this time
[1:01:08] it's been hidden
[1:01:10] ain't that right
[1:01:12] but he has made it known in this age
[1:01:16] which would fulfill what Jesus said at
[1:01:18] that day you shall know that I'm in the
[1:01:21] father I in you and you and me ain't
[1:01:23] that right you shall know why because
[1:01:25] he's made it known
[1:01:28] amen now the prophet would tell us in
[1:01:31] him in God with thoughts he wanted to
[1:01:35] become material
[1:01:37] and what did he do then he spoke a word
[1:01:40] and the Word was materialized
[1:01:43] God wanted to become material
[1:01:47] he said that's the whole picture from
[1:01:49] Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong
[1:01:52] it's Elohim God
[1:01:56] materializing so that he can be touched
[1:02:00] ain't that right feel he said then in
[1:02:03] the Millennium there's Elohim sitting on
[1:02:05] the throne that's right with all of his
[1:02:07] subjects around him that he
[1:02:09] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:02:11] the world so the whole thing is God
[1:02:15] becoming flesh
[1:02:18] now you know
[1:02:21] someone that asked brother Brown and
[1:02:22] said well how how can God become flesh
[1:02:25] how can he be made flesh and brother
[1:02:26] Brown's reply was the same as he was in
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ he was made flesh
[1:02:32] when he was in Melchizedek he was made
[1:02:34] flesh and now he is here among us today
[1:02:39] May flesh in his church certainly see
[1:02:43] it's Elohim see so God becoming flesh
[1:02:47] ain't that right in this day now you
[1:02:50] think of that in this day we can look
[1:02:53] back and and and get the idea of what
[1:02:57] God was in Jesus Christ when he was made
[1:02:59] flesh in that body
[1:03:01] and the same Works Jesus said that he
[1:03:05] did we would do in this age
[1:03:08] even greater
[1:03:11] God same God made flesh
[1:03:14] in humanity
[1:03:17] I think that's powerful
[1:03:20] now we know that there are three offices
[1:03:23] of God
[1:03:25] that is Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] it's not three separate persons in one
[1:03:30] God
[1:03:31] as they they want to tell us but it's
[1:03:34] three offices
[1:03:35] of the one true God
[1:03:38] and God did not operate in all these
[1:03:42] offices at the same time
[1:03:44] ain't that right
[1:03:46] but brother random would teach us that
[1:03:48] that there was a space of time that God
[1:03:51] worked in each office
[1:03:54] so so as there was a space of time that
[1:03:58] God worked as uh in the office as father
[1:04:02] amen and that's how he was manifested
[1:04:05] and brother Bradham would call that
[1:04:07] space of time the disposition of
[1:04:11] fatherhood
[1:04:12] ain't that right then when that
[1:04:15] dispensation or that space of time ended
[1:04:18] then it would start another space of
[1:04:21] time a period of time which would be
[1:04:24] called the dispensation of the son that
[1:04:28] God would work in the office as son can
[1:04:32] you say amen that's right and that's how
[1:04:34] he was manifested then came the
[1:04:37] dispensation of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:04:40] the third office that God works in see
[1:04:44] it's the threefold being of God ain't
[1:04:47] that right brother Brown said this is
[1:04:49] why we were commissioned to baptized in
[1:04:53] the name of the Father the Son and the
[1:04:56] Holy Ghost because it's the same God in
[1:05:00] fatherhood sonship and holy ghost or
[1:05:04] Holy Spirit dispensation ain't that
[1:05:07] right
[1:05:09] yes sir and the name of the father is
[1:05:12] Jesus Christ
[1:05:14] ain't that right so three dispensations
[1:05:17] three unfoldings three workings of the
[1:05:21] same God Amen God the father was the
[1:05:25] word God the son was the word God the
[1:05:28] Holy Ghost is the word can you say amen
[1:05:31] amen you can never separate the word
[1:05:33] from God ain't that right so every
[1:05:36] office each three offices that God
[1:05:39] worked in it was the word the word the
[1:05:41] word in different offices can you say
[1:05:44] man so we find that in the Old Testament
[1:05:47] we see where God represented himself
[1:05:51] once in fullness everybody say in
[1:05:55] fullness
[1:05:56] he represented himself uh there in the
[1:06:00] Old Testament once in fullness in the
[1:06:04] order of Melchizedek as father ain't
[1:06:07] that right we know that Melchizedek was
[1:06:10] not a priesthood ain't that right but he
[1:06:13] was a man a person flesh amen God
[1:06:17] revealed himself the prophet said in
[1:06:21] fullness as a man
[1:06:24] oh my see so we know it was God that
[1:06:28] appeared to him Amen to Abraham amen for
[1:06:32] the Bible called him king of
[1:06:34] righteousness king of Salem which means
[1:06:38] peace ain't that right so king of Peace
[1:06:40] amen Paul said he had no father he had
[1:06:43] no mother ain't that right he he wasn't
[1:06:46] a descendant of some family tree amen it
[1:06:51] was God Elohim the self-existent one
[1:06:55] amen he had no beginning of days nor
[1:06:57] ending of life amen see so he is the
[1:07:01] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:07:04] and he was called Melchizedek the father
[1:07:10] amen so brother Branham said see he
[1:07:14] wasn't the Son of God he was the god of
[1:07:17] the son he wasn't the Son of God
[1:07:20] Melchizedek wasn't but he was the father
[1:07:23] of the Son of God see Jesus had a father
[1:07:27] and mother Jesus had a time when he
[1:07:31] started and yet this man Melchizedek
[1:07:34] didn't ain't that right no beginning of
[1:07:36] days or ending of Life see Jesus gave
[1:07:39] his life but this man couldn't give his
[1:07:42] life for he was life
[1:07:46] Jesus had to be born in flesh to take
[1:07:49] away the the Stinger of death
[1:07:55] but we find the body of Melchizedek was
[1:07:58] a created body
[1:08:00] a word body can you say man amen God was
[1:08:04] manifested in human flesh now you just
[1:08:08] think of that because again God wants to
[1:08:10] become material
[1:08:12] that was his thoughts can you say Amen
[1:08:14] yes sir he said see now that was a body
[1:08:18] that he just pulled the calcium and
[1:08:21] potash out of the earth and and blue you
[1:08:24] know and stepped into it that was the
[1:08:27] same thing Melchizedek was he stepped
[1:08:31] into him in a body that he could walk
[1:08:34] out before him or Abraham under the veil
[1:08:38] of his own creation not a veil of the
[1:08:42] creation of woman through the womb of a
[1:08:44] woman through a cell never but this but
[1:08:47] he created this and stepped out into it
[1:08:50] and talked in order uh in the order of
[1:08:53] Melchizedek ain't that right now notice
[1:08:57] when he come into that fullness a man
[1:08:59] and represented himself in fullness as
[1:09:02] Melchizedek he appeared to Abraham as
[1:09:06] son of man
[1:09:08] ain't that right that's well that's what
[1:09:10] the prophet said he said he God appeared
[1:09:13] to Abraham in the form of a son of man
[1:09:16] Elohim Jehovah and he performed a sign
[1:09:21] to Abraham and Abraham was the elect
[1:09:25] ain't that right Abraham was the chosen
[1:09:28] the elect the predestinated of God and
[1:09:31] there was God in human flesh performing
[1:09:35] a sign unto Abraham
[1:09:39] now think of that he said see the
[1:09:42] prophet said God made flesh among them
[1:09:43] stood with his back turned to the tent
[1:09:47] young people when you hear Brother
[1:09:48] Branham sipping you know turning his
[1:09:51] back to to the audience and begin to
[1:09:53] discern amen think of that the very
[1:09:57] thing that God did Back to Abraham
[1:10:00] same God
[1:10:02] my so God made flesh among them stood
[1:10:06] with his back turned to the tent and
[1:10:09] told Sarah what she was thinking about
[1:10:10] told Abraham what Sarah was thinking
[1:10:13] about and doing in the tent ain't that
[1:10:16] right he says now notice this is
[1:10:18] important the last sign they got was the
[1:10:22] manifestation of God in flesh
[1:10:27] could read the heart of a woman behind
[1:10:30] him in the tent this last sign amen that
[1:10:34] Abraham and Sarah got before the son
[1:10:36] came amen was God in flesh standing
[1:10:41] right before them performing that
[1:10:43] Messiah sign
[1:10:44] ain't that right and brother Brown said
[1:10:47] that sign was fully manifested to
[1:10:50] Abraham what was it it was God as father
[1:10:56] working in the office
[1:10:58] amen now he says see so we we find a man
[1:11:02] that that same sign a man would be
[1:11:05] performed a man in the sonship
[1:11:08] dispensation ain't that right and Not
[1:11:12] only would it be performed in the
[1:11:14] sonship disposition but it would be
[1:11:16] fulfilled in the Holy Ghost dispensation
[1:11:19] as well God wouldn't be manifested in
[1:11:23] his fullness then we see that God was
[1:11:27] manifested Amen in the fullness of his
[1:11:30] son
[1:11:31] ain't that right and all that God was
[1:11:34] Jesus Christ was everything that God was
[1:11:37] was dumped or poured into that human
[1:11:40] body
[1:11:42] amen the prophet said see God lived the
[1:11:46] God the Father lived in the sun which
[1:11:49] made him God the son can you say amen
[1:11:53] that's right see but it wasn't a created
[1:11:56] body amen as the body of Melchizedek
[1:11:59] amen this was a a born body can you say
[1:12:03] man a word born body that was created in
[1:12:07] the womb of Mary
[1:12:11] but notice Paul said it was God in
[1:12:13] Christ
[1:12:14] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:12:17] ain't that right God in the dispensation
[1:12:20] as son
[1:12:22] amen see Jesus constantly called himself
[1:12:25] what son of man
[1:12:27] constantly calling himself son of man
[1:12:29] amen and he was the express image that's
[1:12:33] what Paul would tell us he was the
[1:12:35] express image of God
[1:12:39] ain't that right it's the seed of God
[1:12:42] manifested the prophet said trying to
[1:12:44] draw the people to him amen Jesus also
[1:12:49] said he that has seen me has seen the
[1:12:51] father ain't that right they asked him
[1:12:54] they they asked you show me the father
[1:12:55] and he said have I been so long with you
[1:12:58] and you still don't know me he that has
[1:13:00] seen me has seen the father
[1:13:04] that's right Paul also would tell us
[1:13:06] that him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:13:09] godhead bodily
[1:13:11] ain't that right so again it was the
[1:13:15] fullness of God in his son
[1:13:18] same God that was in the body of
[1:13:21] Melchizedek was now in his son
[1:13:29] Jesus Christ was on man
[1:13:32] and he was all God
[1:13:34] ain't that right
[1:13:36] brother Branham says of all the human
[1:13:39] emotions
[1:13:42] that Jesus manifested the most when he
[1:13:45] appeared as the son of man was this one
[1:13:48] he wept often
[1:13:51] Jesus cried a lot
[1:13:53] as son of man in that human body
[1:13:56] he cried a lot
[1:13:58] yet behind that weeping and that sorrow
[1:14:01] there was still God
[1:14:04] oh God
[1:14:06] that's amazing oh God
[1:14:08] wanted to become material
[1:14:11] God wanted to know what it was to cry
[1:14:15] come on church now he want to know what
[1:14:17] you go through
[1:14:19] and one of the the the things that the
[1:14:22] most emotions that he did he wept a lot
[1:14:25] God weeping in human skin God's
[1:14:29] suffering in human skin God feeling the
[1:14:32] pain in human skin ain't that right God
[1:14:35] being tempted in human skin the prophet
[1:14:38] said he even had sexual Temptations in
[1:14:41] human skin
[1:14:45] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:14:48] God was manifested in the flesh
[1:14:51] ain't that right and the same sign that
[1:14:55] God performed as father in the body of
[1:14:59] Melchizedek was performed in the body of
[1:15:03] the Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:15:08] so we see God the Father
[1:15:10] and now God the son
[1:15:13] oh my God old is all right
[1:15:16] he was the son Prophet said he was the
[1:15:19] son
[1:15:19] when he used the sonship office
[1:15:22] see the same God working in two
[1:15:26] different offices
[1:15:27] yet performing the same sign
[1:15:31] showing that it was him
[1:15:34] ain't that right
[1:15:36] now the prophet would tell us God veiled
[1:15:38] in Jesus to do the work of redemption at
[1:15:41] the cross God could not die as a spirit
[1:15:45] he's eternal
[1:15:48] but he had to put on a mask and act
[1:15:51] apart of death he did die but he
[1:15:54] couldn't do it in his God form
[1:15:57] ain't that right and he couldn't do it
[1:16:00] in the body of Melchizedek that had no
[1:16:02] beginning or no ending
[1:16:04] can you say man he revealed himself as
[1:16:08] father see but in the sun form
[1:16:11] he could die
[1:16:15] he had to do it in some form as son of
[1:16:18] man on Earth
[1:16:21] he said notice God became material in a
[1:16:24] man called Jesus Christ which was his
[1:16:27] son this son gave his life that he might
[1:16:31] bring other Sons aren't you glad for
[1:16:34] that he wasn't a selfish individual a
[1:16:37] man but God was manifested in that human
[1:16:40] body that he could die to bring forth
[1:16:44] other Sons
[1:16:45] or you wouldn't be sick like you are
[1:16:47] today
[1:16:52] he said that God might become tangible
[1:16:56] this son gave his life that he might
[1:17:00] bring forth other sons that God might
[1:17:02] become tangible working all in all
[1:17:06] so God wasn't just satisfied with being
[1:17:08] in human flesh in the form of
[1:17:10] Melchizedek God wasn't just satisfied
[1:17:12] being in the working in the office and
[1:17:15] becoming tangible in his the body of his
[1:17:17] son God was looking to become tangible
[1:17:21] in this age that we're living in
[1:17:25] in you
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:31] I've read this before
[1:17:34] in him dwells the fullness of the
[1:17:37] godhead bodily
[1:17:39] now think of that in him dwells the
[1:17:41] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:17:43] wherein there in there we are Sons and
[1:17:49] Daughters of God are sons of daughters
[1:17:51] to God in God's godhead
[1:17:57] Hallelujah
[1:17:58] well we can see we we can see the
[1:18:00] offices of God in the father God as the
[1:18:03] son
[1:18:05] but what what what does it mean to have
[1:18:07] the Holy Ghost
[1:18:08] well brother Brown's telling you you're
[1:18:11] part of that godhead for this age
[1:18:15] and you say Amen
[1:18:17] see yes as Sons and Daughters were in
[1:18:22] the family if you're in there
[1:18:25] and where in the godhead in him
[1:18:29] and you say man
[1:18:31] that's right you were in Christ
[1:18:34] and Paul says it was the godhead that
[1:18:37] was in Christ
[1:18:38] the fullness of God dwelt bodily in him
[1:18:43] and you say Amen
[1:18:45] that's right see so I I know I I know
[1:18:49] the devil don't like us talking like
[1:18:50] that but it's true and and we we read it
[1:18:54] where Jesus said the glory that I that
[1:18:56] you gave me I now have given them
[1:18:59] that they may be one as I am one can you
[1:19:02] say amen amen don't look at yourself for
[1:19:05] some little insignificant amen human
[1:19:07] being amen don't look at yourself as
[1:19:10] just somebody that is just a uh uh you
[1:19:12] don't know if you're going to make it or
[1:19:13] not you can make it you will make it for
[1:19:17] you are part of God
[1:19:22] as I've told you before Jesus Christ
[1:19:25] now think of it thoughts God had
[1:19:27] thoughts that he wanted to become
[1:19:28] tangible
[1:19:29] so Jesus Christ was predestinated to be
[1:19:32] work that office of son
[1:19:34] God says I'm going to choose Jesus
[1:19:37] Christ that body and he'll come on a
[1:19:40] certain time be born the way he was and
[1:19:44] I will work my office in him
[1:19:47] a son
[1:19:49] ain't that right
[1:19:51] but at that same time brother Brown said
[1:19:54] you were just as predestinated as Jesus
[1:19:56] was
[1:19:58] not for that day but this day
[1:20:01] can you say amen for God wanted to
[1:20:03] become dead become tangible in this age
[1:20:06] and when he thought of himself becoming
[1:20:09] tangible in this age you appeared
[1:20:16] well that should make you excited
[1:20:19] that that just ain't that ain't just
[1:20:21] getting you hyped up that's truth
[1:20:24] that's truth God sent a prophet to tell
[1:20:28] us who we are in Christ Jesus
[1:20:34] so today
[1:20:35] God is manifesting himself in fullness
[1:20:38] in his church
[1:20:39] you believe that
[1:20:41] and so if he's manifesting himself he
[1:20:44] manifested himself only twice
[1:20:47] in fullness in fullness he manifested
[1:20:50] himself in fullness in the body of
[1:20:52] Melchizedek he manifested himself in
[1:20:55] fullness in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:59] but today he manifests himself in
[1:21:02] fullness for the third time
[1:21:04] in this age
[1:21:08] and that's where you and I fit in
[1:21:14] now notice brother Brown said there is
[1:21:17] the body of Christ Living
[1:21:18] standing redeemed
[1:21:22] redeemed he says he repeats it oh my
[1:21:27] God justified in his sight
[1:21:30] why are we Justified we are his victory
[1:21:36] we are the consummation if if that would
[1:21:39] be the right word the finale of his
[1:21:41] thoughts
[1:21:45] the church is his victory
[1:21:48] we come forth in this last days with
[1:21:52] this glorious gospel showing his victory
[1:21:56] he died for this purpose and we are
[1:21:58] proof of his victory amen when we see
[1:22:01] him coming down and living among the
[1:22:04] church that's his victory
[1:22:07] can you say Amen
[1:22:09] he wanted to become tangible in a body
[1:22:13] and yet a bunch of sinners
[1:22:17] nobodies
[1:22:19] unworthy
[1:22:21] without hope
[1:22:22] Hellbound
[1:22:24] under the possession of the devil slaves
[1:22:27] to sin
[1:22:29] and yet God says them are the people I
[1:22:31] want to live in
[1:22:35] them are the people
[1:22:39] that I want to be my hands
[1:22:41] I want to be my mouth
[1:22:44] I want to be my feet
[1:22:47] you look at the angels and Angels maybe
[1:22:48] if you just let's just think of it maybe
[1:22:52] the angel says but look at them
[1:22:54] they're worthless
[1:22:56] look look at the darkness that
[1:22:58] overshadows them
[1:23:00] they're drunks they're prostitutes
[1:23:02] they're no good they're Liars
[1:23:05] and yet God would say but I
[1:23:07] predestinated them to be conformed in my
[1:23:10] image
[1:23:13] and we already know that his word once
[1:23:15] it is sent it will not return unto him
[1:23:17] void
[1:23:19] but it shall accomplish that which he
[1:23:21] sent it to do
[1:23:26] so God would make the way he would work
[1:23:28] in the office of his son to die for you
[1:23:34] oh yeah it doesn't take away our
[1:23:36] Humanity
[1:23:38] we all have our faults we all have our
[1:23:40] failures
[1:23:41] but you know what he did do he took away
[1:23:43] the desire
[1:23:46] he took away our desire to be sinners
[1:23:49] took our desire away to want to drink
[1:23:52] and to lust and all that he takes all
[1:23:54] that away
[1:23:57] so then brother Brown would say yeah
[1:23:58] sure you're going to have mistakes
[1:24:00] sure you're going to fall
[1:24:02] but it's not sin yet
[1:24:07] now I know people take that and run with
[1:24:09] it
[1:24:10] I don't care about that
[1:24:11] I'm talking to predestinated people
[1:24:14] he said it's not sin yet
[1:24:17] he said for the moment you see that
[1:24:19] you're wrong you'll repent of it right
[1:24:20] then
[1:24:24] well praise God
[1:24:26] oh yeah God made a way that he could
[1:24:28] live in you
[1:24:30] and you say man
[1:24:32] now so he says see he said shows that he
[1:24:35] couldn't keep him in the grave neither
[1:24:37] then can they keep us see we're already
[1:24:39] potentially arise because we've raised
[1:24:42] from the dead unbelief in his word from
[1:24:45] denomination Creeds to an eternal word
[1:24:48] of the Eternal God which is him
[1:24:52] himself working through US manifesting
[1:24:56] himself that he is the same yesterday
[1:24:59] today and forever
[1:25:05] that right now if he couldn't manifest
[1:25:08] himself full in his fullness in the
[1:25:10] church then he couldn't show himself to
[1:25:12] be the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:18] now notice the prophet said he was
[1:25:20] manifested in the fatherhood
[1:25:22] he was manifested in the sonship
[1:25:25] he's manifested now in the dispensation
[1:25:29] of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:32] ain't that right so what is it God is
[1:25:35] now manifested in his fullness in his
[1:25:38] church his bride
[1:25:41] today
[1:25:43] I'm going to repeat these things and
[1:25:45] hopefully to get it to you
[1:25:47] God represented himself in fullness in
[1:25:49] the body of Melchizedek as son of man
[1:25:54] right
[1:25:55] and God is the word now that's what the
[1:25:57] prophet says
[1:25:58] he was the word he he was son of man to
[1:26:02] Abraham
[1:26:04] the complete fullness of God was in the
[1:26:07] body of Jesus Christ
[1:26:09] son of man
[1:26:12] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:26:15] bodily
[1:26:19] dwells in his church
[1:26:22] and Paul says the church is his body
[1:26:26] which is the fullness of him
[1:26:29] and you say Amen
[1:26:32] so it's God
[1:26:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:37] inflation
[1:26:39] as son of man
[1:26:44] in this age
[1:26:46] can you say Amen God the fullness Luke
[1:26:49] 17 29 we know it very well
[1:26:52] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:26:54] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:26:58] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[1:27:01] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:27:03] man is revealed
[1:27:05] now notice how the prophet always puts
[1:27:07] it he always puts it there everybody
[1:27:09] looks at Noah the the world looks at
[1:27:11] Lord the days of lot as as homosexuals
[1:27:14] as this is that and this and they fail
[1:27:16] to miss the important thing
[1:27:18] while that was be just before it fell
[1:27:21] the son of man God was revealing himself
[1:27:25] in human flesh
[1:27:27] and that's what the prophet was getting
[1:27:29] at and John that's what this scripture
[1:27:32] is the same God that would manifest
[1:27:34] himself back there in human flesh is
[1:27:37] doing it again today
[1:27:41] amen so God the father in a word body
[1:27:46] reveal this son of man
[1:27:48] God the son in a created body
[1:27:52] born word born
[1:27:54] body
[1:27:59] reveal this son of man
[1:28:01] now God the holy ghost in a redeemed
[1:28:04] body
[1:28:05] revealed as son of man
[1:28:08] can you say Amen
[1:28:10] see the prophet said he's God the Father
[1:28:12] sure he was in the beginning he's God
[1:28:15] the son that was made Flesh on Earth
[1:28:17] he's God the Holy Ghost which is in me
[1:28:20] but it's the same God God Alone working
[1:28:24] in three offices
[1:28:26] I hope you understand where I'm getting
[1:28:27] at
[1:28:28] see another place the one God made
[1:28:32] himself three offices three
[1:28:35] manifestations
[1:28:37] oh don't sell yourself short
[1:28:41] that's right and notice three offices
[1:28:44] three manifestations
[1:28:47] one sign
[1:28:50] being performed in each office
[1:28:53] and you say man
[1:28:55] now Prophet said Jesus said as it was in
[1:28:58] the days of Sodom so shall it be at the
[1:29:01] coming of the son of man
[1:29:03] that same God would appear in the flesh
[1:29:06] of his church and would show the same
[1:29:09] sign
[1:29:10] another place Jesus said as it was in
[1:29:12] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:29:14] coming of the son of man that God would
[1:29:17] manifest himself in human flesh his
[1:29:21] church the body of Christ and would do
[1:29:23] the same sign
[1:29:27] now we know
[1:29:29] that Jesus performed the same sign
[1:29:32] to the Jew and Samaritan
[1:29:34] but the prophet said he never did it to
[1:29:35] the Gentiles
[1:29:37] ain't that right so he promised that the
[1:29:41] same sign would be performed to the
[1:29:44] Gentiles aren't you glad we've
[1:29:46] recognized that sign
[1:29:48] and just as as it quickened the seed to
[1:29:53] that Samaritan woman remember she was a
[1:29:55] prostitute but when that sign was done
[1:29:58] quickly she recognized him as the
[1:30:00] Messiah and he said quickly her sins
[1:30:03] were forgiven her
[1:30:06] Hallelujah
[1:30:07] I'm so glad I'm a Believer
[1:30:09] I'm so glad that I can believe the sign
[1:30:11] that God has done in this age it does
[1:30:14] something for you can you say amen for
[1:30:17] the Pharisee the Pharisee that that that
[1:30:20] priest he saw the sign and called it the
[1:30:23] devil
[1:30:25] and went to hell for it
[1:30:27] but here was a lonely lady
[1:30:30] that needed help
[1:30:32] that needed Grace
[1:30:34] that needed salvation
[1:30:36] she was an elect she was predestinated
[1:30:38] and when Jesus performed that sign to
[1:30:40] her
[1:30:41] she recognized it believed it
[1:30:44] and quickly her sins
[1:30:46] were forgivener
[1:30:48] oh my
[1:30:49] you love him
[1:30:51] now notice
[1:30:53] brother Branham said now we've had 2 000
[1:30:57] years that's never been in the church
[1:31:00] now I'm going to get somewheres in just
[1:31:02] a moment now I want you to listen to me
[1:31:03] and we'll close
[1:31:04] here in in shortly
[1:31:07] Lord Willie
[1:31:08] but
[1:31:09] brother Brown said now this sign we've
[1:31:12] had 2 000 years
[1:31:14] and this sign has never been in the
[1:31:16] church
[1:31:18] but it shall be light in the evening
[1:31:20] time
[1:31:21] the prophet said there will be a day
[1:31:23] that it won't be neither uh called night
[1:31:26] and or day but in the evening time it
[1:31:29] shall be light so keep in mind that sign
[1:31:32] has never been in the church
[1:31:37] all these two thousand years never been
[1:31:39] in the church
[1:31:41] brother Branham in another place said we
[1:31:43] believe Jesus Christ has raised from the
[1:31:45] dead and is making himself known down
[1:31:47] through the aid Church age as what Son
[1:31:51] of God everybody say ask Son of God
[1:31:55] and now
[1:31:57] fulfilling his promise in the last day
[1:32:01] to reveal himself to Abraham's roll seed
[1:32:05] as son of man
[1:32:09] right
[1:32:11] right now
[1:32:13] my desire
[1:32:15] is for us to see where the body of
[1:32:18] Christ stands today
[1:32:23] there are some
[1:32:26] who see no different
[1:32:28] and where the church is today from that
[1:32:31] of the first church in the book of Acts
[1:32:34] but there is a difference
[1:32:36] there there is a difference between the
[1:32:40] church today and the church the first
[1:32:42] church of the book of Acts
[1:32:44] and yet it's the same
[1:32:48] there is no difference
[1:32:51] so there is and there isn't
[1:32:55] right
[1:32:57] now Matthew first of all Matthew 16 and
[1:33:01] 16 Jesus says that he was going to build
[1:33:04] his church right
[1:33:05] said Upon This Rock which we know to be
[1:33:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ of what
[1:33:10] he was and who he is upon that rock
[1:33:13] Jesus said I'll build my church and the
[1:33:15] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:33:18] we also know if you want to go back and
[1:33:21] listen to the masterpiece
[1:33:23] 64.
[1:33:25] I I would encourage you to do so
[1:33:28] but brother Branham called this church a
[1:33:30] masterpiece
[1:33:32] but notice what he said not just a
[1:33:34] masterpiece another Masterpiece another
[1:33:39] Jesus was the first masterpiece
[1:33:42] ain't that right
[1:33:44] Jesus being the first masterpiece and
[1:33:48] the prophet said in that first
[1:33:50] Masterpiece he was the Fulfillment of
[1:33:53] everything that God promised
[1:33:56] ain't that right another place in in
[1:33:59] that message Masterpiece all Promises of
[1:34:02] the Old Testament was met in Jesus
[1:34:05] Christ
[1:34:06] speaking of that first Masterpiece it
[1:34:08] couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be
[1:34:10] met in any of the prophets but it was
[1:34:13] met in the Masterpiece it masked all
[1:34:18] that it said it was going to be oh my
[1:34:21] he matched it ain't that right
[1:34:27] in Genesis God told the serpent that the
[1:34:29] woman's feet shall bruise his head
[1:34:32] and that he the serpent shall bruise his
[1:34:35] head or his heel
[1:34:37] Jesus matched that prophecy for he was
[1:34:41] the woman's seed
[1:34:42] brother Brown said see God couldn't
[1:34:44] bruise that Serpent's head with the law
[1:34:47] he couldn't bruise it with the prophets
[1:34:50] but he done it in Jesus Christ
[1:34:53] ain't that right his life matched
[1:34:56] Moses's life his life matched David's
[1:34:59] life his life matched Joseph's life his
[1:35:03] life matched Elijah's life his man's
[1:35:06] life the life of uh of of Isaac's life
[1:35:09] ain't that right everything foretold by
[1:35:13] him in the Old Testament matched right
[1:35:16] into that showing a perfect Redeemer
[1:35:20] masterpiece
[1:35:26] what was it the word became flesh
[1:35:29] son of man
[1:35:31] now notice what he says now so will the
[1:35:34] church because now the church is the
[1:35:36] Masterpiece he called The Church a
[1:35:37] masterpiece so will the church have to
[1:35:41] be a match to everything God has
[1:35:43] promised
[1:35:45] oh my that ought to make us excited
[1:35:49] don't sell yourself short
[1:35:52] Satan can't take your life until your
[1:35:54] life becomes a perfect match
[1:35:57] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:35:59] hello Church
[1:36:01] if you if you've been born again you've
[1:36:04] got the Holy Ghost down inside of you
[1:36:06] you have only it's only baptized you
[1:36:08] into that body of Jesus Christ
[1:36:13] and you're living in the age of a finale
[1:36:17] you're living in the age when the
[1:36:19] Masterpiece becomes the Masterpiece the
[1:36:22] church becomes the masterpiece
[1:36:26] now notice the prophet said as it taken
[1:36:29] him four thousand years
[1:36:31] to make this masterpiece speaking of
[1:36:33] Jesus Christ now he's been for nearly 2
[1:36:36] 000 years making another Masterpiece a
[1:36:39] bride for Christ another Masterpiece
[1:36:42] right so look where you're at today
[1:36:44] masterpiece
[1:36:46] right Masterpiece now see in when
[1:36:50] brother Brown talks about Michelangelo
[1:36:52] making that image of Moses in the
[1:36:54] Masterpiece but you know it was not a
[1:36:57] masterpiece when he was when he picked
[1:36:59] up that rock and put it on that ground
[1:37:00] or or when he dropped the Rock and put
[1:37:02] it in his garage or wherever he was that
[1:37:05] wasn't the Masterpiece he started
[1:37:07] shaping and and the first hour didn't
[1:37:09] make a masterpiece he spent day after
[1:37:12] day after day and yet it wasn't a
[1:37:14] masterpiece yet
[1:37:16] foreign
[1:37:19] but when when he he looked he stepped
[1:37:24] back one day and he looked at it
[1:37:27] and what he had in his mind was standing
[1:37:29] there before him
[1:37:31] and he got so inspired by it he lost his
[1:37:35] senses
[1:37:36] and he took that hammer and he struck
[1:37:39] and said speak
[1:37:41] why he said that's the masterpiece
[1:37:45] oh my God foreign
[1:37:48] what he saw reflected in his thoughts
[1:37:50] was right there standing before him
[1:37:53] can you say Amen so see the masterpieces
[1:37:57] today
[1:37:59] 2 000 years he's been making this
[1:38:02] masterpiece
[1:38:04] my I'm so glad to be part of this age
[1:38:07] oh it would have been nice to be in
[1:38:09] Paul's age it would have been nice to be
[1:38:10] on the days of Acts it but but oh my
[1:38:13] amen what a greater age that we're
[1:38:15] living in today that we can stand here
[1:38:17] and say we are that Masterpiece we are
[1:38:20] the finishing touch
[1:38:25] so we find he says see in so doing it in
[1:38:28] building this masterpiece he does it by
[1:38:31] his never changing method the same way
[1:38:34] he made the Masterpiece his word
[1:38:36] see that's the way he makes his
[1:38:38] masterpieces because he can only be a
[1:38:41] perfect Masterpiece when it's the
[1:38:43] perfect word
[1:38:45] can you say man
[1:38:47] now notice when his Masterpiece was
[1:38:49] perfected Christ then he had to Smite it
[1:38:52] to take from him another Peace not
[1:38:56] another creation but of the same
[1:38:59] creation
[1:39:01] foreign
[1:39:04] so we know that it fulfills the type of
[1:39:06] Adam and Eve ain't that right he created
[1:39:10] Adam and he took out of out of Adam Eve
[1:39:14] oh my
[1:39:16] God so see so and she was Adam
[1:39:19] that's right she was Adam in feminine
[1:39:21] form flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:39:24] so much that her name was Adam
[1:39:27] until after the fall then she was Eve
[1:39:29] but her name was Adam
[1:39:31] ain't that right
[1:39:32] she was Adam in feminine form now the
[1:39:36] prophet says then if he
[1:39:38] was the word
[1:39:39] the Masterpiece I brought groom if he
[1:39:43] was the word what must the bride be it's
[1:39:46] got to be the original word Living God
[1:39:49] in the word
[1:39:50] ain't that right so the church the bride
[1:39:53] is going to be a perfect match
[1:39:58] praise the Lord
[1:40:00] I think that you ought to put that in
[1:40:02] your Arsenal to the devil
[1:40:06] you can try me you can whatever you want
[1:40:09] to do but I'm a perfect match
[1:40:17] now brother Brown said see he fulfilled
[1:40:19] the Old Testament
[1:40:21] talking about the first Masterpiece now
[1:40:24] it's the New Testament another piece to
[1:40:26] be fulfilled
[1:40:28] and see the new and old is the husband
[1:40:31] and wife and it taken the new see the
[1:40:34] old foreshow the new Christ come the
[1:40:38] Masterpiece to fulfill that now his
[1:40:41] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[1:40:43] the New Testament see another
[1:40:46] Masterpiece is in making
[1:40:48] now we know that that church started
[1:40:51] was birthed on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:54] ain't that right and and I'll tell you
[1:40:56] it's the only time that it was birthed
[1:40:59] the only time it was not birth on Azusa
[1:41:02] Street it was birth on the day of
[1:41:06] Pentecost
[1:41:07] it didn't eat another birth
[1:41:09] this church was inaugurated on the day
[1:41:11] of Pentecost ain't that right so now
[1:41:14] we're we're not sitting here looking
[1:41:16] back at that church
[1:41:18] and looking at this present church as
[1:41:21] though they're different from one
[1:41:23] another no no they're the same thing
[1:41:25] they're the same part
[1:41:28] ain't that right
[1:41:31] amen the church today is the one that
[1:41:34] was birthed on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:38] so now notice what that first church was
[1:41:41] he and brother Brown said he started on
[1:41:43] the day of Pentecost to build another
[1:41:46] Masterpiece The Original Seed word see
[1:41:49] started in the first church what was it
[1:41:52] the seed word the word manifested the
[1:41:55] promise that had been given Joel said it
[1:41:58] shall come to pass in the last day saith
[1:42:01] God I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:42:03] Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[1:42:04] prophesy your old uh your old man shall
[1:42:07] dream dreams or young men shall see
[1:42:10] Vision see what he would do in the last
[1:42:12] days the last two thousand years ain't
[1:42:14] that right so the church was birthed
[1:42:17] under a prophecy
[1:42:19] by a prophecy being fulfilled it was not
[1:42:23] birthed upon a man's ideology it was not
[1:42:26] birthed by a preacher it was birthed by
[1:42:28] the spirit of God and he started that
[1:42:31] church Upon A promise
[1:42:35] now brother Brown said God planted a
[1:42:38] holy ghost seed on the day of Pentecost
[1:42:41] and he called it that little seed of
[1:42:44] Pentecost
[1:42:47] the seed is the church
[1:42:49] so I'm going to just read some quotes
[1:42:51] here I hope that's all right but he said
[1:42:53] at the beginning it was Pentecost not an
[1:42:56] organization but a Pentecostal
[1:42:59] experience that brought the seed of God
[1:43:02] down by the Holy Ghost Maiden men and
[1:43:05] women speak in tongues and stagger like
[1:43:07] drunk men Spirit operating in the church
[1:43:10] showing signs and wonders another place
[1:43:13] he said see the grain that seed was
[1:43:16] planted at Pentecost
[1:43:19] he says in another place it started out
[1:43:21] as the original
[1:43:23] you know what that means then that is
[1:43:26] the pattern for us today
[1:43:30] it's the pattern
[1:43:35] you love him
[1:43:37] Jesus said that the word of God is a
[1:43:39] seed
[1:43:40] that the sower went and sowed
[1:43:42] and the word is the seed ain't that
[1:43:45] right he was the sower so that seed at
[1:43:49] the day of Pentecost God planted it had
[1:43:52] perfect life in it
[1:43:56] right
[1:43:58] brother Brandon speaking of this Bright
[1:44:00] Tree
[1:44:01] the church said when that tree started
[1:44:03] off it was a Pentecostal tree
[1:44:08] people are scared of that word
[1:44:09] Pentecostal nonsense
[1:44:14] don't don't get quiet on me Church
[1:44:17] you've got to be identified with
[1:44:19] Pentecost
[1:44:22] when we first come into the message
[1:44:24] we were labeled Pentecostal
[1:44:26] Pentecostal why we're too excitable
[1:44:32] we believed in speaking in tongues still
[1:44:35] do
[1:44:36] believed in dancing still do
[1:44:39] believed in shouting and we still do
[1:44:43] but they labeled it Pentecost but now
[1:44:45] after I begin to reading what brother
[1:44:47] Bradham says and and I've seen clearly
[1:44:50] I'm proud to be Pentecostal
[1:44:55] I'm proud that people would identify me
[1:44:57] as a Pentecost
[1:44:59] because the church started as a
[1:45:01] Pentecostal Church
[1:45:04] can you say man brother Brown said the
[1:45:07] real genuine article of God was
[1:45:09] Pentecost
[1:45:11] Pentecost is not only for Azusa they
[1:45:14] made a shame of Pentecost that
[1:45:17] Pentecostal age is just an age but the
[1:45:20] real genuine article of God at the day
[1:45:24] of Pentecost was Pentecost
[1:45:27] he says was
[1:45:30] is and always will be
[1:45:33] that's where the church began right here
[1:45:36] with Pentecostal power
[1:45:39] in another place he says because of the
[1:45:41] unchanging God with unchanging ways we
[1:45:44] can go back to the beginning and see the
[1:45:47] first and perfect ACT of God and then
[1:45:50] judge the by that standard judge your
[1:45:53] life by that standard judge this church
[1:45:55] by that standard the moment we stop
[1:45:58] seeing Miracles and not believing in
[1:46:00] these things it's the moment we ought to
[1:46:02] see that we're lost
[1:46:05] yes yes sir judged by the standards
[1:46:10] and you say Amen
[1:46:12] oh you can you can amen it's profit
[1:46:14] Prophet saying it Church don't be scared
[1:46:16] don't let your denominator don't let the
[1:46:19] denominational teachings around this
[1:46:20] message scare you
[1:46:22] it's okay to be a Pentecostal identified
[1:46:25] as a Pentecostal church it's okay to
[1:46:28] dance it's okay to shout it's okay where
[1:46:30] it's not okay is where you get formal
[1:46:32] dried up and just sitting there without
[1:46:34] an experience
[1:46:36] don't lick some some backslidden
[1:46:39] preacher some backslidden teacher some
[1:46:42] backslidden whatever tell you that you
[1:46:45] can't dance and take the joy away take
[1:46:47] your shouting away take the move of God
[1:46:49] away
[1:46:52] they can say well that's fanaticism
[1:46:54] hogwash
[1:46:56] there is fanaticism in anything but
[1:46:59] there's a genuine article
[1:47:06] now look now he says then judge that by
[1:47:09] stand by that standard
[1:47:11] that is how it is done the true church
[1:47:13] everybody say the true church will
[1:47:16] always say We'll always
[1:47:19] try to be like the original at Pentecost
[1:47:21] the true church of today will try to
[1:47:24] approximate that early first one
[1:47:29] and The Messengers to the church having
[1:47:31] the same spirit of God in them will try
[1:47:33] to approximate the Apostle Paul
[1:47:36] they won't be exactly like him but the
[1:47:38] true Messengers will be the ones that
[1:47:40] come the closest to Paul who is free of
[1:47:43] all men sold out to God and gave forth
[1:47:45] the word of God only and manifested the
[1:47:48] Holy Ghost in power none else would can
[1:47:50] you say Amen so he says you have to work
[1:47:53] from the original as life begets like
[1:47:56] the true church will always be the one
[1:47:59] that tries to follow in the steps of her
[1:48:01] Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers
[1:48:04] will follow the Apostle Paul the first
[1:48:06] Messenger to the first church age
[1:48:09] he said it's always been a Pentecostal
[1:48:11] Church
[1:48:12] can you say man here in this other quote
[1:48:16] brother Brown said if the first Vine
[1:48:17] that come out of Jesus Christ produced a
[1:48:20] Pentecostal Church filled with the Holy
[1:48:22] Ghost in power the second Branch will do
[1:48:24] the same thing the third branch will be
[1:48:26] another every Branch it puts forth will
[1:48:29] be that same kind of branch
[1:48:35] another one says that the first Vine
[1:48:37] brought forth the Pentecostal Church the
[1:48:39] second Vine uh uh rather out of the vine
[1:48:42] will bring forth another Pentecostal
[1:48:44] church with the Pentecostal experience
[1:48:46] bearing the same fruits that the first
[1:48:48] church had
[1:48:50] ain't that right another one if the
[1:48:53] first church that come out of that vine
[1:48:55] was a Pentecostal church that wrote a
[1:48:57] book of Acts behind it the second Church
[1:48:59] comes out we'll do the same thing and
[1:49:01] the Third Church see every church that
[1:49:03] rises out of that vine and Jesus said
[1:49:06] I'm the vine you're the branch so every
[1:49:09] church that comes out of that vine as a
[1:49:12] branch unto the Lord will be a
[1:49:14] Pentecostal church with the same signs
[1:49:16] and wonders that the first fine producer
[1:49:19] the first Branch produced it'll be like
[1:49:21] Pentecost see every church that rises
[1:49:24] out of that vine will be a Pentecostal
[1:49:28] Church
[1:49:32] foreign
[1:49:34] what was it on the day of Pentecost
[1:49:36] Prophet said the people were rejoicing
[1:49:39] they were happy
[1:49:40] they were shouting
[1:49:42] ain't that right
[1:49:44] amen he said the first church shouted
[1:49:46] and carried on
[1:49:48] he said it was the shout of the king
[1:49:50] that was in the camp and you say man
[1:49:52] they spoke in tongues how many believes
[1:49:55] in speaking in tongues
[1:49:57] brother Brown said you get deep enough
[1:49:58] you will speak in tongues you get deep
[1:50:01] enough in the Holy Ghost you will speak
[1:50:02] in tongues
[1:50:04] hello
[1:50:05] see so he said see they shouted they
[1:50:08] spoke in tongues they they danced they
[1:50:11] they Rejoice they prayed for the sick
[1:50:13] they've done Miracles and so forth they
[1:50:15] were so perfectly in harmony with God
[1:50:19] another place when the sun began to
[1:50:21] raise back on there on the first church
[1:50:23] they had signs and wonders and the very
[1:50:27] same things that Jesus of Nazareth did
[1:50:29] they did also
[1:50:31] it was a word seed
[1:50:36] believe it
[1:50:37] it was a word seed so they had to do it
[1:50:42] that's right see so so I want to say it
[1:50:46] this way they're shouting they're
[1:50:48] carrying on they're dancing they're
[1:50:50] speaking in tongues they're dreams their
[1:50:52] Visions it was not based on some
[1:50:55] sensation
[1:50:57] it was based on the word
[1:50:59] yes there are people that danced on
[1:51:01] based off Sensations but a church that
[1:51:05] first church was based on the word of
[1:51:08] God
[1:51:10] ain't that right
[1:51:12] so if the church will do these things
[1:51:14] a man in seed form then what will it do
[1:51:18] today in a ripened form
[1:51:23] yes sir the word produced it you're not
[1:51:26] out of line when you're worshiping God
[1:51:29] you're not out of line when you're
[1:51:30] praising God and you're glorifying God
[1:51:32] Abraham said I've never seen anyone out
[1:51:35] of line yet when they're worshiping God
[1:51:38] hello they might be out of line talking
[1:51:41] to one another while church is going on
[1:51:42] they might be out of line jumping up and
[1:51:44] prophesying while the preaching is going
[1:51:46] on but never was they out of line when
[1:51:48] they're worshiping God
[1:51:54] foreign
[1:51:55] I like it you got that that video
[1:51:59] uh what is it deep calleth undo the Deep
[1:52:03] and you hear them women just glorifying
[1:52:05] God and brother Brown's talking
[1:52:07] here and you hear him screaming and
[1:52:09] hollering
[1:52:10] and the video goes the camera goes to
[1:52:12] them and you see that colored woman two
[1:52:14] of them I think
[1:52:16] and brother Brown just turns around says
[1:52:17] well God bless you colored people
[1:52:20] rejoicing and pray they didn't stop him
[1:52:22] he didn't condemn them
[1:52:23] he said God bless you
[1:52:25] why God loves worship
[1:52:28] and brother Brown said this is the time
[1:52:30] for King Glam worship
[1:52:31] if they can worship God In seed form if
[1:52:34] they can have the power of God In seed
[1:52:36] form what shall we do in a in a ripened
[1:52:39] Church
[1:52:40] can you say Amen you say well we're
[1:52:42] matured out of that nonsense you might
[1:52:44] be matured out to where you just got
[1:52:46] left the word amen gets so mature to
[1:52:48] where you leave the word and you go off
[1:52:50] to what Dr so-and-so says and this old
[1:52:52] dead dried up theologians says and that
[1:52:55] one that ain't got no experience they're
[1:52:57] behind the pulpit that's why brother
[1:52:58] Brown said every Minister that stands
[1:53:00] behind this Pulpit needs a back inside
[1:53:02] of the desert first get an experience
[1:53:04] with God know that you got something
[1:53:05] down inside of you can you say Amen that
[1:53:08] way you won't discourage people from
[1:53:10] dancing you won't discourage the people
[1:53:12] from rejoicing and claiming their
[1:53:14] Victory he'll stay and wave the promises
[1:53:16] over them can you say amen that's right
[1:53:19] I I know brother Brad well brother
[1:53:21] random even says I'd rather have too
[1:53:23] much Wildfire than no fire at all
[1:53:28] ain't that right
[1:53:30] so now notice
[1:53:32] you know if you've had a word birth you
[1:53:35] know you you hear us talk about word
[1:53:37] birth need a word birth well we didn't
[1:53:40] know about a word until brother Brown
[1:53:41] talked about word birth
[1:53:43] so you got to have a word birth ain't
[1:53:45] that right but you know what you're not
[1:53:47] out of line when you're praising God
[1:53:48] dancing excited about the things of God
[1:53:50] and if you have a word birth you will be
[1:53:53] a part of that
[1:53:55] I'm not saying you'll dance I'm not
[1:53:57] saying but there will be an excitement
[1:53:59] about the word
[1:54:00] can you say man you might speak in
[1:54:03] tongues you might not you may prophesy
[1:54:05] you may not you you may but but one
[1:54:07] thing about it God will have complete
[1:54:09] control in your life
[1:54:13] can you say amen that's right see now
[1:54:15] now notice what the prophet said in in
[1:54:18] uh uh invisible Union of the Bride he
[1:54:22] said see he said the modern Church
[1:54:24] doesn't want any of these here screaming
[1:54:26] shouting tongue speaking Acts 2 38
[1:54:29] youngins around here I just heard a man
[1:54:31] speaking on adoption teaching on
[1:54:33] adoption doing a teaching on adoption
[1:54:35] and left out every gift that we don't
[1:54:37] need the gifts anymore in the church I
[1:54:39] thought man you got your adoption all
[1:54:41] messed up go back and listen to the
[1:54:42] prophet right
[1:54:47] if we're like the first Branch tell me
[1:54:50] when God took the gifts out
[1:54:56] if if we're like the Original Seed tell
[1:54:58] me when God takes all this stuff out
[1:55:03] you go listen to the what restoration of
[1:55:06] the Bride yeah restoration bride you'll
[1:55:09] find out it was the devil that took it
[1:55:10] out
[1:55:11] the devil took out brotherly love the
[1:55:12] devil took out the gifts the devil took
[1:55:14] out Fellowship the devil took out
[1:55:16] rejoicing and shouting the devil took
[1:55:19] out the life
[1:55:21] the devil took all these doctrines away
[1:55:23] the devil messed us up can you say Amen
[1:55:27] the devil took our freedoms away
[1:55:29] but God promised I'll restore saith the
[1:55:33] Lord and we are a product of that
[1:55:36] restoration
[1:55:38] aren't you glad for that
[1:55:40] so here the modern Church doesn't want
[1:55:42] any of these here screaming shouting
[1:55:44] tongues speak in Acts 2 38 youngins
[1:55:46] around her she don't want none of them
[1:55:48] screaming hollering blabbing to Acts 2
[1:55:50] 38 miserable creatures that she thinks
[1:55:52] they are she don't want to be pregnated
[1:55:55] with the word because that's the only
[1:55:57] kind that the word can bring forth
[1:56:01] ain't that right so that's what they had
[1:56:04] in the first church because it was the
[1:56:06] word seed or seed word so we we find
[1:56:09] that you cannot have that kind of a
[1:56:12] birth word birth without the spirit of
[1:56:14] God
[1:56:15] ain't that right yes sir brother Brown
[1:56:18] said you are born of the spirit of God
[1:56:21] it has the spirit of God in it now I'm
[1:56:23] going to close amen but notice see what
[1:56:27] you will do amen uh in the word of God
[1:56:30] brother Brandon said what you will find
[1:56:32] Amen in the word of God because see they
[1:56:36] want women cutting their hair they want
[1:56:38] the makeup they're now they're allowing
[1:56:40] the homosexuals transgenders and and all
[1:56:42] of these things see they and and wrote
[1:56:45] Brown said you won't find that in the
[1:56:47] word you you just don't find that stuff
[1:56:49] he says what you will find in the word
[1:56:52] is an old-fashioned Sanctified holy
[1:56:55] ghost-filled child born of the spirit of
[1:56:57] God screaming hollering shouting and
[1:57:00] praising God
[1:57:01] another place he said shouting religion
[1:57:04] is the oldest religion in the world it's
[1:57:07] even older than the Earth
[1:57:11] shouting religion can you say Amen
[1:57:13] for we find out in Job that even the
[1:57:16] sons of God shouted for Joy before the
[1:57:19] foundation of the world ain't that right
[1:57:21] and notice how brother Branham he asked
[1:57:24] this question how do we know that that
[1:57:26] wasn't that at the same time that the
[1:57:29] lamb was slain and that when God in his
[1:57:33] great thinking seen us shouting and
[1:57:35] rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus
[1:57:38] Christ my think of that the sons of God
[1:57:41] shouting where was it in the mind of God
[1:57:45] thank you
[1:57:46] he said how do you know it wasn't us
[1:57:50] shouting when the lamb was slain before
[1:57:52] the foundation of the world
[1:57:54] and we were rejoicing because of our
[1:57:55] Liberty and here you are now not in the
[1:57:59] mind of God but now you're manifested on
[1:58:01] Earth amen singing praises unto God
[1:58:05] Hallelujah do you love him
[1:58:08] oh isn't he wonderful
[1:58:11] so this is what the first church had
[1:58:13] because it was a word seed
[1:58:16] now brother Brown speaking of them first
[1:58:18] that first church he said I can imagine
[1:58:20] them Apostles never acted like us
[1:58:23] went around probably meant a few words
[1:58:26] until they got in the Pulpit they walked
[1:58:28] in and they done what was they were
[1:58:31] supposed to do and walked out they had
[1:58:33] power they advert you they had known
[1:58:35] arguments with men they know where they
[1:58:37] stood that's all they know who they
[1:58:40] believed they kept on walking in the
[1:58:41] spirit he said you know he said just as
[1:58:44] I said the other night one little nod
[1:58:46] that's all God had to do then nothing
[1:58:48] going to stop them they didn't question
[1:58:50] and study and and hum Hall and worry
[1:58:54] like we do whether they should do this
[1:58:57] or that they went ahead and done it
[1:58:59] anyhow just one little nod from God that
[1:59:01] done it just as soon why how could they
[1:59:04] know it was a nod from God they had all
[1:59:07] these virtues all these qualifications
[1:59:10] can you say amen amen that's right see
[1:59:13] so there was brotherly love in that
[1:59:15] first church for Paul said let Brotherly
[1:59:18] Love continue ain't that right the life
[1:59:21] that was in Jesus Christ was in the
[1:59:23] first church Church they did not walk by
[1:59:25] sight they walked by faith can you say
[1:59:28] amen and they believed what God Said was
[1:59:31] the truth that was the first church
[1:59:34] that's what was in seed form that God
[1:59:37] inaugurated on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:59:40] it was the first church a man that went
[1:59:43] forth performing the same kind of signs
[1:59:45] that Jesus did because God was with them
[1:59:48] working with them confirming the word
[1:59:50] with signs following Brother Brown said
[1:59:53] they had Faith to heal the sick cast out
[1:59:56] devils and do miracles
[1:59:58] yet
[2:00:01] so they had all these things but yet the
[2:00:05] Holy Ghost did not come in its full
[2:00:09] manifestation
[2:00:13] it was in seed
[2:00:17] hello
[2:00:19] it did not come in its full
[2:00:21] manifestation
[2:00:23] it did not come into its full strength
[2:00:25] it did not produce the manifestation of
[2:00:28] sons of God it did not reveal the son of
[2:00:31] man can you say Amen all the promises of
[2:00:35] God were not fulfilled in that first
[2:00:38] church
[2:00:39] wow
[2:00:41] they had the perfect life there
[2:00:45] but all the promises was not fulfilled
[2:00:49] and I have to say it even it's contrary
[2:00:51] to maybe what some are teaching
[2:00:55] they could not go in that rapture
[2:00:57] because it was not Harvest seed
[2:01:00] it was not Harvest Time
[2:01:03] and you say man
[2:01:05] the potential was there
[2:01:07] as we can see what they had in the book
[2:01:09] of Acts
[2:01:10] but anything the prophet said anything
[2:01:13] potential is not the real thing yet
[2:01:16] that word I looked it up potential is
[2:01:18] something that can develop or become
[2:01:20] actual
[2:01:21] so the potential was laying there
[2:01:24] in seed
[2:01:26] ain't that right but notice the seed had
[2:01:30] to die
[2:01:31] ain't that right is that not what the
[2:01:34] church ages are about
[2:01:35] the seed had to die
[2:01:37] oh my
[2:01:39] yes sir that seed was in its beginning
[2:01:42] stages
[2:01:43] so it couldn't have been in the Harvest
[2:01:45] in that stage because it wasn't ripened
[2:01:48] ain't that right they had the potential
[2:01:50] to be raptured they had the potential to
[2:01:52] have a body change they had the
[2:01:54] potential for all these things but it
[2:01:56] was not Harvest Time
[2:02:01] John 12 24 verily verily I say unto you
[2:02:04] except the corner wheat fall into the
[2:02:07] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[2:02:10] it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[2:02:13] ain't that right
[2:02:15] so any seat
[2:02:17] the prophet said that by that that bides
[2:02:19] alone
[2:02:20] it does nothing
[2:02:26] Sister Kim uh as she taught Sunday
[2:02:30] School
[2:02:31] should bring seeds to the children
[2:02:34] give them to plant
[2:02:39] then if they would just let that seed on
[2:02:40] the table
[2:02:43] it abides alone
[2:02:45] it doesn't do anything
[2:02:47] it's got the potential
[2:02:49] it's got the power
[2:02:51] it's got it all there
[2:02:54] if you can go eat corn well I want corn
[2:02:55] I want to have corn for supper don't go
[2:02:57] get corn seeds
[2:03:01] I'm glad my wife knows the difference
[2:03:03] doing seed and fruit
[2:03:06] hello
[2:03:07] I want corn okay there you are bull
[2:03:09] seeds
[2:03:11] I don't want to eat seeds but all the
[2:03:13] corns there I understand that but it's
[2:03:16] not ripened yet
[2:03:17] hello
[2:03:19] but God wouldn't pluck his church in
[2:03:21] seed form
[2:03:22] it had to ripen
[2:03:24] it had to come to its full strength
[2:03:29] I'm on clothes
[2:03:31] but I'm so glad we're part of that
[2:03:33] church today
[2:03:35] aren't you glad we're part of that
[2:03:36] church
[2:03:38] that I can identify with that first
[2:03:39] Pentecostal Church
[2:03:41] but I understand this
[2:03:43] we have come further
[2:03:45] because they failed on the word
[2:03:48] they failed to go on for the word
[2:03:50] because brother Brown said they died
[2:03:51] when they organized that's he'd win in
[2:03:54] the ground
[2:03:55] but here you and I are
[2:03:57] what God had in his thinking
[2:04:01] it's in manifestation today
[2:04:04] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that
[2:04:06] amen if the musicians will come
[2:04:09] I hope it's been a help to you
[2:04:11] hope you've enjoyed it
[2:04:13] amen
[2:04:14] I just love the Lord
[2:04:16] my maybe this is just all something
[2:04:19] you've heard and heard and heard and
[2:04:21] heard don't let it ever get common to
[2:04:23] you
[2:04:24] my
[2:04:25] Satan will whip you around if you just
[2:04:27] let it get common
[2:04:29] but when you realize what you really are
[2:04:30] in God
[2:04:32] amen that you are a part of a mighty
[2:04:34] Army

[2:04:37] race
