[42:17] brother and sister in this long long
[42:20] journey but father God it's for Life
[42:22] dear God and we thank you for the
[42:24] promise that you gave them and you will
[42:26] certainly keep that promise Lord to them
[42:30] and God we ask your blessing now over
[42:31] each and every heart now in Jesus
[42:33] Christ's name amen amen let's turn in
[42:36] our Bibles as we don't want to want to
[42:40] make sure that we
[42:41] utilize all of our time here this
[42:44] morning on the word as we possibly can
[42:47] I'd like you to turn with me to the book
[42:49] of uh Luke Luke's gospel and chapter 11
[42:53] and verse
[42:54] 34 Luke 11:34
[42:58] to 36 and then we'll be turning back to
[43:01] uh Zechariah 146 and
[43:04] 7 all right the Luke
[43:09] 11:34 Jesus says these words the light
[43:12] of the body is the eye therefore when
[43:15] thine eye is
[43:16] single thy whole body also is full of
[43:21] light as when the bright shining of a
[43:24] candle does give thee light when wait a
[43:27] minute I'm think I'm kind of getting
[43:29] ahead of myself there forgive me let's
[43:31] start over the light of the body is the
[43:33] eye therefore when thy eye is single thy
[43:35] whole body thy whole body also is full
[43:39] of light but when thine eye is evil thy
[43:43] body also is full of
[43:46] Darkness take heed therefore that the
[43:50] light now listen to how he says this
[43:53] it's very peculiar take heed there for
[43:57] that the light which is in thee be not
[44:01] Darkness H almost sounds like
[44:04] a a paradox or something verse 36 If thy
[44:08] whole body therefore be full of light
[44:11] having no part dark the
[44:15] whole shall be full of light as when the
[44:18] bright shining of a candle doth give
[44:20] thee light Zechariah 14 and 7
[44:28] very familiar scripture to all of us I'm
[44:31] sure some of you can quote it without
[44:33] even having a turn there by
[44:38] memory it's it's interesting when we
[44:41] read this where this is found in the
[44:44] circumstances events that are to
[44:47] surround
[44:48] this uh I find that very peculiar that
[44:52] all scripture has a compound
[44:54] meaning and me many times more more than
[44:57] just a compound meeting it can go
[44:59] several different
[45:00] ways that's just that's just the word of
[45:03] God it's uh anyway Zechariah 14:6 and it
[45:07] shall come to pass in that day that the
[45:10] light shall not be clear nor dark but it
[45:14] shall be one day which shall be known to
[45:16] the Lord not day nor night but it shall
[45:20] come to pass that at the evening
[45:23] time it shall be light
[45:27] notice in the evening time when
[45:31] darkness is going to be setting in then
[45:35] there's going to be light doesn't say
[45:37] anything about Darkness it does say in
[45:40] the evening time it shall be light but
[45:44] notice no reference brother will is
[45:47] given to Darkness that's that's very
[45:51] good key point to remember amen you can
[45:54] be seated this morning I want to call
[45:56] this thought
[45:57] light for sight light for Sight let's
[46:01] let's talk about light and read a few
[46:03] scriptures those of you who want to
[46:04] follow along I'm going to move quite
[46:07] quickly through these scriptures so
[46:08] you'll have to really be with me if you
[46:10] want to turn in your Bible Psalm 18 and
[46:13] 28 Psalm 18 and 28 for thou wil light my
[46:17] candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my
[46:21] darkness I'm going to read that again
[46:23] for the Lord will light my candle the
[46:26] Lord my God Amen thank you will
[46:30] Enlighten my darkness I appreciate that
[46:32] amen Psalms 112 and 4 Psalm 112 and
[46:38] 4 unto the
[46:40] upright there ariseth light notice how
[46:44] he says that the psalmist here unto the
[46:47] upright there
[46:50] ariseth so it just isn't just like
[46:52] turning on a light switch but it's a
[46:55] gradual like the sun rising up in the
[46:57] East over from The Horizon the light
[47:01] arises in the darkness he is gracious
[47:03] and full of compassion and righteous now
[47:06] Isaiah 9 and2 Isaiah 9
[47:12] and2 the people that walked in darkness
[47:15] have seen a great
[47:17] light seen seen a great
[47:22] light I boy I could stop right there but
[47:25] I won't it it it's
[47:27] I've got other things to read they that
[47:29] dwell in the land of the shadow of death
[47:32] upon them has the light shine I noticed
[47:36] they're living in the land of the shadow
[47:39] of death but it's not a land of total
[47:43] darkness because if you have a shadow of
[47:45] death that means there's some light
[47:48] there but notice in the middle of the
[47:52] shadow of death that's where light
[47:54] starts to shine well you say I thought
[47:56] light was already there that's true
[47:58] there was but now the light has begun to
[48:03] shine as Jesus will say here in the
[48:06] scriptures if we can get to it in its
[48:13] fullness so years ago sister
[48:17] Heather those of you who have been in
[48:19] biology classes in your school days
[48:23] remember there was a time when men could
[48:26] just
[48:27] look and he he all he had was
[48:32] uh he he had just his natural
[48:36] side he had
[48:38] maybe glasses whenever they come into
[48:41] existence magnifying glasses and so
[48:43] forth and light you know I need a pair
[48:47] of glasses for me to read up
[48:50] here now I could do a fairly good
[48:55] somewhat good but I might miss pronounce
[48:57] my words lose my
[48:58] place without my
[49:02] glasses I can I have trouble reading a
[49:06] newspaper but if I put that
[49:09] newspaper up under a lot of
[49:12] light I'm going to be able to read
[49:15] it so it tells you something now I don't
[49:18] want to get too far ahead of myself here
[49:20] because we do have a lot of ground to
[49:22] cover in a short period of
[49:25] time Isaiah 4 42 and 16 maybe I'll skip
[49:29] some of these uh uh scriptures I wrote
[49:32] down because I am just trying to bring
[49:33] this out to you a few laying a little
[49:36] bit of a foundation here Isaiah 42
[49:39] and16 he says this and I will bring the
[49:41] Blind by way that they know not I will
[49:45] lead them in paths that they have not
[49:47] known I will make Darkness light before
[49:51] them and crooked things straight these
[49:54] things will I do unto them and not
[49:57] forsake
[49:59] them Hallelujah now John
[50:03] 3:19 John 3 and9 let's read what Jesus
[50:08] says about
[50:11] light he says in John
[50:14] 3:19 this is the condemnation that light
[50:17] is coming into the
[50:18] world and Men love Darkness rather than
[50:24] light because they're Deeds were evil
[50:28] now everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[50:31] light neither cometh to the light lest
[50:34] his deeds should be reproved now notice
[50:39] everyone that doeth evil now they're
[50:42] already doing Evil by a
[50:48] light they see evil they hear evil they
[50:54] feel evil and whatever the other senses
[50:57] a taste I guess if you have a taste for
[51:00] alcohol or some other
[51:04] whatever and you're but you're
[51:06] introducing yourself to
[51:09] Darkness and you're a man that smokes a
[51:13] cigarette he's
[51:15] introducing death to
[51:18] himself he's
[51:19] introducing
[51:21] Darkness under which the devil who takes
[51:25] advantage of that he introduces harmful
[51:28] tars and
[51:29] nicotine that go into his lung cells and
[51:33] then the devil takes opportunity that
[51:36] and brings in
[51:37] cancer and ultimately unless he has got
[51:41] a body full of
[51:44] Darkness I'll read a few quotes here
[51:46] later what the prophet says about
[51:48] sickness cancer and all of that and it
[51:51] is actually
[51:53] Darkness he says let's read another
[51:57] scripture John 812 John 8 And1
[52:02] 12 then spake Jesus again unto them
[52:05] saying I am the light of the world he
[52:09] that followeth me shall not walk in
[52:13] darkness but shall have the light of
[52:17] life he shall not walk in darkness but
[52:21] shall have the light of life he says I
[52:23] am come a light I have come a light into
[52:26] the the world that whosoever believeth
[52:27] on me that's John 12:46 sorry John
[52:32] 12:46 I come a light into the world that
[52:35] whosoever believeth on me should not
[52:37] abide in
[52:39] darkness
[52:41] period he he said believeth on me should
[52:44] not abide in
[52:47] darkness Bible says in so many places
[52:49] God is light
[52:52] amen let's see what else we got here
[52:56] now I I
[52:58] also well let's uh I've got a few more
[53:02] scriptures
[53:05] here I I want to uh I Ephesians 1:18 I
[53:10] believe that's the eyes of your
[53:12] understanding being
[53:14] enlightened now there's only one way
[53:17] that that can be brought
[53:20] about now in in in Bible days in the
[53:23] days of the Apostles
[53:26] some people could read and some people
[53:30] couldn't and so Paul when he was
[53:32] preaching to the Gentiles you got to
[53:34] remember the Gentiles don't know
[53:38] Hebrew so I don't know if Paul used an
[53:40] interpreter if God gave him the gift
[53:42] about me it's it's a thought I don't
[53:44] don't Bill not known it but don't know
[53:47] if God gave him a gift to tongues where
[53:49] he spoke it in Hebrew or Aramaic or
[53:52] whatever and they heard it in their own
[53:53] language I don't know but that gift was
[53:56] certain there somebody had that gift he
[54:00] may have used an interpreter I don't
[54:02] know but that's really not anything but
[54:05] you see they're
[54:07] seeing was really
[54:10] hearing because I don't know how many of
[54:12] you know this but many of these New
[54:14] Testament books did not come into
[54:17] existence for for quite some time until
[54:21] the church was already
[54:23] established these letters of Correction
[54:26] the Corinthians and Galatians and
[54:28] Ephesians did not were not
[54:31] accessible to the
[54:33] Believers until many
[54:36] years after the church had already been
[54:39] established so what did they have to go
[54:41] on some of them had copies of the text
[54:44] of the Old Testament the Torah what have
[54:47] you and but for the most part of it you
[54:50] had to take what the man was saying as
[54:54] gospel truth and go God confirmed that
[54:57] word with signs following with all 12
[55:00] the
[55:01] apostles that's all they had to go
[55:04] on now you stop and think about that if
[55:08] you were a cyan from Central Asia from
[55:12] one of the lands of the way up in the
[55:15] lands of the north of Central Asia you
[55:18] didn't know the first thing maybe about
[55:20] Hebrew or maybe you
[55:21] did so what do you have to go on these
[55:25] men stumbling around like drunken men
[55:28] they were they were drunk in the Holy
[55:31] Ghost but they
[55:34] believed and they some of them carried
[55:37] that after they received the Holy Ghost
[55:39] carried that back to their own land
[55:41] without even having this New Testament
[55:44] in
[55:46] existence stop and think about
[55:49] that hearing was
[55:52] believing and God confirmed it
[55:54] supernaturally with signs following
[55:57] prise the
[55:58] Lord I never thought of that myself up
[56:02] until a few years
[56:04] ago when did that new testament actually
[56:07] come together it wasn't even
[56:09] known as a new
[56:14] testament as time went on people started
[56:17] putting it all together the cannon of
[56:19] scripture the different the
[56:21] gospels the writings of John and Peter
[56:24] and Paul the letters and so forth they
[56:27] finally begin to put that all together
[56:29] but that came a long time down the road
[56:32] and remember the Book of Revelation
[56:34] didn't come into existence till many
[56:37] many many years
[56:43] later we're talking about faith a
[56:47] revelation of Faith why there had to be
[56:50] a representation in that soul for them
[56:53] to believe something like that amen come
[56:55] on
[56:57] amen now the Jews had the
[56:59] writings the Jews and no doubt they went
[57:02] down to Corinth they went down to the
[57:04] Ephesus they went to all these places
[57:06] there was
[57:07] Jewish and many of the apostles were
[57:10] they were all
[57:11] Jewish and no doubt they could expound
[57:14] from the Hebrew but they could only
[57:17] give the Old Testament references to
[57:20] Jesus the
[57:22] prophecies and then they could only do
[57:24] it brother Terry by inspiration
[57:28] ation they didn't have bookstores and
[57:31] well where's the prophecies about Jesus
[57:35] I'm not making a mockery but they say
[57:38] where's the Prophecies of the him being
[57:41] beaten and his face was Mar as nor how
[57:44] did they even know that there was no
[57:46] books and theologians or anything like
[57:49] that but by inspiration of preachers who
[57:52] knew those Old Testament scriptures
[57:55] could bring them out said Why That's
[57:56] speaking of
[57:58] Christ what did they have to go on
[58:01] brother
[58:04] Terry they believe by
[58:07] faith that the the God was giv
[58:11] enlightening their eyes to the Old
[58:12] Testament scripture and through the
[58:15] preaching of Paul the
[58:17] Apostle he said If any man preach any
[58:19] other thing and you know what they were
[58:22] scattered so Paul wasn't the pope saying
[58:25] oh okay preacher come on up here and
[58:28] preach beside me before the people and
[58:31] I'm going to put a check mark that
[58:33] you're all
[58:36] right
[58:38] well Paul said If any man preach any
[58:40] other gospel let him be a
[58:44] cursed but Paul didn't go around trying
[58:48] to put his seal of approval on
[58:50] everybody's Ministry
[58:57] he said you got to belong to me I'm the
[59:00] founder of this
[59:02] thing nope he didn't go around telling
[59:04] Matthew Mark Luke or
[59:07] John he didn't go around trying to tell
[59:09] Bartholomew Thomas or any of the rest of
[59:12] them who had their own Ministries but
[59:15] there's one thing about it men of many
[59:18] many different backgrounds Jewish
[59:21] backgrounds go out to all these
[59:23] different places and they're preaching
[59:25] to same thing some of them might not
[59:27] given this slant you see it in the four
[59:29] gospels they say different things about
[59:32] Jesus and don't confuse
[59:35] me they're giving it from their
[59:39] standpoint every one of them 12 go out
[59:42] wherever their Ministry took them some
[59:45] Thomas goes to India Persia
[59:47] wherever rest of them go I Lord I don't
[59:50] know where they
[59:51] went they all had their
[59:53] Ministry but there's one thing for
[59:55] certain when Paul and Peter met they
[59:58] found out they were preaching the C same
[59:59] thing now they had their differences of
[1:00:01] the circumcision and all of that and
[1:00:03] little
[1:00:04] things petty little things that was
[1:00:07] going to happen and God knew that was
[1:00:08] going to happen to start with now I'm
[1:00:11] going to stop right there cuz I need to
[1:00:14] move into some more
[1:00:19] stuff let's
[1:00:21] see I want to read second Peter 1 and9
[1:00:24] if you can pull that up
[1:00:27] and of course Revelation 3:18 most of us
[1:00:30] could quote that
[1:00:31] one second Peter 1:9 and then we're
[1:00:34] going to we're going to move into
[1:00:36] something a little bit
[1:00:41] different I wrote I wrote unto the
[1:00:44] church let's see that's not
[1:00:46] exactly okay second
[1:00:49] peter9 I'm
[1:00:51] sorry second Peter 1 and9 I give you a
[1:00:54] chance to get that up there I really
[1:00:56] appreciate them doing that that that
[1:00:58] takes skill you could hit the wrong key
[1:01:00] and all of that very easily done I can
[1:01:03] imagine I try to do that I'd probably be
[1:01:05] be in Webster's Dictionary
[1:01:08] somewhere second Peter 1:9 but he that
[1:01:11] lacketh these things is
[1:01:13] blind but notice how Peter goes on to
[1:01:17] say this and cannot see a far
[1:01:21] of and hath forgotten that he was
[1:01:24] purched from his old sins now
[1:01:26] what is Peter saying here was this man
[1:01:29] totally Stone
[1:01:31] blind
[1:01:33] no he was blind in the fact that he
[1:01:36] could not see a far off and had
[1:01:39] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:01:43] old sins now this is what we're going to
[1:01:45] be focusing on how did he get into that
[1:01:51] state light for sight
[1:01:56] definition of sight what is the full
[1:01:59] meaning of sight I pulled this I believe
[1:02:02] it's from
[1:02:03] Webster something that is
[1:02:06] seen the process power or function
[1:02:12] of the the function of the five basic
[1:02:15] physical senses by which light
[1:02:19] stimuli received by the eye and
[1:02:23] constructed into a representation of the
[1:02:26] position shape and brightness of objects
[1:02:29] in
[1:02:31] space that sounds a little scientific
[1:02:33] for some of
[1:02:34] us let's break that down a light stimuli
[1:02:40] received by and constructed into a
[1:02:42] representation of the position shape and
[1:02:45] brightness of the eye of objects in
[1:02:49] space for some reason when I printed
[1:02:51] this it cut some of that off I had some
[1:02:53] trouble this morning with my printer
[1:02:56] but it is being able to with light is a
[1:03:01] stimuli that's the thing that provokes
[1:03:04] sight that encourages sight that causes
[1:03:07] sight to happen you got to have
[1:03:11] light or you're not going to
[1:03:14] see you have all the eyes in the world
[1:03:17] all the telescopes you want or most
[1:03:19] powerful microscope in the world but if
[1:03:22] you don't have light it will will
[1:03:26] absolutely not not
[1:03:29] work I wondered about that I wondered
[1:03:32] about that brother
[1:03:33] will I've been I've been meditating on a
[1:03:37] lot of things on
[1:03:41] that in relation to Zechariah 14:7 I've
[1:03:45] got this laying here and I want to go
[1:03:48] ahead and read it as quick as I can I'm
[1:03:51] not sure what sermon I took this from
[1:03:53] but it was either 54 or 55 I didn't get
[1:03:56] the uh Dayton sermon
[1:03:59] title uh printed off with
[1:04:06] it excuse
[1:04:08] me through this time did you ever see a
[1:04:11] day that was dark and drizzle dismal
[1:04:14] like day that's the day that we've lived
[1:04:16] it through well they got enough light
[1:04:18] that they can see that Jesus was the
[1:04:20] Christ he ought to accept him as Savior
[1:04:23] but all of his great powers and things
[1:04:25] that's been h hit from them they can't
[1:04:26] see it all through the
[1:04:30] day are y'all following me is somebody
[1:04:33] going to preach with me this morning we
[1:04:34] just going to sit here like a bump on a
[1:04:37] pickle that's the words of the Prophet
[1:04:38] you want to sit here like a bump on a
[1:04:39] pickle you belong in a jar with pickle
[1:04:45] juice I like eating them but don't we
[1:04:48] don't want to turn into them and I don't
[1:04:50] want to eat you up
[1:04:56] he
[1:04:58] said well we've but all of his great
[1:05:01] Powers they all through the day they
[1:05:04] said the days of Miracles has passed all
[1:05:07] them things they had on the Pentecost
[1:05:09] ceas that's where the Sun was shining
[1:05:11] back there in the East notice how he
[1:05:13] said that that's he said that was past
[1:05:16] tense he's he's simply stating what they
[1:05:19] say 55 paragraph 55 but geographically
[1:05:23] speaking watch the son has done cross
[1:05:26] over now in in other words over the uh
[1:05:30] 12:00 knob so to speak the 12:00 point
[1:05:33] on the clock is crossed
[1:05:36] over by human theology Church
[1:05:39] organization denomination it's darkened
[1:05:41] these things from the Christian's
[1:05:45] eyes darkened not not
[1:05:49] extinguished not completely invisible
[1:05:52] but
[1:05:53] darkened that's why Pentecostals today
[1:05:57] Baptists and so forth certain Baptists
[1:06:00] certain other denominations will stay
[1:06:02] away from Ephesians chapter
[1:06:08] one exactly what the devil wants and
[1:06:11] they fail to recognize it their eyes are
[1:06:17] blinded by the
[1:06:19] devil who is good at causing Confusion
[1:06:23] by the way
[1:06:28] now it's
[1:06:31] darken these things from the Christian
[1:06:33] ey that's right it's darkened Divine
[1:06:35] Healing notice how I said that darken it
[1:06:41] why some of us said been around a long
[1:06:45] time you've had grandparents
[1:06:46] grandparents been back in Pentecost for
[1:06:50] years and and you
[1:06:52] know uh you know some folks hey I'm new
[1:06:56] to this thing too so I'm not above you
[1:07:00] I'm right with
[1:07:02] you
[1:07:04] but some of our grandparents and I I
[1:07:08] speak of brother Monro really over here
[1:07:09] at Short C he told me this and I can
[1:07:12] believe it cuz he told
[1:07:15] me he he got he was a Pentecostal for
[1:07:18] many many years before he come to the
[1:07:21] message and back in 19 and 50 some he
[1:07:26] ran into a man I think it was either 50
[1:07:28] or
[1:07:28] 60 in in the Baltimore area who had been
[1:07:32] under the isua Street
[1:07:35] Ministry and had been a partaker of the
[1:07:38] Gospel at that
[1:07:40] time now many people today there aren't
[1:07:44] that many people living anymore
[1:07:46] that you know has brother gy is for one
[1:07:50] he's up in
[1:07:51] years that's still living that know
[1:07:54] about these things
[1:07:56] but long before brother bram's
[1:07:59] Ministry really started FF Bosworth was
[1:08:03] holding healing campaigns in Pittsburgh
[1:08:06] Pennsylvania in the
[1:08:10] 1930s now I'm saying that because these
[1:08:14] things were still going
[1:08:16] on but it was darkened to the
[1:08:20] denominational and they rejected that
[1:08:22] asusa street Minister I remember Brother
[1:08:24] Louis BV telling
[1:08:26] me because the revelation of the water
[1:08:29] baptism in Jesus Christ's name came to
[1:08:32] the isua street people from a man in K
[1:08:34] called
[1:08:36] mallister and that brother got a
[1:08:38] revelation of the water
[1:08:40] baptism that if the scriptures seem to
[1:08:42] indicate and teach that why aren't we
[1:08:44] doing
[1:08:46] it
[1:08:48] well to make a long story
[1:08:51] short that was preached and many people
[1:08:54] went under the water the second second
[1:08:55] time that was under the isua Street
[1:08:58] Ministry and got re-baptized renouncing
[1:09:01] the Trinity and that created quite a
[1:09:04] stir and that's where many the
[1:09:08] Pentecostals back in the day in 19 in
[1:09:11] the
[1:09:12] 19s you had the formation of the
[1:09:15] Assembly of God Church and the formation
[1:09:18] of the apostolic Oneness Jesus name and
[1:09:21] they parted
[1:09:22] ways some of the Assembly of God when
[1:09:24] they heard about water baptism went and
[1:09:27] got re-baptized in Jesus Christ's name
[1:09:29] become part of the apostolic movement
[1:09:31] others held
[1:09:33] back didn't realize they're putting the
[1:09:35] brakes on
[1:09:39] God see what I'm talking
[1:09:42] about so most people
[1:09:44] today you talk about FF POS words well
[1:09:47] first of
[1:09:48] all I I never heard of it never heard he
[1:09:51] had a Healing Ministry but no doubt in
[1:09:54] Pittsburgh I don't know if any every
[1:09:55] body still be living I'd say there's
[1:09:57] probably a few that yeah my grandfather
[1:10:00] was in those
[1:10:01] meetings and they're probably won
[1:10:03] advance in
[1:10:05] years but because of the darkness that
[1:10:09] set in even after the isua Street
[1:10:12] Ministry that's why men like Charles
[1:10:15] price on the Pentecostal
[1:10:18] Ministry who's he I don't know who he
[1:10:20] is why because a Church of God Assembly
[1:10:24] of God they rejected these
[1:10:27] men they put the quietus on it so to
[1:10:30] speak as brother Bob would
[1:10:33] say they threw a wet blanket on
[1:10:37] it they're scared of it that's
[1:10:40] why because their deeds of unbelief were
[1:10:45] evil the Foolish Heart was dark and they
[1:10:48] couldn't see a fire
[1:10:51] off that's why when brother random came
[1:10:54] even in early 50s preaching things on
[1:10:58] predestination in Florida
[1:11:00] people Church of God man Pentecostal
[1:11:04] Church of God man Pentecostal
[1:11:07] Holiness
[1:11:09] whoa he was bald as a
[1:11:12] lion yet he was a very accommodating man
[1:11:18] in his ministry he reaches out
[1:11:19] trinitarian Oneness tries to pull them
[1:11:22] together amen matter of fact one of the
[1:11:26] great things of brother R's Ministry was
[1:11:28] the fact that Gordon linday who was
[1:11:31] trinitarian I believe in the Assembly of
[1:11:33] God
[1:11:34] man and uh what was his name down in sh
[1:11:41] Port
[1:11:43] yeah Jack Moore was a died in the wool
[1:11:46] Oneness baptized in Jesus Christ name
[1:11:50] preacher but you know what brother
[1:11:52] Brown's Ministry brought two people
[1:11:53] together now I understand and they were
[1:11:56] actually somewhat acquainted with each
[1:11:58] other before brother brandom even came
[1:11:59] on the scene but there was one thing
[1:12:02] that
[1:12:03] cemented their relationship and
[1:12:05] friendship with one another despite the
[1:12:07] fact one trinitarian one Apostolic was
[1:12:10] brother R's
[1:12:11] Ministry you can read it it's there go
[1:12:14] back and read those books
[1:12:18] again
[1:12:20] amen he says it darkened the Divine
[1:12:23] Healing it's darkened the power of God
[1:12:24] it darkened all gifts they applied it
[1:12:27] back there where the Sun was shining
[1:12:28] they applied it back there and what did
[1:12:30] it do it caused clouds of unbelief to
[1:12:32] roll in the sun was still shining now
[1:12:35] God knew this was all going to
[1:12:39] come I think many times we got to be
[1:12:42] careful how we preach these
[1:12:44] things we we almost make it look that
[1:12:47] the Church of thy Tyra and the Church
[1:12:50] of all these the seven Church ages you
[1:12:53] know the Middle Ages there the middle
[1:12:56] Church ages that irus
[1:12:59] Columba that there was much going on
[1:13:02] there but I beg to differ with
[1:13:04] you guess what in the middle of that
[1:13:07] pyramid like City that's going to come
[1:13:10] down out of Heaven there's going to be
[1:13:12] one level designated for the thyroid
[1:13:15] thyroid Church age
[1:13:19] Believers history doesn't say a whole
[1:13:21] lot about him the reason being said is
[1:13:23] just what I told you before
[1:13:25] the current wave of that time was to
[1:13:29] smother the news of spiritual events yes
[1:13:33] they happened but the Catholic church
[1:13:35] was right there to stifle IE any
[1:13:39] news and they kill it dead in its tracks
[1:13:43] if they could and they did and they
[1:13:44] burnt people at the state and that made
[1:13:47] more
[1:13:48] headlines when they were burning people
[1:13:50] at the Stak it was a big show of
[1:13:52] forest just like the death does today
[1:13:57] create a big show of force yet God is
[1:14:00] over here miraculously many and women
[1:14:03] are serving God living Godly lives
[1:14:06] seeing the hand of Miracles move and the
[1:14:09] church stifled
[1:14:11] that they didn't want that get out but
[1:14:14] they couldn't stop
[1:14:19] God
[1:14:21] now that was part there the plan of
[1:14:31] God it's going to be a lot
[1:14:34] of
[1:14:36] palaces on the level of that
[1:14:39] pyramid for the th retiring Church
[1:14:42] age cuz they were
[1:14:45] there but we think oh it's such a dark
[1:14:48] time
[1:14:50] oh politically
[1:14:53] religiously morally
[1:14:56] it
[1:14:58] was but there was light in
[1:15:02] Goan it was light to that th entire
[1:15:04] church AE believer I'll show it I I
[1:15:07] already showed it to
[1:15:10] you that's why he that's why that
[1:15:13] Preacher Brother Louie was telling me he
[1:15:15] come in there preaching baptism in Jesus
[1:15:17] Christ's name and they shot up down in
[1:15:21] Tennessee I don't know what year that
[1:15:23] was brother Terry but Brother Lou told
[1:15:25] me that they killed that man shot into
[1:15:28] the church where he was at and killed
[1:15:32] him cuz he believed in a water
[1:15:35] baptism in Jesus Christ name he was
[1:15:37] preaching think of that do you see
[1:15:41] now how Darkness likes to try to smother
[1:15:44] these things
[1:15:47] now brother Bram goes on to say here it
[1:15:49] is but the prophet it's darkened all the
[1:15:52] giftes they have applied it back there
[1:15:53] where the Sun was shining here is but
[1:15:55] the prophet said it shall be light in
[1:15:57] the evening time the sun rises in the
[1:16:00] East it sets in the west we are the
[1:16:02] Western People Western Hemisphere we're
[1:16:04] here in the
[1:16:05] west and as it Rose over y in the
[1:16:08] beginning was showed that the same holy
[1:16:10] spirit that fell on the day of
[1:16:12] Pentecost and the things accompanied in
[1:16:14] the church there very things happened
[1:16:15] back there in the last days in the last
[1:16:17] 20 or 30 years has fell here in the
[1:16:19] Western World showing the same signs
[1:16:22] here that it get back there it'll be
[1:16:24] light in the evening time by the
[1:16:26] way I'll just stop right there by the
[1:16:29] way you know FF Bosworth had both of his
[1:16:31] wrists broken for preaching Divine
[1:16:33] Healing down in
[1:16:35] Texas was that
[1:16:38] Christian that's a force of Darkness to
[1:16:42] stifle even a man who was preaching
[1:16:46] Divine Healing back in the early early
[1:16:48] years of the 19th
[1:16:52] century just thought of that done alone
[1:16:56] showing a s it'll be light in the
[1:16:58] evening time the clouds broke back
[1:17:01] denominations are broke he says
[1:17:03] hallelujah and the people has entered
[1:17:04] into the baptism of the holy spirit with
[1:17:07] signs and wonders just like they did at
[1:17:08] the beginning it'll be light in the
[1:17:11] evening
[1:17:12] time
[1:17:14] now I hope you all don't
[1:17:17] mind if you do shut your
[1:17:23] ears Zechariah 146 and
[1:17:26] 7 I wondered about this for a long
[1:17:30] time I wondered about
[1:17:34] this where did that come from where did
[1:17:37] the thought brother brand mentions this
[1:17:39] back in Way Way Back in 1949 by the way
[1:17:44] first time he ever mentioned
[1:17:49] it
[1:17:50] and it's he mentions it about 170 some
[1:17:54] times plus plus or minus probably plus
[1:17:57] more times throughout the
[1:17:59] message when I was growing up before I
[1:18:03] God enlightened me to the
[1:18:05] message used to listen to an Apostolic
[1:18:08] preacher dad turn him on every Sunday
[1:18:09] morning I don't know why he turned them
[1:18:11] on if he didn't want to go
[1:18:13] there and they started off the radio
[1:18:15] program with that old song it shall be
[1:18:17] light in the evening time way to you
[1:18:21] know your black choir singing you can
[1:18:23] imagine boy they know how to sing it the
[1:18:26] way to Glory you will surely find in the
[1:18:30] Waterway is the light today baptized in
[1:18:35] Jesus name young and old on and on every
[1:18:40] Sunday morning they started broadcast
[1:18:42] like
[1:18:43] that for one hour Bishop es mile Shelton
[1:18:47] used to be Bishop SCC Johnson in
[1:18:49] Philadelphia Pennsylvania who started
[1:18:51] that
[1:18:53] movement so uh you know this come into
[1:18:56] play later
[1:18:57] on thought
[1:18:59] now thought where who where I mean I ask
[1:19:04] you
[1:19:06] consider come on brothers and sisters
[1:19:08] preach with
[1:19:09] me if you don't understand something I
[1:19:13] I'll say okay you don't I don't have to
[1:19:15] ask you to say
[1:19:18] Amen but he's talking about near the end
[1:19:21] of the tribulation period in Zachariah
[1:19:25] if you study
[1:19:26] that Jerusalem is going to be
[1:19:29] taken the hous is rifled and the women
[1:19:33] ravished you know I read that here
[1:19:35] brother Terry and I thought oh Lord
[1:19:37] Jesus I I don't want to see that happen
[1:19:41] Israel's been through so
[1:19:43] much but the last he said then he said
[1:19:45] they'll flee over into the valley of
[1:19:48] azil and there's going to be Jesus will
[1:19:50] return his feet shall sand on the Mount
[1:19:52] of Olives one part of the mountain move
[1:19:54] off this way in another part of the
[1:19:55] mountain and he said they're going to
[1:19:57] flee like there's going to be survivors
[1:19:59] he said they're going to carry some off
[1:20:01] into
[1:20:02] captivity they're going to kill people
[1:20:04] they're going to do all these terrible
[1:20:06] terrible things to people but he said
[1:20:08] there's going to be a Remnant he said
[1:20:10] you'll run like you did in the days of
[1:20:12] Uzziah the king of the earthquake over
[1:20:15] into the land or the valley of
[1:20:17] AEL for
[1:20:19] safety and then it says then the Lord
[1:20:22] God will go to fight against those
[1:20:26] Nations who have come against
[1:20:29] Jerusalem and there while they stand on
[1:20:31] their feet their flesh will consume away
[1:20:34] now going back to Zechariah 14:6 let's
[1:20:38] just stop with
[1:20:39] that it's interesting he
[1:20:43] deposited that thought and no doubt that
[1:20:48] will mean something to the Jews at that
[1:20:51] time no doubt in the coming days where
[1:20:55] those two ministries of the prophets
[1:20:57] they're going to read that and apply
[1:20:59] that to their
[1:21:03] day it really
[1:21:06] weak I kind of expected
[1:21:09] that well I stand to be corrected if I'm
[1:21:13] wrong
[1:21:15] but somebody picked up the
[1:21:19] inspiration this also applies to this
[1:21:22] day of the Gentiles
[1:21:27] we to read Benson's
[1:21:29] commentary Zechariah 14 and6 and 7
[1:21:33] listen how he words this this is a man
[1:21:34] who don't even believe I don't know I
[1:21:36] don't know when this was written I I
[1:21:38] take this back long time
[1:21:43] ago he says this it shall come to pass
[1:21:46] in that day namely when the Lord shall
[1:21:49] come forth to fight against the enemies
[1:21:51] of his
[1:21:52] church the Nations that fought against
[1:21:54] Jerusalem as foretold Zechariah
[1:21:57] 14:3 or in that day when he shall come
[1:22:00] to convert and restore the Jews has
[1:22:03] spread his gospel throughout all the
[1:22:04] world now some of this this man needs
[1:22:07] prophetic
[1:22:08] correction what he wrote Because I don't
[1:22:11] quite agree with all of
[1:22:12] this and restore the Jews spread his
[1:22:16] gospel throughout all the world the
[1:22:17] light namely of knowledge Holiness
[1:22:20] happiness in his church shall not namely
[1:22:23] at first be clear
[1:22:26] like that of the perfect day nor dark as
[1:22:30] perfect night but shall be kind of a
[1:22:35] Twilight a mixture of light and
[1:22:39] darkness of knowledge and
[1:22:42] ignorance as of as to Divine things of
[1:22:46] Hol Holiness and
[1:22:48] sin of happiness and
[1:22:51] misery or prosperity and adversity but
[1:22:54] it shall be one
[1:22:56] day one continued day there shall be
[1:23:02] no setting of the sun to make it quite
[1:23:08] night but God will invariably pursue the
[1:23:11] end that he has in
[1:23:14] View and always act in order to it
[1:23:19] namely the full salvation of a spiritual
[1:23:23] Jerusalem remember that we Are Spiritual
[1:23:26] Jerusalem which shall be the events of
[1:23:29] it he will continually take notice of
[1:23:31] them and Order and dispose of all the
[1:23:34] dispose of all for the best according to
[1:23:37] the counsel of his own
[1:23:39] will goes on to say when the natural
[1:23:42] Days
[1:23:43] end and when perhaps the shades of the
[1:23:46] evening may appear to be coming on there
[1:23:49] may be an apprehension of returning
[1:23:52] Darkness
[1:23:53] listen if it shall be
[1:23:56] light this spiritual day shall be full
[1:23:59] of light and
[1:24:01] Glory he quotes Isaiah 488 Isaiah 161
[1:24:05] 19-
[1:24:06] 21 Mr Scott considers these verses as
[1:24:11] containing a compendious prophecy of the
[1:24:14] state of the
[1:24:15] church from its establishment in the
[1:24:18] apostles days to those glorious
[1:24:21] times which are expected
[1:24:24] a prophecy foretelling for a long season
[1:24:28] the light would neither be clear nor
[1:24:34] dark it would be greatly
[1:24:37] obscured listen we all know what that
[1:24:41] means by
[1:24:44] ignorance
[1:24:46] heresy
[1:24:48] Superstition idolatry yet not
[1:24:52] holy exting
[1:24:57] which side are you living
[1:25:04] on and the
[1:25:07] consolation wait a
[1:25:11] minute my printer was acting up this
[1:25:13] morning printed fine print on me and I
[1:25:15] don't know what happened yet not wholly
[1:25:17] extinguished and the state of the church
[1:25:20] would be
[1:25:21] much deformed
[1:25:25] where did I hear that one before Satan
[1:25:28] is a
[1:25:30] deformer deformed by sin and
[1:25:33] calamities yet some
[1:25:41] Holiness yet some Holiness and
[1:25:44] consolation would be found this period
[1:25:47] could neither be called a clear Bright
[1:25:49] Day
[1:25:50] cheered and illumined by The Shining of
[1:25:53] a summer Sun nor would it be dark as if
[1:25:57] the sun were set or
[1:26:00] totally eclipsed but would contain a
[1:26:03] great mixture of Truth and error listen
[1:26:07] to that of Holiness and sin of
[1:26:12] happiness and misery yet it would form
[1:26:15] one day and never be interrupted by a
[1:26:17] night of total
[1:26:19] darkness it would also be known unto the
[1:26:22] Lord as a degree of it
[1:26:25] light and the term of its
[1:26:28] continuance and he would watch over and
[1:26:31] take care of he's causing people all the
[1:26:34] time of
[1:26:37] it he's saying it better than I could
[1:26:40] say
[1:26:42] it but his people would hardly know
[1:26:45] whether to call it day or
[1:26:49] night or a compound of
[1:26:52] both yet at length toward the evening of
[1:26:54] the world the son of
[1:26:56] righteousness would break forth and
[1:26:59] shine with unclouded
[1:27:03] Splendor it has
[1:27:08] arrived to those of you who had your
[1:27:11] eyes open and being enlightened by the
[1:27:13] Holy Ghost the evening
[1:27:16] time is making history
[1:27:21] now just unclouded splendor dispelling
[1:27:25] the Gloom brother ter of
[1:27:27] ignorance heresy idolatry Superstition
[1:27:31] Illuminating the church and the Earth
[1:27:33] with knowledge righteousness peace and
[1:27:40] consolation let the devil pull all the
[1:27:42] night shades he wants let the devil turn
[1:27:46] off all the lights he wants there is a
[1:27:48] man here who has already turned on the
[1:27:51] light
[1:27:54] right the devil might have trying to
[1:27:56] turn the light off on us but God's
[1:27:58] turning the light back on
[1:28:00] again why ain't the rest of the world in
[1:28:03] light because their deeds are
[1:28:06] evil they ain't like a cloudy
[1:28:10] day you don't like a cloudy day I don't
[1:28:13] like a cloudy day but they like it
[1:28:16] because it's a preparation of for total
[1:28:20] darkness the tribulation
[1:28:23] period and
[1:28:25] ultimately sadly the regions the
[1:28:39] damed Putin's patience is going to run
[1:28:42] out one of these
[1:28:46] days I had I'm going to stop right here
[1:28:49] and say something I'm going to move
[1:28:51] on but I had a little bit of respect for
[1:28:54] for
[1:28:55] France I think you know where I'm going
[1:28:57] with
[1:29:02] that I always think the majority of the
[1:29:04] people they don't want that
[1:29:07] trash but to think of
[1:29:10] it the way they portrayed that Lord's
[1:29:14] Supper
[1:29:16] father I hate to say it those poor souls
[1:29:19] are lost they are groping in darkness
[1:29:22] and the people that are all that are
[1:29:25] just as
[1:29:30] guilty he's got he's got a bomb a
[1:29:32] missile Warhead with their name on it
[1:29:35] you wonder why brother R said that I'll
[1:29:37] tell you why in World War II they write
[1:29:40] things on those bombs the the pilots and
[1:29:43] so forth of those planes this one's for
[1:29:45] Berlin this one's for Hitler this one's
[1:29:48] for the SS this that's where this
[1:29:52] thought comes he's got a bomb with your
[1:29:54] name on at
[1:30:00] Louisville I hardly think at the end of
[1:30:03] all of that there's even going to be a
[1:30:05] rush
[1:30:07] here because it's going to be a suicidal
[1:30:09] move on their part and that man out
[1:30:13] there in the law Salos told me some
[1:30:15] years ago he said yeah he said I believe
[1:30:18] what brother R said they're going to
[1:30:19] throw it at us and he said we'll be a
[1:30:21] sming pile of debris but he said I can
[1:30:24] assure you there's going to be a lot of
[1:30:26] stuff go
[1:30:28] back it's not going to be a win-win situ
[1:30:31] it's not going to be a win and loser
[1:30:33] situation it's going to mean an
[1:30:35] Annihilation it'll be done out of spite
[1:30:37] and out of hate it'll be done out of
[1:30:39] anger and devil anointing and fulfilling
[1:30:43] the prophecy of the word of the
[1:30:46] Lord the Earth won't be a fit Place once
[1:30:48] that happens that's the end that's
[1:30:51] setting up for the Millennium the Earth
[1:30:53] ruptures volcanic activity Colorado is
[1:30:56] sitting on a time bomb out there right
[1:30:58] now with volcanic they say that thing
[1:31:00] could blow and when it does it's going
[1:31:02] to affect the entire Continental North
[1:31:05] America that volcano it'll be an
[1:31:08] explosion unlike these bombs can loosen
[1:31:10] that crust up and penetrate on down
[1:31:12] there there's coming stuff that's a 100
[1:31:15] times stronger than what was dropped on
[1:31:21] Nagasaki well I just had to say that I
[1:31:23] kill some of my time
[1:31:27] sorry the
[1:31:30] song I wrote to you here on Benson's
[1:31:33] commentary and know that there's others
[1:31:35] there's others that's not just there's
[1:31:37] others and that was that was wrote many
[1:31:40] Benson did his commentary and the rest
[1:31:42] of them did their commentary many many
[1:31:43] years ago some back in the 1800s by the
[1:31:46] way throw that out there
[1:31:49] too well anyway it means something to me
[1:31:53] that's right
[1:31:54] it it sure does I do want to mention
[1:31:57] this the song where did the song come
[1:31:59] from to my knowledge I don't we don't
[1:32:03] know who the writer who pinned the
[1:32:06] words we do know according to
[1:32:09] history Man by the name of GT
[1:32:14] Haywood I I know he lived out of our
[1:32:18] time frame one of the early Pentecostals
[1:32:21] among the African African Brothers and
[1:32:24] sisters of black
[1:32:25] people man by the name of GT Haywood was
[1:32:28] preaching Apostolic Oneness Doctrine
[1:32:31] Pentecostal to his church down y
[1:32:35] Tennessee I believe it was some sister
[1:32:38] got the inspiration and I I would say
[1:32:41] venture to say it was probably from him
[1:32:42] preaching Zechariah 14:6 and
[1:32:46] 7 and that sister penda words I don't
[1:32:49] know if you knew
[1:32:51] this but that sister penda those words
[1:32:55] and the verses to it you don't know the
[1:32:58] name she was a member of his
[1:33:00] congregation that's all we know GT
[1:33:03] Haywood you can look you can research GT
[1:33:05] Haywood man of God man of God by the way
[1:33:09] I'll just stop and say this because we
[1:33:10] don't give no credit many times because
[1:33:13] we get to thinking that the bride age is
[1:33:15] the only people in that that's going to
[1:33:17] be living in there in that level of the
[1:33:19] new city you got it all wrong there's
[1:33:22] going to be penic Apostles from isua
[1:33:24] Street FF pawor from the 1930s and all
[1:33:28] these other ministers are going to be
[1:33:30] living in that new
[1:33:32] city because there were the part of the
[1:33:34] pride of the leot dean Church whether
[1:33:36] you want to believe that or not we don't
[1:33:38] often mention that we get too narrow
[1:33:40] minded and ttle minded the first thing
[1:33:42] you know we convey the wrong thought to
[1:33:47] people they weren't all false anointed
[1:33:51] ones many Believers God saw to it that
[1:33:54] there was
[1:33:55] Believers that's why I said th TI Church
[1:33:58] AG there were Believers
[1:34:08] there it's really tell
[1:34:13] you God help
[1:34:18] us yeah there'll be Believers
[1:34:21] there brother Brown said there's even
[1:34:23] going to be people there I don't know
[1:34:25] where they're going to come up that he
[1:34:27] led to the Lord Jesus but they never
[1:34:29] accepted this
[1:34:31] message as far as I know I've been
[1:34:33] trying to friend Bert Call's
[1:34:36] obituary way up yonder in New England
[1:34:39] and still looking forward I think I may
[1:34:41] have stumble on where where he passed
[1:34:44] away but brother Bram said he got saved
[1:34:46] out there on a snow
[1:34:48] bank become a Baptist in a I believe it
[1:34:51] was a deacon or something in a bapti
[1:34:53] church if I'm not don't have that right
[1:34:57] but that's what he
[1:34:58] said now he got
[1:35:03] saved
[1:35:05] hello he's probably one of them John
[1:35:08] 3:16 people
[1:35:10] hello aren't you glad aren't you
[1:35:15] glad I
[1:35:16] am that's why I say when we get over

[1:35:20] you're going to see out there in that
[1:35:22] new new Earth you're going to be
[1:35:24] surprised who you see out there that
[1:35:26] Paul said watched out for you and stood
[1:35:28] for you when it looked like the tables
[1:35:29] were turned against you he'll be
[1:35:33] there that woman in the neighborhood
[1:35:35] that looked after you when you didn't
[1:35:36] have a penny to your name and and gave
[1:35:39] you Grace on your rent payments and all
[1:35:41] of that and she was good to
[1:35:44] you very good chance she'll be
[1:35:47] there aren't you

[1:36:01] that's the only expression that they'll
[1:36:03] ever see sister
[1:36:08] Alice the god knew God knew this was
[1:36:11] going to happen God it didn't take God
[1:36:13] by surprise that after ireneus the
[1:36:16] Martin there was going to come a grade
[1:36:18] falling
[1:36:19] away he knew it all along that didn't
[1:36:23] just helpen per se God lost control of
[1:36:26] his program he never lost control of his
[1:36:28] program God knew it was going to go that
[1:36:30] way that's why in the beginning God knew
[1:36:33] that he was going to eat the apple just
[1:36:36] saying it met
[1:36:39] metaphorically he knew that all along he
[1:36:41] let it happen to prove he's a
[1:36:48] savior except the corn of weat wide
[1:36:51] brother randam say they were fed to the
[1:36:52] lies they were thrown into their
[1:36:54] Arenas Savage beasts store them from
[1:36:57] limb to limb and they become dung on the
[1:37:00] face of the Earth as being consumed by
[1:37:02] the
[1:37:03] Beast why except the corn of wheat fall
[1:37:07] brother Ram said in a b of
[1:37:11] theone he knew it was going to happen
[1:37:15] and it was BL that
[1:37:19] way I don't feel sorry for Joon of Arc
[1:37:29] I
[1:37:31] don't I don't feel sorry
[1:37:34] for all these other people got burned at
[1:37:36] the
[1:37:38] steak see that sounds
[1:37:43] cruel humanly speaking if IID lived in
[1:37:47] yeah but with the mind of
[1:37:51] God I feel sorry
[1:37:54] for the people that did it for to
[1:37:57] them I feel sorry for the
[1:38:00] Pope the popes who ordered their
[1:38:03] Annihilation the Pope that ordered the
[1:38:06] Inquisition in Spain that killed
[1:38:09] Christians and Jews in the Aaron
[1:38:13] Maiden Woman made of
[1:38:16] spikes and in the darkness the person
[1:38:19] walked into it it was spring-loaded they
[1:38:22] didn't know until it was too late those
[1:38:24] spikes come together and that thing
[1:38:26] collapsed like a spring and literally
[1:38:29] penetrated and killed the person that
[1:38:30] walked into it called the Aaron
[1:38:35] Maiden
[1:38:37] Church devil
[1:38:39] Church
[1:38:42] Darkness but God H his people God knew
[1:38:45] it all along didn't take him by surprise
[1:38:48] didn't take God surprise they put Isaiah
[1:38:50] in a log and sought him into
[1:38:55] too that was
[1:38:57] awful I mean that was aw you look at the
[1:39:01] sister Heather look at the book of
[1:39:02] Isaiah you all know the prophecies that
[1:39:05] Isaiah
[1:39:10] pinned what a gracious man his noble
[1:39:15] character and I I feel bad I can't
[1:39:18] imagine a rough and those saws aren't
[1:39:21] fine cutting saws like they
[1:39:24] today as it literally ripped his
[1:39:27] bowels out of his body and he's bleed
[1:39:30] massive bleeding until the life finally
[1:39:33] leaves his body and it it literally cut
[1:39:36] him in
[1:39:40] half I feel sorry for the ones that did
[1:39:45] it if they never
[1:39:48] repented they're the
[1:39:50] ones I feel sorry for I'm running out of
[1:39:53] time but I'll say this
[1:39:56] too brother Ram said unless you have
[1:39:59] perfect love you'll never get there and
[1:40:01] unless you feel sorry for Adolf Hitler
[1:40:04] in the regions of the Damned and feel
[1:40:07] badly for him you're not a candidate to
[1:40:11] enter the presence of the Lord over
[1:40:12] there in
[1:40:14] heaven or walk on streets of gold
[1:40:16] because you've got to have character of
[1:40:18] gold to walk on streets of gold buy a
[1:40:22] meat what did he say and Le see gold as
[1:40:25] of tried in the fire he rebuked them he
[1:40:28] said you're blind naked
[1:40:31] miserable you have many riches but your
[1:40:34] riches you allow your love your riches
[1:40:38] more than you love me and that's why
[1:40:41] you're blind that's why pastors won't
[1:40:45] receive this message in the denomination
[1:40:47] they know it's true but it's going to
[1:40:49] cost them their
[1:40:51] riches cost them their pension their
[1:40:53] retirement
[1:40:55] pension all those years of studying in
[1:40:58] school they think go down the
[1:41:01] drain well well well praise
[1:41:06] God where are
[1:41:09] we brother Bram says in the message
[1:41:12] Redemption by
[1:41:18] power I thought I brought my phone up
[1:41:20] here I need a
[1:41:22] clock I really
[1:41:28] do anyway so many just wave when I
[1:41:38] get I want to
[1:41:41] read
[1:41:42] 1954 brother Brown says Redemption by
[1:41:45] power all right put on your shock proof
[1:41:48] jackets here it comes look every man
[1:41:52] that rejects light goes blind and walks
[1:41:55] in darkness because you don't accept
[1:42:01] light did you hear how he said that yeah
[1:42:06] look every man that rejects light goes
[1:42:11] blind so he's got
[1:42:14] sight and then he goes blind because he
[1:42:16] rejects
[1:42:18] it what did what did Brother say the
[1:42:21] light that you have will be taken from
[1:42:26] you says put on your shockproof jackets
[1:42:29] here it
[1:42:32] comes those who rejected light receive
[1:42:35] Darkness now I'm only about halfway
[1:42:38] through here I've got a lot more but I'm
[1:42:41] going to have to find a place to
[1:42:44] helicopter out of here as brother juel
[1:42:47] used to
[1:42:51] say I was going to mention
[1:42:57] this the the vision of sight the sense
[1:43:01] of
[1:43:05] sight sister
[1:43:08] Faith you
[1:43:12] raise uh
[1:43:15] dogs and puppies and so forth like
[1:43:20] that so you're you're you're very
[1:43:22] familiar with these
[1:43:26] things when the puppies are
[1:43:29] born what I remember correct me if I'm
[1:43:32] wrong I'll give you that permission
[1:43:34] sister just say it no no no no
[1:43:36] no they can't see they got their eyes
[1:43:39] closed is't that
[1:43:40] right
[1:43:43] okay so brother Bram I like what brother
[1:43:46] Shawn was preaching here the other night
[1:43:48] and he brother brandom I've got quotes
[1:43:51] up here and I'll not get to him because
[1:43:52] we were running out of
[1:43:54] time but he said for the last 2,000
[1:43:57] years well I'm paraphrasing that but for
[1:43:59] the last he said we probed at these
[1:44:03] things and sometimes got everything
[1:44:05] confused and then he says in one other
[1:44:07] quote he says we actually did pretty
[1:44:09] good and I I've got I've got an
[1:44:11] explanation for both of those
[1:44:13] statements I'm not trying to explain the
[1:44:16] prophet but I want to break that down to
[1:44:19] you now Jesus said
[1:44:23] Moses gave you a writing a divorcement
[1:44:28] h but because of the hardness of your
[1:44:32] heart he done that but from the
[1:44:36] beginning it was not
[1:44:40] so now sister Faith you know and the
[1:44:42] rest of all of you pet owners have
[1:44:45] mothers uh I love puppies my goodness
[1:44:49] some of them German shepherd pups you
[1:44:51] that one was already promised I had it
[1:44:53] was hard for me to offer her up some big
[1:44:55] money that thing was so cute oh don't
[1:44:59] your heart melt those of you who like
[1:45:01] pets you my heart melts I remember
[1:45:03] picking up little puppies back at the
[1:45:05] farm years ago and the mother anxiously
[1:45:07] sometimes she let out a growl because
[1:45:09] she wasn't sure what you were going to
[1:45:10] do with
[1:45:11] them oh my it just melt my
[1:45:17] heart she's there checking them all
[1:45:20] out mother's love
[1:45:24] and so
[1:45:26] anyway uh they're born they can't see
[1:45:30] they're born with their eyes
[1:45:32] closed so they're
[1:45:35] probing so that little mama mother dog
[1:45:39] or cat or
[1:45:41] whatever well cats I think are born
[1:45:43] blind too I think they're they can't see
[1:45:45] if I'm not
[1:45:47] mistaken I think that's right I may be
[1:45:49] wrong but anyway puppies
[1:45:55] they the mother will lay herself
[1:45:59] out to where they find the glands the
[1:46:03] nipples of the glands on the
[1:46:05] teeths where she's got mother's
[1:46:08] milk and they by
[1:46:12] Instinct it's in
[1:46:14] them it's part of their genetics they
[1:46:18] can't
[1:46:19] see but they start probing something
[1:46:22] deep down there's a deep resonating to
[1:46:26] the Deep to find the teachs and
[1:46:32] nurse but they don't see but they probe
[1:46:35] they probe they might run into hair they
[1:46:37] might ran into feet might even run into
[1:46:39] a tail might run into each other but
[1:46:44] ultimately they all
[1:46:46] find I like what brother randam said
[1:46:48] he's
[1:46:50] Jehovah uh the double breasted one
[1:46:52] you're
[1:46:55] nursing I thank God for those
[1:46:58] stages it was all part of our Christian
[1:47:00] walk I thank God for the early ages when
[1:47:03] all they could do was probe but God saw
[1:47:06] to it there is light there for you and
[1:47:09] I'll help you get there and they got
[1:47:12] there no matter how dark it got there
[1:47:15] was still light and God saw to it said
[1:47:18] see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
[1:47:21] you're not going to take all the light
[1:47:22] away
[1:47:24] but I'll prove that I'll get brother
[1:47:27] will every one of my
[1:47:29] children God didn't miss a one in the th
[1:47:32] tiing
[1:47:33] age not a
[1:47:36] one didn't matter how
[1:47:38] many you know I could tell you stories
[1:47:41] but I won't go into
[1:47:42] that you read their history there's
[1:47:44] Histories on all of that how they stood
[1:47:47] in different
[1:47:49] places now
[1:47:55] I wondered about something for
[1:48:00] years down in the
[1:48:03] caves of the
[1:48:05] earth
[1:48:07] total pitch black
[1:48:12] darkness cats I got a bunch of
[1:48:16] them God has enabled a cat plus other
[1:48:20] animals owls
[1:48:23] Birds who are creatures of the night
[1:48:25] nothing against that brother random
[1:48:28] types that spiritual wicked things evil
[1:48:32] things C crawl around prowl around at
[1:48:36] night crawl around at night to bite
[1:48:39] people spiders and so forth demons
[1:48:43] typing demons hello notice the
[1:48:47] environment that they like to Carl
[1:48:49] around and do you got that kind of
[1:48:51] environment in your mind
[1:48:54] that's why demons feel so welcome to
[1:48:56] come into some of our minds because we
[1:48:58] got so much darkness in our
[1:49:02] minds
[1:49:05] wooo so if your eye is single as Jesus
[1:49:08] said you go might have a double eye
[1:49:10] you're taking all you but I like I like
[1:49:13] to walk in a nons surrendered State
[1:49:15] before the Lord guess what you're
[1:49:18] letting a lot of darkness in and I can
[1:49:19] prove to you that you're looking at
[1:49:21] Darkness you say looking at Darkness
[1:49:25] yes because all those things that take
[1:49:28] us away from God's word lead us to total
[1:49:31] darkness and will'll cause you to go
[1:49:35] blind so down in these M
[1:49:38] shafts mind's caves can catch
[1:49:45] sea study notice what I
[1:49:48] said from the beginning
[1:49:52] it takes light for the eye to
[1:49:55] operate it takes light the seven Church
[1:49:59] ages it was a valley of the shadow of
[1:50:02] death now but there was still light
[1:50:06] there but where there is total darkness
[1:50:10] outer Darkness think of it that
[1:50:13] way kid a cat an animal now typing
[1:50:18] natural to back to the spiritual can a
[1:50:20] cat see in a pitch black
[1:50:27] cave well I thought maybe they could too
[1:50:31] the answer is
[1:50:38] no uh cut the stars of the night natural
[1:50:43] lighting the stars of the night the moon
[1:50:46] of the night illuminate there's enough a
[1:50:49] light that when a cat looks out there
[1:50:53] what they probably see just to give you
[1:50:54] some idea is like a cloudy day for
[1:50:57] us what they see at night now is it 100%
[1:51:02] what they see during the day
[1:51:04] no but it's very very good that's why
[1:51:09] Jaguars tigers lions hunt at night their
[1:51:13] their Vision it's just like a cloudy day
[1:51:15] they're putting it that way to you
[1:51:17] that's how they find their
[1:51:19] prey ows they oh my they got a l
[1:51:23] whoa that's why they can do what they do
[1:51:26] at
[1:51:28] night I'm saying this so what happened
[1:51:32] to the little fish you
[1:51:34] children in the animal kingdom what
[1:51:37] happened to the little fish that got
[1:51:40] trapped down there in that cave in that
[1:51:44] Lake of water that pool of water that
[1:51:46] stream of water and there's no
[1:51:50] light from the beginning
[1:51:53] he had
[1:51:54] eyes and he still has
[1:51:58] eyes but he went
[1:52:01] blind from the
[1:52:04] beginning it was not
[1:52:08] so if there's an eye then an eye is
[1:52:12] there to
[1:52:14] see now God through his
[1:52:17] Mercy I could say a whole lot more about
[1:52:19] the human body there's some things that
[1:52:21] changed I think we didn't have to deal
[1:52:23] with before the fall I won't get into
[1:52:26] that somebody might get the wrong
[1:52:31] idea but I can tell you
[1:52:36] this that little fish Lost His sight and
[1:52:38] the cat can't see in the dark that's why
[1:52:41] he's got
[1:52:42] whiskers you know that don't ever cut
[1:52:45] him that's a keep him from going into a
[1:52:47] hole that he can't get out of he can
[1:52:50] really wriggle wriggle in
[1:52:53] swiggle to get in a tight spot get it
[1:52:56] I've seen them crawl out of stuff my
[1:52:58] Lord they like their bodies turn turns
[1:53:01] into water and they come out the other
[1:53:03] side it's like one of them things
[1:53:05] they'll make a way they'll find a way
[1:53:08] and make
[1:53:09] it they get scared boy I tell you one to
[1:53:13] who they're
[1:53:16] fast
[1:53:18] anyway he had sight it one time but
[1:53:21] because of total darkness and Paul
[1:53:24] brings this out why you let your your
[1:53:28] feeble hands hang down he said you need
[1:53:31] to raise them up
[1:53:34] exercise exercise Your Eyes by looking
[1:53:37] at the gospel of light in the evening
[1:53:40] time the light has come don't let this
[1:53:44] world become your focus even of your
[1:53:47] natural eye but read and
[1:53:50] listen goes for for me
[1:53:53] too
[1:53:55] listen because the darkness of this
[1:53:58] night will take you away from the
[1:54:02] light and it will produce a life of
[1:54:05] Darkness thy eye being single means your
[1:54:09] whole body will be full of light if you
[1:54:11] look at good
[1:54:13] things you'll have good things in your
[1:54:16] body if you look at bad things you're
[1:54:19] going to have your body full of Darkness
[1:54:22] period same is true of the spiritual
[1:54:30] eye right here what do we have
[1:54:36] here they're not
[1:54:39] artificial
[1:54:40] right those are real plants
[1:54:44] right guess
[1:54:46] what this light that light that light
[1:54:50] that light is not
[1:54:54] sufficient because that's a cloudy
[1:54:58] day temporarily it'll preserve that but
[1:55:02] not forever it'll
[1:55:04] die that's
[1:55:06] why you all still put them lights over
[1:55:09] these things
[1:55:10] right what is it ultraviolent
[1:55:13] light and they need ultravid which
[1:55:17] replicates the
[1:55:19] sunshine so you don't have to set them
[1:55:21] out there on the POR
[1:55:22] you can put an UltraViolet artificial
[1:55:25] ultraviolet light over it and they just
[1:55:31] ooo but without
[1:55:33] it Devil's lie is I'll separate you from
[1:55:38] the Sun but not all at one time I'll
[1:55:41] gradually choke you down by not letting
[1:55:44] you get any sunlight at
[1:55:47] all let's
[1:55:50] stand thank you for being attentive this
[1:55:52] morning I know it was a little bit long
[1:55:54] I had to find a place to quit I had to
[1:55:56] bring that in there I don't know if I'll
[1:55:58] maybe in the future I'll have a time I
[1:56:01] think I started
[1:56:03] something I think I started a subject I
[1:56:05] can't quit for a while kind of like the
[1:56:08] book it was a blessing to me I don't
[1:56:10] know about you but I'm not bragging on
[1:56:12] myself I'm just bragging on the
[1:56:16] Lord I have
[1:56:18] never I spoke at brother Paul Griffin's
[1:56:21] church here here two weeks ago or so on
[1:56:24] this same topic that subject had struck
[1:56:27] me I don't know where I was I was
[1:56:29] sitting up here in the front row
[1:56:30] somebody was preaching or I was
[1:56:32] somewhere and a thought come to
[1:56:35] me about the
[1:56:37] light this scripture has has been a
[1:56:40] little bit of a flooring scripture to me
[1:56:42] I was I have to
[1:56:44] confess some of you Brothers like
[1:56:46] brother josi there and brother Daniel
[1:56:48] and brother
[1:56:50] Shawn I I stumbled over that SC I
[1:56:53] thought that's a head
[1:56:55] scratcher it's just a matter of going in
[1:56:57] and studying
[1:56:58] it uh and even looking at some material
[1:57:03] that well let's just save
[1:57:07] that to really find out what he's
[1:57:09] talking about because the English
[1:57:11] language is it doesn't give you a very
[1:57:15] good description of what the scriptures
[1:57:18] were originally wrote in so I had to do
[1:57:21] a little bit of
[1:57:23] research and I just thank the Lord i'
[1:57:25] I've had scriptures like this that have
[1:57:27] suddenly come into my life it's not that
[1:57:29] hey don't get me wrong I don't want to
[1:57:32] make no excuse for ignorance don't want
[1:57:33] to make no IGN excuse for being
[1:57:36] lazy but sometimes there's been
[1:57:38] scriptures I just thought unless the
[1:57:40] Lord opens my eyes on that one I'm I
[1:57:43] can't really preach on that cuz I don't
[1:57:45] know I I don't know the answer you know
[1:57:48] what that's become a milestone to me a
[1:57:50] mile marker now
[1:57:53] and it and it's still unfolding and no
[1:57:55] doubt somebody else is going to preach
[1:57:56] on it and bring out even more and more
[1:57:58] more and more from it I would have liked
[1:57:59] to got into the message excuse
[1:58:03] me to show
[1:58:05] you the evening light has
[1:58:08] come I've got quotes scripture brother
