amen amen if it hadn't been for him what would we do amen where would we be how could we sing a song of redemption amen but because he first loved us we can love him amen and uh just welcome everyone this morning to the house of the Lord and uh the musicians can be dismissed enjoyed the the songs and the worship amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn back to uh The Book of Matthew the 20th chapter praise the Lord and um we want to as it was said said remember brother Bob and prayer as they're keeping him today and um in the hospital amen and brother Amos ministering today just pray the Lord just gives him a just a real anointing there to help the people praise the Lord good to uh see sister Alice back with us amen and uh just everyone and sounds like the sister just had a good time yesterday of Fellowship amen so uh we're glad for that and uh I never had anyone sing uh go Christmas Carolyn in the middle of Mar in March but uh we enjoyed it anyways and uh the Lord is good you know we can have fun you know and uh uh enjoy ourselves in the Lord and sounds like the sisters did so amen but Matthew the 20th chapter and the uh 20thth verse we can start there says then came to him the mother of Zed's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what will thou she saith unto him grant that these my children or my two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he saith unto them you shall indeed uh drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the 10 heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever shall be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen then we're going to go to the book of Philippians the 2 chapter amen Philippians chapter 2 praise the Lord and we'll start at the first verse if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that you be like minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father as we have come here this morning our hearts yearning for more of you and Lord we realize that is a supernatural thing it's a pull that only you could give to us for we're not here just as a society we're not here as a member of a club but Lord our hearts have a genuine hunger a genuine thirst to know you in a greater way father we want to reflect you in everything that we do that now Lord we just humble ourselves before you and ask for your grace and your mercy that you would Grant the desires of our heart and Lord that you would anoint both speaker and hearer and just help me to get myself out of the way and that you would anoint these lips of clay father oh God anoint our hearts and our ears to hear and receive of you we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen you can have your seats this morning and I'm going to continue on the subject of the son of man came to minister and this may seem Elementary to us um but I pray that um it'll be uh of some help to you uh I just have this on my heart and so uh but here we're we're looking at the the ministry of Jesus and we can identify um ourselves with that Ministry because we are to have the same Ministry so this speaks volumes for us uh for Jesus is saying I the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister sometimes we focus upon our needs we focus upon our wants we focus upon ourselves and we demand or require that everybody help us everybody Focus their attention upon us and we forget that that's really not the kingdom of God and the reason why that we can Minister the reason why that we should be able to forget and and and I understand that that we all have needs here but we're not to to focus on them in in such a way to where uh that's that consumes us and the reason why is because we have promises we are taking care of I mean he's he's he's revealed we are the people that he's revealed himself to as Jehovah Gyra the Lord that would provide amen Jehovah Shalom our peace the god that Health us of all of our diseases forgives us of all of our iniquities he forgives us of our sins he's he's loosed us so there there are so many promises that we as Believers should be able to take comfort in Take Rest in to where that we just cast all of our cares upon Him and let him take care of it to where we can focus on needs of others and and so Jesus was sent of the father to redeem those that were lost there's a specific Ministry that Jesus had and that was to redeem and and the people that he came to redeem these people were wretched broken miserable scarred bound and he came to rescue them Lord so therefore he didn't live for himself he didn't think of himself he gave of himself and he came to minister but not in the way that man would do it for his ministry reflected the heart of God it revealed God Amen another thing that his ministry did it pleased God his ministry revealed God pleased God it reflected the heart of God it was a Ministry that stemmed from the love of God and reflected the love of God Amen what a Ministry a Ministry established based on the love of God God so loved that he gave ain't that right God so cared that would produce such a Ministry that Jesus had amen and and other other Ministries that man has established uh it's it's based on love and compassion for the most part but it's a human love it's it's a human compassion but Jesus came to do the will of the father he didn't just set out to do what he thought would be best but he come to do the will of the father for he said my meat is to do the will of of him that sent me and how many Ministries today whether it be just in the world or in churches or whatever that really do not reflect the will of the father but but his ministry did for he was sent of the father we know this scripture very well John 3:16 it tells us is why why the father sent him for God so loved the world ain't that right can you say that with me for God so loved the world he loved you did he not but then he didn't stop loving did heall he loved you but his love still he's Still Loving he's loving other people in need just like you were he's still trying to reach people just like you and so he so loved the world but not his love provided a solution ution and that was he would give his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved now we know the son was the Flesh of God uh he was the human Tabernacle that God dwelt in and so it it's it's actually God becoming human God so loved the world that he became human he produced the body that he could live in and that he could reflect himself through so so this would be a man that would be a total uh reflect something totally different than just normal men could could reflect amen man can reflect love but it it can only go to so far and it's it's all a perverted love that man can can do man can reflect compassion but but but but it's a it's a perverted compassion but God himself would become man and reflect a pure love a a pure compassion a a pure sympathy sympathy sympathy a a pure uh uh attribute ain't that right and so it was God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself God in Christ reconciling and he did not establish any other thing but his son he gave his son amen and that would be he would live in that son in his son that he could reconcile the world unto himself other Ministries are out there but but this is God reconciling the world to himself prise the Lord now John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh God made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth ain't that right so the word made flesh reflected the heart of God the word made flesh and is this not what the word being today it's being made flesh in us the word made flesh reflected the love of God the word made flesh reflected the the the uh the the Deep of God the part of God it reflected God that has been hid from from ages and yet then God becomes flesh the word becomes flesh amen and and reflects what God was it it it was the ideal well the Bible says he was the image of the invisible god brother Brandon would say it the visible image he was the visible image of the invisible God God ain't that right amen God is the spirit amen but now God took on form of a man and everything God was was reflected through that man do you believe that he became the visible image of God Amen so so brother Brandon would say Jesus so loved the enemy that he gave his life for the condemned to save those who were unkind to him him and prayed on the cross father forgive them for they e they don't even know what they're doing they couldn't understand him I'm talking about people just like you they couldn't understand him see he was his preaching was misunderstood his life was misunderstood his speech was misunderstood they didn't even understand him and them are the people he died for he didn't wait for them to understand him he didn't wait for them to accept him he didn't wait for Amen to see what they would do he just died for them because he so loved the world he died for Sinners he died for the Unholy he died for the nobodies The Wretched The Impossibles he died for them you believe it and and and and then the prophet would tell us there there will be nobody there can be there cannot anyone who could love the way Jesus loved because it's such a pure love ain't that right and so he he would say it this way from the very first time his little baby hand stroke those pretty cheeks of his beautiful mother he was love from that till he forgive His Last Enemy on the cross he was God's expression of love no one could love like Jesus see God God being manifested in a little tiny baby come in order to take away the sins of the world and when you just speak the word Jesus there's something about it that means love Jesus means love can you say amen amen and and and we are not called Baptists we're not called Pentecostals we're not called any other thing than Miss Jesus Christ we bear that same name do you believe it we bear the same name see and no one see and so he says that's what the world needs more today is not a Jesus of some past tense not not a memorial not another play and and we're not against them things of plays and things uh if it's done right and things but but it's it's it's that's not what the world needs they don't need a Jesus of past tense they need a Jesus of today do you believe it see so it the world needs more world uh what the world needs more today is not a Jesus of some past T some Jesus of of some high ethics but a Jesus of love that can be expressed in the Church of the Lord Jesus especially as its members one to another ought to always greet one another in love Hallelujah can you say amen I think it starts at home I think we shouldn't just call someone well Sam you know it should be Brother Sam we shouldn't just just throw our name each other's names around it it should be a brother it should be sister it should be said with respect can you say Amen see and so uh um it's it's very easy and and I think we can all um agree it's very easy for us to love someone that loves us we can love someone that doesn't hurt us we can love someone that doesn't misunderstand us we can love someone that we can be relaxed around relaxed when we're around them we can love someone who doesn't criticize us complain and question I think I you know um been here 12 years and the more I just hear of the history around in this area um I think all of us have uh endured or been in one way or another and it's it's human but yet it's with in the message around here been hurt been been scarred have got a past and and so many have left the message just because of past actions uh bad experiences and they're hardened they don't want nothing to do with the message they don't want to do anything with God or if they do they just go back to a a nominal church or whatever and to me it's it's sad because they didn't really get the taste of what the real message is but you're here you you you could have turned aside just like others you could have found all kinds of excuses I've talk to and not just here but around the nation of of people that won't even go to church because of past experiences with Ministry uh confusions um it's just just all kinds of things and um it and and and and the wounds are there and yet yet you know you you have come from different backgrounds and and things and and um you're you're still pressing the battle amen hallelujah and you know uh we can build on hurts we we can build our whole life our whole actions upon the wrong wrongs the misunderstandings the scars the all of these things and and and to be honest um if we're not careful we can start using excuses for these things we we it's so easy to become a recluse it it's so easy just to hide within ourselves so we don't get hurt no more so that we don't get scarred that that that someone won't wound us again or or whatever it's and and and and and and it's hard even to the point that we we can even get to a place that we don't trust that that we don't um that we don't give anymore there's been very few men that I have seen wounded scarred hurt go through things in life and one of them is my dad and of course mom but but I've seen the things that have been done said you know he stood with the pastor for 30 some years built that church from ground up labored very hard and he stood with that and because he stood with the pastor those that were against the pastor anytime that Dad would preach I remember it dad always preached you know Tuesday nights uh we had Tuesday night Thursday night Sunday mornings Sunday nights and then in between prayer meetings and uh we was at church constantly and but um soon as I I remember as a boy as soon as Dad get up and preach several people just up and walk out and they they wanted just to show something to him they wanted to send a message and and you know and then of all the times you know that that Dad would stand for the pastor you know and all that Pastor kicks him out of his home don't don't you know don't come back and I remember dad said I'll never go back by George you know and uh you know and it was over you know Dad believed in Grace Pastor hadn't come into that yet and and then it was the second time us boys we'd come into the message Pastor didn't say he thought we went wo so he wanted dad to straighten us boys out and dad says I ain't doing it then what they're doing is right and they got you know it it got a little heated and and he got kicked out got kicked out and and I've I've seen him I've seen a life of of just constant constant not not just just with that but other things and and and one thing that that I've noticed about Dad that I've I've prayed that God would let me be that and that is that that always came back dad always came back dad always fought for love God dad always fought for Unity that always pushed past the hurts and a past the scars and a past the words and a past the attitudes and the past to where even even our our pastor former Pastor you I think most most of y'all know what he done you know he ended his wife's life and and ended his own life and what a shame what embarrassment and dad you know Dad could have had by all right say see I knew he was a scumbag I knew it you know cuz us boys you know we we had some pretty thoughts about this you know when I heard about I just I cried and I was I was mad than the Hornet why would he if he want to do his own self that's fine but don't take sister Donna you know she's like a second mother to me and and so we you know so we had these things and and and then of all things they asked Dad to preach the funeral and we're all there all these critics are all there you know and and from all these years people that I've growed up with all my life and there they are you know and and it must have you know I seemed like a Victorious time for all everybody and then Dad would start telling about the things of that brother burst was and how good he was and what a man he was and how he loved this gospel and you know I mean you know and then he'd say you know he says I've always had his back and he says you know he says I Brother David you know and he just yells out Brother David he said I still got your back you know and I thought now there's there's Dad that's that's dad now now Dad could have Dad could have sold them seeds in my life of bitterness he could have sold uh hate toward that man he could have sold all kinds of of things in our life uh uh that that um would have caused us to to hate that man to despise that church to despise it all but Dad in everything I was talking to him just you know a couple months back and he said you know why I said dad why why didn't you just walk away why did you just keep coming back he said well for one he said I remember my grand my dad got bitter and he said I refused to get bitter I just would not get bitter he said I fought bitterness all my life and I won't get bitter he said but then also he said I knew y'all were coming uput and he said my actions depended on you all or what you all would be would depend upon what I did and how I reacted and how you know and I look back and I say thank God for a dad that that that through all of his failures now he was not a perfect dad I could just stand here and tell you everything about my dad amen and and and y'all may not like him afterward I don't know but but what would be the point point of it you understand what I'm saying and and we've all got our failures we've all got our our our our things that are just and we regret I've seen my dad cry and I've seen him you know weep over things that maybe you know uh uh uh that that he knew he had made mistakes on and all that but I've seen the man get back up and keep pressing on you understand what I'm saying and it wasn't for his benefit it was for my benefit it was for Wendell's benefit alen's benefit Jonathan's benefit and not only that it was for his grandchildren's benefit and and and I look at him and now that that he's got this Parkinson and he's shaking he can barely talk barely walk and anytime now anytime that that you go talk to him he barely whispering but he's going to crack a joke or he's going to talk about the Lord he you never find him talking negative and you know why because he's got grandchildren coming up he's got somebody that is watching him you understand what I'm saying Ministry is not always behind the pulpit and so he he would push aside all of these things thinking amen of others thinking of others well so so here and I hope that's okay to say that but but it we can love someone who doesn't criticize us but but for someone that would criticize us someone that would complexes complexes are built up by words that are said by by things that are done by by all of these things we build complexes and and there's plenty of people to build complexes in our lives there's there's plenty of things that that that we could take and use as excuses church can you say amen and and if we're not careful then we become just us for and no more amen and and we lose the value of souls because we're so caught up in our own problems and our own own needs and our own things and God never called us to be that that's right amen that's right amen yes now the prophet said Jesus didn't have that kind of love what kind of love love that would love somebody that loved him he said he had God's love and God loved his enemies for God so loved the world when the world was unlovable God still loved the world world and you say Amen as I was saying last Sunday he was despised and rejected and yet he didn't allow bitterness to take root in him he was mocked scorned and laughed at and yet he didn't allow the hurt to harden his heart that's right amen he felt the pain from being rejected and and and and despised he he felt that because he was a man of of of of Sor he was a man of of grief he was a man that goes through kinds of things that we all go through God wanted to know what you go through God wanted to know what you suffer God wanted to know the trials that you go through can you say Amen so he had to feel he had to feel the pain and not just pain in the flesh he had to feel the pain in his Spirit he had to feel amen the the the hurt that word that come from words and he had to know the pain that comes from rejection he had to know the scars amen that that you and all all of us deal with can you say amen he he had to know that so it wasn't an easy life for him amen and yet he come with one purpose not to be minister to but to minister so through all the pain and all the suffering and all the agony and all the rejection he came to minister he never forgot that can you say amen he never stopped focusing upon what his mission was Amen to where he turned it all to himself and said well why if I get back up there and preach you're going to re are going to walk away well why do it no he did it he did it he did it for you and I praise the Lord Hall it wasn't easy for him to live this life but he it was a life of ministry a life of serving as we know he could have called 10,000 angels to come down and set him free deliver him to where he wouldn't have even had to be arrested amen there in the Garden of Gethsemane he could have been kept from being evily mistreated by his so-called friend but Paul says that he endured the cross and despised the shame I looked up that word despised it means ignored he endured the cross and ignored the shame thank you Lord ignored they stripped his clothes from him there he hung there as as a laughing stock the god of heaven and there he was everybody spitting on him but he ignored it praise the Lord ignored it Lord Paul in speaking of Jesus said he endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself one one uh um um one translation says he endured from Sinners such Grievous opposition and bitter hostility against himself yeah see so so then we we we look at this ministry takes enduring yeah he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved not just enduring being Christian enduring going to church but enduring in what God called you to do you you we all started out when we come to the calvary when we come to the altar when we gave our hearts to the Lord wherever it was we all started out clean feeling great fresh y'all remember it burdens rode away no guilt we loved everyone we want to tell everyone ain't that right so we start out that way we start out with that love we start out with that Zeal we started out with wanting to tell everybody what God done for us we started out believing every promise in the book we started out with such such faith and and desire to know more of God he that endureth to the end can you say Amen not someone that starts out this way and ends up a bitter old man a bitter woman scarred up hateful indifferent mad at the world striking out at the world blaming everybody for what they done to us can you say Amen but he that endureth to the end there's a love that'll endure there's a peace that'll endure there's a Ministry he showed it to us a Ministry that'll endure hallu that's true takes enduring how how can a man endure such things how how what kept Jesus from being bitter what caused him to disregard ignore the Hurts The Words the actions everything that came against him what caused him just to ignore it as if though it never happens God have mercy that he could get up every day not being bothered by that not being contaminated with that facing the same people hello yeah he knew his death was coming he knew that most of the people that he talked to was going to kill him can you say amen amen so what would cause him to disregard the hurts and not abort his mission what caused him to get up every day without resentment toward God toward God people people forget they don't pray no more because they just so hurt right they forget reading their Bibles they don't go to the house of God no more just tired of it all how many people say I'm just tired of the Hypocrites in the church just tired of this tired of that well what all you doing is you're just blaming God but he got up every morning without blaming God and he's still done the will of the father he still maintained he endure sir he didn't just say well my meat is to do the will of the father and that was on a Monday and by Friday he was so upset quitting and giving up and and telling the disciples I don't you just go do what you want to do I'm tired of messing with all of you Hallelujah on but he got up every day without resentment toward God and toward the people that's true what caused him to say father forgive them for they know not what they do as he was hang hanging there on the cross they're mocking him they're spitting in his face they're the one that's crying out well if he be God if he is the one who says he is and get him on let him get off the cross you all that time he's hearing all this he's hearing their mockery he's feeling their hate toward him amen and then he says father forgive them for they know not what they do right well why why how could he do it because the Bible gives us the answer and here it is so many scriptures go look it up type it in his mercy endureth forever his righteousness endureth for the ever the truth of the Lord endureth forever his righteous judgments endureth forever his name endureth forever his Domin iion endureth throughout Generations the word of the Lord endureth forever can you say Amen see so everything about the Eternal God endures his love endures that's why he cannot love you today amen and hate you tomorrow he couldn't save you a year ago and then you wind up in hell he can't do it there is something about God that endures his thoughts about you have endured all this time through all of your mistakes and all of your mess up and everything about you amen that when the world the church the preacher the wife the mother uh uh the the Father the the husband and and everybody else and all your friends have forsaken you and say I don't think there's any hope his Mercy endures his love endures Hallelujah can you say Amen it endures the test it endures the trials you see we're the one that comes up with the the the mental blocks we're the one that comes up with the question whether he loves me or not but he has no question about you that's true it endures the loneliness we feel we go through the tests right we go through the trials we go through the misunderstandings we experien all of these things but his love his Mercy his word his promises endure forever they endure amen so the prophet said Jesus was manifested to show God to the people amen so what he had wasn't a natural thing his ministry didn't have a natural quality it wasn't on the human element can you sayen but it had an eternal quality what Jesus had endured the love that Jesus had endured the mercy that Jesus showed endured the word that Jesus was endured the ministry that Jesus had endured amen ain't that right now the prophet said Jesus knew that he couldn't save everyone he encountered and he didn't worry about the ones that he couldn't reach and when I'm saying this I'm I'm not saying that he just I forget them no but he didn't worry about their unbelief toward him he didn't you understand what I'm saying if people don't you know we say well we're Christian well if people don't believe you're a Christian then we just well what's the use then you know no they despised him they rejected him but he didn't consider their actions he he didn't build his ministry around them that's right if he did he would have just Gott hurt all the time that's right he would have gotten angry he would have gotten he he it would have affected him he did not allow their thoughts of him to affect him hello he didn't allow their criticism of him to offend him to where he would just quit but he ignored the shame he endured the suffering to save the ones he could help and Jesus said that he Sanctified himself for their sake that's true he Sanctified himself Paul here in 2 Corinthians 88:9 says you know the the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though though he was rich yet for your sakes everybody say for my sake s he became poor that you through his poverty might become rich what a Ministry what a Ministry it wasn't a Ministry about building himself it was for your sakes and his ministry was so for you that he would become poor that you could become rich am I believe with all my heart that if he was sent for only one person he wouldn't have changed a thing he would have endured more of the criticism because there had been more people against him if he just come for one person but through this whole entire time time through all the history you realize Satan has persecuted the Christians and Christianity he hates it to a passion and yet God continues and with longsuffering right with longsuffering well who's that long what's that long suffering being projected through you me amen not saying God just kill him just wipe them off the face of the Earth God just any day waiting you know there's remember when brother brandom open them when when the seals were open there were Souls under the altar that people thought that was the bride yeah go ahead but he said no it couldn't be the bride and what how did he distinguish this how did he tell the difference he said because these people were crying for vengeance how long Lord will you avenge us that's right how long Lord he said see that ain't the bride because the bride would be saying father forgive them Father don't don't don't hold that against them Father help them can you say Amen that was the difference it was the Jews he said that was crying for vengeance that's right their blood was crying out for vengeance but here is a bride in this day now you think of it in this day of every pressure imaginable and yet she has the qualities think about it of Christ amen forgive them Father yes forgive them for they know not what they do can you say amen that's good became poor became poor that we could through his Pro poverty become rich reminds me of the same thing of Paul where he said I become all things to all men yeah that I might save some amen when Jesus was sent to Earth he was sent to a specific people Matthew 15:24 and I hope this is all right amen but Matthew 15:24 says I am not sent Jesus said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel and then when he sends his 12 disciples out he tells them not to go by the way of the Gentiles or the Samaritans don't don't go by them but he says here uh there in Matthew 10: 6 go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and that as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely give what a Ministry amen ain't that right yes sir see and and so the gospel was to be preached the prophet said to the Gentiles at a later time and and and we know when it turned to the Gentiles when Paul after the Jews had rejected and rejected and rejected finally says lo we turn to the Gentiles and that was when the dispensation of Grace turned to the Gentile uh uh the grace turned to the Gentile dispensation but notice the ministry the prophet said that Jesus gave his disciples was actually sharing his own Ministry with them ain't that right see go Matthew 9:35 5 and Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the gospel of the Kingdom healing every sick and every disease among the people ain't that right see so he gave them that part of the ministry as well go heal the lepers cleans you know heal the sick cast out those devils and and all of that so he gives them a part of his ministry hello don't just go learn I'm going to said yet but you go learn psychology and you learn to be a theologian and and and and you learn to do this and you go get your license and all that no no no I'm not going to give you a Ministry of men I'm going to give you a Ministry of myself gives them that power and and then the 36th verse but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then he saith unto his disciples the the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few there was all kinds of churches there was all kinds of things that was going there was doctors there was you know all these Physicians and and and whatever else hello there was hospitals but what he was looking for is someone to carry his ministry and the Harvest is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send for labors into his Harvest amen amen I'm thankful for the different programs that man has come up with to help the needy I I truly am I'm I'm thankful for doctors I'm thankful for our law enforcement right I'm thankful for the Ian Ian EMTs something like that paramedics we're than thankful thankful for the Red Cross and what they do thankful for food organizations that that would help those that have no food and that are hungry thankful for the shelters that are established for the homeless actually there are there are maybe not everybody but but there are true people that need help that are homeless and and and I I I'm thankful for the alcoholic and Drug programs to help the people with their addictions these are real problems and and truly we we can't deny the fact that they've helped people in some way or another they've helped people in need amen but but in all of that that's still not the laborers that that God has has was called or was looking for when Jesus was calling for Laborers that's not that's not necessarily what he was looking for even though Believers can be doctors Believers can be you know uh uh Physicians and and and paramedics and and all of these things but yet as a Believer they got to realize I've got a greater Ministry than just this that's right these laborers that Jesus was uh uh talking specifically about was labors in his church I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail that church would be his laborers that church would be his body as Paul said you see we are the ones that God is depending on Amen you with me we are the ones that God has called and elected you can't be in the church without being elected predestinated having your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life Lord sealed up with the Holy Ghost Supernatural call Supernatural everything about this and he called you for his laborer anyone can be a doctor as far as if you're brilliant in your mind go to the right schooling unconverted men are brain surgeons and and and lawyers and whatever else out there but to be part of his church to be part of his body there's got to be something Supernatural that happens to you you don't have to be smart you don't have to be rich you don't have to have it all together thank you Lord amen but God called you changes us places Us in his body we are the laborers amen hallu we are the ones that God is depending on and and and I have to tell you God didn't send us out as doctors to work in medicine and science I'm I'm I'm saying you can do that and that's fine you you can do that in the natural but but to be part of his church he didn't tell the church to go out and build hospitals he didn't tell the church well learn all the medications that you you got and I'll be with you you know just pump them needles in them he he didn't teach us them things he didn't tell us to go learn all the the the steps to AA can you say amen he didn't send us out as doctors of divinity and theologians and psychologist he didn't he didn't send us out to exercise our human faith and human love and human compassion and human sympathy and then human intelligence Amen brother BR said human Faith doesn't go very far it'll deny the promises of God and it stems from intellectual reasonings we know we know we've talked about it we've read it we've heard it human love human compassion human sympathy it just throws everything in a in a puddle and and and brother said doesn't even consider the word of God ain't that right but I want you to notice there in Matthew the The Book of Matthew and I didn't give it to them and so but but here it says and there shall come forth a ruler can you say that with me there shall come forth a ruler out of Bethlehem that shall rule over my people Lord there shall be a ruler that to rule over my people he'll be that government praise the Lord ain't that right now notice as Jesus getting ready to go up and Ascend into heaven what watch what he tells his disciples acts 1: 18 but you shall receive power what power after that what the Holy Ghost comes upon you see and you shall be what Witnesses unto me this is what's going to make you laborers I'm going to send the Holy Ghost to you and it's going to Quicken you can you say Amen what love you thought you have but then here's he's talking to people that were broken he's talking to people even Peter's among them I said I'll never forsake you and he done it anyhow but it was because his human love his his Human Side failed him yeah but you'll be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father unto you see what the promise of the Holy Spirit but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high ain't that right John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he he will guide you what is it now they've got a new ruler it's not their old lust it's not their own flesh it's not their own self not their own desires and selfish motives and selfish this amen they're not longer no longer being led by that anymore because it would not lead Peter to stand there and be crucified with him he denied the Lord hello cuz he is scared for his life right but alad you amen he's going to guide you into all Truth for shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine and therefore I said I that he shall take of mine and show it unto you can you say Amen so what is it the Holy Spirit today rules over the people of God ain't that right and the Holy Spirit is the word are you with me the holy spirit is the word the Holy Spirit rules the word rule over the people of God and if you notice Jesus did not want his disciples going out doing anything for the kingdom until they first were endued with power until they first received the Holy Ghost brother BR says he told his disciples to T until Pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them notice he would fall upon them F them then that called out body the church would be in his stad up on the earth taking his place denominations can't take his place there is no people that can take his place but his church that has been filled with his very Life quickened by the Holy Ghost then they stand in his stead taking his place amen because that same spirit that was in him would be in them and they would do the very works and any people that is truly the body of Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as did Jesus the Pentecostal Church be and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them and any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account for God to God can you say amen amen I read other quotes The Same Spirit that was on Jesus Christ has come back on his church doing the same signs same wonders same Holy Ghost same power it's the Covenant that God has given to them another place the holy spirit is the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ that has sended upon the church to continue the works of the Lord Jesus in his going away can you say Amen see that same Holy Ghost was that one was on the Messiah is still on his church today yes sir do you believe that amen so it's quickened us that we could continue that work but Church Glory we're going to be a people that's scarred we're going to be a people that's wounded we're going to be a people rejected we're going to be a people that is going to hurt we're going to be a people misunderstood we're going to be a people that be tempted just to walk away maybe not not walk away from God in that sense but walk away from Ministry walk away and just hide ourselves and and build up walls and complexes we're going to be a people like that but God has called us to continue on his ministry and he knows you can do it because he gave himself he filled you with himself that Eternal quality that Jesus had now is in his church cry your tears but keep pressing on can you say amen amen notice what was given to the church and I hope this all right acts 3:1 it says now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them but notice what Peter said cuz he's expecting to receive something natural today there's so many people in the same boat looking to a personality looking to a politician looking to something that can appease them give them a television give them money give them give them the lottery give them a a free vacation I ain't got all that to give and this is what Peter he didn't have medication to give he he didn't say well I I I'm doctor so and so you just come to my to into my surgery room and I'll open your eyes he didn't have that P had been up in the day of Pentecost he had been up there anded the same God that was in Christ can you say Amen see and so he had expected to receive something of them and then Peter says silver old Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking leaping and praising God now what did Peter have amen certainly didn't have silver and gold certainly didn't have an education CU he was ignorant and unlearned so what did he have well in the 16th verse it says and his name Jesus through faith in his name Jesus hath made this man who was once strong whom you see and know yay the faith everybody say the faith which is by from him Christ hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all can you say Amen so brother Ram said see it was jesus' name and Jesus faith that brought about the miracle it wasn't human faith it wasn't a human name he had something greater than that right all together amen abam said see Peter did not claim that it was his own faith that did it neither did he claim that it was his own name that did it he didn't get the glory he didn't say see look what I've done it was nothing about him oh how we need people with the Holy Ghost to quit exalting [Music] themselves and give all the glory to God who are we anyways how are we standing today that is true you said that jesus' name used in the faith which is from Jesus perform that work can you say amen that's right see so what was it that Peter had Jesus on the day of Pentecost gave his faith to the church can you say Amen how in the world do we preach day and day out of Miracles and Promises when everything is looking ugly and and and all these say there is a faith beyond my faith what causes us to keep claiming our children when it looks like there's nothing it's impossible here's a faith that's been given us what causes us to keep singing what causes us to keep loving what causes us to keep preaching what causes us to keep testifying there's a faith faith that has been greater can you say Amen yes sir see so he says see it's it's in Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus perform that great work right see jesus' name used in the faith which was from Jesus perform that great work see see so how are they going to be Witnesses of him Jesus gives him there gives them the his faith a faith that can move mountains a faith that can walk on Waters a faith that could stand there at the grave of Lazarus amen that had been 4 days dead and say Lazarus come forth the same faith that God had to stand there and say Let There Be and there was and he gave the church that same Faith hallelujah amen you know what the prophet said it was Pentecostal faith that he gave them Pentecostal faith that he gave them no wonder we can believe in miracles no wonder we can believe in in gifts when they're operated right no wonder we can believe in the super natural it's a Pentecostal faith not some faith that just well you can tell what happened here if if you look at it in in the church ages in Revelations 2:13 God addresses the Saints in the peram pergamus church age he said I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name Jesus right and has not denied my faith Jesus Faith right see so now notice what the prophet said it wasn't a faith in him that he was speaking of it wasn't a faith in him it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers amen they had not denied his faith they had not relinquished his faith can you say man yes sir now I'm going give you some scriptures Romans 12:3 according as God hath dealt to every man this is always I I always question this scripture and and wondering what that meant and and I'm telling you what I I reading it the other day and and what brother Brown said about that scripture and wow yeah it happens to me too you know but Roman say according as God ha dealt to every man and then brother Brown says every believer so not every man just general cuz I thought well if he's dealt every man inord of faith and then you hear so many people so Skeptics and unbelief and they just talk doubt and that that's not what he's saying every man believer a Measure of Faith Can you say Amen what faith his faith his faith right oh yes sir see he's giving it to you see Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are you Sav through faith and that that faith not of yourselves it's a gift of God James 2:1 my brethren have not the faith of or not in the prophet says see have not the faith in or or have not the faith of so not in but have the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respects of persons can you say Amen so not having faith in but having the faith of and don't have that faith of in respects of persons where you start looking well I believe he can be safe cuz he's got a little bit money and he's got this and he looks fine but but that one I don't know look at that old bum and he's just a uh uh uh he's so hopeless and all don't be having that don't take the faith of God and start just portioning it out everywhere no no no all things are possible to them that believe can you say Amen yes sir I don't care what mountain you're facing don't put that faith of God and limit it you ain't going to work the ministry of Jesus Christ with that so it was by that faith that the ministry of Jesus Christ operates in the Church of the Living God praise the Lord and so but in this pergamin church age brother brownan said the majority of the people had forsaken the faith of God and taken the faith of nickan Creeds dogmas right and they forsook the faith of God hello and he says they had turned away from the truth that salvation is of the Lord and we're now humanizing salvation yeah they had cast aside the doctrine of election and open wide The Door Church door and their Fellowship to any and all who subscribed to their doctrines never mind the word right but there were a few who still had the measure of that faith of the Lord Jesus Christ and they not only used that faith in Acts of power but they also with stod by that Faith they with stod those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church the ministry had changed from a Supernatural Ministry to a human Ministry same thing today give them Donuts give them gas cards give bicycle giveaways or whatever giveaways and let's fill the church up humanizing salvation shake the preacher's hand do this and do that say s De Creed and and and all these things humanizing salvation but there's a people that still have the faith of God they can believe they can believe amen that that God can deliver that soul from the pits of hell don't have to give you a substitute but what I do have sir I give in the name of Jesus Christ amen that's good amen that's true I remember we we done a lot of Outreach uh me and Wendell my dad well our whole church done a lot of Outreach among the Native Indians tent meetings Street meetings and we were uh living dad had moved up to a place called kinwood Oklahoma among the Cherokees and if you ever been on a for the most part A a Indian Reservation it's so much really it's it's so shame but so much uh alcohol drugs just hopeless hopeless people you go into some of these places like in South Dakota Fort Thompson on the Sue reservation back at the time that we were there they were having what they called suicide packs where young people would come together and they would agree on a certain night they would hang themselves and that was pretty common that they were just hopeless so here we are in Kenwood and we'd have Outreach and it was kind of a Healy country we was kind of in a valley with heels and so we set speakers in in the summertime we'd set speakers out on our roof of the little building that we had and crank that puppy up and and it would Echo out in the valley and we'd have service outside and just preach away but I remember this one Cherokee Indian and I His Name Escapes my memory right now um that he was a tall fell unshaved and uh teeth broken what he had was rotted and he was a drunk and alcoholic mean man everybody was scared of him and the police they were 10 the closest was 10 miles away that he would set he would put stuff in the road and all that for them and call on them and you know it wreck you know watch them wreck and he just loved you know it was it was just he was honor and he had a boy just uh I don't know he might have been seven eight years old he wasn't married but he had this boy with him and his boy had sores and just like they just never took a bath and um um just a sad situation everybody just Mitchell his name was Mitchell everybody just stayed away from Mitchell I remember you know I don't know wend might have been 17 I would say so that that would have made me 1314 but one said Sean you want to go with me to witness to Mitchell MIT Mitchell yeah I I said well isn't that the one that no one wants to witness to yeah um well yeah we'll go so we we found this place out in the woods and you get out there and it's just a shack and it's even worse than Brother Sam Shack and it just put up by Boards and it was it it was a lean when I say lean to it was a lean the floor leaned and so we knocked on his makeshift door and trash just all around the yard and all that you know and so we knocked on the door and no one answered so we knocked a little bit louder window did and F we heard a who's there you know and didn't even bother to open the door you know so we're kind of talking to the door uh wend found his voice says uh um I'm Wendell and this is my brother Sean what do you want well we came to talk to you about the Lord get lost so we did we left and I was kind of relieved a few days later wend last says Sean you want to go back and see if we can witness to Mitchell I said sure let's go so we go same process who's there well this is I'm Wendell and this is my brother Sean I thought I'd told y'all to leave well we did but we're back said would you just let us in and it a long wait and we didn't know what was going to happen and finally says come in so we opened the door best we could and like I said the floor was a little leaning so we walked in there and it stunk just filthy dark there he was just beer cans everywhere and what do you want so we just started talking to him about the Lord and how that the Lord just loved him and that he could change his life to where he just wouldn't have to be a wretched drunk that God can make him a respectable Citizen and and as we begin to talk the tears just begin to roll down his cheeks the presence of the Lord just come into that little old Shanny and we LED old Mitchell to the Lord that day hallu that man quit his drinking immediately threw away his tobacco never smoked that man God so changed that man that he would just walk around everywhere smiling just barely any teeth he was so he was so happy he just talking to everybody just all that community in Kenwood just talking about what God done for him God was so good and I thought but what if what if we would have just left loud things to get in our way what if we would have built complexes well he stinks and well I don't know if everybody else don't like him then we probably shouldn't maybe he's got a gun I don't know you know but there was we had to press past that so we could reach somebody can you say Amen somebody there's somebody that we got to reach church and we've got to look past what they are we've got to look past the conditions that they're in we you got to look past because they've got the they've got a wall built up and they're hurting I think the best thing that we could do is remember where God brought us from look at what we were look at the conditions God had to have done something for us and if he can do it for us he can do it for them but we are his laborers we've got to tell somebody about God you love him amen if the musicians will come the [Music] Lord and I know not everybody's going to accept it not everybody's going to understand it but do we stop because of it no do we get discouraged to where we just quit saying things talking about the Lord if we do that then all we are we're just going to hear them we're going to hear them talk and trash God we're going to hear them talk negative we're going to hear all them talk of all their bad problems and all that can you imagine we hold the answers we hold the answers and we watch them so miserable and they're complaining about this and complaining about that and woe is me and all of this and we hold the answers we must not stop talking and telling somebody about the Lord telling somebody that God can heal them can you sayen you love him hope it's helped you some way today what song is [Music] it oh how he loves you and [Applause] me oh how he loves you and me
