[32:53] right so we've been praying for that and
[32:56] and believing it our uh it has been
[32:58] really windy uh as yall know and so our
[33:01] tent has been put through the test it's
[33:05] tried and tested and and it's standing
[33:08] so this is good wonderful and uh we
[33:11] appreciate uh uh brother Tim uh you know
[33:15] he he helped us get it all together and
[33:18] he's been going out there every day uh
[33:20] making sure that it's
[33:22] there and uh we have one pole U we got
[33:27] you know it's it's pressure really tight
[33:30] and I think it sunk uh sunk a foot or so
[33:34] down in the dirt and um on one corner so
[33:37] actually I I kind of felt tall uh
[33:40] because the top of the tent is here to
[33:42] me and uh I like wow this is really neat
[33:45] so we're going to have to fix that but
[33:47] uh uh uh but anyway the Lord's been good
[33:50] to us and if you have your Bibles uh
[33:54] we're going to turn to the book of
[33:55] Hebrews the 13th chapter
[33:58] and um I have uh decided to dismiss the
[34:02] evening service uh uh today and um my
[34:07] reason is I'd like to uh take some um
[34:11] time this evening to pass out flyers
[34:15] around town and maybe uh put them in
[34:18] stores or uh talk to people or uh there
[34:22] and and just invite them to come and so
[34:25] anyone that would like to uh join me to
[34:28] do that um we're going to meet here
[34:30] around 5: here at the church and then um
[34:33] we can Branch out from there and um um
[34:38] it'll just be casual dressed and and so
[34:42] um yeah so we don't want people think

[40:00] away Lord May our faith be risen into
[40:04] Heavenly Heavenly atmospheres today we
[40:08] ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[40:12] amen thank you
[40:14] Lord if you had turned to the book of
[40:17] Hebrews the 13th
[40:20] chapter and the the 14th
[40:24] verse but it says for here
[40:28] have we no continuing
[40:30] City but we seek one to
[40:33] come amen you can have your seats this
[40:39] morning and I I want to
[40:44] continue along the lines of we look for
[40:48] an eternal city of
[40:50] Peace for that's what this city is it's
[40:53] a city of Peace um Revelations the 21st
[40:58] chapter the 2 verse it says and I John
[41:01] saw the holy city New
[41:05] Jerusalem and uh uh of course Jerusalem
[41:09] was first called
[41:11] Salem and
[41:13] Salem that word means city of
[41:16] peace and and so this is the um uh the
[41:23] city that we are looking for and it's
[41:26] not just just a uh City but it's the
[41:30] city of peace and it's an eternal City
[41:33] and as John said it's a holy city amen a
[41:37] holy city for it would have to be holy
[41:40] in order for it to
[41:42] continue and and so we remember that
[41:47] Abraham he met the king of this city
[41:50] there in Hebrews 7 and2 Paul talks about
[41:54] it says Abraham gave a tenth part of all
[41:57] first being in by interpretation king of
[42:00] righteousness and after that also king
[42:03] of Salem which is king of peace and he
[42:08] without father without mother without
[42:10] descent having neither beginning of days
[42:13] nor end of life so then we know that
[42:15] there's only one uh that would be that
[42:18] and that's God Amen uh uh Abraham met
[42:23] God in human flesh amen and
[42:27] and and and then in Hebrews 11 and9 Paul
[42:31] would tell us that Abraham looked for a
[42:34] city he he met the king of the city and
[42:38] he knew he knew that that there had to
[42:41] be a city and he began to look for a
[42:44] city which had Foundation whose Builder
[42:47] and maker is is God and and according to
[42:51] 1 Corinthians 14 and and
[42:55] 33 uh uh it would say that God is the
[42:58] author of Peace amen a city of Peace the
[43:02] king of peace and he's the author of of
[43:06] Peace So as I stated last Sunday that
[43:09] the word peace it it means rest
[43:13] quietness uh no fear uh Tranquility uh
[43:18] safety free from Rage and free from
[43:22] Havoc of war no war no it's no no no
[43:27] fear uh it's a place of safety and and
[43:31] so then peace means that the enemy has
[43:34] been conquered it it it means that
[43:37] you're in agreement and in
[43:40] Fellowship uh you have been delivered
[43:43] from the enemy and are now dwelling in
[43:47] safety amen so then this city of Peace
[43:50] would mean that the enemy ain't there uh
[43:53] that it is a place of safety it's a
[43:55] refuge it's there there's there's no
[43:58] fear there's no torment there's because
[44:01] that's what the the the the word demon
[44:03] means it means Tormentor and but but
[44:06] this is a city of Peace but that no no
[44:09] more wars and rumors of wars and and uh
[44:14] no more panic attacks and and worrying
[44:17] and all of that it's it's it's a place
[44:20] of of Peace amen and in Jeremiah 29
[44:25] and11 God says I know the thoughts that
[44:28] I think toward you uh sayith the Lord
[44:31] thoughts of Peace amen and not of evil
[44:36] uh to give you an expected end ain't
[44:38] that right so so the thoughts that God
[44:41] has uh uh toward us is thoughts of peace
[44:45] I'm so glad for that amen and to give us
[44:48] an expected end so what is our end well
[44:51] according to Psalms 37:37 we read it
[44:54] last Sunday but the end is peace peace
[44:57] for it says Mark the perfect man and
[44:59] behold the upright for the end of that
[45:03] man is what peace it's not wrath it's
[45:08] not torment it's not destruction it's
[45:12] it's peace amen and so this is the the
[45:15] thoughts that God has uh uh toward us
[45:18] thoughts of peace and to bring us to an
[45:21] expected end and that's the end of Peace
[45:24] ain't that right amen I like what Paul
[45:27] said in in 2 Timothy 4 and18 he says the
[45:32] Lord shall deliver me from every evil
[45:35] work amen if we're going to a an eternal
[45:39] city of peace and the end of uh uh our
[45:43] end is peace then then we're looking at
[45:47] this and the Lord shall deliver me from
[45:49] every evil work and will preserve me
[45:53] unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom whom
[45:57] be glory forever and ever aren't you
[46:00] glad that there is a delivering power
[46:04] amen that delivers us yes sir and so
[46:07] whatever work that God does in a man's
[46:11] life the end of it is peace and always
[46:14] remember that that if God's hand is upon
[46:17] you no matter what he allows in your
[46:20] life uh um the end of that will be peace
[46:24] for that's what God thinks of you and
[46:27] his thoughts toward you is of Peace
[46:30] after Jesus healed the woman who had the
[46:32] issue of blood he said to her he said
[46:35] thy faith have made thee whole go in
[46:38] peace Amen in other words the the
[46:41] Tormentor that had tormented you is no
[46:44] longer there now go in peace ain't that
[46:47] right amen he said to the prostitute who
[46:50] had washed uh his feet and and uh and
[46:54] there she was uh uh uh kneeling before
[46:58] him and he says thy sins which are many
[47:01] uh are now forgiven thee go thy way in
[47:06] peace amen amen so here's a woman that
[47:10] was afflicted in her body and and now
[47:12] the devil had been driven from her and
[47:15] was told to go in peace and and here's a
[47:18] woman who had many many sins and a
[47:21] wretched prostitute and and yet God had
[47:24] forgiven her sins and she was told go in
[47:28] peace amen see that's the thing is it's
[47:32] our way is peace when God does something
[47:35] for us it's it's it's to bring peace to
[47:38] us
[47:40] amen he's the God of Peace and when he
[47:44] came to live with man he came uh uh to
[47:49] guide our feet into the way of Peace
[47:52] according to Luke
[47:54] 179 amen you see his work of redemption
[47:57] brought peace to us amen Colossians 1:20
[48:02] and having made peace through the blood
[48:04] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[48:08] things unto himself Ephesians 2:15
[48:12] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[48:16] amen even the law of Commandments
[48:18] contained in ordinance for to make in
[48:21] himself of Twain one new man so making
[48:26] peace amen that he might reconcile both
[48:30] unto God in one body by the cross having
[48:33] slain the enmity thereby and came and
[48:37] preached peace Amen to you which were a
[48:41] far off and to them that were nine amen
[48:45] another place in the Bible it says that
[48:47] God has called us to peace amen peace
[48:51] ought to be something that is very
[48:54] dominant in our life it should be pred
[48:57] dominating amen over us amen is peace no
[49:01] matter the storms and no matter the
[49:03] trials and no matter uh whatever we have
[49:06] every promise has been given to us Amen
[49:09] to let us know that we are still secure
[49:12] amen if the winds are blowing you're
[49:14] still secure amen if you're going
[49:17] through the fiery furnace you're still
[49:19] secure amen whatever you're going
[49:21] through you're still secure for the God
[49:24] of Peace amen amen uh uh has you in his
[49:29] hands amen Psalms 55 and8 Heath
[49:34] delivered my soul in peace from the
[49:37] battle that was against me for there
[49:40] were many with me or against
[49:44] me and so we find that this king of
[49:47] peace is also called the king of saints
[49:52] amen not only is he the God of Peace and
[49:54] the king of Peace but he is is the king
[49:57] of saints and and and you'll find that
[50:00] there in Revelations 15 and and three so
[50:04] what that means is that we are under his
[50:07] domain now amen and and he has to say so
[50:12] amen as Colossians 1 uh uh the first
[50:16] chapter I believe 123 maybe of of where
[50:20] uh it it talks about that Christ amen
[50:23] has died for us that he might have the
[50:26] re emance in us and over the church amen
[50:30] because he is now the king now now that
[50:33] is a privilege to us that that if you're
[50:35] the king of the country amen or or
[50:38] you're under a country then you're under
[50:40] the laws of that country you're under
[50:43] the protection of that country ain't
[50:45] that right well we are under the domain
[50:49] uh uh uh or the domain of the king amen
[50:52] a peace amen and we do that but and we
[50:56] become that by the Paul would tell us by
[50:59] one Spirit are we all baptized into one
[51:02] body ain't that right and therefore the
[51:05] prophet would tell us we are now we are
[51:08] now citizens of the kingdom of God Amen
[51:12] so that's what the Church of the Living
[51:14] God is we're citizens aren't you glad
[51:16] for that you're citizens yes you may be
[51:19] in in a where we're in a Strange Land
[51:22] but we're citizens amen and God's domain
[51:25] can reach all the way from eternity down
[51:28] into time amen and and control every
[51:31] situation of our lives and he is the God
[51:34] of Peace ain't that right so so in the
[51:37] Old Testament the known church was
[51:39] called the kingdom of God which is God's
[51:42] kingdom amen and in in other words uh uh
[51:46] uh God is a king he's the king of
[51:49] righteousness he's the king of peace and
[51:52] the church is uh uh is his domain if you
[51:56] ever want to see God in his power and
[51:59] his authority and his mighty acts watch
[52:01] him move in the church amen because
[52:04] that's his domain ain't that right amen
[52:07] yes sir and so that means that the devil
[52:09] has no say over us amen God has the
[52:12] final say ain't that right yes sir see
[52:16] and so in the New Testament the church
[52:19] is called the Messiah uh Messianic U uh
[52:23] empow Empire uh that's what the church
[52:25] is and other words the messiah's Empire
[52:29] where the Messiah rules and Reigns so
[52:32] that's what the church is today the
[52:34] Church of the Living God is Messiah
[52:37] Empire amen where Messiah rules and
[52:41] Reigns I am so glad for that Amen
[52:45] brother brandom said there's no
[52:47] denominational bearers or nothing see in
[52:50] the church for messiah rules in his
[52:55] Empire amen see so we may be uh in the
[52:58] world but we're not of the world now
[53:01] notice uh uh I'm just going to read some
[53:03] quotes uh we as Christians as Christians
[53:07] as the church are only reflecting him
[53:10] amen see and who is he the king of Peace
[53:14] amen his domain is a peace his rule is a
[53:18] peace ain't that right amen so what you
[53:20] are here is a reflection of what you are
[53:25] somewhere else amen if your domain amen
[53:28] if you're under the control of Satan
[53:31] well then you're going to reflect that
[53:34] amen if if and and there's only two
[53:36] places that people are going it's heaven
[53:38] or hell ain't that right that and that's
[53:40] just facts it's just Heaven and Hell
[53:42] you'll never be just obliviated and and
[53:44] be nothing after you die you're going to
[53:46] one place or the other amen and if
[53:48] you're going to heaven you're going to
[53:50] reflect that where here not when you get
[53:53] over there you're going to reflect where
[53:55] you're going
[53:57] here and if you're going to hell you'll
[53:59] reflect that here Amen in this life see
[54:04] so what you are here is a reflection of
[54:07] the place you're going somewhere else
[54:10] see he said I do not believe that
[54:12] Christians uh consist of joining
[54:15] churches or Creeds I believe
[54:18] Christianity is a
[54:20] reflection of Jesus Christ in a human
[54:24] being another place Pentecost is an
[54:27] experience it's a reflection of Christ
[54:30] where he uh started on the day of
[54:32] Pentecost to reflecting himself through
[54:36] the people that's what Pentecost is it's
[54:39] not a an
[54:41] organization Pentecost is an experience
[54:44] where the king of peace is now
[54:47] reflecting himself in his subjects the
[54:52] people ain't that right in another place
[54:54] if you are reflecting by your mortal
[54:57] life the light of heaven then you're
[55:00] reflecting the eternal life God then
[55:04] when you die you can no more than go to
[55:06] that light because that's what you've
[55:09] reflected here on the earth ain't that
[55:11] right so then then then look at the
[55:15] reflection that we are to reflect Amen
[55:19] on this this Earth 1 Peter 3 and10 for
[55:23] he that will love life see and see good
[55:25] days let him refrain his tongue from
[55:29] evil and his lips that they speak no G
[55:32] let him isue evil shun evil and do good
[55:37] let him seek what peace and ensue it it
[55:42] pursue it always seek for peace ain't
[55:46] that right James 3:17 the wisdom that is
[55:50] from above is first pure then Peaceable
[55:55] gentle and easy to be intreated full of
[55:59] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[56:02] and without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[56:05] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[56:09] that make peace Hebrews 12:4 follow
[56:13] peace with all men now that doesn't mean
[56:16] compromise on your beliefs amen but but
[56:20] but avoid Strife avoid things that that
[56:24] would bring contention why because we
[56:27] are of a domain of Peace the king of
[56:30] Peace we are subjects of his ain't that
[56:33] right and we are reflecting another
[56:36] world we are reflecting another land we
[56:40] are truly reflecting the city that we're
[56:43] looking for so follow peace with all men
[56:47] and Holiness without which no man shall
[56:51] see the Lord amen Romans 14:19 let us
[56:55] therefore follow after the things which
[56:58] make for peace and I I I have to tell
[57:00] you there's only one thing that really
[57:02] brings peace and that's God Amen and and
[57:06] and the things of God the Eternal things
[57:09] amen only make for peace can you sayen
[57:12] guns don't make for peace amen you can
[57:15] have a whole closet full you can have
[57:17] every room your line walls lined with
[57:20] guns but that ain't going to bring peace
[57:22] you can have a a whole arsenal of bombs
[57:26] and and in the war chest and of of
[57:29] national uh security that ain't going to
[57:31] bring peace amen but there's one thing
[57:34] that will bring peace and that's the God
[57:36] of Peace follow after those things which
[57:40] make for peace can you say amen amen see
[57:44] so therefore make which make for peace
[57:47] and things wherewith one may edify
[57:51] another if we are under the domain of
[57:54] the king of peace and we are citizens of
[57:56] the city of Peace then we are to reflect
[58:00] peace amen ain't that right now brother
[58:04] Brandon made the following statement
[58:05] while praying he said May Our Lives be
[58:09] so submitted to thee and the Holy Spirit
[58:12] will or that the holy spirit will live
[58:15] itself through us and speak through US
[58:18] Lord may we remember in our minds as we
[58:22] walk up the street and rub arms with the
[58:25] world amen that we're not supposed to be
[58:28] like those man may we step aside and
[58:32] give them the place Lord and their
[58:35] rightful position here on Earth we'll
[58:38] take the back seat knowing that we are
[58:41] delicates from another world we have a
[58:45] kingdom that's coming into Power all of
[58:49] this world there's no F there's no sense
[58:51] in fussing over it am me King Nation
[58:54] fighting against Nation there's no
[58:56] reason to fight we've got another
[58:59] kingdom we're from above can you say
[59:02] Amen all these materialistic things
[59:04] doesn't matter anymore amen not to a
[59:08] true child of God that's been born again
[59:10] that's really looking for another city
[59:14] amen what is it that we gain the whole
[59:16] world and then die the second we gained
[59:18] it what does it do us can you say amen
[59:22] amen see so we'll take the back seat
[59:25] knowing that we are delegates From
[59:27] Another World we have a kingdom that's
[59:29] coming into Power Lord and our great
[59:32] king will soon arrive and take over all
[59:35] the kingdoms that's in his domain and he
[59:38] shall Rule and reign with him here on
[59:41] Earth thousand years and be with him
[59:44] forever aren't you looking forward to
[59:47] that time oh my that's why we can be
[59:50] humble that's why we can give things up
[59:52] we don't have to be first place and we
[59:54] don't have to have the best and we don't
[59:56] have to have that because we know we've
[59:58] got a city that's that we're going to we
[1:00:01] know that that the king is we've seen
[1:00:04] that King we're in the presence of that
[1:00:07] King amen and it speaks in our heart
[1:00:10] that there is a city amen and in that
[1:00:13] City we'll rule we'll reain it'll be
[1:00:16] ours the meek shall inherit the earth
[1:00:19] can you say amen amen see so we're
[1:00:22] looking uh for this city in one place
[1:00:26] instead of using the word looking Paul
[1:00:28] would use the word groaning we're
[1:00:31] groaning and and and and Romans 8:23 we
[1:00:35] ourselves grown everybody say groan we
[1:00:39] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:00:42] for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of
[1:00:46] our body oh if you only knew exactly the
[1:00:51] time that we're living in in the day
[1:00:53] this is the time of adoption amen and
[1:00:56] there's nothing left but the the
[1:00:59] Redemption of our body amen and and
[1:01:02] brother Brandon would say of this
[1:01:03] scripture he says see we understand this
[1:01:06] will take place at the first
[1:01:08] resurrection nature is groaning we are
[1:01:11] groaning everything is groaning because
[1:01:14] we realize something's not right there
[1:01:17] is no Republican that can make it right
[1:01:19] there's no Democrat that can make it
[1:01:21] right there's no M Earthly Messiah as
[1:01:24] far as what the world is looking for
[1:01:26] that can make it right there's no bomb
[1:01:28] there's no King there's nothing that can
[1:01:31] make it
[1:01:33] right right amen not in the way we're
[1:01:36] looking for it to be we realize that
[1:01:38] there's something not right and the only
[1:01:40] way you can grown and wait for it is
[1:01:44] because there has been New Life coming
[1:01:46] here that speaks of a new
[1:01:48] world Amen when the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:01:51] a man a woman boy girl there's something
[1:01:54] that begins to pul say within them I'm
[1:01:57] not here I don't belong here there's it
[1:02:00] causes us to to confess like a like the
[1:02:03] Old Testament Saints and those Saints
[1:02:06] before us that we're pilgrims and
[1:02:08] strangers in this land but we're seeking
[1:02:11] a city to come we're looking for it and
[1:02:15] we're groaning for it can you say say
[1:02:18] amen amen so then we find that the
[1:02:21] scriptures tell us that there is an
[1:02:23] eternal Kingdom and that Jesus Christ is
[1:02:27] the king in Luke
[1:02:30] 1:33 when the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:02:33] to Mary he makes the following statement
[1:02:36] concerning the Christ child and says and
[1:02:39] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:02:42] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:02:45] be no end it doesn't talk about Putin it
[1:02:49] doesn't talk about amen the United
[1:02:51] States it doesn't talk about Trump Biden
[1:02:54] doesn't he's not a Republican Democrat
[1:02:56] he's not of this Earthly Kingdom and all
[1:02:59] that but yet this child amen this Jesus
[1:03:03] Christ his kingdom there shall never be
[1:03:07] an End Amen now the the Jews thought
[1:03:11] that Jesus was to had come to set up his
[1:03:14] kingdom amen and and to reain so their
[1:03:18] their thinking was carnal amen because
[1:03:21] they thought that he was going to have a
[1:03:23] natural Kingdom a natural Throne a
[1:03:26] natural government a natural uh dominion
[1:03:30] and and so they expected him their idea
[1:03:34] of Messiah coming was that they expected
[1:03:37] him to overthrow the Romans and and to
[1:03:41] defeat them amen and bring peace to the
[1:03:44] Jews you know and and to the world and
[1:03:47] and things like that and and and yet but
[1:03:50] Jesus would tell them now he told pilate
[1:03:53] actually uh there in John 18 35 he said
[1:03:57] my kingdom is not of this world right
[1:04:01] amen so I'm not going to set up my
[1:04:03] kingdom the way governments set Their
[1:04:05] Kingdoms up and and I'm not going to you
[1:04:07] know I'm I'm not establishing my kingdom
[1:04:09] on that he said if my kingdom were of
[1:04:11] this world then my servants would fight
[1:04:14] that I should not be delivered to the
[1:04:16] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:04:19] hence amen his kingdom is not from this
[1:04:22] world it's not made up of this Earthly
[1:04:25] things ain't that right but see the Jews
[1:04:28] were blinded amen and they were blinded
[1:04:31] for our sake and therefore they could
[1:04:35] not recognize their day and hour amen
[1:04:39] and and they didn't understand the
[1:04:41] prophecy ain't that right amen see now I
[1:04:44] truly believe uh that the world is in
[1:04:47] the same condition right now that they
[1:04:49] don't understand the prophecy that is is
[1:04:52] is being fulfilled amen uh things that
[1:04:55] are happening to Israel right now is not
[1:04:57] by chance amen it's it's according to
[1:05:00] prophecy everything that is happening
[1:05:03] all the corruption and all the things
[1:05:05] that are going on in the politics and
[1:05:07] the the the the filth and and and the uh
[1:05:11] I mean it's just it's bad but it's all
[1:05:14] prophecy and yet people do not recognize
[1:05:17] their day and age and and and uh but I
[1:05:21] pray that that we do right amen see and
[1:05:24] so Jes Jesus had told the people of this
[1:05:27] this Le oysan age that they were blind
[1:05:31] amen and then Paul would say they are
[1:05:35] without understanding so living in this
[1:05:39] age seeing all the events that take
[1:05:41] place and yet without understanding
[1:05:44] because they are blind you see Jesus
[1:05:47] could not set up his kingdom a man in
[1:05:50] the days of his first coming he he
[1:05:53] couldn't uh uh because because it wasn't
[1:05:56] the right timing you see I I want to say
[1:05:59] this that you cannot force things to
[1:06:04] happen hello you cannot force things you
[1:06:08] cannot force world events to happen you
[1:06:11] cannot force Church events to happen you
[1:06:15] cannot force your personal things that
[1:06:17] are happening in your life you cannot
[1:06:19] make them happen you cannot force them
[1:06:21] to happen they will happen in God's
[1:06:24] timing
[1:06:26] there has been scriptures that have been
[1:06:28] laying here in this Bible just laying
[1:06:31] dormant waiting for the right timing it
[1:06:34] doesn't mean that God was slack it does
[1:06:36] not mean that well the Bible says that
[1:06:38] God is Not slack concerning his promise
[1:06:41] it it doesn't mean that God forgot about
[1:06:43] them but there is a timing for
[1:06:46] everything do you realize there's a time
[1:06:48] for your trial and there's a time for
[1:06:50] your Victory there there is a time for
[1:06:54] things to happen in your life we would
[1:06:56] call them seasons in our lives but they
[1:06:59] have to happen but they are a time and
[1:07:03] so the Jews without understanding they
[1:07:06] were trying to make prophecy come to
[1:07:08] pass without understanding the
[1:07:13] scriptures ain't that right you see God
[1:07:16] does things in his own timing he can
[1:07:18] give prophecy as he has thousands of
[1:07:21] years before they happen and yet they
[1:07:25] lay dormant waiting for the right timing
[1:07:28] God doesn't do things automatic he just
[1:07:31] does it he says it and we know and we
[1:07:34] trust him that it's all going to work
[1:07:39] out ain't that right so we we find they
[1:07:44] didn't recognize their day of visitation
[1:07:46] therefore they crucified him amen see
[1:07:50] and so if if a man doesn't recognize
[1:07:53] what God is doing do you realize the
[1:07:55] prophet said if he doesn't recognize it
[1:07:57] he'll actually turn against the very God
[1:07:59] he claims to serve if if he don't
[1:08:02] recognize God moving in his life now
[1:08:06] church God just doesn't stay with you
[1:08:08] just just when things are going good
[1:08:10] that's right he's with he says I'm Lo
[1:08:13] I'm with you
[1:08:17] always ain't that right but he that so
[1:08:21] so if you if you don't understand what
[1:08:24] God is doing
[1:08:26] you allow your heart to get bitter you
[1:08:28] allow your heart to get hardened
[1:08:31] amen but God has called us to a a a a
[1:08:34] peace that's right brother amenl peace
[1:08:37] can you say
[1:08:40] Amen we we find that second Peter 3 And1
[1:08:46] The Second Epistle beloved I now write
[1:08:48] unto you in both which I steer up your
[1:08:50] pure Mind by way of
[1:08:52] remembrance that you may be mindful of
[1:08:54] The Words which were spoken before by
[1:08:56] the holy prophets and of the Commandment
[1:08:59] of us the Apostles of the Lord our and
[1:09:01] savior knowing this first that there
[1:09:03] shall come in the last day scoffers
[1:09:06] walking after their our own their own
[1:09:07] lust and saying where is the promise of
[1:09:10] his coming ain't that right so this
[1:09:13] proves that they are without
[1:09:14] understanding that they are blind and
[1:09:17] they they don't know what's happening
[1:09:19] they're actually can see the prophecies
[1:09:21] all starting to fulfill prophecies
[1:09:23] that's been laying dormant from genis
[1:09:25] all the way to Revelations and now they
[1:09:27] are being fulfilled and they ask the
[1:09:29] question where's the promise where is he
[1:09:31] at it it just mindboggling but that's
[1:09:34] that's what happens when you're without
[1:09:36] understanding of
[1:09:38] scripture so we find that according to
[1:09:41] the Book of Daniel the reason why that
[1:09:44] Christ could not set his kingdom up at
[1:09:48] that time was because other prophecy had
[1:09:52] yet to be
[1:09:53] fulfilled now we had talked uh about
[1:09:56] this uh last Sunday and I'm going to
[1:09:58] continue with that but in Daniel
[1:10:01] 2:31 there there was this is a prophecy
[1:10:05] Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and he didn't
[1:10:08] understand the dream actually I think he
[1:10:10] even just forgot about the dream and and
[1:10:13] so he needed someone to not only
[1:10:15] interpret the dream but he needed
[1:10:17] someone to tell him the dream that he
[1:10:19] had and and he was troubled well then
[1:10:22] Here Comes Daniel Daniel was brought
[1:10:24] before him and Daniel Prayed and and and
[1:10:27] these things and God gave him amen not
[1:10:31] only the interpretation but showed him
[1:10:33] what the dream was and he said thou oh
[1:10:36] King sawest and behold a great image
[1:10:39] this great image whose brightness was
[1:10:42] excellent stood before thee and the form
[1:10:45] thereof was terrible this image's head
[1:10:48] was a fine gold now now we talked about
[1:10:51] it so we're going to move on but this
[1:10:53] this gold uh uh and Daniel says it uh
[1:10:56] this was
[1:10:57] Nebuchadnezzar uh his Babylonian Kingdom
[1:11:01] and then it says his breast and his arms
[1:11:04] of silver which was the kingdom of the
[1:11:07] mes and Persians his belly and his
[1:11:10] thighs was of brass uh which was the
[1:11:13] kingdom of Greece under Alexander the
[1:11:16] Great and his legs of iron which is the
[1:11:20] Roman Empire now we we find that when
[1:11:24] Jesus come first time who was in control
[1:11:27] it was the Roman Empire ain't that right
[1:11:31] see and so but yet it had not come to
[1:11:35] the the the the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[1:11:38] it had not come all the way uh as as we
[1:11:42] know now the two legs uh uh of iron it
[1:11:46] shows that the Roman Empire was to be
[1:11:49] made of two divisions main divisions so
[1:11:53] this is a prophecy this isn't just a
[1:11:54] dream
[1:11:55] it's it's it's God prophesying of the
[1:11:59] Gentile kingdoms uh and and of what was
[1:12:03] to come and so this is exactly what
[1:12:05] happened uh the Roman Empire literally
[1:12:08] split in two the East and the west and
[1:12:12] and and both were very powerful crushing
[1:12:15] all before them but then it went from
[1:12:19] the legs into the toes and and the feet
[1:12:22] and the toes and in the feet and the
[1:12:24] toes it was mixed with clay and and iron
[1:12:29] ain't that right a mixture see Daniel
[1:12:31] says his feet was part of iron and part
[1:12:34] of clay amen see so then we look at it
[1:12:38] the the former kingdoms uh
[1:12:41] Nebuchadnezzar the MS of the Persians
[1:12:43] and and um um uh Greece they they were
[1:12:48] pure minerals uh gold brass uh uh silver
[1:12:53] and and so uh uh uh the prophet would
[1:12:56] tell us and and we would know it but
[1:12:58] mineral and soil does not mix nor does
[1:13:02] it produce consistency or constancy and
[1:13:06] strength ain't that right so then the
[1:13:09] prophecy shows us that the Roman P
[1:13:13] Empire which is the last everybody say
[1:13:16] it's the last it's the last World Empire
[1:13:20] would
[1:13:22] endure because that was the iron right
[1:13:25] the iron in the legs and then the iron
[1:13:28] went into the feet and into the toes but
[1:13:32] when it got into the feet and Toes it
[1:13:34] was mixed with Clay right and so brother
[1:13:37] Brandon says that shows us that this
[1:13:40] last World Empire the Roman Empire cuz
[1:13:44] that was the last that went all the way
[1:13:45] to the toes amen would endure in its
[1:13:49] peculiar mix state right up until Jesus
[1:13:53] returns and is that right so again what
[1:13:56] Nebuchadnezzar and I'm going to just try
[1:13:58] to take some time because uh uh some
[1:14:01] most of you know what I'm talking about
[1:14:03] some have never maybe have heard it or
[1:14:06] uh need to be reminded or whatever but
[1:14:09] but what Nebuchadnezzar saw was all the
[1:14:12] Gentile
[1:14:13] kingdoms uh uh there starting in Babylon
[1:14:17] and and and and ending up in in the
[1:14:20] Roman Empire and and so but notice
[1:14:24] notice at the end of uh at at at when
[1:14:28] when when the the whole image was seen
[1:14:32] Then There came something else and it
[1:14:34] says Daniel says in the 34th verse thou
[1:14:38] sawest till that a stone was cut out
[1:14:43] without
[1:14:44] hands which smoke the image upon his
[1:14:48] feet that were of iron and Clay ain't
[1:14:52] that right see so and and break them to
[1:14:56] Pieces so if Jesus was to set up his
[1:15:00] kingdom at that time well then it hadn't
[1:15:03] come to the full effect of of the feet
[1:15:07] where where uh uh it the iron was mixed
[1:15:11] with Clay ain't that right see and we'll
[1:15:14] get into that more but says then was the
[1:15:17] iron notice then was the iron the clay
[1:15:21] the brass the silver the gold broke Bren
[1:15:25] to pieces together and became like the
[1:15:28] shaft of the summer threshing floors and
[1:15:32] the wind carried them away and that
[1:15:35] there was no place found for them and
[1:15:38] the stone that smoked that image became
[1:15:43] a great mountain and filled the Earth
[1:15:46] can you say amen that's right see and so
[1:15:50] then we find that Daniel gives the
[1:15:53] interpretation of the dream and he tells
[1:15:55] in the 37th verse he tells the king thou
[1:15:59] art this head of gold and he says in the
[1:16:02] 39th verse says after thee shall arise
[1:16:05] another kingdom inferior to thee which
[1:16:07] is the mes and Persians and another
[1:16:10] third Kingdom of brass shall bear rule
[1:16:13] over all the Earth see a world Empire
[1:16:16] which was Greece under the Alexander the
[1:16:19] Great and the fourth Kingdom shall be as
[1:16:23] strong as iron for as much as iron breth
[1:16:27] in pieces notice how that is it breth in
[1:16:29] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[1:16:34] iron that
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:55] prophecy they could have accepted the
[1:16:57] Messiah in the way he came see now iron
[1:17:01] is the hardest of these four metals
[1:17:03] metals and and iron signifies power and
[1:17:07] great destructive force against
[1:17:10] opposition ain't that right now so we we
[1:17:14] look at it uh the 41st verse it says and
[1:17:18] where as thou sawest the feet and Toes
[1:17:22] part of Potter's clay and part of iron
[1:17:25] the kingdom shall be divided but there
[1:17:28] shall be in it uh uh of the strength of
[1:17:32] the iron for as much as thou sawest the
[1:17:34] iron mixed with my Reay and as the toes
[1:17:39] of the feet were part of iron and part
[1:17:41] of clay so the kingdom shall be partly
[1:17:44] strong and partly broken now that's a
[1:17:47] significance because it's it's telling
[1:17:49] us of the day that we're living in
[1:17:51] that's right see so and whereas thou saw
[1:17:55] iron mixed with my Reay they shall
[1:17:58] mingle themselves with the seed of men
[1:18:00] but they shall not cleave one to another
[1:18:03] even as iron is not mixed with Clay
[1:18:06] ain't that right and in the days of
[1:18:08] these Kings shall the god of Heaven set
[1:18:11] up a kingdom see which shall never be
[1:18:15] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[1:18:18] left to other people but it shall break
[1:18:22] in pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:18:26] and it shall stand
[1:18:28] forever that's the kingdom that we're
[1:18:30] looking for that's the city that we're
[1:18:33] looking for ain't that right but it
[1:18:36] could not come until the prophecy was
[1:18:38] totally fulfilled of these four Gentile
[1:18:42] kingdoms ain't that right so for as much
[1:18:45] as thou sawest that the stone was cut
[1:18:48] out of the mountain without hands and
[1:18:50] that it break in pieces the iron the
[1:18:52] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[1:18:56] the great God hath made known to the
[1:18:58] king what shall come to pass Hereafter
[1:19:01] and the dream is certain and the
[1:19:03] interpretation thereof ain't that right
[1:19:07] so then we know by this dream and
[1:19:10] interpretation that when when it gets
[1:19:12] down we're not in the the the we're not
[1:19:15] in the age of the head of this image
[1:19:18] we're not in the age of in of of of the
[1:19:21] body or even the legs but when it gets
[1:19:24] down to to the T toes the the feet uh
[1:19:27] iron mixed with Clay the T toes then we
[1:19:31] know then we know that the end is
[1:19:36] nine then we know that God will turn
[1:19:40] from the Gentiles to the Jew the the
[1:19:43] Jews ain't that right then we know that
[1:19:47] time shall be no
[1:19:50] more hello that's right see why because
[1:19:54] the comes and hits the
[1:19:57] tolls the Gentile kingdoms are no more
[1:20:02] ain't that right when that Stone comes
[1:20:05] there the iron ain't going to be able to
[1:20:07] withstand that power of that that stone
[1:20:10] there's no Kingdom Gentile Kingdom I
[1:20:13] don't care how great of a superpower
[1:20:15] they are they cannot withstand the power
[1:20:18] of the
[1:20:21] stone yes sir
[1:20:24] it's then that God sets up his eternal
[1:20:29] Kingdom now this Kingdom that God is
[1:20:32] going to set up is not part of the the
[1:20:37] image that
[1:20:39] Nebuchadnezzar uh saw in his dream he
[1:20:43] only saw the four Gentile
[1:20:46] kingdoms which made up that image ain't
[1:20:48] that right and again the iron was the
[1:20:51] last of uh uh of the that image and it
[1:20:55] went all the way to the end of the uh uh
[1:20:59] Gentile kingdoms so then this city that
[1:21:03] we're looking for this this city of
[1:21:06] Peace has nothing to do with what we
[1:21:09] have here in this Mortal
[1:21:14] life man can rise up as we're seeing it
[1:21:18] in in in their election
[1:21:21] speeches better world
[1:21:24] better
[1:21:25] peace I'll provide
[1:21:28] it but there's only one Kingdom of
[1:21:32] peace and no man can set it
[1:21:36] up it takes the power of the stone to
[1:21:43] come you realize every Kingdom of this
[1:21:47] Earth is part of this Gentile as you'll
[1:21:52] see it's it it has to do with at all see
[1:21:57] so you remember that this city only

[1:23:46] anymore he does the same thing to this
[1:23:49] earth he goes through the same process
[1:23:52] can you say amen that's right see and

[1:24:02] architect

[1:24:35] us amen amen true brother and if you
[1:24:40] notice Revelations 22 and 2 in the midst
[1:24:45] of the street of it and on either side
[1:24:47] of the
[1:24:49] river was there the Tree of Life which
[1:24:53] bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her
[1:24:56] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[1:24:59] tree were for the healing of the Nations
[1:25:03] think of that now where is this at on
[1:25:05] the new Earth right that
[1:25:09] City amen it was healing for the
[1:25:12] Nations brother BR said see this is when
[1:25:15] the kings are living in
[1:25:17] peace here it's Nation against Nation
[1:25:21] right on now look look this thing's
[1:25:23] about to the the kake's about to
[1:25:26] explode he right Iran's already
[1:25:29] attacking Israel and and and I mean it's
[1:25:32] just it's we're getting going into World
[1:25:34] War II this thing's about to blow ain't
[1:25:37] that right but in this
[1:25:40] place in this place it's saying that the
[1:25:43] kings are actually living in
[1:25:46] peace there's a healing that takes
[1:25:51] place he says when they go out they'll
[1:25:53] pick a leaf a leaf off like that see
[1:25:57] like the dove come back see that the
[1:25:59] wrath of God it testified that the wrath
[1:26:01] of God had been settled and brought the
[1:26:03] holy leaf holly leaf into the ark so
[1:26:07] when the king see these leaves by
[1:26:10] bringing his glory into the bride's
[1:26:12] chamber here into the city see he'll
[1:26:15] hold a leaf to his neighbor King and
[1:26:19] that's a sign we're in peace forever
[1:26:21] more amen amen see it's healing
[1:26:25] everybody say healing heal of the
[1:26:28] Nations it's all settled ain't that
[1:26:31] right see one time we fought for one
[1:26:34] another's blood see and we cherished and
[1:26:37] hollered and shot and burnt children
[1:26:40] everything but now there is
[1:26:43] peace see that it's the healing of the
[1:26:47] Nations not disease healing not healing
[1:26:50] of our body that's all done with we've
[1:26:53] already been changed
[1:26:55] changed but this is healing of the
[1:26:58] Nations can you say Amen then you go in
[1:27:01] the third verse and there shall be no
[1:27:03] more curse Hallelujah talking about a
[1:27:06] peace God a city of peace there's no
[1:27:09] more curse the curse is lifted off this
[1:27:12] Earth the curse is lifted off the
[1:27:16] peopleall but the Throne of God and of
[1:27:19] the Lamb shall be in it and his servants
[1:27:22] Shall Serve him can you say amen amen
[1:27:26] see so this is why we don't get wrapped
[1:27:29] up in the
[1:27:31] politics we don't get wrapped up in the
[1:27:33] things of this
[1:27:35] life Christians Listen to me we don't
[1:27:38] get wrapped up in this stuff us Lord
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:43] amen there's no promise of a man that
[1:27:46] you should put your hope
[1:27:49] into going to surprise you on these
[1:27:52] days the world is looking for a messiah
[1:27:55] and they're going to get one
[1:27:59] true but the Messiah that God has sent
[1:28:02] them they reject it is true ain't that
[1:28:05] right on so what we are living in now is
[1:28:09] Satan's
[1:28:12] Eden that's why you know every nation on
[1:28:17] the earth is under his control and is
[1:28:19] his
[1:28:20] domain that's why there's jealousy as we
[1:28:23] read you know I talked about last Sunday
[1:28:26] demons even get jealous of one another
[1:28:29] Spirits get jealous of one another what
[1:28:32] causes the fighting it's
[1:28:35] Satan not the goip
[1:28:38] peat amen Satan loves turmoil he loves
[1:28:43] friction yeah he loves to
[1:28:47] destroy what the Bible says he come to
[1:28:49] do is to kill still and Destroy he'll
[1:28:52] destroy your faith he'll destroy your
[1:28:55] happiness he'll destroy your doctrines
[1:28:58] he'll destroy
[1:29:01] truth he'll destroy it to you if you'll
[1:29:03] let him that's right amen now if we go
[1:29:08] back to Daniel 7 and I hope this all
[1:29:11] right this morning yes Sir Daniel 7 and
[1:29:14] one in the first year of belshazzar King
[1:29:17] of Babylon Daniel had a dream and
[1:29:20] visions of his head upon his bed then he
[1:29:22] wrote the dream and told the sum of the
[1:29:25] matters Daniel spake and said I saw in
[1:29:28] my vision by night and behold the Four
[1:29:32] Winds of the earth strove upon the great
[1:29:35] sea and four great beasts came up from
[1:29:40] the sea diverse one from another now we
[1:29:43] know that Beast represents power so four
[1:29:46] great Powers rose
[1:29:48] up and and these powers are National
[1:29:53] powers political Powers ain't that right
[1:29:57] so Satan is the head of all national all
[1:30:01] political Powers amen he sure is and
[1:30:05] it's the power of the devil right so
[1:30:09] we'll go on into it the fourth verse the
[1:30:11] first was like a lion and had Eagle's
[1:30:13] Wings I beheld till the wings thereof
[1:30:16] were plucked this is speaking of
[1:30:18] Nebuchadnezzar actually and it was
[1:30:20] lifted up from the earth and made hand
[1:30:24] upon the feet as a man and a man's heart
[1:30:26] was given to it and behold another Beast
[1:30:29] a second like to a bear see a power and
[1:30:33] it raised up itself on one side and it
[1:30:36] had three ribs in the mouth of it
[1:30:38] between the teeth of it and they said
[1:30:40] thus unto it arise devour much flesh
[1:30:43] that's speaking of the me and
[1:30:45] Persians after this I beheld and lo
[1:30:47] another like a leopard which had upon
[1:30:50] the back of it four wings of a foul the
[1:30:53] Beast had also for heads and Dominion
[1:30:55] was given to it speaking of the Greece
[1:30:58] uh Alexander the Great and so forth
[1:31:02] after this notice I saw in the night
[1:31:06] visions and behold a fourth Beast
[1:31:09] Dreadful and terrible and strong
[1:31:13] exceedingly and it had great iron teeth
[1:31:16] it devoured and break in pieces and
[1:31:19] stamped the residue with the feet of it
[1:31:22] and it was diverse from all the beasts
[1:31:25] that were before it and it had 10 horns
[1:31:28] now we know that this that is the fourth
[1:31:30] power which brother brandom called Roman
[1:31:33] power and it's diverse from all the
[1:31:36] other powers for it was Dreadful
[1:31:40] terrible strong exceedingly and it had
[1:31:42] great iron teeth it devoured and break
[1:31:45] in pieces and stamped the residue with
[1:31:47] the feet of it ain't that right so then
[1:31:50] the last World power goes into the feet
[1:31:53] goes into the feet runs all the way into
[1:31:56] the toes to the end of the toes which
[1:31:59] means that that its power and influence
[1:32:02] is sp spread throughout the
[1:32:05] world right it has come to the T toes
[1:32:09] and it's spread out into the world the
[1:32:13] prophet say see that streak of ROM and
[1:32:15] iron Runs Out in every nation in the
[1:32:18] world
[1:32:20] today in every nation that streak of ru
[1:32:24] ISM goes out like in the 10 toes of
[1:32:27] Daniel's Vision
[1:32:29] right so after the Romans defeated
[1:32:34] Greece brother Bram says who's ruled the
[1:32:36] Gentile world ever since
[1:32:39] Romans that was the iron and then notice
[1:32:43] Rome everybody say Rome exists to the
[1:32:48] end because it went to the end of toes
[1:32:52] ain't that right so so I hope I'm not
[1:32:55] just repeating uh but but just to get it
[1:32:58] to us but we find that the the legs of
[1:33:00] the image was pure iron it was nothing
[1:33:03] but iron but then in the feet toes it
[1:33:06] was mixed in with with clay and
[1:33:08] therefore it was no longer a solid iron
[1:33:13] Empire uh uh because of the clay mixed
[1:33:16] into it and yet the prophet would tell
[1:33:19] us that it is still there this iron is
[1:33:23] still there even though it's mixed in
[1:33:24] clay it's running the Affairs of the
[1:33:29] world right now it's running the Affairs
[1:33:33] of the world in both democratic nations
[1:33:36] and the more despotic ones
[1:33:40] right this is prophecy sure amen see he
[1:33:44] could not set his kingdom up when they
[1:33:47] were just pure iron a Roman
[1:33:51] Empire on but here we are
[1:33:54] in the in the feet and Toes
[1:33:59] mixed there are of course uh in the feet
[1:34:03] uh he saw the 10 toes and and brother
[1:34:06] brandham brings this out in in in the 10
[1:34:09] toes and but it's including two big
[1:34:13] toes you and I again uh uh I I thank God
[1:34:18] for a prophet to allow let us give give
[1:34:21] us Insight but one of the big toes was
[1:34:23] was
[1:34:27] eisenh and his name means iron the other
[1:34:30] big toll is
[1:34:32] crof and his name means
[1:34:36] clay in
[1:34:38] 1960 there were five eastern Nations and
[1:34:41] five Western Nations that were assembled
[1:34:44] at the UN in
[1:34:47] 1960
[1:34:50] and these two main world leaders
[1:34:53] Eisenhower and
[1:34:55] kof uh they were there
[1:34:59] Koff he was he spoke for the five
[1:35:03] eastern Nations whereas Eisenhower spoke
[1:35:06] for the five Western
[1:35:08] Nations and of course you know the
[1:35:11] brother Braham talks about when this is
[1:35:13] when kof took off his
[1:35:15] shoe and and uh beat the desk with it
[1:35:19] right now brother Brandon says see now
[1:35:22] now this is significant for us because
[1:35:25] it's showing that we're not in the feet
[1:35:26] we're not in the legs we are in the the
[1:35:29] toes we're right here we're at the
[1:35:34] end and when kof done
[1:35:38] that what he did it showed that they're
[1:35:42] not going to
[1:35:44] mingle clay and iron ain't going to
[1:35:46] mingle they exist but they're not going
[1:35:49] to mingle so brother RM said see these
[1:35:52] two main leaders of the world these two
[1:35:54] big toes of the feet of iron and Clay
[1:35:57] were side by
[1:35:59] side yes now this is telling us just one
[1:36:03] of them but tells us exactly what time
[1:36:07] we're living
[1:36:08] in have you noticed I mean it was it was
[1:36:11] also at this time uh uh of in this age
[1:36:15] that Israel becomes a nation
[1:36:17] amen they're they're gathered from all
[1:36:20] around the
[1:36:21] world things are happening in the Middle
[1:36:24] East like never
[1:36:25] before look what's happening in America
[1:36:28] look what's happening in the
[1:36:31] churches that's right it couldn't happen
[1:36:35] until the end
[1:36:37] came
[1:36:40] hello now we're at the end no wonder the
[1:36:43] mighty angel of Revelations 10:1 has
[1:36:45] descended in this day declaring and what
[1:36:48] has he declared time shall be no more
[1:36:52] right amen right time shall be no more
[1:36:56] can you say
[1:36:57] amen I want to and I won't keep you much
[1:37:01] longer but I want to read Revelations 13
[1:37:04] And1 and I stood upon the sand this is
[1:37:07] John speaking I I stood up the sand of
[1:37:10] the sea and saw a beast rise up out of
[1:37:13] the sea now again this is the fourth
[1:37:16] Beast that Daniel
[1:37:18] saw and it it's a power rising up
[1:37:22] amongst the people Prophet said and
[1:37:24] having seven heads and 10 horns and upon
[1:37:27] his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads
[1:37:29] the name of
[1:37:31] blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was
[1:37:33] like unto a leopard and his feet were as
[1:37:36] the feet of a bear and his mouth as the
[1:37:39] mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him
[1:37:41] his power and his seat and great
[1:37:44] Authority ain't that right so it's at
[1:37:47] the end of the Gentile domain that all
[1:37:50] these beasts that Daniel saw separated
[1:37:54] are now represented in one brother Ram
[1:37:57] said it's the same old Devils demons
[1:37:59] that possessed each kingdom of the
[1:38:00] Romans down through the Greeks and so
[1:38:02] forth all the way down through the den
[1:38:04] spacation has come right on down and all
[1:38:07] met up in one Beast ain't that right
[1:38:10] yeah and I saw one of his heads as it
[1:38:14] were wounded to death what was this this
[1:38:18] exactly happened when Rome the in Roman
[1:38:22] Empire fail to The
[1:38:25] Barbarians and it looked as though Rome
[1:38:28] would no longer rule for she had lost
[1:38:30] her temporary power brother Bram says
[1:38:32] the nation that ruled by crushing all
[1:38:35] which became the strongest empire ever
[1:38:38] known was finally wounded to death her
[1:38:41] power was physically gone as to control
[1:38:44] by armies
[1:38:46] Etc and so as as the glory and power of
[1:38:51] of all empowers Empire s fail so this
[1:38:56] Empire this Roman Empire it it began to
[1:39:00] fall this uh uh Pagan Empire and it was
[1:39:04] no longer iron it it not that pure iron
[1:39:08] right it fell right but prophecy says it
[1:39:13] endured and kept going
[1:39:16] through so the iron was no longer pure
[1:39:20] and and if you notice the stone the
[1:39:23] stone
[1:39:24] that was not because the stone come
[1:39:26] rolling down the mountain for it had not
[1:39:28] rolled down the mountain it had not
[1:39:30] come
[1:39:32] hello so so so the end of pagan Rome uh
[1:39:37] uh it wasn't that because Daniel said
[1:39:40] that when the stone come and struck that
[1:39:42] image there would be no more there
[1:39:44] wouldn't be no more place for a gentile
[1:39:47] Kingdom it's over it's done time is
[1:39:51] finished ain't that right right
[1:39:53] and and and if the stone would have come
[1:39:56] then then the wound wouldn't have healed
[1:39:59] but here John saw that there was a wound
[1:40:02] he was wounded to death but then that
[1:40:05] wound was healed can you say Amen so the
[1:40:09] whis translation says that one of his
[1:40:11] head uh appeared to have been mortally
[1:40:15] wounded the throat having been slashed
[1:40:18] and his Deathstroke was healed and the
[1:40:21] whole world the whole earth f followed
[1:40:23] after the wild beast in
[1:40:26] amazement now the healing of this wound
[1:40:29] took place at NAA
[1:40:32] counil through Constantine ain't that
[1:40:34] right so Daniel's prophecy shows that
[1:40:37] this iron would continue to rule but it
[1:40:40] would not rule as Pagan Rome it would
[1:40:43] rule as paple
[1:40:46] Rome ain't that right I looked up the
[1:40:48] word paple it's relating to a pope or to
[1:40:51] the Roman Catholic Church so Nia Council
[1:40:55] swung the power of political Rome to the
[1:40:59] church brother BR says see people look
[1:41:02] at Rome they look at the nation of Italy
[1:41:05] and as they look they do not realize
[1:41:06] that Rome with her strict confines where
[1:41:09] the pope has an actual area as his
[1:41:12] domain is literally a nation within a
[1:41:14] nation she has ambassadors and she
[1:41:16] receives
[1:41:17] ambassadors he says see po Papa false
[1:41:20] Christian Rome she is even called the
[1:41:23] Eternal City how
[1:41:25] Blasphemous Now controls by
[1:41:28] religion even more ably than when Pagan
[1:41:32] Imperial Rome controlled by the pure
[1:41:34] iron of force Rome took on the a new
[1:41:37] lease of life when Constantine joined
[1:41:40] church and state and back the Union by
[1:41:43] force the spirit that motivated Pagan
[1:41:46] Rome is the same spirit that motivates
[1:41:50] now that now motivates the false
[1:41:52] Christian Rome
[1:41:53] oh my now you can see that is so because
[1:41:56] you now know that the fourth Empire
[1:41:59] never went out of existence it just
[1:42:02] changed in its outer texture can you
[1:42:06] amen amen and the very thing that caused
[1:42:09] the Roman Empire to succeed was divide
[1:42:12] and conquer divide and conquer and it's
[1:42:15] the same thing that has
[1:42:17] called Pap roome the church right to
[1:42:21] succeed through the ages divide and
[1:42:24] conquer divide and conquer ain't that
[1:42:27] right so brother Ram says see her iron
[1:42:31] teeth and and uh tore and devoured and
[1:42:36] whom she tore and deved could not rise
[1:42:38] again and that's why no denomination
[1:42:41] will ever rise again what Revival they
[1:42:44] had is no longer and never will come
[1:42:46] back into Revival it never it could not
[1:42:49] rise again as when she destroyed
[1:42:51] Carthage and sold her salt and the same
[1:42:53] iron seed remained in her when she arose
[1:42:56] as the false church and her policy has
[1:42:59] remained the same divide and conquer and
[1:43:02] you sayen and that power that she has is
[1:43:05] of Satan and he is the one who seeks to
[1:43:08] kill steal and destroy Revelations 13:7
[1:43:12] and says and it was given unto him to
[1:43:15] make war with the
[1:43:17] Saints and to overcome them and he did
[1:43:20] so I don't know have you ever read the
[1:43:22] foxes book book of Martyrs yes amen has
[1:43:24] anyone read the fox's book of Martyrs if
[1:43:27] you haven't you ought to go get the book
[1:43:28] and read the fox's book of Martyrs yes
[1:43:30] sir it's uh it's it's U it's it's it's I
[1:43:36] would say a
[1:43:37] mustre of what happened to the
[1:43:42] Christians but it was given unto him to
[1:43:45] make war with the Saints and to overcome
[1:43:47] them he burned them at the stake he
[1:43:51] flayed them alive the
[1:43:53] fed them to the Lions he killed them in
[1:43:56] any way possible that he could
[1:44:01] true Augustine of
[1:44:04] Hippo made it a rule that the church
[1:44:06] ought to and must use Force if necessary
[1:44:09] to bring her children back into the
[1:44:11] fold and that
[1:44:13] is it was in harmony with the word of
[1:44:16] God to kill the Heretics and apostates
[1:44:19] think about
[1:44:20] that as I close now
[1:44:23] in his controvers uh controversy with
[1:44:27] um uh donus I guess he wrote this it is
[1:44:33] indeed better that men should be led to
[1:44:35] worship God by teaching than that they
[1:44:38] should be driven to it by fear of
[1:44:40] punishment or
[1:44:41] pain but it does not
[1:44:44] follow that because the former course
[1:44:47] produces the better
[1:44:49] men
[1:44:50] therefore those who do not yield to it
[1:44:53] should be
[1:44:55] neglected for many have found Advantage
[1:44:58] as we have proved and are daily proving
[1:45:00] by actual experience in being first
[1:45:03] compelled by fear or pain so that they
[1:45:06] might afterwards be influenced by
[1:45:09] teaching so that they might follow out
[1:45:12] in act what they have already learned in
[1:45:14] word whilst those are better who are
[1:45:18] guided a right by
[1:45:20] love those are certainly more numerous
[1:45:23] who are corrected by
[1:45:26] fear for who can possibly love us more
[1:45:29] than Christ who laid down his life for
[1:45:31] the Sheep yet after calling Peter and
[1:45:34] the other Apostles by his words alone
[1:45:37] when he came to summon Paul he not only
[1:45:39] constrained him with his voice but even
[1:45:41] dashed him to the Earth with his power
[1:45:45] what a perverse
[1:45:46] thing and that he might forcibly bring
[1:45:49] one who is Raging ad mid the darkness of
[1:45:52] in
[1:45:53] infidelity to desire the light of the
[1:45:56] heart he first struck him with physical
[1:45:58] blindness of the eyes why therefore
[1:46:01] should not the church use force in
[1:46:03] compelling her lost Sons to return the
[1:46:06] Lord himself said go out into the
[1:46:08] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:46:10] come in wherefore if the power which the
[1:46:14] church has received by Divine
[1:46:16] appointment in its due season through
[1:46:18] the religious character and Faith Of
[1:46:20] Kings be the instrument by which those
[1:46:24] who are found in the highways and hedges
[1:46:26] that is in heresy and schemes are
[1:46:29] compelled to come in then let them not
[1:46:31] find fault with being
[1:46:34] compelled now brother Bram says of this
[1:46:36] man hippo uh a Augustine of Hippo that
[1:46:42] he had actually had an opportunity once
[1:46:45] to receive the Holy Ghost about under St
[1:46:49] Martin and yet he
[1:46:53] he refused to do that therefore he
[1:46:56] become too more child of Hell than he
[1:47:00] was to begin with and he moved down to
[1:47:03] hippo Africa and set his school there he
[1:47:06] was more interested in the dogmas of
[1:47:08] Rome till he couldn't receive the Holy
[1:47:10] Spirit and brother brandham said that's
[1:47:12] exactly what is happening today people
[1:47:15] are more interested in things of the
[1:47:17] world to where they can't even receive
[1:47:20] the Holy
[1:47:21] Ghost he says sometimes were so
[1:47:23] interested in
[1:47:25] time that we're brought right into the
[1:47:28] presence of the Lord Jesus and we turn
[1:47:30] and walk
[1:47:32] away but Augustine's if the musicians
[1:47:35] will come Augustine's verdict through
[1:47:38] the doors wide open for them to kill
[1:47:40] anything they wanted to then that denied
[1:47:44] the Pagan church and from that time of
[1:47:47] St Augustine about 300 years after
[1:47:50] Christ until 1850 the great Massacre of
[1:47:54] Ireland there was 68 million Protestants
[1:47:58] killed by the Catholic
[1:48:01] church that iron still
[1:48:03] rules yes and if you notice
[1:48:09] when Daniel looked in the 17th chapter
[1:48:13] or not Daniel but John in the 17th
[1:48:16] chapter of Revelations he saw a
[1:48:20] woman now he wasn't looking at a Beast
[1:48:23] he was looking at a woman and woman
[1:48:25] represents
[1:48:26] church and that deadly wound had been
[1:48:31] healed and you find in Revelations 13:7
[1:48:34] and power was given him over all
[1:48:37] kindreds tongues and
[1:48:40] Nations brother Brian said it never did
[1:48:42] become that way in Rome until Pagan Rome
[1:48:45] was converted into Papa Rome and
[1:48:48] Catholic power spread the world and made
[1:48:51] the universal Catholic Church
[1:48:53] can you say
[1:48:54] Amen Revelation 17:6 John says and I saw
[1:48:59] the woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:49:01] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:49:04] of
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:06] Jesus as we get into it you'll find
[1:49:10] there in the Book of Revelations
[1:49:14] that Not only was there
[1:49:18] four National Powers political powers
[1:49:23] that Rose you'll find in existence four
[1:49:26] religious Powers the White
[1:49:30] Horse the red horse the Black Horse and
