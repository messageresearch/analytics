of reading to the book of Philippians the second chapter and we do want to say God bless you this evening good to see brother Chad here with us this evening God bless you buddy and I've been a few days since we've seen him so it sure is good to see him and all the Believers here tonight I know it's a little cold on the outside but we're believing this evening for the warmth of the Holy Spirit to come on the inside and amen do something wonderful for us amen I I know it's a time of a very tribulation in the world but I still believe God meets with his Believers on a Wednesday night amen and ministers to him from his word and just tonight before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer and let's just ask the Lord to come by here tonight and and speak to us from his word Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here this afternoon we are very well aware that Lord we're not here by ourselves but Lord we are here surrounded by Believers but Lord there's also an unseen host that's in this building Lord I believe there's angels that have encamped themselves around about those that fear your name and Lord as we come here tonight we have you on Divine record where you've spoken said if any two or three would gather there in my name that there I would be in their midst and tonight father we're not gathered here in the name of a man we're not gathered here in the name of a church but oh God we're gathered here in the name that is above every name that that name every knee should bow and every tongue should confess and Lord I admit tonight that I am incapable Lord unable father to minister anything of my own self that would be a help to this people the Lord I acknowledge that there is a word that you've sent in this generation called the message of of the hour and Lord as I Surrender myself to you tonight God may you take these next few moments of time and Lord may we break out of this Earthbound realm dear God into that Heavenly realm where Lord angels will minister to his father Lord I pray if there be any sick among us tonight oh God may you heal them Lord if there have been abound tonight may you set them free if there be any discouraged oh God I pray that your spirit of Revelation would lift him up tonight dear God and encourage him father and Lord I pray you would forgive us of every failure and shortcoming oh God and Lord just draw us closer to thyself tonight and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says a man and a man the book of Philippians the second chapter I want to read the 12th verse of Philippians 2. everybody love the Lord here Paul here says wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to will and do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings my wouldn't that be a miracle do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke notice in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as light in the world now Paul has just identified that the Christians is the lights of the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I may not run have not run in vain neither labored in vain yea and if I be offered upon the sacrifice in service of your faith I joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also do you Joy and rejoice with me now if we could also look in the New Testament in the Book of Matthew the fifth chapter The Book of Matthew the fifth chapter I want to read a very very familiar portion of reading there in Matthew 5. we'll look at the 14th verse of Matthew 5. in the Bible here Jesus speaking says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick notice this and it giveth life unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works now notice this they're going to see your good works but that's going to cause them to glorify your father which is in heaven we ask Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to his night out of the book of Philippians the second chapter there I'll draw my title I want to speak to you on holding forth the Word of Life holding forth the word of life I'd actually been studying and praying in a totally different direction and I woke up this morning with these thoughts very heavy upon my heart so I just pray the Lord will come by tonight and speak to us from his word but I want to title this again as I said holding forth the word of life and if you look in the book of Philippians the second chapter I just want to read this to you maybe uh the the portion we read from the Amplified version he says so so then my dear ones just as you've always obeyed my instructions with enthusiasm not only in my presence but now much more in my absence continue to work out your salvation that is cultivate it bring it to full effect actively pursue spiritual maturity with all inspired fear and trembling using serious caution critical self-evaluation to avoid anything that might offend God or discredit the name of Christ now it is not now notice this for it is not your strength but it is God who is effectively at work in you both to Will and to work that is strengthening energizing and creating in you the longing and the ability to fulfill your purpose for his good pleasure do everything without mermaid or questioning notice this so that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and Godless innocent and contaminated children of God without blemish in the midst of a morally crooked and spiritually perverted generation how many will agree that we're living in a morally perverted and a spiritually amen perverted generation among whom ye are seen as bright lights amen beacons shining out clearly in the world of Darkness holding out and offering to everyone the word of life so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to Rejoice greatly because I did not run my race in vain nor labor without result now Amen brother bam says in a prayer and by faith Moses now we would ask Lord that you would forgive us of any mistake any sin of trespasser only Mission transgression any evil fault has pierced our soul by the fiery arch of the devil that you would drive away this enemy from thine and of thy people and we would ask that you would send the Holy Spirit to take a hold of the word at this time as we yield ourselves as instruments that you would speak through us and hear through US Thy word may we in return receive it as from thee and leave this place today feeling that we have been readjusted to the cause of Christ that we might be better fit for the service because of the visitation of the holy spirit so the prophet is actually praying amen that God would readjust the church amen back to the focus of the cause of Christ bless our Brethren everywhere and the churches across the world who is holding forth amend the Word of Life in this evil day how many will agree that we are living in an evil day we are living in a morally crooked Nation we are living in a spiritually perverse generation amen but there is a word that is coming to this generation and it's not the word of a man it is the word of God which is the Word of Life see amen we feel that there is not much time left to work for the for the night is swiftly coming and the war clouds are floating again evil is at hand and we pray that you'll let us work as never before notice just rest our tired bodies Lord and send us back into the battle for we ask it in the name of the Lord and we pray this in our name so in other words the prophet is saying that we are not in a natural battle or a national battle but we are in a spiritual battle we are facing spirits of the enemy that is coming against the church in the age that we're living in now this spiritual battle amen is what a prophet would call the battle for truth so in a in a morally crooked nation in a spiritually perverse generation amen there would actually be a battle that would be declared but it would not be a national battle it would be a battle for truth remember said in this battle for truth then M's has been lost but God said they would be restored again in the last day so then we are here tonight amen not to look at scripture not to just memorize scripture amen but we are actually here to fulfill the scripture I love what the problem of God says and what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ he said when this word has been spoken for this certain generation there is going to be somebody that will rise on the scene that'll fulfill the word because God has spoke it it's a Vindication of the spoken word amen Jesus meant every qualification and was the word he was Vindicated it as Messiah he said there is also words that are spoken in the Bible for the last day and those words have to come to life amen there were words that were laying there for thousands of years that was speaking of the coming of a messiah and when Jesus came on the scene amen he his body actually gave life to those words that were speaking of the coming of a messiah amen now come on Church cause there's words laying there it said there's going to be Overcomers and there's going to be people that are going to be more than conquerors there's a word laying there that said you're going to be the city that is going to be set on a hill listen friends God is not going to raise up Paul Amen to bring the promises of this aids to lie he's not going to raise up William Branham to bring the promises to life amen but he's got flesh here upon the Earth in the middle of a morally crooked nation in a spiritually perverted generation there is a bride upon the Earth who has received the message of the hour and that message has called her amen from the confusion of this world from the confusion of this nation into a place of fulfillment by the word of God listen I want to propose to you tonight that we don't just have the word amen we have the revelation of the word we don't just have the Bible and then we've got the god of the Bible can you say Amen if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst listen he says the power of God would have not faded as it did in those Dark Ages but right today somebody say right today right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again when the word when the church returns to the word amen the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be manifested and identified in the midst of the church again how many knows that every voice and every sign will come together amen there is a sign but the prophet said there would be a voice to the sign do you realize there was a sign of Malachi 4 do you realize what the voice of Malachi 4 was remember said the voice of Malachi 4 is return to the word amen the voice of Malachi 4 is return to the word then John 1 1 says in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God if you drop down to the 14th verse it says that the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen and we beheld his glory amen the glory as of the only begotten of the father amen which was what full of grace and truth now in other words you see here amen that God is a spirit right amen and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen then God which is a spirit amen which is the word amen came to flesh in Jesus amen by the spoken word in other words Jesus was not outside of the word he was not just a part of the word amen but Jesus is the word that's what the prophet says in the church age book we can see his association with the word amen he is the word how many would agree that Jesus of John 1 14 Jesus is the word that is who he is the word in his name in John 1 1 it said in the beginning was the word he said the root from which we get our translation from word is logos which means the fault or the ex-concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought expressed is a word or word isn't that wonderful so John says that the concept of God was expressed in Jesus amen the concept of God Amen was expressed in Jesus do you hear me the concept of God was expressed in Jesus amen then Jesus was the expression of God he was the expression of the deity of almighty god listen that's why Paul says in Hebrews 1 1 that God who at Sunder at times and diverse manners speak in times passing of the fathers by the prophets but half in these last days spoken unto us by his son which is logos whom he has appointed heir of all things but whom also we made the worlds who be in the brightness of his glory notice this the expressed image of this person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high remember says God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ amen Jesus was the expressed image of God Amen John 1 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the great spirit God unto which no man could approach which no man could see or could be hell amen was now tabernacled in flesh and was dwelling among men expressing the fullness of God to men among church amen don't let the devil tell you that Jesus was the second person of some godhead Trinity somewhere amen that he was a Lesser God Amen I propose to you that Jesus is God I propose to you amen that when you've seen him you've seen the father I propose to you amen that all that was in God he poured into Jesus and all that is in Jesus he has poured into the church in the last days come on Friends amen Jesus was the expressed image of God Amen but this bride and this wicked Amen in morally crooked nation and prosperously perverse generation this bride by the word has become the expressed image of almighty God in the age that she's living in she's not manifesting Creeds and pogmas and rituals and traditions she's manifesting the word I propose to you that you're a word born bride well we might as well preach we're here haven't we I propose to you that all that was in God was in Christ and all that was in Christ is in this building tonight by the baptism of the Holy Ghost no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is the bosom of the father he hath declared him remember said watch God who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or the pillar of fire that struck fear in the hearts of man this is God Amen this God whose heart characteristics were made known only by the revelation of words to the prophets has now became Emmanuel amen God With Us declared himself the word declare is taken from the Greek root which we often interpret as exeges which means to fairly explain and make clear that is what the Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God it revealed he revealed God to us with such perfect clarity that John could say about him in first John 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard what was heard was logos or speech which we have seen with our eyes we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ when God was truly revealed somebody say revealed when God was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh to fulfill the word amen he that has seen me has seen the father they were looking for the father amen and looking at Jesus and still saying amen show us the father amen but when the expression of almighty God came into human flesh it could no longer look at Jesus and say so is the father he could say when you've seen me you have seen the father I'm on churches in about 15 different tapes called sirs we would see Jesus and there's a people in the Earth today that's saying where is God who is God where is Jesus what is Jesus amen but I declare to you amen by the concept of almighty God that there is a bride here on the earth who has got the deity of God Amen tabernacled in her by the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on friends you may be in a wicked Nation you may be in a spiritually perverse generation but there's a gene seed on the inside of you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's been ignited in you and there's no wickedness there's no corruption there's no perversion that can stomp out amen the power of deity that lays on the inside of every believer oh my when God revealed himself he was manifested in the flesh I love this Amen in other words the message of the hour is the spiritual union of Christ and his church right now amen Jesus amen was the manifestation of God when deity met if Humanity was expressed in a man called Jesus which was more than a man brother Tim he was a God man amen and there's a bride here today who is more than a church she is more than a woman she is more than a bunch of members amen but deity has once again met with flesh and she has manifesting the thoughts of God that's why the prophet said in the visible Union if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin amen somebody took my place he said Jesus the word took my place he become thee that a sinner that I might become him the word then let me hold true to it amen not the church but the word we are not holding true to Men We are holding true to the word hold that spirit spiritual union of Christ in his church now listen to this where the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh amen listen you're not just here on a Wednesday night they've been taking up a couple hours hearing a few songs and reading a few scriptures amen but the world may not see it amen by word is becoming flesh and flesh is becoming word in the age we're living I'm on I know you may be discouraged I know you may be tired it may be a wish and I amen but let me prophesy to you by the word that old flesh that you're trapped in right now it's going to be changed one of these mornings by the Dynamics of almighty God will release a faith in you it'll change mortality back to immortality it'll take corruption and turn it back into incorruption we are not just a church we are word becoming flesh and we are flesh becoming word manifested and Vindicated what the Bible said what happened in this day it's happening day by day it's culminating so fast in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we are nearing the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word my where the word becomes the word then you are a mendeity revealed in flesh the world has always tried to find thought with the word we agree they've always tried to find fault with the word amen that's what led them to the first crucifixion Luke the 23rd chapter says when they will come to place which is called what Calvary There They Crucified him and the male factors one on the right and the other on the left Reverend preaches is called the indictment he says now there amen they not the sinner how many's heard that take then name it it's a powerful tape he says There They Crucified him they're the most religious place they the most religious people crucified killed him the most holy person there they crucified him notice this he said the Church of that day they found thought with the man who was the word is that right they found fault with the man and who was the word he turns that and says but now they find fault with a word that is working through the man two thousand years ago brother Bill they found fault with a word that was in the man he said but now they're finding fault with the word that is working through the man they just vice versa which is the person the Holy Spirit working through is God's Vindication now Jesus says this in Luke 11 chapter and the 21st he says if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils then no doubt the kingdom of God has come upon you remember picks us up in the indictment and says they take the very Calvary the very reason they know that it was the truth but because of jealousy or Prejudice what did Jesus say to them if I cast out the Devil by the Finger of God then who do you cast them out by let them be your judge see if I by the Finger of God cast out devils not just like you heard them say can you prove it's the Finger of God I'd like to see I heard that question ask him they were too smart for that notice because that he made himself God and he was God they were fined and fought with a man who had become the expressed image of the deity of Jehovah almighty God in flesh he said will not have him rule over us but now the thing the same old cry comes again listen Spirits don't die amen the same spirits that were crying amen 2 000 years ago on Mount Calvary on Golgotha is the same spirit that are crying in this age and instead of saying will we find fault with this man he said today they say that the Bible was written by man they say we don't have to live by it but that's God's word it's God himself he said I was talking to someone yesterday well some might have wrote the Bible some man I said yes there was his name we know him as God it was wrote in four thousand years apart almost the scriptures back from Job all the way to the New Testament and wrote hundreds of years apart and was wrote by differently and them not knowing the other in different parts of the country not one word of it will condemn the other listen I dare anybody to come under the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any problem is amen God is obligated to take care of it I say this tonight thank God for the Bible I say thank God for the word of God thank God for the Divine commentary amen that is coming to this age amen you say what is a commentary are you ready for this it is an expression it is an expression of an explanation about an event or a situation A Commentary is an expression or an explanation about an event or a current situation let me propose to you tonight amen that the Divine commentary of the word is the perfect interpretation of the word which was sent to us by God Amen through Vindication listen friends amen perfect interpretation is molding a character in this bride amen that is fit to rule and Reign that will Express the deity of almighty God Ma you say what you read it's important oh it's very important because what you read is what molds your character probably God said Abraham Lincoln amen didn't have any other books until he was 21 years old amen but the Bible and the fox's book of Martyrs he said see what you read most the character that you are no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines and vulgar and nonsense is placed up on their new stands amen look what those two books made him amen Abraham Lincoln become a man who changed the world he changed politics he changed situations that looked impossible how did he do it he did it by two books the Bible and the foxes Book of Murder oh God can I preach to you if Abraham Lincoln can be of successful politician amen by two books then what about the Church of the Living God I think there's some people here tonight I propose to you there's young people in this building that can be more successful than Abraham Lincoln ever dreamed about I propose to you that there's people sitting here tonight that can do more or amen than any politician ever dreamed about doing amen because they're not just reading the Bible amen they're under the influence of the Divine commentary of the expression of God that they're reading about my to think about a Divine commentary how can we not think about a man named Abraham the prophet said God just like you did to Abraham we know he had his frustrations and he staggered but when the Divine commentary of his life was written he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief amen but were strong given praise to God oh God he says let all my little staggers and misspelled words and mispronounce and so forth let the Holy Spirit just smooth it out and put a real Divine commentary in every heart of this message tonight how many would say God let my heart become the habitation of the Divine commentary of the word of almighty God in the age that I'm living in you say commentary I'm talking about a living commentary not talking about a book not talking about a tape I'm talking about flesh that has become the word and word that has become flesh look what Paul tells us in second Corinthians 3 he says ye are a pistol written in our hearts known in the red of all men for as much as your manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ amen ministered by US Written not with ink amen but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables have sown but in fleshly tables of the heart we find out the first church did represent him amen as written Epistles his life lift to those people he says I can't compare our church today as hard as it is to say as much as I love people you got to be honest they know they had been with Jesus he said because in Acts the fourth chapter amen we found two fishermen Peter and John amen and was healing the manifigate beautiful and was able to answer any question that the Sanhedrin had asked them amen yet they were ignorant and unlearned they could perceive they had no education they were not trained ministers they were fishermen but those people perceived that they had been with Jesus see because the way they was acting a in the same way he acted on them the way they were acting amen was the same way he acted on them then pray tell me what was Peter and John amen they were Expressions they were divine commentaries they were living explanations of what happened in the upper room listen Peter and John amen didn't write one book on how they received the Holy Ghost in the upper room amen but in Acts of fourth chapter amen a man got up off of his bed and he began to walk again amen and that was an explanation amen that God had visited Humanity again oh come on church we don't need another book we don't need another idea we need some flesh to get full of the Holy Ghost until Sinners and drunks and Saints everybody around us can know and people have been with God they've been with more than a Creed they've been with more than the tradition they've been with more than ideology they have been in the presence of God and they have become flesh the word has become flesh in their flesh their flesh has become the word we are determined here tonight that ain't meant to be a living Oracle of God to be a living commentary to be the word made flesh are you hearing me we are determined that I cannot propose to you we are determined tonight amen to preach the Full Gospel which is the word and to stay with it for it is the light of the day the Full Gospel the word of God is the light of the day the Full Gospel is the Holy Ghost Gospel but Amos I love this and it's tripping with blood the Holy Ghost Gospel has not lost its power to transform alive the holy ghost power is still dripping with blood amen you say what are you talking about I'm talking about the gospel which the gospel means what the good news you know what the gospel is it is the living reality it is the living commentary it is the living expression it is the living explanation of Jesus Christ amen the gospel unfolds to us in a FireFold manner what is five it is Grace you realize that the gospel unfolds to us in a FireFold manner it imposed to us in the living the dying the burying the rise and the coming if you want to know the gospel summed up Prosperity is brother chanted is the living of God it is the dying of Jesus Christ it is the rising of Jesus Christ among church amen it is oh God it is the living dying buried rising and coming of our Lord and his name is Jesus Christ that gospel has come into our hearts and that Full Gospel is not just affect our minds it's not just affected our feet the Full Gospel has affected both body and soul you say body Divine Healing Soul amen forgiveness and sin cleansing do you realize the Full Gospel has cleansed you to be a walking billboard of the grace of almighty God the Full Gospel has set you free from the condemnation of your past from the guilt of your presence from the sins of your life from the strongholds of a family curse hope God have mercy this gospel has still got power it's still got anointing it's still got Authority don't you water this gospel down to some psychology lesson amen present it like it was sent to us it wasn't sending her some dry intellectual form of some teaching or Creed it was sent to us under the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and I refuse to let anybody wanted this gospel down to a little social talk on the Wednesday night I say it may be wishing eyes amen by the same power that was in the upper room is flowing in this building tonight and what it did in the upper room it can do in Faith Tabernacle tonight my God is not limited to days on the calendar my God is the unlimited God he is the unchangeable god and when he moves he moves well somebody shot a man when he moves he moves my God has still got power my God has still got Authority the gospel has been manifested to produce a change in the church the good news has come to give light okay the good news has come Church to let a lost and Dying World know it may be crooked but not everybody's crooked the world may be perverse but not everybody's perverse well can we preach or what are you hearing me the world is in a bad shape but not everybody's in a bad shape the gospel Jesus Christ deity coming in humanity was manifested now watch this brother shamai it was manifested according to the scriptures the gospel was manifested according to the scripture in First Corinthians 15 verse 3 Paul says I'd live it unto you first all that which also received how that Christ died for our sins how did he die with Amos according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again on the third day how did he rise according to the scriptures how is he born according to scriptures how did he live according to the scriptures how did he die according to the scriptures how did he raise again according to the scripture how is he coming a second time amen according to the scripture among friends amen this is more than a book this is more than an idea amen this is deity this is powerful word that has come to claim you in the age you're living in someone told the Ram one time they said remember you're preaching way too much on the resurrection said every message you preach it's got something to do with the resurrection remember said well the resurrection is a powerful promise how many will say thank you brother Branham for not backing off of the promise of the Resurrection The Resurrection is a powerful promise amen it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did if he did not rise again from the dead then all of it was in vain but it is to me to prove that he was God it proves every claim he ever made the resurrection it is also the place of the resting place of the Soul it listen this the resurrection is the starting point amen and it's the crowning of our consolation amen the resurrection is the gospel amen it is the starting point of a Believer it is the crowning point of its consolation amen when we see that he rose from the dead can I preach to you now and I preached to you brother Bob when he see that he raised from the dead he said it notices it plays says us with the gospel armor at the Battlefront to take the place and to fight for we know he that will lose his life amen for my sake shall find it again you know why the devil hates you Sister Lisa as you have been dressed in the Robes of Resurrection you have been dressed by the sky okay brother Kevin you've been dressed Amen in the Robes of the resurrection and everything the devil throws at you it don't scare you it don't cause you to back up amen because she got started under the gospel and your crowning point of consolation is the gospel what are you saying I'm saying there's a people on the Earth that can no more die than God can because deity has come into humanity and the word has become expressed I know y'all forgive me I told myself I gotta I got on that preach you know it's a wish that I meet and I come out of the convention this week and y'all forgive me are you hearing me amen the resurrection is your promise Church the resurrection is what gives you the strength Amen to fight 200 000 000 Devils amen you know what the resurrection is it's a promise of your future are you hearing me it's a promise of your future regardless of your past and present oh God I come fresh honey write that down amen the resurrection is a promise of your future regardless of your presence regardless of your past amen according to the scripture he raised again on the third day oh I think remember I said I think it's the great coronation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection it's divine promises can I preach to you and the consolation they give to those who are trusting it for it promises you say the resurrection is a powerful promise here's what it promises the great Union of our uniting together again it promises the Fate in a way of all sin it promises the Fate in the way of all deformities all the sufferings that we have did in this life had to go through it with his life it promises The Vanishing of it all it promises that even death will lose its hold and will rise in the likeness of Jesus so to my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all promises in the things of the scripture amen there is where it's seated are you hearing me where we're Satan is in the promise of Resurrection according to the gospel what are you saying I'm saying that the message of the hour that we're following is according to the scriptures Life Death burial Resurrection coming was according to the scriptures the message of the hour is according to the scripture remember said see he said search the scripture Jesus told you that amen search the scripture and align your beliefs with the scripture I can't get bogged down here but Amos I preach all night remember some time or another we got to take our beliefs and not align them with what a man said amen but align them with the scripture amen search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and there they which testify of me do you realize you cannot make the scripture lie do you realize that God testifies amen of his gifts according to the scripture do you realize that the Miracles that we see done are done according to the scripture do you realize even the world conditions amen that we're living in and watching unfold we can forecast it by the scripture amen because the message of the hour has aligned our beliefs of the resurrection of the coming of God of the Resurrection of God has aligned our beliefs with the word by them to think tonight amen the scriptures have been revealed and people still can't see that it is the promised word remember saying now notices he said I cannot be a Catholic he said because they believe the word is inspired amen but they put the church over the word he said neither can I be a Protestant he said because they take just as much of the word as they want and only parts that are inspired amen so I believe what the Bible says to be the truth he said I believe that it's God's word in order to believe that I've got to surrender are you ready for this I've got to surrender my whole life and my whole will to that to believe that it is the truth that there's nothing else but the truth there's no more to be added to no more to be taken away what it says is what it's supposed to be now in order to do that I must believe that God's word is absolutely the truth can I stop here and ask you how many beliefs that God's word is absolutely the truth you believe that then with that faith in your heart you can walk over every devil you can cut your way through every situation are you hearing me amen because the strength is not coming from an intellectual it is coming from a revelation what are you saying I'm saying that will either accept the Full Gospel or will reject the Full Gospel and the prophet said it's right now midnight science says it's three minutes till midnight but this might be your Midnight Hour it's exactly on the dot 12 o'clock I don't know man this might be 12 o'clock midnight stroke for some of you you'll either accept it not accept me not accept what I said but except the Full Gospel the full power and the full Bible everything that God says accept it or it'll be too late so he was not presenting to you in the middle of a crooked Nation amen and a spiritually perverse generation he was not presenting himself to you he was presenting the word to you and saying you'll either accept the word or you'll reject the word oh my come on church amen because the Bible is what it is the word of life amen these words speak Joy these words speak peace these words speak happiness do you realize this Bible is the only book amen that tells us who we are where we come from and where we're going of all the fine literature that's in the world today the Bible is the only book that is positive the truth in the face of everything that's been published now brother I've heard a man say one time this he said listen here's the book of the Year remember said I said to that man to the radio I said I disagree I said there's one book of the year and that's the Bible of all the years past it's been the book of the year the years to come it'll be the book of Eternity it reveals it is God yes it reveals God every year that is to come it's the book of the Year listen look at the Bible tells us these things is to come speaks of all these hours that we've passed through that days of Noah predicted amen the days of Martin Luther predicted days of Wesley the age of Pentecost this hour that we're living in was predicted everything happened just exactly the way it was what is it it's the spoken word of God which is Vindicated by God makes it light of the hour see just like the sun is when the word are you ready for this when the word the word itself is the light when it's Vindicated for the time that it belongs to see it's Vindicated then it's the light of the hour so when the word becomes Vindicated it becomes the light of the hour that you're living in you hear me but the word Vindicated was Vindicated not in FL oh God Amen not in rocks and stones and trees amen but the word was Vindicated in flesh among brother Branson who announced the Messiah was on the earth in the days of John it wasn't a tree it wasn't a rock it was a man named John who was a 16 element born man that had a flesh body but the word that was spoken concerning him had become flesh I'm on Church who condemned who condemned Jezebel amen it wasn't a rock it wasn't a stone it was a man named Elijah amen who preached that's a god of Miracles is in the camp it wasn't a river it wasn't a mountain it was a man named Gideon who stood there and declared that god Jehovah has returned to the people of God oh God I can't hardly teach for preaching tonight do you see who you are you are the word made flesh and the eats you're living in he wasn't Elijah's lied but he was Elijah another form vindicating the light see that's when Jesus come what did he say he was a bright and Shining Light for a season but you loved to walk in his light and John said now I messed them out I must go out now my lights finish shining I must go out he must increase he's the light he said I am the light of the world the same yesterday today and forever what he why was he the light of the world if he had come said he was Messiah he didn't do like the Bible said the Messiah would do then he wasn't the light of the world but the Vindicated word makes it the light of the world can I tell you what a prophet said he's the light of the hour today the light of the hour today is Jesus Christ the seventh Church age all smooth out with Christ on the outside the Moon is identified at Darkness coming upon the Earth the light pressing in now begin the show what's taking place the thing will be destroyed and the light will come in and destroy it and the Saints shall inherit the earth and the meek shall inherit the Earth and the Earth and the moon will be took away the darkness of the night will pass away the darkness with their death and Creeds and away from the word of God perverted things are saying amen the light will break forth upon the day I'm on church do you see what your life is your life is a crucifixion to the darkness of leonacea your testimony is a crucifixion to a perverse Nation come on friends to a crooked Nation to spiritually perverse generation the testimony that you hold as a child of God is a testimony against the darkness of the age we're living in I love what program says he said remember when this full Bible has been thoroughly Vindicated then there will be an eternal Shalom an eternal peace amen there's one more word to be Vindicated he's got to vindicate more word and when the last word is Vindicated amen then death is swallowed up in Victory and the dead in Christ shall rise and the Millennium will set in and it'll be one great peace one great Shalom among friends amen living dying oh God Amen birth live and dine buried rise and coming was all according to the scripture then the same word that brought him to life was the same word that took him in the grave was the same word that raised him on the third day it's the same word that he ascended On High by that's the same word that saves your soul that's the same word that redeems your soul that's the same word that healed your body and that is the same word that'll cause all the deformities to fade away will cause all the sin to go back to the hell that come out of her and will cause an eternal Shalom when King Jesus king peace comes upon the Earth well somebody shout Glory I know it's wasting out but I feel good that's coming to the end of this wickedness there's coming to the end of this world that's coming into this chaos and confusion I'm on Church you're in position to see the Millennium by the word the word oh God the same word with Amos has saved you the same word that redeems you the same word will call you from the grave and if you go by the way the grave the same word can I preach to a minute that same word will change your body that same word will bring Abraham and Sarah out of the ground are you hear me brother brother Kevin the first man to ever die named Abel this word will call Abel out of the ground and he will not be in a corruptable body he will be in an incorptable body what are you talking about I'm talking about the word I'm talking about the word of life I'm not talking about a dead letter I'm talking about something that has become the expression it has become the explanation of the things of God look what David says here in Psalms 119 I love Psalms 119. it's a powerful chapter concerning the word let me pull a few things out here to you in Psalms 1 1989 David says forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven in verse 105 he says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and I lied into my path in a wicked in a perverse in a crooked Nation Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and I lied into my path look in verse 140 Thy word is very pure therefore thy servant loveth it look in 1 160 Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever then what did Jesus be expressed image of God the logos of God the concept of God what did he say when he come on the Earth he said he had a little while yes the lot with you but walk while you have lot less Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness so if not whether he goeth while you have the light believe in the light that you may be Children of the lies these things speak Jesus and departed and did hide himself from them remember said see when you get the Holy Ghost your god-centered God's daughter that's true enough but if you don't obey God Walk In The Light walk in the word believe God then you won't have any inheritance then come on Friends where brother Jr is this light leading the church it's not leaner to a former age it's not leaner to a day gone by the Light of the word is leading the church to its inheritance the light of the word is leading the bride to the Future home the light of the word oh God is leading the bodies to the theophany the life of the word is leading you to your space as the marriage supper of the land come on friends if you'll just follow the light you won't come up short if you'll just follow the line You'll see your way home let's say what are you saying I'm saying we can only walk in light as light comes to us amen I want to tell you this we have not been shorted when it comes to light amen we receive Luther's lies but it grew into Wesley's light amen and Wesley's light grew into a Pentecostal land amen but don't stop shorts of the full inheritance of their manifested sons and daughters of God Amen Luther's lights grew into Pentecost line and Pentecost line has grew into bright light brother shemaith and pray tell me who you are who are you you're not a Lutheran you're not a Wesleyan you're not a Pentecostal amen you're the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Tim pray tell me who are you you are the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm on church if you're falling Luther's light you're only going to get so far if you're falling Wesley's light you're only going to get so far if you're falling Pentecostal line you're only going to get so far but if you can ever turn northward and start pulling the evening timeline yet Moon just leads you to justification or sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will lead you to the person Jesus Christ the word will take preeminence in your flesh and you will become a living Divine commentary of the grace of God of the power of God of the truth of God listen friends in the evening time it shall be light when did when did Rebecca find Isaac when did Elisa call her to be the bride in the evening time it shall be light about the evening time the way to Glory you're surely find in the Waterway is a lot today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening lights has come are you ready it is a fact that God in Christ is one it's not an opinion no more Sister Janet is a verified fact that Christ hell God and God or one can I preach that song with a Terry under the influence of the bright light it is a fact that the invisible bridegroom has become one with the visible bride called Jesus Christ can I say what a prophet said it is a fact that this is the calling out of the Bride it is a factor this is the manifestation of the full restoration of the full power and full authority to the Sons and Daughters of God listen that was the beginning of it but now she's faded on in the bright light do you see what I mean do you see what I mean I'm on Church you want to be the happiest people come on Faith Tabernacle I know you may be discouraged and I remember I didn't come to discourage you I come to encourage you you got the light of the word come on you're not just living in any light you're living in the light of the age are you hearing me I might say it with me the light of the age somebody somebody prophesy with your own voice I'm living in the light of the age I'm living brother Chad I know the world's crooked I know the nation's perverse I know religion is corrupt amen but by the grace of God Judah a day star has arisen in my heart and a radiant to the power of Jesus Christ has broke out upon the face of the Bride we're not a bunch of depressed neurotics we are the Bride of Jesus Christ with an anointed word with a power and a pulsation come on I don't know about you amen but that devil may be all over you right now amen but I resent that therefore in the name of Jesus Christ he has no right to touch the Bride of Jesus Christ she is the clean bride she is the anointed bride she is the positionally placed bride are you hearing me she's the people who is walking in the light of the age then do you say oh God then you see what your defense is it is the promise of the Resurrection can I preach to you brother Sam whatever you go through you've been baptized in the Holy Ghost you got the gospel armor on you the promise of the Resurrection is your defense Mr Brook no matter what you face the promise of the Resurrection is your defense are you hearing me sister Anna no matter what you go through no matter what devil tries to come upon you your defense against that spirit is the promise of the Resurrection what are you saying I'm saying you're a people the devil can't do nothing with sister Mandy you're a force as the devil can't stop I'm on Church you'll become the word your flesh has become the word it's Unstoppable it's Invincible come on Friends resurrection power is not coming resurrection power is in you tonight the light of the age has opened your eyes oh my can I tell you like this you're not on the defense tonight you're on the offense come on now you're not on the defense you're on the offense the light of the age will place the believer on the offensive side you say what is a lot of the age can I propose to you that the light of the age is the mercy of the age the light of the age is the mercy of God to that age in other words men who refused to walk in the Light of Christ it's all for the message you know what they do they spurn Mercy they reject Mercy they reject light and accept judgment you say what are you talking about let's look in the days of Noah you know what was Mercy an ark to refuse the ark was to drown in the waters of judgment in the days of Moses you know what was Mercy was the token to refuse the token was to die under the Judgment of God when the death angel passed the lamb can I preach to you for a few minutes can I can I close can I take you from Moses and Noah all the way up to our day in this day to refuse the message of the hour is to refuse the light of the age is to walk in the tribulation come on Friends amen refusalize refuse Christ and your next thing is accept the tribulation but unto them oh God unto them that have been quickened by the grace of almighty God we have not refused the light we have received the light and we are following that light and thy word is it's a lamp into our feet the word of life is aligned to our path and it's leading us to the resurrection look every man that rejects light goes blind and walks in darkness you know why because you don't accept light amen God sends ministers who preach the gospel he sends signs and wonders among men to have indicate it to be the truth and Men reject it there's nothing left but Darkness for you so walk in the light while the lights are shining my brother receive the light Christ is the light he's come to bring light to you he's come to bring light to you but those who rejected receive darkness and every man and woman tonight who rejects light walks in darkness not knowing where he's going are you ready he's staggered along pretty good popular with people but wonder how he stands in the presence of God a man who rejects a light staggers along popular with the people but wonder how he stands in the presence of God I say what the Bible says this sin is the message which we have heard third are you ready for this and declare unto you that God is light and in him there's no Darkness if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we do lie and do not for truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another are you ready for this and the blood of Jesus Christ the Full Gospel the Holy Ghost Gospel that's tripping with blood the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin may I propose to you tonight we are the children of light we are not on our way to tribulation we're on our way to glorification we are not on our way to the Judgment we are on our way to Victory come on friends we are not on our way to tribulation we are on our way to rapture we are the children of light and the children of day we are not of the night Lord Darkness therefore let us not sleep come on now let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober you know what that word sleep means relaimus it means to yield to sloth and to sin it means to be indifferent to one's salvation upon the God said look he said we're living in the day we're promised for this day where are we we've moved on up the pillar of fire moves and the children of Israel mood with the pillar of fire or they went back to Egypt we have got to move with the word come on now we've got to move with the word can I say what he said and today we're getting so slothful the church he said is getting so early and so indifferent and their minds so muddled up with the television and we love sushi and some of these old things and staying home I guess right here on the end the van just comes out staying home they shows where the people's heart are you can tell them these things are wrong and they think you're crazy what is it Lover's a pleasure more than lovers of God but I I thank God we're following a prophet but the greatest pleasure I know of is to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the thrill of the church he said is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the God who made the promise standing Among Us fill his presence see his word see it Vindicated in ought to give Faith to make cripples walk blind sea death here and the dumb to speak we are not the children of Darkness we are not the children of a crooked Nation a spiritually perverse generation but God has come into our flesh by the new birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this wicked adulterous generation there is a people on the Earth who is holding forth the word of life you know if that word holding forth means I didn't even get to it but y'all give me Grace it means to take heed to you it means to pay attention to something it means to turn oneself to something and give full attention to it in other words there's a people who's going to give full attention brother Terry to the concept of God to the Divine commentary to the perfect interpretation you say brother what are you getting at I'm saying we are not walking an artificial light we are not walking in man-made light we are walking in the light of Jesus Christ remember he said see give yourself holy to this at every place we go we see Jesus he is now listen to this what a glorious thing it is for his church after 1900 years of almost 2 000 years ago to know that he lives we meet him on every Bend of the road and every turn at every place we go we see Jesus we see his presence flowing like a radiant light from his glorious Church the Living God how thankful we should be for that nowadays he says notice this he said the message given at the Tomb come see go tell first thing come and they'll be convinced nowadays people don't want to come and see those who do come can't sit 10 minutes five minutes sometimes and if you cross up their path they're gone come see don't just Peep in stand and look over it don't just peep into it stand and look over it because if you ever see Jesus you will never are you hearing me you will never you will never Wonder again if you ever see that Jesus is a revelation of God it'll put you in position to become the Revelation yourself when you've seen God you've seen Jesus and when you've seen this bride you've seen the bridegroom let our musicians come this evening do you love him tonight do you really love him you know what you are God's billboard you're gone to billboard in a crooked perverse generation hear God's

fan something you see what it is what Drew you there was a false advertisement then when you got there there wasn't nothing to keep you there [Music] the prophet of God was not making a mistake with what he was saying he was saying Christianity advertised today is not the gospel they'll hang across up there they'll put a picture of Jesus Christ on the billboard and they'll draw somebody in the building when they get in there you know what they'll find they'll find popcorn and coffee stands and ball games and movie Nights and they're literally thinking well I got all this at home remember said about the gospel ought to be priests in such a way he said that it appeals to the hungry he said the gospel ought to be priests and so it's a way he said that it appeals to Salvation of Jesus Christ I love this quote he says it like this he says now notice he said preach the gospel that raises Christ up in a living atmosphere right here around us now foreign [Applause] until it raises Christ [Music] right out of History and declares that the god of History is here in this present building tonight you love him tonight once you stand your feet with us [Music] I'm about you church
