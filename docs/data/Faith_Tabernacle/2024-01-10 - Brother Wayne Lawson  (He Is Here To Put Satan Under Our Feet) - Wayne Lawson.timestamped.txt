[47:03] meet the need of your children I think
[47:05] of the Prophet when he said Lord that
[47:07] you would come where you're
[47:09] invited well Lord I don't know there's
[47:12] probably bigger buildings or maybe a
[47:14] bigger crowd somewhere across this
[47:16] planet tonight but I don't know anywhere
[47:19] that you would be more welcome than you
[47:21] are here tonight in this place Lord our
[47:24] hearts are open to you and Lord your
[47:27] word means more than life to us your
[47:30] spirit Lord is the very breath that's in
[47:33] our bodies Lord and your children have
[47:35] gathered here they've gathered under
[47:37] this word Lord and I just ask you Lord
[47:40] that You' come and you'd meet the
[47:43] expectation of your children may you set
[47:45] your servant aside and Lord may you
[47:47] Quicken our mind to your word Lord and
[47:50] may you put inspiration in our words to
[47:52] speak to your children that Lord I ask
[47:55] ask you to help me so I can help them
[47:58] Lord now before this people Lord we
[48:01] confess our inabilities Lord and father
[48:04] anybody that would see this we want them
[48:06] all to know that we are nothing and have
[48:08] no abilities at all but Lord Jesus if
[48:11] You' take and use this tonight that you
[48:13] would use your word and you would touch
[48:15] your children we'll give you all the
[48:17] glory and the praise and the honor for
[48:19] you are preeminent Among Us Lord and we
[48:21] thank you and love you and we ask you
[48:24] now to take the platform Lord take your
[48:27] word and speak to the heart of your
[48:28] children we commit this service into thy
[48:31] faithful hands in the name of the Lord
[48:33] Jesus we pray amen and amen if you have
[48:38] your Bibles tonight we'd like to go into
[48:40] the book of Ephesians one more time amen
[48:43] and uh uh I'm sure uh uh maybe you'll
[48:47] get something different than the book of
[48:48] Ephesians tomorrow night amen but I just
[48:51] want to uh continue here Ephesians
[48:53] chapter 1 I want to read the 19th to the
[48:55] 23rd
[48:57] verse um you know what let's just back
[49:00] up to the 17th verse
[49:04] here that the god of our Lord Jesus
[49:07] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[49:11] you the spirit of
[49:13] wisdom and
[49:16] Revelation in the knowledge of
[49:19] him it's a very a tremendous thing there
[49:23] Paul was saying give the spirit of
[49:25] wisdom revelation of course you know
[49:26] brother BR said pray for Revelation more
[49:28] than anything else so he wasn't
[49:31] unscriptural and he knew that wisdom and
[49:33] Revelation was needed in the knowledge
[49:35] of God because that's the only way you
[49:36] can know him is through Revelation but
[49:38] watch the next verse but the eyes of
[49:40] your
[49:41] understanding being enlightened in one
[49:44] one of the translations it says let your
[49:46] heart be flooded with understanding that
[49:50] you may know what is the hope of his
[49:53] calling and what is the riches of the
[49:55] the glory of his inheritance and the
[49:56] Saints so he's asking for revelation of
[49:59] God and then he's asking Lord to Open
[50:02] the Eyes of the people so they can see
[50:03] their part in
[50:05] it and what is the exceeding greatness
[50:08] of his power toward us word who believe
[50:11] according to the working of his mighty
[50:13] power which he wrought in Christ when he
[50:17] raised him from the dead and set him at
[50:18] his own right hand in Heavenly
[50:21] places far above now somebody say far
[50:24] above far above far above all
[50:28] principality and power and might and
[50:31] dominion and every name that is named
[50:34] not only in this world but also in that
[50:38] which is to come and he hath put all
[50:42] things somebody say all things all
[50:44] things under his feet and gave him to be
[50:48] the head over all things to the church
[50:51] which is his body the fullness of him
[50:54] that filth all all in all amen may the
[50:58] Lord bless the reading of his word as
[50:59] you can be seated tonight amen and I I
[51:02] want to just use this for a title if I
[51:04] can he is here to put Satan under your
[51:09] feet to put Satan under your feet now
[51:13] we're here tonight realizing that this
[51:16] book of Ephesians of course is a
[51:18] parallel to the Old Testament Joshua so
[51:21] brother Bram uh brother Bram is is very
[51:23] clear in talking about that his ministry
[51:26] is a comparison to the ministry of
[51:28] Joshua and that the ministry would be
[51:31] bringing us into an Ephesians into the
[51:33] New Testament promises that was given to
[51:36] the church now brother BR said but we
[51:37] have come to another Paradox of an
[51:39] Ephesians in the last days and so we
[51:41] recognize that the leadership of God
[51:44] would lead the church into its position
[51:46] in the word of God and this is exactly
[51:48] what Paul is doing is he is positionally
[51:51] placing the church in God so that they
[51:54] can see the author Authority which he
[51:56] has invested into them and that of
[51:58] course gives us the right kind of faith
[52:00] when you can see and watch what Paul is
[52:02] saying when you can see what he is then
[52:04] you can see what you are when you can
[52:06] see what he has done then you can see
[52:08] what you can do because it's what has
[52:11] been done in him is what's been done for
[52:12] you now according to Ephesians here amen
[52:15] the Bible says that he has rought in
[52:17] Christ and raised him from the dead and
[52:20] set him at his own right hand in
[52:22] Heavenly places so to be able to
[52:25] understand uh what God has done for the
[52:27] church you have to exceed the great
[52:29] power which he exhibited in Christ when
[52:32] he raised a dead body from a tomb and
[52:36] placed him at the right hand of God
[52:38] that's the kind of power we're talking
[52:40] about the kind of power that can take a
[52:42] man that's dead cold dead in a grave and
[52:45] take him from that place of death all
[52:48] the way to
[52:49] immortality sitting on the throne of God
[52:51] that's the kind of power that's working
[52:53] in your life tonight that's the kind of
[52:55] power that's working upon the church
[52:57] tonight and you'll never understand that
[52:59] until you see that in Christ and then
[53:01] recognize that's the power that is
[53:03] working in you now he set him at his own
[53:06] right hand in Heavenly places amen now
[53:10] this of course when Paul was saying this
[53:12] you got to sometimes you got to stop and
[53:14] think about Paul and he's talking to
[53:16] these uh Ephesians and these Hebrews and
[53:18] he's trying to tell these people things
[53:20] but the but the the the we're we're
[53:22] reading the book of Ephesians which been
[53:24] written 2,000 years but Paul was reading
[53:27] from the Old Testament which had been
[53:29] written before his time and he was
[53:31] bringing the revelation of Jesus Christ
[53:33] currently from the Old Testament and he
[53:36] didn't have the book of Ephesians to
[53:37] read he was writing the book of
[53:39] Ephesians and it was given to the church
[53:41] so what he would be referencing would be
[53:43] Old Testament scripture so when he would
[53:45] say he was sitting at the right hand now
[53:47] y'all know what he's talking about from
[53:49] Psalms 110 it was David that wrote for
[53:52] the Lord said unto my Lord set thou at
[53:55] my right hand until I make thine enemies
[53:58] thy foot stol and the Lord shall send
[54:00] thy rod of thy strength of Zion and rule
[54:03] in the midst of thine enemies and the
[54:05] people shall be willing in the day of
[54:07] thy power and the beauties of thine
[54:09] Holiness from the womb of the morning
[54:11] for thou Hast a do of thy youth now the
[54:14] Lord has sworn and will not repent thou
[54:17] art a priest Forever After the order of
[54:20] mecdc now of course when David wrote
[54:23] this you know he's talking about amen
[54:26] this this great God that they're serving
[54:28] and that he was saying the Lord said
[54:30] unto my Lord now that confused a lot of
[54:32] of real educated and Theological people
[54:35] but we people who follow a prophet
[54:36] that's not confusing at all because
[54:38] brother Bram said it means the root and
[54:40] The Offspring of David he was both
[54:41] David's root and he was David's
[54:43] Offspring so that's just real simple to
[54:45] a Believer amen but what he was saying
[54:47] here was that that God would raise up
[54:50] Jesus Christ a man to sit at his right
[54:53] hand now here's the thing they all
[54:55] prophesied this and they believed that
[54:57] prophecy and of course they heard
[54:58] Abraham talk about MDC and what was
[55:01] written in Genesis concerning him and
[55:03] that the Messiah would be the son of
[55:04] David he would also be the son of
[55:06] Abraham and they and that was all good
[55:08] as long as there was no man involved in
[55:11] that but when Jesus Christ amen when his
[55:14] name started getting involved in them
[55:16] scripture it was different see see when
[55:18] you go to Psalms 100 psalm 16 you'll
[55:21] find here in the eth verse David said I
[55:24] have set the Lord all always before me
[55:25] because he is at my right hand and I
[55:27] shall not be moved therefore my heart is
[55:30] glad and Glory rejoices for my flesh
[55:32] shall also Rest In Hope and thou will
[55:34] not suffer leave my soul in Hell neither
[55:37] will thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[55:39] corruption for thou will show me the
[55:41] path of life and then the presence of
[55:43] Joy at thy right hand is Pleasures
[55:46] forever
[55:47] more amen now what Paul is discussing is
[55:51] he's discussing that all of this
[55:54] Messianic Prophecy of the right hand of
[55:56] God Amen now he's saying that Jesus has
[56:00] been lifted up and is setting at the
[56:02] right hand of God this man whom they're
[56:05] not willing to receive as the Messiah at
[56:07] all Paul is now exalting him to the
[56:10] authority and the Throne of the Living
[56:13] God Paul is teaching them anything
[56:16] you're going to get from God is going to
[56:18] have to go through Jesus Christ you're
[56:20] going to have to get it in the name of
[56:22] Jesus or you're not going to get it at
[56:23] all because he sets at the right hand of
[56:26] God now it's according to the Book of
[56:28] Mark in the 16th chapter it said then
[56:30] after the Lord had spoken unto him he
[56:32] received him up into heaven and sat on
[56:35] the right hand of God and they went
[56:37] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[56:38] working with them and confirming the
[56:40] word with a signs and following now
[56:42] according to the book of Acts when Peter
[56:44] was preaching on the day of Pentecost he
[56:46] brings Psalms 100 psalm 16 into into his
[56:51] thought I don't know if you've ever read
[56:52] it but Peter's sermon is quite powerful
[56:54] won't read it all to you but let me read
[56:56] you from the 29th verse down to the 36th
[56:59] men and Brethren let me freely speak
[57:01] unto you of the patriarch David for he
[57:04] is both dead and buried and his supplier
[57:06] is with us unto this day therefore being
[57:09] a prophet I like that David's a prophet
[57:11] wasn't he he said and knowing that God
[57:13] has sworn with an oath to him that the
[57:16] fruit of his loins according to the
[57:18] flesh he would raise up Christ to set on
[57:21] his throne he seen this before spake of
[57:25] the resurrection of Christ that his soul
[57:27] was not left in Hell neither his flesh
[57:29] did see
[57:31] corruption this Jesus hath God raised up
[57:35] wherewith we are all Witnesses therefore
[57:37] being by the right hand of God exalted
[57:40] and having received of the Father the
[57:42] promise of the Holy Ghost had shed forth
[57:44] this and you now see and hear for David
[57:48] is not ascended un the heavens but he
[57:51] saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord
[57:54] set thou at my my right hand now we're
[57:55] in Psalms amen 110 he says until I make
[57:59] thy fools foes thy foot stol therefore
[58:03] let all of the House of Israel know
[58:06] assuredly that God hath made this same
[58:09] Jesus whom you've crucified both the
[58:12] Lord and the Christ do you see see David
[58:15] right here Peter is tying together
[58:17] Psalms 11:0 and psalm 16 and he's saying
[58:21] it was fulfilled in Jesus Christ because
[58:23] David don't said it right hand of God he
[58:26] said but Jesus Christ has been raised up
[58:28] and sits at the right hand of God now
[58:31] you see what Paul is saying that Jesus
[58:33] has been raised and set in Heavenly
[58:35] places now in Hebrews 12 and verse 2
[58:38] it's again that Paul would say he sat
[58:41] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[58:43] God in Romans 8 and 34 again he'll say
[58:46] it's Christ that died they rather that
[58:49] is risen again who Seth at the right
[58:51] hand of God in Colossians 3 and verse 1
[58:54] 1 again he'll say Christ sth at the
[58:57] right hand of God Hebrews chapter 1 the
[59:00] third verse he himself purged our sins
[59:03] and sat down on the right hand of the
[59:06] Majesty on high in Hebrews 8 and verse
[59:09] one he is sat down at the right hand of
[59:11] the Throne of the Majesty on high in
[59:14] Hebrews 10 amen this man after he had
[59:18] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[59:21] set down on the right hand of God isin't
[59:24] that beautiful Hebrews chapter 10 the
[59:26] 12th verse but this man isn't it
[59:28] beautiful what Paul did right there this
[59:30] man amen is't that something amen God's
[59:33] Throne we know is for a spirit but now
[59:36] the Bible is telling us there is a man
[59:39] setting on the throne of God oh Church
[59:42] you don't know what that means amen it
[59:45] means that Adam's race fell and they
[59:47] lost Authority but our Lord Jesus Christ
[59:51] amen regained the throne for the human
[59:54] race and tonight there is a man there's
[59:57] one of us sitting on the throne of God
[1:00:00] and he'll hold the position until all of
[1:00:03] the ransom Church of God is saved to sin
[1:00:06] no more I'm talking about Jesus Christ
[1:00:09] the son of God sets tonight in supreme
[1:00:12] authority in Supreme control over death
[1:00:15] hell and the grave he rules over every
[1:00:18] principality he rules over Powers he is
[1:00:21] the king of kings he is the Lord of
[1:00:24] lords he is above all things and there
[1:00:26] is nothing above his name his name is
[1:00:29] Jesus and there is nothing above
[1:00:33] him every name that could be named there
[1:00:36] is no name above the name of Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ amen we have a man on the throne
[1:00:44] of God according to 1 Peter chapter 3
[1:00:47] and: 20 to who has gone into the heavens
[1:00:51] and is on the right hand of God with
[1:00:54] Angel and authorities and Powers being
[1:00:57] made subject unto him oh I'll tell you
[1:01:01] tonight our Jesus sits in power amen
[1:01:05] I'll tell you he's our Lord isn't he
[1:01:07] amen do you know the prophet says here
[1:01:10] he says you know there's some of the
[1:01:11] verses of scriptures if you would
[1:01:13] isolate them you could make it sound
[1:01:15] like there was more than one God he said
[1:01:18] but see with a closer look at scripture
[1:01:21] it it would give you a better Prospect
[1:01:23] let's just look at the Scripture it said
[1:01:25] Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory
[1:01:26] and honor and power for thou H has
[1:01:29] created all things and for thy pleasure
[1:01:31] they were created now notice carefully
[1:01:34] in verse two it says one not two or
[1:01:37] three but one set on the throne in verse
[1:01:40] three he said not they but but but not
[1:01:44] not not they but he was to look upon as
[1:01:47] jasper stone in verse n it says the
[1:01:50] Beast gave honor to him not them in
[1:01:53] verse 10 it says that the the elders
[1:01:54] fell down before him not them in verse
[1:01:57] 11 it says the Lord cried Thou Art
[1:01:59] Worthy oh Lord not Lords in verse 11 it
[1:02:02] says that one Throne was the creator
[1:02:05] which is Jesus in John 1 and3 which is
[1:02:08] the Jehovah Spirit god of the Old
[1:02:10] Testament Genesis 1:1 now let us not
[1:02:14] stop there go on and read Revelations 3
[1:02:16] and 21 to him that overcometh will I
[1:02:18] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:02:21] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[1:02:25] father in his throne amen so what you're
[1:02:28] looking at is he sat down at the right
[1:02:31] hand of God when John looked he only saw
[1:02:34] one upon the throne he say see it was
[1:02:37] not until Revelations 56 and8 that you
[1:02:41] see it which follows Revelation 4 2 and
[1:02:43] 3 in sequence now what's he saying that
[1:02:45] hym that set upon the throne what is it
[1:02:48] it's the mystery of one God Jesus came
[1:02:51] from God became manifested In the Flesh
[1:02:54] died and rose again and returned unto
[1:02:56] the bosom of the Father the only
[1:02:59] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[1:03:01] the father have declared him John chap 1
[1:03:04] and verse 8 what does the Bible tells us
[1:03:06] it tells us that Jesus overcame and sat
[1:03:09] down with the father in his throne he
[1:03:11] said I come from God and I've returned
[1:03:13] to God he is in the bosom of God tonight
[1:03:17] amen do you see there is a Corporal body
[1:03:19] in heaven tonight our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:22] A Nails scard Memorial amen our man is
[1:03:25] still in the heavens tonight sitting
[1:03:28] upon the throne of almighty God do you
[1:03:30] know the Bible teaches us that that same
[1:03:33] one that sits on the throne will have a
[1:03:35] day of power amen according to Psalms
[1:03:37] chap 10 110:3 that the people shall be
[1:03:41] willing in the day of his power now I
[1:03:44] don't know about y'all but I'm not
[1:03:45] looking for them people I believe I'm
[1:03:47] looking after people I believe the
[1:03:49] people that is prophesied to be willing
[1:03:52] in the day is setting k here tonight I
[1:03:55] believe there is a people on the face of
[1:03:57] the Earth that which God has
[1:03:59] pre-prepared you Amen to be vessels of
[1:04:02] the glory and honor and the power of the
[1:04:04] ministry of the son of man what good
[1:04:07] would it do for God to bring
[1:04:09] resurrection power in the church if
[1:04:11] there was no vessels to hold that power
[1:04:15] but I believe there are people tonight
[1:04:16] who are willing to receive whatever God
[1:04:19] is wanting to send we did not come here
[1:04:22] tonight just to be our own people with
[1:04:25] our own Ministries but we have come to
[1:04:27] surrender to the will of him that has
[1:04:30] sent his Mercy in this hour it is a day
[1:04:32] of power it is a season of power but
[1:04:35] there is a people who are willing to
[1:04:38] exhibit that power in its
[1:04:41] day in the day of his power oh my
[1:04:45] goodness I believe it don't you Jesus
[1:04:48] said in Matthew 28 that Jesus came and
[1:04:50] spoke and said all power in heaven and
[1:04:53] earth is given unto me and what did he
[1:04:56] do with that power he sent forth his
[1:04:59] church with that power all power and
[1:05:02] authority was given unto this church
[1:05:05] amen what was it brother bham you
[1:05:07] remember what he told us brother
[1:05:09] brandham was standing there on the river
[1:05:11] he said see it was not
[1:05:13] me I didn't do these things he said it
[1:05:17] was what I surrendered myself to do you
[1:05:20] see it's what he surrendered to he said
[1:05:22] I was only there when he did it remember
[1:05:25] that amen it wasn't me that spoke the
[1:05:27] squirrels it was he it wasn't me amen
[1:05:30] that healed Georgie it was he it wasn't
[1:05:33] me that gave Hade her children it was he
[1:05:36] who is he come on church he said I must
[1:05:39] decrease and he must increase when he
[1:05:42] the spirit of truth shall come who is
[1:05:44] that he it's he the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:05:48] the person of the token spirit that was
[1:05:50] prophesied to fall in the age we're
[1:05:52] living in what good would it do for God
[1:05:55] to send power if there was no vessel to
[1:05:57] exhibit power I I often maybe I could
[1:06:00] just say it to you like this what good
[1:06:02] would it do for the television station
[1:06:04] to send a signal tonight if there was no
[1:06:06] s television to receive the
[1:06:08] signal right but no television ever put
[1:06:11] forth a program that didn't come from
[1:06:13] somewhere so when somebody said well the
[1:06:16] game's playing at 9:00 tonight if
[1:06:18] there's no television on you would never
[1:06:20] know the game played and if God said I'm
[1:06:22] going to send power in a certain age if
[1:06:25] there was no Prophet on the scene to
[1:06:28] exhibit that power the power would have
[1:06:30] never been known to the church come on
[1:06:32] now the god that always was is the god
[1:06:36] that is he's always been the same God
[1:06:39] but he just shows his power in a certain
[1:06:43] season to bring you into the revelation
[1:06:45] of the age that you're living in it's
[1:06:48] what I surrendered myself to huj you
[1:06:51] remember it's not it's remember is it
[1:06:53] post pulsating to you deep call the deep
[1:06:55] is it pulsating to you this is not
[1:06:57] William brandom he's loaned his voice to
[1:06:59] me it's I the Lord remember it's a
[1:07:02] pulsation of faith that you are
[1:07:05] receiving amen that God brings it into
[1:07:08] the
[1:07:09] church now amen according according to
[1:07:12] the scriptures amen that Jesus has an
[1:07:15] Earthly body Jesus said I come from God
[1:07:18] I go to God is that right after his
[1:07:20] death his burial his resurrection
[1:07:22] Ascension that body was to set at the
[1:07:24] right hand of God now I don't mean God's
[1:07:26] got a right hand God's a spirit but the
[1:07:29] right hand means power and authority of
[1:07:31] God that is the name everything in
[1:07:34] heaven is named now you see that logos
[1:07:37] that was in him which was the spirit of
[1:07:39] God the anointing through the
[1:07:41] sanctifying grace of the blood brought
[1:07:43] many sons of God to be Anointed with
[1:07:45] that same
[1:07:48] logos to that same logos Jesus Christ
[1:07:52] the same 1961 he has to be the same in
[1:07:55] the attitude the same in power the same
[1:07:59] in everything except for the physical
[1:08:03] body it that sits at the right hand of
[1:08:06] God his spirit is here in us to manifest
[1:08:10] himself and to make our lives make it
[1:08:13] exactly what it was see that's what he
[1:08:15] promised the Holy Ghost when it is to
[1:08:18] come he will testify and show you things
[1:08:21] that are to come we know that is true
[1:08:25] yes sir he is the same in every
[1:08:29] principle tonight except for the
[1:08:31] Corporal body that body is setting in
[1:08:34] heaven that body is in the Throne of God
[1:08:37] Amen that body is there now brother bam
[1:08:40] will explain it to us and he'll tell it
[1:08:41] like this he said now listen things of
[1:08:44] this world predestinated but God called
[1:08:46] of God elected chosen of God saved by
[1:08:49] God baptized into the body of the Holy
[1:08:50] Spirit made members of the body we are
[1:08:53] alive we are ready and we are willing my
[1:08:57] shadow will move every time anything of
[1:08:59] my body
[1:09:00] moves and the Holy Spirit Body of Christ
[1:09:04] will move just as Christ moves and if
[1:09:07] Christ is in heaven and can if he could
[1:09:09] his physical body or spiritual body on
[1:09:11] the Earth moving he wants it to move
[1:09:13] watch for things to happen see it's
[1:09:16] beginning to come to life they paralyzed
[1:09:19] it long enough but the holy spirit is
[1:09:22] bringing life in into it now what's he
[1:09:25] saying he said see if I'm standing here
[1:09:28] he said and I'm moving he said my shadow
[1:09:31] on the earth is moving so you wouldn't
[1:09:34] if if I was here and you were seeing my
[1:09:36] shadow on the ground every time that I
[1:09:39] moved my shadow moved that down there is
[1:09:42] my movement that the people see on the
[1:09:44] earth brother man said you are his body
[1:09:47] that the people are seeing the shadow of
[1:09:50] a movement in the heavens he said if you
[1:09:52] paralyze the Shadow you have paralyzed
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ but listen I don't believe
[1:09:58] he's paralyzed tonight I believe he a
[1:10:00] living God with many members I believe
[1:10:02] he's got legs that still move I believe
[1:10:05] he got hands that still move he's got
[1:10:07] lips that still speak he's got eyes and
[1:10:10] still see I believe he's got young
[1:10:12] people I believe he's got preachers he's
[1:10:14] got Elders he's got sisters he's got
[1:10:16] people all kinds of people because our
[1:10:19] God is alive not just in heaven he's
[1:10:23] alive in the soul of the Church of the
[1:10:25] Living God listen your faith is going to
[1:10:28] paralyze the world or the world's going
[1:10:30] to paralyze your faith well let me tell
[1:10:32] you tonight I believe it's time to
[1:10:34] paralyze the devil it's time to paralyze
[1:10:37] unbelief it's time to paralyze doubt and
[1:10:39] let the power of the Holy Spirit move
[1:10:42] like it's never moved before in your
[1:10:44] life shake off amen shake off all the
[1:10:48] bands and chains of unbelief and let the
[1:10:50] Holy Spirit move in your life Hallelujah
[1:10:53] you're his
[1:10:56] shadow can you imagine amen a shadow
[1:10:59] telling a person they couldn't
[1:11:01] move that's the way it is in the church
[1:11:03] when we tell God he can't move I say
[1:11:06] there ought to be a people who are
[1:11:08] willing to move in the day of his
[1:11:12] power this is his day of power there's
[1:11:15] got to be a people who are under that
[1:11:18] power
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:22] operating now the life of Christ returns
[1:11:25] in the form of the Holy Ghost not a nail
[1:11:29] scar isn't that powerful the Corporal
[1:11:32] body sits at the right hand of God to
[1:11:34] make intercession but the Holy Ghost has
[1:11:36] come to carry out his
[1:11:38] works now how can people say that the
[1:11:43] apostolic age has ceased where do you
[1:11:46] get that at how can a Vine come out and
[1:11:49] bear today and go out and bear an orange
[1:11:51] tomorrow this Bear Day bear a pumpkin it
[1:11:54] would have to change his life and
[1:11:56] Malachi 3 said he did not change at all
[1:12:00] do you see brother man said how is it
[1:12:02] then could we teach the end of an
[1:12:04] Apostolic age amen when this is the can
[1:12:07] I say this would be the cendo of the
[1:12:10] apostolic age this would be the climax
[1:12:12] of the apostolic age if there has ever
[1:12:15] been a day of the apostolic age this
[1:12:18] would be the day the Bible said amen
[1:12:21] that I am the vine and you are the
[1:12:23] branch brother man said if this church
[1:12:25] ever puts forth another Branch he said
[1:12:27] it'll be an original Branch it'll be an
[1:12:30] Act Two church it'll be an original
[1:12:32] church with original work with an
[1:12:34] original vine with an original life I'm
[1:12:37] talking about a church that's ready to
[1:12:39] give way to the power of God Amen forget
[1:12:42] the Creeds forget the domination forget
[1:12:45] the ideas of man what about God working
[1:12:48] through the
[1:12:50] church Apostolic power people talk about
[1:12:54] Apostolic power brother bam said it like
[1:12:56] this he said if a body was growing from
[1:12:58] the feet coming up he said more
[1:13:00] important bodies from the feet into the
[1:13:01] lungs into the heart into the head who
[1:13:04] is the head Christ the
[1:13:08] intelligence now the
[1:13:10] body the government I'm in Isaiah 9:6
[1:13:13] now the government shall be upon his
[1:13:16] what that's exactly what happened in the
[1:13:19] quote brother B said the government is
[1:13:20] going to be upon the shoulder and the
[1:13:22] people H shoulders
[1:13:24] he said what is the
[1:13:26] shoulders his body now watch that's
[1:13:29] where the real true church speaks in
[1:13:34] power the apostolic power returns to the
[1:13:38] church when the government is upon his
[1:13:43] shoulders now you to preacher what are
[1:13:45] you talking about do youall know the
[1:13:46] headship of this church was the opening
[1:13:48] of that word it was the opening of The
[1:13:51] Seven Seals that brought headship back
[1:13:53] to the church we left the headship of
[1:13:55] the Baptist we left the headship of the
[1:13:58] Pentecostals we left the headship of the
[1:14:00] lutherans amen it was the end of the
[1:14:03] ages as far as inspiration was concerned
[1:14:07] and we moved to the prophetic of the
[1:14:09] word when the scriptures are being
[1:14:11] fulfilled and it brought Jesus back to
[1:14:13] the head of the church again can I just
[1:14:15] say it Willam brandom repositioned
[1:14:18] Christ as the head of the
[1:14:20] church amen he repositioned Christ as
[1:14:24] the head of the church and he said
[1:14:26] Christ is his word come on church and
[1:14:29] when the word is restored you now have
[1:14:33] original
[1:14:34] headship hallelujah it's back to the
[1:14:36] original headship of a word over a
[1:14:39] church hey that's where the real Church
[1:14:41] begins to speak in his power when the
[1:14:43] government is upon his
[1:14:46] shoulders amen now I go in the church
[1:14:48] book brother Ram said this we already
[1:14:50] see the visible manifestations of what
[1:14:52] I've been telling you you and you are
[1:14:54] seeing around us The ecumenical move and
[1:14:56] terrs is factual but also it is a fact
[1:14:59] that the prophet of the last age must be
[1:15:01] bringing forth a message of God that
[1:15:03] will forerun the second coming of the
[1:15:05] Lord and for by his message with a heart
[1:15:09] of the children be turned back to
[1:15:10] Pentecostal fathers with the restoration
[1:15:13] of word will be the restoration of
[1:15:18] power government on shoulders equals
[1:15:21] Apostolic power amen what is Apostolic
[1:15:25] power the faith of the Apostles has been
[1:15:28] restored to the church again amen what
[1:15:30] was it will I find faith when I return
[1:15:33] what kind of Faith Apostolic Faith the
[1:15:36] Faith of Our Fathers the book of Acts
[1:15:38] has got to live again church amen and
[1:15:41] God has said there would come forth in
[1:15:43] the last day a bride of that original
[1:15:46] Branch amen I believe it I believe that
[1:15:49] this Holy Ghost came I I I I hope you
[1:15:51] see what I'm saying the Holy Ghost come
[1:15:54] 2,000 years ago now come on the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost fell 2,000 years ago but watch
[1:16:00] what the prophet said he said but down
[1:16:02] through this 2,000 years he said it's
[1:16:05] been bound up it's been bound for 2,000
[1:16:08] years at the church has been bound the
[1:16:11] Holy Ghost for 2,000 years under modern
[1:16:14] under the church ages it's been bound
[1:16:16] not at the river Euphrates but the doors
[1:16:18] of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy
[1:16:20] Spirit can't work in the church because
[1:16:22] of man M systems but she's going to be
[1:16:25] liberated she's coming back that's what
[1:16:28] the Bible said do you see there'll be a
[1:16:30] people willing in the day of his power
[1:16:33] now you see that God could fill this
[1:16:35] room with the Holy Ghost amen but until
[1:16:37] somebody surrenders to that Spirit it
[1:16:40] will be powerless in this building
[1:16:42] brother bam said it over and over about
[1:16:44] Devils he said Devils don't have any
[1:16:46] power till they can get in a body until
[1:16:49] they can get into somebody so you can
[1:16:51] bind the devil tonight by that's by
[1:16:54] refusing him a vessel amen and God can
[1:16:57] come into this building tonight and if
[1:16:59] we refuse him a away amen he'll have to
[1:17:02] turn and leave the building amen but if
[1:17:05] we open up our hearts and we say God
[1:17:07] we're going to throw down every Creed
[1:17:09] we're going to throw down every feeling
[1:17:11] we're going to throw down every Dogma
[1:17:13] we're going to open up the doors and let
[1:17:15] God come in there's a power that will
[1:17:17] come in this church tonight and'll
[1:17:19] pardon every sinner it'll save every
[1:17:21] lost it'll change our children it'll
[1:17:24] change our liveses because there's a
[1:17:26] liberation of the
[1:17:28] word
[1:17:30] hallelujah this Holy Spirit has been
[1:17:32] bound by denominations for 2,000
[1:17:36] years but we have found out the
[1:17:39] scripture says there will be a day that
[1:17:42] was neither night or day now you know

[1:18:32] little bit and this person bickering
[1:18:34] with that person that person bicker and
[1:18:36] it wouldn't matter if you had if you had
[1:18:38] a it wouldn't matter if you had Ron
[1:18:40] Spencer
[1:18:42] preaching it wouldn't matter if you had
[1:18:44] brother W Martin preaching or brother
[1:18:45] Tim or Brother Don it wouldn't matter
[1:18:47] who was
[1:18:48] preaching the Holy Spirit could be right
[1:18:51] in the middle of it amen but it'll just
[1:18:54] get tight and you'll preach and you all
[1:18:56] you preachers now you'll preach and man
[1:18:58] you get to preaching so hard and it'll
[1:19:01] come up come up come up come up and you
[1:19:03] run out you just run out of strength cuz
[1:19:04] like you're lifting it yourself and all
[1:19:06] of a sudden you just let off for a
[1:19:09] second it's right back on the ground
[1:19:11] it's because that the anointing from the
[1:19:13] word is pushing it back but there's no
[1:19:16] Liberation for the spirit among the
[1:19:18] people so it's binding the Holy Spirit
[1:19:21] now you know he's here a prophet said he
[1:19:23] was the word said wherever two or three
[1:19:25] are gathered in my name there I am in
[1:19:27] the midst of them so something is
[1:19:29] abinding that Spirit look and it could
[1:19:31] be somebody's ill feelings it could be
[1:19:33] unworked out problems it could be
[1:19:35] disagreements in the body it could just
[1:19:38] little things working among people will
[1:19:40] bind that Spirit up well they done that
[1:19:42] not in the local church they' done it
[1:19:45] throughout the church ages and they made
[1:19:47] doctrines and they made Creeds and
[1:19:49] organizations and they barred the holy
[1:19:52] ghost from coming in the church so that
[1:19:54] man could lead and man could dictate oh
[1:19:57] but there was coming a day that will not
[1:20:00] be like that day but in the evening time
[1:20:03] there going to come light and there'll
[1:20:05] be a people on the Earth at the time of
[1:20:08] the coming of the power of God that they
[1:20:11] will say Lord let me Liberate the spirit
[1:20:14] of God I'll drop every Dogma I'll drop
[1:20:17] every Creed I'll drop every affiliation
[1:20:20] let the spirit of God move Among Us Lord
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:26] oh it's to be loosed in the evening time
[1:20:28] by the evening
[1:20:30] messenger woo hallelujah it's been bound
[1:20:34] by denominations for 2,000 years but the
[1:20:38] Holy Ghost is going to get loosed by the
[1:20:41] evening message in an evening time well
[1:20:44] let me tell you William Brandon was that
[1:20:46] evening messenger and this is the
[1:20:48] evening time and we are the evening time
[1:20:50] people and we have received of the Lord
[1:20:53] the loosening of the Holy Ghost and now
[1:20:56] the
[1:20:59] church has received a
[1:21:04] loosening we've had enough power to join
[1:21:06] Church put our name on the book but in
[1:21:10] the evening time that same great power
[1:21:13] of Christ would come upon his church
[1:21:15] like it did in the
[1:21:17] Eastern the Western would be the same
[1:21:22] May isn't it powerful things brother
[1:21:24] Braham has to say the holy ghost that
[1:21:26] come with power and manifestation and
[1:21:29] demonstration of his presence he says
[1:21:32] see there would not be one cruel word
[1:21:34] spoken against any move of God we'd all
[1:21:38] be one and one great big bundle of Godly
[1:21:41] love that's what it's going to take for
[1:21:43] the church to go in the
[1:21:45] Rapture I don't know about y'all I don't
[1:21:48] want to put my mouth against any of the
[1:21:50] move of God I don't want to hurt the oil
[1:21:52] I I don't want to hurt the wine I don't
[1:21:54] want to quench the spirit of God I want
[1:21:55] to get out of the way of God somebody
[1:21:57] said well I think that guy's this and I
[1:21:59] think that guy's this I tell you can
[1:22:01] learn something from the scripture
[1:22:02] remember remember when the scripture
[1:22:04] said it I think it what was the guy's
[1:22:06] name Nicodemus wasn't it amen when they
[1:22:08] said to him amen this is happening this
[1:22:10] is KF this is happen this is happening
[1:22:12] amen this is he said listen if it's of
[1:22:14] the Lord he said you're fighting God He
[1:22:17] said if it ain't of the Lord it'll come
[1:22:19] to nothing he said just let it go
[1:22:21] brother bam said it Let It Grow until it
[1:22:24] comes to the Harvest come on Church Let
[1:22:27] It Grow till it comes to the Harvest if
[1:22:29] it ain't of the Lord God in a harvest
[1:22:32] time will separate the two together but
[1:22:35] until that time leave it alone and let
[1:22:37] it grow let God work it out who's where
[1:22:40] and how's what's going to be but I'll
[1:22:42] tell you this Amen in this age that
[1:22:44] we're living in amen it's an evening

[1:22:49] time that we have crossed over the human
[1:22:52] the ologies we have went beyond
[1:22:58] denominational now what's happening
[1:23:01] now brother B said all these things have
[1:23:04] darkened the eyes of the
[1:23:08] people theyve darkened these things from
[1:23:11] the Christian's eyes they darkened
[1:23:13] Divine Healing it darkened the power of
[1:23:16] God it darkened all the gifts of God and
[1:23:20] they applied it back there to when the
[1:23:22] Sun was shining and what brother Bram
[1:23:25] saying he said they said it was all back
[1:23:26] there in the days of the
[1:23:28] Apostles you remember brother Bram going
[1:23:30] to a Mee and sitting down he sat down to
[1:23:33] next he said it was some fell I forget
[1:23:34] what denomination it was he said but we
[1:23:36] were watching a Divine healer preach and
[1:23:38] brother B said he said the guy set mide
[1:23:40] him said you know he goes change clothes
[1:23:43] every time he gets to sweat and he got
[1:23:44] somebody come out and wipe his
[1:23:46] brow brother bam said oh really well
[1:23:48] that's good he said something B said
[1:23:49] well I think he gets a new car every
[1:23:51] year brother br said he just kept
[1:23:53] picking he said he said now see what it
[1:23:55] was was really what it was he's against
[1:23:58] that Divine Healing he said and he
[1:24:00] wanted me to get on him get in with him
[1:24:02] on picking on that preacher cuz he was
[1:24:04] standing for Divine Healing he said I
[1:24:06] seen what was behind it and you see
[1:24:09] sometime people and they pick here and
[1:24:10] pick here and pick there but you got to
[1:24:12] be smarter than that you got to look
[1:24:14] behind what's behind the thing amen
[1:24:17] sometimes just use your discernment and
[1:24:19] look a little bit deeper and see that
[1:24:22] it's the devil trying to destroy the
[1:24:25] works of God Amen because there's men of
[1:24:27] God in this age that are standing for
[1:24:30] the power of God sure you can pick on me

[1:24:42] screams for the power of God for the
[1:24:44] liberty of God for the prayer lines for
[1:24:46] the baptism of the spirit for the moving
[1:24:48] of the Holy Ghost sure shoot me down
[1:24:51] amen but what do you shooting down when
[1:24:53] you do I tell you what we got men of God
[1:24:55] in this age I think we ought to Rally
[1:24:58] around the spirit of God I think we
[1:25:00] ought to leave the cruel words for the
[1:25:02] devil somewhere and get behind the
[1:25:04] moving of the Holy

[1:25:29] eye darkening the eye of the
[1:25:33] people from Divine
[1:25:36] Healing and Supernatural works of God

[1:27:02] moment in the twinkling of an eye you

[1:27:30] way to a new
[1:27:32] body the very thing that denomination is
[1:27:36] fighting is the power of God and it's
[1:27:38] the very thing that will change your
[1:27:44] body clouds of
[1:27:47] Doubt Clouds Of Darkness nervousness and
[1:27:51] de
[1:27:53] depression settle on the people look at
[1:27:56] it look at it in the end time look
[1:27:57] what's happened amen but do you not know
[1:28:00] there's prophecy in this Bible that in
[1:28:02] the evening time there should be light
[1:28:05] look at this then Mark the 16th chapter
[1:28:07] say it and Jesus said I am and you shall
[1:28:10] see the son of man sitting on the right
[1:28:13] hand of power coming in the Clouds Of
[1:28:17] Heaven oh there's been clouds of Doubt
[1:28:20] but there's another kind of CL coming
[1:28:23] it'll be a Cloud of Glory and a cloud of
[1:28:26] power and anointing that comes on the
[1:28:28] church look at Luke 22 and 69 Hereafter
[1:28:32] shall the son of man sit on the right
[1:28:33] hand of the power of God now if you're
[1:28:37] reading Luke
[1:28:38] 21:25 and there shall be signs in the
[1:28:40] Sun and in the moon and in the stars and
[1:28:43] upon the Earth and distress of Nations
[1:28:44] and perplexity and the Sea of waves
[1:28:47] roaring men's hearts are failing for
[1:28:51] fear look looking after those things
[1:28:52] which are coming upon the Earth for the
[1:28:54] powers of Heaven shall be shaken and
[1:28:57] then look at this and then shall you see
[1:29:01] the son of man coming in a cloud with
[1:29:03] power and of great glory and when you
[1:29:05] these things begin to come to pass then
[1:29:07] look up lift up your heads your
[1:29:10] Redemption draweth
[1:29:13] nigh now we'll reread that 27th verse
[1:29:15] and then shall we see the son of man
[1:29:17] coming in the cloud with power and great
[1:29:19] Glory there's a lot in that scripture
[1:29:20] now because if you're just reading the
[1:29:23] scripture in itself now you could say
[1:29:25] well brother Wayne that's that cloud
[1:29:26] that come in Arizona or you could go
[1:29:29] over here in Revelations 1 and you can
[1:29:31] see he's coming with clouds of power and
[1:29:33] great glory and every knee shall bow and
[1:29:34] every tongue shall confess brother said
[1:29:36] which is not the Rapture it's just
[1:29:38] coming to the Jews right amen but look
[1:29:41] at the beauty of that both of those
[1:29:43] events are in Luke
[1:29:47] 21:27 you want me prove it to you turn
[1:29:49] to Matthew 24 what's the 49th verse
[1:29:52] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:29:53] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[1:29:56] the moon shall not give her light the
[1:29:58] Stars shall fall from Heaven the powers
[1:30:00] of Heaven shall be shaken now let's set
[1:30:04] you in the order of what brother Braham
[1:30:05] said in the Sixth Seal he said that's
[1:30:08] after the tribulation of those days
[1:30:10] that's not tribulation he said that's
[1:30:12] the pre-tribulation of ikan and Hitler
[1:30:16] he said on the Jews it's he said it in
[1:30:19] The Sixth Seal after that ikan affair
[1:30:21] it's immediately after the ikan affair
[1:30:24] the tribulation of those days shall the
[1:30:26] sun be darkened and the moon shall not
[1:30:28] give her light now do y'all really think
[1:30:30] that's all natural the Sun dark the moon
[1:30:32] not give us light what we're talking
[1:30:34] about is solar eclipse and and and and
[1:30:36] uh a moon eclipse two different eclipses
[1:30:39] there's a solar eclipse and also a moon
[1:30:41] eclipse now what what you're a lunar
[1:30:43] eclipse what you're dealing with and
[1:30:45] I'll just real quickly that's been
[1:30:47] happening for years but let's just say
[1:30:50] let's just say this is the Earth
[1:30:52] and let's say this is the Sun so what
[1:30:55] happens in a solar eclipse is the moon
[1:30:59] gets in between the Sun and the Earth
[1:31:04] the moon's the church right so the moon
[1:31:08] gets in between the two and the moon
[1:31:12] amen is there so the sun is darkened by
[1:31:15] the
[1:31:16] church Darkness shall cover the Earth
[1:31:20] and gross Darkness the people yeah but
[1:31:22] what's amazing is if you study this
[1:31:24] Eclipse you'll find that this type of
[1:31:27] eclipse that the sun itself doesn't give
[1:31:30] light to the Earth but there is a
[1:31:32] reflection coming through the Moon it
[1:31:35] makes the Moon look absolutely red so
[1:31:38] you can read it the Bible said it should
[1:31:40] be they call it Blood Moons right amen
[1:31:43] the the moon should be bloody what's it
[1:31:45] talking about when the church gets
[1:31:47] between the Sun and the Earth there's
[1:31:50] been solar eclipses for 2,000 years but
[1:31:55] there's never been a time that the Roman
[1:31:58] Church put itself between God and the
[1:32:03] people
[1:32:05] 1933 watch brother B begin them eclipes
[1:32:07] and remember what he said there in 63 he
[1:32:09] said Pope John just went to
[1:32:12] Jerusalem he said Jerusalem types the
[1:32:14] natural church he put the lights out
[1:32:16] then the other eclipse is the is the
[1:32:19] church and the reason they can't get of
[1:32:21] light is because they have put the Earth
[1:32:25] between them and the Sun so the church
[1:32:27] itself has been darkened by it can't
[1:32:30] receive the sunlight it cut itself off
[1:32:33] from the Sun so the church is darkened
[1:32:36] and the darkened church now darkens the
[1:32:39] Earth so the people are left without a
[1:32:41] hope the sun won't give its light the
[1:32:44] moon has come to Darkness the stars have
[1:32:47] fell from the
[1:32:49] heavens prise the Lord amen now you
[1:32:52] y'all ain't they all been seeing fallen
[1:32:54] stars for years what does brother Bram
[1:32:56] teach that is if you go to Christ the
[1:32:58] mystery of God revealed brother B said
[1:33:00] that Fallen star was watch Luther a
[1:33:03] messenger an angel of God a star and
[1:33:07] they fell in
[1:33:09] denomination and John Wesley fell in
[1:33:12] denomination and stars begin to fall The
[1:33:16] Sun Won't Give it light the moon will
[1:33:19] not be able to BR bring reflection
[1:33:21] what's going going on it is a spiritual
[1:33:23] happening amen even the powers of Heaven
[1:33:26] had become shaken but the Bible said
[1:33:28] then shall appear the sign of the son of
[1:33:32] man in heaven now watch semicolon and
[1:33:36] then shall the tribes of the earth mourn
[1:33:38] and they shall see the son of man coming
[1:33:40] in powers of heaven with power and great
[1:33:42] Glory two different events in the same
[1:33:46] scripture the sign of the son of man in
[1:33:48] heaven giving us a Cloud of Glory and
[1:33:50] power but there shall also be something
[1:33:53] appearing to Israel of glory and power
[1:33:56] and honor but the Church of the Living
[1:33:58] God will be gone in the sign of the son
[1:34:01] of man if you got that picture of the
[1:34:03] cloud you can pull it up right now amen
[1:34:05] what is it amen It's The Sign of the son
[1:34:07] of man in heaven now now now look when
[1:34:10] you look at this I want you to realize
[1:34:12] something amen that what is happening
[1:34:15] here is something that's being shown in
[1:34:17] the heavens before it happens on the
[1:34:20] earth we see the sign of the son of man
[1:34:23] in heaven but now we'll see the sign of
[1:34:26] the son of man on the earth what is it
[1:34:28] it's the sign of of the resurrection
[1:34:31] power of Jesus
[1:34:33] Christ sir now I'll tell you what's
[1:34:35] powerful if you if you like to read your
[1:34:37] Bible now brother B said you see see the
[1:34:39] son of man coming in cloud with power
[1:34:41] and great Glory when these things begin
[1:34:43] to come to pass look up you see your
[1:34:45] Redemption draweth nigh and over here in
[1:34:47] Zechariah the 14th chapter it says it
[1:34:50] shall be one day shall be known to the
[1:34:52] Lord not day or night but it shall come
[1:34:54] to pass in that time shall be light now
[1:34:56] he ties together the Book of Luke and
[1:34:59] the book of Zechariah watch in trying to
[1:35:01] do God a service he said there shall be
[1:35:04] signs in the heavens above when this
[1:35:06] begins to take place earthqu in di
[1:35:08] places and there appear a sign in heaven
[1:35:10] of the son of man then that day Luke the
[1:35:13] son of man will reveal himself again and
[1:35:16] be revealed himself so he's placing that
[1:35:19] Luke 17:30 with Luke chapter 21 and
[1:35:22] verse 27 and he's tying the two events
[1:35:25] together to let you know something is
[1:35:28] going to happen on Earth but it's been
[1:35:30] declared in the heavens at the same time
[1:35:33] that denomination is bringing a cloud of
[1:35:35] Doubt to Brock the sunlight out God has
[1:35:39] brought the sign of the son of man to
[1:35:41] bring the resurrection power back upon
[1:35:44] the church there shall be a day of power
[1:35:47] like no other age has ever seen there
[1:35:49] will be an exhibition of the baptism of
[1:35:51] the the holy ghost in the power of the
[1:35:53] token it will take a restoration of the
[1:35:55] word of God to bring the church back to
[1:35:58] this kind of power we shall know who we
[1:36:00] are we shall know what we are about we
[1:36:03] shall know what we are to do amen

[1:36:11] day not a gloomy
[1:36:14] day when that white wigged one come on
[1:36:17] when that white wigged one shows up now
[1:36:20] look at the beauty of this folks folks
[1:36:22] now we we ain't left our subject watch
[1:36:25] this white wig one show up how many
[1:36:26] knows this is Daniel the 7th
[1:36:29] chapter Bible readers now if you're
[1:36:32] reading Daniel 2 do you remember
[1:36:35] Nebuchadnezzar's dream and he had a
[1:36:38] statue do you remember what destroyed
[1:36:40] that statue a stone out of the
[1:36:44] mountain those same Kingdoms in Daniel 7
[1:36:48] are represented as creatures right and
[1:36:51] what is it that destroys those creatures
[1:36:54] the Ancient of Days the Ancient of Days
[1:36:57] of Revelations 10 is also Daniel 2 the
[1:37:02] stone hewed out of the mountain amen it
[1:37:05] is the thing that destroys the work of
[1:37:08] the devil Satan for 2,000 years has
[1:37:12] worked to take the church out of the
[1:37:14] power of God but here in the last days
[1:37:18] God would bring a sign that would
[1:37:20] destroy everything things Satan has done
[1:37:22] in 2,000 years come on now come on we
[1:37:25] got to get we got to get to the
[1:37:27] scriptures let's look and see as look
[1:37:29] back in the Garden of Eden and look what
[1:37:31] Satan done here Eve stood in power but
[1:37:34] Satan come in and took the word away
[1:37:36] from her and the minute the word left
[1:37:38] her she was thrown down into death but
[1:37:41] as she was thrown into death there was
[1:37:43] prophecy that come on her and it said
[1:37:45] thy woman's seed shall bruise the head
[1:37:47] of the serpent oh that laid there in the
[1:37:51] scripture a woman's seed shall bruise
[1:37:53] the head of the
[1:37:55] serpent but we don't see that
[1:37:57] manifestation for 4,000 years and for
[1:38:01] 4,000 years Satan is working and he's
[1:38:04] working and he's working and he's
[1:38:06] working and 4,000 years of work oh but
[1:38:09] when Jesus Christ the son of God was
[1:38:12] born into the Earth they took him up to
[1:38:14] Cal's cross and there in one moment he
[1:38:19] destroyed the world of Satan from the
[1:38:22] Garden of Eden all the way back to the
[1:38:24] Garden of Eden again can you ever see
[1:38:27] that Jesus was the promise that the
[1:38:30] works of the devil would be destroyed
[1:38:32] that through the sacrificial death of
[1:38:35] Jesus
[1:38:37] Christ that there would be a
[1:38:40] destruction of everything that holds a
[1:38:42] Believer out of the presence of God
[1:38:45] that's when mortality would be crushed
[1:38:47] under the foot of Jesus Christ that's
[1:38:50] when Human Nature would be crushed under
[1:38:52] the feet of Jesus Christ and he would be
[1:38:55] called The Mighty conqueror I want you
[1:38:57] to think about this now because the
[1:39:00] prophecy of Genesis 3 was fulfilled in
[1:39:03] the cross in Matthew 27 and when Jesus
[1:39:07] fulfilled the scriptures brother Amos he
[1:39:09] cried that great and wonderful prayer
[1:39:11] and he said it is finished can you
[1:39:15] imagine amen he said it is finished now
[1:39:18] what is finished Satan is finished his
[1:39:21] power is finished his a program is
[1:39:24] finished because Jesus Christ has
[1:39:27] destroyed the works of the devil that
[1:39:30] day at
[1:39:31] Calvary I'll say tonight that God broke
[1:39:35] the
[1:39:36] backbone of Satan that day at Calvary
[1:39:40] can I say that every sin that you would
[1:39:42] ever commit was destroyed that day at
[1:39:45] Calvary Jesus Christ is the mighty
[1:39:48] conqueror and he conquered grave and he
[1:39:50] conquered hell and he conquered death
[1:39:53] and he conquered sicknesses he conquered
[1:39:55] the grave he conquered nature itself
[1:39:58] come
[1:39:59] on from the
[1:40:02] cross it is
[1:40:05] finished now the Bible tells us that he
[1:40:07] would Ascend to the right hand of the
[1:40:09] father but brother Mark Paul lets us in
[1:40:13] on a revelation in the book of Ephesians
[1:40:15] and he said before he
[1:40:18] ascended before he ascended
[1:40:21] we've talked about him sitting at the
[1:40:23] right hand of God but before he got
[1:40:26] there before Jesus ever got to the right
[1:40:29] hand of God he went to hell as a sinner
[1:40:32] brother John he went there in the death
[1:40:34] of a sinner at the death of the Cross
[1:40:37] and brother bandam said he went there by
[1:40:39] taking the bee of death into his own
[1:40:45] bosom oh I I tell you y'all got to
[1:40:47] forgive me but when I get to thinking
[1:40:49] about it I get to to thinking about
[1:40:51] Satan blowing his blowing his ego up for
[1:40:55] 4,000 years thinking he really had done
[1:40:57] something thinking he had took that
[1:40:59] woman seed out with Jacob he took him
[1:41:02] out with Moses he took him out with
[1:41:04] Isaac he took him out with Malachi he
[1:41:06] thought oh I I've already rid the Earth
[1:41:08] of that seed and it wasn't very powerful
[1:41:11] amen but that morning brother B said
[1:41:13] there was a knock come on his door he
[1:41:15] said he come to the door to find out who
[1:41:17] it was and he said when he looked at him
[1:41:19] he said I am the right say son of God I
[1:41:22] am the seed of the woman and he said I
[1:41:24] thought I had you when I got Jacob I
[1:41:27] thought I had you when I got Moses but
[1:41:30] now I got you I tell you what he didn't
[1:41:33] know what he had a hold of did he he he
[1:41:35] didn't know what he got a hold of he got
[1:41:38] a hold of the word without reluctance
[1:41:41] the word and his Purity and the prophet
[1:41:43] of God told us a beautiful story he said
[1:41:45] that Jesus reached out and got that
[1:41:48] Devil by the
[1:41:49] neck can you imagine Jesus getting that
[1:41:52] Devil by the neck you know what that
[1:41:55] tells me he took a hold of your
[1:41:57] depression on he took a hold of your
[1:42:00] nervousness he took a hold of that
[1:42:02] Spirit of lust he took a hold of that
[1:42:04] thing that would destroy your life he
[1:42:07] took a hold of it and brother B said he
[1:42:09] slapped him upside the face and kicked
[1:42:11] him back into hell and took the keys of
[1:42:14] death hailing the grave off of his side
[1:42:17] you know what the devil don't even have
[1:42:18] the keys to his own house tonight
[1:42:21] because before Jesus ascended he
[1:42:24] descended into the pit and he destroyed
[1:42:27] your enemy and put him under his foot
[1:42:30] well the Bible tells us that when God
[1:42:32] raised up Jesus he raised him up to set
[1:42:35] far above every principality every Power
[1:42:39] every name that can be
[1:42:44] named I don't care what name it's above
[1:42:47] Moses it's above Paul it's above James
[1:42:49] John Peter it's above Luther it's above
[1:42:52] Wesley it's above brother Ram it's above
[1:42:54] every name of God and it's also above
[1:42:57] every demon a disease and depression and
[1:43:00] cancer I'm talking about the name of
[1:43:03] Jesus Christ it is above all
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:09] names it's a name that's above all names
[1:43:13] a name that you can speak and every
[1:43:15] demon has to Bow a name that you can
[1:43:18] speak and everything is UN
[1:43:23] H
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:30] Hallelujah before he
[1:43:33] ascended he
[1:43:35] descended and took the
[1:43:38] keys from the devil of his own house can
[1:43:40] you imagine the devil ain't got keys to
[1:43:42] his own
[1:43:44] house brother said he conquered death
[1:43:46] hell and the
[1:43:49] grave
[1:43:52] isn't it beautiful he left Satan
[1:43:55] powerless the Bible tells us that as he
[1:43:59] began his Ascension that he first stop
[1:44:02] he made was over there in paradise and
[1:44:05] took the keys and turned loose the
[1:44:07] children of
[1:44:09] God Amen it it's a powerful thing folks
[1:44:13] because the last one in was in by total
[1:44:16] Grace and he come in at the last hour
[1:44:19] hanging on the cross next to the
[1:44:21] crucified word which was a type that
[1:44:24] there would be a bride who would be the
[1:44:26] last ones in that would come in by
[1:44:28] absolute Grace amen at the time of a
[1:44:31] crucified Christ well they can crucify
[1:44:34] Christ but they will never crucify the
[1:44:36] effect of the word that the bride has
[1:44:39] got on her tonight she went in by that
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:43] word that's how he went
[1:44:47] in that's how he come out come on
[1:44:51] he come out under the leadership of
[1:44:52] Jesus brother bam tells us he went up by
[1:44:54] the he went up by that and gave them
[1:44:57] keys to Apostle
[1:44:59] Peter and said whatever you buy on Earth
[1:45:02] that unlearned
[1:45:05] fisherman hallu was given authority of
[1:45:08] the key to the kingdom of heaven he now
[1:45:12] possessed the power to bind and to loose
[1:45:15] the power of Jesus Christ all power in
[1:45:19] Heaven and Earth was given unto him let
[1:45:21] me say what brother Ram said all that
[1:45:23] was in God was poured into Christ and
[1:45:26] all that was in Christ was poured into
[1:45:29] the church so sitting here tonight all
[1:45:32] the power of the godhead is down in the
[1:45:34] bride's body tonight and it's here to
[1:45:37] manifest the authority and
[1:45:40] power now that Devil's going to try to
[1:45:42] make you fearful that Devil's going to
[1:45:44] try to build up complexes and ideas and
[1:45:47] unbelief to make you unwilling to use
[1:45:50] that power in this
[1:45:51] age Hall come now if you're under the
[1:45:54] wrong head they'll tell you look look
[1:45:57] I'll tell you this you're never going to
[1:45:59] get there you're never going to make it
[1:46:01] it's never going to
[1:46:04] happen but there's another
[1:46:07] headship Hallelujah come on and he
[1:46:09] cometh with a sign now look what that
[1:46:12] devil did he spent 2,000 years trying to
[1:46:15] eradicate what it was that done but the
[1:46:18] Bible says there will come a day of
[1:46:21] power when the sign of the son of man
[1:46:23] shall appear again in heaven he will
[1:46:25] show he is still Supreme
[1:46:29] deity he is still supreme
[1:46:33] power he is still supreme authority
[1:46:36] brother said the white of his wig were
[1:46:40] Angels signifying his
[1:46:44] authority then who has the right to
[1:46:46] interpret the
[1:46:48] seals it was him amen now some of y'all

[1:55:15] what he had in his mind about a son
[1:55:18] would be manifested on the Earth Earth
[1:55:20] and this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:55:23] when God sent this message he sent the
[1:55:26] pillar of
[1:55:27] fire I don't know how else to say it the
[1:55:30] word had to be quickened by the
[1:55:32] anointing that spoke it and if you have
[1:55:35] a different anointing than the what
[1:55:37] spoke it you don't have the complete
[1:55:39] start yet but because God that Loos is
[1:55:43] what spoke your name in the beginning

[1:59:03] fire
[1:59:04] hallah you're not just you're you're

[1:59:09] scripture now what's he doing what's he
[1:59:12] doing his feet is pillars of fire he's
[1:59:13] coming down y'all know the scripture
[1:59:15] he's coming down and he's placing one
[1:59:18] foot upon land
[1:59:19] and one foot on sea now y'all know
[1:59:21] that's Revelations 13 remember Rome all
[1:59:25] them four beasts to Daniel 7 are put
[1:59:29] together and they're coming out of the
[1:59:31] water Revelation 13:1 they're coming out
[1:59:34] of the water as a Roman
[1:59:36] system and somebody puts their foot on
[1:59:40] itall pillars of fire put their foot on
[1:59:45] denominational systems that other foot
[1:59:48] is to land on land Revelation chap 13 it
[1:59:52] changes from Pagan to Pap Rome and when
[1:59:55] it becomes paple it moves and becomes a
[1:59:57] denominational system and moves into
[2:00:00] America and becomes the seed of Satan
[2:00:03] with the mark of the beast and the image
[2:00:05] will come forth at the last days but
[2:00:07] there's somebody going to put their foot
[2:00:09] on the head of that system in
[2:00:11] America so one foot on Hollywood and the
[2:00:15] other foot on Rome and there's a bride
[2:00:17] standing over the devil in the L St come
[2:00:20] on
[2:00:22] Church you know what I'm talking
[2:00:25] about and you said brother Wayne why in
[2:00:27] the world would God do something like
[2:00:29] this you know this is in the Bible the
[2:00:30] Book of Joshua Joshua parallels
[2:00:33] Ephesians now if you go back to the Book
[2:00:35] of Joshua Joshua the 10th chapter
[2:00:37] actually there is a battle of five Kings
[2:00:39] y'all know the battle and Joshua's in
[2:00:41] this great battle of five Kings he joins
[2:00:44] in the battle to help it but it turns
[2:00:46] into evening time now you see the type
[2:00:49] in the evening time A great battle being
[2:00:51] fought actually the greatest battle ever
[2:00:54] fought is fought in the evening time and
[2:00:58] what was Joshua needing to win the
[2:01:00] battle light but there's no light in the
[2:01:03] evening time so he spoke the word and
[2:01:06] the light that Joshua had was a spoken
[2:01:10] word light listen to me time shall be no
[2:01:15] more in the evening time there's no more
[2:01:18] time but a prophet puts light in the age
[2:01:22] and there's a bride in the greatest
[2:01:24] battle ever fought but look God begins
[2:01:27] to defeat our Devils he begins to defeat
[2:01:29] our enemies he actually already defeated
[2:01:32] them that day at
[2:01:34] Calvary you some Wayne then why would he
[2:01:36] need to defeat him again come on in
[2:01:39] Joshua the 10th chapter they fought
[2:01:40] through the
[2:01:41] night they destroyed their enemy the
[2:01:45] armies were
[2:01:47] conquered but in the middle of of this
[2:01:49] fight the five Kings had been gathered
[2:01:52] up and placed into a cave and
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:57] bound were Bound in a cave where they
[2:02:01] couldn't do nothing until their power
[2:02:04] Was
[2:02:05] Defeated now Joshua was told by the Lord
[2:02:08] go back and open that cave now when
[2:02:10] those kings five of them step out they
[2:02:13] step out of that cave they're
[2:02:16] kings they're defeated Kings
[2:02:20] they're kings but they're conquered
[2:02:23] Kings and you remember remember the
[2:02:25] scripture it's a beautiful scripture and
[2:02:27] he took his captains of the host of the
[2:02:29] Lord and he laid down those five Kings
[2:02:33] and he told the captains of the army
[2:02:34] come here come here and put your neck on
[2:02:37] the head of this thing put your foot
[2:02:40] right here on the neck of this devil I
[2:02:42] want I want you to
[2:02:45] personally put it under your foot it's
[2:02:48] all already conquered it can't hurt you
[2:02:52] it can't touch you but so you know it's
[2:02:55] Defeated come here and the greatest
[2:02:58] Powers you've ever fought against come
[2:03:00] here and put your foot on this thing and
[2:03:03] the captains of that Army put their foot
[2:03:06] on their head have defeated enemies now
[2:03:08] your enemy Satan Was Defeated that day
[2:03:11] at Calvary but he raised up his ugly
[2:03:14] head in the last days have you ever
[2:03:16] wondered why brother Ram said all of
[2:03:17] Hell the lid's been taking off he said
[2:03:20] and all the hell has been poured out
[2:03:21] into this age I was looking that the
[2:03:23] other day and I thought L look at this
[2:03:25] God opened the cave up he opened up the
[2:03:28] cave and let that devil back out but he
[2:03:30] didn't let that devil out to defeat you
[2:03:33] he let that devil out because he's
[2:03:35] already defeated and he wants you to
[2:03:37] know he's already defeated so he told
[2:03:39] his bride come on out of here bride and
[2:03:42] let the pillars of fire stand on the
[2:03:45] head of the enemy in the last day and
[2:03:48] we'll put every denomination under our
[2:03:50] foot and we'll put every fashion of
[2:03:52] Hollywood under our feet because we are
[2:03:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ fighting a

[2:10:52] down I Heard a Voice from my God say
[2:10:58] well Satan we're going to praise this
[2:11:00] Kingdom down you know I was studying the
[2:11:02] other day and come across the book of
[2:11:05] Chronicles that David picked out 28,000
[2:11:08] men to serve in the
[2:11:10] Tabernacle 4,000 men were singled out
[2:11:14] and appointed to play instruments and
[2:11:16] sing can you imagine the kind of Praise
[2:11:18] services they had around there 4,000
[2:11:22] people all their job was to do was to
[2:11:25] sing and play and the Bible said they
[2:11:28] sang scaly and Loud isn't that powerful
[2:11:32] somebody say well why in the world but
[2:11:33] he put one out of ever seven men to just
[2:11:35] singing and playing because David
[2:11:38] understood the power of praise David
[2:11:40] knew praise was a way out when there was
[2:11:43] no way out I tell you what you do when
[2:11:45] you see everything's against you and you
[2:11:47] got no no way out just start praising
[2:11:49] the Lord and if you start praising the
[2:11:52] Lord it'll make a way where there is no
[2:11:54] way that's how Jonah got out of the
[2:11:56] belly of the
[2:11:57] whale he begin to praise the Lord that's
[2:11:59] how the Hebrew children got God into the
[2:12:02] fiery furnace he begin to praise the
[2:12:04] Lord the Bible said the Lord inhabits
[2:12:09] the praise of his
[2:12:10] people y'all know what that inhabit that
[2:12:13] that word inhabit actually means Throne
[2:12:16] or setting place he inhabits he sits
[2:12:19] down he enthrones himself in the praise
[2:12:23] of his people so when you see when
[2:12:25] you're in a position where there's no
[2:12:27] way out and there's no hope and there's
[2:12:30] nothing amen pull up a cheer for Jesus
[2:12:33] if you start praising the Lord you
[2:12:35] brought Jesus into the problem I tell
[2:12:38] you tonight if you got something happen
[2:12:41] in your life just begin to praise the
[2:12:43] Lord put that devil under your foot and
[2:12:46] say Satan I'm going to praise your
[2:12:48] kingdom
[2:12:50] down where Satan I'm on to praise the
[2:12:53] kingdom
[2:12:55] down I heard voice from Heaven say San
[2:13:02] we're going to tell your kingdom
[2:13:04] down oh yes Satan we're going to preach
[2:13:08] your kingdom
[2:13:09] down oh Satan we're preaching your
[2:13:13] kingdom
[2:13:15] down I Heard a Voice
[2:13:18] from my God saying Satan we're going to
[2:13:22] preach your kingdom
[2:13:24] down oh yes Satan we're going to tear
[2:13:28] your kingdom down whatap yes Satan we're
[2:13:32] going to tear your kingdom down what
[2:13:34] weapon you going to use you I Heard a
[2:13:37] Voice from my God
[2:13:40] say you know praise is not just a way of
[2:13:43] Escape do you know praise is a
[2:13:46] weapon when jat had all the odds against
[2:13:50] him and he had no way out the Bible said
[2:13:53] go unpo yourself some singers and get
[2:13:56] the Levites that David chose and put
[2:13:59] them out in front of the children of
[2:14:01] Israel and he said the battle don't
[2:14:03] belong to you the battle is the Lords he
[2:14:06] said for God shall set an ambush upon
[2:14:09] your enemy and when they got there their
[2:14:11] enemy was dead praise was the weapon
[2:14:15] that destroyed their enemy and tonight
[2:14:17] praise is a weapon to destroy the
[2:14:20] depression in your life it's a weapon to
[2:14:22] destroy the nervousness put that thing
[2:14:24] under your foot just begin to praise the
[2:14:27] Lord and say Satan you ain't got no ride

[2:15:02] Lord and he was a king please don't put
[2:15:05] me in a position I can't dance please
[2:15:07] don't put me somewhere where I can't
[2:15:09] Worship the Lord because it's all that I

[2:15:15] Jesus Christ the son of God he's my
