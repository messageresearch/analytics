guess everybody knows who brother Covington is a pastor there in um Rono and uh so we want to keep him in our prayer and and Daniel had said he had forgot to mention brother Bob and Sister Janice that

father it is a comfort father that we could come to you in these times of trouble how thankful we are that you have kept us you've brought us through most of the church was sick and uh just horribly

brother Dwayne walls his son-in-law um brother Morris is it Morris Porter um is starting to have a fellowship uh once a month on Saturday um and I think they're having them at 300 pm. on Saturday afternoon okay well time is subject to change and so but they just had one last Saturday but they're singing testimonies and and um I guess they have a designated speaker or is that just just Fellowship okay so singing and testimony things they fix food for everyone and um so uh they wanted to make sure that you know that you're invited to come and I've got the um if you do want to go sometime um you can let me or brother Amos know know he gave me the address to where it's going to be and uh so um uh I'm sure you'd have a good time of fellowship and so also brother Andrew Glover asked me to greet you all today uh he's in Poland and so they've already had their Sunday Sunday services and so he's I think getting ready to head home and so we want to keep him in our prayer but he did want me to uh greet you today amen uh first Thessalonians the 4th chapter and we're going to start at the first verse furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication and that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor then if you'll go to First John the uh 3DD chapter 1 John chapter 3 and um we're going to start at the 18th verse um 1 John 3 and18 says my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before them for if our heart condemneth God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemneth condemn us not then we have confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of the Lord Jesus uh name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment amen and he that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him and he in him hereby we know that he abideth in Us by the spirit which he hath given us amen you can have your seats and pray that the Lord just blesses the word today and if I would use the title I want to continue with the Thought Walk pleasing unto him and um you know how how many believes you're a Christian you believe you're a Christian amen well we we look at that word Christian and uh it means to be Christlike and um um and so when we think of that it's uh it's a really a sobering thought um and and uh we the scriptures you know that we've read as as I've said before you know they're talking to a group of people that have been um translated out of Darkness into uh His Marvelous Light they have been ta uh Divine been made partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so so Paul and and and and and well the Bible is is speaking these scriptures are speaking to a a direct specific group of people and so the only way for a man to know well you know I'm a Christian that means Christlike and and so the only way for us to know that we are Christlike is to look into the word of God how many believes that and and we know that the word of God is more than just a book it's it's the mirror the word of God is is a mirror and and so we're we're not a people that are guessing what what it means to be Christlike um we're we're we're not a people that have no mirror uh or we're not even a people who have just a piece of mirror uh you know brother brand I'm talking of the of of when he was growing up in that one room law cabin and and he said you know that uh you go outside and and and hanging on a tree tacked to a tree was just a little piece of mirror you know and and you couldn't see your full reflection cuzz it was just a little piece and he was talking about that boy that was raised up no doubt in the same uh like he was you know that uh just had a little piece of mirror to look at or whatever and maybe you could just see the eyeball or maybe you could just see the nose or or whatever but he had went went to uh the city to his aunt's house or something to that effect and when he walked in there was a full mirror and he could not just look at his nose or whatever but he could see himself a full self right and and so when he was looking at it he you know he he realized that when he lifted his hand up the boy in the mirror lifted his hand up and and uh kept imitating what he would do and finally says that's me you know I'm that that's that's who I am you know and and so that that would tell us and I think brother brandom and telling us this story lets us know where we're standing at that we're not a people without a mirror we're not a people who have just a little piece of mirror but we actually by the opening of the word we were able to completely fully look at ourselves and and say that's me that's uh that's who I am ain't that right so so it's not just guessing as to what a Christian is uh uh it's it's when we're looking in the word then we're seeing it's the same action as that boy looked into the mirror it was the same action what whatever he did the boy in the mirror did it it was just it it was the same thing and and so then uh uh we can see ourselves fully in the word of God and our action is the same action that is in the word amen they're written in the word of us to do amen and so uh it's just like the action of Christ was the same action that the Bible uh had spoke of him and and so that's why he would tell them search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me amen and so uh uh we find that the Bible tells us what and who Christ was it tells us what he was who he was and and John 1:1 a very familiar scripture to us but it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word the 14th verse was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so that's what the father was or that's what Jesus was he was he was the word amen made flesh and so uh he was it was the mirror in John 10:30 Jesus says I and my father are one ain't that right see God was the the word amen that's what it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God that word became flesh and here is Jesus saying I am my father are one we know there in John 148 Philip Sith unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus Sith unto him have I been so long with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip he that has seen me has seen the father how sayest thou then show us the father believest thou not that I'm in the Father the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works ain't that right so we we believe that Jesus was made in the image of God and thought it not robbery to be equal with God ain't that right that's right he was the expressed image of God how many believes that he was the expressed image of of God for he was God he acted like God he preached like God he talked like God he walked like God Amen e everything about him he had the authority like God he raised the Dead uh like God uh uh there and the prophet says that God made Man In His Image after his kind amen after his kind Amen to be his word on Earth ain't that right he expressed it in Christ he was able to express his word which we would say he expressed himself in Jesus Christ and he says and what was God was in Christ everybody say God was in Christ he said that's a man after his kind God was in Christ that's a man after his kind when God which is the word how many knows he's the word and when the word was in Christ a man human man expressing itself through him that was God the word in Christ expressing itself ain't that right so really there's no other Christian outside of that God manifesting himself in in a body ain't that right so what is God's kind the prophet would ask well God's kind is the word for that's what God is he is the word ain't that right so that's the kind of man the prophet said he makes today amen is is the word man amen and so according to Romans 8:29 we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of his dear son ain't that right amen and and you look in in 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says but we all with open face amen beholding as in a glass or a mirror the glory of the Lord excuse me are changed into the same image we're changed into the same image from glory to glory so this this isn't just something that we uh is just a figment of our imagination or just a mirage that we're looking at it's it's reality we're being changed into the same image from glor glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord ain't that right well then how is it that we're changed from from from uh uh uh uh this uh uh Into His Image amen how can we be changed well Jesus says I will be with you even in you ain't that right just as Jesus became the word amen because the the the Word was God and God God was in Christ so is it Christ saying I will be in you can you say am man so a a man must be born again which makes him a new creation in the image of God after his kind to express amen uh the word on Earth ain't that right so brother brandom says well what are we to be then he answers sons of God too see we are to be sons of of God too see with the expressed word in the church carrying on see that's the mystical Body of Christ carrying on the same works that Jesus did when he was here on Earth that's the kind after his kind can you say amen that's the kind after his kind carrying on his same Works amen carrying on that same image amen that Jesus Christ was when he was upon the earth now every denomination each denomination has its own kind each political party has its own kind each uh uh nation has its own kind the world has its own kind and if you're of the world then you you're you're after the world that's that's your kind amen but but we are sons of God we've been predestinated to be sons of God so therefore God has made us after his kind we're not of the world we don't fit in the world we can't identify with the world we identify with God can you say Amen sons of God are of God's kind now Jesus being of God's kind amen the expressed image of the father he sought to do the father's will John 4:34 he says my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work his passion was to fulfill the word of God everything about him every fiber of his being was to do the will of the father to carry out that will amen and to please God Amen his life was filled with heartache it was filled with Rejection it was it was filled with misunderstandings and and all of these things because the world knew him not amen and so he stood in a in a society that did not understand him that rejected him despised him he was hated and despised Without a Cause amen he was ridiculed and mocked ain't that right and the only reason he was ridiculed and mocked was not because he acted weird as far as you know painting his you know his hair you know uh uh green and and and uh doing all kinds of weird things it was just simply he sought to do the will of the father he was an expressed image amen he was reflecting another kingdom that the world did not know understand amen he was holy in a midst of of a sinful generation he was righteous in the middle of the of an unrighteous generation can you say amen amen and an Unholy people despised him an Unholy people rejected him because they didn't understand his life they they didn't you know we could put it in our term when he was a teenager they wanted to go you know drink they wanted to go to the parties they wanted to amen uh live it up but he didn't do them things so therefore they said oh you're weird and and and but his own life condemned them amen he didn't condemn them but his life condemned them amen he continued to do the will of the father he even submitted to death knowing it was the will of the father for him to die amen and yet his body didn't want to that human flesh was screaming out no amen but yet he was able to bring his body under subjection Jesus said if it be thy will let this cup pass from me amen but nevertheless not my will but thine be done ain't that right so then you know the Bible tells us that there was a purpose for his death though God wasn't just sending his son to to die just to do it amen to show his power of Resurrection but there was a purpose in his death amen and I want to read some scriptures uh to establish that fact to us Romans uh 5 and 6 when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly ain't that right that's me see for scarcely for a righteous man will one die uh uh yet per adventure for a a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so the the death was for us him hanging on the cross was for us do you believe that that was the will of God that was the will of the father amen the whole purpose of Christ's life was for us first first Corinthians 15:3 says I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures Christ died for us amen John 17 uh 19 for their sake Jesus prayed break it in here it says for their sake I sanctify myself that they might also be Sanctified through the truth so see the life that Jesus lived and we're talking about being a Christian Christlike walking pleasing unto him the life that Christ lived was a sacrificial life do you believe that his ministry was was uh an unselfish Ministry he didn't think of himself he didn't try to build a name aen for himself he lived for others can you say that with me he lived for others he lived for others amen now there are good people throughout the world that you know that lives for others as well but they operate by humanitarian efforts amen humanitarian I I just looked it up it means showing concern for the welfare of humanity especially in acting to improve the living conditions of impoverished people a person promoting human welfare and social reform so there there there's a lot of humanitarian efforts and people are doing this out of Good Will to help others they feed the poor they help the needy build hospitals for the sick build mental WS uh for those who are who have uh the mentally insane and and and you know we're we're th thankful I am for for the the work that these institutions do and and all these things but when you when you really think of it none of these have the ability to break the power that sin has on an individual's life can you say Amen they Thrive through education and science but when Jesus came to Earth he didn't build hospitals he didn't build menal WS he he he didn't start charity missions and things like that that's not what the father sent him to do can you say Amen and I uh you know and if you disagree with that then show me where he did show me where he started these things but yet he said I do the will of the father now now Christian Christianity the only form of Christianity is being Christlike it's not being patterned after anything else but patterning our lives after Christ and and and so then uh we look Luke 4 and18 Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me so he knew and and then he goes into why it wasn't to build hospitals it wasn't to start functions and charity things and all these things but Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord you look at 1 John 3 and8 breaking in it says for for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil can you say amen amen not teach us how to cope with the devil but to break the the very power of the devil in our lives now so we we see that Christ live for others and like I said there there's others that that other people that live for others but but Christ Liv for others that he might destroy the devil's uh Power in their lives that that he might uh that he might heal them from the devil's scars that he might heal up the wounds from from from whatever the devil has done to them that's way Christ lived for them amen was to take Satan or take them out of Satan's grip you see his ministry didn't operate on the side of Education in science his ministry was Supernatural see and so the prophet said the church wasn't commissioned to build you know uh schools and hospitals and and and and things like that that's not what our commission is amen but but notice Mark 16:15 Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and that word preaches to demonstrate amen the gospel in its power Amen to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall what cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you Jesus saying he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now the prophet would tell us that education has taken the place of the holy spirit in the church but he said education's all right but that is not God's program the church is not to rely upon education the church is not to rely upon science the church is not to rely upon the carnal mind amen see that's not God's program he said if education was to take the place well then Christ would have established schools when he was upon the Earth but Christ never did establish a school Christ established a church amen not a church of intellectual but out of a bunch of illiterate fishermen who were willing to listen to the Holy Spirit and be led accordingly ain't that that right now in John 20 21 Jesus said as my father has sent me even so send I you ain't that right brother brandom asked well how did the father send him though because as the father sent him he sends us the same way that's right so how did the father send him the father that sent him came down from heaven and dwelt in [Music] him and he went forth and he said I always do that which pleases my father he went about doing the things that the father was showing him to do I do nothing except my father for show me the god that sent him was on the inside of him and he sends the church the same way the father sent him God in us can you say Amen so brother Brandon would ask then what is it it's God in you that's right can you say that God in me it's God in Me this this isn't a a a natural thing it's God in Meen God and me carrying out what the same Works carrying on the same works and by this we are showing forth his resurrection that he's alive today that's right can you say Amen now second Corinthians and I'm I'm getting somewhere but 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul would tell usow then we are ambassadors for Christ we're not ambassadors for the United States we're not speaking in the name of the United States we're not speaking for some political party but we are ambassadors for Christ amen he has sent us and as he was an ambassador for God Almighty we are ambassadors for Christ amen as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead you get it I'm standing here preaching to you in Christ dead when you're witnessing to others you're witnessing in Christ dead when you're praying for others you're praying in Christ dead for others you are the Ambassador now amen when you're singing when you're when you're going out in into the world and and they're watching your life you are there in the stad of Christ you're in Christ dead you're there on the job in Christ dead you're at school in Christ dead can you say man yes sir see we pray you in Christ dead that you be reconciled to God was that not Christ's desire was the people to be reconciled back to God sure it was God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself that was The Passion of Christ therefore we stand in Christ dead saying be ye reconciled to God Amen it's the same passion it's the same desire it's the same life now notice the 21st verse for he hath made him to be sin for us God made Christ to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him don't you see it that the burden now is within us as the father sent him out into the world that the world may be reconciled back to God so he has sent us into the world that the unbelieving sinner may be reconciled back to God in this age what is God he was made in the image of God he was the conformed in that same image well John 1 John 4:8 tells us that God is love say it with me God is love God is love now we know by the message that there are different kinds of love it's not all one love the same love there's different kinds of love but this love that God is is the purest of love this love is divine love which is agapo love agape and the word Agape in the Greek is a term that denotes a profound and sacrificial love that transcends and persists regardless of circumstances all right I want to say that again because again God is love agapo love in the Greek is a term that denotes a profound and sacrificial love Lord that transcends and persists regardless of circumstances amen now is that not how God loved you right we all have our own story and if you really feel the way Paul felt we all feel like we were the chiefest of Sinners I know I was and yet God's love was persistent to me regardless of my conditions regardless of the circumstance that I was in it was able to transcend its profound love and sacrificial amen it is the highest form of Love Char characterized by its selflessness and unconditional nature it's the love that God has for his people and is the re reciprocal love that they have for God and extends to fellow Humanity so so again this agapo love is not only a love that God has for his people but it's a love wherein God's people loves him back and loves his fellow manise Lord right because now we're made in the image of God yeah we're after God's Own Kind amen that's right it's a love that is intentional not accidental it's intentional in other words I we we we won't say well I didn't know that guy was like that or I wouldn't have even been tried it's intentional God knew where you were God knew how of a whole life I was but he loved me anyways while I was yet a sinner Christ died for me because this love is intentional it's a love that is intentional and notice what this other definition or whatever it's a conscious Choice yes sir so it wasn't just he accidentally stumbled upon me it was a conscience choice that he loved me amen and is not motivated by emotional attraction of familial bonds can you say Amen true see so then if if we look at this agapo love that God is God is love agapo love the highest form of love that there is well then this love cannot be impersonated amen you can't you you you you understand right it cannot be impersonated because it's God and comes from God Alone there's all other loves but it can never come to this type of a love because it's God the Lord you cannot impersonate love you realize Satan cannot impersonate this kind of love Jesus was not an impersonator he was not going around saying I love you I love you bud I love you sis I love you no it was he wasn't an impersonator he was God manifested in flesh Lord ain't that right so see he came the prophet said he came to show man what God is here he is a human being manifesting God to human man amen true ain't that right we didn't understand God as a spirit so God became man and in that body of Jesus Christ God would show us really what he is how could he show us such Divine love unless he was rejected and despised and spat upon and mocked and re ridiculed and hated without a c and yet and his death hanging on a cross looking at his Killers his murderers and saying father forgive them true amen so we find that this first display of love that we see was in the garden after man disobeyed God and right after man and woman had sinned the holy image of God left him the Prophet said and they covered themselves the Bible says they covered themselves with with fig leaves because they realized that they were necked and so uh they covered themselves up but when God came looking for them they ran and hid themselves from the presence of God which showed that their man-made covering was not good enough to hide their sins from God Amen and and so they couldn't stand in the presence of God without being condemned and and we find that this first display of love if we could say it that way that that we see to humankind man is when God slew a lamb and he took the skin of that lamb and he wrapped them he clothed them to where they could stand there and talk walk with God right and and so we understand what God said to them you know he asked Adam you know why are you in this condition she made me do it and then he asked the woman well she points to the serpent he made me do it so the buck was passed all the way down God cursed the serpent God spoke to Eve God God done every God spoke to them you understand and we all know what he was say said if you don't go back to Genesis and read it but before God sent them away and and and the prophet describes it and he tells us that he's looking through he says we're going to we're looking now and he's actually through vision watching Adam and Eve is is hugging one another they got their heads bowed and they're running out of the garden and he says the the bloody blood from that animal is dripping down down their legs and that skin is flapping against their he says we're watching this and as they're going this way God is going this way and then he says God stops and turns around and says but wait wait here they're sobbing because they know what they did they've been rejected from the presence of God and he says then out of love God says but I will I will redeem you I'll come back you ain't always going to be this way I'll bring you back he said what was it it was L he loved his children until he couldn't turn them away and so God made preparation to redeem brother brandom in another place he says I can hear something going on like this and he claps three times what is it it's the old bloody sheep skin beating against Adam's big manly legs as he went walking out of the presence of God God couldn't stand at all that great eternity come down to four letters l o e God so loved he couldn't see his children go out in that kind of a condition separating from him he stopped and he said wait a minute I'll put enmity between your seed and the Serpent's Seed promising a savior he said let's turn our camera now 4,000 years later there's a great carrying on in Jerusalem we're sitting in a building saying and we say what is all this noise about where where did it it come from and look out and somebody say well there's a Holy Roller out there they're going to crucify him this morning he's done nothing but just tear up the churches around here and everything and so they're going to crucify him let's go at the window and look out there comes the man down the street over them cobblestones dragging an Old Rugged Cross he's got a garment on wol throughout without seams and he starts up gotha yonder I look I began to look on his back I see little red spots over his coat and I say what are those red spots I keep watching them as he goes the spots get bigger and bigger and bigger now they just run into one big bloody spot I hear something going on brother Brandon claps three times he says what is it it's the second Adam the Redeemer going Yonder to Calvary bearing away the Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world up yonder to Calvary it's the most pathetic picture that was ever pictured you see God had prepared a lamb and this was what Jesus was doing is I've I my meat is to do the will of him that sent me the Bible tells us that God had prepared a way before the foundation of the world for the lamb was slain uh then before the foundation of the world God knew that man would become enslaved to the devil and and he would fall but because he so loved Humanity that he prepared A A Plan of Redemption can you say man and even though that Adam and Eve had fall he made sure that they understood God made sure I mean this is by his love God so loved man that he made sure that Adam and Eve understood that there would come Redemption amen before they ever left that that Garden before they left his presence he wanted them to have a clear understanding that they would not be like this forever that's the love of God amise the Lord the lamb that Abel killed for a sacrifice was a type of Christ as we know brother Bram said Abel's death was the type of Christ's death Abel's birth was a type of Christ Resurrection Isaac carrying the wood of the burnt offering up the mountain was a typee of Christ carrying the cross up the hill Isaac laying on the altar was a type of Christ on the cross the ram that God spoke into existence to be the sacrificial substitute was a type of Christ being our substitute Moses striking The Rock in the wilderness so that the Waters of life could come forth it spoke of Christ being smitten so that the Waters of life could come forth for an eternal uh uh uh preservation see God moved upon men to write songs throughout the Bible throughout time that spoke of the Redeemer to come he moved on men to write poems of of the coming Redeemer it's all been through this Bible that's why the the prophet would tell us that this Bible is is one big Love Story it's it's a love story because it speaks of Christ every every part of of of of of the the pages of every verse every word every letter it's it's speaking of Christ Christ Christ is the theme and and it's all speaking and all of this comes from the love of God you understand what I'm saying Christ would make sure that when one Prophet died another Prophet would rise it would be he would be speaking of Christ the Redeemer to come of a people that would be come to Salvation of a people that would be redeemed and would be restored and when that Prophet would go down God would raise up another Prophet telling the same story amen there's not one contradiction in this Bible it's all one thing because the spirit of God would fall upon one Prophet then it would fall upon another Prophet it would fall upon another Prophet it would fall upon Ruth and and it would fall upon uh uh all of these others you know just even the the the the story of Ruth speaks of redemption of the bride and and we all all know these things and sometimes we take it for granted but this was the spirit of God he's love God is love how can you have god of love move and there's no story of Redemption how can we have God moving who is love and and and then the people be condemned leave condemned without without having a chance of of restoration I hope you understand love calls him to do it we see that through time and Through the Bible God rebuked and punished Humanity for their sins but through all of that time the love of God he kept reminding them he kept reminding there's coming a redeemer he never let them lose that Focus because he couldn't lose it right he so loved that no matter what sins they done he kept Christ Christ is coming yes he would punish them but he would always bring an atonement in their midst Lord can you say Amen whether it was the lamb or whether it was the Brazen serpent or whether it was you know the the angel coming upon the waters of Bethesda it was always speaking of redemption but love caused him to keep reminding mankind of the coming Redeemer there are many types that God used in the Bible to testify of the Redeemer that was to come because it was the expression of God's love to humanity and we see that it is the love of God that produced Christ to the world we thinking of well you know he was the spoken word he was he you know God just spoke his word and and it formed in the womb of Mary but but what was that what was the motive love ain't that right so love produced Christ God's love brought forth Christ and I said today it's the only thing that'll produce him again love divine love will be the only thing that will produce Christ again it took God 4,000 years to make this masterpiece Christ and again God's motive for making this masterpiece was divine love you see love must be the motive behind everything that we do as Christians it was the motive behind God when he had raised up Prophet after Prophet it was love that caused him to do it amen it was the grace of God how how did the smitten Rock come it was love Lord the Brazen serpent it was love who would have ever thought of these things but God's love produced it because it was speaking of Christ to come he wanted his people to know that I ain't going to leave you like this now I'll give you a temporary relief but remember he's coming and it'll give you an eternal restoration the Lord so then when Christ come which was God's love gift to the world he kept putting himself as that one I was that rock I am that rock I was the one before Abraham right you understand what I'm saying he he kept revealing himself I was that Brazen serpent I am him because it was love you see love what would cause Jesus to continue doing the will of the father it was love but he didn't have a different kind of love than God because God was in him am so therefore God reflecting that love through all the prophets and through all the sages and through every story in the Old Testament now was being reflected in this man that would cause him to fulfill every type of the Bible that spoke of Messiah to come can you say Amen now love must be the motive behind our preaching behind our singing behind our worship behind our life it must be behind the motive behind our testimony it must be the motive behind everything that we do love must be its motive that's true it must be the motive behind gifts amen can you sayen see so when the New Testament Church went forth from the day of Pentecost they preached the gospel they prayed for the sick they witnessed they established churches they gave their time they gave their energy they gave it all to God yes they sold everything that they had but what was the motive love see they had nothing selfish it wasn't a selfish Ministry it wasn't to say well see look at me I just preached to a thousand people today man we had a good great great time great time great time no it was love divine love why because the very spirit that was in Christ now was in them amen can you say Amen so we we find I know I hope this is a help to you but it's it's just something simple but Christ being God's love gift John 3:16 we know it very well for God so loved the world that he he gave his only begotten son you realize this love is so profound that we can't even attain to it without God himself we can't even understand this kind of love but yet it's there it's written and it's become the most common scripture I think for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and yet so many people so many men preach from this sermon with selfish attitudes and selfish motives because they have not that love within them God so loved that he sought to redeem his children and this word redeem means to bring back to its original condition original place so see Divine love look for a redem remedy to bring the elect back to the original place this love produced the remedy which was Christ ain't that right and Jesus says without me you can do nothing another place I am the way I am the truth and the life another place he says I am come that you may have life and have it more abundantly if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me why because God's love cannot produce anything greater or anything better than Christ that's why when a man has the true love of God he can't look for any other way than point to Christ that's right and we know that Christ the only way you can point to Christ is to manifest Christ we're not pointing to a Doctrine we're not pointing to a personality we're not pointing to a gift we are wanting to reflect Christ so that people can see Christ can you say Amen how different this love is from Human love see human love pies man it sympathizes with man in its Fallen state but it doesn't seek to bring people to Christ again it produces human love produces a lot of humanitarian effort programs degrees hospitals seminaries professionalism but it never gets people to Christ human love produces all kinds of churches and more churches and more churches and more churches but the prophet would would talk to the the churches of that day he says I'm afraid we're getting the people to church but not to Christ so somewhere they were lacking in love somewhere they were lacking in that Godly love can you say Amen if Divine love would produce Christ and the Divine love in us would bring him to Christ and produce Christ again God so loved the world that Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil now if you look uh uh Luke 1:76 and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and the in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of Peace can you say amen so see if you could see that God being loved now you can see what that love that desire that is is being produced from that love it's to deliver the people from Darkness it's to set the people free can you say Amen everything that Satan has calls in in to humanity amen that love the desire of God by that love has wants to set him free pise the Lord God doesn't want us to set in confusion God doesn't want us to remain what we are helpless and beggarly can you say Amen so God wants to destroy Satan's power in people's lives that is the motive behind Divine love can you say Amen see so the love of God always always everybody say it always seeks to destroy the works of the devil why are we called old sons of God how did we get there the Bible gives the answer behold what manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God so it was a love we are sons of God because God so loved and it's not just a gift of God it is God so we look at it 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called or named the sons of God so we know whatever your name your named or called that's what identifies you right that's what identifies you when my dad called me son I realized I was his son he called me that before I understood what son was when he called me Shawn I didn't understand sea but I knew all of a sudden I just started responding to my name you call you know you you call Zoe you know and that little baby doesn't know much about it but you call her name and she looks because she's already identifying what you've named her you understand what I'm saying what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we are named sons of God lord we can't can't identify with nothing else we are Sons how many sons and daughters of God Amen see so that's what identifies us therefore therefore John says the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now one writer said of the scripture he says this love is an exotic love well I I looked up what exotic it it means that this it's it's foreign This Love This Kind of Love is foreign to the human heart see so he goes on to say the father permanently everybody say permanently the father permanently bestowed this love upon us to the end that we may be named children children born ones of God and we are can you say amen and he have besto this love I looked up this word bestow to put to use to apply to put in a particular or appropriate Place true can you say amen amen so this love is placed upon us as a gift it's not earned can you say say Amen it's a gift not earned and then the writer goes on and on this account the world does not have an experimental knowledge of us because it has not come into an experiment experimental knowledge of him Divine loved ones now born ones of God we are can you say amen amen So Divine love is an exotic love it's foreign something that I looked up this foreign it means something that is introduced from another country mysteriously different unusual is not this love come from God is different yeah it's it's it's it's been introduced to Earthly man from a another world what kind of love is this but all we know it was bestowed upon us and now we are the sons of God and Satan has lost his power over us because of such love can you say Amen it's foreign because no man has it and you say amen and we know it's foreign we know it's foreign because it's produced something that no other love has produced man may feel sorry for you out of human love but it'll never produce sons of God but God's love bestowed upon us produce Sons amen amen what if this Divine love didn't exist but we couldn't be called sons of God right then then this tells us that Divine love has its own effect and produces its own results no matter the gift no matter the ministry the knowledge the work and ability the testimony that a man may have have without Divine love it cannot produce what God desires sons of God the Lord can you say amen amen what good would it do to preach to sing to testify to witness to others it Divine love isn't there what good would it do to pray for the sick if Divine love wasn't there what good would it do to have a gift and it be operated every night if it isn't operated by Divine love can you say amen amen 1 Corinthians 13 And1 though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I'm become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith though that so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing so brother Brandon would tell us I'd rather have the love of God sealed in my heart than all the gifts there is in the Bible am another place he said if the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person a great Minister I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel or I'll give you a gift of teaching the word or I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or any of those the fine Gifts of Faith uh he says any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them every one to you but then I will withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift from you I'd say Lord take all the gifts and let me have the love for no matter what how many gifts we've got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must everybody say we must we must have love can you say Amen we must and this love must be divine love which can only come from him amen that's good what was the motive behind Jesus preaching the gospel to the poor Divine love that's right what was the motive his motive of praying for the sick Divine love can you say amen amen what was his motive of healing the Brokenhearted Divine love amen see so we find what the motive behind him preaching the acceptable year of the Lord thinking of this church you can preach you can be free you can be free but if Divine love ain't behind that if it ain't the motive it it does us no good but when Jesus preached that acceptable year of the Lord there was divine love behind it amen amen he wasn't judg in his ministry by how good he preached he wasn't judg in his ministry by how well the people accepted him he wasn't judg in his ministry by whether they understood or not understood him it was just by Divine love he had to help them somehow amen and divine love caused him not to compromise with the word of God can you amen everything that he did was so that the people could be free and be delivered see you we have to understand it's divine love is what breaks the power of Satan upon people's lives it's not how good we preach it's not how well we sing it's not how well we play the music it's not how well we dress it's just Divine love can you say Amen you see brother brandham said when love is put him in in its place it'll defeat any enemy there is on the Earth or in torment brother bradam used the different examples like the bull that come to attack him and he said now please don't take this as juvenile but something happened now notice he said I wish it would happen right now always in those cases that something happens instead of hating that bull there was something I sympathized with him I loved him and I was no more afraid of that animal than I was I am standing here with my brotherr and all fear had left can you say man what a love right and I thought you poor creature I'm on your territory you're an animal you don't know any different that's the only thing you know is protect your rights and I said to this bull in these words oh creature of God I am God's servant and I'm on my way to pray for my sick brother I'm sorry I Disturbed you now notice a prophet apologizing to an animal we can't even apologize to one another but here he is under Divine love and he's apologizing to an animal and he said I'm sorry I Disturbed you but in Jesus name go lay down and he threw his horns in the ground throwing the dirt he fell to his knees and threw the dirt again and I stood stood there just as calm as I am now and he rushed towards me just as hard as he could come in a charge but I just stood there for I wasn't afraid and when he had gotten about 5et of me he threw his big feet out like that and stopped and he looked this way and that way so depleted and turned around and went over and laid down he said and I passed within 5et of him and he never moved no more what was it Divine love it had subdued a Wild Heart a wild nature an animal nature ain't that right the maniac that intended to kill brother brandham brother Bram said when that Maniac at up at Oregon when he ran to the platform to kill me he said something happened there you've often wondered I guess how those things happen it's something in the stad of despising that man though he was there to take my life a Divine love a Divine Law set in for him and he called me a hypocrite a snake in the grass and thousands of people sitting there and spit in my face and and Drew back his fist and said I'll break every bone in your body people probably sitting here was there he said but instead of despising the man Grace came in in a moment when I needed it how many needs it amen Grace sets in and projected Divine love into my heart that I could project to him and I thought there stands a man like I am he likes to eat drink and his family but the devil has him so bound you see if we could realize that it's not the human it's the devil that has people bound it's the devil that causes people to where they can't believe it's the devil that gets them so tore up it's the devil that causes misunderstandings it's the devil that tries to separate Brotherhood it's it's the devil and so many times we're looking at the individual instead of what's causing it true but there he was and he says oh my says that the devil has him so bound and so the love of God constrained me and the man humbled himself and fell across my feet Grace stepped in When Love Was projected another place he says I didn't hate the man I loved him I felt sorry for him that's what slew him on the platform that's what slew those witch doctors standing there that day human beings that God died for standing there trying to throw spells on me witches like that and standing there before him him and you see them fall to the ground throw their head down like this and give their hearts to Christ it was love that did it love everybody say love is the mightiest Force there is you believe it love is the mightiest Force see what is it it's an exotic love it's something that is foreign to the human being but it it it's not something that that that can't come to the human being because we just saw it it wasn't just Jesus now there was a man that that was redeemed that was born a sinner now redeemed and the love of God could reflect and subdue a bull it could subdue a maniac it could subdue Hornets can you say Amen on and on and on it it could brother Bram talking about the Hornets I know I've kept you long please forgive me but he says now anyone knows what a hornet is he'll kill you one Hornet can flatten you on the ground and me with no shirt on and I was standing there and something happened I don't know what it is it's just something that happens it's love instead of hating those Hornets I thought poor little creatures of God well I have nothing again you that's your home and I Disturbed you sounds like a child but the trouble it is we try to be grown-ups when we ought to be children we just we we take things just as we're so intelligent we'd happen to measure our intelligence with God's grace one time I wonder where it would come up but in this these Hornets was all over me and I wasn't afraid of the little creatures I said little creatures go back into your nest I'll not harm you and as God Lives them Hornets world around me three or four times and went straight back to their nest can you say Amen brother Branham and I'll Clos but brother brandham talking about the blind man that came in the prayer line he said the old man as he stood there I began to feel sorry for him I looked at his old ragged coat I put my shoulders up the side of his to see if my coat would fit him I looked at his feet no shoes on great calluses on his feet Dusty all the way up as far as you could where his ragged trouser uh uh uh leg my shoe wasn't nothing like big enough for him and I began to look and I thought this that poor old man maybe had never had a good meal in all of his life see the economics of Mexico are very poor The Brick Mason gets about eight pesos a day and it takes about four days good hard labor to buy himself a pair of shoes that's uh uh Poncho Frank and what does Pedro do working for about two pesos with six or eight children to raise it's terrible and I thought after all of that and then nature the devil has given him evil to Blind this his poor old blinded eyes how cruel it was to him and I began to enter into something I can't express it it was a love of sympathy and as the old fella come and laid his head on over on my shoulders and I hugged that old ragged coat and I said Lord be be merciful God please help this poor old blind daddy if my dad would have lived he had been about that age will you help him and I heard him hollering glory and the man could see as good as I could the people began screaming everywhere what was it it was entering into that Fellowship of his suffering and his blindness you must do it can you sayen what this tells us church is we cannot defeat demons without divine love we need Divine love can you say man it's interesting how that Satan is able to gain access when Divine love is not there look at the homes that are broken brother Brandon preached the invasion of the United States but he also tells us that love was waning love was going love was leaving and when love is not in the home the devil's able to gain access and break up that home look at the marriages that are broken today because there is no love the nation is broken because there is no love churches are divided because there is no love ministers fight behind their pulpits because there is no love can you Amen brother bradam said see look at the divorce courts between husband and wife look at the juvenile delinquency look at the homes break and everything No Love No Love and and now the only time that you even know your neighbor's dead is when you read it in the paper that's about right he said see we don't know about one another anymore because there's no love no more can you say Amen but see God is love and all that God is he poured into Christ and he became love he became the expression of love to the world and all that Christ is he poured into the church can you say Amen you love him if the musicians will come and that is the mystery that Paul spoke of about the church it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's something that is exotic but yet we hold it's something that is foreign to the human heart but we as his r deemed Made In His Image after his kind lord it's not a human love that we operate through its Divine love the very same love that Jesus had can you say Amen it it it makes us testify we got to tell somebody about God we got to tell somebody that there is a hope how could we be ashamed with Divine love how could we hold our peace with Divine love not worried to be called crazy not worried to be called a fanatic not worried about being despised and rejected we got to let the people know that there is a Christ and he's alive and well can you say amen amen God bless you amen what song is that make me more like the Jesus make me more like thee oh give me a heart that that's filled with love and make me more like sing it again oh make no wonder Jesus had to pray no wonder he had to steal away and find time to speak to the father he had to keep that channel couldn't let himself get bitter couldn't let himself become indifferent couldn't let himself become selfish he had to keep himself available and yielded that the father could use him not only just use him to speak not only just use him to have a Ministry and to lay hands on the sick and have healing campaigns that the father could reflect his character through him make me more like thee Jesus make me more like thee Oh and give me a heart that's fed with love and make me more do you believe someone needs to know about him I believe it oh make I think of how selfish the world has become they're so selfish they complain about everything complain about the boss complain about the pay they're complaining about this complaining about that it's because they become so selfish amen the Bible even says uh uh lovers of self more than lovers of God and they're not realizing many people are saying well I'm a Christian I'm a Christian but but it's all consumed about them they've made life about them what they don't realize maybe God has got them in that place to read somebody [Music] and maybe instead of looking at us and what they can do for us maybe we can say father father what can I do for you how can I reach that individual Lord I realize that if if they don't have what I've got if they don't really have that true experience with you they're going to be lost help me Lord help me to reflect you in such a way I want to make myself available to you how many believes that how many wants to do that this morning oh I know you do I do sing it as
