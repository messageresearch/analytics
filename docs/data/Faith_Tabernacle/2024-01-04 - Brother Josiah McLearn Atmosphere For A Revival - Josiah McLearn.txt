battle amen um I'd like to turn the scriptures tonight um if we can to John chapter 5 and verse one if I can find it here amen John 5 verse verse one it says and and and after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up up up to to Jerusalem and and now there there is at Jerusalem um by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue be beeda um um having having having five having five porches and and in the lay a great multitude of of of of imp poent folk of the blind Halt and withered and waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at at certain Seasons into the pool and troubled the water and and and and whatsoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever whatsoever disease disease he had and a certain man and a certain man was there which had which had and and and infirmity 3 and8 years and Jesus saw and Jesus and and when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had he he he had been now a long time in that case he saith he saith unto him wil wil thou be made made whole and the impotent man answered him saying sir I have I have I have no man no man no man when when when the water is is no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steth down down down before me and Jesus saith saith unto him rise and take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath let's all bow our heads our dear gracious Heavenly Father the Lord how we love you and Lord how thankful we are father for another opportunity Lord to come in your presence father and worship you and just uh sit sit at your feet father and learn of you and we ask you father now just just to come down and move in such a mighty special way tonight father we ask you Lord for for it not to be a halfhazard way Lord but Come With all sincerity and reverence Lord before your throne father we ask you Lord just to walk the aisles and touch each and every heart and life here we pray Jesus Christ's name amen amen y' y'all can uh can can have your seats I uh uh I've had this thought on my mind especially with our meeting coming up um in at atmosphere for a Revival and then brother Shawn gets up and preaches an atmosphere for a Rapture Sunday so I I told him downstairs I was like I'm probably going to change my subject but here I am so y'all have to uh uh uh uh help help help me out here and and and I and I I I pray it becomes as real to you to you as it is to me and uh and so we look at we look at the um the scripture where where where the angel had come down and and he and he troubled the the waters and and whenever the waters was troubled um on the first man to um step in it was immediately was immediately ma ma made whole and and the and but but but yet you look at what these what these what what this was doing was was was brother brandom said said said said that that that that that that that there was a great multitude tude of of of of people there and that and and that they were just watching that water and waiting on it for the slight for the slightest stir a and so so that way there so so so that with they they there that they could they could jump in or or or dive in and and and be and be made made made whole but but but but but you see they were expecting they were expecting that angel to show up at at any moment the atmosphere in in in that place in that place m m must have have been in such a way where where that where where where that where that you could feel that charge and that electricity and that electricity there of of of people just anticipating to to jump in there um um and and and we know that U Christmas time had just passed and and my kids we uh we uh stuck a bunch of gifts of gifts out and uh and and they were all excited every day they kept asking asking dad can can we open the gifts today nope not today Christmas time and they're like well when's Christmas it's it's in a week and and they' be eyeing them gifts and and they and they're looking at them and dad is it Christmas time yet nope not yet and and yet and and yet and yet they were anticipating it to where to to to to to where because because they knew that that just in a couple days a couple days what was going to be what what was hidden what was what was hidden there and and a package was was was soon to be unwrapped and was going to be theirs and and and you notice that um that uh um this whole the whole month of of of of December and even and even and even November it's you see the uh you see the Santa Clauses everywhere and you see the Christmas lights going up and you see you hear the Christmas music going everywhere and and you see all the stuff going on and my wife was asking me asking me uh about decorating for for for Christmas and and I said Not until December 1st I will not I refuse to to to do anything else until December but but but but in it seems like it seems like around around this this this this this this around this this time time time of year there there's there's such a an atmosphere around to to where to to where you walk in the store and and and you hear the Christmas music and and you're driving down the street and you hear the and you see the Christmas lights it becomes such an anticipation for one night um um um that that that we call that we call that we call Christmas and it's uh and and and and yet and yet the world and and I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not here to preach on I'm just talking about the atmosphere of what that this season um um um creates and America especially um but um brother random said said um say he said he said he said he said he said say say we're going to two two a dance and and and one man and and one man standing up and saying well now he don't he don't he don't he don't know he he don't know about whether whether whether he he wants he he about whether he wants to to to he wants to dance or not and this and this girl and this girl oh oh over here and this and that and the music playing near near near my God my God my God to to to the he said huh what an atmosphere Fe what an atmosphere for for for for a dance well that's not any different than than what a lot of of atmospheres when you go in into a church for service of God just just just just the contrary right he said the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then then then and for for for the dance is to put on is to put on your old your old music that makes dances and everybody get get to thinking about what a good time about what a good time they're about what a good time they're going to have dancing and so forth and they'll have and they'll be having a a big a big whoop uping time he he he said he he said put the right kind of music on the piano and and and and the organ every and everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there going going going to meet everything that that that everything that they have need need of something will will go to taking place atmosphere but that's what the hardest thing thing thing that's what the hardest thing there is to do and that is to get people in and in and that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing um um and so so so um we uh we uh look around the world the world today I I have a coworker or an employee and and um we was and he's a southern baptist but we was talking over over lunch over lunch over lunch lunch the other day and he and we was talking about how America has just has fallen down down downhill and inant pits and he's just got this hope that if Trump if Trump can can make it then then then we can turn we can we can turn the whole thing around and and and and and his whole hope and his whole and and his his entire being his entire his entire hope and and and and for this country is on is on a single man and and and and and how and how if Trump if Trump can get it then America is can can can still be can still be be be turned around but but but but I I I I I I stopped him and and I began to to remind him of what the scriptures say say say about about what has to happen and and and he and he stopped and began to listen he's like yeah you're exactly right and I said in America is there's there's not one thing that that any man could could could ever do could ever do to to to turn this country around and because be because be because because because because because she she she's doomed and as much as I love America but but but but but but but yet but yet but yet but yet for for us as Christians it's the most it's the most amazing time and the most encouraging time time time the most encouraging time that that that that that there is and and and and yet he's so he's he's so discouraged and he's disgruntled and he's he's upset he's like he's like what are we going to do I don't know I just I just don't know what to do I don't know what the economy is going to do I don't know what this is going to happen and he's he he's so overwhelmed with with with it's because it's because it's because even even though he he's a denominational denominational Christian he has no hope other than other than what other than what he's saying in in in in front of his eyes but but but yet but yet but yet but yet as as as as as as Believers it's the most glorious time and it's the most encouraging time for us because we know that just any day now we are crossing over over on on on onto the other side and and there's nothing there there there's no Democrat there is no there is no there's no no there's no Republican there's no liberal there's no nothing that that that that can never stop us or sway us or or or or sway us upon this because because because we're not of this country we are of a of a Heavenly Home you guys will have to help me out here I'm I'm uh stuttering real bad tonight for some reason seem like more than more than normal amen but but but but but but as a as as the Bible says there shall be signs there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon Earth a a distress a stress of Nations per per perplexity of perplexity at Sea and waves of roaring men's hearts are failing them everywhere everywhere everywhere everywhere for fear and and and and but but but yet then but yet then we as the bride of Christ we shall see the son of man coming coming coming in in and a cloud of great power and of great glory and when these things when these things shall shall shall when these things shall begin shall begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for our Redemption draweth nigh over the book of Zechariah uh 14:7 it says it it says it it says it says and and it shall be one day that shall be known that shall be known to to to the Lord not of day nor nor nor of night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall it shall be light but but but yet but but but but yet men are men the the the the these these men and women throughout the country they're worried about the economy they're worried about about this and about that and the nations are just tanked and the world is and the world is falling apart but um brother brandom said said said this he he said he he said notice this character when you see women just go just go on on the Rampage just do just doing anything anything that they want to do watch the church is doing the same thing too notice he he he said he he said he said he said he said he he said he said but what but but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then watch then you see how that the scriptures at that time there there there there there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride to catch that to catch that woman woman elect for as the world Satan the the the the the the deceiver who who who the deceiver who deceived the first bride to sining against God by misbelieving by misbelieving misbelieving he his word and now and now today as we see the church natural in in your intellectual gospel gospel going further and further away from from from the word in the Social Gospel we find that the women of the world on the streets members of such as carrying themselves in in the same atmosphere you can't tell them they've lost all all sense of common decency uh the the the the the people have see and that's the way and that's the way the church has and you can see it going straight straight straight to to to to to to the to the to the acumenical council just as certain as anything as anything in in in the world and right into Rome as hard as as it can go see cuz it's prophesied and there she is that's her behavior but so so so so so so so so so so we can we can step back back and look around us we and we see we we see how how how these nations are falling apart and how these churches churches have completely turned turned have completely turned turned turned to to to the world and yet the this whole entire world is is she's in an atmosphere and she's right for judgment um um um a a and the prophet Prophet told us told us told us that that that that if God does doesn't doesn't judge doesn't judge America soon he's obligated to to to raise up to raise up Sodom Sodom and gorah and and apologize to but but but but yet at the same time the same time that judgment was was was was was falling on on on on on that City God God God was sitting there making a making a unconditional Covenant Covenant with with with Abraham and we and and we we as the bride of Christ when this when when when the when when when others rule is falling apart and judgment is striking is is striking the the the the the the world over the bride is sitting there in full confidence and and full Authority and in full Assurance because God has made an unconditional Co Covenant Covenant Covenant Covenant Covenant W with her the the the this this world has has has created has has has created such such an and and and and and atmosphere that that that that the things that things that that we used to see see see see see when I was a kid would would would shock you but but now but but now you see the same thing and it's just another day on the streets why because this world this world is completely the atmosphere that this world has has has has has has created is right for judgment but but but yet as the bride of Christ we can stand there in full assurance and in full confidence knowing that the that that that that the atmosphere that work that we're creating is is is is creating that atmosphere for for a Rapture brother random says said said that uh you you you you you get around around where where there where there's where there's where there's arguments and you get in into that type that type of of an atmosphere if there's something if there's something in the church someone who who's who's disobedient and very ugly acting acting acting acting in the church and causing trouble you'll never be able to have a Revival as long as that kind of of of an atmosphere of an atmosphere fear fear it is around and so you have to have everybody he he he said he said he says he says if you'll notice when the Holy Spirit came came came came came on when the Holy Spirit came on on on on on on Pentecost they were all in one place and in one Accord and waiting and waiting for for uh a and waiting for a a promise and when we get like that the the Revival will be there then he said that's right it's an outpouring it's an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and and so so so so so so when but but when those Believers those Jews they were they were standing around that pool and they were just watching for any any kind of kind of a movement of a movement on that water but but but when water when that water began to move it was a sign the the the waters have have have had had been been been been been troubled it was time to throw down your clutches or or or jump off your C or whatever it was and and jump and and and and and jump in there because it was a sign that God was there and something was fixing to take place but but but and and and and and and today we as the bride of Christ we are watching we are watching for the movement for the movement of God and and and and we know that and we know that Waters always means it's it's always a symbol a symbol of people of people in the Bible in in uh Revelations chapter chapter 17 says says says says the thickness and multitudes of people is in the water so so so so so so so so so when we as the bride of Christ Christ Christ Christ when when this bride has has come has come has come to together under such an atmosphere around the word of God when when when you see the Waters of the people coming coming coming coming to to to to coming together from from from all over the world and they begin to gather they began to gather on onto the word word onto the word for this day and and in this hour why what is it it's a sign that that that that that that that that God is getting ready to to to to to do something and and and I say he is doing doing something all across the world we see we see the signs and the Miracles and and God's people standing forth on on on on her feet with all authority and with all power and she's and what she declares God backs it up why because she is part of the of of of the body of Christ and what she says God backs up she is standing here with all authority and with all power and she and she's gathered around and that atmosphere has started has started has started to to to to to to create itself where where where we become and one mind and one Accord and just like they did they did they did and in that upper room and they were with their one mind and one Accord we are standing across the world today the bride of Christ and I'm not talking about the these um these um these denominational people or even or even or even people who who who who claim the message but but but but they constantly are arguing with the prophet and constantly constantly saying saying well that's just that's just that's just that's just he his opinion or or or or they argue about the cloud or they are they they um argue about the pillar of fire but yet the True Body of Christ I'm saying the ones the ones who standing firm on the word of God that God has sent to us and in in our last day where where where they're standing forth and they're Gathering and they're Gathering under that that that that that fresh Mana in these last days and they're standing forth and that atmosphere is come has come to such a place where where where Revival is breaking out across this country we we we we we are seeing people healed we are seeing the lame walk the blind the blind see and the dumb he just just just just just just just just just the the the the uh other day I I I I have a cousin and she was ate up with eczema where it was covering from her her from head to foot and she said she would just sat there and cry because the amount of pain of the amount of pain that that that that it was causing her and they laid hands on her and and prayed over and she woke up the other day completely not a scar on her head to feet of nothing with not a scar on her on her on her on her on her anywhere why it was we as a bride of Christ we are standing forth and that atmosphere has been has created into such a place where we are Marching forward every single day and nothing is going to stop this this this this this bride um and we look at David and and and and and with David he he he was saying he was saying Lord do do do I I I pursue the Philistines or do I not and and and and and what do I do and and I'm sure the the the the um anticipation of David's man as and because they were nervous and they were scared and wondering if they was ever going to see their loved ones again but God told David you go and and and and and and hide by the mberry bushes and when those when you see the rustling in the mberry bushes it is time for you to grab your sword and go fight and I'm sure those men those men was sitting there and and maybe and and maybe they were wondering are these bushes are are these bushes going to rustle in he day now and and I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure maybe they they had them Philistines marching up the off that road and I'm sure they were getting scared and often nervous and all of a sudden they heard that rustling and and it was their sign that God was was was was was was with them and and and David Rose up and he smoked the Phil but but but and yet we as the bride of Christ we are we are standing here U um standing here with all authority and in all power knowing exactly who we are and that water is being troubled and those mes those those bushes are shaken back and forth and it's time for us today as the bride of Christ to rise forth and claim and claim our god-given rights as the bride of Christ brother random said said said said said um I tell you what but brother brother today today if if there ever was a time since I can since I can since I can re re re remember or any time that I that I read in in in in history since since the going away of our Lord Jesus Christ the coming of the holy spirit in the first age it's today it's it's it's today there's a sign there's a movement in the mberry bushes God is moving ahead in this nation just as sure as as as anything signs and wonders and wonders are are our beginnings are beginning are beginning are beginning are beginning to appear and and and that we see we're we're at the end time we're right now merging into the greatest Revival that this world has ever seen and we're right now emerging into the greatest destruction that's ever hit all mankind since since there ever was was a world we as the bride of Christ we we we we are we are standing up and I know I keep I keep saying this lot but but if we can only grasp it we are we we have we have we have come to realize just who exactly we are We Are The Bride of Jesus Christ and we can stand there with all authority and in all and in all power and all confidence knowing knowing that God has called us on on onto the last days those mberry bushes are shaken the atmosphere has just is just right so now we can stand stand up and we can we can take our sword and we can March forward with all confidence and in all Assurance knowing that God is with us 1 Thessalonians 1 1: 15 says says says says says says for Our Gospel came not came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as we know what manner manner of men of of men we were among you for your sake so so so so we so so we're not standing here and and just and and just and just and we're not standing here just reading the Miss message we're not standing here just just just just just just reading the Bible like like like like any like like any like any any any any any old book we're not we're not sitting there listening listening to to to to to the message like like like it's just another story we are standing there and we are standing there and in and in all power and in and in the power of that of that of that Holy Ghost go ghost and we're demonstrating it and power that that this bride it will not be deceived again she is the Invincible Army of Jesus Christ brother R says says says we cannot have a we cannot H have a healing service here until people gets in the spirit in the spirit of healing service we cannot have a filling a filling of a filling of the Holy Ghost until people gets in that kind in that kind in that kind of an atmosphere and the people was was in the atmosphere in that day in that day to bring judgment upon the Earth Earth and they're in the same atmosphere again again again again today eating drinking and Maring giving a marriage and and and and and all this and all this and all this kind of thing all this kind of thing like that and and the glory of God is being preached and demonstrated in the power of the Holy Ghost setting forth setting forth an example of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's going to take the church into Glory but just as certain as I'm standing here that's right and men are ignoring it paying no attention to it walking away from it because they're in the spirit of the last days and so so so brother Ram said said um um um in another quote he says he he says he he he says he says he he he said he he said you would like to know what I think the greatest need the greatest need of the Church of the Church of the Church of the church church today is what what I what I think the lacking is there's no there's no there's no soul soul travailing the people are not broke up enough there's no burden there's there's no burden there's no burden seemingly and and you give me someone that's just so tore up about lost souls that that they are just wanting a r Revival so bad that that they just can't they can't they just they just can't hardly eat they simply can't if you read the history of the world of the world you'll find out it's always taken that kind of a spirit to to bring a Revival that's right see when Zion when Zion when Zion travailed and why why why then she brought forth children you see you have to be tore up it's the atmosphere of anything and what is it we we we we see it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's my poost my it's it it's signs hanging up everywhere that that that we are in the end time um um and and yet it's kind of like my wife is is is is is expecting back there and and and and and when we first when we first found out she didn't show you couldn't you couldn't tell tell tell tell you couldn't you couldn't tell telling anything but yet as time goes on you begin to see the life that's forming in in in inside of her and and today we just found out it's a girl it's a girl by the way um actually just just just just before service but uh but but but but but yet we see the mile poost that's happening she's at 7 17 weeks I think now and yet every week there's another mile poost and you'll say she's the size of a of a grape and I'm like I don't care and then she'll say it's the size of of of a of a grapefruit I'm like I still don't care and she says it's the size of a watermelon and I'm like I can tell no but but but yet we see the we we see the mile poost the the the the the mile poost of it coming and and and and within a couple of short months I'll be holding my precious little baby girl girl girl girl girl in my and and and and and my arms but but yet but yet we as a bride of Christ we we can sit there and we can look at all the mile poost that that that God's been sending our our our way we we see that men are lovers lovers are men more more than lovers of God we we we we we see the the distress of Nations we we we see that the the lukewarmness that's sweeping this this this nation we see we we see the the the softness of of of man of mankind everywhere and and yet we as a bride of Christ we can sit there and read the signs and know and know that our Redemption is drawing nigh why why why why why why what is it it's it's the mile poost when when when we're traveling to somewhere I'll uh I I I've got it on my GPS and let's say I'm driving to Oklahoma to to to to my hometown and and it'll say 999 Mi to to Tulsa Oklahoma and we're driving and after like an hour or two it'll it'll say 800 miles to Tulsa and and and and yet as we're driving along we we start passing these these these landmarks we'll pass up um we we'll uh we'll we'll pass up Nashville and then after a while after a while we'll pass the St Louis Arch and and then we'll cross over to that oklah that that that that Oklahoma border and before you know it a and and and before you know it the atmosphere in the car cuz my kids they they they hate driving and and and so they start they start realizing they they they they start to they start to realize that hey we're almost there and so all the fussing that that that that had been going on when the kids are going are we there yet or I got to go to the bathroom or or it's or stop touching me or it's or it's or it's Mom it's Mom she looked at me wrong you know and it's all this fussing and fighting but yet but yet as we get closer and we're say kids we got one more hour and they sit up brighte eyed looking around and then they begin to sing because we're almost there and and the atmosphere in that car begins to change and and and and and and and and and yet and yet the excitement that that starts to build up build up because just any minute they get to see me and me and Papa and or they get to see their Uncle Wendell or or or whoever it is it is and they get excited and all of a sudden they don't have to go to the bathroom anymore and all of a sudden they're no longer fussing fussing anymore cuz the atmosphere that that the anticipation of the long trip the whole 16 hour hours they're finally there and yet we as the bride of Christ when when when when when when we have seen the mile post go by and and what what might seem a little bit of of fussing and fighting amongst ourselves when yet all of a sudden we be we begin we began to realize that hey we're almost there and all of a sudden the anticipation and the excitement saying just any day now we get to see our Lord Jesus Christ the atmosphere the the anticipation begins to build up and we begin to get an excitement our excitement starts happening when when we walk when when when we press play on a tape our excite our excitement builds up even more as we walk through the house of God do them do them doors knowing that that Jesus is going to meet us here once again and and yet one day when we'll get to cross over on the the other side well there will be no more crying there'll be no more tears there there'll be all all the sadness will be wiped away all the Mind battles all the Mind battles are going to be gone and and and y'all won't and and and and y'all won't have to hear me stutter anymore that's what I'm looking forward to the most but but but watching that we as the spiritual bride of Christ when we began to have a Revival when she yeah the brother brother random say said say that when the spiritual bride when she begins to have Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up we line herself up line herself up up line herself up with the word in our up up with the word of God watch watch then again you see how how how that that the that that the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman that elect why so so so so so so this bride of Christ we have we have lined ourselves up We Begin marching onward onward to the tune of Onward Christian Soldiers and and yet we see the world the the the churches of the world they falling off they're falling off the edge of the off the edge but we as a bride of Christ we are Marching In perfect step and a perfect and in Perfect Harmony and we're marching upwards and onwards why why because we just any day now we get to march on up on up and out of here so so so so you begin to to to look at the troubling of the water the angel he when when um he would come down he would begin to stir that that that that that that water up maybe just dip his finger and then start spinning it around that pool to to where it become all choppy but but but the angel he made that atmosphere so so so he made that atmosphere so much through that the people's expectations they were just expecting it they were it was it was like soon as that water moves and and maybe they they they jumped in there when when some wind was blowing it and it wasn't even e e e e even even the angel but yet their expectation was so high high high high high that when that angel came down BR brought that atmosphere down and began to Stir It Up that that the people's expectations was so high was was was so high that they would all be diving in there the first man to touch it was the first man to get healed but but but yet we as but but but but yet we as the bride of Christ we were just like we was just like that eagle that eagle and and and in the barnyard we was content every day with just with just with just pecking away at some corn on on the grass or or or or or or or or just the bugs the the the um the the bugs and yet one day we heard a scream and we looked up and we began to change we began to change to to to change the atmosphere that that that that that we was in we was no longer just just pecking around the Barnyard but but yet we begin to set them wings and fly up higher and higher to where to where to where we we was no longer a a barnyard a barnyard chicken but we was a Heavenly bird and we were soaring above it all why be because we have heard that prophet in our last days scream out scream out there to us and and and yet when we heard that it caused us to look up and realize that that that we were not some denominational chicken we're not some kind of denominational meal just just heha around everywhere but but yet we are we are and and and and and and an eagle and an eagle is made to rise above it all and we begin to change that atmosphere and set them wings and we begin to soar above it and soar higher and higher and higher to to to to to where to to where them old denominational chickens chickens I was clucking away at us we long know we we no longer heard them we we we we we we was no longer in in in in in in in anticipation for that farmer to come out and throw us some some seed every morning we we was no longer no longer no longer um um um um um worried about the about the rain showers and the thunderstorms that that they used to come and scare us why because now we could just soar above it all why because we are eagles and our atmosphere has had has has now changed we are no longer a denominational a denominational chicken or a mule not knowing who mama was or who Daddy was or or or or or just wondering about from day to day wondering if you was going to be the next the next the next the next chicken pot pie we have become an eagle and our expectation has risen above above anything above anything that that this world could could ever offer us brother bam said he said said he said said if you take if you take a chicken egg if you take a chicken egg from underneath the chicken and you put it and you put it and you put it underneath the pup it's going to hatch why why if you put if you put it if you put it if you put it the same egg and put it and put it and put it and then and then and then and then incubator it's it's it's it's it's still going to hatch why why why why why because it's the atmosphere that that that that that that that you put it in and is well what what we need what what we need now is a Holy Ghost is a Holy Ghost is a Holy Ghost is a Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost atmosphere an atmosphere where the power of God is moving with one Accord and one place Gathering Gathering Gathering Together underneath underneath underneath underneath that atmosphere of expecting God of expecting God of expecting God to to to to to to to to to move to move down and do signs and wonders let's move ourselves let's move ourselves up into that bracket and and step and step up in faith and move out and and and move and and move out out out and move out of of these three dimensions and into the fourth one why be um brother bam said said said um said uh that's the way that's the way we we we have we we we have that's the way that that that's the way we have to get in the seed form all the one cord in one place they was blessing God they was blessing God God God they was blessing God they was blessing God for the Holy Ghost which had never yet come but they believed that that it was because God was going to keep his promise and when they kept when they kept on on blessing God until that atmosphere got just right and there came a sound and then and then there came a sound from heaven like a rushing by the wind and it filled all the house and it filled all the house house house it filled all the house house house where they were sitting see the atmosphere got just right he said oh couldn't we get an atmosphere here that every crippled every blind every sick person everything all with one Accord believing believing until the sick he said he he said he said I seen it I seen it I seen it last last last week last last week whether there was a person left they just pile they just piled up the crutches and Wheelchairs and Cs and I was standing I was standing at the platform preaching and and and they just and they had just had just beg to raise up and throw and and and throw them things down and because the atmosphere got just right he said oh brother God he said oh brother God send us an atmosphere that that that that'll make it of one Accord of one place and let the power of God surge down down through that atmosphere gets just right it opens up every it opens up it it opens up it opens up and moves back every clock everything the law of God will move and so so so so so so so so now we can see now that it's the atmosphere of what we create if if if if if if if if during our meeting our meetings these next week if if if if if we want if if if if we want to get healed if if if have an atmosphere of of you want to get if you want to get delivered if if if there's an atmosphere of of of of of I have questions in my mind or whatever it it it it of whatever it may be we can show up with that with that kind of an atmosphere in our hearts and we can begin to create create that that that atmosphere as those men of God who have dedicated their lives to to this message and and and and and and to and and and and and to and to the gospel where where where where where where we can create that atmosphere to to where they don't have to fight it they can just step in in and and and into it and begin to watch God and begin to watch God God change lives and begin to watch God God God answer questions and heal the sick and and and and whatever it is that we have have H have have need of we have to create create create the the atmosphere for it why because because it's an atmosphere for a Revival that's what the bride of Christ Christ has has has come to but but but but we notice when Jesus when Jesus went went into into into his his his his own country many many mighty works works works he cannot do do because of their of their what their unbelief see see see see see see see no matter no matter how powerful God was no no no matter no matter no matter no matter no matter how how H how how how how great he was no no no no no now no matter no matter that he was he was God standing in flesh WRA wrapped in flesh he he could only do as much as as as as they believed God but but he could do he could not do anything on on until the right atmosphere was was what was was created on until their faith on until until their faith came came came came came to such a level that that that that that that that God that God could could could could move could move on their behalf and uh and and and and and we notice that there's some people they just they have their ups and downs and and one minute they're they're happy and the next minute they're sad and one minute God loves them the next minute God hates them and yet yet they're they're constantly discouraged or then they're happy and then they're just up and down up and down up and down but yet we find that those people are not have not have not moved have not moved in in into to the holiest of holies they they they they're they're they're they're they're in those those those outter courts courts daily but but but yet but yet they're they're they're they're feeding on the manner every day but but but but but they don't live that kind of life where where where where they have entered in in into the holiest of of of of of holies they're they constantly got the good days and they got the bad days but then yet but then yet but then yet yet yet yet yet you've you've you've you've met people who have entered into the holiest of holies and and no matter what the weather is whether it's raining or snowing or storming outside no no no no no no matter if if the storms of life have just knocked them over all over sideways they they're still they're still standing there with a smile with a smile with a with a smile on the face and trusting in God because he and he's on the housetop to just just just just just just just just all the time he's found that that that that secret place that that that Hol of holies he has found an atmosphere an atmosphere an atmosphere an atmosphere to live in and and and and and and brother Ram said said said said said you take a man sitting here here here you take a man sitting here this morning and that's not a bit sick and let him begin to get to get to get to begin let him begin to get in his heart believing he is sick they'll pack him they'll pack him him him him out out of the building as your faith is so be it on on on so be it on on so be it on on on unto you he said that's not Christian Science I'm not meaning I'm not meaning a mind over matter but you see the thing thing of it is it's the atmosphere that you live in and as the eagle and as the eagle has can can can can can renew re renew its use re as an eagle has has renewed has renewed his his his his use his youth the that revival can can can can can can that that that revival can come and and and and and shakes all the funny all the all the funny feelings away from you and you can fly out and you can fly out in in into an atmosphere out out out out out out out out out out yonder because because his Heritage because we as the bride of Christ Our Heritage is likened UN un unto unto unto an eagle where where where an eagle can can can can can renew can renew can and renew his his his his youth when when when he gets all when he gets all down and discouraged and maybe just a little bit a little bit a little bit uh beat up where where where where he can hardly pick his head up anymore he he can no longer he can no longer fly fly fly up up up up in those up up in into those those those heavenlies where where where where where where where maybe his eye just isn't as strong as what it used to be where everything's a little clouded over to him where where where where it seems like it seems like he's us down in the dumps all the time but but but yet we we we we as an eagle because God because God has given us has given us us us us us as God has given us the ability to to to rise above all of our problems and all of the storms but but yet but yet yet we can come and and and and be renewed and and and and be renewed if you can get in the right at atmosphere and that's what that's what makes a a shout that that's that's that that that's what what makes us what makes us us us us us us what makes us us us get get get excited it's because we have something to to to to to to to praise God about to shout about to dance about that and and and that and that's why and that's why you'll see the old the old people and the young people both up up up on the front up there up there up there on the front row on the front row of a church just dancing away because God because because we have something to shout about we have we have something to sing about why why because because if we get we can get inside inside of that atmosphere then then it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what hits us it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter matter matter matter M it doesn't matter matter what we're going through we can when we come when we come to that atmosphere and we begin to when when we when we get around when we get in that atmosphere and we step in into the holiest of holies it doesn't it doesn't matter what anybody else says it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what's going on at work it doesn't matter it it doesn't matter if you hit a if you total your car your car your car on the way over over tonight it doesn't it doesn't matter what happens you've stepped in in into that that that's that that that's that you stepped into that Hol of holies where where there's no natural there's there's there there there's no natural light there's no natural noises coming it's just you and the kind of Glory of God shining down shining down down shining down shining down on you where where why because because we have come the bride has come under such under under such such under such a and anointing in these last days day days days Days days to where where she's old and beat down and she she can't hardly fly anymore we can renew ourselves a as an eagle and Rise Above It All where we are made to soar and the heavenlies why why be we have come under an atmosphere and an anointing that only the bride of Christ that only the the the the bride of Christ of of Christ of of of the only only the bride of Christ can have brother random said said said said said he said the anointing is not in emotions the anointing is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how and that's and that's what what what what what what what what's here why so we're not we're not we're not all emotional and wondering what's going to happen from day to day and we're not up and down why because the anointing we have come under a supreme power and we have supreme Supreme supreme Supreme control over whatever that that devil will will will will throw our our our our our our way why because we why because we have created an atmosphere an atmosphere around us we have we have we we we we have Rose above above the Barnyard and into the heavenlies CU we heard that we heard we we heard that screaming we have realized just exactly who we are God brother brother brother brandom said that God wants God wants wants he God wants eaglets he wants Messiahs he wants men and women who have signs and wonders anointed ones he wants a church that's filled that's filled that's filled with the Holy Ghost a church that's reflecting him the same yesterday today a and and and and forever God has not died he just borne the kingdom he he he's got he he he's got his he's got his Messiah at at he's got his Messiah at at in it amen every word he says they say amen and that's right yes sir they look like him they act like him they they believe it and they've got the conductor moving right on out with signs and wond and wonders for following that's messiah messiah lives lives tonight he isn't dead he is alive forever forever more amen amen do you love him do do you love the Lord um and just just one more quote if if the musicians if musicians will come see if I can find it here this is a prayer if I can find it that brother Brandon prayed it was a powerful prayer I was just scrolling through something and and and and reading it I don't know where it's at but anyways um um but but but but yet we but Christ has understood has understood understood understood has Christ has understood he he his his his his his position no no no no matter no matter no matter the storms he faced um to where to where in in in the garden of of of of of GE of GE of GE of GE Gethsemane he he he sat there and travailed so much where where actually the great drops were were were were come were beating up a sweat on on his forehead to where the whole weight the whole weight weight the whole weight to weight of the world was upon him but yet but yet but yet no matter all the storms he faced up to the death of the Cross yet he stood in in his position knowing who he was standing confident in who he was and yet we are little are our Messiahs and no matter what comes our way no no no matter what storms rise against us we can stand confident in Who We Are We Stand worthy through the blood of Jesus Christ not in ourselves and one more quote here and um um uh this this this right here here was powerful it says now the gospel common believed is the word of God and and that is true in one sense but the word of God is not the gospel alone the word of God is the seed that produces the gospel and Jesus had a s went forth went forth and slded seed and some fell in Stony places and and and and and some and some and some and some some fell fell by the wayside and the fouls of the of the air had and fouls of the of of the of the air devoured them and some fell fell upon Thor thorny thisle ground and some went over and some went over and and and and and and brought and brought a a and brought a a hund fold now the seed you see now the seed you people here who are farmers every seed will produce if it's the right kind of ground and every Divine promise of God in the Bible will it will Pro produce if it's met in the white kind of heart it'll it will it will Pro produce the promise if you have if if you have if you have the the need of of of of of if you have the need of Salvation believe that he saves you and that and you accept and you accept his his sacrificial death and ye and ye shall shall and ye shall shall receive what you've asked for if you are weary and glooming and and feel like everyone's against you he said come unto me All Ye Ye that labor and and are and are heavy laden I will give you rest that's a seed accept it and if you're sick he was wounded for our our for our for our for our transgressions and with the stripes we are healed accept it it's a seed it will it will produce itself and when you sew a seed you don't dig it up every morning every morning to to to to to to see to see if if it's come to pass if you do your seed will will never come up you've got to plan it commit it and let it alone it's up to Nature God it's up to Nature and God God ends up to God to water and to see and to see and to see what what and to see what what it produces is is is is that true so so that's the way you do the word of God accept in a good heart already fertilized and all the creepers and the rocky places and the Stony doubts is taken away and in good rich soil of Faith believe it com commit it come come commit it to God and and and walk away testifying that you have received what God has all what God has has what God has promised promis promised you and he's the high priest of your confession to make right anything that that you confess that he has done that's the gospel now the gospel isn't only the word now he now now now now this part here could you imagine be people people freezing to death and I would paint them a picture of fire and say look at that fire burning isn't it warm look at all the people standing around there warming but that's only a picture of something that has been you just freeze up the same and and he he he he he said he said you just free just the same same same same same looking at the picture what what what it takes is that fire to to to to to fire to be to be to be reproduced again for your warmth and and the gospel that was in that day it's written in the word as a history a pain and fire of what was except the same seed that they accept and it will become a living a living a living a living reality in you that'll bring you into the same experience that they had and and according according to the writers of the scripture the great the great the the the great Paul the great St Paul said the gospel came to us not by word only but through Power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost and when Jesus commissioned the church to go into all the world and preach the gospel he he said go into the go world and preach the gospel to every creature and he and and he that believeth believeth and is baptized shall be sa saved but he that but he that that but he that that believeth not in these signs shall shall follow follow them that believe um so we as a bride of Christ we can stand here in all in all confidence in all assurity knowing that the same experience that that they had on Acts chapter 2 the same atmosphere that that they that that that that that they have H have have that they have have that they had created created in that room toward where the day of Pentecost fell we as the bride of Christ can stand here knowing that that we can stand here and and take that and take the same thing take that same seed and water it and water in our hearts till atmosphere begins to form to where to where God can come down and move in our midst to to where where to where where whatsoever things that that we have have have have have need of have whatsoever things that we have have need of can happen why because we are standing here with all authority and all power and all confidence as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen do you love him [Music] amen oh this is the evening time all things are R now
