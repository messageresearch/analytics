[36:25] a little for for just a few minutes on
[36:27] on step in into division
[36:30] and uh um this thought's been on my
[36:33] heart for uh um a couple months now so
[36:37] um I'm sorry if it seems chopped up I'm
[36:39] I'm feel kind of scattered tonight so
[36:40] you all just have to help me out here
[36:42] um but but I I kind of wanted to take
[36:44] the thought back from uh Michelangelo
[36:47] when he when he's um when he when when
[36:50] he when he um when he scoped the image
[36:53] of of of of Moses and um and if you any
[36:57] if you've heard the message the the the
[36:59] Masterpiece you you you you uh you uh
[37:02] you you know you know all the background
[37:05] will go down from this but Michelangelo
[37:08] had spent a lifetime of of of of of of
[37:11] of of of trying to make this this this
[37:13] statue this image that he had in his
[37:16] head of Moses and and and and and and
[37:19] and and and and and and and and and and
[37:20] we noticed that was what was in the back
[37:22] of his mind he he would sit there and he
[37:24] would he he picked out this slab of
[37:26] marble or granite or whatever it was he
[37:28] used and he sat there and studied it and
[37:30] studied it and then he would come up and
[37:33] and uh he would take his hammer and
[37:35] chisel and he would he would knock a
[37:37] little bit off he'd back up again and
[37:38] just study it and then you come back and
[37:40] and and he chose a little bit more he
[37:42] said he said it was a lifetime of of of
[37:45] of of of of of of of an achievement of
[37:47] of of of of of of of his his work and
[37:50] dedication because it was burned in His
[37:52] image in his back his head so hard of
[37:54] what he wanted and and year after year
[37:57] after year he he he he he he
[38:00] um he uh worked on this and and and and
[38:04] and and and and at the end of it all he
[38:06] he step back and he laid down his his
[38:09] Amber in the Chisel and what he's seen
[38:12] while that was in the back of his head
[38:14] now became manifested into him in a
[38:17] physical form of the stone and he got he
[38:19] got so inspired that they took a hammer
[38:21] and he struck the kneecap of that statue
[38:24] and said speak and it's called
[38:26] Michelangelo's
[38:29] to be saying he said it wasn't
[38:31] necessarily just as just the statue that
[38:34] was the Masterpiece but it was the
[38:35] inspiration of him actually striking
[38:37] that kneecap they called it the
[38:38] Masterpiece because of that strike on
[38:40] the knee because he had such an
[38:41] inspiration and such a vision and and
[38:44] what was in the back he said
[38:47] um he became manifested
[38:50] into a physical form and he and and and
[38:53] and in front of his his head and uh and
[38:57] uh um and and
[38:59] brother Brandon what would would go back
[39:01] and he he he he would start he would he
[39:04] he would start speaking about this he
[39:06] would said and how how how did that how
[39:08] that that that that was a perfect type
[39:10] of of Christ and and and all throughout
[39:12] throughout the Old Testament he he he he
[39:15] he he was he was he was protest
[39:18] portrayed throughout the the the the the
[39:21] the the old the Old Testament I'm sorry
[39:24] guys y'all's gonna have to help me out
[39:25] here I'm I don't know why I'm doing this
[39:26] so bad tonight
[39:32] a foreshadow and just an image of what
[39:35] was Christ in the Old Testament he he
[39:37] became he became the Masterpiece in the
[39:39] New Testament where he was just a rock
[39:42] in the wilderness whereas the water
[39:43] coming out of that rock where where he
[39:45] where he he it was just a stone it was
[39:48] it was a stone that had not come in into
[39:51] into its its its Perfection yet but but
[39:54] it was it was a it was a type and and a
[39:57] follow it followed Israel Israel Israel
[40:00] throughout throughout the Wilderness and
[40:03] it would give life and it would give it
[40:06] it would give it would give water to to
[40:08] those that were thirsty in that drying
[40:10] bearing land but he was the he was the
[40:12] Rocky and he was that rock in the
[40:14] wilderness where where he where he he
[40:17] had not been made into a man yet but he
[40:19] was only a type and a shadow what was to
[40:20] come Moses Moses
[40:23] Moses Moses Moses was standing there and
[40:27] he asked God he hey so one thing that I
[40:29] want to do in my flesh he said is I want
[40:31] to see God and and and God told him to
[40:33] go and go and stand over here and and to
[40:36] watch me as I passed by and but when he
[40:39] passed by all he seen was it was the
[40:41] back part of the man but
[40:42] you see you see the great sculpture was
[40:45] was presenting to to to to to to to to
[40:48] Moses the potential image of Christ of
[40:52] what that Great Masterpiece peace peace
[40:55] peace would look like would look like
[40:57] when it was when it was um um um
[41:01] um
[41:05] it wasn't the it wasn't a fully
[41:07] manifested image yet but but it was just
[41:09] a glimpse up of what of of what was to
[41:12] come
[41:13] but but but but but but but see but see
[41:16] but see but see my my Michelangelo who
[41:20] when he got so inspired he could only
[41:22] cry out and smite the image and say
[41:25] speak but how different it was to God
[41:27] when when that great when when him as
[41:30] the master as the master sculpture he
[41:33] went went
[41:35] when he's when he saw when we win
[41:37] winning when that image I was in the
[41:40] back of back of his mind as Christ and
[41:43] it became so perfect and it reflected it
[41:45] was God himself himself coming into man
[41:48] it was a perfect image of Christ and God
[41:50] spoed him and said speak and and slowed
[41:52] him on Calvary why why it was for us as
[41:56] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:00] throughout all the history the the um
[42:03] the the the prophets and the and the
[42:06] people of Israel through old they they
[42:09] were not in their full image yet they
[42:11] they they they they they they were all
[42:14] just in their in their in their
[42:17] potential image they he he he he he he
[42:21] um about what they were doing is they
[42:22] were foreshadowing and showing what what
[42:25] was to come
[42:27] but see he started down in the feet and
[42:30] he began working he he began working his
[42:32] way up forming and shaping this
[42:34] masterpiece
[42:36] until until
[42:38] he got to Christ and it was the fullness
[42:41] of that man of that Masterpiece was
[42:42] manifested that was in the back of God's
[42:45] mind it became manifested right there
[42:47] right there as Jesus Christ crisis so
[42:49] what was in the back of his mind all of
[42:51] a sudden the fullness of that
[42:53] manifestation was their anger God and
[42:56] God slowed him and God smoked him for us
[42:58] on on on on on on on Calvary so so see
[43:02] he was the Masterpiece to us he was the
[43:04] gift of God
[43:07] it was the gift of God it was it was
[43:09] eternal life to us
[43:11] throughout throughout the Bible
[43:15] about the Bible
[43:18] it was prophesied that that that that
[43:21] that that that that that that Christ
[43:24] that Christ was coming
[43:25] and and and and God's seen in his mind
[43:29] him sending Christ to die and and and
[43:31] and you know what no no no
[43:34] no no no no no no no no doubts since
[43:37] since
[43:38] um Isaiah since Isaiah prophesied that
[43:41] that that that that that there would be
[43:43] a virgin a virgin a virgin to to
[43:45] conceive
[43:47] no doubt since since Isaiah's time all
[43:50] the way all the way throughout
[43:53] throughout till um
[43:56] sorry since since Christ came
[43:59] that that these um
[44:01] so I'm choking up for some reason these
[44:03] um these these these virgins would would
[44:06] say oh it's going to be me I'm gonna be
[44:09] the one two two two two two half Christ
[44:11] and and and
[44:13] yet but yet but yeah but yeah when it
[44:16] came when it came down to Mary and and
[44:18] and and and and that angel and that
[44:20] angel that angel assists that angel
[44:23] stood stood before her and said fear not
[44:24] four four four four four four four four
[44:26] four four four four four four for you
[44:28] for you for you have been chosen chosen
[44:31] chosen for this thing and and and and
[44:35] even though she said she said she said
[44:37] why me I'm I'm just an insignificant and
[44:40] again insignificance nobody but yet when
[44:44] she seen herself in that word she she
[44:47] was able to she was able to step in into
[44:49] the vision of what God called her her
[44:51] what God called her to be and she said
[44:54] be it unto me according according
[44:56] according to Thy Word
[44:59] so so so so so now for for nearly for
[45:02] nearly two thousand years now now God
[45:04] has been making himself once again
[45:06] another Masterpiece because because
[45:08] because
[45:09] when when when when when when when he
[45:13] when he struck Adam Adam and the Garden
[45:15] of Eden he he uh he uh he uh took a
[45:18] piece off of him and he fashioned
[45:19] another Masterpiece he fashioned Eve and
[45:22] to where she became a perfect uh a
[45:24] perfect help me uh perfect help me and
[45:27] and and and uh brother Branham said that
[45:31] she was perfect and and and and and in
[45:34] every way but yet but but yet but yet
[45:38] but yet she she fell so so so so so God
[45:41] had to make had to make himself another
[45:42] Masterpiece and and when and when he
[45:45] smoked when he smoked Christ on Calvary
[45:47] he he he took that piece that he swung
[45:50] off of him and now he's been now he's
[45:52] been fashioning for the last two
[45:53] thousand years another Masterpiece to
[45:55] where she's coming up and she and he
[45:57] started at the feet in Luther and
[46:11] on up on up into the head and it's
[46:14] become a perfect Masterpiece and we're
[46:17] and she's called The Bride of Jesus
[46:18] Christ
[46:23] said that the Old Testament which was
[46:26] which was the foreshadowing of Christ
[46:27] and the new testament which was the
[46:30] foreshadowing of the Bride he he he said
[46:33] he he said he said she has now become
[46:35] husband or wife it's the old what was or
[46:39] was the old one was to foreshadow his
[46:42] shadow was to us two four shots shadow
[46:44] the the new and Christ come in Christ
[46:48] come the the the the he came out as the
[46:50] Masterpiece the Damascus to to to to
[46:53] fulfill his part but but now the his
[46:55] brother the bride is coming forth and
[46:57] she will fulfill everything that in the
[46:59] New Testament making another Masterpiece
[47:01] it is where another Masterpiece in the
[47:03] making
[47:04] and and just just as it's taken him
[47:09] four thousand years four thousand years
[47:10] to to to make to make to make to make to
[47:13] make this this this masterpiece now now
[47:16] he's been for for another for another
[47:18] two thousand years years he's making
[47:21] he's making this this this this this
[47:23] this other Muhammad
[47:26] Masterpiece as as the body of Jesus
[47:29] Christ
[47:30] and the doing so he he's doing it by his
[47:33] never-changing change changing changing
[47:36] method so so he so if if by his word if
[47:40] if by
[47:41] his word he he created he created the
[47:45] the first the first uh first Masterpiece
[47:47] then by his word he's creating the
[47:48] second Masterpiece
[47:50] and because because his word is perfect
[47:53] it can only be perfect this masterpiece
[47:55] that's coming up she's become a virtuous
[47:57] spotless bride of Jesus Christ so so any
[48:00] kind of dirt or trash or or injections
[48:03] injections of the denominations it won't
[48:05] fly because why because it has to be
[48:07] pure and perfect in the is standing in
[48:09] the word of God
[48:12] you gotta remember and and when when
[48:14] when we make a diamond
[48:17] he
[48:18] you a diamond won't cut uh are you
[48:21] nothing can can can can can can can cut
[48:25] a diamond at all there's nothing there's
[48:27] no there's nothing else else in the
[48:28] world that can cut it except for another
[48:30] Diamond
[48:31] but see not not just any kind of diamond
[48:34] will do it that diamond has to be has to
[48:36] be perfect weighed in in in in in in in
[48:39] in order in order for it to cut it and
[48:41] where where so that way there that
[48:43] they're the only thing that would ever
[48:45] shape this bride that will ever mold
[48:46] this bride will
[48:48] be the same material that the bride that
[48:51] that this bride is is that this bride is
[48:53] made out of so so if if God's word is a
[48:56] diamond the diamond and the bride and
[48:58] the bright then the bride has to be a
[49:00] diamond why because she's part of it
[49:02] it's the same person
[49:04] we're just taken out of Christ and now
[49:07] he's fashioning us and making us into
[49:09] the into the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:20] he said I am God and I changed not so he
[49:24] cannot change his his his
[49:26] method who what he did back then he has
[49:28] to do the same thing today and and so so
[49:31] so so so so we noticed that he started
[49:33] out on the day on the day of of of
[49:35] Pentecost just just like what brother
[49:37] Terry was was was preaching this morning
[49:40] on but he started he started on the Day
[49:43] of Dead benecost to to to build another
[49:45] Masterpiece it was the original seed
[49:51] it started it started
[49:53] it started in the first church
[49:56] what was that what was that for sure
[49:59] church it was just a seed that was
[50:00] planted in the ground and it came to
[50:03] come up and grow up and and and and and
[50:06] and and and and and and
[50:08] throughout history it's it's it it's
[50:12] come up and now it's and now it's coming
[50:14] to a full manifestation as a full seed
[50:16] of wheat
[50:17] why why because because
[50:20] it's the Harvest time it's going home
[50:23] time what we what we what what we were
[50:26] what we were in the force out of what we
[50:28] were to be now we're coming forth and
[50:30] we're standing here as a perfect
[50:33] spotless bride of Jesus Christ why it's
[50:35] his Masterpiece or what he spent the
[50:37] last four thousand years doing is now
[50:39] becoming manifested in flesh today on on
[50:42] Earth
[50:45] so so so so so so so we we we we we we
[50:49] we we notice we notice that there are
[50:52] two groups of of of people of people in
[50:54] the world today we we have the world and
[50:57] we have the bride it's just it's just
[50:58] putting it simply and and and and and
[51:00] and and and we know that God sees the
[51:04] world in one light and he sees us in in
[51:06] in in in a totally different light and
[51:09] and so so so so so so so so so so so so
[51:12] so when it was so we went when when when
[51:15] when when he sees the world he sees them
[51:17] as cannon fodder as well as as how
[51:19] brother random as how as our brother
[51:22] Branham put it but yeah well he asked
[51:25] the Bride of Jesus Christ when when he
[51:27] sees us he doesn't see us us us us as as
[51:31] a sinner he doesn't see us as as an
[51:33] alcoholic or as a druggie or or as an
[51:36] addict what he sees it says uh as is
[51:39] sinless we never did Sin in the first
[51:41] place and we can never since this is in
[51:42] afterwards why because God doesn't see
[51:44] God does not see this sins our lives he
[51:46] does not see see our imperfections when
[51:49] we stand before him we stand as a
[51:51] masterpiece who has a masterpiece
[51:54] so so God sees us as a redeemed son and
[51:57] daughter of God he sees us he sees us as
[52:00] his spotless bride but so so so so so so
[52:02] so we are his Masterpiece who win who
[52:06] win and he cries out speak and we go
[52:08] forward for with full Authority and full
[52:11] power knowing that that whatsoever we
[52:13] have we have we that we have have have
[52:16] need of of he is there he is there he is
[52:20] there too too fulfill to fulfill all
[52:22] things
[52:24] and uh Romans chapter 8 8 verse 27 it
[52:28] says
[52:30] hate that searches search at the hearts
[52:33] knoweth what is in the mind of the
[52:35] spirit because because he maketh because
[52:37] he maketh intercessions intercessions
[52:40] for for intercessions intercessions
[52:42] sessions for this I can't say that right
[52:44] now according according according to the
[52:46] will of God and we know that all things
[52:48] work together for good to them that love
[52:50] God to them who are who are called
[52:52] according to his poor purpose and and
[52:55] and and and and and and and here in this
[52:58] here in verse 29 says for whom he did he
[53:02] did he did for no he also did
[53:05] predestinate to to to be conformed to
[53:08] the image of his son that he might be
[53:10] the firstborn among uh firstborn among
[53:12] many many many
[53:14] many Brethren four four whoever whom he
[53:18] did press to be destined then he also
[53:20] called and whom he called them them them
[53:23] he he also Justified and whom he
[53:25] justified them he also glorified so so
[53:29] so so so so so so not only so so before
[53:32] the foundation of the world he he he is
[53:34] set aside brother Amos and and brother
[53:36] Bill and and sister Faith and all the uh
[53:39] and all all these brothers and sisters
[53:42] of this bride of Jesus Christ he's
[53:43] predestinated and he set him aside and
[53:45] set him apart and
[53:48] to to to shape them and conform them
[53:51] into the image of his son and why it was
[53:54] it would be another another Masterpiece
[53:56] why he he's called us and when he called
[53:59] us he justified and when he died and
[54:01] when he in and when he justified us it's
[54:04] as if we never did it did it did it did
[54:06] it it does if we never did it in the in
[54:08] in in in the first place why because why
[54:12] because and so now that he's Justified
[54:13] us he's going glorify this to where we
[54:15] are becoming as the as The Virtue is
[54:17] spotless brought to Jesus Christ
[54:19] but and um brother Branham said he said
[54:24] it says it said it says that he he he he
[54:27] he he he he he said I'm using this in a
[54:30] parable now of the Bible he said the
[54:32] Masterpiece the Masterpiece that that's
[54:33] coming forth as the Masterpiece fell
[54:36] there is a masterpiece Rising the
[54:38] Masterpiece the Beast of the Masterpiece
[54:40] fell at at and I see a Rome he said he
[54:43] said he he said he said after after
[54:45] night after night night see a Rome Rome
[54:49] he said she's come through a process but
[54:52] she's coming right back again to that
[54:54] Masterpiece perfected because she's a
[54:57] part of the word that was spoken by him
[54:58] he'll have a church without spot or
[55:01] wrinkle
[55:03] and and then he keeps on going and and
[55:06] says when he comes who or when he come
[55:09] he was in the fullness of the Kings the
[55:11] the of the fullness of the Kings and
[55:12] Prophets Hallelujah the godhead the
[55:15] godhead bodily rested in him and he and
[55:18] he and he comes to come to redeem out of
[55:20] their bride a masterpiece a masterpiece
[55:23] that says that says that says that says
[55:25] to to Satan that that he said a
[55:29] masterpiece that says to say says to
[55:31] Satan that when he says the days of
[55:32] Miracles have passed there's no such
[55:34] thing as these things that that that no
[55:36] such thing no such thing as these things
[55:39] that that you're talking about
[55:42] yeah and he says he he so he says he
[55:45] says get the get the get thee behind me
[55:47] Satan see
[55:48] see a masterpiece standing and guarding
[55:51] and he says sometimes the Capstone will
[55:55] be turned the head of it all and receive
[55:56] the bride on unto unto unto he himself
[56:01] so so so so so so so so so so now we
[56:05] realize now that that mankind in general
[56:07] is is is is is is a prisoner everything
[56:11] God God said God said that that that a
[56:15] man that a man that a man was a prisoner
[56:17] and so so until until something has
[56:20] happened has happened to the man man man
[56:23] man
[56:28] this was this was before the new birth
[56:31] but after the New Birth whatever
[56:33] whatever happens whatever happens
[56:35] happens happens
[56:37] to the man God God can come down
[56:41] in person and show this man man the the
[56:45] very the the very secrets and the depths
[56:47] and the depths of his heart but
[56:51] that that man can never can never see it
[56:54] he'll never understand it why because
[56:55] because our thoughts are not his
[56:58] thoughts our ways are not his ways him
[57:00] but so so so so uh until the Holy Ghost
[57:02] came came who there's no way there's no
[57:04] way we'd ever we would ever we would
[57:06] ever ever understand it so so we're our
[57:09] prisoner to our own selves but because
[57:13] because it's the human mind our minds
[57:15] can't comprehend the things that God
[57:16] ever but but but so all the so all the
[57:21] schools would go to all the readings all
[57:23] the teachings as good as as good as they
[57:25] may be they're they're they're they're
[57:26] they're they're they're they're useless
[57:28] because because without the Holy Ghost
[57:29] the ghost ghost you will never
[57:31] understand God but and but see mankind
[57:36] has to see himself as God sees them
[57:38] otherwise
[57:39] uh otherwise otherwise we'll constantly
[57:43] just beat ourselves up and be constantly
[57:45] dead down down down down down and down
[57:48] the dumps all the time oh always
[57:50] depressed saying I'll never I'll never
[57:51] be worthy I'll never make it up
[57:54] God doesn't love me anymore God doesn't
[57:56] like me anymore why because because of
[57:58] how much of a wretch I am
[58:00] and and and and yet we look at the
[58:03] Pharisees the the Pharisees of that day
[58:06] they had they had the law down to the
[58:08] letter that they were perfect in every
[58:10] way that you could possibly think of but
[58:11] yet but yet God still God he got God God
[58:14] said God said God God said you're
[58:16] nothing but full of Dead Man's Bones why
[58:18] why because because he blinded their
[58:21] eyes their eyes I eyes even though he
[58:24] performed the Miracles he performed the
[58:26] signs and the Wonders they can never
[58:27] catch they can never catch what what
[58:29] what what what what what what what what
[58:31] what God was
[58:33] and and so and it's the same same exact
[58:36] thing
[58:37] thing again again today people will say
[58:40] well that's just brother Brown's opinion
[58:44] he he he didn't real
[58:47] um he or or or or or or or or or or he
[58:50] he made him made a mistake here or or or
[58:54] or or or or or or or or or this is just
[58:57] his opinion there but
[58:59] see the eyes of the car on the mind they
[59:02] will never understand the things of God
[59:04] they will try they will fight against
[59:06] him and fight against it and fight
[59:08] against it but until you get that that
[59:09] Holy Ghost until you get the Holy Ghost
[59:11] down inside you and becomes a revelation
[59:14] on on on on on on on on on on to you
[59:18] you'll just have to spin your wheels
[59:19] although all day every day why because
[59:22] the human mind isn't isn't it it is is
[59:25] is enmity against God why why because
[59:28] you got to get out of your own your your
[59:30] your human mind and in human thoughts
[59:33] and then it's got to be it's got to be
[59:35] it's got to be burned away and you got
[59:37] to be born Born Again Born Again Born
[59:39] Again
[59:40] by the Holy Spirit and get the mind of
[59:44] God the mind of God in you
[59:46] in First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14
[59:48] says but the natural man receiveth not
[59:51] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[59:53] of God for they are foolishness on on on
[59:56] on
[59:57] to him him and it says it says neither
[1:00:01] neither can't neither can he he know
[1:00:03] them because they are spiritually they
[1:00:05] are spiritually discerned but he that is
[1:00:07] spiritual judges all things yet he
[1:00:10] himself is Judge of no man for who hath
[1:00:12] known the mind of the Lord that we may
[1:00:13] instruct him but it says we have the
[1:00:16] mind of Christ so us as the body of
[1:00:18] Jesus Christ so he will be because
[1:00:20] because because it has become a personal
[1:00:22] revelation
[1:00:25] we have been conformed into into into
[1:00:27] into into
[1:00:29] his his
[1:00:32] into into into his his image and his
[1:00:36] breathed the Breath of Life uh the
[1:00:38] Breath of Life of a breath of life in
[1:00:40] into us now now we can go forth with
[1:00:44] authority and power and stand and stand
[1:00:47] and stand on on every Divine promise of
[1:00:50] God and we can have the mind of God why
[1:00:53] why why because we see we can look
[1:00:56] around us we can see the signs of the
[1:00:57] time we can see what God said about us
[1:00:59] we can we can see we see ourselves in
[1:01:02] the vision of what God had for us since
[1:01:04] since abomination of the world and we
[1:01:06] can stand stand strong on that promise
[1:01:09] knowing that that he that that he that
[1:01:12] he that he who hath promised him is
[1:01:14] faithful and just to keep that promise
[1:01:17] um so
[1:01:18] so in uh in in uh in John Chapter 14
[1:01:22] verse 11 it says it says believe me that
[1:01:24] I am in the father and the father and me
[1:01:26] or else believe me for the very work's
[1:01:28] sake verily verily I say I say uh on on
[1:01:31] on to to you he he that he he that he
[1:01:37] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:01:38] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:01:41] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:01:43] father and whatsoever ye shall ask my
[1:01:46] name that will I do that the father may
[1:01:48] be glorified in the son if ye shall ask
[1:01:50] anything in my name I will do it
[1:01:55] and in Mark in Mark chapter 16 verse 17
[1:01:58] it says and these signs shall follow
[1:02:00] them that that that that that that that
[1:02:01] that that that that that
[1:02:03] belief in my name they shall cast out
[1:02:06] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:02:07] they shall take up serpents and they
[1:02:09] drink any deadly thing it shall not it
[1:02:11] shall not it shall not
[1:02:13] hurt them and and they shall they shall
[1:02:15] lay hands and hands on the sick and they
[1:02:18] shall recover
[1:02:21] and so we notice we can we can look here
[1:02:24] by the scriptures that says that says
[1:02:26] those who are called by his name and
[1:02:28] we've been conformed Into His Image
[1:02:30] where we can stand strong without my
[1:02:32] heart on on on on on on on the word of
[1:02:37] God and we can see what's promised for
[1:02:40] us in these last days where where where
[1:02:41] where he said whatsoever things ye shall
[1:02:44] ask of you speak unto this mountain and
[1:02:46] and not doubt it shall it shall it shall
[1:02:50] be cast shall be cast in in into the sea
[1:02:53] why
[1:02:54] because because because we become the
[1:02:57] Masterpiece and we're seeing our place
[1:03:00] and we're seeing what we're what we're
[1:03:01] called to be called to be the the the
[1:03:05] the world the world we we we we we we we
[1:03:09] look around us in the world is falling
[1:03:11] apart left and right but but but but but
[1:03:13] see she's falling into into into
[1:03:16] her her place whether she sees it or not
[1:03:19] she's falling in line with the word why
[1:03:21] because she has to but and she's right
[1:03:24] now ripe right before the Judgment as as
[1:03:27] as as brother Randall as as brother
[1:03:31] random put it but see the bride is also
[1:03:34] falling in and into into her place but
[1:03:38] but yet the difference between the Bride
[1:03:39] of the world is she has her eyes wide
[1:03:41] open and she sees exactly who and she
[1:03:43] sees exactly what's what's what's what's
[1:03:45] what's what's what's what's what's
[1:03:46] what's what's
[1:03:48] what she sees exactly what's going on
[1:03:52] and and and and but and and and so so
[1:03:56] she can stand on the word of God
[1:03:58] and and she can speak with full
[1:04:01] Authority and full power
[1:04:03] but you know what the bride the bride
[1:04:06] never goes never goes in into judgment
[1:04:09] she she she so so as the world is it is
[1:04:13] is going down into a tribulation and and
[1:04:15] and and and into a judgment the bride is
[1:04:19] going up into the Rapture and and and
[1:04:21] and and and to into into into
[1:04:25] everlasting life why why because because
[1:04:28] it's what she's called to be and she's
[1:04:30] recognizing and recognizing her place
[1:04:32] and stepping into the vision of what God
[1:04:34] has and what God has for and she's
[1:04:37] becoming uh the the the the she has
[1:04:40] become the Masterpiece that God has has
[1:04:42] has has has has uh
[1:04:47] created
[1:04:48] um
[1:04:49] so so so so so so but you notice God
[1:04:52] never never ever had us in the book of
[1:04:54] judgment he he he's always had us in the
[1:04:56] Lamb's Book of Life since before the
[1:04:58] foundation of the world so so so what
[1:05:01] it's what God sees us as he's never seen
[1:05:04] us has a sinner he's never seen us he's
[1:05:07] never seen us as as as as as somebody
[1:05:09] who who who who was barely getting by or
[1:05:13] or or or or or or or or
[1:05:16] um
[1:05:17] who who struggles to pray or or or or or
[1:05:20] or or whatever you need you're an issue
[1:05:21] your issue your issue may may may be and
[1:05:24] see he he's never seen us as that why
[1:05:27] because because down in the Lamb's Book
[1:05:29] of Life says before the foundation of
[1:05:30] the world all he reads on that book is
[1:05:32] spotless and he sees my name he sees
[1:05:35] brother Terry's name he sees brother
[1:05:36] Walker's name on that Lamb's Buck live
[1:05:39] and he can't help he can't see anything
[1:05:42] else about that why because why baby
[1:05:44] because because it were predestinated to
[1:05:47] it Hawaii
[1:05:52] even though even though we may be
[1:05:54] struggling who we may be fighting our
[1:05:56] day-to-day battles but but we're coming
[1:05:59] into a place where where we're realizing
[1:06:01] that now now we're realizing hold on a
[1:06:04] second I'm not just I'm not just just
[1:06:06] I'm not the same as my next-door
[1:06:08] neighbor I'm not the same as as my
[1:06:11] co-workers on the job site I am not the
[1:06:14] same same as the last as the lady as the
[1:06:16] lady at the at the checkout store why be
[1:06:18] why because we were realizing that we're
[1:06:21] predestinated for something different
[1:06:22] and when we're waking up and we're
[1:06:25] stepping into that position and we're
[1:06:27] seeing what we're called to be why we're
[1:06:29] called we are called to to be The
[1:06:31] Virtuous spotless Sprite of Jesus Christ
[1:06:34] and and there's nothing there's nothing
[1:06:36] in that now now now there's nothing now
[1:06:39] that can take this bride down but why
[1:06:41] she she she's coming she stepped into
[1:06:43] her position and she has the full
[1:06:46] Authority and power of the word backing
[1:06:48] her up
[1:06:49] and and the vision and the vision of of
[1:06:53] the of of that uh brother random had of
[1:06:55] uh from from Beyond the carton of time
[1:06:57] or or well he wasn't a vision
[1:06:59] necessarily he was actually there and
[1:07:00] and and and and and when he come back
[1:07:03] he says he says I've seen all of you
[1:07:05] there now now no no no no no no no no no
[1:07:08] no now now we realize now that that he
[1:07:11] wasn't talking about just the members of
[1:07:13] that congregation that was sitting there
[1:07:16] he's seen he's seen all of us on on on
[1:07:19] the other side he he he's saying he's
[1:07:22] saying he's saying um
[1:07:24] um brother shamaya and all these others
[1:07:27] and while uh others uh others
[1:07:31] all these others in a in a perfect state
[1:07:35] in a perfect body body standing there on
[1:07:37] the other side why and soon very soon
[1:07:41] now because because we're right for it
[1:07:43] we're coming into the Fulfillment of of
[1:07:45] that too we're seeing where we're at and
[1:07:47] we're stepping in in in and we're
[1:07:51] stepping in in in and we're stepping
[1:07:53] into it and one day we're gonna take
[1:07:55] another step and we're going to be gone
[1:07:56] why because because it's becoming
[1:07:59] manifested to us it's becoming such a
[1:08:01] reality to us to to
[1:08:03] to wear to where our everyday life is
[1:08:05] just almost seems fake anymore it's it's
[1:08:08] not real we look at the world it's just
[1:08:10] falling apart at the seams it's busting
[1:08:12] at the seams this is the most it's the
[1:08:15] most insane age I've ever seen in my
[1:08:16] life where there's there's there's
[1:08:18] there's there's satanic and there's
[1:08:20] demons it's almost like like like like
[1:08:24] a little like they've actually become a
[1:08:26] manifested thing on some of the stuff
[1:08:28] that we see day in and day out but see
[1:08:31] but see we can step back and when we can
[1:08:34] look around us and and realize that that
[1:08:36] hold on this is not my home
[1:08:39] I'm just passing through and Justin
[1:08:41] today now we're realizing that that that
[1:08:43] that we're that we're going Beyond we're
[1:08:47] going Beyond this is this this whole
[1:08:49] moral flesh we're going beyond beyond
[1:08:52] both our human mind can comprehend
[1:08:54] worldwide is saying soon and soon
[1:08:56] someday soon God's going to come down
[1:08:57] and Rapture us out of here we're going
[1:09:00] back and into that into that Edom
[1:09:03] condition where where where Adam and Eve
[1:09:06] were there and they had perfect rain
[1:09:07] where we're neither death nor sorrow we
[1:09:09] could go good good good good good good
[1:09:11] good
[1:09:12] um
[1:09:13] um
[1:09:13] it is random if you've gotten a little
[1:09:16] chilly one day day hey hey hey hey hey
[1:09:18] hey hey and Adam won't just speak out
[1:09:20] wind be still
[1:09:22] or or if you would say man I wish I had
[1:09:25] some more Sunshine over here Adam would
[1:09:28] just take a tree and uproot it and move
[1:09:29] it and 30 yards to the left where he
[1:09:31] where he became it became such a perfect
[1:09:34] a perfect place a perfect Lane
[1:09:39] and yet and yet when Adam and Eve fell
[1:09:41] God drove them away from it but now
[1:09:43] since Calvary and since we have come
[1:09:45] into this Perfection of the manifested
[1:09:47] son and daughter of God go go go go go
[1:09:49] go go go go go go go go go go go there's
[1:09:51] no longer driving man from him but he's
[1:09:53] turning around and he's placing his
[1:09:55] bride right in the middle of it again
[1:09:57] why everybody because we're not we're
[1:09:59] not coming forth as a week helpless
[1:10:00] bride
[1:10:02] we won't be like that for Steve Eve that
[1:10:05] first Steve who who who fell in because
[1:10:08] she disbelieved God's word why people
[1:10:10] are stepping forth as the most powerful
[1:10:13] Army to ever come whoever come on the
[1:10:14] face of the planet why we're coming
[1:10:16] we're coming now into our position hey
[1:10:19] we're realizing just who we are and
[1:10:22] we're gonna run without rock that bride
[1:10:23] the the cry that has gone forth that has
[1:10:25] gone forth has gone forth from from the
[1:10:28] bridegroom and says wake up wake up for
[1:10:31] the bride's gonna cometh and worse now
[1:10:33] standing in our positions with our limps
[1:10:34] our lamps trimmed and well now we're
[1:10:37] going forth to meet the bride's groom
[1:10:39] why because when we're saying
[1:10:41] so now we're standing and we're
[1:10:44] realizing just exactly what's going on I
[1:10:46] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're
[1:10:48] standing with our lamps trimmed and just
[1:10:50] any day now we're going to go meet our
[1:10:52] Lord in the air
[1:10:54] why could she step into the vision of
[1:10:56] what God has had for her since the
[1:10:58] foundation of the world is he he he he
[1:11:01] he he he he doesn't see us as as as the
[1:11:04] World As the World As the World sees us
[1:11:06] he the the world might see me and say
[1:11:09] that's just Josiah he's just a
[1:11:11] contractor and then and he and he's just
[1:11:13] a good old boy down the street at least
[1:11:14] I hope most of them think that but but
[1:11:17] yeah but yeah he he he he doesn't he he
[1:11:20] he he he he God doesn't just see me as
[1:11:23] his Carpenter receiver that Kevin has a
[1:11:25] carpenter or or or he doesn't see us as
[1:11:28] that he sees us as Perfection he sees us
[1:11:31] that has The Perfect sinless Bride of
[1:11:33] Jesus Christ he's never seen us as
[1:11:36] Sinners he he he's he he's never seen us
[1:11:39] as a as a drunk or a druggie or as an
[1:11:41] addict or as a or as a cussing swearing
[1:11:45] um um sinner
[1:11:48] who was so Godless that that
[1:11:52] that that that that that that you make a
[1:11:55] savior blush he's never seen us as that
[1:11:58] he's always seen this that's spotless
[1:11:59] The Virtue is brought to Jesus Christ
[1:12:01] but we have to take his mind in order to
[1:12:04] get anywhere anywhere with God why why
[1:12:07] his
[1:12:08] um
[1:12:09] so this is so be noticed that brother
[1:12:12] Branham you notice
[1:12:15] and the Visions that's um that uh that
[1:12:17] uh in the Visions he would have
[1:12:21] and he he he told the story and and I
[1:12:24] never could could could get the
[1:12:26] significance of it and then it kind of
[1:12:27] jumped out out to out out at me the
[1:12:31] other days the other day as as
[1:12:34] I was studying on this and and and and
[1:12:37] you notice he he had a vision one time
[1:12:39] he was he was in his bedroom and he was
[1:12:41] the boy that was that was screaming and
[1:12:43] screaming it was like it was like days
[1:12:44] and um
[1:12:46] he uh seen a vision and I'm paraphrasing
[1:12:48] this because because I don't have it
[1:12:49] written down or nothing so I'm just
[1:12:50] clarifying this and he had this vision
[1:12:52] and and he seemed like a grandma sitting
[1:12:54] there and the mom and dad sitting there
[1:12:56] and he said the dad was leaning up
[1:12:57] against the wall and the mother was
[1:12:58] sitting in the chair cleaning glasses
[1:12:59] and he walked in and he prayed for the
[1:13:02] child and the child got well well well
[1:13:04] well he he told his wife about it and
[1:13:07] they're sitting there eating breakfast I
[1:13:08] think it was and then and then and then
[1:13:10] and then all of a sudden he got this
[1:13:12] knock on the door and it was when he
[1:13:14] opened the door he realized it was the
[1:13:15] dad that he's seen in the vision that
[1:13:16] morning and and the dad said you know
[1:13:19] you know we come our turn baby something
[1:13:21] blue in the face it won't stop crying
[1:13:23] it's not breathing right so brother
[1:13:24] Brown says of course so he jumps in and
[1:13:26] or he he rides with the dad down there
[1:13:28] and he just walks in grabs the baby and
[1:13:32] prays for it and he said it got worse
[1:13:33] and and he realized he didn't wait for
[1:13:37] that Vision to be fulfilled yet he he
[1:13:39] jumped ahead ahead of of of
[1:13:42] the vision and I can't remember how long
[1:13:45] it was he stayed there but I it was all
[1:13:47] night long and and it was it was part of
[1:13:49] into the next morning and he was just
[1:13:51] sat there and he was praying he said God
[1:13:52] forgive me you know I'm I'm an idiot or
[1:13:55] or how how how how however it was that
[1:13:59] it was it was that that that that he
[1:14:02] phrased it and he said I'm sorry I was
[1:14:04] wrong and and and the doubt that I was
[1:14:07] even going hey
[1:14:08] um brother man I've got to go to work
[1:14:10] can you um um you want to go now and he
[1:14:12] kept saying just wait a minute just wait
[1:14:14] a minute and he was sitting there and
[1:14:16] all of a sudden the Grandma comes
[1:14:17] walking in and she steps down in that
[1:14:19] chair and she starts cleaning and
[1:14:20] cleaning her glasses and he said he said
[1:14:23] he said he said I also have to do is
[1:14:24] wait for that Dad to go from the doorway
[1:14:26] to cross onto the other side of the room
[1:14:28] and he said he said then the vision
[1:14:30] everything will be in its place at that
[1:14:31] point and so he sat there and he waited
[1:14:34] and he waited and that finally crossed
[1:14:35] through him and and then he stood up
[1:14:37] because he's seen that the the vision
[1:14:40] had now been have now been fully
[1:14:42] fulfilled now and now and now he can act
[1:14:44] he can act with all confidence and all
[1:14:46] Authority
[1:14:48] and he picked up the baby and prayed for
[1:14:51] and immediately he got well why because
[1:14:53] because
[1:14:56] see brother random in these Visions he
[1:14:58] had to he he had to wait for everything
[1:15:00] to be fulfilled he he has remembered the
[1:15:03] the boy that that got raised from from
[1:15:05] from Finland the other day or not the
[1:15:08] other day but you know then he he he he
[1:15:11] he he had a vision and he said there was
[1:15:14] mountains around he said he said there
[1:15:15] was a road with the valley and he he
[1:15:17] said the boy had on some kind of foreign
[1:15:19] looking clothes and he wrote it all down
[1:15:21] and the fire leaf of his Bible and he
[1:15:23] had brother Bank woods and several
[1:15:24] others to write the right division down
[1:15:26] and and
[1:15:28] they said that that that that that it
[1:15:31] was two or three years that went by and
[1:15:33] brother Brandon had it written down in
[1:15:34] his fire leaf because he didn't know
[1:15:36] when it was going to come to pass but he
[1:15:37] knew that at some point it was going to
[1:15:38] come to pass
[1:15:39] and and so and so and so he told
[1:15:43] everybody about this what's going to
[1:15:44] happen you know he it's going to be such
[1:15:46] going to happen you know you know and
[1:15:48] it's it's going it's going it's going
[1:15:50] it's going to be fulfilled well
[1:15:52] I'm sure the story got he got got got
[1:15:54] circulated and I'm sure at some point at
[1:15:57] some point
[1:15:58] somebody's boy got got got got
[1:16:01] hit got hit hit by a car so they call
[1:16:04] him brother random is this the vision so
[1:16:06] so he might show up there and say no
[1:16:07] this isn't it but but even though he
[1:16:09] would pray for them and they may or may
[1:16:11] not have gotten well I don't know but
[1:16:13] but but see but see he didn't have the
[1:16:15] authority that he had and all of a
[1:16:16] sudden that when he's over there in
[1:16:18] Finland and he goes this place looks
[1:16:20] familiar and he kept looking he kept
[1:16:22] saying I've seen this place before and
[1:16:24] he turns your brother brother Woods I
[1:16:25] think it was he said check the filing
[1:16:27] for your Bible and he started reading
[1:16:29] off to him you can see yep there's the
[1:16:30] mountains he said yeah he said yep he
[1:16:32] said yep he's the valley and he and
[1:16:33] here's the road he said this is the
[1:16:35] Fulfillment of that vision
[1:16:37] and and he walked up to that boy maybe
[1:16:40] didn't know nobody and and maybe they
[1:16:42] weren't even Christians but he could
[1:16:44] walk up there with all authority and all
[1:16:46] power and he could sit there and say and
[1:16:48] say if if this boy is raised up in in
[1:16:50] five minutes time
[1:16:54] I'm gonna I'm gonna hang a sign on my
[1:16:56] back and call myself a false prophet he
[1:16:57] said why but he could stand there and
[1:17:00] all authority and all power
[1:17:02] and that boy and that boy raised her
[1:17:06] life again why him all why because
[1:17:08] because he's seen his place in the
[1:17:10] vision he's seen it was this was the
[1:17:12] Fulfillment of the vision of what was to
[1:17:14] come to pass and the bride now was
[1:17:16] standing is standing in in in in her
[1:17:19] place and she's come up and and she's
[1:17:21] become this perfect this perfect
[1:17:23] Masterpiece that God that God that God
[1:17:25] has as it has has has has has has
[1:17:31] created and the Capstone has come down
[1:17:33] the heads hit their heads in its place
[1:17:35] why she why why and the bride's looking
[1:17:38] around and saying hey the Fulfillment of
[1:17:40] the vision is here we are now we are now
[1:17:42] living in the Fulfillment of what of
[1:17:44] what since before the foundation of the
[1:17:46] world that these prophets have
[1:17:47] prophesied about and men have preached
[1:17:50] about and brothers have labored over
[1:17:51] this is something that brother Brown
[1:17:53] prophesied in and spoke about and
[1:17:55] preached about and now we as the body
[1:17:58] Jesus Christ today in 2022 can stand
[1:18:01] around and see hey this is the
[1:18:02] Fulfillment of the vision and we can
[1:18:04] step into our place and you want and you
[1:18:06] watch what starts to happen why was the
[1:18:09] the the the the the who we can stand we
[1:18:13] can stand a full Authority and full
[1:18:15] power and say Satan get thee behind me
[1:18:18] and no matter what would happen if
[1:18:20] someone is going to sick or or or or or
[1:18:22] or or or or or or or or or or or if
[1:18:25] they're they're dealing they're dealing
[1:18:27] with these struggles they had day in and
[1:18:28] day out maybe for years or maybe it's a
[1:18:30] generational curse but now we as a bride
[1:18:33] of Jesus Christ can step forth into the
[1:18:35] vision and we can stand there with all
[1:18:37] authority and all power
[1:18:39] and we can claim whatever the need
[1:18:44] maybe why because we because we've
[1:18:47] caught ourselves in the vision we've
[1:18:48] seen our our place and our our spot in
[1:18:52] Scripture you uh notice in prayer lines
[1:18:54] that um brother Brown would have he he
[1:18:57] he would have the individual come up or
[1:19:00] I think it was on his right or something
[1:19:01] I think it was and uh and and because he
[1:19:04] said the angel was always on his left I
[1:19:05] don't remember exactly now but he he he
[1:19:07] he but but he would start reading them
[1:19:09] off like a book just pow pow pow pow and
[1:19:11] then and then but then all of a sudden
[1:19:13] all sudden he would stop and he would
[1:19:16] say he would say a lady out there in the
[1:19:18] crowd and he would say he would say he
[1:19:20] he would say you've got you've got
[1:19:22] cancer and it's in the breast and he
[1:19:24] started reading off well that lady may
[1:19:26] not realize he's talking to her because
[1:19:27] there might be 30 000 people there
[1:19:30] but then all of a sudden he would go he
[1:19:31] would go Mrs Smith you're right you're
[1:19:33] in Lima Ohio and you're in and your
[1:19:35] address is five six seven eight whatever
[1:19:37] street and then she would realize hey
[1:19:39] he's talking about me so he she would
[1:19:42] catch herself in the vision that that
[1:19:43] that that that that brother Brenda was
[1:19:45] having and it would cause her to have
[1:19:47] the faith that it would cause her to
[1:19:48] have the faith of what was to happen and
[1:19:51] and and and and then a couple times I've
[1:19:53] I've heard the prayer lines they would
[1:19:55] sit there and say he would sit there and
[1:19:57] say Mrs Smith Smith he you you're healed
[1:20:00] a dancer now if you'll rise up and claim
[1:20:01] it and and he would say he would say
[1:20:03] don't hesitate you're going to miss it
[1:20:05] and then she would still says Hector he
[1:20:07] was in Mrs Smith your address is such
[1:20:08] and such and she still wouldn't catch it
[1:20:10] and he would say he and he would say
[1:20:12] because you because because you have
[1:20:14] have have have have uh have
[1:20:17] hesitated now and you didn't catch it it
[1:20:19] is now it is now on the neighbor next
[1:20:21] next next next next next next next next
[1:20:23] next to you and she would rise up and
[1:20:26] claim the same healing that that lady
[1:20:28] could have gotten why why because
[1:20:30] because she couldn't she didn't realize
[1:20:32] that that that Vision brother Ryan was
[1:20:33] having was about her and so we
[1:20:38] when they would sit there and realize
[1:20:40] that hey the prophet of God who has been
[1:20:42] Vindicated hundreds and thousands of
[1:20:45] times is talking about me say hey I am
[1:20:47] now I am now I am now I am now in the
[1:20:50] vision of Jesus of what that prophet's
[1:20:52] having so they could stand there and
[1:20:54] they could claim say no that healing is
[1:20:56] mine now because they saw themselves in
[1:20:58] the vision and and if we could catch the
[1:21:00] vision division tonight that that
[1:21:02] healing is the children's bread that
[1:21:04] that that Christ said whatsoever you
[1:21:06] have that whatsoever that you have have
[1:21:08] have need of that that
[1:21:11] whatsoever you have needed I will give
[1:21:13] it to you if we ask the broader Jesus
[1:21:15] Christ could realize that Deliverance is
[1:21:16] ours that the the overcoming power is
[1:21:20] ours and all authority over anything the
[1:21:22] devil could throw away as ours why be
[1:21:24] it's not that and yes the prophet taught
[1:21:26] us but it but but but but again he's not
[1:21:28] here in person to sit there and say
[1:21:29] sister so-and-so your deliverance is
[1:21:32] here but we as of Jesus right of Jesus
[1:21:34] Christ can realize this is the
[1:21:35] children's bread and what's the same
[1:21:38] attributes that Christ died for on
[1:21:39] Calvary is the same attributes that says
[1:21:42] I am healed this when he died when he
[1:21:44] died when he when he went win win he
[1:21:47] died on Calvary it was for our sins but
[1:21:49] but yet at that same day he he was he
[1:21:51] was beaten he was beaten for for our our
[1:21:54] sins are not our sins but our healing
[1:21:56] and our and our transgressions it's the
[1:21:58] same attribute that says as it says that
[1:22:01] says that that says I'm saved it's the
[1:22:04] same attribute that says I can have the
[1:22:05] Holy Ghost it's our bread why would god
[1:22:09] sister and give and give and give one
[1:22:11] one one child a piece a cone of ice
[1:22:14] cream and another child that says some
[1:22:15] asparagus that that's that
[1:22:19] that would not be right of a dad to do
[1:22:21] that but but us as surprised as children
[1:22:25] of God we can stand there and say hold
[1:22:27] on hold on a second here someone saw God
[1:22:29] his ice cream where's my ice cream and
[1:22:30] all you have to do is hold your hand out
[1:22:32] and it's yours it's the children's bed
[1:22:34] Hawaii it's everything that that we ever
[1:22:36] have need of is now ours but what we
[1:22:39] have to do is we have to see ourselves
[1:22:41] we have to see ourselves in that word
[1:22:43] and realize hey hold on I'm not just any
[1:22:46] any Joe flow down the street I am the
[1:22:49] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:53] no no I want to be healed but you
[1:22:56] already were healed God can no more do
[1:22:58] anything for you you just have to open
[1:23:00] up and it holds your hand out and say
[1:23:03] God where's my ice cream where's my
[1:23:05] healing at oh
[1:23:07] it's it's mine can I have it now why
[1:23:10] because it's ours it's it's it's the
[1:23:13] children's bread why the prison bars
[1:23:16] have been opened up and we as a body of
[1:23:18] Jesus Christ who have the mind of God
[1:23:20] now are realizing the prison bars are
[1:23:23] open we just have to step out of those
[1:23:25] uh how we have to step out of those bars
[1:23:27] and and step into the Open Arms of Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ in Christ
[1:23:33] when he had that vision of all those
[1:23:36] people that I was in those bars
[1:23:39] he said he said I can't I can't heal
[1:23:41] them I can't help them
[1:23:43] but he said House of Hell give way in
[1:23:46] the name of Jesus Christ he said all the
[1:23:47] creaking and the popping in the in the
[1:23:50] and the thing falling apart the hinges
[1:23:52] why be it why because because he's way
[1:23:54] the the the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[1:23:56] been set free from from every kind of
[1:23:59] power that that might be holding us down
[1:24:01] Deliverance is ours salvation is ours
[1:24:03] healing is ours the prison bars are open
[1:24:05] to Hawaii because to speak onto the
[1:24:08] mountain whatsoever that you have
[1:24:11] whatsoever that you have have have need
[1:24:14] of it is yours it is it is yours to take
[1:24:16] and why that same spirit that was in
[1:24:18] Jesus is now on us that that makes us an
[1:24:21] heir and a joint Heir with Christ that
[1:24:24] means that means that means if if I
[1:24:27] think I know I've explained this before
[1:24:28] but I like to explain it because it it
[1:24:30] makes it easy it makes it simple for
[1:24:31] dummies like like like me let's say
[1:24:34] brother Amos and I was Brothers In the
[1:24:36] Flesh and our daddy was a big Rancher
[1:24:38] and and he dies well now in his will and
[1:24:42] testament we're both heirs now now he
[1:24:45] gets the the ranch and the Fancy's truck
[1:24:47] and and and and and everything else but
[1:24:50] he gives me a goat so brother Amos is
[1:24:53] driving his brand spanking new fancy
[1:24:54] trucks to church and I'm riding my goat
[1:24:56] you know man you know but but but but
[1:24:59] but see see even though I'm still in
[1:25:01] there but see a joint Heir means if our
[1:25:04] daddy that died it died it says you are
[1:25:06] a joint Heir ahead with me a brother if
[1:25:09] brother Amos owns that ranch I own that
[1:25:11] ranch he owns that truck I own that
[1:25:13] truck he he he owns that thought that
[1:25:16] that he owns that that those those he
[1:25:18] owns us a thousand dollars that thousand
[1:25:20] head catalog a thousand-headed cattle
[1:25:22] out there on the Hills I own those
[1:25:24] thousand head of cattle out there on
[1:25:26] them Hills why were joint heirs were
[1:25:28] Heirs of the same blessings the same
[1:25:31] promise that Christ that Christ had we
[1:25:33] as the body to Jesus Christ have white
[1:25:35] because we're heirs and we're doing
[1:25:36] heirs with Christ so this is so so so so
[1:25:39] so so
[1:25:40] if Christ could stand forth and all
[1:25:42] authority and all power and say and say
[1:25:44] you are healed or or or or or or or or
[1:25:47] or or or or or thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:25:49] we as the Bride of Jesus Christ can
[1:25:51] stand there and say the same thing why
[1:25:53] because we have the same Authority and
[1:25:55] the same power that Christ had had on
[1:25:57] Calvary as Christ as Christ well it was
[1:26:00] the Masterpiece in his day we have come
[1:26:02] forth as a masterpiece as the
[1:26:03] Masterpiece in our day where we can
[1:26:05] stand here and and and and claim every
[1:26:08] god-given promise and right that we are
[1:26:10] that that we have so so so so so so so
[1:26:13] so so so so we need to let a vision
[1:26:16] breakouts break out over our lives and
[1:26:18] and we need to sear ourselves not as the
[1:26:21] world sees us but as Christ as Christ
[1:26:22] but as Christ as Christ sees us as son
[1:26:26] and daughter of God that has stepped out
[1:26:27] of those out of those out of those
[1:26:29] prison bars with full of poor Authority
[1:26:32] and power and we can look that devil in
[1:26:35] the eye and say hey and say get the
[1:26:36] hints you are now powerless
[1:26:42] is is is is
[1:26:45] quit is is quit soft soft footing around
[1:26:48] the devil and does and his hope and and
[1:26:50] hope and hope that that that that that
[1:26:52] that that that that that that that that
[1:26:54] that he that he that he ignores you and
[1:26:58] his hand just hopes that well I hope I
[1:26:59] don't be tried today or or I hope my
[1:27:01] arthritis ain't gonna ain't gonna ain't
[1:27:03] gonna ain't gonna kick up uh today or
[1:27:06] I'm sure hope this isn't gonna happen
[1:27:07] today what we need to do is stand in
[1:27:09] full Authority and a full power and see
[1:27:12] yourself as God sees us and we need to
[1:27:14] step into the vision of what God has
[1:27:15] called us to be
[1:27:17] and we need to look at that devil in the
[1:27:20] eye and say get the hint Satan
[1:27:23] hope I'm not repeating myself to to to
[1:27:25] to to to to do much here this is this
[1:27:29] message did not come did did not come to
[1:27:32] to just to just to just two justices to
[1:27:35] just sit on a shelf and and get Dusty or
[1:27:38] just stay on the tapes and say just play
[1:27:40] the tapes only it's come to live and
[1:27:43] dwell in The Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:27:45] so so brother Brandon brother Brown was
[1:27:47] just a forerunner of what was to come he
[1:27:50] he he he he he he was a he he he was a
[1:27:53] sheath wave offering showing of what's
[1:27:55] to come in the in the near in the near
[1:27:57] in the near future why is this
[1:28:00] um um um so so that message is just to
[1:28:02] stay in them tapes is to come and live
[1:28:04] in the bride and Jesus the bride
[1:28:06] you you take an architect he how he
[1:28:09] how he um how he he Visions a home and
[1:28:12] and and and and and and and he'll he'll
[1:28:15] sit there and and build this home and
[1:28:17] and and and and are not built at home
[1:28:20] but he what he sees in his mind he'll
[1:28:22] start drawing it out on paper on a set
[1:28:24] of blueprints and what he sees in his
[1:28:27] mind he he he relays it to the
[1:28:29] contractor and then the contractor in
[1:28:31] turn builds the home and and and so what
[1:28:35] without with that architect already
[1:28:37] Visions in his mind in the back or in
[1:28:40] the back of his mind or whatever he
[1:28:41] might see this home in a in a perfected
[1:28:44] State and the contractor might be a
[1:28:46] little extra his head going why in the
[1:28:47] world do you want to do that here but
[1:28:49] see but see he if if if if if you build
[1:28:52] according to the blueprints of what the
[1:28:54] architect has drawn what because what
[1:28:57] becomes not in the architect's mind has
[1:28:59] then becomes um becomes manifested and
[1:29:02] manifested in person as a beautiful home
[1:29:04] that someone that someone that somebody
[1:29:05] will enjoy for years
[1:29:07] and so so it's so so so and so so it's
[1:29:12] kind of funny because I used to work for
[1:29:13] a company and the foreman my uh my uh my
[1:29:17] uh Foreman
[1:29:18] um he he he he had the architect's phone
[1:29:21] number and it was it was a multi-million
[1:29:22] dollar company and and there was there
[1:29:24] was two or three superintendents and you
[1:29:26] had the contractors and he had you know
[1:29:27] but he he he he he he he somehow
[1:29:31] wrangled his way around and he got the
[1:29:33] architect's phone number and and so what
[1:29:35] she wasn't really wasn't technically
[1:29:36] supposed to have it because the
[1:29:37] architect's a busy man but he he sat
[1:29:39] there and say hey I'm not seeing what
[1:29:41] you're trying what you're trying to to
[1:29:43] to to to to accomplish her he said I
[1:29:45] can't grasp grasp why you want to do
[1:29:48] something here and and then the
[1:29:49] architect would sit there and lay it out
[1:29:52] and explain everything to him and show
[1:29:54] him hey this is why we're doing this and
[1:29:56] I'm wanting to do this here for that and
[1:29:58] then when that foreman could get in the
[1:29:59] architect's mind and figure out what
[1:30:01] exactly what exactly that architect was
[1:30:03] was was trying was was trying to
[1:30:06] accomplish the foreman could could then
[1:30:08] relay it to the rest of us guys we'd
[1:30:10] build what what the architect had in
[1:30:12] mind since this is since since since
[1:30:13] since since
[1:30:15] however long the architecture the
[1:30:17] architect has dreamed of this home and
[1:30:20] so we as the body of Jesus Christ
[1:30:26] when if we could ever get into the mind
[1:30:29] of Christ and realize just exactly what
[1:30:31] what God has in mind for us us has the
[1:30:35] body of Christ we can stand there and
[1:30:37] with all confidence and an all authority
[1:30:40] go and go no this is what the architect
[1:30:42] wants so we're building it this way and
[1:30:44] so when when someone Satan May
[1:30:46] when Satan when Satan may come in like a
[1:30:50] flood flood we ask the bride that Christ
[1:30:52] can stand there in all authority in all
[1:30:54] power and raise up that standard of the
[1:30:56] message and say no sir this is what the
[1:30:58] architect wants and we can go forward
[1:31:00] with it with it with all confidence and
[1:31:02] all boldness knowing that that that what
[1:31:05] that architect wanted he's going to back
[1:31:07] us up with them
[1:31:08] brother Byron said he said that they
[1:31:11] said that that same power that same
[1:31:12] Christ Hallelujah he said let the
[1:31:14] fundamentalists and let the people who
[1:31:16] deny the power of God say it's wrong but
[1:31:18] that same people that spoke the world
[1:31:19] that same sorry power that spoke the
[1:31:22] world into existence is in those people
[1:31:24] that's got the Holy Ghost he said that's
[1:31:26] right man and woman it's time that we
[1:31:28] found out who you are the devil's trying
[1:31:30] to hide you back until you tell you that
[1:31:32] you're some little taught down down
[1:31:34] something you're not your sons and
[1:31:36] daughters of God the deity is not in
[1:31:38] heaven it's in you he says hallelujah I
[1:31:41] know you think I'm crazy but let me tell
[1:31:43] you something brother when you realize
[1:31:44] that almighty God lives in you immortal
[1:31:46] life my life I give you Zoe the life of
[1:31:49] God is in is in the human being
[1:31:54] and then he says he he says he stood
[1:31:57] back there he's the creator of all
[1:31:59] things he made life and frogs and all
[1:32:01] these ducks chickens animals created
[1:32:02] everything and nothing was made by him
[1:32:04] but what was made by him who he said
[1:32:06] Christ the deity he brought down he he
[1:32:09] brought down he brought down the plagues
[1:32:11] and everything in the days of Egypt who
[1:32:13] Christ he stopped the mouse Lions he
[1:32:15] quits the violence of fire they escaped
[1:32:17] the edge of the sword they had raised
[1:32:18] they raised the desert they'd raised the
[1:32:20] Dead from the grave who Christ he's all
[1:32:22] mine he he said he said what would it be
[1:32:24] who is it Christ the deity he's saying
[1:32:27] brother sister
[1:32:28] I deities in you a little while in the
[1:32:30] world in the world and the world and the
[1:32:32] world seeth me no more yet ye shall see
[1:32:34] me for I will be with you even in you to
[1:32:36] the end of the age Christ in the manger
[1:32:37] no sir Christ in you hallelujah we're
[1:32:40] not worshiping Christ to the manger he's
[1:32:42] about World War should be in Christ in
[1:32:43] you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life
[1:32:45] Hallelujah the Creator God himself
[1:32:48] dwelling in the human being it does not
[1:32:50] yet appear what we shall be but but we
[1:32:52] shall see him as he is for will be made
[1:32:54] like him so so we we are that we are we
[1:32:59] are missing Jesus Christ standing forth
[1:33:01] with the full power and full Authority
