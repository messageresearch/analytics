[Music] And I know how it feels to be alone. [Music] And I've gone many days without a song. When all hope seemed gone and I could not carry on, I whispered, "Jesus, and you'll always see me through. He'll see me through my darkest days and lonely nights. He'll see me through. For he is the way, the truth, and life. And when I'm faced with storms of life and I don't know what to do, [Music] I whisper Jesus and you'll always see me through. [Music] And he made a way where there was no way.

[Music] Going all the way. [Music] Going all the way. I'm going all the way. with the Lord. Amen. Are you going all the way? Amen. There's an old song uh if we can maybe pull it up. Just a little while. Do you know that song? Just a little while to labor. Just a little while to just a little while to labor. Just a little while to rest. Just a little while. [Music] We're straight. Oh, just a little more of trouble in this low and simple stay. In the inner heavens for most early days, soon this life will all be over and all pilgrimage will end. Soon we'll take our heavenly journey. Be at home again with friends. Oh, heaven's gates were standing open, waiting for our entrance there. Some sweet day are going over. All the beauties there. Well, aren't you glad for that? Yes. Just a little while to labor. Just a little while to make. [Music] Just a little while to labor in the path that's always straight. Just a little more of trouble [Music] in this and sinful state. Then we'll enter heaven's portals sweeping through the pearly gates. Now soon'll see the light of morning. Then the new day will begin. Soon we'll hear the father calling. [Music] Come my children, enter in. Then we'll hear a choir of angels singing out the victory song. All our troubles will be ended and we'll live with heaven. Well, won't there be a time? Well, a little while to stay here. Just a little while to wait. Just a little while to labor in the path that's always straight. Just a little while of trouble in this low and sinful stain. Then we'll enter heaven's portals sweeping through. [Music] Amen. Now soon we'll meet again our loved ones. Then we'll take them by the hand. Soon we'll press them to our bosom over in the promised land. Then we'll be at home forever throughout all eternity. Yes. What a blessed blessed morning. That eternal morning. We'll sing it again. Oh, just a little while to stay here. Just a little while away. Just a little while too late in the path that's always straight. Just a little more of trouble in this low and sinful state. Then we'll enter heaven's portals sweeping through the pearly gates. Last lines. All them will enter heaven's mortals sweeping through the pearly. Yay. Well, can you give him a hand clap of praise? Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you looking forward to that time? &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust you are. Amen. Uh it it ain't going to be too much longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The musicians can be dismissed. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to Philippians 3:8. If you can turn these monitors up, that'd be great. And then it's good to have uh brother Josiah and sister Mindy, amen, with us. Amen. And the children. Praise the Lord. And um trust they had a wonderful time. Amen. Um in in their services and they went on to Ohio and spent time with his family. And so um glad they made it back. Praise the Lord. Uh before we go into the word, may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord. Father, we are sure longing for home and we realize by the signs of time that it ain't going to be too much longer. And Lord, we want to do all that we can on this side, Father. And we want to labor. We want to give everything that we've got, Father, to your kingdom. And Lord, as we are gathered here tonight, I just pray that you would come and just strengthen your people. Father, you know, every need that is present, whether it be sickness, discouragement, or if it's just needing to come up higher, needing more understanding of your word, whatever it would be, you hold the key to it all. And Father, as we humble our hearts, Lord, to you tonight and just welcome you and ask that you would just go walk the aisles, walk every pew, and Father, touch every heart, anoint both speaker and hearer. And I pray that you would just anoint these lips of clay. And Father, that you would just speak what words you would have to say. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen. So, we want to turn to Philippians 3:8 and we'll start there. Actually, we'll go uh the seventh verse. But what things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yay, doubtless I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings. ings being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I'd already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after. I want you to notice that I I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, and this is where I want to go to uh talk about is forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before. &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats this evening. And if I were to title it, it would be pressing towards the high calling of God. And um you know, the the Christian life is the best life there is u outside of any life. You you could you could choose uh a rich life or um um a life of whatever, but uh the Christian life is the best to live. But but it's not an easy life to live. It's the best life to live, but it's not an easy life. &gt;&gt; And the prophet tells us, he says, "Now I'm I'm telling you, when as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost, Satan's got every gun right on you shooting you." &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "Every man and woman, as soon as you're baptized with the Holy Ghost, immediately the devil sets in from every side. And if he didn't, then you better go back. So, so and and there's a lot more things that Brother Brandham talks about of how that uh uh really we're we're in a warfare. And so, this is why we are told in the scriptures to put on the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; And and you must put on we are to take the shield of faith. We are to take the sword of the spirit. We are to put on the the breastplate of righteousness. And brother Bram said, then you pull up the kinch on it and tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready for it cuz it's a coming. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. You're going to have plenty of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't worry about that. You're going to have it, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But then he goes on to say, "But we're not to worry uh about it because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So then we're not a stranger to afflictions. We're not a stranger to things that uh that come our way. It's just it's if if you've chose to be a Christian for the good things, uh there there are promises and there are these things, but don't think you to yourself to be deceived. uh uh in thinking that there's not any trouble because there is trouble. Now I want to deal with the two things uh statements that Paul makes uh in our opening scripture. First of all, forgetting those things that are behind and then pressing towards the high calling of God. Forgetting those things that are behind and pressing towards the high calling of God. So if you have served God at any length of time, you know that what he is saying is not easy. It's not easy to forget those things that are behind and it's not easy to reach forward those things that are before. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And yet Paul is saying this is what I'm doing. And it wasn't just a statement for himself, but he was showing that every believer uh uh uh must come to this forgetting those things that are behind and pressing towards the high calling of God. &gt;&gt; And so the reason is is as long the prophet said, as long as you're in this life, this is why it's not easy. He said, "As long as you're in this life, you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live. &gt;&gt; But the inside of you, you're born again." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, just because we're we're filled with the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that it takes away the troubles. It and and and the issues. And our troubles come not from the soul, but our troubles come by our flesh. This old sticky nature. Ain't that right, the Holy Ghost? Um, our soul has already been sealed. If you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your soul is sealed. And until the day of your redemption, Amen. But your sticky nature, that that carnal nature is what's going to bother you as long as you live. Amen. And so, Brother Brandham made that statement as he was trying to explain or as he was explaining uh what Paul said in in uh uh uh the seventh chapter of Romans. and and uh I'm not going to read it uh to save time, but you ought to go back and read it and and compare with what brother Brandham said about it. And and Paul wasn't talking about sinners uh uh uh as some would have you to believe, but Paul was actually talking about Holy Ghost fililled people that struggle that that have things that they deal with. And so, uh, again, even though we have the Holy Ghost, we're going to struggle with our fleshly nature. &gt;&gt; But, but the prophet said we are to bring our our, uh, body under subjection to the word of God by faith in the word of God. So, so it's it's it's not that we just allow these struggles to overcome us, but but we are by the authority of God. Amen. Able to take uh and bring this flesh and and subdue it. Amen. Overcome. Can you say amen? See, bring our feelings under subjection. Bring our emotions under subjection. bring our uh symptoms and the the fleshly desires under subjection to the word of God by faith in the word of God. In other words, if if if we cannot believe the word of God, if we have not faith in the word of God, if we're questioning the word of God, there's absolutely no way that we can bring these things uh under subjection to the word of God because the prophet said we bring this our body under subjection to the word by faith in the word. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so, uh all of these things are to be brought under subjection to the word of God. Now here Paul would say leaving the past behind. And and so uh the way to leave the past, how many wants to leave the past behind? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the duty of a Christian, that's what a believer is, is to leave the past behind. Amen. And and to do that, Amen. is to forget the past. Ain't that right? To leave the past is to forget the past. Amen. And and the word forget, it means to lose the remembrance of, be unable to think of or recall, to disregard intentionally, to overlook, to cease remembering or noticing. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, this is what Paul was was saying to the church. I'm going to forget the past. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave those the past behind. And I'm I'm going to forget it. I'm I'm I'm going to intentionally disregard everything that was. Now, as as the year of 1961 was approaching, brother Brandham said, there's just one thing that I would like to say, and that is like the Apostle Paul said, forgetting those things that are in the past, all my mistakes and all the things that I have done, I press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ. That's the only regrets that I have is my heirs for the past and and the past part of my life. And I can only humbly ask him for grace to press on towards the mark of the high calling. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, so these are things that he tells us that we need to forget. Amen. A year later, as 1963 was approaching, he said, "Forgetting those things that are in the past, all of our mistakes of last year, I press towards the mark of the high calling. All my mistakes that I've made in all these years, forgive me for them. God, forgive me. Church, forgive me the the ministry I failed with. I I feel God, forgive me for it. See, church, forgive me of my mistakes. I and I'll press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. As 1964 was approaching, Brother Brandham said, "Today, as we face new years, I want to think not uh of not like the past, but I want to look to the future." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So when when we're we're forgetting the things behind you, you you you can't keep dwelling on the past. You've got to look to the future. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? How many believes there's a future? &gt;&gt; Amen. Believers. Amen. We We ain't just got a past. We've got a future. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and dwelling on the past and looking to the future. You can't do that. You've got to leave the past behind. Forget the past and look to the future. A ain't that right? So he says, "Now I want to look think of not not like the past, but I want to look to the future." We are looking what we have past when we're looking in the rearview mirror. See, so we're not Christians that look in the rearview mirror. Amen. Looking at the past, he said, "See, we're we're not trying to place the message today as looking through a rearview mirror. Don't Don't take the message while you're looking through a rear view mirror. Can you say amen? This message isn't just speaking of our past. It's it's actually wiping our past clean. It's it's it's telling us of our future. And and the message doesn't help us as long as we're constantly looking in the rearview mirror at our past. So he says when we're, you know, uh we're not trying to place the message today as looking through a rearview mirror. It would take too long. The things that the Lord has did and you are all acquainted with the great things that the Lord has been doing is some of the mightiest things that I've ever seen in my life. He's just passing in the last few months. But now we are thankful for what we what has been. But now we're looking forward. We're looking forward where we're headed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We we're we're going somewhere. How many believes that? we're we're going somewhere. &gt;&gt; See, and so the the prophet would tell us that that uh uh to never look back to what was or what has happened in the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't look in the rearview mirror cuz when you do that, you're looking at what was and and we're to never do that. Never look back to the old life. &gt;&gt; Never look back to old ways. Never look back to past experiences. Can you say amen? The prophet said, "Leaving the world behind, leaving theology behind. I see Christ in him only." Well, where is Christ? Not behind you. Christ is before you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See? And so therefore, forgetting for everybody say, "Forgetting means not letting things bother you." &gt;&gt; Forgetting means not letting things bother you. Billy Brand said, "They may say, "Hey, you know, Billy Brandham's a holy roller. I don't even hear it. I just keep on tramping on." That's right. I'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling yonder. say, "You know, I believe that guy's a medium." Well, that don't bother me a bit. See, I just keep moving on. He's telling us how we move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's things that people say in the back, in the past. There's there's past hurts. There's past experiences. There's there's past things. And and and but if you're moving on, you cannot let that bother you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You can't let the situations around you bother you. You're pressing on. &gt;&gt; Pressing on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so leave the past behind until men's words don't bother you. Leave the past behind and press on until men's actions don't bother you. Situations arise in the church or at home or on the job. It doesn't affect you when you're looking forward and you're pressing towards the mark of the high calling. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now I will tell you, we will always carry the past with us if we cannot forget. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Things that were done 10 years ago, we have to forget it. &gt;&gt; Things that were done uh uh three years ago, we've got to forget it. &gt;&gt; Things that were done 10 minutes ago, we've got to forget it. Amen. What was is history. We're still looking. Amen. and pressing on to those things that are before. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I'm going to tell you something. There will never be a time here on this earth that you arrive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. As long as you're breathing in this natural body and as long as you feeling the aches and pains and you're in this mortal life, you've always got something to get beyond to press forward to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. If someone done you wrong or said something hateful to you or acted difference towards you or indifferent, leave it behind. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to leave it behind. And and and and this is why it's not easy. Amen. To leave the past behind and press toward the things that are before &gt;&gt; because we got this old flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So the prophet says, "Forgetting our differences, forgetting our weaknesses, we press on." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So leaving the past behind means burning every bridge. Amen. That you you have uh crossed over. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not be able to burn the bridges before you. Amen. As a lot of people try to do, they're in so deep thought that they're already thinking about the future and trying to burn the bridges. Amen. Before they get there. Amen. You can't do that. Amen. But look, the things that you've gone through, burn them bridges behind. You've got to make up your mind. I'm going to serve God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said, "Daniel had burned all the bridges behind. He wasn't planning going back anymore. He wasn't watching his back trail. He was looking, forsaking those things which were in the past. He pressed on to the mark of the prize of the high calling. And that's what we should be doing. That's what the church should be doing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says you must always look where you're going, not where you've been. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look where you where you been. Look where you're going. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, the word of God isn't isn't to guide you, Amen, into your past. It's to guide you into your future. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, he says, if now I want you to listen now, cuz this is a warning to everyone of us, if you watch the rearview mirror, you will soon wreck up. That's &gt;&gt; what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll lose your anointing. You'll lose your zeal. &gt;&gt; You You'll lose your passion. You'll lose everything and you'll be a trash heap on a church bench even if you it may even take you out the doors &gt;&gt; out into the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. A wreck. Can you say amen? Now we find, amen, that the prophet speaking of the Lutheran and and the church ages and the the revivals, he said the the Lutheran wrecked up when Wesley's light came on. Amen. And they refused to move on. &gt;&gt; Wesley wrecked up and and and and we can we can actually see this the results of this wreck. They are a disaster. Their churches are a disaster. &gt;&gt; That's right. that no anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, no uh freedom, no vision for the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They ain't going anywhere but backwards. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They've degraded from what their their their uh uh founding fathers were. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the Lutheran wrecked up when Wesley's light came on. The Wesleyans wrecked up when the Pentecostal light came on. And the Pentecostals came wrecked up when the evening light came on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, they should have looked, the prophet said, in the future instead of looking in the past. &gt;&gt; God was doing something before them and they should have followed into that, but they looked into the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So a man will wreck up. Not only a church, but a man, a home, a marriage will wreck up if you keep looking in the past. &gt;&gt; So therefore, you cannot press on until you forget the past. Amen. Paul didn't just just tell us, you know, I'm pressing on, but he said, I'm leaving those things behind. &gt;&gt; I'm forgetting those things and I'm pressing on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet says, you know, in in a prayer, he says, "May the Holy Ghost just reign in our hearts supremely that we will walk forgetting the things that are in the past, &gt;&gt; the mock admire that we once lived in." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, so this tells us then that if we are to walk, Amen. forgetting where we were and the muck and the mire that we once lived in. Then in order for the sinner to forget the past, he's got to be changed, he's got to actually come out of the past. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and brother Brandon would tell us, he said, you say, "Well, I confess mine every night." Well, we got a prayer book and we when we go to church, we confess all of our sins and then turn back around and do them again. See, turn right back the next day. God, forgive me for drinking. Forgive me for committing adultery. Forgive me for lying. Forgive me for stealing. Turn right back and do the same thing. Forgive me for getting drunk last night or last week. I didn't mean to to drink that much. And then turn back around and drink it again. That shows something hasn't changed inside. You're trying to paint the outside, kind of uh whitewash it, but what it needs to be done is put in the blood of Jesus Christ and washed white instead of whitewashed. &gt;&gt; See, so it isn't the past until we come out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's why uh Paul would tell us in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation or a new creature creation. Old things are passed away and behold, all things," everybody say, "All things." All things are become new. Now, we may not have reached everything that's new, but we're pressing for it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; We're press. So, as the prophet said, we don't look back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We look forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yesterday was yesterday. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the Christian, the new year that comes, it brings new hope. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Each new day, think of that. Each new day, &gt;&gt; yes, it's true. We might live today out, but there's a tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And that tomorrow brings new hope. &gt;&gt; We started at 7:00 tonight and it's whatever time &gt;&gt; and yet all of that has been passed. &gt;&gt; Every hour, that's right, &gt;&gt; is bringing new hope. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every minute &gt;&gt; is bringing new hope to a Christian. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Every rising of the sun, there's a new hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Amen. See, because we we know that it's bringing us closer. It's taking us closer. Amen. To what we are pressing forward. &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God to press on. It takes the grace of God to be able to forget the past. Now to forget those things, it has to come by forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Forgetting those things left behind comes by forgiveness. What is forgiveness? It's a release from guilt or penalty of an offense. Forgiveness, the prophet would tell us, is a pardon. Can you say amen? When God gave forgave you, he pardoned you. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Which released you from your past. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you've been released from your past? &gt;&gt; Paul is telling us because we've been pardoned, we can forget about the past. &gt;&gt; If we hadn't been pardoned, we couldn't walk away from the past. &gt;&gt; Cain couldn't walk from the away from the past. Condemnation held over him as long as he lived. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; for sure. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But see, God released us. Now there's no more guilt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many's glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So for us to keep walking in the past would be an insult to to God's pardoning grace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:14, for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. For after that he had said before, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God created a sea of forgetfulness, which was his own blood. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And he done that for his purpose. an infinite God &gt;&gt; that knows all things. &gt;&gt; But yet once your sins and iniquities are put in that blood that bleachs that seeth forgetfulness, he cannot remember them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you can walk away from your past. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, we we were He redeemed us, &gt;&gt; justified us. &gt;&gt; Then Paul is is setting that example to us and setting it to us. Now walk away from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just your past when you gave your heart to the Lord, when you was out there drinking and sleitting around and whatever you was doing, but what about yesterday? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about this morning? What about at noon? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We're walking. We're continuing walking. &gt;&gt; God used Israel to show us that his mercy allows us to walk away from our past. In Jeremiah 42:12, God says, "And I will show mercies unto you that you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land." &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you were there at one time and and you were sold into slavery. And now he says, "But I'm going to show mercy unto you, not for you to stay there, but to walk away &gt;&gt; and go back to what belongs to you." &gt;&gt; As the prophet said in uh Lamentation 3:22, "It is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning. Great is thy faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So I believe it was said one time, the grace of God means that I get what I don't deserve. &gt;&gt; Right? The grace of God means that I get what I don't deserve. I don't deserve his love and his faithfulness. &gt;&gt; I don't forget deserve his forgiveness, but I get it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? I don't deserve to rule and to reign with him in the millennium, but I'm going to. &gt;&gt; I I I don't deserve to live in the new city, a new Jerusalem, but I'm going to. &gt;&gt; I don't deserve eternal life, but I have it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's because the grace of God has given me these things. &gt;&gt; The mercy of God means that I do not get what I deserve. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I deserve hell, but I'm not going there. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I I deserve to be wretched and miserable, but I'm not. &gt;&gt; I I deserve tribulation, but I'm not going there. &gt;&gt; I I deserve death and destruction and eternal annihilation, but I'm not going to happen that way. That's not my story. &gt;&gt; It's the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's all because of the blood. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "We have redemption through the blood of Christ and forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace." I say that again. We have redemption through the blood of Christ and forgiveness of sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to the riches of his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll you'll never exhaust the grace of God. You'll never bankrupt God with his grace. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then God pardons us by forgiving our sins and trespasses and releasing us from all guilt and and shame. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we can walk away from the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; The things I was, I'm not now. &gt;&gt; Because I'm walking. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm pressing toward those things. &gt;&gt; I'm keeping Christ before me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we got to forget it. Forget the past. Forget forget the hurts. Forget the mistakes. &gt;&gt; Forget the failures. Brother Brandham said, "If I can forget what I was and remember what he is, that's &gt;&gt; if I can remember Jesus, if I can remember him at the cross, if I can remember what he done for me and I can rem and and I can remember the hour that he washed my sins away and give me the Holy Ghost to guide me." Notice that I'm lifted up above everything that holds this earth. I'm lifted above every earthly thing in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I can fellowship with him there in his presence forgetting what I ever was &gt;&gt; forgetting all my sins and everything where in his presence &gt;&gt; because they're in the sea of forgetfulness forgetting all my past forgetting everything and remember that he made me his own By his own death, he took my place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, if you could think of the forgiveness, how many believes you've been forgiven of God? &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Well, most of us. I hope the rest of you find out that forgiveness. It's a wonderful thing to know you've been forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because then your soul becomes light. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not carrying the weight of condemnation, the guilt. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; But now notice what Paul said in Ephesians 4:31, what he tells us now. Let all bitterness, everybody say, let all bitterness &gt;&gt; and wrath and anger, Come on, say it with me. And anger &gt;&gt; and clamor &gt;&gt; and evil speaking. be put away from you with all malice. &gt;&gt; Okay, say it with me on this one. 32nd verse. And be ye kind &gt;&gt; one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another. Uh forgiving one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 3:13, forbearing one another, forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then the forgiveness of Christ is to continue in us, &gt;&gt; with us. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the only way you're going to forget the past. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the only way you can walk away from it. &gt;&gt; It's the only way that the bitterness won't come into your heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said, "If you're a sinner, raise up your eyes and look." Now, if you've been indifferent, if you've had little squables and little things, what difference does it make? You're gonna die one of these days. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; You're gonna die one of these days. What day? Maybe today. &gt;&gt; You don't know. An hour from now, you may be in hell or you may be in heaven. &gt;&gt; But you've got to choose now. If there's anything in your life that isn't right, you choose now by faith. You say, "Well, if I can just get even with her, if I can just get even with him, no matter what they've done, choose life." &gt;&gt; Choose life. &gt;&gt; For Jesus said, "If from your heart you don't forgive every person their trespasses or transgressions, neither does your heavenly father forgive you." &gt;&gt; So, just get that close. If there's one ought in your heart against any person, sinner or saint, you're in danger of hellfire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, lift up your eyes. What do you see? Your enemy. &gt;&gt; I'll put it this way. Your enemy. Not pointing to the prophet or the picture that's behind you. &gt;&gt; Or do you see Christ &gt;&gt; before you? &gt;&gt; Are you looking in the rearview mirror of what actions people had done? Or are you looking to Christ and forgetting those things that are behind? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now the Bible tells us that forgiveness is given to us as we forgive others. &gt;&gt; We can be released from our guilt as we release others. You sure can &gt;&gt; from guilt. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 6:12, Jesus told us to pray this and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Matthew 6:14, "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also forgive you." Let me ask you, how many needs forgiveness? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need it &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; And not only will I need it now or to yesterday, I'll need it tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; See? So, but if you forgive not in their trespasses, neither will your father forgive your trespasses. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; He ain't measuring what hurt you got. He ain't measuring the cuts you have. &gt;&gt; He ain't measuring how emotionally upset you are. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; As believers, we cannot dwell in the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan's job to keep us in the past. &gt;&gt; Yeah. things that happened in childhood. &gt;&gt; People grow up to be adults, married with children, and still hanging on to past. &gt;&gt; And that's why it takes the grace of God to forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that we're not Holy Ghost filled. It just means there's that sticky nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's That's right. that we got to deal with. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And bring it in subjection &gt;&gt; by faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then again, if if we won't release others of their past, we can't be released from our past. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You might say, well, what if they're doing it present tense? You remember this? While the people were mocking Jesus, while they were wagging their tongue at him, while he's hanging on the cross, &gt;&gt; and while they're criticizing him, scorning him, making fun of him, he looks at them and says, "Father, forgive them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive them. Why? For they know not what they do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to tell you something. Why didn't they know? Because they were blinded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; They were blinded. God had blinded their eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people today are blinded. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Many people are just anointed by an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. They'll do things so ungodly to other people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That in their right mind, they wouldn't have done them things. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But they've given themselves over to spirits. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Paul would say that the god of this world have blinded the minds of them that believe not. &gt;&gt; Blinded their eyes. But there are times that people do things that are good meaning people, righteous people, and they don't even know what they've done to you. &gt;&gt; They're ignorant of these things. And then what does Satan do? He builds a complex. &gt;&gt; He builds things in our minds. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To where it affects our worship. It affects our prayer life. It affects our dedication, our consecration. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It it it affects the fellowship. &gt;&gt; It even affects where we're able not able to say amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And yet it's Satan building these walls. &gt;&gt; That maybe some the other person don't even know what they've done. &gt;&gt; Maybe they just had a bad day. Maybe they were in a hurry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and didn't mean to ignore you. We got to forget the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk away from the past. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes. God. &gt;&gt; And press forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, it's by the same blood that we were forgiven of by with that same blood we forgive others. &gt;&gt; By that same blood. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. Unforgiveness binds us to the past. It binds us to our own past. When we can't forgive ourselves, we constantly looking at what we've done and our mistakes and our failures and when you pray and you're constantly bring it up to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Constantly asking forgiveness for the same old thing, past mistakes. &gt;&gt; It shows that we've not walked away from the past. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right, brother. Go ahead. So we we unforgiveness binds us to our own past but it also will bind us to the other's past. &gt;&gt; So you got to forgive yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to see yourself what what God sees about you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; If God's forgiven you, then you're forgiven. Accept your pardon. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Walk away from the past. Hello, sir. &gt;&gt; Can't keep dwelling on it. Can't keep living in it. We've got a place to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got somewhere to press to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's impossible to move on while keeping the past before us. You see, God couldn't move on in a relationship and fellowship with us if he kept remembering our past. So God in in desiring a relationship with us and fellowship with us, he had to have a remedy to where he would no longer see you as a sinner. He would no longer see you in all your faults and your failures and your miseries &gt;&gt; cuz he couldn't fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; So he had to find a remedy to wipe it all clean. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you've come into his presence and he can't see you. The problem said he doesn't see you. He sees the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So you're no longer a sinner in his sight. &gt;&gt; Now if we can have that blood before us for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See? And so we find that there there there is no limit to the amount of forgiveness we are to give. Everybody say there's no limit. &gt;&gt; No limit. &gt;&gt; No limit. Matthew 18:21. Then came Peter to him and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me? And I forgive him till seven times. Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until 70 * 7. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:3, "Take heed to yourselves, if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him. And if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice what the prophet said. When we get to that brotherly kindness, put yourself in his place on the matter. My brother sinned against me, said Peter. Shall I forgive him seven times a day? Brother Brown said, Jesus said, seven * 7. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; 70* 7. Brotherly kindness. See, if you see a brother that is all out of tune, don't be impatient with him. No. Be kind to him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have faith. Everybody say, "Have faith &gt;&gt; that God will bring him in." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that a pardon is not a pardon unless received as a pardon. &gt;&gt; So, the pardon's got to be accepted. Pardon has no effect upon a man until he accepts it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We accept our pardon by believing it and then asking for forgiveness. For a man to ask for forgiveness shows that he believes in the pardon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If I'm going to get down to the altar, I'm going to say, "God, I I I'm asking you to forgive me. If I didn't believe in that pardoning grace, then why would I ask for him to forgive me?" That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But I believe in that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, as as we wind down here, but we are to leave the past behind and at the same time, we are to press forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Press towards the mark of the high calling of God. That word press is to act upon through steady pushing or thrusting force exerted in contact. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Steady pushing. &gt;&gt; Pressing a force exerting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I'm too tired. You ain't tired enough. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Just quit exerting. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have not felt to come to church tonight, but you got up and you exerted. &gt;&gt; You exerted your energy. &gt;&gt; You may not feel like praying, but you're pressing. &gt;&gt; You may not feel like forgiving, but you're pressing. &gt;&gt; You may not feel like just giving everything over to God, but you're pressing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram said, "These afflictions are testings that God sends our way." So, don't think Don't think for a moment that the devil can bother you without God knowing it or without God's permission. Many are the afflictions or testings of the righteous that God sends their way. &gt;&gt; God going to send it your way. &gt;&gt; Bible says footsteps of the Lord are ordered. The footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I had my way, I'd keep it all from you. That's not God's way. &gt;&gt; That's right. If I had my way, I'd keep it all for me. But that ain't God's way. Hello. &gt;&gt; And I and I shouldn't I shouldn't wake up dreading the day. &gt;&gt; What next? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Oh goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, now notice how brother Brandham approaches this. He said, "How we appreciate that trials and tribulations." Have you ever just prayed, "Lord, I appreciate it." &gt;&gt; But here is the prophet and he's saying how we appreciate it. Trials and tribulations and tests all working for the good. &gt;&gt; After a while, God can see them and he can put his trust in you. &gt;&gt; Praise our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. when he sees you keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; When he sees that you're not just sitting around crying about things and you're not dwelling on the past, but you're pressing, &gt;&gt; God sees it and says, "I can put trust in him. &gt;&gt; Trust in her." &gt;&gt; And then he will do great things for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say that again. And after a while, God can see in that he can put his trust in you and then he will do great things for you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So when bitterness is trying to overtake you, press towards the mark of the high calling of God. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of unbelief is trying to overtake you, press to for the mark or the prize of the high calling of God. When fear is trying to overtake you, when discouragement is trying to do you under and and confusion is trying to set in, press toward the markise &gt;&gt; of the high calling of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Because when you're pressing towards, you're going forward. &gt;&gt; When you're pressing, you're going forward. You're pressing, Brother Bill, is not in vain. &gt;&gt; Very true. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Your pressing's not in vain. &gt;&gt; He didn't promise us a flower flowery bed of ease. &gt;&gt; But he promised we're going to make it. &gt;&gt; He did promise that there's a sunshine there. There's there's eternal things at the end of this thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, Christians don't give up and quit. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have given your heart to Jesus Christ and haven't been baptized, then I'd encourage you to do so. Keep pressing. You press into that. Don't just sit around and be dirty and just be halfhazard about it. If God saved you, we ought that ought to make us the happiest people on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Press on to be baptized. Brother Bram said, "Baptism is essentual to salvation." If you've been baptized and you haven't received the Holy Ghost, don't you stop there. Amen. But you press. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Press. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To receive it. If you believe that God sent a prophet and this message came from the prophet of Malachi 4, then press on to believe all that he taught. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Press on till your flesh becomes the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says each new year, you know, people approach the new year and they try to press into it by turning a new page. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he said that's not how you press into the new year, turning a new leaf, you know, saying a New Year's resolution or whatever. But that's not what we how we press on. Brother Ram said we press into the future by turning to the word. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We're not entering into the future. I don't want to face tomorrow. Amen. Just open-minded with well happy golucky. Whatever come my way, that's what I'll get. No, I want to look at that word and see what's promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, see what the word promises for today. see what the light of the day is supposed to be. What we ought to do this year is not go back to creeds and things. Go back to our old denominations, not go back to old denominations, but turn to the word. See what kind of light is supposed to shine today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See what a born again believer is to be of today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, oh church, turn to the word. Get back to the word. Flip the right switch. Quit punching around on electric lights and artificial man-made light. See, turn to his word and see the promise of today. &gt;&gt; Then see what the promise is and watch for its identification. When it's vindicated, then you know whether you're in the light or not. See what the promise is. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we look to the word, we see what age we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We see that we're living in the grandest age of all ages. Why? Because it's the it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity. &gt;&gt; We're here, church. We're living in the rapture age. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the mighty angel has descended and has declared time shall be no more, &gt;&gt; church? There is going to be a last time for everything. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a last time that you come to this church. There's going to be a last time that you hear a message preached. There's going to be a last time, amen, that you say, "Amen," in this mortal body. There's going to be a last time that you hug your brother and shake your sister's hand. There's going to be a last trial that you go through. &gt;&gt; For sure, &gt;&gt; the works of men will cease. Politics will cease. Religions will cease. Hate and bitterness will cease. civilization as we know it's going to cease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these things these things aren't the high calling that we're pressing to. We're not pressing to be a politician. We're not pressing, Amen, to to to reach some great status in the church. We're not pressing for these things. And one place, Brother Brandham tells us that the high calling is the complete identification. the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's then we'll be changed from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin will be gone and there will be a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; There will be a millennium. We will be living in the new city, new Jerusalem. Revelations 22:5. And there shall be no night there. They they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign forever and forever. Can you say, "Amen." These are the things that were pressing to. Amen. Jesus said in John 14:1, "Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me." Amen. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we know we're going to that place? How do we know? How do I know? How do you know? David said, "It's the deep calling to the deep." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the deep in us that is responding to the call. &gt;&gt; It's what's causing us to keep pressing towards. &gt;&gt; It won't let us get slack. It won't let us get when our hands start getting weary &gt;&gt; and we want to just sit down and give up. There's something in us that just keeps causing us. &gt;&gt; It's pulsating. It's that bubbly spring that Brother Brandham talked about. There's just something there. See, we're not just sitting around waiting and dillydallying with the world and and all of these things, but we're pressing. You see what we're doing in here tonight and and tomorrow and every minute of the day is we're giving witness to the place that we're going. We're giving witness that there is something beyond this mortal realm. Can you say amen? Amen. I thought of when Joseph was yet in Egypt, he told him, he said, "Now," he died, &gt;&gt; but he told him, he said, "Now, when you leave this place, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; you take my bones with you. &gt;&gt; Take them with you. &gt;&gt; Take them with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here. I don't want to be left here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, think of that. Brother Bram said he believed that there would be a resurrection in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was looking for it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was looking for it. So he said, "Don't you bury me here. Don't don't don't just leave me here. You You pick up my bones and you carry them with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and brother Brandon said he wanted to make every testimony against the devil that he could. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He could have just sat there and said, "All right, just bury me and good luck, guys, and so long." But he wanted to make a testimony done to Satan against the devil. You take me with you because there's going to be a resurrection come in that promised land and the devil ain't going to be able to stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon made a statement and I really never thought of it, but he said there was a lot of others that died in Egypt. He wasn't the only one that died. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There been 400 years in slavery. &gt;&gt; So, there was others that died, but he said, "You never hear one of them. saying, "Take my bones with you." &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a resurrection. He said, "You never heard them. They just fell anywhere. &gt;&gt; They were buried there. They just buried. If they were buried over there, they were just buried." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He said anywhere was all right with them. They just fall anywhere. But not Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said there was something in him, something that had the same vision that Job had. the same vision the rest of them had. No matter what the rest of the world thought, what they' done, that had nothing to do with Joseph, that had nothing to do with Abraham, with Isaac, with Jacob, with all the rest of them. Something pressed to that promised land. &gt;&gt; Something fanatically, but they wanted it because there was something in them. And I have to tell you, church, there's something within every believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something within every believer today that presses them to it. Prophet says, "No matter. You can try this, that, or the other, but there's something that presses. You know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there's a city whose builder and maker is God. You know that there's something there. So, you press, &gt;&gt; you press to it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "See, we believe it by faith and we feel." I want you to notice how he says this. We believe it by faith. We can't see it, but we just believe it by faith. And we feel from the other world the echoes of glory moving back into our souls, indicating it's true. It's true. Press on to the mark &gt;&gt; of the high calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you feel that in your soul tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You may not see it. &gt;&gt; You may not see that new city. You may not see that new body. and all you look at is this old body. You may not see the things that we talk about, &gt;&gt; but there's something down in your soul that's testifying it's true. &gt;&gt; It's true. Press on &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Press on. &gt;&gt; I've got just a little bit of time. If Judith, if you'll play that tape. Last Sunday morning I was waking up early that was on Saturday this vision on always wearied I've always thought of dying at me being 50 it's my time is not didn't think was too long and I wonder why I would be in this theophony celestial body would it be that I'd see my precious friends and say a whites fog going by and say there goes brother Neville or he couldn't say hello brother Brandham and when Jesus come then I'd be man again I often thought that I was dreaming that I was out west and I coming down through a little sage brush place and my wife was with me and we'd been trout fishing and I stopped and and opened up the gate and the skies were so pretty. They didn't look like they do over the valley here. They were blue in the pretty white clouds. And I said to wife, I said, "We ought to have been out here a long time ago, honey." She said, "For the children's sake, we should have been, Billy." I said, "That's" and I woke up. I don't know, I'm screaming so much. I wonder why. And I looked down and she was laying by me. And I raised up on my pillow as many you people have done, put my head up on the the headboard of the bed and put my hands behind me. I was laying there like this and I said, "Well, I just wonder what it will be the other side. I am already 50 and I haven't done nothing yet. If I could only do something to help the Lord. For I know I won't be mortal. Half of my time is gone. At least or more than half. If I live to be as old as my people, still half my time is gone. And I looked around and I was laying there fixing to get up. It's about 7:00. I said, I believe I'll go down church this morning. If I am horse, I'd like to hear brother Neville preach. So I I said, "Are you awake, honey?" And she was sleeping very soundly. And I don't want you to miss this. It has changed me. I can't be the same brother of Brandon that I was. And I looked and I heard something kept saying, "You're just starting. Press the battle." &gt;&gt; Just keep pressing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I shook my head a minute. I thought, well, I probably just thinking like this, you know, your persons can get some imaginations. And I said, I just probably imagine that. It said, "Press the battle. Keep going. Keep going. &gt;&gt; I said maybe I said it. And I put my lips within my teeth and put my hand over my mouth. And there it come again. Said just keep pressing. If you only knew what was at the end of the road. And it seemed like I could hear Grim Snelling or somebody that sang that song like this. He sings at your anime and all of you all. I'm home sick and blue and I want to see Jesus. I would like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime. It would brighten my path and would vanish all fears. Lord, let me look past the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; You've heard it saying here at the church. &gt;&gt; And I heard something say, "Would you like to see just beyond the curtain?" I said, "It would help me so much." And I looked in just a moment. I one breath I'd come into a little place that slanted. I looked back and there I was laying on the bed. And I said, "This is a strange thing." Now, I would not want you to repeat this. This is before my church or my sheep that I am pastoring. Whether it was I was in this body or out, whether it was a translation, it wasn't like any vision I ever had. I could look there and I could look here. And when I hit that little place, I'd never seen so many people come running, screaming, "Oh, our precious brother." And I looked and young women maybe in their early 20s, 18 to 20. They were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother. Here come young man in the brilliance of young manhood. And their eyes glistening and looking like stars on a darkened night. their teeth as white as pearl. And they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming, "Oh, our precious brother." And I stopped and I looked and I was young. I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said, "I don't understand this." and these young women throwing their arms around me. Now I do realize this is a mixed audience and I say this with the sweetness and with the mellaness of the spirit. Man cannot put your arm around women without uh a human sensation but it wasn't there. &gt;&gt; There was no yesterday or tomorrow. They didn't get tired. They were I never seen such pretty women in all my life. They had hair way down to their waistline, long skirts to their feet. And they were just a hugging me. It wasn't a hug like even my own sister sitting there would have hugged me. They were not kissing me and I was not kissing them. It was something that I I have not got the the vocabulary. I haven't got the words to say. Perfection wouldn't touch it. Suburb wouldn't even touch it nowhere. It was something that I never You just have to be there. And I looked this way and that way and they weren't coming by the thousands. And I said, "I don't understand this. I said, "Well, they and here come hope." That was my first wife. She run and never said, "My husband." She said, "My precious brother." &gt;&gt; And when she hugged me, there was another woman standing there that hugged me. And then Hope hugged this woman and each one and I thought, "Oh, this has to be something different." It it can't be. There's something. I thought, "Oh, would I ever want to go back to that old carcass again?" I looked around there and I thought, "What is this?" And I looked real good and I I said, "I I can't understand this, but hope seemed to be like uh oh, a guest of honor." She was no different, but just like a guest of honor. And I heard a voice there that spoke to me that was in the room said, "This is what you preach was the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love &gt;&gt; and nothing can enter here without it. I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there. &gt;&gt; There was no jealousy. There was no tiredness. There was no death. Sickness could never end there. Mortality could could never make you old. And they could not cry. It was just one joy. Oh, my precious brother. And they took me up and set me up on a great big high place. &gt;&gt; And I thought, I am not dreaming. I'm looking back at my my body laying down on the bed. And it set me up there. And I said, "Oh, I shouldn't sit up here." And here come women and man from both sides just in the bloom of youth screaming. And one woman was standing there and she screamed, "Oh, my precious brother. Oh, we are so happy to see you here." I said, I don't understand this. And then that voice that was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people. &gt;&gt; And I said yes I remember that in the scriptures said but this is when you will gather with your people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said then they'll be real and I can feel them. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said but I there's a millions. there's not that many Brandhams. And that voice said, "They're not Brandoms. Them's your converts." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the ones that you've led to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And said some of them women there that you think is so beautiful were better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord. No wonder they're screaming our precious brother. And they screamed all at once that if you hadn't have went, we wouldn't be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I looked around. I thought, "Well, I don't get it." I said, "Oh, where is Jesus? I want to see him so bad." They said, "Now, he's just a little higher right up that way." Said, "Someday he will come to you." She said, "You were sent for a leader &gt;&gt; and God will come and when he does, he'll judge you according to what you taught them &gt;&gt; first. whether they go in or not, &gt;&gt; we'll go in according to your teaching. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, I'm so glad. If Paul, does he have to stand like this? Does Peter have to stand like this?" Yes. I said, "Then I preached every word that they preached. I never did it from it one side to the other." &gt;&gt; Were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ? I did, too. where they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I did too. Whatever they taught, I did too. &gt;&gt; And then people screamed and said, "We know that and we know we're going with you someday back to earth." &gt;&gt; Said, "Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us." And then if you are accepted at that time which you will be and said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry. &gt;&gt; Said you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the earth to live forever. &gt;&gt; I said do I have to return back now? &gt;&gt; Yes. But keep pressing on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming wanting to hug me, screaming, our precious brother, just a voice said, "All that you ever loved. And all that ever loved you, God has given you here." &gt;&gt; And I looked and here come old dog come walking up. Here come my horse and laid his head up over my shoulder. knickered said, "All that you ever loved and all that ever loved you, God has given them into your hands &gt;&gt; through your ministry and I felt myself move from that beautiful place [Music] and I looked around. &gt;&gt; I said, "Are you awake, honey?" She's still asleep. And I thought, "Oh God, oh help me. Oh God, never let me compromise with one word. Let me stay right straight on that word and preach it. I don't care what comes or goes, what anybody does, how many Sauls of sons of Kish rise, how many this that or the other. Let me Lord press to that place. all fear of death. I say this with my Bible before me this morning. I've got a little boy there at four years old to be raised. I got a nineyear-old girl and a teenager that I'm thankful for that's turned the way of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, let me live to bring them up in the admonition of God. And above that, the whole world seems to scream to me. 90 year old women and men and all kinds. If you hadn't have went, we wouldn't been here. &gt;&gt; God, let me press the battle. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; But if it comes to dying, I am no more. Uh it would be a joy. It would be a pleasure &gt;&gt; to enter from this corruption and disgrace. If I could make up yonder 100 billion miles high, a square block, and that's perfect love. Each step this way, it narrows until we get down to where we are now. It would be just merely a shadow of corruption. That little something that we can sense and feel that there's something somewhere. We don't know what it is. Oh my precious friend. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; my beloved, my darlings of the gospel, my begotten children unto God. Listen to me, your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. you. I wish there was some way I could explain it to you. There's no words. I couldn't find it. It's not found anywhere. But just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever There is no way to explain it. There's no way. I just can't do it. But whatever you do, friend, lay aside everything else till you get perfect love. &gt;&gt; Get to a spot that you can love everybody, every enemy, everything else. &gt;&gt; That one visit there to me has made me a different man. I can never never never be the same brother Brandham that I was. &gt;&gt; Whether the planes are rocking, whether the lightnings are flashing, whether the spies has a gun on me, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I'm going to press the battle by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Well, I preach the gospel to every creature and every person that I can, persuading them &gt;&gt; to that beautiful land on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Press on the musicians will come. &gt;&gt; May we sing that song in Jesus name. We press on in Jesus name. We press on [Music] dear Lord with the prize clear before our eyes. We find the strength to press on. Can we sing that again? Oh, in Jesus name we press on. Are you going to press on? Hallelujah. Oh, in Jesus name we press on.

[Music] And by faith we can see it afar in the sweet by and by. For the Father waits over the way [Music] to prepare us, a dwelling place there. It's in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore [Music] in the sweet [Music] in Oh, we shall meet on that beautiful shore. Well, we shall sing on that beautiful shore.

My am I we shall meet on that beautiful shore [Music] in the sweet [Music] and love. Oh, we shall meet on that beauty. Now, as they just play softly, God bless you is our prayer. Appreciate you being attentive, patient, and pray that something was said tonight to help you in your journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatever we must do, whatever we do, we must lay everything aside and press. Press. Going forward is not easy, but you can do it. I can do it because there's something there ahead of us that we're going to. And your faith is not in vain. Can you say amen? God bless you. Love you. and remember service um Sunday at 11:00 and um um we want to remember the fellowship dinner after the morning service and um and u I think it's going to be at the frog pond uh there and so um we look forward to a wonderful time in the Lord.
