with medication amen so let's remember these requests how many have a need on your heart you like to be remembered this morning forus if you would uh just remember our pastors as he comes that the Lord would just use him in a mighty [Music] way I guess you could say there's probably nothing more unpleasant and to have a house full of insects that's tormenting you mosquitoes flies bugs of all types you know stink bugs we got to deal with them seem like year round and uh all these ear wigs and stuff like that you know and that's that's one side of it and then you think about this house that we live in all the pests that come around to torment God's children and we know that they're messengers of the devil uh really to trouble us and this human body is susceptible to these things it's got some built-in defenses but Satan just knows how to navigate around those defenses sometimes and attack our bodies but we're thankful for the power that we have the protection of the blood I believe there's power in the blood there's the life of the blood to certainly Deliver Us and to heal us and uh I also want to say that means this is a time of year that we certainly really I'm glad we've seen a star in the east we certainly have come to worship him let's look to the Lord this morning and also remember our brother as he prepares to bring the word to us dear God we're we're thankful this morning dear God that Lord we've we've uh Lord got the best thing Lord for insects and diseases father God and all these nasty bugs that that come and go and they want to torment us and Lord there Co still hanging around Lord and still tormenting people Lord we've got all kinds of things on our houses to clean our houses to keep our houses tidy and Lord to disinfect oh God and Lord and raid and and so forth is that that we use maybe against insects but dear God we've got something this morning dear God that's absolutely guaranteed to kill every devil lord to kill back the influences of the devil dear God the the life of the blood dear Jesus hasn't got all the antibodies in it dear God that if we have it flowing through our veins that Royal Blood we know that it is a Persuader against the devil it's a Persuader against the enemy that would try to move in like a flood and torment your children Lord with all sympathy and Lord heartfelt this we pray for those Among Us Lord that are sick Lord several Lord Jesus of this congregation not feeling well Lord we pray God you might strengthen their body this morning dear God and may you heal them Lord may they believe for total and complete healing Lord we know it's the grace of God that we are here this morning we know that it's by your divine presence Your Divine Life Lord we stand here in this church this morning we didn't know that during the night the enemy may have tried to afflict our bodies but dear God you kept it from us Lord but we know still yet Lord we can wake up in the morning be sick but Lord that's not the final final deal Satan thinks he can knock us down that God you've got the answer you've got the answer to the devil's question it's a solution to a problem and it's a life of the blood we plead the blood of Jesus Christ over all these needs I think of brother Mark's uncles oh God lord these ones Lord blockages and Lord different things going on in their body infections God we pray for deliverance Lord we pray for their souls oh God Lord Lord we pray for the souls of many that have the disease of unbelief the disease of sin dear God that needs to be eradicated Lord God we pray that

not the same I'm changed forever in his presence amen aren't you glad for the presence of the Lord amen thinking of the today of course we know that Christ wasn't born on December but yet it's set aside as Memorial morial of of what had happened and you know we if it wasn't for that first Christmas where would we be today amen and and Christ was nothing but the manifestation of God to declare his presence and uh I'm I'm so glad for that amen nothing like the presence of the Lord man there have been prophets come along throughout the ages and and they had a portion of the word but something different about this one amen for it was God manifested able to Incarnate himself Amen in in human flesh and boy the angels of heaven declared him amen they sang at his birth amen declaring to the world Amen what was able to happen amen I'm so glad for that and you know the prophet described it of how that that little baby there in that manger amen and all the Angels peing over to see God in human flesh to see what God looked like amen it was the beginning of of something that God would declare his mystery in his mind amen and they have no idea amen they just seen God as a light amen but never had they seen God as a human amen and they all just stood there breathlessly looking at the banners of Heaven to see that baby be there you know and I think of today how God's mystery has been totally unfolded and it must be must be unique even to the angels to see what God really had in his mind amen that they just looking over and seeing us amen as the body of Christ today fully manifested Christ able to fully manifest himself in a people today I'm soad glad for that amen let's just sing this song Amen um we all know it I guess and if you if if I mess up you sing it with me the The First Noel amen um I don't know we'll try the The First Noel the angel did say was to serve poor shephers in Fields as they lay in fields where they lay keeping their sheet on a cold win night that was so deep Noel no well Noel Noel born is the king of isra they looked up and saw a star if y'all know what sing it now the East beond them far and to the Earth it gave great light and so it Contin and night no well no well Noel Noel born is the king of Israel and by the light of that same star three wise men came from country far to seek King was there intent and to all over wherever it went Noh no well Noel no well born is the king of the Israel this star Drew night to the north west over [Music] Bethlehem it took its rest and and there it did both stop and stay right over the place where Jesus lay aren't you glad for that oh well oh it took his stopping Place Noel born is the king king of Israel then enter in those wise men three forly up on their knee and offer there in his praise their gold and M and fr in sins no well no well no no well born is the king of Israel you know I thought of that star that that the wise men sang or or followed brother BM said it was the same Pillar of Fire prise God Amen and they it was a supernatural star I thought it's the same star that we see today the same light that God had his picture taken with and what a significance it is you know Christmas it has a lot to do with us today as the bride of Christ because if there wasn't God wasn't able to find a a womb a virgin womb to to borrow for his word to be planted in and to be able to become incarnate in human flesh amen you know then then again we wouldn't be able to do what or to worship the way we do today you see but because God was able to find a womb in that day he's able to purchase a people to redeem a people to set us free to call us out of the world and with his own blood he saved us he redeemed us that in this day he could borrow a womb again amen and you know I I'm so glad that God has been able able to find and we are that people that God has been able to reflect himself because he's been able to borrow a womb and that womb is our heart ain't that right I thought of brother brandham he said here said she speaking of Mary said she just borrowed a womb that God used amen or she was just borrow a borrowed womb that God used no more than any other woman that God could take a nation to use and he might use your WB the womb of your heart to declare his son if you had just let him do it my my my and I'm so glad there's a people that's letting him do it amen I'm so glad that he is he is he's part of us and that we're just like Mary we're not doing what Eve done but we're saying be it unto me according to Thy word oh aren't you glad for that church

have to be something perfect it doesn't have to be anything great God proved it when he took that little girl as a virgin and began to develop the word in her heart he proved it when that baby was born in a stinking manger that oh what God can do if we just let him do it Hallelujah and as the word is going forth today let our hearts be that manger said oh God create your word in US Lord Let

heart oh be it unto me according to your word according to promises I can stand secure right upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word oh Lord be it unto me amen how many is that your desire here this morning amen I truly believe that's our desire this morning is the Lord to be uh born right out of our Lives amen amen not just a church me remember but a living epistle amen written of God manifested and and plainly declared in this generation amen and amen to be a part of the body of God is such an honor this morning and amen we say God bless you all want to welcome you to the house of God this morning amen it's a beautiful day to serve the Lord it on the outside sure don't feel like December feels a little bit like the spring but amen we're sure thankful for the nice weather the Lord's give us and amen I always enjoy going to church on Sunday morning amen the resurrection to honor him and to worship Him and amen the musicians can be dismissed this morning we

it but uh before we open the word let's just buy our hearts together this morning and maybe you just have a special need up on your heart you say Lord remember me I believe he's mindful today Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Resurrection Sunday father Lord as your Prophet Tau us to the world it's just a it's another day it's another time of the week but Lord to the believer father it's an opportunity together with Believers of like Precious faith and Lord as we come here this morning we realize the season that we're living in is the Christmas season father and Lord to the world no doubt churches that are gathered this morning no doubt the bill buildings are Fuller than they've been all year since Easter Lord but father I'm so thankful to be gathered with a group of people that don't just acknowledge you once or twice a year but Lord every hour every second of Our Lives we acknowledge without you we cannot take another step father without you we don't have a future but Lord with you this morning all things are possible so we come to you this morning to worship you thanking you for all that you've done for us the blessings the power the peace the anointing all the things that you've given us God we thank you for it this morning and as we come to this portion of the service now endeavoring to look into your word I pray that you would send the spirit of Revelation into the meeting Lord may you take these few things that you've laid upon on our heart and father some way somehow may you reveal them and place them into the lives of your children Lord that it would not just be another sermon Lord it would not just be another Lord time of rehearsing scriptures and quotes but Lord it would be an a mayus road walk where you would come father and you would Would Walk Among Us in the power of your resurrection and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen the book of Ro Romans the 10th chapter and I just want to read one verse there and then we're going to look in the Book of Luke the first chapter but in Romans 10 and verse 17 we've been speaking uh here out of these uh passages scripture but this morning I just want to read the 17th verse Paul says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God brother BR said or by the word made manifest Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God made manifest now in the Book of Luke the first chapter I want to read uh the beginning in the 26th verse I know this is a very a very familiar reading to the church as Believers here this morning in Luke 1 and verse 26 the Bible said and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee and to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell brother B said that means stop Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee and blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God isn't that beautiful words amen and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord shall give unto him the Throne of of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be amen seen I know not a man and the angel said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she also shall conceive a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible now I love verse 38 and Mary said behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word amen be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here today I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments uh speak to you here out of these scriptures and just maybe to Contin on I think this will be the third part on faith cometh by hearing but this morning I want to just pull a portion out of that amen I want to talk to you about moving forward by Faith's power amen moving forward by Faith's power you know uh I want to read to you Romans 10 and verse 17 out of the Amplified Bible I think it's a very powerful reading it means in Romans 10:17 the Bible said out the Amplified Bible so faith comes from hearing what is told amen faith comes from hearing what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message concerning Christ amen Faith Comes By by what is being told and it's heard by the preaching of the message concerning Christ now in the message Faith 1953 brother said if we are God's children by Heir amen then Heirs of the kingdom and we're Heirs of Abraham then we should walk as our Father Abraham walked how many agrees we should walk amen as our Father Abraham walked and call those things which are not as though they were if God had said they were see if God said that they are then we don't know how it's going to be but God said so so we just believe it and move forward walking by faith we don't know how we don't know when but we just know it's going to happen so we believe it amen and we move forward walking by faith brother said what a beautiful life just think that Abraham and a hundred years old yet many disappointments many upsets he had like all the Christians do amen waiting on the promise but yet the Bible said that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief he said there's many things taking place famine and distress and things happen amen but Abraham did not stagger he still believed that God was going to give him that baby amen Abraham received the word of the Lord and moved forward under under the promise of God Amen calling things that were not as though they were and things that were as though they were not now the last time we spoke to on this subject if you remember we spoke about how that Faith amen from the innermost from the heart is the way that God Amen will bring things to past not from the outside but from the inside and I believe this morning that face power amen resides not in our intellects amen but it resides in our heart and I believe that it's not an intellectual Faith amen but I believe that it's a heart faith I believe that it's a Faith from the heart amen that brings God's word to pass now in the book of Hebrews 11th chapter you all are very familiar with this verse the Bible said that faith is the substance right of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he said for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand amen that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear brother said what is faith is God by the spirit amen revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised how many will sayen right there that faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised now if you only hear amen see Faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not Faith seed amen a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25 cense is not the loaf of bread see hearing only brings the word that produces is the faith see when faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen then you see you hear the word amen and God reveals it to you that it is the truth amen and by Spirit reveal truth can we say that together Spirit reveal truth God confirms your faith to God then that's the church that God built upon the rock amen that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen I love this powerful quote brother said face power amen brings to pass God's revealed Revelation how many will agree amen that face power amen is not built upon the way things are not built upon the way things are looking but it's built amen upon God's word amen that he's not just able but he is more than able Amen to bring to pass the promise of his word Amen brother I'm speaking one time of a farmer how amen that that farmer will go out and sew a wheat field he said if he keeps digging it up looking at it he will never have wheat he said so you just got to sew it and let it alone amen you just got to sew it and let it alone see if you go out there every day and dig it up you're never going to have a harvest amen but here's a prophet giving you instructions you sew the seed amen and move forward amen amen you don't go back and dig it up and check it and and analyze it amen but when the seed is in the ground amen then you rest in the seeds ability amen that through the sunlight and the water that that seed amen is going to bring forth a heart Harvest and I believe amen that God has sent a message in this generation amen that we're not still going back and analyzing it and trying to pick it apart amen but that message is sown Amen in the heart of every believer in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen and we're not looking back we're not looking to the left or we looking to the right amen but we are moving forward this morning Amen in the power of God knowing he's able to bring to pass amen the promise behind the seed he said just let it alone and move move forward see amen it's up to God to bring it forth it's up to God to send the rain and if you it's up to you to accept God on his word amen and it's up to God to bring his word to pass amen that's a preaching point for an hour amen it's up to God to bring his word to pass it's not up to me it's not up to you it's not up to the pastor not even up to the prophet it's up to God Amen to bring his word to pass no man's worth any more than his word and God's not worth a bit more than what his word is and I say this with a challenge of faith that every promise of God Amen will be brought to pass amen that's a challenge of faith that every promise of God Amen will be brought to pass if you take the right mental attitude towards it amen and the right mental attitude is not a negative attitude it's not a questionable attitude amen but it is a positive attitude that God's word is able to bring to pass what he said it would do now you all know these things but brother takes time in 1965 Amen to lay out a beautiful Point amen that faith is a revelation from Goden you all agree that faith is a revelation from God and the anointed once at the end time he said what is Faith amen faith is something that's revealed to you that it is not yet but you believe it will be so you can't see it you can't feel it you can't see it you can't smell it you can't touch it amen but you believe believe it amen and because you believe it it's not yet but you know it will be amen see faith is a revelation of the will of God so by Revelation and the churches today he said they don't even believe in spiritual Revelation amen they believe in a dogmatic teaching amen of some system again in works is Faith Express 65 he said now Faith is a revelation from God right amen there's where I want to stay just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the Revelation Amen in an audience of people he said when a prayer line comes through you'll find some and they're all good people amen but there's some that's trying hard to believe it they're trying to work themselves into it amen and some just can't do it at all and others is just by Grace it's just given to them amen now see there is a difference amen so you don't work your way into a healing you don't work your way into salvation come on let me just go ahead and preach to you amen Mary did not work her way in Amen to bring forth the promised son amen but Mary was predestinated amen by the faith of God from before the foundation of the world Amen to bring to pass God's desire Amen to provide an atonement come on church amen Mary didn't have the ability amen but God give her the ability amen Mary didn't have the position but God give her the position amen I'm way ahead of myself but I feel it here amen and there's another Mary on the Earth today amen we don't have the abilities we don't have the positions amen but we got a womb amen we got a heart and we got a faith to believe that if God said he chose us there ain't enough devils in Hell Amen to reverse the the choice of God let me just go and put that devil on notice amen I don't know how it's going to happen but it's going to happen I don't know when it's going to happen but it's going to happen I can't see how it's going to happen but I believe by faith through the grace of God that it's going to come to pass because God said so and I'm just going to move forward that's right I'm just going to move forward now amen that does it that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God Amen brother will faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first so before you get the Fulfillment you must get the Revelation before you see the Fulfillment of the promise you must receive the Revelation that is going to happen that's why the prophet said that the Rapture is a revelation and that's why the bride amen must have rapturing faith and rapturing Grace it's going to take Faith and and Grace to take a Rapture not rapturing works amen rapturing faith and rapturing Grace and you don't work your way into Faith amen if you got faith it's because God by his Sovereign Grace give you that Faith how about the reason why you got faith to believe that you're going to change your body is because God by his grace has deposited into your soul amen the ability to believe that with God Amen all things are possible I don't see how it can happen I don't see how gray hair can turn back back again I don't see how stoop shoulders amen can come straight I don't see how that loved ones that's been in the ground for years are going to raise Incorruptible but I have a promised word and that word is swn into my heart and regardless of how I feel regardless of what I see I'm going to let that word reveal I'm going to let that word take predominance into my life and I'm going to move forward brother BR said to the church the bride he in the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her see faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so amen now you know Matthew 16 amen Jesus come there to the disciples and he said who do men say that I the son of man am right and the Bible said that Jesus asked him amen who do you say I am and out of all the ones that answer brother Tim amen Peter spoke up and said listen Thou Art the Christ amen the son of the Living God brother said now how did he get that he said the very next verse Flesh and Blood had not revealed it to him amen but my Father which is in heaven had revealed it he said and I say unto thee amen that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell amen shall not Prevail against you oh come on church amen the prophet said what is that rock it's a spiritual revealed revelation of the word of God Amen Upon This Rock I will build my church amen and the Gates of Hell amen could not Prevail against it he said down Through the Ages we've had Creeds and denominations and what more amen but the Church of the Living God just moves the same we've had Creeds but we're still moving we've had dogmas but we're still moving we've had divisions and fers amen but we're still moving amen because that someday amen the church in the minority now amen will come into the majority how's the church going to come in the majority he said when the redeemed of all ages amen rise to go with her to meet Jesus amen it's the Church of the Living God can I say this those who live by true Revelation amen will always be in the minority those that live by true revelation will always be in the minority Amen brother said a Baptist Minister call me of the day he said I want to straighten you out on your godhead he said you're teaching it wrong he said well sometime brother said right now is a better time than anytime he said cuz I got time to be right he said listen here Mr Brandon he said listen you teach it there's just one God he said I believe there's one God but it's one God in three persons I said sir repeat that again he said it's one God in three persons I said where did you go to school at and he told me the Bible College I said I could believe that amen you cannot be a person without being a person ality and if you're a personality you are a personality to yourself see you're a separate individual being he said well the theologians can ever explain that I said it's by Revelation amen it's by Revelation he said I cannot accept Revelation amen think about that a preacher amen said I cannot accept Revelation I said then there's no way for God to ever get to you amen because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent but it is revealed un babes am men revealed to babes as we'll accept it amen as we'll relearn it amen let me just say this I'm happy this morning to be a babe in Jesus Christ I don't know it all I don't have it all figured out amen but I'm like my sister Mary amen be it unto me Lord according to my word the only thing I can do is accept amen the message that the angel has sent Hallelujah the only thing I can do is accept amen the Angel's message has the power to bring the promise to pass in my life amen listen he said revealed the babes amen such as will learn I said there be no way for God to get it to you amen see watch the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there's no other way to know him only by Revelation Amen to whom the son will reveal him amen Revelation brother said everything is revelation everything is revelation not to accept the Revelation now now let me preach you're just a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you amen if you cannot accept the revelation of the will of God Amen concerning your life you're just a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you amen but I say this Matthew said it like this he recorded Jesus words and Jesus said the the Pharisees are blind he said now watch in Matthew 15:14 let them alone they be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind lead the blind they will fall into the ditch amen the leader and the follower will fall into the ditch you know what that word blind means it means mentally blind so they can see my education they can see by theology they can see by intellect amen but when it comes to the spirit realm they could not discern amen the word of God concerning their life now listen what the prophet said while the Pharisees were blind what made them so blind is they would not accept Revelation or the Vindication of the word the rejection of the Vindicated word is what caused them to move into a blind condition he said and that's the reason today amen that the churches are blind is because they won't accept the Revelation that's being Vindicated if the word says so amen and it's revealed and it's proven and still they won't accept it amen but I want to announce to you that we are not blindly out of sins we are not Bri Pharisees amen but we are the Bride of Jesus Christ that is following the message of the hour and we can say with everything in us today amen that Christ is not hid amen but he's been unveiled and he's in plain view he's in full view the Mighty God has been unveiled and is in the view of every believer here today and if you can see him you can accept him Hallelujah if you can see him you can accept him in the power of who he is now the Propet of God refers to this scripture Romans 16 amen out of him is a power to establish you somebody stay established according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began the revelation of the mystery was Kept Secret since the world began amen but now is made manifest amen the revelation of the mystery was kept secret amen until now but it's now manifest and by scripture of the Prophet according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations amen for The Obedience of faith can I say it to you like this the Revelation was being revealed so you could see it and by seeing that Revelation it would bring an obedience into your life of Faith to the word of God is that okay would bring an Obedience of faith into your life now you all know the scripture Colossians 1:27 to whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory brother BR I cannot accept Revelation then you're a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you but look at Colossians 1 amen but this is the mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you amen the hope of glory oh God when the church had closed the door of Hope the power of God through the seventh angel revealed the mystery of God with Christ amen and opened the door of Hope to the believer and if you can see him and accept him that is your hope for your future the revelation of Jesus Christ is the only way we're going to overcome this layout of sin age brother said what is the mystery of God Amen God in you the Myst of God is God in you the hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the Holy Spirit again in Des Herman of spirit he said now watch and see where the gates of hell is against it ain't against the denomination the government recognizes that the world recognize his denomination but listen he said what's it against it's against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever amen that's what it's against amen the gates of hell is against amen the revelation of Jesus Christ being here now amen in Bride form amen manifesting Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen what are you trying to get at I'm trying to say this amen Satan hates Revelation because when Revelation comes hope comes when Revelation comes Vision comes when Revelation listen Revelation destroys the plans of the Devil Revelation destroys the devil's agenda Revelation destroys the devil's plans for your life amen it opens a whole new picture a whole new outlook uh come on church amen because this message is not an education it's a revelation I've had people tell me brother Kevin they said man this message attracts all kinds of people it attracts some pretty strange ones and I have to agree I have to agree but you know why I say that is because this message is the only message that gives everybody a chance come on it's the only message that'll give everybody a chance that's why there's some strange ones that's why there's some high class and low class and that's why there's black and white and red come on church amen because this is a message of hope it's a message of Revelation it's a message of moving forward we've Stood Still why denominations argued the Revelation for years but now there's a bride on the earth who is moving by the pillar of fire she's moving forward in Faith amen Satan hates Revelation can I say why because he cannot Prevail over it brother Mark he can come against it but he cannot get over it he can come against the church but he cannot get over the church because the Revelation is in the church listen what the prophet said remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukor formal and Powerless amen I might as well preach there amen defile the church making it lukor formal and Powerless amen but listen I think if there's some Revelation in there there ought to be some power I think if there's some Revelation in there there ought to be some fire I think if there's some Revelation in there there ought to be some movement of the Holy Ghost now come on I know why I'm talking about church amen cuz we go through some things and if we're not careful we'll just settle down and say well this has happened and this has happened and that is happening that's happened and this is the this is the outcome of the situation and if you receive the devil's interpretation of your trials and your situations then you will settle down and say I've gone as far as I can go I've done as much as I can do but if you will look me on the devil's interpretation and hear the voice of Revelation he will give you a new outlook he will change your perspective I know what I'm talking about amen cuz we just got well it's Sunday morning we might as well preach I say God bring back the spirit of perseverance in the church amen to learn how to move forward amen regardless of what's going on regardless of What's Happen I say what a prophet said he said God forgive our past amen and bless our future and I'm going to say this you'll never meet your future as long as you're trying to relive your past well if I would have done this different and if I would have said that different and if I would have handled this different amen you'll sit there and become a cold Theologian trying to discuss the statistics of your past amen rather than receiving the revelation of your future but there is a man here that can turn on the light this morning he can forgive the past and he can introduce you to your future by the Revelation I know what I'm talking about amen I'm not going to back up to that devil I refuse to back up I refuse to settle down and say well we've gone as far as we can go we've done as much as we can do come on church amen I'm just going to preach to you am me we may be fewer in number but we're greater in power come on the protag God said as she nears The Headstone is it okay to preach as she nears The Headstone she will become In His Image and the Very works of Christ will be manifested in her what are you saying brother Ander I'm saying amen the devil wants to take his interpretation and interpret your situation and make you formal and Powerless and lukew but if Revelation comes in that Revelation exposes Satan and Reveals His works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word amen sister an I think that's a powerful Point amen I love how the prophet humiliates Satan and says the attempted destruction of God's people amen the devil would have destroyed amen but the Revelation amen caused his plans to fall oh God the Revelation caused his plans to full amen right in his face he attempted to destroy you he's attempted to destroy your testimony he has attempted to destroy your church he has attempted to destroy your family come on church amen but I want to say this he failed the devil failed that Devil's plans fall as the revelation of Jesus Christ exposed that devil and the prophet said the right down to the time he's cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand in because he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army have we forgot that church have we forgot that we are not a sleeping Army we're an invincible Army we're not a defeated Army we're an invincible Army we're not a weak people we're a strong people we're not the overcome we're the Overcomers we're not the defeated we're the defeaters come on Church we're not the whipped we're the whippers come on it's time to put a weapon on that devil it's time to remind that devil who you are you are the manifested revelated sons and daughters of God that have been sent in this age Amen to expose the devil's plans come on church amen the devil started in the Garden of Eden and he had a plan for the human race brother will he had a plan for Humanity he had started through the fall in the garden amen but one day there was a little virgin named Mary who went to the whale and the prophet said I wish had an hour to preach on that whale he said she went to the whale he said when she got down there to the whale he said the problem was amen she had been oh God what can I preach he said the problem was amen that the devil's plans have been defeated you know what I'm talking about amen the devil put a cold Theologian in the pull pit one morning and he got up there and said the days of Miracles is over come on go listen to your Mery belief tables or sermons on the table Heen he said the preacher got up the rabbi and said now Jehovah fed us in the wilderness he was good to us in the desert amen but that Jehovah is not The Miracle Worker today he said he's just wanting us to come to church and just pay our ties and just be faithful to a church brother said when Mary and Joseph sat on the porch he said there was something swept over Joseph and said that was a good sermon until he denied the Revelation that Jehovah still works miracles he said and I just can settle for that I say thank God that Joseph and Mary could not settle down and accept the interpretation of some Co Theologian that for days of Miracles has passed well listen you may not like it amen but I'm not a cold Theologian I'm a Holy Ghost Field fire baptized message of the hour preacher and I refuse to let some dumb devil shut the door the miraculous in my face I may be laughed at made fun of but I still believe that's the Jehovah of the old the Jesus of the new I believe he still heals I believe he still saves I believe he still revives I believe he still works on situations that looks impossible Hallelujah I believe it because I'm not a CO Theologian I've accepted the Revelation now you all know probably God said she got to thinking and he said I just couldn't go there with him I say thank God I just couldn't go there with him and the devil's plans was in the midst of being folded he didn't even know it she went to the whale if the devil would have got his way she would have went to that well believing the days of Miracles was passed but when she got down there she believed that God was still Supernatural and Out of Heaven A light appeared and listen I believe it was the same light that you see in that picture out of Heaven A light appeared and said Hil Mary amen now the part of God said that means stop he said stop Mary here's what's going to happen the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow thee see what happened what she was carrying was the cancellation to the devil's plans without an atonement there was no salvation but if there was an atonement then there was a way being prepared for the Salvation of the human race he said now listen the devil's tempted destruction discrediting of God's word now listen what the prophet said he said he hat hates that he fights that he said but when they get the true Revelation he said Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely forwarded today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain him over in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us brother Daniel but we will prevail over them brother said there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word he said may God by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation oh if the church can only get a fresh Revelation I say That's What Faith Tabernacle needs this morning is a fresh Revelation amen we've let our Revelation get stale we've let trials and we've let tribulations and persecutions and this happen that happen we've let it all get our Revelation so stale but I say this morning amen I'm not a cold Theologian I believe there's a Door of Hope I still believe there's a door of hope that can be opened up this morning and Christ the Revelation can step into the building and he can start at to pull pit and he can go pum to the back door he can go from the left to the right and he can refresh our Revelation come on y'all know what I'm talking about amen get that Revelation back to where no matter what you was going through you could raise your hands in the house of God get that Revelation back that no matter what the devil was throwing at you you still believed you was going to make it get that Revelation back that this message is the truth and everything else is false I say oh God Amen renew our Revelation this morning in the power of the Holy Ghost a fresh Revelation and become by it yeah a fresh Revelation and become by the fresh revelation The Living Word manifested we would do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father brother said very plain he said more than anything pray for Revelation now when it comes to prophecy I say this we cannot lean to our own understanding when it comes to prophecy we cannot lean to our own interpretation if we do we'll find ourselves subjected to the devil's plans now the Bible said in Matthew 7:14 therefore the Lord himself amen shall give you a sign the Lord himself shall give you a sign now watch this Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now let's just go for a few moments back to Isaiah's sermon that morning let of you preachers know what I'm talking about amen Isaiah gets up and he starts preaching and while he's preaching the spirit of Prophecy drops in the meeting and takes over his mouth and he screams out these words Behold a virgin shall conceive let's just say it like this brother amamos amen I know I know you understand this cuz you're a fiery preacher amen you imagine Isaiah preaching and the whole church on fire and then he says something amen you all imagine Isaiah says something and then all of a sudden he says something and the whole church tightens up and he just takes off shouting y'all imagine like I say get up and everybody this Glory God hallelujah glory to God Amen preach and Isaiah says something and everybody sits down he says well glory to God is that okay is that are you with me when he said it there was a spirit of opposition that settled in the building listen now come on but he didn't stop preaching brother Bill he didn't stop when he looked back and the whole crowd was looking him like he lost his mind he didn't stop preaching brother Sean he went right back at it and said a virgin shall conceive and she's going to Bear a son and she's going to call his name Emmanuel he will be the savior of the world he will be the Mighty God he will be the Everlasting father he will be the Prince of Peace Judah you imagine Isaiah got done preaching he walked out the back door and there was Miss Isaiah Mrs Isaiah and she looked at him said Isaiah that was a good sermon but listen that's a little far out there don't you think you prophesied a lot but what you said this morning was a little that's a little ways out there a virgin shall conceive but see Isaiah just stay with it he said well listen the same God that brought the other prophecies to pass can bring this one to pass we're just going to Keep On Believing do you know what happened amen the opposition against Isaiah could not stop him from preaching because there had to be a recorded scriptural description of the Messiah when he come into fulfillment in other words when the Messiah come there would be no room for private interpretation there would be no room for question because everything that he was would be recorded in the scripture and he could say believe me or look in the scripture for they testify of who I am right they testify of who I am watch what the prophet of God said he said 715 years before this ever happened Isaiah prophesied a virgin and shall conceive and shall bear a child listen there's no doubt that everyone in that age thought their daughter would be that woman because Isaiah said it think about how many young girls went home amen that day and their daddy said you're never getting married you're that virgin you're that girl amen but here's the problem amen before Isaiah prophesied it the Virgin womb was already selected before Isaiah spoke it in the mind of God the womb was already there it was already prepared you could not make yourself that virgin you could not work yourself into that position that was a position chosen by God now watch what the prophet says he said see 700 years later and God didn't need nobody interpret his word Mary was the interpretation God had already by predestination brother Sean was all over this when I coming up amen already reserved to borrow Mary's womb amen and to establish the super sign amen the world was without hope but God by his word through the spirit of Prophecy chose a girl named Mary and reserved her womb by predestination to manifest the super sign he said he cried like a baby in a Manger he play like a boy in the street amen he toed like a man but yet he was Emmanuel and what is Emmanuel God With Us this is the super sign amen God dwelling in the creation he created the super sign he was so poor when he come to Earth he come to a borrowed womb of a borrowed womb of a woman and had to borrow a grave to be buried in come on church amen when he come in the world he come to a borrowed womb when he left the world he left in a borrowed grave listen a virgin shall conceive amen without sexually interception Jehovah borrowed the womb of Mary woman to perform that Duty he oh god Jehovah who owned everything are you hearing me he owned the Stars he owned the moon he owned the Earth but yet he still had to borrow a WB he said see to give an everlasting sign can't you see the real sign it's Jehovah become one of us Jehovah God on Earth as a fugitive a pilgrim in the land that he created he was rejected push laugh that scof that stumbling Stone the unbeliever a rock of offense a devil to the religious world but an eternal sign to the believer God With Us the super sign I think that God had in his mind it would be appealing the human being it is to the believer it is appealing when our God becomes one of us it is appealing to us when our God becomes one of us but to the starchy ungodly a stumbling block so when you preach this Revelation to the believer it appeals to the believer yes it does when you preach it to the unbeliever well it just makes him more unbeliever makes him more starchy now watch a prophet another thing the word was made dust right flesh and dwelt Among Us the Jehovah the word became human became dust and tabernacled with us the Everlasting sign shall never end now watch he said then I'm going to bring it to another point he's brought it now down to John 1 now let's bring it down to Abraham he said then again he must be the Seed of Abraham Abraham of course was the seed of Eve he was the woman's seed that was to bruise the Serpent's head but Abraham if you can catch it he had faith in God Abraham had faith in God now watch this which United the spirit of God with the Flesh of man that's where Faith come from what is Faith it is God by the spirit revealing something he's going to do or he's promised to do and oh God and Abraham was the first body that those two things made in and produced a manifestation of a miracle that's the why he could be the Abraham seed not all flesh but the uniting of the spirit and flesh together god making himself tearing out rooting out all evil amen bringing in the submission the flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner Jehovah coming down through a borrowed womb bringing your flesh come on Church bringing your flesh into submission oh God Amen and rooting out all evil and tearing out everything unlike himself Amen to live with you as a partner are you all hearing me if God is going to dwell in you the first thing he's going to do is bring our sorry stinking rotten flesh into submission to the word of God come on that's what he did when he appeared to Mary brother Matthew he appeared to Mary and Mary's flesh was against her she said it cannot happen it cannot be but when he appeared oh God when the angel appeared the angel told Mary these things shall be oh are you ready for this the Angel's message brought Mary's flesh into submission to produce the promise of the Messiah oh God think of it that God was borrowing Mary's body come on church that's a powerful fault God was borrowing Mary's body not making her God now he just borrowed the womb of the woman brother Timmy was not making her a God he was borrowing her womb the same as he bored borrows this body to preach the gospel from and the same as he bores your body to do the work that he wants to do through you because he still is Emmanuel assigned god with his people God living among his people the super Everlasting sign can I say this you're not the first one to need to borrow something come on you're not the F come on church God had to borrow a body to get on this Earth he didn't have one so he borrowed one now come on I love the definition of borrow it means to take and to use something that belongs to someone else so it does not belong to you it belongs to someone else but you ask to use it with the intention of returning it I could preach here for a second amen are you hearing me I remember one time brother Ian England he told me spander he said there's a book I'm after he said there's a book I'm after I said brother Ivan what book are you after he told me the name of the book I said well brother Ian I don't know if they still print that or not he said I got to get that book back I said well did you ever have it he said I did it one time I said brother Ivan where in the world is it he said well brother asked to borrow it and I said okay he said and he told me to return it he said he told me to return it but he never has he said brother anderw if you're ever out on the road and you find that book I got to have that book I got to have it brother mom printed it years ago he said I got to have it so one day Ben per called me up he said brother he said we got a box of books down here from Missouri church just closed down said you interested of them I said they got this specific book he said it's right here I said hold it I know a man that wants it so I went out picked it up and come back and I went up brother Ivan's house prend and I said brother Ivan I got you something it's like a kid in the candy shop he said I just love this book I love studying it it's got so many nuggets and I said brother Ian I got a question when I seen what the book was it was marriage and divorce I said brother Ian I said I got a question you know who borrowed it why can't you go get it he said I can't ask for it back he said I he said now listen now watch somebody borrows something and they say I'm going to return it now listen they have the intent to return it sometimes they don't sometimes they can't are you hearing me but watch this but it when you borrow something it means also taking in consideration the condition of it when it's returned oh God and there's also an agreement made that if it's returned in a lesser condition than it was

prayer line and a kid standing there and they're from a broken home or a broken situation I can stand there and enter in with him you know why because as a young man God borrowed my life to show that a young man can come out of a broken situation with a mother that believes the message and a family that believes the message and still rise up and say though is me yet I'll trust him come on church

me come on couldn't he have found somebody else oh my but Mary meth the angel and when the angel gave her the message when the angel told Mary there was a faith that come out of what she was being told into her heart and the prophet of God said these words he said it just like this I'm having to skip over a bunch to get here but I'm goingon to get here he said these words in spoken words of the Original Seed when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world is going to defeat you in it when Mary heard from the angel the decree to get to Bethlehem hadn't even come out yet you're absolutely undefeatable not you but God that's in you not Christ not the body but this the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her brother Tim the word she was carrying was undefeatable yes amen the word she was carrying had borrowed her body yes let me ask you this and I'm done how many can say Lord let this Christmas be a change of outlook hallu for me I remember brother Bill Yan and I know I'm slowed down a lot here but I remember brother Bill Yan I back some of y'all remember back in 2013 he suffered a major stroke I remember I went and seeing him one day there at the hospital and brother Timmy's laying there he couldn't talk couldn't eat couldn't I mean just just a vegetable basically a few days later I went by and saw him again he was getting worse and things were looking worse and they said he had a stroke and all these things and I'm saying this in Clos and I never forget brother sea the first time I went and seen him in the rehab center first time that they taken the tra out and he was able his voice was real raspy and he just real in a real weak condition but I walked in there and I went to encourage him I mean it's a bad deal and I walked in brother Tim and instead of me encouraging him he encouraged me Hallelujah I said brother Bill how you doing and brother Tim I never forget these words he said if this is the way I have to go to follow God so be it w in in that condition God borrowed his body to show he can send a man through a major stroke and still come out and say if f is the way I have to go to that's right let our musicians come this morning I think it's there I think it set on your heart this morning you're marry and God's borrowed your body and God will owe no man God will

will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption you believe the word of God on that one promise and went down into the dungeons of Darkness CZ you know God would keep his promise for David was a prophet and the prophet would not lie under the inspiration and I thank the heavenly father that that now we accept and I believe it and I go forward to challenge not for a show but for the glory of God that the men women boys and girls who are sitting here this little group tonight might know and believe that truly you raised up your son Jesus from the dead and he
