[43:23] um let's see John the 19th Chapter
[43:27] chapter and we're just going to read the
[43:30] 30th
[43:33] verse but it said when Jesus therefore
[43:36] had received the
[43:38] vinegar he said it is
[43:40] finished and he bowed his
[43:43] head and gave up the ghost amen may we
[43:48] just bow our heads in a word of prayer

[43:53] thankful for

[43:59] us you never fail Lord and what you have
[44:04] promised to do you've kept your word
[44:07] we're so thankful Lord that we're in
[44:09] your
[44:10] hands father that we can rest our soul
[44:14] upon every promise that you have
[44:17] given and father we're just asking now
[44:20] that you would just come and meet every
[44:23] need this evening Lord I believe that
[44:26] this meeting has been ordained of you
[44:29] and father we're just under great
[44:31] expectation for you to speak to us Lord
[44:34] and not only to speak but let the word
[44:37] be creative in our soul father pray Lord
[44:41] that you would heal the sick Lord or
[44:43] whatever need it would be we commit this
[44:46] service into your hands father in Jesus
[44:49] Christ's name and the church
[44:52] says amen and amen you can have your
[44:55] seats

[45:07] finished and um you know it's a simple
[45:12] phrase there but yet it is uh very
[45:15] powerful you know we're we're living as
[45:18] we all know that we're living in a in a
[45:21] time uh where the world is shaking and
[45:25] and um I believe that we could
[45:27] all uh we're all aware that we're living
[45:30] in the end of
[45:32] time and not just an end of a
[45:35] Generation Um or an end of a cycle but
[45:40] we're we're at the end of all history
[45:44] we're at the end of
[45:46] civilization as we know it we're at the
[45:49] end of it all and um and I believe that
[45:53] the Lord is coming really soon
[45:57] I know we you know it's been said for
[45:59] years and years that the Lord is coming
[46:01] but we're we're seeing things just uh
[46:06] transpire
[46:07] rapidly and uh uh that lets us know that
[46:13] uh the coming of the Lord is imminent
[46:16] and it's not a figment of our
[46:19] imagination uh uh but we can we can
[46:22] match the the uh things that are
[46:26] happening
[46:27] by Prophecy in the scriptures and of
[46:30] course Jesus said as it was in the days
[46:33] of Noah as it was in the days of lot and
[46:36] he gives the comparison that there would
[46:39] be a day that would be just like the
[46:41] days of Noah just like it was in the
[46:43] days of lot and he would tell us that
[46:46] would be at the time of the coming and
[46:48] and the revealing of the son of man and
[46:51] would be at the end of the world and we
[46:53] can truly say we're living in a day just
[46:56] like it was in the days of Noah and as
[46:59] the days of lot and so uh and and I I
[47:03] truly believe that people know that the
[47:06] world is coming to an end we're talking
[47:09] uh it's just constantly you know here
[47:11] lately about world war three and and um
[47:15] uh they're trying to avoid that and and
[47:18] things because they know that if it
[47:20] happens we're not just It's Not Just
[47:23] Guns and and bows and arrows anymore
[47:26] it's uh nuclear powers and and atomic
[47:29] and and things that would destroy the
[47:31] world and so people are are living in
[47:35] constant
[47:36] fear uh because they don't know the
[47:39] future um they they don't know what
[47:42] really holds for them and you know uh
[47:45] which is again another thing that Jesus
[47:48] had said there in Luke 21 and 25 he said
[47:52] there shall be signs in the Sun and in
[47:54] the moon and in the stars and upon the
[47:57] Earth distress of nations with
[48:00] perplexity the sea the waves are roaring
[48:03] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[48:06] for looking after those things which are
[48:08] coming on the earth for the powers of
[48:10] Heaven shall be shaken ain't that right
[48:13] and we find that that uh uh you know a
[48:18] lot of people maybe that that um uh
[48:21] claim to be Christians they're unsure of
[48:24] God's love for them and uh it seems like
[48:27] the gospel somehow today has been taken
[48:31] away from the grace of God and and the
[48:35] ability of God uh to to where it's been
[48:38] perverted uh and and the focus is on dos
[48:41] and don'ts and what you should do what
[48:44] you shouldn't do and and these things
[48:46] and so we try to to Merit our way we we
[48:49] try to to be good enough and all these
[48:52] things but we find out that uh but it's
[48:55] not taking away the
[48:57] problems uh you know and and so I I I
[49:01] believe that Jesus made it so that his
[49:05] children don't have to fear about the
[49:07] future I believe that the uh uh God made
[49:11] it to where his his children don't have
[49:14] to worry about the present things that
[49:16] are taking place we don't have to fear
[49:19] anything that comes our way how many
[49:21] believes that you don't have to fear the
[49:24] doctor's uh uh prognosis you don't have
[49:27] to fear you know when the stock market
[49:30] goes uh uh kapoot and you you don't have
[49:34] to fear when trouble is on every side
[49:37] you don't have to fear you know when
[49:39] maybe your child goes Wayward and uh uh
[49:43] you don't have to fear there there's a
[49:45] place amen that God has provided that we
[49:48] don't have to fear these things and and
[49:51] I know trouble is on every side and I
[49:54] know that the world is getting more
[49:55] wicked and and and people don't seem to
[49:58] have the answers as to what but the the
[50:00] Bible has the answers we have the
[50:02] answers as to to what is going on and
[50:06] yet we don't have to fear uh uh about
[50:10] the these things and and the reason we
[50:12] don't have to fear is because of Calvary
[50:15] how many's glad for Calvary well I'm
[50:17] glad for Calvary um uh because it was
[50:20] that Calvary that Jesus said it is
[50:23] finished it is finished and so what a
[50:26] come Fort them words are to us it it is
[50:30] finished and and I I looked up the word
[50:33] finished it means entirely done amen
[50:36] there's nothing else left to do there's
[50:39] there's no work left you know there
[50:41] there's no need to go back and redo
[50:43] things again uh uh I I if it's finished
[50:47] it's perfect it's it's it's done it's um
[50:52] uh you know and and so time is still
[50:54] ticking but it is finished amen and uh
[50:57] uh the the world is is in a chaos but it
[51:01] is finished that's that's what Jesus
[51:03] said ain't that right and and to think
[51:06] that it was finished before you and I
[51:08] was even born amen of what Jesus is
[51:11] saying and we got to look at what Jesus
[51:13] is meaning by it is finished amen uh uh
[51:18] you know there you know if God takes us
[51:20] home uh there's going to be things that
[51:23] will be left undone for us amen uh you
[51:26] may have plans you may have goals you
[51:28] may have whatever and and I I guess you
[51:32] know just with uh Naturally carnally
[51:35] Speaking no one is ready to to leave the
[51:38] Earth amen we've always got something to
[51:41] do and so that's not what God is uh
[51:44] Jesus was saying when he said it is
[51:45] finished so there must be something that
[51:49] uh God was after a man that God was
[51:52] working for there was a goal that God
[51:55] was was trying to to reach and and and
[51:58] when Jesus said it is finished that
[52:01] means god finished the goal God finished
[52:05] what he was after God finished it was
[52:08] God's time can you say Amen everything
[52:11] is God's time amen so we we look the
[52:15] work of redemption is finished how many
[52:18] believes that amen uh uh uh that's
[52:22] that's what Calvary was was the work of
[52:24] redemption and the apost aost Paul picks
[52:27] up on this and says there in Hebrews 10
[52:30] And1 we are Sanctified everybody say we
[52:34] are
[52:34] Sanctified through the offering of the
[52:37] body of Jesus Christ once for all it is
[52:43] finished ain't that right then he goes
[52:45] in the 12th verse and he says after he
[52:48] had offered one sacrifice for sins uh
[52:52] one sacrifice for sins forever he sat
[52:55] down on the right hand of God the 14th
[52:58] verse for by one offering he has
[53:01] perfected forever them that are
[53:05] Sanctified see it is finished ain't that
[53:08] right so there there's no Topsy Turvy
[53:11] and ups and downs there's no saved once
[53:14] today and lost tomorrow it is finished
[53:18] amen the work of redemption so he'll
[53:20] never have to uh to come back and die
[53:22] for us he'll never have to come back and
[53:24] shed his blood and and and be an an
[53:27] atonement and uh all of these things we
[53:30] were Sanctified once for all and are
[53:34] perfected forever how many believes that
[53:38] amen then the Apostle Peter picks up on
[53:40] it as well and and saying this in in 1
[53:44] Peter 2:24 who his own self bear our
[53:49] sins in his own body on the tree that
[53:52] being dead to sins should live un
[53:55] righteousness by whose stripes we were
[53:59] healed not going to be healed but were
[54:03] healed not going to be perfected we were
[54:06] perfected not going to be Sanctified we
[54:09] were Sanctified everything about Calvary
[54:13] the purpose of Calvary and what Calvary
[54:16] was after God was after to achieve at
[54:19] Calvary amen it was finished ain't that
[54:23] right see and so uh uh uh brother
[54:26] brandham says while you're here seeking
[54:29] out God for your salvation and for your
[54:32] healing that everything that God can do
[54:36] for you he's already done it how many
[54:38] believes that God's already done it amen
[54:41] so while we're looking for God to to do
[54:43] something for us well he's already done
[54:46] it so so we we have to look at what
[54:49] Calvary really meant it is finished amen
[54:52] see and and so it it every sin is for
[54:56] forgiven every sin think of that now is
[55:00] Forgiven every sickness is healed the
[55:04] only thing you have to do is look to
[55:07] Calvary and accept what God has already
[55:10] done for you there it is it's already
[55:13] finished your healing is finished your
[55:16] salvation is finished amen your
[55:19] Perfection is finished amen everything
[55:22] is finished amen at Calvary see so then
[55:26] it it is already finished Jesus said at
[55:29] Calvary it is finished he says then if I
[55:31] was saved I'd say well I got saved 20
[55:34] years ago no I was saved 1900 years ago
[55:38] at Calvary ain't that right see I just
[55:42] accepted it 20 years ago see so God
[55:46] there when Christ died he paid the
[55:48] penalty of both sin and sickness so it
[55:53] is finished ain't that right you may
[55:56] have things that you're going to be
[55:57] doing for the rest of your life but but
[55:59] don't worry about that look at what God
[56:01] done and God's work is finished what he
[56:05] started out to do in your life and what
[56:08] he started out to do in Redemption it is
[56:11] finished now this is why Paul in Romans
[56:14] 8:38 says I am persuaded that neither
[56:18] death nor life nor angels nor
[56:21] principalities nor powers nor things
[56:24] present nor things to come nor height
[56:26] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[56:29] be able to separate us from the love of
[56:32] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[56:36] see that's what Calvary means amen Satan
[56:39] had you in his grip amen Satan had you
[56:42] as a slave his Slave at at and and you
[56:46] done his bidding but at Calvary it was
[56:49] finished his power was broken his
[56:52] influence was broken and now there's
[56:55] nothing that's going to to be able to
[56:57] separate you from the love of God
[56:59] nothing that's what Calvary meant aren't
[57:03] you glad for that amen see so there's no
[57:06] worrying over it there's no fretting
[57:08] about it it is finished God does not
[57:10] want us to to worry about our future he
[57:13] does not want us to worry about our past
[57:15] he doesn't want us to worry about our
[57:17] present it is finished amen see it's
[57:21] brought to a completed State amen God's
[57:25] work of redemption amen was brought to a
[57:29] completed State ain't that right you see
[57:32] it was God's plan in the beginning to
[57:35] save he you know uh as as we know God
[57:39] Amen he was savior he was Redeemer he
[57:42] was healer uh he he was a way maker he
[57:46] was provider he was all of these things
[57:49] was in God the attributes of God but it
[57:53] could not be expressed uh uh unless man
[57:56] had sin amen man had fallen so God
[58:00] allowed man to sin and to fall that it
[58:03] would it would be able God would be able
[58:06] to express an attribute of Savior an an
[58:11] attribute of of Redeemer of healer can
[58:14] you say Amen so then we we know God in a
[58:19] greater way than Adam did in the
[58:21] beginning because Adam didn't know God
[58:24] if as as a Healer as a savior as a a
[58:27] redeemer before the fall yes he had
[58:30] relationship with God but not in the way
[58:32] that you have relationship with God can
[58:35] you say man so it was in God's plan to
[58:38] save and to heal and to redeem you and
[58:42] the plan was finished at Calvary do you
[58:46] believe that amen see so you don't need
[58:48] God to come down and and and come to a
[58:52] body of uh uh uh as he did in Christ and
[58:56] and to die all over again for your sins
[58:59] and every time you fall and make a
[59:01] mistake and and all of these things it's
[59:03] already done so it doesn't matter how
[59:06] bad it gets in your life it is finished
[59:09] it doesn't matter how you feel it is
[59:12] finished can you say amen amen you know
[59:15] uh uh uh and and and Satan cannot undo
[59:19] what God has already done he can't undo
[59:23] what God did at Calvary he can't stop
[59:26] the power of Calvary he can't uh
[59:29] diminish the power of Calvary no matter
[59:32] how bad of a sinner we were amen God was
[59:35] able to reach down and to save our soul
[59:39] it is finished can you say Amen it was
[59:42] finished for the baby it was finished
[59:43] for the teenager it was finished for the
[59:46] worst Harlot the worst uh uh drug addict
[59:50] the worst murderer it was finished on
[59:53] that day at Calvary I'm so glad GL for
[59:56] that see and so Calvary made a way for
[1:00:00] the Holy Ghost to be given into the
[1:00:03] hands of the church amen to impart life
[1:00:07] amen that's what Calvary meant amen uh
[1:00:10] the the prophet of God says it took
[1:00:12] stooped degraded men and women and
[1:00:16] lifted them into a place to be Sons and
[1:00:19] Daughters of God to heal the sick and to
[1:00:22] impart eternal life aren't you glad for
[1:00:25] that that we wouldn't have to remain
[1:00:27] Sinners and we wouldn't have to remain
[1:00:30] uh under the devil's influence and and
[1:00:33] to be vagabonds and Beggars spiritually
[1:00:36] and and and to to claim Christianity and
[1:00:40] not have a relationship with God Amen
[1:00:42] but at Calvary it was finished amen God
[1:00:46] was able to redeem us and make us Sons
[1:00:49] and Daughters of his to where we could
[1:00:52] come back in relationship with him not
[1:00:56] as a sinner not as a beggar not as a
[1:00:58] stranger we don't come to God as Sinners
[1:01:01] we don't come to God as as Beggars and
[1:01:05] and and helpless people amen Calvary
[1:01:08] amen made the difference it made a way
[1:01:11] to where we could come back as Sons and
[1:01:13] Daughters of God Amen so uh uh uh so so
[1:01:20] this is what Calvary meant it gave the
[1:01:22] Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who
[1:01:25] were one unbelievers made them Believers
[1:01:28] and impart spiritual eternal life see so
[1:01:32] Calvary paid the price it paid your
[1:01:34] price amen of what was required it paid
[1:01:38] the price of redemption and it settled
[1:01:40] the question forever amen though your
[1:01:44] sins be as Scarlet uh as the Bible says
[1:01:47] uh they will shall be white as snow amen
[1:01:51] red like Crimson white like wool see
[1:01:54] then the uh uh brother br says you have
[1:01:56] no sin think of that now you have no sin
[1:02:00] amen you have no sin why because at
[1:02:04] Calvary it was finished amen there's a
[1:02:07] Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:11] you have no sin you are perfectly
[1:02:14] sinless no matter what you done or what
[1:02:17] you do you're still sinless as long as
[1:02:22] you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:02:24] savior your sin are forgiven and
[1:02:28] anything that is Forgiven is remitted
[1:02:31] and forgot about now think of that now
[1:02:33] we can remember what we've done we can
[1:02:35] remember our mistakes amen and Satan is
[1:02:38] good uh uh to remind us of our sins but
[1:02:42] you can't remind God of them if your
[1:02:44] sins are under the blood and they've
[1:02:47] been confessed unto the father amen now
[1:02:50] I understand we were once Sinners and
[1:02:52] and yes we come to the altar wherever
[1:02:55] and we gave our our hearts to the Lord
[1:02:56] and we truly accepted Christ amen as our
[1:03:00] savior as our sacrifice and and and
[1:03:03] these things amen and God filled us with
[1:03:06] his spirit amen and do you realize
[1:03:08] you'll never be a sinner again amen you
[1:03:11] can't be a s God would never look at you
[1:03:14] as a sinner again because he looks at
[1:03:17] the blood that is covering you yes you
[1:03:20] may fall and yes we have to repent and
[1:03:23] say God I'm sorry but you don't come to
[1:03:25] him as a sinner you come to him as a son
[1:03:28] and daughter of
[1:03:30] God ain't that right amen see and so
[1:03:35] Christianity see is based uh uh uh not
[1:03:39] on the future and it's not based upon
[1:03:42] the present but it's it's based upon
[1:03:45] what has been done not based upon what's
[1:03:48] going to be done but based upon what has
[1:03:51] been done ain't that right see so so
[1:03:54] many times we think God has got to do
[1:03:57] something uh uh be before you know uh
[1:04:00] anything happens but that's not true and
[1:04:03] and most of us know these things and so
[1:04:06] uh but you bear with me but Romans 8:28
[1:04:09] it says and we know that all things work
[1:04:11] together for good to them that love God
[1:04:15] to them who are the called according to
[1:04:18] his purpose not the purpose of the
[1:04:20] church not the purpose of mom and dad or
[1:04:22] the preacher but according to God's
[1:04:24] purpose for whom he did
[1:04:27] Forno he he also did predestinate past
[1:04:31] tense to be conformed to the image of
[1:04:34] his son that he might be the firstborn
[1:04:37] among many Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:04:40] predestinate them he also called and
[1:04:43] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:04:45] and whom he justified them he also
[1:04:48] glorified ain't that right so think of
[1:04:50] it God fornew us he called us he
[1:04:54] predestinated us he justified us and he
[1:04:58] already glorified us amen and and and
[1:05:02] this was uh uh before we were ever born
[1:05:05] ain't that right now notice and I've got
[1:05:08] some scriptures but Isaiah 55 and10 God
[1:05:11] says for as the rain cometh down and the
[1:05:14] snow from heaven and returneth not
[1:05:16] thither but WTH the Earth and make it it
[1:05:19] bring forth and Bud that it may give
[1:05:22] seed to the seow and bread to the eater
[1:05:24] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:05:29] of my mouth it shall not somebody say it
[1:05:32] shall not it shall not return unto me
[1:05:36] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:05:40] I please and it shall prosper in the
[1:05:43] thing whero I sent it ain't that right
[1:05:46] so God's word is going to prosper God's
[1:05:49] word is going to be accomplished ain't
[1:05:51] that right Amen in in Matthew 243 5
[1:05:56] Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:05:58] away but my word shall never amen shall
[1:06:01] not pass away ain't that right see so
[1:06:05] God forew us which means that we were in
[1:06:08] his thinking amen at the beginning
[1:06:11] before the foundation of the world we
[1:06:13] were in his thinking and by his word he
[1:06:18] predestinated us aren't you glad God
[1:06:21] thought of you now we have thoughts amen
[1:06:24] and and some sometimes they they're just
[1:06:26] a thought and we think well why did I
[1:06:28] think that or man you know and and then
[1:06:30] it's what you know what was I thinking
[1:06:32] about you know it's just a passing
[1:06:34] thought it could be a sudden thought it
[1:06:36] it surprises us with these thoughts
[1:06:38] sometimes but God's thinking God had a
[1:06:41] thought and their Eternal thoughts for
[1:06:45] God himself is eternal so if God is
[1:06:49] eternal then his love for us is eternal
[1:06:53] God God doesn't love you today and then
[1:06:55] hate you tomor right he he always loves
[1:06:57] you he's an eternal God so there's
[1:07:00] nothing about him that can that that can
[1:07:02] pass away there's nothing about him that
[1:07:05] can be here today and gone tomorrow amen
[1:07:08] if he loved you today he loves you
[1:07:10] tomorrow if he loves you tomorrow amen
[1:07:13] he'll love you forever now you're the
[1:07:15] one and I'm the one that feels good some
[1:07:18] days and we have our bad days we we make
[1:07:20] mistakes and and we do all of these
[1:07:22] things but God's love never
[1:07:26] fails it remains because and it's
[1:07:29] eternal love well then if if his eternal
[1:07:33] if his love is eternal his Joy is
[1:07:35] eternal well then what about his
[1:07:37] thoughts God's thoughts are Eternal
[1:07:40] they're not thoughts that just come
[1:07:42] through his mind and just pass away and
[1:07:44] or he don't remember what he was
[1:07:46] thinking about you know they're Eternal
[1:07:48] thoughts so God fornew Us in his mind
[1:07:53] and by his word he predes destinated Us
[1:07:56] by his word he called us by his word
[1:08:00] which is an eternal word because it come
[1:08:02] from an eternal God ain't that right by
[1:08:06] his word he justified Us by his word he
[1:08:10] glorified us and that word will not pass
[1:08:14] away but it will accomplish that what he
[1:08:17] sent it to do and it shall prosper this
[1:08:20] is why in Jeremiah
[1:08:23] 2911 God speaks through the Prophet
[1:08:25] saying for I know the thoughts that I
[1:08:28] think toward thee toward you sayith the
[1:08:31] Lord thoughts of Peace ain't that right
[1:08:34] so when God thought their thoughts of
[1:08:36] Peace toward us not of evil to give you
[1:08:41] an expected end ain't that right so our
[1:08:45] our end isn't something that we just
[1:08:47] wondering where are we going to end up
[1:08:48] at and no it's an expected end because
[1:08:52] God gave us an expected end ain't that
[1:08:55] right right I know we go through
[1:08:56] troubles and I know we go through hard
[1:08:58] times and I know we have our ups and
[1:08:59] downs but in through it all we've got an
[1:09:02] expected end that God has given to
[1:09:06] us yes sir amen job
[1:09:10] 23:13 it says but he God is uh in one
[1:09:14] mind and who can turn him and what his
[1:09:18] soul desireth even that he doeth for he
[1:09:21] performeth the thing that is appointed
[1:09:24] for me
[1:09:25] aren't you glad for that God Amen
[1:09:28] appointed the thing that is a uh
[1:09:30] performeth the thing that he has
[1:09:32] appointed for me amen and there's
[1:09:35] nothing that can turn him from it now
[1:09:37] see we tend to bring God down to our
[1:09:39] level amen and that's just common amen
[1:09:43] uh uh we think well if we can't do it
[1:09:45] then God can't do it if we if if we fail
[1:09:48] God fails if if uh you know if if if
[1:09:52] we're infinite well then God must be
[1:09:54] infinite if we're helpless then God is
[1:09:56] helpless if we don't know the future
[1:09:58] well then God doesn't know the future
[1:10:00] and if things are out of our hands then
[1:10:03] then then then it just it it must be out
[1:10:05] of God's hands and it just looks like
[1:10:07] everything is is just going crazy and
[1:10:10] not only the world going crazy but it
[1:10:12] seems like sometimes our own lives are
[1:10:15] going crazy and the things we're going
[1:10:17] through is just out of control but that
[1:10:19] ain't with God we can never put God and
[1:10:22] make God like we are amen that's true
[1:10:26] see amen you see God doesn't have to
[1:10:30] wait to see what happens like we do amen
[1:10:33] sometime before we plan things we have
[1:10:36] to wait and to see you know if we want
[1:10:38] to go on vacation maybe we have to wait
[1:10:40] to see if the money comes in or make
[1:10:43] sure to see if the car doesn't break
[1:10:45] down and and to see where we're at and
[1:10:47] see if something unexpected or maybe we
[1:10:50] do plan for vacations and or plan to do
[1:10:53] something and then something unexpected
[1:10:54] comes up and we have to cancel the plans
[1:10:58] and and all of these things but God
[1:11:00] never has to cancel one thing he doesn't
[1:11:03] have to wait to see what you will do he
[1:11:05] doesn't have to wait to see what the
[1:11:07] economy will do he doesn't have to wait
[1:11:09] to see what the politicians will do amen
[1:11:12] he just plans it and it's going to
[1:11:15] happen just that way amen that's why he
[1:11:18] could predestinate you that's why he
[1:11:21] could he could already justify us and
[1:11:24] glorify us and call us because he's God
[1:11:29] can you say amen he doesn't have to wait
[1:11:31] amen before he acts amen see in Isaiah
[1:11:35] 55 and9 God says for as the heavens are
[1:11:39] higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:11:42] than your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:11:45] thoughts so God does have thoughts don't
[1:11:48] he and he says my thoughts are higher
[1:11:50] than your thoughts amen because our
[1:11:52] thoughts are temporal amen we can change
[1:11:54] our mind in a heartbeat we can we can
[1:11:56] say well I'm going to do this you know
[1:11:58] and then tomorrow totally change and and
[1:12:00] we have to change maybe be our our
[1:12:02] thoughts and and plans because of the
[1:12:04] situations but God's thoughts are
[1:12:06] Eternal and they will never change
[1:12:08] because he can't change his thoughts are
[1:12:11] perfect because he is perfect God
[1:12:14] doesn't think unperfect
[1:12:17] thoughts the Bible says his ways are
[1:12:20] perfect can you say Amen so God isn't
[1:12:23] like us amen now think of it Isaiah 4017
[1:12:27] it says all nations are before him as
[1:12:30] nothing see and they are counted to him
[1:12:33] less than nothing and vanity so to whom
[1:12:36] then will you liken God or what likeness
[1:12:39] will you compare unto him see we are a
[1:12:43] creation but God's not a creation he's
[1:12:46] self-existent he's always existent that
[1:12:50] he didn't need something outside of him
[1:12:52] to help him amen and to bring him into
[1:12:56] existence he's Eternal he's the only one
[1:12:59] that's
[1:13:01] Eternal eternal's never had a beginning
[1:13:03] and it's never had an ending ain't that
[1:13:06] right so God has always been amen he is
[1:13:10] Sovereign He Reigns on the throne ain't
[1:13:13] that right so he is in need of no one
[1:13:15] and can be hindered by no one amen
[1:13:19] Daniel 4:35 it says all the inhabitants
[1:13:22] of the Earth are reputed as nothing and
[1:13:25] and he doeth according to his will in
[1:13:28] the army of heaven and among the
[1:13:30] inhabitants of the earth and none
[1:13:32] everybody say none can stay his hand or
[1:13:36] say unto him what doest thou ain't that
[1:13:39] right see so God is above us amen God is
[1:13:43] so far Supreme higher than us in our
[1:13:46] ways and and and all of these things he
[1:13:48] doesn't have to get permission to act he
[1:13:51] just acts out of his own good counsel he
[1:13:55] wasn't forced to save you he saved you
[1:13:57] because he loved you ain't that right
[1:14:01] amen see and so Proverbs
[1:14:05] 19:21 there are many devices in a man's
[1:14:07] heart nevertheless the counsel of the
[1:14:10] Lord that shall stand so no matter what
[1:14:13] man decides to do amen it's the counsel
[1:14:16] of the Lord that shall stand ain't that
[1:14:19] right Isaiah 46 and9 remember the former
[1:14:23] things of old for I am God and there is
[1:14:25] none else I'm God and there is none like
[1:14:29] me declaring the end from the
[1:14:33] beginning so this is God declaring the
[1:14:37] very end of time this age all the way
[1:14:41] through from the very
[1:14:44] beginning think of that and from ancient
[1:14:47] times the things that are not yet done
[1:14:50] saying my counsel shall stand and I will
[1:14:54] do all my pleasure well aren't you glad
[1:14:57] for that so then if God had a plan for
[1:15:00] us there's nothing that can change God's
[1:15:04] mind there's nothing that can detour
[1:15:07] God's God's mind amen for he says my
[1:15:11] counsel shall stand and I will do all of
[1:15:14] my pleasure can you say Amen so God is
[1:15:18] Not constantly coming up with a plan as
[1:15:21] we go amen through life and maybe we
[1:15:24] were born and God looks at our you know
[1:15:27] at us at Birth and says ooh you know I I
[1:15:30] didn't realize how ugly he was going to
[1:15:32] be and and and W he just he he I don't
[1:15:36] know if he'll ever make it I better
[1:15:37] change my plan about him well God
[1:15:40] doesn't do them things right amen now we
[1:15:42] might be considered accidents by our
[1:15:44] parents amen but to God we're never an
[1:15:47] accident God knew we were
[1:15:50] coming and therefore he had planned for
[1:15:54] us ain't that right so he's not
[1:15:56] constantly coming up with a plan or
[1:15:59] revising his plan I I don't know maybe
[1:16:02] some of us so God you know I'm sure
[1:16:04] maybe all of us at one point say God I
[1:16:06] just can't make it you know I just don't
[1:16:08] know if I can go another day and I just
[1:16:10] don't know what what's going to happen
[1:16:12] and all that and so God's looking at us
[1:16:14] and he's just kind of getting
[1:16:15] discouraged by our by our grumbling and
[1:16:18] and us you know and he's like well you
[1:16:19] know you might be right about that one I
[1:16:21] better revise this thing you know no
[1:16:24] God's plan is for sure ain't that right
[1:16:28] see so he finished his plan before the
[1:16:32] foundation of the world so not making up
[1:16:34] another plan or coming up with an
[1:16:36] addition to his plan the plan was
[1:16:39] finished before the foundation of the
[1:16:41] world and he declared the end from the
[1:16:46] beginning aren't you glad for that as we
[1:16:49] know it all started out as a thought
[1:16:52] first of all God's thoughts amen they're
[1:16:55] Eternal they're real and a word then it
[1:16:58] become expressed into a Word by speaking
[1:17:02] it see see a word is a thought expressed
[1:17:06] ain't that right now what was in God's
[1:17:10] mind and what he declared is now being
[1:17:14] manifested coming into materialization
[1:17:18] ain't that right so we we find that God
[1:17:21] isn't like us he doesn't work like us he
[1:17:24] does you know all these things that now
[1:17:27] God acts God works based of what he
[1:17:31] knows he knows to be true ain't that
[1:17:35] right he doesn't check about us and say
[1:17:37] what do you think about it no no uh uh
[1:17:40] uh he knows what is true therefore he
[1:17:44] works
[1:17:45] accordingly ain't that right now I want
[1:17:47] to say this he knows that you're going
[1:17:50] to make
[1:17:52] it ain't that right see he called you
[1:17:56] from the beginning he he he uh uh
[1:18:00] predestinated you from the beginning he
[1:18:03] justified you and glorified you from the
[1:18:06] beginning ain't that right now in God's
[1:18:09] mind that is
[1:18:11] true you may have been born a sinner but
[1:18:14] in God's mind he's already called you
[1:18:17] Justified you predestinated you
[1:18:20] glorified you and to God that's more
[1:18:23] true than what you are
[1:18:27] here can you say Amen what God called
[1:18:30] you to be is more true than your
[1:18:32] sins and your failures and you say well
[1:18:36] I've got complexes what God has called
[1:18:39] you to be is more true and more real
[1:18:42] than even your
[1:18:44] complexes now think of that so God works
[1:18:48] based off what he knows Amen to be true
[1:18:52] he didn't save you hoping that you will
[1:18:54] make it to Heaven he he didn't call you
[1:18:57] hoping that you you would you would do
[1:18:59] good for him no no see he knows you're
[1:19:02] going to make it now watch 2 Timothy
[1:19:05] 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:19:09] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:19:13] knoweth them that are his aren't you
[1:19:16] glad he knows you amen you might be
[1:19:19] getting get lost in a crowd somewhere
[1:19:21] but God still knows who you are there is
[1:19:23] no sin that can hide from hide you from
[1:19:26] him amen that Satan couldn't Mar you and
[1:19:30] disfigure you and Scar you enough to
[1:19:34] make God not remember you the Lord knows
[1:19:37] you and he knows you by name amen and
[1:19:41] his plan he formulated a plan just for
[1:19:45] you brother Matthew amen just for us so
[1:19:49] he does not go into panic mode when you
[1:19:52] make a mistake he isn't there just
[1:19:55] waiting to pour out his judgment amen
[1:19:57] every time you fall amen and you get
[1:20:00] discouraged or or whatever he's actually
[1:20:03] under great expectation for you to make
[1:20:05] it amen he's already got an expected end
[1:20:09] amen and no devil in hell is going to
[1:20:11] stop that I don't care how discouraged
[1:20:14] you get I don't care how hard the battle
[1:20:16] gets sometimes there ain't nothing going
[1:20:18] to stop what God has already planned for
[1:20:21] you so God is under great expectation
[1:20:24] for you to make
[1:20:28] it amen it's like an expected
[1:20:32] mother amen she knows that the child's
[1:20:36] coming and so she's
[1:20:38] expecting and she has been given you
[1:20:41] know a date certain around a certain
[1:20:44] time the baby's
[1:20:45] coming and they start
[1:20:47] planning they start making ready am they
[1:20:51] start getting a baby bed they start you
[1:20:53] know buying some diapers they start
[1:20:55] having these baby
[1:20:57] showers and you know they they start
[1:21:00] making preparation that way when the
[1:21:03] baby does arrive they're ready for it
[1:21:06] ain't that right we we all know what it
[1:21:09] is amen when you're expecting company to
[1:21:12] come then then we start making plans for
[1:21:15] it clean the house and we do this get
[1:21:17] everything ready amen for for the
[1:21:21] arrival of the company because we've
[1:21:23] come under expectation for their arrival
[1:21:26] ain't that right amen now sometimes you
[1:21:29] know the company doesn't show up you
[1:21:32] know and and all that work that we done
[1:21:34] you know well it it probably needed amen
[1:21:37] but uh uh uh you know maybe we're
[1:21:41] disappointed that they weren't able to
[1:21:42] come or or whatever but notice what
[1:21:45] Jesus says in John 14 and 2 in my
[1:21:49] father's house are many mansions ain't
[1:21:52] that right Amen in my father 's Kingdom
[1:21:55] in other words amen are are many houses
[1:21:59] amen if it were not so I would have told
[1:22:02] you I go to prepare a place for
[1:22:06] you hallu ain't that right I go to
[1:22:10] prepare a place for you now he knows
[1:22:13] he's the sacrifice he knows the work of
[1:22:16] Calvary what it's going to do amen
[1:22:20] everything that God has planned amen
[1:22:23] will be at Cal C to redeem you back to
[1:22:26] him to make you Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:29] God to free you from the devil and his
[1:22:32] powers and now he says here's what I'm
[1:22:35] going to do I'm going to prepare a place
[1:22:36] for you I'm going ahead Amen in the
[1:22:40] future in future tents preparing a place
[1:22:43] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[1:22:46] for you I will come again and receive
[1:22:48] you unto myself that where I am you may
[1:22:52] be there also can you sayen
[1:22:55] see so he's under expectation amen now
[1:22:58] now Church he's not just preparing and
[1:23:01] then just hoping keeping the fingers
[1:23:03] crossed rubbing the rabbit's foot amen
[1:23:05] hoping that you're going to make it now
[1:23:07] you think of this you know let's just
[1:23:09] say you know he's got the the table
[1:23:11] spread out and he's got the place and he
[1:23:13] knows every every place every the got
[1:23:16] the seat got the place where you're
[1:23:18] going to be brother Bill and and and and
[1:23:21] now everything's ready and he's looking
[1:23:23] at down there at us and he sees you
[1:23:25] going through some hard times say I
[1:23:27] don't know you know we might ought to we
[1:23:29] might ought to scratch that table you
[1:23:31] know or get pull that chair out because
[1:23:33] I just don't know brother Bill going to
[1:23:34] make it no see that's not the way God
[1:23:37] works and and I tell you that's not the
[1:23:39] way we should work as well Amen to where
[1:23:42] I know we get discouraged I know we go
[1:23:44] through hard times I know there's times
[1:23:47] amen that that we go through things and
[1:23:48] we wonder or it just seem like we just
[1:23:51] can't take it another day but we must
[1:23:53] rest in in that finished
[1:23:57] work can you say amen amen he's prepared
[1:24:02] see he's prepared and this is what
[1:24:04] Calvary was all about amen God shed his
[1:24:07] blood I know that's simple but it's deep
[1:24:10] God shed his blood for you and I amen as
[1:24:15] as we know we weren't saved by Jewish
[1:24:17] blood nor were we saved by Gentile blood
[1:24:21] we were saved by God's blood
[1:24:25] amen Acts 20 and 28 take heed therefore
[1:24:28] unto yourselves and unto all the flock
[1:24:30] over which the Holy Ghost ha made you
[1:24:32] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:24:35] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:24:37] blood ain't that right see Hebrews 13:12
[1:24:41] wherefore Jesus also that he might
[1:24:43] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:24:47] amen suffered without the gate
[1:24:49] Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus Christ
[1:24:52] who is the faithful Witness and the
[1:24:54] first begotten of the dead and the
[1:24:56] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:24:59] him that loved us and washed us amen
[1:25:03] from our sins in his own blood he's not
[1:25:08] loosening that except what he has done
[1:25:11] for us amen that's right you were
[1:25:15] pardoned at Calvary Amen brother Bram
[1:25:18] said every person in the world was
[1:25:20] forgiven of their sins when Jesus died
[1:25:22] at Calvary but never do you any good un
[1:25:25] L you accept it now I know that's the
[1:25:28] that's the hard thing is to accept it
[1:25:31] cuz we look at our failures we look how
[1:25:33] unworthy we are we look at our
[1:25:35] insufficiencies and we look at
[1:25:37] everything about us and we think well
[1:25:39] how in the world could he love us how
[1:25:41] how can I accept accept something when I
[1:25:44] know I'm
[1:25:47] guilty ain't that
[1:25:49] right but it says the blood of Calvary
[1:25:53] the work of calvary will not do you any
[1:25:55] good unless you accept
[1:25:58] it he said he's the Lamb of God that
[1:26:00] take away the sin of the world it is
[1:26:02] finished he said it at Calvary he was
[1:26:05] wounded past tense wounded for our
[1:26:07] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[1:26:10] and chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:26:12] him and with his stripes we were healed
[1:26:16] it's already done can you say it it's
[1:26:18] already done it's already done and in
[1:26:22] the sight of God it's all over
[1:26:27] amen so now we just accept the dividends
[1:26:31] when we accept his pardon can you
[1:26:35] sayen remember a pardon is not a pardon
[1:26:40] unless received as a
[1:26:42] pardon so then as long as we look back
[1:26:46] to what we
[1:26:47] was as long as we look to ourselves and
[1:26:51] our failures and our mistakes and our
[1:26:54] our insufficiencies and if we look to us
[1:26:58] then the sacrifice of Calvary means
[1:27:02] nothing
[1:27:04] hello if if Christianity is based upon
[1:27:07] what we do then the works of Calvary was
[1:27:11] meant
[1:27:12] nothing oh my that's why we can't look
[1:27:16] to us that's why we can't look to
[1:27:18] ourselves amen the prophet said don't
[1:27:20] look at yourself look at your lamb can
[1:27:23] you say Amen don't look at yourself look
[1:27:25] at your lamb God doesn't accept
[1:27:30] you but he accepts your
[1:27:32] lamb he accepts the lamb he accepts your
[1:27:36] sacrifice and the thing is there was no
[1:27:38] sacrifice good enough to make us into
[1:27:41] reconciliation to God so God had to be
[1:27:44] our
[1:27:46] sacrifice can you say Amen it's the only
[1:27:49] way that we could be redeemed is he made
[1:27:51] a sacrifice and if God looks at at our
[1:27:54] sacrifice or looks at that sacrifice and
[1:27:57] says that's good enough then we must
[1:27:59] look at that sacrifice and say it's good
[1:28:01] enough if it's good enough to God it's
[1:28:04] got to be good enough for us can you say
[1:28:06] amen and if our healing comes from that
[1:28:09] sacrifice and God heals us based upon
[1:28:12] that sacrifice then we must accept our
[1:28:14] healing based upon that sacrifice we
[1:28:17] base our accept our Salvation based upon
[1:28:20] that sacrifice God accepts our
[1:28:23] repentance and God accepts that amen
[1:28:26] based upon the sacrifice and we must
[1:28:29] base his grace or accept his grace based
[1:28:32] upon the sacrifice you have to believe
[1:28:36] that your sacrifice is good
[1:28:40] enough God came up with a sacrifice that
[1:28:43] was good enough for him he became the
[1:28:46] sacrifice amen and it must be good
[1:28:49] enough for
[1:28:50] us it is finished
[1:28:54] aren't you glad for that can you just
[1:28:57] lift your hands unto the Lord and thank
[1:28:59] him that's why we have a
[1:29:02] hope that's why we have a bright
[1:29:05] future that's why we're not down in the
[1:29:09] dumps that's why we can come to church
[1:29:11] and worship him and love him and express
[1:29:15] our love he expressed our his Love To Us
[1:29:18] by bringing a
[1:29:19] sacrifice and it is finished Lord
[1:29:23] hallelujah
[1:29:24] hallelujah amen you see brother Braham
[1:29:28] said the world may say oh you're a bunch
[1:29:30] of Holy Rollers you're not this and
[1:29:33] you've done this and he said but I don't
[1:29:35] care what you done by Grace by God's
[1:29:39] Promise by the Holy Ghost not what you
[1:29:42] are it's what your sacrifice
[1:29:46] is don't look at your Sac uh yourself
[1:29:49] look at your sacrifice for God don't
[1:29:52] look at you
[1:29:55] think of it now God had to have
[1:29:57] something to look to to stay his
[1:30:01] wrath if he looked at us through all of
[1:30:04] our blunders and all of that how can a
[1:30:06] holy God put up with an Unholy
[1:30:08] people how how how through all our ups
[1:30:11] and downs and our backslidings and
[1:30:13] everything that we go through how can
[1:30:16] God look at
[1:30:18] us amen and and not judge
[1:30:21] us so he presents he brought forth a
[1:30:24] sacrifice that he can look at don't look
[1:30:28] at
[1:30:29] youself look at your sacrifice God don't
[1:30:33] look at you he looks at your sacrifice
[1:30:36] which is Christ can you say amen amen
[1:30:39] don't look at yourself I'm not worthy
[1:30:41] you're not worthy nobody's worthy but
[1:30:43] he's the one that's worthy I'm not
[1:30:45] counting on what I've done and what I am
[1:30:48] he said I'd never make it but I'm
[1:30:50] looking to what he done and there's
[1:30:52] where I'm trusting what he done He's My
[1:30:55] Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no
[1:30:58] sir Lord ought to have died long long
[1:31:00] ago see ought to have never been born
[1:31:03] but I live because I've got eternal life
[1:31:05] I'm going to heaven why because he done
[1:31:08] it for me he was the one he took my
[1:31:11] place he said I was a knock kned
[1:31:14] crosseyed in every kind of a condition
[1:31:16] but he took my place spiritually
[1:31:19] speaking see I was all twisted up all
[1:31:22] messed up but he took my place so he
[1:31:24] makes me a perfect Son of God a and a
[1:31:28] perfect daughter of God that's what we
[1:31:30] are amen not when we get to heaven we
[1:31:33] are now sons of

[1:32:01] good preachers we can be good musicians
[1:32:04] we can go to church Faithfully we can do
[1:32:06] it all but don't trust in that amen I

[1:32:20] finished I don't have to worry about it
[1:32:22] no more now I can rest in the works of
[1:32:26] Calvary and my future is bright can you

[1:32:35] Rapture which is soon amen not going
