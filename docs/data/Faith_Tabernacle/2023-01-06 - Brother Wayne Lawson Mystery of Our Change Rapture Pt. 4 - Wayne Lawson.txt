something to thank God about isn't it amen Amanda for a meeting like that amen I I don't want to miss that meeting amen they can hold it as late as they want to amen I just want to be a part of it and I want to raise my hand and be counted in for that supper just after that meeting amen I know it'd probably be pizza tonight but but I don't I don't know what we're gonna have in that supper up there and I really don't even care I just want to be there hey man that's that's what I'm hoping for and I want to say God bless you and they got too many friends visiting life start naming names so y'all forgive me for that but I wanted to say God bless you and certainly good to have everybody here and amen the spirit of grace and mercy that's been Among Us I I think the Rapture is going to be like this you know when the meeting in the Air Bud Brown said we'll all get together and see one another just a little bit before we meet him he said so we'll get all that out of the way so he'll be the main attraction amen I I think that what a wonderful time that we're talking about tonight and I've been three nights on the Rapture and if it's okay with you I'm just going to go ahead and continue tonight on that and and uh and uh and like I I spoke to the last night there'll be a couple things here I'm I'm sure that's going to be very familiar to you because the revelation of the Rapture hadn't changed since the last time you heard it preached on but uh but we're going to uh we're going to try to to labor into a few of these areas and if you find a spot there that's uh that's real familiar to you and it's just good old-fashioned home cooking you can holler out amen and and pass the potatoes and and what and we'll just enjoy ourselves tonight amen God bless you and tonight we're going to go into the Bible in the book of Philippians the third chapter and the 20th verse I want to bring you greetings from the church at home true word Tabernacle and brother Erickson and amen and uh his sister Chris is not with us tonight but uh greetings from her and amen she's been uh she's been there at home you know we just had another grandbaby and and she she felt a real pool to be up there throughout the week here and uh she's she they're still adjusting amen it's Mariah's first when she's actually had the flu this week so Grandma being at home was a really good thing amen and so we just want to take a few minutes tonight in the scripture I'm going to look in Philippians chapter 3 and verse 20. and verse 21 and also First Corinthians 15 51. let's read Philippians chapter 3 for our conversation is in heaven for once also we look for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it be fashioned like it unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself and I like this one in First Corinthians 15 51 behold I show you a mystery and we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen let's bow our hearts father we thank you tonight for your word and Lord It's a real humbling experience to stand before your children and Lord to speak to the people that I believe this scripture is talking about sacred thing Lord to know that there are human beings that have been born into this age it lowered their purpose and the desire of their life was set by you for this great change and Lord it may be just one in a million Lord I but it just makes it so much more real to me that there are people that's going to experience this and I always wonder what it was like maybe for someone to talk to Mary just before she had the child that Lord I'm talking to another church Lord just before their change and I ask you now that you would help me that you would lead me through your word and father there'd be nothing here but you and your spirit you'd lead me to every word of it father and you'd help me tonight to yield that what you've put in me Lord to you and to serve your people Lord if it'd be one thing that would be said that would be harmful or be said in the wrong way God I pray you'd stop it before it came out but Lord that which you once spoken I pray you'd make us bold as a lion with it father and that there would be no hindrance to it oh God we ask you for your mercy now we pray in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you as you can be seated tonight I want to speak to you a little bit and I'm going to take a subtopic tonight on the mystery of our change but there's a there's a there's a lot in here of course and so we'll just we'll probably not try to preach to you all night so what I'm going to do is I'm going to preach a while then I'm just going to quit because there's gonna be no finish in this one uh I've got too much I'd have to stay the other two days and and we got to be home so uh but but I just gonna ask God for some mercy here to get the points into our hearts amen I I do want to say that I appreciate uh men of God that stand on this message and that not just uh stand on the message but stand with balance on the message because we're in a c reason when the spirit of error has took a hold of the word and it uses the word by error to lead people into error and and it and as brother Branham said many times he talked about a good paper somebody had and he said I read the paper the other day he said they put together and he said he said it was the word of God they put together he said but they just put it together intellectually he said so it didn't come out like what the word what the word would do so what we're Desiring is not just to have an intellectual putting together of the scripture that leads us in the wrong direction but we want the revelation of the word to take a hold that God by the spirit of Truth would lead us into the places that it would desires to go now we know where we're going and we know what to expect because we've had a prophet a prophetic word has told us where we're going so you know you know as the scripture tells us that if you're going to give a prophecy a prophecy must be judged before it's give to the church but a Vindicated Prophet is already spell already Vindicated to speak openly before the church and when he prophesied something you don't have to measure that or judge it you don't have to question it it's just the way it is amen it's a it's a Vindicated word of God and and we have received a Vindicated word and and and we're asking ourselves what is to come what's what's coming next what is coming to the church what are we to expect and I know uh coming from this area and I know up in different areas I know there's been a lot of ideas about what the church was going to experience before the Rapture and what what kind of uh what kind of great tragedies we were going to have to experience in things and you all forgive me but I'm just not one of those preachers that believe a lot of things are going to be coming other than the change of the body now I think I'm justified in my belief amen the prophet of God said was asked the question will the bride go through the persecution as the early Apostolic Church did and he said no I just explained this the next thing is a Rapture amen we're at a Promised Land we're at the border Amen in questions and answer he said now this is my thoughts ministering brother but in my own way I feel the holy spirit is revealed to me the next thing that is to happen to the Gentile elected bride is to be caught up with the rest of the Gentile elected bride it's been down through the age so if you're asking a prophet what is coming next he said the Rapture is coming next the change of our body so if you're uh if you're maybe looking for a lot of persecutions and you're looking for a lot of tribulation I mean I'm sure that you could find some quotes to line up with that thought and you could maybe get some scripture that you could make it say that if you wanted to but if you really want to follow what a prophet taught in 1964 in Ephesians the trumpets he changed he changed the way he viewed that and he moved from there coming to persecution upon the church because he was seeing it in the trumpets and he kept saying that the trumpets held it but then in 1964 he preached his Feast of the trumpets and he was going to hold a whole series of meetings on Feast of the trumpets and then he comes to the church and said he wouldn't let me preach on it and I asked him why can't I preach on the Feast of trumpets he said because you've already preached it spiritually in the seals because the seals is the trumpets to the Gentile and the natural trumpet sound to the Jews so whatever the trumpets are going to do for the Jew the Seal's done it for the bride of Christ so whatever you were thinking we needed to get into the Rapture the seals was going to produce it because it would be Revelation that would bring the true desperation of the church I'm on that I'm a Bible reader and when Daniel saw the end coming near that's when he got in contact with the angel because he understood by the books it was the time of the their Deliverance amen and I find out amen that God would send a message to to bring us to that point now I believe that God does things and he has an order that he does them when you're reading the Bible and you see just before Abraham's change amen God appeared to Abraham in the flesh and discerned it that was the sign that things were about to change and brother bam said not one thing what not one thing did he promised Abraham one thing did he do to Abraham but what he's done or give to the church except the change of the body so what God is owing the church is the change of the body amen we've already got the message folks we've already got the word of the lord we have got the inspiration that gathers the bribe what we are looking for tonight is the change of the body that's exactly where we are that is the season that we're living in that is the expectation of the church it's the changing of our body we're looking at any moment in any situation something is going to happen that's going to be a change I'm not looking for them to lock me up somewhere and to beat me up and make me get into a place that I could get desperate that's not really what I'm looking for I am I am body in the twinkling of an eye the next thing that is to come is the rapture of the church the change of the body of the sleeping Saints brother random says it there's nothing I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus out of the side of the Readiness of the church let me say this and anyone can prove it wrong he said wouldn't all these Visions no one can prove it wrong these all these Visions were they not all fulfilled each one has been fulfilled or is in the process right now amen where are we in this abrahamic age we're living he said we are in a great time the great hour we're living in all the Visions have been fulfilled Feast of the trumpets it's a mystery revealed in this day the son of man to the evening message that the last sign was to be seen that discernment before the change of the body the discernment before the change of the body now somebody asked me one time what I thought about all the blood moons and sometimes uh some of the ministers were preaching on the blood moons and that was a big deal somebody called me and said brother Wayne what do you think about these blood moons are you keeping up with it I said well somebody's a good book salesman's all I can tell you amen because if they can't even figure out that Malachi 4 is Elijah is William Branham I'm not going to depend on them for end time signs they miss the biggest and greatest sign that there is I'm not going to be asking them about the other signs when they have missed the sign and Church of the Living God we're not looking for signs we have received the sign of the change of the body somebody said well how do you know what ahead because I sing the sign I've seen the last sign to the church amen God has given us everything that we need for the change of our body amen right now Russia is in a place it's ready to bomb America does anybody realize where we are with Russia you go back to the 1960s and you look at the you look at the uh you look at the the other Cuban Missile Crisis do you know that the scientists and the politics and the Army is saying we're closer right now to nuclear war than we were in the Cuban Missile Crisis days we are right back where we were when a prophet left the scene we have re-entered the rest like somebody pushed a pause button and now they've took their finger off of the pause button and let me tell you this amen there's there's something there that this America is under judgment since 1956 amen we don't need another Prophet to rise up and say judgment's owner we don't need another day of prayer she's already rejected her day of Grace amen and she is seeking to the bottom of the ocean some morning amen but the power of it is is the prophet of God said listen but we've got to shelter the name of the Lord is a mighty tower and the righteous went into it and are saved no matter how many bombs or anything else we are saved so the world and the sinner they don't have a shelter they don't have a safety place it's a shaking time if I wasn't a Christian I'd go crazy to thinking of what might happen at any time with a house full of little kitties I wouldn't know what to do but I'm so glad that I got a place to stand in my house and introduce them to a shelter that no bomb could ever touch or nothing else under the protecting wings of the Lord Jesus not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord that is eye protection tonight that is our protection tonight we said well bombs are about to drop what kind of shelter are we going to be we're going to build some kind of bomb shelter or something brother Adam says don't be scared no hydrogen bomb or nothing else as long as you got Christ in your heart that is the best bomb shelter I know of and it's made out of filters feathers under his wings we will abide so don't worry about these things if you're a Christian Old Church of the Living God if you're a Christian you don't need no pills tonight you don't need a psychologist to calm you down tonight if you're a Christian what you need to do is get under the Peace of the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a shelter of Our Lives that we might change in the moment in the twinkle of an eye amen I believe it's a powerful thing now now there's a lot of people has different directions on the message and I I can't help Which Way some other people go it really and I have to be real clear about this amen when I preach something it's not in a Prejudice to what someone else preaches it's just I don't allow because someone else preaches something different to keep me from preaching what I believe is truth do you see do you see that somebody said well he's against this guy he's against that guy no really I'm not see I've been preaching this message longer than some guys had been born and I've been preaching a lot longer than a lot of guys has been pastoring so sometimes a pastor will start pastoring then you're preaching a certain way and they say well he's talking about that guy don't get my takes 10 years ago or 15 years ago or 20 years ago and I was preaching the same thing before these people come on the scene but because they say something a certain way does it mean that I'm going to quit preaching the truth come on church amen we need to get out of that old spirit we need to get out of that old spirit because it's a binding Spirit where it's a it's a wrong mode of applied to the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're not preaching the gospel to argue with someone or or we're not preaching the gospel to say this guy's right and this guy's wrong this is for the bride so they can take a change of their body amen we need a release and of a freedom amen where our hearts return back to joy and peace and the glory of God I think these old binding Spirits we ought to open up the door and say devil you're dismissed tonight you can't got no right to bind the church you ain't got no right to bind the preacher I say let Liberty come in the house of God again let the power the power of the Holy Ghost flow in the church with anointing and we're truth amen you know what it used to be you could just break out and dance down the aisle and you didn't think nothing about it you can worship and have a wonderful time come on church amen I'll tell you what happened so little problems come up well you shouldn't have pushed back if you didn't want me to preach the problems come up and they come up and they come up and now you can't hear one preacher without he's talking about you you can't hear this preacher unless he's talking about that and that ain't nothing but an Old Devil to keep you from enjoying the house of God you know what you ought to do opposite it's not Old Devil amen trying to keep you from rejoicing you are the same to your feet say glory to God I gotta Liberty to praise God you want to do opposite of whatever that Devil's telling you that's why I do things that's what I do if a dog bites you you know what brother bam said the best medicine for the dog bite is the hair on the dog's back I'm a hillbilly sorry I understood that statement you know what he was saying he's saying you got a problem with somebody bake them a pie tell me you love them and if you think they got something well you just buy them something tell them I love you God bless you come on can we preach now look what he's saying he's saying the prophet is saying look now the hour that we're living we're surely at the end now the prophet could not this is the thing that if this this just amazes me at the at the level of character of this prophet that that he's a judgment Prophet putting judgment upon the Earth and he catches a revelation when they start talking about flying saucers or putting uh satellites in the heavens when they started doing that he takes it to the scripture and said signs in the heavens above and he starts talking about them putting the Russia putting that missile up there and satellite and he starts identifying that with an end-time judgment sign he said now look even judgments hanging in the heavens so he's showing you what is happening he wants to come home and he wants to preach a message amen he wants to preach a message on the handwriting on the wall they just got one sermon just got one sermon to preach that day he don't have a second service he said so I wouldn't preach that service because I didn't have a second service to preach another sermon now listen to him I wanted to preach handwriting on the wall he said but see I couldn't then leave the people in that condition without bringing another message to follow it and give a hope to the church it leaves the people wondering and makes them nervous so I thought next Sunday I'll speak on the handwriting on the wall on the morning and then Sunday night I'll speak on the church Rapture him before the tribulation now look at this he wouldn't even preach a judgment sermon without preaching a Rapture sermon he wouldn't preach judgment without a way of Escape amen he was a prophet of God look at the power of this amen as a prophet he could have said anything he wanted but he didn't want to leave The People Under he didn't want to leave it under it amen now but before that can take place then God called man 1958 brother bam said the Bible claims that Russian communism is playing right in the hands of God to absolutely rid the Earth of the people he said that before that can take place the Rapture comes and takes the church home that's right this takes place before tribulation God according to scripture he said Noah went into the ark before it rained and he said a lot left Sodom before the fire fell he said and God will have the church leave before tribulation Falls now I think that ought to be settled in every Christian heart in this building tonight amen God will let us leave before tribulation comes now now look if there ain't nothing else going on in your life that is shouting material that ought to get a stir on the inside of your heart and make you say thanks be to God that he's given me an escape in a time of judgment it's judgment we know but there there's an escape for the Bride of Jesus Christ and brother Branham says watch this when the Rapture takes place all the Believers will go of course even their children even the family's children this was always an amazement to me I've had more mothers ask me what will happen to my babies if I'm raptured you got young children you know and what will happen somebody actually got the nerve up in thy house and asked brother by them and said will my family go in the Rapture brother and said yes he said yes amen so so it's not something that we should have to worry about now now here's the thing tribulation of course is something that people go into but God does everything with purpose it's nothing without purpose before God and the six The Sixth Seal tribulation is a threefold purpose the number one purpose of that is that it would it would Purge the hundred and forty four thousand right and then it would Purge the foolish virgin and then it would Purge the Earth so there's three things the six he'll do and none of that has anything to do with a bride so somebody said well I think the bride goes through tribulation why does she go through it what would be the purpose of putting someone through the tribulation it's a purging time but the bride has already been purged by the blood of Jesus Christ of course amen there are people that need purging them that have denied the word they're not under the blood and they need a Persian but to the Bride of Jesus Christ she's went through the greatest purging that anyone could go through she's went through the blood of Jesus Christ I'll tell you there's nothing else that can Purge a man like the blood brother banham said I think it ought to be truly settled in every believer's heart that Christ never takes the tribulation period the church the bride never takes it you can't put her in the tribulation you put the church there but not the bride the bride's gone she has not won sin not one thing against her at all the grace of God has covered her and the bleach has took every sin so far away as not even a remembrance of sin not a thing of Purity perfect in the presence of God holy daughter make the bride get down on their knees and cry out to God Amen there is a tribulation but we won't be there because there ain't no need to go there amen our clothes are already cleaned in the cycle of the Rapture there's been a washing of the water of the word of God I tell you what you can't make a sinner out of her the bleach of the blood has cleansed her and if you wash somebody with a bleach of the blood there is nothing left of the former sin that's upon that person the bleach has took every sin so far away there's not even a remembrance that's hard for us to conceive isn't it not even a remembrance of it 129 amen paragraph 129 the first seal brother Brown said listen hey how can a man say the bride of Christ goes in the tribulation I don't understand it she's took away from the tribulation if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless now that's a that's that's something to release our hearts tonight folks perfectly totally sinless and look at what brother Adam said he says you say there's no such a person he said every born and again True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God Amen how many Believers I got in the house tonight and now come on don't you be bashful about this one if you're a Believer put your hand up real high amen because you know what you're saying I am absolutely perfectly sinless before almighty God I know you got a memory but God don't have it I know your sister's got a memory but God don't have it I know your brother's got a memory but God don't have it I think if God has washed our soul in the blood of the Lamb what about worship our mind in the blood and forgetting about our transgressions and the failures of our life and say God come and get me if you want to get me clean me and I'll go with you tonight amen I don't know about you but I'm tired of trying to work out my own ideas I'm trying to work out amen never he always trying to work somebody work something out if I do this I'll get there if I do this I'll get there the rapture definition is a kidnapping a seizure and catching away a taking a hold of listen this is God taking the bride this is not you running God down this is God cleaning the bride and taking her off of the face of the Earth [Applause] you're on God's kidnap list wherever you are he will not lose a one of them oh I know how it is Devil he's just kind of preaching but if I ask him I'd hate it too as he tries to keep everybody under condemnation amen everybody's under condemnation I tell you what we ought to tell that devil tonight take your condemnation and crawl back in the pit of Hell where you came out of as this bride is Rapture Ready this spot is Rapture anointed this ride is going to move in the moment in the twinkle of an eye Sims questions have already been answered oh that ain't nobody's sinless Brothers had ever proved every True Believer it's perfectly absolutely sinless before God how can you make him a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ between him and God that will scatter sin till there's nothing left of it brother I did have it but I put it through the blood it was there but I put it through the blood and the blood is like you try to put a hey my Wiz on the worst machine last night you know it's like you take a shirt right here you put a little stain on this shirt it'll never make it through a bleach bath no sir that bleach will break it up and send it back to the color it was originated and you'll never take sin through the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ it won't pass through it folks it'll take it off of you it'll erase it it'll take it out of the memories of God Amen I tell you about that blood it's a powerful blood in Psalms 27 amen it says for in the time of trouble shall he hide me in the Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock for in the time of tribulation can we say it like that or in the time of trouble in the time of judgment how many knows brother Brown threw up a rock all the way back there in 1964. threw that rock up and said judgment is coming remember and then on that Friday of the Passover amen Alaska almost sunk when brother bam threw that rock up judgment City and upon the nation and when he threw that rock up he said bride head for the secret place he said what is the secret place he said the promises of Malachi 4 and Luke 17 amen what is it it's a bride running into the Promised word of the age we're living in we're already sheltered upon Church judgment is falling on the nation but it ain't fell upon the house of God Amen you say why why what do you mean ain't fell on the house of God the last thing to fall is spiritual day death but brother amen I'm alive tonight amen I'm Not Dead in this place tonight and I'm here to let the devil know I'm still alive and kicking and I'm going to keep preaching as long as I got breath in my body hey I know the devil would like to shut us up you know [Applause] I know he would I remember we're going to keep preaching anyhow [Applause] oh yeah but in the time of trouble Haley had me said well bro Wayne how do you know how do you know I ain't going in there it's cool what your name is hey man how many knows brother and preach a whole message called identification you know he said how to identify yourself he said go in the Bible and watch the characters in the scripture and identify your present character with the characters in The Bible so if you want to know who you were in the disciples look at the ministry of Jesus Christ and watch how they reacted and there was a fair scene there's a woman at the well which are you it matters that Peter and James and John and then there's a Judas which one are you do you see what he's saying to you you've got to identify with one of those people because the same Jesus is here that was there is that right so now you can identify yourself because we have if you had to have two elements you're going to have you're going to have one of them here and that same Jesus is here so the way you respond to that Jesus is telling us who you are in the scriptures that's a pretty powerful thing when it comes into the positive hey man when it comes into the positive it's a pretty powerful thing because you say what are you saying I'm saying what's according to who you are according what's about to happen to you is calling what's about to happen to you because look what you can do you go out in the Bible and you can see about about Abraham sending Eliezer after a bride for Isaac all right now let's get real simple amen Eliezer is a prophetic word or a message William Branham ashamed brother bam identifies himself as at Elisha and he said he went among Abraham's kinfo those that had the Holy Ghost and he said he was looking for a mate for Isaacs that's when he went and he went to The Well of the virgins that's where he went with the words of Remember at the time in the evening when they were gathered together amen now elieza is William Branham come on church amen but it matters how you respond to the message it tells us who you are and there was a lot of women that come to that well but none of their name made the scripture they were just women that's all they were they were just what they were just the millions amen but there was one little girl that walked up to the well and the way she responded got her name written down and three thousand years later we're preaching about this woman because she didn't die that spirit is still alive today in the Church of the Living God it was an attribute that was in a tight being as fulfilled in his greater type now in this generation and look what he did when he went down to that well Ellie he's on his way he started praying y'all know the prayer and he said Lord amen let the woman that's supposed to marry Isaac respond like this you remember he said I'll ask for a drink and then she'll give me a drink and then she'll offer to water my camels now he didn't tell her any of that she didn't hear any of that but the minute he said yeah I'd like to have a drink she said well I water you I'll give you a drink but I'll get the camels also oh brother she had part of the word that wasn't even written down she had part of the word nobody had ever told her hey man where was that word at it was in her that response was laying in or amen and God was recording the way you could identify the Bride In the End Time amen they would water the camels of Elisha not only did they give a little drink to Elise or they said we'll water whatever brought you here brother man said those those camels y'all know the story he said those camels represented a power that brought Elijah to the whale which is represented as the power of the Holy Ghost in the end time that brings the end time messenger is that right he said National Force will put Israel in his place but the power of God will put the bride in their place listen amen we are not riding the Scarlet Beast of Revelation 17 but we are mounted on to the camel of the power of God that's going to ride this church all the way into the promised land and I'll tell you what Rebecca did she watered those camels foreign don't you get on to me my praise it I can't beat my type my type what is that Camel in the Bible it was the Holy Ghost at the well amen that was going to carry her out of there you know what it is the holy spirit can come into some places amen and it'll first to death and it'll just die out right in the amen the power of it is there the reality is there it'll just keep getting lower and lower and lower and lower and lower but if Rebecca's in the place if there's a Rebecca in there she's going to start watering it until the power of the Holy Ghost is refreshed among the Church of the Living God I say refresh the Holy Ghost bring back the power of God bring back something that'll carry us out of our troubles it'll carry us out of our ideas it'll carry us out into the presence of the Living God it's time to water the camels of Eliza you still want where they were Holy Ghost how'd they water them with their praises [Applause] when's the last time you praised a while when's the last time you got into service so far that you forgot about who you were you forgot about where you come from you forgot about the troubles you forgot about the problems and you just said glory be to God it's so good to be in love with Jesus Christ [Applause] I say I say pull out the water buckets tonight [Applause] come on little duck the water's running [Applause] oh my goodness now I know the devil he don't want any of that going on in the church but it matters what your name is and I am a Rebecca I'm a Rebecca by scripture don't you get upset at me for worshiping don't you get up for me upsetting me in my prayers somebody said well brother Wayne that's not our culture get a different one hey man that's not that's not our nature get a new one that's promised in the Bible to Divine Nature well I'm just quiet by Nature amen get a new nature that can respond to the Holy Ghost come on I I I'm sorry I'm not trying to preach a motion I'm trying to tell you that you're using your nature and your culture from watering them camels I'm too tired brother water them anyhow amen I don't feel like it wire them anyhow if you ever start watering the camel you'll feel about different about the third bucket you start pouring that's the third Hallelujah it comes out of your mouth about the third time you start waving your hand all of a sudden you'll feel the power of what you're watering it'll make you feel like dancing it'll make you feel like shouting it's the power of God Church we need the presence and handle him to return back in the church with anointing him with power to break the bonds of hell [Applause] somebody shout Glory [Applause] you start watering them camels oh brother you've been driving by yourself down the road and you just hold out Hallelujah that first one sounded odd you know but that second one Hallelujah I've started that I've been driving down the road no devil talking to me but this person said that and that person said this and this person said that and I just said Hallelujah pretty good and man I just haul again Hallelujah here in a minute I don't know how the car is driving because my eyes are full of tears and my hands are up and snots are running Holy Ghost fountains are flowing Hey listen if God can meet a man in his pickup if God could meet a man in his bedroom if God can meet a man out in the woods what happens when you get a hundred Believers together and they get in one mind and one Accord we ought to blow every devil out of this area until the fire of God refills every life and every heart with the annoying of the Living God I'm not scared of that formal devil I'm not scared of them holy ghosts amen repactions amen I want the power of God and coming to our midst in life until it changes come on we're looking for a body change let it change your attitude let it change your atmosphere let it change your situation let it change the way you see things ah somebody get out the water bucket tonight David said I first I want a drink a fresh Pentecostal Waters and a couple men rose up and got a bucket and they fought their way through 15 miles of Philistines amen you're the one carrying the water tonight [Applause] I had to fight through brother but I made it come on Sister Kim that's right you gotta fight through it but once you get through amen is clear waters it's running Waters hey glory to God don't they feel good when the Holy Ghost has its way high and high and higher and higher my brother I tell you what I want to get closer to his house [Applause] my [Applause] what are you doing well I'm watering the

ready to go come on Church the churches might shut down we don't know what they're going to do but I want to be full and ready to go I'm gonna need a ride [Applause] hey don't gonna get all upset at me my name's Rebecca thank you what are you talking about preacher you know your name's also the Queen of Sheba and don't you get upset at me for wanting to see a living God every type I got in the Bible wanted to see a real God I said I thirst to see him John job long to see him you didn't give them no little pacifier and tell them to be pacified and wait for another day these men of God desired the presence of the Living God let me say something to you tonight if you desire the presence of God Amen he's right here in the building right now ready to receive the worship of almighty God until every demon is broken and every Power is released foreign I'll tell you what it feels pretty good right in here right now the waters are flowing somebody shout hallelujah [Applause] come what your name is do you know who else you are I don't know her actual name but I know who she was there was a woman in the name in the Bible who was Joseph's wife yeah do you know she was a gentile married to the tribe that was going to lead the Jews and while Joseph was killed of his Brethren they thought he had been resurrected and become the Lord of another country and them Jews think they killed Jesus but he's resurrected and became the lord of the Gentiles and while as being the lord of the Gentiles he saved the whole world even the Jews is that right but while he was there he had a couple of his own seed through a gentile life and he had that woman all the way up to the Revelation to his Brethren of who he was but the Revelation leaned there's the prophet of God said you type Joseph's wife and when the Brethren returned he said he was going to reveal himself he said but before I can you've got to go to the Palace brother Brown said the only way for you get to the Palace is a change of your body listen Joseph's Brethren are up there right now I don't know if y'all realize this but that man's name is Benjamin not nahu and he's already been gone and back again come on church amen there's something about that man Benjamin amen and there's another group in the Bible who come under Benjamin in the last day I I believe it's going home time I believe the bride is right there I believe it's a season to be translated in the moment in the twinkle of an eye now the story doesn't read they took her out back and beat her the story doesn't read that they took her outside and put her through some kind of tribulation while he was revealing they took her to the Palace brother and Jesus is taking this bride to the Palace [Applause] huh now for trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare for that battle [Applause] all shot glory be to Gob what an hour to live huh devil ain't got a chance in this place open that other door give him room get out of here if he don't get out here quick he gonna get a baptism in the Holy Ghost the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare for the battle who can prepare for paradox we're not preparing for tribulation we're not storing food and weapons and money and trying to get ourselves ready for this tribulation is coming no sir this bride's preparing for paradox now I I'm not dumb I got a family I got a freezer and I got some food and I got some water because a storm could hit and knock your power out for two weeks but I ain't looking for no tribulation I'm a boy scout I really am from way back I'm a Boy Scout I made life I almost went to Eagle but we got to we we had disagreements before we got that far sorry it's true but I'm going to another club and not only life I made eagle I got told how to get ready how to be ready how to live ready that's right see because something is going to change our body it will be a paradox now Paul said that our conversation is Heaven for which we look for the Savior our Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body I love the word who there I love the word who it's not what it's who how many ever listen to the tape to whom shall I go to whom if you want translation where are you going who are you going to go to if you really want a body change who you gonna go to there's only one person that can change your vile body and that is our Lord Jesus Christ the word vile here it's a powerful thing vile actually means humiliation Tabernacle of humiliation brother man uses the word he's speaking of Philippians 3. I don't know if he actually knew it was the Greek or not but but he brought it out he said this that someday we're going to be changed the Old Vile body of humiliation be changed and fashioned made like and under your body see we're groaning now Faith is substance he said veiled in this Tabernacle of humiliation and the urn is my perfect complete Redemption like in the beginning God created Adam the Garden of Eden now see someday this Mortal will take on immortality the the vile shall become glorified that's exactly what the church is looking for you say you're looking for a change what kind of change you're looking for I'm looking for to go from Mortal to immortal from corruptable to Incorruptible see my soul has already been changed Rising Sun I'm preaching to you now he said resurrected already can't miss it he said if they put you in the ground you'll come up with it and if you're alive you're going to change because you already got the approval from God when your soul was changed that's the token your soul is different it's ready to go it's just waiting for a change of this vile body that brother man talks about coming out of a tent stepping into another one to be changed back see now what was it see our God appeared in this this dimension in a tabernacle of humiliation himself and brought himself into a degradation of humanity to prove to the church that you can come from humility to glorification look at what our lord Jesus done he literally come out of the heavens of heavens and he came out of that glorified place and stepped into humiliation and then turned around and went back to glorification while he stood in humiliation he said father glorify me with the glory which I had before the foundations of the world so he came out of glory and took on humiliation and then turned around and went back to glory to prove to you that if you have fallen from there that you can return there the same way he did amen he came from there and he went back to there do you know that you came from God and you're returning back to God Amen but you bypassed the word but now the word has come to glorify you and put you back in your original state that you might be lifted back into the presence of God Amen now listen there's going to be a path that the church could take there's going to be a path the church can take now listen God don't put us through tribulation there's no need to because Jesus stripped himself humiliated himself and come down in the Great Divine from above now brother Bam's going to give us the reason how many ever studied the cross you ever study the cross now I know people talk about the cross and they they read about the cross but if you ever really studied the cross now if you've ever wondered why we do not have to go through tribulation take the next week of your life and study what the cross did for you if you're still wondering if you have to go through tribulation you don't have a revelation of the cross I'm not trying to mean that in a demedium way I just mean you don't know yet what Jesus did for you because if you ever see what he did you would never think you had to redo it if you've ever seen the price he paid you would never try to pay it again amen if you could only see it he stripped himself and humiliated himself and he came down here humbled himself into a tabernacle where he took the lowest name he could take he took the lowest job he could take so remember become a football is flunky done the lowest job with the lowest name that a man could do and he done all of that to show you how low that deity could go before it returned back to glorification some people said well I'll tell you what deity can't dwell in me because of my humble beginnings and where I came from the situations of my life amen you're completely wrong deity dwelt in humility did he dwell in humanity deity suffered dear to God but deity rose again amen it could be humiliated to the place of no Act of humiliation greater than the act of Calvary it was the greatest it was the most humiliating and the greatest punishment that anyone could put Upon A man the Romans the Romans actually would not even want to do their own citizens like this I'm not going to preach on the cross and agreed the extent tonight but I do want to say this that he and his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare this generation for his life was taken from the Earth of course this man our lord Jesus came into our degradation that's a beautiful word if you study it but he came into our degradation and and what it means is is that he was unanimously considered the most horrible form of death among Romans the degradation was also a part of the infliction and the punishment if applied to a free man it was usually in the case of the vileless criminals so when when someone was crucified it wasn't only to kill them like electric chair or by punishment of gas it was to humiliate them publicly before man so when they when they hung a man on the cross it was a visible out in the open thing that everybody could see how horrible this human was and then they didn't even give them the Dignity of being crucified and closed they stripped them naked and hang them publicly beaten and riveted in the most humiliated state that a man could be in that see when our lord Jesus came he didn't come to a palace he didn't come to a drive in the best of the cars and living in the greatest homes not our lord Jesus he came to the lowest place a man could go and then when he couldn't lower himself any further the Romans took him to another level of low Amen in the Hebrews chapter 2 it tells us amen that he didn't even take on him the form of angels but he came lower than the Angels amen and told us this that he took upon him the the very Seed of Abraham that he might be called our brother that he might be tempted in every like manner of man now that that deserves longer than I have to give it tonight but I'll say this in a very short way amen that what he did was he came into a place that he identified with every person suffering here tonight it doesn't matter what level of suffering that you're taking he was he was tempted in every like manner of man how many knows he was tempted in every gate of man he was tempted in every way of man now the Oneness Pentecost people used to if yeah if you ever if you're a preacher and you ever preached on the godhead there's a certain group always say well he's a Oneness you know amen and I don't mean to kick off on anybody but they'll call you Oneness because you preach the Oneness of the godhead but what what they try to do is identify you with the Pentecostals who believe in the Oneness of the godhead and the Pentecost but what they believed is that it was so much deity that it was God in the that he was God the flesh was God and he couldn't have had sex he couldn't have children he couldn't have smoked a cigarette he couldn't have whiskey hey man he couldn't have entered into sin of any kind but that's a lie amen he was every way a human being or he was not your Kinsmen so if you ever argue the godhead was someone ask him are we talking about his Humanity or are we talking about his deity because if it was a human you're talking about I can prove to you he was ever been human he suffered every bit of the way our human would suffer but if you want to talk about deity he was ever bit God in the human flesh until Paul said the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in Christ Jesus our lord he was ever met God and he was ever been a man if he wasn't man he wasn't your Kinsmen if he wasn't God you're not saved but God to the blood of his own son sacrificed that blood and paid the debt and the penalty of every man child and woman sitting here but not only did he forgive you a sin he suffered so he could understand your Temptation and from the lowest places yours of your sin he can carry you to a glorified place [Applause] brother I tell you that in order to be a blessing for every person sitting here tonight that he's able that he is able to feel the Temptations of what you're going through he knows what it's like church somebody somebody tried to present that he's God on the cross you know it was God that walked the hill it was God in one sense it was but we had a prophet that told us that the spirit left him in Gethsemane and he went to the Cross as a man not as a God come on church he carried the cross as a man not as a god come on friends you know what I'm talking about he drug his own cross and he did it to you and me why didn't he stop halfway up the hill why didn't he quit halfway in the going and surprise he had to pay that was the reason that he pressed on it was a bride on his mind he said I'll take her from the humiliation the glorification but he had to have a price to pay for that it was the blood he didn't go to Calvary as a God he went there as a man and every devil in hell tell him you don't have to do this you know you can turn around you don't have to you know how to put yourself through this you can you can let these people fend for themselves but he he went on he went on beaten and torn blood soaked it wasn't bad enough that he did that the stripped her clothes he walked there as a as a as a naked man I mean folks I I only won't be seen without my shirt on getting the public can you imagine walking out in the public with just I mean you know just you're talking about humiliated and it wasn't just any man they'd done this way it was the king it was the king of all of Heaven and they're humiliating him this way but brother Shamar he keeps going anyhow you know why you know what the prophet said water from The Rock in 55 he's preaching and all of a sudden he says I see it he said I see Adam leaving the garden he said I see them bloody sheepskins he's in a vision he said his spot in the side of Adam's legs and I see him believing in humiliation I see him leaving in defeat he said but now the vision is breaking he said I see another Adam I see him coming down a cobblestone Road he's got a cross on his back and he said they're his roles he said it starts it starts putting together and the Blood starts appearing you remember the story amen and his blood soaked and he comes to that place and brother man said they're going to put him on the cross now remember this when they put him up there on the cross amen here he is putting Adam back in the place that he come out of thank you when they hunt him on the cry I don't have time to go deep into this but I have to I have to at least show you why I believe you don't go through a tribulation because when they hung him on the cross he was answering sin's debt from Genesis and Genesis 3 said the woman's seat shall bruise the head of the serpent and he was there bruising the head of that serpent that's what he was doing and you know what they did the prophet of God y'all on this brother bam said what happened was when they beat him in the back he said that was for the for the for the healing of the body he said when they when they pierced his side he said that was for the Salvation of the Soul he said so what happened he said the blood out of that wound of his side ran together with the blood on his back and when it went down his leg it joined at the hip he said and by the time it hit the ground it was a blood for salvation and healing amen that that blood ran together if you preach gospel you've got to preach healing If You Preach healing you got to preach salvation it's by atonement it's not by your Works you're saved it's not by your abilities your saved you are saved by the blood atonement of Jesus Christ the son of God and he shed his blood for you you and me and by one act of redemption oh man is forever free of the power of the Living God oh Church there's enough blood to save every man as a bluff blood to save every person but there was a little bride that was only his mind amen that God was going to so blood wash her that there wouldn't be one spot or one recall of the blood of Jesus Christ that wouldn't touch her and completely cleanse and completely cleansed her life well I'll tell you I wish I was a songwriter I'd say oh the power of the blood amen the blood the blood the wonderful blood the blood of Jesus Christ I'll tell you what I don't have enough voice to preach it the way you ought to hear it blood the blood did it not because you did any good thing not because you said any good thing it's because of his blood and the only thing that you have done was said Lord I'll accept it and you only accept it because he gave you a seed to believe it it's Grace coming and it's Grace going you're wrapped up in the grace of God not good work have I done but the grace of God and his saved mankind I received the blood I received the word but there was something in me that wanted it everybody oh brother [Applause] somebody said brother Wayne don't you believe in don't you believe in sovereignty of choice absolutely I do believe in sovereignty of choice but I'm told God so grateful that God Amen made my choices for me every choice you ever made look what it got you look where your choices got you come on Church look at what some of your choices got you you'll take all the free choice you want to I'll take his choice I took what he chose for me he chose a path of redemption he chose a path of the blood he chose to wash me and I'm just going to stand still and let the blood of Jesus Christ wash away the sins and make me a citizen of another kingdom that's why that's why tonight I can stand in Victory so brother Wayne how do you got victory in such troubled times because I got a cross y'all know what matters what you look at come on folks it matters Isaiah said look unto me all ye into the Earth and be ye saved we're at another end of the Earth Rahab looked Nola look come on church amen but we are at the end and we are looking what are you looking at I'm looking at the bloodstained banner of almighty God that says every man and woman child in here tonight is free you're free to go in the Rapture you're free to be delivered you're free to be anointed you're free to praise God you're free to worship God we are not a man-made domination we are not a man ruled religion we are free in the power of the Holy Ghost hey y'all y'all know the scripture y'all remember over there in the Bible where it got the Lord who is our Banner one of the names of Jehovah remember where they got that when Moses was on the mountain and they're fighting the amalekites and everybody down there fighting and the Bible says why Moses hands were lifted everybody was winning but when Moses his hands fell they began to lose so God anointed a couple men said hold that man's hands up so we could win a while and they and they did it they they held up his hands but the prophet of God said notice now he said but when they come to Jesus Christ he said God nailed his hands up on calvary's tree so they forever are held up they were always in Victory I don't care how low you are look to Calvary and you'll get a victory look to the presence of God you'll get a victory somebody believe that yeah brother that's what I was looking for do that again you do that again throw him hands up like that again you just made me a good V A V for victory a V for victory if you'll surrender to the Cross you'll have a victory in every element of your life you'll have victory over diseases you'll have Victory oversee him you'll have victory over death I'm talking about a victory of all victories a jubilee of all jubilees it's through the power of the blood it's the Blood church it's the blood of Jesus Christ he said well give me the blood the Holy Ghost is the blood [Applause] I'm letting commanded to sprinkle the church with a chemical amen we're to speak words Holy Ghost words that sprinkles the church and the power of the blood of Jesus Christ Oh The Blood lift your hands Redemption draweth now when you see all these things lift up your head Jonah you in the belly of the whale but there's a promise already if you look this way there's a Deliverance coming come on Church y'all know I'm writing the word how'd that man know which way East was anyhow because God sovereignly turned him the right direction otherwise he didn't know head from toll or east from west or nothing else but God is present in the time of trouble and he headed John in the right direction and when he began to look at the temple would he began to look at the cross when he began to look at the word Victory came and the and the and the then the devil couldn't hold him no more now our citizenship it's in heaven our citizenship is in heaven well I wasn't intending to tell this but this is coming like a Russian win I got some Liberty here as I was traveling here a while back I was on an airplane I travel I don't remember where I was coming where I was going I forget where it's at now but I was on the airplane I was sitting there and I was meditating over all these people getting out of prison because of this new DNA stuff because there's a lot of innocent people in prison I don't know why they all say they're Innocent but there is a few really that are some of them didn't do it you know when there's there's uh there's uh evidence that's just a circumstantial but just because he's in the wrong town and they had the wrong prosecutor and the wrong judge they in jail but this DNA it has a greater Witness and so so people are getting out of prison and they're they're walking free and I was thinking about them people sitting on the on the plane I think about them people and I thought you know I guess I'm a little like that and I got out of prison I got to go free but then I thought I said but I really did it and I got to thinking about my life and and the Life I Lived before I was a Christian I I now I I don't I don't share it a lot because I don't give no glory to the devil I don't want him I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to boast up what I was I'm ashamed of what I was I've had young people say brother Wayne I wished I had your testimony well I wished I had yours it ain't near as glorious as you think it is matter of fact it's embarrassing as a preacher to have to have outlived some of the things that we did as a kid I was sitting there on that airplane I'm sitting there thinking about those things and I just dropped my head and I said Lord how does this fit in the Bible How could a man like me ever be free really free how could it really be Lord I said who am I how did you let this happen to me I I really about just about bawling about the ignorance of my life and about that time just almost an audible it might have been audible brother but it spoke to me directly and he said you're my Barabbas brother when he said them words to me it was an anointing dropping that airplane I started bawling big old alligator tears started they probably thought I was a crazy man but if you knew who Barabbas was Barabbas was guilty he's completely guilty amen but it was the cross that made the man free amen somebody told him about the power of the Cross listen to me I know sometimes people say well that guy he shouldn't be preaching the message so that guy shouldn't be preaching the message but you know it was an old Roman soldier that preached the gospel to Barabbas he was an unsaved man but what he had to say about the cross was so powerful and it gave a man Freedom let me tell you it ain't always The Vessel you're listening to it's the message you're hearing amen don't you ever forget this message as power whatever whatever mouth had come out of y'all know y'all know y'all seen a lot of preachers come and go but this message still got power in it [Applause] somebody said brother Wayne are you condemned not anymore I ain't I'm a Barabbas and I know who I am I know where I fit in Scripture that man walked free and it was up to him do I return to my former life or do I go and be a free man I'm a free man I didn't go back and try to get Vengeance I didn't go back and try to correct things and make people and make them pay for things I went on and went free just Kim and I know what I'm talking about now amen my life's more than something I read about I'm a barabba so if you've ever been forgiven the way I've been forgiven forgiven's the easiest thing you ever did somebody said what are you talking about I remember amen some of y'all might know me long enough to know one of one of my one of the second brother I got I had killed was killed by man back shot him shot him uh with a 22 rifle a bunch of times hey man did you know the night they shot that boy and murdered him right right in the right there and they put that old boy in jail he spent not even a night in jail got out on a 500 Bond the same night they made a they made that a second degree thing a man spent 10 months in prison I'm a hillbilly Blood for Blood that's the way we lived you do that to my brother we hang you somewhere high and burn you with fire that's the way it happens in the Hills amen but I had to make a decision I was either going to be a Christian or I was going to be a hillbilly and God be graceful to my heart he gave me enough forgiveness in this old Wicked thing that I could say brother I forgive you if a man walked in this building tonight I'd take him to the river and baptize him and invite him into heaven because if anybody can forgive me he could forgive anybody of anything I say oh God that the power of the blood dropping the church again with Revival fires and the Holy Ghost anointing oh brother this ain't just a story that's read it's a reality in my life roll the power of the blood say I stood before the judge and he said you can go free brother I've been ringing that Bell my whole life if he could free me he can free you if he could free me anybody there ain't nobody in this room can't be free tonight ain't nobody can't walk out of here three of every condemnation every fear in every situation as a citizen of another country I have a freedom I'm not actually an American I Come From Heaven my citizenship is in heaven do you know in Philippians chapter 3 he said the Lord Jesus Christ he said in whom we have our conversation it actually means citizenship we have our citizenship in heaven we are citizens of another kingdom that's why we talk like we talk that's why we believe what we believe we got our own language it carries continents you can go in Africa and they speak same language I do right it's a faith language God starts it when you're baby and the message and you first got born he starts teaching you little words and after a while you start developing the language and after a while your words you can speak them over situations and breaks the power of the enemy brother I'll tell you what don't you ever let that devil tell you your words ain't got power he's trying to he's trying to stop a weapon that's what he's trying to do but if you'll just remember this you have a language of faith and oh my goodness I got too much brother Sean it's a language of Faith but I'll say this to you one thing that's not in our language is negative the prophet of God said this let your testimony always everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it I can't help the thoughts from coming but we'll be like that farmer and they can't it couldn't stop him from flying over but he sure could stop him from roosting you can't help a negative thought coming but you ain't got to entertain it you ain't got to feed it nothing right you can let it go on and I believe the Church of the Living God can let these things go I really believe that from my heart when a negative thing comes to my mind well you can't you can't there's no way you're ever going to make the raptures no way you're ever going to be able to do this that's a line devil that's trying to enter your mind to enter your confession to cause your own confession to condemn you I tell you what Paul said I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me amen I don't I don't do that on my own I'm not confessing about me amen I'm confessing with the blood of Jesus Christ did in my life and I've got a right to expect fully something to change Philippians three and three simply our conversation in heaven which we also look we also look for a savior that word look right there actually means to expect fully to expect fully what is it it's an expectation that's built upon something that's got faith behind it what is your expectation built upon tonight upon the word of God see Christianity whatever you are is built upon Faith now as much Faith as we'll be released that's how much power that you have whenever your face starts being released that's where your power is see see what we have is the word of God and as we spoke last night the word is the seed of things coming the message is the seed of the Rapture and he says Planet into your heart and then it will come to pass that's what you're going to do plant the word and then let the atmosphere come upon it he said see see what it is he said the gospel is not word only but through Power and demonstration of the spirit go in the world and demonstrate the power he said these signs shall follow them believe just teaching the word won't do it you've got to have the power of the Holy Ghost behind the word to make it come to life now some of these things were preaching they're old some of these promises that we're reading from here is from Philippians and Thessalonians and Corinthians they're over 2 000 years old somebody said why are you preaching words that are 2 000 years old brother bam said because they're seeds so he takes us back to the Garners of Joseph and says there were seeds back there in that Garner he said and those seeds laid there but when they discovered it I think one place he said it come out of the Great Pyramid but they discovered the seed and then when they found it they planted it and sure enough it came to life even if it was 2 000 years old so if you'll take the word and you will plant it in the right atmosphere it will still come to pass exactly what God said it would do but that's exactly what we need tonight isn't it we need the atmosphere to come upon the word we need an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost to come upon the word that's exactly what will change the situation that's exactly what will come upon our life Holy Ghost seeds of this Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom you'll never get the Bible to grow in wisdom the Bible only grows in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and somebody said brother Wayne what are you trying to say well I'm trying to say we've had this message now for about 57 years or so without the prophet here and the things that he spoke is just as real today as they were when he spoke them you've been carrying them around in your heart but what we really need is an atmosphere to come on what you have been taught we need the atmosphere to get to a place that what you've been taught will come to life that it'll live in its anointing amen the brother Adam actually says it he said it's the attitude of the people that brings the results and that's the reason Pentecost got in the upper room until the Holy Ghost came they got in one place in one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results and listen the atmosphere brings the results he said preacher what are you talking about I just want to say it to you like this do you know that there are certain germs that can't live in certain atmospheres they're biologically studying today how to stop certain germs just by adjusting your thermostat I remember years ago when the doctors told my wife he said if you keep it a little cooler in your house you'll have less problems with your kids sicknesses because those germs don't like it like that so the atmosphere changes what lives in it one of the one of the most extreme cases my my wife's Aunt sister Donnie she actually got a lung disease and they kept trying to figure out where the lung disease come from but it came from her hot water heater her hot water heater was set at a little lower temperature and there was some some bugs that lacked that temperature and every time she took a hot shower she was breathing those bacteria until they come into her so they told her you need to turn up your hot water heater and burn them things out of there well that's a little bit what we're talking about amen that there is a lukewarm place that we can get and there's bacterias that live in that lukewarm place and you said brother Wayne how do we get rid of this condition turn the heat up just turn up the heat and watch that devil die you don't have to you don't have to take a microscope and find ever ever little germ floating into place turn the fire on watch the Holy Ghost burning the church them Devils can't live in the fire of God you just start letting the Holy Spirit begin to move and things will start dying the power of God because it's the atmosphere that changes the situations it is the atmosphere brother Brandon said the atmosphere brings results that's what it is atmosphere brings it amen the atmosphere see Siege can't grow in that kind of atmosphere of wisdom atmosphere brings we know what we need to do amen this word again is put it on the cross he said he said we need to produce this word again put it not on a cross or on a nail but only live atmosphere of the Holy Spirit put the word on the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit it'll bring a result under the right atmosphere we'll produce exactly what it says it'll do it's got to be in the right atmosphere though hey if you want an atmosphere for healing preach healing if you want an atmosphere for salvation preach salvation if you want an atmosphere for worship preach worship if you want an atmosphere for Rapture preach Rapture and that's exactly what the atmosphere of the church ought to be we ought to be an expectation of a change just any minute we ought to lay and think about these things God is under expectation the atmosphere the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost brother man said here it is he said it'll straighten out every one of them spiritual problems it's here to heal every sick person that's present here but you've got to come and get it in the atmosphere and the attitude of receiving it what are you talking about I'm talking about changing Dimensions while we're right here I'm not talking about Dimension changing only with our physical body changes but when the spirit comes the dimension changes we're feeling the influence of another dimension while we're yet right here in this body you know what brother bam said about it he said you feel you're changing Dimensions he said or getting in the spirit when you get into the spirit you're changing you said preacher what are you lost your mind no I lost my mind some people got so deep in it until they moved like Philip 500 Miles he wasn't the rapturing day but he got so in the spirit that the spirit could carry the body from one place to another then the spirit of God can carry you from depression to the joy of the Lord it can carry you from a weary mind to peace and joy and salvation it'll carry you from a cold place unto the placing of the sons or the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need the spirit of God to carry us it's all right it's our ride he said preacher amen it ain't match your time John wasn't either he said but I was caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day and he traveled 2 000 years in time [Applause] you can travel tonight you could travel tonight you could travel to a land you could create your own world where the sun is shining with the joy of the Lord is redeeming where the power of God is going you can frame your own world by the faith of God oh yeah the preacher lost your mind I lost my mind y'all want me y'all want me to let you in on something there's no limits in the spirit hey man there's no limits in the spirit of God it's when a little it's when a little young man can preach like an old man come on you somebody said well you wander the mystery behind brother Andrew Glover's Ministry he said I I myself I forget he's 20 year old I listen to him preaching get around I think that boy's got to be a 50 year old man but he ain't he's 20 something years old but I'll tell you why he's preaching that way because he got carried in the spirit to my show brother Wayne why would you say that because they might be another young man sitting here saying I'd like to be a preacher like that well he didn't make himself a preacher he got in the spirit and the spirit carried him into a maturity that intellectualism would never take a man in you could study psychology and intellectual rest of your life and never get there but a man give him the spirit of God and it'll carry him into Revelation and authority and Power by the spirit of knowledge of Revelation that's why I don't believe there's an age limit on Mark 11 and 20. I don't believe it I don't believe that there's some age limits I believe it said if you say unto this mountain be moved I believe it's for you I believe it's for you if you can get in the spirit of it it'll carry you into an authority [Applause] come on if it could carry John 2 000 years he could carry William Branham all the way back to Eden he could carry you out of whatever situation you're in tonight it can give you a liberty and a freedom listen we're talking about a we're talking about an anointing that's going to change your body it definitely can change our attitude it can change
