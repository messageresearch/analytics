[37:26] pastor, by his word.
[37:30] [Music]
[37:33] Oh, I'll
[37:39] prevail by his
[37:44] word I'll
[37:47] never fail.
[37:51] Oh, by his

[37:56] word I'll
[37:58] [Music]

[38:09] I'll
[38:11] overcome. Sing it with all your hearts.
[38:14] Oh, by his word.
[38:20] Oh, I'll

[38:53] word. I'll
[38:56] prevail. Aren't you glad you got
[38:58] something to prevail with?
[39:01] All by his
[39:05] [Music]
[39:07] word I
[39:13] prevail. By his
[39:18] word I'll never
[39:24] fail by his word.
[39:32] I'll
[39:36] overcome by his word. I'll
[39:42] prevail. I'll
[39:44] [Music]
[39:48] overcome. Can you give him a hand clap
[39:51] of
[39:53] praise? Bless the name of the Lord.
[39:57] [Music]
[39:59] just to think that we're part of the end
[40:02] time move. Everything that God had in
[40:05] his mind, here we are. I mean, he's he's
[40:10] had this in the back of his mind and
[40:11] he's been working at it and working at
[40:13] it and working at it. And here we are,
[40:16] the manifestation of those
[40:18] thoughts. And he would do it in a time
[40:22] when it's the most evil age, the most
[40:24] corrupt age, the most deceptive age.
[40:27] And yet he said, "I'll still have a
[40:29] bride."
[40:30] Amen. He ain't going to fail. We ain't
[40:34] going to fail. Because he gave us the
[40:37] greatest weapon that we could ever have,
[40:39] and that's his word. And the prophet
[40:42] said, "With the restoration of the word
[40:44] comes the restoration of power." And we
[40:47] have seen it over and over. We've seen
[40:49] it in these meetings. I was thinking of
[40:52] a a young lady that goes to our church
[40:54] that
[40:56] um been
[40:58] battling um well just about to have a
[41:02] breakdown, nervous breakdown and and
[41:06] um anxiety and things like that. And the
[41:10] doctor told her yesterday said, "You
[41:11] need to be on
[41:13] anti-depressant pills and things like
[41:16] that." and you go look it up the side
[41:18] effects of suicidal thoughts and and all
[41:21] of these things. And we said, "No, no,
[41:24] no, don't do that." So, what you do is
[41:27] you just come and hear the word of the
[41:29] Lord.
[41:31] And let God do the work. And she heard
[41:34] the word of the Lord last night, came
[41:36] up, and God just totally delivered her.
[41:39] Hallelujah.
[41:42] By his word, we will prevail.
[41:46] by his
[41:48] word.
[41:50] Amen. These preachers ain't medical
[41:54] scientists. They're not doctors in
[41:57] medicine. They don't have their PhD. But
[42:00] one thing they have is they have the
[42:02] word. Amen. Amen. And as they've been
[42:04] preached and what a wonderful service
[42:07] this morning, eh? Amen. I
[42:11] Wow. Amen.
[42:15] And the word of God, I uh uh, Brother
[42:21] Brandham, Jonathan touched it a little
[42:23] bit, but Brother Brandham talking about
[42:25] Israel and he said, "National force put
[42:28] her in her place." He said, "Now I'm
[42:31] going to say something. National force
[42:33] put Israel in her homeland. National
[42:35] force will put the church in the world
[42:38] council of churches, but the power of
[42:40] God will put the people in the bride.
[42:43] The world forces this way, the world
[42:46] forces that way, but God forces upward.
[42:49] The spirit of God, which is the word of
[42:51] God, my word is spirit and life, will
[42:55] put the bride in her place.
[42:58] Can you say amen? Cuz she'll recognize
[43:01] her position in the word. then she's in
[43:05] Christ will put her in her place. No
[43:08] national force will do it. No politics
[43:11] will do it. Psychology won't do it. But
[43:14] the word of the Lord will do it. And I
[43:17] say he has put us in our place. We're
[43:20] positionally placed in Christ. And I'm
[43:23] recognizing my position more and more
[43:25] and more. And the devil just ain't can't
[43:27] do nothing about it. I will not be
[43:30] defeated. I will not be destroyed. My
[43:33] end ain't the tribulation. My end ain't
[43:36] hell. I've got a millennium I'm going
[43:39] to. And I'm excited about it. I hope
[43:42] you're excited as well. Amen. We
[43:44] certainly enjoyed the meetings. And um
[43:47] uh each night has been building and each
[43:50] service. And uh uh tonight, Brother
[43:53] Wendell Martin uh will be ministering
[43:56] and uh he's he's my older oldest brother
[44:00] and uh we I certainly love him and uh he
[44:04] loves this message. We I guess come into
[44:06] the message kind of together. It was um
[44:09] kind of God working on both ends and um
[44:13] uh we uh have worked together for many
[44:16] years and he's pastoring there in Pony,
[44:19] Oklahoma. And uh you just just can't
[44:23] find a finer uh brother, a man of God
[44:27] that just loves people, loves the Lord,
[44:30] loves the message. And uh we've had him
[44:33] uh here uh well, he's been I guess every
[44:36] year here preaching for us and and uh uh
[44:40] if you haven't heard him, you're going
[44:42] to be blessed. Not because of the man,
[44:44] but the gift that God has placed in the
[44:47] individual. And uh uh God just has all
[44:50] kinds of flavors, don't he? And not not
[44:53] he doesn't get just pick ministers out
[44:56] of the, you know, the uh the what do you
[44:58] call that? uh assemblyline preachers. We
[45:01] all have our different ways of
[45:03] ministering and preaching the gospel and
[45:06] God knows exactly what he's doing and I
[45:09] know you're going to be blessed. And so
[45:11] uh we want him to take his time, his
[45:13] liberty and uh sing and uh whatever the
[45:17] Lord lays on his heart. And so let's
[45:20] just sing uh that song again. By his
[45:22] word, I will prevail. Oh, by his
[45:31] word
[45:33] I
[45:37] prevail by his
[45:41] [Music]
[45:43] word. I'll never
[45:47] [Music]
[45:49] fail by his word.
[45:54] [Music]
[45:56] I'll
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:00] overcome. Oh, by his
[46:04] word I'll
[46:07] prevail. I'll I'll fulfill every promise
[46:11] that God has said about me by his word.
[46:17] [Music]
[46:20] I'll
[46:23] [Music]
[46:29] [Applause]
[46:37] prepare by his word.
[46:41] [Music]
[47:04] Well, praise the Lord.
[47:06] Aren't you glad for the word of the
[47:08] [Music]
[47:10] Lord? Hallelujah.
[47:13] So thankful. So thankful for God's word.
[47:17] Thankful for his grace upon our lives.
[47:20] And uh what can we say about this
[47:23] morning's message? Wasn't that just
[47:26] wonderful?
[47:29] My
[47:32] hallelujah. Amen. He is he is just so
[47:35] wonderful. You can be seated here
[47:37] tonight. and um like to say it's just
[47:41] really uh good to be here and and uh
[47:45] good good to be a part of uh of these
[47:50] meetings. We appreciate brother Shawn
[47:52] inviting us to come and and uh uh
[47:56] we we would have come whether we was
[47:59] invited or not. And
[48:03] uh Amen. And u so
[48:07] um this is a little the uh you might
[48:11] have to turn the lows down on my um on
[48:13] the guitar part. Praise the
[48:18] Lord. And um so I've thought all of the
[48:21] messages have just been so
[48:23] wonderful. And
[48:26] um and so we're I um I've I've got a
[48:30] song that I I had learned. It's an old
[48:32] song, but um
[48:37] uh it's an old Henson song. And I'm
[48:39] sorry that I didn't get back with you,
[48:42] brother. Can Brother Kevin? And uh that
[48:46] brother Kevin, he can play, can't
[48:51] he? So, I thought I would sing this
[48:54] before I asked my brothers to come. And
[48:57] um and so uh as I say, it's it's been
[49:02] around a long
[49:03] time. Trouble seems I tell you what.
[49:07] Amen. Let me get my
[49:09] capo. And uh it sounds better with a
[49:17] capo. Yes, I'm using a capo. Amen.
[49:21] Trouble seems to lack your style and
[49:25] you're feeling all
[49:28] alone. At your last resort, they had to
[49:32] leave for a while. Leave your name at
[49:34] the sound of the
[49:36] tone. It seems the world up and moved
[49:40] away. All that stayed was fear and
[49:44] doubt. They came looking for trouble and
[49:47] decided to stay. Now you're looking for
[49:50] a way to check out. Take it to
[49:53] [Music]
[49:55] Jesus. He
[50:01] knows. That wasn't part of the song,
[50:04] just in case you're
[50:06] wondering. Take it to
[50:09] [Music]
[50:11] Jesus. He knows. He feels. He cares.
[50:16] No one does it better when your life's
[50:20] in need of repair. Take it to
[50:28] [Music]
[50:29] Jesus. What a comfort
[50:33] knowing is always
[50:37] there. Old memories in the middle of the
[50:41] night takes the sleep out of your eyes.
[50:46] The room is dark and as you fiddle with
[50:49] the light, you break down and start to
[50:52] cry. Some bitter, painful past mistakes
[50:57] have been haunting you
[51:00] again and conjuring up the image of the
[51:03] fool that it takes to think that you
[51:06] could ever win. Take it to Jesus.
[51:12] He knows and feels and
[51:16] care. No one does it matter when your
[51:20] life in need of repair. Take it to
[51:30] Jesus. What a comfort to know. Friend is
[51:35] always there.
[51:38] Take it to
[51:43] [Music]
[51:45] Jesus. What a comfort to know your
[51:48] friend is always
[51:52] there. Yeah. It's a comfort to know your
[51:56] friend is always
[52:01] there.
[52:05] Hallelujah. Amen. A man.
[52:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. She's weathered
[52:13] many
[52:16] [Music]
[52:17] storms. Many times she thought she had
[52:24] died. But his grace kept on
[52:30] leading. She's cresting every
[52:36] tide. Many days upon the
[52:39] [Music]
[52:42] waters, sailing neath those angry
[52:49] skies. Her captain, her compass has not
[52:52] failed
[52:55] her. And her captain never dies.
[53:02] I can see heaven
[53:06] shores. Home time is
[53:11] [Music]
[53:12] coming. The saints of the
[53:17] ages are there to welcome me
[53:21] [Music]
[53:23] home. The ship is battered.
[53:30] The sails are
[53:34] torn, but as she's brought me
[53:40] safely to my father's
[53:45] arms. Many boats have started
[53:50] out, but only one my friend can make it.
[53:58] These rolling seas will
[54:02] billow and the hurricanes
[54:05] [Music]
[54:07] crash. But our captain's tried and
[54:13] proven. So let all hell roar.
[54:19] This ship will dock
[54:23] safely in spite of the
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] storm. Yes, I can see heaven
[54:34] shores. Home time is
[54:39] coming. The saints of the
[54:44] ages are there to welcome me home.
[54:51] The ship is
[54:55] battered. The sails are
[55:00] torn. But it's brought me
[55:05] safely to my father's arms.
[55:12] It's brought me
[55:15] safely to my father's
[55:21] [Music]
[55:24] arms.
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] Hallelujah. Rod me
[55:32] safely. We're ordained to make it and
[55:35] we're going to make it because greater
[55:38] is he that is in you than he that is in
[55:39] the world. Amen. And if brother Sean and
[55:42] brother Jonathan wouldn't mind coming
[55:43] and and singing just just a song or two.
[55:47] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many wants to
[55:49] hear a
[55:53] [Applause]
[55:54] [Music]
[55:57] trio? Amen. And uh this this song will
[56:00] be for Sister
[56:02] Faith. Praise the Lord. She she loves
[56:04] these old timeies. Amen.
[56:10] Praise the
[56:14] Lord. Let's see. Uh, he didn't bring us
[56:18] this
[56:19] far to leave
[56:24] us. He didn't teach us to swim to let us
[56:29] drown.
[56:34] He didn't build his home in us to move
[56:40] [Music]
[56:41] away. He didn't pick us up to let us
[56:46] down.
[56:51] [Music]

[56:54] promises in a
[57:00] letter written a long, long
[57:03] time ago.
[57:09] They're not getting older. They're
[57:12] getting
[57:17] better. Because he still wants us to
[57:22] [Laughter]
[57:25] know. He didn't bring us this
[57:28] far to leave us.
[57:31] [Music]
[57:34] He didn't teach us to swim to let us
[57:39] [Applause]
[57:42] drown. He didn't build his home in us to
[57:47] move
[57:50] away. He didn't pick us up to let us
[57:55] down. Listen to these words.
[57:59] [Music]
[58:08] Just claim them promises. Every one of
[58:12] them claim them promises
[58:17] for every spoken word he's going to
[58:20] keep.
[58:23] That's
[58:24] right. because you're
[58:28] everything to
[58:33] him. He didn't bring us this
[58:36] far to leave us.
[58:41] Hallelujah. He didn't teach us to swim
[58:44] to let us drown.

[58:57] away. He didn't pick us up to let us
[59:05] down. He didn't pick us up to let us
[59:14] down. Hallelujah.

[59:24] that? Aren't you glad that he that
[59:27] started you has promised to finish you?
[59:30] Glory to the lamb of God.

[1:05:22] me. He reaches
[1:05:25] down to brush the tear
[1:05:30] drops from my eyes.
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:37] He just
[1:05:39] takes me
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:43] in his arms and
[1:05:46] holds
[1:05:50] me. Never so
[1:05:54] gentle till the
[1:05:56] feelings all subside.
[1:06:01] One more
[1:06:02] time. Oh, he just
[1:06:06] takes
[1:06:09] me in his arms and
[1:06:13] holds
[1:06:16] me. He reaches
[1:06:19] down to crush the tear drops from my
[1:06:27] [Applause]
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:30] He just
[1:06:32] takes
[1:06:35] me in his arms and
[1:06:39] holds
[1:06:42] me. Ever so
[1:06:46] gentle till
[1:06:50] the sun.
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:06:56] Ever so
[1:06:59] gentle till the
[1:07:02] feelings all
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:09] so hallelujah.
[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:15] Hallelujah. Oh, bless the Lord. Bless
[1:07:18] the Lord.
[1:07:21] He just takes me in his arms and he
[1:07:25] holds me. Aren't you glad for that
[1:07:27] today?
[1:07:29] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we will
[1:07:32] look here in the book of
[1:07:35] Amen. Over here in in
[1:07:39] the book of Zechariah, the fourth
[1:07:43] chapter.
[1:07:45] And
[1:07:46] um what can we say about all of the
[1:07:49] wonderful food that we've been eating

[1:08:03] us back and forth wherever we need to go

[1:08:09] them. And um you know, while we're here
[1:08:13] enjoying ourselves, they're up there
[1:08:15] cooking and and working. And I I tell
[1:08:18] you what, I say, God, give those sisters
[1:08:21] and those brothers um a great big
[1:08:24] blessing.
[1:08:26] Amen. I want to read here in Zechariah
[1:08:29] the 4th
[1:08:30] chapter and um Amen. And I'm we're just
[1:08:35] going to start at the first verse.
[1:08:37] an angel that talked with me come again
[1:08:39] and wake me as a man that had waken out
[1:08:41] of his
[1:08:42] sleep. And he said unto me, what seeest
[1:08:45] thou? And I said, I have looked, and
[1:08:48] behold, a candlestick all of gold, and a
[1:08:51] bowl upon the top of it, and his seven
[1:08:53] lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
[1:08:57] seven lamps which are upon the top
[1:08:59] thereof. the two olive trees by it, one
[1:09:02] upon the right side of the bowl, and the
[1:09:05] other side or the other the left side
[1:09:08] thereof. And I answered and spake to the
[1:09:11] angel that talked with me, saying, "What
[1:09:13] are these things, my
[1:09:14] Lord?" And the an then the angel that
[1:09:17] talked with me answered and said unto
[1:09:20] me, "Knowest not what these be?" And I
[1:09:23] said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered
[1:09:26] and spake unto me, saying, This is the
[1:09:28] word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, not by
[1:09:31] might, nor by power, but by my spirit,
[1:09:35] saith the Lord of
[1:09:37] hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain,
[1:09:40] before Zerubabel, thou shalt become a
[1:09:44] plain. He shall bring forth the
[1:09:46] headstone thereof with shoutings,
[1:09:48] crying, grace, grace unto it.
[1:09:52] Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto
[1:09:54] me, saying, The hands of Zerubabel have
[1:09:56] laid the foundation of this house, and
[1:09:58] his hand shall also finish it. For thou
[1:10:01] shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath
[1:10:03] sent me unto
[1:10:05] you. For who hath despised the day of
[1:10:08] small things? For they shall rejoice and
[1:10:11] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[1:10:13] Zerubabel with those seven. They are the
[1:10:16] eyes of the Lord which run to and fro
[1:10:20] throughout the whole earth. I want to
[1:10:23] speak just on a simple title here
[1:10:26] tonight. Grace to the
[1:10:29] headstone, the capstone. Father, we just
[1:10:32] love you today.
[1:10:34] We thank you for your abundant mercies
[1:10:38] and the wonderful words that you have
[1:10:41] brought to us these last three days,
[1:10:44] Lord, and how gracious you are and how
[1:10:50] wonderful it is to be your bride. that I
[1:10:55] pray Lord tonight that you would Lord
[1:10:57] that you would just come sweep over this
[1:11:00] tent and that you would settle all of
[1:11:02] our hearts that you would speak to us
[1:11:05] Lord and may your words ring within our
[1:11:08] predestinated
[1:11:10] souls. I pray Lord that you would come
[1:11:12] in a real special way
[1:11:14] tonight that you would heal the sick and
[1:11:17] encourage the
[1:11:19] discouraged. Bring the backslider home
[1:11:21] to you. Lord, I pray that you'll
[1:11:24] strengthen the hands of all of the local
[1:11:27] assemblies, Lord, and those that are
[1:11:30] represented under this tent here, Lord.
[1:11:32] Bless Brother Shawn and all of the
[1:11:35] laborers, Lord. Oh God, we love you and
[1:11:39] we give ourselves to you now as we
[1:11:41] report for duty in Jesus' name. Can the
[1:11:45] church say amen? Amen. And amen. God
[1:11:48] bless you. You may be seated here this
[1:11:51] evening.
[1:11:53] Amen. How good God is. God is so good to
[1:11:58] us. As we have just read of the great
[1:12:01] prince
[1:12:03] Zerubabel was appointed by God to
[1:12:07] rebuild the
[1:12:09] temple and the restoration of that
[1:12:11] temple was what God was was in the it
[1:12:14] was in the mind of God and nothing was
[1:12:16] going to stay that purpose.
[1:12:19] Now, Zerubbabel had laid the foundation
[1:12:22] and it is highly probable that he dug
[1:12:25] down to the original uh foundation,
[1:12:28] gathered the original stones, restoring
[1:12:31] the original foundation, and he was to
[1:12:34] bring forth the
[1:12:36] headstone. Amen. Not the cornerstone,
[1:12:39] but it would be the headstone, as
[1:12:41] brother Brandham would put it, the
[1:12:42] capping stone.
[1:12:45] And now there was much opposition
[1:12:48] against this restoration.
[1:12:50] Amen. It wasn't going to be easy. Though
[1:12:53] Zerubabel was anointed of the Lord to do
[1:12:56] this, he was called of God to do that.
[1:12:58] But there were going to be many
[1:13:01] obstacles in the way. There were going
[1:13:03] to be the sand ballots and the the
[1:13:05] Chaldans. There were going to be many
[1:13:07] there to stop what God had in his mind.
[1:13:12] Amen. and stop the purpose of God. And
[1:13:16] it had got to the point to where the
[1:13:18] naysayers had actually convinced the
[1:13:21] king to stop and put a halt to this
[1:13:25] reconstruction of the temple. Amen.
[1:13:28] Those who were working were a little
[1:13:31] they had grown weary. They had seen the
[1:13:33] hand of God upon Zerubbabel, but yet
[1:13:36] they had grown weary in their Amen. in
[1:13:39] all of the fighting. And Zerubbabel
[1:13:41] himself had even a man gotten a little
[1:13:44] bit discouraged. And amen wondering if
[1:13:47] maybe it wasn't going to happen. But
[1:13:50] then the Lord comes and he says, "I I
[1:13:53] want you to go and tell Zerubabel that
[1:13:56] my hand is upon him. I want Zerubabel to
[1:14:00] know," Amen. that I have called him and
[1:14:06] ordained him not to just start the work
[1:14:09] but to finish this wonderful work. And
[1:14:13] God would look at all of the opposition
[1:14:16] and God would say, "Who art thou, oh
[1:14:19] mountain?
[1:14:21] Who art thou that would stand in the
[1:14:24] way, the
[1:14:25] hindrances, the enemy that is trying to
[1:14:29] stop what I have already purposed in my
[1:14:33] own mind and decreed? Well, can you say
[1:14:37] amen? I just want to say right now,
[1:14:39] Satan is in a losing battle when he
[1:14:42] tries to stop what God has already
[1:14:44] started. If God starts the work, God's
[1:14:48] going to finish the work because God's
[1:14:51] already seen the beginning from the end.
[1:14:53] God has already declared it and God's
[1:14:56] purposes will stand. Aren't you glad
[1:14:58] when grace steps in? Amen. Grace steps
[1:15:02] in in the most discouraging time. Grace
[1:15:05] steps in when it looks like all hope is
[1:15:08] gone. Grace steps in. And when it when
[1:15:10] it looks like everything is going to
[1:15:13] fail and falter, grace steps in and
[1:15:16] says, "Amen. Who do you think you are,
[1:15:19] oh great mountain? Who do you think you
[1:15:22] are? Thou shalt become a plain and grace
[1:15:27] shall bring you low." Well, can you say
[1:15:30] amen? I I I hear the Lord looking there
[1:15:33] at his discouraged servant. Amen. And
[1:15:36] that great prince and he's telling him,
[1:15:38] "Amen. And I want you to march on,
[1:15:40] Zerubabel. Amen. All shall be made
[1:15:42] smooth and plain before thee. Have I not
[1:15:45] called thee? Will I not remove every
[1:15:49] obstacle out of thy way? How many
[1:15:52] believe God is a way maker here tonight?
[1:15:55] Amen. Maybe you're looking, maybe
[1:15:56] there's something in your way. Maybe
[1:15:58] there's some discouragements that you're
[1:16:00] fighting. Maybe you've got a sickness
[1:16:01] that the doctor says, amen, that you
[1:16:03] can't get over. But we've already heard
[1:16:05] testimonies this weekend of what God can
[1:16:08] do because grace is
[1:16:11] mighty. Now we know of course there is a
[1:16:14] greater implication here as the
[1:16:17] candlesticks were a type of the seven
[1:16:19] ages. Amen. But specifically the
[1:16:22] finishing up of the mystery. Amen. He
[1:16:26] said that this temple must be finished.
[1:16:31] Amen. And I I I I believe that that
[1:16:34] comes to this generation, amen, the
[1:16:37] anointing upon a restoration prophet to
[1:16:41] lay again the foundations, amen, that
[1:16:44] have went into rubble, but also to bring
[1:16:47] the capstone, the headstone, amen, as we
[1:16:51] heard so beautifully preached here this
[1:16:53] morning. And it was going to be, as
[1:16:55] brother Brandham would say, amen. Not by
[1:16:58] might nor by power, but by my spirit,
[1:17:01] saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou,
[1:17:04] oh great mountain? Thou shalt become a
[1:17:09] plain, and he shall bring forth the
[1:17:12] headstone with the shoutings and
[1:17:15] cryings, grace, grace unto it. Can you
[1:17:18] say amen? I I I want to say that this is
[1:17:21] the Lord's doings here. Amen. What God
[1:17:24] has been doing throughout these seven
[1:17:26] church ages has not been man's ideas. It
[1:17:30] has already been planned and ordained of
[1:17:32] God. God has already put it into motion.
[1:17:35] God gave it to us through the seals. He
[1:17:37] showed it to us through the church ages.
[1:17:39] We have seen, amen, that God knew the
[1:17:42] obstacles were going to be there. Amen.
[1:17:45] God knew the obstacles were going to be
[1:17:48] there when he said that he would have a
[1:17:50] bride without spot, wrinkle, or blemish.
[1:17:53] God said that those would Amen. There's
[1:17:55] going to be a rapture. Do you believe
[1:17:57] you're a part of that rapturing
[1:17:59] generation? Amen. We should stand here
[1:18:02] tonight. Amen. With the grace crying
[1:18:05] out, Amen. I am there to make my words
[1:18:10] come to pass.
[1:18:12] Amen. Now, what is grace? Grace is
[1:18:14] unmmerited favor. Amen. Grace is the
[1:18:18] divine influence upon one's heart. Amen.
[1:18:22] The divine influence of God upon whom he
[1:18:25] would choose. Grace comes with a
[1:18:29] destiny. Amen. When grace sets its hand
[1:18:33] upon you. Amen. When God first calls
[1:18:36] you, then God has got a destiny for you.
[1:18:40] And there is nothing that is going to
[1:18:44] stop the divine grace of God in your
[1:18:47] life. Amen. I I want to I want to tell
[1:18:50] you young people that are present here
[1:18:52] this evening, grace has begun the good
[1:18:55] work in you and grace is going to bring
[1:18:58] the capstone in your life. Amen.
[1:19:02] Sovereign grace comes from a sovereign
[1:19:04] God. Grace belongs only to God. Amen.
[1:19:08] Grace doesn't belong to me. Grace
[1:19:10] doesn't belong to you. Grace belongs to
[1:19:14] God. Amen. Only a sovereign one can give
[1:19:18] grace. Amen. Where would any of you be
[1:19:21] if it had not been for the grace of God?
[1:19:23] Can I hear an amen? Amen. Only a
[1:19:27] sovereign one possesses supreme,
[1:19:30] unlimited, and ultimate power. He
[1:19:33] doesn't ask permission from someone
[1:19:35] else. He doesn't take a poll to see if
[1:19:39] he can win. But there is one. He's a
[1:19:42] sovereign one who has never lost a
[1:19:44] battle. He never will lose a battle. His
[1:19:47] words have always come to pass. His
[1:19:49] thoughts have always been correct. God
[1:19:51] has never had a new thought. God has
[1:19:54] never turned around and and thought,
[1:19:55] "Oops, I didn't see that one coming."
[1:19:58] God is God. God is sovereign. God knows
[1:20:01] the beginning from the ending. God knows
[1:20:04] you. Well, praise the Lord. I say God
[1:20:07] knew you before you were born. I say God
[1:20:10] knew you were coming and wanted you to
[1:20:12] be here. And he brought your great
[1:20:14] grandpa and great grandma together. He
[1:20:16] brought your mom and daddy together. He
[1:20:19] brought you together because he wants a
[1:20:21] certain people for this rapture.
[1:20:26] Amen. Is going to be a special class of
[1:20:28] people. It's going to be a people of
[1:20:30] divine grace through and through. There
[1:20:32] will be no works. There will be nothing
[1:20:33] you can add. There will be nothing you
[1:20:35] can take away. It'll be by divine grace
[1:20:38] upon your life. And that grace will
[1:20:40] bring the power of God. It'll bring the
[1:20:42] anointing of God. It'll take you through
[1:20:44] every valley. It'll bring you through
[1:20:46] every trial. It'll take you through
[1:20:49] because grace has called you.
[1:20:53] Can you say amen? You remember brother
[1:20:56] Benham would say sovereign grace is from
[1:20:58] a sovereign one. Sovereign grace from a
[1:21:01] sovereign one. What can it do? Grace, a
[1:21:05] sovereign can do what it wants to.
[1:21:07] Listen to this now. Sovereign grace can
[1:21:11] do can only be given by the sovereign
[1:21:15] God. God is sovereign. So he can give
[1:21:18] sovereign grace. Therefore, being
[1:21:21] sovereign, grace don't ask anybody. I It
[1:21:24] don't have to. It does what it wants to.
[1:21:27] Isn't that wonderful? It don't ask, "Can
[1:21:30] I do this? Shall I do this?" Amen. Can
[1:21:33] I? Must I? Will I? It doesn't do it. It
[1:21:36] does it itself because grace is
[1:21:39] sovereign.
[1:21:41] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. He says,
[1:21:44] "Therefore, he can save the voust. He
[1:21:46] can save the worst. He can save the
[1:21:48] impurst. He can save the immoralist. He
[1:21:51] can heal the sickest. He can do what he
[1:21:54] wants to. Hallelujah. Amen." So God is
[1:21:58] the one who can give grace.
[1:22:03] Oh, hallelujah. Now, I can give grace.
[1:22:06] Amen. I can put my name on the line for
[1:22:08] somebody and I've done that before.
[1:22:11] Amen. I've I've stuck my neck out and
[1:22:13] said, "I'll vouch for him." Amen. But
[1:22:16] when it came time, they failed, man. And
[1:22:18] I wasn't able to. Amen. I wasn't able to
[1:22:21] deliver. But when God says there's going
[1:22:23] to be a bride, and when you fail, God
[1:22:27] says, "I've got it taken care of.
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:33] When God says, "I'm going to heal the
[1:22:35] sickest among you." And when you get
[1:22:38] sick, God says, "I have got it taken
[1:22:41] care
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:43] of." When your mind is playing tricks on
[1:22:46] you, amen, and you're in menopause and
[1:22:48] it seems like the enemy is fighting you,
[1:22:51] Amen. And it seems your world is coming
[1:22:53] against you. I want to let you know the
[1:22:56] grace of God that called you as a young
[1:22:58] woman is still with you today. The grace
[1:23:01] of God that ordained you is still right
[1:23:05] there with you. Grace has called you and
[1:23:09] grace will keep you.
[1:23:15] Can you say amen?
[1:23:17] Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet says,
[1:23:20] "Grace, God brought grace into your life
[1:23:23] by his love for us." Here's something
[1:23:26] else grace can't do. Grace cannot be
[1:23:29] bought. Grace cannot be sold. It's
[1:23:33] grace. It's by a sovereign. Yes, sir.
[1:23:37] You cannot bargain for it. God says you
[1:23:40] can say, "Well, God, I'll do so and so
[1:23:42] and you'll do this." You can't do that.
[1:23:45] God won't do it. You can't pull nothing
[1:23:49] out of God. God gives it to you by his
[1:23:54] grace.
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:58] Amen. Sometimes we think in this
[1:24:02] capstone age. Amen. That there's a lot
[1:24:05] of pressure on us. I've got to be good.
[1:24:07] The rapture's coming. Amen. I can't make
[1:24:09] a mistake. The rapture is coming. Amen.
[1:24:12] I I fall. I failed yesterday. The
[1:24:15] rapture's coming. I want to tell you,
[1:24:17] God knows who's going to be in that
[1:24:18] rapture. And God called you and placed
[1:24:21] your name in that book, and his grace
[1:24:23] will be there all the way. Amen. It's
[1:24:27] God's fairing nature. Amen. Grace is as
[1:24:31] old as creation itself. By grace, God
[1:24:35] favored man above all other nature. It
[1:24:40] was the grace of God. He could have had
[1:24:42] the son to preach the gospel. He could
[1:24:45] have called the moon. He could have
[1:24:47] called but he called
[1:24:49] humans. God favored humanity.
[1:24:55] God could have given the animal kingdom
[1:24:57] jurisdiction over the earth. But he
[1:25:00] didn't give the animal kingdom. He gave
[1:25:02] it to man. That was God's favor. Amen.
[1:25:06] By grace. It was Adam and Eve that God
[1:25:09] gave the keys to the planet earth.
[1:25:11] Authority and dominion was all was given
[1:25:14] to them over all of creation. Can you
[1:25:16] say amen? Amen. It was grace when God
[1:25:20] looked down and he saw Adam fail and he
[1:25:24] saw Amen. Eve fall. Amen. It was grace
[1:25:27] that God I tell you when it starts out
[1:25:30] with grace, it's going to end with
[1:25:31] grace. If God ever favored you in the
[1:25:34] beginning, God's still favoring you
[1:25:36] today. Well, can you say amen?
[1:25:39] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon would talk
[1:25:41] about the sovereign uh God. Amen. And
[1:25:46] how that that grace was put to the test.
[1:25:49] God had favored man and God had shown
[1:25:52] his grace and given him authority and
[1:25:55] given him the planet that he had built
[1:25:57] specifically for him. And now it is
[1:26:00] being put to the test. And brother
[1:26:01] Brandham says, "Oh, how terrible that
[1:26:04] morning. Darkness hanging in the garden.
[1:26:06] I'll imagine the fog of black sackloth.
[1:26:10] I'd imagine every leaf never moved.
[1:26:12] There were no wind stirring. It was
[1:26:14] darkness and terrible because sin had
[1:26:17] blotted out. There come Jehovah down
[1:26:20] like a roar of thunder, walking through
[1:26:22] the garden, crying, "Adam, where art
[1:26:25] thou?" That's when Adam realized he was
[1:26:28] naked and had sinned before God. He hid
[1:26:31] himself and tried to make himself a
[1:26:33] religion, but it didn't work. God killed
[1:26:35] some sheep and took the skins and showed
[1:26:38] that something had to die to cover. And
[1:26:40] joining church will never cover sin. No
[1:26:44] dryeyed confession will ever cover sin.
[1:26:46] It takes sorrow and repentance and the
[1:26:49] grace of God to cover sin. Can I hear an
[1:26:51] amen? Amen. Don't hide your sin from
[1:26:54] God. Don't you sweep your sin under the
[1:26:57] under the rug. Don't hide your sin.
[1:27:00] Amen. when grace is. Oh, I know what
[1:27:02] it's like to to fail somebody. I know
[1:27:05] what it's like to hurt my wife. I know
[1:27:07] what it's like to hurt my church. I know
[1:27:10] what it's like to hurt my children.
[1:27:12] Amen. And sometimes it's hard for me to
[1:27:15] Amen. to be able to lift up my eyesh
[1:27:17] because I've hurt somebody. And brother,
[1:27:19] that's the way it is with God.
[1:27:22] There's none of us that want to hurt
[1:27:24] God. There's none of us that want to go
[1:27:26] against his word. Well, can you say
[1:27:28] amen? But when you fail, don't go
[1:27:32] running from God. Uh because the grace
[1:27:35] that favored you in the beginning is the
[1:27:39] grace that is running after you with
[1:27:43] mercy and power and
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:48] forgiveness. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:27:51] Satan will tell you, "Well, you'll never
[1:27:53] make it. You'll never make the rapture."
[1:27:55] But I say it's to those who can look in
[1:27:58] the mirror and say you're wrong and
[1:28:01] you've got to bring it to God for
[1:28:04] judgment.
[1:28:09] Can you say amen?
[1:28:12] Amen. Now he said you can never but it
[1:28:16] takes sorrow and repentance and the
[1:28:19] grace of God to cover sin for the blood
[1:28:21] of Jesus Christ the one that God killed
[1:28:24] at Calvary to cover sin there in the
[1:28:27] garden that morning when sin was so
[1:28:29] black and Jehovah come in there stood
[1:28:32] his couple standing condemned there
[1:28:35] would be no more human race they had to
[1:28:38] die death on the human race give the
[1:28:40] world back to the wild beast and there
[1:28:42] would be no human race. But in that
[1:28:45] darkest of hour, in that time when all
[1:28:48] hopes was gone, grace came pouring
[1:28:50] through and said, "I'll give you a
[1:28:53] savior, a Messiah." It's a wonder how
[1:28:56] God could ever do it. God's amazing
[1:28:58] grace in the Garden of Eden that come
[1:29:01] that give them the promise of a just one
[1:29:03] who would come through the woman. the
[1:29:05] woman's seed shall be bruised or shall
[1:29:07] bruise the serpent's head, the guilty
[1:29:09] one and his head shall uh bruise her
[1:29:12] heel. To to show that there would be an
[1:29:14] affliction to the church, but he
[1:29:16] promised a triumph. I'm going to read it
[1:29:19] again. To show there would be an
[1:29:20] affliction to the church, but he
[1:29:22] promised a triumph. He provided a savior
[1:29:27] grace. How could they show the to merit
[1:29:30] grace? What could they show to do it?
[1:29:33] army expression. Excuse it. I I only
[1:29:36] want to make it from my pull pit to make
[1:29:38] a point. Passing the buck, Adam, the
[1:29:41] woman, you give me did it. The woman
[1:29:43] said, "The serpent beguile me." One lady
[1:29:46] to another. There is no hopes for them.
[1:29:49] But God provided grace and it come
[1:29:54] breaking through. And he says, "I'll
[1:29:57] make a way somehow.
[1:30:01] I'll save you regardless. You've done
[1:30:04] wrong. You've trespassed my laws. My
[1:30:07] laws will have to be, but judgment from
[1:30:10] my laws will have to be executed.
[1:30:13] Therefore, I'll have to be there will
[1:30:15] have to be death. Can you say amen?
[1:30:18] Amen.
[1:30:21] Come on. Now you say now although he's
[1:30:24] talking about the capstone, well, we
[1:30:27] need to understand the foundation
[1:30:30] because the foundation was grace.
[1:30:34] When God called you and favored you and
[1:30:37] brought you in, there had to be
[1:30:43] Brother Kevin, you couldn't pick
[1:30:45] yourself up by your bootstraps.
[1:30:49] Come on. You were alcoholics, druggies.
[1:30:52] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Brother Matt
[1:30:55] right here, he was kicked out of
[1:30:56] Louisiana camp. Hallelujah. I ain't
[1:30:59] going to tell you why, but Hallelujah.
[1:31:01] He needed grace. Amen. When brother Tim
[1:31:04] Prince Grace had ran out for the camp,
[1:31:06] he had to go back home. But God's grace
[1:31:08] was still there. Amen. Grace. You see,
[1:31:11] it takes grace in your salvation. There
[1:31:14] is nothing you can do to earn the love
[1:31:18] of God. Amen. If there's somebody in
[1:31:21] here, amen, that says, "I I would be a
[1:31:23] Christian if I could quit this. I would
[1:31:26] be a Christian if I could do that."
[1:31:28] Listen, you're missing the whole point.
[1:31:30] You would not need a savior if you could
[1:31:33] do it yourself. You would not need a
[1:31:36] redeemer if you could do it yourself.
[1:31:38] You need the blood of Jesus Christ. And
[1:31:43] grace gave you
[1:31:46] blood. Grace gave you
[1:31:50] mercy. Grace came in its power and set
[1:31:54] you
[1:31:58] free. Can you say man? It was grace in
[1:32:03] your beginning and it's grace in your
[1:32:07] ending.
[1:32:12] [Applause]
[1:32:14] Amen. Grace came breaking through and
[1:32:18] said, "I'll make a way somehow
[1:32:20] regardless. I'm going to save you." Can
[1:32:23] you say, "Amen." There was only one just
[1:32:26] way. There was only one way that could
[1:32:29] be. God's great law demands could be
[1:32:33] mad. He had to meet it himself. He had
[1:32:36] to do it. God is a spirit. He can't die.
[1:32:41] So God had to be made man. And he died
[1:32:44] in a human flesh in the form of a man
[1:32:46] called Jesus Christ. That was the
[1:32:49] promised Messiah that brought the grace.
[1:32:52] And there where you see that God in
[1:32:54] Christ is the same person. God dwelling
[1:32:57] in Christ. I and my father are one. My
[1:33:00] father dwells in me. Not me that
[1:33:02] speaketh the word, but my father that
[1:33:04] dwelleth in me. God in Christ. Certainly
[1:33:07] grace was promised in the Garden of
[1:33:10] Eden, and grace came. Grace to Adam and
[1:33:13] Eve. Nowhere to go, know which way to
[1:33:16] turn. Yet grace made a way.
[1:33:22] Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] Papa seen the destruction before the
[1:33:27] destruction was even a word.
[1:33:30] Papa seen sin before sin was even a
[1:33:34] term.
[1:33:36] before the effects of sin. Come on,
[1:33:39] before the complexes,
[1:33:42] before your battles,
[1:33:45] before your lust problem,
[1:33:48] before your divorce, before your
[1:33:52] whatever it was, God seen you in your
[1:33:59] fallen condition. Amen.
[1:34:01] [Applause]
[1:34:03] Come on.
[1:34:06] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I know it's
[1:34:09] simple. Good preaching. But before sin
[1:34:13] was ever invented,
[1:34:17] the Bible says God already had a lamb
[1:34:20] slain.
[1:34:26] Why? Because God is a God of grace.
[1:34:31] and God was going to do whatever it took
[1:34:35] because he had favored you. It's
[1:34:40] unmarited. It's a love that you can
[1:34:43] never get rid
[1:34:44] of. You're never too good. You're never
[1:34:48] too bad. You can do nothing to spurn the
[1:34:53] grace and favor. Oh, y'all listen to me.
[1:34:56] You say, "Brother, but I don't want to
[1:34:58] send my day of grace away." I want to
[1:35:01] tell you, there is a bride who will
[1:35:03] never send her day of grace away. She
[1:35:06] cannot send her day of grace away. She
[1:35:11] is in his mind eternally.
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:18] Hallelujah.
[1:35:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Before sin came, there
[1:35:25] was a spotless lamb provided.
[1:35:28] And
[1:35:29] grace marked you by predestination.
[1:35:32] It don't matter the depths of sin that
[1:35:34] you were born into. It don't matter the
[1:35:37] family you're born into.
[1:35:39] The markings of grace would be forever
[1:35:43] more upon your soul
[1:35:46] because God has a divine purpose and a
[1:35:48] divine plan for you. I praise the Lord.
[1:35:52] Ephesians 1:44, according as he hath
[1:35:55] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:35:56] of the world, that we should be holy and
[1:35:59] without blame before him in love, having
[1:36:02] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:36:05] children to Jesus Christ to himself
[1:36:07] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:36:09] will. Brother Brandham would say, who
[1:36:11] did it? God. When did he do it? Before
[1:36:14] the foundation of the world. Then if we
[1:36:17] came in in in an illegitimate birth
[1:36:20] through Eve's corruption, making us all
[1:36:23] her children and subject to death, then
[1:36:26] the sovereign God has to make a way to
[1:36:31] redeem his children.
[1:36:37] He said, "All the father given me will
[1:36:39] come to me, and no man can come unless
[1:36:41] my father draws him." Oh my. Now,
[1:36:44] where's your big thing that you've done?
[1:36:46] You never done nothing. You ought to be
[1:36:48] ashamed. It's God who done all things.
[1:36:56] Amen. Good. It was God. It was grace in
[1:37:01] your foundation
[1:37:04] and it's going to be
[1:37:06] grace in your capping.
[1:37:11] it. Well, but now I know a lot, brother
[1:37:13] Wendle. Now I I I I I know a lot. I But
[1:37:17] though the Bible says, having done the
[1:37:19] will of God, having done all that you
[1:37:21] know to do, then you still come before
[1:37:24] God as unprofitable servant. You have
[1:37:26] just earned yourself one big zero. There
[1:37:29] is nothing that you can do. There's not
[1:37:31] a sermon you can preach. There's not a
[1:37:33] song you can sing. There's not a you you
[1:37:36] cannot earn the salvation of God. boys.
[1:37:39] If you're ever going to be in heaven,
[1:37:42] it's got to be because of grace. I don't
[1:37:44] care how good-looking you are. I don't
[1:37:46] care how much muscle you have. I don't
[1:37:48] care what you've got to offer. You are
[1:37:51] bound for hell unless you accept grace.
[1:37:55] You are doomed without mercy unless you
[1:37:58] accept grace. But thank God for grace.
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:08] Can you say that? It was grace that
[1:38:11] saved you, boys. It's grace that's
[1:38:14] brought you into your home. It's grace
[1:38:17] that you're raised in a church. It's
[1:38:20] grace.
[1:38:27] Oh, can you say amen?
[1:38:29] It was grace in the foundation.
[1:38:32] It's going to be grace in your
[1:38:33] finishing. Yeah. Is he not the author
[1:38:35] and the finisher?
[1:38:38] Romans 8:28, we know that all things
[1:38:40] work together for good to them that love
[1:38:42] God, to them who are the called
[1:38:44] according to his purpose. For whom he
[1:38:46] did
[1:38:47] forno he also did predestinate to be
[1:38:51] conformed to the image of his son.
[1:38:58] Did I not just tell you grace cannot
[1:39:00] fail?
[1:39:02] When Adam and Eve blew it, God moved
[1:39:06] everything in order to redeem. And when
[1:39:10] God says that every one of you are
[1:39:13] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:39:16] image of his son, that is a decree that
[1:39:20] my grace is upon thee. Well, praise the
[1:39:23] name of the Lord. My grace is there.
[1:39:27] Amen. there in first uh uh there in
[1:39:29] Philippians 1 and6 being confident of
[1:39:31] this very thing that he which hath begun
[1:39:34] a good work in you will perform it until
[1:39:37] the day of Jesus Christ
[1:39:41] Hallelujah
[1:39:43] why didn't the word come with shoutings
[1:39:44] of good
[1:39:46] works why
[1:39:49] didn't the
[1:39:51] capstone the glory of the Lord come with
[1:39:54] shoutings
[1:39:56] you better behave
[1:39:57] Hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord,
[1:40:00] brother. There is no lawkeeping church
[1:40:02] joining, turning of a new leaf. There is
[1:40:05] none of your holiness. You can do
[1:40:08] nothing to perfect yourself.
[1:40:12] Well, bless the Lord. Oh, you say, "But
[1:40:14] I quit lying and I quit stealing and I
[1:40:16] quit drinking and I quit gambling and I
[1:40:19] go to church and I've been baptized and
[1:40:21] I pay my tithe and I speak in tongues
[1:40:23] and I work miracles." That is not a sign
[1:40:26] of God's favor upon your life. That is
[1:40:29] not a sign. Are you hearing me? There's
[1:40:31] only one sign of God's favor and that's
[1:40:33] by predestination. That seed on the
[1:40:36] inside of you, Amen, that is screaming
[1:40:39] out, I must prevail. I Oh, can you say
[1:40:44] amen? I know Esau, Amen, might have came
[1:40:47] out first, but you got a hold of his
[1:40:49] heel and you're saying, I need that
[1:40:52] birthight. I'm anointed for this. I'm
[1:40:55] anointed to overcome. I'm anointed to
[1:40:58] Praise the Lord. I'm anointed.
[1:41:07] Amen.
[1:41:10] Why
[1:41:12] didn't the word come in this last day
[1:41:15] with shoutings of spiritual gifts?
[1:41:19] Manifestation of the supernatural.
[1:41:23] Amen. Because gifts and manifestations
[1:41:26] will never be able to accomplish the
[1:41:28] end. In fact, the scripture says
[1:41:30] there'll come a time where prophecy and
[1:41:33] tongues and everything will have its
[1:41:35] end. But grace can never have its end.
[1:41:40] Can you say amen? The 1906 Isusa
[1:41:44] phenomenon, Amen, gave us wonderful
[1:41:46] gifts and powerful manifestations.
[1:41:49] circled the globe and it was a glorious
[1:41:50] time. It was a glorious thing. Amen. But
[1:41:53] we found that there were partakings of
[1:41:55] good and evil. Amen. There were evil men
[1:41:58] that was using the gifts and there were
[1:42:00] good men using the gifts. What was meant
[1:42:03] for good become an entrapment. Satan's
[1:42:06] influence once again was taken over.
[1:42:08] Amen. And bringing man under captivity
[1:42:11] by
[1:42:11] denominationalism. Can you say amen?
[1:42:14] Amen. It got to the point, Amen. where
[1:42:17] we are just as as Peter said, wells
[1:42:19] without waters, cloud with no rain,
[1:42:22] carried with a tempest, with great
[1:42:24] swelling words of vanity, alluring
[1:42:26] through the lust of the flesh and
[1:42:28] promising liberty, yet servants of
[1:42:31] corruption. Amen. They try to make
[1:42:33] merchandise of you. Can you say amen?
[1:42:35] That the leotysian age would be lawless.
[1:42:38] Amen. without the word having any kind
[1:42:40] of effect. But not if it were not for
[1:42:44] grace. Where would this bride be? You
[1:42:49] would be just a leotician in some kind
[1:42:51] of a church membership. You would be
[1:42:54] some kind of a leotardian. Amen. Stuck
[1:42:56] somewhere out. Amen. But grace came in.
[1:43:00] Grace showed up. Gray. Oh, can you say
[1:43:03] amen? I was a Pentecostal. But then
[1:43:07] grace appeared to Wendle Martin. I speak
[1:43:10] in I still speak in tongues, but it
[1:43:12] wasn't enough. Grace had to come to
[1:43:15] Wendle Martin. Well, can you say amen?
[1:43:18] Amen. I've seen miracles. I've had
[1:43:20] manifestations, but that wasn't enough.
[1:43:23] But God sent us the headstone. He sent
[1:43:28] us his word. He sent us his power. His
[1:43:34] grace brought about that authority to
[1:43:38] the believer.
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:43] If not for
[1:43:45] grace, your home would be a cage of
[1:43:47] every hateful bird.
[1:43:50] Your kids would be drugged up monsters
[1:43:53] and out of their minds. Well, praise the
[1:43:56] Lord. So, we needed more than just a
[1:43:59] gift.
[1:44:00] This day demands sons of authority.
[1:44:04] And as brother Jonathan was preaching
[1:44:05] this morning, oh, glory to God. What a
[1:44:08] powerful message, huh? Amen. You see,
[1:44:12] there there is that there is that grace
[1:44:15] that God has given us. Now, I want us to
[1:44:17] look here as as brother Brandham would
[1:44:20] would talk about the influence upon the
[1:44:24] earth. And he would say, "Oh my friends,
[1:44:26] listen to thus sayaith the Lord. If you
[1:44:29] consider me to be his servant, it's just
[1:44:31] before the break of day. That's why this
[1:44:34] horrible gloom is over the earth. It's
[1:44:36] just before the coming of the Lord
[1:44:38] Jesus. There's no more hope left and
[1:44:40] nothing but is coming. Nations are
[1:44:42] against nations. They have fooled
[1:44:45] through God's laboratory till they have
[1:44:47] got the power to blow one another into
[1:44:49] atomic hashes. They're wicked. They're
[1:44:51] unreligious. They're uncristlike. Their
[1:44:54] only motive they have and objective is
[1:44:55] to destroy. They are inspired by the
[1:44:58] destroying angel that was sent from
[1:45:00] heaven to inspire these men. But let me
[1:45:03] say in the name of the Lord, the Holy
[1:45:05] Spirit has sent me as a watchman on the
[1:45:07] tower. Has these people cry, "What of
[1:45:09] the night?" Are you weary of this life?
[1:45:11] Are you weary of sin? Are you weary of
[1:45:13] funeral possessions and sickness,
[1:45:15] ungodliness on every hand? Has the night
[1:45:18] been long and weary? What of the night,
[1:45:20] watchmen? He says, "Morning comes." You
[1:45:23] see the comfort? Amen. The night is
[1:45:25] here, but the morning is coming. Now,
[1:45:28] when God foresaw in this last day that
[1:45:32] there was going to be that destruction
[1:45:34] angel, now that destruction angel wants
[1:45:37] to come near every one of our homes.
[1:45:40] Amen. They He does what it can. Amen. To
[1:45:43] to it filter your mind. Amen. You know,

[1:46:20] then it turns on you and tells you how
[1:46:23] bad you are, how ugly you are, how
[1:46:26] unworthy you are. I say that devil is a
[1:46:30] sorry devil. And that devil tries his
[1:46:34] best. Amen. To fight these these men and
[1:46:38] women, the bride of Jesus Christ. I
[1:46:41] wonder just right now in this building,
[1:46:43] how many has been fighting mind battles?
[1:46:46] Just just just just general mind
[1:46:48] battles. Raise your hand. Amen. Look at
[1:46:50] all of this. Amen. Put your hands back
[1:46:52] down. How many's been fighting
[1:46:54] depression? Amen. How many fights
[1:46:57] depression? Amen. It's okay to raise
[1:46:59] your hand. Amen. See all how Satan comes
[1:47:02] in and he wants to make you feel that
[1:47:05] you're unworthy, that you're not loved,
[1:47:08] that you're subpar. Well, praise the
[1:47:11] Lord. Amen. It's a destruction devil.
[1:47:14] Amen. It's a destruction devil that has
[1:47:16] brought this pornography into our I into
[1:47:19] our circles and even infiltrated inside
[1:47:22] our churches. Amen. Until men, Amen, are
[1:47:25] looking at it. Amen. And in these days,
[1:47:27] there are women that are looking because
[1:47:30] there is a destruction devil that wants
[1:47:33] to tear you up. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:47:36] Amen. It makes your wife feel, Amen.
[1:47:38] dirty. It makes you feel dirty. It makes
[1:47:41] everyone feel like they're unworthy.
[1:47:44] Amen. And it's a spirit we allow on the
[1:47:47] inside of our homes. But I want to tell
[1:47:50] you today, amen, that that mighty, that
[1:47:52] mighty capstone is not just a slang.
[1:47:57] It's not just a saying. It's not just a
[1:48:01] doctrine in the message church, but that
[1:48:04] capstone is authority. That capstone is
[1:48:08] God laying claims on his sons and
[1:48:13] daughters. It's God coming out in grace
[1:48:17] and saying, "Leave them
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:27] alone. That's grace."
[1:48:31] Amen. Amen. You get lost on that
[1:48:33] internet.
[1:48:35] Amen.
[1:48:36] It's a destruction angel. It's a
[1:48:39] destroying angel wanting to destroy your
[1:48:43] marriage
[1:48:44] until divorces have become pretty common
[1:48:48] in our message circles.
[1:48:50] Amen. Why? Because there is a destroying
[1:48:54] angel.
[1:48:56] Are you hearing me? But
[1:48:59] grace. Grace.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. He doesn't want you just
[1:49:05] being a headless woman. He doesn't want
[1:49:08] the church without headship.
[1:49:10] He doesn't want the church just
[1:49:12] satisfied with feelings and
[1:49:16] emotions. Praise the Lord. Satan wants
[1:49:19] you on emotions. Satan loved the 1906
[1:49:22] because it produced motions. And Satan
[1:49:25] got into the emotions and he could act
[1:49:28] out. He could do whatever he wanted to
[1:49:30] do. He could be living with somebody
[1:49:33] else's wife and still speak in tongues.
[1:49:35] He could be out preaching and still
[1:49:38] Well, come on, church. You might as well
[1:49:39] help me preach. That was what the devil
[1:49:43] wanted.
[1:49:48] Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:49:51] Will you hear me?
[1:49:53] But then grace. Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:49:59] But then grace, grace
[1:50:02] says, "Oh great mountain,
[1:50:07] who do you think you are?
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:11] [Applause]
[1:50:13] Oh, great mountain trying to stop
[1:50:18] God's elect trying to stop this rapture,
[1:50:22] trying to stop sunship, trying to stop
[1:50:26] the anointing of the
[1:50:30] word. Who are you that resists the plan
[1:50:35] of God?
[1:50:36] [Applause]
[1:50:42] You say amen.
[1:50:44] Amen. Yes, sir. But when the destruction
[1:50:47] angel is
[1:50:49] here, he says, now Ro, Revelations 10
[1:50:54] says, but I saw another mighty angel.
[1:50:57] Now, those destruction angels are mighty
[1:50:59] angels. Those destruction angels,
[1:51:02] they're mighty.
[1:51:05] Oh, yeah, they're mighty. But I saw
[1:51:07] another mighty angel. and he was clothed
[1:51:10] with a cloud.
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:15] I saw another mighty angel. There's the
[1:51:18] angel of destruction. There's the angel
[1:51:21] that's going to destroy this earth once
[1:51:23] you're out of here. There's the angel
[1:51:25] that is anointing this world and the
[1:51:27] movies and all of that. It's anointing
[1:51:30] it. But God says, "I saw
[1:51:32] another mighty
[1:51:35] angel, not to bring you in bondage, not
[1:51:39] to cause you to go to prison, but to
[1:51:42] bring you in authority.
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:51:51] There was another mighty angel
[1:51:53] and he was clothed in a
[1:51:56] cloud. He was a rainbow covenant.
[1:52:00] the one. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:04] Oh, glory to God. When brother Brandham
[1:52:05] talks about that rainbow there in in
[1:52:07] Revelations the 4th chapter, he says it
[1:52:09] was the fulfillment. It wasn't just the
[1:52:12] promisegiver, but now it's the
[1:52:14] fulfillment, the full rainbow. We've
[1:52:17] only saw half the rainbow. We've only g
[1:52:20] the promise. There is a promise. But
[1:52:23] there around that throne is the full
[1:52:27] rainbow. The one who gave it is the one
[1:52:30] who's going to keep it. The one who's
[1:52:34] called you has now brought you to
[1:52:36] himself. The one who said, "I'm going to
[1:52:39] take you back to Eden." is the same one
[1:52:42] who has kept his word.
[1:52:50] Can you say amen?
[1:52:52] There was another mighty
[1:52:53] angel. This mighty angel was clothed
[1:52:56] with a cloud.
[1:52:59] and he put one foot on
[1:53:03] land and he put one foot on sea.
[1:53:07] Now, my way of thinking, there's a
[1:53:09] reason why it was symbolic of the land
[1:53:12] and
[1:53:14] sea because there was a beast that come
[1:53:16] up out of the land, the
[1:53:20] USA,
[1:53:22] Hollywood. Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:26] and all of the sin, the perversions. And
[1:53:28] there was a beast that come up out of
[1:53:30] the multitudes, peoples, tongues, Rome.
[1:53:34] Can you say amen? And these have ruled
[1:53:37] over you. Denominationalism has ruled
[1:53:39] over you. And it has kept you in a
[1:53:42] prison house. It has kept you under its
[1:53:44] authority. It has kept you under Satan
[1:53:47] don't mind you coming to this tent as
[1:53:49] long as you don't accept the headship of
[1:53:52] this word.
[1:53:56] Well, can you say amen? And there's
[1:53:58] going to be many that comes in and hears
[1:53:59] it, but they're not going to accept the
[1:54:01] headship of the word. But it could be
[1:54:04] because that's not what they came from.
[1:54:06] But God's got a seed. God don't You
[1:54:10] might not know who's all out here. I
[1:54:12] might not know who who is who out here.
[1:54:15] But God planted a seed. God
[1:54:18] predestinated your soul. God placed his
[1:54:22] word in you before there was even
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:29] sin. Oh, I'm feeling good about right
[1:54:32] now. Hallelujah. Because that Amen. that
[1:54:36] mighty cloud. Can you put that cloud up?
[1:54:37] I wonder. Do y'all have that cloud?
[1:54:39] Amen. When that cloud Amen. It's not
[1:54:42] just a cloud. It is
[1:54:46] grace. It is grace.
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:52] It's God coming and opening the book and
[1:54:56] giving you
[1:54:57] authority to overcome
[1:55:01] the who have vowed to kill you and
[1:55:04] destroy
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:09] you. But you know what? That cloud is a
[1:55:13] magnet.
[1:55:14] That cloud's a magnet.
[1:55:17] I said, "God's got a magnet up in the
[1:55:20] sky. It ain't going to call the dirt. It
[1:55:23] ain't going to call the rocks. It ain't
[1:55:25] going to call the sticks. It ain't going
[1:55:27] to pick up anything else. But those
[1:55:30] eternal seeds that were in God before
[1:55:33] the foundation of the world, when this
[1:55:35] magnet comes, it's pulling you up. It's
[1:55:38] pulling you out of pornography. It's
[1:55:41] pulling you out of cesspools of sin.
[1:55:44] It's pulling you out. Come on, church.
[1:55:47] Amen. What are we doing? We are like
[1:55:50] him. Oh, church of the living God. If
[1:55:53] you could understand, you're not begging
[1:55:55] God for grace. His grace is here. You're
[1:55:59] not begging God for mercy. His mercy is
[1:56:02] here. You're not begging God for
[1:56:05] anything. Stand upon the promise that
[1:56:08] God has given you.
[1:56:15] Is there anybody under the tent can
[1:56:18] shout grace,
[1:56:21] grace,
[1:56:22] grace,
[1:56:24] grace,
[1:56:26] grace. It's grace.
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:35] Oh, can you say amen?
[1:56:37] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] Do you remember God's three-fold
[1:56:41] purpose? Yes, sir. What was the
[1:56:44] three-fold purpose? God revealing
[1:56:47] himself in Christ.
[1:56:52] Having preeminence in his body,
[1:56:56] taking us
[1:56:57] away to Eden. What can you say? Amen.
[1:57:02] What's the three stages of the rapture?
[1:57:04] The shout,
[1:57:08] the revealing of God in flesh,
[1:57:12] well, the trumpet message of a prophet
[1:57:14] coming in and
[1:57:16] declaring the word and gathering the
[1:57:19] elect. What's the second phase of the
[1:57:22] rapture? The voice, the preeminence in
[1:57:26] the bride. She under her messenger
[1:57:29] becomes the final voice. Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] Amen. I had to do a lot of editing to my
[1:57:35] sermon. I I I I was all all when brother
[1:57:38] Jonathan I I was having a hard time
[1:57:39] amening him and then I'd sit down and
[1:57:41] say, "Ain't going to do it again." And
[1:57:42] then I was back on my feet again.
[1:57:43] Hallelujah. Brother Jonathan was
[1:57:45] preaching all over my sermon this
[1:57:46] morning. Hallelujah. So I I I I but I I
[1:57:49] I just want to deal with the grace part
[1:57:51] here tonight. Amen. Listen to me. Amen.
[1:57:54] The preeminence in the bride. Now Now
[1:57:57] listen. What is the first stage of the
[1:58:00] rapture? The shout. The shout, the
[1:58:04] message, the headstone coming down. Come
[1:58:08] on now. Amen. And that headstone
[1:58:12] anointing a bride, God having
[1:58:15] preeminence within her. Amen. What does
[1:58:19] this mean? We talk about it. We sing
[1:58:21] about it. We amen it. What does this
[1:58:24] mean? It means the word is going to live
[1:58:29] in your body.
[1:58:32] Yes, sir.
[1:58:34] Amen. That means the word takes
[1:58:37] preeminence. Can you say amen?
[1:58:41] Of course, we're waiting for the
[1:58:42] physical return, the trumpet to sound,
[1:58:46] the trump of God, the resurrection, the
[1:58:48] catching away. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:58:51] Amen.
[1:58:52] Now, I want us to look here because the
[1:58:57] bride eating the
[1:58:59] book and now taking on its
[1:59:02] identification. And we're fixing to have
[1:59:03] a prayer line here here before long now.
[1:59:08] And we are to
[1:59:10] live under the inspiration
[1:59:15] of that mighty angel.
[1:59:19] Now watch that mighty angel again. The
[1:59:21] mighty
[1:59:22] angel clothed in a cloud. That's the
[1:59:25] rainbow covenant. That's angel of the
[1:59:28] covenant. He's come with a book in his
[1:59:31] hand that is open.
[1:59:34] It is your
[1:59:35] inheritance. It is God telling you you
[1:59:39] have authority
[1:59:42] through the anointing that is upon this
[1:59:44] earth. Yes, sir. All right. Come on. And
[1:59:47] you're going to overcome. Now, as they
[1:59:50] said this morning or or either this
[1:59:51] morning or last night, the headship of
[1:59:54] Christ must rest upon the body of
[1:59:57] Christ.
[1:59:58] And the church is God's earthly
[2:00:01] strength.
[2:00:03] It is God's earthly Can you say amen?
[2:00:07] What does this mean? That there is
[2:00:10] authority
[2:00:12] laying in you. Come on. There is an
[2:00:15] authority. You might not feel it. You
[2:00:19] might not understand it. You might Well,
[2:00:21] praise the Lord. But that authority is
[2:00:25] there by God's grace.
[2:00:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:35] I was thinking as as brother Jonathan
[2:00:39] had had had quoted the quote on the
[2:00:44] inspiration and I thought about that
[2:00:46] inspiration and how that amen that the
[2:00:50] these men amen were living under the the
[2:00:55] inspiration and that the bride can do
[2:00:57] nothing than the powers that were
[2:00:59] released to
[2:01:01] her. and and and and brother Brandham
[2:01:03] would talk about those that whether they
[2:01:05] was under the lion, ox, or man
[2:01:07] anointing. Amen. They were under the
[2:01:10] inspiration, the spirit of God, the
[2:01:12] power. And he says, "And don't forget
[2:01:14] this church. You brethren are on tapes.
[2:01:16] I want you to examine this. How could
[2:01:18] men do anything else besides the power
[2:01:20] of God that has been released to them?
[2:01:23] If God sends a certain spirit among
[2:01:25] them, that's the only thing they can
[2:01:27] work by is the spirit that works among
[2:01:30] them. And I will prove to you by the
[2:01:33] history of the church and by the opening
[2:01:34] of the seals and the powers they let
[2:01:36] loose. Exactly. The church responded to
[2:01:38] the anointing and they couldn't do
[2:01:41] nothing else.
[2:01:43] It was grace.
[2:01:45] Well, can you say amen? Amen. Oh, if we
[2:01:49] could if we could just come under the
[2:01:52] grace now as we are as we are
[2:01:56] turning a page and just sort of another
[2:01:59] area real quick. The
[2:02:02] inspiration of this
[2:02:07] message is not dos and don'ts. The
[2:02:10] inspiration of this message is
[2:02:11] [Music]
[2:02:12] not it. We already had the dos and the
[2:02:15] don'ts.
[2:02:18] We already had all of those things. I
[2:02:20] was raised in and in in the apostolic
[2:02:22] circles. We had that down pretty good.
[2:02:25] Hallelujah. And
[2:02:28] uh listen, I could tell you stories
[2:02:30] about all the dos and the don'ts. But
[2:02:33] that could never produce
[2:02:36] anything. Right.
[2:02:39] But what this message has brought is an
[2:02:43] inspiration to set us free from the
[2:02:48] bondages, the yolks of denominationalism
[2:02:55] to make it a very clear and absolute
[2:02:59] picture of you and Christ.
[2:03:04] Do you know that that's what God is
[2:03:05] wanting right now? God is looking for
[2:03:07] fellowship. God's wanting fellowship
[2:03:09] right now. He's not wanting fellowship
[2:03:11] at church. He's not wanting fellowship
[2:03:14] uh uh uh you know just just when you
[2:03:17] when when you read your Bible once a
[2:03:18] month. But God is wanting fellowship
[2:03:21] with you on a daily basis.
[2:03:27] God's grace is here to restore
[2:03:31] fellowship.
[2:03:34] Yeah. Can you say amen?
[2:03:37] Now, brother, brother Brandham would
[2:03:40] say, now it's a the inspiration. He's
[2:03:44] talking about the inspiration on the
[2:03:45] earth. The unbeliever will never know
[2:03:47] anything about it. He says the natural
[2:03:49] will never be able to interpret the the
[2:03:51] the supernatural. Neither can the
[2:03:53] magician. And the astrologers ever uh
[2:03:57] read the handwriting on the raw. It took
[2:04:00] a spiritfilled man to do it. those
[2:04:02] astrologers couldn't could never read
[2:04:05] the unknown tongue and and they they had
[2:04:07] not the gift of the interpretation and
[2:04:09] know the supernatural. Therefore, they
[2:04:11] didn't know what it was about. They
[2:04:13] dillydallied around with the rock and
[2:04:15] roll parties and the shindigs and and
[2:04:17] this that and the other. And the
[2:04:18] gospel's just been neglected. They know
[2:04:20] nothing about the supernatural. They
[2:04:22] said, "But but" but he says, "But the
[2:04:23] spiritual people, the born again, knows
[2:04:26] that something's fixing to happen and
[2:04:28] they're happy about it because it's the
[2:04:30] coming of the Lord Jesus the second time
[2:04:33] for his
[2:04:34] church." Amen. It says, "But the
[2:04:37] unsaved, they don't know what it's all
[2:04:39] about. It seems, Amen. to be just a
[2:04:43] supernatural move." Can you say amen?
[2:04:47] There's nothing there to inspire.
[2:04:49] There's nothing there to relate. there's
[2:04:52] nothing there to respond with.
[2:04:56] But while you're in your trial, while
[2:04:59] you're in your
[2:05:01] situation, yet the grace of God's
[2:05:04] planted the seed of God to respond to
[2:05:08] that inspiration of God.
[2:05:12] Well, praise the Lord. Brother Brandon
[2:05:14] would talk about the Shounamite woman.
[2:05:17] He says the inspiration struck her.
[2:05:19] Amen.
[2:05:21] Now, now she here she was says, "When
[2:05:24] the woman realized that this inspiration
[2:05:26] was upon her, she obeyed exactly because
[2:05:29] she knowed it was in harmony with the
[2:05:33] supernatural." Now, here she was in her
[2:05:36] plague. She was in her She was in her
[2:05:38] bottom of the barrel. She was Amen. They
[2:05:41] were fixing to die. But when God sent
[2:05:44] the prophet, when God sent that
[2:05:47] anointing there, there was an
[2:05:49] inspiration that struck her and she
[2:05:53] suddenly obeyed that inspiration and
[2:05:57] brought about the results in her life.
[2:06:00] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:06:04] He says, "What are you talking about,
[2:06:05] Brother Brandham? I'm trying to base
[2:06:08] your faith on a level with God being
[2:06:10] almighty, supreme, all powerful, and
[2:06:14] omnipotent. He hasn't changed. His
[2:06:16] nature doesn't change. My nature may
[2:06:19] change. Yours might change, but God's
[2:06:21] nature will never change. If he's still
[2:06:24] the great God, Jehovah, that created the
[2:06:26] heavens and the earth and had all powers
[2:06:28] in his hand, he's still that same
[2:06:30] Jehovah tonight.
[2:06:33] If he's almighty God, he can do all
[2:06:35] things. If he can't do all things, he's
[2:06:38] not almighty God. Inspiration tells you
[2:06:40] that. Reasonings will say it's not so.
[2:06:43] But
[2:06:44] inspiration says it's so.
[2:06:48] And inspiration from the soul and not
[2:06:51] from the mind. Can you say amen?
[2:06:55] Now, as we begin to think here this
[2:06:57] evening and we begin to think about
[2:06:59] this, whatever you have need of,
[2:07:02] preachers are going to lay their hands
[2:07:04] upon you. But there's not a man that has
[2:07:07] any kind of a power. We're just obeying
[2:07:10] the inspiration.
[2:07:12] The inspiration that is here today is
[2:07:15] bringing about it's the same miracle
[2:07:19] working God that has saved you in the
[2:07:22] beginning is that same miracle working
[2:07:25] God to heal your bodies.
[2:07:28] Can you say amen?
[2:07:30] Now, talking about this inspiration,
[2:07:32] Brother Brandham would say, "No matter
[2:07:35] how religious you are, how many churches
[2:07:37] you belong to, how many books your
[2:07:39] name's on, if that genuine Holy Ghost is
[2:07:42] in you, which is the word manifested,
[2:07:44] you'll see the message in the hour
[2:07:46] because it's the Holy Ghost that does
[2:07:48] it." But there has to be something like
[2:07:50] that off that inspiration to strike you.
[2:07:54] If you pour water on the ground, on the
[2:07:55] ground on the ground, there's no seed
[2:07:57] there in there to strike it. How can it
[2:07:59] ever bring forth anything? There's
[2:08:01] nothing there to bring it. Someone shout
[2:08:04] hallelujah.
[2:08:05] That is that only the elect will see it.
[2:08:11] The elect of God seen it in Noah's time,
[2:08:13] Moses time, Jesus' time, Apostles time,
[2:08:16] Luther's time, Wesley's time,
[2:08:18] Pentecostal time, because that was the
[2:08:21] seed that was on the earth when this
[2:08:24] inspiration was poured out. Now, when
[2:08:26] the inspiration's poured out together,
[2:08:29] the bride together, it's only those who
[2:08:33] are elected will see it.
[2:08:38] Oh, I want y'all now, now, don't get
[2:08:40] tired on me quite yet because we're
[2:08:41] fixing to I I want you to really catch
[2:08:43] this. When the inspiration is spoil is
[2:08:46] beginning to be poured out, the
[2:08:48] anointing is there to strike that seed.
[2:08:53] What are you feeling during these
[2:08:55] meetings? What are you What are you
[2:08:57] feeling right now? It's the inspiration
[2:09:00] upon that word that is bringing it to
[2:09:04] life.
[2:09:05] Can you say amen? Now, when the
[2:09:09] inspiration Amen. Now, brother Brennham
[2:09:11] would say, Jesus said, "I thank thee,
[2:09:13] Father, that thou has hid these things
[2:09:16] from the wise, eyes of the wise and
[2:09:18] prudent, and revealed it to babes such
[2:09:20] as we'll learn." Now inspiration has to
[2:09:22] strike that. Amen. When the inspiration
[2:09:25] struck him, it did it. He had it then.
[2:09:28] That and we find out there comes a time
[2:09:31] when these crisises when the press is
[2:09:34] right on and you look today and look at
[2:09:36] the condition we're living in. Aren't we
[2:09:38] living in a modern Sodom and Gomorrah?
[2:09:40] Hasn't the world come back? That was a
[2:09:42] gentile world that was destroyed then by
[2:09:45] fire. Didn't Jesus say in St. Luke
[2:09:48] 17:28? Amen. 29 and 30. As it was in the
[2:09:52] days of Sodom, so shall it be in the
[2:09:53] revealing or the coming of the son of
[2:09:55] man. When the son of man is being
[2:09:56] revealed, what is revealed? It's a
[2:09:58] secret made known. A revelation is to
[2:10:01] reveal or make known a secret. And these
[2:10:05] things have been hid all through the
[2:10:07] church ages is now being made
[2:10:11] known.
[2:10:13] Revealed. Can you say amen? Now, what
[2:10:16] does this mean? What what what does this
[2:10:18] mean? It is a time of release. It is a
[2:10:21] time. Amen. As brother Jonathan was
[2:10:23] saying this morning is a time where God
[2:10:26] steps and says time shall be no more.
[2:10:32] It's the
[2:10:34] season that God is doing his claiming
[2:10:37] work. And that claiming work, what is
[2:10:40] the claiming work? Do do you do you
[2:10:42] believe sugar diabetes is of the Lord?
[2:10:45] Do you believe Amen. A high blood
[2:10:47] pressure is of the Lord. Cancer is of
[2:10:50] the Lord. It the sickness didn't come
[2:10:52] from God. That's part of the curse.
[2:10:58] The anointing is here.
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:03] The revelation is here. Yes, sir. Saying
[2:11:07] that he is here.
[2:11:12] Can you say amen?
[2:11:14] It's a time of release. It's the time
[2:11:17] when broken if where destruction, Amen.
[2:11:22] every power of destruction is to let
[2:11:24] loose. This is time grace is reaching.
[2:11:29] Amen. Coming to its pinnacle. Oh, don't
[2:11:32] you just love him here tonight? Amen.
[2:11:35] Oh, I love the Lord Jesus here tonight.
[2:11:39] Now, amen. As we get ready, I'm going to
[2:11:43] turn it back to your pastor here in just
[2:11:45] a
[2:11:47] minute. If you know that the anointing
[2:11:51] is
[2:11:52] here, what do what what do I say when I
[2:11:55] say grace? Grace to the
[2:11:58] capstone? That means I'm accepting it
[2:12:01] through faith. All right?
[2:12:04] If grace is here, the Bible says that we
[2:12:07] have access into this grace by faith.
[2:12:12] This grace must be accessed by faith.
[2:12:21] Oh, glory to God. Go ahead.
[2:12:24] If grace is here,
[2:12:27] then it behooves me to reach out in
[2:12:31] faith to access that.
[2:12:36] Did you notice that the that that that
[2:12:38] the Bible said that in this leodyian
[2:12:42] church, Christ would be knocking on a
[2:12:44] door? Did you know that brother Brandham
[2:12:47] says that that fa that you're you have
[2:12:49] the door of faith?
[2:12:52] and that you've got to open that door of
[2:12:55] faith. You got Hallelujah.
[2:12:59] We can all Oh, brother, if we could just
[2:13:01] see God's grace. Now, we we've had it
[2:13:03] painted all under this tent for the last
[2:13:05] Amen. Five services. We've we've It's
[2:13:08] been wonderful. It's been glorious. But
[2:13:10] what I'm wanting you to do tonight is
[2:13:11] just open that door of faith and walk
[2:13:13] into God's great big arcade and say,
[2:13:15] "God, I want everything that you have
[2:13:17] given me."
[2:13:20] [Applause]
[2:13:21] If this great anointing has brought all
[2:13:25] things, if this great anointing has
[2:13:28] placed the book back in my hands, if
[2:13:31] this great anointing has opened up who I
[2:13:34] am, then let me open that door of faith,
[2:13:40] let me walk in and have access into that
[2:13:44] grace.
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:48] Hallelujah. Access into that grace. Oh,
[2:13:51] can you say amen? Amen. Access. That
[2:13:54] means you're going to have to believe
[2:13:55] God. Amen. I don't care what kind of a
[2:13:57] mind battle you're going through right
[2:13:59] now. I'm going to believe God. Amen.
[2:14:02] Brother Sean talked about my mama the
[2:14:04] other day and how that she had to go.
[2:14:06] Amen. She went for nine months. Nine
[2:14:08] months just and she's getting weaker and
[2:14:10] weaker. Amen. And and her platelets she
[2:14:13] couldn't she her platelets just kept
[2:14:15] dropping and dropping and she was going
[2:14:17] through transfusions. Amen. and and and
[2:14:20] blood transfusions there and take an all
[2:14:22] day deal. Then she was having to have
[2:14:24] infusions and she was having and my
[2:14:27] mama's a woman of faith. Amen. She loved
[2:14:30] God and she's had all kinds of miracles,
[2:14:32] but it wasn't happening. It didn't seem
[2:14:34] like it was happening the first month,
[2:14:36] the second month, the third month. But
[2:14:38] mama had to keep on. She had to keep
[2:14:40] that word. She had to understand that
[2:14:43] that headship meant more to her than
[2:14:47] cancer.
[2:14:49] That headship had to mean more to her
[2:14:52] than her pain. That headship had to mean
[2:14:55] more to her than what she was feeling.
[2:14:58] And she kept on acclaiming. She kept on
[2:15:00] acclaiming. She kept Well, praise the
[2:15:03] Lord. Amen. Oh, every time she'd go to
[2:15:05] the doctor, do she would say, "Oh,
[2:15:07] doctor." Amen. What's it look like? The
[2:15:09] doctor says, "Listen, you're going to
[2:15:10] have this the rest of your life." Amen.
[2:15:12] If you're going to stay alive, you're
[2:15:13] going to have to we're going to give you
[2:15:14] these these these shots. And she was
[2:15:17] having these shot. I mean I mean we're
[2:15:18] talking about tens of thousands of
[2:15:20] dollars a month. Amen. Just for mama to
[2:15:22] stay alive. Amen. It was it was a bad
[2:15:25] situation. But there was one day Oh,
[2:15:28] hallelujah. There was one day you walked
[2:15:31] into that office and the doctor said,
[2:15:33] "Oh my goodness, your platelets are so
[2:15:37] far out the roof. What was it?" She
[2:15:41] stand there under the inspiration.
[2:15:46] She chose to obey the inspiration that
[2:15:50] was upon the earth. Somebody's got to
[2:15:53] fight to obey. Somebody's got to fight.
[2:15:56] Amen. To stand for your rights.
[2:16:01] Just because the headship has come does
[2:16:03] not mean it's all handed to you. That
[2:16:06] simply means you've got the word of
[2:16:09] authority. Fight.
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:16] That's right. Brother Merl Applegate
[2:16:19] back here in the back, the blue
[2:16:21] shirt. Amen. He had been diagnosed with
[2:16:25] hyper
[2:16:26] thyroid and um and and I'm telling you,
[2:16:30] he had got down to skin and bones. I
[2:16:32] mean, he had got down to so much.
[2:16:34] Hallelujah. And it and it he he would he
[2:16:38] couldn't eat. Anytime he'd eat, he'd
[2:16:40] throw up, smell food, whatever. He just
[2:16:43] it was just it was just it was so bad.
[2:16:46] Hallelujah. Taking medication but there
[2:16:48] he was and he went for months and months
[2:16:51] and months. Hallelujah. Oh my. But but
[2:16:54] he was standing there. He kept on
[2:16:56] claiming God says by his stripes I am
[2:16:59] healed. Now back in in in any other age
[2:17:02] it was all there but we are under an
[2:17:07] inspiration. This inspiration that is
[2:17:10] upon the bride. What? What do you What
[2:17:12] are you talking about? I'm saying there
[2:17:14] is a prophet ministry that has placed
[2:17:18] you in the Bible and has told you who
[2:17:21] you are. You are not. It used to be that
[2:17:24] God would raise up a Smith Wigglesworth
[2:17:27] or God would raise up this great man or
[2:17:30] that great man. But we are in the
[2:17:33] finality. We're not in a one-man
[2:17:35] ministry anymore. We're in the blood of
[2:17:39] Jesus Christ.
[2:17:41] And we're all standing there fighting
[2:17:44] the devil for our rights.
[2:17:50] Amen.
[2:17:54] Hallelujah. Brother Merl, Sister Lee
[2:17:56] would tell on him from time to time.
[2:17:58] She'd call me, "He's not listening. He's
[2:18:01] he's he's out doing this." Brother Merl
[2:18:03] wasn't going to let that devil keep him
[2:18:04] down. Hallelujah. He just kept on
[2:18:08] confessing. She called me one day and
[2:18:10] there she says, "Man, he just walked in
[2:18:11] the door and just fell out. He's he's
[2:18:13] he's hang he's halfway in and halfway
[2:18:15] out." Brother Window, I we got to have
[2:18:17] an answer. Amen. And there there he was.
[2:18:19] And we all gathered together. You
[2:18:21] remember that? We all we all went over
[2:18:23] and prayed with brother Merl. Amen. And
[2:18:25] believe and I want to tell you right
[2:18:27] now, God touched brother Merl. He is not
[2:18:30] There he is standing there with his
[2:18:31] hands up. No medication. He was going to
[2:18:35] have to have that medication the rest of
[2:18:37] his life.
[2:18:38] when
[2:18:39] God God's
[2:18:42] grace grace came on
[2:18:46] him. Oh my. But it took a fight. It took
[2:18:50] a fight. It took a fight. It's going to
[2:18:53] take a fight. It's going to take a
[2:18:55] fight. Can you see? Amen. Amen. It's
[2:18:59] going to take a fight. But it's grace.
[2:19:01] Grace is here. Grace is here. Put
[2:19:03] yourself in that. Put yourself in that
[2:19:06] cloud. Put yourself under that
[2:19:08] inspiration.
[2:19:13] Can you say amen? Amen. I looking there
[2:19:16] at dad. Dad's got that Parkinson's and
[2:19:18] that that Parkinson's is just whooping
[2:19:21] on him.
[2:19:23] Hallelujah. And and and dad would go
[2:19:26] down. Amen. He he got to where he
[2:19:28] couldn't even he couldn't walk. He
[2:19:31] couldn't he he his legs weren't moving.
[2:19:33] They Parkinson's effects. Amen. the
[2:19:35] neurolog the nerves the neurological uh
[2:19:38] part of your body and he just he he he
[2:19:41] just things weren't working but he just
[2:19:43] kept on believing. Amen. The other day
[2:19:45] he got up. He was now listen he he he
[2:19:49] was he he he was in a walker and he
[2:19:51] wasn't even doing much on that walker.
[2:19:53] He couldn't get he couldn't move.
[2:19:54] Hallelujah. But the other day he got up
[2:19:57] took off a walking without without his
[2:20:00] without his cane.
[2:20:03] We told him, "Put your cane. Take your
[2:20:05] cane with you." Amen. And but that and
[2:20:09] he's still he's still here tonight. He's
[2:20:11] got his cane. Now, now you say, "Well,
[2:20:13] yeah, but he's still moves a little
[2:20:17] weird." And he's still he's still
[2:20:19] Listen, he's fighting.
[2:20:22] He's
[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:25] fighting. Are you young people listening
[2:20:27] to me? He has made every service under
[2:20:30] this tent. You know why? Because he's
[2:20:32] fighting for his
[2:20:38] inheritance. You know what I
[2:20:41] believe? I believe grace has given him
[2:20:44] his
[2:20:47] healing. The devil might want to give it
[2:20:49] back. And it might be a fighting, but
[2:20:51] it's already done. Thou mountain, who
[2:20:55] are you? Who are you to resist this
[2:21:01] grace? Who are you to resist my faith?
[2:21:05] God gave me this grace. God gave me this
[2:21:09] authority. God gave me this open book.
[2:21:12] [Applause]
[2:21:16] Can you say amen?
[2:21:18] I'm going to
[2:21:19] obey that inspiration.
[2:21:23] I'm under that headship. Amen.
[2:21:28] Hallelujah.
[2:21:30] Can you say amen?
[2:21:34] Hannah
[2:21:36] McLaren. Hannah Wallace. Hallelujah. She
[2:21:39] was a McLaren. Amen. Wanted the baptism
[2:21:42] of the Holy Ghost. Told this a few
[2:21:44] times, but she's wanted the baptism of
[2:21:45] the Holy Ghost when she was a kid. Amen.
[2:21:48] And she'd come to that Louis she she
[2:21:50] made up her mind. She was going to go to
[2:21:52] Louisiana camp. She was going to get the
[2:21:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost. She had been
[2:21:56] fasting and praying. She gets down
[2:21:58] there. Amen. She wasn't eating even
[2:22:00] there at camp. And she was staying all
[2:22:02] day long. She'd come to service after
[2:22:04] service wanting the Holy Ghost while
[2:22:06] everyone else is out playing. Amen. She
[2:22:09] was right there in in in in in her seat
[2:22:12] seeking the Holy Ghost. She wanted the
[2:22:13] Holy Ghost. First service, second
[2:22:15] service, third service, fourth service,
[2:22:17] fifth service. Amen. And it didn't seem
[2:22:20] like she was going to get the Holy
[2:22:21] Ghost, but she knew that God gave her
[2:22:24] that promise. She knew that God and she
[2:22:28] was willing to put up a fight. What I'm
[2:22:31] thinking today is there's not enough of
[2:22:33] us that want to fight. We don't want to
[2:22:36] fight for the blessings. We don't want
[2:22:38] to fight. But brother Jonathan brought
[2:22:40] it out so beautifully. And I know I'm
[2:22:41] just repeating a lot of stuff that he's
[2:22:43] already said here this morning, but I
[2:22:45] just want to tell you, Amen. You got to
[2:22:47] fight. Amen. You've got to fight for
[2:22:49] this. The prince of the power of the air
[2:22:52] is not going to let you into those
[2:22:53] heavenly places. They're not going to
[2:22:55] let you just walk in. They're not. But
[2:22:57] I'm here to tell you that cloud gave you
[2:23:02] permission. That cloud gave you
[2:23:05] authority in saying go on you will
[2:23:11] win.
[2:23:13] Fight. Fight for your God-given right.
[2:23:16] Fight against that depression. Fight
[2:23:19] against that cancer. Fight.
[2:23:27] Can you say amen?
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:31] And that
[2:23:32] faith will bring you into access
[2:23:36] to the grace that has been given in this
[2:23:39] day.
[2:23:41] Oh God. Can you say amen? Amen. We had a
[2:23:45] lady in our church who's been Amen. her
[2:23:50] her her pancreas is not
[2:23:53] working. So, they're having to give her
[2:23:56] enzymes. Amen. Weekly enzymes and give
[2:24:00] her shots because it's not working.
[2:24:03] Hallelujah. And she'd been struggling in
[2:24:05] and out of the hospital. Been in the
[2:24:06] hospitals a lot and just oh am I. But
[2:24:09] during the Oklahoma camp, hallelujah.
[2:24:12] During that prayer line, she didn't even
[2:24:14] go through the prayer line. She was
[2:24:15] holding the babies for somebody else to
[2:24:16] go through the prayer line. And she said
[2:24:18] something came down and touched her. She
[2:24:21] went back to the doctor on that Monday
[2:24:23] to get her her routine shot. And the
[2:24:26] doctor says, "Oh my, your pancreas is
[2:24:29] increased. They are making it it's
[2:24:31] making its own enzymes." Went back the
[2:24:33] second week. Wow, it's making its own
[2:24:36] enzymes. Amen. Told him, "Don't even
[2:24:38] come back. Your pancreas is just fine.
[2:24:42] But it took a
[2:24:43] [Music]
[2:24:44] [Applause]
[2:24:47] fight. Come on,
[2:24:50] church. How many fighters do we have in

[3:02:28] I'm coming back to the heart of
[3:02:33] worship when it's all about
[3:02:38] you. It's all about you,
[3:02:43] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[3:02:48] I've made.
[3:02:51] When it's all about
[3:02:54] you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[3:03:05] When the music
[3:03:08] fades and all are stripped
[3:03:12] away and I simply
[3:03:18] [Music]
[3:03:20] come, longing just to
[3:03:24] breathe something that's of
[3:03:27] worth that will bless your heart.
[3:03:35] I'll bring you more than a
[3:03:39] song. For a song in
[3:03:42] itself, it's not what you have
[3:03:46] [Music]
[3:03:50] required. You search much deeper
[3:03:54] within through the way things appear.
[3:03:59] You're looking
[3:04:00] into my
[3:04:03] [Music]
[3:04:05] heart. I'm coming back to the heart of
[3:04:12] worship. When it's all about
[3:04:16] you, it's all about you,
[3:04:21] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the fake I
[3:04:26] made.
[3:04:30] Thank you,
[3:04:31] Lord. It's all about you,
[3:04:37] Jesus. King of endless
[3:04:41] work. No one could
[3:04:44] express how much you
[3:04:47] [Music]
[3:04:48] deserve. I love this part.
[3:04:52] And though I'm weak and
[3:04:55] poor, oh my, all I have is
[3:04:59] yours. Every single
[3:05:03] [Music]
[3:05:06] breath. I'll bring you more than a
[3:05:10] song. For a song in itself, it's not
[3:05:15] what you have required.
[3:05:19] [Music]
[3:05:22] You search much deeper
[3:05:25] within through the way things
[3:05:28] appear. You're looking
[3:05:31] into my
[3:05:36] heart. I'm coming back to the heart of
[3:05:41] flesh.
[3:05:43] But it's all about
[3:05:46] you. It's all about you,
[3:05:50] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[3:05:55] I've
[3:05:57] made, but it's all about
[3:06:01] you. It's all about you,
[3:06:06] Jesus. It's all about you.
[3:06:11] It's all about
[3:06:14] [Music]
[3:06:17] you. Can you say that with me now? It's
[3:06:20] all about
[3:06:21] you. It's all about
[3:06:25] you. It's all about
[3:06:32] you. I'm coming back.
[3:06:36] I'm coming back
[3:06:38] to the heart of
[3:06:41] worship when it's all about
[3:06:45] you. It's all about you,
[3:06:50] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[3:06:55] I've made it. And it's all about
[3:07:00] you. It's all about you,
[3:07:08] [Music]
[3:07:11] Jesus. You unravel me
[3:07:16] with a meloyy.
[3:07:20] You surround me
[3:07:23] with a song.
[3:07:28] of
[3:07:31] deliverance from my
[3:07:35] enemies until all my
[3:07:39] fears are
[3:07:43] gone. I'm no
[3:07:45] longer a
[3:07:47] slave to fear.
[3:07:50] [Music]
[3:07:52] I am a
[3:07:55] child of
[3:07:58] God. I'm no
[3:08:01] longer a
[3:08:02] slave to
[3:08:06] fear. I
[3:08:08] am a
[3:08:10] child of God from my mother's womb. From
[3:08:15] my mother's
[3:08:18] womb, you have chosen
[3:08:22] me. Love has
[3:08:25] called my
[3:08:29] name. I've been born
[3:08:32] again to a
[3:08:37] family. Your blood flows
[3:08:40] through my veins.
[3:08:43] I'm no
[3:08:46] longer a
[3:08:48] slave to
[3:08:51] fear. I am a
[3:08:55] child of God. Thank you,
[3:08:58] Lord. I'm no longer a
[3:09:02] slave to
[3:09:05] [Music]
[3:09:07] fear. I am a
[3:09:10] child of God. And you split the
[3:09:15] seas. You split the seas so I could walk
[3:09:20] right through
[3:09:22] them. My fear, the drowned in perfect
[3:09:29] love. You rescued me so I can stand and
[3:09:36] say, I am a child of God. I'm no longer
[3:09:43] I'm no longer a
[3:09:47] slave to
[3:09:49] [Music]
[3:09:51] fear. I
[3:09:53] am a
[3:09:55] child of
[3:09:56] [Music]
[3:09:58] God. I'm no
[3:10:00] longer a
[3:10:02] slave to
[3:10:06] fear. I am a child. I'll sing that
[3:10:10] again. Of
[3:10:12] God, I'm no
[3:10:17] [Music]
[3:10:28] longer. I'm no
[3:10:30] longer
[3:10:32] slave to fear.
[3:10:36] I am a
[3:10:39] child of God. You split the
[3:10:42] [Music]
[3:10:44] seas. You split the sea so I could walk
[3:10:49] right through him. My fears are drowned
[3:10:54] in perfect love.
[3:10:58] [Music]
[3:11:00] You rescued me so I can stand and
[3:11:05] say I am a child of God. I'm no longer
[3:11:12] I'm no
[3:11:15] longer Thank you,
[3:11:18] [Music]
[3:11:19] Lord. I am a
[3:11:23] child of God.
[3:11:27] I'm no
[3:11:29] longer
[3:11:30] slave to
[3:11:32] [Music]
[3:11:34] fear. I am a

[3:17:58] So
[3:17:59] you made a
[3:18:01] way across the great divine
[3:18:05] touch. Left behind heaven's

[3:19:18] death has no
[3:19:20] steam and life has no
[3:19:23] wind for I have been

[4:32:32] west runs as deep as it is
[4:32:36] [Music]
[4:32:39] wide. You know all of my hopes.
[4:32:48] You know all our
[4:32:52] [Music]
[4:32:53] fears. Words cannot express the love we
[4:32:59] feel. But we long for you to
[4:33:03] [Music]
[4:33:06] hear. Listen to our
[4:33:13] heart. Hear our spirit sing.
[4:33:18] [Music]
[4:33:21] song of praise the
[4:33:22] [Music]
[4:33:26] Lord from those you have redeemed.
[4:33:34] And we will use the words we
[4:33:38] know and tell you
[4:33:41] what it ought to go
[4:33:46] you when words are not
[4:33:49] enough. Tell you of our
[4:33:53] love. Listen to our hearts.
[4:34:00] Words could fall like
[4:34:02] [Music]
[4:34:06] rain from these lips of
[4:34:12] mine. And if I had a thousand
[4:34:18] years, I would still run out of time.
[4:34:23] [Music]
[4:34:25] But if you listen to my
[4:34:31] heart, every beat will
[4:34:38] say, "Thank you for the
[4:34:41] life. Thank you for the
[4:34:45] truth. Thank you for the way.
[4:34:52] Listen to our
[4:34:57] heart. Hear our spirit
[4:35:04] sing. A song of praise that
[4:35:10] blows those you have redeemed.
[4:35:18] And we will use the words we
[4:35:22] know to tell you
[4:35:25] what an awesome God you
[4:35:29] are. When words are not
[4:35:33] enough, tell you of our
[4:35:37] love. Listen to our heart.
[4:35:44] The sun's come
[4:35:47] up. It's a new day
[4:35:51] dawn. It's time to
[4:35:54] sing your song again.
[4:35:59] Whatever may
[4:36:02] pass and whatever lies before
[4:36:07] me, let me be seen when the
[4:36:11] evening
[4:36:13] [Music]
[4:36:15] comes. Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[4:36:21] Oh my
[4:36:24] soul, his
[4:36:26] holy
[4:36:30] name. Sing like
[4:36:32] never
[4:36:35] before. Oh my soul, I will worship his
[4:36:41] holy name.
[4:36:46] You are rich in love and you're slow to
[4:36:53] way. Your name is great and your heart
[4:36:58] is
[4:37:00] kind for all your goodness. I will keep
[4:37:06] on singing it.
[4:37:09] 10,000 reasons for my heart to
[4:37:15] find. Bless the Lord, oh my
[4:37:19] soul, oh my
[4:37:23] soul, wash his
[4:37:26] holy
[4:37:29] name. Sing like never before.
[4:37:34] Oh my soul, I will worship his
[4:37:40] holy
[4:37:44] name. And on that day when my strength
[4:37:50] is
[4:37:52] fad, the end draws near and my time has
[4:37:57] come.
[4:37:59] Still my soul will sing your praise
[4:38:05] unending 10,000 years and then
[4:38:10] forever more.
[4:38:14] Ask the Lord, oh my
[4:38:17] soul, oh my
[4:38:22] soul, his holy
[4:38:26] name sing like never before.
[4:38:32] Oh my soul, I will
