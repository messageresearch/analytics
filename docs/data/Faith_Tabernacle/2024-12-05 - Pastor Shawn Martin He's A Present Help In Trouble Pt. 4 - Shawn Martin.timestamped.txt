[43:15] in the hospital uh um sister Bethany had
[43:20] to recover uh from everything that she
[43:23] was going through and and so brother
[43:26] shemiah was the one one up there
[43:28] constantly feeding feeding the baby and
[43:30] helping the baby and just because um uh
[43:34] sister Bethany just wasn't able to do
[43:36] that at the time and uh so a little guy
[43:40] has uh kind of gotten used to
[43:43] shamai and uh so it's been hard for him
[43:47] the baby to switch and so he won't
[43:50] hardly take the bottle uh it it has to
[43:53] be brother shemiah got to hold him got
[43:56] to talk to him
[43:57] you know and um I you know uh I was
[44:01] telling them I said well I said that's
[44:02] kind of way it was with
[44:04] Daniel um Daniel wouldn't take nobody he
[44:08] wanted me and uh you know after a while
[44:11] I got to think there might be something
[44:12] wrong with him
[44:15] but and uh but it just the way it was
[44:18] you know and and so uh uh so it's it's
[44:23] been it's been really hard uh for them
[44:26] uh br has got to work and um and yet he
[44:30] has to come a lot of times come home uh
[44:35] so that the baby will eat uh but it's
[44:38] getting to the place that even though he
[44:39] won't even take his bottle at all and um
[44:43] so with that in mind if he keeps losing
[44:46] weight uh then they're going to have to
[44:48] put a feeding tube in his stomach and uh
[44:52] of course you know brother Shaman's
[44:54] sister Bethany uh just really pray
[44:57] praying they don't have to do that and
[44:59] um and I understand that and so I um we
[45:04] we really want to just go Before the
[45:07] Throne of God uh that God can just touch
[45:10] this situation turn this thing around
[45:14] and he has he has blessed brother shemai
[45:17] and sister Bethany with this baby that
[45:19] is a miracle baby and um and Satan has
[45:23] uh just been fighting all along but I I
[45:26] just don't believe he's going to win and
[45:29] uh so we want to keep um uh shuel in our
[45:33] prayer and also um Daniel had forgot to
[45:36] mention brother Beal brother Beal has
[45:39] been sick and um that's why he's not
[45:43] been in in the services past uh few
[45:46] times and um um and he just needs our
[45:51] prayer um I don't know all what is going
[45:54] on I just know you know his Thro
[45:57] and uh sister Britney the other day sent
[46:00] him uh went and gave him some food and
[46:03] he couldn't talk and uh but just just
[46:06] really struggling in his body and uh so
[46:11] uh maybe we could just go to the Lord in
[46:13] prayer uh for brother Beal and shuel and
[46:18] um we just ask the Lord to bless the
[46:20] reading of his word as well let's bow

[48:39] mental health or just discouragement
[48:42] whatever it would be may may you just
[48:45] come and move supernaturally among us we
[48:49] ask it in Jesus Christ name and the
[48:52] church
[48:53] says amen and
[48:55] amen uh we want to look at the book of
[48:58] Psalms we've been reading
[49:02] this a couple verses here uh past couple
[49:06] services but Psalms
[49:09] 46 and
[49:13] um we'll start at the um the first
[49:18] verse but uh it says for God is our
[49:23] refuge and
[49:25] strength a very present help in
[49:29] trouble therefore will not we fear we
[49:34] will not
[49:36] fear can you say that with me we will
[49:38] not
[49:40] fear though the Earth be removed and
[49:43] though the mountains be carried into the
[49:45] midst of the sea though the waters
[49:48] thereof Roar and be troubled though the
[49:50] mountains shake with the
[49:53] swelling thereof salal there is a river
[49:57] the streams whereof shall make glad the
[49:59] city of God the holy place of the
[50:02] Tabernacles of the most high God is in
[50:06] the midst of her she shall not be moved
[50:10] God shall help her and that right
[50:14] early amen may God just add the
[50:18] blessings to his word you can be
[50:22] seated and
[50:24] um if I guess to itle it he is a present
[50:28] help in
[50:30] trouble and uh the word
[50:33] help it means to Aid to assist to lend
[50:40] strength or to lend a means towards
[50:44] affecting a
[50:46] purpose uh to to assist to secure to
[50:51] lend means of Deliverance as to help one
[50:55] in distress or or to help one out of
[50:59] prison to give or provide what is
[51:03] necessary to accomplish a task or
[51:07] satisfy a
[51:09] need so help now now we we know that God
[51:15] predestinated a people he's got a plan
[51:19] he's got a uh a way and and um um he's
[51:25] he's got a Outlook and and we've read
[51:28] the scripture many times where God says
[51:32] I I know the plans that I have for you
[51:35] and uh my thoughts toward you it's that
[51:39] to bring you to a a uh uh uh an
[51:44] accomplished end to bring you to a a
[51:47] purpose and an end so we're not just
[51:49] here floating in life and and uh that
[51:54] God has purposed God has
[51:57] decreed us uh to an end and now he's
[52:01] saying I am going to be a help uh I'm
[52:05] going to meet that need amen because you
[52:07] got to remember as Paul would tell us
[52:10] that that the creature we that that uh
[52:14] we were subject to vanity uh not by not
[52:18] willingly but by reason of him who also
[52:22] subjected us to a hope so so the god
[52:25] that decre de Creed us to Salvation the
[52:28] god that decreed us to to uh uh an
[52:32] eternal end of peace and joy and and
[52:36] said I I go to prepare a place for you
[52:38] and and and the these things are already
[52:41] there uh God's not waiting for you to to
[52:45] uh uh see what you're going to do before
[52:48] he gets a place prepared for you he says
[52:50] I'm going to prepare a place and and
[52:53] it's a it's a brother Bram even talked
[52:56] about you know the Bible talks about a
[52:57] prepared City and he said that it's a
[53:00] prepared City for a prepared people and
[53:03] and so so we we already know that that
[53:07] that we we've arrived uh uh them he
[53:10] called he justified and them he
[53:12] justified he's already glorified but we
[53:15] were subject to vanity we were subject
[53:18] to sin we were subject to diseases we
[53:21] were made subject and and the prophet
[53:23] gives us the reason why is is that could
[53:27] make himself known and cuz we would
[53:29] never know him as a as a Healer except
[53:32] we needed a Healer we'd never know him
[53:34] as a savior and so all these attributes
[53:37] could not be made manifest to us if God
[53:41] had not subjected us to vanity to to
[53:44] weakness to Frailty to all of these
[53:47] things and and and yet that may have
[53:50] looked like that's the that was our
[53:52] start if if you want to say it out in
[53:54] life it it our our start was was
[53:56] weakness and and our start was a a vile
[53:59] nature but but that never stopped what
[54:02] God decreed it never detered amen God's
[54:06] thoughts for us and so in this time of
[54:10] mortality he all he says I am a help I'm
[54:14] I'm a present help ain't that right I
[54:17] will give I will provide I will assist
[54:20] whatever needs uh uh to meet that need I
[54:24] am that present help amen and so uh uh
[54:28] uh uh this word present uh just looking
[54:32] it up uh in in Webster it's now existing
[54:36] amen it's not used to exist or uh future
[54:40] tense going to exist it's now existing
[54:44] being in view amen God being a present
[54:49] help he's put
[54:51] himself now and showing that he's in
[54:55] view he's he's existing now amen and and
[54:59] and then brother brandham would would
[55:01] would would say it this way he is always
[55:04] present to help in time of trouble he's
[55:08] always present whether it's night day no
[55:12] matter what valley you're in what trial
[55:15] you're in what your failures your your
[55:17] your accomplishments what whatever it
[55:19] would be he's always he's always present
[55:23] Amen to help in time of trouble trouble
[55:27] now you know uh uh this this this um uh
[55:31] you know I I I we are truly blessed to
[55:36] know what we know we're we're truly
[55:38] blessed to to be uh uh to to to know uh
[55:43] what we we to have what we have and uh
[55:46] but brother Brandon would tell us that
[55:49] for nearly 2,000 years uh uh Christ uh
[55:53] or the Holy Spirit has Bound by these
[55:57] denominational Rivers amen and and so
[56:01] God men have made God a a god of History
[56:06] uh uh a god of yesterday and and so now
[56:10] now uh uh for many they don't say that
[56:13] there is no God uh uh but but what they
[56:17] do say is that what he did in the Bible
[56:21] days he doesn't do today amen and and
[56:25] and so and and it really is is truly
[56:27] amazing how the devil Works uh uh there
[56:31] because uh he can he can actually get
[56:34] one group of people to believe that
[56:36] there is no God at all that that God
[56:39] does not exist and it's just an
[56:42] imagination and and uh uh uh all of
[56:45] these things and and yet he himself
[56:48] knows that there is a God and yet he can
[56:52] convince people some people that there
[56:55] actually is no God
[56:56] amen and and yet James 2:19 says Thou
[56:59] Bel that there believest that there is
[57:01] one God thou doest well the Devils also
[57:04] believe and tremble so so the devil's
[57:07] exactly right with you he knows that
[57:10] there is a God and yet he can convince
[57:13] some people uh uh to actually believe
[57:16] that there's no God at all and and yet
[57:18] see so if he can't get people uh a
[57:22] person to believe that there is no God
[57:25] and and and these things then he gets
[57:28] them to believe that that okay there is
[57:31] a God but that God can't do what he used
[57:35] to do amen and and to think that there
[57:38] are people who literally claim to serve
[57:41] God and yet will tell you that that God
[57:45] that rolled back the Red Sea can't do it
[57:47] today the god that raised Lazarus from
[57:50] the dead cannot do that today and yet
[57:52] they claim to serve God Amen see so you
[57:56] see how the devil Works see and and in
[57:59] order to uh uh uh get uh people to
[58:04] believe this that that there is a God
[58:06] but yet he doesn't work miracles like he
[58:08] used to well then he he has to he has to
[58:13] downplay the word of God to them he he
[58:17] has to make this as though it is just a
[58:20] fiction of man's imagination as as
[58:24] though you're just reading another West
[58:26] book or a a a Cinderella Once Upon a
[58:29] Time thing and and and it's just uh it's
[58:32] just you change it however however you
[58:34] want to change it because it really
[58:36] never happened and and so um uh uh but
[58:40] he downplays the word of God to them and
[58:43] he convinces them that not all the word
[58:46] of God is truly inspired because if you
[58:50] believe the word of God is inspired you
[58:53] cannot put God in a god of History
[58:56] but you have to recognize that that God
[58:59] of yesterday is the same God today amen
[59:03] see but see it's it's the uh uh so he
[59:07] convinces people that this word is not
[59:10] all of it is inspired it's the same
[59:12] demonic spirit that that believes uh
[59:14] that tells us that uh you know we can't
[59:17] believe all the message amen and and
[59:20] some of it's inspired and some of it's
[59:22] not and all of that and so there are
[59:25] ministers that actually uh uh uh ignore
[59:29] uh certain scriptures in the Bible
[59:31] because they do not believe them to be
[59:34] inspired amen just like I've told you
[59:36] before I had a a a man that was a a a
[59:39] teacher of the Bible and of a certain
[59:42] denomination but he he sat there in in
[59:45] in in Pennsylvania and told me that uh
[59:49] uh Hebrews 13 and8 is not inspired it
[59:53] doesn't even fit in the chapter of of uh
[59:56] of 13 it's it's some man put it in there
[1:00:00] and and he's trying to tell me that
[1:00:02] Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday
[1:00:05] today and forever and I just looked at
[1:00:07] him I said sir you've come too late I
[1:00:10] said you see all these young people I I
[1:00:12] I could call every one of them and tell
[1:00:14] you the Miracles that God has done even
[1:00:17] in my own family I said you've come too
[1:00:19] late I said you see that girl right
[1:00:20] there I pointed the hand I said God
[1:00:22] created a hip amen uh when she needed a
[1:00:25] hip and I said I've got scientific proof
[1:00:28] to show you that God done that amen and
[1:00:30] we went on and on and on Amen but see uh
[1:00:33] uh it it's a it's hard to imagine that
[1:00:37] that there are people that do not
[1:00:38] believe that Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ
[1:00:42] the same yesterday today and forever uh
[1:00:45] is is inspired of God see and so then
[1:00:49] then I've come to the conclusion that
[1:00:51] that it really doesn't matter Amen to
[1:00:53] Satan whether you don't believe uh or or
[1:00:57] maybe where whether you believe that God
[1:00:59] exists or not amen uh it it really
[1:01:01] doesn't matter amen because uh uh uh uh
[1:01:06] Satan has practically accomplished the
[1:01:09] same thing either way you get a person
[1:01:12] that doesn't believe in God uh that God
[1:01:14] exists and you get a person that doesn't
[1:01:16] believe that God can do Miracles today
[1:01:18] and and God can't do anything that he
[1:01:20] used to do well then you come up to the
[1:01:22] same conclusion the same spot and amen
[1:01:26] and that is Amen to get you not to
[1:01:29] believe that God is a present help in
[1:01:32] the time of trouble amen Church we're in
[1:01:34] the in the greatest hour of trouble Amen
[1:01:37] on the face of the Earth and we need to
[1:01:39] know that there is a God that is present
[1:01:42] today that can heal that can save that
[1:01:46] can deliver amen that can raise from the
[1:01:48] dead that can heal whatever when the
[1:01:51] doctors have given hope there is a God
[1:01:53] that will offer the assistance that you
[1:01:55] need when you need money when you need
[1:01:57] groceries there is a God that can help
[1:02:00] in time of trouble amen but see if a man
[1:02:04] doesn't believe in God Amen he'll never
[1:02:06] see God as a present help if a man looks
[1:02:09] at God and says yes there is a God Amen
[1:02:11] but he can't he doesn't do the things
[1:02:13] that he used to do today amen uh that he
[1:02:16] did back then then he'll never look for
[1:02:18] God for help can you say amen amen see
[1:02:22] so if God doesn't exist then how can he
[1:02:24] be a present help to you if God doesn't
[1:02:26] do what he used to do amen then how can
[1:02:29] he be a present help to you ain't that
[1:02:31] right see so the result of a man
[1:02:33] believing either way amen is he will not
[1:02:37] believe in the
[1:02:39] Supernatural God will not man will not
[1:02:42] believe in the Supernatural see God is
[1:02:45] Supernatural ain't that right so to
[1:02:47] believe that God exists you have to
[1:02:49] truly believe in the Supernatural amen
[1:02:53] but his actions are Supernatural That's
[1:02:55] that's what a prophet said not only is
[1:02:58] God Supernatural his actions are
[1:03:00] Supernatural so to believe that God is
[1:03:03] the same yesterday today and forever you
[1:03:05] have to believe in the
[1:03:07] Supernatural amen you you have to see so
[1:03:12] uh uh you have to believe it amen see
[1:03:15] and you must believe in order to
[1:03:17] experience Jesus Christ as being a
[1:03:20] pressing help amen for Jesus said all
[1:03:23] things everybody say all things all
[1:03:26] things are possible to them that believe
[1:03:28] that's the key all things are possible
[1:03:31] Amen to them that believe amen he does
[1:03:34] not uh uh uh put a stipulation on what
[1:03:37] God can do he just says if you can
[1:03:40] believe it it's possible it's it's
[1:03:42] possible if you need if you need a new
[1:03:44] heart it's possible if you can believe
[1:03:47] if you need a blood transfusion it's
[1:03:49] possible if you can believe if you need
[1:03:52] your blind eyes open amen it's possible
[1:03:55] if you can believe I've seen the lame
[1:03:58] walk because it's somebody amen made it
[1:04:01] possible because they could believe I've
[1:04:04] seen the blind eyes open because
[1:04:06] somebody believed God and it became
[1:04:09] possible to them I've seen men and women
[1:04:12] raised from uh off the deathbed when the
[1:04:15] doctor said there's no hope and God
[1:04:18] would raise that person off the deathbed
[1:04:21] because somebody believed it and it
[1:04:23] became possible amen man to them see all
[1:04:27] things are possible to them that believe
[1:04:31] brother brandom says God can only help
[1:04:34] you as your faith will permit him to
[1:04:37] operate in you I'll say that again God
[1:04:40] can only help you as your faith will
[1:04:42] permit him to operate in you so the
[1:04:46] doctor is not the absolute amen the
[1:04:49] banker is not the absolute amen
[1:04:51] society's not the absolute the
[1:04:54] politicians the governments whatever is
[1:04:56] not the absolute amen they'll assist you
[1:04:59] in whatever they can and usually you
[1:05:02] know as far as even in the government
[1:05:03] they'll assist you if they can get
[1:05:05] something back or if they can put a
[1:05:07] little bit more hands and in in your in
[1:05:09] your stuff you understand what I'm
[1:05:11] saying that God Amen he's a present help
[1:05:14] in the time of trouble amen and all of
[1:05:17] these other things are natural helps the
[1:05:20] doctor helps with natural things uh amen
[1:05:22] the banker can loan with natural
[1:05:24] substance uh amen everything and and a
[1:05:27] preacher even can help you in a natural
[1:05:29] way visit and and encourage and
[1:05:32] musicians can play in a natural way
[1:05:35] natural things it's natural but God's
[1:05:38] help is a supernatural can you say amen
[1:05:41] and if he can work in the natural amen
[1:05:44] let God come amen and work in the
[1:05:47] natural amen that that's what he does
[1:05:49] ain't that right yes sir so Satan uh he
[1:05:52] doesn't want people to believe in the
[1:05:54] Supernatural that's this whole goal amen
[1:05:57] he so he'll get you to believe that God
[1:05:59] doesn't exist or he'll get you to
[1:06:00] believe that God doesn't do what he used
[1:06:02] to do he just doesn't want you today
[1:06:04] believing in the
[1:06:06] Supernatural amen that's right why
[1:06:08] because if you believe in the
[1:06:10] Supernatural then you'll expect
[1:06:12] Supernatural things to happen amen then
[1:06:15] you your your mood doesn't get dictated
[1:06:17] by problems amen you're you you your
[1:06:20] your your your attitude or your outlook
[1:06:23] isn't dictated it doesn't become
[1:06:25] negative uh uh Outlook it doesn't become
[1:06:28] a negative testimony it doesn't become a
[1:06:30] negative thing just because the
[1:06:32] situation is negative because you
[1:06:34] believe in a supernatural God and you
[1:06:37] know he's present and so now you expect
[1:06:40] the supernatural to come any time at
[1:06:43] anywh in any place yes sir see so so if
[1:06:48] you believe in the Supernatural then
[1:06:50] you'll accept super expect Supernatural
[1:06:53] things to happen that's why brother
[1:06:56] Brown said when you come to the meeting
[1:06:57] you get what you expect when you wake up
[1:07:00] and you face that day you'll get what
[1:07:02] you expect amen you say well I just feel
[1:07:04] in drewy I just feel discouraged but let
[1:07:07] your expectation be in a supernatural
[1:07:10] God Amen that is present to help you in
[1:07:14] the time of your
[1:07:15] trouble
[1:07:18] amen see the person that believes in the
[1:07:21] Supernatural is the one who welcomes God
[1:07:24] in his or her missed and makes him feel
[1:07:28] welcome because God is
[1:07:30] Supernatural it's fine for the Natural
[1:07:33] Things amen but but if God doesn't come
[1:07:36] supernaturally our music doesn't do us
[1:07:38] any good the preaching doesn't do us any
[1:07:41] good amen to have a building and to have
[1:07:43] the pews all patted and and to have
[1:07:46] everything just right it doesn't do us
[1:07:47] any good if the supernatural God doesn't
[1:07:50] show up amen and so when people doesn't
[1:07:53] believe in Supernatural amen then they
[1:07:55] won't make him welcome they're satisfied
[1:07:57] with just natural things amen just a
[1:08:00] natural service just a little old Fine
[1:08:02] Thing a little natural sermon a little
[1:08:04] natural thing a little you know it's
[1:08:06] just natural things amen but we want God
[1:08:10] to be welcome amen and and you you have
[1:08:14] to believe in the Supernatural to make
[1:08:16] him welcome amen that's exactly right
[1:08:20] can you say amen amen yes sir so if you
[1:08:23] believe amen so the person that believes
[1:08:26] in the Supernatural is the one who
[1:08:28] welcomes God and then the prophet says
[1:08:31] wherever God is the supernatural takes
[1:08:35] place so then he is a present
[1:08:38] Supernatural help in the time of your
[1:08:41] trouble can you say Amen now notice in
[1:08:45] Zechariah
[1:08:46] 14:6 it says and it shall come to pass
[1:08:49] in that day that the light shall neither
[1:08:51] be clear shall not be clear nor dark so
[1:08:54] down through the years the prophet would
[1:08:56] tell us we've had enough light to see
[1:08:59] how to get around uh one place just
[1:09:02] another just enough light to join church
[1:09:04] and to put your name on a book and to
[1:09:07] ask Christ forgiveness another place he
[1:09:09] says we've had a day 2,000 years where
[1:09:12] we've organized joined churches built
[1:09:14] great things great spires and all of
[1:09:16] these things see just enough light just
[1:09:18] enough just to see to get around just to
[1:09:21] believe God for salvation and yada yada
[1:09:23] and and things like that see and so in
[1:09:26] in the history of of the church um uh uh
[1:09:31] and and and we see that Satan has solded
[1:09:34] he's he solded in the beginning uh the
[1:09:37] seed of Discord God sold his Pentecostal
[1:09:40] seed amen it on the day of Pentecost and
[1:09:43] then Satan come right after there and
[1:09:44] solded a a seed of discrepancy amen and
[1:09:48] that's how the false Vine got its start
[1:09:50] in the church and notice what brother
[1:09:52] Bram said the false Church organized and
[1:09:55] humanized the government and the word
[1:09:59] and and fought the true Christian so
[1:10:01] they humanized the government humanized
[1:10:04] the word took all the supernatural out
[1:10:06] of it you understand what I'm saying in
[1:10:09] other words they started to make God a
[1:10:10] god of History right then amen by
[1:10:13] humanizing amen everything see and and
[1:10:17] and so it it's exactly what Israel done
[1:10:20] amen uh uh in the Old Testament they
[1:10:23] humanized uh leader ership see God was
[1:10:27] leading them and they chose a a man a
[1:10:31] carnal man ruling over them instead of
[1:10:34] the Holy Spirit the prophet said see God
[1:10:36] had been leading his people through this
[1:10:39] consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet
[1:10:42] Samuel right amen and and and then the
[1:10:45] people said no we don't want you no more
[1:10:46] we want a king and so it really
[1:10:49] Disturbed Samuel the prophet and he and
[1:10:51] he went to the Lord and said Lord they
[1:10:53] rejected me you know and and the Lord
[1:10:55] says no no no they've not rejected you
[1:10:57] they've rejected me that I should not
[1:10:59] Reign Over them see and so they they
[1:11:02] chose they wanted a king a political
[1:11:05] power to rule over them instead of the
[1:11:08] Holy Spirit to rule over them see and so
[1:11:12] brother brandom says this and and and
[1:11:14] and notice now he says you see the one
[1:11:16] difference the one difference between
[1:11:19] Israel and all the other nations amen
[1:11:22] was God ain't that right the only
[1:11:26] difference between you and and and and
[1:11:29] and somebody else is God the the only
[1:11:33] difference between America and and all
[1:11:35] the other nations is a pat God the first
[1:11:39] and foremost in in in in their lives
[1:11:42] amen see that that's what made the
[1:11:44] difference see and and and so uh uh uh
[1:11:47] he says you put God to one side and
[1:11:50] Israel was like any other Nation when
[1:11:52] Samson cut off his hair he was like any
[1:11:55] other man put the leadership of the Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost aside and the church is nothing
[1:12:00] but uh uh but the world with God's name
[1:12:03] attached to it see put God aside put the
[1:12:06] Holy Ghost aside put the supernatural
[1:12:09] aside put the supernatural action of God
[1:12:11] aside and the church is nothing but the
[1:12:14] world with the name of God attached to
[1:12:17] it he says the world and the church are
[1:12:19] all of the same lump just like Jacob and
[1:12:23] Esau were of the same parents but the
[1:12:25] spirit of God everybody say the spirit
[1:12:27] of God makes the difference see it
[1:12:30] doesn't matter if you call yourself
[1:12:32] Christian anyone can do that the point
[1:12:35] is whether or not you have the spirit of
[1:12:38] God in you for without that Spirit you
[1:12:40] are a reprobate you are none of his see
[1:12:44] now uh uh in another place he says now
[1:12:47] God and he's talking about Israel
[1:12:50] choosing a king over over God's
[1:12:52] leadership through a prophet he said now
[1:12:54] see God was going to humanize the
[1:12:57] leadership himself in the person of the
[1:12:59] Lord Jesus Christ he said but they got
[1:13:02] ahead of him think of that they got
[1:13:05] ahead of him and they chose a man to
[1:13:08] lead them without having God in him see
[1:13:13] and so they got ahead of him Satan knew
[1:13:15] the plan of God so he put it in the
[1:13:18] hearts of the people to get ahead of the
[1:13:21] word head of God the word amen see so
[1:13:25] the the false Vine chose a political
[1:13:28] power over the leadership of God and and
[1:13:32] that started in the first church age and
[1:13:34] then by the time the Third Church age
[1:13:36] got here Amen brother Brown says men
[1:13:39] were humanizing salvation instead of
[1:13:43] leaving salvation to God as it was in
[1:13:46] the first church in the day of Pentecost
[1:13:48] when it says and and 3,000 Souls were
[1:13:51] added and the Lord added to the church
[1:13:55] daily now it's taken that away and
[1:13:58] they've humanized salvation see Jonah 2
[1:14:02] and9 it says salvation everybody say
[1:14:05] salvation is of the Lord salvation is of
[1:14:09] the lord it's just like the psalmist
[1:14:11] said My Help Cometh From The Lord see
[1:14:14] salvation is of the Lord and the prophet
[1:14:17] said see men in the third age amen had
[1:14:20] turned from this truth having cast aside
[1:14:23] the doctrine of election and open wide
[1:14:26] the church door and their Fellowship to
[1:14:28] any and all who subscribe to their
[1:14:31] tenants never mind the words see and so
[1:14:34] here he says today churches are filled
[1:14:37] with mental believers who claim to be
[1:14:40] saved on the grounds of joining a church
[1:14:43] they endorse the Virgin birth the shed
[1:14:46] blood going to church taking communion
[1:14:49] and they don't yet have a new birth he
[1:14:52] said but the truth be told no man can
[1:14:54] Tru truly believe unto eternal life and
[1:14:57] the righteousness of God apart from the
[1:15:00] measure of the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ himself yes I'm still talking
[1:15:06] about him being a help amen you see a
[1:15:09] man cannot even believe under
[1:15:11] righteousness a man cannot believe
[1:15:13] salvation a man can't truly believe unto
[1:15:16] eternal life and the righteousness of
[1:15:19] God without having the very faith of
[1:15:22] Jesus Christ can you say amen so brother
[1:15:26] Brandon would tell us human faith is not
[1:15:29] enough amen just to believe that God
[1:15:31] exists is not enough just to believe in
[1:15:34] the in the morals of life and and that's
[1:15:37] not enough amen just to believe in the
[1:15:40] law of God is Not Enough see you can
[1:15:43] have that and have and human Faith
[1:15:46] believes in these things but he says it
[1:15:48] takes the very faith of the Son of God
[1:15:51] to drop into a man's heart so that he
[1:15:54] can receive receive the Lord Of Glory
[1:15:56] into the temple not made with hands can
[1:15:59] you say Amen now we're talking about the
[1:16:01] faith of the Son of God do you realize
[1:16:03] that's a living faith that's what a
[1:16:05] prophet said it's not just human Faith
[1:16:07] it's actually a living faith a living
[1:16:10] faith for in Galatians 2:20 Paul would
[1:16:13] tell us I live I live by the faith of
[1:16:17] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:16:20] himself for me so Paul is now telling us
[1:16:24] that God was a present help to him amen
[1:16:27] that I'm not just doing this by my own
[1:16:29] faith I'm not just doing this by my own
[1:16:31] will I am living by the faith of the Son
[1:16:35] of God and if you notice Paul did not
[1:16:38] say that he was living by the faith in
[1:16:41] the Son of God it wasn't just faith in
[1:16:45] God but it was by the faith of the Son
[1:16:48] of God see so it brother BR would tell
[1:16:51] us it was the faith of the Son of God
[1:16:54] that had given him life and kept him
[1:16:57] living in Christian Victory can you say
[1:17:01] Amen see so he had the very Faith Of God
[1:17:05] Amen God was a help to him in other
[1:17:07] words God imparted his nature into Paul
[1:17:11] he he imparted himself into Paul Amen to
[1:17:15] where now it wasn't a human faith it was
[1:17:18] a Divine Faith amen God in the in the
[1:17:21] beginning stepped on the platform of
[1:17:24] nothing when there was nothing there it
[1:17:26] was all void it was Darkness but God by
[1:17:29] his faith said let there be amen and a
[1:17:33] world come into existence light become
[1:17:35] into existence everything that God
[1:17:38] desired by his faith because he believed
[1:17:41] that what he said would come to pass can
[1:17:44] you say amen and so now that same faith
[1:17:48] is imparted into the church to where
[1:17:51] they believe in a supernatural God that
[1:17:53] whatever they say there is a God to back
[1:17:56] it up whatever they need there is a God
[1:18:00] that can make it happen amen if you need
[1:18:02] healing you say well I'm just about to
[1:18:04] die but there is a God if you could just
[1:18:07] live by the very faith of the Son of
[1:18:10] God he's a pris
[1:18:13] help see so the false Church brother
[1:18:17] Bram said had denied that salvation was
[1:18:21] Supernatural and they still are denying
[1:18:23] this amen see they think it's all about
[1:18:27] joining joining a church it's all about
[1:18:29] shaking a preacher's hand it's all about
[1:18:31] being a good person a good citizen doing
[1:18:34] good things for for the community and
[1:18:36] and all these things see but brother
[1:18:39] Brown said see there's been a day
[1:18:41] there's been a day that people has
[1:18:43] joined Church made denominations just
[1:18:46] enough light to see we'll have a church
[1:18:48] we'll build this we'll build a school
[1:18:50] we'll build a hospital we'll educate
[1:18:52] we'll have a seminary see they've had
[1:18:55] enough light to do that another place
[1:18:57] there's been a day of organization
[1:18:59] denomination just enough light to see to
[1:19:02] get around put your name on a book
[1:19:04] accept Christ as a savior see but notice
[1:19:07] go back to Zechariah 14 and look at
[1:19:11] seven it says but it shall be one day
[1:19:15] which shall be known to the Lord not day
[1:19:18] nor night but it shall come to pass that
[1:19:21] at evening time it shall be light oh
[1:19:25] aren't you glad for that it shall be
[1:19:27] light in other words our our our the the
[1:19:30] the day is going to get brighter that
[1:19:32] our light to be able to see it's not
[1:19:34] just going to be to see enough to do a
[1:19:36] little bit of human work and and accept
[1:19:39] Christ as our savior and all that but
[1:19:41] now it's illumination light amen that
[1:19:44] we're able to see him as to really what
[1:19:47] he is can you say amen that's right see
[1:19:51] that's why there's a Bible believing
[1:19:52] bride upon the Earth today is because
[1:19:55] there's been a light he has come up he
[1:19:57] showed up as a present help in the time
[1:20:00] of our trouble Amen to where we can
[1:20:02] believe God for all things that's what
[1:20:04] brother Brandon was saying he said Lord
[1:20:06] in his prayer he said Lord I believe
[1:20:08] we're living in the time where you're
[1:20:10] preparing the people to believe for all
[1:20:12] things and I just happen to believe for
[1:20:14] all things not only do I believe God for
[1:20:16] my salvation I just happen to believe
[1:20:19] God so God powerful is his blood that he
[1:20:23] can take every sin away to where I can
[1:20:25] stand in his presence Justified as
[1:20:28] though I never done it and not only do I
[1:20:31] believe that I just believe that there
[1:20:33] is a God that's going to change this
[1:20:35] vile body amen and change it and Quicken
[1:20:39] it amen from Mortal to immortality I
[1:20:42] just happen to believe that I just
[1:20:44] believe that we're going to be caught up
[1:20:46] to meet him in the air I just believe
[1:20:49] that there is a God that is present
[1:20:51] that's going to Quicken the dead and the
[1:20:53] Dead's going to rise
[1:20:56] yes sir Amen in evening time it shall be
[1:20:59] light amen so we're not living in a
[1:21:02] dismal day we're not living in a just
[1:21:04] enough light to barely see get around no
[1:21:08] we're living in the evening light now
[1:21:11] which which goes along with Isaiah 60
[1:21:14] arise Shine for thy light I'll say at
[1:21:18] this way thy personal light has come thy
[1:21:22] light is come and the glory of the Lord
[1:21:25] is risen upon thee for Behold The
[1:21:29] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[1:21:31] Darkness the people but the Lord shall
[1:21:34] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[1:21:38] seen upon thee what a time what is it
[1:21:43] it's the revealing of the son of man
[1:21:46] ain't that right so again now notice the
[1:21:49] we'll go back to this quote the Holy
[1:21:52] Spirit has been bound by these
[1:21:53] denomination Rivers for almost 2,000
[1:21:57] years just enough light to get around We
[1:22:01] join the church we build this we build
[1:22:03] that human humanize it's humanized
[1:22:06] salvation humanize this and humanize
[1:22:09] that see amen but he says but it is to
[1:22:12] be loosed in the evening time by the
[1:22:15] evening time message see the Holy Spirit
[1:22:19] back in the church
[1:22:21] again Christ himself revealed in human
[1:22:25] flesh in the evening time can you say
[1:22:28] Amen now what does this mean son of man
[1:22:31] revealed brother Braham said this
[1:22:33] revealing is the same it reveals Christ
[1:22:36] in the very same way that it he was when
[1:22:41] he walked the the Earth see he's
[1:22:43] revealed the same way as he was when he
[1:22:46] walked the Earth the same son shining in
[1:22:49] the west as it did in the East the same
[1:22:52] sun shining he said with the same power
[1:22:56] the same Holy Ghost doing the same thing
[1:22:58] that he did back then can you say Amen
[1:23:01] the light has come thy light has come
[1:23:05] can you say amen that's right see so
[1:23:08] then we're we're seeing that it's the
[1:23:10] supernatural God working in the same
[1:23:13] Supernatural way that's why it does not
[1:23:17] whatever the obstacles that we are going
[1:23:19] through whatever we face it doesn't
[1:23:21] phase us because we know the god that
[1:23:23] walked on water back in that day he can
[1:23:26] do it again today amen the same God that
[1:23:29] raised Lazarus that had been dead 4 days
[1:23:32] and the prophet said corruption had
[1:23:34] already taken the nose amen the eye
[1:23:37] sockets or the ball eyeballs and
[1:23:39] everything but when that Son of God
[1:23:41] stood there and said Lazarus come forth
[1:23:44] death corruption everything amen had to
[1:23:47] bring back El Lazarus amen Lazarus
[1:23:50] didn't come just a halfway man amen just
[1:23:53] what remained left of him
[1:23:55] everything was restored back to him at
[1:23:58] the command of God can you say amen and
[1:24:01] what God was back then God is
[1:24:05] today a present
[1:24:09] help now notice what was Jesus
[1:24:13] manifested for the prophet said to show
[1:24:15] God he was God he was manifested for
[1:24:18] that purpose and through that purpose he
[1:24:21] achieved the church that he now this is
[1:24:24] why he saved you this why he went to
[1:24:25] Calvary this why he done all that 2,000
[1:24:28] years ago is for today that he the
[1:24:31] fullness of God might bring to pass
[1:24:34] every promised word of God hello in
[1:24:38] these last days when he gets the
[1:24:40] preeminence preeminence in the church
[1:24:43] the position his his place in the
[1:24:49] church so the revealing of the son of
[1:24:52] man is that somewhere over here here and
[1:24:54] the church somewhere is over here the
[1:24:57] revealing of the son of man is Christ in
[1:25:00] the
[1:25:01] church him taking his place in the
[1:25:04] church how many's part of the
[1:25:07] church Supernatural God coming in the
[1:25:13] churchu with Supernatural
[1:25:16] actions so brother Bram talking of
[1:25:20] Christ he said Jesus so seen it so seen
[1:25:22] it so was so so perfectly born for the
[1:25:25] day until God expressed every move that
[1:25:28] he made and I want to just stop here you
[1:25:30] are so perfectly born for this
[1:25:35] day well at least I hope you believe
[1:25:37] that you are so perfectly born for this
[1:25:40] day just as Jesus
[1:25:44] was until God expressed every move that
[1:25:47] he made he was God's
[1:25:50] revelation God
[1:25:52] revealed can I say that again he was
[1:25:55] God's revelation Jesus Christ was God's
[1:25:58] revelation ain't that right that was
[1:26:00] 2,000 years ago one man one man was
[1:26:03] God's
[1:26:04] revelation for the fullness of God dwelt

[1:27:39] them and the third thing is to restore
[1:27:42] the kingdom to its right position that
[1:27:45] failed by sin by the first Adam now

[1:28:02] church do you believe it he's already
[1:28:05] got a church he's not purchasing a
[1:28:07] church he's already purchased the church

[1:29:34] Supernatural they don't believe in all
[1:29:36] of that they've been so far away from

[1:34:00] quickening power why it's time for
[1:34:03] deliverance you're living in a time of
[1:34:05] Deliverance you're living in a time of

[1:34:13] he's
[1:34:16] come can you say
[1:34:18] amen and and maybe we can go more into
[1:34:21] that later
[1:34:24] but he has come and not only has he come
[1:34:26] but he is
[1:34:27] here he's here do you believe he's here
[1:34:31] so where is he at Matthew 18:20 where
[1:34:34] two or three are gathered together in my
[1:34:36] name there I am in their midst as a
[1:34:39] present help see your your gathering
[1:34:42] tonight is not in vain it doesn't matter

[1:35:00] out but that ain't in vain your your
[1:35:02] Gathering isn't in vain he's here in our
[1:35:05] midst that's what he promised see so
[1:35:08] then John 147 we've read it many time
[1:35:11] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:35:13] cannot receive even though he's come as
[1:35:15] a present help in time of trouble the
[1:35:18] world cannot receive it because it seeth
[1:35:21] him not neither knoweth him see but you
[1:35:24] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[1:35:26] shall be in you I will not leave you
[1:35:29] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:35:32] little while the world seeth me no more

[1:35:47] would a prophet say in this day you are
[1:35:49] the final voice to the final age did you
[1:35:52] also know he called called you a called
[1:35:55] us as a church a super
[1:35:59] race a super race he didn't look upon
[1:36:03] this bride and just see Mortals failures
[1:36:08] BMS
[1:36:09] vagabonds he saw her as a super
[1:36:13] race why he's come with power and great
[1:36:20] Glory what makes us a super race
[1:36:24] I read you some quotes brother Brown
[1:36:26] said a supernatural God everybody say a
[1:36:29] supernatural God and a supernatural body
[1:36:32] in a natural people giving Supernatural
[1:36:37] signs hello you couldn't be educated
[1:36:41] enough to be a super
[1:36:43] race you can't have enough military
[1:36:45] might to be a super
[1:36:49] race you can't have enough weapons in
[1:36:52] this world to be a super race and yet
[1:36:55] here we are not
[1:36:59] educated looked upon as just
[1:37:02] insignificance
[1:37:04] yeah on now and yet a prophet of God
[1:37:07] calls us a super
[1:37:09] race because it's a supernatural God
[1:37:12] living in a natural people performing
[1:37:15] Supernatural
[1:37:16] signs he said another place Supernatural
[1:37:19] power with Supernatural signs through a
[1:37:21] supernatural belief in a supernatural
[1:37:23] world heard from a supernatural God
[1:37:25] that's a lot of Supernatural
[1:37:28] amen Supernatural power with
[1:37:31] Supernatural signs through a
[1:37:34] supernatural Faith or belief in a
[1:37:36] supernatural word from a supernatural
[1:37:40] God I've read this I believe last Sunday
[1:37:42] to God today is not going to deliver his
[1:37:44] people by education he never promised to
[1:37:47] do it he's not going to deliver them by
[1:37:50] theology he never promised to do it he's
[1:37:52] not going to deliver them by science he
[1:37:54] never promised to do it he's not going
[1:37:56] to deliver them by denomination he never
[1:37:58] promised to do it but he will deliver
[1:38:01] them by the power Supernatural power of
[1:38:04] changing their lives and molding them
[1:38:07] into children of God well aren't you
[1:38:10] glad for that prise the Lord this is why
[1:38:14] in Zechariah 4 and6 it says this is the
[1:38:17] word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying
[1:38:20] not by might nor by by nor by power but
[1:38:24] by my spirit saeth the Lord a
[1:38:27] supernatural thing a present help in the
[1:38:30] time of trouble now people are looking
[1:38:32] for help ain't that right they're
[1:38:34] looking for help amen the world over is
[1:38:37] looking for help amen they want as the
[1:38:40] prophet would tell us they want a
[1:38:44] messiah messiah means the anointed one
[1:38:47] so they're looking for an anointed
[1:38:49] person a messiah to come on the scene to
[1:38:52] help them
[1:38:55] yeah just like Israel was looking for a
[1:38:57] messiah when Jesus come to the Earth and
[1:39:01] Rome the prophet said was looking for a
[1:39:03] messiah as well see but notice Israel
[1:39:06] wanted a general that would uh uh come
[1:39:09] out and stomp Rome Plum out of the
[1:39:12] country Rome wanted a messiah that would
[1:39:15] make them a new great military regime
[1:39:18] and would take Egypt and the rest of the
[1:39:20] Nations and stomp them out God sent them
[1:39:23] a
[1:39:26] messiah and they rejected
[1:39:30] it didn't you say
[1:39:32] amen God sent them a messiah not
[1:39:35] according to what they
[1:39:37] wanted but what they need
[1:39:40] it ain't that right he's not just a
[1:39:44] Santa Claus coming like the world paints
[1:39:46] him as he is a present help
[1:39:54] amen see so the prophet said God sent
[1:39:56] them a baby he sent them a savior he
[1:39:59] know they needed a
[1:40:02] savior but they wanted a general an
[1:40:05] educated
[1:40:07] machine so today he says each nation is
[1:40:10] looking for a messiah Russia wants a
[1:40:13] scientific genius that'll run them over
[1:40:15] to the Moon convince some kind of a bomb
[1:40:18] that'll take off see all and knock off
[1:40:20] all our hydrogen bombs and stop them and
[1:40:24] take uh and can take their own bombs and
[1:40:26] rain it on everybody before anybody else
[1:40:29] gets a start and then they take the
[1:40:31] whole world over India wants a messiah
[1:40:35] they want somebody that will feed them
[1:40:37] without having to
[1:40:39] work so what the prophet said see he
[1:40:43] wants one that wants one that'll feed
[1:40:45] them give them something to eat clothe
[1:40:46] them without working for it just walk up
[1:40:49] and down the street throw it out from
[1:40:51] one side to the other there you are
[1:40:53] won't work they they they just want to
[1:40:55] beg so they want some kind of a holy man
[1:40:57] to rise up who can reach up in the top
[1:41:00] of the trees and Shake It bread and meat
[1:41:02] and things down up on top of them and
[1:41:05] they sit around and eat and sleep the
[1:41:07] rest of the day and get up and have the
[1:41:08] best of clothes Every Nation wants a
[1:41:12] messiah America wants intellectual
[1:41:15] genius a
[1:41:17] politician they're getting closer aren't
[1:41:21] they see the
[1:41:24] church they're wanting Messiah but what
[1:41:27] Messiah are they looking for an anointed
[1:41:29] genius who has everything so fixed up
[1:41:32] that they can live in the world women
[1:41:34] can cut their hair paint their faces men
[1:41:36] can marry four or five times and still
[1:41:38] be deacons they can do anything they
[1:41:40] want to do and still maintain their
[1:41:42] confession as being a Christian they
[1:41:44] want a genius that can fix Creeds to
[1:41:47] where everything bows to
[1:41:49] it everybody wants a messiah
[1:41:54] but they want it on their own
[1:41:57] condition can you say
[1:41:59] Amen but see as as the Jews were looking
[1:42:04] for messiah when Jesus walked the
[1:42:08] Earth people are looking the prophet
[1:42:11] said for a religion to deliver
[1:42:14] them Israel wanted a religion that would
[1:42:17] deliver them from all their evils and
[1:42:20] their
[1:42:21] enemies but what they don't know is
[1:42:24] Christianity meets every challenge that
[1:42:28] they're looking
[1:42:29] for the Lord can you say amen amen see
[1:42:34] what they need see and so they didn't
[1:42:37] receive it back then and they won't
[1:42:39] receive it today see so the prophet said
[1:42:42] they're looking they're seeking a
[1:42:44] religion that will bring a reality to
[1:42:48] them what church what denomination what
[1:42:52] program
[1:42:53] can bring a reality of God to
[1:42:59] them ain't that right now church that
[1:43:02] word reality is the the quality or state
[1:43:05] of being real so there is a reality to
[1:43:08] Victory do you believe that there's a
[1:43:11] reality to Joy there's a reality to
[1:43:14] peace to freedom to Dominion there's a
[1:43:17] reality to living forever and never
[1:43:20] getting old there there's a reality to
[1:43:23] to this thing see and real true
[1:43:26] Christianity meets every one of those
[1:43:30] challenges now the prophet said these
[1:43:32] last days the true bride Church comes to
[1:43:35] The Headstone will be the Super Church a
[1:43:39] super race nears the great headstone
[1:43:42] they will be so much like him even they
[1:43:45] will be in his very image in the order
[1:43:47] to being united with him they will be
[1:43:50] one everybody say they will be one they
[1:43:53] will be one they will be the very
[1:43:55] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:43:57] God denominations can never produce this
[1:44:00] they will produce their Creeds and
[1:44:02] dogmas mixed with the word and it brings
[1:44:04] forth a hybrid product can you say Amen
[1:44:06] but guess what God has sent a prophet
[1:44:09] with a message that is producing a super
[1:44:13] Church a super race where the church man
[1:44:17] and Supernatural God has joined together
[1:44:21] again amen thank you Malachi 4:5 and I
[1:44:25] get ready to close but Ma Malachi 4:5
[1:44:28] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:44:30] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:44:32] and Dreadful day of the Lord what's he
[1:44:34] supposed to do he is to turn the the the
[1:44:37] children's Hearts back to the faith or
[1:44:40] back to the apostolics uh the uh
[1:44:42] Apostolic fathers amen see the the the
[1:44:46] the Apostle uh uh uh of the beginning
[1:44:48] ain't that right and his job was to
[1:44:51] restore the original word and restore
[1:44:55] the people back to that word can you say
[1:44:59] Amen trying to tell you God is bringing
[1:45:02] forth a
[1:45:04] messiah a present help in the time of
[1:45:06] trouble and the prophet said with the
[1:45:08] restoration of the word comes
[1:45:10] restoration of
[1:45:13] power so he says this in the last days
[1:45:16] it shall come to pass behold I send you
[1:45:18] to you Elijah the prophet he shall turn
[1:45:20] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:45:22] faith of the father others and in there

[1:50:05] messiah what makes Messiah brother
[1:50:09] Braham said the word anointed makes the
[1:50:11] Messiah the anointed word of the hour so
[1:50:16] what made Jesus God is because the
[1:50:18] spirit of God was on him the word of God
[1:50:21] flow through
[1:50:23] him can you say amen amen cannot be on
[1:50:27] the fence anymore can't can't can't say

[1:50:50] at the promise and just believe believe
[1:50:52] and let that word of God flow through
[1:50:55] you
[1:50:57] am can you say Amen brother BR talking
[1:51:00] of Jesus said see the word of God flow
[1:51:03] through him so freely that even he could
[1:51:05] speak a word it would create see that
[1:51:08] showed who he was who can create but God
[1:51:11] God is the only Creator there is and he
[1:51:13] was so Haron perfect in harmony him and
[1:51:16] the Word was so perfectly together until
[1:51:19] he created even he had see the word he
[1:51:21] and the word being one and brother Bram
[1:51:24] said you're his son or his daughter
[1:51:27] makes you a messiah for him the anointed
[1:51:31] word living out in you can you say amen
[1:51:36] amen I love the Lord do
[1:51:40] you see so Paul would tell us in 2
[1:51:44] Corinthians 3 and6 the letter kth but
[1:51:47] the spirit giveth life so he said you
[1:51:50] being Anointed with the same spirit he
[1:51:52] was anointed with makes you
[1:51:55] Messiah
[1:51:57] Lord how many believes you're
[1:51:59] messiah messiah is well some of us come
[1:52:03] to that belief Messiah
[1:52:06] is amen so if you really believe you're
[1:52:09] Messiah it's don't talk
[1:52:11] negative don't don't let the devil whip
[1:52:13] you up on now come on now church we
[1:52:16] either fly or we die either this message
[1:52:19] is right or it's
[1:52:20] not this message didn't come just as
[1:52:23] another Billy Graham or another uh uh
[1:52:26] Theologian or whatever down Through the
[1:52:27] Ages just to get us all satisfied and
[1:52:29] and fat and Sassy you know in the spirit
[1:52:32] amen that that that ain't it at all and
[1:52:34] plus that they didn't have what it could
[1:52:35] to make us fat and Sassy you know they
[1:52:37] just had a little bit but we got a seven
[1:52:39] course meal to where we ought to have
[1:52:41] enough strength Amen to fly in the
[1:52:44] heights of God and see God as a present
[1:52:47] help in
[1:52:49] us God as a present help in
[1:52:53] us you believe that see you just can't
[1:52:57] be around quickening
[1:53:00] power that quickening power must be in
[1:53:03] you not just be around it it's got to be
[1:53:08] in you amen Supernatural can you say
[1:53:12] Amen so brother Braham said Jesus
[1:53:16] brought God to human lives God was made
[1:53:19] human when Jesus was born God became man
[1:53:23] that he might become fellowship with man
[1:53:25] and in man to what achieve one purpose
[1:53:30] that is to bring to man what God is not
[1:53:35] what a church is but what God
[1:53:38] is Jesus came that he might present God
[1:53:41] to man and man didn't want it the Holy
[1:53:45] Spirit comes today in like manner to
[1:53:48] present God to man but man wants to go
[1:53:51] to church it drowns his thinking he
[1:53:53] cannot fathom it see and we must learn
[1:53:57] that God is not known by intellectual
[1:53:59] conception God is known by the New Birth
[1:54:02] by the Holy Ghost not by any other way
[1:54:05] and the Holy Ghost has come as token
[1:54:08] life to come into you and to Quicken you
[1:54:11] that you may know what God is and they
[1:54:15] that know their God shall do great
[1:54:19] exploits can you say Amen if the
[1:54:22] musician will
[1:54:24] come do you love
[1:54:26] him praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:54:30] the name of the Lord amen amen I'm going
[1:54:33] to read this Romans 8:19 we talked about
[1:54:37] it the earnest expectation of the
[1:54:38] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:54:40] of the sons of God for the creature was
[1:54:43] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[1:54:45] by reason of him who has subjected the
[1:54:47] same in Hope because the creature itself
[1:54:50] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:54:53] of corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[1:54:55] of the children of God church we have
[1:54:57] been groaning for this the Earth has
[1:54:58] been groaning this is the time you're
[1:55:01] living in the time that all creation
[1:55:03] through all time has been groaning for
[1:55:05] this moment that's right can you say
[1:55:09] Amen see and so they they shall be
[1:55:13] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:55:15] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[1:55:16] children of God for we know that the
[1:55:18] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[1:55:20] pain together until now and not only
[1:55:22] only they but ourselves also which have
[1:55:25] the first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:55:27] also grown our within ourselves so that
[1:55:29] first agage was groaning all the way
[1:55:32] through groaning see waiting for the
[1:55:34] adoption to wit the Redemption of our
[1:55:37] body this happens the Redemption of our
[1:55:41] body that full adoption happens when we
[1:55:44] come into the full adoption at the first
[1:55:47] resurrection what brother Bram said full
[1:55:50] adoption full ad op option can you say
[1:55:53] Amen we're in adoption now this is the
[1:55:55] age of adoption where the supernatural
[1:55:58] God living in natural people the word
[1:56:01] flowing through them and they're able to
[1:56:03] be in their place staying in their
[1:56:05] position amen and speak that word you
[1:56:09] you know you can speak the word over any
[1:56:10] situation you're
[1:56:12] in can you say Amen come on now yes sir
[1:56:15] this this isn't we're not just living in
[1:56:17] a little light enough light just to
[1:56:19] believe on Jesus Christ for forgiveness
[1:56:21] of sins and and and and join a church no
[1:56:24] the full light has
[1:56:27] come the mystery of God has been made
[1:56:29] known to us Christ in
[1:56:34] you and the full adoption now is when
[1:56:38] this old
[1:56:39] body changes at the first resurrection
[1:56:43] Philippians 3:20 for our conversation is
[1:56:45] in heaven from whence also we look for
[1:56:48] the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:56:50] shall change our our vile body he's a
[1:56:54] present help in time of
[1:56:56] trouble that it may be fashioned like
[1:56:58] unto his glorious body according to the
[1:57:01] working whereby he is able even to
[1:57:03] subdue all things unto himself aren't
[1:57:07] you glad for
[1:57:08] that so brother Bram said all creation
[1:57:10] is
[1:57:12] groaning everything is groaning look at
[1:57:14] the trees how they struggle look at the
[1:57:16] flowers how they struggle for life just
[1:57:18] for the frost to tear them down look at
[1:57:21] the trees how they struggle to hold
[1:57:22] their branches out to sing glories unto
[1:57:25] God everything all nature all animals
[1:57:27] all birds how he flies from the enemy
[1:57:29] quickly and gets away everything's
[1:57:31] groaning and we ourselves said Paul we
[1:57:34] groan too with them we were waiting for
[1:57:36] the Redemption of our body another place
[1:57:39] brother Brown said the only way you can
[1:57:41] groan and wait for it is because there
[1:57:42] has been New Life come in here that
[1:57:45] speaks of a new world can you say Amen
[1:57:48] do you love
[1:57:49] him one more quote
[1:57:53] we have the earnest that's what Paul
[1:57:54] said we have the earnest of our
[1:57:58] inheritance brother Braham said what do
[1:58:00] we have we have the evidence that God
[1:58:03] Lives we have the evidence that God is
[1:58:06] with us we have the evidence that God
[1:58:09] has not forsaken us and that we are his
[1:58:12] and he is ours because we in our bodies
[1:58:16] we now Tabernacle the holy spirit of God
[1:58:19] that cries out Abba Father and there's
[1:58:21] not nothing can ever take that away we
[1:58:25] are Anchored In Christ now the trees
[1:58:28] does not have it nature does not have it
[1:58:30] but yet we are still groaning within
[1:58:32] with them because as yet we haven't
[1:58:35] received the fullness of adoption see
[1:58:38] but we have the earnest of it that we're
[1:58:40] picked up from the things of the world
[1:58:42] and now become Sons and Daughters of God
[1:58:45] what kind of people should we be to
[1:58:49] think of that now having the earnest our
[1:58:52] spirit's groaning for the full adoption
