[47:29] father anoint the ministering of your
[47:31] word as well as the hearing we ask it
[47:34] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[47:38] amen the book of Deuteronomy the 7th
[47:42] chapter and want to start at the the
[47:45] sixth
[47:46] verse but it said for thou art and holy
[47:49] people unto the Lord thy God the Lord
[47:53] thy God hath chosen thee to be a special
[47:55] special people unto himself above all
[47:58] people that are upon the face of the
[48:00] Earth the Lord did not set his love upon
[48:03] you nor choose you because you were more
[48:06] in number than any people for you were
[48:09] the fewest of all people but because the
[48:13] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[48:15] the oath which he had sworn unto your
[48:19] fathers hath the Lord brought you out
[48:21] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[48:23] of the house of bondman
[48:26] from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt
[48:29] know therefore everybody say know
[48:33] therefore that the Lord thy God he is
[48:36] God the faithful God which keepeth
[48:39] Covenant and mercy with him that love
[48:41] him and keep his Commandments to a
[48:44] thousand
[48:46] Generations amen you can have your
[48:51] seats know therefore that the Lord he is
[48:55] God God the faithful God and I'm so glad
[48:58] he's my God and that we can know him in
[49:01] a personal way praise the Lord and uh
[49:05] this evening uh I'm going to uh just uh
[49:11] speak on the faithfulness of God again
[49:14] for we know that he is faithful how many
[49:16] believes that and uh this this word
[49:21] faithful uh it means loyal unwavering
[49:26] uh steadfast
[49:28] unmovable uh dedicated uh or devoted so
[49:34] so he is dedicated he's firm he's
[49:37] steadfast he's devoted and he's faithful
[49:41] he's loyal aren't you glad that he's
[49:43] loyal amen and so Jesus said I will
[49:47] never leave thee nor forsake thee but
[49:50] I'll be with you till the end of the
[49:53] world the end of the age and and so then
[49:57] he is faithful God is faithful we talked
[50:00] about it last Wednesday but he's
[50:02] faithful because he is eternal God being
[50:05] Eternal and and that word Eternal is
[50:09] having an infinite
[50:12] duration continued without intermission
[50:15] endless Timeless existing at all times
[50:20] without beginning and Without End so
[50:23] these are just uh some of the words that
[50:25] we would try to describe what Eternal is
[50:30] uh uh but but God being Eternal then he
[50:33] always was he always will be uh and and
[50:38] with that he cannot change he cannot be
[50:41] diminished and he can't even get greater
[50:43] than what he already is he becomes
[50:46] greater to us because he's he's
[50:48] revealing himself all the time but in
[50:51] himself he does not improve at all he he
[50:55] is is what he is and so if he is eternal
[50:59] then everything that comes from him is
[51:01] eternal so his thoughts are Eternal his
[51:05] word is eternal uh his love his faith is
[51:10] eternal his strength his Joy his peace
[51:13] it it's all Eternal his plan his purpose
[51:17] uh it's the these things are are Eternal
[51:21] his ways are Eternal and and so an
[51:25] eternal God cannot lie ain't that right
[51:28] if his word is eternal then he cannot
[51:30] lie he cannot take back his word he
[51:33] cannot um I think the Bible says that
[51:36] he's not the son of man that he should
[51:39] uh uh repent um uh man that he should
[51:42] repent he's not a man that he should lie
[51:45] and so uh uh then then his eternal
[51:48] thoughts cannot lie his word cannot lie
[51:51] his love cannot lie he cannot he cannot
[51:55] put put on a front amen uh because that
[51:58] would be lying there's no hypocrisy in
[52:00] God so his his love is true it cannot
[52:03] lie his eternal plan his eternal purpose
[52:07] cannot lie see his peace is not a fake
[52:10] peace it it it is a true peace and it
[52:12] cannot lie for it is eternal it cannot
[52:16] pass away ain't that right amen so he
[52:19] cannot love you today amen and then
[52:22] despise you tomorrow uh that that just
[52:24] can't
[52:26] uh he cannot have a place prepared for
[52:29] you today and then give it to another
[52:32] tomorrow amen because his word is
[52:35] eternal so in John 14 and2 Jesus said I
[52:39] go to prepare a place for you ain't that
[52:42] right and if I go and he's revealing his
[52:45] plan to us that if I go and prepare a
[52:48] place for you then I will come again and
[52:52] receive you not receive another but if
[52:55] he preparing a place for you then he's
[52:57] going to come back and receive you that
[53:00] you may live with him ain't that right
[53:03] wherever he is you may be there also
[53:06] ain't that right amen see well that's
[53:09] God's Eternal Word so that that he's
[53:11] faithful he's a faithful God so he
[53:13] cannot lie Amen in in that and and so if
[53:18] if he said I go to prepare a place for
[53:20] you then that means you amen so then no
[53:23] one as the prophet said can take your
[53:26] place amen he's not preparing a place
[53:28] for you amen you could buy maybe someone
[53:31] bought you something and you've
[53:32] disappointed them so they say well I I
[53:34] forget that I'm going to give it to
[53:35] somebody else well that's not God you
[53:38] can't disappoint God enough Amen to make
[53:41] him give the place that he prepared for
[53:44] you to somebody else it it just God is
[53:47] faithful ain't that right amen James
[53:50] 1:17 it says there is no variableness or
[53:54] changing neither shadow of turning with
[53:57] the Father of Lights in other words the
[54:00] uh uh the one who gave uh uh gives light
[54:03] amen he's the father of lights and and
[54:07] and uh he gives light and yet there's no
[54:09] there there's no variableness there's no
[54:12] uh changing there's there's no shadow of
[54:15] turning around because God cannot lie
[54:19] you understand what I'm saying you you
[54:21] can't hold him responsible enough he
[54:23] holds himself responsible it's his
[54:26] nature it's his character it's it's what
[54:29] he is ain't that right amen so the
[54:33] prophet said God has never had a new
[54:35] thought about anything because all his
[54:38] thoughts he has always he has always had
[54:42] and always will have and knows the end
[54:44] from the beginning because he's God thus
[54:48] the thoughts of God are Eternal and they
[54:52] are real see they're not simply like a
[54:55] man with blue a blueprint he has drawn
[54:57] up and which one day will be translated
[55:01] into substance and form but they are
[55:04] already real and are Eternal and part of
[55:08] God aren't you glad for that amen so so
[55:12] everything that is a part of God is
[55:14] eternal amen and what we're seeing is
[55:17] the faithfulness of God Amen we don't
[55:19] need a new book God's not writing a new
[55:22] Bible every word that he promised in
[55:25] this Bible he is fulfilling amen that
[55:28] that's exactly right your salvation
[55:30] wasn't new to God he ought already
[55:33] ordained that he's just showing his
[55:35] faithfulness to you in at this point
[55:38] amen see so in in Isaiah 5511 God said
[55:43] that my word that goeth forth out of my
[55:45] mouth shall not return unto me void it
[55:48] shall accomplish that which I please and
[55:51] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[55:54] sin it ain't that right Jesus said
[55:57] another place Heaven and Earth will pass
[55:59] away but my word will never it shall
[56:03] never pass away ain't that right so Paul
[56:07] would tell us in Hebrews 10 and 23 let
[56:10] us hold fast the profession or
[56:13] confession of our faith without what
[56:18] without wavering and I I think that that
[56:20] means something to us right there Amen
[56:22] Let Us hold fast the profession of our
[56:25] faith without wavering don't don't let
[56:27] it go up and down without changing for
[56:31] he is faithful everybody say he is
[56:33] faithful that promised amen see so our
[56:37] our our uh uh one one uh uh um
[56:41] translation it says let us hold fast the
[56:44] confession of our faith keep it firmly
[56:48] secured without wavering see without
[56:51] fluctuating in opinion Allegiance or for
[56:55] direction can you say Amen see well God
[56:58] is faithful to his word so he will never
[57:01] fluctuate in his opinion of you he will
[57:04] never uh uh alter his his idea of you he
[57:08] will never change direction for you amen
[57:11] everything that he has said about you
[57:14] it's already Eternal it's the it's it's
[57:17] forever the same so he does not
[57:20] fluctuate in his allegiance to you his
[57:22] opinion to you or his direction to you
[57:26] ain't that right so now we are told amen
[57:29] that if we're going to base our our
[57:32] confession upon the word of God we have
[57:34] to know that he's faithful that promise
[57:36] so he'll never change he'll never alter
[57:40] he'll he he he will never fail so let us
[57:44] let us keep the confession of our faith
[57:47] without wavering let us not fluctuate
[57:51] let us not change in our opinion of him
[57:54] let us not change our Allegiance can you
[57:56] say Amen see the Promise is sure because
[58:00] he is faithful you see God will move the
[58:04] mountains to show that he is faithful he
[58:06] will roll back the Red Sea because he is
[58:09] faithful he wants to show himself as a
[58:12] faithful God can you say amen amen a lot
[58:15] of times he doesn't keep us from from uh
[58:18] uh from the Lion's Den he doesn't keep
[58:20] us from the things amen that would seem
[58:22] to devour us he allows us to face things
[58:26] but he wants to show to us that he is
[58:30] faithful to his word amen that's right
[58:33] he'll roll back the Red Seas he'll close
[58:35] the mouths of the lion to show that he
[58:38] is faithful to his word ain't that right
[58:41] to think of it he was made flesh and
[58:43] became Our Redeemer to show that he is
[58:46] faithful to his word amen we know what
[58:49] Redemption means it means to bring back
[58:52] Amen to uh uh bring back that which had
[58:55] fallen amen put it back to its rightful
[58:58] place its rightful condition ain't that
[59:01] right amen and he to show that he's
[59:04] faithful to his word amen became Our
[59:08] Redeemer amen he's the faithful Redeemer
[59:12] ain't that right amen and it goes to
[59:14] show that no matter how low a man has
[59:17] fallen and a woman has gone it doesn't
[59:20] matter how far amen as the song says God
[59:23] reach way the bottom for me amen he can
[59:27] do that because he's the faithful God
[59:30] ain't that right see amen could you
[59:32] imagine if he could not redeem all of
[59:34] his subjects amen then what's the point
[59:37] of trying to be a redeemer if he was
[59:39] limited in what he could do but he to
[59:41] show that he is faithful he allows us to
[59:45] go through all kinds of Hell allows us
[59:48] to go through all kinds of things allows
[59:51] us to be scarred and battled and and and
[59:54] all of the these things and yet here we
[59:56] stand tonight because God is faithful
[1:00:00] God is faithful can you say that God is
[1:00:03] faithful amen see now the prophet said
[1:00:06] the predestinated is the only one that's
[1:00:09] considered in Redemption see people
[1:00:12] might be thinking like uh uh making like
[1:00:15] and think they are but the real
[1:00:17] Redemption is those that are
[1:00:20] predestinated amen see predestinated so
[1:00:24] God is faithful amen so we are loose by
[1:00:27] his own blood ain't that right which is
[1:00:30] a perfect blood Amen in Hebrews 10:4 for
[1:00:34] by one offering he has perfected forever
[1:00:39] them that are Sanctified ain't that
[1:00:41] right he ain't going to do a halfway job
[1:00:44] amen God is faithful ain't that right
[1:00:47] amen he doesn't he doesn't make you a
[1:00:49] Halfway Christian amen if any if
[1:00:53] anything the devil makes a guy halfway
[1:00:56] amen but God will never make you a
[1:00:58] Halfway Christian you'll never be a
[1:01:00] halfway son a halfway daughter of God
[1:01:03] ain't that right God is faithful to his
[1:01:06] word and so by one offering he ha
[1:01:10] perfected forever amen them that are
[1:01:13] Sanctified now notice Hebrews 2 and7 it
[1:01:17] says wherefore in all things it behooved
[1:01:20] him to be made like unto his brethren
[1:01:24] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:01:29] high priest aren't you glad you got a
[1:01:31] faithful high priest amen amen he became
[1:01:35] and the faithful God became the high
[1:01:37] priest amen that he could we could have
[1:01:40] a faithful high priest amen no other
[1:01:42] high priest can be faithful amen but
[1:01:45] here is a faithful high priest in things
[1:01:48] pertaining to God to make
[1:01:52] reconciliation for the sin
[1:01:54] of the people aren't you glad for that
[1:01:58] well what is a high priest it it makes
[1:02:00] uh uh intercession amen for the
[1:02:03] worshipper so he is the faithful high
[1:02:06] priest who Faithfully makes
[1:02:09] intercessions for you and I aren't you
[1:02:11] glad for that amen so so your your
[1:02:14] cloudy days doesn't affect him amen your
[1:02:17] ups and downs doesn't affect him your
[1:02:19] trials doesn't affect him your mistakes
[1:02:22] doesn't affect him he's the one that is
[1:02:24] faithful he's the one that is merciful
[1:02:27] he's the one that is Faithfully making
[1:02:30] intercession for you and I amen how else
[1:02:34] can you make it here
[1:02:35] tonight can you say
[1:02:37] Amen so we find Hebrews 7 and 24 this
[1:02:41] man because he continueth continueth
[1:02:45] forever a man hath an unchangeable
[1:02:48] priesthood wherefore he is able to save
[1:02:52] them to the uttermost that come unto God
[1:02:55] by him seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:03:00] intercession for them can you say Amen
[1:03:05] now but according to Hebrews uh 3 and 1
[1:03:09] it says he is the high priest of our
[1:03:12] profession or confession he is the high
[1:03:15] priest of our confession and confession
[1:03:18] means to say the same thing as ain't
[1:03:20] that right amen see so he's the high
[1:03:23] faithful high priest priest of our
[1:03:25] confession brother brandham said he's
[1:03:27] the high priest of our confession then
[1:03:30] he cannot do one thing for you cannot
[1:03:33] make any intercession until you confess
[1:03:37] that it's done so now don't you waver
[1:03:40] hold fast to that confession of faith
[1:03:43] without wavering for he is faithful that
[1:03:46] promise can you say amen amen see so the
[1:03:49] the every the moment you start making
[1:03:51] your confession he is faithful to make
[1:03:55] intercession to that confession ain't
[1:03:57] that right he said see you until you
[1:03:59] confess that it's done see is that
[1:04:01] scripture he's the high priest of our
[1:04:04] confession then he can only act when we
[1:04:08] confess now there is no human being on
[1:04:11] the face of the Earth from time from the
[1:04:13] beginning of time to now or even till
[1:04:16] the end of time that could ever accuse
[1:04:19] God of not being faithful that's right
[1:04:21] amen that's right see amen the prophet
[1:04:24] says see when a man uh uh comes God's
[1:04:27] provided way amen then he will see him
[1:04:31] in his faithfulness when you come God's
[1:04:35] provided way because God is Not faithful
[1:04:37] Amen to the stock market God is Not
[1:04:40] faithful Amen to the president and what
[1:04:42] he says and the lies and and the things
[1:04:45] that are going on in a politician amen a
[1:04:47] politici can say it but God's not
[1:04:49] faithful to that he's faithful to his
[1:04:52] own word ain't that right yes sir he's
[1:04:55] faithful see so then John 1 John 1:9
[1:04:59] says if everybody say if now that's a
[1:05:02] big one now if we confess our sin he is
[1:05:06] faithful and just to forgive our sins
[1:05:10] and to cleanse us from all
[1:05:12] unrighteousness ain't that right amen
[1:05:15] see so first of all we've got to confess
[1:05:17] our sins and then we see his
[1:05:19] faithfulness step in amen and he's
[1:05:22] faithful and just to forgive our sins oh
[1:05:26] aren't you glad for that Amen to think
[1:05:29] that God was faithful he was fixing to
[1:05:31] send uh uh uh his wrath upon the Earth
[1:05:34] in the time of Noah that God's
[1:05:36] faithfulness to that elect amen that he
[1:05:39] would provide a prophet amen and through
[1:05:42] that Prophet would be established an ark
[1:05:45] amen as a way of Escape God was faithful
[1:05:49] to provide the ark as a way of Escape
[1:05:52] amen and then the elect amen were
[1:05:55] faithful everybody say faithful they
[1:05:57] were faithful Amen to believe the pro
[1:06:00] the the message that that Prophet was
[1:06:02] bringing and they got into the ark ain't
[1:06:06] that right and God was faithful to them
[1:06:09] for he his faithfulness he carried them
[1:06:13] over in all that Troubled Water he would
[1:06:16] never let that Ark drown his faithful
[1:06:19] elect was in that Ark and he was going
[1:06:22] to prove his faithfulness it was
[1:06:24] impossible for that boat to float amen
[1:06:27] but God was faithful they were not just
[1:06:30] resed in that Ark and the ability of
[1:06:32] that Ark they were resting in the god
[1:06:35] that they had believed in yes sir amen
[1:06:38] and God took them over into the new
[1:06:42] world Amen just before the death angel
[1:06:45] amen was getting ready to strike the
[1:06:47] land of Egypt amen God was faithful Amen
[1:06:52] to give them amen a divided way and told
[1:06:55] them to slay a lamb through the prophet
[1:06:58] of that day amen to slay the lamb and
[1:07:01] put the blood upon the door of the of
[1:07:04] the post amen God provided a token ain't
[1:07:07] that right and he said God told him this
[1:07:09] will be a token unto you amen that when
[1:07:11] I see the blood I will pass over you
[1:07:15] amen and those that had went in God's
[1:07:17] provided way amen God was faithful to
[1:07:20] them they didn't have to worry about it
[1:07:23] they didn't have to Fe here amen when
[1:07:25] they began to hear the screams they
[1:07:26] didn't have to go into panic mode and
[1:07:29] start popping pills and nerve pills and
[1:07:32] this and that and see the psychologist
[1:07:34] and the psychiatrist and go to the
[1:07:36] hospital and lose their minds you
[1:07:38] understand what I'm saying amen a lot of
[1:07:40] the sickness that is going on is because
[1:07:42] people are worrying too much but they
[1:07:45] didn't have to worry under that
[1:07:47] token because God was faithful to them
[1:07:50] ain't that right God was faithful you
[1:07:53] know the prophet said they didn't have
[1:07:54] to do nothing but just rest in God's
[1:07:58] provided way rest under that token and
[1:08:01] he said this for them to be scared would
[1:08:04] have been an insult to Jehovah amen for
[1:08:07] them to be scared would be an insult you
[1:08:10] see if God provides something for us
[1:08:14] amen and we don't trust him to be
[1:08:17] faithful in that amen then it's an
[1:08:19] insult to his very character his word
[1:08:23] ain't that right amen you see brother
[1:08:26] brandom gave the reason as to why so
[1:08:28] many Christians are afraid today he said
[1:08:31] they are afraid that God won't keep his
[1:08:33] word you realize that's an insult Amen
[1:08:36] to God when you're afraid that he won't
[1:08:38] keep his word the doctor says you're
[1:08:40] going to die but and then all of a
[1:08:42] sudden fear strike that's an insult Amen
[1:08:45] to God because you got a greater promise
[1:08:47] amen I am the god that Health thee can
[1:08:50] you say Amen he's faithful so the
[1:08:53] prophet said said see if a man once
[1:08:55] under the blood feels afraid that God
[1:08:58] won't keep his word it's an insult to
[1:09:01] him say Well Jehovah perhaps this is
[1:09:03] your word but I don't know whether it's
[1:09:06] right or or not oh shame on you amen why
[1:09:09] once under the blood he said I'm the
[1:09:12] Lord that Health Thee Well I believe it
[1:09:14] that's all don't insult him don't insult
[1:09:19] him he's faithful can you say amen amen
[1:09:22] and he'll move in his own timing he'll
[1:09:25] move when he wants to move but he's
[1:09:27] faithful to his word amen he he didn't
[1:09:30] promise us a Bed of Roses but he said
[1:09:33] I'll be with you he's faithful he's a
[1:09:36] faithful
[1:09:37] God do you believe
[1:09:39] that now the Bible talks about a
[1:09:42] faithful people amen and Moses was
[1:09:46] faithful in all his house Abraham is
[1:09:49] called the faithful Abraham uh Peter in
[1:09:52] his right writings mentioned a man uh
[1:09:55] named uh sylvanus and called him a
[1:09:58] faithful brother uh there are several
[1:10:01] men that Paul mentions in his writings
[1:10:04] and and calling them faithful Brothers
[1:10:06] uh faithful ministers and and and and
[1:10:09] these things even Paul himself uh uh
[1:10:12] speaking of himself said the Lord
[1:10:15] counted me faithful amen uh of the Lord
[1:10:18] he said I was counted faithful of the
[1:10:19] Lord and was put into the ministry amen
[1:10:23] then he tells Timothy a young Pastor he
[1:10:26] he says now he uh uh uh he talking about
[1:10:29] the word that he had heard uh uh that he
[1:10:32] had learned he said now commit that unto
[1:10:34] Faithful Men amen faithful faithful amen
[1:10:38] see Paul's letter that he wrote to the
[1:10:40] colossian church amen it was addressed
[1:10:42] to the Saints and the faithful brethren
[1:10:46] in Christ his letter to the Ephesian
[1:10:48] church was addressed to the Saints which
[1:10:51] are in Ephesus and to the faithful in
[1:10:53] Christ Jesus I I think that's remarkable
[1:10:56] how he doesn't just say to the Saints
[1:10:58] but he makes sure that these men and
[1:11:01] these women are faithful they're they're
[1:11:03] they're faithful amen see amen and and
[1:11:07] brother Brandon uh said it was addressed
[1:11:10] to the called Chosen and faithful in
[1:11:13] Christ Jesus amen according to The
[1:11:17] Parables that that Jesus gave of this
[1:11:19] end time amen uh there there's uh uh uh
[1:11:24] there's going to be those who's going to
[1:11:25] hear the word amen when it's all said
[1:11:28] and done they're going to hear the words
[1:11:29] well done thou good and faithful not
[1:11:33] just thou servant well done my son my
[1:11:35] daughter but thou good and faithful
[1:11:38] servant enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:11:42] God I I think God wants us to really
[1:11:44] understand that that that there's a
[1:11:46] faithful group of people that is upon
[1:11:49] this Earth amen and that's what he calls
[1:11:51] you is faithful faithful faith F amen
[1:11:54] that that's a term that God would use I
[1:11:57] I think that's an honor when God himself
[1:11:59] would call Us Faithful amen that's
[1:12:02] powerful amen Revelation 17 and4 it says
[1:12:06] thee shall make war with the lamb and
[1:12:09] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:12:11] Lord of lords and king of kings and they
[1:12:14] that are with him are called Chosen and
[1:12:19] faithful called and chosen and faithful
[1:12:23] can you say amen amen so the Believers
[1:12:26] of today amen we we look at the Through
[1:12:29] the Bible and we see the faithful ones
[1:12:31] but look at us today there is a people
[1:12:34] who are called and chosen and faithful
[1:12:38] amen faithful of called of God chosen of
[1:12:42] God and faithful to God Amen we talked a
[1:12:46] Wednesday night last Wednesday of how
[1:12:48] that people can be faithful to the wrong
[1:12:50] things and and yet our faithfulness is
[1:12:52] limited and all these things but there
[1:12:55] is a group when they're faithful to God
[1:12:58] a ain't that right now we we think of
[1:13:01] this the call and the choosing see the
[1:13:04] calling and choosing of God must be
[1:13:07] included in order for there to be
[1:13:10] faithfulness faithfulness well how can
[1:13:13] there be faithfulness in man alone amen
[1:13:16] for Isaiah 40 and6 says all flesh is as
[1:13:19] grass or is grass amen and all the good
[1:13:23] good
[1:13:23] thereof is as the flower of the field
[1:13:26] the grass withereth the flower fadeth
[1:13:28] but the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon
[1:13:30] it or because the spirit of the Lord
[1:13:32] bloweth upon it surely the people is
[1:13:34] grass the grass withereth the fire
[1:13:36] fadeth but what the word everybody say
[1:13:40] the word of our God shall stand forever
[1:13:44] so there's really about man alone if
[1:13:47] you're just looking at man alone there's
[1:13:49] nothing that is faithful about him he's
[1:13:51] here today gone tomorrow so is his mind
[1:13:54] so is his thought so is his actions so
[1:13:57] is his plans everything about man he may
[1:14:00] have it today and could be gone tomorrow
[1:14:03] can you say amen that's right amen see
[1:14:06] so so if you take the word of the Lord
[1:14:09] out of man then the faithfulness cannot
[1:14:12] be found in him look through the history
[1:14:15] of mankind from the beginning of time to
[1:14:19] uh uh all the way there is absolutely no
[1:14:21] stability in Humanity a ain't that right
[1:14:25] anytime you look to a man you're going
[1:14:27] to be let down anytime you look to
[1:14:29] yourself you're going to be disappointed
[1:14:32] amen because faithfulness cannot be
[1:14:34] found in mankind but yet God would say
[1:14:38] that there is faithful people amen
[1:14:41] there's a Faithful Men faithful women
[1:14:43] faithful young people amen but this
[1:14:45] faithfulness for a minute that I'm
[1:14:46] speaking of aen is faithful to God and
[1:14:50] His word faithful to believe the word
[1:14:53] faithful to follow and obey the word
[1:14:56] faithful to confess the word faithful to
[1:15:00] consider that God is faithful can you
[1:15:02] say Amen they're faithful everything
[1:15:04] about this faithfulness in this people
[1:15:07] is faithfulness to the word of God now
[1:15:10] we're living in a in an age it's the
[1:15:12] greatest deception as we know the
[1:15:14] prophet told us a man ever known to man
[1:15:17] which is causing men to be unfaithful to
[1:15:21] the word of God now we talk about
[1:15:23] unfaithfulness there's so much
[1:15:25] unfaithfulness uh in marriages
[1:15:27] unfaithfulness uh to the job to the boss
[1:15:29] to the amen to anything anymore it's
[1:15:32] hard to trust people but but it's
[1:15:34] leaking more than anything it's
[1:15:37] unfaithfulness to God Amen
[1:15:39] unfaithfulness see unto the word of God
[1:15:42] and and Matthew
[1:15:44] 721 says not everyone that saith unto me
[1:15:48] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:15:51] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[1:15:54] My Father which is in heaven many will
[1:15:58] say unto me in that day Lord Lord have
[1:16:01] we not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[1:16:03] name have cast out devils and in thy
[1:16:05] name done many wonderful works and then
[1:16:08] will I profess unto them I never knew
[1:16:10] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:16:15] a ain't that right see so what were they
[1:16:17] they yes they done the miracle yes they
[1:16:20] prophesied yes they cast that devil but
[1:16:22] they were not faithful to the word of
[1:16:25] God which was the will of God ain't that
[1:16:28] right well see the carnal man won't
[1:16:30] allow us to be faithful to God Amen see
[1:16:34] because the carnal is enmity against God
[1:16:37] it cannot be subject to God or or to the
[1:16:40] law of God Amen it just it just isn't
[1:16:42] it's a wild nature it's it's rebellious
[1:16:46] can you say Amen so a man can be
[1:16:48] religious and not faithful to the word
[1:16:51] of God he can be a singer a musician
[1:16:53] even a minister and yet not faithful
[1:16:56] Amen to the word of God ain't that right
[1:16:59] and because people don't have have
[1:17:03] something within them to keep them
[1:17:06] faithful amen then they're going to be
[1:17:08] deceived Amen in this great age of
[1:17:11] deception for the Bible tells us that
[1:17:13] all who have not their names written in
[1:17:16] the Lamb's Book of Life shall wander
[1:17:19] after the Beast ain't that right and he
[1:17:21] made the whole world amen worship Him
[1:17:25] amen see both great and small rich and
[1:17:27] poor and and all of these things and
[1:17:29] Revelations 129 it says that the Great
[1:17:32] Dragon the old serpent called the devil
[1:17:35] and and uh deceiveth the whole world can
[1:17:39] you imagine that deceiveth the whole
[1:17:41] world but then Jesus would tell us but
[1:17:44] he that endureth to the end the same
[1:17:48] shall be saved oh Church there's a
[1:17:52] people that's going to endure and God
[1:17:55] will call them faithful they are called
[1:17:59] and chosen and faithful can you say Amen
[1:18:03] well let's just put it just bluntly it's
[1:18:07] the predestinated that's going to remain
[1:18:10] it's the predestinated that's going to
[1:18:12] be faithful it's the predestinated
[1:18:15] that's going to endure amen see for
[1:18:18] Jesus already said it is impossible for
[1:18:21] that elect to to be deceived how many
[1:18:24] believes that it's impossible for that
[1:18:27] elect to be uh swayed and and and come
[1:18:30] under a deception for they are called in
[1:18:34] Christ and chosen in Christ and faithful
[1:18:38] in Christ yes sir the prophet said they
[1:18:42] have been chosen before the foundation
[1:18:44] of the world and are abiding everybody
[1:18:47] say abiding abiding in their calling
[1:18:51] amen they're not maybe doing a a lot of
[1:18:53] tricks and a lot of excitement but
[1:18:55] they're abiding can you say Amen they
[1:18:58] may not have a worldwide Ministry but
[1:19:00] they're abiding amen they might not be
[1:19:02] known by the world but they're abiding
[1:19:05] in their calling amen that's the
[1:19:07] greatest thing amen than anything that
[1:19:10] could ever be done is to abide abide in
[1:19:13] the promise abide in the word remain
[1:19:15] faithful Amen to the word of God Amen
[1:19:18] and they shall overcome amen they shall
[1:19:21] everybody say they shall
[1:19:23] they shall overcome no matter how bad it
[1:19:26] gets no matter how how low they feel no
[1:19:31] matter how discouraged it they seem amen
[1:19:34] they're going to overcome the enemy can
[1:19:36] you say Amen they're going to be
[1:19:38] faithful faithful faithful amen well how
[1:19:41] in the world are they going to do it how
[1:19:43] are they going to be faithful if
[1:19:44] faithfulness cannot be found in human
[1:19:47] Humanity how where's this faithful
[1:19:49] coming faithfulness coming from well
[1:19:51] Philippians 1 six being confident of
[1:19:54] this very thing that he everybody say he
[1:19:57] who's he the faithful God Amen he which
[1:20:01] has begun a good work in you will
[1:20:03] perform it will complete it amen he
[1:20:06] ain't going to save you today and lose
[1:20:08] you tomor he ain't going to fill you
[1:20:10] with his own life and say you're sealed
[1:20:12] only for you to be disappointed at the
[1:20:14] end if you're sealed if you're saved you
[1:20:17] always were saved you'll be saved
[1:20:20] tomorrow you'll be saved today you'll be
[1:20:22] Sav 10 years from now amen you'll be
[1:20:25] saved in the Rapture amen if he done it
[1:20:27] once he it's
[1:20:29] forever amen can you say Amen he's going
[1:20:33] to he's going to finish the work if he
[1:20:35] began it he's going to finish it can you
[1:20:37] say Amen Church aren't you glad for that
[1:20:40] amen see amen so well when did he begin
[1:20:42] the work amen well Romans 8:29 we all
[1:20:46] know it for whom he did Forno he also
[1:20:48] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:20:51] image of his son that he might be the
[1:20:53] firstborn among many Brethren more over
[1:20:56] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:20:58] called and whom he called them he also
[1:21:01] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:21:03] also what glorified now he already began
[1:21:07] the
[1:21:08] work and I I'll say it this way he's
[1:21:11] already finished the work he began it he
[1:21:13] finished it way before you even started
[1:21:16] amen that's how faithful he is a amen
[1:21:20] that that's right see and so therefore
[1:21:23] predestinated you have a gene seed of
[1:21:26] God laying inside of you you believe it
[1:21:29] Prophet said it's God's Gene it's his
[1:21:32] Gene it's his seed that's right amen see
[1:21:35] so then what is it that makes a man
[1:21:38] faithful to God Amen well you know we
[1:21:40] were born Sinners as we know in our
[1:21:42] natural birth had a love for the world
[1:21:44] and the things of the world but the
[1:21:46] prophet said be then but then there was
[1:21:49] a little life grain of Life laying down
[1:21:52] in with in us we had a sinful nature but
[1:21:55] then there was another nature in Us by
[1:21:58] predestination brother brandom called it
[1:22:00] a little spot of eternal life down there
[1:22:03] the genes of God the word of God that
[1:22:05] was placed in there amen and I believe
[1:22:08] it's still working do you believe that
[1:22:10] amen see so while you was a sinner no
[1:22:12] matter what you had done and and and all
[1:22:15] these things and maybe even running away
[1:22:17] from church and running away from
[1:22:18] religion and God and this message or
[1:22:21] wherever you were
[1:22:23] there was still a gene seed of God
[1:22:25] that's laying in you that's why we
[1:22:27] believe amen that we can lay claim to
[1:22:29] our loved ones we can we believe that we
[1:22:31] can lay claim to our children amen it's
[1:22:34] a word of God it's a seed of God and God
[1:22:37] remains faithful to his
[1:22:39] word do you believe that amen now the
[1:22:42] prophet said we only catered to our F
[1:22:44] first birth our first nature because you
[1:22:47] know we didn't have that new birth and
[1:22:50] yet that genan seed was working working
[1:22:52] there all along Lord we couldn't be
[1:22:55] satisfied in the world we couldn't be
[1:22:58] satisfied in
[1:22:59] religion can you say amen I think all of
[1:23:02] us can can bear record to that we just
[1:23:04] weren't satisfied amen but but because
[1:23:08] there was something within us that was
[1:23:10] already working and that was that grain
[1:23:12] of eternal life amen see and and and the
[1:23:16] psalmist called it the Deep calleth unto
[1:23:18] the deep it was a desire amen something
[1:23:21] that was craving for God even though we
[1:23:23] didn't know we were craving for God Amen
[1:23:26] but there was it it was craving for God
[1:23:29] it was craving it was longing for
[1:23:31] something ain't that right amen couldn't
[1:23:34] be satisfied at the beer parties
[1:23:35] couldn't be be satisfied with the drugs
[1:23:38] it couldn't be satisfied with the sex it
[1:23:40] couldn't be satisfied with what the all
[1:23:43] this entertainment that the world had to
[1:23:45] offer is because there was that life
[1:23:48] that was laying there and the Deep was
[1:23:50] calling to the Deep amen
[1:23:53] it was a desire a desire for God can you
[1:23:56] say amen amen but notice Church a desire
[1:23:59] for God is not something that just
[1:24:01] automatically comes to every human being
[1:24:04] amen it it doesn't come by your natural
[1:24:06] birth amen the prophet said it's
[1:24:09] actually a creation amen for that desire
[1:24:12] to be in your heart God first had to
[1:24:14] create it amen he had to create that
[1:24:16] desire can you say amen he says see
[1:24:19] before you can have a desire there has
[1:24:21] to be a creator to create that desire
[1:24:23] I'm going to ask you how many desires
[1:24:25] for more of God do you desire to have
[1:24:28] more of God now see that's not humanly
[1:24:30] possible for you to do that especially
[1:24:32] in this age we look at all the
[1:24:33] enticements look at all the deception
[1:24:36] look at everything that's out there and
[1:24:38] yet there's something that is longing
[1:24:40] amen there's a lot of people that are
[1:24:41] just satisfied being baptized and and
[1:24:43] putting their name on the roll and and
[1:24:45] doing this and shaking a preacher hand
[1:24:47] they're satisfied with being preachers
[1:24:48] they're satisfied playing in church
[1:24:50] they're satisfied with with just joining
[1:24:52] into church a lodge it and all of these
[1:24:54] things but there's something in a true
[1:24:56] blue Born Again child of God a true seed
[1:25:00] of God that's Desiring for more of God
[1:25:03] reaching for more because God created
[1:25:05] that within you amen he created that
[1:25:09] amen Satan doing everything he can to
[1:25:11] stifle that but God will never let it be
[1:25:15] stifled right then you say amen God
[1:25:19] created that desire so the Bible says it
[1:25:21] is he that has made us and not we
[1:25:23] ourselves Paul would tell us I am what I
[1:25:26] am by the grace of God so that desire
[1:25:29] comes from that Eternal Gene seed that
[1:25:31] was placed in us we desire to be part of
[1:25:35] the promises of God we desire to to be
[1:25:38] saved and redeemed we desire to be in
[1:25:40] that Rapture and to live eternally with
[1:25:43] him we desire to walk with God we desire
[1:25:46] for all of his word to be made known to
[1:25:48] us we desire to be conformed to His
[1:25:51] Image amen we desire no matter how much
[1:25:53] it cuts and how much it hurts we desire
[1:25:56] for his character to be molded within us
[1:25:59] can you say amen amen see amen so he
[1:26:03] creates that desire and brother Brown
[1:26:05] said no man ever come to him empty and
[1:26:09] went away Desiring to be filled but what
[1:26:12] was filled amen so you'll never come to
[1:26:15] God Desiring something but what God
[1:26:17] won't give the heart's desire that's
[1:26:20] right see see so so here we find amen 1
[1:26:24] Thessalonians 5:24 it says faithful
[1:26:28] everybody say Faithful Is He that
[1:26:30] calleth you who will also do it amen see
[1:26:35] Faithful Is He that calleth you who also
[1:26:38] will do it so it's not you just running
[1:26:41] all out here and wanting to be something
[1:26:43] and God's wanting something and your
[1:26:44] desire is being something different than
[1:26:46] what he is but he's already created
[1:26:48] desire amen for you to be like him
[1:26:52] yes sir see now the Bible says that we
[1:26:55] are the bride of Christ you believe that
[1:26:58] which means that we are flesh of his
[1:27:00] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[1:27:03] Spirit of his Spirit we are him she is
[1:27:06] him see we have his very own life within
[1:27:11] us ain't that right you see now notice
[1:27:14] after John baptized Jesus and uh he saw
[1:27:19] the spirit of God descending from heaven
[1:27:21] like an to a dove amen it was in the
[1:27:24] shape of a dove and it descended Upon
[1:27:26] Jesus see and and and and and we know
[1:27:29] that the holy spirit is represented as a
[1:27:32] dove because of its nature Amen brother
[1:27:35] brandham and speaking of uh the wings of
[1:27:38] a of a dove he says see the dove is a
[1:27:41] sign of Peace in every nation because of
[1:27:43] its gentleness and and innocence but
[1:27:46] also the dove whether male or female is
[1:27:50] always loyal amen faithful to its
[1:27:55] mate see and and so that's that's what
[1:27:58] was coming John saw that same nature
[1:28:01] coming into Christ and Christ says I can
[1:28:04] only do what the father first showed me
[1:28:05] to do my me is to do the will of him
[1:28:08] that sent me he was faithful he was
[1:28:11] faithful can you say amen he was
[1:28:13] faithful to you he was loyal to you you
[1:28:17] say well how can he be that he went to
[1:28:18] the cross for you he bore the shame for
[1:28:21] you he was willful he was despised and
[1:28:23] rejected he bore our sorrow he bore our
[1:28:27] shame he was loyal to you ain't that
[1:28:30] right but think of it see the spirit now
[1:28:33] is now upon the bride Same Spirit same
[1:28:38] life same nature amen ain't that right
[1:28:43] Romans 8:11 says but if the spirit of
[1:28:45] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:28:47] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:28:49] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:28:51] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:28:53] dwelleth in you ain't that right see you
[1:28:56] were you were going one way and
[1:28:58] something changed you around and you've
[1:29:00] never wanted to go that way again you
[1:29:03] never wanted to go out to the pool
[1:29:05] parties you never wanted to go out and
[1:29:06] drink and and curse and act like a
[1:29:10] you never wanted to take them drugs you
[1:29:12] never wanted to go out in the world
[1:29:13] again your desire has been
[1:29:17] changed can you say Amen why because
[1:29:20] you've received the spirit of that Dove
[1:29:23] amen that is within you and brother Bram
[1:29:25] says may I stop here just a moment and
[1:29:27] say this a true bride faithful or a
[1:29:30] female dove is loyal to her mate too see
[1:29:35] it won't eject in dogmas and any
[1:29:37] denominational doctrines or anything of
[1:29:40] the world it'll stay loyal to its mate
[1:29:43] the word always
[1:29:46] loyal aren't you glad he's made you
[1:29:49] Faithful yes sir see but also so the
[1:29:52] dove is a h loving bird amen and and so
[1:29:57] uh uh uh brother rown said it it for
[1:30:00] years it's been successfully used for a
[1:30:02] carrier pigeon they take that pigeon off
[1:30:05] somewhere long ways away and they'll let
[1:30:07] that pigeon loose and it'll go back home
[1:30:10] ain't that right he said because it
[1:30:12] loves home you turn it loose anywhere
[1:30:14] it'll always go back home it'll go home
[1:30:17] ain't that right well Church we've been
[1:30:19] loosed the Bible says we been loose from
[1:30:22] our sins amen we were slaves we were
[1:30:25] Vagabond we were a puppet to the devil
[1:30:28] but we've been loose by the blood of God
[1:30:31] by a perfect blood and the prophet said
[1:30:34] if it's a perfect blood that we've been
[1:30:36] loosed by then it's a perfect loosening
[1:30:39] and what are we doing we're going home
[1:30:42] we realize this ain't our home we were
[1:30:45] taken here but it's not our home can you
[1:30:47] say Amen yes sir we're going back to
[1:30:50] where we come from you you're talking
[1:30:52] about a faithful
[1:30:53] people that's right ain't that right a
[1:30:57] faithful people sir yes sir see so as
[1:31:01] the Eternal logos was manifested in
[1:31:04] Jesus Christ and
[1:31:06] him uh uh and in him dwelt the fullness
[1:31:09] of the godhead bodily it was the Eternal
[1:31:12] Father manifested in flesh thereby
[1:31:14] gaining the title of son just
[1:31:17] paraphrasing what brother brandham said
[1:31:18] there and see then he says even we
[1:31:22] are Eternal in his thoughts and in time
[1:31:26] we have become the many membered spoken
[1:31:29] word seed manifest In the Flesh amen can
[1:31:32] you say Amen we are the Eternal thoughts
[1:31:36] of God made
[1:31:40] flesh ain't that right and and are the
[1:31:44] sons of God not going to be the sons we
[1:31:47] are
[1:31:49] Sons I hope you see that this face
[1:31:51] faithfulness that's going all the way
[1:31:53] through our lives God is
[1:31:56] faithful can you say Amen not just a
[1:32:00] thought of God but now the word becoming
[1:32:03] flesh
[1:32:04] right that thought becoming
[1:32:07] material and brother Bram said we did
[1:32:10] not become seed by rebirth we were seed
[1:32:12] therefore were reborn for only the elect
[1:32:15] can be reborn because we were seed is
[1:32:18] the reason we could be quickened in
[1:32:20] nonseed there is nothing to Quicken amen
[1:32:23] can you say amen amen that's right now
[1:32:27] notice Philippians 2:13 it is God which
[1:32:31] worketh in you yes sir both to Will and
[1:32:35] to
[1:32:37] do it is God say it with me it is
[1:32:41] God which worketh in me in me both to
[1:32:46] Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:32:50] pleas right aren't you glad for that so
[1:32:54] here 1 John 4:4 you are of God little
[1:32:57] children and have overcome them because
[1:33:00] greater is he that is in the
[1:33:03] heavens greater is he that is in you
[1:33:07] than he that is in this
[1:33:10] world is that what the Revelation said
[1:33:13] they are the called and chosen and
[1:33:16] faithful and they have overcome him
[1:33:19] right that's right oh man Church you
[1:33:22] think well I'm I'm just barely going to
[1:33:24] make it no no no you're called
[1:33:27] faithful now this has already been
[1:33:29] written of you
[1:33:32] Faithful well I don't know I might get
[1:33:34] deceived you if you're predestinated
[1:33:36] seed you can't get deceived it's already
[1:33:39] been written of you you're faithful yes
[1:33:41] sir called chosen
[1:33:44] faithful the book has already been
[1:33:48] written amen can you say Amen
[1:33:52] yes sir well see so brother brand would
[1:33:54] talk like this when this body receives
[1:33:56] the spirit of God The Immortal Life
[1:33:58] inside of you it throws this body in
[1:34:01] subjection to God yeah see Hallelujah he
[1:34:05] that is born of sin does not commit sin
[1:34:07] he cannot sin see Romans 8:1 there is
[1:34:11] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:34:13] that are in Christ Jesus they walk not
[1:34:16] after the flesh but after the spirit see
[1:34:18] there you are that throws your body see
[1:34:21] you don't have to say oh if I could just
[1:34:22] quit drinking if I could just just get
[1:34:24] in Christ and it's all gone because your
[1:34:27] body is subject to the spirit it's no
[1:34:30] more subject to the things of the world
[1:34:32] they're dead they're dead your sins are
[1:34:35] buried in baptism and you are a new
[1:34:38] creation in Christ and your body
[1:34:40] becoming subject to the spirit tried to
[1:34:43] live a right kind of Life can you say
[1:34:47] Amen see so he says like you women
[1:34:49] claiming you got the Holy Ghost going
[1:34:50] out here wearing shorts and things how
[1:34:52] can you do that how could the spirit of
[1:34:54] God in you ever let you do such a thing
[1:34:56] as that it just can't be so certainly
[1:34:58] can't be it's not a filthy spirit it's a
[1:35:00] holy spirit but and then when you become
[1:35:03] subject to that Spirit see it throws
[1:35:06] your whole being subject to that spirit
[1:35:08] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:35:11] but this seed word made manifest or
[1:35:13] quickened Made Alive can you say amen
[1:35:17] and the B when the Bible says don't do
[1:35:19] this that body quickly turns to it there
[1:35:22] is no question
[1:35:24] Hallelujah on so who are the called The
[1:35:27] Chosen and
[1:35:28] faithful well brother BR says they are
[1:35:31] those the ones that resisted the devil's
[1:35:33] lie in the beginning amen the Lord
[1:35:37] hello that's
[1:35:39] us resisted the devil's lie in the
[1:35:42] beginning I know we we got our ups some
[1:35:45] downs but I'm I'm just telling you what
[1:35:47] your beginning
[1:35:48] was you resisted the devil's lie in the
[1:35:52] beginning amen ain't that right now God
[1:35:55] has promised that he's going to have a
[1:35:57] bride without spot wrinkle or
[1:35:59] blemish and somebody is going to be
[1:36:03] that can you say Amen somebody is going
[1:36:06] to be faithful to that that's right
[1:36:09] amen yes sir she going to be there this
[1:36:12] isn't a guessing game with God do you
[1:36:15] believe it now notice as God in his word
[1:36:18] made manifest in a man a perfect man so
[1:36:21] is God and His word coming again God and
[1:36:25] man became one his word he is that word
[1:36:30] become in man human flesh and became
[1:36:33] flesh amen now that word God and His
[1:36:37] word coming again making himself
[1:36:40] manifest in a
[1:36:42] bride and they ain't going to do like he
[1:36:45] did hbrd to something else un but the
[1:36:48] unadulterated word of God will be born
[1:36:51] into that church and she'll stand like
[1:36:54] Jesus Christ did with his Spirit
[1:36:57] anointing in his
[1:36:59] word we have may we may have been born
[1:37:02] Sinners we may have had a vile nature we
[1:37:05] may have been under the condemnation of
[1:37:07] sin and death but it wasn't by our own
[1:37:09] choice amen according to Romans 8 and 20
[1:37:14] amen Paul would tell us that we were
[1:37:16] made subject to vanity not willingly
[1:37:19] ain't that right God made us subject to
[1:37:22] vanity for his own purpose amen the
[1:37:25] wisdom of God we were a thought amen
[1:37:29] which makes us an eternal attribute time
[1:37:32] does not change that amen can you say
[1:37:35] Amen nothing can change that you are an
[1:37:38] eternal
[1:37:40] attribute as an eternal thought ain't
[1:37:43] that right amen but we went the prophet
[1:37:45] said we went from attribute to the flesh
[1:37:48] to be tempted we bypassed our theophany
[1:37:51] and became flesh men to be tempted by
[1:37:54] sin we had to be tried and tested we we
[1:37:57] had to go through what the things that
[1:37:59] we did we had to know defeat and sorrow
[1:38:02] and failure but that's not our
[1:38:05] end can you say amen that's the that's
[1:38:09] only the temporary part of us so God is
[1:38:12] not calling Us Faithful when he looking
[1:38:14] at our sin and say that's faithful no
[1:38:16] we're not faithful to our sin I don't
[1:38:19] care if you got habits you're not
[1:38:21] faithful to
[1:38:23] that
[1:38:26] hello that's why we preach Deliverance
[1:38:29] that's right do you realize that you can
[1:38:32] never change your position as a Son of
[1:38:35] God never come on
[1:38:37] never amen
[1:38:43] hallelujah but what does
[1:38:46] change is your sinful life yes sir the
[1:38:50] powers of
[1:38:51] God can break them powers of Darkness to
[1:38:55] change that whole situation can you say
[1:38:57] Amen see so so the Bible doesn't call us
[1:39:01] defeated the Bible doesn't call us
[1:39:04] vagabonds the the Bible doesn't call us
[1:39:06] worthless and low life notice 1 John 3:1
[1:39:10] behold what manner of love the father ha
[1:39:12] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:39:14] called right now sons of
[1:39:18] God ain't that right and no he says the
[1:39:21] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:39:24] not it only sees The Human Side of us
[1:39:27] right it sees us in our weakness it sees
[1:39:30] us in our frailties it sees us in our
[1:39:33] Humanity can you say amen that's right
[1:39:35] see but they don't know that the same
[1:39:38] God that subjected us Amen to vanity is
[1:39:42] the same God that subjected us to a hope
[1:39:47] that's
[1:39:48] right come on now amen ain't that right
[1:39:52] so brother brand said being
[1:39:53] predestinated gives an eternal quality
[1:39:55] to the elect and you cannot get away
[1:39:58] from that so notice in this body of of
[1:40:02] corruption in in this in this world Amen
[1:40:07] all of these things brother Braham said
[1:40:08] it's here that we are formed to the word
[1:40:11] image to be partaker of the word feed on
[1:40:14] the word by being predestinated since
[1:40:17] the beginning you see that little spark
[1:40:19] of life that you had in you from the
[1:40:21] beginning when you started your journey
[1:40:23] he said many of you can remember that
[1:40:24] you join this church and joined that
[1:40:26] church you try this and that nothing
[1:40:28] satisfied that's right but one day you
[1:40:32] just recognized it ain't that right
[1:40:35] there came a
[1:40:39] recognition hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:40:42] for that oh I love him amen it's just
[1:40:45] like the eagle story you know brother
[1:40:47] Bram talks about living with the chicken
[1:40:49] that little eaglet amen living with the
[1:40:51] chickens trying to cluck like the
[1:40:53] chickens but he was just ugly he was
[1:40:55] just odd brother Brown said see it's
[1:40:58] just because he couldn't understand how
[1:41:00] that little that hen would cluck and
[1:41:02] scratch on you know that manure pile and
[1:41:05] eat he just couldn't get that idea and
[1:41:08] she would say oh come over here and
[1:41:09] feast honey amen see but he was an eagle
[1:41:12] he just didn't eat like that it wasn't
[1:41:14] his food ain't that right tried to be
[1:41:17] one of them but he couldn't be amen
[1:41:18] because he was an eagle to began with
[1:41:21] his condition didn't change who he
[1:41:23] was ain't that right amen and your old
[1:41:27] corruptible body didn't change who you
[1:41:29] were this old world didn't change who
[1:41:32] you are amen all the sin the filth and
[1:41:35] all that couldn't change what you are
[1:41:37] talking about the faithfulness now God
[1:41:39] being
[1:41:40] faithful that's good yes sir amen you
[1:41:44] love
[1:41:45] him so the time that he began to
[1:41:47] recognize something is when Mama eagle
[1:41:49] flew over and begin to scream that's
[1:41:52] when he recognized who he was ain't that
[1:41:55] right and brother BR said that's the way
[1:41:57] it is with the gospel or the word or the
[1:41:59] power of Christ when a man has been
[1:42:01] predestinated to eternal life he hears
[1:42:03] that that true ring Scream Of God
[1:42:08] nothing can keep him from it the church
[1:42:11] might say well the days of Miracles just
[1:42:13] passed clck clck clck cluck clock you
[1:42:15] don't stand here and eat this and stand
[1:42:17] here and eat that that barnyard stuff
[1:42:19] won't do for him anymore
[1:42:21] he is gone all things are possible see
[1:42:25] he gets off the ground can you say Amen
[1:42:28] see that's why the matter with so many
[1:42:31] Christians today they can't get their
[1:42:32] feet off the ground oh man he says jump
[1:42:35] son you're an eagle come up here where I
[1:42:37] am and he said Mom but I've never jumped
[1:42:40] in my life well she says jump you jump
[1:42:44] you're an eagle to begin
[1:42:46] with oh do you hear that tonight you're
[1:42:49] an eagle to begin with
[1:42:52] with amen yes sir Glory you're not a
[1:42:56] chicken so he made his first jump
[1:42:58] flopped his wings didn't do too good but
[1:43:00] he got off the ground that's the way we
[1:43:02] do we accept God by Faith by the written
[1:43:04] word there is something in there that's
[1:43:06] it's that eternal life you were
[1:43:07] predestinated to it his Grandpa and
[1:43:10] Grandma were Eagles he was an eagle all
[1:43:12] the way back Eagles don't mix with other
[1:43:14] things he's not a hybrid no he's an
[1:43:16] eagle then after you recognize the very
[1:43:18] word of God was Eagle food then you left
[1:43:20] that other thing why faithful faithful
[1:43:24] not faithful to your past not faithful
[1:43:26] to your sin not faithful Amen to what
[1:43:28] Satan says about you you become faithful
[1:43:31] Amen to
[1:43:33] God what God Said you then you have then
[1:43:37] been formed into the image of the Living
[1:43:40] God you heard from your theophany see if
[1:43:42] this Earthly body is dissolved we have
[1:43:44] one waiting ain't that right as we get
[1:43:47] ready to wind down Romans 12:2 amen Paul
[1:43:51] said be not conformed to this world but
[1:43:52] be ye what
[1:43:54] transformed amen be ye transformed by
[1:43:58] the renewing of your mind that word to
[1:44:00] transform means something that's been
[1:44:02] changed something that's changed from
[1:44:04] one thing to another Amen to think you
[1:44:07] didn't just you didn't start out Amen to
[1:44:10] be everything that God wanted you to be
[1:44:13] amen but you were faithful to it
[1:44:15] faithful can you say Amen never going
[1:44:18] back to the world never going back to
[1:44:20] the thing that God brought you out of
[1:44:22] Amen you've been faithful and it's been
[1:44:24] changing you and changing you and
[1:44:27] changing you amen yes sir changed
[1:44:31] transformed 2 Corinthians 3:14 but we
[1:44:35] all with an open face beholding as in a
[1:44:38] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[1:44:40] into the same image from glory to glory
[1:44:43] even as by the spirit of the Lord so
[1:44:45] brother Bram said they are called The
[1:44:47] Chosen before the foundation of the
[1:44:49] world see and they are faithful to the
[1:44:54] word they're faithful to the word
[1:44:56] they're faithful to the promises they're
[1:44:59] not looking at and say man I just don't
[1:45:01] know how I'm going to do it they're
[1:45:03] faithful faithful can you say Amen
[1:45:06] faithful why it's a magnet that's
[1:45:09] pulling them they're faithful they see a
[1:45:12] Rapture that's at hand can you say Amen
[1:45:15] entertainment ain't going to stop them
[1:45:16] they're
[1:45:18] faithful Lord Hall
