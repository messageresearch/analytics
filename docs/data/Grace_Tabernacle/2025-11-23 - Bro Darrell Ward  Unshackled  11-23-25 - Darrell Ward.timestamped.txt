[47:53] baby Clarabel
[47:55] and little
[47:58] joy that God has given us and it's my
[48:01] first grandbaby. So we uh certainly
[48:04] thankful that see the Xavier and Jordan
[48:07] and serving the Lord and starting a
[48:11] family and I think it's important how
[48:13] you start a family and that God would
[48:16] bring such a gift like this and what a
[48:18] responsibility that it is you know to I
[48:22] was thinking about being a a grandpa.
[48:23] You know they say all these things about
[48:26] it. You know I got to think about how
[48:27] God is with us. You know, God don't have
[48:29] any grandchildren,
[48:31] but they're all God's children. And he's
[48:34] so graciously given us the opportunity
[48:36] to raise them and and take care of them
[48:38] and raise them according to the word and
[48:41] until they're old enough that God can uh
[48:43] lead them and and guide them like he
[48:46] does us all. So, this family this
[48:49] morning wants to dedicate this baby to
[48:51] the Lord and make a a promise to raise
[48:55] her and just ask the Lord to be his hand
[48:58] upon her. And Amen. I think that's a
[49:01] wonderful thing to start a family that
[49:02] way. Amen. So, let's just pray together.
[49:06] Maybe clear. Gracious heavenly father,
[49:09] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for this
[49:12] little family. Lord, what a a joy that
[49:15] it is, Lord, to see a new life, Lord,
[49:18] that you would give us. how precious of
[49:20] a of a thing that it is, Lord, knowing
[49:23] the innocence of a little child. And
[49:26] Lord, we just ask you this morning,
[49:29] Lord, that you would keep your hand upon
[49:31] this family. And Lord, may the Holy
[49:33] Ghost overshadow them, Lord, and lead
[49:36] them.
[49:37] Lord, this little Clarabel, Lord, as she
[49:39] is raised and grows up in this world,
[49:42] Lord, knowing that outside is such an
[49:44] evil world and Lord, but you are so
[49:47] gracious, Lord, to give your children a
[49:50] a protection, Lord, and a strength and
[49:53] ability by your word to be able to
[49:55] withstand everything that they come in
[49:57] contact with. And Lord, we just ask you
[50:00] this morning and Lord, that you would
[50:01] bless this little girl. Lord, may she be
[50:04] raised according to your word. And God,
[50:06] may she testify. Lord, may her life be a
[50:08] testimony of the grace of God. And Lord,
[50:11] may she be a witness, Lord, to be able
[50:13] to tell of your word and the goodness
[50:15] that you give us. And Lord, we just ask
[50:17] you to keep your blessings upon her. And
[50:20] Lord, in this family, Lord, we pray for
[50:21] it now. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[50:24] pray. Amen. Amen.
[50:36] Isn't that a wonderful gift? Amen. God
[50:37] bless you if you understand. Amen.

[50:59] Praise the Lord, brother.
[51:04] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[51:06] Amen. We love our children and and our
[51:09] grandchildren. That's an odd thing to
[51:11] say. Sarah told me at the hospital, she
[51:13] said they were talking about who the
[51:15] baby looked like and she said, "I think
[51:16] she looks like her grandpa." And I said,
[51:17] "Your dad or my dad?"
[51:20] She It took me a while to to catch on.
[51:24] Like, oh, I'm Oh, okay. Yeah. I'm I'm
[51:27] one of the grandpa. There's a there's
[51:28] another one sitting right there. And I
[51:30] don't think she was talking about
[51:31] talking about.
[51:35] [Music]
[51:37] Oh man. That's Xavier's mom and dad. And
[51:41] so many of you don't haven't met them.
[51:43] Matt, Ashley, welcome y'all here this
[51:45] morning. And my just an honor. Amen.
[51:48] Just to see God bring people together.
[51:50] Quite a testimony of how uh that Xavier
[51:54] and Jordan was brought together. And I
[51:57] just love how God takes uh takes
[52:00] hopeless cases and things that we' plum
[52:03] give up on, but God don't give up on
[52:06] nobody. Amen. So, I just I just thank
[52:09] God and that he could bring uh two young
[52:12] people up and bring them together. And
[52:14] you know, sometimes God sees things we
[52:16] don't see. You know, he sees far beyond
[52:18] our our understanding. And but I have to
[52:22] say this, I really appreciate Xavier as
[52:25] a in-law and and he's been real good
[52:29] with him and Jordan and he's already a
[52:32] good dad. He's a good protector and and
[52:34] and I thank every young man. We've got a
[52:37] lot of uh young men that are having
[52:40] families and I thank God to see
[52:41] God-fearing men raise families. This
[52:44] world needs more of them and and and
[52:46] they they all have to grow up into that
[52:49] and so we just want to be here for them
[52:51] and but we sure appreciate appreciate
[52:54] them this morning. appreciate what the
[52:55] Lord has for us. So, we just want to
[52:58] allow Brother Daryl to be able to come
[53:00] and have time to speak this morning. And
[53:03] I know the Lord's put a something
[53:05] special on his heart and and always been
[53:08] a a true blessing. Every time Brother
[53:10] Daryl comes, it's never uh never have we
[53:14] ever left here that the Lord didn't
[53:15] speak to the church. And so, we just
[53:17] want to allow him to come and just get
[53:19] out of the way and let the Lord use him
[53:20] this morning. So, maybe we'd sing key of
[53:23] C.
[53:25] Well, I sought the Lord
[53:29] and he answered me.
[53:33] He delivered me
[53:37] from every fear.
[53:40] Those who look on him
[53:44] are rad up.
[53:47] They'll never be ashamed.
[53:51] Never be ashamed.
[53:54] This poor man cried
[53:58] and the Lord heard me.
[54:01] He delivered me
[54:05] from my enemies.
[54:08] For the son of God,
[54:12] he surrounds his saints.
[54:15] He'll deliver them.
[54:19] He'll deliver them.
[54:21] So I say magnify
[54:24] the Lord with me. How many come this
[54:28] morning say I want to exalt the Lord the
[54:31] name of the Lord. Lord together
[54:36] glorify
[54:38] the Lord with me.
[54:43] Come exalt
[54:45] his name forever.
[54:51] Oh, taste and see
[54:54] that the Lord is good. How many knows
[54:58] that to be true this morning? Blessed is
[55:01] he who hides in him.
[55:05] Oh, fear the Lord,
[55:08] all you saints.
[55:11] He'll give you everything.
[55:14] He'll give you everything.
[55:17] So I say magnify
[55:20] the Lord
[55:22] with me.
[55:25] Oh come exalt
[55:27] his name together.
[55:32] Glorify
[55:34] the Lord with me.
[55:39] Come exalt
[55:41] his name
[55:43] forever.
[55:46] Hallelujah.
[55:48] Hallelujah.
[55:50] Bless the name of the Lord.
[55:57] Amen. What a privilege it is today to
[56:00] serve the living God.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; You know, there's all kinds of gods in
[56:04] the world today. That's the Muslims or
[56:07] Islamics. They have thousands of gods,
[56:10] but there is no God like our God. He
[56:13] opens the eyes of the blind. He makes
[56:15] the lame walk.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; He raises the dead.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He makes cancers disappear off
[56:21] people's bodies.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I've seen him do it, friends. Amen. When
[56:28] my daughter was blind and they said
[56:29] she'd never see little,
[56:32] [Music]
[56:34] she wasn't even three years old. Only
[56:36] survivor of a train car accident. Two of
[56:39] my family killed.
[56:42] Severe brain injury. said she'd never
[56:44] swallow. Said she'd never speak again,
[56:47] never see, never walk again. But I saw
[56:50] my God do what they said was impossible.
[56:54] Amen.
[56:58] Amen.
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:01] Our kids are precious.
[57:04] Our grandkids are even more precious.
[57:08] No, I'm just God bless you. If you have
[57:10] your Bibles this morning, turn with us
[57:11] to the book of St. John and we want to
[57:13] read from St. John 8 verse 36 just one
[57:17] verse there we appreciate each one
[57:18] coming out and this day of dedication
[57:20] for the little grand grandbaby and oh
[57:23] it's a special time it's just wonderful
[57:27] we bring you greetings from my family
[57:28] back home my pastor brother Donnie
[57:31] Reagan we count it an honor to come and
[57:32] be with you once again and we trust that
[57:34] what we'd have to say this morning be a
[57:36] blessing to you and I was thinking know
[57:38] Thanksgiving coming up this week and
[57:40] things to be thankful for and you know
[57:42] I'm thankful for my family.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for my life. Thankful for
[57:48] my children, my grandkids, my church, my
[57:51] pastor, my home. I'm thankful for all
[57:53] those things. But there's one thing I'm
[57:56] more thankful for than anything. And
[57:58] that's what we want to look at this
[57:59] morning. Amen. And this week sometimes,
[58:02] you know, Thanksgiving on Thursday and
[58:04] family's getting together and it's
[58:05] always a busy time and a happy time, but
[58:08] take some time just to maybe slip out to
[58:10] the back and look up towards heaven and
[58:13] be thankful
[58:14] &gt;&gt; for what he's done for us.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; St. John 8:36,
[58:19] the Bible says this,
[58:22] "If the Son therefore shall make you
[58:25] free,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; you shall be free indeed.
[58:31] Amen. That's what I'm most thankful for
[58:33] this morning and I want to speak for it
[58:35] just a few minutes is on Unshackled.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[58:41] Heavenly Father,
[58:43] Lord, we count it such an honor to
[58:45] gather here with your children today.
[58:48] And Lord, we are in our hearts most
[58:49] thankful. Lord, I guess I thanked you
[58:52] 10,000 times or more every time I see
[58:56] Jessica
[58:58] come down the steps or
[59:01] open a refrigerator and graduate from
[59:04] school.
[59:06] We're so thankful, Lord. Father, I pray
[59:09] today that whatever the need would be
[59:11] among these people, Lord, and I know
[59:13] when there's a congregation this size,
[59:14] there's needs. But Lord, may we realize
[59:17] today there's not a need in this
[59:18] building that's greater than you. So,
[59:21] Lord, we look to you this morning. May
[59:23] you come, Lord, and speak to your
[59:24] children. for in our hearts we are most
[59:27] grateful for all that you've done for
[59:29] us. Bless brother Matt, Lord, his
[59:31] family, his church, his ministry. Bless
[59:33] each one here today, Lord. And when we
[59:35] leave the building, may each of us be
[59:37] thankful in our hearts because you have
[59:40] unshackled us. Grant it, Lord, for we
[59:42] ask these things in Jesus name. And the
[59:45] saints said,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[59:54] Brother Bam said he said, "I remember
[59:56] one time I was at the Cincinnati Zoo in
[59:58] Ohio and I was looking at an eagle who
[1:00:01] had just been captured and it was one of
[1:00:04] the most pitiful sights that I ever had
[1:00:06] the privilege of seeing that this great
[1:00:09] heavenly bird that had been captured and
[1:00:11] netted by someone and thrown into a
[1:00:13] cage." And the poor fellow was so out of
[1:00:16] place that he would jump with all that
[1:00:18] was within him against these big bars
[1:00:20] and flopping his wings only to find
[1:00:22] himself to fall back on his back. And
[1:00:25] that poor eagle has beat himself against
[1:00:26] those bars until all the feathers on his
[1:00:29] wings were gone and his head was and his
[1:00:31] face was bruised and blooded. And as I
[1:00:34] watched him again proudly walk back and
[1:00:36] with all that he had, he had pour
[1:00:38] himself against those bars only to find
[1:00:41] himself backwards again. And as he laid
[1:00:44] there on the floor, his weary eyes
[1:00:45] soared the skies. And I thought, what a
[1:00:48] pitiful sight that is,
[1:00:52] not to be on the earth here. He's a
[1:00:53] heavenly bird. His whole makeup was to
[1:00:56] live in the blue, way above the haunts
[1:00:58] and the cares of the world. But to see a
[1:01:01] bird like that that was born on the
[1:01:03] earth, to soar into the skies, yet caged
[1:01:06] in such a way that he could never soar
[1:01:10] the skies again.
[1:01:12] And I thought that's the most satis I'
[1:01:15] I'D GIVE THAT MAN $100 more that he paid
[1:01:18] for the eagle if you'd let me open that
[1:01:20] door and let him out.
[1:01:23] Said to think that he was born to sell
[1:01:25] the blue skies. Then he looks up there
[1:01:28] and he couldn't do it.
[1:01:30] Somebody had put him in a cage
[1:01:33] laying there looking up WHERE HE REALLY
[1:01:35] OUGHT TO BE,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; WHERE HIS HEART LONGED to be.
[1:01:39] But these bars between him and that
[1:01:42] shackled by a man, placed in bondage.
[1:01:48] WHAT A PITIFUL SIGHT THAT IS. YOU JUST
[1:01:50] think about it. JUST SADDENS MY HEART to
[1:01:52] see that.
[1:01:54] BUT I TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE PITIFUL
[1:01:55] THAN that is to see men and women
[1:02:00] who were born and shaped in the image of
[1:02:02] God.
[1:02:04] BORN TO BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD AND
[1:02:06] TO FIND THEM CAGED BY SIN, BY HABITS, BY
[1:02:10] THE CARES OF THIS WORLD, SHACKLED BY THE
[1:02:13] DEVIL. IT'S A FAR MORE PITIFUL SHAPE
[1:02:16] THAN THAT eagle is.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, MAN WAS NOT MADE TO BE BOUND.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; MAN IS A FREE MAN. HE WHO THE SON HATH
[1:02:23] MADE FREE IS FREE INDEED.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; He doesn't HAVE TO BE BOUND THAT WAY.
[1:02:29] SHACKLED TO ADDICTION, SHACKLED TO
[1:02:31] FEARS, SHACKLED TO SICKNESS, DIFFERENT
[1:02:34] THINGS THAT CAGES MEN AND DENY THEM OF
[1:02:36] THEIR PRIVILEGES. MAN WAS MADE IN THE
[1:02:38] IMAGE OF GOD. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A
[1:02:40] BOND SLAVE TO SATAN.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN, SOMEBODY. HE WASN'T MADE TO BE A
[1:02:45] SLAVE. HE WAS MADE TO BE A SON.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MADE OF GOD TO BE IN GOD'S IMAGE.
[1:02:52] BUT BECAUSE OF THE FALL OF MAN, he was
[1:02:55] born shackled to death.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; David said, "Behold, I was shaped in
[1:03:01] iniquity, and in sin did my mother
[1:03:03] conceive me." You see, FROM THE MOMENT
[1:03:05] THAT YOU ARE CONCEIVED, you are on your
[1:03:09] path to death.
[1:03:11] And yet many people today, they say, "I
[1:03:13] don't need nobody. I I'M DOING ALL RIGHT
[1:03:15] MYSELF. I'M STRONG. I'M SMART. I'VE GOT
[1:03:17] MONEY. I I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. I CAN MAKE
[1:03:20] MY OWN WAY.
[1:03:21] BUT THEY'RE shackled to death.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN DEFEATED. AND THIS NATURAL
[1:03:27] BIRTH CAN NEVER BRING US TO LIFE.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; THE NATURAL BIRTH WILL ONLY BRING US TO
[1:03:33] death
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; because you're born defeated. You're in
[1:03:37] a defeated world amongst defeated
[1:03:38] people, defeated creeds, defeated
[1:03:41] denominations.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO VICTORY SOME
[1:03:45] WAY.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; AND THERE CANNOT BE A VICTOR.
[1:03:50] THERE CAN'T BE A VICTORY UNLESS THERE IS
[1:03:52] A VICTOR.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen that?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; AND JUST LIKE THAT EAGLE
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS HELPLESSLY CAGED. WE WERE
[1:04:01] HELPLESS. JUST AS HELPLESS AS WE COULD
[1:04:04] BE.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; I COULD NOT SAVE MYSELF.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; MANKIND WAS CHAINED, SHACKLED BY A
[1:04:13] fallen nature.
[1:04:15] UNLESS SOMEBODY COULD PUT FORTH THEIR
[1:04:19] HAND AND OPEN UP THAT CAGE,
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; we are forever shackled.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; But I AM SO THANKFUL AS WE TAKE THIS
[1:04:29] WEEK OF THANKSGIVING. I AM SO THANKFUL
[1:04:32] THAT THERE IS ONE HALLELUJAH WHO HAS
[1:04:34] DONE THAT VERY THING. THE ONLY ONE WHO
[1:04:37] COULD DO IT.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME IS JESUS CHRIST.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT CAN YOU SAY AMEN TO
[1:04:44] THAT? HE HAS UNSHACKLED US IN THAT HE
[1:04:46] CALLED YOU. WHEN HE CALLED YOU, HE
[1:04:48] UNSHACKLED YOU.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; He opened up the cage to let us out.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus unshackled
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; the shackled.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of Barabus standing on
[1:05:04] death row in a Roman prison house.
[1:05:08] HOW DO YOU THINK O BARABUS FELT KNOWING
[1:05:11] THAT the next morning when HE HEARD
[1:05:14] THOSE ROMAN soldiers coming, THEY'RE
[1:05:16] GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THAT CAGE,
[1:05:18] THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THOSE
[1:05:20] PRISON BARS AND CRUCIFY HIM. THE MOST
[1:05:22] HORRIBLE FORM OF DEATH THERE WAS WAS
[1:05:25] CRUCIFIXION by the Romans. THEY MADE IT
[1:05:28] SO CRUEL. THEY MADE IT SO SUFFERING THAT
[1:05:31] NOBODY WANTED TO FACE EXECUTION.
[1:05:34] Crucifixion by the Romans. And how do
[1:05:37] YOU THINK HE FELT SWEATING IT OUT
[1:05:39] KNOWING THE NEXT MORNING? And in that
[1:05:42] morning, he hears the stomping of Roman
[1:05:45] soldiers coming through THE GALLERY.
[1:05:47] THOSE BIG ORANGE SHOES AS THEY MARCH
[1:05:49] TOWARDS HIS CELL. OH, I could just hear
[1:05:52] it in my mind.
[1:05:54] Detail.
[1:05:59] Oh god. This is it.
[1:06:02] You know you're going to be killed in
[1:06:04] just a few minutes. They're going to
[1:06:05] take you out. They're going to crucify
[1:06:06] you. And he opened the door. I could
[1:06:10] just see him on the floor just shaking.
[1:06:13] Oh, you see all these sins that caught
[1:06:15] up with him. Barabbus the killer.
[1:06:17] Barabus the deceiver. Barabbus the
[1:06:19] stealer.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; BARABBUS WHO HAD DONE ALL THIS
[1:06:22] WICKEDNESS. BARABBUS WHO WAS SO MEAN,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS SO TOUGH,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; shaking on the floor crying like a
[1:06:31] little boy
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; cuz he's fixing to go to crucifixion.
[1:06:35] And I can hear them say, "Barabas,
[1:06:39] GUILTY OF MURDER, ROBBERY, THIEVERY,
[1:06:42] DECEIT,
[1:06:44] a dis.
[1:06:47] YOU HAVE BEEN SENTENCED FOR YOUR
[1:06:50] CRIMES." GOD, this is it. This is it. BY
[1:06:54] ORDER OF PONTIUS PILATE.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; BARABBUS, YOU are pardoned.
[1:07:04] You're free. Unshackle
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; the prisoner.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I guarantee he didn't sit like you're
[1:07:11] all sitting this morning.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine GOING FROM FACING DEATH
[1:07:17] UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL THAT'S LIFTED
[1:07:19] OFF OF YOU?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALMOST THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN THIS
[1:07:24] CAN'T BE TRUE. IT'S A TRICK. YOU WANT ME
[1:07:26] TO RUN OUT THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN SAY
[1:07:28] I THREW A SPEAR IN HIS BACK BECAUSE HE
[1:07:30] TRIED TO ESCAPE AND EVERYBODY WILL KNOW
[1:07:32] YOU'RE THE ONE THAT KILLED BARABBUS.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; NO TRICK, BARABUS. NO TRICKERY.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Unshackle the prisoner.
[1:07:45] You mean I I'm not going to die. You
[1:07:47] don't have to die.
[1:07:49] What do What DO I HAVE TO DO FOR IT?
[1:07:52] WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO FOR THIS FREEDOM?
[1:07:55] NOTHING.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; NOTHING.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; It's without money sir
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; or price.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Well, how does this come? And the
[1:08:07] centurion would have turned him around
[1:08:08] and said, "Look out the window. You see
[1:08:10] that man hanging on the cross there? YOU
[1:08:12] SEE THAT SPIT IN HIS FACE? YOU SEE THAT
[1:08:14] BLOOD DRIPPING OUT OF HIS BODY? YOU SEE
[1:08:16] THOSE STRIPES ON HIS BACK?
[1:08:20] You see his heads crucified?
[1:08:24] THAT WAS YOUR CROSS. THAT WAS YOUR
[1:08:26] NAILS. THAT WAS YOUR PUNISHMENT. BUT HIS
[1:08:29] NAME IS JESUS.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK YOUR PLACE.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; He opened up the PRISON DOOR FOR YOU WHO
[1:08:39] WERE CONDEMNED TO DIE, BUT HE TOOK YOUR
[1:08:43] PLACE.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Barabus's name was
[1:08:49] Jesus Barabbus? Did you know that? Look
[1:08:52] it up and see. Jesus took Jesus place.
[1:09:01] Oh God, he took your place.
[1:09:05] You're pardoned. Your prison house has
[1:09:08] been opened.
[1:09:11] You're unshackled.
[1:09:15] And when Jesus pushed upon the cross,
[1:09:18] you see, they would stretch their arms
[1:09:20] out like this. And when they do, their
[1:09:22] shoulders would come out of joint. And
[1:09:24] they had a little platform for their
[1:09:25] feet that they would put like this so
[1:09:27] that they could push up because when
[1:09:28] they stretched them out like that, it
[1:09:30] would stretch the diaphragm and they
[1:09:31] couldn't breathe. So they had this
[1:09:33] platform that they would push up. And
[1:09:35] when they pushed up, it would relax the
[1:09:36] diaphragm enough for them to breathe a
[1:09:38] little bit. And so they would just go
[1:09:40] through this routine of up, breathe,
[1:09:42] breathe, breathe, down, smother,
[1:09:44] smother, smother, up, breathe, breathe,
[1:09:45] breathe over and over. But when Ro
[1:09:47] thought they'd suffered enough, they
[1:09:49] would break their legs. so they couldn't
[1:09:51] push up AND THEN THEY WOULD DIE ON the
[1:09:53] cross. had Jesus there in the cross
[1:09:56] between the TWO THIEVES. HE PUSHED UP
[1:10:01] AND HE CRIED OUT,
[1:10:05] "It's
[1:10:08] mother smother. Smother smother smother
[1:10:12] is
[1:10:17] finished."
[1:10:20] Oh god. Oh god. I wish I was outside
[1:10:23] right now. I'll show you how a white boy
[1:10:25] can dance. Think about it.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN HE PUSHED UP ON THAT
[1:10:31] CROSS AND HE CRIED, "IT'S FINISHED."
[1:10:33] EVERY PRISON DOOR THAT SATAN HAD BUSTED
[1:10:36] OPEN AND EVERY SHACKLED PRISONER COULD
[1:10:39] GO FREE. AMEN.
[1:10:43] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:44] HE UNSHACKLED ME. HE UNSHACKLED YOU THIS
[1:10:47] MORNING. FOR THIS I AM MOST THANKFUL.
[1:10:52] I come out of the army as a 21-year-old
[1:10:54] and I was in an airborne combat unit and
[1:10:57] I came out of the army. I had all kinds
[1:10:58] of things in my life. ALL KINDS OF I'D
[1:11:00] be ashamed for you to know some OF THE
[1:11:02] THINGS I CARRIED IN MY LIFE. BUT I MET
[1:11:04] HIM IN AN OLD BUILDING DOWN IN
[1:11:06] JONESBURG, TENNESSEE. AND THAT
[1:11:08] AFTERNOON, HALLELUJAH, HE UNSHACKLED ME.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:21] HALLELUJAH. Do you love him?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; I think of Isaac.
[1:11:26] God told Abraham, "I'm going to give you
[1:11:28] a son." AND WHEN ABRAHAM WAS HUNDRED
[1:11:30] YEARS OLD AND SARAH WAS 75,
[1:11:33] he had the son, he had the son that God
[1:11:36] promised him they would have.
[1:11:38] And when the boy got a little older, God
[1:11:40] spoke to Abraham AND SAID, "TAKE THY SON
[1:11:42] ISAAC TO A MOUNTAIN THAT I TELL YOU, AND
[1:11:45] THERE GIVE HIM to me for a sacrifice.
[1:11:52] Think about that. TAKE YOUR ONLY SON TO
[1:11:55] A MOUNTAIN. SACRIFICE HIM TO me as a
[1:11:58] sacrifice.
[1:12:00] And at the foot of the mountain,
[1:12:03] he told those people that WAS WITH HIM,
[1:12:04] "I THE LAD WILL GO YONDER AND I AND THE
[1:12:06] LAD WILL COME AGAIN."
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD A MAN SAY THAT WHEN GOD SAID,
[1:12:10] "GIVE ME YOUR SON." BECAUSE HE KNEW IF
[1:12:13] GOD GAVE HIM THAT BOY WHEN HIS BODY WAS
[1:12:15] DEAD, IF THAT BOY'S BODY WAS DEAD, HE
[1:12:17] WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM BACK TO HIM AGAIN.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And he took him up THERE AND HE LAID HIM
[1:12:23] ON THE ALTAR AND HE TIED HIM UP. HE
[1:12:25] SHACKLED HIM WITH SOME HANDS AND HE
[1:12:26] SHACKLED HIS FEET AND NO DOUBT HE KISSED
[1:12:28] HIM ON THE FOREHEAD and said, "Son,
[1:12:30] daddy would have loved to watch you grow
[1:12:31] up. I would have loved to watch you see
[1:12:33] me become a grandpa and all these
[1:12:35] things. I would have LOVED IT, BUT I
[1:12:36] MUST OBEY MY GOD."
[1:12:40] AND HE BROUGHT THAT KNIFE BACK AND HE
[1:12:41] SAID, "GOD, you gave me this boy and now
[1:12:44] I give this boy to you." And about that
[1:12:46] time when he brought forth, he heard a
[1:12:48] voice. He heard A VOICE SAID,"ABRAHAM,
[1:12:51] STAY YOUR HAND."
[1:12:54] OH. And he heard behind him a ram
[1:12:56] bleeding bad. He looked around AND HE
[1:12:58] SAW GOD HAD PROVIDED HIMSELF A
[1:13:01] SACRIFICE. And he said, "Isaac," he be
[1:13:03] he be to unshackle him. HE SAID, "ISAAC,
[1:13:05] SON, GET UP, SON. GET UP. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:13:07] TO DIE TODAY. WE'RE GOING BACK HOME.
[1:13:10] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THANKSGIVING. IT'S
[1:13:11] GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; You see, when he when Abraham GAVE ISAAC
[1:13:18] TO GOD, GOD GAVE ISAAC BACK TO ABRAHAM.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I remember standing at a window when my
[1:13:24] BABY WAS DYING, WASN'T even three years
[1:13:26] old. And I stood there and I said, "God,
[1:13:28] I GIVE YOU JESSICA. IF YOU TAKE HER
[1:13:30] LIFE, I'LL PREACH AS HARD AS I EVER
[1:13:32] PREACHED.
[1:13:34] I'll go out there. I'll bury you with
[1:13:35] the REST OF MY FAMILY. AND I'LL LOVE YOU
[1:13:37] AS MUCH AS I EVER LOVED YOU. I'LL PREACH
[1:13:38] AS HARD AS I EVER PREACHED. I SAID, "IF
[1:13:40] YOU LET MY BABY LIVE, I'LL DO MY BEST TO
[1:13:43] TELL THE world
[1:13:45] what you did for her." And the afternoon
[1:13:48] of the funeral, sitting in the wait
[1:13:49] room, a warm feeling come over and a
[1:13:51] voice spoke to me just as plain as I'm
[1:13:53] talking to you and said, "Your daughter
[1:13:55] shall live."
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Few years later after the accident, when
[1:13:59] God gave her back to me, I ran into a
[1:14:01] brother Louie Blevens who had a little
[1:14:03] Debbie cake route and he said, "Come out
[1:14:04] to the truck. I got some cakes. shall
[1:14:06] give the kids. And he's listening to a
[1:14:07] tape and brother Bam said,
[1:14:10] Moses and Amra
[1:14:12] when when when Yosephed and Amra gave
[1:14:14] Moses to God, God gave Moses back to
[1:14:17] them. And standing there, brother Matt,
[1:14:19] something spoke to my heart just as real
[1:14:20] and SAID, "BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME JESSICA,
[1:14:24] I GIVE JESSICA back to you."
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU GOT A WAYWARD SON THIS MORNING.
[1:14:29] YOU GOT A WAYWARD DAUGHTER THIS MORNING.
[1:14:31] DON'T FRET ABOUT IT. JUST GIVE THEM TO
[1:14:33] GOD AND LET GOD GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU.
[1:14:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:39] Starting up the hill as he said, "Daddy,
[1:14:41] we got the wood, we got the knife, WE
[1:14:43] GOT THE FIRE, BUT WHERE IS THE
[1:14:44] SACRIFICE?" HE SAID, "SON,
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; God will per give provide himself
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; a sacrifice."
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I think of the maniac of Gadera.
[1:14:55] Jesus crossed the stormy sea all the way
[1:14:58] over to help one single person. He
[1:15:02] wasn't the mayor of the city. He wasn't
[1:15:05] the most influential person of the city.
[1:15:07] He was a maniac living among the tombs
[1:15:09] cutting himself with stones. You know,
[1:15:11] we still have them today. They're called
[1:15:12] cutters.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. That's right. The same
[1:15:16] thing that caused him to cut himself is
[1:15:18] what causes them to cut their self.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He lived among the tombs and he
[1:15:26] cut himself. Perhaps one time he was an
[1:15:28] upward citizen, but he got into alcohol
[1:15:30] or he got into drugs or he got into pain
[1:15:32] pills OR HE GOT INTO SOMETHING AND
[1:15:34] CRASHED OUT HIS LIFE. AND THERE YOU FIND
[1:15:36] HIM LIVING AMONG THE TOMBS AND NOBODY
[1:15:38] COULD TAME HIM.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; But all the way over
[1:15:43] on the other side was Jesus. And that
[1:15:45] maniac AMONG THE TOMBS DID NOT WANT TO
[1:15:47] BE THAT WAY. HE DID NOT WANT TO BE THAT
[1:15:50] WAY. AND IF THERE'S A DEEP THAT CALLS
[1:15:52] INTO THE DEEP, IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN
[1:15:53] YOU TELLING YOU, I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS
[1:15:55] WAY, THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER FOR ME,
[1:15:57] THAT'S THE EVIDENCE THERE'S SOMETHING
[1:15:59] THERE FOR YOU.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus do? He crossed the stormy
[1:16:06] sea. Not for a church full,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; for one
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; man.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; For the sake of one man crying out for
[1:16:17] deliverance. Jesus crossed the stormy
[1:16:20] sea and unshackled him.
[1:16:24] What a thanksgiving that was.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; When he went home and told his wife,
[1:16:29] "Don't worry, I'm not the same man I
[1:16:32] used to be."
[1:16:33] Knows how to change them. Don't know
[1:16:34] anybody.
[1:16:37] Amen.
[1:16:38] Hallelujah. And that same Jesus will
[1:16:42] come this morning to one humble soul
[1:16:45] that's calling to him. He'll cross the
[1:16:47] sea. He'll leave the heavens to answer
[1:16:49] the prayer of one humble heart
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; wanting
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; deliverance.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; I think of the woman of his infirmities.
[1:16:58] The Bible says in Luke 13:10, "And he
[1:17:00] was teaching in one of the synagogues of
[1:17:02] the Sabbath. And behold, there was a
[1:17:03] woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18
[1:17:06] years and was bowed together and in
[1:17:08] could no wise lift herself just bent
[1:17:11] over like this. 18 years she walked like
[1:17:14] this.
[1:17:16] Could Could you Could you hand me that
[1:17:18] up there on that shelf? I can't
[1:17:20] straighten up.
[1:17:23] 18 years.
[1:17:26] She got up that morning. 18 years in a
[1:17:29] day. Been over. But little did she know
[1:17:33] this was the day she would be
[1:17:35] unshackled.
[1:17:38] Oh, remember brother David S was in
[1:17:40] Nicaragua. We had a prime over there.
[1:17:42] There's a man came through that prayer
[1:17:43] line. He was bent over just like that
[1:17:44] right there. He was a brick layer. blew
[1:17:46] his back up, blew his back out laying
[1:17:47] brick and he's bent over like that. And
[1:17:49] when he came through that prayer line,
[1:17:50] God is my witness. I saw that man when
[1:17:52] he got to the end of the prayer line, he
[1:17:54] was standing straight up and he shouted
[1:17:57] that church to the ground
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; cuz they just something about it. When
[1:18:01] you've been been over that long and all
[1:18:02] of a sudden you're unshackled, it makes
[1:18:04] you want to dance. It makes you want to
[1:18:06] shout. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO TELL
[1:18:08] SOMEBODY,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; "AMEN." She could otherwise lift
[1:18:13] herself. And when JESUS SAW HER, HE
[1:18:16] CALLED her to him AND SAID UNTO
[1:18:17] HER,"WOMAN,
[1:18:19] THOU ART loosed from thy infirmities."
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And he laid his hands on her, and
[1:18:24] immediately she was made straight.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And I like this next part. Immediately
[1:18:37] she was made straight and glorified
[1:18:41] God.
[1:18:45] Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Acts two. Now about the time Herod the
[1:18:49] king stretched forth his hand to vex
[1:18:50] certain of the church and he killed
[1:18:52] James the brother of John with a sword.
[1:18:54] And because he saw it pleased the Jews,
[1:18:56] he proceeded further to take Peter also.
[1:18:59] Then were the days of the unleaven
[1:19:01] bread. And when he had apprehended him,
[1:19:02] he put him in a prison and delivered him
[1:19:04] to four quaternons of soldiers to keep
[1:19:07] him intending after Easter to bring him
[1:19:10] forth to the people. And Peter therefore
[1:19:13] was kept in prison, but prayer was made
[1:19:15] without ceasing of the church unto God
[1:19:18] for Peter. And when Herod would have
[1:19:20] brought him forth, that same night Peter
[1:19:23] was sleeping between two soldiers, bound
[1:19:26] with two chains, and the keepers before
[1:19:28] the door kept the prison. In other
[1:19:30] words, this man was shackled up and
[1:19:32] locked in.
[1:19:34] And behold, the angel of the Lord came
[1:19:36] unto him, AND A LIGHT SHINE IN THE
[1:19:38] PRISON, AND HE SMOKED PETER ON THE SIDE,
[1:19:40] and raised HIM UP, SAYING, "ARISE UP
[1:19:42] QUICKLY." AND WHEN HE DID, his chains
[1:19:45] fell off from his hands.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you so glad an angel
[1:19:51] messenger has come TO US AND UNSHACKLED
[1:19:53] US.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; HE'S LOOSED US FROM CREEDS. HE'S LOOSED
[1:19:56] US FROM DARKNESS. HE'S LOOSED US FROM
[1:19:58] DENOMINATIONS. HALLELUJAH. AND BROUGHT
[1:20:00] US INTO HIS PRESENCE. AMEN.
[1:20:04] AND THE angel said unto him, "Guard
[1:20:05] thyself and bind on thy sandals." And so
[1:20:08] he did. And he said unto him, "Cast thy
[1:20:09] garment about thee, and follow me." And
[1:20:12] he went out and followed him, and which
[1:20:13] not that it was true, which was done by
[1:20:15] the angel, but thought he was saw a
[1:20:16] vision.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And I must be dreaming. This can't be
[1:20:21] happening.
[1:20:23] And when they were passed the first and
[1:20:24] second ward, they came into the iron
[1:20:26] gate that leadth unto the city, which
[1:20:28] open to them of his own accord.
[1:20:31] and come up to the gate
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; and the gate opened.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; THE CHASE FELL OFF. THE PRISON DOOR
[1:20:39] OPENED UP. THE GUARDS KEPT SLEEPING.
[1:20:41] WALKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH OUT TO THE
[1:20:43] OUTSIDE. GOT TO THE GATE. THE GATE
[1:20:45] OPENED UP.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Oh god. I just love the word.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; It opened up on its own accord. And they
[1:20:55] went out and passed on through one
[1:20:57] street. And forth the angel departed
[1:20:59] from him. AND WHEN PETER WAS COME TO
[1:21:00] HIMSELF,
[1:21:02] I'd say he got a little excited.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I know for SURE THAT THE
[1:21:06] LORD HAS SENT HIS ANGEL AND HAVE
[1:21:08] DELIVERED ME OUT OF THE HAND OF HEROD
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; FROM ALL the expectation of the people
[1:21:12] of the Jews."
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Oh man, they were thinking, "Boy,
[1:21:15] tomorrow we're going to work Peter over.
[1:21:17] We're going to wish he'd never been
[1:21:18] born."
[1:21:20] But little did they know before the sun
[1:21:22] rising of the sun,
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; the Lord unshackled him.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he had considered the
[1:21:29] thing, he came to the house of Mary, the
[1:21:31] mother of John, whose surname was Mark,
[1:21:33] where many were gathered together
[1:21:35] praying. Now, they was in the HOUSE
[1:21:37] HAVING A PRAYER MEETING for Peter, who
[1:21:38] was in prison. And Peter knocks on the
[1:21:41] door.
[1:21:44] And a maiden by the name of Roa comes TO
[1:21:46] THE DOOR. SHE KNEW PETER'S VOICE
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; AND SHE GOT SO EXCITED THAT SHE OPENED
[1:21:54] NOT THE GATE FOR GLADNESS BUT RAN IN AND
[1:21:57] TOLD THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PRAYING,
[1:21:59] "PETER'S AT THE DOOR."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And they had a big hallelujah time and
[1:22:04] praise God.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. And they said unto her, sir,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; you're mad.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that the way we are?
[1:22:17] SHE CONSTANTLY AFFIRMED THAT IT WAS EVEN
[1:22:19] SO. AND they said, "It is his angel.
[1:22:23] THEY'VE DONE KILLED THE MAN. THAT'S HIS
[1:22:24] ANGEL KNOCKING ON THE DOOR." Peter is
[1:22:27] just out there. I wish somebody let me
[1:22:30] in. It's cold out here.
[1:22:34] He continued knocking. AND WHEN THEY
[1:22:35] OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM, THEY WERE
[1:22:38] ASTONISHED.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Why do we get so surprised when God
[1:22:43] answers our prayer?
[1:22:45] He said IN JEREMIAH 33:3, "CALL UNTO ME
[1:22:48] AND I WILL answer thee."
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Now, why do we get so surprised, brother
[1:22:53] Mark, when he answers our prayer?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ASTONISHED. BUT HE BECKONED
[1:23:01] UNTO them with a hand to hold their
[1:23:02] peace and declared to THEM HOW THE LORD
[1:23:04] HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT OF PRISON. AND HE
[1:23:06] SAID, "GO SHOW THESE THINGS unto James
[1:23:08] and to the brethren." And he departed
[1:23:09] and went to another place. Now, as soon
[1:23:11] as it was day, there was no small stir
[1:23:14] among the soldiers as what happened to
[1:23:17] Peter.
[1:23:19] I can just imagine. No, you tell Herod.
[1:23:21] No, no, no, no don't no don't no don't
[1:23:22] no don't no don't no don't no don't no
[1:23:22] don't no don't no don't you go tell No,
[1:23:23] you go tell him.
[1:23:27] Amen. But you see in a prison house
[1:23:31] surrounded by those who wanted to
[1:23:33] persecute him, God unshackled him.
[1:23:39] here a few years ago. I was preaching
[1:23:41] among the Apache Indians at St. Carlos.
[1:23:43] I'll hurry just a little bit more. Just
[1:23:44] give me a little bit more time.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I was preaching among the Apache Indians
[1:23:50] and this Indian came up. He's about 69
[1:23:52] year old. Had a bandana around his head,
[1:23:54] hair, just a typical looking Apache
[1:23:56] Indian.
[1:23:58] This left arm was artificial and this
[1:24:01] right leg was artificial. and he walked
[1:24:04] up to me. When he got close to me, I
[1:24:06] could smell the alcohol on his breath.
[1:24:10] And I said, "Buddy, do you need
[1:24:12] something from the Lord?"
[1:24:15] He said, "I don't want to hate no more."
[1:24:19] Said, "I'm tired of being bitter."
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; And I looked at him and thought, "Poor
[1:24:24] old fella. They took his land away from
[1:24:26] him, put him on a reservation, probably
[1:24:28] drafted him into the army, probably lost
[1:24:30] that arm and leg in Vietnam.
[1:24:33] He laid his I'll never forget this. He
[1:24:36] laid his head over on my shoulder, a
[1:24:37] 69year-old Apache Indian and cried like
[1:24:41] a baby. Said, "Lead me to that Jesus
[1:24:43] you're preaching about."
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And I prayed for that man. And about a
[1:24:48] month later, I called brother Kevin down
[1:24:50] there and we was talking. I said, "How's
[1:24:51] my buddy doing?" He said, "Well, brother
[1:24:54] Daryl said he did real good." Said, "He
[1:24:55] come to church about two weeks and he
[1:24:57] quit coming."
[1:24:59] I said, "Quick coming? Why did he quit
[1:25:00] coming?" He said he took sick and died.
[1:25:05] I said died. He said yeah. He said you
[1:25:07] know brother D said I went down there to
[1:25:09] the to his house to pay the respects to
[1:25:10] the family and said you know brother
[1:25:12] Kevin said he died so peaceful after
[1:25:15] that meeting that you had up there. He
[1:25:16] died so peaceful.
[1:25:19] And I said Kevin what what happened to
[1:25:21] his arm and leg? Do you know what
[1:25:22] happened to it? He said he lost it in
[1:25:24] Vietnam.
[1:25:26] But here's a man who had been bitter ALL
[1:25:28] HIS LIFE. SHACKLED BY BITTERNESS.
[1:25:31] SHACKLED by hatred, HATED THE WHITE MAN,
[1:25:34] HATED ANYTHING, HATED THE GOVERNMENT.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; But in the last few weeks of his life,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus unshackled him.
[1:25:49] Let me tell you something, friend. You
[1:25:51] never know when it's going to happen to
[1:25:52] you.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; You need to be ready.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm young. Yeah. So is my
[1:25:58] sister-in-law. She was eight when she
[1:25:59] got killed. You never know.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you ain't ready, make sure
[1:26:04] you're ready.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same God that unshackled
[1:26:10] these that we looked at in the Bible
[1:26:13] that unshackled that Apache, I want you
[1:26:15] to know that he's in this building this
[1:26:17] morning.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; The trouble with so many people that
[1:26:20] they look for God to be a million miles
[1:26:22] away somewhere when God is right here in
[1:26:25] your midst right now. Think of it. The
[1:26:27] one who loves you, the one you serve is
[1:26:29] here. He spoke these words. Wherever two
[1:26:32] or THREE ARE GATHERED IN MY NAME, I WILL
[1:26:35] BE IN THEIR MIDST.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; You said, "Bro, brother D, I I'm the
[1:26:41] least one. I'm the least one of all the
[1:26:42] people.
[1:26:44] I'm just the souls of his feet." BUT
[1:26:47] REMEMBER, HE'S TRIUMPHED WITH YOU. AMEN.
[1:26:50] HE'S TRIUMPHED WITH YOU OVER EVERY BIT
[1:26:51] OF IT.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVEN IF YOU'RE THE SOS OF HIS
[1:26:54] FEET, EVERY SICKNESS, EVERY DEVIL, EVERY
[1:26:56] POWER, EVEN DEATH ITSELF is under your
[1:27:00] feet.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. IF I COULD JUST GET
[1:27:03] THE CHURCH TO SEE THAT, WE WOULD HAVE A
[1:27:05] TRIUMPH CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; That all evil is under him. And we are
[1:27:10] in him. So, you're dealing with a
[1:27:12] defeated enemy. Sickness is defeated.
[1:27:14] Death is defeated. Hell is defeated.
[1:27:17] Everything is defeated. People come up
[1:27:20] for prayer say, "Well, the devil told me
[1:27:21] this and the devil told me that and the
[1:27:23] devil said." AND I THINK, "WHY DO YOU
[1:27:24] LISTEN TO HIM? YOU KNOW HE'S A LIAR."
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HE'S THE FATHER OF LIES.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But you see, the good news is this
[1:27:34] morning is that Christ died in the
[1:27:36] sinner's place. Christ took the sick
[1:27:38] man's place. Christ took the sinner's
[1:27:39] place. He took the worried man's place.
[1:27:41] He took the maniac's place. He took the
[1:27:43] addicted man's place.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Christ took every place. and freed us
[1:27:49] from every affliction, every sin that
[1:27:51] the devil has put us in his PRISON HOUSE
[1:27:53] BY. HE has unshackled us.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; He come to pardon us freely. Everything
[1:28:01] goes free.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; For whom the son made free is free
[1:28:07] indeed.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus died to heal us. Let me just a
[1:28:11] few. I'll hurry. Every one of you in
[1:28:12] this building this morning is healed.
[1:28:14] Every one of you is healed right now.
[1:28:16] Jesus has already healed you.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it, believe it,
[1:28:22] and confess it.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, WE WERE PAST THIS. BY
[1:28:26] HIS STRIPES, WE WERE HEALED.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; When he DIED AT CALVARY, THAT'S WHEN HE
[1:28:31] OVERCOME ALL SICKNESS, ALL SIN, AND ALL.
[1:28:33] AT CALVARY, HE DONE IT FOR YOU.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Just like a table THAT'S GOING TO BE SET
[1:28:38] FOR THANKSGIVING. AND SOME OF YOU, ALL
[1:28:40] YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS SHOW UP AT THE
[1:28:42] HOUSE AND SIT OUT AND EAT. EVERYTHING'S
[1:28:44] THE NAPKIN, THE FORKS, THE DRINK, the
[1:28:46] plate, the chicken, THE TURKEY.
[1:28:48] EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is sit down and
[1:28:52] eat
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; cuz it's already been paid for. It's
[1:28:55] already been provided for.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Here. Not long ago, I was in a
[1:28:58] restaurant and I I the the waitress come
[1:29:00] by and said, "Is there anything else?" I
[1:29:01] said, "Just the bill." She said, "Well,"
[1:29:04] said someone saw you in here and paid
[1:29:06] for your food. She said, "So if there's
[1:29:08] nothing else, you're free to go."
[1:29:12] And I said, "Well, let me leave a tip."
[1:29:14] She said, "No, no, tip. Everything's
[1:29:16] took care of. So if there's nothing
[1:29:17] else, YOU'RE FREE. JUST GO. You can go."
[1:29:20] Now, I could have argued. I could have
[1:29:22] looked around and said, "Ma'am, there
[1:29:22] ain't nobody in this restaurant I know.
[1:29:25] Are you sure you're talking about me? I
[1:29:27] could have argued. I could have debated.
[1:29:29] I could have even tried to pay for it
[1:29:31] myself."
[1:29:33] Or I could ACCEPT THE FACT THAT someone
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; provided a meal FOR ME AND WALK OUT THAT
[1:29:41] DOOR WITH A BELLY full of steak.
[1:29:44] So what do you think I did?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right.
[1:29:50] I went right out that door because
[1:29:53] someone provided a meal
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; for me
[1:29:59] here. year. A few years ago, I was
[1:30:00] preaching in Manny, Louisiana. And every
[1:30:03] every year, I would preach the second
[1:30:05] week of February. So, I'd get my ticket
[1:30:06] in November to fly down there and I get
[1:30:08] the seat that I wanted to sit on. So, I
[1:30:10] went down and preached to come up to
[1:30:11] Alexandria, Louisiana, and fly home.
[1:30:13] This man come sit down beside me. He
[1:30:15] said, "Hello." I said, "Howdy." He said,
[1:30:16] "Howdy. Where you from?" I said,
[1:30:17] "Tennessee." He said, "Tennessee?" I
[1:30:19] said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well, what
[1:30:21] brought you down here?" I said, "I'm a
[1:30:23] preacher." "Oh, you're a preacher?"
[1:30:26] I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well,
[1:30:28] since you're a preacher, let me ask you
[1:30:30] a question." I said, "Well, buddy, I'm
[1:30:31] not the sharpest knife in the drawer,
[1:30:33] but if I can help you, I'd be glad to do
[1:30:35] it." He said, "My my daughter is getting
[1:30:38] her kids ready to bring me to the
[1:30:39] airport." Said, "I was looking on the
[1:30:41] internet." Said, "I come across
[1:30:42] something so unusual. I want to ask you
[1:30:44] about it." I said, "Well, if I can help
[1:30:45] you, I'd be glad to do it." He said,
[1:30:46] "Have you ever heard of a man by the
[1:30:47] name of William Brandon?"
[1:30:50] I said, "Yes, sir. His grandkids go to
[1:30:52] my church." He did not stop talking all
[1:30:55] the way to Atlanta, Georgia. And when we
[1:30:57] got off the airplane and shook hands and
[1:30:58] said, "God bless you." He went one way,
[1:31:00] I was walking down concourse D in
[1:31:01] Atlanta airport. And I got to thinking
[1:31:03] three months before that man ever knew
[1:31:05] he had a question, God had the answer
[1:31:07] set beside him.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And everything that you have need of
[1:31:15] was already provided before you came
[1:31:17] through those doors this morning.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to accept it, believe it,
[1:31:23] and in your heart confess it. He's the
[1:31:25] high priest of your confession.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; When he died for the sins of the world
[1:31:29] there at Calvary, he healed you. He
[1:31:31] healed every one of you. And you're
[1:31:33] already healed. You're already forgiven
[1:31:35] of your sins if you'll just accept it.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; When the people realize
[1:31:46] that you're not, not you will be, BUT
[1:31:48] YOU ARE PRESENT TENSE, RIGHT? NOT
[1:31:50] SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMEDAY,
[1:31:52] SOME HAPPY DAY. I WON'T NEED IT THEN. I
[1:31:54] NEED IT NOW.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; PUSH IT OFF IN THE MILLENNIUM SOMEWHERE.
[1:31:58] THE BLESSINGS OUT IN THE millennium
[1:31:59] somewhere. WE WON'T NEED DIVINE healing
[1:32:01] in the millennium. IT'S WE NEED IT NOW.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; We won't be sons of God. BUT YOU'RE NOW
[1:32:07] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, JOINT HES
[1:32:09] WITH JESUS CHRIST. EVERYTHING JESUS DIED
[1:32:12] FOR AT CALVARY IS IN YOUR POSSESSION.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; You already own it.
[1:32:19] It's like looking for your keys and
[1:32:20] they're in your pocket
[1:32:22] or looking for your glasses and they're
[1:32:24] on your head.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Well, some of you ain't old enough, but
[1:32:27] you will be.
[1:32:31] But you say Satan don't like that. If
[1:32:33] the people only realize if they'd be
[1:32:34] WILLING TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD, it's
[1:32:37] unlimited. What could happen? Think
[1:32:40] about this. THERE'S OVER 7,000 promises
[1:32:42] in the Bible,
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and every one of them belongs to you.
[1:32:48] They are in your possession.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; You see, the trouble of Christians today
[1:32:51] is they don't realize what's provided
[1:32:53] for them.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; They don't realize the glories and the
[1:32:56] powers that's been provided. Coming into
[1:32:58] Jesus Christ is like walking into an
[1:32:59] arcade.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Like a great department store.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody gave you a department store and
[1:33:05] you walk in to see what you have. Can
[1:33:08] you imagine if Walmart called you up and
[1:33:09] said, "We just found out that you're an
[1:33:11] heir to Sam Walton."
[1:33:15] So, Walmart belongs to you. Oh, God.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know that's right.
[1:33:26] Can you imagine walking into Walmart and
[1:33:28] you own it? Honey, if I own Walmart, I
[1:33:30] wouldn't get the Great Value chips.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I'd get the real Doritos.
[1:33:39] Can I get an amen?
[1:33:42] Think about that. Well, how great that
[1:33:44] would be. BUT I'M TELLING YOU WHAT
[1:33:45] HAPPENED TO YOU THIS MORNING IS GREATER
[1:33:47] THAN SAM WALTON.
[1:33:49] [Applause]
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU BECOME A CHRISTIAN, WALK AROUND
[1:33:54] AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU BELONG. FIND OUT
[1:33:57] WHAT HE HAS UNSHACKLED US AND SET US
[1:34:00] FREE. AMEN.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Do you love him this morning?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me hurry.
[1:34:10] Amen.
[1:34:12] Unshackled.
[1:34:14] Unshackled. You know, sometimes people
[1:34:16] give their heart to the Lord and they're
[1:34:17] doing so good and then they kind of
[1:34:19] stumped their toe, mess up, maybe fall
[1:34:21] back into something they've done before
[1:34:23] and then they feel so guilty and they
[1:34:25] feel like there's no hope for them. But
[1:34:26] I want you to understand if you have
[1:34:27] stumped your toe this morning,
[1:34:30] that does not take away what Jesus done
[1:34:32] for you. You just get up, knock the dust
[1:34:34] off, and go again.
[1:34:38] Huh?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; It's just like that eagle was in the pee
[1:34:40] and that's all. You caged down here in
[1:34:42] sin, but you DON'T WANT TO BE THERE,
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU TRIPPED UP. SOMETHING TRIED TO
[1:34:46] TIE YOU BACK UP.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; BUT you're free this morning.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you're looking up.
[1:34:52] That's the reason something in you is
[1:34:54] longing for something better than what
[1:34:55] you've got. It's a deep calling unto the
[1:34:57] deep. You see, it reminds me of a story
[1:34:59] one time
[1:35:02] of this farmer. This crow was eating all
[1:35:04] his corn. So he coughed this crow and he
[1:35:06] tied it up
[1:35:09] and no corn he the crow ate all the corn
[1:35:11] around him till there was no more corn
[1:35:12] to eat. BUT HE WAS TIED UP. HE COULDN'T
[1:35:14] FLY AWAY
[1:35:17] AND HE JUST ABOUT STARVED TO DEATH.
[1:35:20] HE TIED THE CROW BY ITS FOOT.
[1:35:24] AND SO THE OTHERS HE JUST LEFT HIM THERE
[1:35:26] TIED UP, SHACKLED,
[1:35:28] COULDN'T FLY AWAY. AND THE OTHER CROWS
[1:35:30] WOULD FLY OVER AND THEY'D SAY, "COCK,
[1:35:33] COME ON, JOHNNY. IT'S GETTING
[1:35:35] COLD. WINTER'S COMING. WE'VE GOT TO FLY
[1:35:37] AWAY." BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT. No matter
[1:35:40] how much he wanted to fly, he was tied.
[1:35:44] So one day a certain fellow come BY AND
[1:35:47] SEEN THIS OLD CROW TIED UP AND HE WENT
[1:35:49] OVER AND CAUGHT HIM AND UNTIED HIM.
[1:35:52] SAID, "GO ON, BOY. You're free. You're
[1:35:54] free."
[1:35:56] But he just kept walking around and here
[1:35:59] COME THE CROWS OVER. COME ON, JOHNNY.
[1:36:02] COME ON. WE GOT TO GO.
[1:36:05] He was as free as the rest of them.
[1:36:09] But he wouldn't go. He was so used to
[1:36:11] being tied.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; He thought he was still tied.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; But in reality, he was unshackled.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Think about that.
[1:36:24] And you might have had an affliction FOR
[1:36:26] SO LONG. YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A BESETTING
[1:36:29] SIN FOR SO LONG THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE
[1:36:31] STILL TIED. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:36:33] THIS MORNING.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; You may think THE DEVIL'S GOT YOU TIED
[1:36:38] DOWN, BUT HE'S LYING TO YOU.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; One time a man COME TO THE EARTH NAMED
[1:36:43] JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, AND HE
[1:36:46] UNTIED US.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; SATAN'S LYING to us.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; You don't have to STAY DOWN. YOU DON'T
[1:36:52] HAVE TO STAY BOUND. YOU'RE FREE. HE DIED
[1:36:55] IN YOUR PLACE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SINS.
[1:36:57] JUST FLOP YOUR WINGS. JUST FLY WITH THE
[1:37:00] REST OF THEM.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Don't stay in that pit of the devil.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] Amen. Do you love him?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me close with this. I was
[1:37:16] driving down to Kentucky here a while
[1:37:17] back to preach.
[1:37:19] There's a long stretch of flat road. And
[1:37:22] as I was driving down the road, I looked
[1:37:23] off to my left and there was a beautiful
[1:37:25] bald eagle
[1:37:27] and he lit up out of a tree and I was
[1:37:30] looking because he was out there in
[1:37:31] front of me. There's a roadkill on the
[1:37:33] road. And how long it' been there, I
[1:37:34] don't know, but it was definitely a
[1:37:35] roadkill. And the eagle come out of the
[1:37:38] tree and he flew down and grabbed this
[1:37:41] roadkill up off the road. Well, I was
[1:37:43] trying to find my phone because I wanted
[1:37:44] to video that and I was trying to drive
[1:37:46] and find the phone. And it kept slowing
[1:37:48] down and slowing down and I was watching
[1:37:49] him and he lifted up off the ground and
[1:37:51] he was trying to fly with this roadkill.
[1:37:54] I think it was a raccoon. I wasn't sure.
[1:37:56] But anyway, he was trying to fly with
[1:37:58] this roadkill. But the kill was heavier
[1:38:00] than he had the ability to carry. And he
[1:38:03] was flopping his wings, but he wasn't
[1:38:04] getting no elevation. And I was getting
[1:38:06] closer and closer and closer. And
[1:38:08] finally, he realized, I've got to let it
[1:38:11] go. And when he dropped the roadkill, he
[1:38:14] flapped him wings and he flew off over
[1:38:16] my car like that and went away.
[1:38:20] And I thought, you know, we're God's
[1:38:22] eagles.
[1:38:24] Sometimes things get into our lives that
[1:38:28] we try to fly with.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; We'll pick up fear or we'll pick up
[1:38:35] worry or we'll pick up a besetting sin
[1:38:37] or we'll you
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; and YOU TRY TO FLY WITH IT.
[1:38:41] BUT IT KEEPS YOU FROM GAINING ELEVATION.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you just have to let it
[1:38:50] go.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I was in a hotel room and I was thinking
[1:38:57] of sermons for young people. Had the
[1:38:58] young people's meetings coming up and I
[1:38:59] thought, you know, at that time Frozen,
[1:39:01] that Disney movie Frozen was out. I've
[1:39:02] never seen it, but Frozen movie was out,
[1:39:04] you know, and a lot of people sung songs
[1:39:06] about Let It Go and all that and all
[1:39:09] that that went with that movie. And I
[1:39:10] thought, well, maybe that'd be
[1:39:11] something. No doubt some of these young
[1:39:12] people saw that and that's maybe that
[1:39:14] would be a good thought. So, I just
[1:39:15] wrote on a piece of paper, let it go.
[1:39:17] And I go off to preach. And when I came
[1:39:19] back to the hotel room, my notepad was
[1:39:21] laying there, but there was some words
[1:39:22] wrote underneath it that I didn't write.
[1:39:25] It wasn't even my writing. And I
[1:39:27] thought, "What in the world?" And I got
[1:39:29] closer to it. And I picked it up. You
[1:39:31] know what it said? It was from the
[1:39:32] housekeeper. It said, "Thank you today
[1:39:34] for that. I needed to hear it.
[1:39:40] Let it go.
[1:39:42] Let it go. Oh eagles of God, those
[1:39:45] things that bound you, those things that
[1:39:47] hold you down, those loads that you try
[1:39:49] to carry, those things that are weighing
[1:39:51] you down, just let it go.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; You're already free. Let that grudge go.
[1:39:56] Let that anger go. Let that fear go. Let
[1:39:58] that oppression go. Let it go. Let that
[1:40:01] sickness, you don't you don't have to
[1:40:02] carry that anymore. You're free. for
[1:40:05] whom the sonath made free as free
[1:40:08] indeed.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; You're a free son. You're a free
[1:40:10] daughter.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Just let it go.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; You know, we're the only people that
[1:40:16] unpack to go on a trip.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; We need to unpack because we're going to
[1:40:21] leave here one morning between 6:00 and
[1:40:23] 9 in a moment, and a twinkling of an
[1:40:25] eye.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:31] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:34] Let's just bow our heads. If I kept you
[1:40:36] long, I'm sorry, but just try to bring
[1:40:39] something to you.
[1:40:42] Amen.
[1:40:44] Heavenly Father,
[1:40:47] how we love you today.
[1:40:50] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that
[1:40:54] saved a wretch like me. I once was lost,
[1:40:57] but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I
[1:41:01] see. It was grace that taught my heart
[1:41:04] to fear and grace my fears relieved. How
[1:41:07] precious did that grace appear the hour
[1:41:11] I first believed.
[1:41:15] My chains are gone.
[1:41:19] I've been set free.
[1:41:23] My God, my Savior
[1:41:27] has ransom me.
[1:41:31] And like a flood,
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:34] his mercy reigns.
[1:41:38] Unending love.
[1:41:42] Amazing
[1:41:43] grace.
[1:41:45] My chains are gone.
[1:41:49] I've been set free.
[1:41:53] My God, my Savior
[1:41:56] has ransom me.
[1:42:00] And like a flood
[1:42:04] his mercy reigns
[1:42:08] unending love.
[1:42:12] Amazing
[1:42:13] grace.
[1:42:17] Thank you Lord.
[1:42:19] Thank you for unshackling us Lord.
[1:42:22] Lord, in this season of thanksgiving,
[1:42:25] Lord, I am thankful for so many things.
[1:42:28] But Lord God, I am so thankful that you
[1:42:33] took the chains off of me and said I
[1:42:36] could go free.
[1:42:38] Lord, I pray if there's someone here
[1:42:40] today, Lord, you know, in my heart, I I
[1:42:43] hadn't even planned on preaching this
[1:42:44] message this morning, but early this
[1:42:47] morning, it came upon my heart, Lord.
[1:42:51] And I pray, Father God, if there's
[1:42:52] someone here that don't know you,
[1:42:56] maybe Lord, Satan's lied to them and
[1:42:57] tell them there's no hope for you,
[1:43:00] you'll never be anything.
[1:43:03] But Lord, may they not believe that
[1:43:05] lying devil this morning, but they that
[1:43:08] believe your word
[1:43:10] for your word, oh God, said
[1:43:13] we could go free.
[1:43:16] Lord, the same God that freed that man
[1:43:19] in Nicaragua is the same God that freed
[1:43:21] that woman in the Bible. The same God
[1:43:24] that gave blind Barameus his eyesight
[1:43:26] back
[1:43:29] is the same God who gave my daughter her
[1:43:32] eyesight back. You're the same
[1:43:34] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:43:38] God, I pray this morning, Lord, may the
[1:43:40] people, dear God, take this simple
[1:43:41] thought, Lord, and may they say, "I'm
[1:43:45] just going to let it go. I'm not going
[1:43:47] to hold that grudge. I'm not going to
[1:43:48] I'm not going to hold that no more.
[1:43:51] Anything that would hinder me from
[1:43:52] drawing closer to God, I'm going to let
[1:43:55] it go this morning." If there would be
[1:43:58] one here that would raise your hand and
[1:43:59] say, "Brother Daryl, would you just
[1:44:00] remember me in prayer?
[1:44:03] I've been shackled for years. I've been
[1:44:05] I've let the devil lie to me. Tell me
[1:44:06] there's no hope for me, but I see this
[1:44:08] morning
[1:44:10] he has unshackled me. I'm free. I just
[1:44:13] need to accept it this morning. Would
[1:44:16] you just slip up your hand and say,
[1:44:17] "Would you remember me in prayer?" God
[1:44:19] bless that hand. That hand, that hand.
[1:44:20] God bless that hand. That hand there.
[1:44:22] God bless your hand. Your hand. Yes. God
[1:44:24] bless you back there. There. There. Oh
[1:44:26] my. All over the building. There. There.
[1:44:27] God bless you there. Yes. God bless you.
[1:44:30] God bless you, sis. God bless you. Amen.
[1:44:33] Anyone else? Anyone else? You say, "Bro,
[1:44:36] brother, how how long does it take Jesus
[1:44:39] to forgive me? As long as it takes you
[1:44:42] to ask, as long as it takes you to ask,
[1:44:46] my sins are gone. I've been set free."
[1:44:50] Anyone else would just like to raise
[1:44:51] your hand this morning? Say, "Would you
[1:44:54] remember me?" Or perhaps you you've
[1:44:56] accepted that, but you've let Satan tie
[1:44:58] you down with some kind of ideal or some
[1:45:00] kind of habit. that there are things on
[1:45:03] the internet that you shouldn't be
[1:45:04] looking at. Maybe they've got you bound
[1:45:06] up in your life and you feel so guilty
[1:45:08] that you can't even raise your hand in
[1:45:10] church, but he come to set you free this
[1:45:13] morning. You don't have to carry that no
[1:45:15] more. I say let it go. Just lay it at
[1:45:17] his feet. Like a few years ago when I
[1:45:20] was in Chief Alaska, this young girl
[1:45:21] came up addicted to alcohol. She said,
[1:45:24] "I've got a little boy. I don't know who
[1:45:26] the daddy was cuz I was con he was
[1:45:27] conceived when I was drunk." said, "I've
[1:45:29] been through the ninestep program three
[1:45:31] different times. I cannot stop
[1:45:33] drinking." And I said, "Sis," she said,
[1:45:35] "Brother, I've tried everything." I
[1:45:37] said, "Have you tried Jesus? You just
[1:45:40] lay that alcohol down and pick up his
[1:45:41] freedom." And when I began to pray for
[1:45:43] that girl, I'll never forget it. She
[1:45:45] screamed out to the top of her lungs,
[1:45:47] "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." But I
[1:45:51] was just up there just a couple of
[1:45:52] months ago, and she came up to me said,
[1:45:55] "Brother Darl, I'm still sober." Oh my.
[1:45:58] That's the God we serve today. And if
[1:46:01] you're here, you just slip up your head.
[1:46:03] Say, "Would you remember me in prayer,
[1:46:05] brother D? I've got this I've got this
[1:46:06] thing that ties me down, but I want to
[1:46:08] let it go today in the name of Jesus."
[1:46:10] Yes. God bless those standing. God bless
[1:46:12] you. God bless you. Yes. God bless you.
[1:46:15] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just pray for
[1:46:18] our sisters just a moment and we'll
[1:46:20] pray. Amen.
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:33] Set free.
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:57] I just pray
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:05] my daughter
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:15] in the name of Jesus.
[1:47:21] Father
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:44] Hallelujah. Now, let's just stand to our
[1:47:46] feet, can't we, everyone? Now, let's
[1:47:49] just stand to our feet if you're able.
[1:47:50] And here's what I want us to do. Let's
[1:47:51] just lay hands on one another and pray
[1:47:53] for one another. We're a body of
[1:47:55] believers today. It might have been your
[1:47:56] brother. It might have been your sister,
[1:47:58] your husband, your wife that raised
[1:47:59] their hand that has a need this morning.
[1:48:02] Oh my. On this Thanksgiving week, let us
[1:48:05] come, oh my, by Thursday with a great
[1:48:07] shout of thanksgiving because those
[1:48:09] things that have hindered us has said
[1:48:11] we've been set free today. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:15] Heavenly Father, Lord, we don't see all
[1:48:18] things, but we do see Jesus. And Lord, I
[1:48:21] know God, this little broke up mess.
[1:48:23] Lord, I I ain't no kind of a preacher,
[1:48:24] Lord. I know I'm not. But, Father, you
[1:48:26] know my heart today. Lord, it was on my
[1:48:28] heart to bring this word to the people.
[1:48:30] And God, may we realize today, but what
[1:48:32] you have already done for us. We who was
[1:48:34] bound is tied up where it seemed like
[1:48:36] there was no way out, but you have
[1:48:38] unshackled us today. And you said we
[1:48:40] shall go free. And Lord, you see the
[1:48:42] hands that was raised, my brothers, MY
[1:48:44] SISTER THAT RAISED THEIR HANDS TODAY. I
[1:48:46] ask you, Father God, in the name of
[1:48:48] Jesus, may you move, God, from one to
[1:48:51] the other to the other. Flow through us,
[1:48:52] Holy Spirit. Oh God, MAY WE HEAR THE
[1:48:55] CHAINS fall off. My chains are gone. I'm
[1:48:57] free today. I'm free today. The blood of
[1:49:00] THE LAMB OF GOD HAS made me free. WHAT A
[1:49:03] THANKSGIVING. WHAT A DAY. WHAT AN HOUR
[1:49:05] TO BE LIVING IN WHEN THE WORLD is bound.
[1:49:08] Oh God, THIS NATION IS BOUND. OH GOD, BY
[1:49:11] THEIR BY THEIR IDEALS, LORD, and their
[1:49:13] political views, but oh GOD, YOU HAVE
[1:49:16] LIBERATED US, LORD. You have liberated
[1:49:18] US BY THE POWER OF the resurrection of
[1:49:21] Jesus Christ. And we accept it today in
[1:49:24] the name of Jesus Christ. SATAN, YOU'RE
[1:49:26] A LIAR. COME OUT OF THE people in the
[1:49:29] name of Jesus Christ. I receive it
[1:49:31] today. I receive MY FORGIVENESS. I
[1:49:33] RECEIVE MY FREEDOM. I receive my
[1:49:35] deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:38] in the name of Jesus Christ. Or if you
[1:49:41] believe it today, if you believe it
[1:49:42] today, lift your hand up to him and say,
[1:49:44] "I receive it today." In the name of
[1:49:47] Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. My
[1:49:54] God, my Savior
[1:49:57] has ransomed me.
[1:50:01] And like a flood,
[1:50:04] his mercy reigns.
[1:50:08] Unending love,
[1:50:12] amazing
[1:50:14] grace.
[1:50:16] My sins are gone.
[1:50:20] I've been set free.
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:23] My God, my Savior
[1:50:27] has ransomed me. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:50:31] you, Lord. Thank you for saving me.
[1:50:36] Great
[1:50:38] unending love.
[1:50:43] Oh, let's sing it again. As brother Matt
[1:50:45] comes with all the hearts. Do you
[1:50:46] believe it now? Are gone. My chains are
[1:50:48] gone. I've been set free.
[1:50:53] My God, my Savior
[1:50:57] has ransomed me.
[1:51:01] And like a flood,
[1:51:04] his mercy reigns.
[1:51:08] Unending blood.
[1:51:12] Amazing
[1:51:14] grace.
[1:51:17] Amen.
[1:51:18] You know, I just reminded of
[1:51:21] the prophet tells the story of being in
[1:51:22] that museum and there was a a black man
[1:51:25] standing there looking into a display
[1:51:27] window and the man jumped back and
[1:51:30] started crying, started to pray. And the
[1:51:32] prophet went over to him and said, "Sir,
[1:51:34] I I saw you there and I saw you jump
[1:51:36] back and start to pray and said, I I I
[1:51:38] don't want to be nosy, but could you
[1:51:39] tell me what excited you so much?" And
[1:51:43] he said, "Look yonder."
[1:51:45] He said, "I looked there was a dress."
[1:51:47] and said it was just a dress. He said,
[1:51:48] "But look on the corner of that dress.
[1:51:50] You see the corner of that dress? It's a
[1:51:52] blood stain."
[1:51:54] Said, "That's the blood of Abraham
[1:51:56] Lincoln." He said, "I have scars on my
[1:52:00] side from a slave belt, but the blood of
[1:52:04] Abraham Lincoln took the slave belt off
[1:52:07] of me."
[1:52:09] And the prophet said, "I put my arm
[1:52:11] around him and I said, "Brother, that's
[1:52:12] a wonderful story,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; but I tell you one greater than that.
[1:52:17] We wore the slave belt of Satan. If he
[1:52:19] told me to drink, I drank. If he told me
[1:52:20] to lie, I lied. Come on, somebody. If he
[1:52:22] told me to do things I shouldn't do, I
[1:52:24] done it cuz I was his slave. BUT ONE
[1:52:26] DAY, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST TOOK THAT
[1:52:29] SLAVE FELL OFF OF ME. AND TODAY, I AM
[1:52:32] FREE.
[1:52:34] FREE.
[1:52:36] FREE.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Happy Thanksgiving.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Happy Thanksgiving.
[1:52:43] Mercy reigns.
[1:52:47] Unending love,
[1:52:50] amazing grace.
[1:52:55] Oh, the Lord
[1:52:57] has promised
[1:52:59] good to me.
[1:53:02] His word my faith secures.
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:10] He will my shield and portion
[1:53:16] me.
[1:53:17] As long as life
[1:53:21] endures,
[1:53:24] my chains are gone.
[1:53:27] I've been set free.
[1:53:31] My God, my savior,
[1:53:35] he has ransomed me.
[1:53:38] And like a flood,
[1:53:42] his mercy reigns,
[1:53:46] unending love,
[1:53:50] amazing grace.
[1:53:53] I say like a flood
[1:53:57] his mercy reigns.
[1:54:01] Unending love,
[1:54:05] amazing grace.
[1:54:08] How many's been set free this morning?
[1:54:10] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[1:54:12] clap of praise? Well, I'm free.
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:17] Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer
[1:54:22] bound,
[1:54:24] no more chains holding me. My soul is
[1:54:29] resting.
[1:54:31] It's such a blessing.
[1:54:34] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:54:38] free.
[1:54:41] I say I'm free.
[1:54:45] Praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer
[1:54:48] bound,
[1:54:51] no more flesh holding me. My soul is
[1:54:55] resting.
[1:54:57] It's such a blessing.
[1:55:01] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free.
[1:55:06] Amen. If you ain't free this morning,
[1:55:08] you come to a place to get it. For the
[1:55:10] Bible said, "Cast your burden upon the
[1:55:12] Lord and he shall sustain thee." You
[1:55:15] know what I find out wonderful? I thank
[1:55:17] God that his word is not limited by
[1:55:20] human circumstances, but God's word is
[1:55:23] unlimited. And if he said, "Cast your
[1:55:24] burden on me," it don't matter how big
[1:55:26] the burden is or how big the pressure
[1:55:28] is. We got we got a place that we can
[1:55:30] take it this morning and we can come out
[1:55:32] on the other side. Say, "I am free."
[1:55:38] Praise the Lord. The devil don't win the
[1:55:41] battles.
[1:55:43] no longer bound.
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, my soul is resting.
[1:55:51] It's such a blessing.
[1:55:55] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free.
[1:56:00] Oh, I say I'm free.
[1:56:08] No longer bound.
[1:56:12] No change holding me. My soul is
[1:56:16] resting.
[1:56:18] It's such a blessing.
[1:56:21] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:56:26] I'm free.
[1:56:29] Amen. How many enjoyed that message this
[1:56:31] morning? Amen. What a reminder,
[1:56:33] testimony after testimony that no matter
[1:56:36] what the shackle is, he told us of some
[1:56:39] that had their hands shackled, some
[1:56:41] their heart was shackled, some their
[1:56:42] spirit was shackled, some their their
[1:56:44] flesh, their body, a sickness, no matter
[1:56:47] what kind of shackle it was. But there's
[1:56:49] one thing in common that Jesus Christ
[1:56:51] set you free from every one of them. I
[1:56:53] believe that this morning. I believe
[1:56:54] there ain't but one place that you can
[1:56:56] go. Amen. And we can try a lot of things
[1:56:58] to try to be freed and things that bind
[1:57:01] us in our life. And there's a lot of lot
[1:57:03] of ways to try to get rid of it, but
[1:57:05] you'll find this to be the truth. It'll
[1:57:07] always come back until Jesus Christ
[1:57:09] takes that place in your life. It'll
[1:57:12] constantly come back. And the Bible says
[1:57:14] that he said even after a spirit has
[1:57:15] gone out of a man, he'll wander around
[1:57:18] in the wilderness and he'll come back to
[1:57:20] that place and find him that it's
[1:57:22] uninhabited.
[1:57:24] Even though a spirit has left you, and
[1:57:25] you could have a spirit prayed off of
[1:57:27] you and completely gone out of your
[1:57:29] life, but it'll come back and find that
[1:57:31] house uninhabited. And he'll come back
[1:57:33] into the house, but bring with him seven
[1:57:35] of his friends, seven other spirits
[1:57:38] worse than that second state of a man is
[1:57:41] worse than the first state of a man.
[1:57:42] Isn't that an odd thing that even after
[1:57:44] a man is delivered of something, he
[1:57:46] winds up worse than he was before he was
[1:57:48] delivered because he never had the house
[1:57:50] inhabited. So, don't just try to get rid
[1:57:52] of things in your life or take things
[1:57:54] out of your life or or cast things off
[1:57:56] of your life, but try to fill your life
[1:57:58] and add things to your life and and
[1:58:00] bring something in your life that is
[1:58:02] satisfying a hungry soul this morning.
[1:58:05] Amen. Jesus Christ is the only thing
[1:58:07] that can do that. And I believe what
[1:58:09] brother Daryl preached this morning.
[1:58:10] Amen. You love the Lord this morning. It
[1:58:13] don't matter what the devil tells you. I
[1:58:14] know he tries to put us down. And
[1:58:16] remember, we're not having a a service
[1:58:18] on Wednesday night. We're going to come
[1:58:20] back Sunday uh just uh having a a
[1:58:23] wonderful time of Thanksgiving uh with
[1:58:26] the families. I know many will be gone
[1:58:28] in different places for Thanksgiving. So
[1:58:30] uh just go and be a uh be a testimony
[1:58:33] and have a good time with your family
[1:58:35] and just have this week an opportunity
[1:58:37] to be a a witness and just rejoicing in
[1:58:39] the things that God has done for us.
[1:58:42] Amen. How many is a thankful Christian
[1:58:44] this morning? Amen. And we got we got so
[1:58:47] many things to thank him for. And I I'll
[1:58:48] tell you what we do. And whenever that
[1:58:50] old depression and all those things come
[1:58:52] around, it's just something about it.
[1:58:54] Whenever there's a joy that comes to the
[1:58:56] church that right behind it, there's a
[1:58:57] devil to try to rob you from it. Just a
[1:58:59] little bit of joy, a little bit revival,
[1:59:01] and Satan's always trying to take it.
[1:59:03] But you just turn around and tell the
[1:59:04] devil this morning that you're going to
[1:59:05] go on anyway. I'm going to go on and
[1:59:07] serve the Lord, and I'm going to go on
[1:59:09] and be a Christian, and I'm going to go
[1:59:10] on and have my revival, and and you're
[1:59:12] not going to take it from me because I'm
[1:59:14] free this morning. And God sent a word
[1:59:15] all the way from Tennessee to remind you
[1:59:17] that you've been set free by the blood
[1:59:19] of Jesus Christ. Amen. So, we're not
[1:59:21] going to walk around with our heads
[1:59:22] down. I'm going to walk around with my
[1:59:23] head held high. Amen. Like that that
[1:59:26] that story of the slave. Remember, they
[1:59:28] came in and a guy was trying to to
[1:59:30] purchase him and and here he was in
[1:59:32] slavery and all bound up, but he was
[1:59:34] over there rejoicing and singing. And he
[1:59:36] said, "I I want to get I want that guy."
[1:59:38] And he said, "That guy can't go nowhere.
[1:59:40] He's not for sale." And he said, "Well,
[1:59:42] why not?" And he said, well, he he said,
[1:59:44] he seems to be the happiest one. He's
[1:59:46] out here like that. What would So he
[1:59:47] went and asked him, why why in the world
[1:59:49] do you act that way here? You're bound
[1:59:50] up. You're a slave. You're working. You
[1:59:53] can't even have no freedom, but still
[1:59:54] you act like all this and joy in your
[1:59:56] heart. He said, because over in his
[1:59:59] country where he come from, where he was
[2:00:01] taken, that man's father is a king. And
[2:00:04] he knows that in his veins flows the
[2:00:06] blood of a king. No matter where you put
[2:00:08] him, no matter how many chains you put
[2:00:10] on him, no matter how many times he he
[2:00:12] would he would be bound, he knows and
[2:00:14] that where he come from his lineage,
[2:00:16] that he's the father or he's the son of
[2:00:18] a king. And I thought, you know what?
[2:00:20] That's the way it is with the believers
[2:00:21] this morning. It don't matter what Satan
[2:00:23] tries to bind you with and what chain
[2:00:24] you're under. Why is it the devil would
[2:00:26] look at you, that old devil, that come
[2:00:28] over and try to purchase and try to take
[2:00:30] you and and say, "But you know, there's
[2:00:32] something about him that's free anyhow
[2:00:34] because I know that I'm a child of a
[2:00:36] king this morning. He's the king of
[2:00:38] kings and I'm his son." How many can
[2:00:39] raise your hand this morning and say,
[2:00:41] "I'm a child of a kings." God bless you
[2:00:43] as you go and may you have a wonderful
[2:00:45] Thanksgiving. Oh yes.
[2:00:49] Oh yes.
[2:00:51] I'm a child
[2:00:54] of the king.
[2:00:57] His royal
[2:00:59] blood

[2:03:15] Well, some people may laugh, talk about
[2:03:18] me when I shout, but there's one thing I
[2:03:21] know. I know what I'm shouting about.
[2:03:25] Well, Satan tries to stop me. Put stumb
[2:03:28] blocks in my way. I stand up for my Lord
[2:03:32] and this is what I say. Well, I'm going

[2:03:56] crooks and miss. Got to go on with
[2:03:59] Jesus. I know he's my best friend. When
[2:04:03] the enemy is all around me and sorrow

[2:04:09] knees. I rise up with a smile. But I'm
