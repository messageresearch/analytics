effort that's been made to make work to be able to allow God to come and sacrifice has made and people have gathered we've invited our friends and many ministers and churches represented here tonight

can sing this song Holy Spirit they are welcome in this place we just want to give our brother plenty of time to speak and allow God to use him tonight thank each one of you for coming and and supporting the meeting but we just want God to be able to have his way amen to pull from the gift of God how many believes that if you pull from God's gift that you're going to receive something how

[Music] Spirit go me this place father of Mercy [Music] our amen we certainly want to make the the Lord welcome here tonight amen we've invited him amen I certainly want to believe we want to make him welcome tonight amen giving him a place and we know uh it was in the scriptures when they invited him the Bible said they invited him but they Dev washed his feet many people think that's just that uh the Pharisees didn't take out about a a p of water and wash his feet but that really wasn't what that was about what that was about was that they had put in in their religious circles that Jesus was a dirty thing and that he was a be elab above because of his prophetic gift and what he was able to do and the healing and the forgiving of sins and they had just about convinced everyone that Jesus was someone to be avoided he was someone to be laughed at someone to be made fun of but there was one little woman ruined it all and she come in the room and she began to wash his feet and she began to say that this is the spirit of God this is him this is right and see tonight we thank the Lord that when we invite him and then he comes in in great power we don't run from it and well that's uh from the wrong Spirit but yet we worship Him and we invite him amen it's much like when he visited the tent of Abraham when he came there remember in the scriptures and Abraham was sitting in the door of the tent when the Lord came unto him and when he came he told Sarah said go go kill some a calf and bring the meat and get a pel of water some milk and and we'll make these folks welcome and I tell you tonight I believe that you can entertain the presence of God you can make him welcome when he begins to move you can just Reach Out amen and get a hold of him I believe you're his children tonight amen how many how many of his children do we have here tonight do you know that he would come in this tent for just one but here tonight you've all gathered together knowing that he would come to meet the need and knowing what kind of God he is there is nothing that is impossible there's nothing out of his reach tonight and so when he comes by your way now don't you just sit there and say well that's just a little little feeling or that's just the preacher saying a word but you but you recognize when Jesus passes your way Reach Out And Touch him reach out and get a hold of him like Jacob did the angel and said Lord I'm not going to let you go till you blessing me amen I believe you have a right to do that tonight because we're his children amen what a what a blessing it is to be in

bless you tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to just speak to you a few minutes tonight upon amen I I want to talk from the subject tonight uh from The Book of Luke uh we want to go to the Book of Luke and let me just get here to where it's at U Luke chapter 1 and verse 26 it's real familiar to you uh this is the encounter of God moving into human flesh now the Book of Genesis the second third chapter tells us how the devil got in the flesh but this is one going to tell us how God got in the flesh and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth and to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored for the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation would this be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou found favor with God and behold thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus and he he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and the kingdom there shall be no end I tell you that's shout material right there is it amen then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man now this is not a question of doubt this is a question you're going to do it how's it going how you going to do this amen I don't know a man how's this going to be and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee and thou this holy thing which shall be born to thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Eliz Elizabeth she has conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her from whom it was called baren for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the hand made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her God bless you as you may be have your seats tonight I want to talk to you and if I would take a title I want to talk to you about the God of Miracles the god of Miracles this Mary was a person amen I believe who served God and her husband husband Joseph brother Ram tells us the drama it's a beautiful story uh he talks about how that when Mary met this Angel what must have been on her mind you know he said that maybe her and Joseph had just been down to the synagogue a couple days before and amen I I believe they probably were gathering there on Saturdays and hearing it and it's maybe along about Sunday or Monday morning amen she was headed down to the well and you know I've been there in those Eastern countries and and they got a usually a community well and many of you missionaries you've seen that where brother Forest they'll put something on their head and carry it down to get the water and carry it back and and she was just a young girl that was going to be helping doing the washing that morning uh for her mama so she went down there and picked all the morning uh morning water up and she was carrying it and brother R said just about the time she come to a corner he said uh it was just about the rising of the Sun and she was just in the corner of things and just seeing the sun rising and that's when the angel stepped out he said but when she first saw it she thought it was just a glisten maybe off of a a piece of metal or a piece of glass or something but then it began to become an angel and and it stood out in her path now he said now what she was thinking about is she was thinking about that sermon she had heard the day before and she had heard how that the the priest had talked about the greatness of God in the days of Moses and how God was had done all these wonderful things he said but he had come down to that scripture and talked about how that in the the book of Isaiah the 7th chapter that a virgin would conceive and he was talking about all these wonderful things and then the and then the uh the preacher said well I wish the god of the days of Moses was still that kind of God today said and after the service her and and her mama and Joseph sat around and talked about how amen how that he was doing such a good job until the preacher got to that part about God being the same today and said but you know we believe that that was the book of Isaiah and we believe that Isaiah was a Vindicated Prophet that he came from God and and that if God would use the mouth of a man like Isaiah to prophesy a virgin shall conceive we believe that that scripture would have to be the words of God and they're going to have to come to pass in somebody's life you know God doesn't have to prove his word in every person's life but if he just proves it in one person's life then that word is true and is proven amen and and that morning maybe when she was down to the well she would think it over that scripture of Isaiah and that's just when the when the angel stepped out and began to talk to her you know I believe that it's when we think on the things of God that's when we have encounters with God that's when we have encounters with the angel of God and and when she was thinking on that scripture she was thinking unto us a child is born a son is given she was thinking about a virgin would conceive and how them things must have been going over in her mind but when that angel met her he began to say Amen uh uh Mary thou had been favored of God and and to think when she begin to hear those words come to her Thou shalt have a son and amen and thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall be the son of the highest how she must have begin to recognize that this is the Messiah that this is fing to come into my womb and she says how can this thing be you know amen she wasn't asking a question of doubt she was asking a question of how could it be that I'm going to conceive and bear when I haven't known a man but God gave her the instructions when he said to her Thou shalt be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost amen I believe that's an answer to a lot of things of how you're going to get something that God promised to you because sometimes it's not going to involve a man amen a man can't do things for you that God can do for you but the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost can change situations of lives and he can make things different in people's hearts because is still God Amen and when she began to and when she began to walk there she was walking thinking of the scriptures and that's when the angel met her and I'll tell you this if you want to have encounters with God get the word of God on your mind and and begin to think about it amen begin to think about the scriptures of our age and and the scriptures that's supposed to be manifested in our generation and let the Holy Spirit began to minister to you on it I believe it church I believe the Bible said in Romans the 8th chapter that there is now no more condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now you can't change it that you're in the flesh but you don't have to walk after the flesh you can walk in the spirit of God whereby you're thinking on the things of God your your your your mind is on the things of God but walking after the spirit now in Romans 8:2 he said for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death now here's the thing many people think because that I'm In the Flesh I can't walk in the spirit but amen even when I worship God people say well don't get in the flesh worshiping God but I live in the flesh so where else am I supposed to worship God am I supposed to wait till I have a theophany to worship God Amen but I'm going to worship God while I'm in this flesh and and you know what sometimes this flesh ain't going to feel like worshiping God but there's a man on the inside it that's not subject to the feelings of the thing that's in my flesh amen and I'm going to worship God when I don't feel like it and and when the devil's against me and my body is tired and everything is going but God is going to let me do it anyhow because the flesh don't have dominion over that man on the inside Hallelujah cuz there's a law you're you're living under the law of sin and death how many realizes that you live under the law of death if you don't know that and amen that's why that you're getting older and that's why you're amen gravity and and the feelings are setting upon us is because we're living under a law and that law is the law of sin and death it's a real law but the same as there is a law of sin and death there is a law of the spirit of life now this is the powerful thing to me amen is there are two laws now brother brandom says that there's two laws and God's law of course the law of sin and death came through Adam and was magnified on Mount SII when God gave the law unto man it magnified his weakness before God so anybody trying to live by the law amen automatically you're defeated because it's the law but it's the law of sin and death but there is another law and that is the law of Mount Calvary that whenever man fail in the Book of Genesis amen God came unto man and Grace amen came to them because God loved them and couldn't see them his children throwed out so God in his love made a way for them to return and remember what God said to them when he came in Genesis the 3r chapter and he said the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the Serpent's Seed remember when he said that amen because he was already making a covenant with them amen that I'm going to bring you back where you came from I'm I'm going to do that amen that God was going to do that when he met Abraham in the Book of Genesis whom we spoke a little bit on last night amen when God met Abraham in the Book of Genesis he said Abraham I have already blessed thee amen now he had already blessed him in Genesis 15 it was when Abraham asked God how are you going to do this just like Mary asked how Abraham asked how God you're going to do it and that's when God told Abraham take make yourself five sacrifices and lay them upon the Altar and remember when he divided all the sacrifices but he didn't sacri divide the turtle doves remember that because they represented Divine Healing and Divine Healing was both in the old Covenant and the New Covenant but God took the Beast of the altars and set them upon the Altar and when he did he caused Abraham to go to sleep I tell you it's a powerful thing because you don't have anything to do with the Covenant that God is going to use to save you matter of fact God put Abraham to sleep before he showed him the light that moved down between the sacrifices because God said I I'm going to save you Abraham and he was going to do it by the cross listen there is no salvation outside of the cross of Jesus Christ Jesus was the sacrifices on Abraham's altar amen Jesus was the blood of the bu and goats but that day at Calvary amen what he did when he finished the work of God I love those great words when he gave up The Ghost and he cried out it is finished he said it is finished amen then there was the day that we could say it's already done I don't know if you're aware of it or not amen but your salvation is already finished God canot do one more thing to save you tonight but he would send a gospel preacher and by the hearing of Faith heathens would be saved to them that Believe come on Romans 10:9 is still in my Bible it said he that believeth in his heart that Jesus is is a Son of God and confess it with his mouth Thou shalt be saved whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and how shall you call upon whom you have not known and how can you hear without God sending a preacher to you come on church but the preaching of the word of God is the pr is the faith that comes into your heart that saves you that heals you because your salvation is finished your healing is finished let me just say this it's already done that is the law of life it is already done that's the law Christians live by it's not what we do ourself it's what God has done for us my goodness it's what God has done for us do you know that if by one man's offense death Reign by one then much more shall we receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness that shall reign in this life by one Jesus Christ if we all got into this shape because of what Adam did then why can't we all get out of this shape because of what Jesus did come on there's a first man Adam and there's a last man Adam if you had a bunch of skiers and they're all tied together and they're climbing a mountain and everybody's tied to the same rope and the first Adam fell off amen and everybody was going with him but the last Adam amen got a hold of something then one man caused the fall but the other man saved you all and tonight there was the last man Adam and climbed up to calvary's tree and he stood amen and made a way for every believer to hear tonight to be in the presence of God by one Faith see by one in this life we're not waiting to the Millennium to Reign but we are right now Kings and Priests of God come on Church you know it's true king is the highest in the Civil order and God said you were a king and a priest is the highest in the religious order and God said you're a priest we will not be Kings and Priests in the Millennium we are Kings and Priests right now tonight spiritual Kings reigning in this life over sin and death and we are reigning by the grace of God come on folks I I can read it to you we reign in this life by one you say reigning in this life do you know the prophet of God said you're reigning right now over sin over flesh and over the devil I know the devil don't like that kind of preaching but he's already under our feet that's why in Romans 16 and 20 said the God of Peace shall Brew Satan under your feet that's why it says in Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 20 that Jesus has put all things under his feet and he sat down at the right hand of God where he gave us power over all things my goodness there is a law of death but there is a law of life I don't know of any other way to explain it really than the law of gravity and the law of aerodynamics the law of gravity I don't have to preach to you tonight you all know about that one now gravity Works more on some of us than others you don't have to have a bachelor's degree to know about gravity climb up there on that porch and jump off you will get a expedited education quickly you will understand the law of gravity is at work but you can also go maybe you want to go overseas tonight or you want to go to another place you can go down there to Little Rock or you can go over to Memphis and you can climb on a Jet Plane and go in there and sit down and they have got a law called The Law of aerodynamics that will actually break the law of gravity I tell you I thank God tonight to know there is a law that supersedes other laws sure it's true there's a law of death but there's also a law of life sure gravity is real but there's the law of hero Dynamics don't tell me it don't exist I have experienced the law superseding the other law yes I'm In the Flesh yes I struggle in the flesh but there is another law it is the law of life it is the law of the spirit of God that makes all other laws come subject to the law of God there's actually four laws to the law of aerodynamics amen their first four of those laws my dad used to be a pilot he knows all about these laws right here the law of aerodynamics the first law is lift you have to have lift and the law of of of of lift is a law of weight now there's four of them law of lift law of weight the third law is the law of thrust and there's the law of drag now what the law is speaking of is the lift has got to be greater than the weight amen now you'd be surprised how much them 747s weigh but they have built it in such a way that it can get lift no matter how much it weighs but you can understand now why if a church is going to go higher that it has to weigh less that's why amen that Paul said let us lay aside every weight that so easily besets us that we might run this race listen amen there's things that God has called you to do that you're overweight to do it you've got to lay aside some of your memories and some of your thinking and some of your ideas if you're going where I'm going you got to get lighter and be able to raise up in the power of God and see God do miracles in your age it's the law it's the law of lift if you want to get above it you got to get rid of the weight of sin and sin is unbelief sin is looking in the mirror and saying I can't never do it and I'm such a failure and I've always been a failure and I'll always be a failure oh but what about the blood of Jesus Christ what about Calvary what about what God did for you there is another law hallelujah it's a law of lift you know what the lifting power is the lifting power of the church is the blood of Jesus Christ if you're going to get off of the ground as a Believer you got to experience the power of the blood my goodness something that'll lift you up something that'll get you off of the ground now now there is a third law is a law of thrust and a law of drag now I don't know these preachers understand this some of you feel it maybe you don't know what it is sometimes but sometimes there's more drag than there is thrust sometimes you're trying to go somewhere and people standing on the brakes it's like getting out trying to push a car and looking in there and the person that's behind the wheels got both feet on the brakes we're trying to go somewhere and you're on the brakes let me let me just say to you tonight get off the brakes it's time to quit surpassing the same Mountain let's go northward let's go to the promises let's go to the power of God hallelujah I don't want to stay back there and argue all these things God has sent a prophet in this age and gave us a word that's why you never see an airplane flying with a parachute out the back amen that's why they're they don't do that they cut them loose because they got to have thrust they got to have forward movement and the church is moving on brother back there in the Old Testament they they would Camp amen but once in a while that Pillar of Fire would come by and they had to pull all their stakes and they had to get on the move because the pillar of fire was moving may I say to you tonight thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride pull up your Pentecostal Stakes pull up your Baptist Stakes pull up your Lutheran Stakes we are going to The Rapture we're going to keep moving by the power of God because we are going forward hey we are not going backwards we are going forward this is the day of power if you're a studier of scripture the Bible says in Psalms 116 amen that when mecdc comes flesh that will be a people willing in the day of power well this is the day of power this is a power that can take you beyond churchianity there's a power that can take you beyond fear it can take you beyond your doubts it can take you into a realm where all things are possible now the church has got to get into the power of God to be lifted up in the presence of God Amen I believe this I believe we're in a place that we are to rub out all the make belief and the unbelief and get into something real I believe it I I believe we're in a place that excuse me that we are to be able to get into that and something to Lift Us higher this is like it was in the days of Noah and also like it was in the days of L there's two things Mysteries that Jesus didn't reveal when he said that he said one thing but left something unsaid and in the days of lot there was a visitation of Elohim to Abraham at the tent door it was a secret amen and in the days of Noah there was a Rapture of Enoch it was a secret and the secrets was not to be unfolded until the seven thunders of Revelations 10 was to be revealed and then the symbols would come on off of the book to identify where we are in the age we're living in now I'm not left my subject I want you to know the prophet said in the days of Noah amen the Enoch's pyramids they had a power to lift those great stones and put them in place he said but today we don't have the power it takes to put them Stones up there on that pyramid oh I'll tell you this the world has not discovered a power to get man higher than Church m ship they have not discovered a power to get them a faith or Temperance or godliness they can't get no higher than that but there's come a message from God there's come a blood there's come a holy ghost power that will lift men up and place them in the headship of Jesus Christ brother there's a message right now that can pick you up and take you to the mind of God where you were before the foundations of the world oh take me to Higher Ground Lord lift me up and let me stand where all things are possible in the presence of God a power to Lift Us amen it's a power I believe it today I believe as you begin to speak on the scriptures as you begin to meditate on the word that's when God begins to move it was when two men were on the road to EMAs that Jesus stepped out and began to talk with them you know what they were doing they were talking about things that had happened in that time but they wasn't even in the positive in that moment but when Jesus draw new to them he said what's the problem what you guys talking about here and they said are you a stranger in these parts have you not heard of all these things that's going on in the message I mean have you have heard of all these things and Jesus said what things what things what things are you focused on what things are the problems you're talking about come on it's time to change your perspective what are you looking at that's why you can't get off of the ground because you're seeing the problems you're seeing the troubles you're seeing the issues but if you would turn and look to Jesus you would find a power that'll lift you off of the Earth what things what things come on y'all know what I'm talking about what things now little did they know them men at Destiny Jesus had already died on the cross he had already ascended to the father done the work of the high priest had returned in a corporal an immortal body they were already without sin them men sin dead had been paid the resurrected one was standing in the midst of them and they were worried about some things that had been going on I tell you tonight I think we ought to quit worrying about things and start looking at what God has done in our age I believe it would bring Faith higher if we would look at what God has done in this age that's why Paul said forget those things which are behind you I'm glad he said things ain't you because he wasn't naming one thing he was naming whatever thing it is that's dragging you amen that's waiting you I believe you are to Cut Loose tonight and Rise higher in God where all things are possible well I feel like the preacher doesn't showed up tonight Hallelujah Cut Loose cut loose and let the Holy Ghost move I believe the church ought to be thinking about a god they didn't make now I don't know if in this here English language we use the word God as an object of worship but everybody you you know this that jobs can be God and and a piano can be God and your husband could be God your pastor could be your Gods you know people have gods of all kinds amen but the word God in the Hebrew is the word Elohim amen which is not the same as one that has created it is a self-existent one no other words there was nobody that created Our God and there was a time he wasn't even known to you as God he was known as Elohim he was self-existent because there was nothing to worship him but he created angels and he created the heavens and the Bible lets us know the Angels began to worship him and that's when he become God is when the Angels began to worship him he became an object of worship let me say something to you tonight amen do you know that that God is the god of those angels and he's the god of Abraham he said it and of Isaac and of Jacob because they worshiped him do you know he might be your mama's God he might be your grandparents God but he will never be your God until you begin to worship him as he is I don't know tonight you want to make him your God come on my God is not a God that created himself amen many people worship the god of their imaginations they worship the unknown God they worship gods of history and gods of tradition amen but I worship the God of this Bible the god that wrote this Bible and the actions of that God that's recorded in this Bible I certainly believe the Bible is the inspiration of God how many believe that the Bible said that it was written by in ins spiration as men were moved upon by inspiration and it's good for Doctrine and it's good for correction come on church that word by inspiration is by breath y'all know that it's the Greek word breath then God breathed the scriptures out and in them are pregnated with the same power of the one that wrote the Bible is inside the letters that was put on the Bible this Bible is the letter form of almighty God everything in it he is and everything he did he will do and all that he said he was he is because he's not the I am amen just the I was he is the I am that I am he say preacher what are you what are you really getting at I'll tell you what I'm getting at Malachi the third chapter the Bible said I am God and I change not and and you well that's the Old Testament let me go to the New Testament Hebrews 13 and verse 8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I love that don't you then we finally found something that's not changing we found something that's not altering he is an unchanging God with unchanging ways now the world may change but not God your conditions might change but not God your church can change but not God can I say this the only thing that won't change is there is change coming except for God but that God who don't change he don't change his nature he don't change his aspect but he changes the form that he's in so therefore we know him whether he's in a wind or whether he's in a fire or whether he's in a man or whether he's in his word or whether he's in the stars or whether he's in the flowers we can identify him because he's a God that does not change let me ask you what is it that put the color in the flowers out there it's the same God that put the lift under the Robin's wings so they could fly it's the same God that put the color of hair in your head that you could be here tonight he is the same God for every generation now he is Elohim I don't believe he is just a God that that we've created but we're worshiping the God of this Bible I'm worshiping the god that created the heavens and earth can you imagine the god that hung the the moon in its place and the sun now nobody has ever went out in the morning and seen a big cable hanging off of the sun because it don't hang there by cables it don't hang there by Angels according to Hebrews the first chapter the Bible said he created the heavens and the Earth and they're held there by the word of his power God told the sun were to be and it's there because the word said it would be there if that word could make the sun hold its position how much more could it hold a Believer that's why Jude said we are kept by the power of God unto him that is able to keep us from falling now watch what we're looking and seeing that there is the god who created that's the same God who came down and identif ified himself to Abraham do y'all know that when God identified himself to Abraham he identified him as that Creator and he came down now that's a that's a very big word and I won't preach on it tonight but he came down how far did he come down anyhow did he come down just to angelics because God's above that but he didn't God came below angels and blew himself a dust body and he didn't just get into a young man he got into an older man who gravity was already working on that was dust on his clothes come on now he was God he could have stayed as high as he wanted to but he come down to an older man he come down to dust on his clothes he come down to the heat of the day and he set in the tent door of a man who was a vagabond cast out of the world because God can condens send it's his nature well let me say this the Bible said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with a voice and with a trump let me ask you how far could God come down the god you Ser how far can he come down can he just come down to a prophet can he come down just to Jeffersonville can he come down just to a group can he come down just to your family no I believe God can infold himself and get in the youngest child he can get in the widow woman he can get in the daddy can get in the mama and he's the kind of God that don't change no matter where you put him I don't know some people they serve a little bitty God Amen because they think that God's too busy to hear their prayers I don't serve that kind of God I don't worship that the God I serve is so big he can individualize every person in this building and he can give you a personal interview in the middle of a meeting he can speak to everybody in this building at the same time and just be talking to you he's not limited on space or time he's a great big God he's the god that created the heavens and the Earth that was the same God that Abraham met that made him the promise is the same God that met Moses in that bush and actually introduced himself as Abraham's God now Moses tells about the whole story in Genesis and he tells in Genesis 18 the story of the one that met him and the the bush he tells of the story of how he was Abraham's God now if somebody tells you a story they heard it from somebody and let me assure you Moses hadn't talked to Abraham so Moses's account of what happened to Abraham was given to him by the god that met Abraham and he had a perfect account of how God would visit a generation and that God that met Abraham gave him a child in his own age it caused his wife who was Barren to have a child that was the same God that made Moses and said I'll deliver my children with a mighty hand now you you you we don't have time to go in the depths of this but I'll say this God is a God who is Supernatural and that is the characteristic of God he's Supernatural so you know if you're if you're out in the west and you're elk hunting and you see a mu deer how do you know the difference well there's some characteristics right and if you wasn't real knowing you might think that mule de is a white tail but watch it run off that dude if you ain't never seen it's a funny looking thing they hop on Fall fourest amen if they take off they don't look like no white tail there's a characteristic that shows you what you're dealing with and when you're dealing with the God of this Bible there is a characteristic he carries it is the characteristic of the Supernatural and God had told Moses I'm going to deliver these people amen so when God sent Moses down there Moses is just a man but God shows up in the Supernatural to show them I sent this man down here now if you're a study of scripture you know that God called Israel his first born and that Egypt had the firstborn and they gave the power over Egypt to their plaguing Gods you know they had the god of the Nile and they had the god of f had fertility and they if you're study I don't have time to deep into these things but I'll just take you this Egypt had 10 major deities and they worshiped them major deities and you'll find out when God came down there he executed judgment upon the Bible said the gods of Egypt so every plague if you study every plague that God gave there in in Egypt was a plague over one of the deities of Egypt whom they worshiped God exercised power over the Nile and turned it into blood to prove to to them that this God of the Nile is a perversion of the creator of heavens and earth you see what he done he took power and showed I'm the one that created the Frog I'm the one that created the hells I'm the one that can rain fire I'm the one that can cause Locust to come now God showed power over one every one of those deities I love how the Bible tells us that when God got ready for the children of Israel to go can you imagine two million of them's going to leave at one time you know what they were going to leave so fast that Moses told them when you make the bread for the supper the Passover supper don't put any leav in the bread cuz you ain't going to stay long enough for it to rise Hallelujah can you imagine amen you've been 400 years AB bond in Egypt and the man of God says y'all cook supper tonight but leave the leaven out of the bread cuz you ain't going to be here long enough for it to R come on Church y'all know that's Jesus right you know he wasn't going to stay in the Tomb 72 hours he was going to rise before corruption could ever set in it was the showing of the Resurrection in Ty because Jesus is the same God well it's the truth look what he did I love how he said it to him he said when you eat this food he said do it with a staff in your hand amen put your clothes on put your shoes on you're going to eat this message with your shoes on Amen I think it's time to put your shoes on because somebody's going to leave here pretty soon you know what my Bible says it said when they left there they didn't leave nobody behind do you know it said there was not a feeble one among them some of the some of the New Testament or some of the new new age you know theologian they'll say well it's because they left the the feeble behind you know they meant there was no feeble among them they left the feeble behind but that's not what happened because God gave an entire conversation between Moses and Pharaoh about Moses and pharaoh and Pharaoh keeps saying to Moses well you can just take the cattle and go or you can just take just leave your young people and go and after a while there's an entire conversation where Moses said to Pharaoh we're not leaving a hoof behind they didn't leave a young person behind they didn't leave any Elders behind they didn't leave any sick people behind because what they were eating was a bread that could heal the body I tell you tonight there's a bride eating a message amen that it'll take our young people home it'll take our elders home and we're not going to have one left behind because God don't have to leave nobody behind he is a god of Miracles look that same God that they were serving that same God that went with them I I'll tell you what I I don't have a I don't I don't have the time to dig deep into these things but I just want to brush over them but I'll tell you this amen there is 83 miracles in the Old Testament and that's just that's just uh exposed Miracles right out in the open 83 Miracles there is another 80 found in the New Testament we're talking about over 160 Miracles spanning the entire Bible amen and there are people today who don't believe in miracles amen I say this if you don't believe in miracles you just don't believe your Bible now now you know we're in a season now we're in a season now amen when we look around and we see how things are but when these people were following Moses the Bible tells tells us that there they didn't have sick people among them it tells us that their clothes didn't wear out it tells us when they got hungry now now some of you masas are feeding four and five and some of you feed seven some of you feed a couple what happens when you have about 10 or 12 people show up for supper unannounced amen you feel the pressure of not having enough right Moses had two million people on the move he didn't have where he could build fields and just and take the Harvesters and and they were they were actually on the Move amen so he had two million people it's one thing to call people out it's another thing to feed them once they're out and he calls them out and here they are walking you know they got into a place they got hungry for meat y'all know that but the Bible says when they did God actually told them now the same God that delivered them come in the Book of Numbers the 19th 11th chapter and it says here amen that God who who give us flesh to eat he said for it was well with us in Egypt therefore the Lord give us flesh to eat and you shall not eat one day God said I'm going to give you not for two days or not for five days or not for 10 days or not for 20 I'll give you a whole month's worth and I'll give you so much Quail until it comes out your nostrils now you know where that's saying he's got money running out of his nose he got Quail out of his no that's scripture amen they had Quail running out their nose because God was a God who created Quail now it was a month's worth now if you if you're just just take just a moment I want you to see the abundance we serving the same God the abundance that was given according to numbers 11:31 the Bible said it was a wind went forth from the Lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the campers it was a day Journey on this side and it was a Day's Journey on the other side and around about the camp were two cubits High to the face of the Earth amen now watch this the least one among them gathered 10 rers about 55 bushels now what now what's a Day's Journey now of course according to how fit you are I guess but I looked at cost of maybe maybe it's 15 miles one way you're talking about a 30 mile circumference of the center of that camp and you're talking about three foot deep now look folks I know know that there's such a thing of abundance but this was abundant above what they could think or even ask they you you recognize this that was 600,000 fighting men do y'all know that amen and they were 33,000 bushels of quail that was taken up it would take it would take them amen I I I I I I it's it's crazy but there was 200 I got a couple phds I guess they're pretty smart guys and I put a test to them how many this many miles wide this deep and how many quails will fill a certain spot and you know what they come back with 250 billion Quail B with a billion there was 250 billion Quail you know what my Bible tells me it tells me that's a lot amen you you you know now watch 250 billion Quail they were stacked up three foot deep man now you're talking about a God who can create quail and he can bring It Forward under the people until it was so deep until there was so many that they didn't even know what to do with it because he's that kind of a god you you see they got thirsty and and and and they needed water they're in the middle of a desert what are you get water in the desert you don't unless you're with the God who created the desert and when they looked in all of the ponds and they looked in the streams they couldn't find any but if you're a Bible reader you know the Bible said in Corinthians that Paul said that Jesus was The Rock in the wilderness and he followed them wheresoever they went I tell you what can you imagine they're walking across the desert and oh hey man hey and and oh oh Aaron looks over at Moses he said hey we've been walking for about 3 days and I could swear that's that same rock that was there three days ago how did that thing get over here where we are the Bible said that rock follow them in the wilderness wherever they went you said well that's amazing let me tell you one better than that Jesus said yet a little while and the world see me no more but you shall be me I will be with you even in you until the the End of the Age listen he is right inside of the Church of the Living God where we going to get water around here amen we'll get it right out of that rock God told Moses go take your your staff and smite that rock the driest thing in the entire desert that might not mean much to Son but it did to me the prophet of God said that rock was about the size of a desk amen now some people draw that there was a little dribble coming out of that rock but that's not at all true do you recognize that there were over two million people now if you start counting this you recognize it would take 1.2 million gallons a day to give water to people if they just had 64 ounces can you imagine now 64 ounces a day walking in the desert it would take 1.2 million gallons a day just for the people what about the 10 to 30 gallons a day for the cows amen what about the Sheep amen what about amen the camels who could drink five gallons a day we're talking about they had a need of abundance to come out of that rock they needed an average of 96 million gallons of water a day just to survive with humans and their livestock you amen come on Church we're talking about coming out of a death siiz Rock we're talking about a gusher that looked like Old Faithful out there amen it was a great gusher of God that was coming out of that rock because he was a god of Miracles now listen I I I'm I'm just that guy I got to think about things and I think about this water coming out Benji I'm thinking that that water didn't go out 10 feet and run down in the sand I'm I'm I imagine there was a river come out of there and you know what there was Arabs down in that desert and there were people that didn't even know Abraham at all and they were down there watering their cattle and maybe they were Ming rain dances or whatever thing they were doing but the reason they had water is because amen Moses was in The Country Church I hope you're hearing me the reason there's a move of God the reason the Pentecostals are feeling the spirit the reason inspiration songs are written it's because there's water from the rock for God's children in this age there's been an opening of Seven Seals I know there's people don't even like contemporary music they think if it was a new song written or something from the devil waen would it ever would it ever imagine to people that there's some songs can't be written at some times if you're a Bible reader the first song that was ever written in the Bible was a song Moses sang at the Red Sea when it parted and he sang a song about a sea opening and about an army being drowned because it was the first and actually composers believe it was the first song ever written in history somebody wrote a new song at some time and when John saw the Lamb's Book opened up he wrote a new song Come On Church there's a lot of people that's in the Lamb's Book of Life but not very many people know they're in the Lamb's Book of Life but we're living in an age where the message of God has opened up this message and songs are being sung today that could have never been sung another time in the history of the world now I get it some of the music they play I don't agree with it either amen but there's some there's some words that's being written under inspiration that don't belong to them to start with just CU they pick it up don't mean it belongs to them I can prove to you amen that the grafted bre is living off of the life of the original tree it was a gusher from The Rock Amen what was it because God Amen is a god of Miracles look at this one brother brandom tells us about how amen that he created a squirrel I want you to think about the beauty of this brother BR said I was out squirrel hunting now we would think the only time that great miracles happen is in the church but that's not the God we serve God does miracles in church but many of the Great Miracles are not even done in church they're done in them fellowship with God in even your private places brother randam tells us a story here how he was out squirrel hunting and while he was out squirrel hunting he was sitting next to an old sycamore tree and he was thinking about the scripture of Mark 11 of how it is that God could say a man if he would say unto a mountain it could be moved and he said while I was thinking on it it was there for the first time he declared to me the new ministry think on him draw nigh unto me and I will draw nigh unto you think upon him watch this in Mark 11 that's the scripture isn't the scripture but scripture is written for a generation y'all believe that somebody said well I tell you what everything was done in Abraham's today it's not true do you know that God promised Abraham the land but according to acts the 7th chapter Abraham never possessed that land you can read it right of the Bible he said Abraham never possessed a foot of that land but God promised it to Abraham but it wasn't until Joshua that they actually possessed the land that God had gave promised so God will promise to one generation what he's going to do in another generation I can prove it by the Bible come on Corinthians amen you he said that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God but there will come a time that this Mortal shall put on immortality and this corruption shall put on incorruption he's talking about a body change the corini did not take the body change but Paul promised it to one age but God's going to give it to another [Applause] age see God of Miracles is not in our past it's right here in our future and as long as there is scriptures that give the god of Miracles right here tonight do you see what he was saying he was saying if thou say us Jesus said them words but not one place in all of the Sacred Scriptures was that ever fulfilled there was no disciple ever spoke the word and created in his day Jesus himself actually stood and took fish and multiplied it he took bread and multiplied it he never one time created as he did in the beginning but he prophesied that the power of the blood come on Church Jesus said in John 14 he said the works that I do shall ye do also he said because I go unto the father come on there wasn't two of them up there but Jesus was the last man Adam that gave his life for the church look and when God came into a man and a man was sacrificed for the church now brother brother Bryce a man like you and I our race climb to the throne of God and sets in power tonight come on folks we are not without power as long as Jesus Christ is our God he sets in the power tonight and all things are possible to him and all things are of him look when he says that it would be able to create now somebody said well what's that got to do with the cross got everything to do with the cross because of the Cross there was a giving of the power of the blood that would bring an atonement back until God could actually get in man and use him how it happened the first time is when he was sitting there he had scripture in his mind he said I I had scripture in my mind I was thinking now preacher you said what are you doing I'm teaching you how to have a miracle yes I'm teaching you how spoken word comes to a believer I'm teaching you how healing comes how the Holy Ghost comes how Deliverance comes he took a scripture and was dwelling on the scripture and something struck him inspiration came to him amen what was it it was that's what the atonement was for that's what the atonement was for listen Adam had those things in the Garden of Eden didn't he come on you know he did before the fall Adam had them things in the garden but sister Anna when Adam had him he didn't have any complexes he didn't have any fear he didn't have any failure that was no sin to overcome there was no leosa there was no God of this evil age it was all perfect in the garden and he exercised these things in a place of perfection but when God called you to operate the miracle work power of God he called you to do it in this age of leosia and here you are tonight with your complexes but God says I'm I'm a miracle working God you got your fears but he says I'm a miracle working God you got all of these reasons why that God can't move but God is a miracle working God is the same yesterday today and forever for I say unto you you that whosoever shall say un this mountain be moved and cast in the sea shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which shall come to pass he shall have it whatsoever he saith you say preacher what are you talking about when God did this he opened it up for manifestation when God performed this he opened it up to every believer that's setting in this building tonight can I get this clear to you I do not believe that every believer in here has to speak this word nor create squirrels nor do I believe amen that every one of you will but I am very contentious in the fact that the potential to do so is in every believer in this building from the youngest to the oldest from the weakest to the strongest the power of the blood restored us back to the power of the word of God that lives in humanity God did this for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons begin to speak the word of God Amen the word is backed by the power of God this is for the day of manifestations I know the church has buil hospitals and I know the church has built churches and that is good for the ages but it won't do for the manifestation of the sons of God the whole creation granth for the manifestation of the sons of God this is not just another day this is the day of the opening of the power of God that is restored back to mankind may I say this beloved we are now the sons of God we're not going to be right now we are the sons of God beloved we're the sons of God look at what a brother bam tells us this he told us these things that these scriptures teach us the Reason God is opening these things is to bring his son his his sons into manifestation do you know it's been prophesied over to you I believe a real church is on the road the power of the Living God that men will speak the word here and there and it will flash like lightning there is a church coming out not a psychologist not a put on not a make belief but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out church I don't believe it's on the road tonight I believe it's here I believe believe we have come to the ending of the ages listen somebody said well brother Wayne I believe there's coming a short powerful work there's coming a great Revival there's coming this there's coming this listen and at the same time you're saying that Russia could blow us up in the morning then you tell me when are you going to give time for the manifestation of the sons of God and who is it that's going to be good enough to do it I say we are the people that God has called to this age for manifestation of word and I believe this is the time if you're looking at yourself it ain't going to work but if you're looking at the blood if you're looking at the message you say preacher how is this going to happen I'll tell you what a prophet of God said he said when the human element goes out when the human element goes out now now folks they ain't nobody in this building more aware of human ity than I am I am very aware you're a human I'm very aware I'm a human there is a law of sin and death but there's also a law of life and when the human element goes out you're divided in two parts you believe Jesus was all God do you believe it was all man then there had to be a union between God and man that would allow him to be all God and all man at the same time it's called a hypostatic a hypostatic logos which is a which is a covenant between two beings that they can come together and remain the same there amen they had to invent a word nobody had a word but there's a word developed for you and I that God could develop and come together with a man and you remain a man you cry like a man you feel like a man you got fear like a man but only the inside of that man as a God as a god of Miracles as a God that can create age there's a God that can bring life because God rich in Mercy has brought power into the age that we're living in oh the prophet of God said this about you he said there will come a time that your thoughts will become your words and your words will become Miracles that's when the church will move in his power there will come a time when God will go forth in the power of His deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the holy Spirit bringing to pass the thoughts of their minds hallelujah hallelujah oh it's going to take some Faith it's going to take more faith than any other hour it's going to take Faith to get above your Humanity it's going to take Faith to get above your troubles it's going to take Faith to get above your sins but if the word of God says it there's somebody going to believe it and God's going to manifest it through somebody let me give you let me give you some prophecy over the church there shall come to pass in the last days and I believe we're um approaching the hour now when missing limbs will be restored by the power of the Creator how many of y'all know why brother Bram said that he said that because he had just told the testimony of in the back room there was a boy with leukemia and brother Bram prayed for him and God healed him of Leukemia and brother Bram said the only that could be a healing of leukemia is God had to recreate the blood cell and cause the blood cell to be new in the body and the leukemia was pushed out and New Life came in well if God can recreate the blood cell don't you know he can activate the DNA that grows your first arm that grows your first leg and God can add limbs back if he can heal leukemia he can heal a lame body the BL come on Church the blind can see the death can hear the dumb can speak the dead can raise he is the same yesterday today and forever I said well I tell you what that might have happened back in brother bram's day well that's just updated could we I was preaching a meeting over there in Norway a few years ago and I was preaching on a on a I believe it was a Saturday night and I was preaching on the Seven Stars of Revelations the first chapter if you ain't never read it it's under the angel of Ephesus all the way to the angel a to you look up the word angel in the Greek it's called Angelos and it means messenger it's not a deity it's a human being and they were men sent from God who got messages now I'm moving fast I know but in Revelations the 10th chapter the Bible said that the in the days of the voice of that seventh one the Lan messenger in his day that the mysteries of the seven Thunders which were hid from the time of Daniel would be unveiled in that generation and what would it do but remove the symbols that was on the book when it was written so when you read the book of Ephesians you read it the way God would have originally written it my goodness time's getting away but I it won't matter it it won't mean nothing if we don't say this God thought something originally he had a thought when he revealed it to John he gave it in a symbol and John wrote it in symbol form now watch when John recorded it he said unto the angel of to seea he didn't give a name he didn't give a time he just gave an age a condition and it would be a messenger right so he was leaving symbols that's why he said White Horse and black horse and red horse and the and the dragon it was all symbology but listen what God was doing do y'all know that God has the cannon of scriptures written and no man can add anything to that Canon of scriptures so if God wanted the end time bride to get a book in the Bible how could he do it unless he would cause John to write it and he would write it in symbol form and it would go through the hands of the ages and every reformer and they would read it but they wouldn't know what it was but in the age of the seventh angel he would come from God as a Divine interpreter of the word of God and he would tell the symbols of this Bible to open up the power of the reality of God that man could come back to this true Miracle working God that's why he said unto the angel of the Le DEA that's why tonight when we look at angel under Ephesus we can say under Paul because we know the symbol has been removed we know what God was saying because it's our book it's our letter we had the keys to the answers and the seventh angel when I was preaching there in in in in Norway and I was preaching under them angels and I got down and I preached under I got all the way to amen down there to Martin and I was down there to Martin Luther and I got to John Wesley amen but you know nobody cares if you talk about Martin Luther because he's a world-renowned scholar in Germany and all the people in England they love John Wesley and they got shrines built to him but the minute you say that seven star was a man named William brandom every devil Out of Hell crawls out amen you listen to the age we're living in do you know people don't care if you quote Oh cigar smoking amen you you you quote woodro Wilson I hear preachers all the time quoting Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and they quote some uh Steven Hawkins and they quote this guy and they quote this guy but if you quote Willam brandom every devil in hell falls apart but you want to know why because there is something that has been released under that Ministry that is the casting out of the devil and it's the setting of power of the Bride of Jesus Christ something's lifting us back to the mind of God what he thought of in the beginning Jordan and I was standing there and I said and unto the angel the seventh angel is a man named William brandom there was a woman sitting in the back of my meeting she had she had actually had leukemia I didn't even know this happened brother Bryce a year later I come back to do them same family camp meetings and that little old lady that had been so sick come and found me and she said brother Lawson sat right down I got to tell you she said I come to meetings for almost a year and I remember her very well she had a head scarf from the Kemo and she was sick and everybody was saying she took their excuses to miss meetings cuz she came when she was sick and and she said sit right down here I got to tell you I had leukemia last year in your meeting you remember I said yeah she said remember at night you preached on the Seven Stars I said yeah she said when you said the seven star is a man named William brandom she said there was a warm feeling they hit me in the top of my head and went to the bottom of my feet she said brother Wayne God completely healed me of leukemia because there's healing under the message according to Malachi 4 the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his ways he is the same yesterday today and forever he's the god of Miracles he's the god of power he's my God he's my God he's a god of reality tonight he's not just a god of history or an ancient god he's a real God he's right here in this building right now oh you said just for brother Bam's days was it what about Veron Hoffman sitting in one of our meetings over mon Ridge and looks up and skin cancer just piles off and falls in the floor because God was in that meeting I told that testimony and Sam kener in in August years ago and a man sitting back on about the third row stood up and said brother Lawson while you were telling that testimony the cancer on my chest and completely has went away because the same God he's not I was he's an I am God he's right here tonight the same yesterday somebody said well that was years ago let me tell the other day in our church up in Ohio sister Barb kovi sits on the second row she sits right about where you are and she said well I don't know if this is a big deal but I got to testify to the people I'm sitting here with a cancer on my arm they were going to take off next week and she said I was rubbing it in the middle of song service and it just fell off in my hand listen it don't have to be a special preacher it can be in the middle of song service it can be while you're squirrel hunting it can be while you're doing your dishes it can be why you're doing you're washing or you're sweeping your Thors God is the everpresent one that can come in your midst he's not a million miles away he's right here in this building tonight you say oh brother Wayne I don't know let me say tonight I believe this I believe and a prophet of God said every person could work a miracle you say how do I do it let me tell you how to work a miracle tonight this is how you work a miracle when God came to Mary and said you're going to have a child you know what she did she said be it unto me according to Thy word she didn't have a pregnancy test she had no doctors she had nobody to confirm to her that it was the truth but she believed the angel was quoting the word and the word began to cause creation on the inside of her and she begin to testify and she begin to praise God because he was a supernatural God I don't know maybe you come in here with a sickness tonight and you're sitting there saying well I don't know I don't know listen if you just take the word of God and begin to thank God right now let me quote the prophet he said sometimes people come up and get prayer and they got a bad hand he said and when they don't see healing in the hand he said they go away discouraged he said but we're not wanting healing in the hand we're not healing healing in the we're not looking for healing in the back we're looking for healing in the spirit to believe the Covenant that God has given and if Faith could drop in limbs could be added if Faith drops in blinds will see lame will walk brother Wayne I don't know about these things well I do I got a mama sitting right back there that's had three strokes and she don't have one effect of any of them Strokes you said well I'll tell you what it was just this and it was just this you can say whatever you want to say it was but I remember when I got the phone call and I remember talking
