[41:47] while you're standing with us we want to
[41:48] turn in the Book of Romans the 10th
[41:50] chapter and then we have a couple of
[41:52] places also we would like to read but we
[41:54] want to say God bless you all this
[41:56] morning morning we greet you in the name
[41:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ we bring the
[41:59] greetings from our pastor in the church
[42:00] there at home brother Sean Martin sends
[42:02] their greetings to you this morning and
[42:05] amen just a wonderful time to serve the
[42:06] Lord amen amen I believe I could ask you
[42:09] this morning if you've been fighting the
[42:11] devil and I guarantee everybody in here
[42:13] could say yes amen but one thing I like
[42:15] about it brother Joe we're not just
[42:17] fighting the devil but we're winning
[42:19] amen so we thank the Lord for the
[42:21] victory today and sure want to say we
[42:23] appreciate brother Matt the opportunity
[42:24] once again to be here and to stand in
[42:26] the pull pit and we just pray something
[42:28] will be said to bless you and help you
[42:29] today but we want to look here in Romans
[42:31] the 10th chapter and in the 17th verse
[42:35] um just one scripture here and then
[42:36] we're going to turn to the Book of Luke
[42:38] but Romans 10 and verse 17 Paul here
[42:41] writing says so then Faith cometh by
[42:45] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[42:49] now I've been speaking a little bit on
[42:50] this for some time but I did find a very
[42:53] powerful thing that brother Bram tells
[42:54] about this here he he says hearing by
[42:57] the word of God he said or the word made
[43:00] manifest so we're not just hearing the
[43:02] word but we're actually hearing the
[43:04] manifested word and our faith is coming
[43:06] from hearing the word of God made
[43:08] manifest now in the book of St Luke the
[43:11] first chapter the book of St Luke the
[43:13] first chapter and I want to look there
[43:16] in the 26th verse I know this is a very
[43:19] familiar reading to you it's quite
[43:20] lengthy but I just want to if I can to
[43:23] rehearse to you the conversation between
[43:25] a between the Angel and Mary in Luke 1
[43:28] and verse 26 the Bible said in the sixth
[43:31] month the angel Gabriel was sent from
[43:33] God unto a city of Galilee named
[43:36] Nazareth now I want you to specifically
[43:38] note this Angel was sent from God unto a
[43:42] city in the 27th verse to a virgin
[43:45] espouse to a man whose name was Joseph
[43:47] of the House of David and the virgin's
[43:49] name was Mary and the angel came into
[43:52] her and said hell Thou Art highly
[43:54] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[43:57] art thou among women and when she saw
[44:00] him she was troubled at his saying and
[44:02] cast in her mind what manner of
[44:05] salutation this should be now watch this
[44:08] and the angel said unto her fear not
[44:10] Mary for thou Hast found favor with God
[44:15] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[44:16] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[44:19] call his name Jesus and he shall be
[44:21] great and shall be called the son of the
[44:23] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[44:25] him the Throne of his father David and
[44:28] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[44:30] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[44:32] be no end so he's given some very
[44:34] specific details concerning this
[44:36] prophecy and in the 34th verse he said
[44:40] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[44:42] this be seeing I know not a man so
[44:45] there's a great mystery how shall this
[44:47] be seeing I know not a man but the angel
[44:49] answered and said unto her the Holy
[44:51] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[44:54] of the highest shall overshadow Shadow
[44:56] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[44:58] which shall be born of thee shall be
[44:59] called The Son of God and behold thy
[45:02] cousin Elizabeth sheath also conceived a
[45:04] son in her old age and this is the sixth
[45:07] month with her who was called Baron for
[45:09] with God nothing shall be impossible and
[45:13] Mary said behold the handmade of the
[45:15] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[45:19] and the angel departed from her now I
[45:22] also want to look at one other place and
[45:23] that's in the book of Acts the 2 7th
[45:26] chapter the book of Acts the 27th
[45:29] chapter and here in Acts 27 Paul is
[45:33] speaking of the vision that's been given
[45:35] to him concerning the future and he says
[45:38] there in Acts
[45:39] 27 and verse number
[45:42] 25 he says wherefore s be of good cheer
[45:47] for I believe God how many can put your
[45:49] name there and say I believe God for I
[45:52] believe God now this is what I love that
[45:55] it shall be even as it was told me it
[45:58] shall be even as it was told me we ask
[46:01] the Lord this morning to add the
[46:02] blessing to the reading of his word as
[46:04] you can have your seats here this
[46:06] morning amen I want to by the help of
[46:08] the Lord from those scriptures for just
[46:10] a few moments if I could to speak to you
[46:12] here I want to speak to you on Faith's
[46:14] power to believe amen Faith's power to
[46:17] believe and maybe uh just to take
[46:19] something out of that it shall be even
[46:22] as it was told me amen it shall be even
[46:25] as it was told told me 1958 brother BR
[46:27] preaches a message have faith in God and
[46:29] he refers to acts the first chapter in
[46:31] the 8th verse and he says now remember
[46:34] you shall receive power after the Holy
[46:36] Ghost has come upon you not before or
[46:39] when you get your PhD or whatever but
[46:41] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[46:44] then you'll have power of Faith to
[46:46] believe amen after the Holy Ghost has
[46:49] come upon you then you will have the
[46:51] power of Faith to believe now in Romans
[46:54] 10 and verse1 17 from the the Amplified
[46:56] Bible it says so faith comes from
[46:59] hearing what is told and what is heard
[47:02] comes by the preaching of the message
[47:04] concerning Christ amen faith comes from
[47:06] hearing what is told and what is heard
[47:09] comes by the preaching of the message
[47:11] concerning Christ and I believe we can
[47:13] all say this morning that we
[47:15] emphatically believe that this message
[47:17] is Jesus Christ we don't believe it's
[47:19] about a man or about a church or about
[47:21] anything outside amen of the Lord Jesus
[47:24] Christ again acts 27:25 in the Amplified
[47:28] Bible it says so keep up your courage
[47:30] men for I believe God and have complete
[47:34] confidence in him that it will turn out
[47:36] exactly as I have been told amen I
[47:39] believe God and have complete confidence
[47:42] in him amen that it will turn out
[47:44] exactly as I have been told amen I
[47:47] believe this morning that we are
[47:48] believers here and I believe that we can
[47:51] say I believe God and I have complete
[47:53] confidence amen that whatever has been
[47:56] told me is going to turn out amen
[47:58] exactly the way it has been told in the
[48:01] message it shall be even as it was told
[48:03] me 1950 he said oh don't you just love
[48:06] that it'll be as it was told me if the
[48:09] angel truly comes from God and is sent
[48:12] from God it's bound to be it's a direct
[48:15] message from Glory if the angel comes
[48:18] from God and speaks anything from God it
[48:21] will be exactly the way it was spoken
[48:23] it's bound to be that way if it came
[48:26] from God another place in Jehovah of
[48:28] Miracles she looked speaking of Mary she
[48:31] looked at this great Angel and his name
[48:32] is Gabriel now there's angels of the
[48:35] Lord there's many of them and they come
[48:36] to the Earth amen and they bring
[48:38] messages but Gabriel when he comes amen
[48:41] there is something major going to happen
[48:43] see he was the one who announced the
[48:45] first coming of Christ he'll be the one
[48:47] that'll announce the second coming of
[48:49] Christ amen I love how brother BR says
[48:51] this and he told
[48:53] Mary Gabriel told told Mary that thou H
[48:57] has found favor with God he said now
[48:59] what a message to bring her thou H has
[49:02] found favor with God so he was not just
[49:04] bringing her amen some words or
[49:06] something that he thought she might like
[49:08] to hear but he was bringing her a
[49:10] message amen and it was coming from
[49:13] heaven so that was making it a Heavenly
[49:15] message and it was a vision concerning
[49:17] her life amen so it was making it a
[49:20] heavenly vision and it was an
[49:21] announcement to her Mary thou Hast found
[49:24] favor with God now we believe in this
[49:26] generation that God Amen has sent a
[49:28] prophet among the church and he has come
[49:30] here amen not of his own accord or on
[49:33] the Accord of the Pope or on the Accord
[49:35] of the bishop amen but he said it like
[49:37] this he said I have no power within
[49:39] myself to do anything amen I'm just a
[49:41] man I'm unlearned I'm uneducated amen
[49:44] but I am sure that my testimony is Right
[49:47] amen that truly a supernatural being
[49:50] came to me and made these statements and
[49:52] I have not been disobedient Amen to the
[49:55] heavenly vision so here's a prophet
[49:57] saying amen that just as there was a
[50:00] Heavenly being came to Mary and gave her
[50:02] a message and announced to her amen and
[50:05] there was a messenger came to Paul and
[50:07] told Paul amen by way of vision you're
[50:09] going to be Shipwrecked and you're going
[50:10] to go through troubles amen but Paul
[50:12] you're going to stand on the other side
[50:15] amen that same angel that same
[50:17] supernatural being amen came to a
[50:19] prophet in this generation and said now
[50:21] if you can just get the people to
[50:23] believe you amen nothing will stand
[50:25] before your prayer amen I don't know
[50:27] about you this morning but I say thank
[50:29] God Amen that we have received a message
[50:33] amen not from a natural God Amen but
[50:35] from a supernatural God and I can say
[50:38] this morning that we are believers Amen
[50:40] in the Supernatural how many Believers
[50:42] here do I have Amen in the Supernatural
[50:45] now that word Supernatural is of or
[50:47] relating to an order of existence beyond
[50:50] the visible amen observable universe it
[50:53] is departing from what is usual or
[50:56] normal amen especially so as to peer
[50:59] Amen to transcend the laws of nature it
[51:02] is attributed to an invisible agent amen
[51:05] such as a ghost or a spirit amen now you
[51:08] read your Bible and see that the Holy
[51:10] Ghost is referred to amen as the Holy
[51:13] Ghost as well as the holy spirit amen so
[51:16] I believe that he is God's invisible
[51:18] agent amen that is in the church that is
[51:21] among the people amen and he's doing
[51:23] things beyond the nature he's doing
[51:26] things beyond the ideas of trinitarian
[51:28] Doctrine doing things beyond the ideas
[51:30] of denomination amen he's come Among Us
[51:33] declaring himself Amen in the
[51:36] Supernatural brother said the Mighty Man
[51:38] of Valor could refer back to the old
[51:40] word and know that it's right amen
[51:43] because he know this that God is a
[51:45] supernatural being how many believes
[51:47] that amen and wherever a supernatural
[51:49] being is amen he will do Supernatural
[51:52] signs because the Supernatural is in him
[51:56] amen wherever a supernatural being is
[51:59] amen he will do Supernatural signs amen
[52:02] because the Supernatural is in him you
[52:05] just can't get out of it how can you
[52:07] stand in the face of wind without having
[52:09] wind blow it how can you get in water
[52:11] without being wet water's wet that's the
[52:13] chemical of it it's wet and when you get
[52:15] in water you're going to get wet right
[52:17] and when you get in the presence of God
[52:20] the supernatural there's going to be
[52:22] Supernatural signs amen and Supernatural
[52:25] workings of Amen a supernatural God Amen
[52:28] don't you let the devil reduce your
[52:30] services down Amen to just Wednesday
[52:33] nights and Sunday mornings and a few
[52:35] songs and a few quotes and a few
[52:37] scriptures amen no there's more to this
[52:39] amen amen this is a manifestation of the
[52:42] supernatural God that has come into this
[52:44] generation to declare amen that there's
[52:47] a power in you amen and it's a power
[52:49] beyond any other power it's a power
[52:51] beyond your education it's a power
[52:53] beyond your family's ability it's a
[52:56] power beyond your past it's a power
[52:58] beyond your present amen can I say where
[53:00] this power is coming from it is coming
[53:02] from the spirit of Truth who has already
[53:04] been in your future let me say it to you
[53:07] Church you're not a natural Church Grace
[53:09] Tabernacle you are a supernatural church
[53:12] because there's a supernatural being
[53:14] that has come into your midst and you
[53:16] didn't push him off in the corner amen
[53:18] but you recognize that that's the god of
[53:20] Abraham that's the god of Jacob that's
[53:22] the god of Israel and that's my God if
[53:25] he is my God then what he did through
[53:27] them he will do through me everywhere
[53:30] God is the supernatural takes place
[53:32] because he is Supernatural and then I'll
[53:35] say this if he's a supernatural God then
[53:38] he has a supernatural seed and the
[53:40] prophet said these great Heroes died he
[53:42] said there's one thing they had to die
[53:44] amen because they were natural seed amen
[53:47] so natural seed has to die he said oh
[53:50] but one day there come a supernatural
[53:52] seed which was born by a super natural
[53:55] birth amen the same Faith born not by
[53:58] the natural birth but by the
[54:00] supernatural Birth by the supernatural
[54:02] Faith which Abraham had amen not
[54:05] according to the sexual desire of
[54:07] Abraham and what God did to him that way
[54:10] amen but through a supernatural Faith
[54:12] amen that he had amen if we're serving a
[54:15] supernatural God it's going to take more
[54:18] than natural Faith Amen to believe the
[54:20] things he spoken he is able to bring to
[54:23] pass amen but if he's a Supernatural God
[54:26] then he's released a supernatural faith
[54:28] and the prophet said the supernatural
[54:30] faith is Supernatural amen and it does
[54:33] Supernatural things amen let me say this
[54:35] you may not agree with me but I'm going
[54:37] to say it anyhow amen just you being
[54:39] here this morning is Supernatural amen
[54:42] just you having a desire Amen to believe
[54:44] the word that God has revealed in this
[54:46] age amen that's more than just luck
[54:49] that's more than just a chance amen
[54:51] that's a supernatural thing amen that
[54:54] God loved you enough that he brought you
[54:55] out of the natural birth and prepared a
[54:58] supernatural birth to break the bars of
[55:00] humanity over your life that you could
[55:02] receive a supernatural message amen the
[55:05] prophet said Abraham's Faith as he was
[55:07] here hundreds of years later amen come
[55:10] the supernatural seed that he believed
[55:12] in and when this Supernatural seed come
[55:15] on the earth he done the supernatural
[55:17] sign of a supernatural prophet he was
[55:20] greater than a prophet amen he was a god
[55:23] Prophet Amen to give a n natural people
[55:25] a supernatural birth is this okay he was
[55:28] a god Prophet to give the natural people
[55:31] a supernatural birth what did he do he
[55:34] went before us amen and he died but they
[55:36] couldn't hold him amen Abraham's grave
[55:39] is still there Isaac's grave is still
[55:41] there but there's an empty tomb Amen on
[55:44] the supernatural seed that done a
[55:46] supernatural work that had a
[55:48] supernatural Resurrection friends this
[55:50] morning recognize amen there's nothing
[55:53] that you go through amen can hold told
[55:55] you you know why because there's a
[55:57] supernatural god with a supernatural
[55:59] word with a supernatural Faith with a
[56:02] supernatural seed that has moved inside
[56:04] of you and has made you a super sign to
[56:07] this generation then that's why ever
[56:09] grave the devil tried to bury you in
[56:11] you're alive this morning amen because
[56:13] you are a part of a supernatural
[56:16] resurrection and if God be for you then
[56:19] who can be against you brother said what
[56:22] did he do when doing it he conquered
[56:24] death Hell In The Grave I'm going
[56:26] somewhere and possessed its Gates and
[56:27] Rose on the third day in a supernatural
[56:30] Resurrection now here's what he said I
[56:32] have the keys of death and hell I was he
[56:35] who was dead and now I'm alive forever
[56:37] more and because I live the Seed of
[56:40] Abraham shall live also there you are
[56:43] and lo I'm with you always even until
[56:46] the end and the works that I do shall
[56:48] you do also he said now remember Isaiah
[56:51] said it shall be an everlasting sign
[56:54] hereo
[56:55] he said some of you people that don't
[56:56] know about it you think he's a
[56:58] historical God or worshiping something
[57:00] that was way back y a long time ago but
[57:03] that same God Amen raised from the dead
[57:06] as a supernatural sign and after 2,000
[57:09] years is still living right here now and
[57:12] can work miracles like he did when he
[57:14] was here on Earth amen through a
[57:16] supernatural people that has been born
[57:18] to a supernatural spirit with a
[57:20] supernatural Faith amen that the same
[57:23] thing Abraham had am amen the same thing
[57:27] Abraham had so I'll say this morning
[57:29] church that we are the possessors amen
[57:32] of the same Supernatural faith that
[57:35] Abraham had we are the supernatural
[57:37] people we are the possessors of that
[57:40] Faith seed he said then if we are God's
[57:43] children by Heir amen then we're Heirs
[57:45] of the kingdom and we're Heirs of
[57:46] Abraham then we should walk as our
[57:48] Father Abraham walked and we should call
[57:51] those things which are not amen as
[57:53] though they were if God is said they
[57:55] were see if God has said they are then
[57:57] we don't know how it's going to be amen
[58:00] but God said so so we just believe it
[58:03] and move forward amen walking by faith
[58:06] amen what a beautiful life see Abraham a
[58:08] 100 years old yet he had many
[58:11] disappointments he had many upsets like
[58:13] all Christians do amen while he was
[58:15] waiting on the promise but the Bible
[58:17] said he staggered not at the promise of
[58:19] God Amen through unbelief amen there's
[58:22] many things taking place amen famine
[58:24] distress things happen amen but Abraham
[58:27] didn't stagger he still believed that
[58:29] God was going to give him the baby amen
[58:32] then can I ask you where did the faith
[58:34] come from Amen to believe in the face of
[58:37] disappointments in the face of adversity
[58:39] in the face of hard days and bad days
[58:42] amen where was the faith coming from
[58:44] Amen to believe it was coming from the
[58:46] vision amen that was given to him and
[58:49] Abraham didn't put his confidence in the
[58:51] womb of Sarah he didn't put his
[58:53] confidence in the life of his own human
[58:54] ity he put his confidence in that what
[58:57] God has said amen shall be exactly as it
[59:01] was told me listen friends we have
[59:03] received a word amen and it's a word
[59:05] seed and if you don't sew it and let it
[59:07] stay there and let the atmosphere
[59:09] produce the life of it if you keep
[59:11] digging it up every day well I don't
[59:13] know I don't know I don't know brother
[59:15] said if you dig it up every day it's
[59:17] never going to grow he said but put it
[59:19] in the ground amen and leave it in the
[59:21] ground and let the life of the sun and
[59:23] the water bring it to potential he said
[59:26] I say this with a challenge in faith
[59:28] that every promise of God will be
[59:30] brought to pass if you take the right
[59:32] mental attitude towards
[59:35] it is that okay amen you can't go dig up
[59:38] the weed every day and expect weed at
[59:40] Harvest Time you can't go dig up the
[59:42] potatoes every day and expect potatoes
[59:44] at Harvest time are you hearing me amen
[59:47] when the word has been sold you've got
[59:49] to receive the power of Faith Amen to
[59:52] believe the god that sent the word the
[59:54] god that spoke the word the god that
[59:56] revealed the word amen is God enough to
[59:58] bring that word to pass amen and don't
[1:00:01] walk in defeat amen don't walk in
[1:00:03] complexes don't walk in inferiority amen
[1:00:06] but walk as Abraham walked amen and call
[1:00:08] things that are as though they're not
[1:00:10] and things that are not as though they
[1:00:12] are come on church amen you're not a
[1:00:14] natural people you are a supernatural
[1:00:16] people with a supernatural god with a
[1:00:19] supernatural Faith amen and God has sent
[1:00:21] a supernatural Prophet into this
[1:00:23] generation to teach the church amen what
[1:00:26] faith is amen and what Faith's power is
[1:00:28] now you all know these verses by heart
[1:00:30] but Hebrews 11:1 Paul said that faith is
[1:00:33] the substance amen of things hoped for
[1:00:36] it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he
[1:00:38] said for by it the elders obtained a
[1:00:40] good report and through faith we
[1:00:43] understand I'm going somewhere through
[1:00:45] faith we understand amen that the worlds
[1:00:47] were framed by the word of God so the
[1:00:50] things which are seen were not made of
[1:00:52] things which do appear amen now watch a
[1:00:55] prophet what is faith brother says is
[1:00:57] God by the spirit yes sir revealing to
[1:01:00] you something that he's going to do or
[1:01:03] he has promised to do see then you see
[1:01:05] you hear the word and God reveals it to
[1:01:08] you that it is the truth and by Spirit
[1:01:11] revealed truth he confirms your faith to
[1:01:14] God Amen then that's the church that God
[1:01:16] built upon the rock upon the gates amen
[1:01:19] that hail cannot Prevail against it amen
[1:01:22] another place he said face power amen
[1:01:24] brings to pass God's revealed Revelation
[1:01:28] amen so God by the spirit reveals the
[1:01:31] word and you receive the revealed word
[1:01:34] amen then you believe that the God who
[1:01:36] spoke it and revealed it has the ability
[1:01:38] to bring it to pass amen and that
[1:01:40] unlocks the power of Faith Amen to
[1:01:43] believe that God's revealed Revelation
[1:01:46] is going to come into manifestation in
[1:01:48] other words faith is a revelation from
[1:01:51] God brother said where does faith come
[1:01:53] from he he said Revelation comes from
[1:01:55] above he said now people try to figure
[1:01:58] out the godhead they try to figure out
[1:01:59] water baptism he said scratch their head
[1:02:02] and pull their hair out he said don't
[1:02:03] scratch your head and don't pull your
[1:02:05] hair out he said just look up he said
[1:02:08] because Revelation comes from above and
[1:02:10] church this morning I'm going to preach
[1:02:12] on that amen we need to get our head out
[1:02:14] of all our problems get our head out of
[1:02:16] all our situation amen we need to do
[1:02:19] what the Bible said we need to look
[1:02:20] under the heels from which cometh our
[1:02:23] help amen our help comes from God and
[1:02:25] our help is not coming in the form of a
[1:02:27] denomination amen but our help is coming
[1:02:30] in the form of a spiritual Revelation
[1:02:33] because that's the only thing that the
[1:02:35] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the
[1:02:37] Gates of Hell will prevail against your
[1:02:39] feelings they will prevail against your
[1:02:41] emotions they will prevail against the
[1:02:43] gifts they will prevail against
[1:02:45] sensation amen but when Revelation
[1:02:47] stands up and speaks with a voice of
[1:02:49] authority amen then revelation will
[1:02:52] prevail over every devil over every
[1:02:55] situation listen I tell you what we need
[1:02:57] more than anything is a revelation of
[1:02:59] Jesus Christ personally to our lives
[1:03:02] that nothing can shake us from it you
[1:03:04] know what I'm talking about amen and
[1:03:06] that's what faith is it's a revelation
[1:03:08] from God Amen faith is something that's
[1:03:11] revealed to you glory to God Amen that
[1:03:14] is not yet amen but you believe it will
[1:03:18] be faith is something that's revealed to
[1:03:22] you that's not yet but you believe it
[1:03:24] will be see faith is a revelation of the
[1:03:28] will of God now how many can agree it's
[1:03:31] God's will to save you how many can
[1:03:33] agree it's God's will to heal you how
[1:03:35] many can agree it's God's will to
[1:03:37] deliver you three of you can how many of
[1:03:39] you can agree that it's God's will to
[1:03:40] Rapture you how many of you can agree
[1:03:43] it's God's will to give you all things
[1:03:45] amen see that's the word of God Amen now
[1:03:47] you can't just read it amen but
[1:03:49] somewhere that that that reading has got
[1:03:52] to turn to Revelation and you begin to
[1:03:54] walk by Revelation it's God's will to
[1:03:56] save my babies it's God's will to save
[1:03:59] my family it's God's will to heal my
[1:04:01] body it's God's will to take me in a
[1:04:03] Rapture it's God's will to deliver me
[1:04:05] come on Amen when you start living by
[1:04:07] Revelation you'll have a lot better
[1:04:09] Services when you start living by
[1:04:11] Revelation you'll have a lot better
[1:04:13] prayer time amen when you're not down
[1:04:15] there before God as some poor beggarly
[1:04:17] person that's trying to beg God for
[1:04:19] something but your eyes of understanding
[1:04:22] has come open Amen to realize that you
[1:04:24] are in the lineage of Abraham and you
[1:04:27] are air to the same faith that caused
[1:04:29] Abraham to look at things that were and
[1:04:31] call them as though they were not and
[1:04:33] things that were not as though they were
[1:04:35] because of faith is a revelation of the
[1:04:38] will of God another place he said it's a
[1:04:40] revelation see he has revealed it to you
[1:04:43] by his grace he has revealed it to you
[1:04:47] amen by his grace it's nothing you did
[1:04:50] amen I might as well preach on that
[1:04:52] point it's nothing you did you did not
[1:04:54] work yourself up into faith if you ever
[1:04:57] have faith it's been given to you by the
[1:05:00] grace of God and God reveals it to you
[1:05:03] amen therefore faith is a revelation we
[1:05:07] will not work our way into faith we will
[1:05:09] not pray our way into faith we will not
[1:05:11] fast our way into Faith amen if you got
[1:05:14] any faith in your life this morning it
[1:05:16] is a gift from God through the grace of
[1:05:19] God brother said in an audience of
[1:05:21] people when a prayer line comes he said
[1:05:23] you'll find some they're all good people
[1:05:25] will say he said but there's some amen
[1:05:28] that's trying real hard to believe it
[1:05:29] they're trying to work themselves into
[1:05:31] it and then someone just can't do it at
[1:05:33] all see he said but then there's others
[1:05:35] and it's just by Grace it's just given
[1:05:38] to them see now there is the difference
[1:05:40] see amen that's the real Revelation
[1:05:43] because faith is a revelation from God
[1:05:46] it must be revealed first when the word
[1:05:49] of God is revealed and takes preeminence
[1:05:52] in your life amen that's the real
[1:05:55] Revelation that the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:05:57] Prevail against amen I want to put this
[1:05:59] on record this morning and say Amen to
[1:06:01] the bride the Rapture is a revelation
[1:06:05] we're not here trying to get rapturing
[1:06:07] works this morning we're not here
[1:06:09] polishing up our rapturing works we are
[1:06:11] here looking amen for more rapturing
[1:06:14] faith and more rapturing grace amen
[1:06:16] that's the only way you're going to take
[1:06:18] a Rapture amen it's by the faith of God
[1:06:21] through the grace of God Amen the
[1:06:22] prophet of God said the rap is a
[1:06:24] revelation he said and faith is
[1:06:26] something that's been revealed to you
[1:06:28] like it was to Abraham that you could
[1:06:31] call anything contrary to what had been
[1:06:33] revealed to him as though it wasn't so
[1:06:36] in other words you can look at every
[1:06:37] devil and says you're not going in a
[1:06:39] Rapture and say I've already made it you
[1:06:42] can look at every line vanity that says
[1:06:44] I cannot overcome Leota and you can say
[1:06:47] I've already overcome it you can look at
[1:06:49] every negative spirit and says you're to
[1:06:51] this and you're to that and say no if
[1:06:54] caught before me amen then you can
[1:06:56] gather all the negative Spirits Out of
[1:06:57] Hell against me amen but with this
[1:06:59] Revelation I will prevail over amen the
[1:07:02] gates of hell with this Revelation I
[1:07:05] will take a Rapture with this Revelation
[1:07:07] I will be a serpent Bruiser with this
[1:07:10] Revelation I will fulfill the word
[1:07:12] concerning my life and there won't be
[1:07:14] enough devils in Hell Amen to stop this
[1:07:16] Revelation from prevailing over in
[1:07:19] situations now brother said it very
[1:07:21] beautiful he said denomination don't
[1:07:22] even believe in spiritual
[1:07:24] Revelation he said no they don't he said
[1:07:27] but the true church I believe I'm
[1:07:29] preaching that true church but the true
[1:07:31] church Amen brother Morgan is built upon
[1:07:33] a spiritual Revelation he said the whole
[1:07:36] entire body amen of Jesus Christ amen is
[1:07:39] built on the spiritual revelation of
[1:07:42] Jesus Christ amen now pray tell me who
[1:07:44] is Jesus Christ he is the head of this
[1:07:47] body so the whole body amen is built
[1:07:50] upon the foundation of headship and that
[1:07:53] headship is not a man it's not an idea
[1:07:56] it's not a Creed Dogma or ritual amen
[1:07:59] the headship is Christ the word you all
[1:08:02] know this story very well amen but in
[1:08:04] Matthew 16 the Bible said that Jesus
[1:08:06] comes in brother mat into the coast of
[1:08:08] cesaria Philippi and he walks among the
[1:08:11] disciples and he asked him a question he
[1:08:13] said who do men say that I the son of
[1:08:16] man am amen and they begin to speak up
[1:08:19] and Brother David Paul one said you're
[1:08:21] Elias and one said you're jeremias and
[1:08:23] one said you're one of the prophets amen
[1:08:25] but he said listen I didn't come here
[1:08:27] Amen to get a collective Revelation amen
[1:08:29] I come here to hear to who do you
[1:08:31] individually say I am amen now this is
[1:08:33] what amazes me out of all the disciples
[1:08:36] that was there amen out of all the ones
[1:08:38] that could have spoke up brother Wesley
[1:08:40] the one that spoke up with Simon Peter
[1:08:43] and let me just go ahead and say it
[1:08:44] Simon Peter didn't have a good record
[1:08:46] behind him amen he was a he was a God
[1:08:49] denier right amen he was a cursing
[1:08:51] preacher amen one day he lost his temper
[1:08:53] to can sort out and cut a man's ear off
[1:08:56] amen and God had to put the ear back on
[1:08:58] to save Peter from The Penalty amen
[1:09:00] Peter didn't have a lot going for him in
[1:09:02] the sense of the world Amen but what I
[1:09:04] love about it out of everybody that
[1:09:06] could have spoke amen God chose Peter to
[1:09:09] say these words amen but Thou Art the
[1:09:11] Christ amen the son of the Living God
[1:09:14] now I'm not going to ask you this to
[1:09:16] raise your hand but we all got a lot of
[1:09:18] mistakes in here we all make mistakes
[1:09:20] every day amen but can I say what I love
[1:09:23] about this amen is Peter's Revelation
[1:09:25] was greater than all of his
[1:09:28] mistakes all of his mistakes all of his
[1:09:31] failures all the things he done all the
[1:09:34] things he said amen but when it come
[1:09:36] time Amen brother Randall for somebody
[1:09:38] to identify who that was in flesh amen
[1:09:41] God chose Peter and he said Thou Art the
[1:09:44] Christ amen the son of the Living God
[1:09:47] can I say what I believe I believe your
[1:09:49] mistakes don't have enough power to rob
[1:09:52] you of spiritual revelation I think if
[1:09:54] you would put them mistakes on notice
[1:09:56] this morning and say I've got mistakes
[1:09:58] I've got failures I got things I don't
[1:10:01] like about myself amen but greater than
[1:10:03] all my mistakes and greater than all my
[1:10:05] failures is a revelation that is taken
[1:10:08] preeminence in my soul and no matter how
[1:10:11] low I get no matter how down I get no
[1:10:14] matter how sick I get I can still
[1:10:16] testify in the weakest of situation in
[1:10:19] the darkest of hours that thou art the
[1:10:22] Christ the son of the Living God and the
[1:10:25] prophet of God said Jesus turn and said
[1:10:27] Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock glory
[1:10:30] to God Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:10:35] church amen and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:10:39] not Prevail against it I love that word
[1:10:42] Prevail it means to be strong to
[1:10:45] another's detriment it means to Prevail
[1:10:47] against it means to be superior in
[1:10:51] strength come on Church cuz some of
[1:10:54] y'all's giving the Gates of Hell more
[1:10:55] strength than they really
[1:10:56] got the Bible said you will not be
[1:11:00] inferior you will be superior the Bible
[1:11:03] said they will not overcome you but you
[1:11:05] will overcome them see but what is that
[1:11:08] rock he said it's the spiritual revealed
[1:11:11] revelation of the word of God brother
[1:11:14] said down for the ages we've had Creeds
[1:11:16] and denominations and what more but the
[1:11:18] Church of the Living God moves just the
[1:11:20] same it's in the minority I know that
[1:11:23] amen but someday it will be in the
[1:11:26] majority when the redeemed of all ages
[1:11:28] Rises to go with her to meet Jesus it's
[1:11:31] the Church of the Living God now can I
[1:11:34] say this to you Revelation is more
[1:11:36] powerful than you
[1:11:38] realize Revelation is more amen how can
[1:11:41] I say this amen it's more needful than
[1:11:43] you realize cuz I know some people get
[1:11:45] in their mind we just need the Bible we
[1:11:47] just need the Bible amen but let me say
[1:11:49] this we had the
[1:11:50] Bible for hundreds and thousands of
[1:11:53] years years and when a Prophet come on
[1:11:55] the scene they were still getting it
[1:11:57] wrong but when brother brandham took the
[1:11:59] Bible and begin to preach it under the
[1:12:01] inspiration of the pillar of fire he
[1:12:03] begin to make a declaration amen that
[1:12:06] the same Pillar of Fire that was here
[1:12:08] while the Bible was being wrote is the
[1:12:10] same Pillar of Fire that's here while
[1:12:12] the Bible is being interpreted Amen in
[1:12:14] other words I'm not bringing you another
[1:12:17] Bible I'm not bringing you another
[1:12:19] scripture I'm not bringing you another
[1:12:21] book that they found Amen in the Lost
[1:12:23] Books of the bble he was saying I'm
[1:12:25] bringing you the revelation of what's
[1:12:27] been laying in this word for years and
[1:12:29] if you can accept this Revelation it'll
[1:12:31] be a door of escape to you in the
[1:12:34] situations of your life tells something
[1:12:36] very beautiful he says a Baptist
[1:12:38] Minister called me and said brother BR I
[1:12:40] want to straighten you out on the
[1:12:41] godhead I had left my subject I'm going
[1:12:43] somewhere amen I want to straighten you
[1:12:45] out on the godhead he said this Baptist
[1:12:47] believe there is one God and three
[1:12:48] persons I said sir repeat that again he
[1:12:51] said one God and three persons I said
[1:12:53] where did you go to school at he said
[1:12:55] well I went to a Bible school I said I
[1:12:57] can believe that I said now let me ask
[1:12:59] you this amen you cannot be a person
[1:13:02] without being a personality and if you
[1:13:04] are a personality you are one
[1:13:06] personality to yourself amen you are are
[1:13:09] a separate individual being he said well
[1:13:11] the theologians can't even explain that
[1:13:14] I said it's by Revelation amen the
[1:13:17] theologians can't explain that amen and
[1:13:19] the reason why is because it's by
[1:13:21] Revelation now listen to these words
[1:13:23] words and he said I cannot accept
[1:13:27] Revelation I cannot accept Revelation I
[1:13:30] said then there's no way for God to ever
[1:13:33] get to you because it's hid from the
[1:13:35] eyes of the wise and prudent amen and is
[1:13:37] revealed to babes amen such as will
[1:13:39] learn accept it amen there's no way for
[1:13:42] God to get to you amen you close
[1:13:44] yourself off to him so the very day that
[1:13:47] you get in a place that you cannot
[1:13:49] accept Revelation is the very day you
[1:13:52] slam the door in God's face and God
[1:13:54] can't get to you amen because the only
[1:13:56] way he can get to you is through the
[1:13:58] channel of Revelation he said the whole
[1:14:00] Bible is the revelation of God the whole
[1:14:03] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:14:05] God there is no other way to know God
[1:14:07] Only by Revelation to whom the son will
[1:14:10] reveal him amen Revelation he says amen
[1:14:14] everything is revelation amen can I say
[1:14:17] this what he said he said not to accept
[1:14:19] Revelation then you're a cold Theologian
[1:14:22] and there is there's no hope for you if
[1:14:24] you cannot accept Revelation you become
[1:14:27] a cold Theologian and there's no hope
[1:14:30] for you now I'm here so I'm going to go
[1:14:32] ahead and say it if that's okay we get
[1:14:33] in our mind that the only place there's
[1:14:35] called theologians is on the platform
[1:14:37] behind the pull pit amen but I've
[1:14:39] preached some more theologians in the
[1:14:41] pews than I have in the pull pits
[1:14:43] because they've got their own Direction
[1:14:45] they got their own mind made up they got
[1:14:47] their own Vindication amen and they're
[1:14:49] literally sitting there and God is
[1:14:51] knocking on the door trying to get to
[1:14:53] but their theology has slammed the door
[1:14:55] in his face and they will not accept
[1:14:58] Revelation let me say this what we need
[1:15:00] is not amen a new church we don't need
[1:15:02] another preacher we don't need another
[1:15:04] direction we need the spirit of the
[1:15:06] Living God Amen to come in the church in
[1:15:08] the fire and dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] and tear down every icicle tear down
[1:15:13] every stronghold and bring a fresh
[1:15:15] Revelation back in the church amen I'm
[1:15:17] going to tell you why I believe in
[1:15:19] Revelation amen sister Vanna because
[1:15:21] Revelation brings hope amen Revelation
[1:15:23] brings hope in lives education puts it
[1:15:26] out amen ideas put it out amen but when
[1:15:29] Revelation comes in the building amen
[1:15:31] you can be preaching in the tightest of
[1:15:34] tight atmospheres you can be in the
[1:15:35] coldest of cold services but if
[1:15:38] Revelation comes in and begins to knock
[1:15:40] on somebody's heart and they open up the
[1:15:42] door and Jesus Christ the god of that
[1:15:45] Revelation steps in their heart amen
[1:15:47] they'll receive a fresh drink of water
[1:15:50] they'll receive a bread they'll receive
[1:15:52] a strength Hallelujah I am a firm
[1:15:55] believer that Revelation brings
[1:15:58] hope sir Revelation brings hope in the
[1:16:02] darkest of hours Revelation brings hope
[1:16:05] in the confusing moments Revelation
[1:16:07] brings hope when you don't know which
[1:16:09] way to turn Revelation brings
[1:16:12] hope are you hearing me Revelation in
[1:16:15] the service will bring hope Revelation
[1:16:17] in a song will bring hope Revelation in
[1:16:20] a sermon will bring hope are y'all
[1:16:22] hearing me you don't believe me just get
[1:16:24] in the valley amen I see some of our
[1:16:26] elders back there amen waving their
[1:16:28] hands cuz they've been there they've
[1:16:30] been in The Valleys they've been in the
[1:16:31] storms they've been in the situations
[1:16:34] and the only reason they're still here
[1:16:35] today is because there was a revelation
[1:16:39] on the inside of their soul that they
[1:16:41] knew there was something more than what
[1:16:43] they were seeing and what they were
[1:16:44] hearing and what they were facing they
[1:16:46] knew there was more to this message than
[1:16:48] a bunch of this that and the other they
[1:16:50] knew there was more to this than just
[1:16:52] some man's opinion opinion they knew
[1:16:53] there was a supernatural God who had
[1:16:56] come down in this generation with a
[1:16:58] vision concerning their life and they
[1:17:00] were willing to persevere through the
[1:17:01] bad days good days up days down days
[1:17:04] because why they had a
[1:17:09] revelation now the problem of God said
[1:17:11] it very beautiful he said if you don't
[1:17:12] believe in Revelation look at Matthew
[1:17:14] 15:14 he said Jesus spoke to the
[1:17:16] Pharisees and said let them alone they
[1:17:19] be blind leaders of the Blind and if the
[1:17:22] blind lead the blind blind then they
[1:17:24] both shall fall into the ditch that word
[1:17:27] blind actually means mentally blind I
[1:17:29] said why were these Pharisees blind he
[1:17:32] said what made them so blind is because
[1:17:34] they would not accept
[1:17:37] Revelation they would not accept
[1:17:39] Revelation amen or Vindication of the
[1:17:42] word now let me say this I believe that
[1:17:45] the message of the hour has revealed
[1:17:47] Jesus
[1:17:49] Christ I believe the message of the hour
[1:17:52] has revealed Jes Jesus Christ in plain
[1:17:55] view according to Romans 16:25 Paul says
[1:17:58] now to him that is of power to establish
[1:18:00] you according to my gospel and the
[1:18:03] preaching of Jesus Christ according to
[1:18:06] the revelation of the mystery which was
[1:18:08] Kept Secret since the world began amen
[1:18:11] but now is made manifest so at one time
[1:18:14] this Revelation was secret but brother
[1:18:16] Wesley today it's now made manifest and
[1:18:19] here is this Revelation by the
[1:18:21] scriptures of the prophet
[1:18:23] according to the Commandment of the
[1:18:24] Everlasting God and is made known to All
[1:18:27] Nations amen for The Obedience of Faith
[1:18:30] amen so when this Revelation is released
[1:18:32] it's going to bring a faith in the
[1:18:34] church but it's going to bring an
[1:18:36] obedience to that faith in other words
[1:18:38] this Revelation is going to cause you to
[1:18:41] obey Faith rather than feelings this
[1:18:44] Revelation is going to cause you to obey
[1:18:46] the word amen rather than some man-made
[1:18:48] interpretation this Revelation is going
[1:18:50] to cause you to believe the word over
[1:18:53] everything and it's going to release a
[1:18:55] superior strength in your life and Paul
[1:18:57] goes on to say in Colossians 1:27 to
[1:19:00] whom God would make known what is the
[1:19:02] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:19:05] among the Gentiles amen which is Christ
[1:19:08] in you amen the hope of glory now I love
[1:19:11] this because the Gentiles was a hopeless
[1:19:13] people they were Outcast they were not
[1:19:16] included in anything as far as the Jews
[1:19:18] were concerned it was a waste of
[1:19:20] humanity amen and there was no hope for
[1:19:23] them unless somebody take the place of a
[1:19:26] savior to break the bars of a natural
[1:19:29] birth and to bring them in by Grace so
[1:19:31] Jesus Christ the son of God hung on the
[1:19:34] calvary amen and by him hanging on
[1:19:36] Calvary he revealed himself in plain
[1:19:39] view amen as a savior of all mankind and
[1:19:42] his death at Calvary amen broke the bars
[1:19:45] over the door and a Door of Hope was
[1:19:47] opened unto the Gentiles by the death of
[1:19:50] Jesus Christ but it didn't just stop at
[1:19:53] his death on the third day by a
[1:19:55] supernatural Resurrection he arose again
[1:19:58] and brought hope back in the church
[1:20:00] listen friends we have got a power this
[1:20:02] morning and it's not the power of
[1:20:04] psychology it's not the power of
[1:20:06] denomination it's the power of Faith to
[1:20:09] believe God's word has opened the door
[1:20:11] of Hope unto this generation and I say
[1:20:14] this to you in the name of the Lord you
[1:20:15] don't have to stay where you are you
[1:20:18] don't have to live behind those bars you
[1:20:20] don't have to live underneath all that
[1:20:22] fear amen there's a word concerning your
[1:20:24] life and it's a heavenly
[1:20:27] vision amen amen are you hearing me and
[1:20:30] the hope is Christ in you said what is
[1:20:33] the mystery of God is God in you the
[1:20:36] hope of glory shining forth the baptism
[1:20:40] of the Holy Spirit he said now watch and
[1:20:43] see where the gates of hell is against
[1:20:45] it's not against the denomination the
[1:20:47] government recognizes that the world
[1:20:49] recognizes those amen what is the gates
[1:20:52] of hell again brother Joe it's against
[1:20:54] the spiritual revelation of Christ being
[1:20:57] here now the same yesterday today and
[1:21:00] forever the gates of hell is not against
[1:21:03] your feelings come on I'm preaching to
[1:21:05] you now amen because I tell you what'll
[1:21:07] happen amen you'll come in church and
[1:21:09] sometimes you won't feel like getting in
[1:21:11] you won't feel like saying amen you
[1:21:13] won't feel like singing the now I might
[1:21:15] as well preach somebody will hurt your
[1:21:16] feelings in the parking lot somebody
[1:21:18] hurt your feelings in the vestib
[1:21:20] somebody won't shake your hand they
[1:21:21] won't recognize you amen and your
[1:21:23] feelings get defeated and brother r on
[1:21:25] just a matter of minutes amen but
[1:21:27] greater is the Revelation amen than the
[1:21:30] feelings of your Humanity I say this
[1:21:32] this morning we can have a good service
[1:21:34] ever service we can have a breakthrough
[1:21:36] ever service amen because our services
[1:21:39] are not bound to Five Senses amen our
[1:21:41] services are controlled by the Super S
[1:21:44] and it's a revelation and if the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost comes in the building we'll begin
[1:21:48] to praise we'll begin to worship we'll
[1:21:50] begin to shout we'll begin to sing we'll
[1:21:53] begin to preach we'll begin to shout
[1:21:55] until them Devils back up and the
[1:21:57] liberty of the Holy Ghost comes in the
[1:21:59] building and manifest himself in the
[1:22:02] power of his resurrection listen you're
[1:22:04] looking at one preacher that still
[1:22:06] believes in the power of the
[1:22:08] Resurrection I said I still believe in
[1:22:10] the power of the Resurrection you say
[1:22:12] preacher why do you believe in the power
[1:22:13] of the Resurrection because before the
[1:22:15] resurrection he needed a door to walk
[1:22:17] through but after the resurrection he
[1:22:19] can walk right through the
[1:22:21] wall
[1:22:23] are you hearing me before he needed a
[1:22:25] door but after the resurrection he can
[1:22:27] walk right in through a wall Oh Glory to
[1:22:30] God you know what that tells me that the
[1:22:32] power of the Resurrection is
[1:22:35] unlimited are you hearing me you say
[1:22:37] brother you don't know how far I've gone
[1:22:39] I don't need to know how far you've gone
[1:22:41] I'm coming to tell you how far he came
[1:22:43] and he didn't stop on earth oh God he
[1:22:46] didn't stop on the earth he didn't stop
[1:22:48] in Galilee he didn't stop in Nazareth he
[1:22:50] went all the way to hell and through a
[1:22:52] supernatural Resurrection he took the
[1:22:55] keys of death hell and the grave away
[1:22:57] and sent me here this morning to
[1:22:59] announce unto you there's a supernatural
[1:23:01] God in this building this morning and
[1:23:03] he's got a faith to break whatever
[1:23:05] situation you're going
[1:23:07] through I believe in Revelation I
[1:23:09] believe the gates of hell is against it
[1:23:11] but we'll Prevail over them by this
[1:23:14] revelation we shall overcome am now can
[1:23:19] I just say it Satan hates Revelation yes
[1:23:22] sir
[1:23:23] amen but we love
[1:23:26] it let's say that together Satan hates
[1:23:30] Revelation but we love it let's say it
[1:23:33] again that felt pretty good Satan hates
[1:23:35] Revelation but we love
[1:23:39] it Satan hates it but we love it Satan
[1:23:43] hates it but we love it you know why we
[1:23:45] love it because he cannot Prevail
[1:23:47] against it and it makes him so mad it
[1:23:50] gets him all tore up it gets him all
[1:23:52] bothered amen but I don't care I'll say
[1:23:54] it again there is a revelation in this
[1:23:56] building that the devil cannot Prevail
[1:23:59] against he can Prevail against my flesh
[1:24:01] he can Prevail against my spirit but
[1:24:03] there is a revelation In My Soul by gen
[1:24:06] seed of almighty God and there ain't
[1:24:08] enough devils in Hell Amen to defeat
[1:24:10] this Revelation I believe this morning
[1:24:12] you are an Unstoppable undefeatable
[1:24:15] Invincible Army and it's not by your
[1:24:17] works it's not by your ability it's by
[1:24:20] the
[1:24:21] revelation
[1:24:22] the Revelation is coming to your life
[1:24:25] and the prophet said he knows that the
[1:24:26] people get the true revelation of the
[1:24:28] true Spirit or the true church and what
[1:24:31] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:24:33] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:24:37] an invincible Army brother Tom she won't
[1:24:40] be she might not be possibly she will be
[1:24:44] an invincible Army you know what the
[1:24:46] word Invincible means too powerful to be
[1:24:49] defeated
[1:24:51] amen now if you would let your soul
[1:24:53] worship this morning your seat wouldn't
[1:24:55] have contained you just
[1:24:57] then but we've all been there and the
[1:25:00] reason why we can't is because our flesh
[1:25:02] is telling us well this and that amen
[1:25:04] but let me repeat that again Invincible
[1:25:06] means you're too powerful to be
[1:25:09] defeated you are too powerful to be
[1:25:11] defeated come on Church some of y'all
[1:25:13] sitting there thinking something's going
[1:25:14] to defeat you if we open the mic and had
[1:25:16] an open floor this morning amen there be
[1:25:18] people here that's been through enough
[1:25:20] they shouldn't be here amen but if God
[1:25:22] got you this far if God brought you
[1:25:24] through everything that he's brought you
[1:25:26] through amen then why are you backing up
[1:25:28] and let some more unbeli a negative
[1:25:30] devil amen convince you he's got more
[1:25:32] power than this word come on church amen
[1:25:35] if God took this church from that back
[1:25:37] corner Amen to where it is this morning
[1:25:39] that I challenge every devil in hell you
[1:25:41] didn't defeat him then and you won't
[1:25:43] defeat him now then this is more than
[1:25:46] that mois this is more than Grace
[1:25:48] Tabernacle this is a supernatural
[1:25:50] Revelation that has come into this
[1:25:52] Church by the preaching of the message
[1:25:54] of the hour and it's pursuing Devils
[1:25:57] it's recovering families it's restoring
[1:25:59] homes it's restored lives I refuse to
[1:26:02] believe that the devil will defeat this
[1:26:04] church I refuse to believe that the
[1:26:06] devil will defeat your young people I
[1:26:08] refuse to believe that I refuse I refuse
[1:26:11] I refuse to believe it there is a
[1:26:14] revelation in my soul this morning that
[1:26:16] is testified you are an invincible
[1:26:20] Army bad day won't defeat it down days

[1:26:26] depression won't
[1:26:29] defeat are you hearing me I'm telling
[1:26:32] you I refuse to get out that spirit I
[1:26:35] refuse that's why that Devil's pushing
[1:26:37] against me right now is I refuse to get
[1:26:39] under it because he knows if I get under
[1:26:42] it I can't break it but if I can stay
[1:26:45] above
[1:26:45] it and preach to you the word of God I
[1:26:49] can break through the clouds and say

[1:27:02] you'll never break a spirit you get
[1:27:06] under you'll never break a spirit you

[1:27:11] it is the minute it controls
[1:27:15] you I know what I'm talking about the
[1:27:17] minute you get under it is the minute it

[1:27:22] vision it changes your
[1:27:24] worship it changes your praise I know
[1:27:27] what I'm talking about amen but I didn't
[1:27:29] come here to preach a fancy sermon I
[1:27:31] come here to preach the word and I know
[1:27:33] the word will defeat the Devil anywhere
[1:27:36] any time any place under any condition
[1:27:39] can I say this in any
[1:27:41] church if God can just find somebody who
[1:27:45] will believe his word he will come in
[1:27:47] that atmosphere and he will manifest
[1:27:49] himself and he will break spirits that
[1:27:51] you think will never be
[1:27:52] broken I know what I'm talking about
[1:27:55] amen it's an age of spiritual warfare
[1:27:57] and I think it's time to release the
[1:27:58] revelation of the Holy Ghost back in the
[1:28:01] church and get some fire behind it and
[1:28:03] get some Joy behind it I know what I'm
[1:28:05] talking about well we've been through
[1:28:07] this we've been through that amen guess
[1:28:08] what you've been through it but you're
[1:28:10] no longer in it so if God brought you
[1:28:12] through it and God brought you out of it
[1:28:14] then don't you think it's time Amen to
[1:28:16] shake off the shackles don't you think
[1:28:19] it's time Amen to let the faith of God
[1:28:21] arise in your hearts and declare that if
[1:28:24] God be in me who can be against me don't
[1:28:26] you think it's time Amen to break out of
[1:28:28] depression and to break out of the Blues
[1:28:31] and to break out of all

[1:28:36] last thing I do and you can sit there
[1:28:38] and watch me do it that devil is
[1:28:40] defeated this morning that cloud that
[1:28:42] hangs over and hangs over and hangs over
[1:28:44] it will hang over no more because
[1:28:47] greater is the revelation of Jesus
[1:28:49] Christ in your life and if God be in
[1:28:52] your soul that's more than a feeling
[1:28:54] that's more than a sensation that is a
[1:28:57] reality that Jesus Christ is not in the
[1:28:59] grave come on I know you're all natural
[1:29:01] born people but I didn't come to preach

[1:29:34] back in the Revelation where God can
[1:29:36] come on the
[1:29:39] scene I refuse to get under
[1:29:42] it I refuse to get under
[1:29:45] it I feel that right here in this
[1:29:47] building this morning I refuse to get
[1:29:49] under it Matt Morris refuses to get
[1:29:51] under it
[1:29:52] Joe Reynolds refuses to get under it
[1:29:54] Mark refuses
[1:29:56] to come on elders y'all refuse to get
[1:29:59] under it brother Morgan you refuse to
[1:30:01] get under it that's why the devil's
[1:30:03] pushing and he's pushing and he's
[1:30:04] pushing it's cuz he wants you to get
[1:30:06] under
[1:30:09] it let me prove it to you Spirits work
[1:30:12] when you don't know they're
[1:30:14] working years ago a brother told me he
[1:30:16] was in a prayer line went over to pray
[1:30:18] for a sister man of God laid his hand on
[1:30:21] that woman when he laid his hand on a
[1:30:23] Brother Matt and began to pray a spirit
[1:30:25] spoke and said you're wasting your time
[1:30:28] you're helpless you're useless nothing
[1:30:31] you can do to help her nothing you can
[1:30:33] do to pray for her nothing you can do to
[1:30:35] deliver her you know what that devil was
[1:30:37] doing that devil was trying to
[1:30:38] manipulate somebody with a revelation of
[1:30:41] Mark 16 to come under the influence of
[1:30:43] demonic spirits and just agree that this
[1:30:46] woman could never get free he said but I
[1:30:48] stood there and I prayed when I didn't
[1:30:50] feel like praying I believe when I
[1:30:51] didn't didn't feel like believing he
[1:30:53] said even though that devil was talking
[1:30:54] to me amen and that woman got a
[1:30:56] breakthrough afterwards the pastor told
[1:30:58] him he said brother we've been praying
[1:30:59] for that for a long time he said what do
[1:31:01] you mean he said she's been under a
[1:31:03] spirit of depression he said that Spirit
[1:31:05] of depression has been telling her she
[1:31:07] can't get free she's useless she's
[1:31:09] hopeless she'll never overcome it and
[1:31:11] watch how that devil worked amen that
[1:31:13] devil already had one under that spirit
[1:31:16] amen so here comes a man of God brother
[1:31:18] Joel with a revelation that that Spirit
[1:31:20] can be broken and he lays his hand on
[1:31:22] her and that devil says I got her so
[1:31:24] let's see if we can intimidate him and
[1:31:26] get him underneath the Same Spirit but
[1:31:28] he stood there with a revelation and he
[1:31:31] prayed a prayer of Deliverance and the
[1:31:33] woman left her
[1:31:35] free I'm telling you church if you're
[1:31:37] going to break the spirit you got to get
[1:31:39] out from under
[1:31:40] it if you're going to break the spirit
[1:31:43] you got to get out from under it well
[1:31:44] brother and I'm under will get somebody
[1:31:46] and join with you that ain't under that
[1:31:47] spirit and get in a spiritual warfare
[1:31:50] come on Grace Tabernacle I think it's
[1:31:52] time to declare
[1:31:53] war I think it's time to declare war I
[1:31:56] think it's time to take back your
[1:31:57] Revival I think it's time to take back
[1:32:00] your vision I think it's come on Church
[1:32:02] well brother we've been through some
[1:32:03] hard times I know you've been through
[1:32:05] some hard times but can you open your
[1:32:07] eyes and see you're still
[1:32:11] here Satan hates that
[1:32:15] Revelation because he cannot defeat it
[1:32:19] now Pro God said there's nothing is life
[1:32:22] given and prevailing as Revelation right
[1:32:24] yes
[1:32:25] sir now what are you getting at brother
[1:32:28] Andrew I'm
[1:32:31] saying faith comes from hearing glory to
[1:32:34] God what is
[1:32:35] told I'm telling you the vision this
[1:32:39] morning I'm telling you what the word
[1:32:42] says concerning your life he said I went
[1:32:44] into a place an insane institution he
[1:32:46] said there I was facing a very hideous
[1:32:48] demon that was cursing me and spitting
[1:32:51] on on me and trying to bite me in a
[1:32:53] straight
[1:32:55] jacket now you don't know what a
[1:32:56] straight jacket is it's something
[1:32:59] someone puts on you to restrain you on
[1:33:04] because you're acting contrary to the
[1:33:06] way they want you to
[1:33:08] act hello so in other words you're not
[1:33:12] you're not I'm getting in trouble L say
[1:33:14] they put them on you when you're acting
[1:33:16] out out when you shouldn't be acting the
[1:33:17] way you're acting so you're out of
[1:33:18] control so they're trying to control you
[1:33:20] to act the way they you should act so
[1:33:22] they put a straight jacket on you and
[1:33:24] say this is the way you act and when you
[1:33:26] act the way we say you act then we'll
[1:33:27] let you have the straight jacket what
[1:33:29] they do is they bind the person and the
[1:33:31] prophet said when I went in there to
[1:33:32] meet that demon he said I knew that one
[1:33:34] thing that first I knew that Christ amen
[1:33:36] died to free that man from that demon so
[1:33:39] brother Tim brother Bram didn't walk in
[1:33:41] there and say I wonder if I'm here to
[1:33:42] pray I wonder I wonder if God will do
[1:33:44] something no he walked in there Wesley
[1:33:46] with the Revelation that Jesus Christ
[1:33:48] died at Calvary to free the person from
[1:33:51] that demon he was not going in there
[1:33:54] looking for a revelation to help the
[1:33:56] person he came in there with a
[1:33:58] revelation church at the Living God I
[1:34:00] didn't come here this morning looking
[1:34:01] for something Amen to help you I came
[1:34:04] here with something to help you and it's
[1:34:06] the message of the hour it's the
[1:34:08] revelation of Jesus Christ and that
[1:34:10] Revelation coming into your life will
[1:34:12] defeat the devil that says he'll defeat
[1:34:16] you he goes in there brother Mark and he
[1:34:18] said when I went in there he said I know
[1:34:20] the angel of the Lord came to me that
[1:34:22] night and spoke to me and told
[1:34:26] me that nothing would stand before the
[1:34:28] prayer if I could get the people to
[1:34:30] believe me and if I would be sincere
[1:34:33] when I prayed therefore I had a double
[1:34:35] witness that I could ask him through the
[1:34:37] name of Jesus Christ to come out of that
[1:34:39] person and the man was took out of the
[1:34:41] straight jacket and went home normally
[1:34:44] in his right mind he said why because in
[1:34:47] the authority of the name of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ every demon in H hell is subject
[1:34:52] to that name every demon in hell is
[1:34:56] subject to that name amen watch that's
[1:34:58] right it's the name of all names that's
[1:35:01] a good sermon title it's the name of all
[1:35:03] names is Jesus amen it wasn't given by
[1:35:06] human lips the holy ghost that Gabriel
[1:35:09] the holy ghost that Gabriel it was came
[1:35:11] down and told Mary to call his name
[1:35:15] Jesus the angel came down and told Mary
[1:35:19] the Heavenly being came down told Mary
[1:35:22] what's conceived in you is a
[1:35:24] supernatural being and don't you call
[1:35:26] his name Joseph II or Junior amen you
[1:35:29] call him Jesus amen and there will be a
[1:35:31] power in that name and every devil will
[1:35:33] have to bow with that
[1:35:36] name can I prove it to you when she went
[1:35:38] to Elizabeth there was a baby laying in
[1:35:40] her womb that hadn't moved in 6 months
[1:35:43] and when that name was spoken amen
[1:35:45] because Mary believed what was told her
[1:35:48] and what was told her is when that name
[1:35:50] is spoken there will be power behind
[1:35:52] that name there will be an authority
[1:35:54] behind that name there will be a miracle
[1:35:56] behind that name there will be a
[1:35:57] Deliverance behind that name there will
[1:35:59] be a healing behind that name there will
[1:36:01] be a Dominion behind that name when that
[1:36:04] name is spoken there will be a power
[1:36:06] come behind that name and that name will
[1:36:08] cause every knee to Bow every tongue to
[1:36:10] confess it will cause every devil to Bow
[1:36:13] I want to say it this morning Jesus amen
[1:36:16] can we say it in the church Jesus the
[1:36:19] devil hates the name but we love the
[1:36:21] name and the name is Jesus come on
[1:36:23] somebody shout Jesus I said somebody
[1:36:26] shout Jesus shout it more than just a
[1:36:28] name shout it as your savior shout him
[1:36:31] as your healer shout him as your
[1:36:33] deliverer shout him as a miracle worker
[1:36:35] shout it out as the mighty con I'm
[1:36:38] talking about Jesus I'm talking about
[1:36:40] the name that heals cancer I'm talking
[1:36:43] about the name that delivers depression
[1:36:45] I'm talking about the name that restores
[1:36:47] chicles I'm talking about the name that
[1:36:49] gives the Holy Ghost the name of all
[1:36:52] names and it's
[1:36:55] Jesus I said it's Jesus I said it's
[1:36:58] Jesus I'm going to put on my walking
[1:37:00] shoes this morning and I'm going to walk
[1:37:02] around in my inheritance because I am an
[1:37:05] heir of the authority and the power and
[1:37:08] the ability and the majesty and the
[1:37:11] glory of that name and it's
[1:37:15] Jesus it stops storms it raises the dead
[1:37:19] it breaks up it breaks up funeral
[1:37:22] processions it brings the blinded eyes
[1:37:24] in it's Jesus I said it's
[1:37:28] Jesus I tell you why the devil don't
[1:37:30] want you to say that name it's cuz you
[1:37:32] are a people in Black Rock Arkansas that
[1:37:34] actually has the Divine authority of
[1:37:36] that
[1:37:37] name want me prove it to you brother B
[1:37:40] said they're out here hollering the name
[1:37:41] Jesus right they're out here hollering
[1:37:44] the name Jesus and they're not getting
[1:37:46] nothing so they're out there this
[1:37:48] morning saying Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:37:50] Jesus and they're not getting nothing
[1:37:52] you know why they're not getting nothing
[1:37:54] because they're not under the
[1:37:56] manifestation of the interpretation of
[1:37:59] the name of God I'm just going to say
[1:38:00] what a prophet said he said when the
[1:38:02] seals were open he said he received a
[1:38:04] new
[1:38:05] name when the seals were open he
[1:38:08] received the new name he said and now
[1:38:10] the name of God is the word interpreted
[1:38:13] the manifestation of the name of Jesus
[1:38:16] is the word interpreted so wherever the
[1:38:18] word is interpreted there is a manifest
[1:38:21] of the name that's being spoke well
[1:38:23] Grace Tabernacle there is an
[1:38:25] interpretation of the Living God in this
[1:38:27] building this
[1:38:29] morning his word said he would save and
[1:38:32] Joel you're saved his word said he would
[1:38:34] fill with the Holy Ghost and you're full
[1:38:36] of the Holy Ghost come on Brother David
[1:38:38] the word said he would deliver and he
[1:38:40] you sit here this morning with you and
[1:38:42] your family amen Delivered come on the
[1:38:45] word said he would heal and just a few
[1:38:47] days ago you had a stroke amen but here
[1:38:49] you stand this morning amen healed amen
[1:38:52] by the name of Jesus the word said you
[1:38:55] the word said you wouldn't make it amen
[1:38:57] but here you stand on the other side of
[1:38:59] that trial I say to you this morning you
[1:39:02] are a living breathing living
[1:39:05] manifestation of the name of God I say
[1:39:08] Jesus I speak Jesus over the young
[1:39:10] people I speak Jesus over every marriage
[1:39:13] I speak Jesus over every home I speak
[1:39:15] Jesus over every preacher I'm not
[1:39:17] chanting I'm not chanting the name Jesus
[1:39:20] I'm speaking in the name Jesus by the
[1:39:22] manifestation of the Revelation that has
[1:39:25] been made clear in the age I'm living
[1:39:29] in Jesus his name is power his name is
[1:39:34] Holy his name is
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:39] righteous
[1:39:42] Jesus now either I'm a crazy man or a
[1:39:45] Believer and I'm a Believer I see the
[1:39:49] name of Jesus in man man estation in
[1:39:52] this building this
[1:39:56] morning I know what that Devil's doing
[1:39:58] right now he's pushing and he's pushing
[1:40:01] and he's pushing and he's pushing but
[1:40:03] guess what we're pushing we're
[1:40:07] pushing and we're pushing and we're
[1:40:10] pushing and we're going to keep on
[1:40:12] pushing you know why because there's an
[1:40:14] authority behind this Revelation amen
[1:40:17] yes sir what are you saying I'm saying
[1:40:20] Mar went down to Jesus or to to
[1:40:22] Elizabeth and said Jesus and when she
[1:40:26] said Jesus a dead baby in a mother's
[1:40:30] womb leap for
[1:40:36] Joy a dead baby in oh God in a mother's
[1:40:41] womb leap for
[1:40:44] Joy I'm about to have to tie my hands
[1:40:46] and sit on Bap for Joy at the name of
[1:40:50] Jesus
[1:40:51] the baby wasn't even born yet but when
[1:40:54] he heard the name
[1:40:56] Jesus come on Church the the vision said
[1:41:00] there'll be power in that name when that
[1:41:02] name is spoken he'll be a ruler when
[1:41:04] that name is spoken there'll be there'll
[1:41:06] be overshadowing power that will come
[1:41:08] behind that name and when she said that
[1:41:11] name the life of that name went into
[1:41:13] that
[1:41:15] womb and delivered that baby from
[1:41:18] whatever condition it was in brother
[1:41:20] said if the name of Jesus yes sir goad
[1:41:22] we'll do that for a dead baby he said
[1:41:25] what ought it to do for a
[1:41:27] church if it'll do it for a dead baby
[1:41:30] amen what ought you to do for a church
[1:41:32] that's got likeing come I know some of
[1:41:34] y'all this morning come on church I know
[1:41:37] what I'm talking about amen but what you
[1:41:39] need to do is you need to overcome that
[1:41:40] Devil by the name of
[1:41:43] Jesus I know it's an age of depression I
[1:41:45] know it's an Age of Anxiety I know it's
[1:41:47] an age of complexes and fears amen but
[1:41:50] I'm telling you Church Church there's an
[1:41:51] authority in the name of Jesus now can I
[1:41:53] can I prove to you something when a
[1:41:55] vision comes amen it's more than just a
[1:41:57] word amen it's a direct message from God
[1:42:00] then why say this in closing we've got
[1:42:02] to put our faith in the vision that's
[1:42:04] right yes sir we have got to put our
[1:42:07] faith in the vision said like this he
[1:42:10] said now what have we received we have
[1:42:13] received a heavenly vision I love that
[1:42:16] we have received a heavenly vision he
[1:42:19] said now watch ask 2719 I was not
[1:42:23] disobedient unto the heavenly vision in
[1:42:25] other words when the vision comes you've
[1:42:27] got to obey The Vision by placing your
[1:42:30] faith in the vision and then the effect
[1:42:32] of the vision is The Obedience of it can
[1:42:35] I say this to you whatever is in the
[1:42:40] vision must be in the
[1:42:43] Fulfillment so in other words if there
[1:42:46] was power in the vision there must be
[1:42:49] power in the fulfill M if there was
[1:42:52] Authority in the vision there must be
[1:42:54] Authority in the Fulfillment come on
[1:42:57] church if there was healing in the
[1:42:58] vision there must be healing in the
[1:43:01] Fulfillment whatever was in the vision
[1:43:04] brother Bobby must be in the Fulfillment
[1:43:06] or it's not a correct vision if there's
[1:43:08] one thing different in the Fulfillment
[1:43:10] than what was in the vision that Vision
[1:43:12] didn't come from God come on Church a
[1:43:15] vision must line up with the word of God
[1:43:17] now watch a prophet he said see this
[1:43:19] Vision what is it it's another dimension
[1:43:22] yep that's right so you're literally
[1:43:25] leaving this Dimension and going into
[1:43:27] another dimension it's outside of the
[1:43:31] five senses are y'all ready for this
[1:43:33] it's a forecast of future events so in
[1:43:37] other words when the angel came to Mary
[1:43:40] and told Mary to birth that son and call
[1:43:43] his name Jesus she was receiving a
[1:43:45] vision of forecast of future events and
[1:43:49] here we are some thousands of years
[1:43:51] later and we're still living out the
[1:43:57] vision oh God we're still living out The
[1:44:01] Vision by the authority of the vision
[1:44:04] said watch he said it's a forecast of
[1:44:06] future events now if you read Ephesians
[1:44:07] 1:18 the Bible says that the eyes of
[1:44:10] your understanding would be enlightened
[1:44:13] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:44:15] your calling of his calling and what is
[1:44:18] the riches of the glory of his
[1:44:20] inheritance in the Saints so what
[1:44:22] happens is is a vision comes amen from
[1:44:26] the spirit of Enlightenment right so in
[1:44:30] other words what you're looking at
[1:44:31] Brother David Paul is real dark it's
[1:44:34] real dark it's real gloomy it's real
[1:44:36] heavy but if a vision comes a vision is
[1:44:40] forecasting beyond what you're seeing so
[1:44:43] all you're seeing right now is the
[1:44:45] clouds but brother Randall if a vision
[1:44:47] comes it'll forecast Bey on the clouds
[1:44:50] and you'll see the
[1:44:52] sun yes sir oh God if a vision comes
[1:44:56] brother Travis it'll go beyond the
[1:44:58] clouds it'll go beyond the
[1:45:00] disappointments it'll go beyond the
[1:45:02] present and you'll see the future by
[1:45:05] Vision now if you see it by Vision
[1:45:08] you're going to see what's there in the
[1:45:09] vision and then when you step into the
[1:45:12] Fulfillment of it you're going to be
[1:45:13] able to say as it was in the vision so
[1:45:17] is it in the Fulfillment in other words
[1:45:20] the Vision by Revelation becomes your
[1:45:22] Authority in faith in the vision now can
[1:45:25] I say this the vision has a
[1:45:28] voice I'm moving into something here The
[1:45:31] Vision has a voice and the prophet of
[1:45:34] God said like this he said the voice of
[1:45:36] the vision paraphrasing if it's coming
[1:45:38] from Heaven is coming from the spirit of
[1:45:42] Truth Now John said there's the spirit
[1:45:44] of error and there's the spirit of truth
[1:45:47] right amen now hereby know we the
[1:45:49] spirits amen the spirit of error and the
[1:45:53] spirit of Truth so the spirit of error
[1:45:55] can I say it like this he's a
[1:45:58] prop sir yes sir y'all know what I'm
[1:46:02] talking about I see I feel I think I
[1:46:05] hope I believe I see I feel maybe could
[1:46:08] be it's a propine devil sir don't get
[1:46:12] tired on me preach with me and that
[1:46:15] devil will lie to you and he will lie to
[1:46:17] you and he will lie to you and he will
[1:46:20] bind You by his false interpretations by
[1:46:22] his false prophecies come on well we
[1:46:24] might as well just go and let the rubber
[1:46:26] hit the road and preach a minute amen I
[1:46:28] think it's time to get back to giving
[1:46:29] things the word test we used to think we
[1:46:32] used to check things by the word and not
[1:46:34] by
[1:46:35] personalities well come on church we
[1:46:37] used to check things by the word and not
[1:46:40] by just because of who done it or who
[1:46:41] said it amen but some little old
[1:46:43] personality devil come right in and now
[1:46:45] we don't want to check nothing amen but
[1:46:47] Church Living God if you're going to
[1:46:48] overcome leay out of sea you got to get
[1:46:50] back Amen to giving things the word test
[1:46:53] if you're going to overcome deception
[1:46:55] you got to get back you got to lose the
[1:46:57] fear of checking things by the word if
[1:47:00] you come on church amen some of you all
[1:47:02] have been through that and you know what
[1:47:04] that does it binds and robs and hacks
[1:47:06] and cuts amen but I say thank God for
[1:47:09] the word that we can check the Spirit by
[1:47:12] and we can determine if it's coming from
[1:47:13] God or if it's coming from the
[1:47:16] devil amen can I open up with you for
[1:47:20] minute I fill the room I know what them
[1:47:22] Devils do they come in and disguise
[1:47:25] themselves under spirituality and under
[1:47:27] anointing and they always run over and
[1:47:29] claim that famous verse brother Joel
[1:47:31] touch not my anointed and do my profits
[1:47:33] no harm and I believe that but I don't
[1:47:37] believe your false interpretation that
[1:47:39] you're trying to subject me to is that
[1:47:41] okay I don't believe it I believe what
[1:47:43] the Bible said and the Bible said that
[1:47:45] just the preacher is not the only
[1:47:47] anointed the Bible said whatever Christ
[1:47:50] comes into becomes the anointed can I
[1:47:52] ask you something amen why are we got to
[1:47:54] be AF oh I clean up amen why we got to
[1:47:58] be afraid to check something amen
[1:48:00] there's such a fear oh if I if I if I
[1:48:02] check that preacher and what he told me
[1:48:04] amen God might come after me amen why
[1:48:05] don't we move that same level of respect
[1:48:07] to the pews because you're just as
[1:48:09] anointed as the preacher is come on if
[1:48:12] you're if you're under the word it's the
[1:48:15] same anointing it's a word anointing but
[1:48:17] that Spirit comes in and says now oh God
[1:48:21] get in trouble sure's the world man I
[1:48:23] remember I was just I don't know I just
[1:48:24] started preaching I don't know maybe
[1:48:26] maybe 15 16 and Lord really just started
[1:48:29] opening some doors for me and I was
[1:48:31] going out and preaching you know and we
[1:48:32] had a brother come in the church and I
[1:48:34] say this uh it's on the internet how do
[1:48:37] I say this preacher come by and he got
[1:48:39] up one night and he said he said now you
[1:48:41] all know God uses me in the prophetic
[1:48:43] and discernment and and and visions and
[1:48:45] prophecies and and so well you know I
[1:48:48] checked it by the word now let's move on
[1:48:51] so he gets up you know the Lord use me
[1:48:53] and he stands there brother Bobby and
[1:48:54] all of a sudden he says you know he says
[1:48:56] Andrew Glover come up you know and I
[1:48:58] said okay so I you know respectfully
