[38:56] back.
[38:59] Oh, everything that the devil stole from
[39:03] me,
[39:05] I'll take it back.
[39:09] Everything that the devil stole from me,
[39:13] I'll take it back.
[39:15] Oh, everything that the devil stole from
[39:19] me. Take back my soul,
[39:23] my days,
[39:25] my joy, and my peace. I've taken it
[39:29] back.
[39:31] Oh, everything that the devil stole from
[39:35] me.
[39:36] Oh, give a hand God of praise this
[39:38] evening.
[39:44] How many you come to steal something
[39:45] back that the devil has taken from you?
[39:48] Whether it be your joy, your peace, your
[39:50] victory, your song, your dance, whatever
[39:53] it may be, we have the authority to come
[39:55] and tell him that's rightfully my
[39:56] possession. It belongs to me
[39:59] and he has no right.
[40:01] Aren't you thankful for that this
[40:02] evening? We got some prayer requests
[40:04] that we can bring before you and bring
[40:07] before the Lord with confidence knowing
[40:08] that he's able to do that which he has
[40:11] promised.
[40:12] Amen. We have a prayer for brother David
[40:14] Paul. He's sick tonight. Please pray for
[40:18] Cody and Jasmine as they're traveling
[40:19] this e from home from Wisconsin. Brother
[40:22] David and sister Beth Gates or sick home

[40:45] that he can he hear every single cry we
[40:48] have big or small? Just bring it to him
[40:50] this evening
[40:51] if we'd bow our hearts. Amen.
[40:55] Father God, we come before you, Lord
[40:57] Jesus. Father God, you brought your
[41:00] word, Father, onto us to heal us, Father
[41:02] God. Lord, every need that we could
[41:05] bring before you, Father, you've already
[41:06] heard it. You've already seen the the
[41:08] consummation of it, Lord. Father, we
[41:11] bring these things knowing, Father God,
[41:13] that you hear our plea. You hear our
[41:16] cry, oh Lord, and you've already gone to
[41:18] work on each and every one of these
[41:20] requests. Father, we praise you, Father,
[41:22] for the word that you've sent unto us.
[41:25] We praise you for the hearing. We praise
[41:26] you for the seeing. We praise you for
[41:28] the doing, Father God. That you would
[41:30] just stir us, Father God, in our spirit,
[41:32] Father, to dig further into your word,
[41:35] to dig further into your presence, Lord
[41:38] God, that we could be found in the
[41:39] courts of your house, Lord, and find
[41:41] favor with you, Lord. Go to each one.
[41:44] Send your Holy Ghost out after him,
[41:46] Lord, Father, and make them well in
[41:48] Jesus Christ's name. For your name is
[41:51] the name above every name, Lord. You are
[41:53] alpha, the Omega, the beginning, and the
[41:55] end, oh Lord. Father, and you've given
[41:58] this unto us, Father. How blessed and
[42:01] precious you are, Lord Jesus, to give
[42:03] this unto your children, Lord. Father,
[42:06] we've asked these things and we know it
[42:07] shall be done. In the name of the Lord
[42:10] Jesus Christ, we praise you, Father God.
[42:12] Amen.
[42:14] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Thank you,
[42:16] brother Brand. Victory is mine. Victory
[42:18] is mine.
[42:20] You know, when she sent me that song, I
[42:22] started looking up. I just found a
[42:24] quote. Brother Brandham says, "And he
[42:26] swore by himself." He said, "Now by
[42:28] faith, brethren, move right into this
[42:30] blood cell with the Lord Jesus where all
[42:33] those redemptive blessings are yours.
[42:36] You're everyone are Christians here
[42:39] tonight." I'm presuming we got any
[42:41] Christians here this evening.
[42:42] He said, "Then if you're Christians, you
[42:44] have a right, a legal right for
[42:46] everything that Christ died for. It's
[42:48] your possession. You own it and it's
[42:50] yours."
[42:51] So I challenge you, don't leave tonight
[42:53] with the devil have and let the devil
[42:55] have something that rightfully belongs
[42:57] to you.
[42:57] Amen.

[46:20] How many's living a life of victory?
[46:22] Amen. By the power of God. Amen. I said,
[46:24] how many's living a life of victory?
[46:27] Amen. Isn't it wonderful to be able to
[46:30] have victory over sin and victory over
[46:33] this flesh and all the challenges that
[46:35] we face? But even though sometimes we go
[46:38] through things that seems like we can't
[46:41] overcome it or can't defeat it, but
[46:43] still yet we know according to the word
[46:44] of God that we're fighting from victory.
[46:47] That's brother Joe, brother Joe's best
[46:48] sermon was fighting from victory. Amen.
[46:51] We're not just fighting for victory, but
[46:53] we're fighting from victory. Amen. So,
[46:55] it's already been a promised word to the
[46:57] believers tonight that God has given us
[46:59] the victory over the devil. You love the
[47:01] Lord tonight.
[47:02] Amen. You love everybody.
[47:04] Amen. Turn around and tell somebody you
[47:06] love them tonight.
[47:07] Amen. Sure. Good to be in the house of
[47:09] the Lord and uh maybe let's just bow our
[47:12] heads before we read the word and just
[47:15] ask the Lord to come. If you have
[47:16] something on your heart, you just need
[47:18] the Lord to come and move. We just want
[47:20] to invite him tonight. And just also
[47:24] remember uh Winnie, brother Charles had
[47:26] sent a message. She was sick. They took
[47:28] took her to the hospital, had some high
[47:30] fever. They're on their way back home
[47:32] now. Just remember her in prayer. Let's
[47:33] just pray together. Gracious heavenly
[47:35] father, Lord, how we love you tonight.
[47:38] And Lord, we thank you, Lord, for
[47:40] another opportunity to come and just to
[47:44] gather around the word of God. Lord,
[47:46] what a wonderful atmosphere, Lord, as
[47:48] the saints of God would gather in this
[47:50] place. And Lord, just to begin to sing
[47:53] songs and every every special that was
[47:56] sung, Lord, the anointing of God moving
[47:59] through this place. And Lord, we are so
[48:01] thankful for that, Lord. And God, just
[48:04] to let us know that you're near, Lord. I
[48:06] know we shouldn't go by feelings, but
[48:08] Lord, we just sure love to feel your
[48:10] presence, Lord. We thank you for all
[48:12] that you do for us. And Lord, we just
[48:14] ask you that you would move in our midst
[48:17] tonight. Lord, I pray you would take
[48:18] this scripture that you put on my heart
[48:20] and Lord, I ask you that you would bring
[48:23] something out of it, Lord, that would be
[48:24] a help to the church. And Lord, I just
[48:27] surrender myself to you tonight, Lord,
[48:28] as a minister of the word. And Lord, I
[48:31] just pray that the audience would do the
[48:33] same thing, Lord, that we could just
[48:34] surrender our hearts to you. And Lord,
[48:36] let you have your way in this service.
[48:38] And Lord, when we leave here, we'll give
[48:40] you the glory for all that you've done.
[48:42] We thank you for all things in the name
[48:44] of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[48:48] Amen. Just sure love the Lord tonight.
[48:52] Amen. We just uh good to be back in in
[48:55] ministering uh tonight. I know we've had
[48:58] uh you know quite a bit of extra help in
[49:01] June. I got picked on a little bit. One
[49:03] of the brothers sent me a message said I
[49:06] was a visiting minister. Now I said,
[49:08] "Well, when it when you only preach four
[49:10] times in one month and that makes you a
[49:12] visitor." Well, I've done something
[49:14] right or I don't I've not made people uh
[49:16] mad at me, I guess. And so, it's good
[49:19] that people want you to to preach. And
[49:21] so, um it makes you feel good that
[49:23] people want to hear you, you know,
[49:24] instead of begging for you not to. I'd
[49:27] rather have you want to hear me than not
[49:28] want to hear. But, uh I trust that we
[49:32] really don't come to hear a man at all,
[49:34] but we just come to hear the word of the
[49:36] Lord. And I believe that we all have
[49:38] that same mindset. And I sure appreciate
[49:40] our our brothers uh that are
[49:43] ministering. We have a lot of ministers
[49:45] uh in our church and it's been a a
[49:47] blessing for the church. So we uh we
[49:50] sure appreciate that. But uh we just
[49:52] want to invite you to the scripture
[49:54] tonight. And we're going to read out of
[49:57] the uh book of Luke and we'll read out
[50:00] of the fifth chapter in the 17th verse.
[50:03] And just give you a moment to turn
[50:05] there. Luke 5 and 17.
[50:09] Amen. How many say it's good to be in
[50:11] the house of the Lord? Amen.
[50:14] Amen. Luke 5:17. We'll give you just a
[50:17] moment to get there.
[50:23] Amen. The Bible says, "And it came to
[50:25] pass
[50:27] on a certain day as he was teaching that
[50:30] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[50:32] law sitting by which were come out of
[50:35] every town of Galilee and Judea and
[50:37] Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was
[50:41] present to heal them." And I'd like to
[50:43] take that scripture tonight and just for
[50:45] a few minutes uh speak on this subject
[50:47] on the presence of a supernatural power.
[50:50] And I'll just allow you to take your
[50:52] seats tonight. And you know, I was uh
[50:54] reading through this uh story this week
[50:57] and and Lord just put this on my heart
[50:59] and I don't guess I've ever took this as
[51:01] a as a a title before, but um you know,
[51:04] I I got to thinking about Jesus sitting
[51:07] in this uh in this place and uh
[51:09] surrounded by so many great men and and
[51:12] uh and no doubt that they had no idea
[51:15] who he was or what he really had
[51:18] represented. and and uh you know I
[51:20] thought about the Old Testament and the
[51:22] scripture and how that the Bible would
[51:24] tell us that before uh that Christ ever
[51:26] came that that the whole Bible is filled
[51:28] with prophecies concerning the coming of
[51:31] our Lord Jesus. And uh when you read
[51:33] about it uh in the the prophets of old,
[51:36] they were inspired by God. They wrote
[51:37] about his coming. You can read it uh all
[51:40] through the Old Testament. You can read
[51:41] in Isaiah he said a virgin shall
[51:43] conceive. Uh in the book of Genesis it
[51:45] said a woman's seed would bruise a
[51:47] serpent's head. In the when God called
[51:49] Abraham, he told Abraham that his seed
[51:52] would number the stars of the heaven and
[51:53] the sands of the sea. And the book of
[51:55] Exodus, it would type him as a spotless
[51:58] lamb. In the book of Psalms, the 8th
[51:59] chapter, it would say that he would be
[52:01] humiliated, but he would also be
[52:04] exalted. In Psalms 22, it says he would
[52:07] be forsaken uh because of the sins of
[52:09] others. And the Bible would also say
[52:11] that he would be born in Bethlehem. As
[52:13] you read through the Bible, you'll find
[52:14] that there's many uh scholars have shown
[52:17] us prophecies that that uh that was
[52:19] fulfilled in Jesus's earthly ministry.
[52:22] In fact, there was there was over 300
[52:24] prophecies in the Old Testament uh that
[52:26] Jesus fulfilled while he was walking
[52:28] upon the earth. And uh and Isaiah would
[52:31] write it like this in the ninth chapter.
[52:32] He said, "Unto us a child is born, and
[52:35] unto us a son is given, and the
[52:37] government shall be upon his shoulder,
[52:39] and his name shall be called wonderful
[52:41] and counselor, the mighty God, the
[52:42] everlasting father, the prince of peace,
[52:45] and of his kingdom, there will be no
[52:47] end." So I thought of how that even
[52:50] though there were so many prophecies
[52:52] concerning his coming that uh there was
[52:54] so many that was written about it, the
[52:56] very things that they read, they they
[52:58] talked about the coming of the Lord
[52:59] Jesus. But uh no matter how many there
[53:01] were that most of the men that lived in
[53:03] that day, the scholars and the Sadducees
[53:05] and Pharisees, but uh but they could
[53:07] still not receive him for who he was.
[53:09] And but Ram says, "We know that that
[53:11] that he was supposed to be a child that
[53:13] was born in that day. For the Bible said
[53:15] a virgin should conceive and bring a
[53:16] child, but it didn't come through any of
[53:19] their systems. So they didn't want
[53:20] anything to do with it. Therefore, they
[53:22] rejected it." Here it was. It was the
[53:24] anointed word of God. It was Emmanuel.
[53:26] It was made flesh among them. And here
[53:28] he stood there. Even uh Jesus when he
[53:30] would take the word he would say you
[53:32] search the scriptures for in them you
[53:34] think that you have eternal life but it
[53:36] is they that are testifying of me. So
[53:38] Jesus would take the very same
[53:40] scriptures that they read and they would
[53:42] talk about what while they were there
[53:44] and how that it was uh it was showing
[53:46] the signs of the time that they were
[53:48] living in and all the things that the
[53:49] scriptures declared. But Jesus would
[53:51] take the same scripture and say but this
[53:53] scripture that you're reading it speaks
[53:54] of me. I wonder how many times that he
[53:56] sat in a temple and heard somebody take
[53:58] a scripture and begin to speak on it and
[54:01] knowing by revelation that that
[54:02] scripture is pertaining to me. And so he
[54:04] he said it testifies of me. Brother said
[54:06] he was thoroughly identified that he was
[54:09] the Messiah, the Messiah to take place
[54:11] in that day and the systems had it so
[54:13] messed up in people's mind uh with
[54:15] systematic rules and so forth till they
[54:17] had made the word of God of no effect.
[54:20] They couldn't see that he was the
[54:22] Messiah. I thought, isn't that something
[54:23] to hear the power of God was sitting
[54:26] right in the midst of them, but still
[54:27] yet they couldn't see that he was the
[54:29] Messiah? The the very things that was
[54:31] prophesied, the the the prophets that
[54:33] they worshiped and the idols that they
[54:35] built of those great prophets of old
[54:37] that uh and the very words of those
[54:39] prophets were being fulfilled, but they
[54:41] couldn't see that he was the Messiah.
[54:43] Here he was sitting in their midst. But
[54:44] brother M said, "But as it was then, so
[54:47] it has done it again." He said, "See, it
[54:49] was bad then, but what about today?" He
[54:51] said here the systems of the world have
[54:53] kept the church from the power of God.
[54:56] And he said and the church cannot run
[54:58] without the power of God through the
[55:00] word of God. So in order for the church
[55:02] to operate and in order for it to
[55:04] function the way that God intended it,
[55:06] the church must have the power of God
[55:08] which comes by the word of God. He says,
[55:10] see, so the Holy Ghost is only when you
[55:12] see the Holy Ghost moving and the power
[55:14] of God moving in the Holy Ghost, it's
[55:16] only confirming the word of God that's
[55:19] been spoke. He says, "See, so the Holy
[55:21] Ghost on display is only confirming
[55:23] God's word." So the anointing is sent to
[55:26] confirm the word. That's what God's
[55:28] looking for. The word to come and then
[55:30] the anointing of God or the power of God
[55:32] that follows after the word, it comes to
[55:34] confirm the word that is being spoken.
[55:36] He said, see, and Jesus was the anointed
[55:38] one. He was the word made flesh. And
[55:40] that's the reason that he walked out
[55:42] there in the days of John the Baptist.
[55:44] Remember the Bible says whenever uh that
[55:46] Jesus walked out into the water of John
[55:48] the Baptist and he received a baptism.
[55:50] He said he went out because the word of
[55:52] the Lord goes to the prophet and it was
[55:54] here was Jesus as the word of God and he
[55:57] came to the prophet. He was baptized by
[55:59] the prophet and then the prophet raised
[56:01] up. He said I must decrease that he
[56:03] could increase. He said and we find that
[56:05] was just God's way of doing it. But did
[56:06] they receive it? No, they they didn't
[56:08] receive it. They should have known it.
[56:10] They should have watched the acts of
[56:12] God. They they should have seen the word
[56:14] fulfilled. They knew the scripture said
[56:16] it, but they couldn't believe it would
[56:18] come that way. You say, "Well, why
[56:20] couldn't they see it that way?" Because
[56:21] these were great sects of people and the
[56:23] Pharisees and the and the Sadducees and,
[56:26] you know, uh if if the Messiah would
[56:28] come and he would be a great religious
[56:30] leader, then certainly he would come
[56:32] through one of our great religious
[56:33] groups after all. But the reality is is
[56:36] that had he come through the Pharisees,
[56:38] how many believe that the Sadducees
[56:40] would have received him? If he came
[56:41] through the Sadducees, how many believes
[56:43] the Pharisees would have received him.
[56:45] See, so it didn't matter which he would
[56:46] have came in, neither the other would
[56:48] receive him. So that ain't the way that
[56:50] God sent him. But I'll just tell you,
[56:52] just like an old country gospel preacher
[56:54] can tell you, but when God brought him,
[56:56] he brought him out of according to
[56:58] prophecy of a little town called
[56:59] Bethlehem. He was born as a baby from a
[57:02] virgin birth. He was born in a manger.
[57:05] But in that child, he grew up in the
[57:07] presence of God. In him was the fullness
[57:10] of the creator God. He w he was the Paul
[57:12] would say he was the image of the
[57:14] invisible God. He was the fullness of
[57:16] the power of God. That's why he walked
[57:19] on water. That's why because it was the
[57:21] anointed uh the anointing confirming the
[57:24] word of God. And he was the word. So if
[57:26] he was the word, then the anointing had
[57:28] to confirm the word. That's why he could
[57:30] walk on water. That's why he turned
[57:32] water into wine. That's why he healed
[57:34] the sick. That's why he cleansed the
[57:36] leper. That's why he made the lame to
[57:37] walk. and the blind to see because the
[57:40] anointing confirmed the word which he
[57:42] was.
[57:43] So the power of God followed his life
[57:46] because he was the word of God and the
[57:48] Holy Ghost confirms the word. So So we
[57:50] see this great supernatural power that
[57:52] was in the life of Jesus Christ. And I
[57:54] I'll just say it like this that in his
[57:56] life he never encountered a demon that
[57:58] he didn't have power over. How many
[58:00] believes that? I don't believe that
[58:02] Jesus ever encount encountered one devil
[58:04] that he didn't have power over. There
[58:05] there wasn't a single demon spirit that
[58:07] he didn't have victory over. But
[58:09] whenever he met one, he had power. He
[58:11] had power to control it. He had power to
[58:14] cast it out. He had power to give it its
[58:16] leave. This is Jesus that had the power
[58:18] of God upon his life. He was the
[58:20] fullness of the power of God. And I'll
[58:22] just say this that when he went to
[58:24] Calvary, that wasn't the end of it. But
[58:26] he went ahead and conquered death and
[58:27] conquered hell and conquered the grave.
[58:30] and he resurrected on the third day
[58:32] proving that the greatest fear that men
[58:34] have had no power over Jesus Christ.
[58:37] That death didn't even have power. It
[58:39] has no power over God. But let me tell
[58:41] you what he done is after he displayed
[58:44] himself in this greatness of power. Then
[58:46] he poured his spirit back upon the
[58:48] believers. The same power that Jesus
[58:51] had, it came back to the church again.
[58:54] That's what got me to this message
[58:56] tonight. And I thought about here the
[58:58] power that was setting in their midst.
[58:59] But Jesus just wouldn't he wouldn't keep
[59:01] it. He didn't take it away. He didn't
[59:03] ascend into glory and and take the power
[59:06] with him. But it was a part of the
[59:07] three-fold purpose of God is to bring
[59:09] that same power and give it to the
[59:11] church of the living God.
[59:13] You know, the other day I was or here
[59:15] while back I was looking at at buying a
[59:17] life insurance and what it was designed
[59:19] to do. And I I know many of you maybe
[59:22] have done that same thing. But but
[59:23] whenever I was talking to the lady about
[59:25] the life insurance and you know there's
[59:26] some questions uh that I had concerning
[59:28] it. And I asked her I said well how much
[59:30] coverage of life insurance should I buy?
[59:33] You know of course they have they have
[59:35] really good advice and and she said well
[59:37] you want to buy enough coverage that so
[59:40] that your family can maintain the same
[59:42] lifestyle that they had before you died.
[59:45] says, "So whatever you have built for
[59:47] them and the lifestyle that you have
[59:49] created, then you want to have enough
[59:50] coverage in your life insurance that
[59:52] whenever you're gone that they can
[59:54] maintain that same lifestyle." I thought
[59:56] I thought, "Well, that that's pretty
[59:57] good right there." And you she said I
[59:59] said, "Well, you know, I mean, well, I'm
[1:00:01] trying to get a number out of you. You
[1:00:02] know what what we could do." And they
[1:00:04] look at you funny when you want to get a
[1:00:06] 100,000 on you and 5 million on your
[1:00:08] wife. you know, you I didn't really do
[1:00:09] that, but but but they they they she
[1:00:11] said, "You want to have something that
[1:00:13] you can maintain that lifestyle and or
[1:00:15] or that they could carry on the same
[1:00:16] lifestyle." And I said, "Well, that's
[1:00:18] good. Well, how much does that cost?"
[1:00:19] She said, "Well, it really doesn't
[1:00:20] matter how much it costs. It matters how
[1:00:22] much you care about your family." Well,
[1:00:24] that kind of struck a chord with me to
[1:00:26] think about how how much you care about
[1:00:28] your family. I thought, "M, that would
[1:00:30] preach right there." to think about here
[1:00:32] that the church is a recipient of a life
[1:00:35] insurance policy that was held by Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ. Brother Mark, I'm telling you
[1:00:39] tonight that he took out a policy before
[1:00:41] his death to make sure that his family
[1:00:43] could maintain the same lifestyle that
[1:00:46] they had while he was alive. Let me tell
[1:00:48] you why. Because he was a God that
[1:00:50] cares. If you care about your family,
[1:00:52] then you'll take care of them after
[1:00:53] you're gone. You know, I believe that we
[1:00:55] have a God that cares. I tell you what
[1:00:56] the Bible said. He said, "Fear not, for
[1:00:58] I have redeemed you. I have called you
[1:01:00] by name and thou art mine. When you pass
[1:01:02] through waters, I'll be with you. And
[1:01:04] when you go through rivers, they shall
[1:01:06] not overflow thee. When you walk through
[1:01:08] fire, you shall not be burned, and
[1:01:09] neither shall flame kindle upon thee.
[1:01:12] Even Peter would say it like this. He
[1:01:13] says, "Cast all your cares upon him, for
[1:01:16] he carth for you." I thought, "My, if we
[1:01:19] have a God that cares about us, I'm
[1:01:22] talking about a God that cares about
[1:01:23] you. If he cares about his family, then
[1:01:26] don't you think when he took a policy
[1:01:28] out on you that he would make sure that
[1:01:30] there was enough in the policy that the
[1:01:32] believers could maintain the same
[1:01:34] lifestyle that they were accustomed to?
[1:01:36] I thought my well then what kind of
[1:01:37] lifestyle were they accustomed to when
[1:01:39] Jesus was walking on the earth? Let me
[1:01:41] tell you what they were accustomed to.
[1:01:43] They were accustomed to the sick when
[1:01:45] they came before him. They left out
[1:01:46] healed. They were accustomed to those
[1:01:48] that were tormented by demons to be
[1:01:50] delivered from demonic powers. They
[1:01:52] weren't accustomed to living in
[1:01:54] depression. They weren't accustomed to
[1:01:56] living under anxiety. They weren't
[1:01:57] accustomed to be living defeated lives.
[1:02:00] But they sold all that they had. And
[1:02:02] they followed Jesus. And they had a
[1:02:03] lifestyle of the supernatural that
[1:02:06] followed about their lives. And I'm here
[1:02:07] to tell you tonight that when our Jesus
[1:02:09] took out a policy upon his life, he made
[1:02:12] sure that when he left this earth her
[1:02:15] that they had the same benefits that
[1:02:17] they had. They could they could carry on
[1:02:19] that same lifestyle even when he was
[1:02:21] gone. I believe this tonight that we
[1:02:23] could carry out that same power of God
[1:02:25] was poured back on the church. But you
[1:02:27] know something about a life insurance
[1:02:29] policy when you buy it. There's one
[1:02:30] thing they will not let you purchase it
[1:02:32] if you don't have. Every life insurance
[1:02:35] it must have a beneficiary. You can't
[1:02:38] take the policy out if you don't have a
[1:02:40] beneficiary to put on it. I tell you
[1:02:42] what brother said. He said, "And when
[1:02:43] any man or woman comes to Christ in the
[1:02:46] fullness of the assurance of his death,
[1:02:48] burial, and resurrection, then he is the
[1:02:50] beneficiary to every redemptive blessing
[1:02:53] that Jesus died for." And he gives the
[1:02:56] checkbook with Jesus's name wrote on the
[1:02:58] bottom of every one of them, "Ask the
[1:03:00] father anything in my name. And if you
[1:03:02] invite in me and my words in you, you
[1:03:04] ask what you will and it'll be done for
[1:03:06] you." Now, isn't that powerful tonight
[1:03:08] to think that here we are the
[1:03:09] beneficiaries of a policy that was held
[1:03:12] by Jesus Christ. And in that policy, he
[1:03:15] put every redemptive blessing. He made
[1:03:17] sure that he had enough in there that he
[1:03:19] was gone. There would be enough to go
[1:03:21] around. He made sure that we didn't have
[1:03:23] to wander around in the darkness of Leoa
[1:03:25] and not have a god to turn to. But he
[1:03:28] made sure the very same power that was
[1:03:30] upon the earth, the life that the church
[1:03:32] was accustomed to could still be lived
[1:03:34] out today. I believe that.
[1:03:37] Amen.
[1:03:37] He made a policy that would and and gave
[1:03:40] a checkbook that we had a ride. I don't
[1:03:42] know about y'all, but you may not have
[1:03:44] ever experienced it. But let me tell you
[1:03:45] why I preach it. Because I've lived out
[1:03:47] that experience. I wrote that check out
[1:03:49] and put it on my bed one night when me
[1:03:51] and my wife was going through so much
[1:03:52] financial trouble that we didn't have no
[1:03:54] way out. A and it looked like we would
[1:03:57] lose everything that we had. And we took
[1:03:59] a little cardboard check that somebody
[1:04:00] had gave us and we wrote it out in
[1:04:02] faith. Everything that we needed. Three
[1:04:04] things I wrote on there and I put it on.
[1:04:06] We had prayer over it and I put it on my
[1:04:08] bed and it stayed there for weeks and
[1:04:10] weeks and weeks. But let me tell you
[1:04:12] what happened. One day just a few months
[1:04:13] later, brother Mah, I got a phone call
[1:04:16] and part of it left. I got another phone
[1:04:18] call and another part of it left. And
[1:04:19] because both of those left, the other
[1:04:21] people just left the rest of it alone.
[1:04:23] And everything I wrote on there, God
[1:04:25] gave to me. It was something I couldn't
[1:04:27] afford. It was something I couldn't pay
[1:04:29] for at the best efforts that I had and
[1:04:32] the greatest merit that I could have. I
[1:04:34] could not achieve it, but God achieved
[1:04:35] it.
[1:04:36] He had a check that was signed by Jesus
[1:04:38] Christ. I took that literally one day.
[1:04:41] You know, you know, we we take it's not
[1:04:43] just a metaphor, but I took it literally
[1:04:45] and I wrote it out and I prayed over it.
[1:04:47] I believe that that's the kind of God
[1:04:48] that we serve. But Mark, he said he has
[1:04:50] a checkbook. Not just a check, but he
[1:04:52] gave you a checkbook. You know the
[1:04:54] difference between a check and a
[1:04:55] checkbook? See, a check you can only
[1:04:56] write one time, but a checkbook, it has
[1:04:59] a lot of checks in it. That means when
[1:05:00] you need something today, you can write
[1:05:02] out a check. If you need something
[1:05:03] tomorrow, you can write out another
[1:05:04] check. If you need something the next
[1:05:06] day, you can write out another check.
[1:05:07] And I've got news for you. You're
[1:05:09] writing checks on a bank account that
[1:05:11] can't be overdrafted. It can't be
[1:05:13] overdrawn. I'm talking about the one
[1:05:15] that was given to you by a father that
[1:05:17] owns a cattle on a thousand hills. He
[1:05:19] said, "Don't just come to me with little
[1:05:21] things, but anything you have need of,
[1:05:23] cast your cares upon me." He's a God
[1:05:25] that is able to give. Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] He said, "We're the beneficiaries
[1:05:31] of every redemptive blessing that Jesus
[1:05:33] died for." But you know, there's
[1:05:35] something about these policies that are
[1:05:37] written. I found this powerful that in a
[1:05:39] policy, there's a there's a there's a
[1:05:41] term in the contract, it's called the
[1:05:43] doctrine of contrauma or prophenum,
[1:05:46] which actually it means that in a
[1:05:48] contract, a life insurance contract or
[1:05:50] or any contract, that the language must
[1:05:52] be able to be understood by the
[1:05:54] beneficiary.
[1:05:55] Oh, hallelujah. There was a man that was
[1:05:57] that was uh that had uh done some
[1:05:59] skydiving. I looked this up because I
[1:06:01] make sure skydiving didn't cancel my
[1:06:02] life insurance. And there was a man that
[1:06:04] that had went skydiving and and he had
[1:06:06] died in the act of skydiving and they
[1:06:08] denied his claim on life insurance. And
[1:06:10] his his family went back and and they
[1:06:12] actually used this very law to be able
[1:06:14] to get the benefits that he of his life
[1:06:17] insurance because the contract was
[1:06:18] written in a way that he didn't know
[1:06:20] that he couldn't go skydiving. it it it
[1:06:22] talked about something descent from a
[1:06:24] plane and and all this all this wording,
[1:06:26] but it was in a way that the a common
[1:06:28] man wouldn't even understand it as to
[1:06:29] that what it was. And so the judge found
[1:06:32] in favor of the of the of the family
[1:06:35] because the contract was written in a
[1:06:37] way that they could not understand. So
[1:06:39] that's actually a law in the United
[1:06:40] States that any contract if it goes to
[1:06:43] court that the judgment would be in
[1:06:45] favor of the one that did not write it.
[1:06:47] So if you don't understand it or it was
[1:06:48] something that I believe that God's that
[1:06:50] kind of a God anyway. I believe he's a
[1:06:52] just God and and I don't believe that
[1:06:53] God is going to hold things to our
[1:06:55] charge that you didn't know or that you
[1:06:57] didn't have knowledge of or that you did
[1:06:59] or that you didn't understand. I believe
[1:07:01] that God is a just God and I believe I
[1:07:03] believe that he brings the word of God
[1:07:04] and gives us an opportunity. It's God's
[1:07:06] purpose that every man would be saved.
[1:07:09] But see, the benefits had to be easily
[1:07:12] understood. You know, I got to thinking
[1:07:13] about what God has given us. And you
[1:07:15] know, the Bible makes it very plain.
[1:07:16] David said, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:07:18] and forget not all of his benefits." He
[1:07:21] forgives all of thine iniquities, and he
[1:07:23] heals all of thy diseases. Isn't it
[1:07:26] something that here he ties healing and
[1:07:28] forgiveness together? And so, so you see
[1:07:30] it now, now he's not just talking about
[1:07:32] uh talking about spiritual healing, but
[1:07:34] he's actually talking about healing in
[1:07:35] our natural body. He said, I know many
[1:07:37] take this scripture and say, "Well, it's
[1:07:39] talking about spiritual healing. He
[1:07:40] heals our diseases and he forgives our
[1:07:42] sins because people don't believe in
[1:07:44] healing anymore." But it's actually
[1:07:45] talking about our natural body. How many
[1:07:47] knows that? See, see, sickness came
[1:07:49] after the fall. Can I just show you
[1:07:50] something? Sickness came after the fall
[1:07:52] in the Garden of Eden. Remember,
[1:07:54] remember when sin came in, it was
[1:07:55] unbelief. They didn't believe that or or
[1:07:58] Eve didn't believe that God was going to
[1:07:59] keep his word. The devil convinced her
[1:08:01] that God wouldn't keep his word. And
[1:08:02] because unbelief entered into the
[1:08:04] garden, it caused man to fall. And with
[1:08:07] that spirit of unbelief came the spirit
[1:08:09] of sicknesses and diseases and all those
[1:08:11] things came into human flesh that would
[1:08:14] bring a human being to the very death
[1:08:16] that would be the curse of the fall in
[1:08:18] the garden garden in the first place. So
[1:08:20] now, ever since the fall, our bodies
[1:08:22] that were meant to be created by the
[1:08:24] spoken word and our bodies, those great
[1:08:26] theophanies that we bypass to be able to
[1:08:28] come to this earth that now our bodies
[1:08:30] are made of this flesh a and that
[1:08:33] they're come from the dust of the ground
[1:08:34] of a fallen earth. That's where we come
[1:08:37] from. And now because we come out of
[1:08:39] this condition, brother Mark, that now
[1:08:41] that we are we are battling spirits and
[1:08:43] those spirits bring sicknesses upon our
[1:08:45] body. How many believe that, brother
[1:08:46] Bam? But Abam talked that many times and
[1:08:48] I I I've preached it before, but but he
[1:08:50] would talk about a deaf person that
[1:08:51] would come in. He called it a deaf
[1:08:53] spirit. When they come that that
[1:08:54] couldn't speak, it was a dumb spirit or
[1:08:56] a or a blind spirit. It was something he
[1:08:58] would talk about the spirit that would
[1:09:00] come in and wrap around a person's
[1:09:02] nerve. And to keep them from being being
[1:09:04] able to be healed, I I listened to one
[1:09:06] where he was talking to a woman that had
[1:09:08] been healed from being deaf and she came
[1:09:10] through the prayer line again. She had
[1:09:11] already received healing uh for her
[1:09:13] years. And whenever she left out of the
[1:09:15] prayer line, he said that woman had been
[1:09:16] under surgery and every came that
[1:09:18] everything that came. He said, "But if
[1:09:20] she'll only just have faith, it'll leave
[1:09:22] her." See, she had already been healed,
[1:09:23] but she came through the line to be
[1:09:24] healed of cancer. He said, "She's
[1:09:26] already been healed. Everything came."
[1:09:28] He said, "If she'll have faith, it'll
[1:09:29] leave her and be gone." He said, "Now
[1:09:31] it's gone now. Just keep her away from
[1:09:34] the unbelievers and things. And the
[1:09:35] doctors has told her there's no hope at
[1:09:37] all that they just give her up." He
[1:09:39] said, "But she used to be deaf, but now
[1:09:41] she hears." And just as sure as that
[1:09:44] deaf spirit went out of her, then the
[1:09:46] cancer life went from her and now she's
[1:09:49] going to live. So here he shows us that
[1:09:51] this was what what was inside of her was
[1:09:54] a life form. It was a spirit. This is a
[1:09:56] a demonic spirit. This is something that
[1:09:58] lives. They move around. They're they're
[1:10:01] in and out of the building. They're
[1:10:02] they're everywhere you go. I know. I
[1:10:04] know. We get so worried about the
[1:10:05] natural things and things we eat and
[1:10:07] things we put in our body and the things
[1:10:09] we go. But friends, I got news for you.
[1:10:10] If that's all you're worried about,
[1:10:12] you're in for a great you're in for a
[1:10:13] great problem because the greater
[1:10:15] problem is the spirits that we face.
[1:10:17] That that's the the demonic spirit that
[1:10:19] would come and bring that sickness or or
[1:10:22] something to a human body. I I I'll just
[1:10:23] say it like it is because many things
[1:10:25] that we call health problems are
[1:10:27] actually spiritual problems.
[1:10:31] Many things we call health problems are
[1:10:32] not health problems at all. They're
[1:10:34] spiritual problems. Many things that we
[1:10:36] call emotional problems are really
[1:10:38] spiritual problems.
[1:10:39] You ever take somebody that's depressed
[1:10:41] all the time and you know, well, I've
[1:10:42] got an emotional disorder and I you know
[1:10:44] this depression, you know what the
[1:10:45] doctor does? The doctor gives them a
[1:10:47] bottle of anti-depressants. And so
[1:10:49] they'll say you take that and and what
[1:10:51] it'll do is it it'll affect the
[1:10:52] neurotransmitters in your brain and and
[1:10:54] and the chemicals in your brain and
[1:10:56] we'll we'll try to bring a balance to
[1:10:58] your life. And I I was reading today of
[1:11:00] how the the withdrawals that people get
[1:11:02] trying to get off anti-depressants wind
[1:11:04] up committing suicide and and even
[1:11:06] taking the lives of other family members
[1:11:08] and all kinds of things of people that
[1:11:10] were hooked on anti-depressants. I
[1:11:11] thought my if they they could only
[1:11:13] realize that depression this is not just
[1:11:15] some chemical imbalance but it is a
[1:11:18] spirit that is tormenting a life. It's a
[1:11:21] spirit that caused an a chemical. That's
[1:11:23] why it took a prophet of God to look
[1:11:25] into a life and they say well this was
[1:11:27] the condition or this is the symptom or
[1:11:30] this is the problem. He said but there's
[1:11:31] a spirit that caused it. There's
[1:11:33] something that comes into our life that
[1:11:34] causes uh things to take place. And you
[1:11:37] know we could realize it tonight that
[1:11:39] that depression is a demon. How many
[1:11:41] knows that anger is a demon? That's what
[1:11:43] was matter with that man that Jesus went
[1:11:45] to that gather. He was so filled with
[1:11:47] demonic spirits that he would that that
[1:11:49] people are afraid of him. They had him
[1:11:51] out living in caves. He couldn't even
[1:11:52] live in society. You could say, "Well,
[1:11:54] you can give him all the medicine you
[1:11:56] want to. It would never change him. You
[1:11:58] can give him all the the psychotic
[1:11:59] medicine and the and all the pills. It
[1:12:01] would never change him. All it took was
[1:12:03] one minute in the presence of Jesus
[1:12:05] Christ. And the spirits that was upon
[1:12:07] him had to flee. They went into a bunch
[1:12:09] of swine. And that man became the
[1:12:11] greatest missionary that the capitalist
[1:12:13] had ever seen. The Bible said many
[1:12:15] believed on God because of his
[1:12:17] testimony.
[1:12:19] Because it was a demonic spirit.
[1:12:22] And Jesus freed him of the spirits. I
[1:12:23] got news for you today that he's still
[1:12:25] doing the same thing.
[1:12:26] Amen.
[1:12:27] By the word of God.
[1:12:28] Amen.
[1:12:29] You may not realize it tonight, but even
[1:12:31] that just listening to the word that
[1:12:33] things are being removed from our lives.
[1:12:36] when you come in the house of God and
[1:12:38] listen to the preaching of the word of
[1:12:39] God that there are there are things that
[1:12:41] are leaving our lives and spirits and
[1:12:44] tormentors and things if you could see
[1:12:45] in a spiritual realm if you had a a
[1:12:47] spiritual eye tonight to see the uh the
[1:12:50] the the spirits that leave people well
[1:12:51] just to just to sit in a song service
[1:12:54] and hear somebody start singing and
[1:12:56] maybe you come in you say well why is it
[1:12:58] I came in church all depressed and I
[1:13:00] barely got here I didn't even want to
[1:13:01] come and I I was fighting with my wife
[1:13:03] to get in the door but when the songs
[1:13:05] start the piano starts playing and the
[1:13:07] songs start being sung. All of a sudden,
[1:13:09] I'm happy again. Well, maybe that song
[1:13:11] just makes me happy, but that ain't it
[1:13:12] at all. But it's an atmosphere of the
[1:13:15] Holy Ghost that's being created. And the
[1:13:17] spirit that caused you to feel that way
[1:13:19] that caused you to be depressed and
[1:13:21] robbed you of your joy and kept you from
[1:13:23] wanting to come to church. And that
[1:13:25] spirit, it ain't welcome in that
[1:13:26] atmosphere. So, it makes its lead. All
[1:13:28] of a sudden, the joy is restored and you
[1:13:31] start shouting and clapping and saying
[1:13:33] amen and dancing in the house of God
[1:13:35] when you didn't feel like it before
[1:13:37] because the presence of God still has
[1:13:39] power over demonic spirit.
[1:13:42] I'm just telling you from a spiritual
[1:13:44] realm.
[1:13:45] Amen.
[1:13:45] It still has power over demonic spirits.
[1:13:48] Just listening to the word of God,
[1:13:50] things leave your life.
[1:13:52] Sitting in the presence of God, things
[1:13:54] they leave our life. And you know the
[1:13:55] reality is is because there is something
[1:13:57] wrong with our old carnal nature.
[1:14:00] Can I just preach it,
[1:14:01] brother Bam? When he compared our nature
[1:14:03] to Christ, here's what he said. He said
[1:14:05] he had a sinless nature. It expressed
[1:14:07] what he was. And his sinless nature, God
[1:14:09] expressed himself through that sinless
[1:14:11] nature, it shows that our nature is
[1:14:13] evil. And no matter how much we try to
[1:14:15] patch it up, how much we try to
[1:14:17] indocument it with other things, it's
[1:14:18] got to become sinless like his was. And
[1:14:21] then God's word can flow through it.
[1:14:23] See, we have a nature not like Christ.
[1:14:25] He said, see, his sinless nature
[1:14:27] expressed the word of God so much that
[1:14:29] he and the word were one. He said, "I
[1:14:31] and my father are one. I do always that
[1:14:33] which pleases him." He was so perfect in
[1:14:36] the image of God until he and God was
[1:14:37] the express same thing. He was the
[1:14:39] flesh, the son, the express the deity of
[1:14:41] God. So that made him deity in a man in
[1:14:44] order to redeem a man. He and the word
[1:14:47] were one. Isn't that what the Bible
[1:14:48] said? In the beginning was the word. The
[1:14:50] word was with God and the word was made
[1:14:52] flesh. But remember said he was the
[1:14:54] word. They became one. The word could
[1:14:56] express and could show to the world the
[1:14:58] example of what a man should be. He
[1:15:01] said, "And man can't be that in
[1:15:03] himself."
[1:15:04] Can I read that again? Man can't be that
[1:15:06] in himself. There's no way you can
[1:15:08] educate to it. You can't join it. You
[1:15:11] can't baptize it. There's no way of
[1:15:13] doing nothing to it only to kill that
[1:15:15] old nature and let it be born again and
[1:15:17] a new nature come in. That's the only
[1:15:19] way is to kill the nature of yourself
[1:15:21] that you might become something else
[1:15:23] that you might become spiritual to take
[1:15:26] off take off this carnal nature and let
[1:15:28] a spiritual nature
[1:15:30] come in. He said and then the word
[1:15:31] becomes a living thing. It expresses
[1:15:34] itself through you and then you're
[1:15:36] looking in the looking glass. People see
[1:15:37] you as a mirror. He said you know God
[1:15:39] has made a way. People don't read the
[1:15:41] Bible anymore. So God has made you a
[1:15:43] Bible. He said then people are looking
[1:15:44] at you. You're expressing the very image
[1:15:47] of God. the word becomes a living thing
[1:15:50] again.
[1:15:50] Hallelujah.
[1:15:51] See, but even with a nature change, but
[1:15:53] Mark, sometimes because we are spiritual
[1:15:55] beings
[1:15:56] that even with a nature change, we're
[1:15:58] subjected to spirits every day.
[1:16:01] Everywhere we go, we're subjected to
[1:16:02] spirits. They they're they're looking
[1:16:04] for ways to to torment. And many times
[1:16:07] there's things in our lives that allow
[1:16:09] demonic spirits to abide in your life.
[1:16:12] Amen.
[1:16:13] You ever thought of that? Many many
[1:16:14] times it's things that we do or things
[1:16:16] that we don't do that allows demonic
[1:16:18] spirits to abide in you.
[1:16:21] This is what David said. He said he
[1:16:23] forgives our sins and heals our
[1:16:25] diseases.
[1:16:26] Think of it. In other words, that God
[1:16:28] has power over every spirit.
[1:16:30] I got to looking at this this this tie
[1:16:33] that all the way through the scriptures
[1:16:34] that you find that forgiveness and
[1:16:37] healing are always tied together.
[1:16:39] You ever noticed that here? Whenever
[1:16:41] Luke is telling the story, he said when
[1:16:43] Jesus came in, he was sitting by the
[1:16:45] doctors of the law, every town of
[1:16:47] Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, and the power
[1:16:49] of the Lord was present to heal them.
[1:16:51] And here they were sitting in this great
[1:16:53] meeting and there were, you know, the
[1:16:55] Bible would tell the story how that
[1:16:56] there was so many people there that
[1:16:58] there was no way to get in. There was
[1:17:00] they were packed in there. Here he was
[1:17:01] sitting in the middle of this uh uh this
[1:17:04] place and uh little building that they
[1:17:06] had and and there was no way to get in,
[1:17:08] but they brought there was a some
[1:17:09] friends that brought a man to receive
[1:17:11] his healing.
[1:17:12] And when they came in, they found there
[1:17:13] was no way in the door. There was no way
[1:17:15] to get through the crowd there. There
[1:17:16] was no way to press their way into where
[1:17:18] he was. And so they climbed up on the
[1:17:20] roof of the building. They wasn't
[1:17:21] willing to give up. So they climbed up
[1:17:23] on the roof of the building. They went
[1:17:24] all the way to where he was sitting.
[1:17:26] Remember, it was the power of the Lord
[1:17:29] present to heal them.
[1:17:30] Amen. And somebody recognized that on
[1:17:32] the outside. And I thought all these men
[1:17:34] that were sitting around that would mock
[1:17:36] and make fun and ridicule and and
[1:17:38] persecute for for what he was saying or
[1:17:40] what he was teaching. But there was one
[1:17:42] that was on the outside that was looking
[1:17:44] for a way to get in his presence.
[1:17:46] Brother Mark. And they went all the way
[1:17:48] across the top of the building and took
[1:17:49] the thatch off of the roof and they tied
[1:17:51] ropes to his bed and they lowered their
[1:17:54] friend down to where Jesus was. And the
[1:17:57] Bible says when Jesus saw their faith,
[1:17:59] he looked at the man. Here they were
[1:18:01] looking for his healing. He was sick
[1:18:03] with Pauly. He needed a touch from the
[1:18:05] Lord. The power of God was present to
[1:18:07] heal. They recognized it as a
[1:18:09] supernatural power. They lowered him
[1:18:11] down right in his presence. And when
[1:18:13] Jesus saw him, he saw their faith. He
[1:18:15] said, "Man, I forgive you of your sins."
[1:18:18] Hallelujah.
[1:18:20] The Pharisees
[1:18:21] begin to make fun.
[1:18:23] Forgive you of your sins. What kind of
[1:18:26] man has the right to say, "I forgive you
[1:18:29] of your sins?" What kind of man would
[1:18:31] have the right to forgive somebody of
[1:18:33] their trespasses? Only a God could could
[1:18:36] forgive somebody of their sins.
[1:18:38] But the Bible said here, when they begin
[1:18:40] to think those things, Jesus perceived
[1:18:42] their thoughts.
[1:18:44] And he says, "Why do you think this in
[1:18:46] your heart? Is it easier for me to say,
[1:18:50] thy sins be forgiven you, or take up
[1:18:52] your bed and walk?"
[1:18:53] Hallelujah. He he challenged them with a
[1:18:56] question, which one would be easier for
[1:18:58] me to say?
[1:18:59] Amen.
[1:18:59] Of course, it would be much easier to
[1:19:01] say your sins are forgiven because
[1:19:03] nobody's there to prove whether the sins
[1:19:05] were really forgiven or not.
[1:19:06] Amen.
[1:19:06] He said, "So, which is easier to say,
[1:19:08] thy sins be forgiven,
[1:19:10] or take up your bed and walk?"
[1:19:12] And then he turned to the man and he
[1:19:14] said, "But that you may know that the
[1:19:15] son of man has power on earth to forgive
[1:19:18] sins."
[1:19:18] Hallelujah. He said to the sick of
[1:19:20] Pauly, I say unto thee, arise and take
[1:19:22] up thy couch and go into thy house. And
[1:19:24] the Bible said, immediately the man rose
[1:19:27] before them, and he took that which
[1:19:29] where he lay and he departed into his
[1:19:31] own house glorifying God.
[1:19:33] I thought my he heard about the presence
[1:19:36] of a supernatural power. They fought
[1:19:38] their way. He couldn't even walk
[1:19:39] himself. I thought, hear that man, maybe
[1:19:41] he had to call his friends. I don't have
[1:19:43] no way to get there. I don't have no way
[1:19:45] to find it. But I've heard that
[1:19:47] somewhere that there's a God that is
[1:19:49] present, that is able to heal. If you
[1:19:51] can help me, if you can do me a favor,
[1:19:53] if you had to carry me, whatever you
[1:19:55] have to do, get me in the presence of
[1:19:57] one that could bring my healing.
[1:19:59] Brother Mark, what he found out is the
[1:20:02] same Jesus that could heal was the same
[1:20:04] Jesus that could forgive. When they came
[1:20:06] to receive his healing, the power of the
[1:20:08] Lord, the Bible said, was present to
[1:20:10] heal. And he displayed it in the form of
[1:20:13] forgiveness.
[1:20:15] Isn't that powerful? The power that was
[1:20:17] present to heal was displayed in the
[1:20:19] form of forgiveness. In other words,
[1:20:21] that means the same power that forgives
[1:20:23] sin is the same power that gives
[1:20:25] healing. That means if God can forgive,
[1:20:27] then God can heal. And if God can heal,
[1:20:29] then God can forgive.
[1:20:30] You'll never convince me of anything
[1:20:32] else.
[1:20:33] God's still a healer. If he can forgive
[1:20:35] us sins, he can still heal. Abraham
[1:20:37] said, but the Jews rejected it, but the
[1:20:39] Gentiles received it. He said, see, it
[1:20:41] was a type of the bride. He said he
[1:20:43] would call a people out of the Gentiles
[1:20:45] for his name. Amen.
[1:20:46] And the bride of Jesus Christ will be
[1:20:48] Mrs. Jesus Christ and she'll be baptized
[1:20:51] in his spirit, in his name, and filled
[1:20:54] with his power.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] Robed in his righteousness,
[1:20:58] filled with his power. She'll be the
[1:21:00] very same thing that he was. You know
[1:21:02] what that means? That means that that
[1:21:03] that in you is the power to heal and the
[1:21:06] power to be healed.
[1:21:07] Yes, sir.
[1:21:08] In you is the power to forgive and the
[1:21:10] power to be forgiven. Amen.
[1:21:12] Said because you'll be have the same
[1:21:14] power that Jesus had.
[1:21:17] But watch how these spirits are linked
[1:21:19] together in our natural bodies. You
[1:21:21] know, I thought thought about this. Even
[1:21:23] science found evidence of it that you
[1:21:25] know, you could take a person that was
[1:21:27] that w that was mad or or angry at
[1:21:29] somebody had had a something
[1:21:31] circumstances or something that had
[1:21:33] happened in their life. Maybe it's
[1:21:35] something that happened as a child or
[1:21:37] you know something that you know when
[1:21:39] you was a little girl, a little boy, but
[1:21:40] some but but things happen in our life
[1:21:42] and and maybe somebody that did you
[1:21:44] wrong and and we hold that in our spirit
[1:21:47] for many years.
[1:21:48] Yeah.
[1:21:49] People there they may not know it but
[1:21:50] they hold an anger. There's a resentment
[1:21:52] towards it or towards a certain person
[1:21:54] or you can't even say somebody's name
[1:21:56] without that rising up. You know it's a
[1:21:58] resentment towards them and it's being
[1:22:00] held in our spirit. And I was reading a
[1:22:01] study on anger and emotional problems
[1:22:03] and the effects that it had on on mental
[1:22:05] health. And uh and there was actually a
[1:22:07] study in John Hopkins University. It it
[1:22:10] said that chronic anger it it it causes
[1:22:13] people to be put in a fight orflight
[1:22:14] mode which results in numerous changes
[1:22:17] in their heart rate, their blood
[1:22:18] pressure, and their immune response
[1:22:20] system. So when a person they're finding
[1:22:22] somebody that had anger and had had some
[1:22:24] kind of issues, I I I know this seems
[1:22:26] like it ain't nothing, but I'm preaching
[1:22:28] to you. I'm talking about something
[1:22:29] that's been there for a long time or
[1:22:31] some resentment or or something that was
[1:22:33] in your spirit that that you hold there
[1:22:35] and it changes our heart rate, blood
[1:22:37] pressure, immune response. And it showed
[1:22:39] that those changes then increase the
[1:22:41] risk of depression, the risk of heart
[1:22:43] disease, the risk of diabetes and among
[1:22:46] other conditions just because you hold
[1:22:48] that in your spirit. So something that
[1:22:50] took place in your life 40 years ago, 30
[1:22:53] years ago, and and it's a chronic anger,
[1:22:56] a resentment, something something that
[1:22:57] has been built up and maybe somebody
[1:22:59] done you really wrong. I'm just going to
[1:23:01] preach anyway, but maybe somebody done
[1:23:02] you really wrong and maybe they ought
[1:23:04] condemned for it and maybe they should
[1:23:06] have been punished for it and maybe they
[1:23:08] should have a lot of things should have
[1:23:09] happened that didn't happen the way that
[1:23:11] you thought it should happen. But
[1:23:12] because you hold that in your spirit
[1:23:15] Yes, sir. So now you're more susceptible
[1:23:17] to heart disease and and diabetes and
[1:23:20] and and depression and all these disease
[1:23:22] just for being mad or holding a grudge
[1:23:25] in the and and and and being tore up in
[1:23:28] your spirit that eventually it takes a
[1:23:29] toll on your natural body.
[1:23:32] Isn't that something to break down your
[1:23:34] natural body? But listen to the other
[1:23:36] part. It said, "But forgiveness calms
[1:23:39] our stress levels
[1:23:41] and it leads to an improved health."
[1:23:43] Hallelujah.
[1:23:44] What a study to do that when a person
[1:23:46] could forgive somebody from their heart.
[1:23:49] It would calm that. It would take it
[1:23:51] from their heart. It relieves it from
[1:23:53] their spirit. The good part it says, see
[1:23:55] the studies have found that the active
[1:23:57] forgiveness forgiveness can actually
[1:23:59] reap huge rewards for your health.
[1:24:00] Lowering the risk of heart attack,
[1:24:02] improving cholesterol levels and sleep,
[1:24:04] reducing pain, blood pressure, levels of
[1:24:06] anxiety, depression and stress. Yeah.
[1:24:09] I thought here even by scientific study
[1:24:12] that forgiveness releases pressures off
[1:24:14] your life, releases the risk of
[1:24:16] sickness, the risk of heart disease. I
[1:24:18] thought, isn't it something that just to
[1:24:20] forgive somebody
[1:24:21] Hallelujah
[1:24:22] can bring healing to your body.
[1:24:24] It makes you less susceptible to
[1:24:26] diseases. I I don't know about y'all,
[1:24:28] but I thought how how powerful it it is
[1:24:30] to know that when you forgive somebody
[1:24:33] that it's it it actually sets you free.
[1:24:35] When you forgive somebody, it's it
[1:24:37] brings liberty to you. And that ain't
[1:24:40] that ain't that that ain't all it does.
[1:24:41] But I believe that if we have that same
[1:24:43] power, God that God in our lives, then
[1:24:46] we have the ability to heal and to
[1:24:48] forgive. The Bible said, "Let this mind
[1:24:50] be in you that was in Christ Jesus."
[1:24:52] Amen.
[1:24:53] Listen what Paul said. He said, "As the
[1:24:55] elect of God," he said, "put on bows of
[1:24:58] mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind,
[1:25:01] meekness, longsuffering."
[1:25:02] Amen. As the elect of God, forbear one
[1:25:04] another and forgive one another. If any
[1:25:06] man quarrel against you, even as Christ
[1:25:08] forgave you, so also do you. Above all
[1:25:11] things, put on charity. In other words,
[1:25:13] love. Love your love your neighbors.
[1:25:15] Love your brothers. Jesus take it a step
[1:25:17] further. He said, "And love your enemies
[1:25:20] and do good and lendo ho lend hoping for
[1:25:22] nothing again. And your reward shall be
[1:25:25] great and you shall be the children of
[1:25:26] the highest. For he is kind." I love
[1:25:29] this scripture. I needed this.
[1:25:30] Yeah. For he is kind unto the unthankful
[1:25:34] and to the evil.
[1:25:35] Amen.
[1:25:36] Isn't that something? This world is
[1:25:38] filled with unthankful people.
[1:25:40] The people that you do the most for are
[1:25:41] the most unthankful people. You can give
[1:25:43] to them. You can lend to them. You can
[1:25:45] help them. And they're the most
[1:25:46] unthankful people that you ever They
[1:25:48] don't even say thank you if you give
[1:25:49] them something. People have became very
[1:25:51] unthankful in this age.
[1:25:53] But Jesus says, "But he is kind to the
[1:25:56] unthankful
[1:25:57] and to the evil. They may not they may
[1:26:00] not receive you well. They may they may
[1:26:02] have evil in their heart. He said but he
[1:26:04] is kind unto them.
[1:26:06] What he's showing the nature of Jesus
[1:26:08] Christ. He said therefore be merciful as
[1:26:10] your father. Y this ain't going where
[1:26:11] y'all thought it was.
[1:26:13] Be merciful as your father also is
[1:26:16] merciful. Judge not that you be not
[1:26:18] judged. Condemn not and you shall not be
[1:26:20] condemned. Forgive and you shall be
[1:26:22] forgiven.
[1:26:23] See the God that heals is the God that
[1:26:25] forgives. David said, "He redeems my
[1:26:28] life from destruction. He crowns you
[1:26:29] with loving kindness and tender mercy.
[1:26:31] The God that satisfi satisfies thy mouth
[1:26:34] with good things. He renews your youth.
[1:26:36] He's the Lord that is merciful and
[1:26:37] gracious. He's slow to anger and he's
[1:26:39] plenteous in mercy. He will not always
[1:26:41] chide, neither will he keep his anger
[1:26:43] forever. And he has not dealt with us
[1:26:45] after our sins, nor has he rewarded us
[1:26:48] according to our iniquities." How many
[1:26:50] would say that God gave you what you
[1:26:51] deserved?
[1:26:52] Nobody would say that. God never has has
[1:26:55] dealt with us as we really deserve.
[1:26:57] He said he didn't reward us according to
[1:26:59] our iniquities. But as the heaven is
[1:27:02] high above the earth, so great is his
[1:27:04] mercy toward them that fear him. And as
[1:27:07] far as the east is from the west, that's
[1:27:09] how far he has removed your
[1:27:11] transgression from you.
[1:27:13] So if he's a god that can remove your
[1:27:15] transgression so far out of the mind of
[1:27:18] God, he said that's the nature that we
[1:27:20] ought to have to be able to forgive one
[1:27:22] another. Isaiah put it all in one place.
[1:27:24] He said, "But he was wounded for our
[1:27:26] transgression. He was bruised for our
[1:27:28] iniquity. The chastisement of our peace
[1:27:30] was upon him, and with his stripes we
[1:27:32] are healed. We are like sheep that have
[1:27:34] gone astray. We have turned everyone his
[1:27:36] own way. But the Lord hath laid upon
[1:27:39] him, Jesus Christ, the iniquity of us
[1:27:42] all."
[1:27:43] He forgives all of our iniquities.
[1:27:46] He heals all of our diseases. I know
[1:27:48] what it makes us think. I want to
[1:27:50] forgive, too. I'm that way. If somebody
[1:27:52] askked me for forgiveness, I'll be the
[1:27:53] first one to forgive. But you know, they
[1:27:55] never asked Jesus that when he was
[1:27:56] hanging on the cross of Calvary. He
[1:27:58] said, "Father, forgive them for they
[1:28:00] know not what they do."
[1:28:01] How many remembers the time whenever
[1:28:03] Steven was stoned and they drugg him
[1:28:05] down out of the city and they went out
[1:28:06] to stone him to death? I I thought here
[1:28:08] whenever they were they were dragging
[1:28:10] him out there in hatred and making fun
[1:28:12] and beating him on the on the side of
[1:28:14] the head for what he believed, but not
[1:28:15] one of them ever stopped and said,
[1:28:17] "Stephen, you know what? I'm so sorry.
[1:28:19] We shouldn't have done that. would you
[1:28:20] please forgive us? None of them asked
[1:28:22] for his forgiveness. But what was the
[1:28:23] last words that came out of his mouth?
[1:28:25] He said, "Father, they knocked this sin
[1:28:27] to their charge."
[1:28:29] It was because he had the nature of
[1:28:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:28:33] It wasn't the one that apologized. It
[1:28:35] wasn't because they that they were
[1:28:36] sorry. Has nothing to do with them being
[1:28:38] sorry for it. It has something with to
[1:28:40] do with you being able to forgive
[1:28:42] somebody. He said, "Lay not this charge
[1:28:44] to the earth, this sin to their charge."
[1:28:46] Don't you realize friends that the very
[1:28:48] life of Stephen was a catalyst for the
[1:28:50] gospel that we believe today?
[1:28:52] It was a catalyst for Apostle Paul.
[1:28:54] Matter of fact, it never it gave such
[1:28:56] conviction to Paul, it never left
[1:28:58] Apostle Paul. Many times he would talk
[1:29:00] about it. He said, "I persecuted the
[1:29:02] church even unto death." It was in
[1:29:03] Paul's spirit all the time because he
[1:29:05] was there whenever Steven was stoned.
[1:29:07] But the life of Stephen became a
[1:29:09] catalyst to Paul. It's why we It's the
[1:29:12] very reason we had this Bible. It was a
[1:29:14] life that a man gave that had the nature
[1:29:17] of Christ. You think about what that
[1:29:19] there was a reason why it never left
[1:29:21] Paul. There was a reason why that Paul
[1:29:23] was so convicted to the life of these
[1:29:26] believers and why Paul became such a
[1:29:28] such a Christian that he became because
[1:29:30] he got he saw the life of Christ in men.
[1:29:33] There was a reason why. It's because he
[1:29:35] seen that reflected in Stephen. You but
[1:29:38] said watch how Stephen done it. He said
[1:29:40] Stephen never performed a single
[1:29:42] miracle. Although he knowed that Christ
[1:29:44] was a miracle performer, he knowed all
[1:29:47] these powers and things. But what did he
[1:29:49] do? He just presented his life in such a
[1:29:52] way that they seemed that it was the
[1:29:54] power of Christ. He said, "And you may
[1:29:56] never see a vision. You may never put
[1:29:58] your hands on a sick person and feel the
[1:30:00] charge of Almighty God make a skeleton
[1:30:03] of a man turn back to life again. You
[1:30:05] may never see him standing in three or
[1:30:07] four rainbows. You may never see his
[1:30:09] image. I know. I'm just going to tell
[1:30:11] you the truth that everybody wants to be
[1:30:12] spiritual. They look for these signs and
[1:30:14] trying to be some supernatural person so
[1:30:17] they can feel like they have the life of
[1:30:18] Christ. He said, "But you may never see
[1:30:20] his image, you may never even hear his
[1:30:23] voice,
[1:30:24] but still you can be a sign board that
[1:30:26] will reflect Jesus Christ by a life
[1:30:29] that's been so pure and unadulterated
[1:30:31] from the world. not cluttered up with
[1:30:33] the dirty things around this life, but a
[1:30:35] pure thing that it'll cause the hungry
[1:30:38] heart to hunger and thirst and to be
[1:30:40] like you.
[1:30:41] Amen.
[1:30:41] That's the kind of Christian that
[1:30:43] Stephen was.
[1:30:44] Amen.
[1:30:44] He wasn't out performing miracles. Many
[1:30:46] of us could relate to Stephen. He wasn't
[1:30:48] out doing the supernatural. He didn't
[1:30:50] walk the streets. You know, I think
[1:30:52] about that people that every time they
[1:30:53] they become Christian, they want to they
[1:30:55] they try to go out and perform miracles
[1:30:57] or or copy somebody else's ministry. But
[1:30:59] that ain't what God calls us to do. You
[1:31:02] realize that Steven wasn't a miracle
[1:31:04] worker. Hello, somebody.
[1:31:05] Steven wasn't a miracle worker. Steven
[1:31:07] was a Christian.
[1:31:09] People have gotten a long way from being
[1:31:10] Christians.
[1:31:11] They want to be miracle workers. They
[1:31:13] want to be preachers. They want to be
[1:31:14] singers. They want to be deacons. They
[1:31:17] want to be musicians. They want to be a
[1:31:18] lot of things. But people have came a
[1:31:20] long way. I'm going to get fired after
[1:31:21] tonight. But people have came a long way
[1:31:23] from the desire that Stephen had and
[1:31:25] that was to be a Christian,
[1:31:28] a follower of Jesus Christ, to manifest
[1:31:31] the life of Jesus Christ. Too many want
[1:31:33] to be too many great things. But I think
[1:31:35] we need to get back to the reality of
[1:31:37] what it is to be a believer and to be a
[1:31:39] follower of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:42] Quit trying to be a somebody and just be
[1:31:44] a Christian like Stephen was.
[1:31:47] Said he was a Christian. That's what he
[1:31:49] was. But he had so much of the power.
[1:31:51] Think about it. He was a Christian. You
[1:31:53] say, "Well, Stephen was a powerless man
[1:31:55] then." No. He had so much of the power
[1:31:57] of God in his life
[1:32:00] that he could do the same thing that
[1:32:01] Jesus done sitting in that house.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:04] He had so much of the power of God in
[1:32:07] his life that when men were taking his
[1:32:09] life and they were throwing stones at
[1:32:12] him and they were they were trying to
[1:32:13] kill him that he could look right at
[1:32:15] those men and say, "Father, forgive
[1:32:18] them."
[1:32:18] Hallelujah. and don't lay this sin to
[1:32:20] their charge.
[1:32:22] I'm talking about a real power
[1:32:24] of God.
[1:32:25] You say, "Well, why would Stephen
[1:32:27] forgive men that were taking his life?"
[1:32:29] You know, I thought it like this. I
[1:32:31] thought, you know, Stephen must have
[1:32:33] been a man just like you and I.
[1:32:35] Maybe he looked at his own mistakes and
[1:32:37] his his failures and his own life just
[1:32:40] like every one of us do,
[1:32:42] you know, and maybe he looked at his own
[1:32:44] life and thought, you know what I need
[1:32:45] in my life? I need the forgiveness of
[1:32:48] God in my life. How many raise your hand
[1:32:50] to that?
[1:32:51] I need the forgiveness of God in my
[1:32:52] life. Maybe Stephen was that kind of a
[1:32:54] person like we are that says, I need the
[1:32:56] forgiveness of God. And maybe while he
[1:32:58] was standing there, Brother Mark, he
[1:33:00] remembered the words that Jesus spoke.
[1:33:03] That if you'll forgive men their
[1:33:05] trespasses,
[1:33:06] your heavenly father will forgive you.
[1:33:09] Maybe it wasn't about them at all,
[1:33:10] brother. Maybe it was about his own
[1:33:13] life. And Jesus said, "If you forgive
[1:33:15] not me and their trespasses, then
[1:33:18] neither will your father forgive you of
[1:33:20] your trespasses."
[1:33:21] And maybe in his dying words when he was
[1:33:24] losing his life, that the only thing on
[1:33:26] his mind was to be right with God.
[1:33:29] It wasn't about getting back at those
[1:33:30] that were persecuted, but it was to be
[1:33:33] right with God. I pray that those same
[1:33:35] words would ring in our ears tonight.
[1:33:37] That if we forgive our brothers, their
[1:33:39] trespasses, our heavenly father will
[1:33:41] forgive us of ours. I think that's what
[1:33:43] Stephen was going through. Oh God, you
[1:33:45] know my nature. You know my sins. You
[1:33:47] know the failures that are in my flesh
[1:33:49] and let me forgive those that would
[1:33:51] persecute me that Lord whenever I meet
[1:33:53] you that I'll be found forgiven in your
[1:33:55] sight.
[1:33:56] And the Bible said whenever they were
[1:33:58] stoning him and the life was leaving his
[1:34:00] body he looked up into the heaven. He
[1:34:02] said I see Jesus standing at the right
[1:34:05] hand of God. Brother Bam said and it
[1:34:07] wasn't long after that he was held in
[1:34:09] the arms of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:13] The very thing that he saw in vision, he
[1:34:16] was carried up there.
[1:34:17] So, see, if God forgives you when you
[1:34:19] forgive, think about what you're
[1:34:21] inviting into your life
[1:34:23] by forgiving somebody.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:26] He became a beneficiary
[1:34:28] of a supernatural power just by
[1:34:31] forgiving.
[1:34:32] Amen.
[1:34:33] Isn't that something that even in his
[1:34:34] dying breath that God wouldn't even let
[1:34:36] him hold a grudge?
[1:34:38] Hallelujah.
[1:34:38] The Bible said, "Let this mind be in
[1:34:40] you." that was in Christ Jesus.
[1:34:43] Can I just tell you what his mind was
[1:34:44] just before we close?
[1:34:46] Brother said, "There's many of the
[1:34:48] things I wish I could forget about." He
[1:34:50] said, "I don't know that that I've
[1:34:53] confessed them as wrong to him, but he
[1:34:55] put them in the sea of forgetfulness."
[1:34:56] How many can say that? There's many
[1:34:57] things that I've confessed to the Lord.
[1:34:59] I wish I could forget.
[1:35:00] How many say that?
[1:35:02] He said, "But he put them in the sea of
[1:35:03] forgetfulness, and he'll never remember
[1:35:05] them no more."
[1:35:07] Isn't that wonderful? He said, "Now,
[1:35:10] see, we're not made that way. We'll
[1:35:11] always remember. We can forgive one
[1:35:13] another, but we just can't forget about
[1:35:14] it because we're made different, but God
[1:35:17] can forgive it and forget it. He can
[1:35:19] just wipe it out as though it never was
[1:35:21] because he has access to that sea of
[1:35:23] forgetfulness that we don't have access
[1:35:25] to."
[1:35:26] So, just think of it that God can never
[1:35:28] even remember that you ever sinned.
[1:35:31] Think of that. He said, "Cho, young
[1:35:33] folks, what about that? God don't even
[1:35:36] remember when we ever sinned." See, he
[1:35:38] can forget the whole thing and it never
[1:35:40] will be brought into his memory anymore.
[1:35:43] Wouldn't that be something
[1:35:44] to have the mind of Christ?
[1:35:47] I'm talking about the presence of a
[1:35:49] supernatural power.
[1:35:51] Power to heal and power to forgive. And
[1:35:54] friends, I'm going to tell you this
[1:35:55] tonight that that same power is present
[1:35:58] among the church.
[1:36:00] That same power is present here tonight.
[1:36:02] I I challenge you to receive that. Would
[1:36:04] you would you be like the Pharisee that
[1:36:07] stood there or though or like those that
[1:36:10] that fought their way
[1:36:12] through the roof of a building
[1:36:15] to get into the presence
[1:36:16] of a supernatural power?
[1:36:19] Would you be like those at the Sanhedrin
[1:36:21] in the days of Stephen? Or would you be
[1:36:23] like Stephen whenever he turned to him
[1:36:24] and said, "You uncircumcised in heart
[1:36:26] and ears. Why would you resist the Holy
[1:36:28] Ghost like your fathers did?"
[1:36:30] Amen. I see the heavens open and I see
[1:36:33] Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
[1:36:36] Paul said without controversy, great is
[1:36:39] the mystery of godliness. For God was
[1:36:41] manifested in the flesh. He was seen of
[1:36:43] angels. Then he was received up into
[1:36:45] glory. But said he was God and he come
[1:36:48] to take the sinner's place. He said,
[1:36:50] "And when God raised him up on the third
[1:36:51] day, it was for our justification.
[1:36:53] Therefore, he exalted at the right hand
[1:36:55] of the majesty on high. He is an
[1:36:57] intercessor to make intercessions upon
[1:36:59] for our weaknesses as we confess it to
[1:37:01] him and we die out to oursel placing his
[1:37:04] word back in us. That is his promise.
[1:37:08] I want you to stand to your feet
[1:37:10] tonight. The very presence
[1:37:14] of a supernatural power. The Bible said
[1:37:17] that they gathered there the Pharisees,
[1:37:19] the Sadducees,
[1:37:21] the many great leaders, the doctors of
[1:37:23] law that were sitting by. They came out
[1:37:26] of every town together. But the power of
[1:37:28] the Lord was present to heal.
[1:37:30] I say it like this tonight that that
[1:37:32] same power that was present to heal is
[1:37:34] the same power that's present to
[1:37:36] forgive.
[1:37:37] Amen.
[1:37:38] And I believe that as body of believers
[1:37:39] that no, not only do we have the right
[1:37:43] to access that, but brother Brian, we
[1:37:45] have the right to give it.
[1:37:47] Do you believe that tonight?
[1:37:49] Hallelujah.
[1:37:49] That God has given that power to the
[1:37:52] church. Amen.
[1:37:53] You say, "Brother Matt, I want to be
[1:37:54] free tonight." Let me tell you, don't
[1:37:56] hold nothing in your spirit.
[1:37:58] Amen.
[1:37:58] Don't let nothing be held towards any
[1:38:01] man. I told you I wasn't going to be
[1:38:02] long tonight. Don't let Don't let
[1:38:05] grudges and things be built up to to
[1:38:07] where you can't even you can't even come
[1:38:10] to church and look at somebody in the
[1:38:12] eye. You can't even shake their hand no
[1:38:13] more. What a demonic spirit.
[1:38:16] Bring Tell you what it'll do. It'll
[1:38:18] bring sickness to your body.
[1:38:20] Bring illness. It'll call it'll cause
[1:38:23] problems in your life that may be there
[1:38:25] for years and years,
[1:38:29] but the Bible tells us a way to get rid
[1:38:31] of it
[1:38:33] if we can just find a place of
[1:38:34] forgiveness.
[1:38:37] This may not been for everybody.
[1:38:40] But I believe that tonight. I believe if
[1:38:42] you can find it in your heart, say, "You
[1:38:44] know what?
[1:38:46] Maybe I was the one that was wrong
[1:38:47] anyway.
[1:38:49] Maybe it wasn't them at all. Maybe it
[1:38:50] was me. Maybe maybe I looked at that
[1:38:53] wrong. Have you ever thought about that?
[1:38:55] Sometimes we look at every situation and
[1:38:58] we we've made ourselves so right in our
[1:39:00] own mind. That's what the Bible says.
[1:39:01] Every man's right.
[1:39:02] We made ourselves so right in our own
[1:39:04] mind that we can't even see somebody
[1:39:06] else's side of things. But maybe maybe I
[1:39:10] wasn't so right.
[1:39:11] But either way, let's not just try to
[1:39:13] figure out who's right, who's wrong.
[1:39:15] Let's just get right with God and
[1:39:17] forgive one another.
[1:39:18] Amen.
[1:39:19] And be right where it matters.
[1:39:20] Hallelujah.
[1:39:21] That's the reality.
[1:39:23] That's what Stephen did.
[1:39:26] Ain't nobody ever done nothing to us as
[1:39:27] bad as that.
[1:39:29] But he stood and he said, "Forgive
[1:39:31] them."
[1:39:33] I wonder how many if you'll bow your
[1:39:34] heads tonight. See, brother Matt, that's
[1:39:36] that's the spirit I want to have. God
[1:39:38] bless you, sis all over the building.
[1:39:39] God bless y'all. That's the spirit that
[1:39:41] I want to have.
[1:39:42] That I can't walk by somebody, one of my
[1:39:44] precious brothers or sisters and have
[1:39:47] something in my spirits toward them
[1:39:48] because because something has been there
[1:39:51] or something they done or said, but
[1:39:52] Lord, let me be free of that tonight.
[1:39:54] Let me find forgiveness in my heart. Let
[1:39:56] me put my arm around my brother and tell
[1:39:58] them I love them. Let me take this out
[1:40:01] of my life. Grant it, Lord. God, let
[1:40:04] them let us be free. Let's just pray
[1:40:06] together. Lord Jesus.
[1:40:08] Lord, you see our hands that are raised
[1:40:10] here tonight.
[1:40:12] Lord, I realize the power of God that is
[1:40:15] in this building. Lord, I recognize your
[1:40:18] spirit, Lord, that would come by, Lord,
[1:40:21] and begin to minister to our hearts in
[1:40:23] such a way, Lord, that only you can.
[1:40:26] Lord, you know what's been tormenting.
[1:40:28] And Lord, you know every spirit, Lord,
[1:40:30] that torments the sons and daughters of
[1:40:32] God. And Lord, the church tonight, Lord,
[1:40:35] that wants to be free. A people, Lord,
[1:40:37] that that want to have the joy of the
[1:40:39] Lord. And God, they want to be so freed
[1:40:41] in their spirit. But here, Satan would
[1:40:43] come to try to torment, Lord, and keep
[1:40:46] them down and keep the gift of God from
[1:40:48] operating in their life. But Lord, I
[1:40:51] just ask you tonight that you would set
[1:40:53] them free. Lord, I pray if there be
[1:40:55] something in our spirit here tonight,
[1:40:56] Lord, I pray that you would cleanse this
[1:40:58] church. Lord, I pray that you would take
[1:41:00] everything, Lord. Anything that we would
[1:41:01] have, Lord, I pray that you would cast
[1:41:03] it aside. Lord, I still believe that
[1:41:06] same power, Lord, that was in that house
[1:41:08] is the same power in this house tonight.
[1:41:10] And Lord, we just give you liberty to
[1:41:12] move among every person, Lord. Every
[1:41:14] hand that's raised, Lord, we just ask
[1:41:16] you that you would set us free, God. May
[1:41:19] there not be one thing. May we not
[1:41:21] harbor one spirit, God. Maybe we but may
[1:41:24] we be well tonight, Lord. May our
[1:41:26] health, Lord, may our bodies, the may
[1:41:29] our our life reflect the very nature of
[1:41:31] Jesus Christ. We thank you for it
[1:41:34] tonight, Lord, and we praise you in the
[1:41:36] name of Jesus Christ.
