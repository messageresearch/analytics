[39:07] to you um I want to look from Psalms
[39:12] 139 and I'd like to read verses 14 to
[39:15] verse
[39:17] 17 Psalms
[39:25] 139
[39:32] Psalms 139 verse1 14 to
[39:38] 17 can you give me a little more in my
[39:41] ear Psalms
[39:43] 139:14 and I will praise
[39:46] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[39:51] made marvelous are thy
[39:54] works that my soul knoweth right
[39:58] well for my substance was not hid from
[40:01] thee when I was made in secret and
[40:04] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[40:06] the earth that eyes did see my
[40:10] substance yet being
[40:13] unperfect and in thy book and all thy
[40:15] members were written which in
[40:18] countenance were fashioned when as yet
[40:20] there was none of
[40:22] them how precious also are thy thoughts
[40:26] unto me me oh God how great is the sum
[40:30] of
[40:31] them I want to read in Hosea chapter 6
[40:34] verse 1
[40:37] to3 Hosea
[40:39] 6
[40:47] 1:3 this would be a text from
[40:49] recognizing your day and this message
[40:52] this Hosea 6
[40:54] here come
[40:57] and let us return unto the
[40:59] Lord for he hath torn and he will heal
[41:02] us
[41:03] up he has smitten and he will bind us up
[41:08] and after two days he will revive us and
[41:13] in the third day he will raise us up and
[41:16] we shall live in his sight and brother
[41:18] Braham says we're well into that third
[41:20] day
[41:21] now being that Hosea would have spoke
[41:23] this about 2700 years ago
[41:27] then shall we know if we follow on to
[41:30] know the Lord he's going forth as
[41:33] prepared as the morning and he shall
[41:36] come to us as the
[41:38] rain as the latter and the former rain
[41:42] unto the Earth we ask the Lord to bless
[41:44] his words you could be seated
[41:46] tonight I want to speak to you here for
[41:49] a little while he has come unto us as
[41:54] the rain he has come unto us as the rain
[42:00] amen I uh I read something here out of
[42:04] how I can overcome I'd like to just
[42:06] share this with you now the prophet said
[42:09] I have chose this because I think it's a
[42:12] time that we should never let the spirit
[42:15] of Revival
[42:16] die we've got to keep in
[42:19] Revival constantly revived every day
[42:23] Paul said he had to Die daily that
[42:26] Christ could live and we must never let
[42:29] that Revival die within us amen if
[42:33] you're listening to how I can overcome
[42:35] brother Bram says don't be caught
[42:37] without life in you don't be caught
[42:39] without life in you in the Samar in the
[42:42] church age brother Bram will say excuse
[42:47] me he'll say this he said now here we're
[42:51] coming to
[42:53] a we're coming to a conclusion as the
[42:56] Eternal logos God was manifest in the
[43:00] Sun and in Jesus dwelled all the
[43:03] fullness of the godhead bodily and the
[43:06] Eternal one who was the father manifest
[43:09] In the Flesh and thereby gained the
[43:12] title of son even so we Eternal in his
[43:18] thoughts in our turn became the many
[43:22] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[43:25] the flesh
[43:27] and those Eternal
[43:29] thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are
[43:34] the sons of
[43:35] God even as we are so called we did not
[43:40] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[43:44] and therefore we were reborn for only
[43:48] the elect can be
[43:50] reborn because we were seed is the
[43:53] reason we could be quickened in the non
[43:56] seed there is nothing to
[43:59] Quicken Now isn't it amazing that a
[44:02] prophet was telling us that we have our
[44:05] turn we have our turn and I think
[44:07] tonight we've got to realize that it is
[44:11] our turn this is the time that God has
[44:14] chosen to place you into the Earth
[44:16] Eternal as a prophet would call it
[44:19] Eternal in the thoughts of God before
[44:21] the foundation of the world but he has
[44:24] chosen this time to place you into this
[44:27] Earth and this is your turn to manifest
[44:31] the the very thoughts of almighty God I
[44:35] know tonight we'd like to see God many
[44:37] people as brother brandham would say he
[44:39] said people would say we'd like to pray
[44:41] him down brother BR said it don't work
[44:42] like that he said God's in you he said
[44:45] so what you want to do is yield yourself
[44:48] and then let God display himself through
[44:50] you and you can see him and your
[44:52] neighbor can see him amen because God is
[44:55] through through his people revealing to
[44:57] his people Amen in this time that we're
[45:00] living in it is a Time amen that it is
[45:03] our turn now the prophet is suggesting
[45:07] that we are Eternal in the thought of
[45:09] God he uses the subject and one place he
[45:12] says the thoughts of God are real and
[45:14] they are Eternal that's pretty powerful
[45:17] the thought of God is real and the
[45:20] thought of God is eternal brother bam
[45:22] says in one place he says if you can see
[45:24] this you will see many things
[45:26] the thought of God is real and is
[45:29] eternal that's why David said my
[45:31] substance was not hid from thee even
[45:33] though I was made in secret curiously
[45:35] wrought in the low parts of the eye
[45:37] Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance
[45:39] yet being imperfect but all thy book all
[45:43] my members were written therein so David
[45:45] is saying the record of me was in the
[45:47] book and the thought of me was in his
[45:49] mind the evidence that we were there in
[45:51] the mind has been placed in the very
[45:54] Bible that you read in this book is
[45:56] placed your members in this place in
[45:59] this book is the record that God had you
[46:02] in his mind even before the world began
[46:05] as yet there was none of them how
[46:07] precious are thy thoughts of me when we
[46:10] think tonight of how that God thought of
[46:12] the church and how that we were a part
[46:14] of that Eternal you know when you when
[46:17] you think tonight and you say well
[46:19] brother Wayne then we're uh uh we're
[46:21] we're Eternal but you see we're not
[46:23] Eternal Sons uh we're not in Turtle
[46:26] sunship let's say it this way because
[46:29] you know the uh the Catholics came up
[46:31] with the idea that there were three gods
[46:33] and one of them was the son the Eternal
[46:36] son and brother bam comes along and he
[46:38] says well there's no such thing as
[46:40] Eternal sunship because sunship means
[46:43] that you had a beginning and you have an
[46:45] ending and he said but God had no
[46:47] beginning and had no ending but the body
[46:50] of Jesus Christ had a beginning and it
[46:52] had a time that was not on the earth so
[46:54] he's showing you amen that it was an
[46:57] eternal God living in his son and so
[47:01] therefore by the same token you and I
[47:04] became Eternal when God came into us it
[47:08] was that Eternal attribute of God so you
[47:10] can look at it tonight and I could look
[47:12] at you and maybe let's say uh how how
[47:14] old are you you're 22 and you've
[47:17] received the Holy Ghost so I could look
[47:18] at you and say you're 22 and eternal
[47:21] amen so there's two different time dates
[47:23] there's a time that you were birthed
[47:25] into the age
[47:26] and then there's a Time amen that was
[47:28] you was in the mind of God now eternity
[47:30] has come into time into this human body
[47:33] so you got two different ages on you if
[47:36] you look at it in uh you look at
[47:38] Michelangelo when he built the Statue of
[47:40] Moses Moses's statue buil out of granite
[47:43] you could look at it and somebody could
[47:44] say well it's 20 years old cuz Michael
[47:47] just built it but you could look at the
[47:48] granite and say it's millions of years
[47:50] old so it's according to what you were
[47:52] looking at were you looking at the
[47:53] granite or you looking at the image that
[47:55] was formed form Med out of amen that's a
[47:57] that's a whole lot to do with some of
[47:59] those Indian AR artifacts you know the
[48:01] rock is a million years old but somebody
[48:03] made it last week you know amen so it's
[48:05] got two different dates on it amen so
[48:08] what we find out then is that God Amen
[48:11] has done the same thing with you as a
[48:13] believer that you are the Eternal Son of
[48:16] God in a human body giving the Eternal
[48:19] God and attribute living in the Earth in
[48:22] our turn Amen in other words that we
[48:24] were made from eternity now just think
[48:27] amen that under these Seven Seals that
[48:30] there's going to come a revelation of
[48:32] what God thought of you from before the
[48:34] foundation of the world so the message
[48:37] of the hour is not just dealing with
[48:39] what we're dealing with today it's
[48:42] giving to you the understanding of God's
[48:45] thought about you from before the
[48:47] foundation of the earth and God sealed
[48:50] it in a book your members were sealed in
[48:53] a book so as Satan couldn't touch this
[48:56] church because it was out of the reach
[48:58] of Satan all the way to the end but see
[49:01] God rich in his Mercy knew that he would
[49:04] send Elijah in the last days to reveal
[49:06] this book back to the church and that we
[49:09] would be able to receive the Eternal
[49:11] thoughts of God that was not corrupted
[49:14] by some man-made tradition or idea see
[49:17] God knew that we were Sons to begin with
[49:20] therefore he sent the spirit of his son
[49:22] Upon Us in the spirit of adoption and is
[49:25] leading us back to the Eternal thought
[49:28] that God had of us from before the world
[49:30] began and listen you can never get there
[49:32] without a prophet of God because a
[49:35] prophet is God's source and channel to
[49:37] restore the church to the former glory
[49:39] she had before the foundation of the
[49:41] world people talk about power but you'll
[49:43] never have true power until you have a
[49:46] restoration of the word and a
[49:48] restoration of the word will bring a
[49:49] restoration of power because it is the
[49:51] Eternal God giving back to the church
[49:54] his some total of what he thought about
[49:56] you from the begin with I think tonight
[49:58] of how precious are thy thoughts of us
[50:00] oh God how precious is the sum of them
[50:03] amen and the message of the hour is
[50:05] bringing a perfect thought concerning
[50:07] your life now in Jeremiah chapter 29
[50:10] it's a beautiful scripture in the 11th
[50:12] verse for I know the thought that I
[50:14] thought towards you he said sayith the
[50:16] Lord their thoughts of peace and they're
[50:18] not of evil and it's to give you an
[50:22] expected
[50:23] end so you're not not going to surprise
[50:26] God this is an expected end now if
[50:29] you're looking in Jeremiah of course
[50:31] this is dealing with that God's thoughts
[50:33] are not evil but they're peace now the
[50:35] reason being what has happened here
[50:37] brother John is is that the Israel amen
[50:40] has got this beautiful Tabernacle and
[50:42] and they they're living under the laws
[50:44] of Moses and everything is wonderful but
[50:47] they have turned to idolatry and God is
[50:50] telling through Jeremiah that
[50:52] Nebuchadnezzar is going to come and
[50:53] destroy this Temple that is so wonderful
[50:56] and he's going to carry the people all
[50:58] the way back into Babylon and they're
[51:00] going to re remain there for 70 years
[51:03] that's why long they're going to be
[51:05] there and all of them must have thought
[51:07] amen they had all kinds of thoughts
[51:08] about what God was thinking but Jeremiah
[51:12] having the true intent of God is saying
[51:15] that it's not an evil thought of you
[51:17] amen that this is a thought of peace and
[51:20] it is not a thought of evil amen so what
[51:23] we find out is is that God had already
[51:25] planned a restoration before amen they
[51:28] ever even left he's already planning
[51:30] their return and God is going to lead
[51:33] them back under under zerubabel right
[51:35] and zerubabel is going to return and
[51:38] build them again 70 years later it's
[51:40] going to restore the temple and the
[51:42] Bible says and when he begins to do it
[51:44] they look upon it and and brother Matt
[51:46] they said amen the Bible even talks
[51:48] about him weeping and saying that this
[51:51] Temple is not as pretty as the one that
[51:53] was before but the Bible proph
[51:55] prophesies he said for the glory of this
[51:57] latter house is going to even be greater
[52:00] than the glory of this former house amen
[52:02] for the place will I give peace amen
[52:05] saith the Lord isn't it amazing because
[52:08] that former Temple amen and it was a
[52:10] beautiful Temple was built under Solomon
[52:12] and it was the place where the glory of
[52:14] the Lord came in when they sent the word
[52:17] into the Tabernacle the glory of the
[52:18] Lord came in and it was s there oh what
[52:21] a beautiful thing amen what a glory they
[52:23] had and how big it was and beautiful it
[52:26] was but it wasn't to compare with the
[52:28] glory of what the latter Temple was
[52:30] going to receive because what it was
[52:33] going to happen is the glory that had
[52:35] came into Solomon's Temple that was
[52:38] hiding behind the pillar of fire that
[52:40] Majesty that it came was going to return
[52:43] again but it wasn't going to be just the
[52:46] Majesty hiding behind the pillar of fire
[52:49] but that Majesty would return in a human
[52:52] being who would be the Messiah who would
[52:54] be the kinsman redeemer who would be the
[52:57] Lord Of Glory in John the first chapter
[52:59] the Bible says whenever Jesus came to
[53:02] the Earth it says oh my that the word
[53:04] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[53:07] beheld his glory as the only begotten
[53:12] amen as the only begotten of the father
[53:13] full of grace and of Truth we beheld
[53:15] Glory like we had never seen glory and
[53:18] that Glory was what entered the temple
[53:21] amen that was restored it wasn't as
[53:23] pretty as the first one but the glory of
[53:25] it was greater than the one that was
[53:27] before amen it was a powerful thing that
[53:30] Christ the son of God was what came into
[53:32] there I I think of the beauty of this
[53:34] amen that God veiled himself in the man
[53:37] and walked in what a glory amen in
[53:39] Jesus's own words he said when you have
[53:42] seen me you have seen the father I think
[53:45] it's beautiful in Malachi when he said
[53:47] the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly
[53:50] come into this Temple amen the Lord you
[53:53] seek shall come into this Temple oh you
[53:55] talk about a glory it was a greater
[53:57] glory than the glory that they had in
[53:59] Solomon it was the glory of God himself
[54:02] coming down into the temple I think
[54:05] today amen of the grace of God that the
[54:08] word became flesh now before it's a word
[54:10] it's a
[54:11] thought so in the beginning was the
[54:14] creation of God in the beginning was the
[54:16] word and the word before it was a word
[54:19] what was it then in the beginning was
[54:20] the word before the beginning now that's
[54:23] a that's that's pretty heavy isn't it
[54:25] but brother random asked the question
[54:26] what was before the beginning before the
[54:29] beginning there was the thought there
[54:31] was the attribute but then when thoughts
[54:34] become expressed then they become words
[54:36] and then words become flesh so it's
[54:39] amazing when you start looking at your
[54:42] thought compared to God's thought in
[54:44] Isaiah chapter 55 the 7th verse the
[54:47] Bible said let the wicked forsake his
[54:49] way and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[54:52] and let him return unto the Lord and he
[54:55] will have mercy upon him and to our God
[54:58] for he will abundantly pardon for my
[55:02] thoughts they are not your thoughts
[55:04] neither are your ways my ways sayith the
[55:09] Lord for his Heavens are higher than the
[55:11] earth that's right so are my ways higher
[55:14] and so my thoughts than your
[55:18] thoughts now God is telling us then that
[55:22] your thought and his thought is two
[55:24] different things
[55:25] but his thought is higher concerning you
[55:28] than your thought is concerning you my
[55:30] ways and my thoughts now brother Ram in
[55:33] the word became flesh in India he does
[55:36] us a beautiful favor talking about this
[55:38] Bible and he said every word in that
[55:40] Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed
[55:44] form and if it's received into the human
[55:47] being and spoke by the same thought that
[55:49] materializes the Bible it will bring the
[55:52] thing to pass what I mean and how
[55:54] powerful ful could this church be the
[55:56] Bible said let this mind that was in
[55:58] Christ be in you as a man thinketh in
[56:01] his heart so is he now your thoughts if
[56:04] they become expression your thoughts
[56:07] become expression Waters of Separation
[56:09] brother B says you've got to die to
[56:11] every thought of this flesh so that you
[56:13] can receive the mind of Christ amen amen
[56:17] and walk not of your own but of his mind
[56:21] the mind of Christ in you that's the
[56:23] only way you can stay
[56:27] alive okay we began by saying we must
[56:31] keep Revival sir we must keep life in us
[56:35] and the prophet is saying the only way I
[56:37] can stay alive is to die from my
[56:40] thoughts and receive the thoughts of God
[56:43] the only way for me to exist in this
[56:45] evil age amen that's flooded with the
[56:48] thoughts of enemy it's flooded with the
[56:50] mind of Satan but if I want to stay
[56:52] alive if I want to survive if if I want
[56:55] to keep my head above the waters I've
[56:57] got to let the mind that was in Christ
[56:59] come into me this Bible says in
[57:02] Thessalonians they which are alive and
[57:04] remain un the coming of the Lord shall
[57:07] not hinder they which are asleep so
[57:08] there's somebody's going to be living so
[57:11] somebody's going to be forsaken their
[57:12] way somebody's going to forsake their
[57:15] mind somebody's going to let it go
[57:17] because that's the only way to stay
[57:19] alive is that you all I live by is the
[57:22] holy spirit see God Leeds on his own
[57:25] word man shall not live somebody say
[57:29] live man shall not live by bread alone

[57:59] thoughts of God to come into the church

[58:35] word of God now in IND the trip brother
[58:39] BR says it like this if your heart and
[58:41] your mind is so and filled with God's
[58:44] spirit until your thought becomes his
[58:46] thoughts when your mind and you're
[58:49] leading and you're guiding becomes a
[58:51] direct place or a direct inspiration of
[58:54] the Holy Spirit that's moving in Mortal
[58:57] beings what kind of people should we be
[59:01] amen it's the very Holy Spirit has so
[59:04] embodied or empowered that you don't
[59:05] have your own
[59:08] thoughts you don't use your own mind now
[59:12] there's it's different you know that
[59:14] your thought the Bible says it you have
[59:16] thoughts God has thoughts brother brand
[59:19] is saying if you can get to the place
[59:21] where you don't use your own thoughts
[59:24] anymore
[59:26] brother way see I have this thought
[59:27] about don't use it I think this about it
[59:30] don't use it if you want to live don't
[59:33] use it amen look what he's saying what
[59:36] kind of people could we be this morning
[59:38] if the brandom Tabernacle let's say
[59:40] grace Tabernacle was so filled with the
[59:42] presence of God that we didn't use our
[59:45] own mind we didn't even use our own
[59:49] thoughts didn't even have an
[59:53] alternative oh Hallelujah church can you
[59:57] imagine what kind of people we'll be
[59:59] when we don't have an alternative to the
[1:00:01] message when we don't have a a second
[1:00:04] preacher or a third preacher or another
[1:00:07] another another Authority amen when it's
[1:00:10] just the word and the word of God Alone
[1:00:13] we don't have another alternative we
[1:00:15] don't have another opinion church I know
[1:00:18] it comes but we don't use
[1:00:21] it we don't use it and you say preacher
[1:00:25] how do I keep from using it I love it
[1:00:26] water of separations you've got to die
[1:00:29] to every thought of the
[1:00:31] flesh amen you got to die you got to
[1:00:34] crucify that thing isn't it something
[1:00:37] amen self crucifixion is the hardest
[1:00:39] right you can't follow Christ till you
[1:00:41] deny yourself you got to deny yourself
[1:00:44] you got to deny your own thoughts that's
[1:00:46] the hardest one the opinion is the
[1:00:49] hardest death there is is when you lose
[1:00:51] your own opinion you lose your own ideas
[1:00:53] listen it's the same same walk for every
[1:00:55] person it's the same distance for every
[1:00:58] person it's death to self look what he
[1:01:02] says you can receive the mind of Christ
[1:01:04] and walk henceforth not of your own but
[1:01:06] of his mind the mind of Christ in you
[1:01:09] that's the only way you can stay alive
[1:01:13] now look at this you ain't got no think
[1:01:15] coming that brother R was getting pretty
[1:01:17] you're getting pretty heavy here wasn't
[1:01:19] he but he was in Jeffersonville I guess
[1:01:21] he felt Liberty and he said listen you
[1:01:24] think think question
[1:01:25] mark you ain't got no think
[1:01:29] coming he had already quit PR pastoring
[1:01:31] by now I think brother M he was on the
[1:01:33] field and he was coming and going he
[1:01:35] didn't have to deal with this next week
[1:01:37] you know he said you don't have any
[1:01:40] think coming can can you imagine this
[1:01:42] you walk up to your pastor and say well
[1:01:43] I think we ought to do the and he said
[1:01:45] you ain't got no think
[1:01:48] coming well well brother Matt you know
[1:01:51] you read that scripture the other day
[1:01:52] and I think
[1:01:57] you see uh brother brother random I I
[1:01:59] know you said that about that but I
[1:02:03] think you see when you when you don't
[1:02:06] have a think
[1:02:07] coming when you don't have an
[1:02:09] alternative to it amen when what the
[1:02:12] prophet said is what you believe and
[1:02:16] what he said is exactly right then you
[1:02:19] have life because it's not your life
[1:02:22] you're living it's the Eternal thought
[1:02:25] of God coming into the church see you
[1:02:28] ain't got no think coming I'm not making
[1:02:29] this up he really says this he says you
[1:02:32] he's the one that does your thinking let
[1:02:35] the mind let you just think the same
[1:02:38] thing and that's his word now going
[1:02:41] beyond the camp that's a good one ain't
[1:02:43] it go beyond the camp so you can get a
[1:02:45] you can get a group of guys and they all
[1:02:47] start agreeing to certain things a
[1:02:48] certain way you ever notice that you you
[1:02:50] know you you can get a certain set of
[1:02:52] guys or a certain affiliation the
[1:02:54] Brotherhood and things and they'll get
[1:02:56] to feel in a certain way about things or
[1:02:58] they'll get to think in a certain
[1:02:59] direction on things and you can't hardly
[1:03:01] even read a quote that the prophet said
[1:03:03] that's contrary because it seems so
[1:03:06] argumentative but but but watch brother
[1:03:08] random he said but we got to get beyond
[1:03:09] the camp we get got to get beyond the
[1:03:13] circles we got to get beyond the
[1:03:15] Traditions come on and your family may
[1:03:17] have believed in a certain way or your
[1:03:18] church might have believed it a certain
[1:03:20] way that's not we're talking about we're
[1:03:22] talking about keeping life amen if we're
[1:03:24] going to keep life we got to get beyond
[1:03:26] the camp of our reason beyond the camp
[1:03:29] of our ideas we got to get beyond the
[1:03:32] camp of these things amen let us go
[1:03:34] beyond our own thinking amen let us get
[1:03:37] by listen if I'm not going to use my own
[1:03:40] opinion I promise I'm not going to use
[1:03:42] yours if I'm not going to use my own
[1:03:45] opinion I'm not going to use somebody
[1:03:46] else's amen I'll just be honest with you
[1:03:49] if we're going to have an opinion I'll
[1:03:51] take brother brandom's amen at least he
[1:03:53] was fellowshipping with an angel on a
[1:03:55] daily basis I bet his opinions were
[1:03:57] honed a little bit tighter than uran I
[1:04:01] was amen we ought to go beyond it amen
[1:04:04] the Bible said this let the mind that
[1:04:05] was in Christ be in you so let us think
[1:04:08] his thoughts not our own thinking
[1:04:10] because the most of the time we're wrong
[1:04:13] amen amen so let his mind rest in us and
[1:04:17] his mind was to do the father's will the
[1:04:20] father's will is his promised word
[1:04:25] look at the beauty of this the father's
[1:04:27] will is this promised word 1 Corinthians
[1:04:29] 13:10 beautiful scripture when that
[1:04:32] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:04:35] is in part shall be done away isn't that
[1:04:38] beautiful amen some people would use
[1:04:40] that and say well you know uh uh uh the
[1:04:42] Bible says that you prophesy in part and
[1:04:45] you dream in part and you have all these
[1:04:47] things in part but when the perfect
[1:04:48] comes apart is done away with now they
[1:04:50] think well then the gifts are just done
[1:04:52] away with when the per perfect comes now
[1:04:54] we know it's talking about the perfect
[1:04:56] word we know it's talking about the
[1:04:58] Revelation coming to the age but listen
[1:05:00] it's not just a ceasing of the gifts God
[1:05:02] sent a whole age restoring gifts but
[1:05:06] what's going to happen is there's going
[1:05:07] to come a word into this age and that
[1:05:10] word will set the thing so in order that
[1:05:13] it will remove the failure of the
[1:05:16] prophecies and the dreams and it will
[1:05:18] restore the Perfection of the word upon
[1:05:21] every life come on Church amen y'all
[1:05:24] know what they did in Pentecost some of
[1:05:26] these Elders were in Pentecost amen and
[1:05:29] the funniest one I ever heard they said
[1:05:31] it happened down here at pal Hatton you
[1:05:32] know where there was a a woman wanted to
[1:05:35] marry the preacher you know I think he'd
[1:05:36] already been married a couple times and
[1:05:38] somebody got this prophesy and somebody
[1:05:40] spoke in tongue somebody jumped up and
[1:05:41] said yay sayith the Lord You're to marry
[1:05:43] me and we're to go to Mexico and do such
[1:05:45] certain thing and that old boy he didn't
[1:05:47] like that prophecy so he just said let's
[1:05:49] have another saying from the
[1:05:51] Lord you know because there was no order
[1:05:54] to it there was nothing to judge that
[1:05:56] there was nothing to set it in a place
[1:05:58] so it brought confusion it brought false
[1:06:01] identifications it brought a place where
[1:06:03] the devil could do whatever he wanted
[1:06:05] but when a prophet of God came into this
[1:06:07] age he set the thing in an order and he
[1:06:11] did it to bring life to the church he
[1:06:13] never did it to take out the Holy Ghost
[1:06:16] he did it to filter out the falsehood
[1:06:19] and the confusion and he took the devil
[1:06:21] away the Bible said give no place to the
[1:06:24] devil come on church amen we're not a
[1:06:27] bunch of twoy olds with toys and the
[1:06:30] we've got a perfect word we've got a
[1:06:32] word that's been restored in the age
[1:06:35] that we're living in the power of God is
[1:06:37] returned to this age we're under a
[1:06:39] prophetic message we're not a bunch of
[1:06:41] children brother B said it when I was a
[1:06:43] child I spake as a child brother B said
[1:06:45] we now have the perfect word he said we
[1:06:47] don't have to be out in the floor like a
[1:06:49] bunch of kids trying to speak in tongues
[1:06:51] come on church that's not where we are
[1:06:54] we are a Church of the Living God that
[1:06:57] if the gifts of God want to come they
[1:06:58] can come I say God let them come but let
[1:07:02] the spirit of God operate him and not my
[1:07:04] will and not your will and not your
[1:07:06] opinion but let God operate the
[1:07:10] word come on church amen it's going to
[1:07:13] bring life when I was a child I spake
[1:07:16] like a child I understood as a child I
[1:07:19] thought as a child but when I become a
[1:07:21] man I put away childish things and the
[1:07:25] politics and the building up and the
[1:07:26] ideas of man come on but now we see
[1:07:30] through a glass
[1:07:32] Darkly now Paul says this and I know in
[1:07:35] part but then shall I know even as I
[1:07:39] also am known isn't that beautiful oh
[1:07:43] you know you know in part Paul said it
[1:07:46] he said but there's coming a day you're
[1:07:47] going to know like God knows
[1:07:51] you you're going to know as you're known
[1:07:54] that's right amen you're going to know
[1:07:56] as you're known amen I I I I don't know
[1:07:58] some time ago I was studying through
[1:08:00] this and I thought it was so powerful
[1:08:02] because I got to look at this and I
[1:08:04] thought isn't it amazing that brother
[1:08:06] randam says we were that you were a part
[1:08:08] of God God rich in Mercy it's it's a
[1:08:10] powerful tape if you never heard it
[1:08:12] brother B said you were a part of God
[1:08:13] from before the world began he said the
[1:08:15] thing is you just don't remember it he
[1:08:18] said you were there but you just don't
[1:08:20] remember it right but David said my
[1:08:24] substance was recorded amen even if I
[1:08:27] don't remember it it don't mean I wasn't
[1:08:29] there right just cuz I don't remember it
[1:08:32] don't mean it didn't happen as a lot of
[1:08:34] you forgot a lot of things and you were
[1:08:36] there and it happened and it was real
[1:08:38] amen but you forgot about it but
[1:08:40] somebody's got a tape somebody's got a
[1:08:42] video somebody's got a recording amen
[1:08:45] and it gives us record and evidence of
[1:08:47] what was going on during that time
[1:08:49] greatest greatest thing I've ever seen
[1:08:51] is my own birth amen when I was born I'm
[1:08:53] here I know I was born but I don't
[1:08:55] remember a thing about it but my mom is
[1:08:57] sitting right back there can tell you
[1:08:59] the day the hour the time my dad was in
[1:09:01] the waiting room waiting back in those
[1:09:03] days men had to wait you know amen they
[1:09:05] were back there that's been a few days
[1:09:07] ago amen and and they had to wait and
[1:09:09] all that but I can tell you I was born
[1:09:10] on the April 4th I can tell you I was
[1:09:12] born in pconus Arkansas I can tell you I
[1:09:14] was born to Joy and Randall Lawson I can
[1:09:17] tell you all those things but I don't
[1:09:18] remember one of them but her memory of
[1:09:22] me has become my memory
[1:09:24] and now I teach it like it's me because
[1:09:27] I trust her thoughts I trust her memory
[1:09:31] come on church this word is God's memory
[1:09:35] of you and when you get ready to trade
[1:09:37] your memory and your thoughts you can
[1:09:40] receive God's thoughts but you can't
[1:09:42] take one thought here and one thought
[1:09:44] there either it's all God or it ain't
[1:09:48] God hallelujah I think God has sent a
[1:09:52] perfect word God has sent a perfect
[1:09:54] message in the age I'm living in and yes
[1:09:57] it is an absolute Authority D Wayne
[1:09:59] Lawson
[1:10:00] absolutely it says that I shall be know
[1:10:03] I shall know as I'm known then the word
[1:10:07] has become my
[1:10:09] memory then what I'm looking at is
[1:10:11] trading a finite mind for an infinite
[1:10:14] mind I am trading a mind that is limited
[1:10:17] that is forgetful that is negative I am
[1:10:20] trading that mind for a mind that thinks
[1:10:24] peace and it thinks Grace and it thinks
[1:10:26] power it's an eternal mind it's an
[1:10:28] infinite mind you said brother Wayne how
[1:10:30] do you do the swapping it's called the
[1:10:32] spirit of
[1:10:33] revelation God has revealed unto us his
[1:10:38] word when that Revelation begins to come
[1:10:41] it begins to transform us therefore the
[1:10:44] Bible said don't let you be conformed as
[1:10:46] the world but be you transformed by the
[1:10:48] renewing of your mind come on you could
[1:10:51] just say well brother Wayne what mind
[1:10:52] are we talking about Paul PA picked one
[1:10:54] mind of the entire Bible and said let
[1:10:57] this mind be in you that was in Christ
[1:10:59] he never said the one that was in Moses
[1:11:01] he never said the one that was in David
[1:11:02] he said the mind that was in Christ
[1:11:04] could come into the church don't you see
[1:11:07] the Promise behind that don't you see
[1:11:09] that if if if the Bible is commanding
[1:11:12] you to let this happen it's possible to
[1:11:15] happen it's not just something amen God
[1:11:18] is telling you let this happen so it's
[1:11:21] possible to happen it's possible to
[1:11:24] forget who you are it's possible Amen to
[1:11:27] forget to get amnesia about this natural
[1:11:29] life amen and get cured of your Amnesia
[1:11:33] of your spiritual life Hallelujah I
[1:11:36] thank God there's a cure there's a cure
[1:11:39] that we can remember what we ought to
[1:11:40] remember we can forget what we should
[1:11:42] forget God who remembers everything also
[1:11:46] has the ability to forget everything and
[1:11:48] I want to forget what he forgot and I
[1:11:50] want to remember what he remembers and
[1:11:52] he forgot that I was ever assembled and
[1:11:54] he forgot that I ever had struggles and
[1:11:56] he forgot the life that I used to live
[1:11:59] but God remembers the promises that he
[1:12:01] made to me and the grace that he gave to
[1:12:04] my life I'm talking about living a life
[1:12:07] of Eternity on the earth because of the
[1:12:11] word of God this word is not a byproduct
[1:12:14] this word is not a second opinion this
[1:12:16] word means more than life to
[1:12:19] you
[1:12:22] Hallelujah amen Paul said we see through
[1:12:25] a glass Darkly so in in Paul's age it
[1:12:29] wasn't clear
[1:12:31] yet now church amen that's that's the
[1:12:35] Bible right Paul taught it but not with
[1:12:40] clarity now I'll say very clearly that
[1:12:43] brother brandom's gospel and Paul's
[1:12:45] gospel were the same gospel there's not
[1:12:47] two
[1:12:49] gospels right he said well we'll get
[1:12:52] them to Christ and then we'll get them
[1:12:53] to the message that is a
[1:12:55] fallacy that is one of the greatest
[1:12:57] insults to the message of the hour I've
[1:12:59] ever heard are you telling me you really
[1:13:02] believe that William brandom's message
[1:13:03] is separate from the Gospel of Jesus
[1:13:06] Christ think about that a minute we'll
[1:13:10] get them to Christ then we'll get them
[1:13:11] to the
[1:13:12] message you're suggesting brother bradam
[1:13:14] has taught something besides what the
[1:13:17] Bible has taught us amen but really
[1:13:20] William bram's Ministry has returned us
[1:13:23] to to the original pattern of the word
[1:13:25] of God what Paul wrote in a glass Darkly
[1:13:29] has now become the light of the new day
[1:13:32] son for the for the Bible tells us that
[1:13:34] the day star has arisen in our heart and
[1:13:37] we have seen not just a prophecy we have
[1:13:40] seen the Fulfillment of Prophecy we've
[1:13:42] seen the perfect manifestation of the
[1:13:45] realities of God come on
[1:13:48] Church well it's not a guess I'm telling
[1:13:51] you it's not that's right
[1:13:53] come on this this ain't a guess this
[1:13:55] ain't brother B guessing around and
[1:13:57] getting
[1:13:58] something it was a perfect manifestation
[1:14:00] of the
[1:14:02] word now now if you if you notice this
[1:14:05] it was in a glass Darkly but then it
[1:14:07] would come he says it again over in 1
[1:14:10] Corinthians or 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[1:14:12] and then it breaks out in the last verse
[1:14:14] there and he said We Shall Behold Him
[1:14:17] and we shall see him and as we look into
[1:14:20] him we'll be changed amen
[1:14:23] when you start looking into the into the
[1:14:26] UN into the unobscured word it'll change
[1:14:31] you so so David see the seed was laid
[1:14:34] right it's always amazed me God tells
[1:14:37] Moses go down and deliver my children
[1:14:39] I'll be with you go down and deliver
[1:14:41] them with a mighty hand I'll send Aaron
[1:14:42] you take this rod and go down and
[1:14:43] deliver them he didn't tell him nothing
[1:14:46] about janers and jambers he didn't tell
[1:14:48] him nothing about the impersonations he
[1:14:50] didn't tell him about the resistance he
[1:14:51] would have he didn't tell him about day
[1:14:52] and
[1:14:54] Kora but every bit of that was in the
[1:14:57] original
[1:14:59] commission and when Paul preached it
[1:15:02] everything brother randam is teaching
[1:15:03] down here was in The Original Scriptures
[1:15:07] it was there that's the basis of it but
[1:15:10] the thing has come into fruti in the
[1:15:12] last day and it's Paul's gospel
[1:15:14] explained by power and manifestation
[1:15:18] which the Bible said it was the way that
[1:15:19] God would bring his gospel not by word
[1:15:22] only but through Power and manifestation
[1:15:25] if you're a Bible student second
[1:15:26] Corinthians chapter 4 begins with saying
[1:15:28] because we have this ministry God has
[1:15:32] manifestly declared unto
[1:15:35] you it's powerful and then he begins the
[1:15:37] next verse and said if our gospel be hid
[1:15:40] who's our then who's our amen Our Gospel
[1:15:43] I wonder is that brother randam and Paul
[1:15:46] if our gospel it's not just we're not
[1:15:48] just talking about a man who's got idea
[1:15:51] now y'all help me preach here cu this
[1:15:53] ain't just a man come up with some ideas
[1:15:55] folks this is the original thought of
[1:15:59] almighty God which is your identity as a
[1:16:03] Believer and without that message you
[1:16:05] have no identity you have no father you
[1:16:08] have no mother you're an orphan lost in
[1:16:10] the world but when God rich in Mercy
[1:16:13] sent the message of the hour we heard
[1:16:15] the scream of the eagle and we said Mama
[1:16:18] that's you and by her we identified
[1:16:21] ourselves and this message is our
[1:16:25] identification therefore because you
[1:16:27] know who it is you're not using your own
[1:16:30] thoughts you're using his thoughts let
[1:16:32] the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:16:37] you amen think his way of thinking he
[1:16:42] says
[1:16:43] confession amen means to say the same
[1:16:46] thing as if you think the same you'll
[1:16:47] say the
[1:16:49] same now you got to watch how you dwell
[1:16:51] on because it comes your words y'all
[1:16:53] know that's the truth you you
[1:16:56] ever I'm I'm G preach to the upper room
[1:16:59] here if you
[1:17:01] ever have you ever sat down and thought
[1:17:03] about how you goingon to tell somebody
[1:17:05] off now I knowbody in here ever done
[1:17:09] that but you think about all them little
[1:17:11] things you're troubled by and
[1:17:14] that you dwell on that a while just keep
[1:17:17] just keep dwelling there just stay there
[1:17:18] a while and you know what's going to
[1:17:20] happen you can hold that for a while but
[1:17:23] you're going to be in a certain
[1:17:24] situation you ain't going to have enough
[1:17:26] sleep you're going to have some pressure
[1:17:27] on you somebody's going to slam a
[1:17:29] cabinet door on your hand and that
[1:17:31] person's going to walk by you and you're
[1:17:33] G to say everything you've been
[1:17:35] thinking because you lost the filter to
[1:17:38] say it so what you do is don't dwell on
[1:17:41] thoughts that you don't want to
[1:17:44] speak don't dwell there come into the
[1:17:48] word of God and when you're dwelling on
[1:17:50] the word you'll say what you're thinking
[1:17:52] about amen the Bible said out of the
[1:17:55] abundance of the heart the mouth will
[1:17:57] speak what your heart is set on is what
[1:18:00] your words will come and we cannot alter
[1:18:02] God's words we have to alter our
[1:18:04] thinking if we can't change the word
[1:18:07] we've got to change our thinking come on
[1:18:09] friends when something's out of the word
[1:18:12] you don't change the word you change the
[1:18:14] way you think about it you don't say
[1:18:17] well I don't know if brother BR meant
[1:18:19] that or I don't meant if no no no no you
[1:18:22] don't all Al the word you alter yourself
[1:18:25] you say Lord let me change my mind about
[1:18:28] the way I view this about the way I
[1:18:30] think about this because we want to
[1:18:32] think like he thinks we want to talk
[1:18:34] like he talks we want to act like he
[1:18:37] acts we want the life to be in us let
[1:18:39] this mind that was in Christ be in you
[1:18:42] in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16
[1:18:44] Paul said for who hath known the mind of
[1:18:47] the Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:18:50] have the mind of Christ
[1:18:53] well I tell you what that shout material
[1:18:55] there ever was amen we have the mind of
[1:18:59] Christ do you know what God gave you
[1:19:00] when he gave you this message he gave
[1:19:02] you his
[1:19:04] mind that's what he gave you you know
[1:19:07] you take a take a honeymoon and young
[1:19:10] couple ver get married and oh boy he you
[1:19:12] know everything's just wonderful until
[1:19:15] he decides he wants things different and
[1:19:17] then he starts revealing his mind and he
[1:19:21] says well I'd like it to be like this
[1:19:22] and I'd like it to be like this now the
[1:19:24] wife has a chance right then to
[1:19:28] completely submit to thought or she can
[1:19:30] say well I don't think that's a good way
[1:19:32] to do it and then the war's
[1:19:34] on and what the war is is for
[1:19:37] headship the headship that's the real
[1:19:40] war is who is going to do the thinking
[1:19:42] for this home come on church I'm not
[1:19:45] talking about your homes I'm talking
[1:19:46] about church I'm talking about when the
[1:19:49] Pentecostal world Amen had their mind
[1:19:51] and they were doing good and and here
[1:19:53] come the anointed word and when the
[1:19:55] prophet begin to reveal what God thought
[1:19:57] about it amen right there was either you
[1:20:00] submit to the will of God or you fight
[1:20:03] with the word of God Amen and I don't
[1:20:05] know about y'all but I said Lord I
[1:20:07] submit I submit my will I submit my life
[1:20:11] I submit my Ministry I submit everything
[1:20:14] to the will of God and only you can do
[1:20:17] that God won't Force you God won't make
[1:20:19] you do it that way God won't make you
[1:20:21] say it that way he'll let you do
[1:20:23] whatever you want to amen but I say oh
[1:20:26] God I want to be submissive in my life
[1:20:29] upon your word that's what I want to do
[1:20:32] amen I'll tell you this amen it it is
[1:20:34] something when God begins to show you
[1:20:37] that this this mystery came to us in
[1:20:39] this age and as Moses gave the word in
[1:20:43] his day so has God now the pillar fire
[1:20:46] appeared to Moses right and he writes
[1:20:48] the Old
[1:20:49] Testament the pillar of fire appears to
[1:20:52] Paul and he writes the New Testament but
[1:20:55] the same Heavenly messenger that wrote
[1:20:58] the Bible is here bringing the
[1:21:00] revelation of the Bible so the only way
[1:21:03] you have the perfect thought on the
[1:21:05] scripture is the one that wrote it tells
[1:21:09] you now to me friends that's the highest
[1:21:13] order of preaching is when it's the
[1:21:16] perfect thought of God in Isaiah 55
[1:21:19] watch the 10th verse for as the rain
[1:21:21] cometh down and the snow from the heaven
[1:21:24] returneth not tther but WTH the Earth
[1:21:27] and make it bring forth and Bud that it
[1:21:29] may give seed to the so and bread to the
[1:21:33] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[1:21:37] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:21:40] return unto me void but it shall
[1:21:43] accomplish that what I please and it
[1:21:45] shall prosper the thing where unto I
[1:21:48] sent it as the rain comes down amen so
[1:21:52] is my word came down and it will not
[1:21:55] return void but it will accomplish what
[1:21:58] it has been set out to do listen the
[1:22:00] word that has been spoken cannot return
[1:22:02] to God without making manifest what it's
[1:22:05] been promised to do amen let me just say
[1:22:07] it this way this Bible was spoken but
[1:22:09] this Bible ain't going back to
[1:22:11] heaven the the the word the book is the
[1:22:14] word of God but God's not returning this
[1:22:17] book to Heaven it's not till this book
[1:22:20] is fulfilled in the church and takes the
[1:22:23] Fulfillment of this book to Heaven God
[1:22:25] ain't coming after a book he's coming
[1:22:27] after a bride he ain't coming after a
[1:22:30] book he's coming after the Flesh of the
[1:22:32] word when the word is made flesh then
[1:22:35] the bride will return back into the
[1:22:37] glory listen let me say let me say with
[1:22:39] all my heart I I don't know a better way
[1:22:41] to say it but from the book of Genesis
[1:22:44] when God said amen that that would bring
[1:22:46] forth a seed a woman's seed should bring
[1:22:47] forth amen do you know that was that was
[1:22:50] hundreds of years amen even even until
[1:22:53] Isaiah picks it up in Isaiah 7 and said
[1:22:56] a virgin shall conceive that word of the
[1:22:59] Book of Genesis was added to the
[1:23:01] Isaiah's prophecies and those the spirit
[1:23:04] of God was literally circling the earth
[1:23:07] looking for a
[1:23:09] virgin but it didn't stop circling in 10
[1:23:12] years it didn't fall to the ground in 50
[1:23:15] years it didn't fall to the ground in a
[1:23:17] hundred years but the prophet said 712
[1:23:20] years later it came to a little woman
[1:23:22] out a well and an Heavenly messenger an
[1:23:26] angel looked at the woman and said thou
[1:23:28] had found favor with God and thou shall
[1:23:30] have a son and call his name Jesus and
[1:23:33] she and she questioned the
[1:23:35] message she said how can it be me not
[1:23:38] knowing a man so some questions are good
[1:23:41] and some questions are bad that was a
[1:23:43] good question she believed the word she
[1:23:45] just wanted to know how can I do it and
[1:23:47] the god of Heaven told her amen thou
[1:23:50] shallal be overshadowed by the Holy
[1:23:52] Ghost amen amen thou shall be
[1:23:54] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and and
[1:23:56] what she done was
[1:23:58] conceived of the Holy Ghost the word of
[1:24:01] Isaiah was in
[1:24:04] her Hallelujah the word had hung in her
[1:24:08] flesh but it wasn't finished right she
[1:24:11] had to birth that word and as the word
[1:24:14] become mature Jesus standing there one
[1:24:16] day looked at them and said I come from
[1:24:19] God there it was Isaiah said
[1:24:23] Genesis 3 there it was Isaiah 9 and6 I
[1:24:27] come from God but Isaiah 9:6 wasn't
[1:24:29] going back and Malachi wasn't going back
[1:24:32] and Genesis wasn't going back Jesus was
[1:24:35] returning to God the word fulfilled was
[1:24:38] returning to God oh come on church amen
[1:24:41] this bride is looking for a Rapture just

[1:24:46] Rapture is not just cuz you're good
[1:24:48] people or you got good personalities
[1:24:50] it's because the word of the age has
[1:24:53] Anchored In the Womb of your spirit and
[1:24:55] it's manifesting his flesh upon this
[1:24:57] Earth and we come from God we come from

[1:31:03] thinking well maybe we'll just get
[1:31:05] through that's
[1:31:10] nonsense the Book of James be patient
[1:31:13] therefore Brethren under the coming of
[1:31:16] the Lord behold the husband man waiteth
[1:31:17] with precious fruit for have long
[1:31:20] patience until he receiveth the early
[1:31:22] and the light of rain you can you can
[1:31:24] look that word up husband it's the judge
[1:31:28] he waiteth the judge he waiteth until
[1:31:30] the judge comes to the door it it that's
[1:31:33] a that's a direct from Book of
[1:31:34] Revelations the third chapter right
[1:31:35] behold I stand the door every other
[1:31:38] Church age I come quickly I come quickly
[1:31:40] I come quickly seventh age I stand at
[1:31:42] the door and knock I come to bring both
[1:31:46] early and latter rain be patient
[1:31:50] therefore establish yourself the coming
[1:31:52] of the Lord draweth nigh in Amos the nth
[1:31:55] chapter 11th verse and the day will I
[1:31:56] raise up the Tabernacle of David that is
[1:31:59] Fallen I'll close the breaches and I
[1:32:00] will raise up ruins and I will build it
[1:32:03] as in the days of old and they possess
[1:32:04] the remen of EV and the Heathen which
[1:32:06] are called by name sayith the Lord
[1:32:08] behold the days are coming sayith the
[1:32:10] Lord that the plowman should overtake
[1:32:13] the Reaper and The Treader of GRA him
[1:32:16] that ha sold seed and the mountain shall
[1:32:18] drop sweet wine and the hills they him
[1:32:22] out I'll build again the Tabernacle of
[1:32:24] David y'all know he's talking about the
[1:32:25] Gentiles right David David went and
[1:32:29] build a tent over in the city of David
[1:32:31] and They Carried the word now that first
[1:32:34] carrying of the word of course killed a
[1:32:35] man they put it in the threshing floor
[1:32:37] and then God said to David one day he
[1:32:38] said go go go heal the breach now go go
[1:32:42] go preach the breach and bring the word
[1:32:43] into the tent and then they went and got
[1:32:45] the word and they brought it down to the
[1:32:47] tent then that most of your Psalms is
[1:32:48] written with the word in that tent the
[1:32:52] Tabernacle of Moses was still set up
[1:32:54] down there but here the word was in a
[1:32:57] tabernacle of tents you got the
[1:32:59] organization and you have tents at the
[1:33:02] same time now look look what we see when
[1:33:06] the word is there in those tents in that
[1:33:09] season he says that the plowman shall
[1:33:12] overtake the reaper what's that mean
[1:33:14] that means you got a Reaper and a Ser in
[1:33:17] the same
[1:33:19] Fields it's a season of both latter and
[1:33:22] former rain it's when the both rain see
[1:33:24] former rain is a planting rain and
[1:33:27] harvest rain is a harvesting rain and
[1:33:29] they're prophesying a season under the
[1:33:31] Tabernacles of David when the season
[1:33:33] will be so
[1:33:35] powerful that the planning and the
[1:33:37] harvesting will happen at the same
[1:33:39] season can you imagine God working so
[1:33:42] quick think about this that a prophet
[1:33:45] could say let there be a squirrel and
[1:33:48] the planter and the reaper were in the
[1:33:51] same field
[1:33:53] Isaiah said it a virgin shall conceive
[1:33:56] and it was 712 years before the former
[1:33:58] the lighter rain struck the former rain
[1:34:01] but in the season of the days of the
[1:34:03] Tabernacle of David when the t is set up
[1:34:05] among the Bride come on Church it'll be
[1:34:08] a season the former latter of rain come
[1:34:10] together it'll be when a prophet says
[1:34:12] there'll be a bride and it won't be
[1:34:15] another season but in our turn to
[1:34:18] express the Eternal qualities of God
[1:34:22] yes it'll be in a season it'll be in a
[1:34:26] season like this when a woman sitting
[1:34:28] there saying Amen to the word of God
[1:34:30] will get her children given to her by
[1:34:32] the angel of the Lord how do you can
[1:34:35] have them amen and what did we see we've
[1:34:37] seen a former rain and we've seen a
[1:34:39] harvest rain in the same season in the
[1:34:42] same house listen some of you have come
[1:34:45] to church and you know you come in sick
[1:34:47] and while the preacher was
[1:34:49] preaching while the preacher was
[1:34:50] preaching he said something and it
[1:34:52] struck your soul and there was a seed
[1:34:55] song and there was a seed harvested in
[1:34:58] the same season listen church we are
[1:35:01] living in the greatest season that has
[1:35:03] ever been given to

[1:35:11] stars and and it was amazing because
[1:35:13] brother bam brother bam was talking
[1:35:15] about the Seven stars of The Book of
[1:35:16] Revelation he said there's the seven
[1:35:18] angels seven churches but when the
[1:35:20] Thunders come we remove the symbol of
[1:35:22] the Book of Revelations and then we'll
[1:35:24] be able to see it for what it is and I
[1:35:26] said that first star was Paul but that
[1:35:29] seventh star was a man named William
[1:35:31] brandom it was a woman sitting there in
[1:35:33] that meeting that had leukemia for a

[1:35:48] man William brandom she said there was
[1:35:49] an anointing that struck my body she
[1:35:52] said I felt a heat from the top of my
[1:35:54] head to the bottom of my feet and God
[1:35:56] instantly healed me of that leukemia

[1:46:11] age amen you love the Lord amen I just
[1:46:14] think that was powerful my brother Wayne
[1:46:16] got to talk about that Amnesia and just
[1:46:19] a a few days ago me and me and Sarah we
[1:46:21] were cleaning out the old shop and you
[1:46:23] know how you get them old boxes and
[1:46:25] stuff that you stored up that that you
[1:46:27] should have threw away years ago think
[1:46:28] if you if you hadn't looked at it in 10
[1:46:30] years it's not you don't really need it
[1:46:32] and but we were going through that stuff
[1:46:33] and trying to clean it out and we found
[1:46:35] some old videotapes so we went in the
[1:46:37] house and started playing some of them
[1:46:39] videos and would you believe there on
[1:46:41] this video there there's this young man
[1:46:44] on there and and his hair is all messed
[1:46:46] up goofy looking guy and big ears and my
[1:46:50] and and acting I mean just a goofball
[1:46:53] you know and we're watching that and I
[1:46:55] said what in the world is who is this
[1:46:57] guy and she that is you I mean that that
[1:47:00] that is you and you it was such a we
[1:47:03] were sitting there talking about that
[1:47:04] the other day isn't it weird that you
[1:47:05] can watch a video of yourself and don't
[1:47:08] even remember doing it I don't remember
[1:47:10] the room we were in I don't remember the
[1:47:12] the the the place we were wherever we
[1:47:14] were staying I don't have a single
[1:47:16] memory of it and I watch a video and
[1:47:19] trying to convince myself watching a
[1:47:20] video of me that it was even really me
[1:47:24] and I thought my if that's that way just
[1:47:25] in a few years isn't it something that
[1:47:28] God would if that if that can happen to
[1:47:30] your human mind in a few years don't you
[1:47:32] see how that it could happen that you
[1:47:34] were that you were somebody else and you
[1:47:36] didn't even know who you were but
[1:47:38] brother Cody that God would come in this
[1:47:39] age and he'd say you was a Son of God
[1:47:41] before the foundation of the world you
[1:47:44] in the very Mind Of God you don't you
[1:47:46] didn't even know who you were when you
[1:47:47] was born in this life you was RA you
[1:47:49] went through many years years of your
[1:47:50] life and all a sudden you heard these
[1:47:52] words you were a daughter of God you
[1:47:54] were with me whenever before I ever
[1:47:56] formed you I thought of you I knew I
[1:47:58] knew how you would be when you was even
[1:47:59] in your mother's womb that's how we were
[1:48:01] with God and that God would come and

[1:48:10] know my life I know what I've been
[1:48:11] through and I know who I was but he said
[1:48:13] no but you were with me I just think
[1:48:16] it's wonderful tonight that God could
[1:48:18] come and remind us in the very life of
[1:48:20] Christ can live on the inside of a human
[1:48:22] being and you can you can manifest a
