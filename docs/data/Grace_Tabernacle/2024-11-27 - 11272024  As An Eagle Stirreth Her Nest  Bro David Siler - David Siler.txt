says where two or three are gathered together in my name there shall I be in the midst of them and so we got a few out tonight that just want to come and allow the Lord to be able to speak to our hearts and Brother David has something on his heart so I believe that God is going to come and speak to us and I believe if we come in expectation we're going to receive something amen now you can go to the wrong place and have an expectation not get nothing out of it but when you come to the house of God and you have a man of God that's gifted of God and you take a people that'll come expecting and pulling from the gift of God it's a recipe to receive something from the Lord amen I believe that's scriptural and how many come to receive something from God Amen we didn't just come here out of a Duty or an obligation but we all came tonight wanting to have communion with the Lord and and just to be able to hear the Lord be able to speak to our hearts and so we just want to give Brother David plenty of time we didn't have any prayer requests but can we sing this uh song Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow and we're going to invite Brother David to come and speak to us tonight and because he lives [Music] I Can Face Tomorrow yes because he [Music] lives all my fear is gone and because I [Music] know he holds my f [Music] future and life is worth the Living Just Because He Lives will God sing his son and they called him Jesus and he came to love and to heal and [Music] forgive then he bled and died just to by my part and I know there's an empty grave that is there to prove my savior Liv and Because He [Music] Lives I Can Face Tomorrow yes because he lives how many can raise your hand tonight and say that's my testimony Lord without you I couldn't make it through another day but I I can rely on him tonight to be able to carry me through oh Lord because I know you're the one that holds my future and my life is worth the living just because he is can I talk about our promise as we invite Brother David in one day listen at it now we're going to cross that River and last's FAL all this Final War it will raise Glory but then this place thank you Lord it's going to give way to Victory and I See the Light Of Glory and I know my savior live and because he Liv I tomorrow yes because he Liv [Music] Lord praise the Lord let's just by our hearts this evening as we just approach him in a word of prayer and ask him just to come and speak to us tonight by his word Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be able to be gathered together in your house Lord there's no better place than be able to come and Lord into a refuge or a shelter Lord that you can come and speak to us Lord just any way that you would desire Lord if you want to encourage us we want to be encouraged tonight Lord if you want to uplift us no doubt there's people in this place tonight they need to be uplifted Lord if you want to correct me I want to be corrected however you want to speak to us tonight we come into your house Lord and we come believe beling Lord that the carcass of the word will be here and if the carcass here the Eagles will be here so we pray Lord that you'd help us as we look into your word tonight that you would be mindful of each one that has come and Lord that you would just say something from your word and Lord you know every need that's represented in this place tonight so we bring all of our needs all of our petitions before you and Lord we just want to approach your throne tonight and ask Lord be mindful of us I pray may you come Among Us Lord help me as a man Lord you see our insufficiencies Lord our human weaknesses and frailties Lord no doubt we have them and we have many of them but tonight we pray may you take us beyond that may we be gathered together as Paul called it in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus come I pray tonight Lord speak to us by Your Word move in this place touch every life Lord that when we leave here we can say surely has been good to be in the house of God grant it we pray tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and everybody said amen amen God bless you tonight such a great honor to be here with you while you're standing with us if you'd be so kind to turn with us to the book of Deuter chapter 32 Deuteronomy chapter 32 we want to say what an honor it is to be here to speak to you tonight uh just trust that the Lord will use us to be able to say something everybody say praise the Lord the Lord amen everybody glad to be here somebody got turkey on their mind or or Thanksgiving maybe banana pudding or or some type of pie but I want to come to feed on the word tonight amen just for a few minutes thank you sis I need that that's my cheat sheet Deuteronomy chapter 32 we want to look at verse 7 I want to read down just a few verses of scripture we'll be taking our subject out of verse 11 listen as as Moses is dealing here and he said remember the days of old consider the years of many Generations ask thy father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee when the most high divided to the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel for the Lord's portion I like this the Lord's portion is his people and Jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him aren't you glad God can find you he found him in a desert land he found him in a desert land now watch he's using Jacob by typ from Prince and that he moves into his name and he says he found him in a desert land speaking concerning his people he found him in a desert land and in the waist of the Hing Wilderness he led him about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye as the eagle sareth up her nest look at this he's talking about Israel but then he says as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluth over her young spread abroad her wings taketh them and beareth them on her wings look at verse 11 again as an eagle stirreth up look at this word stirreth it means to stir up to cause to move to Rouse awake to awaken to Insight movement so what he wants to do with Israel is he wants to something to cause them and come among them as the eagle comes upon the nest he wants to awaken them or in exite them to movement so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him once God converts Jacob and Jacob truly actually comes into an experience with God you never find another time in the scripture does he go out and begin to worship idols or pull in all the nations no sir there was no strange god with him and he made him to ride look at your Bible on the high plac look at verse 13 he made him ride on the high places of the earth why not the Low Places because he Likens him to the eagle he made him to ride upon the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the Rock and oil out of the flinty rock Matthew 2428 is that not working up there Matthew 24:28 that's all right we'll preach with that wherefore wheresoever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together may the Lord add His blessings to the word you can be seated tonight I was actually studying this subject that I'm going to preach on tonight whenever brother Matt had called me and after he had called me I had you on my heart and I thought that the Lord would if he ever give me an opportunity to preach to you again just as a local local body that I would take this subject so that's the reason why this is on my heart and I believe that God knows every person that's going to be here and every person that's not going to be here and I know that God is mindful to say something if it's just the one person I found out years ago I don't need to preach a sermon that's going to affect everybody in the church because I know that it's probably not going to I'm not that kind of a Preacher but if God can deal with one heart or one person I've drove 12 hours and 15 hours to preach to one person I felt like in that building but I'll tell you this I felt like that was worth my time because God concerned about everybody amen I want to speak to you tonight on as the eagle steareth up her nest and I want to take this as a type tonight and I want to actually look at the first place that the prophet started dealing with this whenever he was going to start preaching upon this these these Eagles and he'd been looking the Eagles and in that first message that he actually deals with the stories of the eagle he actually uses this as as as a principle for where he's going and he's going to pick it up from the scripture that we've read tonight and he said so the prophet here speaking about Deuteronomy 32 he said the prophet here is speaking he was talking of course principally he was speaking about Jacob how that there was no other God before him so he's talking talking about Jacob and how that Jacob become solded out to God and when he did there was no idolatry or no other God before him and he said see he knew no other God but as he said the eagle stirreth up her nest it is a time now listen to what this means on the eagle steering up its nest it's a time that when the eagle thinks that her little ones has matured enough and she's got to stir up the nest it's a time whenever the mother Eagle thinks that her little ones has matured enough that she's got to stir up the nest he said when we've got all settled down on something he said like it is what's God do he stirs up the nest again when we get settled down God stirs up the nest again he brought Martin Luther from Catholicism because they got so starchy that he had to stir up the nest and when he stirred up the nest he sent Wesley in and then Wesley got starchy and he stirred the nest and he sent Pentecost in and let me say this tonight it's Nest stirring time again because we get settled down now here is Moses in the scripture in the book of Deuteronomy and Moses is actually coming to the end of his ministry watch The Parallel tonight Moses coming to the end of his ministry and Moses mooses has been looking at Israel he's been noticing this and he's actually going to give this to them to warn them well now does Moses take and he's going to speak this to Israel is Israel going to give heed to the warning they are not are they going to take as it was in The Book of Daniel different places going to Babylon they are they're going to look at other Islands but notice the warning that God is going to give to them before they ever get there that God is going to use Moses and he's going to take the parallel of Jacob and he's going to use Jacob now remember that Jacob was the one who was actually taken going about his own way he wasn't concerned about God wasn't concerned about the things of God but then what's God takes and begins to lead Jacob that God's got to bring Jacob to the place that God can meet Jacob face to face and we know that whenever he crossed that Brook that night and once he comes across there and he leaves his family and his servants on the other side of the brook it was on that side of the brook that God began to move upon Jacob and then he tells Jacob you'll no longer be called Jacob but you're going to be called Prince now whenever Jacob gets to this he's going to call him Israel because that was going to be the name that God was going to use to be able to call his people by name he was going to call them Israel so when you read the Bible you'll find in one place talking about Jacob sometimes he calls him Jacob sometimes he calls him Prince some times he calls him Israel Israel eyes begin to DM as he was getting old and God's going to take that type of Jacob and then from Jacob the Patriarchs is going to come and then from there will be a people of God that he would call Israel now because Jacob was God's chosen vessel that God had actually allotted an inheritance to Jacob that Jacob was going to receive something from God and by top he's going to use Israel that Israel was going to come into Canaan they was going to have allotment or inheritance once they come into the land so they as we would say would be called of God they are chosen of God these are a people who has been LED they have been called out they have been separated from all kinds of things not just Egypt but remember even in the middle of the journey God had to constantly separate them from the many of the Nations that they found along the way so God has been with them God has been leading them but God wants to bring them to a place where he can give them their full inheritance to be able to divide the land one to another and because they are coming to that place that Moses picks it up and he says as it was you can remember as it was in the days of old you can remember how that God had been with them and that God had led them and then he brings it down to this place speaking about speaking about Jacob and he's going to take the top as an eagle stirreth up up his nest now God never wants his people to get to a place of complacency in their walk with God he never wants his people to get to a place where they get so settled down they're satisfied with what God has done they're satisfied with how God has moved they're satisfied I've repented I've I've been baptized I've done those things according to the word of God I have fulfilled that in the word and if we're not careful because that we have done those ordinances in the word remember there are certain ordinances that God puts in the word one of them is water baptism another one's paying their ties another one going to church another one foot washing communion those are things that God has required from us but if we're not careful whenever we look at the basic things that we do in Christianity and we think well I've repented I've been baptized I go to church I don't really do anything wrong listen we become so settled in the experience of what God has already done and when we get comfortable we stop reaching out when we get comfortable we stop reaching for more of God we stop reaching for more revelation we stop reaching for a deeper experience with God because we become complacent with what God has already done in our lives so what's God going to do when he finds us getting a little bit soft getting a little bit spiritually lazy a little bit complacent with what he's done I'll tell you what he does he stirs The Nest again he stirs The Nest again it is such a difficult day for us to be living it to think of what God has done for us in the book of the word think about what God has done for us that we realize that the book that I read from tonight that the majority of this book that I read from do you realize this book is not a mysterious book to us there's Millions across the world that it is a mysterious book but it's not a mysterious book to you even when it comes to the Book of Revelation do you realize that the majority of the Book of Revelation has already been fulfilled you got people all M waiting on this to happen the majority of the Book of Revelation has already come to pass it's already been fulfilled it's already finished and many don't even realize that it has but for you to whom the mystery has been made known to you your eyes has come open you understand what the first chapter represents the Sevenfold percentage of his deity you know chapter 2 chapter three represents the letters that whenever John would take and send them down to the churches which are in Asia which would be a spiritual type of the ages that's going to come and how that the condition on that church would be the condition upon the people and until you come all the way down to the L Odyssey and church age and then you leave there and go to Revelation chapter 4 and you find the throne room and one set upon the throne then you go to Revelation chapter 5 and you find a book in the right hand of him that set up on the throne and there was no man that was found worthy until one from the very Throne of God the heart of God Jesus Christ is the heart of God came forth to take the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne then you go to Revelation chapter 6 you got the seals Revelation chapter 7 there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour then you go all the way down Revelation 10 Revelation 11 the two witnesses Revelation CH 12 Revelation chapter 13 which represents the Beast that comes forth out of the water which represents remember it came forth there was one that came out of the water another one came out of the land the one that came up out of the land was like a land which is the United States but I'll remind you it didn't remain a lamb it didn't remain a lamb it transformed itself from the lamb because that's what America has done those are not things that we're wondering about God's already revealed those things to us and it's already taking place right among us tonight and the church said amen but with all of that Revelation knowing who the man of sin is knowing what the future holds for the bride what God's called us to be if we're not careful we get so comfortable in teaching we've heard it we've heard it again the preacher comes out takes a text from the Bible and you think I've heard this I've heard this read before I've heard this preached on before I've heard these quotes I've heard it y but God knows there's times that we need to hear it again and what happens is we become so settled down until we put our fire our campfire down we put our Lantern up we got our tent set up and we become so setted in what God has done for us that we stop reaching higher to receive more of God I just preached to myself for the last 5 minutes we re High we we we realize that we are so complacent that we stop praying like we need to we stop reading our Bible like we need to we stop going to church like we need come on somebody preach with me dud what's God got to do force me to move I said there's times as a preacher that God has to force me to move he's got to force the issue in my life just like he does in your life and whenever he forces the issue you know what God does he allows me to get desperate sometimes he allows me to get to the place where I got to cry out and I get on my knees and there's times that I pray and my words feel like they leave my mouth and they fall right down on the ground what's it make me want to do cry out that much more it makes me want to cry out just that much why I want God to hear me it's not that God didn't hear it ain't a problem with God it's a problem with me I said it's a problem with me and God gets us to the place remember the prophet tells us that desperation caused for a subject because the Reason God does that is God never wants your walk to remain stagnant he never wants me to get to the place where my walk becomes stagnant because if it gets stagnant wiggle tails get in it and that's what happens to in experience so God does not allow you to get to the place as a Believer where your relationship is stagnant and I go to church and I go home and I go to work and I do this what is that that's just a cycle of life that's a cycle but I want to tell you you are not in the normal cycle like everybody else because when you come to church you're not coming to sit on a Pew you're not just coming to hear a man preach you're coming to leave this building you're coming to be caught up in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're coming as Eagles to gather around the word of God and to start feeding upon it and it does something on the inside of you and something your heart wants to say Amen to it and glory to God praise the Lord what is it God stirs The Nest so when God stirs The Nest he wants to move the people from one thing to another he wants to move us as we would say from one step to another so we constantly are growing we're constantly maturing we're constantly getting closer to God he wants to move us think about it from one Glory as Paul called it he wants to move us from Glory unto Glory he wants to move us from one Plateau to a higher plateau and then to a higher Plateau why because he don't ever want you to feel like you arrived he don't want you to feel like well I arrived and I got all the Revelation I don't hear I don't really need that's that Spirit around the message today we don't need preachers no more all I need to do is sit around oh no you don't you need more the word right now than what you ever have been listen friends the closer we get to the coming of the lord we need to for the issue to be forced more now than what it ever has been before to make sure we are diligent about the things of God to make sure we're taking responsibility and do our part as a children of God Amen so God moves us from one thing to another why is it he never wants you to be considered Earthbound people Eagles are called to fly I said Eagles are called to fly God never tops you as earthy let's just be honest most of us got plenty of earthy yes sir my problem ain't the Earthly part my problem is I don't fly high enough the way I need to so what's God do God intervenes because he wants me to keep flying higher and higher and higher so what's God do he Likens us unto Eagles he will liken your life to any in Eagles absolutely incredible isin it amazing when you're going down the road and somebody says oh my goodness there's an eagle over there that everybody in the car everybody slows down and everybody's looking out the windows you know why they want to see that eagle why don't they do that with a buzzard why don't they do that with Crow why don't they do that with another bird I'll tell you why it's because e real eagles are rare I said real genuine Eagles is a rare thing and whenever you see one everybody wants to look at it because it's genuine and it's rare so God Likens his people to the Rarity of an eagle notice that job said it like this and job 39:27 do the eag mount up at thy command and make her nest on high the word there Mount up means does not the eagle Ascend up yeah or fly up I like this one to be lifted up it literally means do the eagle soar at his commands Amen on now think about that does an eagle soar at his command does the eagle Ascend up or does the eagle become lifted up by his command or I'll say it tonight does it not fly by his word in other words when we hear his word does not the eagle Ascend up why is it is because the eagle has been given this god-given ability that the eagle does not have to go somewhere to try to find its ability to fly remember it already has wing it already possesses every attribute that it needs to be able to fly the only thing it needs to do is is put its wings into action and that's where the church gets to if we become so Slumber and somber about the things of God remember God ain't trying to take you somewhere give you something external out here and there oh no what you got need of is already in you matter of fact I hear the prophet tell us he said everything that you need even for the Rapture is in you already everything that you need so God's not trying to give us something external everything we need is already in us what's it got to do put the wings into action notice Solomon said we should fly away as an eagle look at this Proverbs 30:19 the way of an eagle is in the air so you can identify the eagle notice how he identified him not by the ground he identif iing by the air in other words the manner the characteristics the attribute of an eagle is that he Soares upon the wind so he's carried up by the wind he sets his wings upon the wind oh my you realize that whenever an eagle takes do you realize that he only uses a very little percentage of flopping his wings about 90% of an eagle fly it's not him working or trying to achieve something are trying to Merit something but 90% of it is Grace he just knows how to set his wings upon the wind and the wind carries him higher and higher and higher amen do you realize that's the same thing with a Believer what's going to carries to the other side the grace of God to learn how to set our wings upon the word of God to allow it to be able to lift us up and to rise above to set us so high that it can carries above everything else Solomon said the way of an eagle is in the air not upon the ground not on not Earthly but in the air is the way of an eagle so when it comes to God's people he Likens them to Eagles notice that Moses is going to use this type that Moses is the first one to take this parallel and bring it together and he said you've seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bear you I bear you I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you into myself which tells me this if God bore me if he bore me that means Papa eagle or Mama Eagle took me on his wings and I couldn't get out of Egypt by myself I couldn't get out of sin by myself I couldn't get out of bondage by myself so what God did is God came down into our bondage watch the typ that Moses is showing what Christ is going to do I came down right among you you couldn't get out of it by yourself you couldn't get out of Egypt by yourself you've been there over 400 years and you become complacent and you become settled down and you got used to being there so what did Mama Eagle do Mama come right down among them and he said I've been watching you I've been right there with you and how I bore you in the wings of eagles God Likens his church to Eagles amen but I want to tell you this you do not have the ability to soar alone I said it takes the wind underneath you to give you the ability to soar amen now notice he's telling them if you will notice I was with you I you seen what I did you notice I was with you I protected you I kept you they wanted to destroy you they wanted to work you to death but I bore you on the wings of an eagle here's your favorite scripture but they that wait upon the Lord he shall renew their strength they shall Ascend up be lifted up to soar to soar above to soar over or as we say overcome so you shall Mount up with wings how as Eagles so God Likens you to an eagle you cannot listen God's the one that compels you there ain't man that called you to be an eagle a man didn't have that kind of Revelation but God says if you'll wait upon me if a man will just simply wait upon the Lord I'll give him the strength to fly I'll give him the strength to overcome amen if you lose your joy somewhere I'll help you get your joy back if you lose your Victory somewhere I'll help you get your Victory back if you'll just wait upon me don't get too nervous don't get too upset don't get too wound up just wait upon the Lord and He Shall renew thy strength what a promise that if I get weak in the journey he'll renew it you know what the word renew comes from restore so in somewhere in the middle of the journey if you feel like you fail somewhere God has restoration power he can restore you back from what you fell from and over and over again tonight I could go through so many different places where the scripture teaches us that God Likens himself to Eagles and he Likens his people unto Eagles because there's something oh in there though in there's something about watching an eagle soar that moves us you ever been anywhere seeing Eagle take off oh my it moves us it pulls us it motivates us there's something about a soar and Eagle that speaks to something on the inside of us when you look at it on a calendar or a picture somewhere and that eagle is soaring and there's mountains Underneath Him and the clouds are Underneath Him the something about the eagle that moves us nobody nobody wants to be lacking into a chicken that don't even make me feel good nobody wants to scratch around amen upon the ground nobody wants to Peck around the ground come on but I remind you a chicken's a bird too well ain't I preaching this in the right Church a chicken's a bird too he's got Wings he's got a beak come on he's got something he can walk on but let me tell you about a chicken he's not designed with the attributes to SAR a chicken Oh Glory a chicken's allotment or inheritance is not in Heavenly places amen a chicken is not called to fly into the heavens that is not his allotment in life that is not his inheritance God did not liken Israel unto a chicken oh no he Likens them unto an eagle remember a chicken is a bird but he's a bird that is limited he is a bird that is he cannot fly very long he cannot stay over here my he cannot stay lifted very long he's up one day and down the next up one day and down the next that's what a all but not an eagle an eagle has amen has the ability to soar upon the heavens no true believer wants to be a limited believer amen no believer wants to be confined to the ground no believer wants to be limited to the ground oh no not when you're called to sword why would you want to stay on the ground if you're called a sword into the heavens so he says Mount up Mount up Paul actually commissions the church and the book of Ephesians and he said blessed be the god in father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all what spiritual blessings but where is the spiritual blessings located at in so you mean to tell me to get it if I want all spiritual blessings I got to get in Heavenly places if I want everything from the Earth from from God I got to get to where God's going to give it to me at and he said he has called us and bless us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places the believer's position is not Earthly places it's not ground places but it's Heavenly places in Christ that's what we are called to but believer is called to Heavenly height they're called to fly that's where they're blessed at so if I'm blessed in Heavenly places then I'm not blessed in Earthly places that's the position God has elected the church to in Heavenly places the allotment of an eagle the inheritance of an eagle is Heavenly places and the church said now let's just be honest a minute there's an eagle in me that loves to soar but I got to be honest there's also a hippo in me that likes to wall in the mud and nobody says a word yeah there's a part of us that likes to be lifted up but then there's a part of me that gets down sometimes I'll say amen for you it amazes me that when God calls an individual and that God actually ordains a person and he elects them to be an eagle but he calls you to SAR and if you're called to SAR no matter how much you w in the mud like a hippo one day God will make sure you'll fulfill what he's called you to be if God has allotted you to be an eagle you can only wallow so long you can only sit on the ground so long I ain't asking you about this I'm telling you what God's called you to be if God has made that year in hell I'll think you may be the one the bride's even waiting on that God's going to make sure if that is your orain inheritance as a Son of God sooner or later God's going to shake everything off of you and you're going to find yourself soaring in the heavens let me just say it like this Jacob was not called to be a shocker Jacob was not called to be a deceiver he was called to be a prince over Israel Moses was not called to be a prince of Egypt he was called to be a prophet of God he wasn't called to be a man oh my to be able to bind Man In Chains but Moses was called to be a chain breaker amen amen Moses was not called to bind man he was called to Free Man he wants over them as the mother would her brood and he sees him he wasn't called to bind another man he was called to liberate all Man David wasn't called to be a Shepherd over just his daddy sheep he was called to fly and to be a king over Israel amen oh I thank God I'll say it again he wasn't just called to be an Earthly shepherd He was called To Be A Heavenly Shepherd let me tell you you was not called to be ordinary you was not called just to be another worker you was not called just to punch another time clock you was not called just to come to this world and just to be another person that lives their time oh no that's what Ordinary People do but I want to tell you're not called to be ordinary you're called to be extraordinary you're called to be an extraordinary people amen God would not allow us as his church to be con settled complacent or looking back at what God did yesterday is't that amazing it's the nature of man the prophet tells us he's always thanking God for what he did and he's always looking for what God's going to do but he's missing what God's doing right now and what happens if man looks back oh watch that Spirit of a thought if he looks back too long and he looks back at what God did he it limits him to the place to where he becomes satisfied because of God moved God spoke God did this and he becomes satisfied what is that doing settling for a past experience don't you see that it's been something in the mind of God that's what every denomination has done that's exactly what every organization every great organization that has come that's what they done they look back at what God did and they rallied around that and rallied around that and they want to bring everybody back to what God did or how God moved I want to tell you friends you can go to the tomb over in Israel you can look at it 500 times but it does not stop the message that he is not there but he's risen from the dead we cannot live sitting in front of the Tomb we cannot just look back and go to Jeffersonville and look at the tomb and think about the tomb oh no doubt it's a wonderful place but let me tell you something greater than that too the message that that man preach is still alive tonight it's T man it's tabernacled in human bodies and there's a people here that is soaring on that message they' come around the carcass of the world and they fed upon it it gives them strength to be able to fly this all right we're not like the chickens amen chickens are content in barnyards chickens are settled in barnards they got Barnyard ways Barnyard cultures Barnyard life come on they're content with eating bugs they're content with eating fleas they're content with eating lies amen we're not chickens and neither are we buzzards buzzards Circle dead things if you want to know what died just find the Buzzard they Circle things that is dead they Circle things that is lifeless they Circle things that used to have movement used to have action I need somebody to help me things that is dead from yesterday we are not called to be Bard and neither are we called to be vultur we're not like a vulture that's looking for an easy meal on the side of the road oh no God said you are like an unto an eagle you are called to soar you are called to be lifted up and Ascend up into the heavens Hallelujah you remember the prophet talking about that eagle in Cincinnati Zoo up in Cincinnati Ohio there ain't never a time that I don't cross under that bridge it's got the name Cincinnati and you go past it you'll see a sign it says Cincinnati Zoo when I go by there and see that sign I always think of that story that the prophet said he took his family ENT to that zoo and he saw that eagle in that inside of that cage and he said he looked at that eagle as that eagle listen to me he would run as hard as he could run he would flop his wings as hard as he could flop them but whenever he would take off he would run against the bars and fall right back down and when he would fall down the prophet said he'd knock another feather off of it and another feather off of it and the prophet said there was something in that eagle he said inside of that cage he would look up into that blue sky and there was something about that blue sky that actually was speaking to an attribute of the eagle on the inside of him and he know that's where he belonged at that's that he know that's where I'm supposed to be at so he tried over and over again but the harder he tried the more he fail I said the harder he tried the more he fail so his life was in a fallen condition right yes sir yes sir and he only fell more because he was trying he was trying to get out he was trying to be lifted up he was trying to be raised up and the prophet said oh I love that the prophet said oh my if I only had a key to that cage yes sir I say an eagle looking at an eagle an eagle looking at an eagle and that eagle on the outside thought if I only had the key to that cage I would unlock that door and I would let him go if I only had the key in other words if I had the key I would restore the eagle back to where he's called to if I had the ability to renew him if I had the ability to restore him I would open up the cage oh friends don't you see what God has done in this last age that God has sent us a prophet an eagle with a key of Revelation that has taken and unlocked the door of denominationalism and organization to do what so you you can raise up into the sphere into the allotment of your inheritance that God has called you to that's what this message has done it is not made us more Earthly it has not made us settle it has called us to the heavens absolutely you realize if you lock up an eagle too long he can literally lose his identity of who he is amen if you lock him up too long he becomes dependent they say on his handlers yes sir he becomes dependent on easy things feel my preacher coming on he becomes dependent on what's handed to him what's GI to him besides fighting for the real desire on the inside a zoo had an eagle locked up and the handlers went out there and took the key and unlocked the cage and that eagle took when he seen the door open he hopped outside of that door and he got there on the ground and on the ground he began to look around and he started hop it around a little bit and after just a few minutes after just a few minutes he hopped back into the cage do you know why because he lost his identity of who he was he went out and went right back in oh couldn't we preach there tonight he went out and went went right back in he went out and right back in hey come in go right back out go out come right back in what is it we haven't realized the responsibility of what we're called to be the longer we are dependent upon the handlers and the Flesh and the hands of what's given to us what's told to us the way you should be how you should be what you should preach what you should teach you become dependent upon those things and you remain EarthBound oh my what happened is he got comfortable in the cage may we never get there I say may we never get to may we never be so restricted from the heavens may we never get so bound upon the Earth may we never get so comfortable in time that we forget what God has called us to be do you realize David was called to be a giant slayer he was called to slay Giants that's what he's called to be that's what he's anointed to be that's what God showed him to be but what if David would have never went down to the battle come on what if David would have stayed in the nest what if David would have stayed home what if David would said Daddy I don't feel like going down there send somebody else send one of the servants down there but I want to tell you David could have never fulfilled what God had called him to be but to prove that there was something in David the prophet said that David could not wait to go see the battle he could not wait to go down do you know why there was something in David that was called to be a warrior and he was tired of sitting around Daddy's nest and looking at Daddy's house and feeding from Daddy's table he's ready to go down there fulfill the allotment that God has ordained David to be where's David need to be at on the battlefield think of the obstacles that David had to overcome think about it think of the things David had to overcome just to get on the battlefield everything tried to discourage David his brothers tried to discourage him his king tried to discourage him goli tried to discourage him fear tried to stop him reason tried to stop him can I say Common Sense try to stop him because to the human eye this battle looks absolutely impossible Israel's Army David's Brothers David's King amen David's King was looking at David through Earthly eyes amen and as long as you look at other people and as long as you look at yourself through Earthly eyes you'll see the same thing David's brothers did they was looking at David and they thinking oh my poor little B old David that great big giant but David was not looking through human eyes he was looking through the eyes of an eagle amen he was not appearing Through The Eyes of his brother he was not appearing Through The Eyes of Saul he was looking through God's eyes and through God's eyes what my sle think about whenever you talk about perspective and point of view do you read us to a to a mountain to an eagle is just a little bitty heel it's what perspective you're looking at it and whenever David look at the giant David knew he was called David knew he was chosen and David knew that God was watching over Israel and that God would bear up Israel in the wings of an eagle what would God do to his people on the battlefield that's standing for his name standing for his word standing for his people will not God bear them up absolutely come on David's higher calling was higher he could have never been God's Overcomer as long as he was Daddy's Shepherd hallelujah amen amen amen he would have never been God's Overcomer had he remained in Daddy's Nest can I ask you a question why would God put David that kind of danger why would God put David in that kind of danger I'll tell you why he could cuz David was just as safe in front of Goliath as he was in the backyard he was just as safe I want to tell you Daddy was watching over him the eagle was watching over him Oh my he was just as safe in front of a a Philistine he was just in safe as front of Israel's Army and Israel's enemy as he was if he was sitting at his Daddy's table and I could go on tonight and time would fail me to tell you how that Moses had to leave the Wilderness of his father-in-law's house and go down to the judgments of Egypt Joseph had to leave the security of Daddy's house and he ended up in pontier prison Daniel went from the pen housee to the Lion's Den amen Esther went from her uncle's house right into a place of murder and deceit and lies Ruth Ruth went from her Homeland where everything was common and she knew everybody and everybody knew her but God moves her from there to wherever a place bass caner do you know why God stirs up the nest let me quit God stirs at the nest God tells us right from the start of the book I'm going to deal with my people the way that an eagle does do you realize how profound an eagle is they are so unique an eagle's wingspan can be up to 9 foot wide his eyesight is so King he can see a rabbit in the middle of the night over a mile away poor rabbit think spiritual an eagle has incredible Vision when it's dark to every other bird and every other Bird's vision would be limited the eagle can see further than any other bird he can see higher than any other the bird he can see his prey quicker listen he can fire quicker he can get there faster he can see it further than any other bird do you realize that when an eagle mates people who's liking to Eagles when an eagle mates he mates for life they literally mate till death do them part amen and when an eagle mates they don't even mate on the ground but an eagle actually Soares High into the air and when he finds his mate Hallelujah they go into a dance in the middle of the air when they see their mate yeah come on and they do this dance in the middle of the air oh my and when they do that's where think about it their offspring is conceived in the air they come from the heavens they soar into the heavens they meet their spouse in the heavens they mate in the heavens she conceives in Heavenly places Hallelujah think about it they come from the heavens they're conceived in the heavens they are born upon the Earth but as soon as they get off the Earth they go back to where they come from and may I say all of God God's Eagles are born the same way amen that tells me listen if that tells me if an eagle is conceiving in the middle of the air you don't have to worry about an eagle cohabitating with a chicken come on that's right you don't have to worry about him cohabitating with a chicken in the barnyard come on or a buzzard or any other Bird eagles do not crossbreed there's a lot of other species that does and we'll sa that sermon for the pastor but not Eagles Eagles do not crossbreed you may crossbreed a dog you may crossbreed a horse and you may crossbreed a crowd but never an eagle in order to mate with an eagle you know what you got to be an eagle amen could we not learn could the Young people not learn something tonight from an eagle the prophet says under no circumstance should a Believer marry an unbeliever I ain't apologizing that's the message is just as good as anybody else sir under no circumstance you know what that you know why he says that is because he knows that Eagles will produce Eagles Eagles will stay with anybody know what I'm talking about yes sir does anybody know what you call female eagle think about this you call a cow you got a cow right and then you got a deer he's a a buck and then he's a doe you got a bull you got a heer you got a donkey there's a jack she's called a Jenny you got chickens one's called a rooster one's called a a hen right but anybody know what you call have you ever looked this up you ever looked this up how powerful this is do you know what you call a female eagle let me tell you an eagle amen it's Mr and Mrs Eagle yes sir on you don't call her something different from him you don't identify her something different from him she has identified with his name she's identified with his ways she's identified with his wings she's identified with who he is every attribute that he has she has she is identified with him they are Mr and M Eagle that's why the prophet tells us in the message rising of the sun he said she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him misss Jesus Christ and God say say I want to tell you I'm going to deal with you the way an eagle does his young you realize when an eagle builds its nest it never builds the nest on the ground it's never built at eye level Hallelujah they build it in high places so if you're going to build a church I mean if you're wanting to raise Eagles set them as high as you can die high they build upon the high places the Bible said they mounted up with Wings upon the high they establish themselves in the heaven they soar upon the heavens amen and when that little eaglet is hatched out in this nest and he's born up in that Cliff of the rock or Heavenly places you realize he don't view things the way chickens do that's born on the Earth whenever he's born and he gets to the place where he can look over the nest he views it from Heavenly places now you ain't with me I'll tell you what I'm saying though when you get born again and you start looking at the world and you start looking at the Earth you don't view it the way that you used to view it but you view it from Heavenly places you don't look at things the same you don't look at one another the same you don't look at nothing the same you know why it's where you're borned at you see it from an elevated place or an elevated position amen I don't care what family you come out of or what your last name is when you get born again you look at things different when you get born again you don't View the same way you used to Paul said he has raised us up together and has made us to sit in Heavenly places born do you realize before a mother Eagle how many beli in predestination before a mother eagle ever lays her eggs she's already got a place prepared amen before they're ever born she don't oh my goodness I'm fixing have some egg I I need to place but notice she's already working on the nest I said she's already making a place for them to dwell at amen think about it so she's already making ready for the new birth before it ever happens so she's getting ready she builds this nest in the high places Eagle's Nest can be around 7t in diameter and the eagle builds the nest out of sticks and Limbs and thistles and Thorns yeah I said it right don't miss that she builds it out of sticks and Limbs and thistles Bramble brush Thorns yes sir so the nest itself is a collection of branches that Mama eagle and papa eagle has picked up so you can tell where the eagle has been by the branches that makes up the nest of Alla the branches is a historical record of all of where he's come from you see what I'm saying sir so he's been preparing a place he's been making a place so it records the journey that she's been in this field and she's been in this field and she's been in this field and look at here here she comes and she's got a bunch of thorns you know why that's showing where she's come from are you hearing me tonight the thorns and the sticks is a testimony of where she's been what she's been through what she's had to overcome that's how you got here you would listen it shows you how that she has overcome to get you to a place where you can be born again come on somebody she gathers sticks and thorns and when she gathers them together she don't just come and lay them down oh no she actually places the sticks in the place think about this She lays them in order amen amen She lays them in order and she strategically places the sharp or the pointed ends of the stick she puts them in the nest where they're pointed out and then she takes the thorns and she puts it around the nest to where they're pointed out all right do you know why because she knows that enem is going to try to get her born again eaglets so she builds the nest as a place of Refuge a place of safety do you realize that a line will not cross Thorns I've been in Africa I've been there in the in safaris and you watch in Africa the Thorns are really really long in Africa and if you're going to go out in Africa at night and and you want to put up your tents if you're out on on on a on a walk and you're you're you want to make sure that the the lies can't get you so you want to know which way they're coming from what you do is you put the thorns on the back side of you or the weak side that way you can't be attacked from a blind spot because a line will not cross the Thorns are you hearing me but thank God we had a line that came down to Earth and this line crossed the thorns and waited into the thorns and took the Thorns so that you can be born again yes sir so she puts the thorns on the outside Mountain line won't cross the Thorns Bobcats won't cross the Thorns because it's the protection of that eagle she wants nothing thanks spiritual nothing can get around the Thorns do you realize think spiritually the only way the only way that you can be around the Thorns is you got to be born on the right side if you're born on the right side you don't have to worry about the Thorns they've already been bore for you if you're born if you're born on the right side you don't have to worry about the sticks protruding out you're born on the right side so the eagle hatches and something takes place that is so crucial whenever the eaglet is born born do you realize and this is the same with a lot of different animals you know just like it was when I was in in Africa that you realize when a hippo is born I'm sorry when a rhinoceros is born you realize that a baby rhino has to be in constant contact with its mother a man that does Rehabilitation down the Mula hola Rehabilitation place down in South Africa they was taking these animals and they was actually trying to save them people would come in and shoot the rhinos and take their horns it's worth several million dollars in China they think there's some type of magical potion in so the posters come in and they shoot these rhinos to get their horn and that horn may be worth $2 million and then there's a Babys side it's got a nub on its nose about that long they'll shoot it too because they realize the less there are the more value it is right so they was bringing these they was bringing these rhinos in whenever they find these babies and they they started to lose them at first until they found out it's got to be in constant contact with its mother so there's actually a student that goes there sleeps outside puts on this big outfit and is constant contact with that r that rhin and they raised that Rhino for its life I know I seen one they said there's a little baby about to come out there's a little baby and whatever you do don't stand in front of it so they opened up the gate and it was no little bitty you could feel the Earth moving on your feet as he ran out there and I thought Lord God have mercy I watched that Rhino come out went over to a gate took its horn opened it up and went outside I said what y'all doing she said I'm taking him for a walk W that's a big pet a baby eagle has to be in contact with its mother there's something that takes place in an eagle it's called the imparting or the imprinting on a baby eagle a newly hatched eagle has a lot to learn listen to this its most important figures in its life is its parents good very good and eaget must quickly be able to identify and bomb with them instead of another speci this parental recognition is known as filio imprinting Eagles pH filio imprinting often occur by learning to recognize the parents voice my sheep hear my amen so they identify who mama is by her voice no wonder Jesus says he that has an ear let him here birds can also imprint on their nesting sight which can help them listen to this Eagles imprint their nesting sight which can help them find their way back to the territory later on in life and it guides their choice of testing sites for their own young so whenever you receive an imprint from The Nest something has moved upon that eagle that it has the ability to find its way back and if you train up a child in the way that he should go come on somebody an eaglet grows another type of repenting occurs which they learn to identify with eagles as a species listen to this and the first thing they need to know is they're an eagle too amen it's hard to identify any other Eagle unless you know you're an eagle they call it the importance of the socialization of the eagle he needs to know what he is and the more he's around other Eagles come on somebody the more he's around other eagles he identifies with eagle weights he sees an eagle fly he knows he's supposed to fly he hears an eagle scream he knows he's supposed to Green Mama's got a beak and I got a beak Mama's got talons and I got talons Mama's got wings and I got Wings Mama scream an ice cream what is it doing it's recognizing this is what I am everything that she is that's what I am he's an eagle I'm an eagle whatever he is I'm identified with him Hallelujah there Comes A Time as I take this from Deuteronomy Moses said the eagle stirs The Nest up science today calls it fledging the mother Eagle knows it's a dangerous time if an Eagle St stays too long to the nest but it's also dangerous if it don't stays stay long enough so if it gets put if it's put out the nest too early it'll die if it stays there too long premature fledging occurs an eagle will leave the nest too early if it's in contact by human activity so if humans ever get their hands on it it causes death pleas premature fledging takes place when it's influenced by outside human activity I thought that's so powerful yes sir so there's a season that the eagle needs to leave the nest and God knows exactly when that needs to be at and for everybody it's different everybody matures at a different way a different rate everybody grows at a different rate ain't not a there's not one Christian the same everybody's born different at a different time a different season learn quicker than the others everybody is different but there comes a time that Mama knows she's got to stir up that Nest think about what she does so the place that was a blessing for so long think about it it can become a place of too much security and think about it so what she does is to get them ready to leave she takes the fur out of the nest so the fur which protected the eaglets from the Thorns is now not protecting them they're actually protruding through and it pokes a little Eagle Ben Zachary was watching some Eagles earlier this year they was born last December and we watched them all up into the summer I was watching as the mother had taken all the stuff in the bottom of the nest and I tell you it was incredible I was it was like a boneyard in there where she brought all kinds of fish and she took everything out of the nest and I was watching there was one of them there was one of those little Eagles oh it loved to lay in the bottom of the nest every time you turn it on my she would be right there laying on the bottom of the nest until finally I watched her go over to the corner and she was getting ready to for go bed down and when she bed it down she must have bted down right on a thorn CA she jumped up amen and God knows if he allows us to stay the way we are we'll never learn how to walk the way we need to walk or fly the way we need to fly so what does she do stirs up the nest and when the eagle comes into the nest you always know when she's coming because the little eaglet starts standing up you know why before she ever gets to the nest she always announces her approach before she ever gets there and when she comes to the nest she takes her big wings and goes up flopping and all the little feathers and stuff just leaves the nest and the babies are there I watched them I watched them I thought how's she going to get them out of this Nest so what Mama did is that she quit flying into the middle of the nest and taking the the the trout and then stuff and ripping it up and feeding it to them cuz she'd done that for months but I watched her one day she flew down she didn't land in the nest she landed on the limb so if the eaglets want to eat you got to go where the food is you should have seen them the first time they come out a little bit Topsy Turvy they had their wings open most of the time you could tell they was a little bit scared yeah but the longer they sit on the limb the more comfortable they got are you hearing me can you imagine days of the nest was coming to the end because now they're sitting like every other Eagle on the limb until finally it comes time to learn Le how to fly amen what's Mama do I love the way the prophet says it the prophet tells us that Mama Eagle will take those little eaglets and put them on her wings and she'll go way up into the heavens and she'll turn just a little bit and the eaglet fall off and he said they start turning over and over and over one time they're on their back the other time they're upright other time they're on the head other time they're upside down they're falling and that's all they are they fallen and Mama at any minute can swoop down underneath them now I'm not talking about little B chicks like that I'm talking about these are pretty good size Eagles by this time but what are they doing they're learning how to fly and I thought oh my what would keep that eagle what would keep it from thinking what happens if Mama forgets about me and she drops me off and and I'm falling and I I hit the ground well see you got to understand this that a eagle can fly about 40 miles an hour straight but when an eagle puts its wings back and it's going to a nose dive it can fly of speeds of 90 to 100 miles an hour which tells the little eaglet this she's been watching Mama her whole life that was somewhere I would fall and I would Start Tumbling that Mama has the ability to fly faster than I can fall let's stand our feet tonight I said mama has the ability to fly faster than what you can fall that's the kind of God that we serve tonight don't you realize God allows things come into our life to stir the nest up Thorns thistles troubles trials tests discomforts all of those things what's God doing it stirring up the nest so that he'll finally get us to the place where we'll learn how to fly oh my Eagles are so incredible as an eagle starts learning how to fly this oil starts building up on him because Eagles goes through Seasons to where the oil gets on their wings and their wings starts actually taking on debris and all types of fil upon their wings and what happens is is that eagle goes through a stage called the molting stage and during the molting stage whenever the Eagle's Wings starts getting Fray what happens is is that oil causes its feathers to fray so the eagle knows it's got to go down so what it does is it goes down into the valley and when it gets in the valley he starts pulling The Frayed feathers he starts pulling them out out because an eagle can still fly with 75% of its feathers pulled out it still has the ability to fly that means it can go through some stuff but there's sometimes he gets down the ground and he's got too many feathers that's frayed he can look up into the heavens and calcium deposits begins to build up on his face until it gets over the top of his beak and he has to go over to a rock and they start pecking on the Rock to break it off and if an eagle is in a valley like it was there in North Carolina a few years ago when the man went up there to the Eagle Rock and was looking down and they seen these eagles flying in the heavens and he got over there and he said look how beautiful these Eagles are he said they're beautiful he said but let me show you something else and he took him to the other side where there's a great valley at and there was three or four Eagles down there that was in the molten stage down in the valley and he said what's wrong with them Eagles he said the in the molten stage and while they're in the molten stage their feet swell up and they can't walk the way they need to walk and their feathers become frayed and they can't fly the way they need to fly so he goes against The Rock and he pecks on that rock to break the calcium off Hallelujah he said well if he can't fly he can't catch his own food how in the world is the eagle going to live he said that's the beautiful thing about it and while he's standing there watching these Eagles in the valley here comes some other eagles over the top of the Eagles in the valley he said what is that he's said let me tell you what's going on you see them Eagles right there every one of them Eagles at one time in their life has been down in that Valley they've been right there where the rest of them Eagles are and they know why they're in that Valley that they can't eat the way they need to eat so what they do is they go kill the Eagles that's in the valley they go kill them a rabbit and they take that meat over the top of those Eagles they can't move and they drop the meat down where they're at so that the others Eagles can get strength because they know if they don't eat the way they need to eat they won't have strength to fight for their own lives aren't you glad God sends people by your way aren't you glad God sends Preachers by your way sermons byy your way somebody text you call you email you whatever it is what are they doing they're dropping a little bit of meat down there for you you may have been a little bit disturbed a little bit down a little bit desponded and about that time an eagle comes by where you're at why is it they been where you they know what it is to go through it let's buy our hearts tonight blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God hallelujah I don't even know who needed to hear this tonight and I don't you don't even have to tell me but I want to remind you tonight that Mom egole can fly faster than what you can fall you may be down and discouraged tonight you may look at your life and you may see all types of calcium around your beak you may see your feet swelled up and busted open you may see your feathers frayed but I want to tell you you serve a God that God's in control does not the eagle Mount up at his command does not God command other eagles to help other eagles does not the Bible say sons of God are led by the spirit of God hallelujah heavenly father I pray that you'd search every every one of us tonight Lord from the front to the back lord

where you think that you can't overcome and you think that you're not good enough and you think that and you think you'll never make it and all the things that come into our natural mind he said but let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus took that scripture out of Philippians and preached the whole message on it to be identified with Jesus Christ so it ain't the way we feel or the way we think or the way we see things but have the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ identifies you with who you really are I think that's powerful the T that God would come and and remind the Church
