[35:08] bow our heads together and ask him to
[35:10] come. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[35:13] just thank you for an opportunity just
[35:15] to come and fellowship around the word
[35:17] of God. And Lord, how we love you, Lord.
[35:20] We thank you for your word. And Lord,
[35:23] how you've been so good to us, Lord. And
[35:25] we just ask you that you would help each
[35:28] one of these, Lord. Those needs that
[35:29] have been written. And Lord, the hands
[35:31] that have been raised, Lord, you know
[35:33] every heart and what we have need of,
[35:35] Lord. You know every trouble, every
[35:37] financial, every family trouble. Lord,
[35:40] every every sickness, it doesn't matter
[35:42] what it is, Lord. You know all things.
[35:44] And Lord, we just rely upon you this
[35:46] morning to come and meet the needs of
[35:48] your people. Lord, we just ask you and
[35:50] we give you the liberty to have your way
[35:52] in this service, Lord. And then we'll
[35:54] give you the glory for all that's done.
[35:56] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[36:00] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[36:02] Amen. How many can say that God's done
[36:05] something for you this morning? Amen.
[36:06] How many can say God's done something
[36:08] for you? Amen. Isn't he a He's a
[36:10] wonderful God and he's worthy of our
[36:12] praise. Amen. I just love the Lord. I
[36:14] always uh have a a thanks in my heart
[36:17] for what God has done. And Amen. So we
[36:19] we want to sing that. You're playing
[36:21] there.
[36:23] I've got so much to thank him for.
[36:28] So much to praise him for. You see, God
[36:34] has been so good to me. I mean, testify
[36:39] that this morning when I think
[36:43] of all he's done and where
[36:48] he's brought me from. I've got
[36:52] so much to thank him for.
[36:57] till I know when I look around and see
[37:03] all the good things that he's done for
[37:07] me. I know I'm not worthy of them all.
[37:15] But I know his blessings
[37:18] he freely gives. And I owe my life to
[37:24] him. I've got
[37:27] so much to thank him for.
[37:32] Well, I've got so much to thank him for.
[37:39] So much to praise him for.
[37:43] He's been so very good to me.
[37:49] Oh, when I think
[37:53] of all that my God has done
[37:58] and where I'm from, I've got
[38:02] so much to thank him for.
[38:07] Well, I know sometimes
[38:10] while on this way, I just stop
[38:14] and I kneel and pray. Thank you Lord for
[38:20] all that you have done for me.
[38:24] And I know when I reach
[38:28] heaven shore, let me Lord near once
[38:33] more. Cuz I've got Thank you, Lord. So
[38:37] much to thank him for.
[38:41] Oh, I've got so much to thank him for.
[38:49] to praise him for.
[38:52] He's been so very good to me.
[38:58] Oh, when I think
[39:01] of all that my God has done.
[39:07] Oh, I've got so much
[39:11] to thank him for. As we invite our
[39:13] brother Josh to come. Well, I've got so
[39:17] much to thank him for,
[39:21] so much to praise him for.
[39:25] He's been
[39:28] [Music]
[39:36] all done.
[39:39] [Music]
[39:44] So much to pray for. Can we sing that
[39:47] one more time now,
[39:51] much
[39:58] [Music]
[40:02] so good to me.
[40:07] [Music]
[40:10] Hallelujah.
[40:12] and where he's brought me from.
[40:16] [Music]
[40:19] Hallelujah. M4.
[40:23] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[40:24] praise this morning?
[40:27] Has he been good to you?
[40:30] Giving you breath in your lungs, health
[40:32] in your body, wonderful church family,
[40:35] the message of the hour.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. What else could he give us except
[40:39] the body change? And I believe that's
[40:41] that's coming right upon us. And one
[40:44] morning we're going to wake up for the
[40:46] last time, fight our last mind battle.
[40:48] And what a glorious day that is going to
[40:50] be. Well, God bless you this morning. It
[40:53] is good to be here with y'all today. I
[40:55] appreciate the invite and opportunity to
[40:57] be ministering. I pray something will be
[41:00] said to be a blessing today. If you
[41:02] would have your scriptures, let's open
[41:04] our Bible to 1 John 4:9.
[41:08] I'm going to read that down to the 10th
[41:09] verse. than 1 John 5 and2
[41:15] bring greetings from our home church.
[41:17] Our pastor, brother Wendel Martin, and
[41:18] the saints there send their greetings.
[41:20] My family's not with me this time, so
[41:23] you'll have to forgive me. We got a baby
[41:25] coming here in a month or so, and so she
[41:28] is staying close to home there. We got
[41:30] two kiddos right now, which are pretty
[41:33] honory. And so, uh, uh, traveling while
[41:36] you're nice and pregnant with two
[41:38] toddlers ain't too very fun. So, you
[41:40] just have to forgive us this morning.
[41:42] But first John 4:9,
[41:46] in this was manifested the love of God
[41:48] towards us, because that God sent his
[41:51] only begotten son into the world that we
[41:54] might live through him. Herein is love,
[41:57] not that we loved God, but that he loved
[41:59] us and sent a son to be the propitiation
[42:03] for our sins. In 1 John 5:2,
[42:09] by this we know that we love the
[42:11] children of God when we love God and
[42:14] keep his commandments. For this is the
[42:16] love of God that we keep his
[42:17] commandments, and his commandments are
[42:19] not grievious. For whatsoever is born of
[42:22] God overcomemeth the world, and this is
[42:24] the victory that overcomemeth the world,
[42:27] even our faith. Amen. Can we bow our
[42:29] heads this morning? Dear gracious
[42:31] heavenly father, Lord, how humbled we
[42:34] are to come into your presence today,
[42:36] Lord, as we feel you drawing near us
[42:39] this morning. We ask that you would just
[42:41] feel welcome here among us today. Lord,
[42:43] you know the desires of the hearts and
[42:45] the the needs of your people. Father, we
[42:48] ask that you would just as the word
[42:49] would come forth, may it be inspired by
[42:52] your spirit. Lord, may it strengthen the
[42:54] hearts of your people and courage.
[42:56] Father, those who need healing in the
[42:58] body, Lord, I ask that you would come in
[43:00] a mighty way today. Father, we commit
[43:02] the service into your hands in Jesus
[43:05] name. Amen. You may be seated this
[43:08] morning. I just have a simple thought,
[43:10] but it would be uh faith is our victory.
[43:14] And brother Brandham, he he would tell
[43:15] us that faith and love work together. He
[43:19] would say in the message perfect faith
[43:21] here, just like a young couple, you take
[43:23] a young man and a young woman and they
[43:26] they're in love. They fall in love one
[43:27] with another. As they begin to go along
[43:30] and begin to know one another more,
[43:33] their hearts just begin to beat as one.
[43:35] See, yet they're not husband and wife
[43:38] yet, but their love binds them together
[43:41] and they have confidence one and
[43:43] another. Now, if they really love one
[43:45] another, really love, and you know this
[43:47] girl loves you and she knows you love
[43:49] her, you've got confidence. He says,
[43:52] faith in one another. And if you got
[43:54] faith in one another, he says, if you
[43:56] didn't, you better not marry her. See,
[43:58] notice you have you have to have faith
[44:01] and you separate them. put one in the
[44:03] extreme south, one in the extreme north,
[44:06] and there's still the love that beats
[44:08] for one another. No matter where they're
[44:10] at, they're just as true to one another
[44:12] as they can be because they love one
[44:15] another. And he says, "And if you love
[44:17] the Lord, not just trying to dodge hell,
[44:19] but you love the Lord, then you have
[44:22] faith in God." See, if you love him. And
[44:25] I think that is incredible. You're not
[44:27] just trying to dodge hell or or escape
[44:30] the tribulation, but there's a love
[44:32] there. And and he would talk about the a
[44:34] young couple that if you know she loves
[44:37] you and she knows you love her, then
[44:39] there's confidence one in another. So
[44:42] love is more than just a lip service or
[44:45] more than just words. But love has
[44:48] actions behind it. And so whenever you
[44:51] love one another, there's actions that
[44:53] follows it. And so I believe the love of
[44:55] God is more than just a a theology. But
[44:59] the love of God has an expression where
[45:01] we can feel the love of God which
[45:04] produces a confidence in our life
[45:07] towards the word of God. And brother
[45:09] Brandon would talk about the couple that
[45:11] would would get married and he was a new
[45:13] Christian and she she was a Christian
[45:15] for some time and he she would tell him
[45:17] if you ever fall into sin, you ever uh
[45:20] fall into some things, don't run away
[45:22] from home, but come back to me and we'll
[45:25] pray together and we'll find our way to
[45:27] Calvary. And this man was eating lunch
[45:29] with his buddies and would would tell
[45:31] him, "How can I portray a love like
[45:33] that? How can I ever do anything wrong
[45:37] with a love like that? He knew that it
[45:39] was more than just words. But there was
[45:42] an expression that even if I do fall,
[45:45] she's going to be there. But why would I
[45:48] do it when there's an expression there?
[45:50] And so I believe that the love is
[45:53] expressive towards us. But our love
[45:55] towards God is expressive as well.
[45:58] Because many times we love God, we love
[46:00] God, but there's an expression if
[46:03] there's a true love there. And the Bible
[46:05] would tell us in John 14:5, if you love
[46:08] me, keep my commandments. In other
[46:10] words, there's actions behind that love.
[46:13] And and what's incredible is you can't
[46:16] put the love of God there. Only God can
[46:18] put the love there. And so, if God is
[46:21] calling you and has placed the love
[46:23] there, just follow the leadership of
[46:26] that predestinated scene. If it's
[46:28] pulling you to the word of God, let that
[46:30] love be expressive and just follow what
[46:34] God is calling you to do. And brother
[46:36] Brandon would say in total deliverance.
[46:38] We are men and women. We're also
[46:40] Christians. If he's our example, let us
[46:43] completely deliver ourselves into the
[46:46] hands of the Holy Ghost that we might be
[46:48] subjects of the kingdom of God. And I
[46:51] love that quote because he he recognizes
[46:53] we are men and we're women. But then he
[46:56] stops and he says we're also Christians.
[46:58] I like that because many times we use
[47:01] our humanity as excuses. How many's ever
[47:04] been there? You lose a temper. Well, I'm
[47:06] just human. You know, you you you tell a
[47:08] little lie. Well, I'm just human. You do
[47:11] this. Well, I'm just human. Brother
[47:13] Brandham says we're men and women, but
[47:15] we're also Christians. So, don't forget,
[47:18] even though you're in fallen flesh, the
[47:20] Apostle Paul would say, we're not
[47:22] subject to the flesh. We're not debtors
[47:24] to the flesh any longer. So even though
[47:27] we're in a fallen human being if there's
[47:30] a love there, let that love be
[47:32] expressive. But how do you express the
[47:35] love that God places there? Brother tell
[47:38] us, let us completely deliver oursel
[47:40] into the hands of the Holy Ghost, which
[47:43] is a hard thing to do sometimes, ain't
[47:45] it? Because we have our own our our
[47:47] rights. And brother Brandon would tell
[47:48] us that that that that the man likes to
[47:51] be in control. And he would say to prove
[47:53] that you get in a car with somebody and
[47:56] you're in the passenger seat. He says
[47:58] you're telling them to turn here, turn
[48:00] there. You're pumping the brakes trying
[48:02] to slow the car down. He says that
[48:04] proves man likes to be in control. But
[48:07] in order to surrender yourself to the
[48:10] hands of the Holy Ghost, you have to
[48:12] forfeit all of your rights. Oh, come on
[48:16] now. But that is a hard thing to do. But
[48:18] once you forfeit your rights, then you
[48:21] become a subject of the kingdom of God.
[48:24] So even though we're walking in legisa,
[48:28] we're subject of another kingdom. And
[48:30] this kingdom, there is no end to it. And
[48:33] so why would I want to be subject to
[48:36] this flesh when there's another kingdom
[48:39] that is calling me up higher that if I
[48:41] can surrender myself to the to the love
[48:44] of God, then I can be a subject. And
[48:47] brother Brandham Matelis, you forfeit
[48:50] all of your rights to the kingdom of
[48:52] God's sake. And so I think that that is
[48:55] incredible because if you want to see
[48:56] the devil get nervous, forfeit your life
[48:59] to him. If you want to see him get get
[49:02] nervous and and lose every hold on your
[49:05] life, forfeit all of your rights,
[49:07] forfeit all of your opinions, forfeit
[49:09] what you think is right, and you watch
[49:12] the devil get nervous cuz you remember
[49:14] that with Goliath was boasting against
[49:16] the children of Israel. And what's
[49:18] incredible is brother Brandham would
[49:19] tell us that when the devil thinks he
[49:22] has the upper hand, then he's going to
[49:23] boast against you. And the reason why he
[49:26] Goliath was boasting because he knew
[49:29] there wasn't a man that could stand up
[49:31] against him. But then there was a David
[49:34] that would say, you know, who's this
[49:35] uncircumcised Philistine? And you notice
[49:38] that once Goliath was brought into
[49:40] subjection, it was no longer the
[49:43] Philistines chasing the Israelites, but
[49:46] now the Israelites was chasing the
[49:48] Philistines. How come their greatest
[49:50] weapon was brought into subjection? Then
[49:53] once that happened then the enemy got
[49:56] nervous. Brother Brandham would tell us
[49:58] who's your greatest enemy? Not your
[50:00] neighbor, not even the devil, but you're
[50:03] your greatest enemy. So once you bring
[50:05] the body into subjection, which is the
[50:08] devil's greatest weapon against you,
[50:11] that's when the devil gets nervous.
[50:13] That's why he don't want you to
[50:15] surrender yourself to the hands of the
[50:18] Holy Ghost because it's no longer him
[50:20] chasing you, but now you're chasing him.
[50:23] Oh, when I say that in a meeting like
[50:25] this morning, we can put every spirit on
[50:27] the run this morning. We can put every
[50:29] depression on the run this morning
[50:32] because it's not what we can do. We're
[50:34] surrendering oursel to another kingdom.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're surrendering oursel to
[50:41] another kingdom. You can look at 1st
[50:42] Samuel 17 and 51. Therefore David ran
[50:46] and stood upon the Philistine and took
[50:49] his sword and drew it out of the sheath
[50:51] thereof and slew him and cut off his
[50:54] head therein. And when the Philistines
[50:56] saw the champion was dead, they fled. Oh
[51:00] my. Whenever the devil sees that you
[51:03] bring your body into subjection, they
[51:06] will flee. Submit yourself to God.
[51:08] Resist the devil and he shall eat.
[51:11] Before you can you can resist the devil,
[51:14] you got to submit yourself. Oh,
[51:16] hallelujah. You got to deliver yourself
[51:19] to the hands of the Holy Ghost. And that
[51:22] you have to do that even after you're
[51:24] born again. The Apostle Paul would tell
[51:26] us, "I keep my body and bring it under
[51:28] subjection." Listen, when I preach to
[51:30] others, I myself should be a cast away.
[51:33] It was a dying daily. Brother Brand was
[51:36] it was a delivering up daily. Jesus
[51:38] would say, "Take up your cross daily."
[51:40] and follow me. So even when you're born
[51:43] again, you have to deliver yourself into
[51:46] the hands of the Holy Ghost. And brother
[51:49] Brandon would talk about Moses and how
[51:51] that he would completely surrender
[51:53] himself to the hands of God and he would
[51:56] be delivered from sheep hurting to to
[52:00] hurt God's sheep. So before he could
[52:02] hurt God's sheep, he had to surrender
[52:05] himself up to fulfill the purpose of
[52:08] God. Then brother Brandham would tell us
[52:10] that when he would surrender himself
[52:12] then God could trust him. And I thought
[52:15] that was a powerful thing because
[52:17] whenever Moses would come against the
[52:19] Red Sea, what would God say to Moses?
[52:22] Why cry unto me? Speak and go forward.
[52:26] In other words, I've entrusted you with
[52:28] the kingdom. Don't complain about it.
[52:31] Don't cry about it. I've trusted you
[52:34] with something greater than the Red Sea.
[52:36] I've trusted you something greater than
[52:39] the wilderness that you're going to walk
[52:41] through. Why cry unto me? Speak and go
[52:45] forward. You see, too many times we
[52:47] think that we're the only one trusting.
[52:49] But God has placed trust in us as well.
[52:52] That's why he says, "Why cry? Speak and
[52:55] go forward. You You say into this
[52:57] mountain and doubt not, and it will be
[52:59] as you say it." What is it? He's trusted
[53:02] you with the kingdom of God. You're
[53:05] operating in faith and saying, "Satan,
[53:08] out of my way. Depression, out of my
[53:10] way. Anxiety, out of my way." Whatever
[53:13] it is, we've been entrusted with the
[53:15] kingdom of God. Hallelujah. And if you
[53:18] look at the the the life of Job, before
[53:21] Job was ever in the position to say,
[53:24] "God giveth and God taketh away. Blessed
[53:27] be the holy name." God was first
[53:30] trusting him. whenever Satan was roaming
[53:32] to and fro looking for somebody he may
[53:35] devour and it was God that would say
[53:38] have you considered my servant Job and
[53:41] what's incredible is the devil had
[53:43] considered Job because he looked at him
[53:45] and says oh yeah but you got a hedge
[53:48] around him you got this you got that if
[53:50] you take the hedge away he will curse
[53:53] you to your face what would God say do
[53:56] it there's not a man that is more
[53:58] upright than my man which is there upon
[54:01] the earth named Job. So before Job was
[54:04] ever put in a position to trust God, God
[54:08] was already trusting him. Hallelujah.
[54:11] And before you ever go through a trial,
[54:14] God has first entrusted you. Said you
[54:17] can do it. You can prevail. You can
[54:20] overcome. No matter what comes against
[54:22] you, I'm entrusting you with an
[54:25] authority to prevail. That's why you
[54:28] can't give up when you're in the hard
[54:30] times. You've got the authority of the
[54:32] kingdom behind you. Get some faith about
[54:35] you and say, "Greater is he that is in
[54:38] me than he that is in the world."
[54:41] &gt;&gt; You've been entrusted with the kingdom
[54:43] of God.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows how much he can
[54:48] trust you. Brother Brandon would say,
[54:50] "Job didn't question. He fell on his
[54:52] face and worshiped God." Hallelujah. He
[54:54] said, "The Lord give and the Lord take
[54:56] him away. Blessed be the name of the
[54:59] Lord." He says, "There you are." God
[55:01] know he can trust Job. And God knows how
[55:04] much he can trust you. Ain't that
[55:07] powerful? The same God that was trusting
[55:10] Job says you can try it, but he's not
[55:13] going to curse me. Is the same God that
[55:15] is trusting you. That's why he would say
[55:18] there's going to be a bride without spot
[55:20] and without wrinkle. There's going to be
[55:22] an overcomer in this last age. He's put
[55:25] confidence in you. It's his love
[55:28] expressing itself and and relaying his
[55:31] confidence saying you can do it. Even
[55:35] when the times get hard, I trust you.
[55:38] And what's incredible as brother Brandon
[55:40] would tell us, many people think the
[55:42] love of God is a parental love with no
[55:45] suffering. But he says that's not true.
[55:47] He says his love is an elective love. So
[55:50] in other words, his love won't keep you
[55:53] from the hard times, but it keeps you in
[55:56] the hard times. Hallelujah. His elective
[55:59] love don't go away when you're in the
[56:02] lion's d, but his love expresses itself
[56:05] and becomes the becomes the angel that
[56:08] will steal the lion's mouth. You see,
[56:10] God didn't pull Daniel out of the lion's
[56:13] den, but he came and was in the midst of
[56:16] it with him. Oh, come on now. God may
[56:19] not pull you out of the trial, but he
[56:22] gives grace to endure. You see, his love
[56:25] expresses itself. He might not yank you
[56:28] out of it, but he comes and he becomes
[56:30] the fourth man in the fire. Come on now.
[56:33] You see, you can look at the Apostle
[56:35] Paul. The Bible would tell us that the
[56:38] devil would come and buffet him. Brother
[56:40] Brandon would tell us that there is blow
[56:42] after blow. And then the Apostle Paul
[56:44] would say, "There's a thorn in my
[56:47] flesh." Y'all remember him talking about
[56:48] that? And what I think is incredible is
[56:51] the Apostle Paul types him as something
[56:54] in the flesh. And that's what the devil
[56:56] comes and he attacks is your flesh. He
[57:00] knows he can't get your soul. The Bible
[57:02] says we're sealed till the day of our
[57:03] redemption. So if you're ever filled
[57:05] with the Holy Ghost, he can never get
[57:08] your your soul, but he can still tempt
[57:11] your flesh. Right? Our flesh is never
[57:13] saved. That's why you got to bring your
[57:15] body into subjection. But here the
[57:18] Apostle Paul said, "There's a thorn in
[57:20] my flesh." And he cries unto the Lord
[57:23] three times, "Take this affirmity from
[57:26] me." And what would God say to him in my
[57:29] and your weakness, my strength can be
[57:31] made perfect? My grace is sufficient for
[57:35] thee. So he didn't take the thorn out of
[57:38] his flesh, but he gave him grace to
[57:40] endure. Hallelujah. He might not take
[57:43] the thorn out of your flesh, but he
[57:46] gives you grace to endure. It says love
[57:50] being expressive.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And saying, "My love is
[57:54] elective even though you're in the midst
[57:57] of decision, in the valley of
[57:59] temptation. Here's grace to endure."
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, and all we can do is trust the
[58:05] grace. And and it's incredible because
[58:07] the Bible the Bible would tell us that
[58:10] Jesus was led into the wilderness to be
[58:13] tempted, right? And what would the devil
[58:15] tempt Jesus with? Bread. How come he had
[58:18] just fasted 40 days and 40 nights? And
[58:21] the Bible says afterward he was a
[58:24] hunger. How come the devil didn't come
[58:26] to him on the first day? Because he
[58:29] wasn't hungry yet. His flesh was strong
[58:32] on the first day, the second day, the
[58:34] third day, but it was the 40th day when
[58:37] his his body was hungry. His his mind
[58:40] was probably playing tricks on him. Then
[58:42] the devil came against his flesh. Turn
[58:45] these stones into bread. What was it? He
[58:49] was tempting his flesh, but Jesus would
[58:52] show us how to fight. But it is written.
[58:56] It is written, then the devil would
[58:57] tempt him again, if thou be the son of
[59:00] God.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; What's incredible is the devil wasn't
[59:04] saying, you're not the son of God, but
[59:07] he was putting the question mark there.
[59:09] And too many times when our flesh is
[59:11] weak, our mind is beaten down, the devil
[59:14] comes with the questions. If you're
[59:16] really the bride, you want to be here.
[59:18] If you was really rapturing material,
[59:21] you wouldn't be going through this
[59:22] thing. He won't tell you you're not the
[59:24] bride, but he puts that question there.
[59:27] But then Jesus said, "But it is also
[59:30] written." And what's incredible is Jesus
[59:33] would have discernment enough to look at
[59:36] him and would say, "You might be
[59:37] twisting scripture just like you did to
[59:40] Eve, but I'm of another breed."
[59:42] Hallelujah. I'm the royal seed of
[59:45] Abraham, and I'm not looking at natural
[59:48] seed of Abraham. This is the royal seed
[59:51] of Abraham. Oh my. Just like the first E
[59:54] fail, you are not going to fall.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus would look at him and
[1:00:00] say, "But it is also written." It's
[1:00:02] incredible because Jesus had discernment
[1:00:06] to look at him and know that he's
[1:00:08] twisting scripture against him. Because
[1:00:11] if you're the elect, scripture cannot
[1:00:14] condemn you. Come on now. You see
[1:00:16] there's a difference. And and I was
[1:00:18] preaching there. Remember, brother
[1:00:19] Andrew was in Czech Republic and this a
[1:00:21] month and a half or so ago, and this
[1:00:23] really struck me while I was preaching.
[1:00:26] There's a difference between conviction
[1:00:28] and condemnation because the devil comes
[1:00:31] and condemns you with scripture and beat
[1:00:34] you down and beat you down. And what
[1:00:36] condemnation does is it knocks you down
[1:00:39] and don't show you a way of escape. It
[1:00:42] don't point you to grace, but
[1:00:44] conviction, it shows you where you're
[1:00:46] wrong, but it points you to grace. You
[1:00:49] see, there's a difference. God does not
[1:00:51] condemn you. He convicts you. The devil
[1:00:54] condemns you and says there's no grace.
[1:00:56] But what would the Apostle Paul would we
[1:00:58] would say? There was therefore now no
[1:01:00] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:01:03] Jesus. So here the devil was trying to
[1:01:06] condemn Christ with scripture. If you
[1:01:09] really are the son of God, you would use
[1:01:12] the scripture. If you really are the son
[1:01:14] of God, but there was a discernment to
[1:01:17] know the scripture cannot condemn me.
[1:01:20] And we need some more people like that.
[1:01:22] That when the devil comes and tries to
[1:01:25] condemn you with scripture, saying,
[1:01:27] "You've sent your day of grace away.
[1:01:29] There's no grace for you. You're too far
[1:01:31] in addiction." That there can be a
[1:01:33] discernment. And we say, "But it is also
[1:01:36] written, my name is engraved in the palm
[1:01:39] of this hand." Hallelujah. I know my
[1:01:43] sheep, and my sheep know me, and I will
[1:01:46] not lose a one.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; It's a discernment that when your flesh
[1:01:50] is weak, we still got confidence in him
[1:01:54] that he cannot condemn me.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Job knew. And whenever his
[1:01:59] friends came against him and says,
[1:02:01] "You're a secret sinner." In other
[1:02:03] words, they were telling him, "You're
[1:02:05] under condemnation. The reason these
[1:02:07] trials is coming against you is because
[1:02:09] God is condemning you." But he looked
[1:02:12] and says, "But I'm under the blood of
[1:02:14] the sacrifice. There's no way I can be
[1:02:17] condemned." Oh, when the devil comes
[1:02:19] against you and tries to condemn you.
[1:02:22] We're under the token. We're under the
[1:02:24] blood of Jesus Christ. There's no way
[1:02:27] you can ever be condemned.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Oh, my faith is the victory.
[1:02:32] Whenever we come against these things,
[1:02:35] hallelujah, brother Brandon, I'm going
[1:02:36] to say times may be hard. God has not
[1:02:39] promised a flowery bed of ease, but he's
[1:02:41] promised grace sufficient for every
[1:02:44] trial that can hit you. He says, "That's
[1:02:47] right. Indeed, grace is sufficient. Not
[1:02:50] a flowery bed of ease, but he's promised
[1:02:52] grace to overcome in every temptation."
[1:02:56] So there there's there's a grace. It's
[1:02:59] God relaying his confidence to you. And
[1:03:02] so it ain't but then it ain't just or
[1:03:04] God having trust in us. But we also have
[1:03:08] to have trust in him. It was David that
[1:03:10] would say though he slay me yet I will
[1:03:13] trust him. He would say if I if I ascend
[1:03:16] to the heights thou art there. If I make
[1:03:18] my bed in hell thou ware. It was a trust
[1:03:22] in God. And and what's incredible is
[1:03:24] brother Brandon would talk about a young
[1:03:27] couple that was praying for a baby that
[1:03:30] was sick. They were they were from
[1:03:31] Germany and and they were praying for
[1:03:34] this baby. And the baby would die and
[1:03:36] and they would call brother Brandon and
[1:03:38] would say, "Hey, can you come pray for
[1:03:40] the baby?" A and the doctor would was
[1:03:43] going to was going to make sure it was
[1:03:45] still at the hospital for brother
[1:03:47] Brandon to come and pray for it. But
[1:03:49] then the Lord would show him a vision
[1:03:51] and would tell him that this baby is
[1:03:54] going to die. It's not my will for it to
[1:03:57] come back to life. And then brother
[1:03:59] Brandon would tell the couple that and
[1:04:01] this was the question that this that
[1:04:03] that this mother would have is that
[1:04:05] because of the weakness of my faith. And
[1:04:09] ain't that incredible that when our
[1:04:11] prayers ain't answered the way we think
[1:04:13] they should be, the devil comes and
[1:04:15] condemns you. your your your your faith
[1:04:18] is too weak or God would have answered
[1:04:20] you. And brother Brandham says this,
[1:04:22] "No, you have great faith." He says,
[1:04:24] "And you still love him." That's real
[1:04:28] faith. He says, "Anybody when mountains
[1:04:31] are moving and things can have faith,
[1:04:33] but let it go backwards one time and see
[1:04:36] how it works." That's when you prove
[1:04:39] whether you've got faith or not.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So anybody can have faith when
[1:04:45] the mountains are moving. But what about
[1:04:48] when it's just grace?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, what about when it go when
[1:04:52] God ain't pulling you out, but he's
[1:04:54] given you grace to endure? Your faith
[1:04:57] still has to remain.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon would say
[1:05:02] this here. Excuse me. He would say, "So
[1:05:04] this morning, I say this, friends. After
[1:05:07] 31 years of ministry, 31 years of tolls
[1:05:10] on the field, I want to make this my
[1:05:12] testimony. I've seen disappointments.
[1:05:15] I've seen times I've asked for things,
[1:05:18] cried for things, begged for things, and
[1:05:20] fail to get them. But if I would just
[1:05:22] wait patiently upon God, then I know
[1:05:26] that a works just exactly right, comes
[1:05:29] out just exactly right, does exactly the
[1:05:33] right things. And so faith is patient.
[1:05:36] You remember whenever Daniel was praying
[1:05:38] for 21 days? Y'all remember that story?
[1:05:41] And God, well, brother uh uh Daniel
[1:05:43] thought God wasn't answering his prayer.
[1:05:46] But then after the 21st day, bear with
[1:05:49] me on my voice. I'm sorry. After the
[1:05:51] 21st day, the angel would come to Daniel
[1:05:54] and would say, "God heard you the first
[1:05:57] day, but I have been fighting through
[1:06:00] the prince of the power of the air." And
[1:06:02] what's incredible is what if Daniel
[1:06:05] would have given up on the 15th day.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; What if his faith was only mountain
[1:06:10] moving faith and not patient faith?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We need mountain moving
[1:06:16] faith, but we also need patient faith.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Because what would the Bible tell us?
[1:06:22] That then the angel will begin to talk
[1:06:24] to Daniel. And what would Daniel say? I
[1:06:27] was strengthened by the words of the
[1:06:30] angel. So since his faith was patient,
[1:06:34] when his answer came, it strengthened
[1:06:36] him.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you've got patient
[1:06:40] faith, when the answer comes, it can
[1:06:42] strengthen. It can guard you up. It can
[1:06:45] pick you up and say, even though you
[1:06:48] felt like I did not answer, your answer
[1:06:51] has been on the way. You just have to be
[1:06:54] patient.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Your answer might be on the way,
[1:06:59] but you just have to be patient.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; You see, that's trust.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; That's confidence in the things of God.
[1:07:07] Excuse me.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; You can look there at the uh the three
[1:07:16] Hebrew boys in Daniel 3:17.
[1:07:19] They were told to bow down before the
[1:07:21] image. We all know the story. And what's
[1:07:23] incredible is they will look to the king
[1:07:26] and will say our God is more than able
[1:07:29] to deliver us. But even if he don't, you
[1:07:33] see the faith was patient. Even if he
[1:07:36] don't, we would still not bow. And
[1:07:39] what's incredible as brother Brandon
[1:07:41] would tell us that God didn't come until
[1:07:44] they step into the fire.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Look how patient their faith was. Even
[1:07:50] if he don't deliver us, we still will
[1:07:53] not bow. And I believe that is the the
[1:07:56] the faith of the bride today. Even if he
[1:07:59] don't pull us out of the trial, I'm not
[1:08:02] giving up. Even if he don't do it, I'm
[1:08:05] not giving up. Even brother, I'm going
[1:08:07] say, even if there ain't if all of this
[1:08:09] is a hoax, I would still live this life.
[1:08:12] It's the best life we can ever live.
[1:08:15] Even even if there ain't a real heaven,
[1:08:18] this has been the best life that I have
[1:08:20] ever lived. Even if God don't deliver
[1:08:24] us, yet we are still trusting him. And
[1:08:27] then brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:08:29] real genuine love will create confidence
[1:08:33] in his word. That's why the apostle Paul
[1:08:36] would say, "Who shall separate us from
[1:08:38] the love of God? shall tribulation,
[1:08:41] shall persecution, peril, sword,
[1:08:43] nakedness, famine, anything present,
[1:08:46] anything future, anything the past,
[1:08:49] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:08:52] God or the actions of love. He had yet
[1:08:56] felt the expression of God's love, which
[1:09:00] produced a confidence that nothing
[1:09:03] present or things to come. In other
[1:09:06] words, that love is in my future.
[1:09:09] Hallelujah. God is not just the God of
[1:09:12] your past or the God of your present.
[1:09:14] He's already in your future. And he gave
[1:09:18] grace in your future to endure the
[1:09:22] hardships you go through.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish I could preach this
[1:09:26] morning. You might not know what
[1:09:28] tomorrow holds, but we know somebody who
[1:09:31] holds tomorrow.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's already in the future.
[1:09:37] That's why God told Moses at the Red
[1:09:39] Sea, "Why Christ speak? I've already
[1:09:42] been there." And that's why I know speak
[1:09:45] the word and that will split.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Before Moses was ever in the desert,
[1:09:52] there was a rock ready to bring forth
[1:09:54] water. Before there was ever in the
[1:09:57] wilderness, there was mana to be turned
[1:10:00] into food. God was already in their
[1:10:03] future. All they had to do was have
[1:10:06] patient faith that even when it's hard,
[1:10:09] grace has already been in my future. And
[1:10:13] we need some patient faith that God's
[1:10:16] already been in my tomorrow.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I might not know how the
[1:10:20] answer is going to come, but I know it's
[1:10:23] on the way.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Why cry speak? Go forward. There's a
[1:10:29] faith in the love of God. And God's love
[1:10:33] is personal. And you can look at
[1:10:35] Revelations 3:19. As many as I love.
[1:10:39] Brother Brandon would say the emphasis
[1:10:41] is on the eye. Not as many as loves me,
[1:10:44] but as many as I love. And that's what's
[1:10:47] incredible about the love of God.
[1:10:50] Brother Brandon would teach us there's
[1:10:52] two different loves, right? There's a
[1:10:54] filial love and agape love, right? He
[1:10:57] says filial love is human love. If a man
[1:11:00] does your wife wrong, he says you're
[1:11:02] going to go box his jaws in. Right? He
[1:11:04] says that's human love. But if helio
[1:11:07] love is if he does your wife wrong,
[1:11:09] you're going to pray for him. So that's
[1:11:12] the love of God. Human love is you do me
[1:11:15] right, I'll do you right. You do me
[1:11:17] wrong, I'll do you wrong. But God's love
[1:11:20] is when you was in sin, when you was in
[1:11:23] iniquity, I still loved you. As many as
[1:11:27] I love. It's an elective love that even
[1:11:30] when you backslide, the love of God is
[1:11:33] there.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Even when you make mistakes, the love of
[1:11:37] God is there. Even when you have
[1:11:40] failures, even when you fall flat on
[1:11:42] your face, the love of God is still
[1:11:45] there.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even when we fail and we we
[1:11:51] turn away from God, his love is still
[1:11:53] there. That's what I love about the love
[1:11:56] of God.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Is there's always time for the prodical
[1:11:59] son.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Come on now. There's always time for the
[1:12:03] prodal daughter. There's always time for
[1:12:06] that rebellious teenager. That's why you
[1:12:08] got to have patient faith.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Even if your daughter is wavered, have
[1:12:13] patient faith. Even when your son is
[1:12:15] weward, have patient faith. Because as
[1:12:18] many as I love, if he loved him before
[1:12:22] the foundation of the world, there's
[1:12:24] nothing that can separate him from the
[1:12:26] love of God. Oh, there's no addiction.
[1:12:30] There's no there's no attitudes. There's
[1:12:32] no rebellious spirit can separate a lost
[1:12:35] loved one from the love of God.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we need patient
[1:12:41] faith. Hallelujah. And his love is an
[1:12:44] everlasting love. You look at Jeremiah
[1:12:47] 31:3. The Lord hath appeared of old unto
[1:12:51] me, saying, "Yay, I have loved thee with
[1:12:53] an everlasting love. Therefore, with
[1:12:56] loving kindness I have drawn thee." I
[1:13:00] love that scripture. The Lord of old
[1:13:02] hath appeared unto me. In other words,
[1:13:05] the one that loved me from before the
[1:13:08] foundation of the world still loves me
[1:13:10] now
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; with an everlasting love. Then he says
[1:13:14] with my loving kindness I have drawn
[1:13:18] thee. What would Jesus say? No man can
[1:13:21] come unto me unless the father draws
[1:13:23] him. And so I have drawn them with my
[1:13:26] loving kindness. What would David say?
[1:13:28] Thy loving kindness is better than life.
[1:13:32] So if there's loving kindness drawing
[1:13:34] you is because you're an elected seed.
[1:13:37] And if there is a drawing there, you
[1:13:40] have not sent your day of grace away.
[1:13:43] You see, because there, brother Brandham
[1:13:45] would say, if you think you've seen the
[1:13:47] day of grace, you wouldn't be here,
[1:13:49] right? There wouldn't be a desire in
[1:13:51] your heart. That's the loving kindness
[1:13:54] of God that is drawing you. Even when
[1:13:57] you feel like you can't take another
[1:13:59] step, his loving kindness is still
[1:14:02] pulling you. It's tugging on your heart,
[1:14:05] saying, "You can't give up now. You
[1:14:07] can't give in now. My loving kindness is
[1:14:10] an everlasting love. It's drawing you.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's incredible because
[1:14:17] the love of God has made us a special
[1:14:20] people. You look at First Peter 2:9. But
[1:14:23] you are a chosen generation, a royal
[1:14:25] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[1:14:28] people, that you should show forth the
[1:14:31] praises of him who hath called you or
[1:14:34] hath tugged you, has pulled you out of
[1:14:37] darkness into his marvelous light, which
[1:14:41] in times past were not a people, but are
[1:14:44] now the people of God, which had not
[1:14:47] obtained mercy, but now have obtained
[1:14:51] mercy. His loving kindness brought you
[1:14:54] from a nobody to a somebody. Brought you
[1:14:58] from somebody bound for hell to bound
[1:15:01] for a rapture. What was it? We once were
[1:15:03] nobodies, but now we are the bride of
[1:15:07] Christ. It was an everlasting love that
[1:15:10] astrada with his loving kindness.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In times past had not mercy,
[1:15:17] but now obtained the mercy of God. In
[1:15:21] times past had no future, but now we've
[1:15:24] got a future. In times past had not
[1:15:27] grace, but now we've got the grace of
[1:15:30] God. His loving kindness has called us
[1:15:34] with an everlasting love. How can I not
[1:15:38] praise him? How can I not have
[1:15:40] confidence in his word? How can I not?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; He has an expression of love that he's
[1:15:48] given me. Hallelujah. If anybody's got a
[1:15:52] right to praise God, it's you.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; You felt this love in the dark times.
[1:15:58] You felt this love in the hard times.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; What would Jesus say? I'm the good
[1:16:04] shepherd. Brother Brandon would say
[1:16:05] there's a difference between a shepherd
[1:16:07] and a herdsman. Right? He would say a
[1:16:10] herdsman is with the sheep during the
[1:16:12] day, but at night he leaves the sheep
[1:16:15] and goes into his own house. But what
[1:16:18] would he say the shepherd does? The
[1:16:20] shepherd's with them during the day, but
[1:16:22] then at night, he becomes the door. What
[1:16:24] would Jesus say? I'm the door of the
[1:16:27] sheep. In other words, in the dark time,
[1:16:30] he is still with you.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; He's not a herdsman that leaves you in
[1:16:35] the valley of the shadow of death, but
[1:16:38] he's a shepherd, the good shepherd that
[1:16:41] becomes the door.
[1:16:44] That's why no weapon formed against you
[1:16:47] shall prosper because he's become the
[1:16:50] door
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; before he can get through to you. He's
[1:16:53] got to get through the door.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's remember the story in
[1:16:59] the Old Testament. There was an invading
[1:17:01] army. I can't remember the the kings or
[1:17:03] the nations, but it was an invading army
[1:17:05] that would come in and they were
[1:17:07] destroying all of the warriors. Destroy
[1:17:10] the army. And there was some some ladies
[1:17:12] that would run into a tower and it's
[1:17:14] incredible because they thought they
[1:17:16] were safe. They ran into a tower and
[1:17:19] that invading army would come and would
[1:17:21] destroy that tower, would kill them all.
[1:17:23] But then there was a certain woman, a
[1:17:26] little faith woman that would run into a
[1:17:28] strong tower. Not just a tower, but a
[1:17:32] strong tower. And the Bible says that
[1:17:34] the king would come up against the
[1:17:36] strong tower and would beat up against
[1:17:39] the door but couldn't break through the
[1:17:41] door. And you know what would happen?
[1:17:43] The Bible says that certain woman would
[1:17:45] get a piece of a millstone would look
[1:17:48] out of that tower and would drop it on
[1:17:51] that invading king's head and would
[1:17:54] destroy him. And the Bible says the name
[1:17:56] of the Lord is a strong tower. So, we're
[1:18:00] not just in a tower. We're in a strong
[1:18:03] tower. And the devil's beating out the
[1:18:05] door, but the good shepherd is the door.
[1:18:09] Hallelujah. You might not be able to
[1:18:11] quote all of the scriptures or all of
[1:18:14] the message, but take a piece of a
[1:18:17] millstone. Take a piece of the word of
[1:18:20] God or the message of the hour and look
[1:18:22] out of the strong tower and say, "Devil,
[1:18:25] this is the last time you're plaguing me
[1:18:28] today.
[1:18:31] Hallelujah. It's a certain woman, a
[1:18:33] faith woman, you see. And we're sitting
[1:18:36] in a strong tower in times past not a
[1:18:39] people. And what's incredible is brother
[1:18:41] Brandon would tell us that there's three
[1:18:43] kinds of nationalities of people, right?
[1:18:46] He says there, and it came back from
[1:18:47] Noah's sons, Ham, Sham, and Japheth. He
[1:18:50] says there's the Jews, the Samaritans,
[1:18:52] and the Gentiles. And he would tell us
[1:18:55] that the Messiah sign would be done to
[1:18:58] the Jews whenever Christ would discern
[1:19:01] Nathaniel. Right? Before when he was
[1:19:04] under the tree, I saw thee. Right? He
[1:19:05] says that was the Messiah sign to the
[1:19:07] Jews. Then that same sign would be given
[1:19:11] to the Samaritans at the woman at the
[1:19:13] well. Right? You know, call your
[1:19:15] husband. I don't got a husband. You you
[1:19:17] spoke the truth. He was deserting her
[1:19:19] life. Brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:19:22] the Gentiles were a heathen people. He
[1:19:24] says they weren't looking for the
[1:19:26] Messiah. And he says God only comes to
[1:19:28] those who are looking for him. And I
[1:19:31] thought my we were a heathen people.
[1:19:32] Gentiles wasn't even looking for the
[1:19:34] Messiah. In times past were not a
[1:19:37] people. But now we are the people of
[1:19:41] God. We've recognized the Messiah is
[1:19:44] upon the earth. And brother Brown would
[1:19:46] say this. you you put yourself into
[1:19:49] position by recognizing him, he says
[1:19:52] you're subject now to see greater
[1:19:55] things. So when you recognize the
[1:19:58] Messiah, you're subject now to see
[1:20:01] greater things. And it's incredible
[1:20:04] because after Philillip or after Christ
[1:20:06] would discern Nathaniel's heart, he
[1:20:09] would say, "You are the Christ. I'm
[1:20:10] going to follow you." And he says,
[1:20:12] "Because I discern your heart." He says,
[1:20:15] "But you shall see greater things." In
[1:20:18] other words, me revealing who you are
[1:20:21] was my loving kindness drawing you, but
[1:20:24] now you're subject to see greater
[1:20:26] things. And us recognizing the Messiah
[1:20:30] was God drawing us, but now we're
[1:20:32] subject to see greater things. We're
[1:20:35] birthed into a kingdom. And brother
[1:20:38] Brandon was saying, "What is the
[1:20:40] Messiah?" He says the Messiah is the
[1:20:42] kingdom of God anointed ones, the
[1:20:45] anointing them with the same spirit he
[1:20:49] was anointed with. And the So that
[1:20:51] that's incredible to me because brother
[1:20:53] Brandham would tell us in one place that
[1:20:55] when Christ died, he didn't die. He just
[1:20:58] birthed the kingdom. What is the
[1:21:00] kingdom? You are the kingdom. Where's
[1:21:03] the kingdom of heaven? It's living
[1:21:05] inside of people walking in fallen flesh
[1:21:09] that has mistakes that has failures,
[1:21:12] that has aches and pains, and you have
[1:21:14] bad days and good days, but yet this
[1:21:16] kingdom will never be diminished. That's
[1:21:20] what I love about the things of God is
[1:21:22] no matter what you go through, it does
[1:21:25] not shake the plan of God. No matter the
[1:21:28] bad days, it does not shake the plan of
[1:21:31] God. No matter the twists and turns you
[1:21:34] go through, the ups and the downs, it
[1:21:36] does not shake the kingdom of God. And
[1:21:40] what's so powerful is we've been
[1:21:42] translated from one kingdom to another.
[1:21:45] You can look there at at Colossians
[1:21:47] 1:13. Who hath delivered us from the
[1:21:51] power of darkness and has translated us
[1:21:54] into the kingdom of his dear son. So,
[1:21:57] we're walking among darkness, but we've
[1:22:00] been delivered from the power of it.
[1:22:02] Hallelujah. You're walking in the flesh,
[1:22:05] but you've been delivered from the power
[1:22:08] of it. You're walking in Leoia, but
[1:22:11] you've been delivered from the power of
[1:22:13] it. You're walking amongst anxiety and
[1:22:16] nervousness and high blood pressure, but
[1:22:18] you've been delivered from the power of
[1:22:20] it. We've been translated into the
[1:22:23] kingdom of the dear. is is he his dear
[1:22:26] son. And brother Brandham would tell us
[1:22:28] the word translated means to be moved
[1:22:31] from one position to another.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So we was in a position of being
[1:22:37] overcame, but now we're in another
[1:22:39] position of greater is he that is in
[1:22:42] you. We was in a position abound for
[1:22:46] hell. But now we're in another position
[1:22:49] abound for a rapture. You see, we've
[1:22:51] been delivered from one kingdom and
[1:22:54] moved to another kingdom.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what's so powerful is
[1:23:00] the Bible would tell us about John.
[1:23:02] Remember John was on the aisle of
[1:23:04] Patmas, right? And he was in the spirit
[1:23:06] on the Lord's day. Brother Brandon would
[1:23:08] say he would get into the spirit and
[1:23:10] would be transported or moved from one
[1:23:13] place to another. He was on the aisle of
[1:23:16] Patmas, but as he would begin to pray,
[1:23:18] he would get into the spirit and would
[1:23:20] be moved to the Lord's day. And what
[1:23:22] would he see while he was in the spirit?
[1:23:25] And what I think is so powerful is here
[1:23:28] that the the Bible would say that that
[1:23:30] he would hear a voice, I'm the alpha and
[1:23:32] the omega, the beginning and the end. He
[1:23:35] was going through all of these things,
[1:23:37] all these symbols, you know, he he would
[1:23:39] see a book that was bound and it was
[1:23:41] bound by seven seals. He would begin to
[1:23:44] cry because no man was worthy to loosen
[1:23:47] him the book, not even worthy to look
[1:23:48] upon the book. So he was crying and then
[1:23:51] he heard a voice behind him saying,
[1:23:53] "Weep not John, for the lion of the
[1:23:56] tribe of Judah has prevailed to loosen
[1:23:59] the seals and open the book." He would
[1:24:01] go from weeping to rejoicing. How come
[1:24:05] he saw his name upon the book, but where
[1:24:08] was his body at? Still on the aisle of
[1:24:11] Pat atmos. Come on.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now. His body was still being
[1:24:16] afflicted. His body was still being
[1:24:19] tormented. And he was still having mind
[1:24:21] battles. He was still chained up. But in
[1:24:24] the spirit, he was in the Lord's name.
[1:24:27] And he could see that even though my
[1:24:30] body is being tormented, I've been
[1:24:33] caught up into a strong tower and my
[1:24:36] name is written upon that book. Your
[1:24:40] body might be still going through mind
[1:24:42] battles and headaches and aches and
[1:24:44] pains, but you've been caught up into
[1:24:47] heavenly places and there's an open book
[1:24:51] that you can see your name there
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; and say, "Even though my body, even
[1:24:57] though my body is being tormented, I've
[1:24:59] got a right to rejoice."
[1:25:02] You might be going through the hardest
[1:25:04] trial of your life, but if you can get
[1:25:06] into the spirit this morning, you've got
[1:25:08] a right to rejoice.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; You know why? Brother Brandon Matt tell
[1:25:12] us a pulsation of faith. He says, "Let
[1:25:14] the pulsation begin to rise up and let
[1:25:18] it black out all of the things around
[1:25:21] you till you only see the promises of
[1:25:24] God."
[1:25:25] You see, that's what happens when you
[1:25:26] get into the spirit is the things around
[1:25:29] you begins to black out and all you can
[1:25:32] see is the promises of God.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could you imagine being
[1:25:38] John? You're there on the aisle of
[1:25:39] Patmas. You come out of the vision, but
[1:25:42] then you can remember I'm the beginning
[1:25:44] and the end, the alpha and the omega. In
[1:25:48] other words, before I was upon the aisle
[1:25:51] of Patmas, he was. And after I'm off the
[1:25:55] aisle of Patmas, he still will be. And
[1:25:58] he's the author and the finisher of my
[1:26:01] faith. So before my trial, he was
[1:26:04] already working on me. And after this
[1:26:07] trial, he's still going to be working on
[1:26:09] me. That's why you can't give up.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this earth is going
[1:26:15] to fade away. We It's already been
[1:26:17] prophesied. The earth's going to be
[1:26:19] bombed by Russia. But you're a you're
[1:26:21] born into another kingdom.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it will never be
[1:26:25] diminished. Jesus would say there shall
[1:26:28] be no end to this kingdom.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; So even though even though our flesh is
[1:26:34] beaten down, our spirit is of another
[1:26:36] kingdom. Our soul is of another kingdom.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah. And we can bring our body
[1:26:43] into subjection. You can look at Hebrews
[1:26:45] 12:28. Wherefore we re we receiving a
[1:26:48] kingdom which cannot be moved. Luke 1:33
[1:26:53] and of his kingdom there shall be no
[1:26:56] end. But the bread must say but the hour
[1:26:58] has come that every kingdom has to give
[1:27:01] away because there's a kingdom of God
[1:27:03] that's established.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Established not just placed in there but
[1:27:09] established. In other words, it's going
[1:27:12] to be there. He says, "Established in
[1:27:14] the human heart by the baptism of the
[1:27:17] Holy Ghost and the presence of Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ and Christ will come to his bride
[1:27:24] and will set up a kingdom here on the
[1:27:26] earth that will never be diminished." He
[1:27:29] says, "How do you get into this kingdom?
[1:27:31] You were born into. We're baptized into
[1:27:35] one body. My kingdom," Jesus would say,
[1:27:38] "My kingdom is not of this world." So
[1:27:40] even though we're walking in this world,
[1:27:42] we're born into another world. And
[1:27:45] that's why that's why brother Brandon
[1:27:47] must say this here. He says too many
[1:27:49] people is crying and whining, God, what
[1:27:52] do I do? What do I do? What do I do
[1:27:54] next? What's next? He says just speak
[1:27:57] and go forward. He says because if God
[1:28:00] has commissioned you to do something, he
[1:28:03] says speak and go forward. He says don't
[1:28:05] stand around and think about it. How
[1:28:07] could it happen? Well, this thing, well,
[1:28:09] this or that, that don't make any
[1:28:11] difference. If God said it, do it
[1:28:14] anyhow. And and catch this part of the
[1:28:16] quote. He says he is still the God of
[1:28:20] miracles.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, if he's commissioned you
[1:28:23] to do something, the supernatural is
[1:28:26] going to be there.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you can ever get that, as
[1:28:33] long as I'm upon the earth right now, as
[1:28:36] long as the kingdom is established in my
[1:28:39] heart, he is still the God of miracles.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you remember whenever
[1:28:45] God would tell Joshua, you know, there's
[1:28:47] not going to be one one man stand before
[1:28:50] you. You're going to be victorious. And
[1:28:51] as he was in the middle of the battle,
[1:28:54] the sun would start to go down. Y'all
[1:28:56] remember that story? And the Bible says
[1:28:58] that he he stopped and he spoke to the
[1:29:00] son. spoke to the moon. Brother Brandham
[1:29:03] says he didn't think about it. He didn't
[1:29:05] have to pray about it. He says he was
[1:29:07] tied to an absolute under a commission
[1:29:10] and would speak the word sun stand
[1:29:12] still, moon stand still. And what would
[1:29:14] the Bible say? The Bible says that the
[1:29:16] sun stood still until the people avenged
[1:29:20] themselves upon their enemy. In other
[1:29:23] words, as long as the enemy was alive,
[1:29:26] the supernatural was causing the sun to
[1:29:29] stand still. And as long as you're
[1:29:32] fighting an enemy, he is still the God
[1:29:35] of miracles. As long as you're going
[1:29:37] through trials, there is still grace
[1:29:40] sufficient enough to bring you through.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; He is still the God of miracles. And
[1:29:47] what I think is so powerful about the
[1:29:50] story of Joshua is the Bible says there
[1:29:52] was five kings, right? And Joshua put
[1:29:55] him into a cave and and there there was
[1:29:57] his some of his warriors was around him.
[1:29:59] And what would Joshua say? He would say,
[1:30:01] "Don't stay here." He says, "Go pursue
[1:30:04] after your enemies."
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And that really spoke to my heart,
[1:30:08] brother, because it's not just the
[1:30:10] pastor having victory. You have victory
[1:30:13] as well.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. The sun didn't just stand still
[1:30:17] for Joshua, but for his warriors as
[1:30:20] well. The sun ain't just standing still
[1:30:23] for the pastor, but it's for young
[1:30:25] people. Pursue after your enemies.
[1:30:28] Pursue after your joy. Pursue after your
[1:30:32] peace. Speak and go forward. He is still
[1:30:36] the God of miracles. He's still Jehovah
[1:30:38] Gyra. He's still Jehovah Shama. He's
[1:30:41] still the prince of peace. He's still
[1:30:43] the lily of the valley. He's still the
[1:30:45] bright and morning star.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of, he is still
[1:30:50] the God of miracles.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Have faith in the word of God.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel good this morning.
[1:31:00] We're not subject to this five senses.
[1:31:03] We're not subject to our flesh. There's
[1:31:05] another kingdom that we've been birthed
[1:31:07] into.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Brandham says, "Use your
[1:31:11] use our armor." We've got armor. God
[1:31:13] works with us. Gives us the armor. And
[1:31:15] the armor is is all supernatural. See,
[1:31:18] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:31:21] goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience
[1:31:23] is all in the supernatural. And if you
[1:31:26] let your faith loose to God's spirit, it
[1:31:29] brings your body into subjection to
[1:31:32] God's redemptive blessings to you. So if
[1:31:36] you let your faith loose to the spirit
[1:31:39] of God this morning, it brings your five
[1:31:42] senses into subjection to all the
[1:31:44] blessings of God.
[1:31:47] Hallelujah. But Brown, I'm going to say
[1:31:48] one to in one place. He says there'll be
[1:31:50] a smile that comes on your face. He says
[1:31:53] your muscles uh your your your muscles
[1:31:56] will will begin to act right. He says
[1:31:57] your your your your your eyes begin to
[1:32:00] begin to brighten up. He says what is
[1:32:02] it? Your body is brought into
[1:32:04] subjection. And I love that quote
[1:32:06] because even if you have a frown on your
[1:32:09] face because you've been going through
[1:32:10] hard times, get into the spirit one
[1:32:13] time.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Get into the spirit. Get into that
[1:32:17] strong tower. Let it become your door.
[1:32:19] Then your muscles get brought into
[1:32:22] subjection where you can't help but
[1:32:24] raise your hands. Even if it is a bad
[1:32:26] day, you can't help but praise the Lord
[1:32:29] because this pride has been brought into
[1:32:31] subjection to the blessings of God.
[1:32:34] Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You can't help but worship the Lord.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; God, you're so good to me. You can't
[1:32:40] help but thank him for the breath that's
[1:32:42] in your lungs. You can't help but thank
[1:32:44] him for the wonderful family that he's
[1:32:47] given you. You can't help but thank him
[1:32:49] for this wonderful church that he's
[1:32:51] given you. You can't help but thank him
[1:32:53] for the message of the hour that he's
[1:32:56] given you. Your body has been brought
[1:32:58] into subjection to another kingdom.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; We're not subject to it. We're subject
[1:33:04] to another kingdom.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] Speak and go forward. Hope this is okay
[1:33:12] this morning. He is still the God of
[1:33:14] miracles. And you can look there at you
[1:33:17] can look at David after he came back. He
[1:33:20] would come back from a battle. He would
[1:33:22] come back to Ziglag and and you if you
[1:33:24] look at it, his his family was taken
[1:33:27] away. His warriors was taken away. And
[1:33:30] and it's incredible because or his
[1:33:32] warriors turned against him and and the
[1:33:34] the Bible says his warriors took up
[1:33:36] stones to stone him. And the Bible would
[1:33:39] tell us that David was greatly
[1:33:41] distressed.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; You know, but then it turns around and
[1:33:45] says, "But David encouraged himself in
[1:33:48] the Lord.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; There was a battle going on his flesh
[1:33:51] and his soul. His soul was distressed.
[1:33:55] His mind was distressed. But that soul
[1:33:57] would begin to encourage him. And I
[1:34:00] thought that is the greatest battle ever
[1:34:01] fought is right in the mind. Your mind
[1:34:04] says give up. Give up. Lay down on the
[1:34:06] feet. You can't overcome. You can't get
[1:34:08] your children back. But then that soul
[1:34:11] begins to speak a heavenly language. But
[1:34:13] you can do it. You see, you got to quit
[1:34:16] letting your mind speak and let that
[1:34:18] soul speak. Let it encourage yourself
[1:34:22] when you can't take another step. Let
[1:34:24] that soul speak. Let it speak a heavenly
[1:34:27] language. The faith is the victory. Even
[1:34:30] if I don't understand, I still believe
[1:34:32] it. If I don't know how it's going to
[1:34:35] happen, I still believe it. Let that
[1:34:37] soul encourage herself. It's the soul
[1:34:41] that is that is sealed to the day of the
[1:34:43] redemption. Let that soul speak.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And what would that soul that that soul
[1:34:49] tell him? It would encourage himself.
[1:34:51] And then the Lord would speak to him and
[1:34:53] would say, "Pursue,
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; for you shall surely overtake and
[1:34:58] recover them all." You know what's
[1:34:59] incredible to me is the Bible would tell
[1:35:02] us that the it was the Malach
[1:35:03] Amalachites, I believe, that would that
[1:35:05] would take his wives and the children
[1:35:07] and all and the families, but the Bible
[1:35:10] says they only took them, they did not
[1:35:12] kill them. And I thought, my goodness,
[1:35:15] brother Matt, the devil can take your
[1:35:17] joy, but he can't destroy it. He can
[1:35:19] take your peace, but he can't destroy
[1:35:22] it. He may take your revival, but he
[1:35:24] can't destroy it. Once you let that soul
[1:35:27] encourage yourself, then you can pursue.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Whatever the devil takes away from you,
[1:35:34] he has no right to destroy him. He's
[1:35:37] only a thief. He cannot destroy him. I
[1:35:40] say a little church, it's time to
[1:35:42] pursue. Pursue after your revival.
[1:35:45] Pursue after your children. Pursue after
[1:35:48] your happiness, pursue after your joy.
[1:35:52] Hallelujah. You want a praise on your
[1:35:54] lips, pursue. You want to dance in the
[1:35:57] spirit, pursue. You want a revival like
[1:36:00] never before, pursue. Let that soul
[1:36:04] speak.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Quit letting your mind speak negativity.
[1:36:08] Come on now. We speak negative about
[1:36:10] this and about that. Let the positive
[1:36:12] things of God speak out of your soul and
[1:36:17] say, "I might not understand, but I
[1:36:19] believe it." You know, brother Brandon,
[1:36:21] that's a quote. But the Brandon would
[1:36:23] talk about the the disciples whenever
[1:36:25] Jesus would say, "Eat my flesh, drink my
[1:36:27] blood." The 70 turned away from him. And
[1:36:30] then Jesus looked to the disciples and
[1:36:32] would say, "Will you leave me also?"
[1:36:34] What would Peter say? Where would we go?
[1:36:36] For thou hast the words of eternal life.
[1:36:39] Brother Brandham says they didn't
[1:36:40] understand what he meant, but they
[1:36:43] believed it. We not We might not
[1:36:46] understand how a rapture is going to
[1:36:48] happen, but we believe it. We might not
[1:36:51] understand how your lost loved ones are
[1:36:53] going to come back home, but we believe
[1:36:55] it. Come on, somebody. You might not
[1:36:58] understand what the marriage supper of
[1:37:00] the lamb is going to feel like, but we
[1:37:03] believe it.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Might not understand, brother. the
[1:37:08] brand. I'm going say a cold sweep going
[1:37:10] to come through your body. You might not
[1:37:12] understand it,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; but I sure enough believe it.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; One morning between 6:00 and 9. I might
[1:37:17] not understand it, but I believe it. I
[1:37:20] might not understand all of the seals
[1:37:22] and the mysteries, but I believe it. If
[1:37:25] that prophet said it, I believe it. If
[1:37:27] God spoke to me and says I can make a
[1:37:30] rapture, I believe it.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. If God spoke to you, buddy, and
[1:37:34] says you can have the Holy Ghost,
[1:37:36] believe it. You see, don't let thy mind
[1:37:38] speak, let that soul speak.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; I believe it. We've been given the keys
[1:37:44] to the kingdom of another dimension.
[1:37:46] Because you can look there, they're
[1:37:48] they're in Matthew 16. The Christ would
[1:37:50] ask the disciples, "Who do you say that
[1:37:52] I am?" Some say this, some say that,
[1:37:54] some say this. Peter would say, "Thou
[1:37:56] art the Christ, the son of the living
[1:37:58] God." Jesus would say, "Thou art, you
[1:37:59] know, Simon Bar Jonah." Then he would go
[1:38:01] through all of these things, but now
[1:38:02] you're Peter and I say, "Upon this rock
[1:38:05] I'll build my church." And then he says,
[1:38:07] I will give you the keys of the kingdom.
[1:38:10] Whatever you loose upon the earth will
[1:38:12] be loosed in heaven. Whatever you bind
[1:38:15] will be bound. And then brother Brown
[1:38:17] say this here. And any church that's
[1:38:19] anointed with the same Holy Spirit is
[1:38:22] the Messiah and a little smaller God.
[1:38:25] And someday when this body is
[1:38:27] resurrected, he says, "I hope beforehand
[1:38:30] that God can get a hold of a bunch of
[1:38:33] people that are manifest
[1:38:35] in every dimension." You've been given
[1:38:39] the keys to the kingdom. Not just upon
[1:38:42] the earth, but what you loose on earth
[1:38:44] will be loosed in heaven. You've been
[1:38:46] given keys of the supernatural.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother teaches say there's many
[1:38:52] dimensions, right? He says there's
[1:38:54] dimensions where demons live, dimensions
[1:38:56] where where television is, dimensions
[1:38:57] where angels are. But you've been given
[1:39:00] the keys in every dimension. You know
[1:39:03] what that means? The dimension of social
[1:39:05] media, you've got the keys to. Come on
[1:39:08] now. The dimension of movies and
[1:39:11] pornography. You've been given the keys
[1:39:13] to. The dimension of mind battles of
[1:39:16] demonic spirits that come against your
[1:39:18] mind, you've been given the keys to. And
[1:39:21] I say it's time we look at that devil
[1:39:24] square in the face and say I'm bringing
[1:39:26] my body into subjection. Get out of my
[1:39:29] way. Whatever the lies of the enemy that
[1:39:32] comes against you, let the soul speak.
[1:39:35] You've got the keys
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; in every dimension.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:41] Every dimension. Because many times we
[1:39:44] think, "Oh man, we think we're so big
[1:39:46] and bad that we want to put this one in
[1:39:48] in their place. We want to put that one
[1:39:50] in their place."
[1:39:51] I'm going to tell my brother this. I'm
[1:39:52] going to tell my sister that. But what
[1:39:54] about in another dimension? Come on now,
[1:39:57] brother. And remember when brother
[1:39:58] Brandham was in a we would go into the
[1:40:01] vision about the the mamba, right? And
[1:40:03] how the the the Lord would tell him,
[1:40:05] you've got power to loosen, power to
[1:40:07] bind him. And the Bible says he would
[1:40:09] wake her he would say and the story he
[1:40:11] would tell he would wake up. And then
[1:40:13] there was a demon in the corner, right,
[1:40:15] that was saying, "You're bluff. You've
[1:40:17] got no power over me. You can't you
[1:40:19] can't control me. Why would Brother
[1:40:21] Brandham say? He says, "You are an
[1:40:23] offense to me."
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness. He's showing us how to
[1:40:27] fight because we get offended at
[1:40:29] everybody else except for the devil.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We get offended at our
[1:40:34] brethren, offended at the deacon,
[1:40:36] offended at the pastor. But what about
[1:40:38] getting offended at the devil? It was
[1:40:41] Jesus that will look to Peter and will
[1:40:43] say, "Get behind me, Satan. Thou art an
[1:40:45] offense, not Peter, but in the other
[1:40:48] dimension.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Come on now. It's a spiritual warfare.
[1:40:53] It's not a natural warfare, but we're
[1:40:55] fighting in another dimension. But we've
[1:40:58] got the keys. I say it's time we get
[1:41:01] offended at backbiting. We get offended
[1:41:04] at all of those gossip spirits and say,
[1:41:06] "Satan, you are an offense to me. I've
[1:41:10] been given the keys
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; in this other dimension." Yes, sir.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Thou art an offense to me.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; I love it because the devil didn't
[1:41:20] realize that not only Peter had the keys
[1:41:23] to the kingdom, but brother Brandham did
[1:41:25] too.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine how dumb the devil is
[1:41:28] coming up against a prophet?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Like, come on. How stupid is he? Sorry,
[1:41:33] children. How how crazy is he? He has
[1:41:37] came out of a vision. The devil's been
[1:41:40] whooped in prayer line after prayer line
[1:41:42] after prayer line. But now he's going to
[1:41:44] come up against brother Brandon and say,
[1:41:46] "You're a bluff. You've got no power."
[1:41:49] But he's smarter than you think. Come
[1:41:51] on, brother Brandon. I'm going tell us
[1:41:52] in perfect faith that in order to have
[1:41:55] perfect faith, you have to know who you
[1:41:57] are and have no condemnation. So the
[1:42:00] devil knew if he could condemn brother
[1:42:02] Brandham, he would have no power over
[1:42:05] him. That's why the devil comes and
[1:42:08] tries to condemn you. You're a bluff.
[1:42:10] You're a nobody. You're this. You're
[1:42:11] that. He's trying to condemn you.
[1:42:14] Because if he can condemn you, you don't
[1:42:16] have perfect faith. Brother Brandham was
[1:42:18] showing us you're an offense. He would
[1:42:20] say, "Get out of here, Satan." And what
[1:42:22] would happen then? He would say, "I
[1:42:24] heard the sweetest voice I had ever
[1:42:26] heard before. Sweeter than any mother's
[1:42:28] voice, saying, "Don't fear to go
[1:42:30] anywhere to do anything, for the
[1:42:33] neverfailing presence of Jesus Christ
[1:42:36] will be with you wherever thou goest."
[1:42:39] And I thought it was after the battle,
[1:42:42] after he let that soul speak, that the
[1:42:44] presence of God would come and comfort
[1:42:46] him. I would say, "Don't fear to go
[1:42:49] anywhere." That's what happens when you
[1:42:51] let that soul speak. Let the presence of
[1:42:54] God come and comfort you. Don't fear to
[1:42:56] go anywhere. At the workplace, you still
[1:42:59] got the keys. At home, you still got the
[1:43:02] keys. At the job site, or rather in
[1:43:04] school, you still got the keys. And the
[1:43:07] ever the neverfelling presence of Jesus
[1:43:10] Christ is with you wherever thou goest.
[1:43:14] Can you imagine hearing those words
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; after you just fall? And that's a scary
[1:43:20] looking creature that is coming up
[1:43:22] against you. You know, I've I I've had
[1:43:24] an experience of seeing a spirit before.
[1:43:27] Brother Brandham would live in that
[1:43:28] other dimension. Brother Brandon would
[1:43:30] tell us he would have to pinch himself,
[1:43:31] right, to see if he was in a vision or
[1:43:33] not. And could you imagine that that
[1:43:35] that the spirit was so real? And it was
[1:43:37] real coming up against him. But after
[1:43:39] the victory, hearing that voice and my
[1:43:43] church, after the victory, could you
[1:43:45] imagine when we fight the last mind
[1:43:46] battle, what it's going to be like when
[1:43:49] we step on the other side
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; and the hands that held your hands, you
[1:43:54] can feel them.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; The voice that spoke to you in the hard
[1:43:58] times saying, "I'll never leave you,
[1:43:59] never forsake you." You can see it.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; The one that would come and wrap his his
[1:44:04] arms around you, you can feel those
[1:44:06] arms. That's what it's going to be like,
[1:44:08] friends, after we fight the last mind
[1:44:11] battle. And we can see the one. We can
[1:44:13] see the one that carried us in the hard
[1:44:16] times.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; He's never left you. He's never forsaken
[1:44:19] you. You remember the preacher that was
[1:44:22] that felt like God left him? The
[1:44:23] footprints on the sand of time. You
[1:44:25] remember that? And he was speaking to
[1:44:27] God, why did you leave me? And he says,
[1:44:29] what are you talking about? Look,
[1:44:30] there's two sets of footprints right
[1:44:32] there. And whenever I got to the hardest
[1:44:34] trial, you left me there. God says, "I
[1:44:36] didn't leave you. That's where I picked
[1:44:38] you up and carried you." But could you
[1:44:40] imagine being that man when he went on
[1:44:43] the other side, he could see the one
[1:44:45] that picked him up.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; The one that carried him. When his legs
[1:44:49] couldn't take another step, the one that
[1:44:51] carried him, he could now see.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what it's going to be like,
[1:44:56] friends. When you gave up on God and God
[1:44:58] never gave up on you, and you can see
[1:45:00] that one. When you felt like nobody
[1:45:03] loved you, but he still loved you. And
[1:45:05] you can see that one. The one when
[1:45:08] nobody when everybody forsaken you and
[1:45:10] gave you no grace, but his grace was
[1:45:12] still there. And you can see that one.
[1:45:15] Oh my. This is the quietest place you're
[1:45:17] ever going to be. Because when I see the
[1:45:20] one that held my hand, there's going to
[1:45:22] be a rejoicing. There's going to be a
[1:45:25] shouting. There's going to be a praise.
[1:45:27] When I see the one that loved me, when I
[1:45:30] was unlovable, I'm going to worship him.
[1:45:35] When you see the one that gave mercy to
[1:45:38] you, when you were in times past, not a
[1:45:40] people, but made you his people. When
[1:45:43] you see that one,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; that's why you can't give up now,
[1:45:48] church.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; You can't let go of your faith. Now, let
[1:45:51] a musicians come.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; You can't give up on God now.
[1:45:57] He's never given up on you.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; You got to keep on walking.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Keep on walking.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Keep on walking.
[1:46:07] Don't cry. Speak. Let that soul speak.
[1:46:12] Let that soul speak. Let that soul
[1:46:14] encourage you.
[1:46:16] When you're going through the valley of
[1:46:18] the shadow of death, remember, thou art
[1:46:21] with me.
[1:46:23] It was Job that was sitting there and
[1:46:25] would say, "But he knoweth the way that
[1:46:27] I take." And when he hath tried me, I
[1:46:30] shall come forth as gold. Precious gold.
[1:46:35] He knoweth the way. Job was heading
[1:46:37] there. He didn't know what was going on.
[1:46:39] His wife would say, "Curse God and die."
[1:46:42] His friends said he was a secret sinner.
[1:46:44] Family taken away. Livestock taken away.
[1:46:47] But yet he still had his confidence. He
[1:46:50] knoweth the way that I take. You may be
[1:46:53] there this morning.
[1:46:56] You might be there. And what's
[1:46:57] incredible about the story of Job is
[1:47:00] brother Brandham had hope this is okay.
[1:47:02] Brother Brandham would tell us that that
[1:47:05] Job was a man of inspiration and that
[1:47:07] everybody would come to Job when they
[1:47:09] wanted the word from the Lord because
[1:47:11] the Lord would speak to him. But then
[1:47:13] brother Brown would say these words that
[1:47:15] that really stuck with me because
[1:47:17] parents can relate. pastor, singers,
[1:47:19] whatever the the the those who work for
[1:47:22] the Lord. Brother Brandon must say these
[1:47:23] words that he stood for everybody else,
[1:47:27] but now who could stand for him?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; There's Job sitting there. He He
[1:47:32] intervened for everybody else. He
[1:47:34] intervene to get an answer for that one.
[1:47:36] He intervened to get an answer for this
[1:47:38] one. But now, who's going to intervene
[1:47:40] for him? And I thought, my sometimes we
[1:47:43] give that way as parents, don't we?
[1:47:46] You're the one that's that's taking care
[1:47:47] of your children. You're the one that's
[1:47:49] cooking the supper or what while doing
[1:47:51] the laundry. But what who's there to
[1:47:53] serve you whenever you're whenever
[1:47:55] you're needing some encouragement? The
[1:47:58] same one that would speak to Job
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; is speaking this morning
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible would tell us that there'd
[1:48:05] be thunders that would begin to thunder.
[1:48:08] And it's so powerful because everybody
[1:48:11] else heard thunders but not Job. Job
[1:48:14] heard a voice and that voice would begin
[1:48:18] to answer every one of Job's questions.
[1:48:21] Ain't that incredible? Because if you
[1:48:23] look at the beginning of Job's asking,
[1:48:25] you know, he he talks about the botney
[1:48:27] life. He talks about the plant life.
[1:48:29] They die. Then the then the then the
[1:48:31] springtime comes, they live again. Then
[1:48:33] he asks the question, if a man die,
[1:48:36] shall he live again? But then what would
[1:48:38] that answer say? What? What would that
[1:48:41] thunder say to you?
[1:48:43] In your flesh, you're going to see the
[1:48:45] redeemer.
[1:48:47] So when nobody was there to intercede
[1:48:49] for him, no man, God would come
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; and would give answers to the questions.
[1:48:55] And oh my, maybe you feel like there's
[1:48:57] nobody to intercede for you. He is still
[1:49:00] a high priest that can be touched by the
[1:49:02] feelings of your infirmities. Brother
[1:49:05] Brandma say he was tempted in all men.
[1:49:07] The Bible would tell us that. But then,
[1:49:08] Brother Brand, I'm going to tell us, he
[1:49:10] was tempted with women. He was tempted
[1:49:12] to have a family. He wanted to have a
[1:49:14] family. He was tempted in every like
[1:49:16] manner like you are, yet without sin.
[1:49:20] That's why he's a high priest that can
[1:49:22] be felt because he knows what it's like.
[1:49:26] You see, you don't want a pastor that's
[1:49:27] never been through anything, right?
[1:49:29] Like, how can he he can give ad he he
[1:49:32] can he can counsel with you through the
[1:49:34] experiences he's been through, right?
[1:49:37] And he and God can counsel with you,
[1:49:39] encourage with you because he's been
[1:49:42] through the things you've been through
[1:49:44] yet without sin, unbelief. He's still
[1:49:47] kept his faith. I say this morning, he's
[1:49:50] here to encourage.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; He's here to strengthen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; He's here to uplift the head, wipe away
[1:49:57] every tear.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; He's here to say, "When everybody left
[1:50:01] you, I was still there."
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads this
[1:50:05] morning.
[1:50:07] Maybe there's some this morning that
[1:50:10] would want to say, "Brother Josh,
[1:50:12] remember me.
[1:50:14] I'm at that place this morning." God
[1:50:16] bless the hands. I'm at that place this
[1:50:19] morning. Who can intercede for me?
[1:50:24] I'm busy working for the Lord. I'm busy
[1:50:26] working for my family. I'm trying to
[1:50:29] provide so that the bills are paid, that
[1:50:31] there's food on the table.
[1:50:34] But who can intercede for me? The same
[1:50:37] God that would speak to Job is here to
[1:50:40] intercede.
[1:50:42] Dear heavenly father, you see the hands
[1:50:45] that are all over the building, Lord.
[1:50:49] Lord, sometimes we feel like you've left
[1:50:52] us. You've forsaken us.
[1:50:56] But Lord, that's the mind speaking.
[1:50:58] You're the good shepherd.
[1:51:01] And Lord, I ask that you would speak to
[1:51:03] your children this morning.
[1:51:05] Lord, wrap them with the your warmth and
[1:51:08] praise.
[1:51:10] Lord, may there be grace sufficient,
[1:51:15] Lord. Just like the Apostle Paul said,
[1:51:17] "There's a thorn in my flesh." But once
[1:51:20] he found your grace, he would say, "But
[1:51:22] I glory in my infirmities,
[1:51:25] Lord. May there be a praise upon the
[1:51:27] lips of your people because they found a
[1:51:29] grace, a strength, just like Daniel that
[1:51:33] would patiently endure for 21 days. But
[1:51:37] when the answer came, it strengthened.
[1:51:40] Lord, I ask that you would strengthen
[1:51:42] your people this morning.
[1:51:45] God, I ask that you would uplift the
[1:51:48] lift up the heavy heads and hands. Lord,
[1:51:52] may the weak say, "I am strong.
[1:51:55] Lord, thank you for your presence that
[1:51:57] we feel this morning
[1:51:59] in Jesus name.
[1:52:01] Amen. Few more. I surrender.
[1:52:08] The more that I surrender,
[1:52:13] the lighter
[1:52:14] my Lord. Can we stand and sing it this
[1:52:17] morning?
[1:52:20] Release my cares.
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:30] can humble myself.
[1:52:34] He lifts me up
[1:52:38] every day I live.
[1:52:41] Lord, I love you more. Can we sing it
[1:52:44] again as we turn up to our pastor?
[1:52:49] The more that I surrender,
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:56] you're my Lord.
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:10] more that I can humble myself,
[1:53:14] the more you lift me up.
[1:53:18] Every day I live.
[1:53:22] Lord, I love you more.
[1:53:28] Oh, it gets easier
[1:53:32] to understand this road. I'm traveling
[1:53:37] down.
[1:53:39] No more way.
[1:53:42] Oh, wondering.
[1:53:44] I'm standing on solid ground.
[1:53:48] And I know I'm headed to my future home.
[1:53:54] And the voice I hear is yours alone.
[1:53:58] Every day I live.
[1:54:01] Lord, I love you more.
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:08] The more that I surrender,
[1:54:13] the lighter
[1:54:16] my Lord.
[1:54:18] The more that I release my car, the more
[1:54:24] you take control.
[1:54:28] The more that I can humble myself,
[1:54:33] the more you lift me up
[1:54:37] every day I live.
[1:54:41] Lord, I love you more.
[1:54:45] Can you sing this verse with me? Well,
[1:54:48] the problems I had on yesterday,
[1:54:52] they're my stepping stones
[1:54:55] to a higher place. And the trials that
[1:54:58] seem so awesome to me are now just a
[1:55:03] pattern to my next victory.
[1:55:07] I know I'm heading to my future home.
[1:55:12] And the voice I hear is yours alone.
[1:55:16] Every day I live. Yes, Lord. I love you
[1:55:22] more.
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:26] Well, the more that I surrender,
[1:55:31] the lighter
[1:55:33] my Lord.
[1:55:36] The more that I release my car, the more
[1:55:42] you take control.
[1:55:46] The more that I can humble myself,
[1:55:50] the more you pick me up.
[1:55:54] Every day I live.
[1:55:58] Lord, I love you more.
[1:56:15] The more that I
[1:56:17] release my case, the more that
[1:56:21] you take control.
[1:56:24] Yes. The more
[1:56:26] that I humble myself, the more you pick
[1:56:31] me up,
[1:56:33] every day that I live.
[1:56:37] Lord, I love every day that I live.
[1:56:41] Lord, I love you more.
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:49] Amen. Isn't he wonderful this morning?
[1:56:52] Amen. How many appreciate that message?
[1:56:54] Amen.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that Wasn't that a blessing?
[1:56:57] Amen. That God used our brother. I know
[1:57:00] he spoke to my heart and I know many
[1:57:03] testify. How many raise your hands? Say,
[1:57:04] "Brother Josh, the Lord used you this
[1:57:06] morning." Every everybody in the
[1:57:09] building. Amen. And how many'd like to
[1:57:10] have Brother Josh come back and preach
[1:57:12] for us again? Amen. Just a tremendous
[1:57:17] Amen.
[1:57:18] Tremendous.
[1:57:20] Tremendous message, my man. When I grow
[1:57:22] up, I want to preach like that. It's
[1:57:25] tremendous. Amen. God would you, man. He
[1:57:29] said, "God's love is not a parental
[1:57:30] love." Wasn't that powerful? A parental
[1:57:33] love wouldn't let a kid get into the
[1:57:35] fire. And if he got in it, you'd jerk
[1:57:37] him out of it. A parental love wouldn't
[1:57:39] let a kid go into a trial like that. You
[1:57:42] wouldn't let your kid get in a den full
[1:57:44] of lions. A parental love, you'd jerk
[1:57:46] him out of it. He said, "But God's love
[1:57:48] isn't a parental love. and a godly love.
[1:57:50] He don't keep you from the trial. He
[1:57:52] keeps you through the trial. I like
[1:57:54] that's just powerful. I don't know about
[1:57:55] y'all, but that's shouting material. You
[1:57:57] that lets you know when you go through a
[1:57:59] trial that you're you can be uh patient
[1:58:01] in the faith that you have towards God.
[1:58:03] Amen. And I just think that's
[1:58:06] tremendous. And now what a blessing this
[1:58:08] morning. And Amen. We just thank God for
[1:58:11] all that he does for us. And Amen. We uh
[1:58:15] have a a dinner uh this afternoon. And
[1:58:18] so we want to invite anybody to be able
[1:58:19] to come and enjoy the dinner. We'll have
[1:58:22] in a moment. Our visitors, may God bless
[1:58:24] you, our visitors this morning. You're
[1:58:26] welcome to come and fellowship with us
[1:58:28] and and enjoy the dinner with us. And

[1:58:32] morning. Amen. Can we sing that song?

[2:00:20] and the honor.

[2:00:28] magnify your name. You deserve the glory
[2:00:34] and the honor. Oh Lord, I lift my hands
[2:00:40] to worship, to magnify your name. You

[2:02:04] is no one else like you.
[2:02:09] There is no one else.
[2:02:15] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[2:02:16] clap of praise this morning?
[2:02:19] Amen. We sing that song. I've got a
[2:02:21] feeling everything's going to be all
[2:02:22] right. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:43] They just got engaged and just asking
[2:02:45] for prayer that the Lord be with them
[2:02:47] and guide them. I think it's a good way
[2:02:48] to start.

[2:03:46] Lord, we love you. We thank you for
[2:03:47] speaking to our hearts. Thank you for
[2:03:49] the many blessings that you poured out
[2:03:50] our lives, Lord, in the ministry that
[2:03:52] you've given us. Lord, we thank you for
[2:03:54] your spirit, Lord, and everything you do
[2:03:56] for us. Pray you keep your hands upon us
[2:03:57] as we go, Lord, and bring us back in
[2:03:59] your presence Wednesday. We bless the
[2:04:01] hands prepared our food, Lord. And
[2:04:04] please watch over us, Lord, our
[2:04:05] fellowship. Bring us, Lord, back to you.
[2:04:07] We love you. We thank you for everything
[2:04:09] you do in Jesus name.
[2:04:14] Well, I
[2:04:16] got a feeling
[2:04:18] everything's going to be all right.
[2:04:22] Oh, I
[2:04:25] I've got a feeling
[2:04:27] everything's going to be all right.
[2:04:31] Oh, I
[2:04:34] got a feeling
[2:04:37] everything's going to be all right.
[2:04:40] Be all right.

[2:04:45] Be all right.
[2:04:50] Well, a little boy named David went out
[2:04:53] to find a child. And everybody laughed
[2:04:57] at such a puny little side. A little
[2:05:00] shepherd boy on me with a sling. And
[2:05:04] beside mighty Goliath seemed such a puny
[2:05:07] little thing. But David said, "You come
[2:05:10] to me with spear and a sword, but I come
[2:05:14] to you in the name of the Lord." He put
[2:05:19] in a stone. He gave it a sling. And when
[2:05:23] he left his hand, then he began to sing.
[2:05:28] I
[2:05:29] got a feeling
[2:05:32] everything's going to be all right.
[2:05:36] Oh, I've
[2:05:38] got a feeling
[2:05:41] everything going to be all right.
[2:05:45] Oh, I
[2:05:48] got a feeling
[2:05:50] everything going to be all right.
[2:05:54] Be all around.
[2:05:56] Be all right.
[2:05:59] Be all right.
[2:06:03] Well, I say that I
[2:06:06] got a feeling
[2:06:08] [Music]
