[38:53] How great thou are.
[38:58] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[39:00] clap of praise tonight? How many says
[39:02] he's a great God and he's worthy of our
[39:05] praise? And I just think it's wonderful
[39:08] to think about all that God has done for
[39:11] us tonight. You know, I love I sure love
[39:13] that song. And I had that song on my
[39:16] heart and thought we'd come up and sing
[39:18] that. He has a lot of songs he could
[39:20] sing and but he he sang the right one. I
[39:22] thought, my it's just tremendous.
[39:24] There's since that song was written, it
[39:27] was written as a as a poem all the way
[39:29] back in the 1800s. And there was a a
[39:32] missionary in Poland that was preaching
[39:34] on John 3 in a village and got rained
[39:37] out and stormed out and couldn't get
[39:39] back home. and they let him sleep in
[39:41] their house. And he got up that next day
[39:43] overlooking them mountains and got to
[39:44] writing about the lofty mountain grander
[39:47] and how wonderful God was and took the
[39:49] very message that he was preaching and
[39:51] put it into words. And but friends, it
[39:53] wasn't just for him. It's still the same
[39:54] thing for us today. I can walk outside
[39:57] in a few moments. It don't matter if
[39:58] it's sunshining or if it's raining, if
[40:00] it's a cloudy day or a a good day or a
[40:03] bad day. One thing is for certain, our
[40:04] God is a great God. And I can say that
[40:07] without with with resolve and uh without
[40:10] holding anything back that our God is a
[40:12] great God. I sure love the Lord tonight.
[40:14] Amen. You love the Lord. How many have
[40:16] something to praise God for tonight?
[40:18] Amen. And we just certainly appreciate
[40:19] all that he's done for us. And brother
[40:22] Royy's got quite a testimony in his own
[40:24] life. And and he's Lord many have been
[40:27] blessed by his testimony and sure
[40:29] appreciate their stand him and his wife
[40:33] and elders in the gospel and certainly
[40:36] have quite a stand. And I it's
[40:39] encouraging to me. They've always been
[40:41] an encouragement to me. And you know,
[40:43] somebody told me that yesterday we were
[40:45] talking about it and said, you know, uh
[40:47] that you have a a lot of thought and a
[40:50] lot of things to say about elders. And I
[40:52] said, well, we wouldn't be here without
[40:53] them. So I I certainly I believe that
[40:56] they have I hold them in the highest
[40:58] regard elders in this in this gospel and
[41:02] that have walked this walk through many
[41:04] great trials and and give us an example
[41:06] of how to stand in the face of trouble
[41:08] and tribulation and things that we face.
[41:11] And so I certainly appreciate each one
[41:13] of you. Tonight we have brother Andrew
[41:15] who's going to be speaking for us
[41:16] tonight and and he's he's a daddy of a a
[41:21] new baby girl now. So uh maybe we'll see
[41:24] a softer side. I don't know what that
[41:25] does uh in to to brother Andrew, but we
[41:29] are certainly looking forward to it. And
[41:32] may the Lord bless him tonight. Just
[41:33] remember him in prayer. Also we have a
[41:36] prayer request uh for Andrew Hoff. He's
[41:40] the great grandson of brother Danny and
[41:42] sister Evelyn Walker, 12 years old and
[41:46] autistic, a very needed prayer. So, we
[41:48] just want to remember him in prayer
[41:50] tonight. And maybe if you have a need on
[41:52] your heart, just lift your hand to the
[41:54] Lord. I know God is mindful of what we
[41:55] have need of. So, let's just pray
[41:57] together. Gracious heavenly father,
[41:59] Lord, how honored that we are, Lord,
[42:02] just to be able to come and gather
[42:05] together with brothers and sisters,
[42:07] Lord, that such a desire on our heart to

[42:21] we just come to receive something from
[42:23] you. And Lord, to draw strength. And we
[42:26] just ask you tonight, Lord, that you
[42:27] would be with each one, God. May you
[42:29] speak to every heart, Lord. May you
[42:31] touch those that that need touch
[42:33] tonight, Lord. Maybe need healing in
[42:35] their body, Lord. God, we ask you for
[42:37] this young man, Lord, that you would
[42:39] touch him, Lord. Whatever their needs
[42:40] are, God, that you know all things,
[42:42] Lord. You're so mindful of us, of your
[42:44] children, Lord. We just ask you that you
[42:46] would move in a special way, Lord. We
[42:48] just want to invite you to come now in
[42:50] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. and you

[42:59] word? Amen. I said, how many's looking
[43:01] forward to the preaching of the word?
[43:02] Amen. We sure love the word of God.
[43:04] There's something about this church.
[43:06] We're not afraid of the word of God.
[43:07] Amen. Amen. It don't matter if it's
[43:09] corrective, we're going to take it. If
[43:11] it's encouraging, we're going to take
[43:12] it. And whatever God has to say to us
[43:14] tonight, that's what we want to we want
[43:16] to draw something from the Lord. Amen.
[43:19] Amen. Can we sing Master of the Wind?

[43:27] Andrew to come.
[43:30] [Music]
[43:32] My boat of life
[43:35] sails on a trouble sea.
[43:39] Ever there's a wind in my sail.
[43:45] But I have a friend who watches over me
[43:51] when the breeze turns into a game.
[43:58] I know the master of the wind.
[44:05] I know the maker of the rain.
[44:11] He can calm a storm, make the sun shine
[44:15] again.
[44:18] I know the master of the wind.
[44:24] Sometimes I soar like an eagle through
[44:28] the sky.
[44:30] Among the peace my soul can be found.
[44:36] But when an unexpected storm may drive
[44:40] me from the highest,
[44:42] bring me low, but never keep me down.
[44:47] [Applause]
[44:49] I know the master of the wind.
[44:56] I know the maker of the rain.
[45:01] He can calm the storm, make the sun
[45:05] shine again.
[45:08] I know the master of. How many can say
[45:11] this is your testimony tonight?
[45:14] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[45:18] sky.
[45:20] Above the peaks my soul can be found.
[45:25] Sometimes an unexpected storm, it may
[45:29] drive me from the high,
[45:32] it'll bring me low and never keep me
[45:35] down.
[45:39] Cuz I know
[45:41] how you tonight. Yes, I know
[45:46] the maker of the rain.
[45:49] [Music]
[45:52] Call the storm. Make the sun shine
[45:55] again.
[45:57] I know the master.
[46:02] Yes, I know the master of the way.
[46:09] I know the maker of the grave.
[46:14] Oh yes, he can come.
[46:18] Make the sun shine again.
[46:22] I know the master of me. Amen. How many
[46:26] knows him here tonight? Amen. How many
[46:28] knows him personally here tonight? Amen.
[46:31] There's one thing about it that in this
[46:33] hour, Amen. We have been, we have been
[46:35] scripturally taught, amen, that the
[46:37] sunny skies are no sign of God's
[46:39] approval and the cloudy skies are no
[46:41] sign of God's disapproval, but his
[46:44] approval is in his word, in his love, in
[46:46] that he loved us wherewith we were
[46:48] unlovable. Amen. I I thank the Lord
[46:51] tonight that I'm not serving God by the
[46:52] weather. Amen. Tonight it would be a
[46:55] little gloomy. It'd be a little doomy.
[46:56] But Amen. Because the son of God has
[46:59] arisen in our hearts tonight and we can
[47:01] testify. Amen. No matter what tomorrow
[47:03] holds, we know who holds tomorrow. Amen.
[47:06] Amen. How many is happy to be in the
[47:07] house of God? Amen. Won't you just give
[47:09] the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight?
[47:12] Amen. I believe he's worthy. He's worthy
[47:15] of all our praise. He's worthy of
[47:17] everything that we could give him
[47:18] tonight. It's a real honor to be in his
[47:21] house and to be home to be gathered with
[47:23] believers of like precious faith. And
[47:25] amen, we just want to take this
[47:27] opportunity tonight to greet you in the
[47:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. There's
[47:31] not a higher name that we could greet
[47:32] you in tonight than his name. And amen,
[47:35] we trust the Lord is blessing every one
[47:36] of you all. And amen, it's sure good to
[47:38] see everyone out in the house of God on
[47:40] this Wednesday evening. And amen, I know
[47:42] you've no doubt had a rough day, but
[47:44] you've pressed on. And we say God bless
[47:46] you all for being here tonight. And
[47:48] amen. We want to just thank the take
[47:50] this opportunity to thank the church.
[47:51] And as brother Matt mentioned, we do
[47:53] have a a new addition to our family
[47:55] there. Little Haven Grace was born on
[47:57] Saturday and all is well. Mama and
[47:59] baby's doing well and recovering. So we
[48:02] we thank the Lord for that. And Amen.
[48:04] Little uh Malachi is getting stronger
[48:05] every day. So we thank the Lord for
[48:07] that. And Amen. I just want to just say
[48:09] this. I thank the church for all your
[48:11] prayers and support and all the support
[48:13] and help and love and phone calls and
[48:15] text and food and visits and everything
[48:18] that's been done for us. We just say
[48:19] thank you. And amen. May God richly
[48:22] bless you. Amen. I I was telling the
[48:23] church there in Georgia. We slipped away
[48:26] Thursday and preached there Friday night
[48:27] and flew back Saturday morning. And I
[48:29] told them the only way I'm here is we
[48:31] got a church back home that's helping
[48:32] us. And amen, we we do thank you all for
[48:35] that tonight. And amen, we do want to
[48:37] say that the Lord is the Lord is doing
[48:40] some wonderful things among us in this
[48:41] hour and we're just happy to be a part
[48:43] of it tonight. Amen. We say God bless
[48:46] you, Brother Roy, Sister Judy. Sure,
[48:47] good to see you all. Enjoyed that song.
[48:49] And Amen. I I feel the atmosphere of the
[48:51] Holy Spirit here tonight. May we just
[48:53] bow our hearts for a word of prayer. I
[48:55] wonder tonight how many just say, "Lord,
[48:57] on this Wednesday evening, come by my
[48:59] way. I recognize your presence. I
[49:01] recognize your spirit is here." Let's
[49:03] just approach him tonight. Heavenly
[49:05] Father, Lord, as your believers have
[49:07] gathered here on this Wednesday evening,
[49:09] Father, as we have stepped into the
[49:11] sanctuary tonight, there's Lord such a
[49:13] such a warmth of your presence among us
[49:16] tonight. And Lord, we know that these
[49:18] are not just human beings standing
[49:19] before us. But Father, this is the
[49:22] purchase of your blood, what you shed
[49:24] your blood for. And Lord, you've you've
[49:26] sent them into this service tonight.
[49:27] You've gathered us together here. Lord,
[49:30] we've not gathered to see a man or to
[49:31] hear from a man, but Lord, we've
[49:33] gathered here to worship you and to lift
[49:35] up the name that is above every name.
[49:38] Lord, we've come here tonight to take a
[49:40] few moments and to open your word and to
[49:42] proclaim the things that you have
[49:44] revealed in this generation. And I pray
[49:46] tonight, Lord, that you would send the
[49:47] spirit of wisdom and revelation into the
[49:49] building. I pray the Holy Ghost of God
[49:51] would fill this room, Lord. Father, as
[49:54] we were just talking to you on the way
[49:55] over here tonight, Lord, I know that
[49:57] every individual standing before me
[49:59] tonight has gathered here with needs.
[50:01] And Lord, I I admit tonight as a human,
[50:04] I have no ability, no way to meet the
[50:06] need. But Lord, I have confidence in
[50:08] your anointing tonight that if I can get
[50:10] myself out of the way that Lord, you can
[50:13] come among us and you can lead us and
[50:15] guide us into the things that would be
[50:16] beneficial. Oh father, I pray tonight
[50:19] Lord for sick bodies, God. Lord, may
[50:21] healing take place in those bodies for
[50:23] empty vessels tonight. May they be
[50:25] filled with your glory. Lord, for those
[50:27] streaming at home, unable to be here. I
[50:30] pray the angel of God would pass through
[50:32] their homes tonight. And Lord, I pray
[50:34] that you would send a surge of
[50:35] supernatural strength into every heart.
[50:37] Forgive us of our failures, Lord.
[50:39] Forgive us of our shortcomings, oh God.
[50:41] Lord, transform us by your word tonight
[50:44] and we'll be sure to give thee all the
[50:45] praise, all the honor, and all the
[50:47] glory. In the wonderful name of our Lord
[50:49] and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. And
[50:52] all the believers says, "Amen." And
[50:55] amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[50:57] we want to go to the book of Hebrews,
[50:58] the 10th chapter. The book of Hebrews,
[51:01] the 10th chapter. We're going to go back
[51:03] to the 35th verse of Hebrews 10. Amen.
[51:06] We just pray that it'll be a blessing to
[51:08] you tonight. We have something here on
[51:09] our heart from Hebrews 10:35. And then
[51:12] also we're going to turn over to Hebrews
[51:14] 11.
[51:15] You love the Lord tonight.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul here writing in Hebrews
[51:20] 10:35. Last time we spoke to you, he
[51:22] were speaking on this first portion of
[51:24] Hebrews 10:35 on spiritual confidence.
[51:27] Paul says, "Cast not away therefore your
[51:31] confidence,
[51:33] which hath great recompense of reward."
[51:37] I love that. Cast not away therefore
[51:39] your confidence which hath great
[51:42] recompense of reward. In the book of
[51:45] Hebrews the 11th chapter and the sixth
[51:48] verse. Hebrews 11 and verse number six
[51:52] Paul again here speaking he says but
[51:55] without faith it is impossible to please
[51:58] him. For he that cometh to God must
[52:01] believe that he is and that he is a
[52:05] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[52:09] him. Amen. Maybe tonight as you're
[52:11] seated, just look at somebody and say,
[52:12] "There's a reward coming."
[52:15] There's a reward coming. We ask the Lord
[52:17] this evening to bless the reading of his
[52:18] word. As you can have your seats here
[52:20] tonight, if the Lord would help me from
[52:22] that passage of scripture, those two
[52:24] places tonight, I want to talk to you
[52:26] for a few moments on this. There's a
[52:28] reward coming. Amen. There's a reward
[52:31] coming. The prophet of God would say in
[52:33] a sermon, God doesn't call man to
[52:34] judgment without first warning him. He
[52:37] said, "Now, there is a coming blessing
[52:39] just as the same as there is a coming
[52:42] wrath." Amen. There is a coming blessing
[52:44] just as the same as there is a coming
[52:47] wrath. Oh, we have to be looking for one
[52:49] of it tonight. You have to either be
[52:51] looking for the wrath to fall upon you
[52:54] and for destruction or either you have
[52:56] to be looking for the resurrection of
[52:58] the Lord Jesus. I I think that's
[53:00] powerful tonight. Either you're looking
[53:02] for the wrath of God, amen, that's going
[53:04] to bring a destruction or you're looking
[53:06] for direction of God that's going to
[53:08] bring a transformation. He said the same
[53:10] God, amen, that promised one promised
[53:13] the other. Now, as I said last time we
[53:15] were speaking to you here on cast not
[53:17] away your spiritual confidence and maybe
[53:20] uh just to refresh your memory there in
[53:22] that that that definition of spiritual
[53:25] confidence, it means a deep unwavering
[53:27] belief and trust, amen, in the higher
[53:30] power. It is a it is a divine wisdom
[53:32] that resides in one's own soul. It
[53:35] provides the inner strength and
[53:37] resilience, amen, to navigate life's
[53:39] challenges. Amen. A spiritual confidence
[53:42] is not pride or arrogance, amen. But it
[53:45] is a humble conviction that is rooted in
[53:48] one's connection to something greater,
[53:50] amen, than oneself. And it is leading to
[53:53] peace, love, and a fearless approach to
[53:56] life's uncertainties. How many can
[53:58] testify tonight that this life, amen, it
[54:01] holds many uncertainties? Amen. But
[54:04] there is one thing that we know tonight,
[54:06] amen, that we do not have to approach
[54:08] the uncertainties of life. Amen. Out of
[54:11] fear or out of doubt or out of worry,
[54:13] but rather we can approach it with
[54:15] confidence knowing God, amen, is able to
[54:17] deliver. Now, when you look here at this
[54:19] word, spiritual confidence, if you can
[54:21] put this one in my ear, it's not in
[54:22] there. Uh when you look there at that
[54:24] word spiritual confidence, another
[54:26] another way that we could say that is
[54:28] spiritual revelation. And here tonight,
[54:30] amen, as I said, I want to take that
[54:32] second half of that scripture. Amen.
[54:34] That if you'll cast not away your
[54:36] confidence, amen, there is a recompense
[54:39] of reward. When you look there at that
[54:40] word recompense of reward, it is a
[54:42] repayment or a compensation that is
[54:45] given as a reward. It is often for good
[54:48] actions. Amen. Faithfulness or service.
[54:51] Now, I just want to open tonight by
[54:53] saying this that we are not serving God.
[54:55] Amen. Simply for a reward. Amen. We're
[54:58] not we're not fulfilling the things of
[55:00] God and doing the things that God
[55:02] requires us to do. Amen. Simply because
[55:04] we're wanting a reward. The prophet of
[55:06] God said, "If I am condemned when I come
[55:08] up before the judgment seat of God at
[55:10] the end time," Amen. If it's planned
[55:12] that way and I have to stand in his
[55:14] presence, and he points his majestic
[55:17] finger at me and says, "Depart from me
[55:19] if I keep that same attitude that I have
[55:22] now and I be in hell." He said, "I will
[55:25] still love him." And he's just, he said,
[55:28] now I deserve to go there at the first
[55:30] place. And if I knew that I was going to
[55:32] be condemned and know now that I would
[55:34] be condemned at the end, amen, after I
[55:36] worked for him a hundred years from now,
[55:39] amen, I would still desire to work for
[55:42] him. If there would be no heaven, if
[55:45] there would be no reward, Amen, I still
[55:48] want to be a Christian. I I wonder not
[55:50] how many can say that's me. Amen. Amen.
[55:52] If there was no heaven, if there was no
[55:54] reward, amen, I still want to be a
[55:57] Christian. Amen. because it's a perfect
[55:59] satisfaction. Now, amen. I believe
[56:01] tonight that God's rewards are not
[56:03] temporary. Amen. Amen. I believe God
[56:06] gives eternal rewards. The prophet of
[56:08] God would say that all too little time,
[56:11] amen, is spent on laboring for the
[56:14] eternal rewards of God. He said, "Now
[56:17] the recompense of God is too lightly
[56:19] esteemed. If we believe in the reality
[56:22] of the resurrection of the body, amen,
[56:25] an eternal kingdom of substance, then we
[56:27] ought to lay up in heaven, amen, those
[56:30] good treasures that are available, amen,
[56:32] to the faithful saints. Amen. I don't
[56:35] know about you tonight, but I believe
[56:36] there is a reality, amen, of the
[56:39] resurrection. Now, amen, I find it
[56:41] amazing in this hour that you are
[56:43] faithful saints. And, amen, you're
[56:45] striving and you're persevering to
[56:47] fulfill the will of God. Amen. But at
[56:49] the same time, the devil, amen, is doing
[56:52] everything he can. Amen. As the prophet
[56:54] of God would say, he's working overtime.
[56:56] Amen. What he's trying to do is he's
[56:58] trying to knock, Amen, the spiritual
[57:01] confidence out of you. Amen. That God
[57:03] has instilled in you. Brother Brother
[57:06] Random is speaking there in 1959 of
[57:08] Elijah the prophet. And he said, "Now
[57:10] watch after your Mount Carmels. You're
[57:12] going to have, Amen, a juniper tree."
[57:14] Amen. After a Mount Carmel, there was
[57:16] going to be a juniper tree. Whenever a
[57:19] man has a blessing and the power of God
[57:21] pours down and does something for you,
[57:24] look out. Amen. Satan is on the track.
[57:27] How many can testify? Amen. Whenever God
[57:29] moves, the devil moves also. He said,
[57:32] "But just remember the next day, that
[57:34] Monday, after a good day on Sunday, it's
[57:36] going to be a hard thing because he's
[57:39] going to do everything he can, amen, to
[57:41] knock that confidence out of you, amen,
[57:44] that the Holy Spirit instilled in you
[57:46] the day before." Now, it's very
[57:48] important to note something here, amen,
[57:51] who is instilling this confidence. Amen.
[57:54] I love what Paul says in Romans 15:13.
[57:57] He says, "Now the God of hope fill you
[57:59] with all joy and peace in believing that
[58:02] you may abound in hope through the power
[58:05] of the Holy Ghost." So it is not a man
[58:08] that is instilling this confidence into
[58:10] your soul. But it is the Holy Ghost of
[58:13] God, amen, instilling something in you,
[58:16] amen, to get you through whatever is
[58:18] laying in front of you. Amen. I think
[58:20] it's amazing when you when you look
[58:22] there at that word instill. Amen. It
[58:24] means gradually but firmly establish.
[58:27] Amen. It means to gradually but firmly
[58:30] establish an idea or attitude. Amen.
[58:33] Especially a desirable one. Amen. In a
[58:36] person's mind. I'll say this tonight.
[58:38] The Holy Spirit is here. Amen. To
[58:41] instill in our hearts the faith, amen,
[58:44] that was once delivered to the saints.
[58:47] He said, I pray God that you'll instill
[58:49] in our hearts the power of the
[58:51] resurrected Jesus Christ. another place.
[58:53] If the sick person can ever meet God,
[58:56] that no matter how crippled you remain,
[58:58] how sick you remain, how blind you
[59:00] remain, you ever meet God, amen, there
[59:03] is something sinks into you and you
[59:06] don't see it anymore of these
[59:07] circumstances.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; He said, you look at what God said.
[59:12] Amen. Now, God could, now listen, God
[59:14] could ever get away, amen, down to the
[59:17] cares of life into your heart and to
[59:20] instill a faith there. Then there's
[59:22] nothing in the world that will ever
[59:24] shake you from it. Amen. If the Holy
[59:27] Ghost can ever get through all the cares
[59:28] of your life and can ever instill into
[59:31] your heart, amen, the confidence of the
[59:34] faith of God, there is nothing in the
[59:36] world that will ever take you from it.
[59:38] Amen. It's amazing because spiritual
[59:40] warfare, amen, does not begin before a
[59:43] man meets God. Amen. But spiritual
[59:46] warfare begins when a man meets God. And
[59:49] the prophet of God said, "You're going
[59:50] to have to fight." Amen. If you're going
[59:52] to reign, I I love what Paul says there
[59:54] in Hebrews 3:14. He says, "For we are
[59:57] made partakers of Christ, amen, if we
[1:00:00] hold the beginning of our confidence,
[1:00:02] Amen, steadfast until the end." So, not
[1:00:05] amen, just getting confidence. Amen. But
[1:00:08] hold that confidence steadfast. Amen.
[1:00:11] Until the end. Brother said, "I think
[1:00:12] it's time." Amen. That we got to know
[1:00:15] how we stand. How can you do anything
[1:00:17] unless you got faith in what you're
[1:00:19] doing? See? Amen. You've got to have
[1:00:21] faith. And that's my purpose of doing
[1:00:24] this with the church here. Amen. Is to
[1:00:26] give the believers faith. Amen. And
[1:00:29] confidence in what they're standing for
[1:00:31] because it's the word of the Lord. He
[1:00:35] said that as long as through the
[1:00:36] scripture, Amen. It is sovereignly
[1:00:38] placed from Genesis into Revelation.
[1:00:40] Amen. Back and forth, up and down. He
[1:00:43] says, "Then there's not a way, amen, for
[1:00:45] the devil to move in there anywhere."
[1:00:48] Amen. Then you got perfect confidence.
[1:00:51] Amen. See, then you know where you're
[1:00:53] standing. Amen. This message is God.
[1:00:57] Amen. Through the seventh angel. Amen.
[1:00:59] Positionally placing you. Amen. Not in a
[1:01:02] church handbook or in a creed book.
[1:01:04] Amen. but placing you in the scripture.
[1:01:07] Amen. All the way from Genesis unto
[1:01:09] Revelation. Amen. And he's given you a
[1:01:12] place to stand and a place to fight
[1:01:14] from. Listen, we don't fight from our
[1:01:16] emotions. We don't fight from our
[1:01:18] sensation. We don't fight from our
[1:01:20] feelings. Amen. If we're going to fight
[1:01:22] the devil, we got to have somewhere to
[1:01:24] fight him from. And we fight the devil
[1:01:26] from the word of God. Amen. Upon the
[1:01:28] word of God. Amen. That's why the
[1:01:30] prophet of God said, "Satan hates two
[1:01:32] books." Y'all know that.
[1:01:35] He hates two books more than any book in
[1:01:37] the Bible. Amen. That is the book of
[1:01:39] Genesis and that is the book of
[1:01:41] Revelation. He said through theologians
[1:01:43] and pose scientists. He is always
[1:01:46] attacking those two books. He said it's
[1:01:48] in both of these books we find. Amen.
[1:01:51] Satan's origin, his awful ways and his
[1:01:54] destruction. He said that is why he
[1:01:56] attacks them. Amen. He hates to be
[1:01:59] exposed. And in those books, he is
[1:02:02] exposed for exactly, amen, what he is.
[1:02:05] See, you all know Jesus said that the
[1:02:07] devil has no part in me. Amen. And I
[1:02:10] have no part in him. He said, now the
[1:02:13] devil would like to prove that
[1:02:14] different, but he cannot. Amen. So, he
[1:02:17] does all that he can, amen, to destroy
[1:02:20] the confidence in the word. But when the
[1:02:23] church, how many here's a part of the
[1:02:25] church, disbelieves Satan and believes
[1:02:28] the spirit's revelation of the word, he
[1:02:31] said, then the gates of hell, amen,
[1:02:34] cannot prevail against her. Amen. You
[1:02:36] say, why is the devil, Amen, trying to
[1:02:39] knock out this confidence, amen, because
[1:02:41] he knows that there is a reward that is
[1:02:44] coming to that confidence. In Genesis
[1:02:46] 15:1, I love what the Bible says. After
[1:02:49] these things, the word of the Lord came
[1:02:51] unto Abram in a vision. And here's what
[1:02:53] it said. Fear not, Abram. Amen. For I am
[1:02:56] thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:02:58] reward. Amen. Now, notice this. The
[1:03:01] source of Abraham's confidence, Amen,
[1:03:04] was coming from the word.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was coming from the vision that
[1:03:08] God gave him. And look what he says. He
[1:03:11] says, "I am thy shield." Amen. And if
[1:03:14] God is your shield, Amen. Then how's the
[1:03:16] devil going to hit you? Amen. If God is
[1:03:19] your shield, amen, then how is the devil
[1:03:22] going to hit you? I am your shield and I
[1:03:25] am your exceeding great reward. Who is?
[1:03:28] I am the Lord. Amen. Your exceeding
[1:03:31] great reward. Amen. Now, I find it
[1:03:33] amazing that there is a shield. Amen.
[1:03:36] And there is a reward. Why? Why is there
[1:03:38] a shield? Amen. Before there's a reward,
[1:03:41] amen. You know what that's signifying,
[1:03:43] don't you? Amen. is signifying a battle
[1:03:45] that you're going to have to fight in
[1:03:48] order to possess the reward that is
[1:03:50] coming to the confidence that God has
[1:03:52] instilled in you by his word. You all
[1:03:55] know what Paul said. He said, "Above all
[1:03:57] taking, Amen. the shield of faith
[1:04:00] wherewith you shall be able, amen, to
[1:04:02] quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:04:04] wicked." Amen. I love that word shield.
[1:04:06] Amen. It is a large oblong. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:09] It is a four cornered shield. Amen. Come
[1:04:12] on, church. It's not a mystery. Amen.
[1:04:14] There are four gospels and God would
[1:04:16] give you a four cornered shield. Amen.
[1:04:19] To fight against the devil in order to
[1:04:22] possess your reward. Prophet of God
[1:04:24] said, "Brother, sister, today I've got a
[1:04:26] uniform and I'm in the army." Amen. I'm
[1:04:28] in the army of the Lord. I'm fighting
[1:04:30] the foes of the wicked. Amen. But I'm
[1:04:33] dressed. Amen. I love that. I'm fighting
[1:04:35] the foes of the wicked. Amen. But I'm
[1:04:37] dressed. Now, you might not be able to
[1:04:40] see it, but I know it's there. Amen. I
[1:04:42] feel it. Amen. The armor of God. Amen.
[1:04:45] The full gospel in my heart, the baptism
[1:04:48] of the Holy Ghost, God working signs and
[1:04:50] wonders.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The helmet of faith, the shield of
[1:04:54] faith and the helmet of salvation, and
[1:04:57] your shaw with the gospel. Amen. The
[1:04:59] sword in your hand. Amen. Join with you
[1:05:01] ranks out here now. He said, "But now
[1:05:04] watch. Our armor is on the inside of
[1:05:06] us." Amen. Our armor is not on the
[1:05:09] outside. Amen. But our armor is on the
[1:05:12] inside. And the prophet of God said,
[1:05:14] "Above all," Amen. things, you take the
[1:05:17] shield of faith and you move forward.
[1:05:21] Amen. Can I preach to you tonight? Amen.
[1:05:23] It's time to quit going backwards. Amen.
[1:05:25] It's time to quit staying where we were
[1:05:27] on Sunday and where we were last
[1:05:29] Wednesday. Amen. We are the church of
[1:05:31] the living God and we have got land to
[1:05:34] inherit. We have got promises to
[1:05:36] possess. We have got victories to taste
[1:05:38] of. Listen, this is not the time, amen,
[1:05:41] to lay down and become slothful in the
[1:05:43] things of God. This is the time to put
[1:05:46] on the helmet of salvation. It's the
[1:05:48] time to put on the shield of faith. It's
[1:05:50] the time to move. Amen. If there's going
[1:05:53] to be a reward, Amen. There's got to be
[1:05:55] somebody doing the rewarding. Amen. If
[1:05:58] there's a reward, Amen. then there is a
[1:06:01] rewarder.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; If there's a reward, then there's a
[1:06:06] rewarder. Look what Paul says. in
[1:06:08] Hebrews 11:6, the Amplified Bible, but
[1:06:11] without faith it is impossible, amen, to
[1:06:13] walk with God and to please him. For
[1:06:16] whosoever comes near to God must
[1:06:19] necessarily believe, amen, that God
[1:06:22] exists. Amen. If a man is going to come
[1:06:24] near to God, the first thing he's got to
[1:06:27] believe, amen, is that God exists and
[1:06:30] that he rewards those who will earnestly
[1:06:33] and diligently seek him. Amen. I love
[1:06:36] what a prophet said. He said, "This is
[1:06:38] the key note to the scriptures, faith.
[1:06:40] He that cometh to God, amen, must
[1:06:43] believe that he is and that he is a
[1:06:45] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:06:48] him." He said, "Now maybe that's why the
[1:06:50] sickness is on you." Amen. That God has
[1:06:52] to educate you. Amen. To a place that he
[1:06:56] is. Amen. Somebody say, "God is." Amen.
[1:06:59] Not God was. Amen. Not God will be.
[1:07:03] Amen. But somebody's got to rise up and
[1:07:05] say, "God is Amen. God is a savior."
[1:07:09] Amen. God is a healer. God is a
[1:07:11] deliverer. God is a way maker. God is a
[1:07:14] soul saver. God is a problem fixer. God
[1:07:18] is a marriage fixer. God is a family
[1:07:20] restorer. Listen, I think it's time to
[1:07:23] quit putting in the future. And I think
[1:07:24] it's time to quit leaving in the past. I
[1:07:27] think it's time somebody Amen. rise up
[1:07:29] with the faith of Abraham and call the
[1:07:32] things of God present tense in the face
[1:07:34] of the devil that's trying to put it as
[1:07:36] a historical affair.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God is. Amen. That's why.
[1:07:41] Amen. Somebody say, "Well, I know."
[1:07:44] Amen. Now, watch. If you've been born
[1:07:45] again, then you can say, "I know." Amen.
[1:07:48] Nobody can tell me I know he's a healer.
[1:07:52] Amen. The only way that a person can
[1:07:54] say, "I know." Amen. Is by an
[1:07:56] experience. And you know what Paul said?
[1:07:58] He said, "Wherefore I give you to
[1:08:00] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:08:02] spirit of God callth Jesus a curse and
[1:08:05] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:08:07] Lord." Amen. But by the Holy Ghost. Do
[1:08:11] you realize you can't even call Jesus
[1:08:13] the Lord? Amen. But by the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:16] Brother Graham come along and said every
[1:08:18] man that'll come to Christ and that'll
[1:08:20] believe that he is and the rewarder of
[1:08:23] those who seek him and give up their
[1:08:25] sins. How many want to give up your sins
[1:08:28] and throw their arms open to God can
[1:08:31] have not could or possibly they can
[1:08:33] have. Amen. Not something that looks
[1:08:36] like it. Amen. Some imitation of it, but
[1:08:39] a genuine heart full of the real baptism
[1:08:43] of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day
[1:08:45] of Pentecost. Listen, I think it's time,
[1:08:48] amen, to let the faith of God move into
[1:08:50] our hearts and throw our hearts open to
[1:08:52] God and say, "Lord, I don't want a chill
[1:08:54] bump. I don't want a goosebump. I don't
[1:08:57] want a good feeling, Lord. Amen. I want
[1:08:59] something that'll come on the depths of
[1:09:01] my soul and it'll bring this body
[1:09:03] subject to the word.
[1:09:06] Now,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; now y'all know I'm in the word. Amen.
[1:09:08] Because anything outside the Holy Ghost
[1:09:10] is an impersonation.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Psychology is an impersonation. Amen.
[1:09:16] Education is an impersonation. Amen. But
[1:09:19] God has delivered unto us in this
[1:09:20] generation. Amen. The reality of his
[1:09:23] genuine Holy Ghost. Amen. Then I think
[1:09:26] it's amazing that the faith of God,
[1:09:28] Amen, that has been instilled in a
[1:09:30] believer's heart, amen, is actually what
[1:09:33] is causing you, Amen, to expect the
[1:09:35] things that you're expecting. In Job 5
[1:09:38] and verse 8, Job says, "I would seek
[1:09:40] unto God, and unto God would I commit my
[1:09:43] cause." Now watch this in verse 9,
[1:09:45] "Which doeth great things." Amen.
[1:09:48] Unsearchable and marvelous things. Amen.
[1:09:51] Things without number. Brother said,
[1:09:53] "God will do great things for you if you
[1:09:56] will only believe."
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; But you must believe that he is. For
[1:10:03] those who come to him must believe that
[1:10:05] he is and a rewarder of those who
[1:10:08] diligently seek him. He said, "Now, you
[1:10:10] cannot sit there half dead and believe
[1:10:13] some kind of a cold doctrine and then
[1:10:15] expect to get something from God. You've
[1:10:17] got to believe that he is." And then
[1:10:20] listen, you can't believe some cold
[1:10:22] doctrine about God and get the
[1:10:24] manifestation to your expectation.
[1:10:26] You've got to believe that he is and
[1:10:28] that he's a rewarder of those who
[1:10:30] diligently seek him. Reverson said,
[1:10:32] "It's become such a place." Amen. Till
[1:10:34] the spirit of God has been grieved. And
[1:10:37] any church that denies the supernatural,
[1:10:39] it'll die as sure as I am standing in
[1:10:42] this pull pit. Amen. I'm going to tell
[1:10:44] you all the devil has introduced the
[1:10:46] idea, amen, that the supernatural is not
[1:10:49] real. But said, how do you know unless
[1:10:52] you taste and see? Oh, the poet said,
[1:10:54] "Taste and see." Amen. That the Lord is
[1:10:57] good. He is the rewarder of those who
[1:11:00] diligently seek after him. He's not the
[1:11:02] rewarder of those who stand back and
[1:11:04] criticize. Now, now, do you know what
[1:11:07] criticizing will do? It'll cause you to
[1:11:09] begin to lose confidence. It'll cause
[1:11:11] you to begin to lose faith. The prophet
[1:11:13] of God said, "If we lose faith, then we
[1:11:16] will never get a prayer answered by
[1:11:18] God."
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. That's pretty heavy. If we
[1:11:22] ever lose faith, we will never get a
[1:11:25] prayer answered by God. For he that
[1:11:27] cometh to God must first believe that he
[1:11:30] is and a rewarder of those that
[1:11:31] diligently seek after him. So, if we
[1:11:34] lose faith, then our prayers are
[1:11:36] anulled. We get nowhere. If we lose our
[1:11:40] faith, then our prayers are anold. Now,
[1:11:43] amen. I know that sometimes we get
[1:11:45] embarrassed. Amen. Because maybe we
[1:11:47] can't pray like somebody else or we
[1:11:49] can't say certain words or quote
[1:11:50] scripture. Amen. But can I tell you what
[1:11:52] a prophet said? He said, "I'm standing
[1:11:54] here tonight." And he said, "I'm praying
[1:11:57] for you." He said, "But I don't have
[1:11:59] confidence in my prayer." He said, "My
[1:12:01] confidence is in the promise." Amen. So
[1:12:04] the confidence is not in the prayer.
[1:12:06] Amen. The confidence has got to be in
[1:12:08] the promise that you're praying about.
[1:12:11] Listen, you can get all your confidence
[1:12:12] in the way you pray and you can break
[1:12:15] words down and you can pray. You you can
[1:12:17] say everything just right and your
[1:12:19] prayer can be a null if there's no faith
[1:12:22] in the promise that you're praying
[1:12:23] about. But if there's faith in the pro,
[1:12:26] can I preach to you? If you're sick in
[1:12:28] your body and you begin to pray
[1:12:30] according to Isaiah 53 and all you can
[1:12:32] say is, "Lord, you are the God that
[1:12:35] healeth all thy diseases." Amen. that
[1:12:37] prayer, amen, will get a hold of God and
[1:12:40] he will come on the scene and he will
[1:12:42] begin to change the situation. Hey, it's
[1:12:45] all we can think of this morning is to
[1:12:47] hold on to faith. If we lose our faith,
[1:12:50] then all our hopes is gone. If we lose
[1:12:53] our faith, listen church, if we lose our
[1:12:55] faith, then all our spiritual reality is
[1:12:59] gone. That's right.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; The minute we lose our faith, then all
[1:13:04] the spiritual reality is gone. For you
[1:13:08] cannot have faith in things that you
[1:13:10] see, for those things you see are
[1:13:12] perishable. Now, I find it tonight that
[1:13:15] the new birth is the only way to bring a
[1:13:18] spiritual reality into a human being.
[1:13:22] Brother said, "See, you cannot have
[1:13:23] faith until you're born again."
[1:13:26] He said, "But there's a people on the
[1:13:28] earth that has been born again, and they
[1:13:31] will see the spiritual." And listen, can
[1:13:33] I say this to you? Amen. You will see
[1:13:36] the spiritual and the little realities
[1:13:39] of the body change. Listen, if you can
[1:13:42] put your faith and your confidence in
[1:13:44] the promise that I'm the Lord that will
[1:13:47] change thy body, you will see the
[1:13:50] literal spiritual reality of the body
[1:13:52] change. He said, "Oh, I want to see
[1:13:54] him." How many How many say, "Oh, I want
[1:13:56] to see him." Amen. I want to see the
[1:13:59] hour I look and see all these old bodies
[1:14:02] transformed. I want to see them changed
[1:14:05] in a moment, in a twinkle of an eye. If
[1:14:07] that isn't so, then we're most foolish
[1:14:10] people. He said, "We might as well eat,
[1:14:12] drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you're
[1:14:14] going to die." Amen. See, you're just
[1:14:16] like an animal. You die and go to the
[1:14:19] dirt and that's all. But there's an
[1:14:21] immortal soul. Glory to God. There's an
[1:14:24] immortal soul that is living in you,
[1:14:26] brother. Can I say what a prophet said?
[1:14:28] He said, "We've done heard from heaven."
[1:14:31] Well, glory to God. We've done heard
[1:14:34] from heaven. We have done seen it
[1:14:36] proven. And we know that he is, and he
[1:14:39] is a rewarder of those that diligently
[1:14:42] seek him. Listen, you're not just a
[1:14:44] people tonight that has heard from the
[1:14:46] church. You're not just a people tonight
[1:14:49] that has heard from a preacher, but you
[1:14:51] are a privileged people by the grace of
[1:14:53] almighty God. You have heard from
[1:14:56] heaven.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have heard from heaven.
[1:15:01] You say, "How does a believer hear from
[1:15:04] heaven?" Well, Matthew 16 answers that.
[1:15:07] The Bible says in the 17th verse,
[1:15:09] brother Brian, that Jesus answered and
[1:15:12] said unto him, blessed art thou, Simon
[1:15:14] Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not
[1:15:18] revealed it unto thee, but my father
[1:15:21] which is in heaven. Glory to God. You
[1:15:24] say, how can you say that? Because the
[1:15:26] father was in Jesus.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. In the beginning was the word
[1:15:30] and the word was with God and the word
[1:15:32] was God and the word was made flesh.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The father was in Jesus. Amen. Can
[1:15:38] I go on and say it? So therefore, heaven
[1:15:41] was in Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. When
[1:15:44] they heard Jesus speak, they were not
[1:15:47] hearing from the rabbi. They were not
[1:15:49] hearing from the Pharisee. They were
[1:15:51] hearing from heaven. Oh, church of the
[1:15:53] living God. Hebrews 1 prophesied that
[1:15:56] that same Jesus would return in these
[1:15:58] last days and he would speak once again.
[1:16:01] Oh, can I say it tonight? Heaven's got a
[1:16:04] voice. Heaven's got a voice. Hey, and
[1:16:07] heaven don't just have a voice, but
[1:16:09] heaven's got an audience. Heaven's got
[1:16:12] somebody who's going to hear what he's
[1:16:14] got to say.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You say, "Preacher, you
[1:16:18] lost your mind." No, I haven't. Heaven
[1:16:20] is a real place, folks.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Heaven is speaking.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Heaven is talking. Heaven
[1:16:30] is talking. He said, "Now look, Satan
[1:16:32] thought he could twist him." Speaking of
[1:16:34] Job, are y'all with me tonight?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan thought he could twist Job
[1:16:38] around a little bit and could cuff him
[1:16:40] up and could make him deny God. But you
[1:16:43] see, Job with his perfect revelation.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Job had a perfect revelation. Now, are
[1:16:52] y'all ready for this?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Of God.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; How many would love to have a perfect
[1:16:58] revelation of God?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Can I go on? and who God was.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; But do you know there's a greater
[1:17:08] revelation to that?
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know what it is? And how God
[1:17:12] loved him.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Job did not just have a
[1:17:20] revelation of who God was
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; and of God at the present, but Job had a
[1:17:27] revelation
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; of how God loved him. Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Oh church, he said then you see when the
[1:17:35] sick people that's in this building, the
[1:17:37] crippled people or what you have need of
[1:17:40] God, when you can get that type of
[1:17:42] revelation that you are justified, when
[1:17:45] you are actually justified in asking the
[1:17:48] thing you're asking for and then you
[1:17:51] believe that he is a rewarder of those
[1:17:53] that diligently seek after him, then
[1:17:56] there's nothing can ever separate you
[1:17:58] from that faith that is anchored to you.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. This ain't just you
[1:18:04] anchoring to faith. This is the faith of
[1:18:06] God. Amen. Anchoring to you.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I might as well preach. I'm this
[1:18:12] close to it. He said, "But first it's
[1:18:14] got to be revealed to you." Now, watch
[1:18:16] what he says. And who is this Melzdc? He
[1:18:18] said, "Then after you recognized, Amen.
[1:18:21] the very word of God was eagle food.
[1:18:24] Then you left the other thing. You have
[1:18:26] been formed into the living image of the
[1:18:29] living God. You heard from your
[1:18:32] theophony.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You heard from your
[1:18:37] theophony. Can I tell you why you're
[1:18:39] here tonight? It's cuz confidence has
[1:18:42] been instilled in you by your theophony.
[1:18:46] The confidence that's in you is not
[1:18:48] coming from Grace Tabernacle. It's not
[1:18:50] coming from brother Mad. It's not coming
[1:18:52] from any preacher. The confidence that's
[1:18:55] on the inside of your soul has been
[1:18:57] instilled in you by the voice of heaven
[1:19:00] that is spoke unto you.
[1:19:02] [Applause]
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God, I think
[1:19:06] it's time to clean house a second. I
[1:19:08] think it's time to Amen. I know that
[1:19:10] devil running rampant. I think it's time
[1:19:12] to remember we got a message and we got
[1:19:14] a message to live by. We got a message
[1:19:16] to die by. We got a message to raise by.
[1:19:19] We got a message to marry by. We got a
[1:19:23] message to raise our kids by. We got a
[1:19:25] message to marry.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. I tell you right now, if we we
[1:19:29] fix a lot of stuff, if we' turn off all
[1:19:31] this nonsense and quit trying to marry
[1:19:33] and live by social media and get our
[1:19:35] heads back in the Bible,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; well, I might as well preach. I'm this
[1:19:40] close to it. You know why nervousness is
[1:19:42] gripping so many hearts? Is because
[1:19:44] everybody's trying to live by some
[1:19:46] unconverted Oh, God. some unconverted
[1:19:49] blogger that's trying to tell our mamas
[1:19:52] how to raise their babies and trying to
[1:19:53] tell our brothers how to be husband.
[1:19:55] Listen, the message of the hour is
[1:19:57] either the truth or it's not. And I
[1:19:59] believe this message is the truth. Then
[1:20:01] I think we ought to clean up our homes.
[1:20:03] We ought to clean up our marriages. We
[1:20:05] ought to clean up our families. And let
[1:20:07] heaven speak again.
[1:20:09] Well, I tell you how to get rid of
[1:20:11] grudges. Let heaven speak in your home
[1:20:13] and grudges will have to leave. I tell
[1:20:15] you how to fix marriages. Got heaven
[1:20:17] speaking your home.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Heaven is talking.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Your reward is talking to you.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I know the devil the devil don't like
[1:20:30] it, but but it's the truth anyhow.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything outside this message is
[1:20:36] lay out of seeing inspired
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and it's to weaken men and oh God
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; and make men diss rags.
[1:20:45] Come on.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. I don't know why I'm
[1:20:47] here, but I'm here to weaken the office
[1:20:49] of a husband and a father.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't so from the beginning.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Now, y'all know that probably God said
[1:20:58] it's got to a time where women have to
[1:21:00] be more spiritual than the men.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; But it's because you lost your
[1:21:06] confidence somewhere. But if you could
[1:21:08] ever realize that this message is not
[1:21:11] legalism,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; this message is your theophony speaking
[1:21:15] to you,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; brother said, then just think of it.
[1:21:18] Your glorified body is right here at the
[1:21:21] tabernacle. Now, y'all hear me? Your
[1:21:23] glorified body is right here at the
[1:21:27] tabernacle now. The presence of the Holy
[1:21:30] Spirit, which is your glorified
[1:21:32] condition. Do you realize you're
[1:21:34] glorified in Christ right now? Those who
[1:21:37] he justified, he has already glorified.
[1:21:40] And your own glorified body is standing
[1:21:44] near you right now in Christ Jesus to
[1:21:48] give you a strength like a charge going
[1:21:50] into a battery. The Holy Spirit is in
[1:21:53] you. It's to charge your body to give
[1:21:56] you new strength to heal you from the
[1:21:58] sickness to make you well. Oh church of
[1:22:01] the living God, I think it's time to
[1:22:03] unplug from Leosa. I think it's time to
[1:22:06] unplug, amen, from man's ideas and plug
[1:22:09] back into your theophony and let your
[1:22:11] theophony plug into you and let your
[1:22:14] theophony send a charge of strength
[1:22:16] through you.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. I tell you this. Amen.
[1:22:21] The devil's doing everything he can to
[1:22:22] destroy homes. He's doing everything he
[1:22:24] can to destroy families. He's doing
[1:22:26] everything he can to destroy
[1:22:28] relationships. But folks, we got a
[1:22:30] revelation to fight back against that
[1:22:32] devil with.
[1:22:35] Now, either you believe it or not,
[1:22:37] you've either got perfect revelation or
[1:22:39] you don't.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Perfect revelation comes from God. Now,
[1:22:44] I I think this is amazing that if Job
[1:22:47] under the blood of bulls and goats,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; could have a perfect revelation of how
[1:22:53] God loved him.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; What about the believer?
[1:23:02] See, if you ever got a revelation love
[1:23:04] of God, it changed the way you worship.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; If you ever got a real perfect
[1:23:10] revelation of the love of God, it would
[1:23:13] change the way you back the word.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; See, like if you don't have a perfect
[1:23:18] revelation love of God and a man of God
[1:23:20] starts preaching against some things,
[1:23:22] then you get all nervous. Well, he's
[1:23:25] after this and he's after that and he's
[1:23:26] after this and he heard this and he saw
[1:23:28] that and he said this and she told
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; but if you had a perfect revelation,
[1:23:33] you'd stand up and say, "That's God's
[1:23:35] love for me."
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; See, that's God not want me to miss the
[1:23:40] rapture.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's God not want me to be left
[1:23:44] behind. Listen what the Bible said. God
[1:23:46] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:23:48] begotten son that whosoever believe in
[1:23:50] him should not perish but have
[1:23:52] everlasting life. I love what Paul says
[1:23:54] in Romans 5:8. He said, "But God
[1:23:56] commanded his love toward us in that
[1:23:59] while we were yet sinners."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; While we were yet sinners, Christ died
[1:24:06] for us. Verse 9, much more then being
[1:24:09] now justified by his blood. We shall be
[1:24:12] saved from the wrath through him. Oh, in
[1:24:15] 1 John 4:10, herein is love, not that we
[1:24:19] love God, but that he loved us, and he
[1:24:22] sent his son to be the propitiation of
[1:24:26] our sins. I love 1 John 4:18. There is
[1:24:29] no fear in love. But perfect love
[1:24:32] casteth out fear, because fear hath
[1:24:35] torment, and he that fearth is not made
[1:24:38] perfect in love. Now listen, we love
[1:24:41] him.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we love him, brother Jared?
[1:24:44] Because he first loved us. Brother said,
[1:24:47] "Oh, you don't want to show the people."
[1:24:49] Amen. If you got a nice watch on, you
[1:24:51] don't want to show them what a fine
[1:24:53] crystal you got, what a fine face it's
[1:24:55] got, what kind of hands it's got, what
[1:24:57] fine rubies it's got, but you want to
[1:24:59] show what a wonderful time piece it is.
[1:25:02] And the world is sick and they are tired
[1:25:05] of looking at great big spires and
[1:25:07] looking at fine dressed people and
[1:25:09] looking at a bunch of isms. It wants to
[1:25:12] see the genuine love of God
[1:25:16] projected in the hearts of his people.
[1:25:18] That's what the world is looking for.
[1:25:21] The world is dying for love. Come on,
[1:25:23] church. The world is dying for love. He
[1:25:26] said the church is dying for love. But
[1:25:29] Jesus said, "Ye are the salt of the
[1:25:31] earth. But if the salt has lost its
[1:25:33] savor, it is henceforth good for nothing
[1:25:35] but to be trott in the feet of man. And
[1:25:37] if the church has lost its divine
[1:25:40] revelation of the love of God, it
[1:25:43] becomes a mock and a stalk and a
[1:25:46] stumbling block to the world. Well,
[1:25:48] glory to God. Not if you lose your
[1:25:50] revelation of the seventh seal. Not if
[1:25:52] you lose your revelation of prophets,
[1:25:54] not if you lose your revelation of the
[1:25:56] spoken word, but if you lose that divine
[1:25:59] revelation of the love of God. Now, come
[1:26:02] on. Because because if you had a divine
[1:26:04] revelation of the love of God, it makes
[1:26:07] you love people when they're not even
[1:26:09] lovable.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. It'll it'll make you
[1:26:14] forgive somebody.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; See, that's what the product of God is
[1:26:19] saying is the church is becoming a
[1:26:21] stumbling block because it's lost its
[1:26:23] perfect revelation of the love of God.
[1:26:26] Now, I just got to say what Isaiah said.
[1:26:28] He said, "The mountain shall depart
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; and the hills be removed,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; but my kindness shall not depart from
[1:26:35] thee."
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that something?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Now, if God's kindness won't depart from
[1:26:41] you, then why do you let your kindness
[1:26:43] depart from others?
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Well, this No. Why?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Why do we do it? Because the devil knows
[1:26:55] there's a reward coming to it. That's
[1:26:57] right.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Look, neither shall the covenant of my
[1:27:00] peace be removed, says the Lord. He that
[1:27:02] hath mercy on me. I love Ephesians 3:17,
[1:27:05] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:27:07] faith, that you be in rooted and
[1:27:09] grounded in love. Now, Brother says it
[1:27:12] beautiful. He says, when a man
[1:27:13] experiences the depth of God in his
[1:27:15] life, it's an actual personal experience
[1:27:18] of the spirit of God indwelling him and
[1:27:21] his mind is illuminated by the wisdom
[1:27:24] and the knowledge of God through the
[1:27:26] word. Now, I'll say this to you tonight.
[1:27:28] Satan hates the thought of there being a
[1:27:31] people in the land with the perfect
[1:27:33] revelation of who God is and his love
[1:27:36] for them and that he is a rewarder. The
[1:27:40] devil, that's the devil's greatest
[1:27:42] nightmare is there's again another
[1:27:44] people in the land who's not moved by
[1:27:47] feelings. They're not moved by emotions.
[1:27:50] They're not moved by problems, but
[1:27:52] they're moved by perfect revelation that
[1:27:54] God loves them. Well, I don't know. I
[1:27:57] feel like stopping here and shouting for
[1:27:59] about five minutes. God loves me. Hey, I
[1:28:02] don't know about y'all, but that makes
[1:28:04] me want to dance all around to think
[1:28:06] that God who hung the moon, who created
[1:28:09] the universe, that he loves this old
[1:28:11] piece of Tennessee dirt and he would
[1:28:13] reveal himself to me and he would fill
[1:28:15] me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:18] Listen, I don't know how bad of a day
[1:28:19] you're having and how dark of a trial
[1:28:21] and situation you're in, but why don't
[1:28:23] you tonight let the love of God strike
[1:28:25] your soul and put some confidence in
[1:28:28] there that God loves you.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He loves you.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; God loves you.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not worthy. He loves you
[1:28:40] anyhow.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I made a mistake. He loves you
[1:28:45] anyhow.
[1:28:48] Well, I messed up. He loves you anyhow.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what the Bible says.
[1:28:53] The Bible says, "Be strong, therefore,
[1:28:55] and let not your hands be weak, for your
[1:28:58] work shall be rewarded."
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; You know what David said? He said, "The
[1:29:04] Lord rewarded me according to my
[1:29:06] righteousness."
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. According to the cleanness of my
[1:29:12] hands, hath he recompense me. I love
[1:29:15] Psalms 103 and10. Brother Brother Jolie
[1:29:18] says this, "He hath not dealt with us
[1:29:20] after our sins."
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Nor rewarded us according to our
[1:29:27] iniquities.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; For as the heaven is high above the
[1:29:32] earth, so great is his mercy toward them
[1:29:36] that fear him. Now, come on, church. As
[1:29:39] far as the east is from the west, so far
[1:29:43] hath he removed our transgressions from
[1:29:47] us.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 13:13, "Who so despiseth the
[1:29:52] word shall be destroyed, but he that
[1:29:55] fearth the commandment shall be
[1:29:58] rewarded."
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I love what Jesus said. He said,
[1:30:02] "Blessed are ye when men shall revile
[1:30:04] you and persecute you and shall say all
[1:30:08] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:30:10] my sake. Rejoice."
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I know that's a heavy one cuz we're
[1:30:16] all humans.
[1:30:18] Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[1:30:22] is your reward in heaven.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; For so persecuted they the prophets
[1:30:28] which were before you. I love what the
[1:30:30] prophet says. He said, "The church will
[1:30:32] never know the labor and the weary and
[1:30:35] the tall and the trials that's tried to
[1:30:38] break it, the message, but he does."
[1:30:40] Now, listen to a prophet. But my reward
[1:30:43] doesn't come from people.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Well, that makes me want to shout
[1:30:47] hallelujah cuz you'll give and give and
[1:30:50] give and people turn around and spit in
[1:30:52] your face. But I'm not going to quit
[1:30:54] giving and I'm not going to quit working
[1:30:56] cuz I'm not working for an earthly
[1:30:58] reward but my father which is in heaven.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Come on. Y'all know what
[1:31:06] I'm talking about. Amen. You'll give and
[1:31:08] give and give and do and do and do. And
[1:31:10] the more you do, the less appreciated.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what the Bible says. The
[1:31:16] Bible says, "Whatsoever a man seweth,
[1:31:18] that shall he also reap."
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I tell you what a prophet said. He said,
[1:31:22] "You reap what you sow." That's God's
[1:31:24] law.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, you say, "Well, can't we
[1:31:28] backslide?" Absolutely. And when you
[1:31:30] backslide, you're going to get it. Don't
[1:31:32] you worry.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Abraham got it
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; and the rest of them got it. And you'll
[1:31:40] get it. Don't you think it gives you a
[1:31:43] right to sin?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You'll pay for everything you do.
[1:31:51] Now, come on, church.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You will reap what you sow.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; You do. Now, this is a prophet. You do
[1:31:58] one little sin and you'll reap a whole
[1:32:01] wash tub full.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. But, brother, that don't
[1:32:08] mean to say that you're lost.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Give me some shout
[1:32:13] room. That's exactly right. Abraham
[1:32:16] reaped exactly what he sowed. That's
[1:32:18] right. But he was still saved.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the love of God. I'm
[1:32:27] talking about the perfect revelation.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, Job. You're on the ash heap and
[1:32:34] the perfect revelation. Love of God is
[1:32:37] speaking out of you in that you can say,
[1:32:39] "Though he slay me, yet I will trust
[1:32:42] him."
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Now, I know we we always use that in the
[1:32:46] negative. Well, you're going to reap
[1:32:47] what you sow. But but come on. I I don't
[1:32:48] think we ought to leave in the negative.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I know people reap negative because they
[1:32:54] sow negative.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; But brother Ed, I believe there's a
[1:32:57] positive.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; I believe if a person can sow negative
[1:33:00] and reap negative, I believe another
[1:33:03] person can sow positive
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; and can reap positive. See, the Bible
[1:33:08] says, "Let us not be weary and welloing
[1:33:11] for in due season we shall reap if we
[1:33:14] faint not."
[1:33:16] Brother said, "That's my attitude all
[1:33:18] along. I want to go out of this world
[1:33:20] with that same attitude, knowing that
[1:33:23] someday I shall receive a reward if I
[1:33:27] can only be faithful."
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Until that time when the rewards are
[1:33:34] given.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet says? He said,
[1:33:37] "The reward of the just awaits for each
[1:33:42] believer.
[1:33:44] Hallelujah.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Can I read you another fifth seal? He
[1:33:47] said, "And the God of heaven rewards you
[1:33:50] for your stand for him."
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Well, that makes me want to just stop
[1:33:57] and dance.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all don't realize it, but
[1:34:01] you're reaping the benefits of the stand
[1:34:04] that you took for God.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:34:10] Mariah's got a sign in the hallway and
[1:34:12] every day I go by and look at it, it
[1:34:14] always it always speaks to my heart.
[1:34:16] There's a sign hangs there and it says,
[1:34:17] "I remember the days I prayed for the
[1:34:19] things that I have now."
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; But do you realize when we get in the
[1:34:23] middle of the things that we were
[1:34:24] praying for, we forget that there was a
[1:34:27] reward to those.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. I'm going to
[1:34:31] preach. Amen. There's a reward for
[1:34:33] self-sacrifice.
[1:34:37] There
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; there's a reward for crucifying your
[1:34:39] flesh sometimes. There's a reward coming
[1:34:42] to it.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, it's hard right
[1:34:44] now." But can you hear me? There's a
[1:34:46] reward coming.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; See, I love how the prophet God does
[1:34:50] this. He takes time to clearly and
[1:34:53] emphatically establish to the church
[1:34:55] that God rewards faith.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; God don't reward works. God rewards
[1:35:01] faith.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; And faith is a revelation. Now, you all
[1:35:05] know in Genesis 4, there was two boys
[1:35:07] named Cain and Abel, right?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You know, the pro of God said Cain laid
[1:35:11] his sacrifice down.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, he knelt down on his
[1:35:15] knees and raised up his hands.
[1:35:18] Can I go on?
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "I can hear his beautiful
[1:35:22] prayer. Oh, how he rhymed it out just so
[1:35:26] in order and everything trying to find
[1:35:30] favor with Jehovah." Here's what he
[1:35:32] said. Here is the works I brought and
[1:35:35] laid down. I've built this church. I've
[1:35:39] done these things. I've worked hard. And
[1:35:42] here's a part of what I've got. I lay
[1:35:45] here. I offer to you Jehovah. Can I find
[1:35:50] favor? See, he wasn't an infidel. He was
[1:35:54] a fundamentalist.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Can I go on?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; But God through election.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:02] But God through election, he said that
[1:36:05] shakes you down. It was through election
[1:36:08] that God called Abel and had recompense
[1:36:11] to the reward. Here was Abel then all up
[1:36:14] there just not very much to look at. He
[1:36:16] just had a big old rock lamb. He was
[1:36:18] beaten and just a life out of it. A
[1:36:20] bleeding that little lamb. But what was
[1:36:22] it speaking on? Abel had foresight. He
[1:36:26] was born of Adam which was a son of God.
[1:36:29] Oh, can I say what a prophet said? And
[1:36:32] the church today that is born of Christ,
[1:36:35] the son of God, has the foresight and
[1:36:38] the recompense to the reward that's
[1:36:40] going to come.
[1:36:43] I wish I was a preacher right now.
[1:36:45] Hallelujah. Amen. Cain was laying
[1:36:48] everything just right, doing everything
[1:36:50] just perfect. He was trying to work and
[1:36:53] get a reward, but here was his little
[1:36:55] Pentecostal
[1:36:56] holy roller brother. And he come
[1:36:59] dragging a lamb in the temple. and he
[1:37:01] laid a rock upon his neck and he be to
[1:37:03] beef that lamb.
[1:37:06] Do you know what he never done? He never
[1:37:08] asked God to give him favor. He never
[1:37:11] asked God to show him favor because his
[1:37:15] revelation.
[1:37:18] Hallelujah.
[1:37:22] Can I just tell you like I'm wanting to
[1:37:24] say it?
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to ask God to bless you.
[1:37:27] Just start worshiping him. That's right.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to ask God to move. Just
[1:37:33] start praising him. He said that don't
[1:37:36] care what the world says, how old
[1:37:38] fashioned we're called. He was looking
[1:37:40] at what God said. We don't look at the
[1:37:42] things that go on so much temporarily
[1:37:44] now.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; But we look at the end of the road
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; where the rewards are given.
[1:37:55] Yes, sir.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Now, y'all y'all got to y'all got to
[1:37:59] give me some liberty here, cuz
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; there were four lepers sitting by the
[1:38:04] gate.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Do you know Syria was besieged?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Do you know it was so bad that mamas
[1:38:11] were bullying and eating their own
[1:38:13] babies?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know that leprosy broke out and
[1:38:16] there were four lepers
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; sitting by the gate? And the prophet of
[1:38:21] God said, they looked at each other and
[1:38:23] they said, "If we sit here, we're going
[1:38:25] to die. If we get up and go, we're going
[1:38:29] to die." So, you know what they said?
[1:38:31] They said, "Why sit we here
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; until we die?" And the prophet of God
[1:38:36] said, "And by now, now come on."
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; They didn't have four legs to walk on.
[1:38:43] They didn't have Come on. They didn't
[1:38:44] have Sorry. They didn't have two legs
[1:38:45] and two arms to crawl on. Maybe one of
[1:38:48] them was missing an arm. Maybe one of
[1:38:50] them was missing a leg. Oh god. Y'all
[1:38:53] imagine a leper sitting there and
[1:38:56] everything around him is dying. The
[1:38:58] whole atmosphere is a feel of death. And
[1:39:00] all of a sudden he comes to church on a
[1:39:03] Wednesday night.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Where you going? I'm going down there in
[1:39:10] the name of the Lord.
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. They didn't shout down there.
[1:39:15] They didn't. Some of them probably had
[1:39:18] to get on one leg and hop all the way
[1:39:20] down there cause leprosy and taken their
[1:39:23] other leg. But when they got down there,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; God didn't reward their works. He
[1:39:28] rewarded their faith. And the prophet of
[1:39:31] God said he didn't just save them. He
[1:39:33] saved all of Israel.
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; See, they only had one chance. Reb said
[1:39:43] this. He said, "Let's go down to the
[1:39:45] colony of the Syrians, the enemy." Can I
[1:39:48] Can I just say what a prophet said? He
[1:39:50] said, "And God rewarded them for taking
[1:39:53] that only chance they had."
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Now, now you all know blind Barnameus.
[1:40:03] He sat by the by the highway side
[1:40:05] begging. Jesus walked by. He said, "What
[1:40:08] would you have that I might receive my
[1:40:11] sight, Lord?"
[1:40:12] and he looked around to him and said,
[1:40:14] "Thy faith has saved thee." He never
[1:40:16] said, "Now, I know you're going to be
[1:40:18] well." He just said, "Your faith has
[1:40:21] saved you."
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Are y'all Are y'all open for this
[1:40:24] tonight?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; He knew that if that man respected the
[1:40:29] gift of God in that measure.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; That God would be obligated to reward
[1:40:35] him of his faith.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, there you are. He come with a
[1:40:41] full heart.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus knowed what he was coming for.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus knowed what he was looking for.
[1:40:53] Brother Noah, this is the one that blows
[1:40:55] my mind. He knew the depths of his
[1:40:59] faith.
[1:41:01] Hallelujah.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, God knew the depths of
[1:41:07] Barnameus's faith.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And he looked at him and said, "Thy
[1:41:10] faith has saved thee."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; See, brother B said this beautiful. He
[1:41:15] said, "Now we're compassed about with
[1:41:17] such a great cloud of witnesses." He
[1:41:19] said, 'Now if we see what God did back
[1:41:21] there to those people upon certain
[1:41:24] attitudes that they taken towards God
[1:41:27] and then if we find out if we'll take
[1:41:29] the same attitude they did, we will
[1:41:31] receive the same reward they did.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; So you mean your attitude
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; is connected to your reward?
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; You can just expect because God never
[1:41:45] changes. He's just the same. Now I got I
[1:41:48] got to say everything he said.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; His blessings is the same. Yes,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Can I go on?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And his penalties is the same.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I just got to say it. There is a
[1:42:00] recompense of reward for obedience.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And there's there's a recompense of
[1:42:06] reward for disobedience.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Burb said should look here. The Old
[1:42:10] Testament was a shadow of the New
[1:42:11] Testament to come. And if I see how God
[1:42:14] dealt with men there, I see how God will
[1:42:16] deal with men over here. I see what kind
[1:42:19] of a recompense of reward for
[1:42:21] disobedience, I know what it'll be over
[1:42:23] here. Now,
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I say that because because sometimes we
[1:42:27] get in our mind that that that taking a
[1:42:30] stand or or or or doing something, amen,
[1:42:33] is is going to is is too costly. But but
[1:42:35] but brother and I just I was just stud
[1:42:39] my my life story. And if you ever get
[1:42:41] time to go home and listen to it, it's a
[1:42:42] powerful one. 1951 nail near the end
[1:42:45] that brother Bam just breaks down and
[1:42:46] starts crying. He said, "I put down all
[1:42:48] the invitations." He's talking about
[1:42:49] when he first went among the
[1:42:50] Pentecostals and he's talking about how
[1:42:52] they were welcoming him and they were,
[1:42:54] "Oh, we got you this pullpit and we got
[1:42:55] you this place." And he said, "I put
[1:42:57] down all the invitations." And he said,
[1:42:59] "I hurried home to my wife and when she
[1:43:01] come to meet me, I told her about these
[1:43:02] happy people." And she said, "Oh, Billy,
[1:43:05] I would like to have that experience."
[1:43:07] Said, "Well, they call it," I said,
[1:43:08] "Well, it's a baptism of the Holy
[1:43:09] Spirit." I said let us go find Jesus
[1:43:11] like that. So we did and we both
[1:43:14] received the blessing. So I was going to
[1:43:16] leave then to go on to evangelistic
[1:43:18] work. So we went to tell our parents.
[1:43:20] Now watch. Now I told he said now her
[1:43:22] mother was a refined type of woman
[1:43:24] belonged to a great big church. She said
[1:43:26] now Billy them people are nothing but
[1:43:28] trash. There's nothing to them. You stay
[1:43:31] away from them. I don't want my girl
[1:43:33] around them. I said oh but they were
[1:43:36] real. She said no. And I said, "I
[1:43:39] believe they are." And my wife started
[1:43:41] crying. He said, "And there's where I
[1:43:43] made my fatal mistake."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I I know this is heavy for deity
[1:43:48] people, but we got to say what he said.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "I listened to my mother-in-law
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; instead of God
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; and forsaken the church and went on back
[1:43:59] with the Baptist people and right away
[1:44:02] plagues hit my home. My wife took sick.
[1:44:04] My father died on my arm. My brother was
[1:44:06] killed. And everything happened just in
[1:44:09] a few days. A great flood hit the
[1:44:11] country and washed away the home. My
[1:44:13] wife was in the hospital. I was out on a
[1:44:15] rescue with my boat. And one night out
[1:44:17] in the water, my boat got in the current
[1:44:19] and was going over a big falls and I
[1:44:20] couldn't get the motor started. And I
[1:44:22] raised up my hands and I said, "Oh God,
[1:44:24] don't let me drown. I'm not worthy to
[1:44:26] live, but think of my wife and baby."
[1:44:28] And I tried again and it was start. And
[1:44:30] I cried again to God. And then just
[1:44:32] before going over the falls, the motor
[1:44:35] started and I got to land. Now come on,
[1:44:37] church. You sow a little sin, you're
[1:44:40] going to reap a whole wash tub full.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; But he was still saved
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; now. Now, now come on, church. You can't
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You can't sew bad seed
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden think there's
[1:44:59] not going to be a harvest.
[1:45:02] When the harvest comes, you can't lose
[1:45:06] your confidence.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. What if he would have threw up
[1:45:10] his hands right there and said, "I give
[1:45:12] up, Lord. I know why my boat won't
[1:45:14] start. I know why my wife's laying down
[1:45:16] there. I know why the church is falling
[1:45:18] apart. I know why all these things are
[1:45:20] happening. It's cuz I listen to my
[1:45:21] mother-in-law instead of listening to
[1:45:23] God." You know what he done? He just he
[1:45:25] just hunkered down and he said, "I'm
[1:45:27] going to believe God. I'm going to trust
[1:45:29] God." and he threw up his hands and he
[1:45:31] said, "Lord, I know I'm not worthy, but
[1:45:34] would you start this boat and God who is
[1:45:36] rich in mercy,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; came on the scene?"
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Let me tell you, there
[1:45:44] is a recompense of reward to
[1:45:46] disobedience. But if there's a
[1:45:48] recompense of reward to disobedience,
[1:45:52] then what about obedience? I love in in
[1:45:55] First Kings 17, you know what the Bible
[1:45:57] says? The Bible says there was a widow
[1:45:59] woman and there was a famine struck the
[1:46:01] land. And the Bible says that God sent
[1:46:03] his prophet Elijah and said unto her,
[1:46:06] "Fear not. Go and do as thou has said,
[1:46:09] but make me a little cake first, and
[1:46:11] bring it unto me, and make for thee and
[1:46:13] for thy son." Now, I love verse 14. For
[1:46:17] thus sayith the Lord God of Israel, the
[1:46:19] barrel of meal shall not waste. Neither
[1:46:22] shall the crus of oil fail until the day
[1:46:26] that the Lord sendeth rain
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; upon the earth.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Now, brother says, "It beautiful." He
[1:46:32] said, "She sought the kingdom of God
[1:46:34] first."
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz she walked in God's
[1:46:37] provided way
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; and God rewarded her.
[1:46:41] if they're willing to walk with him
[1:46:43] through the tolls and snares of life and
[1:46:45] be an honor to him, he was going to
[1:46:47] reward them because he is not forgetful
[1:46:50] of our labor of love. Now, I want to I
[1:46:53] want to say this to you and I want to
[1:46:54] say it very plain. We have seen in this
[1:46:56] day the vindicated manifestation
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; of the power of God and I I just want to
[1:47:02] say it and I want to I want to make it
[1:47:03] very plain how you approach it because
[1:47:05] of where it's coming from. Somebody say
[1:47:07] how
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; how you approach it because of where.
[1:47:10] Somebody say where
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; it's coming from depends on the reward
[1:47:15] you get.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Rebraham said now I'm just going to read
[1:47:19] a few to you here so don't go to sleep.
[1:47:22] Somebody else say brother Brandon I've
[1:47:23] been to church but never did I see the
[1:47:24] Bible made real like that. There's got
[1:47:26] to be something you know that's
[1:47:27] something doing that. Now it depends on
[1:47:30] what you think it is. If you want to say
[1:47:32] it's be elabub then go ahead. That'll be
[1:47:34] between you and God. But if you believe
[1:47:36] it's Jesus Christ, then God will reward
[1:47:39] you for it. You'll either be cursed by
[1:47:42] it or you'll be blessed by it. Either
[1:47:44] which one you want to be. It's up to
[1:47:46] you. Here's another one. Now, if Jesus
[1:47:48] will come and just take this body, my
[1:47:50] voice, now remember Jesus is in every
[1:47:54] way like he was only a corporal body.
[1:47:58] Do you understand that? What are we? He
[1:48:01] is the vine. We are the branches. The
[1:48:02] vine doesn't bear the fruit. The
[1:48:03] branches bear the fruit. But the energy
[1:48:05] has to come from the vine. The vine has
[1:48:08] to send forth the power to bear the
[1:48:10] fruit. Now if he has risen from the
[1:48:12] dead, which we know he is. And then if
[1:48:15] God sent me to do this, I'm not a
[1:48:16] preacher as a preacher, but it's by
[1:48:18] gift. If he lets me see visions and say
[1:48:20] this woman is like that woman at the
[1:48:21] well and will reveal to me something
[1:48:23] that's in your heart and that you're
[1:48:24] wanting, would you believe it was him?
[1:48:26] You know it have to come from some
[1:48:27] supernatural resource. How many knows
[1:48:29] that?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Now if you believe that, it depends on
[1:48:32] what you think it is.
[1:48:35] Now, if you're here for some need and
[1:48:36] you say, "I'm sick. I have some
[1:48:38] disease." And I tell you why. The Lord's
[1:48:40] going to heal you. You could doubt that.
[1:48:43] See, you wouldn't know whether my words
[1:48:45] was right or not there. But if the Lord
[1:48:48] will tell you something that you know I
[1:48:50] know nothing about, then you know that
[1:48:51] has to come from the supernatural power.
[1:48:53] Well, you can say, "Well, the devil told
[1:48:55] him that," then you get the devil's
[1:48:57] reward.
[1:48:59] But if you say the Lord told him that,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; then you get the Lord's reward.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Now it's done by her. It'll be to you
[1:49:07] just the same. I have no idea what's
[1:49:09] wrong with a woman. I have no idea, but
[1:49:11] God does. Here's another one. This great
[1:49:14] God and father we're speaking of is not
[1:49:16] something that was. Are I'm closing
[1:49:18] right here. He's not something that was.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; He's something that is.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're going to get the
[1:49:27] reward, you've got to believe that God
[1:49:30] is.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; He's not just a God that was. He is a
[1:49:34] God that is. And if he by his people who
[1:49:37] are called by his name will get up past
[1:49:40] that barrier of what the world's got to
[1:49:41] say, what the church has got to say,
[1:49:44] what the science has got to say, and
[1:49:46] look to what God has to say, that minute
[1:49:49] you will pass the vibration of unbelief,
[1:49:52] and you will go free.
[1:49:55] Yes, sir.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; If you can pass what the world has got
[1:49:59] to say, if you can pass what the church
[1:50:02] has got to say, if you can pass what
[1:50:05] science has got to say, that's the
[1:50:07] minute you'll go free out of this
[1:50:09] building tonight just as happy as you
[1:50:11] can be. You'll be serving God. You'll be
[1:50:14] feeling free. Your sins are all gone and
[1:50:17] you're healed from your sickness. Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is here
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; and will reward you
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; if you will believe.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Re said this. Get the people to
[1:50:32] believe.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Get the people to believe. Not even
[1:50:37] cancer.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Now, folks, it took a prophet to stand
[1:50:42] there and say this.
[1:50:44] Now, without a shadow of a doubt, I can
[1:50:48] prove infallibly if you'll believe me,
[1:50:51] it'll leave you. Now,
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; folks, let's bring that out of the realm
[1:50:58] of sickness.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's let's let's bring that
[1:51:04] out of the realm of the first and second
[1:51:05] pool.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Let's bring it right into the realm of
[1:51:08] our lives.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; We're not in a prayer line tonight.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not calling people up
[1:51:14] trying to discern situations. That's
[1:51:15] right.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; But there's spirits that need to be
[1:51:18] broke right now.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not ignorant.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; There's spirits that need to be broke
[1:51:24] right now.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; And if you can believe
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; If you can believe the word I'm
[1:51:30] preaching, it'll break that spirit.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. I tell you why you don't want
[1:51:35] to break it. Cuz you love
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Well, you pushed. I'm going to preach.
[1:51:38] You love that spirit and you harbor that
[1:51:41] thing. And you'd rather pet that thing
[1:51:43] around than destroy it because it gives
[1:51:45] you a little security blanket. But why
[1:51:47] don't you destroy that thing before you
[1:51:49] sew a field full of seed?
[1:51:53] Come on. I know what I'm talking about.
[1:51:55] Amen. That little gossiping devil,
[1:51:57] destroy that thing. That little
[1:51:59] bitterness, devil, destroy that thing.
[1:52:02] That little unforgiven spirit, destroy
[1:52:04] that thing.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm not a crazy man. I think
[1:52:09] it's time to take our position as the
[1:52:11] sons and daughters of God. I think it's
[1:52:13] time to stand up in the faith of God
[1:52:16] with the word of God and tell that
[1:52:18] devil, Satan, I refuse to sew another
[1:52:22] seed like this.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. Amen. I know when I'm this
[1:52:28] close to it, I might as well preach.
[1:52:29] Amen. I know what happens is we get so
[1:52:32] settled down and we get so comfortable.
[1:52:34] Amen. The prophet of God said this. He
[1:52:36] said, "But if you can believe right now,
[1:52:38] the unseen Christ is standing amongst us
[1:52:41] here now to reward your faith."
[1:52:45] I'm telling you tonight, Grace
[1:52:46] Tabernacle, Brother Ben, the unseen
[1:52:49] Christ is right here in this building
[1:52:52] tonight. And he's here to reward your
[1:52:55] faith.
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:58] Hey, I'm not going to back up to that
[1:52:59] devil right now cuz I refuse to let some
[1:53:02] little devil hijack the atmosphere of
[1:53:05] Grace Tabernacle. I refuse to let some
[1:53:07] little ill feeling or some little hurt
[1:53:10] word rob atmosphere of the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:12] You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind.
[1:53:14] I'm a part of the Joshua generation and
[1:53:17] I got a right to walk around this
[1:53:18] building and say I serve eviction notice
[1:53:21] on every spirit that's unlike the Holy
[1:53:24] Spirit and I call for the faith of God
[1:53:27] to be instilled in the hearts of God's
[1:53:29] children and say, "Satan, it's enough.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Break that thing.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Break it."
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Well, well, that's the way I am. Break
[1:53:42] it. Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way my mom was. Break
[1:53:47] it.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You're anointed to break it.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You said, "Preacher, you lost your
[1:53:53] mind." No, I hadn't. I ain't got to lay
[1:53:55] hands on you right now. You can believe
[1:53:57] the word I'm preaching, and you can
[1:53:59] break that thing that's been following
[1:54:01] you for years.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. You can break that thing that's
[1:54:05] been following you for years.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm I'm just going to preach.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; You can break it right now. Some of you
[1:54:13] men can break that spirit that's got you
[1:54:16] so paralyzed that you can't even lead in
[1:54:18] your home no more because some little
[1:54:20] devil's told you that you're being too
[1:54:22] dominated. That's a lying devil from the
[1:54:24] pits of hell. Break that spirit in the
[1:54:26] name of God and rise above it and put
[1:54:29] your foot on it and say there's a reward
[1:54:32] coming. There's a harvest coming.
[1:54:36] Oh, amen. That little temper that you
[1:54:38] love, why don't you let the Holy Ghost
[1:54:39] break that thing tonight? that little
[1:54:41] temper that's run you since a kid. Why
[1:54:43] don't you let the Holy Ghost break it
[1:54:45] tonight?
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; If you believe he's in the building to
[1:54:50] break it,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; folks, I got hundreds of them here.
[1:54:53] Sorry, probably 40. I'm not going to
[1:54:55] read them all to you. Come on,
[1:54:56] musicians, but I can stand here and read
[1:54:58] you for hours where a prophet stood
[1:55:00] there and said, "That's a spirit. That's
[1:55:02] a spirit. It's following your life. It's
[1:55:05] following you. It's trying to take you
[1:55:06] to a premature grave. But if you'll
[1:55:08] believe me, it'll leave you right now.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Believe the word
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; and watch the word break it.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand to your feet tonight?
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Satan's after it. Satan's after your
[1:55:23] confidence.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; He's trying to take it out of you.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Because he knows there's a reward coming
[1:55:28] to it.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[1:55:33] No, I hadn't lost my mind. We don't walk
[1:55:36] by sight. We walk by faith.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And I I I just I just tell you tonight,
[1:55:41] Prophet God said, "You don't go into
[1:55:42] heaven by speaking in tongues."
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "You go into heaven by keeping
[1:55:47] every word."
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the evidence of the
[1:55:49] Holy Ghost when you believe the word of
[1:55:51] God."
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Can I I I'm out of time, but I'm just
[1:55:55] going I'm just going to say what a
[1:55:56] prophet said. He said, "You say we'll
[1:55:58] speak with tongues and then refuse to be
[1:56:00] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:56:01] something wrong somewhere."
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, indeed. any of those things, any of
[1:56:04] those orders God give, there's something
[1:56:06] wrong. Just search your own conscience
[1:56:08] and see what the Bible said. Show me
[1:56:09] some place where somebody was baptized
[1:56:11] in the name of the father, son, holy
[1:56:13] ghost. See, it's not there. But you see,
[1:56:15] sometimes for your conscience sake, you
[1:56:17] say, "Well, you say God speaks to the
[1:56:19] woman. God speaks to the women about how
[1:56:21] they must do and not wear shorts and
[1:56:22] things." But you know the pastor said,
[1:56:24] you know what a prophet of God said? He
[1:56:26] said, "So they take the easy way."
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; They take the easy way, brother David.
[1:56:32] Come on.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm not a crazy man tonight, but
[1:56:38] I am a Holy Ghost fil preacher. How many
[1:56:40] more services are you going to keep
[1:56:41] taking the easy way around that spirit?
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Huh? How many more days, Listen, I'm not
[1:56:47] I'm not playing right now. How many more
[1:56:49] days are you going to keep taking the
[1:56:50] easy way around that thing when you have
[1:56:52] been anointed to destroy it?
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Well, it's just the way I am and it's
[1:56:59] just No, it's a devil.
[1:57:01] It's a devil trying to destroy you and
[1:57:04] destroy your future because that devil
[1:57:06] knows there's a reward coming.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to take the easy
[1:57:12] way. You know what a prophet said? He
[1:57:14] said, "Listen, I stand there in Tucson
[1:57:16] preaching one night. This is your own
[1:57:17] prophet." Stand there preaching. Danny
[1:57:19] Henry spoke up, began to speak in
[1:57:21] tongues. Said, he said, "Brother
[1:57:23] Brandom, I hope this don't sound
[1:57:24] sacriiggious, but that could be the 23rd
[1:57:26] chapter of Revelation."
[1:57:28] And when he started to say something, he
[1:57:30] started speaking in tongues. Now, three
[1:57:32] people wrote it down. And he said, "All
[1:57:34] three wrote the note was the same
[1:57:36] interpretation." And it said this,
[1:57:39] "Because thou has chosen this harder
[1:57:41] way. You've chose it. You have took
[1:57:45] chose it by your own choosing." Of
[1:57:47] course, we know that Moses had to make
[1:57:48] his choice. Said, "This is the precise
[1:57:52] and the correct way
[1:57:55] because it's my way." And what a
[1:57:57] glorious decision you've made. Because
[1:58:01] of this, a large portion of heaven
[1:58:04] awaits you.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; And this in itself is that which will
[1:58:11] make and bring to pass the tremendous
[1:58:15] victory
[1:58:16] in the love divine.
[1:58:19] Listen,
[1:58:21] get mad at me if you want to. There's no
[1:58:23] reward coming to those that take the
[1:58:25] easy way.
[1:58:28] There's no reward.
[1:58:30] But to those that will step out and say,
[1:58:32] "Devil, we're through."
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Devil, you've hit you. You you you have
[1:58:38] you have bound my life with this as long
[1:58:40] as you're going to bind me.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Today, devil
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; now, a prophet of God, folks, had to
[1:58:48] take that route.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; He had to step out in a in a hard way.
[1:58:53] Now listen, I'm not You all You all know
[1:58:55] me tonight. I normally don't preach like
[1:58:58] this, but there's a great reward laying
[1:59:01] ahead of you. There's a victory ahead of
[1:59:04] you. Are you going to keep dodging that
[1:59:06] little spirit and dodging this issue?
[1:59:08] And are you just going to face it?
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, we're through. Devil, I'm
[1:59:14] done with you. I'm done with your lies.
[1:59:15] I'm done with your stories. I'm done
[1:59:17] with your excuses. Devil, we're through.
[1:59:20] I'm going to march forward in a great
[1:59:22] victory in love divine.
[1:59:25] You say, "Preacher, you you you lost
[1:59:27] your mind." No, I hadn't. It was in a
[1:59:30] meeting like this one night. I was
[1:59:31] preaching on a Wednesday night and there
[1:59:32] was a man sitting there and he was
[1:59:34] holding his baby and I got to preaching
[1:59:36] on the statue of a perfect man on
[1:59:38] temper. And I said, "That temper
[1:59:40] controlled your daddy. It controlled you
[1:59:41] and it's trying to control that child."
[1:59:43] I didn't have a clue who I was talking
[1:59:44] to. I was just preaching, Sister Cindy.
[1:59:46] And when I said that, that man come
[1:59:48] running out of the back of that church
[1:59:49] down the altar. And he just knelt down
[1:59:51] and began to pray. And I went over and
[1:59:53] laid my hand on him. And as I began to
[1:59:54] pray, the power of God began to fall on
[1:59:56] me. I didn't know what I was praying
[1:59:58] for. Two weeks later, I went back to
[2:00:00] that church. And he wrote a testimony
[2:00:02] and hung it up on the bulletin board and
[2:00:04] said, "I had a temper that my
[2:00:05] grandfather had, my father had." He
[2:00:07] said, "I had it." He said, "And that
[2:00:09] day, Brother Andrew was preaching that."
[2:00:10] He said, "I saw that thing raise its
[2:00:12] head up in my kid that day playing." And
[2:00:14] he said, "I realized if I don't kill it
[2:00:16] now, it's going on into my child. If I
[2:00:19] don't stop it now, it's going on into my
[2:00:21] child." And he said, "I got down to
[2:00:23] business with God." And he said, "I
[2:00:25] killed that thing." And he said, "I can
[2:00:26] raise my hands and say, "Praise God, I'm
[2:00:29] free of it." That same God is right here
[2:00:33] in this building tonight. Why don't you
[2:00:35] draw your sword and kill that devil
[2:00:38] tonight? Kill that devil in the name of
[2:00:40] Jesus. You ain't got to let that thing
[2:00:42] run you around. Kill it tonight
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Brother Matt,
[2:00:47] would you come?
[2:00:52] There is power
[2:00:55] in the name of Jesus.

[2:02:52] There is power

[2:14:17] You can take
[2:14:20] away
[2:14:22] the vision
[2:14:26] of these eyes
[2:14:29] that I
[2:14:31] see.
[2:14:34] You can deprive
[2:14:37] me of
[2:14:39] the food
[2:14:41] that I eat.
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:46] by
[2:14:48] my hands and my feet.
[2:14:52] Oh, but as long
[2:14:54] as I know Jesus,
[2:15:00] I know that I I can still
[2:15:06] go free.
[2:15:08] And I say that I
[2:15:12] can still
[2:15:14] go free.
[2:15:19] And what kind
[2:15:21] of man
[2:15:23] would reach down
[2:15:27] and do this for me?
[2:15:33] I'm so unworthy
[2:15:36] to live.
[2:15:38] did not fear
[2:15:40] to kill, but did a man on the cross. He
[2:15:46] wrote my name
[2:15:49] in his
[2:15:51] and said that I
[2:15:53] could still
[2:15:55] go free
[2:16:01] ever could quite
[2:16:04] understand
[2:16:06] this one.
[2:16:08] Tell me why a king
[2:16:10] would ever leave
[2:16:13] his throne.
[2:16:17] to put on
[2:16:19] the robe
[2:16:21] of an earthly
[2:16:24] man and feel the pain
[2:16:28] of flesh
[2:16:30] and bone.
[2:16:34] him to later
[2:16:36] walk down
[2:16:39] and lonely
[2:16:41] path
[2:16:43] and liary.
[2:16:51] Oh, but the blood
[2:16:54] he shed inside my pardon.
[2:16:58] It red and said that I can still
[2:17:05] go free.
[2:17:07] When I say that I
[2:17:11] can still
[2:17:13] go free.
[2:17:16] Tell me what kind of man
[2:17:22] would reach down his hand
[2:17:26] and do this for me.
[2:17:32] I'm so worthy
[2:17:34] to live.
[2:17:37] It not fit to kill.
[2:17:41] did a man on the cross. He rolled my
[2:17:46] name
[2:17:47] in his will and said that I could still
[2:17:54] free. Can we sing that last verse one
[2:17:57] more time? Well, I never
[2:18:01] could
[2:18:03] understand
[2:18:05] this one thing. Tell me why a king would
[2:18:10] ever leave
[2:18:12] his throne.
[2:18:16] Just to put on
[2:18:18] the robe
[2:18:21] of an earthly
[2:18:23] man and fear the pain
[2:18:27] of fleshes
[2:18:30] and bound
[2:18:34] to lay
[2:18:36] down
[2:18:38] and love
[2:18:45] to
[2:18:46] Calary.
[2:18:50] Oh, but those blood red stains,
[2:18:55] they broke all of my chains and declare
[2:19:00] that I can still
[2:19:03] go free.
[2:19:06] When I say that I
[2:19:10] can still
[2:19:12] go through.
[2:19:15] Lord, tell me what kind
[2:19:18] of man
[2:19:20] would reach down
[2:19:23] his hand
[2:19:25] and do this for me.
[2:19:30] I'm so unworthy
[2:19:33] to leave,
[2:19:35] yet not fear to kill. But did a man on
[2:19:42] the cross, he put my name in his will
[2:19:48] and said that I
[2:19:51] can still
[2:19:52] go free.
[2:19:57] Amen. Won't you just give him a handful
[2:19:59] of praise tonight? Amen. Isn't he
[2:20:01] wonderful? Don't we have an awesome God
[2:20:04] tonight? How many say that God broke
[2:20:06] some chains in your life tonight? I
[2:20:08] believe that. at the preaching of the
[2:20:10] word of God.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil don't like that sound.
[2:20:14] The sound of chains breaking.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's something about it
[2:20:18] tonight. And say, "What's it sound
[2:20:19] like?" I'll tell you what it sound like.
[2:20:21] It sound like these sisters up at the
[2:20:23] altar with their hands raised and crying
[2:20:25] out to God,
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; praising God. That's the sound of chains
[2:20:28] being broken. Amen. You love the Lord
[2:20:30] tonight. Amen. Won't you give him
[2:20:32] another hand clap of praise tonight?
[2:20:36] Well, God is my everything.
[2:20:41] God is my everything. Well, he's my
[2:20:46] hope.
[2:20:49] Yes, he's my joy.
[2:20:55] Well, he's my rock.
[2:21:00] Well, he's my shelter in a time of
[2:21:03] storm. Oh, well, God is
[2:21:08] Well, God is
[2:21:11] my everything.
[2:21:15] Well, God is
[2:21:18] my everything. Well, God is
[2:21:23] He's my everything. Well, he's my hope.
[2:21:30] Well, he's my joy.
[2:21:35] I said he's my rock.
[2:21:40] Well, he's my shelter in a time of
[2:21:44] storm.

[2:21:48] his God is
[2:21:51] my heavenly friend. Gracious heavenly
[2:21:54] father, Lord, how wonderful that you are
[2:21:57] tonight, Lord. God, you're so mindful of
[2:22:00] your children, Lord. God, you brought a
[2:22:02] word, Lord, that was a help to the
[2:22:04] church. And Lord, we're so thankful,
[2:22:06] God, that you would speak to our hearts.
[2:22:07] Lord, you knew exactly what we had need
[2:22:09] of. And Lord, I just thank you for
[2:22:11] Brother Andrew, Lord, being able to
[2:22:13] surrender to you tonight and allow you
[2:22:15] to use him. Lord, I pray that you would
[2:22:17] give him strength in his body, Lord, and
[2:22:19] knowing that he's been laboring, Lord,
[2:22:21] to have so many at home, Lord, and just
[2:22:25] burdens. Lord, I just pray that you
[2:22:26] would lift him up tonight, God. I pray
[2:22:28] that you would help him, Lord, and his
[2:22:30] family. God, I pray you would take each
[2:22:33] one as we leave this place, Lord. Bring
[2:22:34] us back in the house of God, Lord. May
[2:22:37] we be closer to you, Lord. Every
[2:22:38] service, Lord. That's our desire is to
[2:22:40] draw closer and closer unto you, Lord.
[2:22:43] We thank you once again, Lord. And we
[2:22:44] ask you to be with the people as we go.
[2:22:47] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[2:22:51] bless you tonight. Well, if the world
[2:22:53] from you withhold of its silver and its
[2:22:57] gold, and you have to get along with me
[2:23:00] or fair,
[2:23:03] just remember in his word how he feeds
[2:23:06] the little bird. Take your burdens to
[2:23:10] the Lord. Leave it there.
[2:23:13] Well, leave it there.
[2:23:16] Leave it there.
[2:23:18] Take your burden to the Lord and leave
[2:23:21] it there.

[2:23:27] surely bring you out. Take your burdens
[2:23:30] to the Lord and leave it there.
[2:23:33] Well, if your body suffers pain and your
[2:23:37] health you can't regain, but you know
[2:23:40] that God in heaven answers prayer.
[2:23:44] Well, Jesus knows the pain you feel. He
[2:23:47] can save and he can heal. Take your
[2:23:50] burdens to the Lord and leave it there.
