[38:07] rough day and I don't know what
[38:08] everybody's going through but the Lord
[38:10] knows tonight and amen I was just heing
[38:12] the prophet of God this week he was
[38:14] speaking in the sermon and there was a
[38:16] person come to the meeting they were
[38:17] blind and they were deaf and brother B
[38:20] said they never missed one service he
[38:22] said every service they was there and
[38:24] finally somebody went to them one time
[38:26] and they had however they could
[38:27] communicate with them they ask them why
[38:29] ever service are you here in the service
[38:31] when you can't hear you can't see you're
[38:33] in this condition and however they
[38:35] communicated back they let him know that
[38:37] they wanted the devil to know whose side
[38:40] they were on and you know I thought that
[38:41] was something amen there's not one of us
[38:44] tonight in that condition amen but we're
[38:46] here tonight no matter what we're going
[38:48] through to let the devil know whose side
[38:49] we're on Amen we're on The Winning Side
[38:52] tonight the prophet of God Called It the
[38:53] amen side and amen we're honored to be
[38:56] on his side tonight if you have your
[38:57] Bibles while you're standing with us we

[39:37] tonight and let's ask him to come by and
[39:39] send the spirit of Revelation in Among
[39:41] Us how many would say Lord reveal
[39:43] yourself to me tonight Heavenly Father
[39:45] Lord as we come before you on this
[39:47] Wednesday afternoon Lord as I stand here
[39:50] tonight behind this sacred desk once
[39:52] again Lord I'm very well aware that
[39:55] we're not here in this building by
[39:56] ourself but Lord there's an unseen
[39:59] Supernatural host in our midst that has
[40:01] come in this place tonight father to
[40:03] push back every Spirit to push back
[40:05] every enemy that would try to hinder
[40:07] your word as your Prophet has t us Lord
[40:10] that the word Goes Forth and the devil
[40:12] does everything he can to beset it he
[40:14] said but one believer is the majority in
[40:17] God and Lord as I look across this
[40:19] building tonight there's more than just
[40:21] one believer there's a whole church full
[40:23] of Believers here tonight that would
[40:24] come in one mind and one Accord then
[40:26] Lord we know that every devil is
[40:28] defeated Lord every spirit's power is
[40:30] broken father and Lord as we have sung
[40:33] the songs of Zion and the spirit of the
[40:35] worship has gone forth we're now
[40:37] inviting you to come and Lord may you be
[40:39] the speaker among us tonight oh God may
[40:41] you push my thoughts aside push Lord the
[40:44] things that Lord maybe that I've studied
[40:46] and looked at if it would not be what's
[40:47] on your mind or heart for this service
[40:49] I've done what I know to study and apply
[40:52] myself so Lord I surrender to you
[40:54] tonight Lord may you come and take
[40:56] control of the gift that you placed in
[40:58] our life father may you not just speak
[40:59] through me oh God but Lord may you hear
[41:02] through the Believers tonight Lord and
[41:03] father May the fertile ground of the
[41:05] heart tonight be Lord may it be
[41:07] cultivated Lord to father to prepare to
[41:10] receive the things that you have for us
[41:11] Lord now Lord we commit this meeting
[41:13] tonight in your faithful hands in the
[41:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[41:18] and all the Believers says am amen and
[41:21] amen the Book of Genesis the 19th
[41:23] Chapter and the first verse the Bible
[41:25] says there came two angels to Sodom at
[41:28] evening and lot sat in the gate of Sodom
[41:32] and lot seeing them rose up to meet them
[41:35] and he bowed himself with his face
[41:37] toward the ground now I want you to
[41:39] notice here that lot is entertaining
[41:41] these angels and I want you to notice
[41:43] where lot's sitting the Bible says he's
[41:45] sitting in the gate lot is sitting in
[41:48] the gate of Sodom now if we go back to
[41:50] Genesis 18 just one chapter over Genesis
[41:53] Chapter 18 and verse number one we're
[41:56] going to read about another man and his
[41:58] name is Abraham and the Bible says that
[42:01] the Lord appeared unto him speaking of
[42:03] Abraham in the plains of mamory and he
[42:06] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[42:09] day so it's a Divine appearance and one
[42:12] man sitting in the gate but there's
[42:13] another man who's sitting in the tent
[42:16] Door In the Heat of the day now also in
[42:18] the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter the
[42:21] book of Hebrews the 13th chapter I want
[42:23] to read there uh from the ninth verse uh
[42:26] you'll know that brother brandham uses
[42:28] this text in his sermon going beyond the
[42:30] camp in Hebrews 13 and verse 9 Paul here
[42:33] writing he says be not carried about
[42:36] with divers in strange doctrines for it
[42:39] is a good thing that the heart be
[42:40] established with Grace and not with
[42:43] Meats which have not profited them that
[42:45] have been occupied therein for we have
[42:48] an altar I I love how Paul says those
[42:50] words we have an altar we're not looking
[42:53] for one we have one we of the they have
[42:56] no right to eat which serve the
[42:58] Tabernacle for the bodies of those Beast
[43:00] whose blood is brought into the
[43:02] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[43:05] burned without the camp now wherefore
[43:07] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[43:10] people with his own blood suffered
[43:13] without the gate so verse 11 Paul is
[43:15] referring to the Old Testament verse 12
[43:17] Paul is speaking of Jesus but then if
[43:19] you look in the 13th verse he says let
[43:22] us go forth therefore unto him so it's
[43:24] gone from the Old Testament to Jesus now
[43:26] to us the believer and now he's saying
[43:29] let us go forth unto him without the
[43:31] camp bearing his reproach now watch this
[43:35] for here we have no continuing City but
[43:38] we seek one to come amen we have no
[43:41] continuing City but we seek one to come
[43:44] we ask the Lord this evening to add the
[43:45] blessing to the reading of his word as
[43:47] you can have your seats here this
[43:48] afternoon amen we we thank the Lord for
[43:51] the reading of the word of God Amen I
[43:53] want to tonight by the help of the Lord
[43:55] for just a few moments tonight I want to
[43:57] be mindful that it is a a Wednesday
[43:59] evening so we'll not try to hold you too
[44:01] long I'll preach fast and you amen fast
[44:03] and we'll get out fast okay uh but I I
[44:05] want to talk to you for just a few
[44:07] moments tonight on this thought if I
[44:08] would title it amen I want to speak to
[44:10] you on going be on the gate amen going
[44:13] beyond the gate brother Bram says in
[44:15] 1960 is there anything too hard for the
[44:18] Lord he said did you notice when the
[44:20] Angels Came to lot he said lot was
[44:22] sitting in the gate amen but Abraham was
[44:25] sitting in the door see the gate comes
[44:27] into the yard but the door goes into the
[44:29] house he said i' like to sit on the door
[44:32] or in the door on the altar as close as
[44:35] I can to him that's where my expectation
[44:37] is on the altar amen waiting for his
[44:40] appearing so uh brother Brandon must
[44:43] have known that there was some
[44:44] significance to these two scriptures
[44:46] amen that he would take time to
[44:48] positionally show where lot was sitting
[44:51] and then to show where Abraham was
[44:52] sitting and as you look at this amen lot
[44:55] was sitting in the the gate and the
[44:56] prophet said the gate comes in the yard
[44:58] amen but then he says Abraham was
[45:00] sitting in the door amen and the door
[45:03] goes into the house so it's showing us
[45:05] that the gate is an entrance amen so far
[45:08] amen but then there's a further place to
[45:10] go so you can come into the gate and you
[45:12] can come in the yard and you can settle
[45:14] down there but then you realize there
[45:16] was another man amen who went beyond the
[45:18] gate who went beyond the yard he went
[45:20] into the house amen and his name was
[45:23] Abraham I love that because the prophet
[45:25] of God shows us amen that we're living
[45:27] in a day of going Beyond he says it
[45:29] seems today to be a day of when people
[45:32] are going be on the camp Amen in
[45:35] everything they're going Beyond now you
[45:36] have to agree tonight that in education
[45:39] they're going Beyond in science amen
[45:41] they're going Beyond in religion they're
[45:43] going Beyond in everything in the world
[45:45] Amen they are going beyond the camp now
[45:48] amen Webster gives us a beautiful
[45:50] definition of the word Camp he said it
[45:52] is a place with temporary accommodations
[45:55] amen of Huts or tents or other
[45:57] structures amen it is a temporary
[46:00] dwelling place so a camp amen does not
[46:02] have a foundation it does not have amen
[46:05] Footers or concrete it's a tent or it's
[46:07] something amen that is not permanent
[46:09] it's only temporary amen and I want to
[46:12] set to you like this that we cannot make
[46:14] amen a temporary Dwelling Place a
[46:17] permanent place amen amen there's some
[46:19] places that we've got to go amen but we
[46:21] cannot stay there we've got to move
[46:23] forward because there's an anointing on
[46:26] amen not to stop short of the promises
[46:28] of God Amen in Genesis 13 the Bible
[46:31] speaks of these two men Abraham and lot
[46:34] and he says brother said we find out
[46:35] there come a Strife between lot hergan
[46:37] and so forth he said I want to show you
[46:39] something here about the coming of the
[46:41] Lord he said Abraham was an heir to the
[46:44] world how many would agree that Abraham
[46:46] was an heir to the world he said but lot
[46:49] was a type of the luk horn believer so
[46:51] now he's going to establish to us amen
[46:54] that Abraham is heir to the world world
[46:56] but lot is a type of the Lorn believer
[46:58] he was a Believer he left his homeland
[47:01] to sojurn with God but never fully
[47:03] surrendered he said and that's what's
[47:05] the trouble in the Full Gospel Church
[47:07] tonight along with the rest of them is
[47:09] people who has left the world Amen they
[47:11] keep out of the world they don't want to
[47:13] go gambling or drinking or carrying on
[47:15] Amen they are a Believer but have never
[47:18] made a complete surrender amen so lot
[47:21] was a type of a Lorn believer that had
[47:23] surrendered so much amen but he had
[47:25] never made that complete surrender that
[47:27] would take him Amen to the places that
[47:30] Abraham could go another place brother
[47:32] said remember that lot amen lot was a
[47:35] type of America he said it's proven what
[47:38] was the sin of Sodom it was perversion
[47:40] he said in this American country of ours
[47:42] the women has degraded themselves so
[47:44] much amen until the natural sources of
[47:47] man amen has been perverted so here a
[47:50] prophet is establishing that lot is a
[47:52] type of a Lorn believer he's a type of
[47:54] America not 1964 he said down there in
[47:57] Sodom we've seen what taking place lot
[47:59] was a type of the church natural that
[48:02] was down in Sodom the organization and
[48:04] they got a messenger down there there
[48:06] was a couple Messengers went down there
[48:08] a modern Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[48:10] amen I'm I'm I'm laying the foundation
[48:12] that lot was a type of the Lorn believer
[48:15] he was a type of America now he's a type
[48:17] of the organization down in Sodom and
[48:20] then the prophet of God says and God's
[48:21] word calls for total separation he said
[48:24] lot wanted the world so now we see amen
[48:27] why that lot did not go all the way
[48:29] because he still wanted the world so
[48:31] amen if he went through the gate into
[48:33] the yard he was in the gate so he could
[48:35] still hear what was going on in s him
[48:38] and he could still see what Abraham was
[48:39] doing but he did not want to make that
[48:41] Full Sacrifice or that full surrender he
[48:44] said and God tore his world up and
[48:46] separated Abraham and lot he said
[48:49] because lot being a type again of a
[48:51] carnal believer who didn't think these
[48:53] things were true he just went on down to
[48:55] s him because he did not have the spunk
[48:58] Amen to call right right and wrong wrong
[49:00] now I want you to catch something here
[49:02] amen lot is a type of a Lorn believer
[49:04] he's a type of America he's a type of
[49:07] the carnal Christian he's a type of
[49:09] organization can I say this to you amen
[49:11] lot is an established type of somebody
[49:14] amen that can only go so far but they
[49:16] cannot go the rest of the way amen but
[49:19] our God is not a mixer he is a separator
[49:22] and God did not leave lot and Abraham
[49:24] together but separated them because he
[49:27] had more inheritance amen for Abraham to
[49:29] move into than lot was willing to go
[49:32] amen see Abraham was a separator and lot
[49:34] was a mixer you say why would God call
[49:37] that a separation he said because God
[49:39] called Abraham to a total separation
[49:42] because God requires somebody say
[49:44] requires amen God requires a complete
[49:47] separation from all the world amen amen
[49:50] in order to bring him into what he was
[49:52] air to he had to separate from the
[49:55] things things that would hinder him amen
[49:57] from going into to what his inheritance
[49:59] was now I'm I'm going to say this as
[50:01] plain as I know how sometimes amen
[50:04] advancement requires separation y'all
[50:07] forgive me that's pretty straight but
[50:08] I'm just going to say it amen sometimes
[50:10] in order to advance amen it requires
[50:13] Separation The Prophet said no matter
[50:15] what the world says they still want Amen
[50:18] to bow to the Modern Trend of modern
[50:20] religion but there was no social gospel
[50:23] for a real believer he said they still
[50:25] believe that God is Holy amen they
[50:27] believe that he requires Holiness and he
[50:29] requires the new birth amen and he
[50:31] requires a separation from sin amen now
[50:34] let me say this when God separates you
[50:37] amen he's not doing that to be mean he's
[50:40] not doing that to be unjust he's not
[50:42] doing that to be a to be an uncaring or
[50:45] unloving father but he's separating you
[50:47] from something Amen to something so he
[50:50] don't separate you and leave you Idol
[50:52] without something to come to but he
[50:55] separat at you from something to join
[50:57] you to something else and brother said
[50:59] Jesus has constantly told us that there
[51:01] is a separation he said we find the last
[51:04] thing that's predicted to the human race
[51:06] before the great final day when he will
[51:08] Ascend in the presence of God there will
[51:10] be amen a final separation he will
[51:13] separate the sheep from the goats he
[51:15] said God will continually has been
[51:17] separating amen and that's what he's
[51:19] doing tonight that's what he always does
[51:22] you see it in every meeting he separates
[51:25] a and Faith from unbelief amen listen
[51:27] we're getting ready to go into a meeting
[51:29] amen I think tonight would be a good
[51:31] night for a total separation amen from
[51:34] unbelief because listen amen unbelief is
[51:37] not going to inherit the promises of
[51:39] this message unbelief is going to say
[51:41] that's not so and that's not so amen but
[51:44] if you can separate yourself from
[51:45] unbelief then you can realize that God
[51:48] is not calling you to a total separation
[51:50] to leave you without something he's
[51:52] trying to take you into something that's
[51:54] greater than what you're part of right
[51:56] now I think it's a powerful thing when
[51:59] the prophet shows us that the first man
[52:01] amen that separate himself he said that
[52:03] man was Adam right I want to establish
[52:05] this he said Adam separated himself amen
[52:08] from the word to go with his wife amen
[52:11] so Adam's separation was not an
[52:13] advancement amen it was a regression
[52:16] amen Adam separated from the word amen
[52:18] to go with his wife that question
[52:20] whether God kept his word or not he said
[52:22] what a perfect type of the lukewarm
[52:24] carnal Ed believer today that still
[52:27] wants to cling with their tradition
[52:29] instead of taking what the word says He
[52:31] was separated to his wife he said and
[52:34] the carnal believer is separated amen
[52:36] from the word to the church amen I'm
[52:39] narrowing it down here amen because
[52:41] we're not a bunch of carnal Believers
[52:43] amen lot is not our type amen we do not
[52:46] separate from the word amen to stand
[52:49] with the church amen but we separate
[52:51] from everything that is contrary to
[52:53] God's word amen to stand with the word
[52:56] said that Catholic told him said well
[52:58] God is in his church he said God is in
[53:00] his church but he's in his word and the
[53:02] only way he'll be in his church is if
[53:04] his word is in his church and I believe
[53:06] there's a bride in the last days that is
[53:09] not built upon the ideas of a man she's
[53:11] not established on the personalities
[53:14] amen but she's following Vindicated word
[53:16] that is calling her from the separation
[53:18] from unbelief and tradition Amen to move
[53:21] into the inheritance that God has given
[53:23] her in the age she's living amen always
[53:26] somebody say always the word requires
[53:29] total and complete
[53:32] separation regardless now somebody say
[53:35] well that's a little hard no it's not
[53:37] regardless of who you are regardless of
[53:40] where you come from the same
[53:42] requirements is is is established to
[53:45] every believer now every one of us
[53:47] sitting here tonight we're on a journey
[53:49] how many would agree amen we're on a
[53:50] journey and I believe that in a journey
[53:53] amen there are steps in that Journey I
[53:55] do not believe that we are on a journey
[53:57] of of of of of of reduction amen but I
[54:00] believe we're on a journey of growth is
[54:02] it is it okay I believe we're on a
[54:03] journey of growth and I believe that as
[54:05] long as we are here amen we are growing
[54:08] in Christ I believe as long as we're on
[54:10] this side of Eternity amen we are
[54:13] growing in Christ no matter how long
[54:15] you've been serving God Amen there's
[54:17] always room to grow in the revelation of
[54:20] the word that you're following now when
[54:22] you look at this you realize that the
[54:24] natural a types the spiritual and you
[54:27] know as humans tonight you had a human
[54:29] journey and that human Journey began as
[54:31] a birth and you was born an infant right
[54:34] amen a newborn then become an infant
[54:36] then become a baby then become a toddler
[54:38] then become a child amen then become an
[54:40] adolescent then become a pre-teen then
[54:42] you become a teenager then you become an
[54:44] adult then you become an elder amen see
[54:46] it's constantly but it's not you going
[54:48] down amen so to speak it's you maturing
[54:51] amen or moving forward now Paul says in
[54:54] Ephesians 4 he said that we would all
[54:56] come in the unity of the faith and of
[54:58] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[55:00] perfect man unto the measure of the
[55:03] stature of the fullness of Christ amen
[55:05] another word for stature amen is
[55:08] maturity amen so Paul is not praying
[55:11] that the church amen would shrink amen
[55:14] but he's praying that the church would
[55:15] move amen from infancy into maturity
[55:18] they would move from adolescence amen
[55:21] into the full stature and that word
[55:23] fullness in the New Testament is a body
[55:25] of Believers that which is filled with
[55:27] the presence and the power and the
[55:30] agency and the riches of God of Christ
[55:33] amen I want to go ahead and preach for a
[55:34] minute tonight amen this church is not
[55:36] full of tradition and she's not full of
[55:39] Creeds and she's not full of dogmas Amen
[55:42] but there's a bride on the earth tonight
[55:44] who is a living manifestation amen of
[55:46] the fullness of the stature of Jesus
[55:49] Christ in the age we're living listen
[55:51] we're not packing a bunch of bitterness
[55:53] and we're not packing a bunch of ill
[55:54] feeling amen but we are packing the
[55:56] divine presence of almighty God we are
[55:59] packing the power of God and the mind of
[56:02] God and the faith of God hallelujah and
[56:05] the knowledge of God is in this body
[56:07] tonight and it's moving you into
[56:11] maturity now I can prove it to you
[56:13] because the very next words Paul says
[56:15] that we henceforth be no more
[56:17] children that we henceforth be no more
[56:20] children tossed to and fro and carried
[56:23] about with every wind of do
[56:25] by the Slate of men and cunning
[56:27] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[56:30] deceive but Paul says speak the truth
[56:32] and love that they may grow up somebody
[56:34] say grow up that they may grow up in Him
[56:38] in all things which is the head even
[56:40] Christ I love this word grow it means to
[56:43] increase it means to become greater so
[56:46] Paul is saying that as the knowledge of
[56:48] the Son of God comes into the church it
[56:51] will literally establish the church and
[56:53] it will move the church chur amen from
[56:56] childhood into manhood and the prophet
[56:58] said Born Again Christians amen they
[57:00] grow into the stature of Christ as they
[57:03] live they are born again and their lives
[57:06] begin to shape like a baby it takes form
[57:08] and begins to grow and the first thing
[57:10] you know here they are in the full
[57:12] stature listen you got to quit letting
[57:14] the devil sell you a bunch of lies about
[57:16] yourself that you're not growing and
[57:18] you're not progressing amen when I'm not
[57:20] taking steps like brother mad I'm not
[57:22] taking steps like brother Joe amen I'm
[57:25] not taking steps like this one amen your
[57:27] measuring stick is not somebody else
[57:29] your measuring stick is the word of God
[57:32] and the Bible says amen that footsteps
[57:34] means possession and some people here
[57:37] tonight got a size nine foot and some
[57:39] got a size 10 and a size eight and some
[57:41] got a size 15 amen listen they're not
[57:44] all going to make the same steps amen
[57:46] but if they're moving in the same
[57:48] direction amen then every step is an
[57:50] advancement from where they were when
[57:52] they started and I believe I'm looking
[57:54] at some people people tonight let's got
[57:56] their walking shoes on in the promises
[57:58] of God listen I may not be where I want
[58:01] to be amen but thank God I'm not where I
[58:03] used to be I may not be where I want to
[58:06] be but there's a word that is speaking
[58:08] over my life and it's causing me to grow
[58:11] it's causing me to mature it's causing
[58:13] me to move into Christ where he is the
[58:15] head of my life and he is the very
[58:17] captain of my
[58:19] salvation listen if you make one
[58:21] centimeter today and two tomorrow you're
[58:24] three centimeters ahead of where you
[58:26] were when you started if you make one
[58:28] foot today and one inch tomorrow come on
[58:31] some days are going to be inch days and
[58:33] some days are going to be feet days and
[58:35] some days are going to be centimeter
[58:36] days amen but whatever you do just keep
[58:39] on moving amen because there's higher
[58:41] Heights and there's deeper depths of the
[58:44] grace of God for the bride to move
[58:46] into there you are day after day year
[58:50] after year they stay the same see now
[58:52] come back to the word remember showing
[58:55] you the reason why they stay the same
[58:57] why they stay the same in growth is
[58:59] because they're growing in the word see
[59:02] that's the place the bride grows is in
[59:04] the word again he said we went through
[59:06] it this morning but you cannot expect a
[59:08] baby to be born to man it's got to grow
[59:10] to it and we grow in Christ to the full
[59:14] stature not somebody get converted
[59:16] tonight and tomorrow go preach the
[59:17] gospel amen but we grow up into manhood
[59:21] into the stature of Christ amen so
[59:23] Paul's holding desire amen is to move
[59:26] the church from childhood into manhood
[59:29] amen now listen the prophet that we're
[59:31] always talking about how bad the world
[59:33] is getting amen and we are forgetting
[59:35] how powerful amen the church is getting
[59:38] at the same time that we're focusing
[59:40] Brother David on how bad the world's
[59:42] getting listen we know the world's
[59:44] getting bad and it's not going to get
[59:46] better amen but I refuse to let the
[59:48] devil use my eyes Amen to investigate
[59:51] how badly ought to see is kidding amen
[59:54] I'm looking looking at the Unseen amen
[59:56] I'm looking at the power and the faith
[59:58] of God and that's all I can see I can
[1:00:00] see beyond what America can see I can
[1:00:03] see beyond what Sodom can see I can see
[1:00:05] beyond what the lukor church member can
[1:00:07] see because I'm not a lot I'm an Abraham
[1:00:11] and I've got an inheritance and it's not
[1:00:13] in the yard it's in the
[1:00:17] House Pro of God said the church is
[1:00:19] growing how many believes the church is
[1:00:21] growing each age is lot in the scripture
[1:00:23] here so through the Holy Spirit Reveals
[1:00:26] His word amen by manifesting it man it
[1:00:29] feels good in here tonight amen by
[1:00:31] manifesting it and Vindicated it his
[1:00:34] amen showing that it's his word being
[1:00:37] brought to pass in the day that it's
[1:00:38] promised in amen now listen do you
[1:00:41] realize amen that the word of God is a
[1:00:43] spoken word and when that word is spoken
[1:00:46] it has to be manifested and the
[1:00:48] manifestation of the spoken word of God
[1:00:51] Amen is the Vindication that it is is
[1:00:54] the spoken word of God in other words
[1:00:57] when it spoke and it manifest there's no
[1:01:00] more questions this day this scripture
[1:01:03] is fulfilled in other words when Jesus
[1:01:05] rather when God Amen in the Bible said
[1:01:08] let there be light amen he spoke the
[1:01:10] word right amen and the prophet said he
[1:01:12] spoke and said let there be light he
[1:01:14] said and out of nowhere there was light
[1:01:16] he said the light was the manifestation
[1:01:18] amen of the spoken word he said and the
[1:01:21] same light that was the manifestation of
[1:01:24] the spoken word was also the Vindication
[1:01:27] of the spoken word listen friends amen
[1:01:29] and the same God that said let there be
[1:01:32] light they said let there be a sun they
[1:01:34] said let there be a moon it's the same
[1:01:36] God that said let there be a
[1:01:39] bride he said let there be a bride amen
[1:01:43] and I want to say this this bride is the
[1:01:46] manifestation of the spoken word of God
[1:01:49] in the hour that we're living in amen
[1:01:51] what are you saying I'm saying what a
[1:01:52] prophet said in the Rapture he said when
[1:01:54] a germ comes in the womb of a female he
[1:01:56] said you didn't become a human germ from
[1:01:58] your father and then the next a germ
[1:02:00] from a dog and the next from a cat and
[1:02:02] the next from a chicken amen it was all
[1:02:04] human germ amen so from the time amen of
[1:02:08] come on now amen from the time that baby
[1:02:10] was conceived in the womb of that mother
[1:02:13] it was a human germ and it was another
[1:02:15] human germ amen and for n months or was
[1:02:18] human J God hallelujah there was human
[1:02:21] germ on top of human germ amen someday
[1:02:24] she could feel it kick amen somay she
[1:02:26] could see it kick amen some days she
[1:02:29] didn't feel it kick amen but she never
[1:02:31] lost the thought that I am carrying the
[1:02:33] prod I am carrying a child and in nine
[1:02:36] months this child is going to be born
[1:02:39] and he's going to be the manifestation
[1:02:41] amen of the seed on the inside of me
[1:02:43] listen church of living God Amen you
[1:02:45] cannot give up and you cannot turn
[1:02:48] around and you cannot let the devil at
[1:02:50] chm from denomination and from tradition
[1:02:52] you are a word born pride and the only
[1:02:55] thing that will escape the wrath of God
[1:02:58] that is coming upon this world is the
[1:03:00] word of God manifested In the Flesh of
[1:03:02] the
[1:03:03] Bride then the body of Jesus Christ the
[1:03:06] bride will be a part of his body he was
[1:03:09] the word and the bride will have to be
[1:03:11] the
[1:03:12] word that's plain enough for me it'll
[1:03:15] have to be the bride have to be the word
[1:03:17] he said now watch Luther amen watch word
[1:03:20] added to word somebody say word added to
[1:03:22] word word
[1:03:25] added the word not tradition added the
[1:03:27] word not Creed added to word not
[1:03:31] denomination added to word not Sodom
[1:03:34] added to word not Lea added to word but
[1:03:37] word added to word see Luther's
[1:03:40] justification Wesley's sanctification
[1:03:43] Pentecostals baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:45] the rest restoration of the gifts and
[1:03:47] all the rest of it goes with it see but
[1:03:49] it's got to be word on top of word amen
[1:03:51] germ on top of germ life on oh
[1:03:55] God life on top of life amen to bring
[1:03:58] out the full stature of the Bride of the
[1:04:01] Lord Jesus Christ he said and what is
[1:04:03] that word bride is the manifestation of
[1:04:06] this hour see the bride not a Creed or
[1:04:09] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[1:04:12] a living attribute of God displaying to
[1:04:14] the world the attributes of God in the
[1:04:17] formation of the Bride that's to be
[1:04:20] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:04:22] living in that's why Prophet said this
[1:04:24] this is not Luther's day this is not
[1:04:26] Wesley's day this is not Pentecost day
[1:04:29] amen this is bride time this is the
[1:04:31] bride day listen Luther manifested his
[1:04:34] word Wesley manifested his word
[1:04:36] Pentecost manifested her word amen but
[1:04:39] now there's a virgin born Bride on the
[1:04:41] face of the earth that is going to move
[1:04:44] amen from the infancy of Pentecost Amen
[1:04:46] to the maturity of the word and all the
[1:04:49] life that is in the seed is going to
[1:04:51] gather in this bride come on you've not
[1:04:55] been thrown out you've been
[1:04:57] built you've not been thrown out to the
[1:04:59] wind to land wherever the wind goes you
[1:05:01] have been built Jesus said Upon This
[1:05:04] Rock I will build my church and the
[1:05:06] Gates of Hell shall not amen Prevail
[1:05:08] against it amen well I might as well
[1:05:10] preach I'm here amen the gates of hell
[1:05:13] has been against this church it has been
[1:05:15] against you body of Believers amen but
[1:05:17] listen you're still here and the Gates
[1:05:19] of Hell have not prevailed as a
[1:05:21] testimony that the Gates of Hell will
[1:05:24] come against it but they will never
[1:05:26] Prevail against it because greater is
[1:05:28] the germ of the word on the inside of
[1:05:31] the church than the pressure of the
[1:05:33] devil against it are you hearing me the
[1:05:36] devil will throw everything he's God but
[1:05:37] you'll still be standing the devil will
[1:05:40] throw everything he's got but you'll
[1:05:41] still be standing because you're not
[1:05:43] part Baptist and you're not part
[1:05:45] Methodist you're not part hybrid and
[1:05:48] part this amen but from the bottom to
[1:05:50] the top you are word through and through
[1:05:53] well we might as well enjoy ourselves
[1:05:55] amen this is a word church where the
[1:05:57] word has become the headship amen we
[1:06:00] sing by the word we Shout by the word we
[1:06:03] operate the gifts by the word we preach
[1:06:05] by the word we conduct ourselves by the
[1:06:09] word it's a word built church and Jesus
[1:06:12] said Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:06:15] see the whole program the whole church
[1:06:17] is built upon divine revelation flesh
[1:06:20] and blood is not revealed this he said
[1:06:22] what was it a revelation of who he was
[1:06:25] see you're built on a revelation of who
[1:06:28] he was and if you're built on the
[1:06:30] revelation of who he was he's the same
[1:06:33] oh God yesterday today and forever than
[1:06:36] what he was yesterday he is today and
[1:06:39] what he is today he'll be forever
[1:06:41] because he's the unchanging God with
[1:06:44] unchanging ways the revelation of Jesus
[1:06:47] Christ in this hour not what he was in
[1:06:49] another hour what he was now the Bible
[1:06:51] expresses it's growing in the bride to
[1:06:55] the full stature he said therefore can I
[1:06:57] read this to you if the corn of wheat of
[1:06:59] Christ had to fall in the ground so did
[1:07:01] the bride have to fall in the ground
[1:07:03] through the Dark Ages any grain that
[1:07:05] goes in the ground must die or it cannot
[1:07:06] produce itself reproduce and the great
[1:07:09] church that he established on the day of
[1:07:11] Pentecost by the sending of the Holy
[1:07:13] Ghost had to suffer martyr and go in the
[1:07:16] dirt in the Dark Age to bring forth
[1:07:18] again the age of Luther and come on out
[1:07:20] somebody say come on out to the full
[1:07:23] stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:07:26] this last day I love what he says
[1:07:27] brother Matt therefore the bride Amen in
[1:07:31] the Rapture the bride in the Rapture
[1:07:34] will come forth listen if Luther come
[1:07:37] forth and Wesley come forth and
[1:07:39] Pentecost come forth this bride will
[1:07:41] come forth and she will be in the
[1:07:44] Rapture there is all pre-planned by God
[1:07:48] and God is backing it up well you might
[1:07:50] as well tell that devil to get out of my
[1:07:52] way I'mma go in the Rapture my body's
[1:07:55] going to be changed there ain't no devil
[1:07:57] can stop it there ain't no Spirit can
[1:07:59] bind it listen this ain't a man backing
[1:08:02] this up this ain't a preacher backing
[1:08:04] you up this is almighty God is backing
[1:08:07] you up and he will put you in the
[1:08:09] Rapture by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:11] and he'll not ask one devil if he can do
[1:08:13] it he'll not ask one critic if he can do
[1:08:15] it what God determines to do he's going
[1:08:18] to do and hell will not stop him high
[1:08:20] water will not stop him there's a force
[1:08:23] in this Pride it's the force of almighty
[1:08:25] God that'll Lift You Off the Earth
[1:08:29] someday what are you saying I'm saying
[1:08:31] God's going to have a mature church and
[1:08:33] no Devil's going to stop
[1:08:35] it he's going to have an adopted church
[1:08:38] and no Devil's going to stop it brother
[1:08:41] B said I believe we've been children
[1:08:42] long enough I think we can say amen God
[1:08:46] is going to turn his church into manhood
[1:08:49] now when we turn oh God when we turn
[1:08:52] that corner and we move into man manhood
[1:08:54] we quit acting like
[1:08:56] babies we played and Frolic as children
[1:09:00] amen but now somebody say now we're
[1:09:02] going to have to put away childish
[1:09:03] things and take on manhood maturity Paul
[1:09:07] said when I was a child I spake as a
[1:09:09] child listen you know why I spake as a
[1:09:11] child brother said because he thought as
[1:09:13] a
[1:09:14] child we could fix a
[1:09:17] lot oh help me Lord we can fix a lot of
[1:09:20] problems if people would change their
[1:09:22] thinking we could literally fix a lot of
[1:09:25] situations if people would stop thinking
[1:09:27] like babies and then acting like babies
[1:09:30] now come on y'all know I'm not a
[1:09:32] politician I'm a preacher quit thinking
[1:09:34] like a baby and then everybody don't
[1:09:36] look at you won't offend you quit oh
[1:09:39] quit thinking like a baby and then every
[1:09:41] time you don't get called on somebody
[1:09:42] wasn't against you when you can lay
[1:09:44] aside childhood and take on manhood
[1:09:47] which is the maturity of the headship of
[1:09:50] Christ it'll change the way you think
[1:09:52] and brother brother Morgan Paul said
[1:09:54] amen let this mind be in you that was
[1:09:57] also in Christ Jesus do you really think
[1:10:00] Jesus thought like a baby do you really
[1:10:02] think he let every little whim and every
[1:10:04] little thing that went around amen
[1:10:05] keeping from the house of God no he knew
[1:10:08] who he was he knew where he come from he
[1:10:11] knew where he was standing and there's a
[1:10:13] reason there's a devil against this

[1:10:36] saying preacher I'm saying greater is he
[1:10:39] that is in Grace Tabernacle than he that
[1:10:41] is in the world against

[1:10:48] thinking like a child into thinking like
[1:10:50] an adult because she's now now can I
[1:10:52] tell you why because she's moving from
[1:10:55] the milk to the
[1:10:56] meat she's moving from milk to meat as
[1:11:00] newborn babies desire the sincere milk
[1:11:03] of the word that you may grow thereby so
[1:11:06] they got to have milk to
[1:11:08] start but they cannot stay with milk
[1:11:11] they got to move on to meat I remember
[1:11:13] when Malachi amen was living on a bottle
[1:11:16] amen every time every time you want to
[1:11:18] eat he got a bottle milk got a bottle I
[1:11:19] remember one night Mariah was feeding
[1:11:21] him and I looked over and he's asleep
[1:11:23] and I'm thinking wait a second he's
[1:11:24] eating wake
[1:11:27] up she said oh no he's fine he can eat
[1:11:29] and sleep I thought I preach to people
[1:11:31] like
[1:11:33] that they can sit there and sleep cuz
[1:11:35] all they want's milk and they never grow
[1:11:37] well come on Church they never grow but
[1:11:40] when you start eating a T-bone steak you
[1:11:42] don't fall asleep at the table and eat
[1:11:44] that T-Bone
[1:11:46] steak and if you're going to claim to
[1:11:48] serve steak serve some steak come on
[1:11:51] church are you hearing me I believe this
[1:11:53] message is serving steak I don't believe
[1:11:55] we're serving come on I don't believe
[1:11:58] we're serving milk anymore some are
[1:12:00] getting milk but there's a bride here
[1:12:01] that is eating steak come on you say
[1:12:04] preacher are you saying we all got to go
[1:12:05] to meat no because some still need milk
[1:12:08] amen but don't stop at the milk stage
[1:12:10] amen come on into the meat of the word
[1:12:13] of God that is in season it'll put some
[1:12:15] strength on your bones it'll put some
[1:12:17] Faith muscles in your spiritual body
[1:12:19] it'll teach you how to fight against the
[1:12:21] devil it'll teach you how to fight them
[1:12:24] come on it'll Fe teach you how to fight
[1:12:26] them depression Spirits amen when you
[1:12:28] start eating some meat of the word it'll
[1:12:30] cause you to come to church when you got
[1:12:32] ever reason to stay home when you start
[1:12:34] eating the meat of the word it'll cause
[1:12:36] you to love and
[1:12:39] forgive you know the Holy Spirit feeds
[1:12:41] on the word every word now there are
[1:12:44] some people they're still eating on me
[1:12:46] they're still eating on milk and when
[1:12:48] they do come everything bothers them
[1:12:50] well don't get mad at us cuz we're
[1:12:52] enjoying some steak
[1:12:55] well preacher all that shout brother
[1:12:56] said people don't believe in shouting
[1:12:58] thing of it is they haven't got
[1:12:59] spiritual joy and the joys of the Waters
[1:13:01] of Life cannot flow through he said
[1:13:04] because the unbelief and the cares of
[1:13:06] the world has bound the
[1:13:08] people until it cannot produce spiritual
[1:13:12] growth so when somebody does start
[1:13:14] growing and eating some meat well
[1:13:16] they're just emotional and they're just
[1:13:18] Pentecostal and they're just too loud
[1:13:20] they're just too hell come on Church
[1:13:22] y'all know I'm telling the truth I have
[1:13:24] literally seen young people get the Holy
[1:13:26] Ghost and break out in a Revival in a
[1:13:28] church and go out somewhere and hear
[1:13:30] somebody sit there for 30 minutes and
[1:13:31] tell me how horrible it is that them
[1:13:33] young people are shouting and they're on
[1:13:35] their feet and they're dancing and I'm
[1:13:37] sitting there asking them well listen I
[1:13:38] remember when you used to act like
[1:13:41] that come on I tell you what we might as
[1:13:44] well preach it's Wednesday night but you
[1:13:46] know what happened amen as we got a
[1:13:47] little bit of knowledge and we got a
[1:13:49] little bit of understanding and we got
[1:13:51] so revelated that we don't need to sing
[1:13:53] No More more and we don't need to shout
[1:13:54] no more and we don't need to pray no
[1:13:56] more amen but that's where the devil
[1:13:58] will kill your spiritual growth but I
[1:14:00] say Satan you will never write the word
[1:14:03] kabad over the Church of the Living God
[1:14:05] we'll fight that devil until the
[1:14:07] presence of God comes in the church and
[1:14:09] changes somebody's
[1:14:12] life because God desires amen spiritual
[1:14:16] growth more than natural growth don't
[1:14:19] get mad at me God's not God's not upset
[1:14:21] for natural growth he loves to see it
[1:14:23] but what he really wants to see is
[1:14:25] spiritual growth amen listen the Bible
[1:14:27] says in Deuteronomy 2:1 that we turned
[1:14:30] and we took our journey brother brother
[1:14:32] mad it amazes me we turned and took our
[1:14:34] journey he says Into the Wilderness by
[1:14:37] the way of the Red Sea and the Lord
[1:14:39] spake unto me and said you have
[1:14:40] compassed Mount sier many days and the
[1:14:43] Lord spake unto me and said he have
[1:14:45] compassed this mountain long enough
[1:14:49] you've been around this mountain long
[1:14:51] enough and the next words he says
[1:14:53] brother Wesley he says turn you
[1:14:55] northward in other words he changes
[1:14:57] brother Ro he changes their Direction he
[1:15:00] says listen Mount Sierra was not a bad
[1:15:02] thing the Red Sea was not a bad thing
[1:15:05] that was a stage in your journey you had
[1:15:07] to go there but you got to go beyond
[1:15:10] this mountain there is more in your
[1:15:13] journey the prophet of God said they
[1:15:15] were 40 he said by automobile they were
[1:15:17] an hour and a half away he said by
[1:15:20] walking they were two or three days he
[1:15:22] said listen they could have been in
[1:15:23] there in no time he said they were that
[1:15:25] far away from the full promise he said
[1:15:27] but a short Journey amen turned into
[1:15:30] years of wondering in the wilderness
[1:15:32] amen all because they chose amen law
[1:15:36] over Grace brother B said watch Grace
[1:15:38] had provided them a great thing it
[1:15:40] provided them a Passover Lamb for their
[1:15:42] sins provided them a prophet as their
[1:15:44] instructor provided them an angel as
[1:15:46] their guide and they broke out in the
[1:15:48] greatest Revival they had ever seen when
[1:15:50] the world was in darkness Israel had
[1:15:52] light when the when the Israelites was
[1:15:54] in bondage and then they had Deliverance
[1:15:56] see Ram said watch he said and in this
[1:15:58] revival they crossed the Red Sea and
[1:16:01] they found all their enemies dead in the
[1:16:03] Red Sea behind them then why would they
[1:16:05] want to add anything to
[1:16:07] that now think about this because the
[1:16:09] prophet said let us notice here amen how
[1:16:12] the children of Israel starting on their
[1:16:14] journey is a perfect type of the church
[1:16:17] today amen making its way to the glory
[1:16:19] land don't you believe that we're each
[1:16:21] day amen gaining a little ground as we
[1:16:24] go along building a campfire on a new
[1:16:26] ground every night he said I feel a
[1:16:29] little closer than I did yesterday and I
[1:16:31] believe you do just building a new
[1:16:33] campfire each night amen moving on up
[1:16:37] somebody said that with me moving on up
[1:16:40] so we're not staying where we're at amen
[1:16:42] but every day we're moving on up see
[1:16:45] God's church is not going down we're
[1:16:48] going up what devil sold you that lie
[1:16:52] that we're going down we're not going
[1:16:54] down we're going up because the force of
[1:16:58] predestination is on the inside of our
[1:17:00] soul listen the world forces that way
[1:17:03] and the world forces this way but the
[1:17:05] power of God forces upward and the bride
[1:17:08] will go in the Rapture by the power of
[1:17:11] God now I believe it I believe God
[1:17:14] foreen a church I believe he ordained a
[1:17:16] church that's going to stand before him
[1:17:20] as a manifestation of what he thought of
[1:17:22] in the beginning I believe it church I
[1:17:25] believe that Martin Luther amen didn't
[1:17:27] stay where he was at remember said he
[1:17:28] reached justification then he said
[1:17:30] Wesley he reached sanctification he said
[1:17:33] then Along come the Pentecostals in the
[1:17:35] baptism the holy spirit amen what were
[1:17:37] they doing moving on up into higher
[1:17:39] Heights amen is it okay tonight he said
[1:17:42] now when the Brethren received the
[1:17:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost they said who
[1:17:46] said this they said they said this is
[1:17:49] the summit God never said that they said
[1:17:53] this is the summit this is all of it he
[1:17:55] said but Brethren that's wrong see there
[1:17:58] is no Summit to God's power we move on
[1:18:01] and on and on it's the unlimited
[1:18:05] resources of God that has never been
[1:18:07] tapped yet amen the blessings and the
[1:18:10] powers that we know nothing about it's
[1:18:12] never been revealed to archangels is
[1:18:15] just laying ahead for the church amen
[1:18:17] that will believe listen church amen the
[1:18:20] power of God the revelation of God is
[1:18:23] not coming it's here and the prophet
[1:18:26] says let's move up and claim our
[1:18:31] rights Brother David I think it's time
[1:18:33] to move up and claim our rights listen
[1:18:37] you got rights in this message come on
[1:18:40] Church you got rights in this me you
[1:18:42] have got rights in the revelation of the
[1:18:45] message of there I'm just going to go
[1:18:46] ahead and preach since I'm here because
[1:18:48] a bunch of scarecrows have got around
[1:18:50] the revealing of the son of man and
[1:18:53] around the Revelation the seventh seal
[1:18:55] and around the third pull and all the
[1:18:57] things of the message and said now
[1:18:58] listen don't go in there because if you
[1:19:01] go in there you'll just be a dead
[1:19:02] intellectual member with sin in your
[1:19:05] life amen but that didn't come from what
[1:19:07] a prophet said because a prophet got the
[1:19:10] revelation of the seals and he said
[1:19:13] whatever I received was stimulation of
[1:19:16] Revelation and he said I like to woke up
[1:19:18] the entire neighborhood amen and then he
[1:19:20] says a mystery is the mind of God
[1:19:23] revealed and the supernatural element
[1:19:26] Still Remains don't you let some devil
[1:19:29] tell you that the revelation of this
[1:19:31] message takes the supernatural out of
[1:19:33] the church that is a Lie from the pits
[1:19:35] of hell if there's ever been a
[1:19:37] supernatural it ought to be happening
[1:19:39] right now as the bride is moving into
[1:19:42] the revelation of the revealing of the
[1:19:44] word of God in the age she's living
[1:19:47] in let's move on
[1:19:50] up now I know what people say they say
[1:19:53] well I don't know if there's anything
[1:19:54] for me well the prophet said let's
[1:19:56] believe this plus how much more we can
[1:19:58] hear from God he said I think that ought
[1:20:00] to be the motive of every man and woman
[1:20:02] that loves the Lord Jesus how many loves
[1:20:05] the Lord Jesus he says your motive ought
[1:20:08] to be to receive all that you
[1:20:12] can to receive all that you can from his
[1:20:16] Bountiful hand of
[1:20:19] mercy so this message has literally got
[1:20:22] you eaten out of God's
[1:20:25] hand now you say brother Andrew where
[1:20:27] are you going well remember this the
[1:20:29] prophet said in Masterpiece 64 he said
[1:20:32] notice here the life somebody say the
[1:20:34] life the life that was in the husk in
[1:20:37] the stalk in the tassle in the husk all
[1:20:40] gathers in the
[1:20:44] seed he said now the life that was in
[1:20:46] the stalk went on to make the other see
[1:20:49] and justification made a way for
[1:20:51] sanctification and sanctification made a
[1:20:54] way for the for the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:57] Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:00] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to
[1:21:03] come right down in Perfection amen back
[1:21:06] to the word again to manifest itself
[1:21:09] listen that's not a quo to find that's a
[1:21:11] quo to preach the devil out of the
[1:21:13] church with anden this message did not
[1:21:16] put the anointing on the outside it
[1:21:18] brought the anointing in the church and
[1:21:20] released us to know the difference
[1:21:22] between the Shu and the
[1:21:25] seed and the way of the Holy Ghost has
[1:21:28] been made and he's now here in the
[1:21:30] person which when he came in he was
[1:21:32] announcing you're not just church
[1:21:34] members you're adoption people you are
[1:21:37] the people that a prophet prayed and
[1:21:39] said God has been preparing a people to
[1:21:42] believe all things you are Romans 8:19
[1:21:46] you are the earnest expectation of the
[1:21:48] creature amen waited for the
[1:21:51] manifestation of the son of God Amen
[1:21:53] this is one of them quotes brother Mt
[1:21:55] amen I love to read it in serpent seed
[1:21:58] he said God hid it from the eyes of the
[1:22:00] wise and prudence and promis to reveal
[1:22:03] it to the sons of God in the last days
[1:22:05] when the sons of God would be made
[1:22:08] manifest when God's sons that rejoiced
[1:22:11] with him before the foundation of the
[1:22:14] world when the Great revelation of the
[1:22:16] godhead and things would be brought down
[1:22:18] in the last days he would manifest these
[1:22:21] things to the sons of God you know the
[1:22:24] scripture teaches that prophetic
[1:22:26] announcement and here we
[1:22:30] are we're not coming to it we're in it
[1:22:34] the Revelation is not on its way the
[1:22:37] Revelation is here then somebody tell me
[1:22:40] amen what a disappointment it must be to
[1:22:42] God when he looks at people and says
[1:22:44] when you is in my mind I seen you
[1:22:47] shouting about these things but now that
[1:22:49] I released them you're arguing and
[1:22:52] separating and
[1:22:54] contentions well come on church amen and
[1:22:56] listen amen well we don't need that we
[1:22:58] don't need this amen how about we just
[1:23:00] get back to saying what a prophet said
[1:23:02] we
[1:23:03] need and he said we needed prayer lines
[1:23:07] and he said we needed altar calls and he
[1:23:09] said we needed the spoken word and he
[1:23:11] said we had the third pull and he said
[1:23:13] we needed repent services and we need
[1:23:16] shouting Services he said we need prayer
[1:23:18] services and we need testimony Services
[1:23:21] I just got one question who died and
[1:23:24] left you in charge Amen to put the
[1:23:26] church in order the church was already
[1:23:28] in order when a prophet walked off the
[1:23:32] scene he say preacher back away I will
[1:23:34] not back away from that nickan devil
[1:23:37] that's trying to creep its way in this
[1:23:39] message and clamp our young people down
[1:23:41] and clamp our churches down I think if
[1:23:44] there's ever been a time Amen to shout
[1:23:46] that devil out of the building right now
[1:23:48] is the time to do it and let the liberty
[1:23:51] of the Holy Ghost come back in the
[1:23:53] church and manifest himself with power
[1:23:55] and
[1:23:57] Revelation back up amen how much further
[1:24:00] we going to back up till we ain't even
[1:24:02] got a
[1:24:03] land come on Church how much further we
[1:24:06] going to back up until we're another
[1:24:08] cold formal bunch of message people
[1:24:10] sitting in a building I refuse to back
[1:24:15] up I refuse to lay my sword down and let
[1:24:18] some unbelieving Child come in this land
[1:24:21] and strip us of a blessing of the power
[1:24:23] of God I'm going to shout when I feel
[1:24:25] like shouting I'm going to dance when I
[1:24:27] feel like
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:30] dancing I'm going to preach deep when I
[1:24:32] feel like preaching deep and I'm going
[1:24:34] to preach what the Holy Ghost leads me
[1:24:35] when he leads
[1:24:38] me I know that devil don't like it but I
[1:24:40] really don't
[1:24:45] care you can clap a highand down but I
[1:24:47] ain't a
[1:24:49] highand that's the reason God's opening
[1:24:51] these things to us
[1:24:52] is God is bringing his sons into
[1:24:56] manifestation can I tell you what he's
[1:24:58] doing he's going beyond the
[1:25:03] limitations brother Matt he's going
[1:25:05] beyond the limitations of any human
[1:25:08] knowledge way into the spiritual
[1:25:12] Revelations and bringing it
[1:25:16] down don't get mad at me but for the
[1:25:19] first time in 2,000 years there's a
[1:25:23] people that's got a right to preach
[1:25:24] these
[1:25:26] things we don't have an
[1:25:29] education we're not intellectual men we
[1:25:32] didn't come from the right come on let
[1:25:34] me let me just go ahead and preach to
[1:25:35] you tonight for the first time there's a
[1:25:37] people got a right to enjoy these things
[1:25:40] for the first time the denominational
[1:25:43] hierarchy has been Stripped Away from
[1:25:45] the life of the believer and no matter
[1:25:47] what background you come out of no
[1:25:49] matter where you was born no matter what
[1:25:51] you've been through
[1:25:52] you have got a right to enjoy the
[1:25:56] revelation of the word of God in the age
[1:25:58] you're
[1:25:59] living now I know what I'm talking about
[1:26:02] amen cuz if this was a reformer day you
[1:26:04] would have had to had an education but
[1:26:06] this is not a Reformation this is a
[1:26:10] restoration this is not a desperation
[1:26:13] this is a restoration come on the bride
[1:26:15] age is not an age of desperation it's an
[1:26:19] age of
[1:26:21] restoration
[1:26:23] it's an age when everything that was in
[1:26:25] the beginning has been returned to the
[1:26:28] church now can I prove it to you can I
[1:26:31] prove to you you got a right to enjoy
[1:26:33] these things no matter where you come
[1:26:35] from is that okay the one bringing it to
[1:26:38] you was packing water to a moonshine
[1:26:42] steel when he met the pillar of fire and
[1:26:45] was commissioned not to smoke not to
[1:26:48] drink or defile his body in any way come
[1:26:50] on sister destiny he was met and he was
[1:26:53] separated amen from the world to the
[1:26:57] word he was separated by the pillar of
[1:27:00] fire brother Wesley from the world to
[1:27:03] the word so he could stand in a pull pit
[1:27:06] and look at AA Allen and look at or
[1:27:08] robbers and look at all kinds of
[1:27:10] intellectual Giants and say come take
[1:27:12] your Bible and stand by my side you know
[1:27:15] why because he went beyond the
[1:27:19] limitations somebody shout it's time to
[1:27:21] go beyond
[1:27:23] it's time to go beyond the
[1:27:25] limitations brother said he's gone
[1:27:27] beyond the limitation amen have we SE in
[1:27:29] the Bible here's them that has wisdom
[1:27:32] not he that learned in some Seminary but
[1:27:34] what he can learn on his knees before
[1:27:38] God and what God pleased to give
[1:27:44] him is the sons of God made
[1:27:48] manifest so if we back off of the
[1:27:51] message and we back off of the anointing
[1:27:54] what's going to bring the church into
[1:27:56] the
[1:27:57] manifestation of the word of God
[1:28:00] Pentecost
[1:28:02] failed brother said it was a good shuck
[1:28:04] but it's dead see but listen God is all
[1:28:07] knowing so brother said I'm finite and
[1:28:10] he's infinite how many can say Amen so
[1:28:13] he cannot can have a few more minutes so
[1:28:15] he cannot make a mistake I can and you
[1:28:19] can our Brethren can Oh Glory to God
[1:28:25] well that's a good point right there
[1:28:27] amen I think that help a lot of
[1:28:28] preachers around this message is to
[1:28:30] realize amen that this message don't
[1:28:32] need your ministry your ministry needs
[1:28:35] this
[1:28:37] message come on church I'm just
[1:28:40] preaching the word when you can humble
[1:28:43] yourself to the message preacher Deacon
[1:28:46] or lay member and say I'm wrong but a
[1:28:49] prophet is right you can move from the
[1:28:52] confusion of the Shu into the presence
[1:28:54] of the Sun and let it bake all the
[1:28:57] greenness out of you and then the
[1:28:59] prophet said we can stand today and say
[1:29:02] I don't know more than I did last year
[1:29:04] I'm not progressing any he said but God
[1:29:06] cannot progress because he is perfect to
[1:29:10] begin
[1:29:11] with can I tell you what the devil's
[1:29:13] Desiring to do and I'm just going to I'm
[1:29:15] going to just just put it low gear and
[1:29:16] plow for a second the devil is Desiring
[1:29:19] to stunt your growth and he will go to
[1:29:22] any extreme he has to to do what he
[1:29:25] wants to do brother B said watch he said
[1:29:28] the church can never progress until it
[1:29:31] knows what grounds it's progressing on
[1:29:35] again 1962 returning Jubilee the church
[1:29:39] was to go on to the full promise the
[1:29:41] church tonight should be in her Splendor
[1:29:44] of Glory she should be waiting for the
[1:29:46] coming of the Lord instead of that she's
[1:29:48] scattered everywhere wondering which is
[1:29:49] right is this right is that right I'll
[1:29:51] join this I go over here and down there
[1:29:53] oh return and get away from those
[1:29:58] things and I can I go on you see that
[1:30:02] the progress of the church has followed
[1:30:05] the progress of time listen can I can I
[1:30:07] give you a prophetic announcement we've
[1:30:10] changed from airplane to
[1:30:14] astronaut we have changed from airplane
[1:30:18] to astronaut there's got to be a change
[1:30:21] and we've seen the three changes come in
[1:30:23] the progress of Transportation of power
[1:30:26] it's always an added power an added
[1:30:28] power an added power keep more and more
[1:30:31] and more why don't the airplane get up
[1:30:33] there it hasn't got the power to do it
[1:30:36] it isn't built for it amen it couldn't
[1:30:39] do it but the astronaut has the power so
[1:30:42] do we just stay in the airplane and
[1:30:44] sympathize with the airplane and feel
[1:30:46] sorry for the airplane no we're ordained
[1:30:49] brother Jared to get out of the airplane
[1:30:51] and get in the astronaut and go beyond
[1:30:54] the
[1:30:56] limitations come on church he said
[1:30:59] listen the tues in it has the
[1:31:04] power so when he gets in there he don't
[1:31:07] put the power in it the power's already
[1:31:10] in
[1:31:12] it oh God the power is already in it
[1:31:15] come on Church you're not adding power
[1:31:18] to this message the power is already in
[1:31:20] it
[1:31:23] come on when you get in the Astron the
[1:31:25] only thing he does is just get in there
[1:31:27] and sit still and watch all the
[1:31:31] Dows the power that lifted off the Earth
[1:31:34] is already in
[1:31:37] it again horse and buggy was Earthbound
[1:31:40] but now we're in an astronaut age and so
[1:31:43] has the church that's the big swing over
[1:31:46] that I cannot get before the people
[1:31:48] they've settled
[1:31:50] down for an
[1:31:53] airplane some of them for a horse and
[1:31:55] buggy but God's got an astronaut
[1:32:00] age what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:32:03] saying don't settle for nothing less
[1:32:06] than what God has ordained for you to
[1:32:08] have the devil has another way to
[1:32:10] pervert he said see the devil perverted
[1:32:13] let you think to satisfy your guilty
[1:32:14] conscience that you go join a church and
[1:32:17] you're all right that's wrong that's
[1:32:19] perverting you cannot get satisf faction
[1:32:22] amen by joining a church you only become
[1:32:25] mental it's an intellectual
[1:32:28] Affair can I tell you what a prophet
[1:32:30] said if the devil can get you out on
[1:32:34] those things he'll take you to this
[1:32:36] other but don't settle for nothing
[1:32:41] less than an oldfashioned experience of
[1:32:44] the new birth to be born again of the
[1:32:47] spirit of the Eternal God when your soul
[1:32:50] and God you unites together and you
[1:32:53] become one in other words the prophet is
[1:32:57] saying don't settle for a horse in buggy
[1:33:00] age don't settle for for an automobile
[1:33:02] age don't settle for an astronaut listen
[1:33:05] Church there's an as there's a there's
[1:33:07] an astronaut to go get into that'll take
[1:33:10] us Beyond where we're at
[1:33:12] now now if you study the Bible and I'm
[1:33:14] going to hurry through these points
[1:33:16] because I I want to lay something in
[1:33:17] here in Exodus 33:7 the Bible says that
[1:33:20] Moses took the Tabernacle
[1:33:22] and pitched it without the camp right a
[1:33:24] far off from the camp and called it the
[1:33:27] Tabernacle of the congregation and it
[1:33:29] came to pass that everyone which s the
[1:33:32] Lord went out into the Tabernacle of the
[1:33:35] congregation which was without the camp
[1:33:38] in the Book of Numbers the Bible says
[1:33:41] that the that the sacrifice was taken
[1:33:43] without the
[1:33:44] camp and there was the Waters of
[1:33:47] Separation now watch the prophet picked
[1:33:49] this up and going be on the camp he said
[1:33:51] said Jesus suffer out the gate he said
[1:33:53] seek to sanctify the people with his own
[1:33:55] blood sanctification comes from a Greek
[1:33:57] word which means cleansed and set aside
[1:34:00] for service now watch this in the Garden
[1:34:03] of Eden amen God established his camp
[1:34:06] for his people how many believes that he
[1:34:08] fortified his people in his camp now
[1:34:11] watch God's camp and God's fortification
[1:34:14] was this stay with the word regardless
[1:34:19] of what anybody else does you set
[1:34:21] separate from everything else but you
[1:34:23] stay with the word now the pro of God
[1:34:26] said that Satan amen is taking his
[1:34:28] people the other way he's taking them
[1:34:30] beyond the camp amen but God is taking
[1:34:33] his people this other way see Satan is
[1:34:36] taking his people beyond the camp of
[1:34:38] Reason beyond the camp of Common Sense
[1:34:40] beyond the camp of common decency see
[1:34:42] where the devil's taking them he's
[1:34:44] taking them into a camp of
[1:34:48] denomination but God's Camp is different
[1:34:51] from a denominational Camp the Bible
[1:34:54] says let every man's word be a lie and
[1:34:56] mind the truth heavens and earth will
[1:34:58] pass away but my word shall never pass
[1:35:01] away see they go beyond the camp of
[1:35:03] God's word to find their answer now
[1:35:06] we're seeing where the confusion comes
[1:35:08] from is when they go Bey on the camp of
[1:35:10] God's word which is the message to find
[1:35:13] their answer he said people are
[1:35:15] persuaded of their dogmas and Creeds
[1:35:17] without the camp in their Camp of Dogman
[1:35:19] and Creed they have a camp also soul
[1:35:21] that puts them in this Camp his is the
[1:35:24] camp of Education theology Works
[1:35:26] doctor's degree educational personality
[1:35:29] everything that's against God's word
[1:35:34] camp but God is not going to leave you
[1:35:36] in that
[1:35:39] camp he's going to bring you unto
[1:35:42] himself to manifest the full stature of
[1:35:45] his promises in this age let me say it
[1:35:47] like this do you realize Moses was in
[1:35:50] the camp of Egyptians he was in
[1:35:52] Pharaoh's Camp brother said he was in
[1:35:54] his own Camp tending his father's sheep
[1:35:56] right he said and the pillar of fire
[1:35:58] come down and met Moses and Moses come
[1:36:01] out of his camp and got into God's Camp
[1:36:04] when Moses separated from his Camp over
[1:36:07] to God's Camp brother BR said now watch
[1:36:10] he said what did he do he said he went
[1:36:12] out there and saddled up a mule put his
[1:36:15] wife and baby on there and they said
[1:36:17] where you going Moses he said I'm going
[1:36:19] down to Egypt to take over he said a
[1:36:22] Onan Invasion now listen here's Israel
[1:36:26] in the bondage of the Egyptians and here
[1:36:28] comes Moses into that camp with the camp
[1:36:32] of God's word and says listen church he
[1:36:35] says watch when Moses came down the
[1:36:37] Vindicated word of God was at hand God
[1:36:40] made the promise he was there to deliver
[1:36:43] the people they moved from the camp they
[1:36:45] were in into the camp of God's
[1:36:50] promised into the camp of God's promised
[1:36:54] word of this hour listen they left their
[1:36:56] natural Camp they left the mud Camp they
[1:36:59] left the camp made with straw and brick
[1:37:01] and dwell in tents in the wilderness
[1:37:03] there was no grain or nothing else
[1:37:05] listen but what was God doing he was
[1:37:07] separating them because advancement
[1:37:10] requires
[1:37:13] separation now can I can I tie this
[1:37:15] together brother said watch he said one
[1:37:18] day God said Moses separate yourself
[1:37:21] from
[1:37:22] them so what did he do he separated
[1:37:25] Moses and Dayan and cor went right on
[1:37:29] and he swallowed them up in the gain
[1:37:30] Sands of cor he said now watch the same
[1:37:33] things have happened today that man made
[1:37:37] himself a camp amen a camp of creed and
[1:37:40] tradition and not God's Camp of his word
[1:37:43] see a camp of their own can can I can I
[1:37:46] can I bring this down he had to leave
[1:37:49] them for he is the word can I say this
[1:37:51] this he cannot stay where people are
[1:37:54] taught out of this
[1:37:56] word so the very minute you begin to
[1:37:59] teach out of this message is the very
[1:38:02] minute that God leaves the
[1:38:05] camp and the prophet said he cannot stay
[1:38:08] in that camp he never did he must stay
[1:38:10] exactly where his word is can I ask you
[1:38:13] what put him out of the camp what put
[1:38:16] him out of the camp brother B said their
[1:38:18] Traditions their Traditions put on the
[1:38:21] outside he said they let the Traditions
[1:38:24] take the place of the word of God he
[1:38:26] said may I say this with love and
[1:38:28] respect but to drive it home it's the
[1:38:31] same thing today it hasn't changed a bit
[1:38:35] when he comes among the people it his
[1:38:37] power and manifestation to prove that
[1:38:39] his word is the
[1:38:41] same the people says a fortune teller a
[1:38:45] beyb a Jesus only listen but it has to
[1:38:49] be that way do you know what tra can I
[1:38:51] can I say this traditional teaching
[1:38:54] apart from the word literally crucifies
[1:38:57] the effect of the
[1:38:59] word Jesus said making the word of God
[1:39:03] of none effect through your tradition
[1:39:05] which you have delivered and many such
[1:39:07] things do you look at this word effect
[1:39:09] it is to deprive of force and Authority
[1:39:12] the prophet of God said watch he said
[1:39:14] here could it be possible that the
[1:39:16] Gentiles has did the same thing when
[1:39:19] they've had the church ages of the Son
[1:39:21] of God but when now the veil of this
[1:39:23] denomination and things this veil of
[1:39:25] tradition we've got since Pentecost when
[1:39:27] the church Traditions has been rent the
[1:39:30] things that people said the days of
[1:39:32] Miracles has passed these things don't
[1:39:34] happen listen it's been brought into
[1:39:36] Plain View and they're ready to crucify
[1:39:39] it
[1:39:41] again now don't get mad at me but
[1:39:43] they're not taking this message to
[1:39:45] baptist pull pits and crucifying
[1:39:48] it they're not taking it to Pentecost
[1:39:51] lost the pull pits and crucified it but
[1:39:53] they're laying it on message pulpits and
[1:39:56] crucifying the effect of the message of
[1:39:59] listen I believe in the mechanics but
[1:40:01] pray tell me when is the Dynamics going
[1:40:03] to
[1:40:05] come well don't get mad at me they're
[1:40:07] already here and you know what I believe
[1:40:10] I believe our young people ought to know
[1:40:12] there's more to this thing than a bunch
[1:40:14] of mechanics and a bunch of intellectual
[1:40:16] gatherings I think they ought to know
[1:40:17] there's some
[1:40:19] fire I think they ought to know there's
[1:40:21] some power and some manifestation come
[1:40:23] on I think our young people didn't know
[1:40:25] what it's like to get lost in the
[1:40:29] spirit well brother Andrew you're
[1:40:31] getting way out there am I really y'all
[1:40:33] forgive me I'm struggling with my voice
[1:40:35] Jesus the word came on the scene he was
[1:40:38] a fugitive to his own see he went beyond
[1:40:41] the camp B said why they confess him is
[1:40:44] because their Camp can I can I close on
[1:40:47] this the reason they would not confess
[1:40:49] him is because they Camp had set its
[1:40:52] boundaries it wouldn't let him in the
[1:40:56] camp and it wouldn't let anybody go out
[1:40:58] too him they had their own camp but when
[1:41:01] he come among them I love this he was a
[1:41:04] breaker of their
[1:41:08] tradition brother Joe when he come among
[1:41:11] them he was a breaker of their tradition
[1:41:13] he did not come in there and agree with
[1:41:16] their tradition he came in there and
[1:41:18] broke their tradition because was some
[1:41:23] seed the proud of God said there's only
[1:41:25] one place he can go and that's under the
[1:41:27] shed blood now brother Andrew what are
[1:41:28] you getting that can I show you very
[1:41:30] plain Jesus was a breaker of
[1:41:33] tradition the Bible says in John 6 he
[1:41:36] said I am the bread right I am the bread
[1:41:39] brother B said Harvest time he said when
[1:41:42] Jesus said that was at the Feast of
[1:41:45] Passover they were standing there
[1:41:47] brother Wesley holding kosher in
[1:41:50] commemoration of the Mana that come out
[1:41:52] of the heavens in the wilderness they
[1:41:54] were drinking water from some rock and
[1:41:56] Jesus stood up in their
[1:41:58] midst and you know what he said he said
[1:42:01] I am the bread of life I am the water
[1:42:04] that came out of the Rock and they
[1:42:06] everyone rose up to Stone him do you
[1:42:08] know why because at one time that
[1:42:11] kulture was a blessed symbol but now it
[1:42:14] had become a blinding
[1:42:18] Tradition at one time it was a blessing
[1:42:21] to hold that culture amen but now the
[1:42:23] blessing has moved from the from the
[1:42:25] partial realization into the perfect
[1:42:28] realization church of living God don't
[1:42:30] get mad at me tonight amen but at one
[1:42:33] time it was good to be in the shuck amen
[1:42:35] but the seed has G forth from the shuck
[1:42:38] and now there's a bride that's not imp
[1:42:41] partial realization she is in the
[1:42:43] Perfection of the Perfection of the word
[1:42:45] of
[1:42:48] God now I know what you're saying and
[1:42:51] you're saying brother Andrew Jesus was a
[1:42:52] traditional breaker amen but am I well
[1:42:54] this what the prophet said he said let
[1:42:56] your faith in him who is the word
[1:42:58] revelation 19 when he comes he's going
[1:43:00] to be called the word of God riding up
[1:43:01] on a white horse and the followers of
[1:43:03] heaven will be behind
[1:43:05] him have I got any followers of Heaven
[1:43:09] they'll be behind him he said now watch
[1:43:11] break the denominational veil of
[1:43:14] tradition break those veils that's
[1:43:16] hiding from you break those veils of
[1:43:18] Pride you women your King's Daughters
[1:43:20] act like it live like it break every
[1:43:23] Veil no matter what PhD and lld says if
[1:43:26] it's contrary to the Bible break through
[1:43:29] that Veil and you will see if you'll
[1:43:32] just do that them old traditions and
[1:43:34] things and come to him you'll see him
[1:43:36] standing the mighty conquer the word
[1:43:38] promise of this age made manifest you'll
[1:43:41] see the Mighty God unveiled right here
[1:43:44] Among Us unveiled the Mighty God
[1:43:47] unconquered by traditions
[1:43:52] what are you saying brander I'm saying
[1:43:55] Traditions are
[1:43:57] barriers which become
[1:44:01] limitations but they've got to be broke

[1:44:29] have time to read it I got to preach it
[1:44:31] Abraham is filling a
[1:44:33] pool this separation is not coming from

[1:45:54] out to find this city do you realize
[1:45:57] that they never found that City they
[1:45:59] never saw that City but the prophet said
[1:46:02] the very place where the city will sit
[1:46:05] is the very place that MDC served
[1:46:09] communion to
[1:46:11] Abraham are you hearing me there was a
[1:46:14] call and it was a strange call but it
[1:46:17] was a call to go beyond it was a call to
[1:46:19] go beyond your comfort zone it was a
[1:46:22] call to go beyond what you're used to
[1:46:24] listen there's a city let me just go
[1:46:26] ahead and say it amen I can't sit down

[1:46:34] city and it's a real City and it's
[1:46:37] calling my name it's calling your name

[1:46:54] city as our musicians are coming it's a
[1:46:58] call it's a call to
[1:47:00] separate it's a call to go beyond the
[1:47:03] limitations R said when we go beyond our
[1:47:06] own sound
[1:47:07] barrier into the word of God then it's
[1:47:10] unlimited what God can do with a
[1:47:15] man that's ready to go beyond the
[1:47:18] camp the camp of man that is
[1:47:20] is now listen
[1:47:23] church God he sets
[1:47:27] boundaries for his
[1:47:29] people God sets
[1:47:31] boundaries don't ever forget
[1:47:34] this God sets
[1:47:37] boundaries Satan sets
[1:47:42] barriers brother Tom God sets
[1:47:45] boundaries but Satan sets barriers you
[1:47:49] know what those barriers prayers
[1:47:51] are they're an obstacle that will
[1:47:54] prevent you from
[1:47:55] moving or
[1:48:00] excessing so there's something out there
[1:48:03] for
[1:48:04] you there's something
[1:48:07] more there's more
[1:48:09] Revelation there's more understanding
[1:48:12] there's more Victory there's more
[1:48:14] anointing there's more
[1:48:17] power it's out there but there's a
[1:48:20] barrier stopping
[1:48:22] you
[1:48:24] right but the prophet
[1:48:26] said break down every barrier throw away
[1:48:31] all self and surrender that once Supreme
[1:48:35] surrender to the Lord
[1:48:37] Jesus again I've got to nail it down or

[1:48:41] this greatest display of the presence of
[1:48:42] the Holy Ghost here tonight be on the
[1:48:44] shadow of a doubt Bible evidence what

[1:48:52] this and I'm going to dedicate it to
[1:48:54] these meetings this
[1:48:56] weekend there's a mighty rushing wind
[1:49:00] trying to get into the audience and to
[1:49:02] fill Every Soul here with the presence
[1:49:05] of
[1:49:06] God don't let Satan take it away from
[1:49:09] you hold on to it till you've passed the
[1:49:13] barriers of
[1:49:15] unbelief you said brother Andrew why
[1:49:17] would you dedicate that to the meetings

[1:53:19] that you're Bible says Lord that by
[1:53:21] faith Abraham set out to find that City
[1:53:25] Lord by
[1:53:26] Revelation Abraham separated himself to
[1:53:30] follow you because Lord you didn't
[1:53:34] separate him to leave him in the minimum
[1:53:37] you separate him to bring him into the
[1:53:39] fullness and Lord I believe there's a
[1:53:41] group of people here tonight Lord father
[1:53:44] you've called them you've elected them

[1:54:16] and let the devil make us feel like
[1:54:18] we're trespassers when we move into the
[1:54:21] revelation of this
[1:54:22] message Father I refuse to let the devil
[1:54:25] scare me out of the good things that God
[1:54:28] has revealed in this end time word
[1:54:31] father I know there's been many voices
[1:54:32] throughout the ages throughout the last
[1:54:35] days has said all this message is the
[1:54:37] truth and God sent a prophet and it's a
[1:54:40] it's a powerful message brother Brandon
[1:54:42] was a prophet he had a Healing Ministry
[1:54:45] he could discern the thoughts and
[1:54:46] intents of the heart but Lord they never
[1:54:49] want to move move over into that third
[1:54:50] pool they never want to move over there
[1:54:53] where all the promises are laying they
[1:54:55] won't want to move over there where
[1:54:56] there's rights for them as the Believers
[1:54:59] they're scared they become too deep or I
[1:55:02] can't understand that there it's not for
[1:55:04] me Lord I pray tonight dear God that you
[1:55:06] would open up every
[1:55:08] heart Lord you would go in the depths of
[1:55:10] that heart and Lord you would place a
[1:55:13] craving in there a craving for the word
[1:55:16] of God a craving for the message of the
[1:55:19] hour a craving for the super Hallelujah
[1:55:22] for the
[1:55:24] supernatural Lord may it not just be
[1:55:26] something they hear on Sunday May it not
[1:55:29] just be something they listen to on
[1:55:30] Wednesday but father May every day they
[1:55:33] feed on this message and as they feed on
[1:55:36] it they're growing they're going beyond
[1:55:39] the
[1:55:40] limitations they're going beyond the
[1:55:42] barriers they're moving into
[1:55:45] manifestation they're moving into

[1:56:38] Conference I believe in these Bible
[1:56:41] conferences my life was changed forever
[1:56:44] in the first one 10 years
[1:56:46] ago it was in that meeting that God
[1:56:50] performed a heart
[1:56:52] surgery and put a craving in my life for
[1:56:56] the revelation of this word like never
[1:56:59] before you say brother well you're a
[1:57:02] preacher you needed that you needed that
[1:57:05] no I was a Believer and a Christian

[1:57:10] preacher you say brother Ander I'm just
[1:57:12] a young lady or just a housewife but can
[1:57:15] I tell you tonight you need that craving
[1:57:18] for the Revel ation to this word because
[1:57:21] it's what you're going to take a Rapture
[1:57:23] by how many can say tonight Lord I'm
[1:57:27] ready for that Grace that Paul spoke
[1:57:28] about to establish my
[1:57:31] heart I'm ready to lay aside things if I
[1:57:34] got to if I got to set aside this
[1:57:36] activity and if I got to separate from
[1:57:38] this activity Lord I want to eat on this
[1:57:41] word I want to feed on this word till it

[1:58:09] tonight and declare to that devil that
[1:58:11] the Lord did not bring us as far as he
[1:58:13] has to leave us Lord you didn't justify
[1:58:16] us just to leave us you didn't sanctify
[1:58:18] us just to leave us you didn't just fill
[1:58:21] us with the Holy Ghost to leave us but
[1:58:23] Lord you've called us to move into that
[1:58:25] Perfection of your word father to feed
[1:58:27] upon the Mana to feed upon this message
[1:58:30] Lord father as I heard your Prophet say
[1:58:33] this week he said I get tired as a
[1:58:35] preacher sometimes he said I don't feel
[1:58:37] like going out on the road and preaching
[1:58:39] he said I get real weary in my body and
[1:58:41] tired in my spirit he said but then I
[1:58:43] get in there and I get to feeding on
[1:58:45] this mana and he said it just puts such
[1:58:47] a great capacity in me he said that I
[1:58:49] just got to go tell somebody about it
[1:58:51] Lord father I pray tonight dear God that
[1:58:54] that capacity would come into every

[2:17:44] barriers you know what a barrier is a
[2:17:47] barrier is an obstacle that prevents you
[2:17:49] from movement it's an obstacle that
[2:17:51] prevents you from having access to
[2:17:53] something but I thank God that he sent
[2:17:56] something that we could break through
[2:17:57] the barrier isn't it wonderful how
[2:18:00] many's broke through it tonight let me I
[2:18:02] don't know if you ever seen a seen them
[2:18:04] horses get out there and line up to race
[2:18:06] you know what they put the horses behind
[2:18:08] before they run the race a
[2:18:10] barrier and after a little bit that old
[2:18:13] bell will ring when the bell rings the
[2:18:15] guy in charge he'll he'll break the
[2:18:16] barrier loose
[2:18:18] and you've never seen 1500 lb of muscle
[2:18:21] come out of a out of a chute that's been
[2:18:23] locked up and he's been he was born to
[2:18:25] run everything in his blood he was bred
[2:18:27] to run but he's been tied up and in a
[2:18:29] stall and everything in him they hold
[2:18:31] him back until race day comes then they
[2:18:34] March him out in front of a bunch of
[2:18:36] people and lock you behind the barrier
[2:18:38] and everything in him is what they they
[2:18:40] buck and fight and snort in there cuz
[2:18:42] something on the inside of them wants to
[2:18:44] run and finally the barrier gets broken
[2:18:48] and Buddy they come out there ain't
[2:18:49] nothing could stop them brother Mark
[2:18:51] that's what God's done for us we're not
[2:18:53] we're not just a bunch of mixed breed up
[2:18:55] thing bunch of a bunch of Believers but
[2:18:57] we're thoroughbreds amen you're thorough
[2:19:00] breads you're a pure seed of God and
[2:19:02] you're made to run amen I believe we
[2:19:04] ought to run this race we got a we got a
[2:19:06] word tonight that said we have the the
[2:19:08] power to run this race the Liberty to
[2:19:10] run this race amen I want to know how
[2:19:12] many's going to run it with me amen I
[2:19:14] believe I believe we're in good hands
[2:19:16] tonight that's what the prophet said he
[2:19:18] said God left us in good hands he didn't
[2:19:20] leave you in the hands of some
[2:19:21] priesthood or something that that the
[2:19:23] ministers are all up higher above the
[2:19:25] people and there's this hierarchy and
[2:19:26] all this he said but he left them in
[2:19:28] good hands of God-fearing men that love
[2:19:30] the Lord and and they'll preach the word
[2:19:32] of God and the and they're servants to
[2:19:34] the people they know their place they
[2:19:37] don't lift themselves up above people
[2:19:39] God's left us in those kind of hands
[2:19:41] that we could follow the Holy Ghost and
[2:19:43] I believe that's the desire of our heart
[2:19:45] we may all make mistakes we fail some
[2:19:47] sometimes we we get we say things we
[2:19:49] don't mean to say but our heart is right
