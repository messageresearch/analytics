feeling well also for Leah Scott asking for prayer uh she had had some um uh some complications with her neck surgery that she had I believe that that I know she's had it twice and maybe a third time already but uh the doctors are looking at what they have to do going forward and uh so she's been in a lot of pain just ask the church to remember her in prayer I know that you know sometimes when you don't even but John said the doctor kind of looked at the situation said I really don't even know what to do at this point you know looking at the x-rays and MRIs and the way things had had been and and uh so they were just praying I know she has to go back to the doctor in a few days uh praying that the doctor or the the Lord would give that doctor some wisdom on how to handle this I believe that God is able I I don't I'm not going to settle for a lady in her uh early 30s uh to to be Liv in pain the rest of her life and all that so I believe we as have a right as a body of Believers uh to call upon on the Lord on on her behalf and ask the Lord to touch her body and and continue to move in that situation so maybe we'll just bow our heads tonight if you have a need on your heart just lift your hand to the Lord and and ask him to come and just prepare for the word of God tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord we so are thankful Lord for all that you've done for us and Lord we're

blessing for you tonight and I know the Lord can move in a special way tonight and I'd uh I've been around long enough to know he can show up and show out anytime he wants for we could just get ourselves out of the way just a little bit God can step in to do the miraculous somebody can leave here different tonight how many believes that amen God bless you if you got your Bibles I invite you to Ephesians chapter one we've been ministering on I give you the land for the last several times we've been with you and and U I was sharing with brother match is we've been ministering this out some and uh still burning our heart we uh Minister and then other things drop in and we we uh we get inspired all over again so we'd like to retitle it our subtitle tonight anointed for victory the vision chapter 1 verse one says Paul and Apostle Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from our God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so this didn't occur in time this was something that took took place in the eternities amen aren't you thankful for that oh yeah he chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he has made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace where he has abounded uh toward us in wisdom in all wisdom and Prudence have made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispens of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will can you say praise the Lord amen what a what a powerful passage of scripture right there am amen can we just bow our hearts one more time and if you got a need just just make it known to the Lord I know he's more than able to minister to each and every one of our needs this evening Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for such a time as this Lord Lord that we can come and rally around your precious word tonight father we pray Lord God that you'll come and anoint us AR fresh one more time lord lord anoint these ears of clay the lips of clay Lord God this evening Lord God that we place this time into your hands Lord we believe great things could transpire in this church service tonight Lord God we place it into your hands Lord God Lord with us Lord things are po possible Lord it might seem impossible father but with you all things are possible Lord and that's what Believers believe tonight Lord we commit this time into your hands heal the sick and Afflicted Lord in Jesus Christ's wonderful name and the bride says amen God bless you this this beautiful evening amen just uh looking forward thank you brother Matt to uh to uh ministering the gospel tonight and and that if you come with that same expectation I believe the Lord can move in a in a mighty way and amen I you know I believe every church service could be a be a Revival whether it's shouting screaming dancing or just the simple the word coming forth and and ministering to your hearts and changing your life changing situations and uh I believe that's what it's about the gospel is able to change lives and and uh when uh Matt and I was visiting about uh over five years ago we was ministering in his house and we was talking about some visions and that was our vision that was our goal you know to to to further the gospel when souls to the kingdom of God and here we are and and the Lord's been blessed and great Tabernacle amen what a beautiful meeting we had and people gathering around from all kinds of places and then and joining our LS of fire together I I think we're blessed people tonight amen we want to look tonight just for a few moments tonight on anointed for victory and I was looking through some of the things brother Brandon was saying on on the the anointed and of course he takes you many times a messiah is the anointed had one and that all that was in God was imorph or emptied out into his son Jesus Christ all that God was was emptied out in his son and all that Jesus was was emptied out in a many member bride and and he was the anointed one he was a god power he had a he had God Authority he had everywhere he went he was blessed everywhere uh Christ went he conquered amen why because he was anointed for the age that he was living in he was anointed with a god anointing and God power and now brother Brown would say it like this he was the anointed one he was the Messiah he said but now we're dealing with messes our little messiah's anointed brother Brown said with the same spirit and we realize he talk he takes you back to to if that same spirit that dwelled in Christ Jesus dwells in you is going to Quicken or make a alive your mortal bodies as same as it did his now he said well Joshua was you know Joshua the Book of Joshua was a was Ephesians of the Old Testament it was a book of redemption he said it had two parts of coming out and going into and and and what a great Jubilee Exodus that is and and we believe now that we cannot lose our inheritance amen nothing in time God listen friends amen it doesn't matter matter if your church finds you worthy doesn't matter if your pastor finds you worthy amen what's important tonight if God found you worthy before the foundation of the world Amen and and Ephesian was ministering on this amen that he found you worthy amen before there was a foundation of the world before there was Stars before there was a Milky Way before there was a hell before there was this generation called the world Amen you were was existing in the mind of God and he found you worthy and nothing in time could ever erase it nothing in time can happen to cause you to lose your inheritance cuz brother R says like this we got an inheritance and our inheritance belongs to us listen he he he as he begins to quote Ephesians inheritance by predes ination he said I inherited something there had to be somebody to leave me inheritance he said why are you say Jesus left your inheritance he said I beg your pardon Jesus never left your inheritance Jesus never left your inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance and he brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the L's book of life before the foundation of the world they said God gave you your inheritance and your inheritance Brother David was first God sent Jesus he said to make the inheritance real to you and I hallelujah amen so that's that's a reason that's a purpose of him condescending down cuz God had in his mind amen before there was a world brother Tom he had your name amen he written your name down and brother Brown said this amen that God's word can never go out void it's got to accomplish it's got to come back to him and render successfully because God's word is undefeatable it can't be stopped nothing can prevent it from coming to the pass Satan has tried it for 6,000 years how's that worked out for him every time God spoken word with forth God Vindicated it by bringing it to pass yes sir Hallelujah and it can never return void and the message of the hour would set like this before the foundation of the world God wrote your name no wonder Luke 10: 20 says not rejoicing because Spirits are subject to you but Rejoice because your name was written in the L's book of life before the foundation of the world your inheritance was first Rejoice no something in time can reduce it oh that should make us all happy tonight nothing that you was trapped into in time can reduce your inheritance nothing in time can take away what God gave you in the eternities remember even as we Minister many times in this little series amen they that that the Jubilee sounded amen they got a right to go back to their inheritance the squaders was their time was limited because they received it by something that transpired in time amen but when they heard the Jubilee trumpet amen the individual had the right to go back to take back what rightly belonged to him amen listen friends God's word can never be defeated before there was an accuser God already B acted up in the heavens brother R says therefore the bride the rure come forth there is all pre-planned of God listen to this little statement it's all backed up from the beginning hey Ben he said nobody came Jesus didn't come to to leave you in inheritance you already had the inheritance it was first it was all backed up in the heavens it was all pre-planned by God by his for knowledge he can preach destinate you to to to become sons of God Amen oh that's that's what the message of the hour declared to us amen you came from God you came from God and you're in time amen but that that the time can't hold you amen but for a season turn me up just a little bit amen listen amen no matter what you've gone through we've got some dark time times in our lives amen we've all got past we don't want to be connected to any longer just keep that in your mind tonight cuz we're going somewhere with that thought tonight but remember last time or the uh the time before brother Matt when I tried to get brother Noah that $100 bill and he didn't act too excited his pockets are kind of full amen but yeah I offered him to him and no matter what I done to it it didn't uh uh devalue the worth of that bill I crumbled it I stomped on it but after all that you still want said yes I still want it why because it still had value nothing I could do to the $100 bill made it lose its value because it was all backed up by some goat somewhere h Hallelujah and thank God we had a message of the hour to come and tell you friends amen you got inheritance by predestination and it's all backed up in the heavens and nothing in time can separate you from The Inheritance God gave it to you hallelujah what a message of the hour to let us know amen we came from God and we're going back to God hallelujah and he says all Devils out of hell can't erase it out of there go ahead Give the Lord praise for that one tonight amen all Devils out of hell can erase your inheritance tonight yes sir hallelujah what a sound of Freedom tonight and then he says brother Noah God wrote it and he spoke it he Hallelujah he spoke your name before there was a world aen knowing it can never come back void I say tonight by the message of the hour amen you're anointed for victory tonight amen and nothing in time can separate you from The Inheritance that God gave you before the foundation of the world nothing can steal your sunship that's right Hallelujah Exodus tells us by little by little I'll drive them out from before thee I'm going to make a way when it looks impossible how many serves a god like that until th be increase inherit the land and I will set the bounds from the sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines and from the desert unto the river for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee he he's the our author and our finisher the beauty of this brother Travis God never starts anything he doesn't have the ability to finish he's the author and the finisher whatever he starts he always finishes amen whatever he loses he always finds he come to seek and to save that which was lost our God it's impossible for him to lose one of his we've been engraved into the pal of his hands hallelujah amen he can't forget you I don't care how deep in sin you might want to go amen Our God who's rich in Mercy David tells us Psalm 23 my God will pursue after you he'll go to the darkest jungles to the depths of the sea amen Our God cannot lose a one of you you think you can run fast enough my God can find you he would Trace you down because he can't lose one of his Darkness might try to hold on to you for a season but he can't hold you that much longer hey let me tell you I was going to get to this part but his days are numbered Hallelujah his days are numbered when God sends a Exodus without doubt brother Mark without doubt or fear someone is coming out and somebody is going in what a that's a beauty that's the beauty of it tonight that's the beauty of the Jubilee Exodus amen so the same anointing with the same power that couldn't stop Moses as a oneman Invasion going down to Egypt as she started the Exodus of telling Pharaoh let my people go Moses couldn't defeat pharaoh and his army on his own ability but he was anointed for this amen no matter what Pharaoh tried to do Aben Moses superseded it Aben why because he was working under the authority of almighty God hallelujah amen so the first part of the Exodus we see the mighty hand God taking them out of the task Master's hands out of the beadings and the scars down of Egypt and we see the journey all the way through the Wilderness even to the place will it come time with Moses and I'm not going to elaborate on these things got a lot of things to get to tonight don't let that scare you amen but even to the place brother Matt when he Moses says let's collect 10 great men to go out and spy the land amen so they send those spies out with Joshua and Caleb why would he send these two men cuz he's going to have a witness he's going to have somebody's going to to to perform his word cuz he's already begun Exodus and if he starts in Exodus he's not just the god at the beginning and the end but he is the god in the in between Hallelujah and when they came back and they begin to give their testimonies and how the 10 says they're Giants in that land the sons of anoch is in that land we look at they was looking in the mirror and they begin to look at theirselves by look besides looking in the mirror of God's word the word are we already spoke they were amen but these men begin to look at the mirror of their own selves and begin to say we look like grasshoppers in their sight in other words we can't defeat them and no doubt they were speaking from a reality because they was looking at their own s and forgetting God's principles but they still had a witness he still had a Joshua and Caleb amen and after they heard all the negtive report it didn't stop their their their testimony yes sir what did Joshua and Caleb say brother we are more than able to take the land in other words he's saying the same God that brought us out of Egypt is the same God here's the evidence God's not dead he's still alive he's This Is Our Land this is our inheritance yes sir now if you'll notice this tie is getting on my nerves if you don't notice I told my wife it's too thick she said it's okay she said it didn't match but that's okay so don't blame her if I got blue on my pants but God's good isn't he but you realize I said all of that dealing with the Exodus to say this Caleb's response never changed no matter what he seen no matter what was transpiring amen no matter where he was in the journey Caleb no wonder the scripture said there's another Spirit within him that he was anointed for victory and we find him oh I could take a whole service on this amen we find him in this time of fixing of the to embrace heon which it it was Caleb's inheritance that was inhabitance there was Giants in his land the sons of angc was inhabitants of heon but it did not stop Caleb and his response never changed the same God that gave him the response why he's following the message of the hour he was anointed under the message of the hour and the same God that was in between the same God that was down Egypt is the same God is speak speaking and leading and guiding an 85 year old man that is dirt is wore out his dirt is worn tired wearied beat down batter scarred but his response give me my mouth m theyed heon in time Hallelujah and I cannot I cannot lose my inheritance it came from God he gave it to me in the heavens thank you Lord he said the same God that led me through Jericho the same God that led me through the Red Sea is the same God his response wasn't from feelings his response wasn't from emotions age didn't stop him he was anointed give me my Mountain could you imagine 85 year old man going down to Hein to take over Brother David these sons of an it nobody touched them nobody messed with them they thought that lamb was theirs amen there were some great things amen there was great there was some milk and honey there was some great rewards there was some benefits of living in Hein but it never there was never intended for them but when the anointed came in hallelujah amen it didn't take much amen it just took a willing believer to take God at his word amen somebody take what God has giving them amen he begin to take over say not today Devil he's a God of this Exodus Caleb could not Escape The Blessing Caleb's mentality was those giants days are numbered you've come this land long enough Hallelujah and I'm here to tell you he's the same God today amen that that old devil might have sneaked up on your land somewhere amen but he's come to the wrong place at the wrong time amen that that devil doesn't have a right to be there any longer it's not his property he's a squatter and he's a Blu tonight oh you got to begin to have a Caleb mentality the same God that brought me out is the same God's going to take me in remember last time we was here amen we we we we went through uh uh uh uh John where he says uh where the son has therefore shall make you free you should be free indeed and we talked about if I if I broke out of prison if I broke out of a prison amen and I I'd escaped alra whatever that may be in your life amen but I would always carry the chains of fear and doubt because I broke myself out I was Escape I always was wearied I always I I always would be wondering looking over my shoulder amen because my name is plastered out everywhere amen you could try to change your identity but it'll never take out the fact amen the law can bring you back to where you came from sir thank God for the message of the hour Amen to declare to you amen you're not an escape you're free indeed you're not just forgiven you're Justified as though you've never done it in the first place amen this world is not your home amen who the son has made free is free indeed the message of the hour scream out he says uh brother Joe he's your judge he's your attorney he's your jury and in this case that Satan has built up against you all your past all your failures all your shortcomings he's built such a case against you that it doesn't look like there's no hope in sight for you but we have a messenger in this age notified us amen he's our judge he's our jury he's my attorney amen the case is dismissed there is no case it's it's dismissed yes the dead is settled everything against it has been struck off we've got an abstract deed do you realize he said what that means it means brother that nothing can take it away from you oh go ahead and say Boo devil tonight there's nothing can take it away from you nothing in time can steal or reduce your inheritance tonight brother Mt didn't give it to you Grace Tabernacle didn't give give it to you Malachi 4 did not give it to you God our Father gave it to you before the foundation of the world don't Rejoice because Spirits are subject to you but Rejoice because God found favor of you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and your inheritance is by predestination nothing can take it away I'm a holder it's all backed up now listen to this now the message is he goes before us don't you like that brother says now the message is he goes before us he's not in a tomb behind us he's before us making a way so don't look back to the tombs that's what happened remember last time we was here we was talking about them dry bones after the sin You Came Upon them after they received that breath amen they sat there and they said they're saying this they're saying that they're saying there's no hope he said oh you're my people oh I will go down amen because they're my people I will I I will lift them up out of their graves hallelujah amen he said Don't Look Back to the tomb but look forward to where he's leading oh it's a sound of Celebration not retreat Hallelujah remember we're fighting from Victory that's what Ram SW there in Jericho was the act of Celebration though they were still walking around in time but it was already finished feel that way tonight Church Jericho is is falling and it hasn't even broke down yet it doesn't have a choice you know why brother Brown says this God's bloodbound promises makes us free it makes us free it doesn't we're not escapes he makes us free from sin self oh don't you love it tonight he sets you free from your worst enemy it's not your neighbor tonight amen it's right here amen I believe brother Donnie or someone hit that with over the weekend your worst enemy is not your neighbor amen your worst enemy is yourself but God's bloodbound promise comes to liberate you exonerate you dep parting you to release you to loosing you Hallelujah makes us free from anything of the world no matter how much we try to Fashion it the world it's all dead if we're in God's blood blound promises we see nothing but the blood it's by the blood tonight church I'm redeemed by the blood I'm secured by the blood I'm protected by the blood I'm Healed by the blood I'm justified by the blood oh Hallelujah the blood what a token it's all backed up listen he said one time I was his property how many can say Amen of that but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now see he come Hallelujah to loose the grip that Satan had upon her life loose the grip of sin that Satan was upon his life and now we're not his we're sealed with the Seal of Promise a promise of healing a promise of Deliverance a promise of Freedom a promise of Victory Hallelujah oh victory victory shall be mine oh just tell Satan to get thee behind you Hallelujah I've been bought with a price I've been loosed by anointing that fell the day at Calvary Jesus Christ Rob Satan I don't want to get get long before we get to our meet this evening Jesus Christ robbed Satan of everything tonight he stried him of everything he robbed him of everything listen he doesn't even have a key to his own house I'm here to tell I'm declaring to you Saints of Grace Tabernacle Satan is defeated he has no authority over a Believer the only place he has if we allow him in our lives I say it's time for Grace Tabernacle say Satan amen your days are numbered hallelujah amen it's time for you to get off of this property get off of my children's property oh I don't think he I don't think Satan believes it tonight but I'm here to make a Believer God's word is true he said resist the devil he'll have to run away from you he's been trying to break your homes up amen that's okay he came to the wrong place at the wrong time tonight amen I serve a God that's bigger than family problems it's bigger than financial problems I Ser God can put money in the fish's mouth if you need to pay a bill Heen he's the same yesterday today and forever I serve a God that knows all about your conversations and he can use a man of God over the weekend to come and Minister and talk your conversation that's the God I serve serve he's the god of the present he's not only the god of the past and the god of the future but he's Jehovah Gyra he's present right now to provide exactly what you need in your home hallelujah amen that's the God we serve tonight amen amen hallelujah do you love him he robbed Satan of everything that he had he spoiled principalities he spoiled Powers we're talking about the anointed one brother Morgan sound like Jesus was Unstoppable how many believe our savior was Unstoppable how many believes amen that Jesus conquered everywhere he went come his domain his domain Reigns over Heaven and Earth we're talking about our Lord and we we are the subject of his domain he's the Messiah we're Messiah amen we've been Anointed with the same life the same life bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his spirit Power of his power whether the me message notified us and said she is him we're subject of his domain hallelujah oh he said my that puts him where he belongs that puts Satan where he belongs the devil's down there go ahead and point down there tonight Satan's down there and Christ is the Victor now he says you Davids all right come on I'm not only talking about Brother David in the back Brother David but you Davids Goliath was undefeated he was an undefeated Soldier His Garment that he wore weighed more than David man would say it had a head like a worst tub fers like this what was he almost 10 foot tall David's a tall man but he's a lot taller than Brother David but death did it trap Jesus are you hearing me somebody it might have looked GRE bad in the day and the in the time it was transpiring but the death did not trap Jesus Jesus trapped death Hallelujah the the devil didn't trap David God trapped Goliath cuz brother R says every time the devil produces a Goliath he's got a David somewhere so what is he saying before there is a your enemy he's already got the anointed Hallelujah David before he even realized it was anointed for victory good he wasn't the most talented his brothers were a lot more talented could sing better than him could preach better than him there was better soldiers than he was they worked the swords better than he could but when Satan made his bluff All The Talented ran but the anointed fought are you hear me somebody tonight amen when everybody around us they might have a better Church they might have better pews they might had a better a better life in the natural Better Homes and Gardens but let me tell you when the poach comes to serve they're a bunch of cowards but the anointed they're possessed they are possessed with anointing to fight Hallelujah that's the reason why it came David's time he said I know they're running I know they're Head and Shoulders above me I know they had got me out class I know they're better Fighters than me but he says I'll go I'll go fight him I'll go I'll go I'll go I'll go I'll go do it you mean me yeah I'll go fight him oh I see some of these Davis in you tonight Heen when the odds are against you amen and you might not have a lot of talent amen but you're anointed to possess the gates of your enemy and you say I'll go I'll lift [Applause] my we have he said can we have some David you are Davids you're called elected anointed oh do we have some Davids in the house he said brother Brown you are David you're called elected anointed positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ which is the victim by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Goliath you are defeated Hallelujah and here comes David and we know the story I I love preaching on David but he picks up five smooth Stones this wasn't in my mess but we're going to say it inhow tonight F AI t h wrapped it around Jesus JF s us he said he went to the Goliath he ran to the battle every time Goliath would make their big boast but he would put it right back and but my Lord's greater my Lord's able to deliver you into my hands amen you're going to fall at my feet amen I'm going to take your weapon I'm going to destroy you I may look little in the eyes of the army oh but I'm anointed to be king and you're standing in the way of my Throne Hallelujah he was anointed for victory oh if he's anointed for victory and we're buried in Christ Jesus the one that defeated death the one defeated conquered hell hell couldn't hold him the tomb couldn't hold him nobody could stop him he's the great Victor he's the mighty conqueror what was he building a Powerhouse I don't care what anybody else thinks about you if you're filled and still with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are a Powerhouse you're made out of stuff that just can't be bluffed in other words nothing can stop you if they couldn't stop Jesus 2,000 years ago and he condescended down with the same power in a Min member bride I say the same power is still God and there's nothing in time could ever stop him amen we're not fighting for victory fighting from Victory amen and can I say it like this tonight we're still in time paint yourselves oh not brother Mark how many really pain yourself half y'all didn't do it just go ahead and paint yourselves come on brother Travis did it hurt still felt it didn't you you know why because you're still mortal you're still in time but they don't change what's happening in the Supernatural realm are you hearing me somebody aen this is it we're still in time just like in a football game amen right at the end there may be two minutes left a minute and 45 seconds left of the ball game but the opponent has exhausted all of his options he has no more timeouts he has no more nothing else to give and the other team goes into a victory formation yeah that's good yet there's still time on the clock but they're still rejoicing the crowd is cheering amen why because there the the opponent has exhausted all options they cannot stop them they can't prevent them from winning are you hearing me somebody he said Jesus J Christ conquered Satan's Trinity everything that you have need of even the Rapture is already within you we're still here in time but if you're a Believer seal with a baptism of I believe you're in Victory formation you can lose hallelujah what a be day so when hell says you can't make it on the contrary you know what contrary I brother Josh been mentioned it and I thought man that's powerful contrary just contradicting what was said as false and relaying the truth on the contrary you came from God and you're going back to God Satan says there's no way he says you're going to lose on the contrary I'm in Victory for he's the leader I'm following him amen he can't lose oh if I could get the world to see that he said there you are the body of Jesus Christ Living standing redeemed redeemed justified in his sight we come forth he says in the last days with the Glorious gospel showing his victory come on somebody you don't may not think you're much tonight but you are more than Than You Think You Are Tonight am time is still going on brother Joel amen but you can't lose you can't lose no more than God can lose you can't die no more than God can die you can't be defeated no more than God can be defeated oh I'm going to have a good time are you with me just keep these thoughts in your mind it's going to be a Roman Candle here in a minute when you see it coming down living among the church we have proof of his if you got the baptism how many's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost stand to your feet oh don't be ashamed of the Gospel look around you church this is proof of his victory and no matter what is going on in time you are Behind the Walls of a victory formation hell has Exon everything that he could do he everything he thre everything at you you say brother Joe I still make mistakes welcome to time brother brother Wayne preach it man what a powerful message Grace in dirt amen long as you're trapped in this dirt you're going to make mistakes but listen that doesn't change the fact amen you are in Victory formation Satan is screaming on the other side trying to get you believe a lie but it's only a lie Hallelujah you are his proof of his victory look to your neighbor say I am proof I am proof of his victory shows they couldn't keep him in the grave sister debie neither can they keep us he said that's right we've already say already with me we've already potentially arised because we raised from the dead no wonder you can make a statement AR riseing say what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is from raised from the dead of unbelief in his word and from denomination Creeds and then the word moves on down into the body from the head he said what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it the same word moves from the head the day comes close it's getting close it's the end time the day is into the down into the life is coming into the body down into the body Vindicated proving a witness are you hearing me somebody amen that we are what he said we was going to be he's vindicating that that one he said that the husband and wife flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his Spirit how do you know it Bears the same record the same life things that I do sh you also Hallelujah notice the Vindicated word in his body in the very Victory and the reason of his death Hallelujah he said then he raised up and all again he quickened It Made Alive his flesh which was his body that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it's gradually begin to come up in the reformation and now she's standing upon her feet Hallelujah not a defeated bride oh no no no amen who cares what hell says who cares what your past says you're not connected to your past come on Church come on on Amen you're not connected to your past contrary Grace in this dirt odds was against David but on the contrary David was anointed Ezekiel tells us a will in the middle of a whe How many likes that little story listen to what brother B says but the working of the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God is in you God sits on the throne of your heart he's in his control room control room is a central control a monitoring for security safety to make sure everything is running smoothly and to make sure it's continuous power from the source so he condescended down God's now in the Throne of your heart his control room controlling he says controlling your emotions oh my controlling your powers controlling your conceptions making you one with him in fellowship and love it fills you with the spirit he fills with the divine nature he changes your carnal nature into his nature then you become a new creature in Christ Jesus how you going to make it because he's in the house oh we're in Victory formation we're in the last days the last hours of days he said do you see now in the word word all that's made the word made manifest right before us the church is living God he said get to your feet believing with all that's in you he hold to that little will in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move he's controlled by the tire on the inside of youen it makes you do things you're not ordinary able to do oh ain't you thankful of that you used to couldn't get over drugs but because he's you allowed him in the control tower you're able to overcome it tonight he can change you church that's what he is you let him in your heart you don't have to quit any longer who who said it uh one of the brothers and and you know I drunk all the drinks I wanted to drink since I become a Christian hey I went out with every woman I wanted to since I become a Christian I just there desire is not there any longer cuz there's a man that's in the house there's something on the throne of our hearts amen and now yet we're in time and we're in this dirt amen but we're not fighting for victory we're in Victory formation and we can Rejoice tonight because our inheritance was our first place and we are his proof of his victory and we're standing upon our feet as a mighty Army are you hearing me somebody how many's in Victory formation amen you may get knocked down when I was a kid they came out with this little thing that you blowed up remember there yeah you know no matter brother Joe I could take off and take off as hard as I want to and I'd hit that thing it would hit the ground and pop right back up I got to thinking about that I know that's just a kid but man that's exactly you know it makes hell so mad sir Satan takes his biggest punch he's got amen but we're in Victory formation and no matter how much he pped you down PPS you hits you kicks you knocks you down you bounce right back up amen they can't keep a Believer down she's in Victory formation she can't be stopped I say tonight on the contrary Satan's been lying to you telling you're no good because of your past aen past has gone by in time and no longer in existence he paron you he exonerated you he let you know this is not the real you the real you is what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah Hallelujah and the prophet would pick it up maybe he would say that now she's standing upon her feet she might get knocked down there's still time going on but she can't stop her but he said when he went to the spears I'm fixing clothes and I've got so much left he said but he went where his Spears was the heaviest down through the valley of the shadow of death and he gathered death and sickness with his arms into his own bosom thank you Lord and he sent back the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost to plac in our hands and required of each son of Adam to fight as we can though you've been made fun of though you've been persecuted Hallelujah hey I'm not here to kick you down every chance I get if a pastor wants to do that he can do it I'm not here to make Grace a disgrace I'm here to tell you that God thought about you he placed your name in the book A been in nothing in time Satan can't hold your inheritance forever his days are numbered amen and and this is why you're here there's come a predestinated time amen where God met you amen and released you and made you free Hallelujah but the H was against you can I finish this God's good isn't he he said fight the best you can for the victory I think I have to read this again though you be persecuted though they standal IE your name though they stomp on you tell everybody of your past tell everybody of your failures they persecute you they make fun of you they talk about you they standardize your name but he says they can't call you Hol but fight as the best you can listen to the statement for the victory is sure hallelujah oh we may be going through some great trials so kind we might go through great battles in this time you might go through some great Gethsemane but brother Donnie said he went through two years ago amen it was a great hard time in his life but here he is still standing he got knocked down but he bounced right back up Hallelujah and what keeps us going tonight the victory is sure the enemy is routed it exhausted all of his options he said he's routed he's defeated his garnish are broken and the great captain of our Salvation is leading on today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you Sons and Daughters of Adams why say here till you die let us rise and do something let us take what we have it's no more than mortal lifting and still move let's give praise to God let's shout the hilltop we're not rejoicing cuz Spirits are subject to us we're rejoicing amen as John looked behind the veil and said there's John we had a message in the hour that we looked in and we said there's me this world ain't my first place I came from God and I'm going back to God it's it's our stabilizer it's the anchor to the ship it's a ship tied to the Anchor in the time of the storm what a victory formation Oh Ship can get hit from the waves the storms you may get a little dizzy From The Storm ride you might get look like there's no hope in sight you may feel like job tonight look like you've lost your family lost everything you had Satan's been on a a war path trying to destroy you and your church your family and everything he get his hands on but all of a sudden you begin to lift your hands there's still time on the clock oh but there that Revelation Dropped In Your Heart amen I'm not defeated I'm not defeated this two will pass this two will pass hey better this storm is for a season Heen it's a season that's in my life and all of a sudden that old string that's been running loose begins to tighten up to your absolute let me declare this to you in closing it never left you it was always there Hallelujah even though it didn't feel like God was around listen hell knew that you was in Victory formation and you can't be defeated that's the reason why he's howling the way he is he knows if you get a revelation tonight that you've already are in Victory formation the Gates of Hell cannot stand before you Hallelujah there's something won't let us move from it it's a Christ centered life and then he brother Brown takes it to a mainspring in a watch he say it's a mainstream it's a will in the middle of the wheel it's an instrument that ticks just perfectly to his time he says now the stablers has been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us before you know just beyond the Wave Y where we're nearing the shore that brother's prayer uh during a meeting because you can see the mighty waves mean the shore is really close we're nearing the shore he says stay staed just stay in his word stay with God no matter how you feel come on somebody doesn't matter how you feel what anything else is saying stay right with the word let's stay stable when you see all these great old big clouds around us storm are begin to to come atomic bombs everything else they're talking about but our stabilizers is straight to the word God said it'll be here s Corin we was be exempt from these things but he did say will we will crest will'll top we'll overcome we'll conquer every one of them yeah why because we're in Victory formation yeah we got to ride over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink usen I don't care what hell saying tonight we are in Victory formation and that wave is temporary you're going to come to the top it's impossible for you to S you say brother Joe why if it takes me to a grave There Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down amen you're in Victory formation they ain't the ground deep enough that when he calls you won't respond Hallelujah don't you love him tonight they can't sink us and they can't drown us little Jared they can't take us why yes you put us in a grave and we're going to come out again yes sir oh we're proof of it they couldn't keep Jesus in the ground and if you're buried in Christ Jesus they ain't going to be able to keep us either that's just all there is to it that's what he says there ain't no way in the world to keep you down there we're going to Crest every one of them cuse our great Chief Captain is calling we're Anchored In Jesus the storms of life I brave I've Anchored In Jesus I fear no wind or wave whatever it might be Let It Come Oh I feel that way tonight I don't care what kind of demonic powers come let it come I'm anchored I'm anchored it doesn't make any difference we're anchored right there in Jesus in Victory formation he said it's that will in the middle of the whe way up in the middle of the air that Mighty conqueror come on children come on children you are faithful over a few things come on we're going out this morning you've been here long enough oh you he somebody we've been here long enough how many's been there how many's ever got sick of something how many's ever got sick of the phone and just say I'm putting it down I'm tired of looking at the same stuff on it over and over and over again taking my time up he says you're you've been here long enough we're going higher oh God let the desire of the church this is a prophet brother Jared this is what he said we've been we've been suffering here long enough we've been bad on these troubles long enough we've been trying to wave out these waves long enough let's go higher can somebody say Amen to that let's go higher and then the pro Prophet brother Matt says this is how you do it pull up up those Stakes out of Egypt well preached brother Joe let me do it just for a second pull up those things that you've held for so long because maybe maybe somebody mistreated you maybe some church done you wrong maybe you done this that or the other maybe maybe you got to St there and no matter what you do you're going right back to that same old spot and all he saying let let's we've been here long enough we' worry about it long enough amen there's a law you let go God said I'll come down amen you've been running too long you've been fighting this battle too long say brother Joe I tried to give it to him more more times I'm telling you this may be your last time come up power release that Stakes of and keep you down bitter at your brother bitter at your sister it ain't time to have no bitterness it ain't time to have no funny feelings between any person why cuz I can hear it the combine's coming it's later than you think oh yeah when you be when you see the Life coming from the head down into the body he has said it's a Vindication that the Rapture is at hand it's time yes sir it's time come up high pull up them Stakes of Egypt look unto Jesus not your shortcomings not your failures not your inabilities if you look at yourselves if you look at your past you'll look like grasshoppers in your side and close it if sistera would come music players when he died at Calvary listen to this this quote this is powerful when he died at Calvary he bowed his head as far as the atonement was made and everything you got needed this journey from Earth to Glory he screamed it is finished there can be nothing else added to it talk about Victory formation aen nothing can be added to it nothing hell can do about it amen nothing else can take it from it that settles it the B Bible is finished the plan of God is finished the atonement is made and the devil is defeated and the only thing we have to do is look and live we're in Victory formation we may be knocked down but we're going to be back up amen we're going to Crest every one of them Hallelujah looking unto Jesus not our past not our shortcoming not our inabilities you may say there's no hope for me I say on the contrary on the contrary God loves you and God would prepare a service just for you how me believes that brother Morgan he could prepare this service sister Sandy just for you you know why he cares he cares he knows every time a spare may fall I'm here to tell you he knows all about your your problems your situations he knows what you've been harboring in your heart against one another he knows exactly where you've been at in the midnight hours but his grace is so good sister Sarah's grace is enough tonight and he said come and go with me take your Stakes up remove that thing that's keeping you bound let go of the situations that you have been harbored it's time to move higher it's time to get ready to leave this world are you ready to go home Saints are you ready to to get out of the this whole world she's going insane she's falling apart it's going to come time I don't care if you're republic or democrat amen it's going to come a time our money ain't going to be worth nothing but God's going to have his wife in position she's going to take up every steak of unbelief and she's going to be walking behind this formation of victory and she's going to March right out of time until time keeps taking it takes a knee time keeps ticking until he reach zero AB I'm here to tell you it's close church but don't be weary and well done he says we're not going into the Rapture on the contrary the message notifi us brother Randall we got the earnest and we we' already turned to Heavenly in other words we're already going you can't stop it the brides and victory formation Hallelujah I pray tonight as we stand to our feet tonight Hallelujah he says I will in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move every motion that you make every every thought that you have may be controlled by the tower on the inside of you because God is sitting right here in his word in the hour and the even light showing forth his light it makes you do things your ordinary wouldn't do it's our stabilizer it's our anchor Hallelujah can we just bow our hearts for a moment tonight he's our state izer he's wanting you to have freedom tonight more than ever and he gave you a moment of Grace tonight when he said it's time it's you've been there long enough it's time to take up your stakes and let go and God promise he'll come on the scene that ain't thus sayeth Joe that's thus sayith the Lord Lord he said if you let go I'll let come I say tonight I wouldn't hold on to anything tonight it's going home time this could be our last service this could be our very last moment in time he the prophet was telling us this is our message let's take up those Stakes tonight say brother Joe I say I'm guilty too we were all trapped in time we're still trapped in this dust this dirt he said we've been here long enough let's take our burdens to the Lord and leave them there as long as you're holding the burden that's all you begin to think it gets so heavy like when I had brother Ben to hold that bottle up he held it up with ease but after a few moments it got so heavy he lost his praise he lost his shout he lost his his Joy all he can think about is the burden oh church he don't want you to concentrate on the burden you might have to carry it around because you're trapped in dirt but let him become your burden barrier tonight let him put a tender hand of Jehovah upon your burden oh and when I put my hands upon that bottle there was just a joy that came bursting in brother Ben's heart and I say the same way with you tonight if you'll let Jesus Christ come down and become your burden barrier you'll have freedom again you'll have a shout again you'll have some joy unspeakable and full of Glory I invite you tonight to come and lay down your burdens tonight so I've cared it for so long Hallelujah brother Matthew Come and sing buddy Hallelujah God's so good to us tonight Saints he loves [Music] you will make away when there seems to be no [Music] is faithful we make a road when you bear a heavy load I know God Will Make A

clap of praise tonight amen you believe that that God Will Make A Way when there is I believe that God's already made a way Amen brother Joe said we're in Victory formation well if you really knew what that means that's pretty good stuff we're in Victory formation isn't that wonderful amen you know you know you know what the play call is during a victory formation it's when you take the snap and you don't try to advance and you don't try to force anything but all you do is take a c couple of steps backwards behind that big old offensive line and you kneel down on one knee yeah I thought isn't that the formation that we're in here God's already provided us a victory and brother Mark he's gave us a place of refuge and all we have to do is just take a knee amen that's our that's where our Victory comes from you say brother Matt I need that kind of victory in my life well just take a knee just kneel down before the Lord and say Lord I I'll accept victory over my life that's all it takes amen you love the Lord tonight amen I believe he's given us a victory won't you give him a hand clap of Praise again tonight well I heard an old old Story how a savior came from Glory how he gave his life on Calvary just to sa a rich like me and I heard about his groaning of his Precious Blood atoning then I repented of my sins and I want the victory so I say Victory in Jesus My Savior forever well s me and me with his redeeming blood he L me before I [Music] ever he me to Victory beneath the quing blood will I heard a mansion that was built for me in glory and I heard about the streets of gold be on the crystal sea and about the angel singing of an old Redemption story and some sweet day I'll sing up there this song [Music] [Music] he plunged me to Victory beneath the CL that last one says I heard about a mansion He has built for me and I heard about the streets of gold beond the crystal sea about the angels singing and the old Redemption and today I'll sing up there the song of Victory oh Victory in Jesus my Savior for he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me I knew and all my love is he plunged me to Victory beath the cleansing [Applause] blood amen and I enjoyed that tonight and I believe that is the only place there is tonight is Victory in Jesus amen it don't matter who they vote in it don't matter who they vote out but I'm telling you that I was thinking the other day that when all this big push when they was all these demonstrations against the Jews and stuff brother bam said that every nation I believe he said would turn against Israel amen so we're just seeing prophecy it shouldn't discourage us but just look up brother Tom cuz our Redemption draw High amen I enjoyed that tonight said a lot of good things brother Joe and that Victory formation was good we're in if we would he asked me to dismiss let's just bow our hearts and U I have a little request if You' just give me just a few seconds to tell you uh my cousin he uh he lives over in Northwest Arkansas and uh a lot of you I don't know some of you may know him his name's Tim Lane and he goes to church down there brother Tony's and uh uh he lives up by Rogers but he goes down there by close to Fort Smith and he helps out down there with the music and different things and his dad he's uh I believe he said he's 79 and my uncle be my Uncle Jim and um he said he fell the other day and he busted some ribs and I guess he busted them so bad that they were talking about maybe going in and putting some reinforcement or something in there some metal but they I guess did a CAT scan on him and found out he had a tumor on the brain so it been affected him a little bit and they didn't realize what was going on until the doctors found that so if you would would you uh keep hold him up in prayer this week and and brother Marty mccomus uh they told me it wasn't doing very good and if you would just you get a chance somewhere alone a lot of times there's times that I whisper y'all's name even when I'm out at work in the middle of the night sometimes and somebody will come on my heart and I'll pray for him and I believe God hears it brother Joel I didn't mean to take a minute but I just wanted to greet you a second I love you and let's just bow our hearts Our Kind precious Heavenly Father Lord tonight if I wanted to get in to see the president they'd probably laugh me out so there ain't no Arkansas hillbilly going to get to come in and see the president if I went to other countries they wouldn't let me in to see dignitaries and great leaders but you're the great king of kings Lord and tonight I simply bow my head and I begin to speak to the maker and Lord I believe that you hear and answer prayer and God I pray that Lord each one that's here tonight I pray you'd go with them as they leave and I I believe that each one's been blessed Lord I know I have thank you that you would stop by and visit us Lord we're So Unworthy but Lord how it begins to strengthen our hearts when you stop by Lord I pray tonight that each one that's sick and Afflicted Lord you're a God that hears and answers prayer and Lord I still believe the scripture where it says that by your stripes we were healed Lord It's a finished work tonight and I pray Lord you'd be with each one and may when we leave may we not leave from your presence but go with us Lord I pray that you'd encourage the hearts of your children tonight make them ready for the journey because we are Lord in the victory formation Lord I Thank you just go with them and we'd be careful to give you the praise in Jesus name amen oh dear Jesus come and my broken spirit and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory oh Victory in Jesus I sa for he sought
