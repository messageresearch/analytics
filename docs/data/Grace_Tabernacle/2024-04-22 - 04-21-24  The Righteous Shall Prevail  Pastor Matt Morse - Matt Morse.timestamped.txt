[40:14] scripture and we're going to read out of
[40:16] the book of Psalms in the 37th chapter
[40:19] and I just couldn't get away from this
[40:22] and I had actually quoted something out
[40:25] of it in a few
[40:28] uh weeks ago and and and over the past
[40:31] few weeks in study I just keep uh into
[40:35] this scripture and and and David paints
[40:38] quite a picture here of showing a
[40:42] righteous man a good man and a and and
[40:46] an evil man so uh but I just want to
[40:49] read out of 37th chapter and the first
[40:51] verse and we'll just read on on down
[40:53] that Bas is really uh Bassy up here I
[40:56] don't know if there's a you can fix that
[40:59] but uh we're going to read psalms 371
[41:02] Bible says fret not thyself because of
[41:05] evildoers neither be thou envious
[41:08] against the workers of iniquity for they
[41:10] shall soon be cut down like the grass
[41:13] and wither as the green herb trust in
[41:15] the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell
[41:18] in the land and verily thou shall be fed
[41:22] how many say Amen to that Delight
[41:24] thyself also in the Lord and He Shall
[41:26] give thee the desires of thine heart
[41:29] commit thy way unto the Lord and trust
[41:32] also in him and he shall bring it to
[41:34] pass and he shall bring forth thy
[41:36] righteousness as the light and thy
[41:38] judgment as the noon day rest in the
[41:41] Lord and wait patiently for him fret not
[41:44] thyself because of him who prospereth in
[41:46] his way because of the man who bringeth
[41:49] Wicked devices to pass but cease from
[41:52] anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself
[41:55] in any wise to do evil for evildoers
[41:58] shall be cut off but those that wait
[42:00] upon the Lord they shall inherit the
[42:02] earth for yet a little while and the
[42:05] wicked shall not be yay Thou shalt
[42:08] diligently consider his place and it
[42:11] shall not be in other words a little
[42:12] while you won't even be able to find the
[42:14] wicked he said but the meek shall
[42:17] inherit the earth and shall Delight
[42:19] themselves in the abundance of Peace but
[42:22] us ask the Lord to add his Blessing to
[42:24] the reading of the word and now we could
[42:26] read that scripture and say we had
[42:27] church this morning didn't isn't that
[42:29] good he said in a little while you'll
[42:31] look for the wicked and you'll not even
[42:33] find them but the meek they'll inherit
[42:35] the earth now you know you Bible readers
[42:37] that's the very scripture that Jesus
[42:39] quoted in Matthew the 5th chapter he
[42:41] said blessed are the meek when he
[42:42] preached The Sermon on the Mount blessed
[42:44] are the meek for they shall inherit the
[42:46] earth and I want to speak this morning
[42:48] on the righteous shall Prevail the
[42:50] righteous shall Prevail I had spent uh
[42:53] uh time and just in thought and prayer
[42:55] and you know I I think of the feelings
[42:58] and things that we get in this in this
[43:00] flesh and uh brother Mark it just seems
[43:02] like sometimes it's an overwhelming
[43:04] feeling and I don't know about y'all but
[43:06] if you ever looked at everybody else and
[43:08] thought everybody was doing good but you
[43:10] it just seemed like everybody it just
[43:11] seems like everything's going good for
[43:13] them but it ain't going good for you or
[43:15] everything works out for them but it
[43:16] don't work out for you and everything
[43:18] they everything they touch it just it
[43:20] just does right but it don't work out
[43:22] for you and you know sometimes it just
[43:24] seems like we get overwhelmed and in in
[43:26] our in in our in our life and jobs maybe
[43:29] get overwhelming and families
[43:31] overwhelming and church overwhelming and
[43:33] just seems like it's just constant on
[43:34] every hand and and and you know you
[43:37] don't have to look very far to find
[43:38] wickedness this is this is something
[43:40] that uh you can look across the street
[43:42] and you see wickedness you go down the
[43:44] town it's wickedness it just everywhere
[43:46] you seem uh everywhere you go it just
[43:47] seems like it's wickedness on every hand
[43:49] and and often times it looks like that
[43:52] wickedness is what is rewarded it looks
[43:54] as though uh you know the wicked they
[43:57] they they they're they they get the
[43:58] riches and the wickedness and they and
[44:01] they they live these great lives and
[44:02] prosperous lives and it looks like why
[44:04] would why would God reward all the
[44:06] wicked and then those that are
[44:07] struggling and those that are trying to
[44:09] do right and trying to serve the Lord
[44:10] and and and then they're not rewarded
[44:12] but the Wicked Man is the one rewarded
[44:14] and so this is a way that it looks like
[44:16] often through our through our own uh
[44:18] eyes but let me prophesy something to
[44:20] you this morning and I believe I have a
[44:21] right to because it's a scripture but
[44:23] the prosperity of the wicked shall cease
[44:26] and the glory of the righteous shall
[44:28] Prevail somebody say Amen that it won't
[44:30] be long and the prosperity of the wicked
[44:32] it'll not it'll no longer be but but the
[44:35] but the glory of the righteous it'll
[44:36] Prevail over it and I thought isn't it
[44:38] something that this word Prevail brother
[44:40] Wesley to Prevail means to prove more
[44:42] powerful than an than an opposing force
[44:46] or to become Victorious so in order to
[44:48] Prevail over something there has to be
[44:50] an opposing force in order to be able to
[44:52] say I'm going to Prevail there has to be
[44:54] opposition in order to Prevail there has
[44:56] to be something something there had to
[44:57] be something to Prevail over there would
[44:59] have to be a trial or there'd have to be
[45:01] a test or or there' had to be a battle
[45:03] or there had to be a struggle there had
[45:04] to be something that you would go
[45:06] through in order to Prevail you can put
[45:07] your own you can put your own problem in
[45:09] that in that in that saying that what is
[45:11] it that I had to Prevail over we all
[45:13] have things that we had to Prevail over
[45:14] we all have trials we all have have test
[45:17] and we all have pressures and we all
[45:19] have we all have seasons in our life
[45:21] that we go through great things but but
[45:22] friends when you come to a season of
[45:24] great trial know this this morning that
[45:27] when you're in a season of great trial
[45:29] that that's the very season of
[45:30] overcoming see in order to be a
[45:32] prevailer in order to be an overcomer in
[45:35] order to have over in order to overcome
[45:37] something in order to Prevail over
[45:38] something then you had to be in a season
[45:39] of trial in order to have a season of
[45:41] overcoming you have to have a season of
[45:43] pressure a season of test in order to
[45:46] have a season of prevailing or a season
[45:47] overcoming so instead of looking at it
[45:50] like there's too much pressure or
[45:51] there's too many problems or or or
[45:53] people get mad or there's too many
[45:55] fusses I I know it's easy to look around
[45:57] the church and it's easy to look around
[45:59] one another and find all the problems
[46:01] and all the negatives and all what this
[46:02] one said about this one or what this
[46:04] person did to you and I thought what
[46:06] it's such a weakness of the Flesh of of
[46:08] of Christianity I it's so sad to look
[46:10] and see men that are supposed to be men
[46:12] of God and I'm going get in trouble but
[46:15] but women that are supposed to be women
[46:16] of God and it don't take just a little
[46:18] thing and they'll they'll go from being
[46:20] a great leader to being a little bit of
[46:21] nobody and they'll go trashing and and
[46:23] mouthing and get so upset at one another
[46:25] and why because it's just the it's the
[46:28] weakness of the human flesh it's the
[46:30] weakness of their walk with God it's the
[46:32] missing things in their life with God
[46:34] and they allow the pressures and the
[46:35] things of this life to so pressure them
[46:37] down that they're not living the life of
[46:39] an overcomer but it it's just a life of
[46:41] pressure and it's a life of beat down
[46:43] it's a life of beat up and they lash out
[46:45] at one another and and you try to do
[46:47] something good for the Lord and then
[46:49] Satan comes and and he's trying to do
[46:51] something against you to stop and and if
[46:53] we ain't careful it allows us to get so
[46:55] worked up in our spirit but what we
[46:57] ought to do is listen what the prophet
[46:58] said he said don't worry about all those
[47:00] S these pressures and he says but see he
[47:02] said just when you start to do something
[47:04] good he said then you're going to see
[47:07] trouble coming he said so then that's
[47:10] just the devil trying to upset the
[47:12] program of God we find it in our
[47:14] individual life we find it in our church
[47:17] world we find it in our natural Affairs
[47:20] you find it everywhere he said so then
[47:22] we can know that when we're getting
[47:24] ready to do right wrong is always
[47:28] present somebody say Amen you want to do
[47:30] something for the Lord you lo and behold
[47:32] somebody's going to do something to
[47:34] upset you or somebody's going to say
[47:35] something or or Satan's going to bring
[47:37] some Spirit right in the middle of what
[47:39] you're trying to do for God to try to
[47:41] upset you or try to knock you off your
[47:43] direction or or try to take you out of
[47:45] the program of God that you would back
[47:47] up and say well it ain't worth it anyhow
[47:49] and why well there a was no reward that
[47:51] came from it anyhow why it was more
[47:53] worth it was more trouble than it was
[47:54] worth what it's the devil trying to
[47:56] upset the program of God something that
[47:59] God has called you to do and put on your
[48:01] heart to do but he's doing all that he
[48:03] can to upset the program of God he said
[48:07] but the way to overcome that how many
[48:09] wants to know it he said the way to
[48:11] overcome that is to think in your heart
[48:14] which way God would have you to go and
[48:17] which is the best way and then stay with
[48:19] that way the way to overcome it is to
[48:22] find the way that God would have you to
[48:24] go the best way and stay with God's way
[48:27] so what did God lead you to do what did
[48:29] God put on your heart to do what is God
[48:31] dealing with you to do find God's way
[48:33] and stay with God's way don't let the
[48:35] pressures and the problem I can't help
[48:37] but I'm here this morning but you can't
[48:39] let all the things that are built up
[48:41] take you out of the path that God has
[48:43] started you down now this came from a
[48:45] message that brother Ram was speaking he
[48:47] was speaking on Israel when they were
[48:48] caught on the mountain how many members
[48:49] of the story Jehoshaphat brother Joe had
[48:51] preached on it a few weeks ago and how
[48:53] that they were caught up on a mountain
[48:55] and the enemy was around them and they
[48:56] had no way and they had no way out they
[48:58] had no way to food or water here they
[49:00] were trapped up in this way and but's
[49:02] preaching on them being in this
[49:03] situation he said but in that great hour
[49:06] of frustration the Lord spoke and he
[49:08] spoke to a little Prophet that was
[49:10] standing nearby and he said stand still
[49:13] and see the salvation of God you'll not
[49:16] have to fight this battle he said and as
[49:19] long as they were together in praying it
[49:21] was God's battle he said and I think
[49:23] that applies the same thing tonight in
[49:25] this great hour
[49:27] where the great church people and the
[49:28] great churches are stewing and fussing
[49:30] with each other denominational barriers
[49:33] breaking us apart and we battle from
[49:34] this side and that side it's time to
[49:37] stand still for it's God's battle it's
[49:39] not ours to begin with God wants us to
[49:42] stand still and when God gets ready to
[49:44] do anything he usually commands his
[49:46] people to stand still isn't that
[49:49] opposite of the way we think we get in
[49:51] the middle of something we get anxious
[49:53] and try to figure out a way to fix it we
[49:54] get in a little bit of a trial or
[49:56] something that's going on you tell you
[49:57] what I'll go get a hold of them I I I'll
[50:00] whoop them into shape I I'll I'll
[50:01] correct that I'll work on that let me
[50:03] just take matters into my own hands but
[50:05] that ain't the way God instructs us to
[50:06] do it he said stand still and see the
[50:09] salvation of the Lord when there's a
[50:11] great battle on when there's a great
[50:12] trial on He commands his people brother
[50:15] said God commands his people to stand
[50:17] still it ain't a request of God it's a
[50:20] command of God stand still and let God
[50:23] be God
[50:26] if you want to overcome you think about
[50:28] it we're living in this age of
[50:30] prevailing an age of overcoming you know
[50:32] what the Bible says there will be
[50:33] Overcomers in this age that's why I
[50:35] believe there'll be Overcomers you know
[50:37] what that means by tomorrow you may as
[50:39] well just say there's going to be great
[50:40] tests in this age there's going to be
[50:42] great trials in this age there's going
[50:43] to be great pressures in this age
[50:45] because there will be Overcomers but if
[50:47] you're going to overcome see you must
[50:49] have something to overcome if you're
[50:51] going to be a Victor you must have an
[50:52] opposition if you're going to have
[50:54] achievement then you must have a
[50:56] challenge
[50:57] there's got to be things that we
[50:58] overcome you say well what's the great
[50:59] challenge of today how many knows that
[51:01] what we're living in today brother would
[51:04] say it like this he said we're living in
[51:05] a great hour of drought it's a great
[51:08] this is the age that we live in he said
[51:10] we all know we're very aware that there
[51:12] is a great spiritual drought in the land
[51:14] today spiritually speaking and you know
[51:17] it was predicted by the prophets just
[51:18] before the second coming of Christ would
[51:21] be so when you look in this world
[51:23] brother Mark and you see this great
[51:24] spiritual drought that is going on in
[51:26] the land in the middle of a spiritual
[51:28] drought the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[51:30] rejoicing you say well why is she
[51:32] rejoicing because the spiritual drought
[51:35] is a sign of the coming of the Lord so
[51:38] instead of getting discouraged because
[51:40] there's a lack of of spiritual food
[51:42] instead of getting discouraged because
[51:43] people are going their own way and they
[51:45] and they they have all their own
[51:46] directions and things instead of getting
[51:48] discouraged for living in this age we
[51:50] ought to be encouraged that the prophet
[51:52] of God said but in a spiritual drought
[51:54] he said it's it will only come before
[51:57] the second coming of Christ would be so
[51:59] it makes me feel good to know this
[52:00] morning that when you see this drought
[52:02] it's a sign of the coming of the Lord
[52:04] when you see this drought it's a sign
[52:06] that just around the corner that the
[52:08] wicked will be no more and the and the
[52:10] bride of Christ shall Prevail and the
[52:12] righteous shall be lifted again this is
[52:15] the age that we live in the Bible said
[52:16] there will come a famine in the land and
[52:18] it won't be a famine for bread alone but
[52:20] it'll be a famine for the hearing of the
[52:22] word of God and brother brandham said
[52:23] and that day is now it ain't something
[52:26] that we're waiting on but we're living
[52:27] in the day where there's a famine for
[52:29] the hearing of the word of God it was
[52:31] it's not a natural drought but it's a
[52:33] spiritual drought that's what Jesus said
[52:35] he said man shall not live by bread
[52:36] alone but man shall live by every word
[52:39] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[52:41] but right in the middle of a famine
[52:43] where people are starving for the word
[52:44] of God in the middle of a famine there's
[52:47] a famine in the land how many believe
[52:49] that say Amen when people are starving
[52:51] for truth they're starving for the word
[52:53] they're starving for leadership they're
[52:55] starving for Direction they're starving
[52:57] for guidance they're starving for an
[52:59] they ain't got nowhere to turn and in
[53:01] the middle of a famine here David is
[53:04] showing us something about the seed of
[53:06] almighty God as he shows this contrast
[53:09] of a of a wicked man and a good man and
[53:12] it begins to speak of these two men he
[53:14] said but the Lord knoweth the days of
[53:16] the upright and their inheritance shall
[53:19] last forever and they shall not be
[53:21] ashamed in the evil time but in the days
[53:24] of famine they shall be satisfied that
[53:27] makes me want to shout over this
[53:29] building here David said there's a
[53:31] wicked man and there's a good man and
[53:33] the wicked are going to do wicked things
[53:35] and the good men are going to do good
[53:36] things and it look it's going to look
[53:38] like that the wicked are the one that's
[53:39] prospering but don't you worry about it
[53:41] because there's coming a time that the
[53:43] wicked will be no more and then the just
[53:45] man he'll Prevail over all things and
[53:48] you don't have to worry about it for God
[53:50] is going to send a famine upon the land
[53:53] but in the days of famine the good man
[53:55] shall be sh satisfied the good man shall
[53:58] be fed the good man he'll survive the
[54:02] famine the wicked David said he in the
[54:05] days of famine they shall be satisfied
[54:08] but the wicked Shall Perish the famine
[54:11] wasn't sent for you glory to God the
[54:13] famine was sent for the wicked he said
[54:15] the good men will be satisfied but the
[54:17] Wicked Will perish The Good
[54:20] Men God but the wicked they're going to
[54:22] fall he said the Wicked Man he'll borrow
[54:24] and pay not again but the righteous man
[54:26] shows mercy and he gives for such as be
[54:29] blessed of him shall inherit the earth
[54:32] and they that be cursed of him shall be
[54:34] cut off for the steps of a good man are
[54:36] ordered of the Lord and He delighted in
[54:39] his way the good man you say well what a
[54:42] you know I brother Matt I I went through
[54:44] some rough times lately I don't know
[54:46] that I'm a good man all at all but you
[54:48] realize here that David when he talks
[54:50] about this good man he says even that
[54:52] good man sometimes he'll fall I love
[54:55] this I love this Psalm he said sometimes
[54:59] the good man he'll even fall short he
[55:01] said but when though he fall he shall
[55:04] not be utterly cast down here he's
[55:07] talking about the Wicked Man being cut
[55:08] off he'll be cut off from the earth
[55:10] he'll starve in the middle of the famine
[55:12] but the good man he may fall you may
[55:13] look at the good man and say he ain't no
[55:16] different than the wicked man but he's a
[55:17] good man but he fell he said but he
[55:20] shall not utterly be cast down that word
[55:22] utterly cast down means to be hurled
[55:25] away or throwed away so it's here that's
[55:28] an action that you would use your hand
[55:30] to do he would not be hurled away he
[55:32] will not be thrown away he will not be
[55:34] cast down the good man though he fall he
[55:37] will not be thrown in the trash he he
[55:38] won't be thrown away he said but what
[55:40] God will do is the Lord will uphold him
[55:43] with his hand I thought isn't it
[55:45] something the same hand that would throw
[55:47] away and the same hand that would cut
[55:49] off the wicked David said but the Lord
[55:51] will uphold him with his hand he upholds
[55:53] him he'll lift him back to his place
[55:55] he'll raise him up he'll give him a
[55:57] place of rest a place to lean on oh my
[56:00] can you imagine friends that the hand of
[56:03] God is what's upholding you in the time
[56:05] whenever you were fallen in the time
[56:07] whenever the pressures of Life had you
[56:09] took you down to such a state that you
[56:11] didn't know how you were going to go
[56:12] through tomorrow but here the very hands
[56:15] of the Creator became your place of rest
[56:17] the hands of the Creator God came the
[56:20] place that you were leaning on when you
[56:22] didn't feel like you could go another
[56:23] day but it was in the hand of the
[56:25] creator that established you and set you
[56:28] upright he said he'll uphold you should
[56:31] not be cast down but he'll uphold you
[56:34] David goes on to say he said I've been
[56:36] young he said but now I'm old you think
[56:39] about the life of David here a man that
[56:41] that lived 70 something maybe or a
[56:43] little over 70 years but Mark in his in
[56:45] his time of his life he saw many things
[56:48] he saw nations rise and Nations fall he
[56:51] saw kingdoms rise and and kingdoms fall
[56:53] he saw great Kings become nothing he saw
[56:56] little boys become great Kings he seen
[56:58] great battles he's seen great victories
[57:01] he seen great defeats he seen the
[57:03] richest of the rich he seen the poorest
[57:05] of the poor he lived in tents he slept
[57:07] with sheep he lived in the greatest
[57:09] Palace of all of Israel David seen many
[57:11] things he said I was young and now I'm
[57:14] old but there's one thing that I've
[57:16] never seen he said I have never seen the
[57:18] righteous forsaken and I've never seen
[57:21] God's seed begging
[57:23] bread there's a lot I've seen but never
[57:26] seen God's children ever forsake Him and
[57:28] his seed they've never beged bread don't
[57:30] you realize friends that in the middle
[57:32] of a famine David said this bread is
[57:35] freely given by the righteous man it's
[57:37] freely given by God unto you and it
[57:39] ain't something that you have to beg for
[57:41] all you had to do is receive it it ain't
[57:43] something you had to go beg God for but
[57:46] God saw that a famine was coming before
[57:48] you ever walked on this Earth he said
[57:50] and in the time in famine I'll provide
[57:52] bread that my seed will be satisfied
[57:56] his seed they don't beg for bread God
[57:59] saw it before it ever took place he saw
[58:01] the needs of the people you know today
[58:03] it seems like my goodness I feel like
[58:04] preaching in here today it seems like
[58:06] all the work and the effort is for
[58:08] Natural Things it seems like all the
[58:10] work is for natural food but do you
[58:12] realize this morning that your spiritual
[58:15] food is just matter of fact it's it's
[58:17] more important but but at least it's
[58:19] just as important to feed the spiritual
[58:21] man as the natural man it's important to
[58:25] feed the spiritual food is for the
[58:27] spiritual man natural food is for the
[58:28] natural man and so here David says we
[58:31] had to be fed and here he but God he the
[58:34] righteous man he'll never make you beg
[58:35] bread you say where is this bread that
[58:38] we could feed on and be satisfied you
[58:41] remember when Jesus was coming out from
[58:43] capernium that day and these men that
[58:45] had followed him he had just fed 5,000
[58:47] over on the bank a river bank and they
[58:49] had saw this great miracle and they came
[58:51] seeking after him and Jesus when he saw
[58:53] him he said you don't seek me because of
[58:55] the Miracles he said you seek me because
[58:57] you ate bread and you were filled see
[58:59] they were after the natural thing you're
[59:02] only following me because I gave you
[59:03] food you only follow me because I fed
[59:05] your bellies you you only follow me
[59:07] because I because I gave you a little
[59:08] bit that so he said but but but but you
[59:11] it's because you ate the Loaves and
[59:12] were're filled and you're and here Jesus
[59:14] starts to to preach this he says but
[59:16] you're laboring for the wrong meat and
[59:19] he says but labor not for the meat which
[59:21] perish but for the meat that endureth
[59:23] unto everlasting life listen what Jesus
[59:26] is saying labor for the meat that a man
[59:29] can eat of in other words labor for the
[59:31] food that a man can eat of and he shall
[59:34] never die you think about where that is
[59:36] in the scripture here's what this is
[59:38] what Jesus is talking about labor for
[59:40] the food that a man could eat of and
[59:41] never die where do we find that in
[59:43] Genesis the first chapter remember when
[59:44] Jesus or when God put the tree in the
[59:46] garden he said in the midst of the
[59:47] garden there was two trees one was the
[59:49] Tree of Life the other was a tree of
[59:50] knowledge of Good and Evil the Tree of
[59:52] Life a man could eat of and he would
[59:54] never die now watch Jesus as he speaks
[59:56] of this he said labor for the meat that
[59:58] a man could eat of and not die I thought
[1:00:00] isn't it something that these are the
[1:00:02] same words that Satan uses whenever he
[1:00:05] goes to deceive Eve he says that you can
[1:00:07] eat of this tree and thou shalt surely
[1:00:09] not die you can eat of this and in other
[1:00:12] words he may as well to said it like
[1:00:14] this you can eat of this tree and live
[1:00:16] because you won't not you'll not die you
[1:00:18] can eat I thought it was something that
[1:00:20] here Satan he led Eve to a deceitful
[1:00:23] Fruit by using God's Own word he said
[1:00:26] eat of this fruit Thou shalt not die eat
[1:00:28] of this fruit and you shall have life I
[1:00:30] thought isn't that the way the devil is
[1:00:32] he's always done that all the way till
[1:00:34] today we see the same thing the same the
[1:00:36] same offering of the devil Satan uses
[1:00:38] God's promises to deceive men they got
[1:00:41] these great Cathedrals and great uh uh
[1:00:43] great denominational systems around the
[1:00:45] world that'll say well join my church
[1:00:47] and God will bless you support my
[1:00:49] Ministry and God will bless you help me
[1:00:51] help me do this God's going to bless you
[1:00:53] see they use God's promises you're
[1:00:55] you're going to live forever and you're
[1:00:56] going to prosper and you ain't going to
[1:00:58] have to worry about nothing God's going
[1:00:59] to bless you why they're using God's
[1:01:01] promise this is Satan's trick to use
[1:01:03] God's promise for his own agenda to use
[1:01:06] God's promise to build up his own
[1:01:08] kingdom but let me ask you this what
[1:01:10] gives a man a right to use the promise
[1:01:12] of God for his own purpose he has no
[1:01:15] right for the Bible said there's only
[1:01:16] one place you can eat of a tree that you
[1:01:18] can eat of and have life and and then
[1:01:21] this is what Jesus said he said now you
[1:01:23] said where you going to get it Jesus
[1:01:24] said labor for for the meat that you can
[1:01:27] that that will endure under everlasting
[1:01:28] life which the son of man shall give
[1:01:31] unto you so here what Jesus says he said
[1:01:34] there's a meat that will bring life and
[1:01:36] it'll be given to you by the son of man
[1:01:38] so there ain't but one place to get it
[1:01:40] ain't nobody else has it to offer he
[1:01:42] said there's a meat that'll bring life
[1:01:44] and it'll be given by the son of man oh
[1:01:46] friends think about it this morning that
[1:01:47] the meat of eternal life is in the
[1:01:50] possession of the son of man and Jesus
[1:01:52] said and he'll give it unto you listen
[1:01:54] as he begin to speak this to them but
[1:01:56] Mark they had no understanding of what
[1:01:57] he was saying and they said well our
[1:01:59] fathers ate Mana in he in the desert it
[1:02:01] was written that God would give them
[1:02:03] bread from Heaven to eat and Jesus said
[1:02:05] unto them he said Moses did not give you
[1:02:07] bread from Heaven he said but my father
[1:02:09] gives you the true bread from Heaven
[1:02:11] other words that was just me to satisfy
[1:02:13] your natural body for a few days it
[1:02:15] ain't going to be here it it don't Mount
[1:02:17] to nothing he said but my father gives
[1:02:19] you a true bread from heaven for the
[1:02:21] bread of God is he which cometh down
[1:02:24] from heaven and giveth GL into the world
[1:02:27] the bread of God is he it wasn't a
[1:02:29] coriander seed it wasn't a a little uh
[1:02:32] honey wafer it wasn't a little uh
[1:02:35] communion bread but the bread of God was
[1:02:37] the person of Jesus Christ he said it's
[1:02:41] he that cometh down from heaven and
[1:02:42] giveth life into the world he said and
[1:02:45] unto them ever more give us this bread
[1:02:47] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[1:02:49] of life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:02:52] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[1:02:54] never thirst it was the children 's
[1:02:56] bread I am the bread of life I I'm
[1:02:58] offering it freely I'm giving it to the
[1:03:01] children let me tell you this children's
[1:03:02] bread brother Joe it just wasn't for the
[1:03:04] Jews there was a gentile one one time a
[1:03:06] gentile woman that went to Jesus and he
[1:03:08] fed her a little bit of it remember when
[1:03:10] she said my daughter needs to be healed
[1:03:12] he said but it's the children's bread
[1:03:13] it's not to be given to the dogs she
[1:03:15] said but even the dogs can have some of
[1:03:17] the crumbs off the master's table he
[1:03:19] said you said correctly and her daughter
[1:03:21] was healed that very hour so it it
[1:03:23] wasn't a matter you didn't have to be an
[1:03:25] Israelite to get the children's bread he
[1:03:27] said see it was given unto them freely
[1:03:30] freely brother Mark how did she receive
[1:03:32] it because she worshiped him she called
[1:03:35] him Lord she she called him what he was
[1:03:38] to her and and you realize that that
[1:03:40] same bread that she fed on is the same
[1:03:42] bread that they fed on in the days of
[1:03:44] the prophets it's the same bread they
[1:03:46] fed on in the days of Jesus the Same
[1:03:48] bread in the days of Paul it was the
[1:03:49] same bread in the days of the disciples
[1:03:51] and the apostles and that same bread has
[1:03:54] sustained this church church for 2,000
[1:03:57] years and we're still feeding on it
[1:03:59] today I know there's a world of people
[1:04:01] that's trying to come up with a new
[1:04:03] gospel to get people to come to church
[1:04:05] and there's a world of people that try
[1:04:06] to come up with new program to keep
[1:04:08] people in church and keep their young
[1:04:10] people excited and on fire for God but
[1:04:13] let me tell you friends the same bread
[1:04:15] that they were feeding on 2,000 years
[1:04:17] ago it's brought the church all the way
[1:04:19] to now and it'll take it into a
[1:04:22] rapture we don't need a new bread some
[1:04:24] new food some some new church some new
[1:04:26] religion some new program some way to
[1:04:28] keep keep people in church what we need
[1:04:30] is the bread of life which is the person
[1:04:33] of Jesus Christ to be minister to the
[1:04:35] people and broken from the pullit that
[1:04:37] people could take it and feed on it and
[1:04:40] become the life of Jesus Christ it's
[1:04:43] what strengthened the church in the time
[1:04:45] of famine they shall be satisfied it's
[1:04:47] what's leading us but remember preaches
[1:04:50] this message called spiritual food in
[1:04:52] due season you think all the way down to
[1:04:54] where we are
[1:04:56] through all the history comes down to a
[1:04:59] prophet and and and he's preaching this
[1:05:01] messes spiritual food in due season and
[1:05:03] then this message at the end of it he
[1:05:05] has a prayer line this woman comes up to
[1:05:06] the prayer line and he begins to discern
[1:05:09] discern her and he says you know he says
[1:05:11] how do you do he said well this woman
[1:05:12] you've had female trouble and some
[1:05:14] things he said and you're nervous it's
[1:05:15] just the age to get nervous you've had
[1:05:17] complications of all kinds he said but
[1:05:20] you have a desire too and that's to
[1:05:22] receive the Holy Ghost he said that
[1:05:25] that's what what it is do you believe
[1:05:27] have you confessed everything she said
[1:05:29] yeah he said will you believe if I lay
[1:05:30] my hands and ask God to do it that the
[1:05:31] Holy Ghost will come she said yes sir he
[1:05:33] said let's pray now notice this bread of
[1:05:36] life he said it would be given by the
[1:05:38] son of man notice that who's really
[1:05:41] given this bread he says Dear God I lay
[1:05:44] my hands upon this woman in the
[1:05:45] apostolic form and I ask that she
[1:05:48] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:50] In The Name of Jesus Christ may she
[1:05:52] receive it he said now don't doubt it it
[1:05:54] belongs to you it's yours it's the
[1:05:57] children's bread he said now you had a
[1:05:59] little funny feeling when I said female
[1:06:01] trouble didn't you yeah he said because
[1:06:03] that's what you had too now you just
[1:06:05] believe that you're going to be all
[1:06:06] right now and go thanking the Lord why
[1:06:09] because it was the children's bread see
[1:06:11] that children's bread brother Mark it
[1:06:13] brought healing it brought salvation it
[1:06:15] brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:17] you realize it was the son of man that
[1:06:19] gave bread in in in Jesus's Earthly
[1:06:21] Ministry now we we know that whenever
[1:06:23] whenever Christ would come we see him in
[1:06:26] these different offices the the Bible
[1:06:27] would tell us that there was an office
[1:06:29] of the son of man he would come as a Son
[1:06:30] of God he would come as a son of David
[1:06:32] on in the Millennium he said so but
[1:06:34] brother ra said but regardless son of
[1:06:36] man Son of God Son of David he said it's
[1:06:38] the same man all the time it's just like
[1:06:41] a father son Holy Ghost the office of
[1:06:43] God he was God the father he became God
[1:06:45] the son and he had to be God the Holy
[1:06:47] Ghost he said it wasn't three Gods it
[1:06:49] was one God with three manifestations or
[1:06:51] three attributes of the same God and so
[1:06:54] here just like the woman that met him in
[1:06:56] his Earthly Ministry and she came to him
[1:06:57] and called him Lord said while he was in
[1:06:59] his son of man Ministry but then he
[1:07:01] would be as Son of God and then he would
[1:07:03] be as son of David he said but it it was
[1:07:05] the same man all the time so brother
[1:07:07] Mark that means it didn't matter if it
[1:07:08] was 2,000 years ago it didn't matter if
[1:07:11] it was a 2,000 years from now it's the
[1:07:13] same bread giver and it's the same then
[1:07:16] and it's the same bread Giver now the
[1:07:18] same one that gave it in the in the days
[1:07:20] of Jesus Earthly Ministry is the same
[1:07:23] one that's feeding the church today and
[1:07:26] David said and he speaking of God God is
[1:07:29] ever merciful and he lendeth and his
[1:07:32] seed is blessed see it's the it's the
[1:07:35] same God no matter what office he's in
[1:07:37] he's the same bread Giver he's the same
[1:07:39] one feeding his church David says so
[1:07:41] depart from Evil and do good and dwell
[1:07:44] forever more even those that look like
[1:07:46] they were evil and wicked and all that
[1:07:48] David said so here's a way out depart
[1:07:50] from Evil and do good and and dwell
[1:07:53] forever more depart depart from evil and
[1:07:55] do good and in the famine you'll be
[1:07:57] satisfied depart from Evil and do good
[1:08:00] and then a time of drought there shall
[1:08:02] come a a spiritual rain up on the seat
[1:08:04] of God and you'll still be satisfied
[1:08:06] depart from Evil and do good listen
[1:08:09] while this was the promise to the church
[1:08:11] today that God said I will restore
[1:08:13] sayeth the Lord those that were that
[1:08:16] were falling the tree had been eaten
[1:08:17] down remember what Joel said it would
[1:08:19] been eaten down the pomor can canker wor
[1:08:21] the Locust of the caterpillar he had ate
[1:08:23] it down till there wasn't hardly
[1:08:24] anything left but God promised I would
[1:08:26] restore that same joy as he prophesied
[1:08:29] he would prophesy of the reign of God
[1:08:31] that would come upon the Earth David
[1:08:33] says depart from Evil do good and be
[1:08:37] satisfied I think of this famine I got a
[1:08:40] few more
[1:08:41] minutes we're just now getting started I
[1:08:44] think of this famine and how here we are
[1:08:46] living in this age of famine you look
[1:08:49] around the world today and I it kind of
[1:08:51] took my mind back to the story in Second
[1:08:53] Kings and and and I I'll just read this
[1:08:56] little part but the Bible says now
[1:08:57] jehoram the son of Ahab he worked evil
[1:09:01] in the sight of the Lord but not like
[1:09:03] his father and his mother but he put
[1:09:05] away the image of baale that his father
[1:09:06] had made but nevertheless he cleaved
[1:09:09] unto the sins of jeroboam the son of
[1:09:11] nabat which he made Israel to send and
[1:09:13] he departed not there from here see je
[1:09:15] jehoram brother Mark he had an
[1:09:17] opportunity when he came into the office
[1:09:18] of being a king to do to set things
[1:09:21] right he had an opportunity to to take
[1:09:23] the things that his father had built up
[1:09:26] and all all these other things and he
[1:09:28] had opportunity to set it straight in
[1:09:29] Israel but the Bible says he'd done away
[1:09:31] with part of it but he left the other
[1:09:32] part said so when he done it he he
[1:09:35] cleaved under the sins of jeroboam now I
[1:09:37] don't go into this but how many are you
[1:09:39] familiar with the sins of jeroboam the
[1:09:40] the sins of Jer what jeroboam done is
[1:09:43] when he came into the kingdom he was the
[1:09:45] man that said that that it's too far to
[1:09:47] go Worship in Jerusalem so we're going
[1:09:49] to make it easier on the people to
[1:09:50] worship God so we're make an easier way
[1:09:53] that you can be okay with God and we're
[1:09:55] to make it easier to be a believer after
[1:09:56] all we got we got to make room for those
[1:09:58] you know it's kind of hard to to to be a
[1:10:00] to be able to labor for the Lord and
[1:10:02] it's kind of hard to pray and you know
[1:10:03] and have a prayer closet anymore and
[1:10:05] it's kind of hard to go to church and
[1:10:07] make your way to the house of God and so
[1:10:09] you know what we're going to make a
[1:10:10] little bit different program to make it
[1:10:11] easier to go ahead and be able to call
[1:10:13] yourself a Christian so you can sleep
[1:10:14] better at night and feel like you're
[1:10:16] doing the right thing and so what Jared
[1:10:17] Bo boam did is he he took two calves and
[1:10:20] he said he said you don't have to go all
[1:10:21] the way to Jerusalem to worship he said
[1:10:23] I'm going to put one calf over in Dan
[1:10:25] and and I'm going to put the other calf
[1:10:26] over over in bethl now you know bethl
[1:10:28] which meant the house of God dam was a
[1:10:30] place of judgment so in the place of
[1:10:32] judgment he put a golden calf in the
[1:10:34] house of God he put a golden calf he
[1:10:36] said and this is going to be the place
[1:10:37] of your worship so Lo and look upon the
[1:10:40] gods that led you out of out of Egypt he
[1:10:43] made a place for the people to worship
[1:10:45] now notice how clever that he was
[1:10:47] because Jobo and brother Mark not only
[1:10:49] did he establish uh putting calves in
[1:10:51] the place of worship but but but
[1:10:54] whenever he done that he he literally
[1:10:56] took the name of God out of the church
[1:10:58] cuz no longer was it Jehovah God no
[1:11:00] longer was it Jehovah that brought us
[1:11:02] out of out of Egypt but but this is the
[1:11:04] god this golden calf God this is this is
[1:11:07] the deity that brought you out so he
[1:11:08] literally removed the name of God from
[1:11:11] the church and now the people they went
[1:11:13] the Bible says it caused all of Israel
[1:11:15] to sin because it was easier to go to
[1:11:17] Dan it was easier you but you notice how
[1:11:20] close that he kept it because the Bible
[1:11:22] says that jerob I wasn't going to get
[1:11:24] into him but the Bible says that
[1:11:26] jeroboam that he actually kept he
[1:11:28] actually established a priesthood I
[1:11:30] thought isn't it something that the
[1:11:32] priesthood that he established he
[1:11:33] established from the same way that Moses
[1:11:36] had said that a priesthood ought to be
[1:11:38] established he he established a
[1:11:40] priesthood he ordered people to come
[1:11:42] down and make sacrifices and do you know
[1:11:44] brother Wesley that the sacrifices they
[1:11:46] made were made the exact same way that
[1:11:48] God told Moses to tell the people to
[1:11:50] make a sacrifice so whenever jeroboam
[1:11:52] made these places of worship he made
[1:11:55] them so close to the way that God said
[1:11:57] to do it but the only problem was is
[1:12:00] they they they established priesthood
[1:12:02] they had a church they had a sacrifice
[1:12:04] they had a priest they just didn't have
[1:12:06] no God I thought isn't it something
[1:12:09] that's the way a lot of people get
[1:12:10] that's where this world is today they
[1:12:12] got churches they've got a priesthood
[1:12:14] they've got pull pits they come to
[1:12:16] church they Shout with everybody they oh
[1:12:19] they shout Jesus and raise their hand
[1:12:21] Dance all over the building and speak in
[1:12:23] tongues but they got all of that but
[1:12:24] they had no God see put all it was all
[1:12:28] there sacrifice was there good preacher
[1:12:30] was there good singing good worship but
[1:12:32] there was no God friends let me tell you
[1:12:34] something I'd rather be in a p bar
[1:12:37] worshiping God than to be in the biggest
[1:12:39] cathedral in the world without
[1:12:41] God I'd rather have a church with 200
[1:12:44] Spirit-filled people than 10,000 people
[1:12:46] that didn't have the spirit of God see
[1:12:49] established a place it was easier to
[1:12:51] worship God we don't want that kind of
[1:12:53] church I want a church with God in it we
[1:12:56] ain't replacing god with something else
[1:12:58] I want a church with God in it sure we
[1:13:00] worship God but we worship God cuz God's
[1:13:02] in it we ain't replacing with some uh
[1:13:04] some Grandpa God that makes everybody
[1:13:06] feel good so that they'll keep coming
[1:13:08] back to church friends it a I ain't
[1:13:09] worried about you coming here I'm
[1:13:11] worried about you getting right with God
[1:13:12] and being able being able to make a
[1:13:14] Rapture and your soul being okay with
[1:13:16] God when you meet God one day that's our
[1:13:20] desire so let's make a place make a
[1:13:23] place easier to worship make it where
[1:13:25] everybody can fit in isn't that the
[1:13:27] church world have you seen the the
[1:13:30] division of of of the the the Methodist
[1:13:33] churches lately that it's just a great
[1:13:35] it's all over the news of how that
[1:13:36] they're dividing because one will accept
[1:13:38] homosexual preachers and and then the
[1:13:40] other one won't and one will allow these
[1:13:42] kind and so the the churches are divided
[1:13:44] now there's a second third and fourth
[1:13:45] and fifth of them because of the the the
[1:13:47] way they're that some won't accept it in
[1:13:49] some wood is it something just to we
[1:13:52] just want to make everybody welcome we
[1:13:54] want to make room for everybody well
[1:13:56] there is room for everybody at the
[1:13:58] altar there's room for everybody there
[1:14:01] but it ain't room for sin see we got to
[1:14:04] make a place that was true worship it
[1:14:06] was sin to put another God in the place
[1:14:08] of God it was a sin it was idolatry so
[1:14:11] the Bible says here this is that's a
[1:14:13] little background of what's causing
[1:14:16] what's happening in in Israel with
[1:14:18] jehoram the Bible says he he kept the
[1:14:21] the the the ways of jeroboam and it came
[1:14:24] to pass when Ahab died that the king of
[1:14:26] Moab came against Israel remember Moab
[1:14:28] and Ahab Ahab was a great king had great
[1:14:31] military so so they would never go
[1:14:33] against Ahab because of the power that
[1:14:35] he had to with the Nations and so but
[1:14:37] they saw that Ahab was gone and it
[1:14:40] looked like it was easier to go in so
[1:14:43] now new king come in the Bible says here
[1:14:45] come Moab they rebelled against the king
[1:14:46] of Israel and jehoram he went out to
[1:14:49] Samaria he numbered all of Israel he
[1:14:50] went to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
[1:14:52] and he and he said the king of Moab is
[1:14:54] rebelled against me will you go with me
[1:14:55] against Moab in battle he said I am as
[1:14:58] Thou Art my people as thy people and he
[1:14:59] said well which way shall we go up and
[1:15:01] he answered and they he said let's go
[1:15:03] through the Wilderness of Edom so here
[1:15:05] what brother Mark what they're doing is
[1:15:06] they're building a unified body of
[1:15:08] people so they so they come in and
[1:15:10] they're they're trying to make a union
[1:15:11] so he comes he said let's go to Edom
[1:15:13] we'll get another king and another Army
[1:15:15] there and then we'll be able to face
[1:15:16] Moab let's go get somebody else on our
[1:15:18] side and then we'll be able to face Moab
[1:15:20] let's build up our army a little bit
[1:15:21] more then we'll go then we'll be able to
[1:15:23] face them and so they went out and they
[1:15:24] bu bued up and the Bible says the king
[1:15:26] of Israel and Judah and Edom and they
[1:15:28] fetched a compass of seven days journey
[1:15:30] and then they got there and there was no
[1:15:31] water for the host and the cattle that
[1:15:33] followed them and the king of Israel
[1:15:35] said alas the Lord hath called these
[1:15:37] three kings together to deliver them
[1:15:39] into the hand of Moab look at the place
[1:15:42] that all of Israel had gotten to the
[1:15:44] leaders look where they had led them
[1:15:46] they LED all the great armies of all
[1:15:48] these Israel armies and they LED them to
[1:15:50] the brink of Destruction and finally but
[1:15:53] Mark after all of this all this I don't
[1:15:55] have time to go through it all but all
[1:15:57] these dealings that when you can read
[1:15:58] part in Chronicles and second Kings it
[1:16:00] goes a little more detail but but all of
[1:16:02] this that they had that they had done
[1:16:03] and they LED them finally all the
[1:16:05] decisions they made brother wesy finally
[1:16:07] there was a voice of wisdom that
[1:16:09] spoke a man finally says he says is
[1:16:12] there not here a prophet of the Lord
[1:16:15] that we may inquire of him is there a
[1:16:17] Prophet somewhere that we could inquire
[1:16:20] of the Lord by him I thought my after
[1:16:22] trying after asking everybody what we
[1:16:23] ought to do finally somebody got got
[1:16:25] enough sense to say but is there a
[1:16:26] prophet in the land that we could
[1:16:28] inquire of him of what the will of God
[1:16:30] really is is there not a prophet that
[1:16:31] would give us an answer that would that
[1:16:33] would give us a real Direction everybody
[1:16:35] has a direction that we ought to go
[1:16:36] every everybody has an opinion where
[1:16:38] what we ought to do in this situation
[1:16:40] everybody has a way to handle it but is
[1:16:41] there not a prophet in the land that we
[1:16:43] could inquire of that the Lord would
[1:16:45] give us the right direction to go a
[1:16:47] voice of wisdom spoke and so finally he
[1:16:49] he asked him and I love this cuz the
[1:16:51] Bible said can I I'm just I'm just I'm
[1:16:53] just feeling home I love it because the
[1:16:55] Bible said and one of the Servants of
[1:16:57] the king of Israel answered it wasn't a
[1:17:00] great man that had the answer it was a
[1:17:02] little servant it wasn't some great some
[1:17:05] great potentate that said oh King I know
[1:17:07] where we'll go for the end the Bible
[1:17:08] says but one of the servants says there
[1:17:10] is a prophet his name's Elisha I thought
[1:17:13] yeah I wish I knew the servant's name
[1:17:15] that when they're all asking is there
[1:17:16] not a prophet somewhere but it took a
[1:17:18] little servant this little nobody was
[1:17:21] down there in the army they got they
[1:17:23] goty he got forced to be in the army
[1:17:24] proba didn't even want to be there
[1:17:26] forced to serve the king here he was a
[1:17:28] little slave of the king and that little
[1:17:29] slave went along with him in battle he
[1:17:31] didn't even want to be in the position
[1:17:32] they were in he didn't want to be in
[1:17:33] that condition they were in brother wesy
[1:17:35] but when they got in trouble and they
[1:17:37] said is are not a prophet that little
[1:17:38] servant said I may not know a lot oh
[1:17:40] King but I know who the prophet is I may
[1:17:42] not know all the answers but I know who
[1:17:44] the prophet is and his name's Elisha and
[1:17:47] matter of fact I know where he lives I
[1:17:48] know how to get a hold of him it took a
[1:17:51] servant to say there's a there's a
[1:17:53] Prophet by the name of Elisha he was the
[1:17:56] one he he was the one that glory to God
[1:17:57] I feel good this he he said he was the
[1:17:59] one that poured water over the hands of
[1:18:01] Elijah he's a great prophet see brother
[1:18:05] brother Mark here was the problem here
[1:18:07] they were overwhelmed in the desert with
[1:18:09] no water in the middle of a you could
[1:18:12] you could call it a drought cuz they had
[1:18:13] no water in the place that they were the
[1:18:15] enemy was banded against them they had
[1:18:17] nowhere to turn brother Bobby and then
[1:18:19] here Elisha the prophet would come and
[1:18:21] when Elisha spoke the answer that he
[1:18:23] came he said well sayeth the Lord make
[1:18:25] this Valley full of
[1:18:27] ditches what an odd answer we're in the
[1:18:31] middle of a drought we're thirsting to
[1:18:33] death we are are C we we we we can't
[1:18:35] hardly go another day and survive and
[1:18:38] the prophet that they inquired of gave
[1:18:40] them an answer and said dig a bunch of
[1:18:41] ditches from one end of this Valley to
[1:18:43] the other make the valley full of
[1:18:45] ditches can you imagine that answer and
[1:18:48] we're out here in the middle of a desert
[1:18:51] and you're and we're asking for water
[1:18:53] we're asking for something to qu our
[1:18:55] thirst and your answer is for me to dig
[1:18:58] ditches your answer for me is to do is
[1:19:00] to take a shovel and a and a pickax and
[1:19:03] a hammer and go to chunk and rock and
[1:19:05] and pile I wonder how many would look at
[1:19:07] that and say I'm not following after
[1:19:09] that well I don't even make sense why
[1:19:12] why would somebody tell you to go out
[1:19:13] and after all I can I can prove it to
[1:19:15] you by science that if you're if you're
[1:19:17] out of water and you're about to thirst
[1:19:19] to death that digg in a d ditch and
[1:19:21] sweating and all that that's going to
[1:19:22] make it quicker for you to die this I I
[1:19:24] can prove it to you this is bad
[1:19:26] advice you know what they did brother
[1:19:28] Mark they obeyed the Lord the Bible says
[1:19:31] they went to dig in the ditches I
[1:19:33] thought isn't it as they went to digging
[1:19:35] ditches do you realize that the whole
[1:19:37] time that they dug there was never a
[1:19:39] single sign of Deliverance hello
[1:19:42] somebody the whole time that they dug
[1:19:44] brother wesy there were here there there
[1:19:46] was not one sign of water every shovel
[1:19:49] full there was never a sign of water
[1:19:51] every Rock they threw out there was
[1:19:53] never a sign of water there was not
[1:19:54] nothing there some Supernatural
[1:19:56] happening every time they dug something
[1:19:58] there was a little drop and there was a
[1:19:59] little drop they dug and dug and dug and
[1:20:02] they saw no water you say well what you
[1:20:05] know how easy it would have been to give
[1:20:06] up digging you how many how many ever
[1:20:08] felt that way I trying to commit my life
[1:20:10] to God but there ain't nothing moving
[1:20:12] I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to get get
[1:20:14] on on the on the right path but there
[1:20:16] ain't nothing moving I'm trying to
[1:20:18] commit everything the Lord but but there
[1:20:19] ain't no sensation there there ain't no
[1:20:21] feeling I all that that I'm trying to do
[1:20:23] everything but I'm getting nothing out
[1:20:25] of it there was no there was no proof
[1:20:29] there was no there was no proof of water
[1:20:31] you say well what they do all they could
[1:20:33] go on was thus sayeth the Lord this is
[1:20:35] what Elisha said he said for thus sayeth
[1:20:38] the Lord You shall not see wind neither
[1:20:41] shall you see rain but the valley shall
[1:20:43] be filled with water that you may drink
[1:20:46] that both you and your cattle and your
[1:20:48] Beast for Mar and the Bible said and
[1:20:50] then Elisha said and this is just a
[1:20:52] light thing in the sight of the Lord for
[1:20:54] he will also deliver the moabites into
[1:20:57] your
[1:20:58] hands think about it every enemy every
[1:21:03] the very thing that would that would
[1:21:04] cause all of the problem that was going
[1:21:06] on all all this trial these were men
[1:21:09] listen friends these were men that
[1:21:12] allowed the sins of jeroboam to remain
[1:21:14] in Israel these were men that if you
[1:21:17] looked at them and said well the
[1:21:18] Judgment of God ought to be struck on
[1:21:20] them and they should never they should
[1:21:21] never be out of that but you realize but
[1:21:23] they're not the one that they're not the
[1:21:24] one that placed that calf there and God
[1:21:26] had mercy upon them and he looked at
[1:21:28] them they're not the one that that that
[1:21:30] that put them themselves and they just
[1:21:31] followed some bad advice man I'm G to
[1:21:34] preach a minute but they just followed
[1:21:35] some bad advice and it got him into that
[1:21:37] situation he said but God but God saw
[1:21:39] him there he said you you'll not see it
[1:21:41] but thus sayith the Lord he'll bring you
[1:21:42] out here there's many today that are
[1:21:45] preparing they prepare for a feeling
[1:21:47] they're preparing for a refilling of the
[1:21:49] Holy Ghost they want to be filled up
[1:21:50] with God you realize that sometimes our
[1:21:52] lives they get so filled with many
[1:21:55] things but empty of the spirit of God
[1:21:58] you say well what do you do when it gets
[1:21:59] like that when you start
[1:22:01] digging what do you do when my life's so
[1:22:03] filled with many things but it but I
[1:22:05] just can't break through anymore you
[1:22:07] start digging well what do you dig out
[1:22:09] brother man well the more you dig out
[1:22:11] the more room for God there is so if you
[1:22:14] say well how much do I dig well let me
[1:22:15] ask you this how much God do you want
[1:22:18] how how long should I dig well how how
[1:22:20] much God do you want in you anyway what
[1:22:22] kind of relationship with God do you
[1:22:23] want to have what you just keep digging
[1:22:25] the more room you dig or the more you
[1:22:27] dig the more room for the supernatural
[1:22:29] the more you dig the more room for the
[1:22:30] Holy Ghost you realize they just kept
[1:22:33] digging and digging to make room for
[1:22:37] water you think of this they followed a
[1:22:39] compass into
[1:22:41] trouble brother Joe they didn't they
[1:22:44] they followed a a leading into that the
[1:22:45] compass but you realize that that
[1:22:47] Compass I I don't have time to get into
[1:22:49] this but that Compass It could only
[1:22:50] guide them in geographical things it it
[1:22:53] was an Earthly compass what they needed
[1:22:55] was a spiritual Compass see the natural
[1:22:57] Compass took them only so far to where
[1:22:59] they were in trouble and then they had
[1:23:01] to find another Compass so see they they
[1:23:04] the Bible says they followed a compass
[1:23:06] for seven days they wound up defeated
[1:23:08] they were on the brink of Destruction
[1:23:09] they were in the middle of a drought
[1:23:11] what that Compass did for seven days is
[1:23:13] it brought all the kings together in one
[1:23:15] unified cause and it led them into a
[1:23:18] drought into a famine and it took the
[1:23:20] spirit of Elijah to bring them out of it
[1:23:23] I thought isn't that the way it was in
[1:23:25] the days of of Second Kings and and
[1:23:28] brother Mark in the days today it's the
[1:23:30] same I thought isn't that odd that they
[1:23:31] followed a compass for seven days you
[1:23:33] ever think about the church history and
[1:23:35] look where we've came since the time of
[1:23:37] Jesus Christ you you go all through the
[1:23:39] history and I I won't I've got pages of
[1:23:41] it but but you can in in the 1500s when
[1:23:44] when Martin Luther raised up and he put
[1:23:45] the the 95 thesis on on the on the on
[1:23:49] the the Wittenberg door and and then and
[1:23:51] then we go we see how that he translated
[1:23:54] the the New Testament into a German
[1:23:55] Bible and then and then three years
[1:23:57] later William tendel he he makes he
[1:24:00] makes another Bible in the English trans
[1:24:02] translation they're they're trying to
[1:24:03] get the word of God out you listen what
[1:24:05] they're they're following a compass
[1:24:07] Through the Ages and God is using these
[1:24:09] men but you notice as as these things
[1:24:12] begin to grow and the Bible begins to be
[1:24:14] printed and people get it that all of a
[1:24:16] sudden just because they're doing
[1:24:17] something good don't mean that Satan
[1:24:19] ain't there trying to upset the program
[1:24:21] of God so here are these Great Men of
[1:24:23] God that are doing good things but I'm
[1:24:25] Mark and they're trying to to follow the
[1:24:27] lord and they're they're following but
[1:24:28] you notice what happened to the church
[1:24:29] over this time you see so many great men
[1:24:32] John Smith when he raised up in 1609 he
[1:24:35] formed the Baptist Church 1735 George
[1:24:38] Whitefield was converted to Christ he
[1:24:39] became one of the greatest evangelist
[1:24:41] that the world had ever seen John Wesley
[1:24:43] in 1738 he was he was converted it's
[1:24:46] what started the the work of the
[1:24:47] Methodist Church after that and then we
[1:24:49] we see as As Time continued to go on in
[1:24:53] 1870 the Vatican listen all this is
[1:24:55] happening in history as these churches
[1:24:57] are being formed and leaders are
[1:24:59] starting these works but the and then in
[1:25:01] 1870 the Vatican Council comes out and
[1:25:04] announces that the church or the the
[1:25:07] pope is now infallible just like God so
[1:25:10] in 1870 no longer was he just a
[1:25:12] figurehead but he became infallible so
[1:25:14] that means whatever word that he says
[1:25:16] from now on it's going to be God
[1:25:18] speaking so you see how that the
[1:25:19] churches and it just seems to kind of
[1:25:21] finger off in so many different
[1:25:23] directions 1872 Jehovah's Witness
[1:25:26] started 1906 the isza Street Revival
[1:25:29] lunch a Pentecostal movement in 1914 the
[1:25:32] Assemblies of God denomination was
[1:25:33] founded everybody's looking for a place
[1:25:35] or they're looking for a place to to
[1:25:37] worship they're looking for a direction
[1:25:39] they're looking for the leadership of
[1:25:40] God everybody's looking for the right
[1:25:42] answer centuries of time brother Mark
[1:25:45] referred to by the theological world as
[1:25:47] a modern era premodern era Middle Ages
[1:25:49] late ancient era 2,000 years have gone
[1:25:52] by but now 2 years later we come to a
[1:25:56] place of this Great Famine where we
[1:25:58] would have a full revelation of what the
[1:26:00] Bible prophesies of the age that we're
[1:26:02] living in it was never prophesied that
[1:26:04] it would be until now but it was
[1:26:06] prophesied it would be here this is what
[1:26:07] Paul said remember I'm just going to
[1:26:09] quote this but Paul said but in the ages
[1:26:11] to come he might show you mighty things
[1:26:13] so Paul knew that there was coming ages
[1:26:16] after after Christ had had left the
[1:26:18] Earth he said there's coming ages
[1:26:20] Revelations the second and third chapter
[1:26:21] the whole entire chapters actually talk
[1:26:24] about the ages that are coming from the
[1:26:26] time of Christ unto the unto the angel
[1:26:28] of the church I speak this you know all
[1:26:30] all the way through both he says but
[1:26:32] notice as these Ages come the world
[1:26:34] calls them era the world calls them time
[1:26:36] periods but but Paul said there's ages
[1:26:38] that are coming butam said now he said
[1:26:40] we see these seven Church ages that
[1:26:42] we've gone through but notice what the
[1:26:44] purpose of the revelation of this was
[1:26:46] today but said it wasn't sent to destroy
[1:26:49] people let me tell you why that God
[1:26:50] would send the spirit of Elijah in the
[1:26:52] age that we live in he said see it was
[1:26:54] wasn't sent to destroy people it was
[1:26:56] sent as a message of Mercy to turn
[1:26:58] people back to God he said now these
[1:27:01] little messages out of the Book of
[1:27:02] Revelation they are directed to the
[1:27:04] church he said I wish everyone would
[1:27:06] bear this in mind that they are not
[1:27:08] directed towards anybody's religion or
[1:27:10] any other motive only just to be my best
[1:27:13] of knowledge to the reading and the
[1:27:14] explaining of the word of God it's not
[1:27:16] to push through selfish motive it's not
[1:27:18] directed towards anybody or any
[1:27:20] individual or anybody's church or
[1:27:22] anybody's religion but the reason listen
[1:27:25] now but the reason that I like to teach
[1:27:27] on this Revelation here at the
[1:27:29] Tabernacle being my own church why I
[1:27:32] feel like I'm home and I know that I
[1:27:35] kind of give my sheep the kind of diet
[1:27:37] that I think they need a't that
[1:27:40] something here stands a prophet of God
[1:27:42] they're starting all kinds of churches
[1:27:44] they're preaching all kinds of doctrines
[1:27:46] he said but look where we came from
[1:27:47] here's where we are and here's where
[1:27:49] we're going and the reason that I'm
[1:27:51] feeding this to this church is because I
[1:27:53] feel like my sheep need a certain kind
[1:27:55] of diet see we're not but Mark we're not
[1:27:58] trying to be famous that's why we eat on
[1:28:00] this diet we're not trying to be to fit
[1:28:03] in into denomination that's why we feed
[1:28:05] on this diet we're not trying to build
[1:28:07] some great church or be established or
[1:28:08] to get the world to recognize who we are
[1:28:10] or to recognize us as some great
[1:28:12] movement that's why we're feeding on
[1:28:13] this diet said I feed on them because
[1:28:16] they need that kind of I thought they
[1:28:18] need that kind of diet I thought they
[1:28:20] needed it there's a people brother Mark
[1:28:22] that needs a that need a special kind of
[1:28:24] die you know why we're not preparing to
[1:28:26] stay we're preparing for a Rapture
[1:28:28] that's why we're not preparing to fit in
[1:28:30] the world we're preparing to leave the
[1:28:31] world that's why the food's a little bit
[1:28:33] different that's why when sometimes when
[1:28:35] people come they say well them people
[1:28:37] man they get into some stuff I never
[1:28:38] heard before it's a special diet it's
[1:28:41] prepared for a certain kind of people
[1:28:43] say what kind of people in the time of
[1:28:45] famine God's people will be satisfied
[1:28:47] there's going to be something that God
[1:28:48] has prepared for his children in the
[1:28:50] last day that'll take them through the
[1:28:52] famine that is upon the land
[1:28:54] that's why we preach the message brother
[1:28:56] Mar it's the same message Paul preached
[1:28:58] even when he didn't have a full
[1:28:59] revelation of it but here the brother
[1:29:01] man would come and say I preach what
[1:29:02] Paul preached and that same message
[1:29:05] today is still feeding the church since
[1:29:08] the time of Christ you think about it in
[1:29:10] the seven and I'm I'm closing in the
[1:29:13] since the time of Christ in the middle
[1:29:15] through these seven Church ages you
[1:29:16] think about what has happened what these
[1:29:18] churches and these men I didn't go
[1:29:20] through them all but but but these these
[1:29:22] men these the the all through 2,000
[1:29:25] years that have got ideas and theologies
[1:29:27] and they all came from different groups
[1:29:29] but you realize that they followed a
[1:29:31] compass that led them right into the
[1:29:33] middle of leod deia I thought that was
[1:29:36] something in Second Kings they followed
[1:29:37] a compass seven days now we've seen the
[1:29:39] church World follow follow a compass
[1:29:41] through seven Church ages and it brought
[1:29:43] them right into the middle of leod DEA
[1:29:45] what is it it's a spiritual drought it's
[1:29:47] a famine in the land it's a hunger and a
[1:29:49] thirst for the word of God they follow
[1:29:51] the compass and what they done is they
[1:29:53] went out you think think about it in the
[1:29:54] middle of all this they form what is
[1:29:56] called the the the the uh the the the
[1:29:59] the fellowship of churches or or they
[1:30:01] United together with the the World
[1:30:02] Council of churches they United together
[1:30:04] with these great fellowships and great
[1:30:06] councils and and they became more
[1:30:08] concerned with with whose card their
[1:30:10] name was on and how many members they
[1:30:12] had and they they got more concerned
[1:30:14] with the wrong things even though they
[1:30:15] were unified and they came together for
[1:30:18] a unified cause they came right into the
[1:30:20] middle of leod deia all unified together
[1:30:22] and still in the middle of a drought and
[1:30:24] still in the middle of a famine and I
[1:30:26] thank God that somebody had enough
[1:30:28] wisdom to say but is there a prophet in
[1:30:30] the land that can find us a word of the
[1:30:32] Lord and I thank God that there's still
[1:30:34] a servant here to say in the middle of a
[1:30:36] famine in the middle of a drought in the
[1:30:38] middle of failure there somebody we can
[1:30:40] look to that still has the answer many
[1:30:43] find their s here brother Mah they
[1:30:45] followed the wrong compass and it led
[1:30:47] them to they man let me tell you friends
[1:30:49] people's spiritual Compass is so messed
[1:30:51] up they can't even find their way to
[1:30:52] church anymore their Compass gets so
[1:30:54] messed up they can't find their way to
[1:30:56] prayer meeting they can't find their way
[1:30:58] on their knees before God their their
[1:31:00] worldly Compass has taken
[1:31:03] over it can't they can't ain't no time
[1:31:05] to have a relationship with God ain't no
[1:31:08] the the compass don't don't give them
[1:31:09] the leading that God would give this
[1:31:12] worldly Compass has led people to an
[1:31:13] intellectual gospel into an intellectual
[1:31:16] relationship with God you realize God
[1:31:17] never called for that he didn't call for
[1:31:19] an intellectual relationship he called
[1:31:21] for a spiritual relationship wasn't an
[1:31:23] intellectual understanding it was a
[1:31:24] spiritual understanding it wasn't
[1:31:26] intellectual knowledge it was a
[1:31:27] spiritual knowledge but you see the
[1:31:29] situations people are in you find out
[1:31:31] they've used the wrong Compass think
[1:31:34] about it even even Earthly things you
[1:31:37] think about you take a magnetic compass
[1:31:38] how many of you ever used a compass as
[1:31:40] the music players want to come you take
[1:31:42] a compass you realize that a compass you
[1:31:44] can take a compass and it'll still fail
[1:31:46] you you you say well what would cause a
[1:31:48] a compass to to malfunction you well it
[1:31:51] works off the off the magnetic field of
[1:31:53] the Earth so you could take a compass
[1:31:55] and you know I thought this was such a
[1:31:57] such a true statement said but a natural
[1:32:00] Compass it can malfunction because it
[1:32:02] could possibly caused by external
[1:32:05] influences or another magnetic field
[1:32:08] that would draw it in the wrong
[1:32:09] direction is't that something an
[1:32:12] external influence God gave us a compass
[1:32:16] but sometimes that Compass sometimes if
[1:32:18] you get the if you get to use in a
[1:32:19] worldly Compass you get to use in a a
[1:32:22] church Compass or something some some
[1:32:24] denomination Compass you could hold that
[1:32:27] but external influence it could it gets
[1:32:30] off they go this way that way objects
[1:32:34] they fall they go wrong way they you
[1:32:37] realize that when they were these
[1:32:39] Earthly objects fail but the mark thing
[1:32:42] because that's what we've relied
[1:32:44] on these great things that great
[1:32:46] churches that people relied on but it
[1:32:48] led them into a famine LED them into a
[1:32:51] drought but you realize that whenever
[1:32:54] your compass fails I want to let me just
[1:32:56] ask you this how many's ever wound up
[1:32:58] somewhere you didn't intend on be it see
[1:33:01] because sometimes we take the wrong
[1:33:03] Compass can just be real sometimes you
[1:33:06] get the wrong compass and you get to
[1:33:08] fall on the wrong that leads you down
[1:33:10] past you don't mean to go down places
[1:33:11] you shouldn't go you wind up how in the
[1:33:14] world I ever get hear external
[1:33:16] forces just pulling pulls it out but
[1:33:19] what we need is we need a different kind
[1:33:21] of compass that ain't EarthBound
[1:33:24] see that Earthly Compass you can make
[1:33:26] the best one it can be goldplated put
[1:33:28] diamond bezel it'll still get off so
[1:33:32] there has to be a compass something that
[1:33:34] we can look to brother Mark that don't
[1:33:35] ever get off said see so what God done
[1:33:38] is God put something in the heavens that
[1:33:40] just can't
[1:33:41] fail you go outside tonight brother Mark
[1:33:45] and you get to looking up in the sky
[1:33:47] you'll find that you'll find that load
[1:33:48] star they call it the Post Star the
[1:33:50] North Star you can go out and any of you
[1:33:53] ever studied the Stars I always I I've
[1:33:55] been a bit of that guilty of that myself
[1:33:58] but you go out on the Big Dipper and you
[1:33:59] take the last two stars of it you can
[1:34:01] run you a straight line from the end of
[1:34:02] those and you'll see on the on the The
[1:34:04] Little Dipper the the very last star in
[1:34:06] the handle of it that's the North Star
[1:34:08] you can always find it whenever you find
[1:34:11] that it don't matter it don't matter
[1:34:13] where you're lost anywhere in the
[1:34:14] northern hemisphere you can see the
[1:34:16] North Star and it remains true and the
[1:34:18] reason it remains true is because it
[1:34:20] sits in the a in the axis of the center
[1:34:23] of the Earth from the rotation of the
[1:34:24] earth and so because it sits in the axis
[1:34:27] it don't matter anywhere in the
[1:34:28] hemisphere that you look up it's always
[1:34:30] going to be North so don't matter if
[1:34:32] you're in Colorado it don't matter if
[1:34:33] you're over there in China anywhere in
[1:34:35] the northern hemisphere you can always
[1:34:36] see the North Star said see so no matter
[1:34:39] where the Earth is turning brother B
[1:34:41] said no matter where the Earth is
[1:34:42] turning the North Star always remains it
[1:34:44] points towards north it's the only true
[1:34:46] star he said it's an extreme North Star
[1:34:49] and it gives you your direction so even
[1:34:51] when your Earthly Compass will fail you
[1:34:54] but that can never fail he said and
[1:34:56] that's what Christ is to you if you want
[1:34:58] to go to heaven if you want to be saved
[1:35:01] if you want to be filled with the spirit
[1:35:02] of God if you want to be Christlike
[1:35:04] Christ is your North Star if you're lost
[1:35:06] don't take a Creed he's your North Star
[1:35:08] he's your way he's your direction and if
[1:35:11] you'll take him as your North Star then
[1:35:12] it absolutely places the Holy Spirit as
[1:35:15] your
[1:35:16] compass the Holy Spirit becomes your
[1:35:18] compass It'll point you to the North
[1:35:19] Star if you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:21] Ghost it can't help but point you to
[1:35:23] Christ and Christ is the word that's the
[1:35:25] only way you'll ever find your way back
[1:35:28] many are lost in the wilderness brother
[1:35:30] Mark but if you ever look to that he
[1:35:32] said it'll lead you back all kinds of
[1:35:35] stars you realize you realize why you
[1:35:37] can't pick another star why can't you
[1:35:38] pick another star that's in the little
[1:35:40] dier let me tell you why brother wesy
[1:35:42] because as the Earth is rotating and you
[1:35:44] look at that star that star one day
[1:35:45] it'll be over here and the next day
[1:35:47] it'll be over here the next day it'll be
[1:35:49] down here but because the one is in the
[1:35:51] center of the axis it never moves and
[1:35:53] always remains North the other's kind of
[1:35:56] changing it kind of changes the
[1:35:57] direction where you would look but the
[1:35:59] North Start it'll never change say see
[1:36:01] so you can look at all the other stars
[1:36:03] and say well that one's shining so maybe
[1:36:05] I'll go after it a little while but
[1:36:06] you'll wind up somewhere
[1:36:08] else this is an easy experiment just go
[1:36:11] outside and find a star and start
[1:36:12] walking so man go after this one a
[1:36:14] little bit that one's shining you got
[1:36:16] somewhere else but you got to get
[1:36:18] somewhere where you're absolutely
[1:36:19] established he say so Christ is our
[1:36:21] North Star and the compass always points
[1:36:24] that way and if you're really saved and
[1:36:26] you really only one and the really only
[1:36:28] way you can be saved is through Christ
[1:36:29] the Holy Spirit be in your compass he
[1:36:31] will guide you right straight to the
[1:36:32] word he said that's wonderful the word
[1:36:34] and the Christ is one both of them the
[1:36:37] selfsame he is your North Star and if he
[1:36:39] is your North Star he'll become your
[1:36:42] absolute as you stand to your feet this
[1:36:44] morning see as far as a a natural
[1:36:47] Compass brother Mark they' take you as
[1:36:49] far as it could take you they had to
[1:36:51] turn to a spiritual one they turn the
[1:36:53] prophet Elisha he said thus sayth the
[1:36:55] Lord make a valley full of
[1:36:58] ditches and then God will come and save
[1:37:00] you your animals will be fed you'll be
[1:37:03] fed in this time of famine and
[1:37:05] nevertheless that's just a light thing
[1:37:06] for the Lord to feed you but I'll defeat
[1:37:08] your enemy and so they dug and dug and
[1:37:11] dug and the Bible says that all of a
[1:37:13] sudden after they dug this that when
[1:37:16] they dug to the place that God thought
[1:37:18] it was
[1:37:19] enough they dug out but Mark if you want
[1:37:22] to get anywhere with God you dig they
[1:37:23] dug out until it was enough and then the
[1:37:26] Bible said and then there was
[1:37:28] water God flooded the valley let me tell
[1:37:31] you what the valley did it was so much
[1:37:32] water they drank and that great Army of
[1:37:35] Moab they came up over the mountain and
[1:37:38] they looked down in the valley and the
[1:37:40] Bible says when they looked at the
[1:37:41] valley that the sun Shone on the water
[1:37:43] in such a way that the water looked red
[1:37:46] and the moabites said well it's blood
[1:37:49] they've all gotten a fight and they
[1:37:51] they've all destroyed theel we don't
[1:37:53] need weapons let's just go gather the
[1:37:54] spoils the battle's over so that great
[1:37:57] moabit Army walked right down into the
[1:37:59] valley full of ditches and the children
[1:38:02] of God brother Mark that was restored
[1:38:04] the ones that had turned to the words of
[1:38:06] Elisha the one they had they had forgot
[1:38:09] about all their own Direction and their
[1:38:11] own questions and and they they had
[1:38:12] turned their heart back to what Elisha
[1:38:15] said they took their weapons in their
[1:38:17] hand and they slew every moabit they
[1:38:21] slew every enemy they slew every thing
[1:38:24] that would come against their family you
[1:38:26] realize what Moab wanted they wanted to
[1:38:28] destroy their homes they wanted to
[1:38:29] destroy the fathers they wanted to
[1:38:31] destroy their families their churches
[1:38:33] everything they stood for they wanted to
[1:38:34] tear them down to nothing but God gave
[1:38:36] them the power to overcome their enemy
[1:38:38] you say brother man what I got to do
[1:38:40] this morning if you want to overcome go
[1:38:42] dig a ditch what I got to dig you dig
[1:38:44] everything out well well brother you
[1:38:46] know I've been going to church a long

[1:39:17] you want to have nothing having nothing
[1:39:19] so you can depend on your own self
[1:39:21] anything you can do it takes a complete
[1:39:23] toal surrender of your weaknesses unto

[1:39:28] ability I can trust in he said and God
[1:39:30] will take always a nobody and make them
[1:39:32] a somebody said what about the big
[1:39:35] somebodies that are already somebodies
[1:39:37] there ain't no room for them there's
[1:39:38] room for them tell you what the prophet
[1:39:40] said he said if you're a somebody what
[1:39:42] you ought to do is just become a nobody
[1:39:44] and then let God make you a real
[1:39:46] somebody so no matter who we are dig it
[1:39:50] out total surrenderance he said that's
[1:39:52] what it takes it takes it takes taking

[1:40:00] Nobles and the educated and the
[1:40:01] celebrities and he found a bunch of
[1:40:03] nobodies and he made some bodies he used
[1:40:06] them said this is what we do say what do
[1:40:09] we do brother the Mark we take when we
[1:40:11] surrender to God you dig things out of
[1:40:14] your life what is that it's a sign of
[1:40:16] surrenderance Lord I don't know where it
[1:40:18] came from but I don't want it no more
[1:40:19] how many say that this morning I wonder

[1:40:43] satisfied in the time of a famine a
[1:40:46] total surrenderance everybody said let
[1:40:48] me tell you what will happen he said
[1:40:50] when you surrender to God he said that's
[1:40:52] what Paul done Paul was a scholarly man
[1:40:54] he but he forgot everything he knew in
[1:40:56] order to know Christ Paul said I'm
[1:40:58] determined to know nothing except Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ and him crucified he became a
[1:41:03] nobody he wasn't a know it all he was a
[1:41:06] no nothing he was a nobody he said I
[1:41:07] don't know nothing except Jesus Christ
[1:41:10] and God used him in a mighty way because
[1:41:12] he was committed to surrendering fully
[1:41:15] unto God but said think about this how
[1:41:18] many knows this today that God has
[1:41:20] enough power to overcome how many
[1:41:21] believes that God can he can destroy
[1:41:24] every enemy he can defeat every battle
[1:41:26] he's he's an omnipotent God how many
[1:41:28] believes that say Amen let me tell you
[1:41:30] what the prophet of God said he said if
[1:41:31] you'll take a man that is total
[1:41:33] surrendered that man is omnipotent just
[1:41:36] like God
[1:41:37] is a man that is totally surrendered is
[1:41:40] omnipotent think about it we believe God
[1:41:43] is but what about you overcoming he said
[1:41:45] if you'll totally surrender you're
[1:41:47] omnipotent that's what Jesus said in the
[1:41:49] Book of Mark he said ask anything in my
[1:41:51] name and it shall be given unto you they
[1:41:53] become om nied brother Braham said when
[1:41:55] you surrender your life fully he'll come
[1:41:57] in fully but until you surrender he
[1:41:59] can't come in fully so surrender every
[1:42:01] thought surrender your thinking
[1:42:03] Surrender Your Life Surrender Your all
[1:42:05] surrender your prestige surrender
[1:42:07] everything to him now and he'll come in
