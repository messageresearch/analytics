[3:36] So I
[3:39] [Music]
[5:10] Thank you, Lord. Let's all stand and
[5:12] sing that chorus again. So I say
[5:15] thanks for loving
[5:18] me, for you have
[5:20] set my spirit free.
[5:24] Well, I'm not
[5:25] what I used to
[5:28] be. So I say thank you, Lord, for loving
[5:33] me. Oh, I know you kept on loving when
[5:37] no love was returned. Oh, and you kept
[5:41] on blessing me when I did not deserve.
[5:45] You've been the dearest friend that
[5:48] anyone can be. And I said, "Thank you,
[5:51] Lord, for loving me.
[5:54] And I say
[5:56] thanks for loving
[5:58] me. For you have
[6:01] set my spirit
[6:03] free. Well, I'm not
[6:06] one I used to
[6:08] be. So I say, "Thank you, Lord, for
[6:12] loving
[6:14] me." Oh, my empty heart was heavy. Had
[6:18] no one even to care. My life was full of
[6:22] misery and no one else would share. My
[6:26] spirit was in prison and I could not
[6:29] find the key. Oh, then he opened up my
[6:32] heart. Why don't you turn around, shake
[6:34] your neighbor's hands? Oh,
[6:36] thanks for loving
[6:39] me. For you have
[6:41] set my spirit
[6:44] free, for I'm not
[6:47] what I used to be.
[6:50] Oh, I said, "Thank you, Lord." Let's
[6:53] sing that second verse again. Oh, my
[6:56] empty heart was heavy and no one seemed
[7:00] to care. My life was full of misery and
[7:04] no one else would share. My spirit was
[7:07] in prison and I could not find the key.
[7:10] But I said, "Thanks you, Lord, for
[7:13] loving me."
[7:15] So I say
[7:17] thanks for loving
[7:19] me. Oh, you have
[7:22] set my spirit
[7:24] free. For I'm not
[7:27] what I used to
[7:29] be. Oh, I say thank. I'll sing that
[7:33] chorus once more. Oh, I say
[7:37] thanks for loving me.
[7:40] For you have
[7:42] set my spirit
[7:44] free. Well, I'm not walking. I used to
[7:49] be. Oh, I said, "Thank you, Lord, for
[7:53] loving
[7:54] me." Amen. Give the Lord a hand, clap a
[7:57] praise this
[7:58] morning. Oh, aren't you thankful that he
[8:01] loves you? How many you can say, "You're
[8:03] blessed this morning." Let's sing that
[8:05] little chorus. I am blessed. I am
[8:07] blessed. Every day that we live, we have
[8:09] a reason to praise
[8:11] him. Oh, I am
[8:14] blessed. I am
[8:16] blessed. Oh, every day that I live, I am
[8:21] blessed. Oh, when I wake up in the
[8:24] morning and I lay my head to rest, I am
[8:28] blessed. Yes, I am. Oh, sing it again.
[8:32] Oh, I am
[8:34] blessed. I am blessed.

[21:43] [Music]
[21:57] Mama and daddy talked about going home
[22:02] since I was just a babe on their
[22:06] knees. They said that nothing compared
[22:09] to what was waiting up there. How one
[22:13] day we would finally be free.
[22:18] But I've never seen it. But I keep on
[22:22] believing it'll be a place like I've
[22:25] never
[22:26] known. I keep my eyes on the sky. Cuz my
[22:31] soul wants to
[22:32] fly. Oh, the moon is ready to go.
[22:39] I want to know how it
[22:43] feels to make my way down the streets of
[22:48] gold. I want to know how it
[22:53] feels to have a talk with the saints of
[22:58] all. I want to know what it's
[23:02] like to rest my feet by the river of
[23:07] life.
[23:09] I've heard of heaven and I know that
[23:11] it's
[23:13] real. I want to know how it
[23:17] [Music]
[23:19] feels. Sometimes I get weary from this
[23:23] life that I live. It seems that peace is
[23:27] something I'll never find.
[23:30] I tried a lot in my low and all that
[23:34] I've got to show is 700 things on my
[23:40] mind. Now I'm seeing visions of a
[23:44] crystal clear river where peace gotten
[23:48] without a
[23:49] trace. More than I've ever dreamed. My
[23:54] eyes long to see the look of love on my
[23:58] Savior's
[23:59] [Music]
[24:01] face. I want to know how it
[24:06] feels to make my way down the street of
[24:11] all. I want to know how it
[24:16] feels to have a talk with the saints of
[24:21] all. I want to know what it's
[24:26] like to rest my feet by the river of
[24:31] life. I've heard of heaven and I know
[24:34] that it's
[24:36] real. I want to know how it
[24:41] feels. I've heard of heaven and I know
[24:44] that it's
[24:46] real. I want to know how it feels.

[24:58] longing for that day.

[25:04] to labor and then you know he talked

[25:08] given that illustration of Carter or
[25:10] Salem. You know all it takes is one step
[25:13] one didn't mention it to the other. And
[25:14] this song came on my heart and it was
[25:16] just burning with me and burning all
[25:17] week. And thought about that story of
[25:20] Enoch. You know, I love Enoch cuz all it
[25:22] says is he walked with God. That's all
[25:24] he did. He just walked with God daily.
[25:26] Walked with him. And then one day he
[25:27] just took a step and he was into that
[25:30] next dimension. I just began to think of
[25:31] this song. You know, one day we're going
[25:34] to take a step and all our burdens will
[25:36] be laid aside. All our trials will be
[25:39] over. We're going to be over there
[25:41] worship him, praising him, our Lord with
[25:43] the saints that have gone on before and

[25:47] just sing this
[25:48] song. One day I'm going to take a step
[25:54] toward my

[26:01] step into my Theophony.
[26:05] One day I know that final step it's
[26:10] going to set me free by the
[26:15] offening I hear it calling
[26:20] me. Oh don't you worry little
[26:25] children should death just knock on your
[26:28] door. Don't you know that death is a
[26:32] doorway that leads to the heavenly
[26:35] shore? Oh, over there is no heartache,
[26:41] no sorrow, grief or pain, just perfect
[26:45] love, oh peace and joy be all prepared.
[26:51] One day I'm going to take a step toward
[26:56] my

[34:19] meetings, so they wasn't able to come to
[34:22] all the the meetings, but she still
[34:24] showed up for a service or two. So she
[34:28] had second day of being alive. I think
[34:30] she was at a at a church meeting. So
[34:32] this girl starting off on the right
[34:34] track. Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[34:38] and gracious heavenly father. Lord, how
[34:42] privileged that we are, Lord, this
[34:44] morning to hold this child, Lord, this
[34:48] newborn baby, Lord, that's so innocent
[34:51] in her birth and actions. And Lord, here
[34:55] we just realize, Lord, that no matter
[34:58] the innocence that we have, Lord, that
[35:00] we still have to come back to you. And
[35:03] Lord, I see the zeal on this mother and
[35:06] father's heart, Lord, to raise their
[35:08] children, Lord, the right way. And Lord,
[35:11] they've dedicated their life and their
[35:13] family. And Lord, we just ask you take
[35:15] this child in your hands, Lord, little
[35:17] Marcela Joy. And Lord, we pray that you
[35:20] would bless her all the days of her
[35:21] life, Lord.
[35:22] God, that the word that she would hear,
[35:24] Lord, would inspire something in her.
[35:26] And Lord, to live a testimony of the
[35:28] life of Jesus Christ, Lord, may she be a
[35:32] blessing, Lord. And Lord, we thank you
[35:34] for her, Lord. And we just ask you that
[35:35] you would protect her in this family,
[35:37] Lord. And God, that you would use them
[35:39] in a special way. We pray in Jesus name.
[35:43] Amen. Amen. God bless
[35:48] you. Praise the Lord.
[35:53] Amen.
[35:57] Amen. I love you, little
[35:59] [Music]
[36:05] sister. Isn't that special? Amen. Praise
[36:09] the Lord. We just Brother Ben and uh
[36:13] Sister Rebecca, they just recently
[36:16] started coming to the church a couple of
[36:18] months back. So, certainly been a
[36:21] privilege to be able to get to know
[36:22] them. You know, we actually have a a
[36:25] few here this morning
[36:28] that maybe that some of us haven't met,
[36:31] but brother Elum uh here on the front
[36:34] row. He's a he's made this his home
[36:37] church, moved from Pennsylvania. And so,
[36:41] we welcome brother Elum here this
[36:42] morning. Also,
[36:44] [Applause]
[36:49] Um, Brother Ed and Sister Monica back
[36:52] there has made this their home church
[36:54] and here recently and and Kaitton and
[36:58] um,
[37:01] Brother Juan and Sister Cara right there
[37:04] and behind you. So,
[37:11] um, and then just recently, they come
[37:14] down today, um, but just got a house
[37:16] here. Brother John and Sister Sarah just
[37:19] moved here and they're right there in
[37:21] the
[37:24] middle. And so, we told we told Sister
[37:27] Sarah that she had to go by Sarah John.
[37:30] She said, "I don't understand that." So,
[37:32] well, there's a lot of there's a lot
[37:34] behind it, but my wife is Sarah Matt. My
[37:37] brother's wife is Sarah Mark. So, you
[37:38] got to be Sarah John. And we'll never
[37:39] keep any of
[37:42] you all all understood there. So, but we
[37:45] uh we sure appreciate y'all coming. Only
[37:48] reason I do that is cuz you as the
[37:50] churches is growing and uh you don't
[37:53] want people coming in and nobody knowing
[37:55] them and and we we were a family. So I
[37:58] do that on purpose not to embarrass
[38:00] anybody but so you can go shake their
[38:02] hand and say welcome and and sure good
[38:04] to have you and I and I want to be your
[38:06] brother or your sister. So, uh, that's
[38:08] that's what that's what we want
[38:14] here. People together of like precious
[38:16] faith. And, you know, it's not our it's
[38:19] not our desire to see how big of a
[38:21] church we can have or how many people
[38:22] can come to a church, but our reality
[38:25] the reality is is that we just want God
[38:27] to be in people. And so, uh, that's
[38:29] that's our real zeal here. And so, we we
[38:31] do our best to do that very thing. You
[38:33] know, um, I have to embarrass her this
[38:36] morning. I know we're getting ready for
[38:37] brother Andrew is going to preach for

[39:12] in the church and helping in that way
[39:14] and bringing her gift and and using it

[39:45] me from every
[39:48] fear. Those who look on

[44:43] this morning. He is in the He's in the
[44:45] house. Amen. And when he comes in,
[44:47] something good always happens. Amen. I
[44:49] believe this morning he's not in a tomb
[44:51] in Jerusalem. Neither do I believe he's
[44:54] in a grave in Jeffersonville, but I
[44:55] believe he's right here this morning.
[44:57] Amen. Alive and wellroed in the power of
[44:59] his resurrection. Amen. To do
[45:01] exceedingly abundantly above all. Amen.
[45:04] That we can ask or think. Ain't it good
[45:06] to be a Christian this morning? Amen.
[45:08] Such a such a wonderful atmosphere here
[45:10] in the house of God. And Amen. While
[45:12] he's moving this morning, let's just
[45:14] turn our attention to him for just a
[45:15] moment. And maybe we just bow our hearts
[45:17] together. Amen. I know there's many
[45:19] needs among us. I wonder how many this
[45:21] morning just say, "Lord, come by my way
[45:23] and speak to me." Amen. I know he sees
[45:25] every hand. He knows every need and
[45:28] every desire this morning. Let's just
[45:30] approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[45:32] your believers have gathered here on
[45:34] this resurrection Sunday, Father,
[45:36] knowing that it's not the day of the
[45:38] year that we call Easter, but Lord, in
[45:40] our hearts, it's Easter because you are
[45:42] alive and well. You're living and moving
[45:45] and breathing in the hearts of your
[45:46] redeemed children. And Lord, as we come
[45:49] before you this morning, we have nothing
[45:51] in ourselves to offer. But Lord, we bow
[45:54] our hearts in your presence this morning
[45:55] knowing there is an atonement. Lord,
[45:58] knowing there is still a sacrifice there
[46:00] that can erase the sins of our life, can
[46:02] remove the iniquities. Oh God, Lord, you
[46:05] can transform us by your transforming
[46:07] power. Lord, as we gather here this
[46:09] morning, we are indeed a needy people,
[46:12] but Lord, we're so thankful this
[46:13] morning. We're not coming before a stone
[46:16] or a a piece of wood or an idol, but
[46:18] Lord, we're coming prostrate before a
[46:20] living God this morning. And Lord, we're
[46:23] asking you to come among us in a special
[46:25] way. Lord, you see every hand that was
[46:27] raised, behind that hand there is a
[46:29] need. Whether it be a sickness, oh God,
[46:32] maybe a financial need, a material need,
[46:34] Lord, whatever the need would be this
[46:36] morning, you're still the God who
[46:38] supplies all of our needs according to
[46:40] your riches and glory. And this morning,
[46:42] Lord, we just want to say we love you.
[46:44] We thank you for your word. We thank you
[46:46] for the blessings that you've given us
[46:48] in this hour. And Lord, we pray this
[46:50] morning you'll come in this word that
[46:51] you've laid upon our heart. Move me
[46:53] aside, oh God. Speak through me, Lord.
[46:55] And may you hear through the believers
[46:57] this morning, Lord. May every demon be
[46:59] defeated here today, Lord. May every
[47:02] spirit be bound, oh God. And may
[47:04] liberation take place in the hearts and
[47:06] lives of your children. We commit this
[47:08] meeting this morning in thy faithful
[47:10] hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:12] Christ, we pray. And all the believers
[47:14] says, "Amen." Amen. And amen. Ain't it a
[47:17] beautiful day to serve the Lord? Amen.
[47:20] Want to say God bless you all this
[47:21] morning. We do count it a real honor and
[47:23] a privilege this morning to be home and
[47:25] to be here to speak to you. And we thank
[47:27] you, brother Matt, for this opportunity,
[47:28] the invitation. And Amen. How many
[47:30] appreciates our pastor this morning?
[47:32] Amen. Amen. There's one thing we know,
[47:35] amen, the vision of God that he laid on
[47:37] our pastor's heart is, Amen, has been
[47:39] well vindicated. And Amen. This is my
[47:42] first time speaking to you with the new
[47:43] pews. And Amen. So I'm trying to place
[47:45] everybody. Everybody's moved around a
[47:47] little bit, but Amen. Uh, last time we
[47:49] were here was during the meetings and
[47:50] the building was full then and it's full
[47:52] this morning. So, Amen. That's a good
[47:54] thing. Amen. And Amen. Sure. Glad to
[47:56] have my in-laws here with us today from
[47:58] North Carolina visiting. Amen. We sure
[48:01] love and appreciate them for amen making
[48:03] the trip out. And Amen. I think when
[48:05] they got out of the car at the house,
[48:06] the tornado siren was going off. So
[48:09] that's how we just welcome them to
[48:10] Arkansas. Just turn the tornado siren
[48:12] on. But Amen. We're sure glad to have
[48:14] them here. And Amen. And brother Matt, I
[48:16] think we can find him a house around
[48:17] here somewhere, can't we? Amen. Amen.
[48:20] Amen. God bless you all this morning. We
[48:22] sure glad to have you here. And if you
[48:24] have your Bibles this morning, we want
[48:25] to go to the book of St. Luke, the 24th
[48:27] chapter. St. Luke, chapter
[48:30] 24, their family so we can pull. Amen.
[48:35] St. Luke 24. And then we want to go to 1
[48:38] Timothy 3. Amen. Amen. I better clarify
[48:42] that. Amen. Amen. St. Luke
[48:46] 24, we want to look in the 49th verse
[48:49] and then we're going to go to 1 Timothy
[48:51] 3. But here in St. Luke 24:49, very
[48:54] familiar scripture. Jesus here speaking.
[48:57] He says, "And behold, I send the promise
[49:00] of my father upon you, but tear ye in
[49:04] the city of Jerusalem." Notice this,
[49:08] until you be endued with power from on
[49:11] high. So the waiting or the tearing was
[49:14] until they had been endued with power.
[49:17] Now I want you to notice where this
[49:19] power is coming from. It's coming from
[49:21] on high. Now in 1 Timothy chapter 3, 1
[49:25] Timothy chapter 3, I want to look there
[49:28] this morning in the 15th verse of 1
[49:32] Timothy
[49:35] 3. Paul here writing to Timothy. He
[49:38] says, "But if I tar long that thou
[49:42] mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
[49:44] thyself in the house of God." Now, I
[49:48] love how Paul uh defines this, the house
[49:50] of God. He says, "Which is the church of
[49:54] the living God." So, the house of the
[49:56] living God or the house of God is not
[49:58] just a building, but it's a people. The
[50:02] church of the living God, the pillar and
[50:05] ground of the truth. Now watch verse 16.
[50:08] And without controversy, great is the
[50:10] mystery of godliness. I love this. God
[50:14] was manifest in the flesh. Can I say it
[50:17] like this? God was manifest in the
[50:19] church. God was manifest in the flesh,
[50:23] justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
[50:25] preached unto the Gentiles, and believed
[50:28] on in the world, and received up into
[50:31] glory. We ask the Lord this morning to
[50:33] bless the reading of his word. As you
[50:35] can have your seats here today, uh I
[50:37] want to by the help of the Lord, if I
[50:38] would take a title this morning for just
[50:40] a few moments, I want to speak to you on
[50:42] this. I want to speak to you on the
[50:44] unlimited powerful church of the living
[50:47] God. The unlimited powerful church of
[50:50] the living God. I know uh this morning
[50:52] that we are not the only church, but I
[50:55] am sure honored and thankful to be a
[50:57] part of the many membered body of the
[51:00] church of the living God that's around
[51:02] the world. And I just have to say this
[51:04] this morning as a as a minister, you
[51:06] ministers, brother Joe, you know, when
[51:07] you preach, you have to preach from your
[51:09] heart or preach from what you believe or
[51:11] preach from your convictions. And if
[51:13] it's just okay this morning, I'm just
[51:14] going to say this. I believe, amen, that
[51:17] Grace Tabernacle is a part of the
[51:19] powerful church. Amen. I believe that
[51:21] this is more than just another church or
[51:24] just another gathering of people. But I
[51:26] believe, amen, that our eyes are
[51:28] beholding the miracles and the and the
[51:30] glories of Almighty God that's being
[51:32] revealed in this generation. Amen. Right
[51:35] here in our midst, not a 100 miles away
[51:37] or 500 miles away. Amen. But right here
[51:40] in our midst, God is revealing himself.
[51:43] Amen. By the promises of his word. Now,
[51:46] amen. Speaking of this church, a few
[51:48] quotations from brother Brand of 1954.
[51:50] He says, "I am positive of this one
[51:52] thing that God will have a church. It'll
[51:56] be without spot, without wrinkle or
[51:58] blemish." Again, passing spirits. He
[52:00] said, "I am positive, sure this morning
[52:02] that if men and women could only get
[52:05] into the position of where their soul
[52:07] and their thinking and their attitudes,
[52:10] amen, would be perfect in the sight of
[52:12] God." He said, "That would be one of the
[52:14] most powerful churches that ever
[52:16] existed." Amen. when their thinking,
[52:18] their soul and their attitudes, amen,
[52:21] come in align with God, amen, that will
[52:24] be one of the most powerful churches
[52:26] that ever existed. Another place here in
[52:28] what does it take to make a Christian
[52:30] life? I want you to listen to this
[52:31] quote. He said, "Now, if the church of
[52:34] the living God, which is the pillar of
[52:36] truth, Amen. God intended this church to
[52:39] be a powerful church, a glorious church,
[52:43] a church that the whole world could look
[52:45] upon as a bride of Christ. Amen. Well
[52:49] expected and espouseed to live in such
[52:51] an atmosphere and conduct itself in such
[52:55] a way that God would be proud of this
[52:58] church to be present to to present it to
[53:01] Christ. Amen. At the coming of the Lord,
[53:04] it should live in that characteristic.
[53:07] in the church. Amen. It should be living
[53:10] that way. Amen. So God intended for his
[53:13] church to be a powerful church. Amen. To
[53:16] be a glorious church and to be a church.
[53:18] Amen. That could not be hidden somewhere
[53:20] in a corner. Amen. But rather could be
[53:23] on display for the whole world to look
[53:25] upon. Amen. As a wellpected espouseed
[53:28] bride unto Jesus Christ. Now when you
[53:31] read here in Luke 24, I want to read a
[53:33] couple translations of that. Luke 24:49
[53:36] from the Amplified Bible. He says, "Now
[53:38] listen carefully. I am sending the
[53:40] promise of my father, the Holy Spirit
[53:43] upon you, but you are to remain in the
[53:46] city of Jerusalem until you are
[53:48] clothed," which means you are fully
[53:50] equipped. Amen. "With power from on
[53:52] high." In the emphatic dialogue, he
[53:54] says, "Behold, I send forth the promise
[53:56] of my father upon you." Amen. But remain
[53:59] you in the city. Amen. until you are
[54:02] invested with power from on high. Amen.
[54:05] So, the Holy Ghost is going to come into
[54:07] the church. Amen. And it's going to
[54:09] equip the church. It's going to clothe
[54:11] the church and it's going to be an
[54:13] investment from God into his church.
[54:16] When you look there at that word power,
[54:18] it actually means dunamis, which is
[54:20] where we get the word dynamite from. And
[54:22] it means strength or power or ability. I
[54:25] love this. It means inherent power. It
[54:28] means power that's residing in a thing.
[54:31] Amen. By virtue of its nature of which a
[54:34] person or thing exerts and puts forth.
[54:37] Amen. So you did not earn this power.
[54:39] Amen. But you inherited this power. It
[54:42] is power for performing miracles. Amen.
[54:45] It is power consisting in Amen. or
[54:48] resting upon armies, forces, and host.
[54:51] Now I'll just say this. Amen. The
[54:53] prophet Joel spoke of this church when
[54:55] he said in Joel chapter 2 that there
[54:57] would be a great army of the Lord that
[54:59] would raise up in the last days. Let me
[55:01] say what I believe. I believe we are
[55:04] Amen. the great army that Joel
[55:06] prophesied. Amen. That would arise in
[55:09] this last day. He said, "God, I hope to
[55:11] live to see the day that I can see the
[55:14] church of the living God." Amen. All
[55:16] lined up as one great army of Christ.
[55:19] Amen. All covered by the blood. Amen.
[55:21] every sister and brother a saint. Now
[55:24] watch this. Marching forward. Amen. In
[55:27] the power of the word of God. You said
[55:29] Lord you would restore all the
[55:31] cankerworm and the locust and
[55:33] caterpillars eat up. He said I believe
[55:35] you will do it Lord and I'm holding
[55:38] forth that you do it. He says and I hope
[55:40] to see it in my age. Amen. But if not I
[55:44] will seow the seed of your word. Amen.
[55:47] So a prophet was sewing amen. the seed
[55:50] of the word. Amen. That would produce a
[55:53] powerful church in the last days.
[55:55] Listen, I'll say this. God has not sent
[55:58] the Holy Ghost. Amen. Just to be a
[56:00] bystander or just to be a figment of our
[56:03] imagination. Amen. But God sent the Holy
[56:06] Ghost. Amen. To fulfill the promise of
[56:08] the father. He said, "You shall receive
[56:11] power." Amen. After that the Holy Ghost,
[56:14] amen, has come upon you. Let me let me
[56:16] make a bold declaration this morning.
[56:18] This is a powerful church, folks. Amen.
[56:21] But it's not because of our bank
[56:22] accounts. It's not because of what job
[56:24] we hold. It's not because of what family
[56:27] we come out of. It's because God, amen,
[56:30] kept his word, amen, by sending the Holy
[56:32] Ghost as the dynamics of God, amen, to
[56:35] put a power in you, amen, to overcome
[56:38] every devil. Amen. I'll say this. If we
[56:41] know what the Holy Ghost is, Amen. then
[56:43] we know what the Holy Ghost is not. And
[56:46] I want to make it very plain this
[56:47] morning. Amen. The Holy Ghost is the
[56:50] spirit of Jesus Christ in you. Amen. By
[56:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. The
[56:56] Holy Ghost is the power of God. Amen.
[56:59] That is sent into your heart as a
[57:02] witness of the spirit. You have been
[57:05] born again. Your life is cleaned up. The
[57:07] world is dead. All the stink of it is
[57:10] like the garlic in Egypt. See, you are
[57:13] far away from it. You are a new creature
[57:16] in Christ Jesus. The old things have
[57:18] passed away. You become new altogether.
[57:21] You are a new creation. Amen. Born of
[57:25] the spirit. Your whole members of your
[57:28] body is submissive to his spirit. And
[57:31] you're moving in the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[57:34] How many is born again this morning?
[57:36] You're a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[57:38] Then you are moving in the Holy Ghost.
[57:42] You are not listening to the sound of
[57:44] the world. Amen. Your eyes are on
[57:47] heavenly things. Let me say this
[57:49] morning, church, I think it's time,
[57:51] amen, to turn our attention, Amen, from
[57:54] the earthly things unto the heavenly
[57:56] things. Listen, if you're going to get
[57:58] out of the situation, if you're going to
[58:00] get out of the problem, Amen, you got to
[58:02] change what you're looking at. You got
[58:04] to look away from the sin and you got to
[58:06] look to the fact there's a savior. If
[58:09] you're sick this morning, you got to
[58:10] look away from the sickness and you got
[58:12] to look at the fact that there's a
[58:14] healer and his name is Jehovah Rafa and
[58:17] he's the God that can heal every
[58:18] disease. He's the God that can rid every
[58:21] sickness. Listen, you got to change what
[58:23] you're looking at. Let me just let me
[58:25] just drop in and say something to you.
[58:27] Amen. You got to keep looking at your
[58:28] sacrifice. Yes, sir. You got to quit
[58:31] looking at yourself and you got to look
[58:33] at your sacrifice. You say, "Brother
[58:35] Andrew, what are you saying?" And
[58:36] brother Ram said, "There's where we lose
[58:38] our position if we watch. If we try to
[58:41] look back to what we was." Amen. Listen.
[58:43] And as long as we look back to what we
[58:46] was, listen, the sacrifice means nothing
[58:49] to us. As long as we're looking back to
[58:52] what we were, Amen. The sacrifice means
[58:55] nothing to us. Oh, can't you see it,
[58:57] church? Amen. I would not try the job. I
[59:00] can't and neither can you. There's no
[59:02] need of trying. Amen. You are lost to
[59:05] begin with. As long as you look to what
[59:07] you've done. Amen. But don't look to
[59:10] what you've done. Amen. Look to what
[59:12] Calvary did for you. Listen, I know I
[59:15] was a sinner. I know I was born in sin.
[59:18] I know I was shaping in iniquity. But I
[59:20] know 2,000 years ago upon Mount Calvary.
[59:24] Amen. Hung the lamb of God who was the
[59:26] propitiation for our sin. Listen, you
[59:29] say, "Why?" Amen. Can you come to church
[59:31] and shout when you know you made
[59:33] mistakes? when you know you failed God
[59:35] because I'm a part of the church of the
[59:38] firstborn. I've got a sacrifice. I've
[59:41] got a God who said, "I'll forgive all
[59:43] your sins and I will remember your
[59:45] iniquities no more." Listen, if anybody
[59:48] ought to be raising the roof in Black
[59:50] Rockck, Arkansas this morning, it ought
[59:52] to be the church of the living God with
[59:54] every sin the devil's going to get it. I
[59:57] know I'm crazy, but I feel like
[59:58] preaching this morning. We are the
[1:00:00] bloodb, Holy Ghost sealed, firebaptized
[1:00:04] church. We ain't going back. We ain't
[1:00:06] going down. We're going up because grace
[1:00:09] has cleared a way between this dimension
[1:00:12] and the other dimension for us to change
[1:00:14] our bodies. Yes, sir. I ain't looking
[1:00:17] back to what I was. And I ain't looking
[1:00:19] back to what you were. I'm looking to
[1:00:21] what you are by the blood.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. Somebody shout the blood.
[1:00:27] The blood. A Holy Ghost and power. Amen.
[1:00:30] It's not power from the bishop. It's not
[1:00:33] power from the church. The Holy Ghost is
[1:00:35] not a handshake. The Holy Ghost is not a
[1:00:37] letter. It's the gift of God with power
[1:00:41] from on high. Amen. To demonstrate the
[1:00:43] literal life of Jesus Christ to the
[1:00:46] people. The Holy Spirit is an experience
[1:00:49] of being filled and endued with power
[1:00:53] for service. I love this. The Holy Ghost
[1:00:55] is an experience. What kind of
[1:00:57] experience is it? It's a true
[1:00:59] experience. Prophet of God said the true
[1:01:02] word comes to the true prophet and he
[1:01:04] tells you the true word and you follow
[1:01:06] that true word and you get a true
[1:01:08] experience of the word. See, because the
[1:01:11] word is made flesh in you and you become
[1:01:15] God's son and the word of God is
[1:01:17] revolving right out of God into you
[1:01:20] because you are his nature. Amen. his
[1:01:24] spirit is in you and you'll do the works
[1:01:28] of God. Hallelujah. He said, "So then we
[1:01:31] find that if a man is born again, Amen.
[1:01:33] that brings God under obligation, amen,
[1:01:37] to give every born again believer the
[1:01:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost." He said,
[1:01:42] "Listen, he's more willing to give it to
[1:01:45] you, Amen, than you are to receive it."
[1:01:47] Amen. For God is under obligation to
[1:01:51] keep his word. Now, somebody say, "Well,
[1:01:53] amen. I don't know if the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:55] for me." Amen. Well, let me just say
[1:01:57] this. Every born again believer is
[1:02:00] entitled to the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:02] Ghost. Listen, it's the only thing that
[1:02:05] can give you the strength, amen, to live
[1:02:07] above sin. It's the only thing that can
[1:02:10] give you the strength, amen, to live
[1:02:12] above mistakes and, amen, to live above
[1:02:14] failures. Listen, I think it's time to
[1:02:16] preach the Holy Ghost so powerful, Amen,
[1:02:19] that every devil backs up into hell he
[1:02:21] came out of. I think it's time to preach
[1:02:23] the Holy Ghost as the absolute to the
[1:02:25] life of every believer. Listen, the Holy
[1:02:27] Ghost is more than a feeling. It's more
[1:02:29] than a goosebump. It's more than a
[1:02:31] sensation. It's more than emotion. It's
[1:02:34] the power of God. Amen. To save a man
[1:02:37] and put him back in his position that
[1:02:39] God gave him from before the foundation
[1:02:41] of the world.
[1:02:43] You say, "What does the Holy Ghost come
[1:02:45] after?" I'll tell you what it comes
[1:02:46] after. It comes after a repentance. In
[1:02:49] Acts chapter 2 and Acts chapter 3, you
[1:02:51] will find, amen, that a repentance,
[1:02:53] amen, precedes the power. Brother said,
[1:02:56] "A man cannot lay in the presence of God
[1:02:58] and a church cannot stay in the presence
[1:03:00] of God under repentance unless the Holy
[1:03:03] Spirit comes down and gives uncction and
[1:03:06] power." Amen. To start a move of God in
[1:03:09] there among those people. You all know
[1:03:11] that Satan hates, Amen, the preaching of
[1:03:14] repentance. He absolutely hates the
[1:03:17] preaching of repentance. The Bible said
[1:03:19] that there were actually two men, amen,
[1:03:22] that that the that the devil, Amen,
[1:03:24] actually sought after, amen, to kill.
[1:03:27] And you know who it was? It was Apostle
[1:03:29] Paul and it was John the Baptist. Do you
[1:03:32] know why the devil was seeking to kill
[1:03:33] them? Because they were preaching the
[1:03:36] power of repentance. They were saying,
[1:03:39] "Listen, folks. I know you made
[1:03:41] mistakes. I know you're Gentiles. I know
[1:03:44] you're sinners. Amen. But there's a
[1:03:46] possibility, amen, after repentance.
[1:03:48] Amen. That God can use you for his
[1:03:50] service. Listen folks, I think it's time
[1:03:52] to remember that God is an unlimited
[1:03:55] God. He's a God of second chances. He's
[1:03:58] a God of third chances. He's a God of
[1:04:00] third chances. And I say it as plain as
[1:04:02] I know how. He's the God of unlimited
[1:04:06] chances. He'll help you. He'll sustain
[1:04:08] you because he wants to see you through
[1:04:11] it. There's a reason Satan wants to stop
[1:04:13] a repentance. Rebraham said, "Because
[1:04:15] when you thoroughly repent and you
[1:04:18] believe on the Lord and are baptized in
[1:04:19] the name of Jesus Christ," he said, "you
[1:04:22] make God a liar if you don't receive the
[1:04:25] Holy Ghost." Now, come on, church.
[1:04:27] That's pretty heavy. You make God a liar
[1:04:31] if you don't receive the Holy Ghost. Let
[1:04:34] me tell you what my Bible says. My Bible
[1:04:36] says God is not a man
[1:04:38] and neither is he the son of man that he
[1:04:41] should repent. Amen. Listen, he has
[1:04:44] said, "How shall he not do it? He has
[1:04:46] spoken, shall he not make it good?"
[1:04:49] Listen, the power of God, Amen, belongs
[1:04:51] to God. And the Bible shows us that in
[1:04:54] Psalm 62:11, David says, "God has spoken
[1:04:57] once and twice have I heard this, that
[1:05:00] power belongth unto God." In 1
[1:05:02] Chronicles 29:12, both riches and honor
[1:05:05] come of thee, and thou reignest over
[1:05:07] all, and in thine hand is power and
[1:05:10] might, and in thy hand is to make great
[1:05:13] and to give strength unto all. 2
[1:05:16] Chronicles 25:8, break it in, for God
[1:05:19] hath power to help and to cast down. I
[1:05:22] love Job 26:12. It says, "He divideth
[1:05:26] the sea with his power, and by his
[1:05:29] understanding he smiteth through the
[1:05:31] proud." In Psalm 65:6, David, speaking
[1:05:34] again, of nature, he says, "Which by his
[1:05:37] strength," Amen. He setth fast the
[1:05:39] mountains. Amen. Now watch this, "Being
[1:05:42] guarded with power." How many's ever
[1:05:44] been out and seen the mountains? Amen.
[1:05:46] Do you realize there's not an 18 penny
[1:05:48] nail holding those mountains? Amen.
[1:05:50] There's not a bunch of rebar holding
[1:05:52] those mountains. Those mountains are
[1:05:54] held. Amen. They are girded by the power
[1:05:56] of God. Look at this word girded. It
[1:05:59] means to equip or to clothe. Oh God,
[1:06:02] didn't Jesus say when the promise of my
[1:06:04] father comes upon you, Amen. I will
[1:06:07] equip you and I will clothe you with the
[1:06:10] power of God. Then that tells me this
[1:06:12] morning that the same power that's
[1:06:15] holding the mountains in place is
[1:06:17] holding every believer in this building
[1:06:19] by the power of the Holy Ghost. Listen,
[1:06:22] God don't divide the sea by education.
[1:06:24] He divideth the sea by his power. I love
[1:06:27] what the prophet says. He says it's the
[1:06:30] father who takes care of it. Who's got
[1:06:32] any more power than God?
[1:06:35] So what kind of power have you got over
[1:06:37] you to take care of you? the whole
[1:06:39] powers that created the universe in
[1:06:42] church age book. Pick up your pen and
[1:06:44] write. He said the members of the virgin
[1:06:46] bride will love him and they will have
[1:06:48] his potentials. Listen, for he is their
[1:06:51] head and all power belongs to him. They
[1:06:56] are subject to him as the members of our
[1:06:58] bodies, amen, are subject to our heads.
[1:07:01] So the power of God, amen, is not coming
[1:07:04] to be made a show. Amen. But the power
[1:07:07] of God is coming to be displayed. And
[1:07:09] God's power is displayed in his
[1:07:12] characteristic. What is the
[1:07:14] characteristic of God? It's Malachi 3:6.
[1:07:16] I am the Lord and I change not. It's
[1:07:19] Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:22] same. Amen. Yesterday, today, and
[1:07:26] forever. In Hebrews chapter 1:3, Paul
[1:07:28] says, "Who being in the brightness of
[1:07:30] his glory, the expressed image of his
[1:07:33] person, and upholding all things,
[1:07:35] somebody say all things by the word of
[1:07:38] his power." Let me say this to you. It
[1:07:41] does not say, "Amen, by the power of his
[1:07:44] word, but it says by the word of his
[1:07:47] power." When he had by himself purged
[1:07:49] our sin, he sat down at the right hand
[1:07:53] of the majesty where on high. Amen.
[1:07:56] Behold, I send the promise of my father.
[1:07:58] You shall receive power from on high.
[1:08:01] Listen folks, the brightness of whose
[1:08:03] glory? God's glory. The expressed image
[1:08:06] of whose presence? God's. He said, see
[1:08:08] the word, oh saints, the word that
[1:08:11] upholds all things. Jesus said, "Heavens
[1:08:14] and earth will pass away, but my word,
[1:08:17] Amen, shall never pass away." Amen.
[1:08:19] Science tries to tear it down and say,
[1:08:21] "This book is an old book. It's been
[1:08:24] translated so many times you cannot
[1:08:26] believe it. He said, "But he upholds all
[1:08:28] things." Amen. By his word. Can I tell
[1:08:32] you what the lifeline of this church is?
[1:08:34] It's the word. Can I tell you what the
[1:08:36] lifeline of your home is? It's the word.
[1:08:39] Can I tell you what the lifeline of your
[1:08:40] marriage is? It's the word. Can I tell
[1:08:43] you what the future of your children is?
[1:08:45] It's the word, church. A prophet didn't
[1:08:47] miss it. He said we have became a word
[1:08:50] bride and the word alone.
[1:08:54] See he upholds all things by his word.
[1:08:57] He said that's when I think about it. I
[1:08:59] believe the Bible. Amen. The word of his
[1:09:02] power. He said so there's power in the
[1:09:05] word. You say why is this a powerful
[1:09:07] church? Because the word is in this
[1:09:10] church.
[1:09:13] Now come on church. A lot of things will
[1:09:14] pass away but this word will never pass
[1:09:17] away. Yes sir. Come on. A lot of ideas
[1:09:20] will pass away, but this word will never
[1:09:22] pass away. You say, "Brother Andrew,
[1:09:24] then how can you identify me as a member
[1:09:27] of this unlimited powerful church?"
[1:09:29] Well, I'll say this. God don't call the
[1:09:31] equipped, but he sure equipped the
[1:09:33] called.
[1:09:34] Come on. We've had a lot of guys started
[1:09:36] out, amen, that was equipped and
[1:09:38] somewhere along the way they messed up.
[1:09:40] Amen. I'll take somebody heard Reverend
[1:09:42] say this morning. He said, "I'd rather
[1:09:44] have somebody preaching to my kids that
[1:09:46] didn't know their ABCs." Amen. And
[1:09:48] didn't know one thing from another.
[1:09:50] Amen. Than somebody with more degrees.
[1:09:51] And Amen. I can't remember how he said
[1:09:53] it, but I'll just say this. Amen. Thank
[1:09:55] God this morning that we're not a bunch
[1:09:57] of equipped people. Amen. Trying to be
[1:10:00] called, but we're some called people and
[1:10:02] the Holy Ghost is here to equip
[1:10:05] us. Come on. I believe it. I believe the
[1:10:08] Holy Ghost is here. Amen. to equip
[1:10:10] fathers to be fathers. I believe the
[1:10:12] Holy Ghost is here to equip mothers to
[1:10:14] be mothers. I believe the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:16] here. Amen. To equip preachers to be
[1:10:18] preachers and to equip singers to be
[1:10:20] singers. Listen, you shall receive your
[1:10:23] equipment from on high. You stay there
[1:10:26] till God equips you. Listen, you say,
[1:10:28] "When I get the Holy Ghost, what do I
[1:10:30] get?" He said, "Everything you have need
[1:10:32] of." Amen. For the earthly journey is in
[1:10:34] you when you receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:38] Listen. Amen. Can I say this? Even the
[1:10:40] rapture,
[1:10:43] the rapture is in you by the baptism of
[1:10:46] the Holy Ghost. The God that wrote the
[1:10:48] word, Amen, sent a prophet in this hour,
[1:10:51] amen, which is a divine revealer of the
[1:10:54] word and he invested him with power from
[1:10:58] on high. I love this in the breach 1963.
[1:11:01] Right before, Amen. this actually
[1:11:03] sermons on tomorrow. Amen. Right before
[1:11:05] brother Ram preaches the first seal, he
[1:11:07] preaches the breach. And he says this.
[1:11:10] He said, "Now, tomorrow night by the
[1:11:11] grace of God, we're going to try to
[1:11:13] break that first seal if God will break
[1:11:15] it for us and let us see what this
[1:11:18] revelation has been." See, it's been hid
[1:11:21] from the foundation of the world. He
[1:11:24] said, "Now before we do that, sinner
[1:11:26] friend or lukewarm church member, do you
[1:11:28] just have a membership in a church or do
[1:11:30] you not have a membership? If you only
[1:11:33] have a membership, you'd be pretty near
[1:11:35] as well off without it. You need a
[1:11:38] birth. You must come to the blood. You
[1:11:41] must come to something that just spots
[1:11:44] the sin away. Amen. Till there's no more
[1:11:46] remembrance of it. If you haven't made
[1:11:49] preparation yet to meet the lamb in the
[1:11:51] air. Now listen what he says. Amen. And
[1:11:54] by the power invested me. Brother
[1:11:57] Travis, that just pulls my heart out. by
[1:12:00] the power invested me. Amen. By my
[1:12:03] commission given by Almighty God,
[1:12:05] ministered to me by an angel, a pillar
[1:12:07] of light. He said, I charge you in the
[1:12:09] name of Jesus Christ. Don't you try to
[1:12:12] meet him with only the membership of a
[1:12:13] lodge or a church of this earth. Come
[1:12:16] while the mediator, as far as I know, is
[1:12:19] still on the throne. Make an
[1:12:20] intercession because there will come a
[1:12:22] day when you'll want to come, but
[1:12:24] there'll be no mediator. For if we see
[1:12:26] the hour we're living in the seven
[1:12:27] church age and the mysteries of God
[1:12:30] become what they have been with the
[1:12:31] vindicated spirit of God showing
[1:12:33] everything that he promised in the last
[1:12:36] days. How much time is left? Amen.
[1:12:39] Sinner friend, come now. Come on,
[1:12:41] church. Amen. Here's a prophet who was
[1:12:44] born into a moonshine maker's home. He
[1:12:47] was born into an unreligious family. He
[1:12:50] was born into a family that didn't go to
[1:12:53] church. Brother Xavier, they didn't know
[1:12:55] anything about God outside of what the
[1:12:57] Catholics had taught. Amen. But the
[1:12:59] pillar of fire come to his birth and the
[1:13:01] pillar of fire met him as a child. And
[1:13:03] the pillar of fire visit him in a cave.
[1:13:05] Listen, he was not equipped, but he was
[1:13:08] called. And because he was called, can I
[1:13:11] say this? God equipped him to marry you
[1:13:14] to Jesus Christ.
[1:13:16] Glory to God. He took somebody that was
[1:13:19] born just like you and me, but he filled
[1:13:22] him with a Holy Ghost and fire and give
[1:13:24] him the legal authority to marry the
[1:13:26] earthly bride to the heavenly
[1:13:28] bridegroom. Well, that ought to make you
[1:13:31] put on your shouting shoes in the house
[1:13:33] of God. How many's ever been to a
[1:13:35] wedding? Yes, sir. How many's ever been
[1:13:38] in a wedding? You're on. You've been in
[1:13:41] a wedding. Amen. Can I say this? How
[1:13:43] many remember standing there? Amen. The
[1:13:45] wife and the husband look at each other
[1:13:46] and you hear the preacher say these
[1:13:48] words, "By the power invested in me." By
[1:13:51] the state of Arkansas, I now pronounce
[1:13:54] you husband and wife. What he's doing is
[1:13:56] he's referring, amen, to the legal
[1:13:59] authority that has come upon his call.
[1:14:02] Amen. By power, Amen. to make two one.
[1:14:06] Oh God, by the power, brother Noah, to
[1:14:09] make Twain one. Don't you see what this
[1:14:12] message is? It's the marriage of the
[1:14:14] lamb. Hallelujah. Every service you sit
[1:14:18] in, listen, some of y'all might have not
[1:14:20] realized it when you started listening
[1:14:21] to them takes. Those were more than just
[1:14:23] sermons. Amen. To get you through the
[1:14:25] week. They were more than just good
[1:14:27] ideas to hear. But a prophet was
[1:14:30] preaching your marriage. He was marrying
[1:14:32] you to Christ the word. Hallelujah. I'll
[1:14:36] say it as plain as I know how. That's
[1:14:38] why hell can't stop us. That's why sin
[1:14:40] can't defeat us. That's why demons can't
[1:14:42] scare us. We're not married to the
[1:14:44] church. We're not married to a preacher,
[1:14:47] but the power of God has married us to
[1:14:49] the word. And we are one with the word.
[1:14:54] We'll never pass away. Come hell or high
[1:14:57] water, we'll still be standing because
[1:14:59] this word is the word of his power. Now,
[1:15:04] bring me to the next point. Then there's
[1:15:06] only two powers. All right? There's only
[1:15:09] two kingdoms in the universe. Re said
[1:15:11] there's God's power and there's Satan's
[1:15:13] power. He said every war, every
[1:15:16] disorder, everything that comes along is
[1:15:19] either controlled by God's power or
[1:15:21] Satan's power. See, the power of God is
[1:15:24] the power of life.
[1:15:27] And the power of Satan is the power of
[1:15:30] death. I love a prophet when he
[1:15:32] humiliates the devil. He says, "And
[1:15:34] Satan, his power he's got is the
[1:15:37] perverted power of God." Brother Joe, it
[1:15:40] isn't no real power. It's a perversion
[1:15:43] of God's power. Everything Satan has is
[1:15:47] only a perversion of the original. He
[1:15:51] said, "So, we are sitting here today and
[1:15:53] one or the other powers, brother Jared,
[1:15:56] is going to control us. We will either
[1:15:59] be controlled by the power of God or by
[1:16:02] the power of the devil. I love this.
[1:16:04] Amen. Because God made a promise. Amen.
[1:16:07] Now, now let me ask you this. What was
[1:16:10] the original power? It was God. It was
[1:16:13] not the devil. The only power the devil
[1:16:15] has is the perverted power that he's
[1:16:18] taken away from God and perverted into
[1:16:20] something that God never intended for it
[1:16:22] to be. But God promised in the evening
[1:16:25] time that he would restore the original
[1:16:28] power. Let me ask you this. How is he
[1:16:31] going to restore the original power? But
[1:16:33] God said, "I will restore, sayaeth the
[1:16:37] Lord, all the years." Now, I love this.
[1:16:40] He says, "I will send back another
[1:16:42] church. I will send back, brother Kyle,
[1:16:45] another church in the last days. I will
[1:16:48] restore that original power again in the
[1:16:52] evening time. It shall be light. So God
[1:16:56] promised to restore the power. Amen. By
[1:16:59] the birth of the word in the church of
[1:17:01] the living God. Listen folks, that's why
[1:17:04] the devil hates this message is because
[1:17:06] it's not something that he can tinker
[1:17:08] with. It's not something that he can
[1:17:10] just pull past. It's the word of God.
[1:17:13] It's the word made power in the hour
[1:17:16] that we're living in. I'll say this.
[1:17:18] We've got a real power.
[1:17:21] Original power is real power. He said
[1:17:24] there's so much mockery in every phase
[1:17:26] of religion. I love this. But there's a
[1:17:29] real power, brother Joel. There's a real
[1:17:31] power of the Holy Spirit that delivers
[1:17:33] the human being from the bondage of sin.
[1:17:36] I feel like stopping there and having a
[1:17:38] two second testimony meeting. Is there
[1:17:40] anybody could wave your hand and say, "I
[1:17:42] have been delivered." Amen. from the
[1:17:44] bondage and the defilement of sin. I
[1:17:47] have been delivered from the habits. I
[1:17:49] have been delivered from the addictions.
[1:17:51] Listen, somebody say, "Well, amen. I'm
[1:17:53] still battling." Well, keep on fighting,
[1:17:55] but keep your eyes on your sacrifice
[1:17:58] because as long as you look at your
[1:18:00] sacrifice, you're not fighting the
[1:18:02] battle. Your sacrifice is fighting the
[1:18:05] battle for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:08] I sat in my office this morning and I
[1:18:10] just looked over a little sign on my
[1:18:12] desk and it struck my heart. This battle
[1:18:14] don't belong to you. This battle belongs
[1:18:16] to God. You say, "I'm tired of fighting
[1:18:19] drugs. I'm tired of fighting alcohol.
[1:18:21] I'm tired of fighting this addiction."
[1:18:22] Can I tell you this? Quit fighting it
[1:18:24] and give it to God and let him fight it
[1:18:27] one time. He won't just fight it. He'll
[1:18:29] whip it. He won't just fight it. He will
[1:18:32] conquer that devil. And he will put you
[1:18:35] in a position over that devil.
[1:18:39] There is a real power of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:42] that delivers the sufferer from
[1:18:43] suffering. I love this. I'm so sick and
[1:18:45] tired of human philosophy. I am too,
[1:18:48] brother Brandon.
[1:18:50] I want to see the real power of God. I
[1:18:53] want to see it demonstrate and move
[1:18:55] among his people where that Jesus Christ
[1:18:57] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:19:00] forever. Proving himself. That's what
[1:19:03] the world is hungering for. So, let me
[1:19:06] say this. The world is not hungering for
[1:19:09] fanaticism.
[1:19:11] They've seen enough, church. They are
[1:19:14] hungering for the real power of God,
[1:19:17] which is, listen, the resurrected Christ
[1:19:21] in the Pentecostal blessing.
[1:19:24] You say, "What? How many's ever heard
[1:19:25] the Pentecostal blessing?" You know what
[1:19:27] it is? It's the real power of God. I
[1:19:30] love this. It's the confirmation of the
[1:19:34] resurrection. In other words, when you
[1:19:37] see the power of God, you are seeing a
[1:19:40] confirmation that God is alive. Now,
[1:19:43] I'll say this. The world we're living
[1:19:44] in, it has the wrong understanding of
[1:19:47] what power is. The prophet God said,
[1:19:49] "How could Satan say that man could be
[1:19:52] God? A man that could take the challenge
[1:19:53] of a priest, let a drunken soldier spit
[1:19:55] in his face." He said, "But today, we
[1:19:58] got the wrong conception of power." He
[1:20:00] said, "Power is overcoming." He said
[1:20:03] power is returning good for evil. That's
[1:20:07] real power. He said that can love your
[1:20:10] enemy and do good to those that do evil
[1:20:13] to you. That's real power. That's God's
[1:20:16] power. Amen. So the real power of God,
[1:20:19] Amen, is manifested in both the
[1:20:21] mechanics, amen, and the dynamics. The
[1:20:25] real power of God is manifested in more
[1:20:28] than just our feet when we dance. It's
[1:20:30] more than just our hands when we clap or
[1:20:32] our voice when we sing or preach or our
[1:20:34] tongues when we speak in tongues or our
[1:20:36] mind when we put things together
[1:20:37] spiritually. No, the power of God is to
[1:20:41] be manifested in our
[1:20:43] character. Yes, sir. Now, what a prophet
[1:20:46] said, he said, "But see power of Satan
[1:20:48] though is limited." Here's what I bring
[1:20:50] it to. But the power of God is
[1:20:53] unlimited.
[1:20:55] So if a believer has a bitterness
[1:20:57] against somebody else and they say, "I
[1:20:59] can't forgive that person, you're
[1:21:01] actually telling me you're under the
[1:21:02] power of Satan." All right. Well, we
[1:21:04] might as well preach we're here. Amen.
[1:21:07] If somebody done you wrong and you can't
[1:21:09] let it go, that tells me you're under
[1:21:11] the power of Satan. You say, "How can
[1:21:13] you say that?" Because you're limited.
[1:21:15] You're limited by that unforgiveness.
[1:21:18] You are limited by that bitterness. You
[1:21:20] are limited by that indifference.
[1:21:21] Listen, folks, there are so many things
[1:21:23] limited. Oh God, can I preach? Amen.
[1:21:26] Somebody come in church and Amen. Let a
[1:21:28] woman come up on the platform, high heel
[1:21:29] shoes, split dress, low cut blouse,
[1:21:31] makeup on her face, and cut hair, we'd
[1:21:33] say, "That woman can't sing in the house
[1:21:35] of God. That outfit's limiting God." And
[1:21:38] it's right. Amen. But what about people
[1:21:40] sitting on pews that when the service
[1:21:42] reaches a certain spot and the power of
[1:21:44] God wants to take it higher, but that
[1:21:46] little ill feeling or that little
[1:21:48] indifference or that little bitterness,
[1:21:49] amen, is dampering the power of God. I
[1:21:52] say let the Holy Ghost blow the channels
[1:21:54] out this morning. I say folks, it's
[1:21:56] time, Grace Tabernacle, to just stop
[1:21:58] climbing up the ladder so far and say
[1:22:00] this is as high as we can go. This is as
[1:22:02] far as we can go. That devil is a liar.
[1:22:05] The sky is our limit. The uncarchable
[1:22:08] riches of Jesus Christ belongs to those
[1:22:11] who are the heirs of salvation. There is
[1:22:14] no limit to this church.
[1:22:18] You say, do you believe that with all my
[1:22:19] heart? There is no limit to this church.
[1:22:23] That devil didn't like that. There is no
[1:22:25] limit to this church. Brother Andrew,
[1:22:27] you're on the internet. I don't care.
[1:22:28] There's no limit to this church. There's
[1:22:31] no limit to this people. There's no
[1:22:33] limit to these young people.
[1:22:36] Amen. The power of God is unlimited. God
[1:22:39] is unlimited. God's knowledge, God's
[1:22:42] power, everything. He is the omnipotent.
[1:22:45] Look at this word limited. It means
[1:22:47] restricted in size. It means the amount
[1:22:50] or extent. It is few. It is small. It is
[1:22:54] short. It is of a person not great in
[1:22:57] ability or talents. Now, we all been
[1:23:00] there where we look at oursel and say,
[1:23:03] "If I could only do that like so and so,
[1:23:05] and if I could only do that like this
[1:23:07] one, and if I could only sing like her,
[1:23:08] and if I could only
[1:23:11] come on, y'all know what I'm talking
[1:23:12] about. Any any humans here?
[1:23:14] if I could only be like him and if I
[1:23:17] could I I've had people tell me and then
[1:23:19] brother told me one time he said I wish
[1:23:20] I could just be like you and just let
[1:23:22] everything roll off my back and just
[1:23:24] preach. I said, ' Buddy, you don't have
[1:23:25] a clue how many times I've carried
[1:23:27] burdens to my on my back to the pull pit
[1:23:29] preached. Anyhow, listen, what I'm
[1:23:31] saying is, Amen. The devil wants to
[1:23:33] limit our thinking. He wants to limit us
[1:23:36] by telling us we don't have the ability
[1:23:38] and we don't have the talent and and we
[1:23:40] Amen. But, but I'll just say this. Have
[1:23:42] you forgot where this church come from?
[1:23:44] Have you forgot the corner that this
[1:23:46] church started in? Have Listen, just the
[1:23:48] other day had a powerful meeting in this
[1:23:50] meeting in this church. You say,
[1:23:52] "Brother Andrew, that's just a bunch of
[1:23:53] preachers." And no, it's not. Amen. That
[1:23:56] six years of people working together and
[1:23:58] ministers preaching and a pastor
[1:24:00] pastoring and people forgiving and
[1:24:02] letting things go. Listen, that don't
[1:24:05] just happen overnight, folks. A meeting
[1:24:07] like we just had don't happen because a
[1:24:09] couple preachers come to town. It
[1:24:11] happens because somebody has really
[1:24:14] realized that God is unlimited and
[1:24:16] they're unlimited.
[1:24:19] Hallelujah. This is an unlimited church.
[1:24:23] Hey, put your preaching voice on right
[1:24:24] now and shout it unlimited. We're an
[1:24:27] unlimited church. It's an unlimited
[1:24:30] people. It's an unlimited revival. It's
[1:24:32] an unlimited message.
[1:24:36] You say unlimited. You know what
[1:24:38] unlimited means? It means not limited or
[1:24:40] restricted
[1:24:42] in terms of number, quantity or extent.
[1:24:46] Brother Matt, this is you. Have I ever
[1:24:48] read you having an infinite number of
[1:24:54] solutions? Praise God for our
[1:24:57] pastor. Having an infinite number of
[1:25:00] solutions. Well, we might as well free
[1:25:02] preach, folks. There's people sitting
[1:25:04] right here. People done give up on you a
[1:25:06] long time ago. People done give up on
[1:25:08] your families and give up on your
[1:25:10] future. But God who is rich in mercy
[1:25:13] raised up a faithful shepherd that said,
[1:25:15] "I believe there's a God who's able to
[1:25:17] save a drunk. He's able to save a drug
[1:25:19] addict. He's able to save a prostit."
[1:25:23] You say, "That's Matt Morris." That's
[1:25:25] not Matt Morris. That's the unlimited
[1:25:26] God in Matt Morris.
[1:25:30] An infinite number of
[1:25:34] solutions. Got a lot of people coming
[1:25:36] for a meet. What in the world we going
[1:25:37] to do? We'll just knock a hole in the
[1:25:38] wall.
[1:25:42] It's an infinite number of solutions.
[1:25:46] See, that's why I don't fit in with a
[1:25:47] lot of people. I don't think small.
[1:25:52] Sister Cindy, I don't sit around and
[1:25:53] think about who done who wrong and what
[1:25:55] preacher preached this
[1:25:59] and 20 years ago so and so taugh. I
[1:26:01] don't think like that because I refuse
[1:26:04] to allow God, amen, to be limited in my
[1:26:07] life. I refuse to let the Holy Ghost
[1:26:09] have restrictions in a meeting. Listen,
[1:26:11] there's been times I've set meetings,
[1:26:13] brother Juan, and I felt lower than a
[1:26:15] snake's belly, but God, who is rich in
[1:26:17] mercy, Brother Jared, come by my way and
[1:26:20] pick me up off the ground because I
[1:26:22] refuse to allow my circumstances to
[1:26:25] unlimit limited. Unlimited God in the
[1:26:28] atmosphere of change.
[1:26:31] Everybody shout unlimited. Unlimited.
[1:26:34] Now, do you realize your doctor's
[1:26:35] limited?
[1:26:38] He only has a finite number of
[1:26:40] solutions.
[1:26:42] But do you realize that God is
[1:26:44] unlimited?
[1:26:46] Because when this treatment's failed and
[1:26:48] this scan is failed and this is failed
[1:26:49] and that's failed, he comes on the scene
[1:26:51] and performs a miracle.
[1:26:55] Now, either we believe the message or we
[1:26:57] don't. And I'm just going to say what
[1:27:00] brother Ram said. He said, "If you can
[1:27:02] limit God, then you can limit Christ."
[1:27:05] Can I read the rest of it? And if you
[1:27:07] limit the church today in its
[1:27:10] possibilities, you're limiting God.
[1:27:15] Oh, mercy, brother Bobby. When you limit
[1:27:18] the church, you're limiting God. But all
[1:27:22] things, whatsoever you desire when you
[1:27:23] pray, believe you receive it and you
[1:27:26] shall have it. He said that I believe it
[1:27:29] and I know it's the truth. So here a
[1:27:32] prophet is saying this is the same
[1:27:34] prophet brother Don that said all that
[1:27:36] was in God he poured into Christ and all
[1:27:39] that was in Christ he poured into the
[1:27:42] church. So if you can't limit God you
[1:27:45] can't limit Christ. Come on brother. If
[1:27:48] God is in Christ you can't limit him.
[1:27:50] Then if Christ is in this church you
[1:27:52] can't limit this church.
[1:27:56] You think of the wildest thing that
[1:27:58] could happen and God will surpass it a
[1:28:00] million miles. You think of the most
[1:28:01] bizarre thing that could take place and
[1:28:04] God will go a million miles beyond our
[1:28:06] imagination because he's the unlimited
[1:28:08] God. Brother said like this he said
[1:28:11] we're Gentiles, right? How many knows we
[1:28:13] are living in the time of the Gentiles?
[1:28:16] According to Luke 21:24, they shall fall
[1:28:19] by the edge of the sword. They shall be
[1:28:20] led away captive into all nations, and
[1:28:22] Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the
[1:28:25] Gentiles until
[1:28:28] until the time of the Gentiles be
[1:28:31] fulfilled. Brother, it's shocking, isn't
[1:28:34] it, to know that we have a limited time.
[1:28:38] God said so. Oh, brother Wesley. The
[1:28:41] Gentiles have a limited time. But can I
[1:28:44] say this very plainly? The Gentiles
[1:28:46] limited time does not restrict an
[1:28:49] unlimited God.
[1:28:53] There is an allotted time for the
[1:28:54] Gentiles. And there will be a day this
[1:28:57] gospel will be turned back to the Jews.
[1:28:59] Right? But listen, sometimes we limit
[1:29:02] God. Come on. And we put God on a time
[1:29:06] limit. We say, "Well, God, you got this
[1:29:08] amount of time to do this certain thing,
[1:29:10] and if it ain't done by this, everything
[1:29:11] gonna fall apart."
[1:29:13] Am I just preaching to myself this
[1:29:15] morning? Amen. We limit God. Rebraham
[1:29:17] said like this. He said, "You try to
[1:29:19] limit God to your theology."
[1:29:22] Well, glory to God. Amen. That's why
[1:29:24] there's no room in the message churches
[1:29:26] for Pentecostal theology.
[1:29:30] Can I preach, pastor? Amen. There's a
[1:29:32] lot of folks what they do is they say a
[1:29:34] person can't have a deathbed repentance.
[1:29:36] Well, go tell the thief on the cross
[1:29:37] that.
[1:29:40] Come on, church. A lot of people put
[1:29:42] people out because of suicide. But you
[1:29:44] got to take what a prophet said. He
[1:29:46] said, "That's why I believe in eternal
[1:29:48] security." That when a man is in his
[1:29:50] right mind, he give his heart to God.
[1:29:51] Cuz you don't know what kind of
[1:29:53] condition you're going to be in when
[1:29:54] your life is taken.
[1:29:58] Can I just preach? Somebody say, "Well,
[1:30:00] amen. Somebody took their life. They're
[1:30:02] bound for hell." Listen, God is the
[1:30:04] judge.
[1:30:06] Come on. You take an 85year-old woman
[1:30:08] served God her whole life and she's
[1:30:10] laying on her deathbed dying of
[1:30:11] Alzheimer's and dementia and she starts
[1:30:13] taking God's name in vain and her final
[1:30:15] breast is cursing God. Are you going to
[1:30:17] put her in hell? No, sir. No. Then let
[1:30:20] your theology away and believe the word
[1:30:23] of God that he is a savior and he is a
[1:30:25] just God and he is a sovereign God.
[1:30:31] I don't care what condition they're in
[1:30:33] when they die. Our God still has the
[1:30:35] final say, somebody. Amen. One of the
[1:30:38] first funerals I ever preached, Amen. as
[1:30:40] a 15year-old boy, 14, 15 year old boy.
[1:30:42] Amen. Was my cousin Holly's funeral.
[1:30:44] Amen. God rest her soul. Amen. Rough
[1:30:46] life. All kinds of things. Amen. Died of
[1:30:49] a horrible death. Somebody told me, they
[1:30:51] said, "Well, I guess you're just going
[1:30:52] to have to put her in hell, aren't you?"
[1:30:53] I said, "No, I'm going to preach a God
[1:30:55] who is a just God and all things." Now,
[1:30:59] I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
[1:31:00] go ahead and punch that devil's square
[1:31:01] in the face since I'm this close to it.
[1:31:03] That's why the world is tired of
[1:31:05] religion. They're tired of philosophy.
[1:31:07] They're tired of a bunch of bitter
[1:31:08] preachers that ain't found no
[1:31:10] forgiveness in 30 years. And because
[1:31:12] they're bitter, they want everybody
[1:31:13] around them to be bitter. Well, let me
[1:31:15] say this. I refuse to become a bittered,
[1:31:18] crabbing old person. I want to be a Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost filled,
[1:31:23] firebaptized, unlimited believer in the
[1:31:26] powerful church of God. Brother man, if
[1:31:28] I'm wrong, let me be wrong for believing
[1:31:30] God is able to save anybody. If I'm
[1:31:33] wrong, brother Mark, let me be wrong for
[1:31:35] believing God is able to deliver
[1:31:37] anybody.
[1:31:41] You try to limit God to your way of
[1:31:43] thinking. That's right. Well, this is
[1:31:46] the way I
[1:31:47] think. Well, I don't care how you think.
[1:31:51] You say, "That's awful rude." No, it's
[1:31:52] not. Cuz I don't care how I think.
[1:31:55] So, if I don't care how I think, I sure
[1:31:57] don't care how you think.
[1:32:00] Well, glory to God. It's Sunday morning
[1:32:02] and I feel good. Are you hearing me?
[1:32:04] Take the limits off of the way we think.
[1:32:07] Rebraham said this. They always look
[1:32:09] back, but it's time to look forward. He
[1:32:11] said the church is always looking back.
[1:32:13] Let's look up for their powers are
[1:32:15] unlimited. We have unlimited power.
[1:32:19] Somebody say unlimited God. God with
[1:32:22] unlimited power. Unlimited power
[1:32:25] revealed by an unlimited message.
[1:32:29] Are you ready for this?
[1:32:31] produces unlimited revival.
[1:32:38] An unlimited God revealed an unlimited
[1:32:41] power by an unlimited message and has
[1:32:44] produced an unlimited revival.
[1:32:49] You say, "Brother Andrew, why is there
[1:32:51] such an atmosphere here this morning and
[1:32:52] it's not a meeting?" Because it is a
[1:32:54] meeting.
[1:32:58] Glory. Somebody say, "Well, Amen. I
[1:33:00] don't think we ought to have so much
[1:33:01] preaching on Wednesday. Well, I'm sorry.
[1:33:03] I'm not a preacher that that categorizes
[1:33:05] my services. Well, this is just for a
[1:33:07] Wednesday night and I'm just going to go
[1:33:09] in there and see if we can get by. I'm
[1:33:10] sorry. I'm an unlimited preacher. I'm an
[1:33:13] unlimited believer. I don't limit God to
[1:33:15] a Wednesday. I don't limit him to a
[1:33:17] Sunday. I don't limit him to a meeting.
[1:33:19] I take the limits off of him. I take the
[1:33:22] restrictions off of him. I just want to
[1:33:24] see him move.
[1:33:26] Yes, sir. Unlimited revival. How many
[1:33:29] knows, brother? A plane when it travels,
[1:33:31] it goes to a certain speed, right,
[1:33:34] brother Ed? He said, "But then it hits
[1:33:36] that sound barrier." He said, "Now
[1:33:38] watch." He said, "When it gets against
[1:33:40] that sound barrier, it goes to shaking."
[1:33:44] And he said, "You're literally sitting
[1:33:46] there and you're thinking." I love a
[1:33:49] prophet's message. You're thinking,
[1:33:51] Brother Tom, it's all getting ready to
[1:33:54] fall apart.
[1:33:57] Anybody ever been there? Two of you,
[1:34:00] three of you, five of you, four of you,
[1:34:03] eight nothing. You ever been there?
[1:34:06] Brother Wesley, it's all getting ready
[1:34:08] to fall apart. Come on. Now you're not
[1:34:10] in a jet airplane and you're not soaring
[1:34:13] this up against the sound bear, but
[1:34:14] you're going through Leosa and you're
[1:34:17] fighting this battle and this mine
[1:34:18] battle and this oppression and this
[1:34:20] issue and these bills are piloting and
[1:34:21] all these things are happening and
[1:34:23] you're just riding along and
[1:34:24] everything's shaking which means it's
[1:34:26] fixing to fall apart. Rebraham said no.
[1:34:29] He said you're getting ready to have a
[1:34:30] breakthrough.
[1:34:33] He said what's happening is you're
[1:34:35] bumping against the sound barrier.
[1:34:38] Glory to God. You're bumping against the
[1:34:41] sound barrier. He said, "And the devil
[1:34:43] knows if he can get you afraid on this
[1:34:46] side of the sound barrier, your speed
[1:34:48] will be limited."
[1:34:51] Now, brother man, you ever get in an
[1:34:53] airplane and you take off, they get on
[1:34:55] that runway, they just kind of coast out
[1:34:58] there. They just kind of coast along
[1:35:00] about the speed you'd roll to the
[1:35:02] airport in. just kind of ride along, you
[1:35:05] know, and then they get out there and
[1:35:08] they get on that that tarmac and they
[1:35:10] start pulling that propeller and buddy
[1:35:12] hold on
[1:35:16] cuz 50 turns into 100 and 100 turns into
[1:35:20] 130 and 130 turns in 140 and then all of
[1:35:22] a sudden, amen, they lift up off the
[1:35:24] ground and you start climbing and y'all
[1:35:27] know what I'm talking about. Amen.
[1:35:28] Things start changing. Pressure start
[1:35:31] changing. Ears start popping. Seats
[1:35:33] start shaking. You know why? Because
[1:35:36] they're breaking gravity.
[1:35:39] They're breaking gravity and they're in
[1:35:41] that plane and they're just and all of a
[1:35:44] sudden they start dinging the lights and
[1:35:46] put your seat belt on. Here's some
[1:35:47] turbulence. Amen. Now you climb to 200.
[1:35:50] Now you climb to 300. Amen. Now listen
[1:35:53] folks. I have never in my life got up
[1:35:55] and went out to the cockpit and said,
[1:35:57] "Mr. Pilot, slow this thing down. Bring
[1:36:00] it back down to about 55 or 60. If I
[1:36:03] wanted to go 55 or 60, I should have
[1:36:05] never left the Baptist church.
[1:36:09] I'm feeling good. If I wanted to go 100
[1:36:11] miles an hour, I should have never left
[1:36:13] the Pentecostal church. But I knew there
[1:36:15] was an unlimited speed. I knew there was
[1:36:17] a place I could go where I could break
[1:36:20] the cell barrier. Oh, church, if you
[1:36:22] want to live in the dumps, you should
[1:36:24] have never left the bar. If you want to
[1:36:26] live depressed, you should have never
[1:36:27] thrown the joint away. But you were not
[1:36:29] born to smoke dope. You were not born to
[1:36:31] smoke drugs. You were born to soar into
[1:36:34] the heavenlies. I say it's time, amen,
[1:36:37] to break out of this sound barrier, out
[1:36:39] of this chatter chatter, and go into an
[1:36:42] unlimited speed with an unlimited
[1:36:44] revival.
[1:36:47] Yes, sir. There's a place we can go
[1:36:50] where there's no restrictions.
[1:36:54] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:36:56] Hallelujah. Slow down. Slow
[1:37:01] down. These services are getting too
[1:37:03] high.
[1:37:07] I say let's just go higher.
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:12] Brother Andrew, there's too many new
[1:37:14] people coming in the message. I say
[1:37:16] bring 10 more. I say bring 30 more. I
[1:37:19] say bring a hundred more.
[1:37:21] Brother Andrew, the church is almost
[1:37:23] full. I say bring another 50. We'll
[1:37:26] knock another wall out. This is bride
[1:37:28] revival time. This is unlimited church
[1:37:31] time.
[1:37:34] It's time to take the limits off of God
[1:37:36] and quit settling down.
[1:37:41] Until you break through and the Holy
[1:37:43] Ghost comes upon you.
[1:37:45] You say, "Brother Andrew, why do I need
[1:37:47] the Holy Ghost to come upon me and break
[1:37:48] through?" Because the prophet of God
[1:37:50] said when the Holy Ghost gets upon you
[1:37:52] and you break through, he said you need
[1:37:54] about 50 miles of elbow room.
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:01] I'm the guy, Xavier. I've got to know
[1:38:04] what elbow room means. So I went and
[1:38:06] looked it up. It means adequate space to
[1:38:10] operate, move, and work in.
[1:38:15] I said, "Well, glory to God. That's why
[1:38:17] we need some elbow room is because if
[1:38:19] anybody needs to move, it's the bride.
[1:38:22] Because he said, "Thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:38:24] the move is on for the bride." That's
[1:38:26] why I said we need some elbow room. If
[1:38:29] anybody needs some room to work in is
[1:38:31] the bride of Jesus Christ because she is
[1:38:34] the fulfillment of John 14:12. Greater
[1:38:37] works than this shall ye do.
[1:38:41] Somebody say, "Give me some room." Give
[1:38:43] me some room. No, I'm really really
[1:38:47] meaning it. Give me some room.
[1:38:49] Sometimes I feel Glory to God. I need
[1:38:53] some room. He said if there's no limit
[1:38:55] to the speed the plane will go. Are you
[1:38:57] ready for this? There's no limit.
[1:39:02] Am I reading this right? To the
[1:39:04] blessings that God will pour down upon a
[1:39:09] believer that will believe.
[1:39:14] Glory. If there's no limit to the plane,
[1:39:17] there's no limit to a believer.
[1:39:20] Are you ready for this direct quote? How
[1:39:24] many knows the plane has a sound
[1:39:25] barrier? Yes, sir.
[1:39:28] Can I tell you something? You have your
[1:39:30] own sound barrier.
[1:39:33] The other day I was flying home from
[1:39:36] Arizona and I got into Atlanta. We got
[1:39:39] on the plane or actually from Tucson
[1:39:43] somewhere. I've been on so many in the
[1:39:45] past few weeks. Somewhere we were going
[1:39:46] somewhere. And we get on the plane.
[1:39:48] We're all sitting there and Kyle, the
[1:39:50] door's still open. I'm looking at the
[1:39:51] watch. It's taking forever. And all of a
[1:39:53] sudden, they get this woman and they got
[1:39:55] her by the hands. And I'm not lying,
[1:39:58] folks. She got a blindfold on. And she's
[1:40:00] walking down the plane and she's shaking
[1:40:03] and she's crying, screaming. I felt so
[1:40:06] sorry for her. They said and honestly
[1:40:09] they brought over brother Joel and they
[1:40:10] sit her down in the chair and they
[1:40:12] helped her buckle her seat belt and they
[1:40:16] said and they stepped back and she goes,
[1:40:20] "Don't leave me." And they said, "It's
[1:40:22] okay. We got to get off." She said, "I
[1:40:24] can't take no more reports. I can't take
[1:40:27] no more issues." Come to find out, the
[1:40:30] night before she got on the plane, she
[1:40:32] had been reading all these websites
[1:40:33] about people who left the message. I
[1:40:35] mean, she'd been reading all these
[1:40:36] websites
[1:40:38] about all these plane crashes and all
[1:40:40] these planes catching on fire. Come on,
[1:40:42] folks. When you're over in Poland and
[1:40:44] you got a 7-hour flight to come home and
[1:40:47] before you get on the plane, they flip a
[1:40:48] plane in Toronto, you better be praying.
[1:40:52] Amen.
[1:40:53] It was her own sound barrier. So, not
[1:40:57] only now did the plane have to break a
[1:40:59] sound barrier, but she had to break a
[1:41:01] sound barrier. She sat down on that
[1:41:04] plane and she shook. Somebody got up and
[1:41:06] come back here said, "Ma'am, do you want
[1:41:07] some water?" No. No. Amen. And I felt so
[1:41:10] sorry for her because she was under a
[1:41:13] barrier. Are y'all hearing me? But the
[1:41:16] problem was not everybody else in the
[1:41:18] plane was.
[1:41:20] Now, come on, church. You know where I'm
[1:41:22] going. Do you realize there can be
[1:41:24] individual barriers in an entire church?
[1:41:26] There can be people sitting there when
[1:41:28] the whole church has got unlimited
[1:41:30] revival. They got unlimited speed. They
[1:41:33] got unlimited blessings. and you're
[1:41:35] sitting there scared to death and you're
[1:41:36] shaken. It's not because you watched a
[1:41:39] plane flip. It's not because you read
[1:41:41] about a crash. It's because somebody
[1:41:43] told a lie on you or somebody done
[1:41:45] something to you or somebody offended
[1:41:47] your babies or somebody didn't show up
[1:41:48] at an event or somebody didn't call you
[1:41:51] or glory to God or somebody sold
[1:41:54] something wrong. But can I say this to
[1:41:56] you? It's time to let it go.
[1:42:00] It's time to let it go. It's time to
[1:42:02] unblock. It's time to take the
[1:42:04] restrictions off. It's time to remember
[1:42:07] who we are. It's time to remember where
[1:42:09] we come from. And it's definitely time
[1:42:11] to remember where we're going.
[1:42:16] I can't I can't I can't I can't I tell
[1:42:21] you you can,
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:25] brother. Andrew, I can't I can't
[1:42:27] overcome. I tell you you can.
[1:42:30] Yes, I'm going to punch that devil
[1:42:33] square in the face and you can sit there
[1:42:34] and watch me. Brother Andrew, I just
[1:42:36] can't overcome this. It's had me so
[1:42:38] long. I'm here to tell you you can.
[1:42:42] I'm here to tell you there is a place
[1:42:44] you can go in God where fear can't
[1:42:47] torment you no more.
[1:42:51] I'm here to tell you there's a place you
[1:42:53] can go in God where mind battles and
[1:42:55] issues of the past can't control you no
[1:42:57] longer.
[1:43:01] I'm here to tell you you can. You can,
[1:43:06] [Applause]
[1:43:07] brother Andrew. I can't. I can't go on
[1:43:10] the rapture. I'm here to tell you you
[1:43:12] can.
[1:43:14] Brother Andrew, I can't. I can't. I
[1:43:17] can't. You can.
[1:43:21] Oh, I feel that devil pushing at me.
[1:43:23] Well, push back, devil. You can.
[1:43:27] Can I go ahead and say it, brother John?
[1:43:29] You already are.
[1:43:32] You're not going to be You're already
[1:43:35] the sons of God. You're not going to be
[1:43:37] overcomers. You're already overcomers.
[1:43:40] You're not going to be the bride of
[1:43:41] Jesus Christ. You are already the bride
[1:43:45] of Jesus Christ. Greater is he that is
[1:43:48] in you
[1:43:50] than he that is in the world. What are
[1:43:53] you saying, preacher? I'm saying what a
[1:43:55] prophet said. He said that Jesus in his
[1:43:57] church today would be just as powerless
[1:44:00] as your faith is.
[1:44:02] Are you ready for this? But he'll be
[1:44:05] just as powerful as your faith is. Can I
[1:44:09] can I just can I just make a
[1:44:10] declaration?
[1:44:12] I say this upon the authority of God's
[1:44:14] word. There is no limit to the faith of
[1:44:17] God
[1:44:19] that he left for his
[1:44:21] church because he said all things are
[1:44:25] possible
[1:44:28] to them that believe.
[1:44:32] Can I say it to you this morning? It's
[1:44:35] time to change what you're looking at.
[1:44:40] It's time to change what you're feeding
[1:44:42] on. Come on. It's time to change what
[1:44:45] you're eating.
[1:44:47] Come on, folks. It's time to change.
[1:44:50] Brother said this. He said, "We're
[1:44:52] always complaining about what the world
[1:44:54] and how wicked the world is, but do you
[1:44:57] forget to realize how much more powerful
[1:45:00] the church is than it used to be?"
[1:45:03] Oh, God. Have you forgotten how more
[1:45:06] powerful the church is than it used to
[1:45:09] be? Can I give you another one? He said,
[1:45:10] "You always talk about how bad the world
[1:45:12] is, how wicked the world is." And that's
[1:45:14] true. But look how great the church is
[1:45:17] getting all the time. We fail to look at
[1:45:20] that side. See, when the world's getting
[1:45:22] wicer and wicider and wicider, the
[1:45:25] church is getting more powerful and
[1:45:28] powerful all the time. When the enemy
[1:45:30] comes in like a flood, the spirit of God
[1:45:34] will raise up a standard against
[1:45:37] it. Hallelujah. Can I read another one?
[1:45:42] Let them grow together. You're always
[1:45:44] pointing how wicked the world's getting,
[1:45:46] but you fail to see how powerful the
[1:45:50] churches are getting at the same time.
[1:45:53] Oh, here it is. She is rising up. She is
[1:45:57] standing on the field. Oh, she's a
[1:46:00] little flock, but brother God is with
[1:46:02] her and she's going to triumph just as
[1:46:05] certain as Christ rose from the dead.
[1:46:09] Hallelujah. I know this is simple, but I
[1:46:12] want to say it with everything within
[1:46:13] me. God's church shall never fail.
[1:46:19] God's church shall never fail.
[1:46:24] Amen, brother Andrew. God's church shall
[1:46:28] never fail. Now, put your name there.
[1:46:31] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Put your name there.
[1:46:35] I will never fail. You say, "How can you
[1:46:39] say that? The gates of hell shall not
[1:46:41] prevail against it." It's so they would
[1:46:43] be against it, but they cannot prevail.
[1:46:45] The church is going to triumph through
[1:46:48] the blood of Jesus Christ right into the
[1:46:52] victory march.
[1:46:57] What are you saying? I'm saying God
[1:46:59] promised this would be a powerless
[1:47:01] church age, but it would not be a
[1:47:05] powerless church. It would not be a
[1:47:08] powerless bride age. Can I close with
[1:47:10] this?
[1:47:12] We are speaking of the true church. Can
[1:47:16] you give me Matthew
[1:47:17] 16:18? It's a very familiar scripture,
[1:47:20] but I want I want to I want to lay this
[1:47:21] in your heart as we're closing. I say
[1:47:24] also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and
[1:47:29] you're perfect, and you've never made a
[1:47:32] mistake, and you've always got it right.
[1:47:34] And you've never had any bad days, and
[1:47:39] Peter, you've never had any mind
[1:47:40] battles. And Peter, you've never even
[1:47:42] thought about cursing God. You've never
[1:47:44] thought about even cutting a soldier's
[1:47:45] ear off, Peter. I mean, you are a
[1:47:48] perfectly
[1:47:49] unblenmished
[1:47:53] What book are you reading?
[1:47:57] Thou art Peter
[1:48:00] and
[1:48:01] conjunction upon this rock I will build.
[1:48:07] What's that say?
[1:48:09] I will build my church. So Jesus is
[1:48:13] making a declaration. I will build my
[1:48:17] church. You know what he says? Amen. and
[1:48:20] the gates of hell
[1:48:23] sir shall not prevail against it.
[1:48:29] He never said the gates of hell wouldn't
[1:48:32] be against it. But brother Kyle, he said
[1:48:34] they would never prevail.
[1:48:38] Oh, if anybody ought to be shouting this
[1:48:40] morning is the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:43] Every gun in hell is turned against you.
[1:48:46] Every devil in hell is against you,
[1:48:48] brother Jared. But they cannot prevail
[1:48:50] because greater is the spiritual
[1:48:53] revelation.
[1:48:59] Can I say this to you? I will build.
[1:49:02] Look at this word build. It means to
[1:49:04] build up from the foundation to restore
[1:49:06] by building. Look what Paul says. I are
[1:49:09] built upon the foundation of the
[1:49:11] apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ
[1:49:13] himself being the chief cornerstone
[1:49:15] built. Look at this word. Built to
[1:49:17] finish the structure of which the
[1:49:19] foundation has already been laid. The
[1:49:22] seventh church age messenger direct
[1:49:24] quote was to restore the faith of the
[1:49:26] children back to the fathers. In other
[1:49:28] words, he'll rebuild the church again.
[1:49:34] Oh God, he will rebuild the church again
[1:49:39] under the power of the spirit.
[1:49:43] Church is not a building. Are you
[1:49:45] hearing me? It's persons who have come
[1:49:48] in direct contact by the Holy Ghost with
[1:49:52] this person Jesus Christ. God revealed
[1:49:56] and you identify that is the one of
[1:50:00] Matthew 16. A spiritual revelation that
[1:50:03] the message sent to you is the person of
[1:50:07] Jesus Christ.
[1:50:10] Let me let me just let me just say this.
[1:50:13] The devil has introduced the idea you
[1:50:15] don't have to go to church to be a
[1:50:17] Christian.
[1:50:20] I told you where that come from. It come
[1:50:22] from the devil and it come from the pits
[1:50:24] of hell. And it don't belong in a
[1:50:26] message pull pit and it don't belong in
[1:50:28] a message pew.
[1:50:33] It don't belong in the church. Somebody
[1:50:35] say, "Well, amen. I think I can just be
[1:50:37] good as Christian at home and play
[1:50:38] tapes." The Bible said, "I was glad when
[1:50:41] they said unto me, let us go into the
[1:50:44] house of the Lord." In Hebrews 10:25, it
[1:50:47] says, "Not forsaken the assembling of
[1:50:49] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:50:52] is, but exhorting one another." And I've
[1:50:55] got to get this. And so much more as you
[1:50:58] see the day approaching. Amen. Can I say
[1:51:01] this? What a prophet said, he says, "The
[1:51:03] church doesn't make you a Christian." He
[1:51:06] said, "But the church only helps you to
[1:51:08] be a Christian.
[1:51:12] It helps you to remain what you've been
[1:51:14] born into. It helps you contain your
[1:51:17] experience while you're fellowshipping
[1:51:20] together with brethren of like precious
[1:51:23] faith."
[1:51:25] You say, "Brother Andrew, why did
[1:51:27] brother Matt take time this morning,
[1:51:28] Amen, to welcome the new families?"
[1:51:30] Because this is not a bunch of
[1:51:32] individuals. We're one family.
[1:51:37] We're one family. That's why yesterday
[1:51:39] people were calling and checking and are
[1:51:41] you okay? We're a family of believers.
[1:51:44] Let me say this and I I I know I'm
[1:51:45] running out of time, but y'all forgive
[1:51:46] me. I got to get off my heart. He said,
[1:51:48] "When a man and woman gets to a place
[1:51:50] when I really ought to stay home and see
[1:51:52] this good play tonight, but I'll tell
[1:51:53] you, they'll think I'm back so if I
[1:51:55] don't go on down to church," he said,
[1:51:56] "and you sit there and you sleep anyhow,
[1:51:59] you might as well stayed home and looked
[1:52:01] at something you'd enjoyed more." But
[1:52:03] when your joy becomes the Lord, when
[1:52:06] your joy becomes the Lord. Amen. Amen. I
[1:52:09] say God bless you with the Ed and your
[1:52:11] family. Amen. Drove I think over an
[1:52:13] hour. Amen. Every night to those
[1:52:14] meetings, brother Juan just Amen.
[1:52:16] There's people here that drive 30 and 40
[1:52:19] and 50 minutes. Somebody that day Matt
[1:52:20] was telling me got up at 5:00. I think
[1:52:22] it was 3 4:00. Amen. To start driving to
[1:52:26] church. You say, "Brother Andrew, is
[1:52:28] that really important?" I'll tell you
[1:52:30] this. Their joy has become the Lord.
[1:52:34] Their joy has become the Lord. And the
[1:52:37] Lord is your joy. Are you ready for
[1:52:39] this? And you can't stay away from
[1:52:41] church. You're getting somewhere.
[1:52:45] You say, "Does it pay off?" Amen. I say,
[1:52:47] "God bless my in-laws this morning."
[1:52:49] Amen. For years, Amen. They drove an
[1:52:51] hour to church or an hour and a half or
[1:52:53] 45 minutes. I don't think y'all ever
[1:52:55] live close to church. Still don't. Amen.
[1:52:58] But they made it a point to make sure
[1:53:00] their family was in the house of God.
[1:53:02] And out of that sacrifice, God has given
[1:53:04] me a Holy Ghost fililled wife. And out
[1:53:06] of that union has come a child. You say,
[1:53:09] "Preacher, church don't matter." It does
[1:53:12] matter because it's a powerful church.
[1:53:14] You ought to rather be here than in
[1:53:16] work. You ought to rather be here than
[1:53:18] at a ball game or at a soup supper in
[1:53:21] the house of God where we can shout till
[1:53:24] we feel good. We can dance till we feel
[1:53:26] like it. We can believe God and pray.
[1:53:33] Powerful church.
[1:53:37] What makes this church so powerful? Are
[1:53:40] you ready for this?
[1:53:43] We're all the same.
[1:53:47] Ain't nobody better than another.
[1:53:52] And ain't nobody lesser than another.
[1:53:55] Ain't no singer better than the next. I
[1:53:58] may be getting out of my boundaries. You
[1:53:59] can put me back in it. Ain't no preacher
[1:54:01] better than the next. Come on. Ain't no
[1:54:04] Ain't no musician better than the This
[1:54:06] ain't a talent show. It's a powerful
[1:54:10] church. That's why we call it Grace
[1:54:13] Tabernacle because God has given us
[1:54:16] unlimited
[1:54:17] grace. Unlimited grace. David Paul.
[1:54:20] Unlimited
[1:54:22] grace. Amen.
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:26] A powerful church. Yes, sir.
[1:54:29] Discipline restoration. I closed by
[1:54:32] saying this. Y'all remember brother
[1:54:34] Donnie Reagan was just here the other
[1:54:35] day. Brother Donniey's actually a very
[1:54:37] powerful powerful preacher, but he's
[1:54:40] also a very powerful woodsman
[1:54:42] woodworker. Years ago, I'll cut the
[1:54:44] story short, but if I remember to the
[1:54:46] best of my ability, I meant to get you a
[1:54:48] picture to put up there, but I forgot to
[1:54:49] send it. Years ago, he was on his way to
[1:54:51] South Carolina to preach a meeting. and
[1:54:52] he stopped at the antique shop and there
[1:54:53] was this big big beautiful piece of wood
[1:54:56] and it was a beautiful entertainment
[1:54:58] center and he said, "How much you want
[1:55:00] for
[1:55:01] that?" And the guy told him, he said, "I
[1:55:03] just I won't pay for that that much for
[1:55:05] it." He said, "That's nice." So he went
[1:55:06] on. So the next year he went back and he
[1:55:09] stopped there and he went in. Brother
[1:55:11] Travis, he's looking around. Oh, and he
[1:55:14] says, "That piece is missing." So he
[1:55:16] goes to the guy and he says, "Hey," he
[1:55:18] said, "Where'd that piece go? You must
[1:55:20] have sell it. Sold it. Y'all forgive me.
[1:55:22] I ain't got good grammar.
[1:55:25] You must have sold it. That guy said,
[1:55:26] "No, come with me." He said, "I want to
[1:55:27] show you
[1:55:29] something." So he brought him around
[1:55:32] back and he said, "See all them boxes
[1:55:35] right there?" He said, "Yeah." He said,
[1:55:38] "That's
[1:55:39] it." He said, "No." He said, "That piece
[1:55:43] that was hanging that was standing there
[1:55:44] is now in
[1:55:47] boxes." He said, "Yeah." He said, "Got
[1:55:49] knocked over last year."
[1:55:53] By time, I feel like running right now.
[1:55:57] Got knocked over last year.
[1:56:01] I've been there.
[1:56:04] Got knocked over. He said, "It broke. We
[1:56:06] just put it in boxes." He said, "How
[1:56:07] much you want for it?" He said, "Well, I
[1:56:09] tell you." He said, "It's worth that."
[1:56:11] Loaded it up in boxes, carried it back
[1:56:13] home. And I think for two or three
[1:56:16] years, little at a time,
[1:56:18] He worked on it and worked on it and
[1:56:21] worked on it and worked on it and worked
[1:56:24] on it and worked on it and worked on it
[1:56:28] and worked on it and no doubt he felt
[1:56:30] like giving up sometimes. But Jonah, he
[1:56:34] kept working on it and he kept working
[1:56:36] on it and he kept working on it because
[1:56:38] he had a vision for it.
[1:56:41] God bless you, Matt. He had a vision for
[1:56:44] this church. He had a vision for this
[1:56:46] people.
[1:56:47] kept working on it and working on it. He
[1:56:50] said after about four or five about four
[1:56:51] years I think it was he showed me a
[1:56:53] picture. He said, "Brother Andrew,"
[1:56:55] Amen. from boxes to a trophy.
[1:56:59] From boxes to a masterpiece. Listen, if
[1:57:02] you looked at it today, you would have
[1:57:04] never known at one time it was in a box
[1:57:07] behind an antique shop. Oh God, what
[1:57:10] made the difference? Somebody had an
[1:57:13] unlimited vision. They were not limited
[1:57:15] by the broken pieces. They were not
[1:57:17] limited by the scars. I close this
[1:57:19] morning by saying this. And so is Grace
[1:57:22] Tabernacle. Amen. From the boxes of sin,
[1:57:25] from the boxes of unbelief, from the
[1:57:27] boxes of depression, from the boxes of
[1:57:29] destruction, God the divine
[1:57:33] architected by the power of the Holy
[1:57:35] Ghost to rebuild a powerful church. I
[1:57:38] want you to stand on your feet this
[1:57:40] morning.
[1:57:43] It's a powerful church. Yeah. You say,
[1:57:46] "Why do you all have so much fun
[1:57:47] together?" Cuz we was all in the boxes
[1:57:49] together. Yes, sir. Glory to God.
[1:57:52] Hallelujah. We was all in the boxes
[1:57:54] together. We're just a bunch of country
[1:57:56] folks that knows God is able. He's able
[1:57:59] to save. He's able to heal.
[1:58:04] Oh, glory to God. I'm sorry. It's
[1:58:06] Sunday. I'm feeling too good. Come on,
[1:58:08] musicians.
[1:58:10] It's a powerful church. It's unlimited
[1:58:13] church. Amen.
[1:58:15] If God can do it in us, he can do it,
[1:58:18] brother Mark. In anybody,
[1:58:24] I
[1:58:25] refuse. I refuse to limit God,
[1:58:29] brother Benji. I refuse. I refuse to put
[1:58:32] my God in a box
[1:58:37] and say it's too broken. You got to stay
[1:58:40] there.
[1:58:41] I say this morning, this is an unlimited
[1:58:43] people.
[1:58:46] You said, "Brother Andrew, I wish I
[1:58:48] could just break out in that place where
[1:58:49] I could shout anytime I wanted to." It's
[1:58:51] here this morning,
[1:58:54] brother. And Andrew, is there a place I
[1:58:56] can go in God? Where I can just worship?
[1:59:00] We're on a journey together,
[1:59:02] friends, and we're
[1:59:06] growing. We're a family.
[1:59:10] We're a powerful family.
[1:59:13] Brother Joe, I was sitting in my office
[1:59:15] yesterday and just got to reminiscing.
[1:59:18] First time I ever come to Arkansas and
[1:59:20] preach there in Hardy. I you I don't
[1:59:23] know if you remember the girls probably
[1:59:25] do too Sunday night, the power of God
[1:59:28] just dropped in the building. Brother
[1:59:30] Joe got up there and got singing that
[1:59:32] song, Me and the Devil had a tussle. You
[1:59:34] probably remember that.
[1:59:37] power of God dropped in there and them
[1:59:39] them girls were shouting and dancing.
[1:59:41] Sister Beth was up there with him. Y'all
[1:59:43] was running around the building stomping
[1:59:45] the devil. Chloe, she's just little girl
[1:59:48] then. I think she's stomping around with
[1:59:49] him
[1:59:51] too. What 11, 12 years
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:55] ago. Here we are all these years down
[1:59:58] the
[1:59:59] road still shouting for Jesus.
[2:00:02] Brother Joe still preaching the gospel
[2:00:04] and stomping on the devil's head. Hey,
[2:00:08] that wasn't a limited shout. God give
[2:00:09] them girls holy ghost fil
[2:00:11] husbands. Tim, he come and got you. You
[2:00:14] weren't raising a message, but he come
[2:00:15] and got you because he's an unlimited
[2:00:17] God. Are y'all hearing me? I refuse to
[2:00:21] let mistakes limit my fellowship. I
[2:00:23] refuse I refuse to let
[2:00:26] misunderstandings, Amen, limit the
[2:00:28] ability of this church.
[2:00:29] I I give misunderstandings a kick in the
[2:00:33] sea of bridges this morning. get out of
[2:00:35] Grace Tabernacle. We're a powerful
[2:00:37] church. We're a forgiving church. We're
[2:00:40] a loving church. We ought to fall down
[2:00:42] together, but we'll get back up and
[2:00:44] we'll keep on preaching and we'll keep
[2:00:46] on singing. We'll keep on shouting and
[2:00:48] dancing and having Holy Ghost meetings
[2:00:51] because this is what God intended.
[2:00:55] We will not lay down. We will not be
[2:00:58] restricted.
[2:01:00] We will not be limited.
[2:01:04] Unlimited unlimited
[2:01:06] mercies, unlimited
[2:01:09] graces, unlimited
[2:01:11] power, unlimited
[2:01:13] miracles, unlimited signs and
[2:01:17] wonders. Can I say this to you?
[2:01:20] Unlimited prodals.
[2:01:24] Unlimited new converts.
[2:01:31] Unlimited
[2:01:34] unlimited. How many say this morning,
[2:01:36] Lord, take the limits off?
[2:01:40] Have you Have you been looking at a
[2:01:42] situation so long that your thinking has
[2:01:46] limited the way you
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:49] believe? Have you been looking at the
[2:01:52] impossible so
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:55] long? You know, Cody, it's real easy to
[2:01:58] do that.
[2:01:59] It's real easy
[2:02:01] to to get to looking at something. I've
[2:02:03] been there. Get to looking at something
[2:02:05] so long that it just starts narrowing
[2:02:08] down your
[2:02:10] vision. And all you see is this problem
[2:02:13] and this situation.
[2:02:16] Before long, it starts controlling the
[2:02:18] way you worship, controlling the way you
[2:02:22] praise. Come on, folks. The battle's not
[2:02:24] ours, it's God's morning.
[2:02:28] You ever been there and it's just it
[2:02:30] just gets to a point where there's no
[2:02:33] way
[2:02:34] out? But I got good news this
[2:02:37] morning. God has an infinite number,
[2:02:41] an infinite number of
[2:02:43] solutions. Can I say this morning, this
[2:02:46] powerful church has a powerful weapon.
[2:02:49] It's called prayer.
[2:02:52] Amen. And it's
[2:02:54] unlimited. And church, you can pray.
[2:02:58] Brother Morgan, you can pray till things
[2:03:01] start changing.
[2:03:03] [Music]
[2:03:05] Brother Xavier, you can pray. And while
[2:03:08] you're
[2:03:09] praying, things start changing.
[2:03:12] Amen. He's in the building this morning.
[2:03:16] Have you limited him? Have you limited
[2:03:18] him by their thinking or your theology?
[2:03:21] Have you limited him by the
[2:03:22] circumstances?
[2:03:25] this morning. I wonder how many
[2:03:28] believers here this morning would agree
[2:03:30] with me. I'm ready to climb to the next
[2:03:36] level. I'm ready to go another
[2:03:40] step. I'm tired of this ceiling. I think
[2:03:43] it was Brother Wayne said it a few years
[2:03:45] ago out in the tent meetings. He said,
[2:03:46] "Take take your your ceiling and make it
[2:03:50] your floor."
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:53] That's the truth this morning.
[2:03:56] If you want to stay at 50 miles an hour,
[2:03:57] just stay in the
[2:04:02] car. If you want to stay tore up all the
[2:04:05] time, then you should have just stayed
[2:04:06] in the
[2:04:07] situation. But you come out of it.
[2:04:10] So come out of it. Leave it behind you.
[2:04:14] Well, they did. They said, she said, she
[2:04:16] did. He said, "Leave it behind you."
[2:04:19] And just keep on climbing.
[2:04:21] There's
[2:04:22] unlimited unlimited revival. Bow your
[2:04:26] hearts with us this
[2:04:28] morning. An
[2:04:30] unlimited powerful
[2:04:33] church. An
[2:04:35] unlimited powerful
[2:04:39] church. With every head bowed, every eye
[2:04:41] closed this morning.
[2:04:43] How many could say,
[2:04:45] "Lord, I want you to come by my way this
[2:04:48] morning. Take the limits
[2:04:52] off. My thinking has limited
[2:04:55] you. Theology has limited
[2:04:58] you. Lord, this situation and this
[2:05:00] problem has limited you. But today,
[2:05:04] Lord, while you're passing through this
[2:05:06] building, through this church, would you
[2:05:08] come by my heart? Lord, would you remove
[2:05:11] the
[2:05:13] limitations? Brother Bam told us to
[2:05:15] believe God for big things. He said to
[2:05:18] expect great
[2:05:20] things. I believe it this morning,
[2:05:22] church. I believe it's time to expect
[2:05:23] great things. I believe it's time to
[2:05:26] expect God to perform greater miracles.
[2:05:29] I believe it's time to expect the things
[2:05:32] that God has promised that we have a
[2:05:33] right to expect. It's
[2:05:37] time. Maybe you're looking at your
[2:05:39] family and your mama or your daddy or
[2:05:41] your loved ones and you're saying
[2:05:42] there's no way at all they could ever be
[2:05:44] saved this situation and this problem.
[2:05:47] But today you say, "Lord, if I'm a part
[2:05:49] of this powerful church and you're in my
[2:05:52] life, then you're unlimited. You can
[2:05:54] save them. You can deliver them because
[2:05:57] you're God and you're unlimited." This
[2:06:01] morning, let me say, "Lord, take the
[2:06:03] limits off my faith. Take the limits off
[2:06:06] my worship. Take the limits off my love.
[2:06:09] Take the limits off of my forgiveness,
[2:06:11] Lord. Lord, take the limits off of my
[2:06:14] understanding, Lord. Take the limits off
[2:06:16] of Take the limits off of my compassion,
[2:06:19] Lord. Take the limits off. I want to be
[2:06:23] a direct reflection of the literal life
[2:06:26] of Jesus
[2:06:27] Christ. Oh my. He's moving all over this
[2:06:30] building this morning. Maybe you're here
[2:06:32] this morning and you're in the box. The
[2:06:35] master builder's in the house.
[2:06:37] He's here to start putting you back
[2:06:39] together piece by
[2:06:41] piece.
[2:06:43] Hallelujah. Almighty God, you're in this
[2:06:47] building this
[2:06:48] morning. Lord, you're in your house
[2:06:51] today and your house is the church of
[2:06:53] the living God, the pillar of
[2:06:56] truth. Lord God, manifested in
[2:06:59] flesh. Now Lord, this is more than just
[2:07:02] a people standing before me. Lord, this
[2:07:05] is more than just a group of religious
[2:07:07] people on a Sunday morning, but Lord,
[2:07:10] this is your people. Lord, this is your
[2:07:13] church. Now, Father, if we wanted to
[2:07:15] stay at a certain speed, we should have
[2:07:17] stayed in the car or in the automobile
[2:07:20] or in the horse and buggy. Lord, if we
[2:07:23] wanted to remain a certain speed, we
[2:07:24] should have just stayed in an airplane.
[2:07:27] But Lord, you called us out of the horse
[2:07:28] and buggy into the car. And you called
[2:07:31] us out of the car into the airplane. But
[2:07:33] Lord, in these last days through the
[2:07:35] seventh angel's message, you've called a
[2:07:37] people out of the airplane into the
[2:07:40] astronaut. Lord, where they're going not
[2:07:42] just above the sound barrier, beyond the
[2:07:44] speed of light, but Lord, they're
[2:07:46] literally breaking out of dimensions. Oh
[2:07:48] God, Lord, they're going beyond
[2:07:50] dimensions, Lord. They're going into
[2:07:51] realms where all things are possible.
[2:07:54] Lord, they're going into dimensions
[2:07:55] where theophanes are. Lord, they're
[2:07:57] fellowshipping, Lord, with another
[2:07:58] dimension. Now, Satan, I know you've
[2:08:00] done everything you can to limit this
[2:08:02] people, to limit their faith, to limit
[2:08:04] their abilities. Lord, you've tried to
[2:08:06] limit our singers, and you tried to
[2:08:08] limit the ministry and try to limit the
[2:08:10] musicians and limit the officers of the
[2:08:12] church and the young people. You've
[2:08:14] tried to limit every aspect of this
[2:08:15] church you can. But, Satan, I stand up
[2:08:18] on the authority of God's word this
[2:08:19] morning, and I say, you have lost the
[2:08:21] battle, Satan. You have not successfully
[2:08:24] limited this church. You have not
[2:08:26] successfully limited this pastor. But
[2:08:28] Lord, your word has been preached in the
[2:08:30] face of every opposition. It has been
[2:08:32] preached in the face of every adversary.
[2:08:34] And Lord, there's a church on its feet
[2:08:36] this morning, believing the unlimited
[2:08:38] God has sent an unlimited message with
[2:08:41] unlimited power, unlimited revival.
[2:08:44] Lord, I pray this morning as the Holy
[2:08:46] Ghost is moving across this building.
[2:08:48] Lord, I believe the sound barrier of
[2:08:50] this church has already been broken.
[2:08:52] Lord, I believe the grace tabernacle is
[2:08:54] sailing in an in an unrestricted,
[2:08:56] unlimited dimension, Lord. But Lord, if
[2:09:00] there be one member in here that has
[2:09:02] their own sound barrier that's not been
[2:09:04] broken, Lord, may it be broken today
[2:09:08] that they can climb up on in that higher
[2:09:09] dimension.
[2:09:11] Lord, if there's one that needs to just
[2:09:13] let something go. Lord, if there's one
[2:09:16] that just needs to let let an
[2:09:18] unforgiveness go or just let a hard
[2:09:20] feeling go or just let an unforgiveness
[2:09:23] or bitterness
[2:09:24] go. May this be the
[2:09:27] day in Jesus
[2:09:30] name. In Jesus
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:37] name. Now there is life
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:45] darkness. Now there is hope.
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:55] Brother, would you come and help us sing
[2:09:56] it?
[2:09:58] His name.
[2:10:03] Oh yes. Just close your eyes this
[2:10:05] morning.
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:08] Like that little girl. Oh yes. Dead in
[2:10:11] all our sin.
[2:10:15] Jesus touched his heart of mine.
[2:10:17] Hallelujah. Gave me life again.
[2:10:22] I am just a house of clay.
[2:10:26] Ever since that blessed day,
[2:10:30] there's a light that shines on me for
[2:10:33] all the world to
[2:10:36] see. He's in the
[2:10:39] house. Oh, death has to flee.
[2:10:44] Oh, now there is light.
[2:10:48] Where darkness shoots through me. Now
[2:10:52] there is hope.
[2:10:56] There's no more
[2:10:58] down. I will praise his
[2:11:01] name. Oh, praise his name.
[2:11:07] He's in the house. First verse.
[2:11:10] Oh yes.
[2:11:12] Oh little girl was lying there. The
[2:11:16] people all were weeping. Hallelujah.
[2:11:20] They just laughed at
[2:11:22] Jesus. She said she's only sleeping.
[2:11:27] Glory. Oh, as he took her by the hand.
[2:11:32] She began to live again. Oh, you believe
[2:11:35] that this morning? Won't you worship him
[2:11:37] today?
[2:11:39] He's in the house this morning. He's
[2:11:42] here today, folks.
[2:11:44] He's here in power.
[2:11:47] He's here in reality this morning. Oh,
[2:11:50] now there is. He's here in forgiveness
[2:11:53] where darkness.
[2:11:55] You don't have to fear this anointing.
[2:11:57] Surrender to it.
[2:12:00] You don't have to fear the ability of
[2:12:01] God. Surrender to it.
[2:12:04] I will praise him. Oh, just praise him
[2:12:07] this morning. Praise. Take the limits
[2:12:10] off of your praise.
[2:12:12] Take the limits off of your worship this
[2:12:14] morning.
[2:12:16] Hallelujah.
[2:12:18] We were like that little girl. Yes, we
[2:12:21] were dead in all our dead in all our
[2:12:23] sins. Oh, but Jesus touched his heart.
[2:12:27] He touched this heart of ours. He gave
[2:12:29] me life. Hallelujah. Oh
[2:12:32] glory. I am just the house of
[2:12:35] clay. But ever since that blessed day,
[2:12:40] there's a light that shines on me for
[2:12:44] all the world to see. He's in my house.
[2:12:50] Oh, death had to flee. He's in this
[2:12:53] church. Oh, now there is life. He's in
[2:12:57] his people this morning. darkness. He's
[2:13:00] here this morning.
[2:13:02] Now there is hope. Hallelujah.
[2:13:06] He's here in his mercies. He's here in
[2:13:08] his grace.
[2:13:11] Glory. I will praise his name. For he's
[2:13:16] in the house. Oh, and death has to flee.
[2:13:23] Oh, now there is light.
[2:13:26] Oh, where darkness.
[2:13:29] Oh, yes. Now there is soul.
[2:13:34] Oh, there's no more doubts. No more
[2:13:37] doubts. I will praise his name. I'll
[2:13:41] praise his name. I'll praise his name. I
[2:13:45] will praise his name. I'll praise his
[2:13:50] name. Once more. I'll praise his name.
[2:13:54] Oh yeah. Take your limits off your
[2:13:56] praise.
[2:13:57] Go ahead. Take the limits off your
[2:13:59] praise. Praise your name. Take your
[2:14:02] limits off your praise. Praise your
[2:14:05] Hallelujah. For he's in the high.
[2:14:10] Can I say this to you this morning? An
[2:14:12] unlimited God deserves unlimited praise.
[2:14:17] You believe that this morning, sis? An
[2:14:19] unlimited God. You believe that this
[2:14:22] morning, Brother Joe? Do you believe
[2:14:24] that if any two or three agree is
[2:14:26] touching any one thing, it shall be done
[2:14:29] upon the earth. Can I say this to you
[2:14:31] this morning? An unlimited God deserves
[2:14:34] unlimited praise. What is limiting your
[2:14:37] praise right now is defeated in the name
[2:14:40] of Jesus Christ. There is nothing the
[2:14:43] devil can do with a church that takes
[2:14:45] their limits off of praise. You say,
[2:14:47] "Brother Andrew, I don't feel like it."
[2:14:49] Your feelings are limiting your praise.
[2:14:51] But denounce your feelings this morning.
[2:14:53] Brother Andrew, I'm not good enough.
[2:14:55] Your human efforts are limiting your
[2:14:57] praise. But denounce those efforts this
[2:14:59] morning. And remember, he's God and he's
[2:15:02] unlimited. And he deserves an unlimited
[2:15:05] praise.
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:08] You say, "How do I praise him?"
[2:15:09] Unlimited. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I
[2:15:13] thank you, Jesus. Amen. That's the
[2:15:15] truth. You saved my soul. You heal. See,
[2:15:18] I know what I'm doing right now. I'm
[2:15:19] doing war with the devil. He's trying to
[2:15:21] damper this atmosphere, but it's time to
[2:15:24] take the restrictions off of it. You
[2:15:27] say, "We got church order." Church order
[2:15:29] is not a restriction on the Holy Ghost.
[2:15:31] It's a restriction on the devil that
[2:15:34] tries to bring false things into the
[2:15:36] church. That's fresh. This is the church
[2:15:39] of the living God where the power of God
[2:15:41] ought to have a right of way to move.
[2:15:44] Brother Matt, would you come? God bless
[2:15:47] you this morning.
[2:15:51] Death has to flee.
[2:15:54] Now there is life.
[2:15:57] Where darkness used to
[2:16:00] be. Now there is
[2:16:04] hope. There's no more
[2:16:07] doubt. So I'll praise his name.
[2:16:12] Oh, praise his
[2:16:14] name. He's in the house.
[2:16:19] Death has to flee.
[2:16:22] Now there is
[2:16:25] life where darkness used to
[2:16:28] be. Now there is
[2:16:32] hope. There's no more
[2:16:35] doubt. I'm praise his
[2:16:39] name. Praise his
[2:16:42] name. He's in the house.
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:49] A little girl was lying
[2:16:52] there. People all weeping.
[2:16:56] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[2:17:00] she was only sleeping.
[2:17:04] As he took her by the
[2:17:06] hand, she began to live
[2:17:10] again. Some began to praise the Lord.
[2:17:14] Some began to sing.
[2:17:18] He's in the
[2:17:20] house. Oh, death has to
[2:17:24] flee. Oh, now there
[2:17:27] is where darkness used to
[2:17:31] be. Now there is
[2:17:34] hope. There's no more
[2:17:37] doubt. I will praise his
[2:17:41] name. Praise his name.
[2:17:46] is in the house.
[2:17:48] [Music]
[2:17:52] We were like that little girl. We were
[2:17:55] dead in all our
[2:17:57] sins. To Jesus touched his heart of mine
[2:18:02] and gave me life
[2:18:05] again. I am just a house of flame. Ever
[2:18:09] since that blessed
[2:18:12] day, there's a light that shines on me
[2:18:15] for all the world to
[2:18:18] see. He's in the
[2:18:21] house. Oh, death has to
[2:18:25] flee. Now there is
[2:18:28] light where darkness used to
[2:18:32] be. Now there is
[2:18:35] hope. There's no more doubt.
[2:18:39] So I praise his
[2:18:42] name. Praise his
[2:18:46] name. He's in the
[2:18:50] house. I'd rather have
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:56] Oh, I'd
[2:18:59] rather have
[2:19:01] Jesus than
[2:19:04] silver or gold.
[2:19:08] I would
[2:19:09] rather be
[2:19:11] his than have
[2:19:14] riches
[2:19:16] untold. Yes, I would
[2:19:19] rather have
[2:19:22] Jesus than
[2:19:24] houses or lands.
[2:19:27] I would
[2:19:29] rather be
[2:19:31] led by his
[2:19:36] name than to
[2:19:39] be over the
[2:19:42] king of a
[2:19:45] vast
[2:19:47] man and behave.
[2:19:55] [Music]
[2:19:56] Yes, I would
[2:19:59] rather have
[2:20:02] Jesus
[2:20:04] than
[2:20:06] anything that this
[2:20:09] world
[2:20:11] afold
[2:20:14] today. Yes, I would
[2:20:19] rather have
[2:20:21] Jesus than me.
[2:20:27] I would
[2:20:27] [Music]
[2:20:35] ra I'd
[2:20:38] rather have
[2:20:40] Jesus than
[2:20:43] were
[2:20:45] faith and I'd
[2:20:47] rather be
[2:20:49] true to his
[2:20:52] holy
[2:20:53] name. more than to
[2:20:57] be the
[2:20:59] king of the master.
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:05] [Applause]
[2:21:09] [Music]
[2:21:09] [Applause]
[2:21:13] Yes, I would
[2:21:16] rather have
[2:21:18] Jesus
[2:21:20] than
[2:21:22] anything that this
[2:21:25] world
[2:21:28] afford today.
[2:21:32] Oh, then to
[2:21:35] be a
[2:21:37] king of a
[2:21:39] vast
[2:21:42] doain and be
[2:21:44] held in
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:50] sin. Guess I would
[2:21:53] rather have
[2:21:56] Jesus than
[2:22:00] anything that this world.
[2:22:03] [Music]
[2:22:16] Sing with me. How
[2:22:19] great is our God and all will see how
[2:22:26] great how
[2:22:28] great is our
[2:22:31] God. Can you sing it with me now? I say,
[2:22:35] how
[2:22:37] great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How

[2:24:46] beginning and the
[2:24:47] end. Beginning and the end. Amen. This
[2:24:50] is our God. Oh
[2:24:53] [Music]
[2:24:56] God. He's the
[2:24:58] father and
[2:25:00] son. The lion and the lamb.
[2:25:06] I
[2:25:09] say he's our God. Oh, sing with
[2:25:14] me. He's our God. And all will see our
[2:25:20] great. Oh, how
[2:25:22] great is our God.
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:29] There's a name
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:35] above
[2:25:37] all. So I lift my
[2:25:40] heart to sing my
[2:25:44] praise God. He's my Lord. He's the name.
[2:25:50] He's the name of our Lord. Lord, you're
[2:25:53] higher than all
[2:25:57] worthy. Lord, you're worthy of all. And
[2:26:00] my heart will sing. So I give my
[2:26:04] heart. Say,
[2:26:07] how is my God? Sing with me. How great
[2:26:13] is my
[2:26:14] God. Oh, sing. How great, how
[2:26:19] great is my God.
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:25] For he's a name above all
[2:26:30] names. Lord, you're worthy of all
[2:26:35] praise. And now the heart will sing. How
[2:26:40] great is our God.
[2:26:46] For he's the name above all
[2:26:52] name worthy of all
[2:26:56] praise. And my heart will sing. How
[2:27:01] great is our
[2:27:03] [Music]
[2:27:05] God. I say how
[2:27:09] great is our God. Sing with me. How
[2:27:14] great is our
[2:27:17] God will sing. How great, how
[2:27:22] great is our God?
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:32] Is he a great God? If he's been a little
[2:27:34] God to you, just give him a little hand
[2:27:36] clap of praise. But if he's been a great
[2:27:38] God, then give him a great one. I say
[2:27:41] he's great. He's worthy of our praise to
[2:27:45] give glory unto our creator that made us
[2:27:48] this way. Isn't it wonderful to serve a
[2:27:52] God like that? How great he is. Somebody
[2:27:54] say, "He's a great God."
[2:27:57] He's a wonderful God. He's brought us
[2:27:59] through all things into this place, such
[2:28:02] a time as this, that we can lift our
[2:28:04] hands and worship our creator. Amen. I
[2:28:07] believe he's worthy of our praise
[2:28:09] tonight. Somebody say, "Praise the
[2:28:11] Lord."
[2:28:11] Shout to the Lord.
[2:28:17] My Jesus,
[2:28:21] a
[2:28:22] savior. Lord, there is none like you.
[2:28:28] All of my
[2:28:31] days I want to
[2:28:34] praise the wonders of your
[2:28:38] mighty your mighty
[2:28:44] love, my
[2:28:47] comfort, Lord. My
[2:28:50] shelter, my tower of refuge and
[2:28:54] strength.
[2:28:56] Let every
[2:28:58] breath and all that I
[2:29:02] am never cease to
[2:29:07] worship
[2:29:10] you. Shout to the
[2:29:13] Lord on the earth. Let us
[2:29:16] sing of your power and majesty.
[2:29:21] Praise to the king.
[2:29:24] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[2:29:29] roar at the sound of your wonderful
[2:29:34] name.
[2:29:37] I sing for joy.
[2:29:39] At the work of your
[2:29:42] hands. Forever I love you and forever.
[2:29:47] [Music]
[2:29:49] Nothing
[2:29:51] compares to the promise I had in you.
[2:30:00] [Music]
[2:30:03] I
[2:30:05] comfort. I see you, Lord. There is none
[2:30:10] like
[2:30:12] you all of my days. How many promise you
[2:30:17] want to pray? That's the zeal that's on
[2:30:19] my heart. Wonders of your mind.
[2:30:26] Lord, you are my mercy.
[2:30:31] You're my
[2:30:33] shelter. My
[2:30:39] power breath. Lord, I give up and all
[2:30:42] that I
[2:30:43] am. May you never change
[2:30:47] your I worship
[2:30:51] you. Shout to the
[2:30:54] Lord on the earth. Let us
[2:30:57] sing of your power and
[2:31:01] majesty. Praise to the
[2:31:03] king. The mountains bow
[2:31:06] down and the seas will roar at the sound
[2:31:11] of your wonderful name.
[2:31:17] I sing for
[2:31:19] joy at the work of your hands and
[2:31:23] forever I love you. Forever I stand.
[2:31:30] Nothing
[2:31:31] compares to the promise I have. I say
[2:31:36] nothing
[2:31:38] compares to the promise I have. I say
[2:31:42] nothing
[2:31:44] compares to the promise I
[2:31:47] have in you.
[2:31:54] Amen. Won't you give him a hand? Clap
[2:31:55] for
[2:31:56] praise. I sing for joy.
[2:32:00] at the work of thy
[2:32:02] hands. Ain't that wonderful? You look
[2:32:04] around this room today, you want to you
[2:32:06] know what? You see the work of the hands
[2:32:09] of the creator.
[2:32:11] The potter that took broken vessels and
[2:32:14] made them new. I remember I was over in
[2:32:18] India one time and I have a piece of
[2:32:20] pottery in my office. If if he's if he's
[2:32:22] okay, grab that real quick. Is it
[2:32:24] locked? I have a piece of pottery in my
[2:32:26] office after we had a meeting over there
[2:32:28] with young people. Had uh 20 or so of
[2:32:32] those young people that gave their heart
[2:32:33] to the Lord. Little Hindu boys and girls
[2:32:35] that never heard anything about our Lord
[2:32:39] Jesus. But in a meeting and in an
[2:32:42] atmosphere like this, they denounced
[2:32:44] their Hindu gods of Krishna. These kids
[2:32:47] that I watched, I videoed kids from the
[2:32:50] time they were able to walk. Little boys
[2:32:52] and girls pulling up to a a statue on
[2:32:54] the side of the road and getting off
[2:32:56] their little bicycles and out the little
[2:32:57] Rick Shaws and going up to the statue
[2:32:59] and ringing the bell and putting in a
[2:33:01] little offering and getting some stuff
[2:33:02] and putting on their head and and they
[2:33:04] they they would literally bow down and
[2:33:06] worship an idol, a statue that was
[2:33:08] sitting in a little caged area. I
[2:33:10] watched out my window, videoed it. These
[2:33:12] young kids, no doubt their entire lives
[2:33:14] they' done that. Brother Kyle, one day
[2:33:16] they got in the presence of a real life
[2:33:18] God and he took the desire of this world
[2:33:21] out of their heart and put a desire to
[2:33:23] serve him. In that meeting, there was a
[2:33:25] woman that had back trouble that had
[2:33:27] been going on for many years and the
[2:33:28] Lord healed her. There was another that
[2:33:30] had been that that was having trouble
[2:33:32] with speech and wasn't able to speak
[2:33:34] plainly. The Lord healed them all the
[2:33:35] stambering lips and and delivered them
[2:33:37] right in the meeting. Here these young
[2:33:38] kids had seen the power of God and they
[2:33:40] gave their heart to the Lord. We went
[2:33:41] down to the river and we were baptizing
[2:33:43] them. And I remember walking down that
[2:33:44] river bank and those those uh brothers
[2:33:47] were sitting there and they were all the
[2:33:49] pastors and different ones, some of the
[2:33:51] uh different uh leaders that had came
[2:33:53] and there was about 20 or so of us
[2:33:55] sitting on the riverbank watching them
[2:33:56] kids get baptized and knowing that when
[2:33:59] they went home that their parents didn't
[2:34:00] even have to receive them into their
[2:34:02] house. In fact, in order to a lot of
[2:34:04] their parents in order to keep the jobs
[2:34:06] that they have, they couldn't allow a
[2:34:07] Christian kid to live in their home. And
[2:34:09] so they' put them in an orphanage. We
[2:34:10] even helped uh with with some of that
[2:34:12] that they'd have a place to live when
[2:34:13] they went just because they wanted to
[2:34:15] accept Jesus Christ as a savior. But I
[2:34:18] remember sitting on that bank and down
[2:34:20] there there was a piece of pottery, a
[2:34:21] little little bowl like this. And I, you
[2:34:24] know, kind of was raised in Arkansas and
[2:34:25] we always love pottery and stuff like
[2:34:27] that cuz we're the um Indian artifacts
[2:34:30] and and so you know I went down and I
[2:34:32] picked that up. I said, "Well, that's
[2:34:33] that's that's nice. I I'll take that
[2:34:35] home." And those brothers, "Oh, brother
[2:34:36] Matt, you don't want that? Throw that
[2:34:38] down. Throw it down. throw it down. And
[2:34:40] I said, "Well, why why not? I I I like
[2:34:42] artifacts." And he said, "No, brother."
[2:34:44] He said, "That that you can't use that.
[2:34:46] It was used to serve other gods. It was
[2:34:49] where they burned incense to the goddess
[2:34:51] of the sea, and they come down on the
[2:34:52] side of the river and they would they
[2:34:54] would burn things in it, and they would
[2:34:55] make offerings under their god." He
[2:34:56] said, "No, that's that's trash." He
[2:34:58] said, "It was used to serve other gods."
[2:35:00] Man, something just came all over me. I
[2:35:02] turned around and looked at all those
[2:35:03] young people and I said, "Brother, so
[2:35:06] were they.
[2:35:07] But God picked them up. He didn't leave
[2:35:09] them where they were. It didn't matter
[2:35:11] what they were used to serve. You know
[2:35:12] what? Every one of us was used to serve
[2:35:14] something else. We were used to serve
[2:35:16] another God. But I thank God that a
[2:35:18] potter came by one day and he picked up
[2:35:20] that vessel. It may have been used for
[2:35:22] another purpose. He said, "But I got a
[2:35:23] purpose for it and he made us." Do you
[2:35:25] realize that God made all things? You go
[2:35:27] through your whole life. It's shaking
[2:35:29] grounds. Brother Brother Andrew said
[2:35:30] we're we're going to break the sound
[2:35:32] barrier. It's shaky grounds that we've
[2:35:34] gone through. it. But I remember in the
[2:35:36] Bible, Acts the 7th chapter in the 50th
[2:35:38] verse, he said, "Did not my hands make
[2:35:41] all these things? Where is the place of
[2:35:44] my rest? What house would you build me?
[2:35:46] What what what temple would you build me
[2:35:48] that I can rest in?" God was looking for
[2:35:50] a resting place. And he said, "But has
[2:35:53] not my hands made these things." Wasn't
[2:35:56] just the world that he made, but it was
[2:35:57] these things that he made. It was a
[2:35:59] place of his rest. I think that's quite
[2:36:01] odd that Brother Andrew's been preaching
[2:36:02] on that sound bearer. You know, you know
[2:36:04] how fast it is to break the sound
[2:36:05] barrier is 750 mph here. Whenever you're
[2:36:09] looking for peace and being in a broken
[2:36:11] place, but Acts 7:50 says, "But hath not
[2:36:14] I made all these things." Isn't that
[2:36:16] wonderful? There's a place to get beyond
[2:36:19] this earthly flesh and serving the
[2:36:21] There's a place to break the sound
[2:36:22] barrier. You say, "Brother Matt, well,
[2:36:23] where is it this morning?" Let me tell
[2:36:24] you where it is. It's to kneel down at
[2:36:26] the Savior's feet. It's to accept Jesus
[2:36:29] Christ over your life. You do what that
[2:36:31] little woman did in the book of in the
[2:36:33] book of Luke when she went down and she
[2:36:35] knelt down at his feet when nobody would
[2:36:37] entertain him. She knelt down and she
[2:36:39] she started washing his feet. And
[2:36:42] brother Xavier, she washed his feet and
[2:36:44] they came in and they they they they
[2:36:46] made fun and mocked and what would you
[2:36:48] what would you have anything to do with
[2:36:49] this sinner? But again, he's trying to
[2:36:51] take her to another place. And he looked
[2:36:53] at that woman and he said, "Woman, you
[2:36:56] go in peace for thy faith has saved
[2:36:59] thee.
[2:37:00] You know what chapter? You know what
[2:37:02] book that was? It was Luke the 7th
[2:37:04] chapter and the 50th verse. See, he's
[2:37:07] taking us to another place. There's a
[2:37:09] place beyond the barriers of this life
[2:37:11] that God is calling us to. It's a place
[2:37:13] of salvation. Not only I feel like
[2:37:15] preaching, but it's a place where God
[2:37:17] can dwell in the heart of every man
[2:37:18] where God can use these vessels that he
[2:37:21] has made for his purpose. You weren't
[2:37:23] made for the devil to use. You was made
[2:37:24] for God to use. The devil's used you,
[2:37:27] but that was not your purpose.
[2:37:29] He was made for God to use. So I sing
[2:37:32] for joy at the work of your hands.
[2:37:35] Forever I'll love you and forever I'll
[2:37:38] stand. How many lift your hands this
[2:37:40] morning? Can you say this with me?
[2:37:42] Forever I'll love you and forever I'll
[2:37:44] stand. For nothing compares to the
[2:37:47] promise that I have in you. Isn't that
[2:37:50] wonderful? Do you love the Lord this
[2:37:53] morning?
[2:37:54] Oh my Jesus.
[2:38:00] My
[2:38:01] savior, Lord. There is none like
[2:38:06] you. All of my
[2:38:09] days I want to
[2:38:13] praise the wonders of your mighty
[2:38:18] your mighty love.
[2:38:21] [Music]
[2:38:23] I comfort.
[2:38:27] You're my shelter, my tower of
[2:38:31] refuge and
[2:38:33] strength. Let every
[2:38:36] breath and all that I
[2:38:40] am never cease to worship.
[2:38:45] Won't you just lift your hand and praise
[2:38:47] the Lord this morning? Shout to the
[2:38:50] Lord. All the earth, let us sing of your
[2:38:55] power and
[2:38:57] majesty. Praise to the
[2:39:02] King and the
[2:39:05] [Music]
[2:39:06] Jes at the sound of your wonderful name.
[2:39:13] I sing for
[2:39:16] joy at the work of your hands.
[2:39:20] Forever I love you. Forever I'll
[2:39:26] stand. Nothing compares to the promise
[2:39:30] promise I have
[2:39:33] nothing
[2:39:35] compares to the promise I
[2:39:38] have in you.
[2:39:42] [Music]
[2:39:45] Lord Jesus, how we love you this
[2:39:48] morning. We're so thankful, Lord, for
[2:39:50] your
[2:39:51] presence, God. What a wonderful word
[2:39:54] that you've given us, Lord.
[2:39:57] God, no doubt we look at our flesh and
[2:40:00] we see ourselves limited and we see the
[2:40:04] limitations of our very existence and
[2:40:07] our nature, our failures and Lord, our
[2:40:11] own abilities
[2:40:12] and but Lord, we thank you Lord that
[2:40:16] your word sees beyond those things.
[2:40:19] God, hear that you would come this
[2:40:20] morning and speak to our hearts. And
[2:40:23] God, that you would bring our hearts and
[2:40:24] minds, Lord, beyond our inabilities,
[2:40:27] Lord, to know that you have a way to
[2:40:30] bring us in a higher place, Lord. I know
[2:40:33] there's such a mighty work that's been
[2:40:35] done here this morning, Lord. We'll
[2:40:36] never forget this day, God. Hearts,
[2:40:39] Lord, that have turned to you, Lord.
[2:40:42] Souls, Lord, that have that have given
[2:40:44] over to you. men that have been filled
[2:40:45] with the Holy Ghost, Lord, the thing
[2:40:48] that they've been searching for their
[2:40:49] whole life, God, in this very moment,
[2:40:52] Lord, something happened, God, that
[2:40:54] would turn their life around, God,
[2:40:56] whenever you would speak to the inner
[2:40:58] parts of our being, Lord. God, you know
[2:41:01] the desires of our heart, Lord, even
[2:41:02] when Satan would come to say, "I've
[2:41:05] heard this before, and I've felt this
[2:41:06] before, and you know, I I don't want to
[2:41:09] go down that road again, but Lord,
[2:41:11] there's something in us, Lord, that's
[2:41:13] drawn us past it.
[2:41:14] Lord, I pray that you would bless each
[2:41:16] one as we go from this place. God, bless
[2:41:19] our brother, Lord, that battles and
[2:41:21] sisters, Lord, that battles, God, how
[2:41:23] the enemy, Lord, would so battle our
[2:41:25] minds, Lord, to tear us down. But God, I
[2:41:28] pray that you would bring a peace upon
[2:41:29] our life. God, may we kneel down before
[2:41:32] thee in our heart, Lord, like that
[2:41:34] little woman did, God. May we wash your
[2:41:36] feet with our tears and dry them with
[2:41:39] our hair, Lord. May we wash you with our
[2:41:41] praise.
[2:41:42] God, may you lift us up. Lord, may you
[2:41:44] break through all the noise of all the
[2:41:46] critics around our life. And God, let us
[2:41:48] raise up, Lord, victorious as a servant,
[2:41:50] as sons and daughters of God. Lord,
[2:41:53] that's the desire of our heart, Lord. We
[2:41:56] thank you for all you've done. Lord, I
[2:41:57] pray you would bless our brother Andrew
[2:41:59] and each one as we go from this place,
[2:42:01] Lord. And we give you the glory for all
[2:42:03] you do. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:42:07] Amen. You're worthy of it all. Thank
[2:42:11] you,
[2:42:13] Lord. Yes, you're worthy of it
[2:42:20] all. For from you are all
[2:42:23] things. To you are all
[2:42:27] things. You deserve the
[2:42:33] glory. You're worthy of it all.

[2:42:50] things. To you are all
[2:42:54] things you deserve. God bless you this
[2:42:57] morning as you
[2:43:00] go. You're worthy of it all.
[2:43:06] Yes, you are worthy of it
[2:43:10] [Music]
[2:43:13] all. For from you are all
[2:43:16] things. To you are all
[2:43:20] things. You deserve the
[2:43:25] glory. Yes, Lord. You're worthy of it
[2:43:29] all.
[2:43:32] All you're worthy of it
[2:43:36] all, my
[2:43:39] Jesus, from you are all
[2:43:42] things. To you are all
[2:43:46] things. You deserve the glory.
[2:43:53] My God is
[2:43:56] awome. He can move a mountain.
[2:44:00] be in the
[2:44:03] valley. I make the
[2:44:06] rain. My God is
[2:44:10] awesome. When I'm
[2:44:13] broken, strength when I've been
[2:44:16] weakened, forever he will
[2:44:20] reign. My God is
[2:44:24] awome. He is
[2:44:28] awome.

[2:44:51] awome and
[2:44:53] forgiving. His grace while I'm living. I
[2:44:58] praise your holy
[2:45:00] name. My God is
[2:45:04] awesome. Yes, he is
[2:45:07] awesome. He is
[2:45:11] awome. He is
[2:45:13] awesome. My God is
[2:45:16] awesome. He can move a
[2:45:19] mountain, keep me in the
[2:45:23] valley, happy from the rain.
[2:45:27] My God is
[2:45:29] awesome. Heals me when I'm
[2:45:32] broken. Strength when I've been
[2:45:35] weakened. Wherever He will
[2:45:39] reign. My God is
[2:45:43] awome. He is
[2:45:46] awome. He is awome.
[2:45:50] He is on.
