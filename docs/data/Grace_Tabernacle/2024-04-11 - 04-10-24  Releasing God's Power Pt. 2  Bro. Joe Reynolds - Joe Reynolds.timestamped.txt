[46:16] this Christ in the true church is a
[46:22] continuation of the book of Acts in
[46:25] other words a Church moving by the power
[46:28] of
[46:29] God he said the Book of Revelation shows
[46:33] how the Antichrist Spirit would come in
[46:35] the church defiling it making it look
[46:38] warm formal and Powerless it exposes
[46:42] Satan revealing his works and attempted
[46:47] destruction of God's people and
[46:48] discrediting of God's word right down to
[46:51] the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire
[46:54] he fights that hell can't stand that
[46:57] hell fights that he cannot stand it he
[47:00] knows that if the people get the true
[47:03] revelation of the CH true church and
[47:06] what she
[47:08] is Catch it now not what brother Brandon
[47:12] was not what what your pasture is not
[47:15] what not what another age gone by amen
[47:19] but he brings it on down when you
[47:21] recognize a the true church and a true
[47:25] revelation of a true church and what she
[47:28] is and what she stands for she you can
[47:32] do the Greater Works she can you say she
[47:37] with me tonight will be an invincible
[47:41] Army if they get a true revelation of
[47:45] the two Spirits within the framework of
[47:47] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[47:50] discern and with understand that
[47:51] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[47:55] powerless before
[47:58] come on somebody before
[48:03] her he will be the uh uh the definitely
[48:08] uh I don't know how to pronounce that
[48:10] word tweeted is that how did you say
[48:12] that brother Mark you history major
[48:15] there today is when Christ with stood
[48:18] every effort to gain power over him in
[48:20] the desert did you catch that when
[48:23] Christ withstood every effort everything
[48:26] Satan threw at him everything every
[48:29] trick of the enemy every desires of Hell
[48:33] s uh Jesus Christ and withstand every
[48:36] one of
[48:38] them and Satan hates Revelation but we

[49:29] is within us and he places his name upon
[49:34] his little bride and she that's no
[49:37] reason brother Brown would say she is
[49:39] the final voice to the final age
[49:42] underneath her her messenger brother BR
[49:45] would also say there is one miss Jesus

[1:28:43] complainers begin to see a mighty hand a
[1:28:46] pillar of fire a cloud came down and
[1:28:51] severed between them and the enemy amen
[1:28:54] and all night long kept the enemy at
[1:28:58] Bay and about I about about the morning
[1:29:01] time I could imagine there came a great
[1:29:03] eastern wind of Yahweh out of the
[1:29:06] heavens came down sweeping down and the
[1:29:08] and and blew back the Red
[1:29:12] Sea dried up the ground and he says come
[1:29:16] and go with me Cody come and go with me
[1:29:18] let's walk across on dry ground and the
[1:29:21] enemy kept the en the god kept the enemy
[1:29:24] behind them by the power of Almighty
[1:29:27] hand the hand of almighty God the pillar
[1:29:30] of fire kept the enemy as a children of
[1:29:32] God walked across on dry ground amen
[1:29:35] what a Victorious thing it was when they
[1:29:37] got to the other side and about the time
[1:29:39] maybe the last one begin to LEAP up on
[1:29:41] the the banks of the uh the Red
[1:29:46] Sea the pillar fire moved up and the
[1:29:50] enemy said here's our opportunity and
[1:29:53] they took off but brother Brown said
[1:29:56] amen that path wasn't made for
[1:30:00] unbelievers Hallelujah that path wasn't
[1:30:03] predestinated for the enemy it was
[1:30:05] predestinated for Cody and Joe and
[1:30:07] myself and whoever else would walk on
[1:30:09] God's provided place of worship and they
[1:30:12] got on the other side and they grabbed a
[1:30:14] tamarine and they begin to praise their
[1:30:16] God and their God looked down through
[1:30:19] the pill of fire and with Angry
[1:30:22] Eyes
[1:30:25] and all of a sudden this is me I can

[1:30:29] water begin to Triple out and the and
[1:30:32] the mud of the dirt begin to get
[1:30:36] wet and they begin to run the wagons
[1:30:39] into the dirt and God took off their
[1:30:41] Wagon Wheels and had the enemy right
