that you do for us Lord we'll be careful to give you the glory for all you do in Jesus name amen amen may God bless you this morning morning we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of Matthew the 4th chapter and from the 13th verse and we'll give you just a moment to turn there Matthew the 4th chapter 13th verse and I just want to uh make a quick announcement as you're turning brother uh Andrew I announced there a couple weeks ago or a week or so ago uh that they were trying to get everything moved uh in October about or Middle October sometime be a few weeks um but they had a little bit of uh change of plans and a Time window that they could so uh they'll they'll be here Tuesday instead so he has a a U-Haul truck and loaded down and so they're going to be here Tuesday so if anybody would like to help get with me we certainly try to help them get moved in and so um just excited about our friends being able to come and spend the time serving the lord with us amen so we want to read from Matthew the 4th chapter and the 13th verse and we'll read down through the 17th verse the Bible says and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and neth Alum that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Zebulon and the land of nephalem by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death light is sprung up or light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand I also want to read from Matthew the 6th chapter and the 33rd verse give you a moment and then the Bible says but seek ye first the kingdom of God for and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and as you take your seat this morning I'd like to speak on this subject of an established Kingdom seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you last Sunday uh we were speaking on an everlasting Kingdom when we had started uh into this uh subject and and we realized that this was a promise that Jesus had made of an oncoming Kingdom and one day that that Kingdom would come and uh that we would see that that great physical Kingdom that Jesus was speaking of and uh John actually wrote about it in Revelations the 21st chapter he said I saw remember in John's Vision he said I saw uh the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God and God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and shall be no more death no more sorrow no more crying neither there shall be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these things are true and faithful so here John writes of this coming Kingdom of this great physical Kingdom and and when he writes of it he's writing after the first Heaven and the first Earth has passed away now we realize that brother B would show us that there would be a time when there was no more sea and so the first Heaven would pass away which what was the first Heavens the first Heavens was the millennium he said it would pass away and then the first Earth which is the earth that we live on it would pass away and and and when it would be gone it would be renovated it would be baptized like it was baptized in the days of Noah and he preached and it was Sanctified by Christ and he sprinkled his blood upon it and it was renovated and and but this time it would come and it would take all of the germs and everything off of it and the renovation at the end time would be a fire baptism that would kill every germ every sickness every disease every filth that was ever upon the Earth it would be destroyed off of the face of the Earth brother Mark that within there would come a new kingdom remember when John wrote about it here would come a city that would come and sit down upon this Earth it would be a great City it would be500 square miles and it would rest upon the Earth this is a literal City this isn't something uh spiritual that isn't something that's Supernatural it's a literal City that God the Creator would set up on the earth you say well how would he do it well the same thing he done this one it's the same God that created the first Earth is the same God God that would clean it over and the same God that would establish it again that great Creator God that made the stars and he made the Sun and he made the moon but this time brother Wesley he's creating a city and in that City would have streets of gold and and the great the great Jasper and all the the great colors and precious stones and the great Gates all of it is created by God this is a literal and a physical place and and and you know you know it doesn't it doesn't matter what takes place in this world I can sit here with a body of Believers and say but I'm Bound for that City how many say that this morning I'm Bound for that City so then but said so then what else matters what what what what does everything else matter anyway because we're Bound for the city he says so if the sun don't shine today well it don't matter cuz I'm Bound for the city If Tomorrow Never Comes well it don't matter cuz I'm Bound for the city because see what difference does it make we have a home a resting place whether you're tired or not tired or whether we we still have a resting place you know people would look at it and they say well brother may that's an old man's dream that's what old people talk about when they ain't got nothing no other promise and they it looks like they're going to face death that's an old man's dream but friend this isn't an old man's dream this is a Bible truth that there's a city a new Heaven and a new Earth that'll come down and the saints of God will dwell in that City how many say Amen to that I I believe that's why Jesus when he talks about this Kingdom he tells us the way to enter into that Kingdom he said I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me how many believe that Matthew 16 Jesus tells the disciples this way he said If any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me so whosoever would save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profit if he would gain the whole world and lose his own soul but what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his work see he's talking about that great physical Kingdom the son of man will come in the glory of the father and with his angels and in that Kingdom every man would be would be rewarded for his works it was a it was a physical Kingdom but then Jesus would go on to say he said but there is some that are standing here that will not taste death he said until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom so see so now he had talked about the physical Kingdom but now he goes on into this spiritual Kingdom see this word Kingdom in this verse of scripture it come from the Greek the Greek word Balia which meant a kingdom or a sovereignty or a royal power so in other words you could say it like this they would not taste death until they seen the son of man coming in his power so so today in this spiritual Kingdom brother Mark is a kingdom of great power that's what took place in the upper room when they were in there and they were praying and waiting upon the Lord to come remember what he had told them he said you would receive power whenever whenever the Holy Ghost would come upon you so they were waiting on the coming of the Holy Ghost they were waiting on the coming of the power of God and so so when that power came when the Holy Ghost came now the kingdom came when it came it w it came in power so the very power that they had was a was a uh it was the presence of the kingdom of God upon the Earth so so this Kingdom brother Mark here Jesus would show it it would come in a physical form but also before then it would come in a spiritual form so so here we see if a kingdom is going to come spiritually then there has to be a spiritual way to get into it so Jesus would would show us there's a way in order to get into this Kingdom to be a part of the Kingdom see that's why when somebody ask you and say well what denomination do you belong to you say well I don't belong to any denomination well what do you belong to well you can just say it like this I belong to a kingdom how many you ever been asked that question what kind of church do you go to who are you what kind of people are you anyway well the answer is I belong to a kingdom and I you say a kingdom yeah well how do you get into that Kingdom I can tell you what Paul said he said by one spirit we are baptized into one body but said so you can say it like this by one Spirit we're baptized into one kingdom here we are we've been baptized by the spirit of God into the kingdom of God and friends you you can say it like this if that kingdom was in the earth see that there are many that are looking they're trying to find a way to get into this they're trying to they're searching they're seeking after the kingdom of God they're searching for an entrance into the kingdom of God they're searching for for power another there's Nations that are searching for a way to have the upper hand on another Nation but but but but we're looking for this great Kingdom of power it's been sought after since the time that that it was spoke of in the scripture and you know I thought about how that it's such a real thing remember when Abraham was called by God and he told him he said you're going to go into a land it'll be a Strange Land you're going to go into a place and and it'll be a place of inheritance and you're going to be able to receive it and Abraham when he went out seeking this place that God had promised to him the Bible says he went into a strange country sister Joy he went into a strange country and he was searching and and trying to find the place that God had called him to and it was so real to him even though that God had called him there was nothing physical out there brother Mark there wasn't a foundation there wasn't there wasn't a gate there wasn't a great wall there was there was no great there was no great entrance there was no sign out there that would say this is the place of the kingdom of God but he walked out into a strange country and the Bible said he walked by faith and listen what Paul said he said he looked for a city that had foundations whose Builder and maker was God he believed in the promise of God so much brother Mark that he was seeking a city that had a literal Foundation see it wasn't something that was just some myth unto him but the promise of God was real to him and the promise it was so real that he went into a strange country looking for something that had a foundation he was looking for something that had a wall he was looking for something that wasn't built by the hands of men but it was built by the hands of God I thought my if that would do that way with Abraham in the natural what all what ought it to do to us in the spiritual for we have came out of this world and been called by God into this spiritual Place we've been called brother Mark out of the out of what the world calls normal and out of what the church World calls normal and sometimes it may be a strange place but here we've came into a strange country and and into things that we didn't even understand but God had led us by faith into this land looking for a city brother Mark a literal place that God could come and dwell in the hearts of believers let me tell you what Jesus said when he talked about this Kingdom he began to speak about it there was those that believed him and there was those that mocked him and those that made fun of it you know that there was those say well I can't see anything so why would I believe anything like that but Jesus listen even when he would talk about it that the Pharisees would ask like this they said well when will the kingdom of God come here he is talking about the coming of a kingdom they said when should the kingdom of God come and Jesus said he said the kingdom of God don't come with observation so neither can you say here it is or there it is for behold the kingdom of God is within you brother manam says see so here we are we are his kingdom people that are professing that this world is not our home I wonder how many of those are here this morning we're the kingdom people that are professing that this world is not our home and we're looking for the coming of the king to set up his kingdom oh I don't know about you but that's what we're doing this morning I'm looking for the King of Kings to come and establish that great king Kingdom upon this Earth I don't know about you but I plan to be there that day whenever the king of glory comes in when the when that great Kingdom that physical kingdom is established upon this Earth it ain't a myth it's not just some fairy tale it ain't something just to make you feel good when you're at an old age and looking to passing over but it's the truth that come out of God's word the same God that created this world is the same God that said there'll be a new Heaven and a new Earth and upon that Earth shall come this great City and the Believers the Saints will inhabit the city thereof so today here we are that Heavenly Kingdom brother Wesley even though it would come in the physical but today that Heavenly kingdom is dwelling in the heart of every believer and when we look around I see representatives of that Kingdom we're ambassadors of the kingdom of God well and I got news for you not only am an ambassador of the kingdom of God brother Wesley but I'm not here to visit I'm not here as a part-timer I'm not in this Kingdom as just somebody that's coming as a tourist but I've tooken up permanent residence in the kingdom of God I I made it my permanent home in other words I have a lifetime membership to the kingdom of God and there ain't nothing the devil can do to take me away from it I think what a powerful thought this is this morning when you look around look around this building if you could see past the walls in this building and you could see past the flaws and the and the in the in the construction failures and the in the Leaky Roof and the stains on the carpet and and you can look past all of that and you can look through the eyes of Faith you would recognize that we are in the presence of a Heavenly Kingdom see when you look around this morning all you see is the natural you see the same piano you see the same building you see the same people but if you could ever look through the eyes of Faith you would realize that we're not just sitting in a building to be sitting in a building we're not just setting in the middle of these four walls but we're sitting in the presence of a Heavenly Kingdom and here in this Kingdom brother Mark that's why whenever you start to pray and you start to sing songs that the atmosphere begins to change in the room you say what is it atmosphere that is changing is the influence of another kingdom how many have you ever felt bad and you get to pray and all of a sudden the atmosphere begins to change or or you start singing a song and you know you're kind of down in the dumps and driving down the road and you start singing a song and all of a sudden the atmosphere in the car begins to change and you start weeping or maybe with joy and you clap your hands what's happening it's the influence of another kingdom oh don't you see it it's the presence of another kingdom this is what God is calling us into to get our minds and our our hearts out of this world and enter into this place that God can have communion with you oh let me tell you friends there's room at the table this morning the doors are open this morning to a Heavenly Kingdom a spiritual Kingdom to call a people out of this natural realm oh if I could this morning I would take your eyes and your mind away from the natural things if I could I'd bring you to another plane that you could see past the things of the natural and see past the flaws and past the failures into this heavenly Kingdom oh friends if you could look at the at at the building that way and you could look at the world that way then how ought we ought to look at one another we could look at each other but a mark and we could see past the flaws of a man and I I could see past the mistakes of a man and the stains that are upon a person's life and realize that that in order to see spiritual things that you have to look past natural things and it ain't just in the building but but it's the same way with every one of us if you could look through a spiritual eye and pass that veil of Flesh you would see that your sitting today among royalty the Bride of Jesus Christ the people that are called by God brother the Travis it ain't just some ordinary person the lady sitting by you she's not just another lady off the street the man sitting by you he's not just another man in this world but these are those that were called of God these are the purchase of the possession of the blood of Jesus Christ oh how that ought to make us feel it's the ones that he went up calvary's cross and gave his own blood for he shed his blood for him oh my I thank God this morning if we could look past the veil of Flesh and see one another it's the Bride of Jesus Christ oh can't you see it we're sitting among royalty you say but M what are you trying to do I'm trying to get our minds out of this world just for a few minutes and to recognize the presence of the kingdom of God that is Among Us and the people that you're sitting next to the Bride of Jesus Christ the purchased of God not only are we in the presence of one another brother Wesley but we're in the presence of the king of kings you see what it does it calls our attention that we don't just come here it Ain it ain't just a social a social Gathering but we come to have communion with the King of Kings we come to get ourselves out of you realize what a what it takes brother Andrew was preaching the other day he said the kingdom has to be preached and then it has to be pressed into so in other words there's somebody that'll come and preach it and somebody that'll press into it you know what it means to press to press means to apply pressure or to push against something so if the Bible says that we have to press into it Brother David you know what that means with the law of physics the law of physics tells us that we can't even use the word press unless there's some other force that we're pressing against it wouldn't even be the word press unless there was a force or a resistance or something that you could press against you realize that's what we're doing today is we're pressing against an unseen force and that Force wants to keep you out of the kingdom of God it wants to keep you out of the atmosphere where God can move it wants to keep you out of the atmosphere of the supernatural where where God where the where the the power of the Holy Ghost can come into a building again and miracles take place and Supernatural things happen and people give their heart to God and God discerns the the hearts of of people and helps them and corrects them and and and grows them and that that that enemy that great pressure in this age is keeping you out of that atmosphere so brother Andrew preached that message so we're pressing against an unseen Force cuz it wants to keep us out of the Kingdom wants to keep you from having having Liberty it wants to keep you from from being able to speak your heart and speak the truth of the word it wants to keep you from praying hello somebody am I the only one in here it wants to keep you from shouting it wants to keep you from clapping don't let me offend you I'm just preaching the gospel it wants to keep you from clapping it wants to keep you from saying amen it wants to keep your mind on the things of the world and away from the things of God it's a force that is pressing on you to keep you from receiving something from God well but friends the Bible said but there is a people that can press through there's a people that'll press through it don't matter what the Devil Comes or how hard that he comes but I thank God that there's somebody there's a body of Believers this morning that didn't stay up partying too late last night but they come to the house of God to press through the pressures of the enemy into the atmosphere of the kingdom of God why are we pressing through butar because we want to be in the presence of the king why are we why are we pressing through we want to see him we want to be in his midst and be in his presence this morning amen think about that brother Brown tells the story of of when he went up to Canada and brother bter was there remember they went to see the King George when he came through Vancouver but bter said when I went the king came by he said he was here he was telling me when the king came down the street he said he was such a gallant man that brother Baxter went over and he began to cry and weep whenever the king and and the queen came by this great Entourage he said all the Canadians was gathered there and had their Flags out waving and brother Baxter went over the side he said he was just weeping when with all his heart and he asked him he said well why was you crying he said well well I couldn't help it he said because I know all the pain and things that he's going through and here the King was was sick in his body had multiple therosis had stomach trouble and here why he was going through that great pain but but he still yet went through the parade and he waved at everybody and he and he and he greeted everybody and he said see whenever he came by he said I couldn't do nothing but weep but B said well why was you weeping he said because our King was passing by see and when he passed by it represented the freedom of our country it represented the liberty of our country it was it was the one it was the monarchy that defended our way of life said so there was some in in their heart they were they they love the the the monarchy that had came by he said I thought my he said that may be that way that when the when the king came by and those beautiful people and subjects and how they wept just because he was passing by but I thought if it would make a Canadian Weep For Joy when the king rode by then what will it be when King Jesus comes by the king of Heaven and the king of Earth friends we're looking to see the King of Kings when we come in the house of God you don't come to see me God forbid but come to see the King of Kings come to see King Jesus brother Mar to make an atmosphere that the king could come by to enter into this place he say see we want to see the king but that ain't all Brother David not only do we want to see the king but remember there was a little girl that was there crying at at the end of the the parade and the teachers went into class and they came back and and and how this little girl she she was she was missing and so they went out looking for her and they found her out there had her little Canadian flag or her British flag and so they went out and and and they they told her you got to come back in and she was just crying said well what's the matter with you honey didn't you didn't you get to stand out there with all the other kids she said yeah I did she said well didn't you get to raise your flag like everybody else she said yeah I raised my flag and you know see that flag it was a display of loyalty she said yeah I got to raise my flag like everybody else she said well didn't you didn't you see the King she said yeah I saw him she said well then why are you crying she said it wasn't that I didn't get to see the king she said I saw the king but I'm so little I don't think the king saw me but said isn't that that way he said but that may be that way with the natural King but with King Jesus it's never that way he said see it no matter how little you are or what little you do he records everything you do he knows all about you whether you're big or whether you're little he knows all about it it's recorded in his book oh don't you realize friends that King Jesus sees you it don't matter how he sees every wave that that sign of loyalty when you wave your hand he sees every wave every time you raise your hand you say Lord I love you he sees every wave he sees every flag every Banner that's lifted King Jesus sees it he hears every voice that cries out Glory unto his name he hears every Hallelujah he hears every amen there ain't nothing little that you can do that King Jesus don't see so we lift our hearts this morning we lift our voices we lift our our Banner we raise our flag in loyalty to King Jesus how many how many can do that this morning and say Lord I just want to lift my my flag to you Lord I want to let you know I'm loyal I ain't loyal to a man I'm not loyal to a church but I'm loyal to King Jesus I'm not loyal to the devil don't you realize that you oh you say well well Satan wants to do everything he can to keep your hand down but I thank God there's somebody that'll press past our own thoughts this morning and say Lord but I'm loyal to you this morning I want to display my loyalty to King Jesus oh my you don't feel like you don't feel like a good subject sometimes to be a part of this great Kingdom sometimes we feel like we're the least in the kingdom of God you know sometimes you say well I ain't the best best preacher and I ain't the best singer I'm not I'm not the best one see but you realize that because we feel that way you realize that the greatness in the kingdom of God is not measured the way it is in the Kingdom of the world can I just take a minute on this to be great in the kingdom of God don't mean the the same thing as it does to be great in the Kingdom of the world see it's actually it's actually backwards it's different than the worldly Kingdom see the the great ones in this earth they're noted for exalting themselves and exercising their power and dominion and their strength and mind that's what makes a a great one in other words they they exercise dominion over those that they have control over so see that's the the greatness in the Kingdom of the world remember remember in the Bible that that James and John the the sons of Zebedee that came and their mother to Jesus and said granted that we would sit one on thy right hand and one on the other on their left hand when we get into glory and Jesus said you know not what you ask he said see you shall indeed drink of the cup I drink of and with baptism that I am baptized you shall be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them of whom it is prepared so notice what Jesus does is he shows us after this he starts showing the kingdoms of the world and how the kingdom of the world is he said see they which are accounted to rule over the G Gentiles they exercise their lordship over them and their great ones exercise their Authority on them but it shall not be so she he says so shall it not be among you for whosoever will be great among you will be your minister or your servant he said in other words see so whoever whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be the servant of all so in order to be great in the kingdom of God requires that you be a servant one to another listen what Jesus I'm just telling you what Jesus said he said see and the son of man came not to be ministered or not to be served unto but to serve another he said he gave his life and a ransom for many Mark the 10th chapter he said see even as the son of man he came not to have services rendered unto him but he came that he might serve and give his life as a ransom or instead of many so see in the Heavenly Kingdom brother wesle the life in the kingdom of God it don't operate the way the world it's the opposite of the kingdom of the world so it don't so it's not it's not uh uh it's it's more obvious then in the matters of power and Leadership see Jesus said those who want to be great in God's kingdom May achieve that but not by the world's methods so if you want to be great in the kingdom of God you wanton you're going to have to redefine what greatness is so you can achieve greatness but only by defining greatness the way Jesus does and that's by serving others and not yourself so see being a servant to one another makes you great in the kingdom of God so even when you don't feel great and you feel little and you say brother you know I I don't do a whole lot and there ain't a lot ask to me but the great ones in the kingdom of God are not are not those that that do so much or establish themselves so much but it's those that are willing to serve others isn't that a good principle this morning to find our our place in God's Kingdom so see but with this Kingdom let me get back to my message with this kingdom comes a great power and an authority but the W you see you see we're the heart of a true servant we possess the power of God by the Holy Ghost remember that's what came in the book of Acts this is how Paul wrote it he said he has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin over the world over the Flesh and the devil Church age book showing forth his praise and glory and showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure so what we are doing brother Mark by the power of the Holy Ghost or the or the kingdom of God being in US is we're demonstrating that we're no longer under the Dominion of Satan you say well how do I demonstrate it well let me tell you what I saw even in this assembly brother Wesley I saw that Kingdom power demonstrated I saw Kingdom power demonstrated with the laying on the hands of the sick and they recovered I saw people come up for prayer and that Kingdom power demonstrated whenever they were in having dizzy spells and God took it and brought them back to where the dizziness was gone I I saw Kingdom power when people come up with back trouble and that Kingdom power it took the it took back trouble away from them and it caused them to be able to walk it walk up right I saw that Kingdom power take a body that had no pulse and put breath back in his life I saw that Kingdom power give somebody strength to walk when they didn't have the ability to walk I saw Kingdom power take blinded eyes and open them and give somebody sight again I saw Kingdom power discern somebody's spirit and tell them the things that was wrong with them and what God could do to bring them out of it but let me tell you my favorite brother Markus I saw Kingdom power that would give unbelievers the power to believe God I saw King om power caused unbelievers to take God at his word and no longer be an unbelief but they came and became a believer of the word word of God don't you realize friends that we're living in an age of unbelief we're living in this great age Paul said he said in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not we're living in an age of unbelief but what it takes is it takes a kingdom power to come and take you out of this Spirit of unbelief and bring you into a place of faith into this heavenly atmosphere that you can believe in the things of God again that you can believe in the Supernatural friends I know what the devil's trying to do today he's trying to take the supernatural out of the church he's trying to take the holy ghost out of the church he's trying to take the move of God out of the church but I thank God that there's still somebody as long as I have a voice to say that the kingdom of God is still here and the kingdom of God has still got the same power that it's always done and if you want to see God move then come out of the kingdom of the world and get into the kingdom of God and see the supernatural see the hand of God in your life get out of the atmosphere of the world and get into the atmosphere of God and allow God to have dominion over your life instead of letting the devil rule you oh god listen friends stop letting the devil rule you and Rule you and beat you down with cigarettes and beat you down with alcohol and beat you down with with drugs and and pot and all these things that Satan brings on PE you're living under the Dominion of Satan but I thank God that he's given us a way a way out a door an entrance into another kingdom that you can look down at the Devil and say devil you have no power over me any longer I saw Kingdom power yes sir come on take people out of unbelief and make a Believer out of them I saw a woman one time when I was preaching in India and I was preaching on doubt being an enemy of God and I was telling the testimony of how God healed my arm when I was a little boy and I told to how that I that I always remember rubbing the dirt off my broke arm that was that was that was the bone was sticking out out of and I remember wiping the dirt off of it and I was telling that testimony and while I was telling it there was a woman sitting in the back of the room that for 6 years hadn't been able to walk and we're in the middle of the preaching of the word she literally she took her her little hand and she said well Lord if that would work for him it would work for me and she got up in the middle of that meeting and came walking to the front right in the middle of the preacher like a old scary woman trying to get her strength back in her legs because she couldn't even walk walking in there without somebody carrying her sitting her in the back of the room the old Pastor got to jump it up and down he said brother man don't you see what's going on I said no I thought it was just a spooky or or some Spirit or something I didn't know why she was walking that way he said that woman hadn't walked in six years she's been paralyzed she got hurt in a Rick Shaw accident she came up and gave a testimony she said that that the Lord had told her in a dream six years ago after that she had been in this accident here she was a Hindu woman didn't even know what Christianity was didn't even know who Jesus was but she she had a dream and in the dream a man told her go to the gospel meeting and you'll receive your healing that next week she went to the first thing that was called a gospel meeting there was a Pentecostal church that was having a meeting she went over to it well she went up for prayer and she didn't get healed and so the next time they had a gospel meeting she went to that one and she went up for prayer and she didn't get healed and the next time they had a gospel meeting she went to that one and she went up for prayer and she didn't get healed brother Wesley for six years she went and done the very same thing and that brother said isn't it a miracle that she's able to walk I said said brother that ain't even the miracle the miracle is that for 6 years she never received her healing but she still believed God and for six years she could have those same symptoms but she still believed God the miracle was that she was still sitting in a gospel meeting waiting on God to to to to fulfill his word that's the real Miracle it's the Kingdom power brother Wesley that can take a person out of unbelief and take them into a place of believe it oh don't you see it by believing the word it releases something in you that Satan can't handle here it was a woman that just believed the word of God and by believing the word her faith came to a place in that time of Mercy I can't explain it neither can I explain why Jesus would walk down and all those sick people were laying over by the pool but he went over to where one was and he said can would you be made whole he said I can't be cuz nobody will get out of my way every time I try to go some man gets in the way but J the very healing that he was looking for had came to his doorstep neither can I explain why this God of Mercy would come that way but brother Mark I know it took a person that was an unbeliever and it makes a Believer out of you see it's Kingdom power it's Christ the anointed one coming in his power you realize see believ in the word of God it it brings this power in your life so no wonder Satan wants to make you disbelieve the word no wonder he brings so many attacks on the word and caus you to look at those things and and say well I I don't know if I can I can believe that why because he knows that that that if you ever become a believer that it releases a power in your life so he tries to keep you in unbelief but friends let me tell you this morning when that belief comes then all of a sudden then that same spirit that Christ had it begins to work in your life it has Authority it takes things out that don't belong there it begins to to clean up and you see who was it it was Christ you remember when he came in his Earthly Ministry in his Earthly Ministry they called him what the Messiah remember it was Christ the anointed one which was called the Messiah but said see what is the Messiah he said the Messiah is the kingdom of God it is the anointed ones them Anointed with the same Spirit he was anointed with anointed he said see it was the kingdom of God remember it was the one that they came to when they asked of him and they said can I sit at thy right hand or at thy left and Jesus said can you drink of the cup that I drink can you be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized they said yes he said well you will but the kingdom in other words to sit at my right hand or my left he said the kingdom is not mine to give so this is that's what they were asking for we want the kingdom we want to sit at thy right hand and thy left hand we want to sit on the throne so in other words he's saying the kingdom is not mine to give but said it showed us that we we could drink out of the same cup of persecution you could be called beel whatever it might be you could be baptized with the same Spirit he's baptized with so if he was called the Messiah which he was because he was anointed with the Holy Spirit said then any church that's Anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah a little or smaller God someday when this body is resurrected he said I hope beforehand that God can get a hold of a bunch of people that'll manifest his power in every Dimension that it's supposed to be in he's the Messiah the anointed one you realize what he's trying to get the church to is to become that very same thing the Messiah the anointed one it is the kingdom of God the Bible said you are Kings and Priests a King to deliver and a priest to be able to minister you're a messiah he said and his signs was to follow in all ages reflecting his light and and his presence within his kingdom people oh my don't you see what we are this morning the kingdom people that are gathered in this place brother Mark to receive the power of God a so here we are a kingdom people with Kingdom power a very quiet Kingdom people with a very powerful Kingdom power we're a kingdom people with a kingdom power but the W see so we watch the watch what God done in this age if you look at the ages of the kingdom of men you realized that men came to this place where this great Kingdom of or this Kingdom of power had came to where it didn't seem to have much power at all it had came down it had been reduced down the kingdom of God this great Kingdom of power had been reduced down to manmade religion it had been reduced down to denominations to where the church had no power it was a very fulfillment of what Paul said it would be he said they' have in the last days a form of godliness but deny the power thereof so it had been this great Kingdom of power had been reduced down to this this just ritualistic church and and and going to these services and all and and just to just to maybe have brother said one time maybe have an anointed preacher and a couple of people that might get a little bit with him he said but but but there just no move of God because the people have so much pressure on this age to keep them from getting into that atmosphere said but here we are in this age but we're still preaching it and we're still we're still pressing why because it's a it's a returning of the power of the kingdom of God so what the the Bible also says that it would come to this place that this Kingdom power it'd be reduced down to that but the Bible said that also in the last agage that the seventh angel would appear with a Ministry and that Ministry would declare remember what the Declaration of the seventh angel was in the revelations it said it would declare the ending of the kingdom of man and the restoring of the kingdom of God and so you say well how would he do it he would do it by the restoration of the word in the slides didn't didn't work he said by the restoration of the word in the hearts of the Believers so so see here it's a it's a declaring of the ending of the kingdom of man and the restoring of the kingdom of God so it would be restored in the hearts of the Believers that's where this Kingdom would be restored so the power of the Kingdom it's going to be restored in the hearts and now he said see so Kingdom this Kingdom would be established by the revealing of the word of God and then God would take his word that was written and in the end time for the W that he would reveal it to men so this is what the revelation of the word of God was to do the Revelation would restore the power power of God in the hearts or in the in the hearts and the mouths of the Believers it would in other words it would restore the Believers back to their position so this is the purpose of God is to bring this Kingdom back to the Earth it was a in in the seventh age when the kingdom looked like it had lost power but there would come a restoration of the kingdom it would come it would come with the power of the same power of Jesus's Earthly Ministry it was the same works and the same power what was it to do it was to restore the kingdom back in the hearts of Believers again that they would that they would be able to to be in the position that God had called them I thought my a't that something he's restoring us back to our position this is the purpose of the restoration of Kingdom power I don't know if you ever played chess but you realize when you're playing the game of chess you can make one wrong move and it will take you out of position and you can hardly ever get it back you one one wrong move and now you get out of position you'll wind up in Checkmate because you can't defend your position because because you you've made a move or made a mistake I thought you know you know that's the way it is see whenever you get out of position you lose leverage on the enemy and so if you move out of position now you you've lost your leverage that's why when you go into battle in military they want the higher ground because the higher ground is a better position it gives you leverage against the enemy so see what Satan has done Through the Ages is he's he's came to take the church out of her position he's came see he's came to pull you out of this place but do you realize that the body of Christ has been given position over the devil how many knows what it was he said the devil has position under the feet of the Bride so you've given a position so you know what Satan wants you to do that's why he put so much pressure on you to lay down and to give up and to Destro your hands see because when you're laying down then you're out of your position see because Satan is supposed to be under your feet so whenever you're laying down he's not in his position and neither are you no wonder he wants you laid down and giving up or sitting down on the job but friend but I thank God that the Holy Ghost can come today and he can bring a person and establish them back on their feet where they belong that you don't have to lay down in a gutter and let the devil run over your life and wreck your life but he give you the authority that the power of the kingdom of God can establish you in God's kingdom in the position you're supposed to be in and put the devil back in his place see that's what this message done brother Mark it called the church back to her position as the Bride of Jesus Christ brother said God may we tonight take our stand may we take our position in Christ like men and women of God Sons and Daughters of the Creator who just spoke and the world came into existence we call ourselves Christians but we can't even believe for a little healing what you've promised to give us God forgive us of our stupidity may we rise tonight like real men and real women and real sons and real daughters of God and go forth in the earth conducting ourselves in like manner see it's a call to position you see what this message was doing it's a call to position there's so many that's out of cater there's so many that are out of their position but here what the message is doing this morning it's calling you to your position you say my position in what in the Kingdom of God in in to where you would have the Kingdom power brother Mark don't you realize that God don't want you to be powerless he wants you to possess the power of the Kingdom that you would be able to speak and the devil would have to take his lead it's a call to position he said that's a way we all made up differently we have different positions he said but we just need to find our position in Christ Christ and abide there and serve him in another place if we can find our position that's why that's why Joshua and Caleb when they went down and they were going into the promised land that none of the other spies could believe that they could take the land because there was Giants in the land but Joshua and Caleb were those that took position on the word of God see whenever the others they were taking position as little guys in a little army but they weren't taking position upon the Flesh and their position wasn't on what it looked like around them or what abilities that they had but they stood on the position of God's word has given us an authority to take the land so Satan is trying to take the church out of position but God sent a word brother Mar to restore you back to your position that where you could have the kingdom of power in your life again so you say well see see what happens watch our relationship with Christ now I'm going to hurry I'm won't hold you long but watch our relationship with Christ Christ his position is where in the heart of the believer your position is in the word which is Christ that's why Jesus could say I am in you and you are in me they're in me and I in them who all those that believe what they're preaching they're in me and I am in them see because Christ is in in you he's taken his position you take your position upon the word of God which is Christ now you're in him you see now Satan has no room you're in your position see notice what Satan wants to do he wants to take you out brother Mark take you out your position you notice he this is what he tried to do with Jesus and that's what he wants to do with you the Book of Matthew tells the story remember first in the third chapter John the Baptist preaches and in in his preaching he says repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand then Jesus comes in Matthew the 4th chapter and watch what his message it was the same message he says when Jesus began to preach Matthew 4:17 repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand but before Jesus begins preaching this notice see here John the Baptist had Pro side what the message would be and now Jesus would come to manifest that and preach that message but before he ever got into his position watch what Satan done see before Jesus said repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Matthew 4 and8 the Bible says the devil took him upon an exceeding and high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them remember what he told him he said if you'll Bow Down and Worship me I'll give you all this if you'll Bow Down and Worship me you notice what he was doing he was trying to take him out of out of his position right but you know what Jesus done here Satan would offer him here this great world he took him into this great place you know you may go up on that high mountain and it may look like a good position here look what Satan was offering what a great position he was offering here are the kingdoms of the world and if you'll Bow Down and Worship me I'll give them unto you what an offer he was trying to give him a great position but Jesus said but there's another position that I've been called to and notice what he said you can offer what you want you can but see he said I wouldn't fall for it he said but notice Jesus when he turned back him what did he say anybody remember what he said he said get thee hints you know what that word hint means it means removed from a place or a time in other words Satan you go from present tense to past tense as quickly as possible get behind me devil in other words get lost here I'm trying to offer you a position let let me establish you in this great position in the Kingdom of the world but he said get lost God's already given me a position I've been called to something greater I'm not going to ENT aain you there ain't nothing that you have to offer offer that I'm going to accept but I've been called of God to do something greater I been I wonder how many could look at that same devil when he offers you a position in the Kingdom of the world and say Satan I won't be in that place you ain't going to find me in no wh house somewhere you ain't going to find me in a drug house somewhere you ain't going to find me down there partying you ain't going to find me in that kind of field but I pray to God that you'll find me in the house of God in the position of a believer of a son and daughter of God I've been called to a higher position Satan's trying to take us bring you to another position but I ain't going to entertain him see what the gospel came to do brother Mark it called to establish you in your position listen what Paul said he said refuse see that you refuse not him that speaketh for they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not escape from him that speaketh from heaven for whose voice shook the Earth but now he has promised saying once more for I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made and those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire said if God judged them when he spoke on Earth and they didn't Escape judgment how much about how much more will we not Escape judgment when he speaks from heaven but notice he said I I will shake the heavens and I will shake the Earth is't it something that that the bride she was shaken but not moved see the purpose to shake is to take all things and to and and and to vigorously uh to vigorously move them in a way that they would become loose so here the gospel would come in its power brother Wesley what would it do it would Shake everything that don't belong it would shake it off it would it would shake the things of the world it would shake them off of you that where they they would have no place anything that didn't belong there it would be shaken loose say see so so it came you notice there's so many I can't just preach to you a minute there's so many that have been shook up there's so much that have been shaken you realize to be shaken it means to have one's composure or confidence upset and shock to be shocked or to be disturbed said see so things will happen in our life God will allow things to happen in order to shake and lose confidence things that people say or do it'll it'll it'll have our our our compo our composure upset but you realize but the word move it don't mean what shape means move means to change your position say see so God will allow things to come into your life that will shake you but but you can't be moved it will allow that things to be shook off of you that don't belong maybe some little Spirit or some feeling or something that was passed down from your father but these things that are all over our life and we'll go through things and say well I wonder why everything's falling apart and I wonder why it ain't like it used to be and I wonder why all you know all these things that happen but God allows things to happen in our life to shake the things off of us that don't belong but it'll never take you out of your position see it can't move you oh I think about I think about David here when he was anointed to be king and I'm going to close with this but he was anointed to be king brother Wesley you realize he was a man of great Authority and here Samuel had came and poured the oil over his head said you you will be a great king over Israel and after he had received this anointing you would have thought that everything would have been perfect from that point on why didn't David go off and riding in a chariot after he was anointed to be the king over Israel but you realize that ain't what his life led him after he was anointed it wasn't very long you find David after after he he he goes and he's he's captured and he's taken to this place of the king of gath that was the member that the he had just destroyed he had killed their leader the the you know the the great Philistines and all all them and Goliath that came from them he said see but they took him to the king of gath you realize they captured David and they took him in there and David got to looking around well how'd I get in this place I I'll never be out of it and he and he pretended to be a Madman went clawing at the walls and foaming at the mouth and all this stuff so the the king said what this man's crazy what there ain't no prestige in having him and so he escaped out of him because he he was pretending to be a mad man so he goes out and he finds himself he he he scours all through the land and David that's anointed to be king finds himself hiding in a cave I don't know if you ever read about it but the cave it was the cave called adalum and in this Cave of adalum the the word adalum it means a refuge or the Justice of the people so here David that was that was called to be the king over Israel because of circumstances in his life brother mariri was hiding out in a cave and David begin to cry out to the Lord and he says Lord he said how long would you forget me how long would you hide your face from me shall my enemy come and destroy me you realize that Wy was hiding in that cave brother Mark that the Bible says that everybody else that was in the condition David was in they found theirself in the same cave there were those that were distressed they made their way to the cave those that were in over their head in debt they made their way to the cave those that were discontented they made their way to the cave and they gathered there with him I thought my no wonder David WR in Psalm 13 how long shall I take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart how long shall my enemy be exalted over me consider and hear me oh my Lord lighten my eyes lest I sleep the death lest my enemy shall say I have prevailed against him and those that trouble me Will Rejoice because I am moved this is that David's prayer God why how long would I lay here until you finally until I moved out of my position until I moved past what you've promised me to be until I'm taken completely out of the way Lord how long will I be here until you'll intervene but in the middle of this listen my enemy Rejoice because I'm moved from my place but listen at David's response he said but I have trusted in thy mercy how'd I get here my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation I don't know why these things are taking place I will sing unto the Lord why is everything in my life falling apart you've dealt bountifully with me Lord you're such a great God Amen everything's ack God how wonderful that you are I can't I can't get out of bed I can't I can't pay my bills oh God what blessings you have bestowed upon me it didn't matter matter the condition that David was in at the end he was praising God he would go on several times psalm 16 you'll find out why because this is the spirit of David he said because I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand and I shall not be moved so it doesn't matter what came my way I know the position that God has called me to and I shall not be moved Psalm 62 he said he's my rock and my salvation he's my defense and I shall not be moved so David gives instruction he says so trust in him at all times you people pour your heart out before him for he's a refuge for us trust not in oppression but become not vain in robbery if riches increase don't set your heart on them for God has spoken once but twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God sir and and to he alone belongeth mercy and thou render us to every man according to his work so no matter what perplexity would come my way I shall not be moved I wonder how many stand to your feet this morning say the Devil he's trying to take you out of your position but say but Satan let me tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to walk right into the position that God has called me to amen I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody remind the devil who you are this morning we're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen look around at somebody and say Miss Jesus isn't it wonderful brother Mark we're we're standing in the presence of this this great royalty this morning in a position that God has called us to I know sometimes we don't feel that way sometimes you feel like you're in the cave I don't know how long David stayed there many days weeks maybe months time for men that would come from all across the country to join him there camped out in a in a cave by the mark that that would be a refuge a place that looked like it was a a place of distress it looked like it was a place of failure you ever been there you ever get so low you to say I failed anybody ever feel that way besides me I failed I'm just not a I'm just not a very good Christian I'm a poor excuse poor excuse for a Son of God I'm a poor excuse for one that would have Kingdom power but here was an anointed king in a cave it looked like a rough place but you realize that even in that place he was right where God wanted him to be isn't it something Brother David I thought it was something here he was complaining about all this he was hiding but in this place that he had ran to it was a place of refuge and all these failures and all this stuff that was going on in his mind but God said but I've called you here you know what it does done it made David closer to God that he would call out to him and say Lord you see my condition my situation and I need your help maybe you find yourself there this morning in a cave of adalum Lord how'd I get to this place I know I was called to be something greater I I was anointed to be a king and a priest you say you was anointed but certainly we were anointed by the word of God you realize that's what when the when the the word of God goes forth and the spirit of God takes his word and pours it out over the body of people that ain't no different than than than Samuel pouring that anointing oil over David's head it's the spirit of God anointing his church you've been anointed to be king anointed to be priest you be say but Lord how'd I get here David said how long shall I stay shall I stay long enough till all of my K my enemies Mock and laugh at me in my condition that I am moved but brother Mark he had a revelation that I shall not be moved don't matter how deep the cave is no matter how dark the corner is you can lift your hand this morning and say but I shall not be moved maybe if somebody would join me say brother mat that's my testimony I don't care about how far gone you were how far you fell we're not here to talk about all the David's failures not here to talk about all the all the wreck wreck of his life and how he wound up in a cave as a Madman but I'm here to talk about his testimony that in the middle of all of that there was something down on the inside of him that could still lift his hand say Lord I recognize my surrounding I've been in a cave but in the cave of adalum I lift my hand and I say I shall not be moved Lord I shall not be moved I recognize God you haven't forsaken me you haven't failed me you've not given up on me I shall not be moved Lord Jesus oh God what a atmosphere in this building this morning God I realize Lord as the pressing Lord that we've done and God the ministering and the pressing and the pulling God to enter into this great atmosphere of the Kingdom of Heaven God we see H Lord that you would Minister to hearts and God I also see that great enemy Lord but it would comat that the Kingdom power as he did with Jesus that day but Lord we realize that your word is greater God that would overcome the the words that the enemy would speak to the hearts of these young people Lord to speak can you imagine oh Satan how he would speak to a young girl and to testify of the Holy Ghost and at the same time that that enemy would speak their heart and say well you're not so sure about that anyway Lord but we recognize it as an enemy we recognize his voice to take us out of our position but God still yet we we stand and we raise our hands this morning and we say I shall not be moved Lord when our bills get so piled up that we aren't able to pay them and looks like the electric might be shut off and may not have enough food to eat but God we stand with our hands raised and we say I shall not be moved oh whenever our loved ones are going away our children won't serve God can we look for an answer God cuz they've fallen so far that we don't have a way to bring them back but we can say I shall not be moved Lord I pray that you would send such a courage Lord as David had that day into the heart of every believer Lord that we may stand in our position as the body of Christ Lord that we could stand upon the word of God what a stout position that we have Lord that the power of the kingdom of God would flow through every one of us Lord I pray Lord that you would Grant it this morning God no matter what we Face Lord tomorrow the next day next week God this great pressure Lord that would come upon us God may we stand with our hands raised say Satan you can come but I shall not be moved Lord we
