location to receive it it's right here in our midst Lord God we give you praise for it tonight Lord I pray that you bless this congregation in Jesus Christ's wonderful name and the bride says amen God bless you it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord once again and if you got your Bibles we invite you to Numbers chapter 33 verse 51 are you happy in the Lord how many Smiles do we have on the face Faces tonight are you happy in the Lord is God doing wonderful things for you amen well amen we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood A peculiar class of people can you say amen amen amen says speak the 51st verse says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan a promised land god doesn't tell them how they was going to be outnumbered or how they was outclassed or beat them up or discourage them he's he's simply telling them when you pass over Jordan death to self into the land of Canaan your promised land that ye can you say ye with me tonight shall drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures destroy all their their M images and qu pluck down all their high places and ye shall just possess to seize or take possession of the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it can you say praise the Lord Lord God bless you you can have your seats tonight he says for I have given you the land to possess it and we've been ministering here the last few times I've been here on on such a prophetic blessing and a and my mind just keeps going back to those things and I keep thinking how that God has blessed us in the hour that we're living in and we are blessed chosen generation can you say Amen listen all that the father has given me shall come what a promise what a a blessing and I thought about this brother Matt tonight or today as I was as was I was in my study and I was meditating on the service tonight and and I was thinking you know this bride this chosen generation this this prophetic blessing has been given to this bride there it is impossible for her to be denied Hallelujah as the Old Testament says amen when the priest high priest would take the sacrifice in to the holies of holies amen that that that they was listening they was listening for the Chimes they was listening to the bells they was listening for some noise Amen to let them know brother Matt that their sacrifice was accepted cuz they knew Brother David if their sacrifice was accepted then the congregation was accepted and what a feeling it must have been amen when that that sacrif rice in the Old Testament was accepted and what about tonight church as our high priest authored up a sacrifice once and for all amen and that sacrifice if it was accepted it means tonight that the congregation has been accepted to and we can tell that lion devil amen that he's defeated tonight Hallelujah because that same promise that our sacrifice once and for all that in that that that that God is such a a prepared God he's always a step ahead of the enemy and he's never can be placed in Checkmate he can never be defeated he can never be conquered he can never be destroyed his word can never come back void amen listen friends it was the conding sending of God that he was going to have a bride in the end time look around you tonight look at your neighbor and said I'm one of them I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ the the very thought that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world and Brother David he was condenscending down from the beginning it was God above us and then 2,000 years ago he become God With Us and now he cond sending down in the gift of the holy spirit that that that sacrifice that's been accepted is now living and ruling and reigning in humanity again I say we can't be defeated they couldn't stop him yesterday sister Joyce they're not going to be able to stop you either don't you love me now the last time we here we went to Genesis and I like to to grab a point from here again tonight Lord's willing and Genesis 45 and 24 talking about uh the wagons of blessings for a moment he said so he sent his brother away and they departed and he said unto them see that you fall not out by the way they went up out of Egypt and came in the land of Canaan unto Jacob the father and they told him saying Joseph is yet alive and he's a governor of all the land of Egypt and Jacob's heart fainted for believed them not and I thought you know as we ministered if you'll just give me some Grace tonight but we as we mentioned last time it was looking to his flesh looking to humanity look at how hey it's the same way tonight amen we look to this flesh we are failures we all fall short we all come up short so many times and we look at our own ability it brings fear and failure and sadness and depression then he goes on he says amen and they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said unto him and when he saw the wagons which Joseph has sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob the father was revived and brother says I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William brandham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy can I have an amen tonight he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get rid of this guy when I going shove him out of the way amen and he says when he does that shoves God right out the picture when I can get rid of him I get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over here and do things that William brandham knows nothing about amen so when he was looking at himself he knew brother Dave there was no way Jacob was well stricken in age there was no way he could make the journey down to Joseph amen he was discouraged but when he began his Focus changed from who he was and his own abilities and seemed there was a greater force there there was a wagons of blessings amen amen and nothing can stop this blessing and Israel said it's enough Joseph my son's yet alive he said I'll go so Israel was carried by the wagons of blessings it was the power of the T that carried Jacob or Israel to his promises and I think praise God Amen that we have a a wagons of blessings right here here amen not just in this Tabernacle but in this Tabernacle tonight greater is he that is in you than the he that's in the world Amen I can't tonight but I serve a God that's more than able to we're failures brother Wesley but God's never failed we come up short but God's never came up short amen Israel were carried by this p power to the Palace so this end time bride she's going to be carried by the wagging of blessings of the son of man to change us from Mortal to immortality the prophet says the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on he says you're not feeding on man his words will fail but you're feeding on the infallible body word of the son of man he said if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself listen now he says to give yourself strength to Fly Above All the denominations and the things of the world feeding on the wagons of blessing gives you strength to fly brother the eagle in the Barnard never had the strength to soar above the Barnyard until he begin to Feast on Heavenly things you want to know why we're Earthbound tonight cuz it's what we're feeding on you feed on the world you feel feed on television you feed on uh uh uh lies and deceit and talking about your neighbor amen that's as far as you can live but I say tonight there's a greater place for the Bride of Jesus Christ in the hour that we're living in amen we shouldn't be living as a second cousin we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we have everything that we have need of right here within us amen but that eagle in the Barnard once he begin to feed on the infallible word it turned him Heavenly when the eagle begin to recognize that he matched the image of the Heavenly oh brother what about you and I tonight feasting on the word body of the son of man you say brother bam I need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you've got a right to go to Satan says give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possessors of Heaven and Earth I'm an air he says give it back listen to this this is powerful are you with me Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authority of his word with the faith to say it's mine lay it down Satan you lay it down you Tu it from me you give it back because I'm serving notice on you lay it down he said that gets him started he said let's don't get him started let's get him running tonight lay it down because I've come with the script your Authority I am a believer how many believers do we have in the house tonight Satan give it back he's the bluff can you say Amen he's a squatter brother Bobby he has no legal rights at all come on somebody if he came and stole your Victory sto your joy amen he's only holding it as long as you allow him to hold it because Satan doesn't have the power that to hold it when a Believer comes to take it back what belongs to him when those four lepers went down to the enemy's gate amen they came they had one thing in mind I'm going to D go down there amen and take back what rightfully belongs to me and the grip of Satan a been the only Power of grip of Satan has tonight is as long as we give it to him for 2,000 years ago sister Eve a been our savior Our Redeemer brother Jared he conquered death hell and the grave so we got a right tonight to go down to Satan he's stuck your children that you're claiming you got a right to go down there and say Satan take your filthy hands off my possession they was mine before they was yours give it back and you got a right to take back what belongs to you if he stoed your joy tonight amen let's don't sit here as lazy Christians let's go down to the enemy's camp and say Satan you're giving me back my joy amen he's a robber Satan is a thief you know I'm G get ahead of myself but time probably going to wind down on me anyhow amen but he's a thief everything s brother Travis everything Satan is trying to do amen is block you from an uncoming visitation he don't want you to get get in the spirit of the the composer tonight he don't want you to receive he don't want you to realize tonight I if a young person would have the right mental attitude to Divine promise of God they could take back what belongs to them he don't want you he wants you to live defeated he wants you to live discouraged he wants you to think that you're nobody and he does everything he can but I come here as a gospel preacher to tell you Satan is a liar he hasn't have the power sister Vana can't hold it any longer amen he's powerless tonight I say i' I've fed up with the Enemy can I have an amen tonight I'm fed up with the Enemy taking my joy giving me heavy hands give me an heavy heart give me a heavy burden oh but tonight our King of Kings says don't carry that burden any longer amen amen he said cast your burdens upon me Satan here he goes I ain't taking your filth any longer I ain't taking your garbage any longer he better take your spiritual and flip him right off of your your shoulder says I ain't got time for you any longer amen I'm going on with Jesus just the same oh he can run his mouth tonight but I want to believer to recognize that you have the scripture authority to say Satan get off of my property and it gives you the power to go down and take it out of his hands I'm here to tell you his hands are slimy his hands are deceitful he makes you think he's so big but brother Travis he's nothing tonight amen he's been unemed by the prophetic blessing to let us know he's nothing but a bluff he has a bow but he has no arrows brother Carter Heen he's a big Bluff tonight can I have somebody say brother Joe I am going down tonight I've been fighting this battle for some time I've been discoursed for long enough I've been worried long enough and say tonight I'm going to be a John Ryan extra extra Read All About It praise God I'm Healed I'm going to praise him tonight I'm going to stop my feet tonight I'm going clap my hands tonight I'm going to stop on every devil and put him back where he belongs he don't belong in your car he don't belong in your home brother no the only thing we he has is what we give him don't give him nothing tonight don't give him an inch I promise you he'll take him off my don't you love the Lord he says you've got something to do that land is yours go possess it amen he says and the Christian keeps setting back he said oh I just wonder he said oh my just turn loose just turn loose and get all those things away from you and say Mr Satan you are defeated can you say it with me tonight Mr Satan you're defeated tonight Jesus Christ my redeemer stripped you of every Power that you had when he died at Calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and the Lord was telling them in the in numbers this is your promise this is your Canan this is your inheritance he said you go down and drive out the land drive out the inhabitants of the land drive out all the images that's un like me and take possession for I have given you the land to possess what an attitude give me my Mountain I don't care who's in it I don't care how big they are I don't care what kind of army they have I'm here to tell you our arm is bigger your Mountain may be big my my God Is Bigger amen amen Exodus 23 says I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines from the desert unto the river for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hands and thou shalt drive them out before thee thou shall drive them out before you brother when they begin to drive them out those demons didn't have no power to hold it amen Brother David they might have been inhabitants of that land brother Elmer they might have been there a long time they might have they might have had their homes there they might have had their you know their mail sent there they might have thought that that

wrong place at the wrong time I say the spirit of Liberty is in this Tabernacle tonight I've been guilty of setting on my hands every one of us has amen every one of us has came to church with things on our mind and we fight and prayers every one of us has fall short but here you are tonight would you look around us on a communion night years ago you don't have the church to be empty but here you

somebody else to clap go ahead and clap don't wait on somebody else to worship let me say this tonight if we take worship out of the church what we have it's nonsense a true Son of God would never want to drive worship out of the church but what a man of God wants is the spirit of Christ to dwell in the Tabernacle and if he wants to move we want to let him move amen I say tonight Lord go ahead and move on every person in this Tabernacle tonight I say Lord open the windows of Heaven on every situation in these people's lives tonight Lord come in miraculous way Lord just Lord is my prayer

I tell you what I'm going to do he says no you ain't going to do nothing tonight brother Cody you came to the wrong place at the wrong time Satan you're powerless tonight he said that's a way to talk back to him I know my position in Christ and you just might as well get away I'm listening to your garbage no more I got an inheritance we're living in Satan's eating no doubt amen but before Satan had an Eden God made a preparation for you to defeat Satan in his own kingdom I say tonight Satan your Kingdom's coming down down with sickness down with bitterness down with funny feelings down with hatred and Malice down with these feelings that keep us pound listen we Rejoice by promise and God's preparation for us to obtain it circum circumstances can't stop us demons can't stop us the burning bush had what Moses liked it gave you the preparation to go down as a onean Invasion and he was moved by the Heavenly let me tell you something brother he said listen to this I say this with respect Hallelujah all hell can't stop it oh Hallelujah well if they don't make you want to dance I don't know why will amen listen friends amen all hell can't stop this bride movement they're trying to stop

Hell shall not Prevail against it oh what kind of church are we he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it he said she's moving on oh brother I say the move's on tonight the move is on Hell cannot stop it it brings a liberty to shout it brings a liberty to sing amen amen I'm here to tell you when I was a sinner I lived the I lived the life of a sinner I did I I worship it whatever I was involved in I was all in whether it's ball games whether it's pool halls amen but listen amen as I trans transitioned from that into this life I want to give my all to everything about this amen this message has came in a way amen it screamed out amen it was it was communion of the Soul amen it's begin a relationship between the Heavenly and the Earthly being and it's changing me come on somebody it changed this guy it used to do this and it used to be adultery it used to lie it used to cheat it used to gamble it used to do the things of the world but something happened Brother David Paul the greater came lived inside of me and I'm happy sh kind I'm happy tonight to know that my redeemer is not dead but he's alive I'm I'm excited to know that God's not dead but he's alive brother he's not living a been way out there somewhere but he's living right here and it's just like fire shut up in my bones do you love him listen we Rejoice by promise she's moving on the gates of hell would be against her but it cannot Prevail that's right you can't stop it God has ordained it to move on he's appointed it by Authority that's the reason why they seen it because they was left Ed to see it how many's elected to see it can you say Amen to that and let's turn to uh Second Chronicles real quick I'm not going to hold you long I got a lot left I knew I wouldn't get done but it's always good preaching at home God's good isn't he 2 Chronicles 20 verse 15 say he said hearken you all you Judea and inhabitants of Jerusalem and th King Jehoshaphat thus say the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours can you say it with me tonight the battle is not ours but it's God's oh doesn't that change everything tonight listen if it's your Battle Sister Sarah you can lose come on somebody if it's your batt sister Debbie you can lose brother John you can lose but this is not my battle this is not a war this is God's battle this is God's war that he's already conquered it 2,000 years ago Hallelujah we can't lose in this battle and he's simply telling them and encouraging them don't worry because we're outnumbered don't worry because we're outclassed don't worry uh who's against us I say tonight we should be the same way don't worry about who's talking about our church don't worry about what people are doing to us on the job and the fact of the matter is Brother David if God before us who can be against us and he simply tell them I know you're outclass brother Joe I know that you you're not big enough to win this war but let me reassure you the god that our prophets has been ministering to you you know the god of Abraham you know the same God that changed Sarah's body you know the same God that turned Abraham amen back to a young man again you know the same God that saved Noah you know the same God that was there in the fiery furnace you know about our God he's an Ever knowing all knowing ever present never failing God he's an on time God he showed up in the Lions then he showed up in the in the fiery furnace he showed up and showed out in the fiery furnace sister elz he's the same God tonight and he's here to show out again he's here to let you know I'm never going to walk let you walk alone when you don't feel him brother Wesley I'm going to be there what kind of God we serve tonight even when you're backl he said you know what you can't go far enough where I won't watch over you we're talking about a God that's a prepared God and before he ever sent you on a journey he knew exactly he said Paul you'll go to Rome he knew he was going to Rome but he also know he's going to be Shipwrecked thrown into prison but at the end of the day he knew one thing he Ser a mighty God that can never fail oh he's all over me tonight amen he's never failing he's all knowing he's all he's right there with us I'm not going to leave you sister Debbie I'm not what a promise and he says you know what they might have felt like all the preacher sister Tammy they heard all the all the the testimonies that they heard they heard it about so and so amen as young kids we've heard how God was back there and the the great temp revivals and how was God was moving and the old moving transition from Pentecost to the opening of the word and a great Revival he the blinded eyes open the dead raised my a better we've heard about God but old brother amen how it how it changes from from what we heard somebody else when it comes home to us and maybe this is the way they was feeling when God began to tell them as I was with them I'm going to be with you they couldn't stop Moses you remember the testimony Moses he met God in a pillow fire he went down to Egypt am as a mighty Army like Russia is today and went down as a onean Invasion can you have can I have an amen is there anything too big for my God is there anything too big for my God tonight you tell me your situation I'll tell you my God's bigger you tell me what side your mountain is I'm here to declare my God Is Bigger amen amen and they begin to hear these testimonies but now God is speaking through this man he said he says oh you don't have to fight in this battle this is not your battle this is God's and he says tomorrow go down against them behold they came out of the Cliff of seas and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jel and you shall not need to fight in this battle simply set yourselves stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that with you oh Judea and Jerusalem and fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you oh what a feeling that must have been I can tell you a lot of things brother Matt I'm I got you back amen as brother as much as brother Matt thinks of me and I think of him he might tell me the same thing brother Joe I'm white behind you I'm with you all the way but there's one thing about it he can fail and I can fail I can I can tell you in Pro I'll be there tomorrow brother amen something comes up and it deters me but God's not like that if God tells you something he never changes amen I can tell you I'm going to be there man you'll go out to the battle Heen I'll be there that might give him some reassurance but it's nothing like knowing god is going to fight your battle it's nothing like knowing that God is on our side it's nothing like feeling not just a sensation cuz that can fail you but realize that God himself is here to fight our battles amen and how that must have felt that they tell him God's going to be this is God's battle and now he's telling him go down against this great multitude Moses go down to Egypt come on somebody I know we preach these things but have you ever really saw and stood and thought for a second how that must have came across the Moses's natural mind come on somebody he's been down there he was a he was a leader down there he knew the power of Egypt oh I'm going to take a run away right now brother David but there was something in that Pillar of Fire that draw out anything of Moses out of him and he placed something there says Moses go down there and I let my people go tell tell that devil tell that great Army I am that I am all knowing all pring God Amen a few minutes before that that that pillow fire experience he might have ran but that pillow of fire done something to him and no doubt they was thinking about these things my time is sorry about this let me can I finish this and Jehoshaphat the Lord will be with thee and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with a space to the ground and Judea and the habitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord can somebody praise God for a moment tonight right in the face of their great opposition they had a right to worship because it wasn't their battle oh Church what a liberty it is for you and I tonight we don't have to wait on somebody else God is on our side Hallelujah and that never failing God Is Right Here Right Now saying this is your time go ahead it's your time to shine it's your time to shout it's your time to scream and they begin Paul they begin to worship God my this is just me brother man I just don't I don't feel like it was just a a ritual they were doing sir but Brothers right in the face of their opposition they begin to worship they begin to praise their God and the Levites and the children of coites children of kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high oh my I can imagine I don't think this was a dead church service do you brother mad do you think what kind what kind of church service do you think that was on they didn't care what the enemy thought they was beyond that I say tonight Church we've calloused over enough in the age that we're living in I don't care what people saying about me oh we need that right kind of attitude give me my Mountain I don't care who's on it it's mine tonight with a loud voice on high and they rose up early in the morning and went forth North Into the Wilderness I can imagine you imagine trying to sleep that night heyen brother Morgan's kind of like this a little bit it's like you know brother Travis we as Hunters man we got this prize Buck on camera it might

again he Lord Give Me That kind of Desire tonight that's what he's looking for you and I tonight amen whether you feel it or not whether you're sin or not whether you a a Revival is striking your home or not I don't know about you for me and my house we're going to go to the house of the Lord and we're going to praise him can I say it like this brother Matt whether we whether he comes or not I'm still going to praise Him CU I know he's going to come but that even if he don't show up in my behalf he's still my God and he's working in our future how can we be conquered we serve a God that was in our past he's he's working in our future and he's living in our present and that same god Jehovah Gyra I'm read can I turn it off for a minute I'm gonna finish this I've got two more three more pages we won't get there tonight He says and all you inhabit Jerusalem believe the Lord your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper and when had consulted with the people he pointed sangers unto the Lord and they should praise the beauty of Holiness and they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord for his Mercy endure forever praise the Lord when you enter into his presence with praise he enters in your circumstances with power and deliverance Hallelujah and when he consulted and when they begin to sing I know you've heard this this is so good and when they begin to sing and when they begin to praise their God it moved something happened Church Heavens were opened could you imagine the band of angels all around them come on somebody they was they might have been a few in number but all around them sister Tammy was the armies of God my and they was so it was such a powerful movement oh can I say tonight it might be your night that your praise and your singing Moves God and your situation amen just like Paul and Salas just like John Ryan just like to this situation right here God begin to move and that great Army and it moved the Lord and the Lord set ambushments against the children of Amon and Moab and mount SE which had come against Judea and they were all smitten for the children of Amon Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount seir utterly to slay to to slay and Destroy them man I got to think about this today you imagine here's these three armies coming up against the children of God Amen and when the children of god sister Joy begin to praise God and begin to worship and begin to sing the power of the heavenlies came down and the ones that was going to destroy them begin to turn and fight amongst themselves it brought such a strong delusion upon them my you you imagine what was running through their mind as they was going to the battle to destroy the children of God and all of a sudden the changing and they turned on one another and they begin to destroy each and every one of of that army me until every one of them was consumed and when Judah came to war in the 24th verse the watch Tire in the wilderness music players come I'm going to finish this we we close my God's good isn't he I literally didn't get done with two pages of notes tonight and Judah came toward the Watchtower in the wilderness and they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and none escaped you imagine what a feeling that was what a Revival that was heyen we have a prophetic Insight tonight come on somebody that demon that's tormenting you tonight those demons of depression that Demons of Lies amen and we got a watcht tonight and he says come up here look Hallelujah we got a vision tonight without a vision the people perish but we have a vision tonight we've got a watch to tonight and brother BR said in the mess of the uh wings of a snow white dove he said when the presence of the Lord dropped in that room this ain't in my notes either but ay bad but when the spirit of the Lord dropped in that room and he had this problem for many years he was he was tormented by a stomach issue then he went up on shinion Canyon and then brother Travis a prbly God when he seen that squirrel that came down his throat and begin to tear him up and he had a and his stomach was withering there's no way he could ever get over it brother Noah he said but this time when he got up there that squirrel missed his mouth and hid his chest and he felt he fell Upon A a cactus and those Thor horns pierc that squirrel and he heard a voice from the heavens say your enemy is dead Hallelujah and brother Brown said he went back to the doctor and when he got back to the doctor the doctor says brother bradam hey I hate to give you this bad news but you'll never get over this you'll always have this problem and brother B sit in the wings of the snow white dove sister Eve he said I would have been a discouraged boy if it had not been for the vision and the vision said your enemy is dead glory to God and we got to watch Tire in this hour am been it's screamed out with prophetic blessing your enemy is dead Rejoice Bri Rejoice for your enemy is dead and Jehoshaphat and the people came to take away the spool of them they have found among them abundance of both riches jewelry they stripped off themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days and Gathering the spools it was so so much oh my goodness no doubt they might have been just barely getting by in this life oh I feel religious tonight they might have just been living from service to service and meeting to meeting brother but they got up there in that watch time and they looked out and that old devil that was keeping the children of God in bondage from all the spoils they was looking out and there was dead bodies everywhere could you imagine Judea screaming out to the congre it be like a good pastor gets up here he ain't here to beat you down and kick you and knock down when you're down he begins to look through the eyes of God and he begins to scream out it's yours it's a great hour of charges at hand every promise in the book is yours don't stop don't quit don't give up keep pressing the battle every promise in the book is yours how will ever get it's dead they have no power Satan has no Authority Hallelujah and Judea begin to scream Go Get It Go Get your inheritance go get your SPS go get your [Music] Victory and on the fourth day they assembl themselves in the valley if I pronounce this right Baraka but they're blessed of the Lord and the 27 verse says then they returned every man under Judea and Jerusalem and Jehosaphat in the Forefront of them to go down again Jerusalem with Joy are you hearing me somebody that's what a Revival brings it brings joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah for the Lord had made them oh I like it this is my battle this is the Lord's battle amen they was there they was reaping the benefits they was grabbing the SPs they was having Victory but at the end of the day this is the Lord made Us Victorious the Lord made us Overcomers the Lord had made them to Rejoice over their enemies Hallelujah oh don't you love him don't you love him how many can move with me tonight how many can move by the presence of God break the barriers tonight then you'll be free brother B said break the barriers of unbelief break the barriers and then you can go free how many can move with me tonight when the walls don't seem like they're moving come on Can You Stand to your feet tonight when it don't look like those walls are moving very much Satan has designed this barrier to stop you and prevent you from reaching your inheritance he's work for many many years brother Tom and try to get you and block your oncoming visitation he's worked very hard endless days and nights to try to conquer this church try to conquer this bride and he pushed this barrier of unbelief in front of you but it cannot keep you from your blessing tonight your day could somebody walk with me tonight say this is the day that the Lord has made amen I'm going to overcome I'm going to be Victorious and when you come up to that barrier Satan's can't wait he's been waiting for this moment brother Cody he

tonight hallelujah hallelujah don't you love him listen just before we change it and sing the song The Enemy designs things to make you feel like you're not worthy to worship you're not worthy to

this old fra body is going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're going to change from Mortal into immortality oh Hallelujah church I know it's a song We Sing it's something that we preach but church I believe tonight and it's a reality cuz I'm looking at it from the eyes of Grace when I'm not worthy but he is my righteous filthy rags but his righteousness overshadows us and that's the reason why the scripture said be ye perfect how in the world can this failure brother Travis be ever made perfect God said I prepared it I was going to preach on I never get to get to it tonight but God has prepared it the blood the blood the blood of Jesus Christ overshadows us and when God looks down upon the blood he sees you as white as snow oh Hallelujah I don't know about you

strength from day today it will never lose Lo it amen you love the Lord tonight how many say they're thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ amen and just what a a privilege it is to be able to live the life of an overcomer many times that we walked out and we saw the enemies that we had to face that were laying on the ground and hear that God had came in in the middle of the night sometimes when you you ain't even there to fix it but God will fix it amen I just I think God can do things that's beyond our ability he can he can make things better that you can't make better and he can do it better than we can anyhow so we just want to rely on him amen you appreciate the Lord and what he has done for us won't somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight isn't he a wonderful God how he's ready to have communion tonight and I know it's drawing late but we're just going to take our time we we don't have communion very often and and so we just want to take the time with the Lord and and and don't don't worry about it we'll just want to just let everything go and let God have his way tonight and and just get our hearts and Minds prepared and uh for that for that service and just the time to be able to Fellowship together and I just thought that was good brother B said I would have been a discouraged boy if it hadn't been for the vision I thank God that we have a vision tonight that we know who we are and we know where we're going and we know our enemy don't have the ability to overpower us amen but we're not discouraged we're not defeated we're we're we're happy in the Lord Brother mark because we know who we are and we know where we're going and I just love the Lord Brother B said there's nothing like it I've ever found on Earth is to come together in Heavenly places and have communion and fellowship with God and with each other that's what God had intended in the Garden of Eden isn't it wonderful that Here We Are Tonight brother Jared to be able to come and have fellowship with God that's what communion really is it's not it's not just to uh partake of of the service or the table that's set before you but is to be able to have a real communion and fellowship with God and so we just want our hearts and our our minds just to be able to be clear and and maybe if we could just sing this song tonight we're going to sing uh make me more like you amen and if there's something in your heart tonight that you just like to give to the Lord and and friends let me tell you don't let the devil keep you from a blessing that God has for you brother Joe was speaking on a prophet prophetic blessing that they're here in a communion service I've saw people that were healed I've saw people filled with the Holy Ghost I've saw miracles happen I've heard testimony of testimony of things the miraculous things that God has done in the in the middle of a communion line so it's not just something that we do as a tradition or to do something just to uh take up time or or ritual or something like that but I expect the supernatural amen and this is what God is doing for us tonight brother Mark he is preparing prepared a table just like he did that day with the disciples and they sat down with them and Jesus began to break bread and Brother David when he broke the bread he told them do this in remembrance of me and it was the moment that he would share with them it was an intimate moment between Christ and the disciples and that's what God has called us to tonight to be able to remember that time of the Lord he knew what would what was about to happen he knew he was about to go lay down his life and and so here he's called us again to and I I just want to invite you as we come for the communion where the brothers are going to come out and we're going to go from this side and brother Wesley is going to move that chair right there out of the way and and uh we're going to come down from this side and then exit on this side and and we just want to encourage everybody to take a part of the communion and you know if there's something in your in your life I I spoke it this morning but I want to say it again tonight there ain't but two things that would disqualify a person or would cause a person not to take communion and one is that you didn't is that you uh that you had a confessed sin or hadn't repented of something and the other was that you weren't born again so how many Born Again believers do we have here tonight and for something in your life you need to repent for then repent for it God is he's a I know a testimony of a girl that stood in line that was walking before a prophet one day and as he would discern the hearts of people and tell them the things that was wrong in their life and she would come up and hear she was out with her friend and she was smoking and when she got up in the line and she was so she was so nervous that when I get up there he's going to know that I've done that and he's going to expose it in in front of all these people and so she bowed her head and she said Lord forgive me for that and she came up in the line brother Mark and went out and received what she had asked for and her friend come up at the end and they they said well you know why didn't the why didn't he see what was what was wrong with her and you know that she had that that sin in her life and why didn't you see it and and brother B had told him back brother Mark he said well because she had repented before she ever got up here and if God can't see it then how could he show me it don't take but a few seconds for a person to repent it ain't something that you got to come and and beat it out of God and beat it out of an altar and and and to repent brother Mark it takes a True Heart of repentance and saying God I pray you'd forgive me and and and there ain't none of us will ever be worthy outside of the blood of Jesus Christ how could we be worthy of the body of our Lord Jesus or not discern the Lord's body outside of the blood of Jesus so I invite you tonight if there's something you'd like to repent or if you if you have something on your heart and maybe it's been a while and you like the brothers to pray for you well they'll be right over there on the side as you come through through the line but we just want everybody to be able to take part it's an Open Table amen so we just want to invite our brothers to come brother Morgan and and brother Phil as they as they come but we just want to sing this song Maybe Just bow your heads and and and just open your heart to the Lord
