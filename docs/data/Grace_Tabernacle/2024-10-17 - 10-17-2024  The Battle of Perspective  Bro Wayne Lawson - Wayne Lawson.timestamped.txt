[57:20] looking at a group of people that
[57:21] understand that that it's nothing but

[57:25] Lord when he was praying In The Garden
[57:27] of Gethsemane amen he died a death
[57:29] before he died amen the scripture said
[57:32] he prayed there at Gethsemane which
[57:34] means wine press or which oil press
[57:36] which is a place where they would press
[57:38] the oils and it was there he said Lord
[57:41] father if it's possible let this cup
[57:44] pass from me and it wasn't possible
[57:47] because it wasn't anything else could do
[57:49] it amen and I believe if he knew there
[57:52] that in the garden he knows that there
[57:53] tonight that there's nothing there's
[57:56] nothing but the blood amen you love the
[57:59] Lord tonight amen isn't it good to be in

[58:10] that atmosphere can be created right out
[58:12] in the middle of a field somewhere but
[58:14] we wasn't the first ones had this
[58:16] thought God gave this to Moses years ago
[58:19] and when God wanted to place to meet
[58:20] with people in an atmosphere where
[58:22] things could bud and yield Moses made
[58:25] God a place place and we've made a place

[1:00:58] thank you tonight Lord we lord we speak
[1:01:01] of one another and the works that you do

[1:01:06] Lord that there is nothing Lord there's
[1:01:09] nothing that can be done without you
[1:01:11] lord that it would be in vain without
[1:01:14] you so tonight we thank you for your
[1:01:16] presence that you would come here Lord
[1:01:19] your Prophet said to us Lord that you
[1:01:21] come where you're invited Lord no matter
[1:01:24] how humble the place or how humble the
[1:01:27] people but Lord when your children bring
[1:01:30] an invitation to you you've never missed
[1:01:32] an appointment and Lord Jesus we want to
[1:01:35] thank you tonight Lord for your mercy
[1:01:37] upon us now father as we have invited
[1:01:40] you we want to give you the floor we
[1:01:42] want to yield to you Lord and give you
[1:01:44] the right away in these meetings Lord
[1:01:46] Jesus we ask you that if there be
[1:01:49] something that you would want to speak
[1:01:50] that you would use us Lord use these
[1:01:52] mortal lips now before our our families

[1:01:57] Lord we admit our our failures and our
[1:01:59] felties Lord we know there's nothing
[1:02:02] that we could say or do that could help
[1:02:04] anyone but Lord Jesus if you'd be so
[1:02:06] merciful Lord to use our lips tonight to
[1:02:09] use this meeting for you Lord and
[1:02:12] something great and wonderful would
[1:02:13] happen we'd give all the glory and the
[1:02:15] honor to you and father we would lay it
[1:02:18] upon you now father we invite you into
[1:02:21] this meeting we ask you to take control
[1:02:23] bless your children father in the the
[1:02:26] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and
[1:02:30] amen and God bless you if you have your
[1:02:32] Bibles tonight we want to just take a
[1:02:35] few minutes in the scripture here in the
[1:02:37] book of Corinthians uh 1 Corinthians 2
[1:02:43] and14 and we're also going to be looking
[1:02:47] at Hebrews 5 and
[1:02:49] 14 1 Corinthians 2 and 14 brother
[1:02:56] 1 Corinthians 2
[1:02:59] and4 but the natural man receiveth not
[1:03:04] the things of the spirit of God for they
[1:03:08] are foolishness unto him and neither can
[1:03:11] he know them because they are
[1:03:13] spiritually
[1:03:15] discerned in Hebrews chapter 5 and verse
[1:03:19] 14 but strong
[1:03:21] meat belongeth to them that are of full
[1:03:24] age
[1:03:26] even those who by reason of use have
[1:03:30] their senses
[1:03:32] exercised to discern both good and evil
[1:03:36] may God bless you tonight as you be
[1:03:38] seated I want to speak to you for just
[1:03:41] the next little bit here and I want to
[1:03:43] talk to you about the Battle of
[1:03:46] perspective the Battle of perspective
[1:03:50] amen uh uh and let me Define the word
[1:03:53] perspective uh it's a way of thinking
[1:03:56] about and understanding something it's a
[1:03:59] way of thinking about or understanding
[1:04:02] something and that's exactly where the
[1:04:04] battle really lays tonight upon each one
[1:04:07] of us is the Battle of understanding uh
[1:04:11] and I could say it to you like this the
[1:04:13] challenge of the age is discernment that
[1:04:16] is the challenge uh this this age that
[1:04:19] we're living in is in an age of fruit
[1:04:21] and all the trees are bringing forth
[1:04:23] fruit in the season so there must be a
[1:04:25] discernment of what kind that we are
[1:04:27] partaking of now one thing that we know
[1:04:30] for certain if God then would cause us
[1:04:33] uh a a need to have discernment and
[1:04:35] would command that we would be
[1:04:36] Discerning he also then would have to
[1:04:39] supply the discernment he would he would
[1:04:41] have to give it now somebody says well
[1:04:43] God don't give discernment but yet he
[1:04:45] does God does give discernment because
[1:04:47] when you look in the scriptures you'll
[1:04:49] find out that he gave discernment but
[1:04:51] yet even in the animals now brother
[1:04:53] ramam said his first Bible of course was
[1:04:56] is the nature and so when we look into
[1:04:58] nature itself we can see that the
[1:05:00] animals themselves have discernment and
[1:05:02] I I think it's funny as you look into
[1:05:04] into the into the nature and you can see
[1:05:07] how that brother Bram talks about over
[1:05:08] there in India before they'd have a big
[1:05:10] earthquake he said the all the mules and
[1:05:12] he said the The Oxen and I've been there
[1:05:14] and saw the fields and how they're full
[1:05:16] and it gets real hot in the summer and
[1:05:18] there ain't hardly any trees in some of
[1:05:20] those places and they pick all the Rocks
[1:05:22] up out of the field and they build
[1:05:23] fences some of y'all know about that
[1:05:25] brother Roy just build an old rock fence
[1:05:27] you know and amen must have been like
[1:05:29] the hills Arkansas enough Rock but but
[1:05:31] you you can see them them fences what he
[1:05:33] talks about over there and when the
[1:05:35] animals in the heat of the day they get
[1:05:37] up against those fences to get some
[1:05:38] shade but brother Bram said it wasn't
[1:05:40] the other day he said they were watching
[1:05:42] how them animals started scattering back
[1:05:44] from them fences and and the everybody
[1:05:45] was saying what's wrong or what's going
[1:05:47] on and he said there was an earthquake
[1:05:49] about to hit and he said they uh that
[1:05:52] god-given instinct was causing them to
[1:05:54] get away from the wall before it fell
[1:05:57] see because God gives discernment to
[1:05:59] animals he gives them an ability to uh
[1:06:02] perceive something that before it
[1:06:04] happens or there there's something that
[1:06:06] happens brother Ram said before
[1:06:07] earthquakes comes and before things
[1:06:09] happen little birds find their shelters
[1:06:12] and and they and they find these things
[1:06:14] because see God gives it and it's surely
[1:06:17] if God would give a fish a discernment
[1:06:19] how much more would he give his children
[1:06:22] if God would give a discernment to a
[1:06:24] duck all the way up there in Canada in a
[1:06:26] certain time of year about this time of
[1:06:27] year they start changing their mind on
[1:06:29] them being North and a little bit later
[1:06:31] they start their they flying south amen
[1:06:34] but something has to cause them to get
[1:06:36] ready to go they're just engineered with
[1:06:38] something amen C you they sell a lot of
[1:06:42] merchandise in the duck world Amen
[1:06:44] relying on the nature that's within the
[1:06:47] duck the Ducks are going to come every
[1:06:49] year they're going to come and they're
[1:06:51] going to fly a certain path and I know
[1:06:52] we all think we probably could pick a
[1:06:55] better path for them but you know when
[1:06:57] God picks a path it's the best path and
[1:06:59] and they don't have GPS and they don't
[1:07:01] have man-made Technologies and and they
[1:07:04] don't have to pack up a bunch of things
[1:07:05] to take with them they just hear the
[1:07:07] call and they begin to move because
[1:07:10] their perception is that if we don't
[1:07:12] move we're going to die if something
[1:07:14] don't happen there's going to be
[1:07:15] something different and and so God gives
[1:07:18] that to even animals and you can see it
[1:07:20] when the Bible talks about Noah building
[1:07:22] an ark amen something made them uh them
[1:07:25] animals know that it was time to get on
[1:07:28] that Ark now there's one place brother B
[1:07:29] kind of talks about how when Noah got
[1:07:31] that Ark finished that he just stood up
[1:07:33] and hollered Hallelujah a few times and
[1:07:36] here they come and got on the ark you
[1:07:38] know because God gave them something to
[1:07:40] know what what could we say tonight
[1:07:42] about how they all got on that Ark you
[1:07:44] couldn't really explain it other than to
[1:07:46] say that God gave them a perception that
[1:07:48] something's about to happen and we've
[1:07:50] got to make a change and and God was
[1:07:52] supplying that change what could you say
[1:07:54] about an old aome that that would carry
[1:07:56] its babies in the point of death and
[1:07:58] right in the middle of the day against
[1:08:00] its own nature would would walk right
[1:08:02] out into the human world and lose its
[1:08:04] fear of humanity you know since Noah's
[1:08:06] time the Bible said that the fear of man
[1:08:09] was upon animals amen and there was a
[1:08:11] natural fear for an animal but there was
[1:08:13] a perception amen something happens to
[1:08:16] this little old pum that decides I got
[1:08:18] to get down to a certain house now now
[1:08:20] the prophet said I seen that pum and it
[1:08:23] passed three houses before it come to
[1:08:26] and was something made that little fell
[1:08:27] know that it wasn't in that first house
[1:08:30] and it wasn't in justification or
[1:08:32] something made it know it wasn't in them
[1:08:34] houses and made it kept going brother B
[1:08:36] said till it turned the corner amen and
[1:08:39] that little fell turned the corner and
[1:08:40] went down there at the prophet's house
[1:08:42] you know brother B said that that that
[1:08:44] little possum laid out there in the Sun
[1:08:47] and there was some shade just over there
[1:08:48] but it laid out there in that sun
[1:08:50] knowing amen that there was a a ripening
[1:08:54] that was needed in the presence of God
[1:08:56] and and that little that little Pome
[1:08:59] knew that and I I believe if God can
[1:09:01] give that kind of discernment to an
[1:09:03] animal why couldn't he give that kind of
[1:09:04] discernment or that kind of perception
[1:09:07] Amen to a person if they would only
[1:09:09] listen to God there something that God
[1:09:11] has given to every man woman or child
[1:09:14] amen that that something that lets you
[1:09:16] know that that there's something wrong
[1:09:18] with this or there's something right
[1:09:20] about this that's that's what God gives
[1:09:22] and you knowy I hate to say it but
[1:09:24] sometimes animals got more discernment
[1:09:26] than human
[1:09:27] beings sometimes animals has got more
[1:09:30] discernment than human beings I got
[1:09:31] scripture on that by the way that was a
[1:09:33] man b b balum one time somebody tried to
[1:09:36] hire him to curse God's children and he
[1:09:38] and he got on a donkey and be to ride
[1:09:40] down there against the will of God and
[1:09:42] you know the Bible tells us that that
[1:09:44] old donkey gave up on him three times
[1:09:47] and three times that donkey tried to
[1:09:49] tell him we are going the wrong
[1:09:51] direction but the third time balum got
[1:09:54] off and began to beat that mule amen and
[1:09:57] told him he said well I I just kill you
[1:09:59] and can you imagine when that donkey
[1:10:01] turned over and looked at its master and
[1:10:03] said ain't I your donkey haven't you
[1:10:06] owned me all these years and when have I
[1:10:09] ever failed to carry you brother I tell
[1:10:11] you I'd have done a check up right there
[1:10:13] amen when your animals start talking to
[1:10:15] you amen let me tell you what amen and
[1:10:18] all of a sudden Baum's eyes opened up
[1:10:20] and saw what that donkey had been seeing
[1:10:22] the whole time a angel of the Lord was
[1:10:25] standing standing there with a drawn
[1:10:26] sword and said if if the MU hadn't
[1:10:28] stopped I would have killed you already
[1:10:31] amen but God Amen had let that mule G
[1:10:34] that donkey have a little bit amen of
[1:10:36] discernment and it saved the life of bam
[1:10:38] and that's when bam finally said amen to
[1:10:41] the angel of the Lord he said well if
[1:10:42] you see that my way is evil you forgive
[1:10:45] me and I will change my direction and
[1:10:47] the angel said no bam don't don't change
[1:10:49] your direction just keep going amen but
[1:10:52] you only say down there what it is I had
[1:10:54] put in your lips and amen I tell you
[1:10:57] what a powerful story tonight if you're
[1:10:59] going to talk about if you're going to
[1:11:01] talk about perception how could you talk
[1:11:03] about perception and not talk about the
[1:11:05] difference in the way the people view
[1:11:08] the children of Israel when I think
[1:11:10] about balam and his story with Bic now
[1:11:13] we all know Bic and and we know the
[1:11:15] country of Moab and of course Moab was a
[1:11:18] was a an incestuous uh son of lot that
[1:11:22] he'd had with his daughter and they had
[1:11:23] started this Kingdom Moab and when when
[1:11:26] the children of Israel needed to go
[1:11:28] through that land cuz lot was Ken to
[1:11:30] Abraham right and they needed to go
[1:11:32] through that land on their way through
[1:11:34] there amen the Bible tells us that they
[1:11:36] didn't want that kind of Revival in that
[1:11:39] country so Bayo decided I'll hire me
[1:11:42] some preachers to preach against that
[1:11:45] move so that we will might be able to
[1:11:47] stop it because they knew they couldn't
[1:11:48] stop it on their own right because God
[1:11:51] fought for Israel amen so the only way
[1:11:54] to stop it was to get something
[1:11:55] Supernatural involved amen but you find
[1:11:58] out this amen that amen there wasn't
[1:12:00] enough money to pay balum to be able to
[1:12:03] curse God's children CU God done blessed
[1:12:05] his children amen I I'd love to I'd love
[1:12:08] to study scripture and I find out here
[1:12:10] when you're looking at balum and and
[1:12:12] you're looking at the Revival when
[1:12:14] they're trying to go through there that
[1:12:15] that bides the king of Moab decides he
[1:12:18] said what we're going to do is we're
[1:12:19] going to stop this and we're going to do
[1:12:21] it by this this preacher this balum and
[1:12:23] they bring him in amen and and they and
[1:12:26] and he says to him he says well I'll
[1:12:28] tell you what you need to do you need to
[1:12:30] come right over here now now I'm not
[1:12:32] going to preach on all these spots but
[1:12:34] I'll tell you this amen they didn't just
[1:12:36] say to balam to prophesy against Israel
[1:12:39] but he changed even the locations that
[1:12:42] balum stood so when balum looked at the
[1:12:45] children of Israel amen B said well no
[1:12:47] no I I know you might be able to curse
[1:12:49] them from here but let's move over here
[1:12:52] now the scripture details that there
[1:12:54] were three different places that Bayo
[1:12:57] took balum now if you uh if you like to
[1:12:59] read you'll find out amen that brother
[1:13:01] bam says it like this he said now when
[1:13:03] bam looked upon it he said he failed to
[1:13:06] see a smitten Rock he said he failed to
[1:13:09] see a blast serpent he failed to see the
[1:13:12] pillar of fire and he tried to judge
[1:13:15] them from a moral standpoint and he
[1:13:18] failed to see the higher calling of God
[1:13:21] now by grace and election that were the
[1:13:23] line they were in with God's word and
[1:13:26] when he wanted to curse them God said
[1:13:28] don't you do it they are mine leave them
[1:13:32] alone don't you touch
[1:13:34] them amen now of course amen that balam
[1:13:38] should have knew by scripture that he
[1:13:40] couldn't curse them amen because
[1:13:42] according to the Bible in Genesis
[1:13:44] chapter 14 when Abraham amen went out
[1:13:47] and saved lot who was the Grand was the
[1:13:50] father of this country when he went and
[1:13:52] saved him MDC met Abraham on the road
[1:13:55] back amen I'll tell you thank God for
[1:13:58] that story of meadii Amen it's when God
[1:14:01] took on the Flesh and talked with
[1:14:02] Abraham amen the scripture says in
[1:14:05] Genesis 14 and when MDC king of Salem
[1:14:08] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[1:14:10] the most the priest of the most high God
[1:14:13] now now he brought forth Bread and Wine
[1:14:15] now you got to ask yourself where he got
[1:14:17] it where did he get the bread and wine
[1:14:19] that he brought now I don't have time to
[1:14:21] teach all these things but I'm just
[1:14:22] going to say them amen they're about to
[1:14:24] have communion right there on the road
[1:14:27] amen so they're going to have a feast
[1:14:28] and it's called mdc's Feast because it
[1:14:31] was a communion that Abraham was having
[1:14:35] with God when God brought his own bread
[1:14:38] now now y'all know the word is the bread
[1:14:41] and in this evening time when the church
[1:14:44] is going to have communion with God it
[1:14:47] wasn't what the church was bringing it
[1:14:49] was what God was bringing mdct has
[1:14:53] returned in this age and he brought the
[1:14:56] bread for supper brother amen in
[1:14:58] Revelation chapter 3 he said behold I
[1:15:00] stand the door and knock and if any man
[1:15:02] open up and I will come in and S with
[1:15:04] him brother manam said he'll come and
[1:15:06] have supper with him amen he'll have
[1:15:08] communion with him and the bread we're
[1:15:11] about to eat comes from meadi and thank
[1:15:14] God he brought the wine with him amen
[1:15:17] and that wine is a stimulation of the
[1:15:19] revelation of almighty God when you sat
[1:15:22] down to have supper with B CID amen you
[1:15:25] can have a stimulation of the revelation
[1:15:28] of the word that he brings into the
[1:15:30] Church of the Living God I don't know
[1:15:32] about y'all but I don't believe in no
[1:15:34] dead letters and I don't don't believe
[1:15:36] in no dead meetings amen I'd like to see
[1:15:39] the Holy Ghost have power and Liberty
[1:15:42] when it comes into the Church of God do
[1:15:45] you see it was the priest of the most
[1:15:47] high God now that word the most high God
[1:15:50] actually is in the Hebrew it's called L
[1:15:52] Elon it's a it's a it's a Hebrew title
[1:15:55] for God like Jehovah Gyra or Jehovah RFA
[1:15:58] this is L Elon which it means there is
[1:16:01] no God higher than this God wo brother
[1:16:06] let me tell you Amen in other words the
[1:16:08] big God blessed him that there was
[1:16:11] nobody above this guy to bless them now
[1:16:15] look if you're blessed of someone amen
[1:16:18] and there's somebody over them then they
[1:16:20] can come by and bless you and the person
[1:16:23] bigger than them can come by and he can
[1:16:25] redirect it or he can curse you or he
[1:16:28] can change it but when Abraham received
[1:16:30] a blessing from the most high God
[1:16:34] there's nobody bigger than that God
[1:16:37] there is no system there is no
[1:16:39] denomination there is no church there's
[1:16:41] no Pastor there is no false prophets
[1:16:44] there is nothing higher than that God
[1:16:47] that met Abraham and blessed him and I
[1:16:50] say this tonight the Bible said he
[1:16:52] blessed Abram of the most high god
[1:16:54] possessor of Heaven and Earth and
[1:16:55] blessed him amen which he delivered into
[1:16:58] the hands of thine enemies and he gave
[1:17:00] him tithe of all so he was the Blessed
[1:17:02] now I say that because balam has been
[1:17:05] hired to curse them when God had already
[1:17:08] blessed them amen and the Bible said the
[1:17:11] most high God blessed them in Genesis 12
[1:17:14] the Bible said the Lord said to Abram
[1:17:16] get out of the country and from thy
[1:17:18] Kindred and from thy father's house and
[1:17:20] unto a land which I will show thee and I
[1:17:23] will make thee a great nation and bless
[1:17:24] the and make he a great name and thou
[1:17:26] shalt be a blessing and I will bless
[1:17:28] them that bless thee and I will curse
[1:17:30] them that curseth thee and in th shall
[1:17:33] all the families of the earth be blessed
[1:17:36] now God was going to bless them and
[1:17:39] there ain't nothing that can curse them
[1:17:41] listen I thank God tonight to know this
[1:17:43] folks amen that when God blesses you
[1:17:46] there ain't nothing that can turn the
[1:17:49] blessing of God into the curse of God
[1:17:52] God blesses a person or a people and
[1:17:56] that is an irreversible blessing that
[1:17:59] comes from almighty God in Numbers
[1:18:02] chapter 24 in verse one the Bible said
[1:18:04] it like this that BAC and balam brought
[1:18:06] unto him into the high places of Baal
[1:18:09] that he might must see the utmost parts
[1:18:11] of the people now one place he took them
[1:18:13] was the high place of Baal so in other
[1:18:15] words he took ba took balum he took him
[1:18:18] by the hand and said come up here on
[1:18:20] this high place where we worship Baal so
[1:18:22] that you can see Israel from the Heathen
[1:18:25] point of view amen and I'll tell you if
[1:18:28] you can get people looking at the church
[1:18:30] through the Heathen point of view amen
[1:18:33] they look pretty rough amen they look
[1:18:36] like Heretics and crazy people amen so
[1:18:39] let's take them up here High where we
[1:18:42] can look at them like this amen do you
[1:18:44] see the Bible actually says he took them
[1:18:46] in the field the field of Soo which is
[1:18:49] there up where he built seven altars and
[1:18:52] the scripture tells us this is where the
[1:18:54] Watchers were or the watchtowers so they
[1:18:56] would take he took balum around let's
[1:18:59] just put it this way in three different
[1:19:01] places to see the children of God
[1:19:04] because see he was trying to give him a
[1:19:07] perception of what he was looking at he
[1:19:10] was trying to convince balum that you
[1:19:13] can curse them because you see this and
[1:19:16] because this is there and and because
[1:19:18] this is there you can lay the curse
[1:19:20] there but I thank God Amen how that
[1:19:22] balum received of the Lord amen when
[1:19:25] balum was told to the Lord whatever you
[1:19:27] do you can't curse this people and he
[1:19:30] come back and prophesied three times and
[1:19:32] then all three prophecies you must know
[1:19:35] how balum B felt when balam began to
[1:19:38] prophesy because when he looked upon
[1:19:40] them I love it in in numbers 23 and 19
[1:19:43] balam says to them he says listen God is
[1:19:46] not a man that he should lie neither the
[1:19:49] son of man that he should repent hath he
[1:19:51] said and shall not do it or hath he
[1:19:53] spoken and shall he not make it good now
[1:19:56] God wanted to remind those people that
[1:19:58] he wasn't like a man because a man can
[1:20:01] be persuaded and a man can be influenced
[1:20:05] this way and that way and this way and
[1:20:08] that way but see God is not a man can
[1:20:11] can I say he's an unchanging God and God
[1:20:14] don't change his mind about his children
[1:20:17] he don't even you're not going to get up
[1:20:19] in the morning and God say oh never mind
[1:20:21] I changed my mind because he's a god and
[1:20:25] the Bible said he changes not he's not a
[1:20:28] man that somebody can talk him out of it
[1:20:31] he's not a man and so fickle amen I
[1:20:34] thank God tonight to old brother Matt
[1:20:35] ain't nobody ain't got nothing they can
[1:20:38] tell God that's going to change his mind
[1:20:40] about what he thinks about
[1:20:42] me because he's already declared it in
[1:20:45] the word of God and the word is sure and
[1:20:49] steadfast and forever God is not a man
[1:20:52] that he should lie neither the son of
[1:20:54] man that he should
[1:20:56] repent y forgive me I'm going to have to
[1:20:58] lose this jacket amen but uh uh amen
[1:21:02] feel pretty good in here tonight don't
[1:21:03] he somebody shout hallelujah ain't you
[1:21:06] glad that God's not a man ain't you glad
[1:21:09] he don't change every morning ain't you
[1:21:12] glad that nobody can talk him into or
[1:21:15] talk him out of Amen you know why
[1:21:17] because the Bible said in the very next
[1:21:19] verse behold I've received a commandment
[1:21:21] to bless and he blessed and I can not
[1:21:25] reverse
[1:21:27] it well I wish I had the voice of a
[1:21:30] million Angels when God blesses of
[1:21:32] people there ain't nothing can reverse
[1:21:35] it come on we're not playing Uno church
[1:21:38] we don't have no reverse cards we don't
[1:21:40] have another part of the story we don't
[1:21:43] have something else that we can bring up
[1:21:45] and say oh never mind God made a mistake
[1:21:49] God don't make mistakes and when God
[1:21:52] makes a choice that choice is before the
[1:21:55] foundation of the world Hallelujah
[1:21:58] before there were time there was
[1:22:00] eternity and what God done for you and
[1:22:03] me he done in eternity and there ain't
[1:22:06] nothing in time that can change what was
[1:22:09] happening in
[1:22:11] eternity behold I received a commandment
[1:22:14] to bless and he has blessed and he
[1:22:16] cannot reverse it he cannot reverse it
[1:22:21] I'm glad to know that this is an
[1:22:23] irreversible blessing in now somebody
[1:22:25] said well that's just the Old Testament
[1:22:27] then why did Paul say it in Romans the
[1:22:29] 8th chapter that I am persuaded this is
[1:22:31] my perception that neither death nor
[1:22:34] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:22:38] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:22:41] come there is not height or death or any
[1:22:44] creature that is able to separate me
[1:22:46] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:22:49] Jesus our lord that's why balam would
[1:22:51] say in numbers 23 and 23 surely there is
[1:22:55] no enchantment against Jacob neither is
[1:22:58] there any divination against Israel
[1:23:01] according to this time it shall be said
[1:23:02] of Jacob what hath God rought in other
[1:23:06] words I know we're coming on to I know
[1:23:07] we're coming on to devil season around
[1:23:09] here in Halloween and he witches
[1:23:11] everywhere I don't know why a bunch of
[1:23:13] Christian people get into a bunch of
[1:23:15] paganism but anyhow the devils are
[1:23:17] coming out in just a few days but I got
[1:23:19] news for the devil before you get to
[1:23:21] your Halloween I had a day at Cal
[1:23:25] before you get to your curses and your
[1:23:27] spells and your black magic God has
[1:23:30] already blessed me I know what I'm
[1:23:33] talking about I stood there in India
[1:23:35] when they tried to cast spells on me but
[1:23:38] the power of God would put it right back
[1:23:41] into the face of them because God who is
[1:23:44] rich in Mercy has the power to bless in
[1:23:47] the face of the
[1:23:49] curse you ain't going to change it you
[1:23:53] ain't going to change it you ain't you
[1:23:55] ain't going to reverse this amen there
[1:23:57] ain't no enchantment there's no witchery
[1:24:00] there's no there's no amount of talking
[1:24:02] about it to reverse what God had done
[1:24:06] I'll tell you why because in numbers 23
[1:24:08] and 23 21 he says it he hath not beheld
[1:24:12] the iniquity in
[1:24:14] Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness
[1:24:17] in Israel the Lord his God is with him
[1:24:22] and the shout of the king is is in the
[1:24:25] camp now what's that mean it means he
[1:24:29] hath not beheld iniquity now to some
[1:24:32] that would mean that balam looked them
[1:24:34] over and didn't find nothing wrong but
[1:24:36] that's actually opposite to what the
[1:24:38] prophet said about it he said brother
[1:24:40] bandam said it like this there was not
[1:24:43] one thing morally that Israel was not
[1:24:46] guilty of at that very time but God
[1:24:49] didn't behold the iniquity in Jacob and
[1:24:52] he didn't see the pro veress in Israel
[1:24:56] now now I'll just say it like this I'll
[1:24:58] take the Greek word behold Heen from the
[1:25:00] English there it means to look at or to
[1:25:03] regard it means to pay attention to or
[1:25:06] to consider it he did not regard the
[1:25:10] iniquity in Israel it's not that there
[1:25:12] was an iniquity to see it's just God
[1:25:15] wouldn't look at it I tell you amen I
[1:25:18] thank God tonight to know amen that he
[1:25:21] have favored Israel and he have favored
[1:25:23] the BL do y'all know that do you know
[1:25:25] God has favorites sir sir you think what
[1:25:29] you want to but he does it's kind of
[1:25:31] like going to school and and there's a
[1:25:34] y'all y'all ain't I know y'all remember
[1:25:35] this when was you old enough to remember
[1:25:37] when they put stars and they put check
[1:25:39] marks and they put your name if he in
[1:25:41] trouble Joe you name one on the board
[1:25:42] and then check there next to it in
[1:25:44] trouble amen y'all y'all probably
[1:25:46] remember that and there was always that
[1:25:48] class favorite in there that they was in
[1:25:50] the middle of everything we did too but
[1:25:53] the teach never said nothing about it
[1:25:56] and it just it just gried me because
[1:25:59] they done the same thing I did Nisha was
[1:26:02] always as mean as I was amen did
[1:26:04] everything I did but there was no
[1:26:07] iniquity beheld in
[1:26:10] her y'all know what I'm talking
[1:26:13] about I have hit Grandpa's status I Now
[1:26:17] understand that scripture I wonder what
[1:26:21] what are you whipping on my grandson for
[1:26:23] he ain't done a thing but mama sees it
[1:26:27] and daddy sees it but old Papa he'll see
[1:26:30] a thing that baby does because he don't
[1:26:32] behold the iniquity amen I'm not saying
[1:26:36] God is a do old grandpa I'm saying that
[1:26:39] he has produced a blood that he can look
[1:26:41] upon the same thing that you're looking
[1:26:43] upon but he don't see it the way you see
[1:26:46] it and the battle tonight is how do you
[1:26:50] look at your life how do you look at
[1:26:52] your church how do you look at the
[1:26:55] things of God it's a battle for
[1:26:58] perception he don't regard it because he
[1:27:01] didn't see it he did not it the word see
[1:27:04] here actually is raw raw and it's a
[1:27:07] Hebrew word which means he did not look
[1:27:09] at it he did not inspect it he did not
[1:27:12] perceive it he did not consider
[1:27:17] it perverseness means the trouble the
[1:27:22] Mischief the the toil the labor God
[1:27:26] didn't see
[1:27:28] it bik seen it balam seen it God didn't
[1:27:33] see it you see here's the beauty of it
[1:27:35] balum could be taken by Bic to review to
[1:27:39] see the problem but God had Moses where
[1:27:42] he could see the right he could see the
[1:27:44] blessing he could see the atonement he
[1:27:47] could see the blast serpent he could see
[1:27:50] the pillar of fire now there isn't
[1:27:52] anything that could be done because God
[1:27:55] didn't conceive the iniquity in Jacob I
[1:27:58] don't I don't see it can you imagine God
[1:28:01] refusing to look at
[1:28:03] it I love that God refusing to look at
[1:28:08] it now look what he done he he he saw
[1:28:13] the atonement that he placed there he
[1:28:15] saw the smitten rock that he put there
[1:28:19] because see God was high enough to see
[1:28:23] it from the right right
[1:28:25] perspective I've heard people say well
[1:28:28] brother Brandon was wrong on this and
[1:28:29] brother random was wrong on that and I
[1:28:31] said well you just ain't got high enough
[1:28:34] yet you ever get high enough you'll see
[1:28:36] it the way God sees it and you'll look
[1:28:38] at it all together
[1:28:41] different you see because you got to get
[1:28:44] higher that's what Jesus did when he by
[1:28:47] the cross see he climbed to the ramp
[1:28:51] parts of Glory to set upon the throne of
[1:28:53] God to get there he could only get there
[1:28:57] by the cross he had to climb to the
[1:29:00] throne of God by the cross and he
[1:29:03] climbed high enough oh God he climbed
[1:29:06] high enough that he got blood in his
[1:29:09] eyes and when he looked at the people he
[1:29:12] didn't see it the way it was he saw it
[1:29:15] the way he destined it to be I'm talking
[1:29:18] about God tonight I'm talking about a
[1:29:20] god that is able when now now I I I I I
[1:29:24] I won't just move through this amen so
[1:29:27] what what the blessing that came through
[1:29:29] perception it was David that cried it in
[1:29:32] Psalms 32 when he said blessed is he
[1:29:35] whose transgressions is
[1:29:39] Forgiven blessing right blessed is he
[1:29:43] the blessing of Abraham the blessing is
[1:29:46] he who sins is covered now look I don't
[1:29:50] care what kind of car you drove to this
[1:29:52] meeting you're blessed amen it really
[1:29:55] doesn't matter how much money you got in
[1:29:57] your pocket you're blessed it doesn't
[1:30:00] matter if you had to crawl in that back
[1:30:02] more listen if God looks at you and does
[1:30:06] not behold your iniquities you are
[1:30:08] blessed you are just blessed of God
[1:30:11] because he has not marked the iniquity
[1:30:14] against
[1:30:15] you Psalms 32 he says that whose sin is
[1:30:18] covered in the second verses blessed is
[1:30:20] the man whom the Lord imputeth not
[1:30:23] iniquity means count don't mean it
[1:30:25] wasn't there and I I don't have time to
[1:30:27] preach all these words but just to get
[1:30:28] it in your mind it means you got $1,000
[1:30:31] in your front pocket but your bank says
[1:30:33] you're
[1:30:34] overdrawn the bank don't count it till
[1:30:37] you put it in the bank now you might had
[1:30:40] all kinds of iniquity but it don't count
[1:30:43] in heaven because God in the place of
[1:30:47] sin he put in your account the blood and
[1:30:50] righteousness of Jesus Christ so my oh
[1:30:54] God so my account is full of his
[1:30:58] presence now watch blessed is the man
[1:31:00] whom the Lord puth not iniquity whose
[1:31:02] Spirit there is no
[1:31:04] God I've always been blessed by reading
[1:31:06] this when I read when I read in the book
[1:31:09] of of Romans the fourth chapter and and
[1:31:12] I start reading about Apostle Paul and
[1:31:14] Paul then begins to talk about Abraham
[1:31:17] in Romans 4:1 and he says listen what
[1:31:19] shall we say Abraham Our Father
[1:31:21] pertaining the flesh have found If
[1:31:23] Abraham will justif ified by works he
[1:31:24] was for the glory before God but what
[1:31:27] saith the scripture Abraham believed God
[1:31:29] and it was counted unto him for
[1:31:31] righteousness now listen it was counted
[1:31:34] unto him for righteousness do you know
[1:31:37] that the Bible tells us that Abraham
[1:31:39] didn't even stagger at the promises of
[1:31:42] God through
[1:31:43] unbelief now listen how many Bible
[1:31:45] readers I got in here tonight if you've
[1:31:48] read the story of Genesis you read where
[1:31:51] Abraham was talking to the ab to the
[1:31:53] Angel and he fell down laughing at the
[1:31:57] Angel's suggestion of having a child in
[1:32:00] his old age he didn't only stagger mat
[1:32:03] he fell on the ground amen but the Bible
[1:32:06] when it was recorded by Apostle Paul he
[1:32:09] said he never staggered it didn't say he
[1:32:11] didn't fall it said he never staggered
[1:32:14] because God wrote a Divine commentary
[1:32:17] himself he changed the perspective of
[1:32:21] how you viewed Abraham by the blood I I
[1:32:25] I know I know that it's a very it's a
[1:32:27] very uh a very powerful thought amen but
[1:32:30] that one page between the new and the
[1:32:32] Old Testament was everything just on one
[1:32:35] side of that page Abraham was a was a
[1:32:38] liar amen Abraham fell staggering
[1:32:42] laughing at God but on the other side of
[1:32:44] this page in this new covenant the blood
[1:32:48] rewrote the story and there's not a
[1:32:50] record of it in the New Testament
[1:32:53] Hallelujah ain't you glad tonight to
[1:32:55] know that God is writing a commentary
[1:32:59] and the commentary he wrote he wrote
[1:33:01] before the foundations of the
[1:33:04] world well glory to
[1:33:08] God it don't mean much until you start
[1:33:11] looking at who's writing it this is Paul
[1:33:14] who killed some Christians and was
[1:33:16] persecuting them he's the Seed of
[1:33:19] Abraham and now in Romans 4 he's telling
[1:33:22] them bless blessed is a man blessed is
[1:33:26] Paul I'm a blessed man because of the
[1:33:28] Seed of Abraham that God have not
[1:33:33] counted God had not
[1:33:36] counted amen now listen God had not
[1:33:39] counted when David described this Amen
[1:33:42] in Romans 4:7 Paul says that blessed are
[1:33:44] these who iniquities are forgiven whose
[1:33:45] sins are covered and blessed is the man
[1:33:48] whom the Lord will not impute sin
[1:33:54] blessed is the man whom the Lord won't
[1:33:57] count it was a Divine commentary it was
[1:33:59] God's way brother B said it he said all
[1:34:01] the mistakes that he made he said but
[1:34:04] God only saw what he was trying to
[1:34:07] do now if you say well brother Wayne I
[1:34:09] got saved I ain't subject to mistakes no
[1:34:11] more I'm sorry for you brother B says it
[1:34:14] like that he said the very nature of God
[1:34:16] is in you but you're still subject to
[1:34:19] mistakes but God can't see it perception
[1:34:23] now you see all your mistakes and really
[1:34:26] we see all one another's mistakes but
[1:34:29] the Bible through a prophet's vision is
[1:34:31] saying God don't see it because it's
[1:34:34] covered by the blood it's not just that
[1:34:38] it went away God covered it by the blood
[1:34:41] God on purpose did away with it that he
[1:34:45] might leave the word upon your life look
[1:34:48] it's through the blood it's not even
[1:34:50] imputed God does not impute anything
[1:34:52] that's done to you because you're under
[1:34:54] the blood and he don't see
[1:34:56] it I'm talking about perception now he
[1:35:00] don't see it when you start looking at
[1:35:03] this here's a prophet says it like this
[1:35:06] when I'm praying he just hears my voice
[1:35:09] through the blood he don't see me he
[1:35:14] hears my
[1:35:16] voice well my goodness if you're sitting
[1:35:20] here tonight and you've been wanting to
[1:35:22] talk to God but there all these things
[1:35:24] that you're worried about him seeing
[1:35:26] amen then get out from under your
[1:35:28] perception and come under the shed blood
[1:35:32] of Jesus Christ where you can speak
[1:35:34] through the blood and the father only
[1:35:37] hears the voice he does
[1:35:40] not oh come on church amen amen do you
[1:35:43] really believe what I'm preaching to you
[1:35:44] tonight do you really believe that God
[1:35:47] can't see it some of you been wanting to
[1:35:49] talk to him some of you been wanting to
[1:35:51] praise him some of you been wanting to
[1:35:53] let you You' been wanting to let him
[1:35:54] know what you really thought about him
[1:35:56] but sin has condemned you I say tonight
[1:35:59] to them that are in Christ we are now
[1:36:02] under no condemnation amen we've got a
[1:36:05] Liberty tonight to be able to stand
[1:36:07] under that blood and speak back to
[1:36:10] God well glory to God the Bible says it
[1:36:14] in the Book of Micah the 17th 7th verse
[1:36:16] he will turn again he will have
[1:36:19] compassion upon us he will subdue our
[1:36:21] iniquities thou has cast the sins into
[1:36:24] the depths of the sea when God takes
[1:36:27] away sin he takes away the guilts of sin
[1:36:30] and when he takes away sin he takes away
[1:36:32] the power of sin that made you do
[1:36:35] it that it may not rule over you no more
[1:36:39] I'm glad tonight ain't you that he took
[1:36:41] the power of it that would rule when God
[1:36:44] did it according to my Bible in Jeremiah
[1:36:46] chapter 50 in verse 20 the Bible says
[1:36:49] amen of course I'm sorry I'm in the Book
[1:36:51] of Micah he said that he actually cast
[1:36:53] it into the sea he didn't put it on the
[1:36:56] shore he cast it in the sea you know
[1:37:00] what that means it means basically that
[1:37:03] if somebody come by looking for it they
[1:37:05] can't find
[1:37:07] it if something mes up the edge when you
[1:37:11] throw it in later maybe the water goes
[1:37:13] down and somebody finds it but when he
[1:37:16] cast it he cast it far enough that with
[1:37:19] the fluctuating of time amen that God
[1:37:22] put it in a place that it can no longer
[1:37:24] be found let me read the Bible to you
[1:37:26] Jeremiah 50:2 it said in those days and
[1:37:29] in that time the iniquity of Israel
[1:37:31] shall be sought for and there shall be
[1:37:33] none and the Saints signs of sins of
[1:37:36] Judah and they shall not be found look
[1:37:40] at this there is going to be people
[1:37:42] looking for the sins of Israel and they
[1:37:44] can't find
[1:37:46] them oh brother when God put your sins
[1:37:51] in the sea he did something so nobody
[1:37:54] could find them I love this when I think
[1:37:57] about it because the Bible said amen
[1:37:59] that there is none like
[1:38:03] thee you know the second Samuel said it
[1:38:05] there is none like thee there is no God
[1:38:08] like thee there is nobody like thee amen
[1:38:12] Micah says it who is a god like unto
[1:38:15] thee now he could have said Des he could
[1:38:17] have said amen who's the god like thee
[1:38:20] that creates worlds who's the god like
[1:38:23] the I can put the stars in the heaven
[1:38:26] hang the moon in his place and and
[1:38:28] spread the trees and give life to the
[1:38:31] pled but that wasn't what he said he
[1:38:33] said who is a god like the that can
[1:38:36] pardon the iniquity oh God it takes a
[1:38:40] God to Pardon a man it takes the most
[1:38:44] high to Pardon a man you can't just Pard
[1:38:47] I don't know if you hear me you can't
[1:38:49] pardon
[1:38:50] yourself and I can't pardon you somebody
[1:38:54] bigger than me has to do
[1:38:56] it my goodness it takes a great big God
[1:39:00] to Pardon somebody kind of like being
[1:39:02] over there in the county jail and one
[1:39:04] jail bird looks over to the other and
[1:39:06] say hey you're pardoned well whoopy
[1:39:10] do whoopdee doo amen I tell you what it
[1:39:14] don't matter what they say there's no
[1:39:16] pardon because they don't have the power
[1:39:19] of Pardon but our God has the power to
[1:39:23] pardon the sins of a man for my Bible
[1:39:27] said to he that the son sets free he is
[1:39:31] free
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:35] indeed he said brother Wayne what are
[1:39:37] you talking about I'm talking about your
[1:39:39] Eternal destination does not lie on what
[1:39:42] you see and hear but your Eternal
[1:39:45] destination lies on how you perceive or
[1:39:49] discern what you hear and see it's not
[1:39:52] what you hear and see that determines
[1:39:54] you it's how you perceive it it's how
[1:39:57] you receive it amen the pardoning blood
[1:40:00] of Jesus can either it can either give
[1:40:02] you Liberty amen or it can take Liberty
[1:40:05] because it's the power of the blood now
[1:40:07] when people begin to look on this people
[1:40:09] can look on you they can look on the
[1:40:11] message they can look at things and they
[1:40:13] can discern it but you know people's
[1:40:15] discernment can be
[1:40:17] wrong amen people's discernment can be
[1:40:20] wrong they can look at something and
[1:40:22] they can say it's good when it's bad and
[1:40:25] they look at something that's bad and
[1:40:27] they can say it's good and vice versa
[1:40:30] can I can I say today we have
[1:40:33] got
[1:40:34] multi-millions of people trying to tell
[1:40:37] us what is good and what is bad let me
[1:40:41] say this Hollywood is not qualified to
[1:40:44] tell us what is good and what is bad
[1:40:49] Hollywood is not qualified church amen
[1:40:51] they cannot determine to us what is good
[1:40:55] and what is bad oh I know we got these
[1:40:57] football stars and everybody worships
[1:40:59] after them I know they can carry a pig
[1:41:02] skin across the field but they ain't got
[1:41:04] character for nothing come on they don't
[1:41:07] ah well we might as well preach there
[1:41:09] ain't no character in that and you make
[1:41:11] a hero out of that Heathen and then he's
[1:41:14] trying to tell your boy what's good and
[1:41:16] what's bad and what's good he's not
[1:41:20] qualified come on Church it takes
[1:41:23] character to qualify to bring
[1:41:26] judgment there is a high God that brings
[1:41:29] judgment let me let me just bring you
[1:41:31] simple scripture in John chapter 3 my
[1:41:33] Bible tells me Nicodemus the highest of
[1:41:36] the religion of that day went to Jesus
[1:41:39] and they said Master amen Master tell me
[1:41:42] what can a man do to be born again and
[1:41:45] he looked at him and he says he said he
[1:41:47] must enter his mother's or he must be
[1:41:50] born again and he took it he perceived
[1:41:52] it as I got to go back in my mother's
[1:41:55] womb look at the perception that he had
[1:41:58] of the word of God he was a carnal man
[1:42:01] with carnal thinking and he was the one
[1:42:05] making judgments on who Jesus
[1:42:08] was come on church he was not able to
[1:42:11] discern the word he was not able to tell
[1:42:14] the people what was right and wrong he
[1:42:16] had never had a new
[1:42:19] birth now hey you hey the Bible says it
[1:42:23] Jesus said unto them he said a man can't
[1:42:26] even see the kingdom of God unless he's
[1:42:29] been born again unless a man has a new
[1:42:32] birth he's living in this Kingdom of
[1:42:34] America he's living in the kingdoms of
[1:42:36] the world and he is judging things from
[1:42:39] that kind of Kingdom but God's word is
[1:42:42] his kingdom and may I say to you today
[1:42:45] we have received the kingdom of God that
[1:42:48] is not shaken but it remaineth in the
[1:42:51] face of Hollywood in the face of
[1:42:53] denomination in the face of trouble God
[1:42:56] has given us a kingdom his kingdom is
[1:42:58] his
[1:43:00] word amen unless a man is born again he
[1:43:03] can't even see the kingdom of God now
[1:43:06] sometimes people don't have the right
[1:43:10] discernment because they're not born
[1:43:13] again and you're going to let somebody
[1:43:15] tell you about brother brandham you're
[1:43:17] going to let some devil on some some
[1:43:19] YouTube or some deu you're going to let
[1:43:23] this them tell you about the prophet of
[1:43:25] God well I tell you what I do if I was
[1:43:28] you I'd have them ask me a few questions
[1:43:30] and answer them first who was it that
[1:43:32] raised the Dead who was it that caused
[1:43:34] the lame to walk who was it that caused
[1:43:36] the blind to see who was it who was it
[1:43:40] that could stand there in those Miracle
[1:43:42] lines one after the other who could
[1:43:44] create squirrels who could speak the
[1:43:46] storms it wasn't the man Willam brother
[1:43:50] it was a manifestation of the son of man
[1:43:53] the ministry of Jesus Christ oh you can
[1:43:56] discern the skies but what about the
[1:44:00] signs the
[1:44:02] times look upon this message amen
[1:44:05] because of unconverted men judging this
[1:44:08] message there are many men who found
[1:44:10] influence it's a battle of
[1:44:14] perception oh brother Wayne he made a
[1:44:16] mistake but is it one God
[1:44:22] all
[1:44:26] Hallelujah well I could preach a while
[1:44:30] there I'm a message preacher
[1:44:33] folks look I know where I came
[1:44:36] from I know where I was when God you
[1:44:40] most of you people satting here knew me
[1:44:42] before this message you knew the path I
[1:44:45] was on you knew where I was headed you
[1:44:47] know what I would be tonight if I was
[1:44:50] alive but God rich and mercy put a
[1:44:53] message in my life and as long as there
[1:44:57] is breath in my body I will defend this
[1:45:01] word because it comes from
[1:45:08] God you go on and follow Some
[1:45:10] unconverted Devil if you want
[1:45:14] to the battle's influence who's going to
[1:45:17] influence who's going to cause your
[1:45:20] perception come on now now you view
[1:45:22] Donald Trump a certain way if you watch
[1:45:24] CNN and a whole bunch of you view him a
[1:45:27] different way from Fox News same guy
[1:45:29] same
[1:45:30] thing Fox News he can't do no wrong CNN
[1:45:34] if he coughed there's something wrong
[1:45:36] with that it's perception and they have
[1:45:39] taken this message under the perception
[1:45:42] of carnal unborn unconverted devils
[1:45:49] and I know what life is
[1:45:53] life ain't sucking a cigarette and a
[1:45:55] woman running around bars at night
[1:45:57] somebody said well I can do what I want
[1:45:58] I'm free you're not free don't you dare
[1:46:01] tell me you're free and smoking on
[1:46:03] cigarettes there was a dollar a pack and
[1:46:05] then there were $3 a pack and you said
[1:46:07] you would quit before they got five but
[1:46:09] now they're seven and if they turn a $30
[1:46:12] and they cost you lung cancer you'll
[1:46:14] still do it because you are bound by a
[1:46:18] devil but you don't have to be bound
[1:46:21] tonight there is a God that can deliver
[1:46:24] you by the power of
[1:46:28] God I know I'm talk oh they said well
[1:46:31] we're free you ain't
[1:46:32] free you ain't free pull a pair of pants
[1:46:37] on I borrow David S hey they can see the
[1:46:40] pul through it some some woman out there
[1:46:44] your body showing off like that and the
[1:46:46] Bible said a man that looks upon her had
[1:46:48] committed adultery with her brother man
[1:46:49] said you'll be judged for it if he never
[1:46:51] even touched you but the denomination
[1:46:54] can't preach
[1:46:55] it they can't preach it amen and
[1:46:58] unconverted men can't preach it because
[1:47:00] it's in their own homes their wives are
[1:47:03] wearing
[1:47:04] makeup they can't preach this message
[1:47:07] they've got to find something WR with it
[1:47:09] because the message condemns them oh but
[1:47:12] if they would just get under the message
[1:47:15] there is life and there's liberty and
[1:47:18] it's a covering
[1:47:22] it's see it's getting under the
[1:47:27] word now you say preacher what are you
[1:47:29] saying I I want I'll just be very
[1:47:32] clearly some people don't have a right
[1:47:34] to tell us what this message
[1:47:37] means they got no opinion on
[1:47:41] it we were just I just listening to
[1:47:43] matth the other night he brought up a
[1:47:44] scripture in Act 7 where it said the
[1:47:46] very same Moses whom you refused is the
[1:47:48] same very Moses God sent by the hand of
[1:47:50] an Angel to judge you
[1:47:53] and the very same Prophet that people
[1:47:55] are turning down and laughing at is the
[1:47:56] very God Amen God anointed that man and
[1:47:59] S him in this age and not only is he a
[1:48:02] prophet but God made him a God to this
[1:48:07] generation it's true somebody said well
[1:48:10] brother Wayne you're really trying to
[1:48:11] lift up brother B no I ain't God did
[1:48:15] that well you're trying to make a
[1:48:17] prophet out of him no I ain't God did
[1:48:20] that and he's a prophet whether you
[1:48:23] think he is or not and he has the word
[1:48:26] of the Lord for this age whether you
[1:48:27] believe it or not and every devil out of
[1:48:30] hell can crawl up out of hell and say it
[1:48:33] ain't true but they know it's
[1:48:37] true well you said preacher what are you
[1:48:39] talking about I'm talking about good
[1:48:41] people following unconverted
[1:48:45] Men what happened to the Bible principle
[1:48:47] of not bringing accusation against an
[1:48:49] elder unless there was two witnesses a
[1:48:50] good report
[1:48:53] what happened to that and y'all sitting
[1:48:55] down and discussing things brother
[1:48:56] brandom did and didn't do with a bunch
[1:48:58] of people dope
[1:49:00] smokers
[1:49:02] adulterers unconverted and you're going
[1:49:04] to discuss a word Prophet to try to
[1:49:07] determine whether you going to believe
[1:49:08] him or not through the course of an
[1:49:11] Internet I tell people when I bring them
[1:49:13] to the message all the time I said now
[1:49:15] when you go look up brother brandom on
[1:49:16] your internet you just go ahead and look
[1:49:17] Jesus up too and if you're going to
[1:49:19] believe what they say about brother bam
[1:49:21] just believe what they say about Jesus
[1:49:22] cuz they call Jesus every dirty name and
[1:49:25] the reason they do it is because it's
[1:49:27] the same
[1:49:31] Ministry well I feel like preaching
[1:49:33] there's got to be a liberty in the house
[1:49:35] of God it's got to come from this
[1:49:37] message it don't come out of my mind or
[1:49:40] my thought or your mind or your thought
[1:49:42] it's God rich in
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:48] Mercy unconverted men judging the
[1:49:50] message judging My Worship unconverted
[1:49:54] men judging My Worship and calling it oh
[1:49:57] they're just Holy Rollers they ain't
[1:49:59] such a
[1:50:00] thing brother B said oh he said if
[1:50:03] you're going to call me a Holy Roller
[1:50:04] I'll call you an Unholy roller
[1:50:07] then what it's perception they said well
[1:50:10] it's a bunch of emotion brother B said
[1:50:12] if you're not converted it's emotion he
[1:50:14] said but if you're God's child it's
[1:50:16] called spiritual blessings and it's
[1:50:18] found in Ephesians the first chapter you
[1:50:21] cannot understand my worship until you
[1:50:24] get converted and you get saved the way
[1:50:27] God saved me you don't know God you
[1:50:31] don't know God till you meet him in the
[1:50:33] Dark Places until you get so low that
[1:50:36] you can't go forward and God shows up in
[1:50:39] the presence of life when there is no
[1:50:41] hope and there is struggles everywhere
[1:50:44] but God meets you there then you'll
[1:50:46] knowing you don't understand me until
[1:50:49] you have tasted of the lily of the
[1:50:51] valley and you can't have have that Lily
[1:50:53] until you get in the valley and you they
[1:50:56] Jo then they understand the Opium then
[1:50:59] they understand how and we can lose
[1:51:01] ourselves in the presence of God because
[1:51:04] God has showed us another side of the
[1:51:11] Gospel you know why people call the
[1:51:13] church
[1:51:15] crazy because they don't have any
[1:51:18] discernment I'm reading a direct quote
[1:51:21] because they don't have discernment it
[1:51:23] he says people say they don't believe
[1:51:26] that the baptism of Holy Ghost is for
[1:51:28] people today he said then I'll have to
[1:51:29] say that your birth was of the wrong
[1:51:32] Spirit they said the Holy Ghost said
[1:51:35] because the promise is unto you and your
[1:51:36] children he said see people are
[1:51:38] accepting it by an intellectual
[1:51:40] conception and they're taking somebody
[1:51:42] else's word for it but they ain't got no
[1:51:44] discernment they can't design between
[1:51:47] right and wrong the Bible said you can't
[1:51:49] call Jesus the Lord except by the Holy
[1:51:51] Ghost
[1:51:53] now what does that mean it means that I
[1:51:55] can say he's Lord and you can say he's
[1:51:57] Lord because I said it and you can say
[1:51:59] what your mom said and you can say what
[1:52:00] your preacher said but you can't say it
[1:52:04] until the Holy Ghost reveals it to you
[1:52:06] that he is Lord and once he has revealed
[1:52:09] it amen do you see brother I'm just
[1:52:12] reading him folks he said I know that's
[1:52:14] that's rough but what we need is
[1:52:16] discernment we need the Discerning by
[1:52:19] the word
[1:52:22] now many are asleep and sickly because
[1:52:27] of a lack of this discernment brother
[1:52:29] bam says it he said it was because of
[1:52:31] this he said it's because of not a
[1:52:33] Discerning the body of the Lord now he
[1:52:35] says it's because that he said now
[1:52:37] that's the last thing that will hit the
[1:52:38] church in the last day is a spiritual
[1:52:40] death he said now but watch I want you
[1:52:43] to know this a long time before death
[1:52:46] comes vultures come from the skies to
[1:52:49] pick out your
[1:52:51] eyeballs what now what does that mean to
[1:52:53] the church it means it comes to take
[1:52:55] your vision brother B now brother B
[1:52:57] ain't no he he ain't no kidding he says
[1:53:00] it like this the buzzards of
[1:53:02] Hell amen pick out your eyes to the
[1:53:06] gospel a long time before physical death
[1:53:10] ever strikes
[1:53:11] you takes away the ability to see the
[1:53:16] gospel now now I I I want to maybe just
[1:53:19] just bring something to your attention
[1:53:21] out a rejected King brother Bram brings
[1:53:23] this up and he said that's what Satan's
[1:53:25] trying to do is to pluck out your sight
[1:53:28] but your spiritual sight and in rejected
[1:53:30] King he brings it up in the book of
[1:53:33] Samuel it's whenever Samuel is being
[1:53:35] rejected by Israel and Saul is becoming
[1:53:39] King now y'all know why Samuel was
[1:53:41] rejected right it wasn't what Samuel
[1:53:44] done amen it wasn't Samuel it was his
[1:53:47] children and the people were rejecting
[1:53:50] Samuel because of his children but when
[1:53:52] God spoke he said Samuel they're not
[1:53:53] rejecting you they're rejecting
[1:53:55] me but the people wanted a king and that
[1:53:58] that was a right in this transition in
[1:54:01] the book of of Samuel you'll find about
[1:54:03] the 11th chapter that there was a a king
[1:54:06] who I think his name was Nash here he
[1:54:09] was the king of Ammon now the reason
[1:54:11] that's important because Ammon was
[1:54:14] another son of lot through his youngest
[1:54:17] daughter so the youngest daughter of lot
[1:54:20] and the oldest daughter of lot was m
[1:54:22] Moab and Ammon and this Ammon decides
[1:54:26] that they're going to take over a part
[1:54:28] of Israel now what they do is they catch
[1:54:30] them in in a low spot and brother Joel
[1:54:33] they went to them and and they saw we're
[1:54:35] going to be overtaken so they said let's
[1:54:37] make a let's make a covenant and Ammon
[1:54:39] said to them I tell you what we'll make
[1:54:42] a covenant with you but we're going to
[1:54:43] take out the right eye of all your
[1:54:46] fighting
[1:54:48] men now brother bam said that was your
[1:54:51] spiritual eye
[1:54:53] that was the ability to
[1:54:55] discern now what that meant in the days
[1:54:58] of Israel was they was they actually
[1:55:00] still was in hand-to-hand combat back
[1:55:02] then and they had a shield and they had
[1:55:04] a sword now if you put out the right eye
[1:55:07] now I'm supposing brother dve Paul most
[1:55:09] of them was
[1:55:11] left-handed now or it was right-handed
[1:55:14] actually because they' hold their sword
[1:55:16] with the right hand and the shield with
[1:55:17] the left hand I've kind of often
[1:55:18] wondered what happened to the
[1:55:19] left-handed people but there might be
[1:55:21] some here tonight the God bless
[1:55:25] you it's supposed to be funny I never
[1:55:29] was good at
[1:55:31] jokes everybody's wonder is he
[1:55:35] joking but they were right-handed so
[1:55:37] they would take a shield in their left
[1:55:40] hand and they would hold that Shield
[1:55:43] over the left eye and half of their face
[1:55:46] would be covered behind that shield for
[1:55:48] protection and with the other hand they
[1:55:50] had a sword so they fought with their
[1:55:53] offensive with a right eye because their
[1:55:56] left eye was just in defense now what
[1:55:59] happens is if you put out that right eye
[1:56:01] they can't carry a sword no more they
[1:56:04] don't know what to strike no more so
[1:56:06] they're always just reacting they're
[1:56:08] always just trying to keep the blows
[1:56:10] they're always just reacting but if
[1:56:12] there a spiritual side in a Believer
[1:56:15] there is a sword of the Lord that a
[1:56:17] Believer carries and he don't only have
[1:56:19] a defensive he has an offensive amen and
[1:56:23] Satan is trying to take the right eye of
[1:56:26] the
[1:56:28] church well I don't know about you but I
[1:56:30] ain't going to make no deal with the
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:34] devil I'm not going to let him take no
[1:56:36] right eye because if you lose the
[1:56:40] ability to see that it's a spiritual
[1:56:43] battle if you lose the spiritual eye
[1:56:47] look you're in trouble folks because
[1:56:50] this is not a carnal battle attle and it
[1:56:53] is not a battle of Flesh and Blood it is
[1:56:56] a spiritual battle and you've got to see
[1:56:59] it for what it is you've got to see it
[1:57:01] for the way things are you've got to
[1:57:03] have a perception of how things are
[1:57:05] happening amen I'll go all the way back
[1:57:07] to Joshua not going to preach on it I
[1:57:09] want it in your mind go back to Joshua
[1:57:11] when he goes up to the walls of Jericho
[1:57:13] and he's going to take the walls of
[1:57:15] Jericho in a battle and somebody appears
[1:57:18] to him it's God that appears unto Joshua
[1:57:22] but he don't know it he says are you for
[1:57:24] me are you against me and he introduces
[1:57:27] himself as the captain of the
[1:57:31] host and when he does oh you talk about
[1:57:35] perception brother his Battle Ground the
[1:57:38] great battle that he was in turned into
[1:57:41] a Holy Ground it turned into a meeting
[1:57:44] place with God it wasn't a battle no
[1:57:46] more it was a communion with God it was
[1:57:49] a time of how to receive the
[1:57:52] instructions of headship that would
[1:57:54] destroy every enemy that was in front of
[1:57:58] them let me say something tonight amen I
[1:58:00] think when God begins to meet with
[1:58:02] people and begins to try to show them
[1:58:04] amen that his word is still true what is
[1:58:07] it it's God sending before the church
[1:58:11] that they might get a perception of the
[1:58:14] battle that they're living in that you
[1:58:16] might be able to see do you see amen I I
[1:58:19] I will say this very clearly this
[1:58:21] message has came to you as a headship of
[1:58:25] the
[1:58:26] church we do not have Bishops to rule
[1:58:31] over our
[1:58:33] churches we do not have a headquarters
[1:58:36] somewhere that rules over our churches
[1:58:40] there is one head and that is the Lord
[1:58:43] Jesus
[1:58:45] Christ he is the head of every man in
[1:58:49] this building come on Church I know
[1:58:52] there's a head to a church amen but
[1:58:54] there is a head to the individual and
[1:58:56] that is Christ and Christ is the head of
[1:58:59] that body now watch when Christ brings
[1:59:02] forth his ministry which is this message
[1:59:05] that it declares his presence upon the
[1:59:08] church and begins to give direction to
[1:59:11] the church that's why we don't call up
[1:59:13] headquarters and ask them well can we
[1:59:15] preach this or can we preach this or we
[1:59:17] can pre listen if brother B said it we
[1:59:19] ought to be able to preach it
[1:59:22] I I know sometime people well brother
[1:59:24] Wayne you can't preach that part of the
[1:59:25] message I have made a determination in
[1:59:27] my mind I think the next time somebody
[1:59:29] tells me that I'm going to take a whole
[1:59:31] series on that
[1:59:33] point I refuse to let the devil dictate
[1:59:36] to me what is preach and not preach in
[1:59:39] the message of the hour it is all preach
[1:59:43] it is the word of God it's Deliverance
[1:59:46] to the age we living
[1:59:49] in now can I say to you very clearly
[1:59:51] there is a a devil do y'all believe that
[1:59:55] y'all believe there's a real devil like

[2:00:03] Devil's up to that devil your adversary
[2:00:07] is here tonight to change your
[2:00:10] perception of the word of
[2:00:12] God Satan would like to take away the
[2:00:16] value and the power of this
[2:00:19] message because he wants you to be
[2:00:22] defenseless he wants you to be armorless
[2:00:25] he does not want you to have weaponry
[2:00:27] come on he wants you to just take
[2:00:29] whatever comes but I'm sorry I'm not
[2:00:33] that kind of a man amen and I don't
[2:00:35] believe this church is that kind of
[2:00:37] church we have a message from God we
[2:00:41] have a value in that message and we know
[2:00:43] what it's for and what it will do now
[2:00:46] listen I believe this tonight I I
[2:00:48] believe I have seen the power of this
[2:00:50] message now I I've watched it I I'll get
[2:00:53] some more into this tomorrow night but
[2:00:54] I'll say this I I have watched the power
[2:00:56] of this message now now I will I will I
[2:00:59] will say this whether I have been in the
[2:01:01] tents in India or whether I had been in
[2:01:03] the Amazon jungles or whether I had been
[2:01:06] in the highrises of Europe or whether I
[2:01:09] had been in Ohio or Arkansas or whether
[2:01:11] I had been all the way over in New
[2:01:13] Mexico Plum over to New England states
[2:01:16] and down to Florida and back up through
[2:01:19] amen all across this world this message
[2:01:22] has power over the devil wherever you
[2:01:25] meet
[2:01:26] him it does not matter what form he's in
[2:01:30] it does not matter how he comes to you
[2:01:33] this message has power to influence
[2:01:36] lives amen now I know that Satan is just
[2:01:39] he's just a Tormentor and he's coming to
[2:01:42] torment you and he's coming to bring
[2:01:45] he's coming to bring influence and his
[2:01:47] influence is to do away with the value
[2:01:52] all right the
[2:01:54] power of this message to try to somehow
[2:01:59] say well you know you know that brother
[2:02:02] bandam I know he said those things but
[2:02:05] they're really not that
[2:02:09] important well I ain't found that one
[2:02:14] yet well I know he was a prophet kind of
[2:02:18] no not kind of he was all together a
[2:02:23] prophet the kind of prophet you don't
[2:02:28] judge the kind of prophet that judges
[2:02:31] you do you see what it is God has a
[2:02:34] method of dealing with the devil y'all
[2:02:35] know what God's method is Satan comes
[2:02:37] now now brother Dave we know Satan comes
[2:02:40] because it's his
[2:02:42] job and and he's good and Satan comes
[2:02:46] but God has a method of dealing with the
[2:02:49] devil now some would say well well you
[2:02:52] deal with him like this and you deal
[2:02:53] with him like this but God has a method
[2:02:56] and the method of God is to cast out the
[2:02:59] devil and how do you cast out the devil
[2:03:02] you cast him out by preaching the word
[2:03:05] of God come on church not the word of
[2:03:08] Luther and not the word of Wesley and
[2:03:11] not the word of
[2:03:13] Pentecost I know what I'm talking about
[2:03:15] I've been I've been to Europe but
[2:03:16] brother Dave you probably been right
[2:03:17] there in Belgium where they had that
[2:03:19] great world war baby David iers and them
[2:03:21] took us over and we stood right there in
[2:03:23] Belgium where Germany had in had
[2:03:26] influenced and come in and tried to take
[2:03:28] over Belgium in the first world war and
[2:03:30] you know what them dudes did then they
[2:03:31] built these big they built these big uh
[2:03:33] uh channels and dug out these big lines
[2:03:36] so that they couldn't get over them and
[2:03:38] the and the Belgium people would would
[2:03:39] hide in them and they would shoot so
[2:03:41] they they kept the attack out of Belgium
[2:03:44] from Germany by these wide ditches amen
[2:03:47] and when the second world war came they
[2:03:50] said well it worked last time it'll this
[2:03:52] time but you know what happened Germany
[2:03:54] went home and refigured and they made
[2:03:56] their tanks long enough they could cross
[2:03:59] them they didn't even last through the
[2:04:00] first day trying to fight with old
[2:04:02] Warfare and if you're trying to fight
[2:04:04] with old Pentecostal ideas you won't
[2:04:07] last your first day you got some more
[2:04:09] Baptist theology you won't watch the
[2:04:11] first day but God has sent a message by
[2:04:15] a strong Angel to defeat the Devil
[2:04:18] anywhere any place anytime under any for
[2:04:22] because he is God rich in Mercy you said
[2:04:25] brother Wayne I don't have any power yes
[2:04:27] you do you have the message of the hour
[2:04:31] it is Atomic Warfare in the mouths of
[2:04:34] the Believers now listen I I know I'm
[2:04:37] going to get long so I'm going to just
[2:04:39] try to close this off now I'll say this
[2:04:41] to you now now we're living in the
[2:04:44] greatest and most wicked of all ages and
[2:04:47] if you're not in a battle you just come
[2:04:49] out of one and if you're not in in one
[2:04:52] you're fishing to be in
[2:04:53] one because it is a battle
[2:04:57] everywhere it's going on in every
[2:05:00] direction battles are everywhere but see
[2:05:03] it is about the perception of the battle
[2:05:07] it's how you're viewing the battle that
[2:05:09] you're in makes the difference how you
[2:05:12] fight in that battle you know I I I I I
[2:05:15] I love the scriptures and and I and I
[2:05:18] know you all are Bible readers one thing
[2:05:20] that I have found through the years is
[2:05:22] that answers there answers everywhere is
[2:05:25] in the scriptures and I was I was
[2:05:27] reading some time ago I had just done a
[2:05:30] series in the book of Ephesians and I
[2:05:32] had I had I don't know how many sermon
[2:05:34] series there is in that but there's a
[2:05:36] lot amen but but I was over there in
[2:05:38] Ephesians 5 and I was coming down
[2:05:40] through Ephesians 5 and I come down to
[2:05:43] where Paul said that he might have a
[2:05:45] church that was spotless without without
[2:05:48] blemish that would be a perfect church
[2:05:50] and and I I spend a little time talking
[2:05:52] about the perfect church now how many of
[2:05:54] you realize that Paul says that he might
[2:05:57] sanctify and Cleanse This Church by the
[2:05:59] washing of a water of his word that he
[2:06:00] might have a spotless blameless church
[2:06:02] now he said that he might have do you
[2:06:03] know that William brandom when he looked
[2:06:05] at the church in invisible union he said
[2:06:08] you are
[2:06:09] now the Spotless virtuous bride that
[2:06:12] what Paul was talking about in the
[2:06:14] future brother Bram brought the future
[2:06:17] present and said you are a fulfillment
[2:06:20] of the vision that Paul was having and
[2:06:23] you are now the Spotless virtuous blood
[2:06:26] of Jesus Christ now now in laboring in
[2:06:29] that I was just looking through that and
[2:06:31] I was laboring a bit and I I went over
[2:06:33] to the next chapter Ephesians chapter 6
[2:06:35] and I love how Paul says it there in
[2:06:37] Ephesians 6 and you amen after you've
[2:06:39] been preaching on about three or four
[2:06:40] months when you finally get to Ephesians
[2:06:42] 6 and you say finally my
[2:06:45] brethren finally my brethren you can see
[2:06:49] Paul has built up to to tell the church
[2:06:52] something and then he comes in the last
[2:06:54] parts of Ephesians and says finally my
[2:06:56] brethren be strong in the Lord and put
[2:06:59] on the power of His might remember he
[2:07:00] starts talking about putting on the
[2:07:01] whole armor of God now now it struck me
[2:07:05] that brother Brandon uses this for the
[2:07:07] greatest battle ever fought and just as
[2:07:09] brother manam comes out to preach the
[2:07:11] battle greatest battle in 1962 he says
[2:07:14] the greatest battle that has ever been
[2:07:15] fought is about to begin
[2:07:18] now and I thought wait a minute it
[2:07:20] wasn't the greatest battle back there
[2:07:23] and it wasn't the greatest battle here
[2:07:24] and it wasn't the great why would the
[2:07:26] prophet now announce the greatest battle
[2:07:30] now and you get to looking at this and
[2:07:33] comparing that whenever Paul says the
[2:07:36] church is perfect the next chapter is
[2:07:39] spiritual battle and when William
[2:07:42] brandom begin to announce Perfection
[2:07:45] upon the church is when the real battle
[2:07:48] of the church really began the prophet
[2:07:51] of God said Prov in this word why would
[2:07:53] God call a bride out of the darkest ages
[2:07:56] that has ever been he said so God could
[2:08:00] prove to the devil that this Eve is not
[2:08:04] like that first Eve that God wanted to
[2:08:07] prove to the devil now I know maybe
[2:08:10] you're sitting here tonight and you're
[2:08:11] going through a great trial in your life
[2:08:12] and you said brother Wayne why am I
[2:08:14] going through this is it some mistake I
[2:08:15] made here or is it some issue I made
[2:08:17] there have you ever thought that it
[2:08:20] might be that God called you
[2:08:23] perfect and that Satan you said Wayne
[2:08:26] where did you get an idea like this I'll
[2:08:27] tell you where I got it you go over to
[2:08:29] the Book of
[2:08:30] Job and it'll give you a sight into the
[2:08:34] invisible battle you're facing right now
[2:08:37] now you might not hear God and the devil
[2:08:39] talking but in the Book of Job you can
[2:08:41] and you can see that God is sitting
[2:08:44] there in heaven and the Devil comes and
[2:08:46] he says to him hey I've been about in
[2:08:49] the earth looking and looking I've been
[2:08:52] I've been looking let me just say it
[2:08:54] like Peter said it I've been looking for
[2:08:55] somebody to
[2:08:57] devour and God said did you try
[2:09:00] job now now I I love this because God
[2:09:03] knew job's
[2:09:07] name God out of all of the millions of
[2:09:10] people on the Earth brother Roy God knew
[2:09:13] Job by first name he said did you try
[2:09:16] job and the devil didn't say he had but
[2:09:19] he did answer it cuz he said you got him
[2:09:21] behind of fence he'd been down there
[2:09:23] checking security system on job's house
[2:09:26] and he knew this is impregnable there's
[2:09:28] no way to break into this house but God
[2:09:31] gave him permission and he said I tell
[2:09:33] you what you can go down there but don't
[2:09:35] take his life because you know what that
[2:09:38] dumb devil had a chance to say he said
[2:09:40] that your worship I mean job's worship
[2:09:43] was so cheap that if I take away from
[2:09:46] him the blessing you gave him he won't
[2:09:49] Worship You No More he called job he he
[2:09:53] act like that God bought job's
[2:09:56] worship and God said I tell you what you
[2:09:59] do you do anything you want to to him
[2:10:01] amen but don't take his life because as
[2:10:04] long as he's got breath I know that
[2:10:07] man's going to praise the Lord and the
[2:10:09] attack begin to come upon his life
[2:10:12] listen church he was not under attack
[2:10:15] because of some secret sin he wasn't
[2:10:18] under attack because of some problem in
[2:10:20] his life life God said he was
[2:10:24] perfect let me say tonight God looked
[2:10:28] upon this church and he began to call
[2:10:30] you perfect and there's going to come a
[2:10:32] battle sister Destiny there's going to
[2:10:34] be a battle the minute God says don't
[2:10:36] take her life you can try her every way
[2:10:39] you want to amen but the Bible tells us
[2:10:42] that job amen when everything come
[2:10:45] against him he fell in the floor and
[2:10:48] began to worship God
[2:10:51] yes you say preacher you spent a long
[2:10:54] time to say this I'm saying change your
[2:10:56] perception the devil can't kill you he
[2:10:59] can try you he can pressure you he can
[2:11:01] push on you but he can't kill you and as
[2:11:04] long as you got breath in your body you
[2:11:06] might as well praise the Lord as long as
[2:11:08] you got life you might as well tell that
[2:11:11] devil Listen My Worship is not cheap I
[2:11:14] may be going through the greatest battle
[2:11:16] I've ever faced in my life but I will
[2:11:19] praise my God in
[2:11:22] how there was a there was a meeting
[2:11:24] going on and a woman said to said to
[2:11:26] brother Brandon said I felt like brother
[2:11:28] Brandon when you was preaching she said
[2:11:29] I felt like jumping up and shouting to
[2:11:31] the rest of the people and brother man
[2:11:33] said well then why didn't you she said
[2:11:35] because every time I started to do that
[2:11:37] said the devil come by and said I wasn't
[2:11:39] worthy to do that and brother man said
[2:11:41] Oh Sister he said that's exactly when
[2:11:43] you should have jumped up and praise the
[2:11:45] Lord she said why is that brother vam he
[2:11:48] said because listen amen it's a
[2:11:50] sacrifice of pray Praise You Got to
[2:11:52] Believe God when you can't believe your
[2:11:54] own body when you can't believe your own
[2:11:56] feelings listen my praise is not
[2:12:00] cheap and when I feel good I'm going to
[2:12:03] praise God but when I feel bad I'm going
[2:12:05] to praise God and when the world is
[2:12:08] against me I'm going to praise God
[2:12:10] because the battle has nothing to do
[2:12:14] with what you have
[2:12:16] done change your perception
[2:12:21] change your perception listen it says in
[2:12:24] Isaiah 54 there is no weapon that is
[2:12:27] formed against you shall
[2:12:31] prosper oh so you know what the devil
[2:12:33] told you he said if you're having battle
[2:12:35] that's not your scripture because you
[2:12:36] got all these problems no look up
[2:12:38] Prosper it means nothing formed against
[2:12:41] you will have its success that whatever
[2:12:44] comes against you oh it's going to come
[2:12:47] but it won't have final success listen
[2:12:50] to me there's a another half in the
[2:12:53] game can I say it like that there's
[2:12:56] another part of this I can Cindy I can
[2:12:58] lose the battle but I ain't W lost no
[2:13:02] war you said well well when I lost the
[2:13:05] first half but but my goodness God has
[2:13:08] given you Grace he didn't take your life
[2:13:12] you can Rise Up from whatever you're in
[2:13:14] and give your life to God
[2:13:17] [Applause]
[2:13:22] Judy I I I mean I I think little things
[2:13:24] click to me and when God told job he
[2:13:27] told the devil don't take his life you
[2:13:29] know what he told him Joseph's Brethren
[2:13:30] when they beat him and they beat him put
[2:13:32] him in the pit now he had a vision he
[2:13:34] was going to rule and when he got put in
[2:13:36] that pit he heard his brother say Amen
[2:13:40] we can beat him but don't take his life
[2:13:43] amen don't take his life you know why
[2:13:47] because Jonathan he was coming out of
[2:13:49] that pit amen amen that was nothing they
[2:13:52] could do to prosper because he was going
[2:13:54] to a throne let me say tonight there
[2:13:57] ain't nothing the devil can do to keep
[2:13:59] this blood out of the Millennium because
[2:14:01] it can't take our life our life is
[2:14:04] eternal and whatever you do you can't
[2:14:07] change what God has already
[2:14:16] done I I I I've not never been much on
[2:14:18] football but I got to tell you a
[2:14:19] football story in closing
[2:14:22] brother Billy Paul brandham told it one
[2:14:24] time it's a powerful
[2:14:25] story I got to tell it for tomorrow
[2:14:30] night brother Billy Paul brother Billy
[2:14:33] Paul brandham told the story he said
[2:14:34] there was a it was a football game a

[2:19:56] can just kick to the side and God could
[2:19:57] go on Amen but he can't forget you he
[2:20:01] can't just go on and leave you he can't

[2:33:06] heart the devil didn't put that there
[2:33:08] God put it there let me tell you why he
[2:33:10] put it there because you belong to him

[2:33:15] keep you from being what God has called

[2:33:26] realize that's what happened to the
[2:33:28] children of Israel when they came to be
[2:33:30] set free it was at the time of their
[2:33:32] Liberty that the prophet Moses walked
[2:33:34] down into Pharaoh's house you know what
[2:33:36] Moses's request was his request was to
[2:33:40] let the people of Israel go and worship
[2:33:43] their God and you know what the when you
[2:33:45] know what Pharaoh said he said they've
[2:33:47] got too much time on their hands if
[2:33:50] you've got time to worship God then I'm
[2:33:52] going to make up something that you can
[2:33:54] do instead so his reply to them was get
[2:33:57] you back to your burden and he went and
[2:33:59] he got around with all his advisors he
[2:34:01] said what can we do to these people to
[2:34:03] keep them from having a desire to
[2:34:05] worship God he said well you can make
[2:34:07] them make more bricks you can make them
[2:34:09] stomp more straw you can give them more
[2:34:11] hours to work and so they came up with a
[2:34:13] plan that at the time of their desire to
[2:34:16] worship God I'll put so much on you that
[2:34:19] you don't have time to think about that
[2:34:20] no
[2:34:21] more but you know what God done he said
[2:34:24] but there's a desire in them people's
[2:34:26] heart to be free and he made he brought
[2:34:29] plagues upon Egypt and he made a way
[2:34:31] that his children wouldn't have to think
[2:34:33] about that no more and everything that
[2:34:36] the devil put on them God took off of
[2:34:38] them hello somebody I love to think
