[35:15] has in store. And and we uh I know
[35:18] Brother Andrew has a great ministry that
[35:21] God has blessed him with. Always been a
[35:23] blessing uh to us. And so we just want
[35:25] to pull from the gift of God. And uh
[35:28] even on a Wednesday night, Amen. I I
[35:30] like what brother Andrew says sometimes.
[35:32] He says, "Well, it's Wednesday night. We
[35:33] might as well have church." And like
[35:35] whatever, I don't think it matter if it
[35:36] was Tuesday or Thursday or Friday. I
[35:38] think he's going to say the same thing.
[35:39] And I I just come to have church
[35:41] tonight. Amen. Just to hear from the
[35:43] Lord. And you know, there's a there's a
[35:46] real cause and there's a sincerity in
[35:48] the hearts of the believers that uh that
[35:50] we have a real need and we're looking to
[35:52] be led of the Lord. And I believe that
[35:54] God is more than able to lead us through
[35:56] every aspect of our life, every
[35:58] decision, uh, that we ever make. God is
[36:00] more than able to lead us. And so, uh,
[36:02] we just want the Lord to be able to come
[36:05] and speak to us tonight. Amen. How

[37:33] Yes, my Lord. Let the sons and daughters
[37:37] sing.
[37:40] Yes, I'm surrendering my all.
[37:46] Oh, I surrender to the king.
[37:51] Father, I hear it growing louder. The
[37:55] song of your redeemed as the saints of
[37:59] every nation are awakening to sing. But
[38:03] from my heart there comes an anthem. Oh,
[38:07] hear my praises ring. This is my song. I
[38:12] sing to my king. Let the worshippers
[38:16] arise.
[38:18] [Applause]
[38:20] Let the sons and daughters sing.
[38:25] Oh, I surrender my all.
[38:30] Oh yes. I surrender to thee.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can testify tonight?
[38:39] Amen. That you're here to worship the
[38:41] Lord. Amen. We've not gathered here for
[38:43] any other purpose tonight but to worship
[38:45] him. Amen. I believe he's worthy of all
[38:47] of our praise. I believe he's worthy of
[38:49] all of our worship tonight. Amen. I know
[38:52] was thinking today the prophet of God
[38:53] talking about the world falling apart
[38:55] and we definitely can look around and
[38:57] see amen that the world is falling apart
[38:59] and everything that can be shaken will
[39:01] be shaken. But praise God there's a
[39:04] people in the last days that the devil
[39:05] will never defeat. Amen. He will never
[39:08] he will never conquer this bride cuz she
[39:10] is greater than any spirit or any enemy
[39:12] against her. Amen. Amen. How many can
[39:14] just say thank you Lord for your grace.
[39:17] Amen. Maybe tonight we just bow our
[39:18] hearts for a word of prayer. Amen. I
[39:20] know it's a a midweek service and I know
[39:23] the enemy is battling and doing
[39:24] everything he can. But I wonder how many
[39:26] just raise your hands tonight and say,
[39:27] "Lord, I've come to worship you. I've
[39:30] come to honor you. I've come to bless
[39:31] your name. And I know if if I'll
[39:33] surrender and you'll come in the
[39:35] building, something will happen
[39:36] tonight." Let's approach him, shall we?
[39:38] Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers
[39:41] have gathered here this Wednesday
[39:42] evening, Father, I know the enemy is
[39:44] doing everything he can to defeat and
[39:46] discourage the children of God. But
[39:49] Lord, we're not standing here tonight
[39:50] upon our own human ability, Father. But
[39:53] Lord, we're standing here upon the
[39:54] authority of your word, Lord, knowing
[39:56] that heaven and earth will pass away,
[39:58] but your word shall never pass away. And
[40:01] Lord, we gather here tonight, no doubt,
[40:02] with many needs in our heart, many, many
[40:05] situations maybe that believers are
[40:07] facing here. But Lord, I stand here
[40:09] tonight confident in this one thing.
[40:11] Lord, there is nothing in the past, the
[40:13] present, or the future, Lord, that can
[40:15] defeat the faith of a child of God. For
[40:17] Lord, when faith is truly been revealed
[40:20] in the heart of a believer, Lord, your
[40:22] prophet said faith knows no hindrances.
[40:24] It's the master of all circumstances.
[40:27] And tonight, Lord, as we have come here
[40:29] to receive something from your word. I
[40:31] pray that you would send the spirit of
[40:32] wisdom and revelation into the building.
[40:34] Lord, I pray you would bind the hand of
[40:36] the enemy. Father, Lord, I pray that the
[40:38] anointing, Lord, that destroys the yoke
[40:40] of the enemy. Father, may it rain down
[40:43] in this building tonight in power and
[40:44] demonstration, oh God. Lord, I pray for
[40:47] every person tonight that may be sick
[40:49] and body. Lord, we know that you're a
[40:51] healer. Father, may the may the healing
[40:53] virtues of Calvary flow through sick
[40:55] bodies, Lord. Father, for those that are
[40:57] bound, Lord, may the liberating grace of
[40:59] Almighty God. Lord, may it come in this
[41:01] building and liberate hearts and minds
[41:03] tonight, Lord. Father, if there be one
[41:06] discouraged, I pray the spirit of
[41:07] encouragement would come. Lord, I pray
[41:10] tonight, Lord, that you would just bless
[41:11] each and every one that has put forth an
[41:13] effort tonight, Lord, to travel down the
[41:15] highway to be in your house. Lord, you
[41:17] are not going to leave us unrewarded.
[41:19] Father, may you reward the faith of your
[41:22] children here tonight. Father, forgive
[41:24] us of our failures, Lord. Forgive us of
[41:25] our shortcomings, oh God. Lord, may this
[41:28] not be just another service, Lord, but
[41:30] may it be a time of transformation in
[41:32] your presence. And Lord, we'll be sure
[41:34] to give thee all the praise, all the
[41:36] honor, and all the glory in the
[41:37] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[41:40] Jesus Christ. We pray. And all the
[41:42] believers says,
[41:44] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. God richly bless you
[41:47] tonight. If you have your Bibles while
[41:48] you're standing with us tonight, we want
[41:50] to go to the word of the Lord to the
[41:51] book of Hebrews, the 10th chapter. the
[41:54] book of Hebrews, the 10th chapter. We
[41:56] want to say God bless you all tonight.
[41:57] It is a real honor to be home. It's been
[41:59] a few days since we've seen you and
[42:01] spoke to you, but we have been uh been
[42:03] enjoying the word of the Lord here. The
[42:05] men of God bringing the word. And I tell
[42:07] you that that sermon on the se the swer
[42:10] and the seed. Amen. Amen. I believe
[42:12] tonight the seed of God will have a
[42:13] harvest. Amen. There will be a material
[42:16] materialization of that seed. And amen.
[42:18] Tonight we just have a few things here
[42:20] we want to share with you from the word
[42:21] of the Lord in the book of Hebrews the
[42:23] 10th chapter. You love the Lord tonight.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 10 and verse
[42:29] number 35.
[42:31] Just want to read one verse here. Paul
[42:33] writing he says cast not away therefore
[42:36] your confidence.
[42:38] Notice he didn't say cast not therefore
[42:40] away confidence. He said, "Cast not away
[42:43] your confidence, which hath great
[42:46] recompense of reward." Maybe we just
[42:50] read that verse together. Hebrews 10:35.
[42:53] Cast not away therefore your confidence
[42:56] which hath great recompense of reward.
[42:59] Amen. We ask Lord this evening to bless
[43:01] the reading of his word as you can have
[43:03] your seat here this afternoon. I I want
[43:05] tonight by the help of the Lord to speak
[43:07] to you here for a few moments on
[43:09] something that's just um recently come
[43:10] up on our heart. We were out in
[43:12] Pennsylvania uh this past weekend for a
[43:14] camp there and I was went there and I
[43:16] thought I had all my sermons lined out
[43:18] and what I was going to speak on and uh
[43:20] Thursday night I was getting ready for
[43:21] service and I wasn't preaching that
[43:23] night so I was just listening to a tape
[43:25] and I thought I had what I was going to
[43:27] speak on the next night and I heard
[43:28] brother Bram say this word confidence
[43:30] and then things started connecting and
[43:32] and so tonight I just want to share a
[43:34] little bit of that with you tonight. If
[43:35] I would, if I would take a title
[43:37] tonight, I want to speak to you on this.
[43:38] Cast not away your spiritual confidence.
[43:42] Amen. And I believe if there ever was a
[43:44] time, Amen, that we as believers need
[43:47] spiritual confidence, I believe we need
[43:49] it right now. Amen. I think of what the
[43:51] prophet of God would say. He said, "You
[43:53] got to know what you're doing. You got
[43:55] to have confidence in what you're
[43:57] doing." Another place you would say,
[43:59] you've got to believe. You've got to
[44:00] have faith. And you've got to have
[44:02] confidence. You got to believe. You got
[44:04] to have faith and you got to have
[44:06] confidence. And how can you have
[44:07] confidence in anything that you don't
[44:10] even know where you are going? He said,
[44:12] "How can I travel down a road that I
[44:14] never been before at a break uh break
[44:16] neck speed and all around the curves,
[44:18] not knowing, amen, what the next curve
[44:20] holds?" You've got to see, amen, where
[44:23] you're going or you don't know how to
[44:25] walk. See, and that's the way everyone
[44:27] should be. And then when you can see it,
[44:29] amen, it's revealed to you and you know
[44:32] where you are going. Amen. Amen. If you
[44:34] can see it, then it's revealed to you
[44:36] and you know where you're going. He
[44:38] said, then nothing is going to stop you.
[44:41] Amen. Amen. That's more than just a good
[44:44] word, but that's a divine promise that
[44:46] if you can see where you're going, Amen.
[44:48] then nothing is going to stop you. Now,
[44:50] amen. And I speak of this confidence. I
[44:52] believe that natural confidence is good.
[44:54] I believe we should all have it. Amen.
[44:56] But I believe more than anything we must
[44:58] have, Amen. spiritual confidence. And
[45:00] when you look there at the definition of
[45:02] that word, it is the feeling or the
[45:04] belief that one can rely on someone,
[45:07] amen, or something. It is a firm trust.
[45:10] It is a a secret or a private matter
[45:12] that is told to someone. Amen. Under a
[45:15] condition of trust. So, amen. There is a
[45:18] confidence, but then there is a
[45:20] spiritual confidence. And I I love this
[45:22] definition. It is a deep unwavering
[45:24] belief. Amen. And trust in a higher
[45:27] power. Amen. in divine wisdom that is in
[45:30] one's own soul. Amen. Which provides
[45:33] inner strength and resilience to
[45:35] navigate life's challenges. Amen. It's
[45:38] not pride or arrogance. Amen. But it's a
[45:41] humble conviction that is rooted, amen,
[45:43] in one's connection to something greater
[45:46] than oneself. Amen. And it leads to
[45:48] peace, love, and a fearless approach,
[45:51] amen, to life's uncertainties. Amen.
[45:54] Amen. If you got a spiritual confidence,
[45:56] you're not just tied to the preacher.
[45:59] Amen. You're not just tied to the church
[46:01] or you're not just tied to your favorite
[46:03] preacher or you're not just tied to your
[46:04] favorite meeting, but rather, Amen,
[46:06] you're tied to something that's of a
[46:08] higher power. Amen. And it is rooted in
[46:11] your soul. I I love in Hebrews 10 when
[46:13] Paul says that in the Amplified Bible,
[46:16] it says in verse 35, "Do not therefore
[46:18] fling away, Amen. your fearless
[46:20] confidence." Amen. Amen. Don't just
[46:22] throw it away, for it has a glorious
[46:25] Amen. and a great reward. I think of
[46:27] what the prophet of God would say. He
[46:29] said, "What I'm trying to say is don't
[46:31] never lose your confidence."
[46:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't let Satan tell you evil
[46:36] about me because there's much." Amen.
[46:39] But you keep that confidence cuz if you
[46:42] don't, Amen. then it won't happen. So
[46:44] don't look to me as a man. He says, "I'm
[46:47] a man. I'm full of mistakes." Amen. But
[46:50] look to what I'm saying about him. Amen.
[46:53] It's him. He's the one. Now, I think
[46:56] it's amazing that all God is really
[46:58] desiring from us as believers. Amen. Is
[47:00] he is desiring our confidence. Amen.
[47:03] Amen. Our confidence in him. Amen. Our
[47:06] confidence in his word, our confidence
[47:08] in his power. I think of what the
[47:10] prophet of God would say to read a few
[47:12] quotes to lay a foundation. And he said,
[47:13] "Father, we know that he is here tonight
[47:16] because he promised to be." And our
[47:18] confidence is anchored in him, in his
[47:20] word. Another place he would say, "The
[47:22] reason that we can love him." Amen. And
[47:25] put our confidence is because he is
[47:28] truthful to his promise. Another place
[47:30] he would say, "The Lord has already
[47:32] provided a lamb." He said, "Remember, it
[47:35] was a female sheep. It wasn't a ram. It
[47:37] wasn't a female sheep. It was a ram." He
[47:40] said, "Jesus was a man." He said, "Man
[47:43] was God and God dwelt in and he was the
[47:46] sacrificial ram and he has already
[47:50] provided." What a what a what a what a
[47:52] place to place your confidence in
[47:53] tonight. Amen. That God is not
[47:56] providing, but rather he's already
[47:58] provided everything we have need of. He
[48:01] said, "See, we don't have to wait for
[48:02] him to come or something another for
[48:05] sacrifice to be provided." Amen. It's
[48:08] already provided. The only thing we have
[48:10] to do is put our confidence in faith,
[48:13] amen, in God's sacrifice that's already
[48:16] provided. How can we put our confidence
[48:18] in this written word of God? Amen.
[48:21] Because it's so inspired and every phase
[48:24] of it hangs together and it's drawing a
[48:27] picture for us of what God was and what
[48:30] God is and what God always will be. He
[48:33] said, now notice, you people all must
[48:35] remember this. Amen. That God cannot
[48:38] change. Amen. And he's the unchangeable
[48:40] God. Amen. Times change and people
[48:43] change. Amen. But God is infinite. He
[48:45] cannot change. He must remain the same
[48:48] yesterday. Amen. Today and forever. And
[48:51] if we believe this to be the word of
[48:53] God, amen, then we can put our
[48:56] confidence on anything, amen, that he
[48:58] said. Now, Amen. I think it's amazing
[49:01] that in this hour when the world, amen,
[49:03] is full of uncertain sounds. Amen. The
[49:05] prophet of God would say, "There's an
[49:07] uncertain sound on the job. There's
[49:09] uncertainty in national affairs." Amen.
[49:12] There's uncertainty in politics. Amen.
[49:14] Do you realize even in our home lives
[49:16] there's uncertainties? He said, "You
[49:18] say, "Well, brother Brandon, Amen.
[49:20] Everything's uncertain. Is there
[49:21] anything that's certain?" Oh, yes. Amen.
[49:24] Amen. There's one thing that's eternally
[49:26] certain. Amen. You can never get away
[49:29] from it. Amen. Heavens and earth will
[49:31] pass away. Amen. But my word shall not
[49:34] pass away. Then it is eternal certain.
[49:37] Amen. Now we see that we cannot put
[49:40] confidence in national affairs. We
[49:42] cannot put confidence in our job. We
[49:44] cannot put confidence in politics. We
[49:47] cannot put confidence in denomination.
[49:49] But there is one thing that is certain
[49:51] and that is God's word and God's
[49:53] promise. And when God says anything that
[49:56] settles it forever.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if it's possible to
[49:59] turn these off. I'll just use my ear.
[50:01] Amen. There is no confidence in our
[50:03] jobs. Amen. Amen. Now, you know, you go
[50:06] in tomorrow and they hand you slips,
[50:07] say, "Find somewhere else to work." Or,
[50:08] "Amen. There's no confidence in home
[50:10] life. There there's no confidence in in
[50:12] in in Amen. Amen. We'll get through it."
[50:15] Amen. There's no confidence in anything
[50:18] outside of the word of God. Now, I find
[50:20] it amazing that that that people Amen.
[50:22] they're looking for something to put
[50:24] their confidence in. That's why, Amen.
[50:26] that y'all remember a few years ago when
[50:28] we had the 9/11 attacks, Amen. I heard a
[50:30] preacher say, he said, "I went down to
[50:32] the church to pray." He said when I
[50:34] heard about the attacks and he said when
[50:36] I pulled up he said I couldn't even find
[50:38] a parking spot in my own church parking
[50:40] lot. He said the entire parking lot was
[50:42] full of people. He said they were
[50:44] running amen to the church house when
[50:46] trouble come. He said now look they're
[50:48] looking for something to put their
[50:50] confidence in. Let me ask you this. If
[50:52] you're going to put your confidence in
[50:54] denomination, Amen. which one are you
[50:56] going to put it in? The prophet of God
[50:58] said there's 900 different ways. Amen.
[51:01] One's going this way, one's going that
[51:03] way, one's going this way. Amen. Where
[51:05] are you going to put your confidence?
[51:07] But I say, thank God that he would send
[51:09] a prophet in the last days, in this time
[51:11] of uncertainty. He would not just come
[51:14] to restore the child. He would not come
[51:16] just to restore the gifts. He would not
[51:18] come just to restore feelings. Amen. But
[51:20] he would come to restore our spiritual
[51:23] confidence. Amen. And a prophet of God,
[51:25] amen, is not coming among the church
[51:27] just to do something. Amen. He is
[51:29] positioningly placing things. I love
[51:32] what he says. He said, "I'm an old man
[51:34] now." And I can call to the world a
[51:36] standstill and I can ask them, "Put your
[51:38] finger on one thing that he ever told me
[51:42] in thus sayaith the Lord in the name of
[51:43] the Lord." Amen. But what was absolutely
[51:46] the truth and the fact. Amen. And come
[51:49] to pass, listen, out of the thousands
[51:51] times thousands of things. He said, "Now
[51:54] what I'm saying that for," Amen. I've
[51:56] put us all as volcanic dust. Amen. But
[51:59] it's the promise of God's word. He said,
[52:01] "Now listen, therefore I cannot have
[52:04] confidence in myself and you cannot have
[52:06] confidence in yourself." Amen. But
[52:09] together, Amen. Amen. But together we
[52:12] can have confidence in what has taken
[52:14] over ourselves. Amen. I can't have
[52:17] confidence in you and you cannot have
[52:19] confidence in me. Amen. But if we put
[52:22] our confidence in the Holy Ghost, glory
[52:25] to God. He said the Holy Spirit has
[52:27] taken us over and we must have
[52:30] confidence in that. And as we place our
[52:32] confidence in that, Amen. then the
[52:35] results come. Amen. I think it's amazing
[52:38] that we're not just throwing our
[52:39] confidence out there and wherever it
[52:41] lands is where we're going to put it.
[52:43] Amen. But we are to place it. Amen. And
[52:46] to place something, it means to put it
[52:48] in a particular spot. It means to put
[52:51] importance on. It means it means to
[52:53] arrange or to position. Amen. Or to set
[52:56] something carefully and deliberately in
[52:59] its proper location or order. Listen,
[53:02] your faith don't belong in a man. Your
[53:04] faith don't belong in a church. Your
[53:06] faith don't belong in the denomination.
[53:08] Your faith belongs in the word of God.
[53:11] And I say, thank God he sent a prophet
[53:13] in the last days to take a hold of the
[53:16] faith of this generation and
[53:18] positionally place it in the word. Amen.
[53:20] I can't help but think of what David
[53:22] said. He said, "Some trust in chariots."
[53:25] Amen. And some in horses. Amen. But we
[53:28] will remember the name of the Lord.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some put their confidence in
[53:33] chariots. Brother Roy. Some put their
[53:35] confidence in horses. But David, David
[53:38] said, "I'm going to put my confidence in
[53:40] the Lord our God." Now, amen. You start
[53:42] thinking about this. You think about
[53:44] David. He was a man who had to know
[53:46] where his confidence was. He was always
[53:49] meeting the enemy, right? Amen. He was
[53:51] always facing spirits and he was always
[53:54] in spiritual warfare. Amen. I think one
[53:56] of the most one of the most notable
[53:57] battles that he was a part of. Amen. As
[54:00] little David went out there one day and
[54:01] he met that Goliath. Remember, Amen. and
[54:04] he looked at Goliath and and the Bible
[54:06] says that Saul, Amen, told him, "Amen,
[54:08] take my armor out there and amen, go out
[54:10] there and fight with it." So they put
[54:12] Saul's, amen, ecclesiastical vest on
[54:14] him. He said, but the problem was it
[54:16] didn't fit a man of God. He said. So he
[54:19] looked at him and said, "Take that thing
[54:21] off of me." Amen. I've never proved it.
[54:24] I don't know nothing about it, but I do
[54:26] know about this. Amen. What a silly
[54:28] thing it was in the face. Amen. Of Saul
[54:31] for David to stand there and to reject
[54:33] his armor. But David said, "Listen, if
[54:36] it's so good, why don't you go fight
[54:37] with it?" Amen. But Saul didn't have no
[54:40] confidence in it. And David sure wasn't
[54:42] going to put confidence in it. He said,
[54:44] "But I'm going to take this little
[54:45] slingshot." He said, "Let me go with
[54:48] what I've got confidence in." And he
[54:50] took that little slingshot and he went
[54:52] out there and God directed that rock.
[54:54] Amen. And he slew that giant. He said,
[54:57] "Why?" He stayed with the word. Amen. He
[55:00] stayed on his conviction. Listen, this
[55:02] is not the time, amen, to back off of
[55:05] our convictions. This is not the time to
[55:07] back off of what God has revealed to our
[55:10] soul. If there's ever been a time, amen,
[55:12] to stand like David. If there's ever
[55:14] been a time to believe like David, I say
[55:17] now is the time. Now is the season. Hell
[55:20] is against us. The demon powers are
[55:22] flowing in. But God who is rich in mercy
[55:25] has restored confidence in the word of
[55:28] God. And with that confidence, we can
[55:30] meet every devil. We can slay every
[55:32] giant. We can walk over every mountain.
[55:35] We can claim every promise. We can stand
[55:37] on the infallibility of the word of God
[55:39] knowing where our confidence has been
[55:41] put. My I don't have confidence in
[55:44] education, but I do have confidence in
[55:46] revelation.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; I don't have confidence in psychology,
[55:51] but I do have confidence in the
[55:53] anointing. I don't have confidence,
[55:56] amen, in human approaches to fixing
[55:58] problems, but I do have confidence in
[56:01] the supernatural God. He said, "That's
[56:03] the reason I got confidence in the Bible
[56:06] because it's the truth." Now, I think
[56:08] it's powerful. Amen. Amen. that lay out
[56:10] a sea. Amen. Is trying to influence and
[56:13] it's trying to control. Amen. Where you
[56:16] place your confidence. The prophet of
[56:18] God said the handwrite on the wall. He
[56:20] said, "Then you'll think about your old
[56:21] cold." Amen. Formal stay at home at
[56:23] night. A amen. Watching We Love Suzy.
[56:26] Amen. Watching all those kind of idiotic
[56:28] things. Amen. Amen. And putting your
[56:30] confidence in some prostitute out there.
[56:33] He said, "That's been married four or
[56:35] five times." He said, "You make them
[56:37] your idols and and you turn them on your
[56:39] television and you let your little
[56:41] children see them." He said, "Then you
[56:43] run out to barrooms." Now, watch a
[56:45] prophet. You run out to barrooms. Amen.
[56:47] And go to church. Amen. And then think
[56:49] you're somebody. He said, "You're
[56:51] weighed in the balance and you're found
[56:53] wanting." Amen. God requires a man to
[56:56] die out to self and to be born again by
[56:59] the Holy Ghost. Amen. I'll tell you why
[57:02] men can do that. It's cuz they got their
[57:04] confidence in the denomination and not
[57:06] in the word. Amen. The denomination
[57:08] says, "Live any way you want to and come
[57:11] to church and you're okay." Amen. But
[57:13] the word says a man must die and be born
[57:16] again of the water, of the blood, and of
[57:18] the spirit. He said, "That's what the
[57:20] supernatural." He said, "Now, what's the
[57:22] supernatural doing?" Amen. Now, do you
[57:24] understand? Amen. Can you see why the
[57:27] ministry is battling? Amen. Can you see
[57:30] why the ministry is battling with all
[57:33] their heart in this last hour? It's a
[57:36] serious thing. Amen. See where you're
[57:38] hanging. Amen. By morning, it may be
[57:40] over. Amen. I know people don't like
[57:42] this kind of preaching. Amen. But
[57:44] somewhere or another, we got to
[57:45] remember, Amen. that Russia's got a bomb
[57:48] with America's name on it. Amen.
[57:50] Somewhere we got to remember that there
[57:52] is a tribulation period. Somewhere we
[57:54] got to remember there is a hell to shun
[57:56] and a heaven to gain. Amen. Somewhere
[57:59] the church of the living God has got to
[58:01] remember. Amen. We're not just going to
[58:03] keep having services. Listen, there's
[58:05] coming an end to this thing, folks.
[58:07] Amen. We're not just here, Amen, to have
[58:09] church and church. Listen, I say this
[58:11] could be the night the rapture, amen,
[58:13] could move in and our bodies could be
[58:15] changed. I say if there's ever been a
[58:17] time, amen, to get our confidence out of
[58:19] Leosa, get our confidence out of
[58:22] Hollywood, get our confidence out of
[58:24] national affairs and get our confidence
[58:26] back in the supernatural attribute of
[58:29] the almighty God, I say now is the time
[58:31] to do it.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. The true ministry. Amen.
[58:36] They're not laying down. They're
[58:37] fighting. Amen. They're battling. Amen.
[58:40] But they're battling spirits. Amen. And
[58:42] I say, "Thank God for every man of God
[58:44] that's got enough guts about him to
[58:46] stand behind a pulpit and say what a
[58:48] prophet said."
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And then I tell you what's happening.
[58:52] The preacher is not after you. He's
[58:54] after the devil that's trying to take
[58:56] over your confidence and misplace it.
[58:59] You know what the Bible says in John 10?
[59:01] The Bible says the thief, he cometh not
[59:04] but for to steal and to kill and to
[59:07] destroy. But you know what Jesus said?
[59:10] He said, "I am come that they might have
[59:13] life and that they might have it more
[59:15] abundantly." Amen. Do you realize what a
[59:18] thief is? A thief is an embezzler. A
[59:21] thief is a prolifer. Amen. That word
[59:24] thief, the name is transferred, amen, to
[59:26] false teachers who do not care to
[59:29] instruct men but abuse their confidence
[59:32] for their own gain. A amen. So a thief
[59:35] is a man who gets behind a pull pit and
[59:37] gets your confidence. Amen. but don't
[59:40] have the guts to tell you the truth. He
[59:42] don't have the guts to tell you you
[59:43] shouldn't wear that and you shouldn't go
[59:45] there and you shouldn't watch that.
[59:46] Amen. But I say thank God we don't have
[59:49] a thief for a pastor. We have a man of
[59:51] God for a pastor. I say thank God we
[59:54] don't have a church full of preaching
[59:55] thieves. We have some men of God who
[59:58] have got a backbone when it comes to the
[1:00:00] word of God. And they will declare war
[1:00:02] on every devil that tries to misplace
[1:00:05] your confidence in the hour that you're
[1:00:07] living in. Amen. And I'll say any
[1:00:09] preacher, amen, that you put your
[1:00:10] spiritual confidence in, amen, in them
[1:00:13] instead of the word, Amen, that's a
[1:00:15] thief. Any man that'll take your
[1:00:17] spiritual confidence, amen, over the
[1:00:19] word is a thief. And I'll say this,
[1:00:21] they're taking something, amen, that
[1:00:23] don't belong to them. Amen. Amen. Your
[1:00:25] spiritual confidence don't belong to me.
[1:00:27] It don't belong to brother Matt. It
[1:00:29] don't belong to this church. It belongs
[1:00:31] to God. And God dictates where you place
[1:00:34] it.
[1:00:35] Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I know somebody said, "Well, that's
[1:00:38] a little that's a little far out there."
[1:00:40] No, I'm in the message. Remember,
[1:00:41] Brother Brian, Brother Brim told about
[1:00:42] that girl laying down there in the
[1:00:44] hospital. He said she was dying on her
[1:00:46] deathbed. He said, "All at once, she
[1:00:48] began to face reality." He said, "Now,
[1:00:50] what happened?" He said, "She was a
[1:00:52] loyal church member. She was a Sunday
[1:00:54] school teacher. She was a loyal church
[1:00:57] member of a fine big denominational
[1:00:59] church. But when she started to die,
[1:01:01] when the death rattles come into her
[1:01:03] heart, she began to scream out, "I'm
[1:01:05] lost." Amen. I'm lost. You know what she
[1:01:07] said? She said, "I'm lost. Go get the
[1:01:10] pastor." You know what the pro of God
[1:01:11] said? He said he had to put his
[1:01:13] cigarette out. Amen. To walk in there.
[1:01:16] Amen. Now watch. Imagine having a
[1:01:18] pastor. You're dying on your deathbed
[1:01:19] and they got to go get him and he's got
[1:01:21] to put his cigarette out. Amen. Before
[1:01:23] he comes in there. Now, now we can be
[1:01:25] politically correct and we can call him
[1:01:27] a pastor, but I'm going to call him what
[1:01:28] the Bible called him. The Bible called
[1:01:30] him a thief.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; See, go get that pastor. Put his
[1:01:36] cigarette out. And here he come. He
[1:01:37] said, "Oh, just shoot her with another
[1:01:39] hypo." She said, "I don't want no hypo."
[1:01:42] She said, "You deceiver of man. I'm
[1:01:44] dying and I'm going to hell and I'm lost
[1:01:47] because you failed to tell me the
[1:01:49] truth." He said, she said, "Go get that
[1:01:50] little good use girl and bring her up
[1:01:52] here to me real quick." She is right.
[1:01:54] Brother said, "Now wait." Amen. Till you
[1:01:57] face the reality. Amen. Don't you try to
[1:01:59] stop that holy hush. Amen. Don't you
[1:02:02] blast it away with some modern
[1:02:04] educational double barrel shotgun. You
[1:02:06] listen to the warning of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] tonight that's warning you. And what's
[1:02:11] he saying? I am the way. I am the truth.
[1:02:14] I am the life. And no man cometh unto
[1:02:17] the father. Amen. But by me. Listen what
[1:02:20] a prophet said. He said that hypo
[1:02:22] needle. Amen. It might dead inen the
[1:02:24] flesh and it might dead inen the mind,
[1:02:26] but that cannot deaden that soul that
[1:02:29] knows it's open before God. It'll haunt
[1:02:32] her through the ceaseless ages and
[1:02:34] through eternity. Amen. That soul will
[1:02:37] still haunt and haunt and haunt as the
[1:02:41] ages roll on. Amen. And the reason she
[1:02:44] got in that condition, Amen, was some
[1:02:46] thief. Amen. Was more interested in her
[1:02:48] pocketbook or interested in her
[1:02:50] standing. Amen. and said, "Just go be a
[1:02:53] Sunday school teacher. Just go be a
[1:02:55] loyal church member and I'll smoke my
[1:02:57] cigarette." Amen. But when reality
[1:02:59] struck, Amen. her misconfidence had been
[1:03:02] misplaced. Are you hearing me? Amen. Can
[1:03:04] I just tell you what the Bible says in
[1:03:06] Proverbs 25:19? It says, "Confidence in
[1:03:09] an unfaithful man in the time of trouble
[1:03:12] is like a broken tooth and a foot out a
[1:03:15] joint." Well, I might as well preach.
[1:03:18] Amen. You ain't going to do any eating
[1:03:19] with a broken tooth. And you ain't going
[1:03:21] to do no walking with a foot out a
[1:03:23] joint. Amen. You know what that word
[1:03:25] unfaithful means? It means to act
[1:03:27] deceitfully. That's right.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; It means to act faithlessly. Amen. But I
[1:03:33] want to say what David said. He said,
[1:03:35] "God is our refuge and God is our
[1:03:38] strength. He is a very present help in
[1:03:42] the time of trouble." David goes on to
[1:03:44] say in Psalms 118:8, "It is better to
[1:03:47] trust in the Lord than to put confidence
[1:03:50] in man. It is better to trust in the
[1:03:52] Lord than to put confidence in princes."
[1:03:55] Brother Be said, "Don't never trust in
[1:03:57] some man. I don't care who he is. If
[1:04:00] he's a holy man, if he's a good, there's
[1:04:02] no such a thing. There is no holy man."
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Can I preach? There is no holy church.
[1:04:09] There is no such a thing. It's a holy
[1:04:12] God, not a holy man. It's the Holy
[1:04:15] Ghost. Y'all remember Peter up there on
[1:04:17] the mountain? He referred to the
[1:04:18] mountain and called it the holy
[1:04:20] mountain. Brother said, "Oh no." Amen.
[1:04:22] It was not the holy mountain. It was the
[1:04:24] holy God that met them on the mountain.
[1:04:27] He said, "Not the holy man, but the Holy
[1:04:29] Spirit working in that man. The man will
[1:04:32] fail." Now, now, can we just preach? The
[1:04:35] man will fail. He's a failure to begin
[1:04:38] with. the very greatest of man fall. So
[1:04:42] don't you never put your confidence and
[1:04:44] make some man your example. You look to
[1:04:48] Christ. Christ is your example. He said
[1:04:51] don't put your confidence in a man. When
[1:04:53] now now I know this is a touchy one.
[1:04:55] When that man leaves the word of God,
[1:04:58] you leave the word and stay with a man.
[1:05:00] Follow him on the tribulation. Pack your
[1:05:02] babies into the pits of hell. When a man
[1:05:05] leaves the word, Amen. You leave the
[1:05:07] man. See, you leave the man and stay
[1:05:10] with God and the word.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And if the man wasn't a thief, he would
[1:05:15] tell you that.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to preach a little bit.
[1:05:20] If the man wasn't a thief, he would tell
[1:05:22] you, you stay with the word. But I'll
[1:05:24] tell you what happens. Amen. Is nobody
[1:05:26] wants to confront the devil that's
[1:05:28] really trying to place your confidence
[1:05:30] in himself. Now, I I got to go on and
[1:05:32] say what Solomon says. He says, "For the
[1:05:35] Lord thy God shall be thy confidence and
[1:05:38] shall keep thy foot from being taken." I
[1:05:41] love what a prophet says. He said, "My
[1:05:43] confidence is in him, in him, the God of
[1:05:46] heaven." Amen. Now, I'll just say what a
[1:05:48] prophet said. He said, "Fear is the
[1:05:50] greatest plague on the Christian church
[1:05:53] today." Now, you all know how, amen,
[1:05:55] that people get so far off the word is
[1:05:58] because a prophet said, "Man binds
[1:06:00] people to themselves." Amen. by fear.
[1:06:03] Amen. Rather than binding the people to
[1:06:05] the word. Prophet of God come along and
[1:06:07] said, "What makes fear is a lack of
[1:06:09] confidence." If you lack confidence,
[1:06:12] it'll make you fear. But if you love, it
[1:06:15] casts away that fear. And that's the way
[1:06:17] God wants his church. Not so many
[1:06:20] charter members. He wants members that's
[1:06:23] loyal members that loves and believes
[1:06:26] and has confidence in him. Now, let me
[1:06:28] just say, a true believer cannot have
[1:06:30] fear. Amen. and confidence at the same
[1:06:32] time. Because confidence makes you
[1:06:35] fearless. Amen. When you have spiritual
[1:06:38] confidence, it makes you fearless.
[1:06:41] Before the world ever began, you got to
[1:06:43] know the gods you're serving. Before the
[1:06:45] world ever began, he knowed all about
[1:06:47] it. Listen, he is omnisient because he's
[1:06:50] omnipresent. And omnisient makes him
[1:06:52] omnipresent. Listen, he knowed how many
[1:06:54] times that you would batch your eyes.
[1:06:57] Amen. What you would think before the
[1:06:59] world ever started. Then what are we
[1:07:01] afraid about? Amen. God is our father.
[1:07:05] He's our father. We have no worry. He
[1:07:09] said, "People has just lost their faith
[1:07:12] and their confidence in him." Don't you
[1:07:14] ever forget this, church. God is a
[1:07:17] supernatural God. He is not a natural
[1:07:20] God. He is not an intellectual God. He
[1:07:22] is a supernatural God. And I think it's
[1:07:25] amazing in the time when the
[1:07:26] supernatural element of God would return
[1:07:29] to the church is when carnal
[1:07:31] impersonators would begin to rise and
[1:07:34] the prophet of God said, "What's
[1:07:35] happened?" He said, "On the platform or
[1:07:37] somewhere I got a personally where I can
[1:07:40] speak to them and I can see what is
[1:07:42] wrong with him." He said, "Then if we
[1:07:43] could wait a few minutes, we'll see what
[1:07:45] the Lord says back." He says, "Now you
[1:07:47] be sure that that's God that says that
[1:07:50] and not an impression." As I said the
[1:07:53] other night, amen, there's too many
[1:07:55] gimmicks in Pentecost.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He said that's the reason the sincerity
[1:08:01] and the confidence has been lost is
[1:08:04] because of carnal impersonations. If we
[1:08:07] were sure that was God, we would set
[1:08:10] still. So when we have thus sayeth the
[1:08:13] Lord, you be sure that it's God. It's
[1:08:16] not your own fault or an impression or a
[1:08:19] pulsation. You got to know that it's
[1:08:21] God. Amen. Can I say this to you? We do
[1:08:24] not have to accept, Amen. some cheap
[1:08:27] man-made impersonation of the
[1:08:30] supernatural return of living God.
[1:08:32] Listen, we've already had a sign in the
[1:08:35] hand. We've already seen the discernment
[1:08:37] of the spirit. We've already heard from
[1:08:39] our theophony under the opening of the
[1:08:41] third pole. We are not looking for
[1:08:44] another man, amen, to rise up, amen, to
[1:08:47] lead this bride. We are underneath the
[1:08:49] leadership of the Holy Ghost and we're
[1:08:51] not afraid of it. We're not embarrassed
[1:08:54] of it. We're not humiliated by it. As a
[1:08:56] matter of fact, brother Bobby, all my
[1:08:59] spiritual confidence is in the
[1:09:01] leadership abilities of Almighty God.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just say this. Amen. When you
[1:09:07] lose your spiritual confidence, it can
[1:09:09] affect others.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in in John chapter 11
[1:09:13] that Mary and Martha's brother Lazarus
[1:09:15] died. Y'all remember that? You know what
[1:09:17] the prophet God said? He said they had
[1:09:19] left their church and followed this man
[1:09:21] Jesus. He said, "And in their darkest
[1:09:23] hour, it didn't seem like he even
[1:09:25] cared." He said, "And this man that they
[1:09:28] had left their church for, they were
[1:09:30] followed him and now seemed to
[1:09:31] disappoint them." He said, "But watch as
[1:09:33] Martha." Amen. Martha approaches the
[1:09:36] Lord. You know what she says? Well, if
[1:09:38] God was in Elijah the prophet, surely
[1:09:40] he's in his son.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, she said, "Now, if I
[1:09:44] can only get to him, no matter what he
[1:09:46] done, what a mistake it looked like."
[1:09:48] Amen. She went to him with reverence and
[1:09:51] fell down before him and said, "Lord, if
[1:09:54] thou would have been here, my brother
[1:09:56] would not have died." I love what a
[1:09:58] prophet said. She hadn't lost
[1:10:00] confidence. He said, "Now watch. If you
[1:10:02] had been here, my brother would not have
[1:10:04] died. But even now, now come on." That
[1:10:07] was not her feelings speaking. That was
[1:10:10] not her emotion speaking. Martha was
[1:10:12] still a human, saints. Amen. But she had
[1:10:15] a confidence in her soul. Amen. That
[1:10:18] though he's dead and though the skin
[1:10:20] worms are eating him up, but even now,
[1:10:22] Amen. Whatever you ask God, Amen. God
[1:10:25] will give it to thee, oh church, in the
[1:10:27] darkest hour that that family had ever
[1:10:30] seen. Their spiritual confidence had
[1:10:32] went beyond the fact they had left.
[1:10:34] Amen. To follow this man, Jesus. It had
[1:10:37] went beyond their friendship. It had
[1:10:38] went beyond their communication with
[1:10:40] him. their oh come their spiritual
[1:10:43] confidence amen was anchored in a higher
[1:10:46] power and that higher power was anchored
[1:10:48] in their soul and in the most shaken
[1:10:50] times in the most troublesome times they
[1:10:53] could look there and say but I know he's
[1:10:55] going to raise again because my
[1:10:57] confidence is in the right place what
[1:11:00] are you saying preacher I'm saying we
[1:11:02] must have spiritual confidence and we
[1:11:04] must allow it to be placed in God said
[1:11:07] if our hearts condemn us amend is
[1:11:10] greater than our hearts heart. Amen. And
[1:11:11] knoweth all things. Behold, beloved, if
[1:11:14] our heart condemnth not, then we have
[1:11:17] confidence.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; If our heart condemnth not, then we have
[1:11:23] confidence toward God. How many say,
[1:11:25] "Lord, I want a complete deliverance."
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what the prophet said? He
[1:11:30] said, "We want total deliverance from
[1:11:32] our habits, from our sins, from our evil
[1:11:35] thinking,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; from our evil doing, from our own
[1:11:38] negligence, whatever we've done. We want
[1:11:40] total deliverance so that when people
[1:11:43] come into this church to be prayed for,
[1:11:45] they'll be just this little group. Maybe
[1:11:48] not over a hundred or two sitting here,
[1:11:50] but they'll be completely in the hands
[1:11:52] of God. And when we pray, then God will
[1:11:55] hear from heaven. God wants somebody
[1:11:58] that he can hold in his hands. Somebody
[1:12:01] that he can say, "I got confidence in. I
[1:12:04] can send this my sick servant to the
[1:12:07] Brandom Tabernacle at Jeffersonville."
[1:12:09] And that group of people are in one
[1:12:12] accord and something will happen. Well,
[1:12:14] folks, let's not leave it in
[1:12:16] Jeffersonville. I say, God, I want a
[1:12:18] church. We want to be a church that you
[1:12:21] can send somebody that's weary, somebody
[1:12:23] that's bound, somebody that's depressed
[1:12:25] to Grace Tabernacle in Black Rockck,
[1:12:28] Arkansas. And there'll be a group of
[1:12:29] believers in there. They'll be in one
[1:12:31] mind and one accord. And they'll all
[1:12:34] have their spiritual confidence in the
[1:12:36] right place. And there'll be a miracle
[1:12:38] happen. There'll be a soul get saved.
[1:12:40] There'll be a vessel get filled. Listen,
[1:12:42] I think it's time to quit playing
[1:12:44] church. I think it's time to quit
[1:12:45] talking about what God did and talking
[1:12:47] about what God will do and open up our
[1:12:50] eyes and recognize we are living in the
[1:12:53] greatest power that the church of the
[1:12:55] living God has ever seen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Whatever we ask, we receive of
[1:13:01] him.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Because we keep his commandments. And
[1:13:05] now, can I read the rest of it?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And we do those things that are pleasing
[1:13:10] in his sight.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, amen. I'll just say this
[1:13:15] to you.
[1:13:17] God uses flawed human beings.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Don't walk out on me. But
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; He used your prophet.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; He used my prophet.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; And you know what he said? He said, "One
[1:13:33] time the lawyer called the house."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I went to go answer the
[1:13:38] phone." And it was a lawyer. My wife
[1:13:40] answered and I said, "Now listen, you
[1:13:43] tell them I'm not here and I'm going to
[1:13:45] step outside." And you know what he
[1:13:47] said? He said, "I did that. We got
[1:13:48] through it. Now, now let me just say
[1:13:50] this." Amen. You can get by a little
[1:13:52] bit,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; but then you got something to do. And so
[1:13:55] here come a man to his appointment.
[1:13:57] Brother Brandham said, "I went to lay my
[1:13:58] hand." And brother Brian, Brother
[1:13:59] Brandham, who had spoke squirrels into
[1:14:01] existence, who had broke the seven
[1:14:03] seals, who was going to reveal the
[1:14:05] mysteries of the Bible. He said, "I went
[1:14:07] to lay my hand and the spirit of the
[1:14:09] Lord said, can you lay your h can you
[1:14:12] lay your lying hands on that child?"
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Can you lay your lying hands on that
[1:14:18] child? I said, "Oh, I ran down to the
[1:14:20] lawyer's office and I begin to tell
[1:14:22] him." And he said, "Well, that's okay.
[1:14:23] You weren't there." I said, "I wasn't."
[1:14:25] He said, "I run out of the house and run
[1:14:27] behind the house to keep from being in
[1:14:29] there." I said, "But it's a lie anyhow."
[1:14:31] I said, "Now, will you forgive me for
[1:14:33] it?" I walked across the floor. He
[1:14:35] walked to me. He looked me straight in
[1:14:37] the eye and I could see in his great eye
[1:14:40] little tears begin to form. He took me
[1:14:42] by the hand and hugged me. And he said,
[1:14:43] "Brother Brandom, I've had great
[1:14:46] confidence in you, but I got more than
[1:14:48] ever now."
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; You know what the promise of God said?
[1:14:51] He said, "Confidence is in a man that
[1:14:53] can say he's wrong and repent." You know
[1:14:56] what John goes on to say? He said, "This
[1:14:58] is the confidence that we have in him
[1:15:00] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:15:02] will, he will hear us." He said, "Now we
[1:15:05] ask, what is the will of God?" There is
[1:15:07] only one way to know his will, and that
[1:15:08] is by the word of God. There it is. If
[1:15:11] it isn't in the word, then you can't
[1:15:13] have it. So, we cannot ask unless it's
[1:15:15] in the word. We cannot petition unless
[1:15:18] it's in the word. He said, "There it is
[1:15:20] again." Amen. Jesus is the name and the
[1:15:23] word is his will. You cannot separate
[1:15:25] God and the word. They are one. And if
[1:15:28] we know that he hear us, if we know that
[1:15:31] he hear us, then whatsoever we ask, we
[1:15:34] know that we have the petitions that we
[1:15:36] desired of him. Now listen, a prophet of
[1:15:38] God said this. He said, "God, with not
[1:15:41] confidence in my prayer, but confidence
[1:15:44] in your promise, no matter how little it
[1:15:46] is, what it is, how weak our prayer is."
[1:15:49] Amen. You promised it, Christ. Amen. Now
[1:15:52] watch a prophet. Amen. His confidence
[1:15:54] was not in his prayer. His confidence
[1:15:57] was in the promise. But there was prayer
[1:16:00] with confidence. Are you hearing me?
[1:16:02] Amen. That's why it don't take a special
[1:16:04] preacher to pray for you.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let me just go ahead and
[1:16:08] preach. Amen. That's why we don't have
[1:16:10] to all Amen. get one certain man to lay
[1:16:12] hands on us in order to get our healing.
[1:16:15] Our confidence is not in the flesh of a
[1:16:18] man. Our confidence is in the promise of
[1:16:21] Jesus Christ. When he said, "I am the
[1:16:23] Lord that healthth all thy diseases." He
[1:16:26] said, "You got to believe it." He said,
[1:16:28] "What we need today is not pray for more
[1:16:30] power. You got enough power to make a
[1:16:32] new earth. What you need is faith to use
[1:16:35] that power. What you need is to control
[1:16:37] that life and live such a godly life
[1:16:39] that when you ask God anything, you
[1:16:41] know, we have confidence in God. We know
[1:16:44] he'll keep. He'll withhold no good thing
[1:16:46] from us if we walk with him. Amen. God
[1:16:49] is walking with us. Amen. I love that.
[1:16:52] You know what Amos said? He said, "Can
[1:16:54] two walk together?"
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Can two walk together
[1:16:59] except they be agreed? Now, I know this
[1:17:02] might get a little touchy. Amen. But can
[1:17:04] two walk together except they be agreed?
[1:17:08] Can you and God walk together and you
[1:17:11] got your confidence in a man and you're
[1:17:13] trying to walk with God? Can you and God
[1:17:16] fellowship together when he wants to
[1:17:18] tell you about how powerful his word is
[1:17:20] and about how rich his grace is and
[1:17:23] about how unlimited his mercy is and you
[1:17:25] want to talk about how great some
[1:17:27] preacher is or how great some church is
[1:17:29] or how great some following. Come on
[1:17:31] church, we might as well preach. Amen.
[1:17:33] How can two walk together except they be
[1:17:36] agreed? He said, "One will run this way
[1:17:38] and one will run that way and this
[1:17:40] radical run this way and that." He said,
[1:17:42] "That's the way the church has always
[1:17:43] gone." He said, "That's man." He don't
[1:17:46] want to be led by God, but whenever we
[1:17:48] get to a place that we forget that we
[1:17:50] are brethren and we're all striving for
[1:17:52] one place. Amen. That's when we've left
[1:17:55] God. When we forget that we're all on
[1:17:57] the same team.
[1:17:59] Come on, church. And we've got to rec I
[1:18:02] might as well preach. I'm here. We got
[1:18:04] to recognize one another even in our
[1:18:07] peculiarities.
[1:18:09] Well, glory to God. Somebody shout
[1:18:11] hallelujah. We got to recognize one
[1:18:14] another even in our peculiarities. He
[1:18:17] said, "I got a brother in the natural
[1:18:19] that's tall and thin and blondeheaded
[1:18:22] and pugnosed and fairs skinned. He don't
[1:18:24] look like me. We don't act alike. You
[1:18:27] would never know we was brothers." But
[1:18:29] his daddy is my daddy. Woo! Glory. His
[1:18:33] daddy is my daddy. And if the family
[1:18:36] accepted him looking the way he did,
[1:18:39] accepting me looking the way I did, then
[1:18:41] we can accept another to be brothers.
[1:18:44] Come on, church. Amen. I think we could
[1:18:46] fix a lot of nonsense if we would start
[1:18:49] trying to categorize people and stop
[1:18:51] trying to put them in this category and
[1:18:52] they're in this group and tear down all
[1:18:54] the clicks and tear down all the little
[1:18:56] feelings and just say, "God, if daddy
[1:18:59] accepted her, then I'm going to accept
[1:19:01] her. If daddy accepted me, then I'm
[1:19:04] going to accept him."
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what a prophet said? He
[1:19:08] said, "That's the way we have to do in
[1:19:10] the Christian realm. We have to believe
[1:19:12] and have faith in one another." Now,
[1:19:15] come on. When I'm going somewhere, I've
[1:19:17] just spent nearly 30 minutes telling
[1:19:19] you, amen, not to have faith in man, not
[1:19:22] to have faith in a church, not to have
[1:19:24] faith in a specific person, but have
[1:19:26] faith in God. And then a prophet comes
[1:19:28] along and says, "Have faith in one
[1:19:30] another."
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Now, can I say what a prophet said?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "When the Christians lose faith
[1:19:38] in one another, the devil's got the
[1:19:41] church right then."
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Right then.
[1:19:47] testing one, two,
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; we got to have faith
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; and confidence in one another.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:19:59] Lord, I preached this in Pennsylvania.
[1:20:01] You're going to have to help me again.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Bear with one another.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You know what Paul said? He said, "I
[1:20:08] would to God that you could bear with me
[1:20:10] a little
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; in my folly."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] Come on.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Uh, I don't know who's in the sound
[1:20:19] booth. Have they got an amen tape up
[1:20:20] there?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You just put it in. It says, "Amen."
[1:20:22] Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; You know what Paul said in Galatians
[1:20:26] 6:2? He said, "Bear ye one another's
[1:20:28] burdens."
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And so fulfill the law of Christ. Notice
[1:20:33] he didn't say shout down the aisle or
[1:20:35] dance down. We believe in those things.
[1:20:37] But folks, I might as well get out
[1:20:38] there. We've been doing a lot of
[1:20:40] shouting and a lot less repenting. We've
[1:20:42] been doing a lot more pushing for
[1:20:44] dancing and a lot less pushing for
[1:20:45] repenting. But if we want to shout and
[1:20:48] we want to dance, if the devil can't
[1:20:50] take it out, I say open up the blood of
[1:20:52] Jesus Christ and get back to some
[1:20:54] oldfashioned repenting and quit just
[1:20:56] trying to push things under the rug and
[1:20:58] get them underneath the blood. You want
[1:21:00] to dance? Amen. Dance on the devil's
[1:21:02] head. You want to shout, Amen. Get your
[1:21:05] sins underneath the blood and then
[1:21:07] you'll have the greatest dancing for
[1:21:08] you've ever fell on your feet.
[1:21:11] Hallelujah. Amen. Bear ye one another's
[1:21:14] burdens and so fulfill the law of
[1:21:15] Christ. And I'll just say this. Satan's
[1:21:17] after the church.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God stood there in 1963 and
[1:21:23] he said, "Here's a word to the church."
[1:21:25] He said, "The devil will come in and
[1:21:26] shoot an arrow of poison, bitterness
[1:21:28] in."
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I got to say what the Bible says.
[1:21:32] The devil's after the church.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Now, if he knows, now this what the
[1:21:37] devil knows. He knows if the shepherd is
[1:21:39] smitten on
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; that he can scatter the sheep.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Now that's not just a good cliche.
[1:21:46] That's Zechariah 13:7. Awake, O sword,
[1:21:49] against my shepherd and against the man
[1:21:51] that is my fellow, sayaith the Lord of
[1:21:53] hosts. Smite the shepherd and the sheep
[1:21:56] shall be scattered. I will turn my hand
[1:21:59] upon the little ones. Look at this word
[1:22:01] smite. It means to strike. It means to
[1:22:04] attack and destroy. It means to conquer,
[1:22:08] to smite, means to receive a blow, to be
[1:22:12] wounded. Can I tell you what a prophet
[1:22:14] said? He said, "God be with you." He
[1:22:16] said, "Go to your churches. Support it.
[1:22:20] Stand behind your pastor. Stand behind
[1:22:22] the programs of God. Pray for your
[1:22:25] pastor." Can I give you another one?
[1:22:26] Amen. Don't forget Sunday. And don't
[1:22:29] forget Wednesday night prayer meeting.
[1:22:31] You pray for me. You pray for your
[1:22:33] pastor. You pray for your neighbor. You
[1:22:35] pray for your deacons. You pray for the
[1:22:37] trustees. Listen, pray that God will
[1:22:40] have his way with us all. Look, if it
[1:22:43] would it be good if all God's sheep when
[1:22:45] the heat was on would stand together
[1:22:48] when the trials are real hard and the
[1:22:51] heat is on and everything's going
[1:22:53] everywhere. It's all God. So a group of
[1:22:54] sheep would just stand together. We
[1:22:57] would have the coolness of the shade of
[1:23:00] each other, the comfort to lean up on
[1:23:02] each other. Now, someone said, "Is that
[1:23:04] necessary, Brother Random?" It certainly
[1:23:07] is. There's nothing like having a real
[1:23:10] good, dependable friend that when the
[1:23:12] troubles are blazing and the heat is on,
[1:23:15] you can go to this friend and you can
[1:23:17] sit down and you can explain it to them.
[1:23:19] You can talk it over in personal
[1:23:21] confidence and then kneel down and pray
[1:23:23] together and know that that person is a
[1:23:26] good God-saved man or woman that you can
[1:23:28] put confidence in. Oh, it's good to do
[1:23:30] that. Amen. Come, let us reason
[1:23:33] together. Listen, folks. You're not my
[1:23:35] enemy. You're my brother. Amen. You're
[1:23:38] my sister. I'm not your enemy. I'm your
[1:23:40] brother. But God has set some men of God
[1:23:43] in the church of God to keep the Messiah
[1:23:46] ship straight.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; I just got to go on and say what Paul
[1:23:50] said. He said he gave some apostles and
[1:23:53] he gave some prophets and he gave some
[1:23:55] evangelists and he gave some pastors and
[1:23:58] he gave some teachers. Now, he didn't
[1:24:00] give all prophets. He didn't give all
[1:24:02] evangelists. He didn't give all pastors,
[1:24:04] all teachers, all. No, he gave some.
[1:24:07] Look at this word pastor. It is a
[1:24:09] herdsman, especially a shepherd. It is
[1:24:12] he to whose care and control others have
[1:24:14] committed themselves and whose precepts
[1:24:17] they follow.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Look here. Now, I find this amazing,
[1:24:21] brother Joe. During World War II, this
[1:24:24] is in the Greek definition, by the way,
[1:24:25] of the word pastor.
[1:24:28] In World War II, a shepherd was a pilot
[1:24:31] who guided another pilot whose plane was
[1:24:34] partially disabled back to the base or
[1:24:37] carrier.
[1:24:40] God by flying alongside him to maintain
[1:24:44] visual contact.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh God, the shepherd
[1:24:50] didn't get out of his plane and get over
[1:24:52] in that plane, but they stayed together.
[1:24:55] And the shepherd had a visual contact
[1:24:58] and he kept navigating. Do this, do
[1:24:59] that, turn here, go there, pull up,
[1:25:01] pull. And he got him back safely to the
[1:25:03] base. Oh, I say, thank God. Amen. For a
[1:25:06] pastor like our pastor here. Come on,
[1:25:09] church. He ain't moving in your house.
[1:25:11] He ain't moving in your home, but he's
[1:25:13] going to stay by you and he's going to
[1:25:14] keep a visual contact with the promise
[1:25:17] of God. He's going to keep a visual
[1:25:19] contact. No matter how bad you're
[1:25:21] bruised, no matter how bad you're
[1:25:23] wounded, he's going to keep telling you
[1:25:25] you're going to make it. Amen. I know
[1:25:26] you're wounded right now, but just hold
[1:25:28] on. In a few days, we're going to shout
[1:25:31] together. Come on, church. He gave some
[1:25:34] pastors.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Now, let me go on to say what else he
[1:25:39] said. In the church is the pastor, and
[1:25:43] he's a special person.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; You're special.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; He
[1:25:50] You're
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; He's a special pastor
[1:25:55] that could go wrong.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; We'll talk later.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; He's not special. He's a special pastor.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He's built where he can put up with the
[1:26:07] fusses of the people.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; He's a burden bearer.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; He's the ox of the team.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Now, here we go. He's a man that can sit
[1:26:17] down when somebody's got something
[1:26:18] against somebody else and sit down with
[1:26:20] them two families and take neither side
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; and reason it out and bring it back into
[1:26:27] sweetness because he's a shepherd and
[1:26:30] he's got a visual contact of the future.
[1:26:32] He knows what the devil's trying to do.
[1:26:35] He knows the devil's trying to displace
[1:26:37] those two families. He's trying to
[1:26:39] displace that situation so he can move
[1:26:42] in and become the source of confidence
[1:26:44] in those famil family's lives. I say we
[1:26:46] ought to get back to letting the Holy
[1:26:48] Ghost, Amen, shepherd the church through
[1:26:50] the man of God that he has placed in the
[1:26:52] pull pit. Yes, sir. He said, you got to
[1:26:55] have faith in that pastor. You got to
[1:26:56] have faith in that man of God. He said,
[1:26:58] listen, you got to have confidence in
[1:27:00] the man you're dealing with or won't do
[1:27:01] no any good to have any dealing. You got
[1:27:03] to believe he's a good Godsave man
[1:27:05] preaching the gospel. then stand behind
[1:27:08] him with everything he's got. No,
[1:27:10] listen. Amen. If he isn't, go somewhere.
[1:27:12] But listen, if the preachers the gospel
[1:27:15] cause the man is sent from God and
[1:27:17] ordained of God to feed your soul,
[1:27:19] listen. I know they may not like it.
[1:27:21] Amen. Devils may not like it, but I say
[1:27:23] God bless you, brother Matt. Amen. God
[1:27:25] bless you for being a God-fearing, Holy
[1:27:27] Ghost fil, Bible preaching, God
[1:27:30] reverencing son of God to lead the
[1:27:32] church of God. You say, "Preacher, are
[1:27:35] you saying you got confidence? You
[1:27:36] better believe I got confidence. But
[1:27:38] I'll say this, my confidence, Amen, is
[1:27:41] not in Matt's flesh. My confidence is
[1:27:43] not in brother Matt's flesh. My
[1:27:45] confidence is in the God that's on the
[1:27:47] inside of him. Listen, don't have
[1:27:49] confidence in me and I don't have
[1:27:51] confidence in you. But if we put our
[1:27:53] confidence in the Holy Ghost that has
[1:27:56] taken over every redeemed member, then
[1:27:58] praise God, it don't matter what the
[1:28:00] devil throws against us, we got
[1:28:02] spiritual confidence. We'll crest every
[1:28:05] wave. We'll cross every mountain.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say this. One of one of one
[1:28:10] of Now, now just let me preach a second.
[1:28:13] Out of all the things God could have
[1:28:14] chose,
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; he chose man.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; He chose human instrumentality.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Can I go on?
[1:28:24] There was a lot of other easier things
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; to have spiritual confidence in
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; but God
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; chose man.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Now brother Ram said God don't fall up
[1:28:39] on denomination so you can't put your
[1:28:41] confidence there.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; You know God don't fall up on mechanical
[1:28:44] devices.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So all this nonsense and I did not
[1:28:47] stutter when I said it. I said,
[1:28:49] "Nonsense."
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Of staying home and playing tapes and
[1:28:52] calling that the move of God has crawled
[1:28:54] out of the pits of hell.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. We can we can try to
[1:28:59] splice it however we want to. It's a
[1:29:01] devil.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not the leadership of God.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. Now, now
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; you say, "How far can it go?" I'll tell
[1:29:10] you how far it can go. It's gone as far
[1:29:11] as we got people driving to headquarters
[1:29:14] to pick up communion bread and communion
[1:29:16] wine and having communion in their
[1:29:18] homes.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Well, I might as well
[1:29:22] preach. They used to have to make it at
[1:29:23] home, but then I guess they filmed the
[1:29:25] quote where brother said, "Holy Ghost
[1:29:26] filled hands had to make the bread."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And then I guess they found the other
[1:29:31] quote where brother said, "If God got
[1:29:32] the Holy Ghost, you'll go to church." So
[1:29:33] then they had to figure out some way,
[1:29:35] amen, to get out. But I tell you why
[1:29:37] we're in this shape is because people
[1:29:39] put their confidence in what a man said
[1:29:41] instead of what God said. Look, the
[1:29:44] Bible says, "Amen, unto the angel of the
[1:29:45] church and Sardis, write these things."
[1:29:47] I'm going to hurry through this. Sayaith
[1:29:48] he that has seven spirits of God and the
[1:29:50] seven stars, I know thy works. Thou hast
[1:29:53] a name that thou art livest and are
[1:29:55] dead. Reb said this. He said the seven
[1:29:58] spirits of God mean it is the one and
[1:30:01] same spirit coming forth in a seven-fold
[1:30:04] way. He said the seven spirits are found
[1:30:07] to be associated with man. Revelation
[1:30:10] 5:6 the seven spirits are identified as
[1:30:14] seven eyes. He said it is very evident
[1:30:16] that the word they refers to men. Thus
[1:30:19] we see that the eyes of the Lord in this
[1:30:22] instance are men that will be anointed
[1:30:25] men full of the Holy Ghost. For God's
[1:30:28] ministries are not in the power of men
[1:30:30] but in the power of the Holy Ghost. He
[1:30:34] said, "What's happening?" He said, "That
[1:30:35] God is bringing himself on the scene as
[1:30:38] the chief shepherd in the ministries of
[1:30:41] those seven men to lead his people back
[1:30:44] to the truth and the abundant power of
[1:30:47] that truth." Listen, as the now, now,
[1:30:49] can I just preach here for a second? As
[1:30:51] the same Lord identified himself with
[1:30:53] man in the incarnation, he is again
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He has again identifying
[1:31:01] himself with man by his spirit within
[1:31:04] man. Jesus said these are mine. The
[1:31:07] seven spirit spiritfilled messengers are
[1:31:10] the lords. They may be repudiated. They
[1:31:13] may be questioned. Listen indeed to
[1:31:16] human minds they might not even seem to
[1:31:20] qualify but nevertheless they are the
[1:31:23] messengers for their age. Listen, God
[1:31:26] used an Abraham. He lied.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. We might as well preach. He
[1:31:32] used a Moses and he rebelled. He used a
[1:31:35] Jonah and he disobeyed. He used a
[1:31:38] Samson. Listen. He used a Samson and he
[1:31:41] sinned. He used a David and he murdered.
[1:31:44] Yes, he used a Joshua. And yes, he used
[1:31:47] a Joseph. Brother David, Paul, this is
[1:31:49] what makes me put my shouting shoes on.
[1:31:51] And those with severe blemishes far
[1:31:54] outnumber those whose histories seem to
[1:31:58] be perfect.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Well, there's no way God can use me.
[1:32:03] Amen. Cuz I'm not a Joshua and I'm not a
[1:32:05] Joseph. I'm an Abraham or I'm a Samson
[1:32:08] or I'm a David. Well, God used those as
[1:32:10] much as he used the others. We're all
[1:32:13] his. Amen. Listen. And through them, God
[1:32:15] will accomplish his sovereign will. Now,
[1:32:17] I want to say something to you. Amen.
[1:32:19] The God that sends the man, he goes in
[1:32:22] the man. I want to tell you that if God
[1:32:24] testifies of a gift, it's going to be
[1:32:26] one that he sent. In Hebrews 11:4, Paul
[1:32:29] says this, "By faith, Abel offered unto
[1:32:31] God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:32:33] Cain, by which he obtained a witness
[1:32:36] that he was righteous." Listen, God
[1:32:38] testifying of his gifts, and by it he
[1:32:42] being dead, yet speaketh. Look at this
[1:32:45] word testify. It is to affirm that one
[1:32:48] has seen or heard or experienced
[1:32:51] something that he knows it because he
[1:32:54] was taught by divine revelation or
[1:32:57] divine inspiration. Burb said it's your
[1:33:00] character, your conduct that gives God
[1:33:02] confidence in you. That's the reason we
[1:33:04] haven't got the great church marching on
[1:33:06] today is because God can't find people
[1:33:09] to put his confidence in. He said God
[1:33:12] has to find somebody he can trust. Some
[1:33:15] are y'all hearing me? Will you hear a
[1:33:17] prophet? Somebody he can have confidence
[1:33:19] in and can have confidence in God that
[1:33:22] can believe him. God has to find
[1:33:25] somebody.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That he can put his confidence in. And
[1:33:29] then when he finds such a man, he can
[1:33:32] put his confidence in and his power in.
[1:33:34] And that man will follow the road
[1:33:35] that'll stay on the right map. We'll go
[1:33:37] right on till he comes to the place of
[1:33:39] power. Now, amen. I want I just want to
[1:33:41] slow down here and say this. Brother Bam
[1:33:43] said the hardest thing he said, "Look, I
[1:33:45] pray for the sick. I want each one of
[1:33:46] you out there to be aware of this that
[1:33:48] the Holy Spirit is right out over this
[1:33:50] audience tonight
[1:33:52] to heal anybody that's in this
[1:33:54] audience." Now, this may be a little
[1:33:56] different from what you've seen,
[1:33:57] brethren, and pray for the sick. I can
[1:33:58] only do as God tells me to do. I can
[1:34:00] only say as he says for me to do. And if
[1:34:04] I tell the truth, then God will testify.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That I've told the truth. Now, what I'm
[1:34:11] afraid of is this, dear friends.
[1:34:13] as it was back there. It'll have to be
[1:34:16] that way now. When Moses came, many
[1:34:19] refused Moses because he was a man. When
[1:34:24] G I'm reading you a quote. When Jesus
[1:34:26] came, many of them refused Jesus because
[1:34:29] he was a man. They said, "Him being a
[1:34:31] man maketh himself equal with God." Now,
[1:34:33] he was God manifested in the flesh. So,
[1:34:36] there'll never be a man like him on
[1:34:38] earth. That's right. There'll never be a
[1:34:40] man like him. But he ordained certain
[1:34:44] things to be done. And then it's so hard
[1:34:46] sometimes for people to see that because
[1:34:49] a man said so. So it's not only hard,
[1:34:52] brother Brian, for them for them to know
[1:34:54] that or to see it, but it's hard because
[1:34:56] a man said it. He said, "Now look, I'll
[1:34:58] do a work in the last days. Though a man
[1:35:01] bring it, they will not believe it." I'm
[1:35:03] not going to preach all night. Okay?
[1:35:04] Though a man bring it, they will not
[1:35:06] believe it. How many knows that's a
[1:35:08] scripture?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] Though a man would bring it and would
[1:35:12] speak it, they would not believe it. He
[1:35:14] said, "Now, the hardest thing God ever
[1:35:16] had to do was get one mortal to believe
[1:35:19] another." He said, "You would believe
[1:35:21] anything almost, but one person believe
[1:35:24] in another." Amen. That's a hard thing.
[1:35:27] Can you give me that picture? Amen. One
[1:35:29] person believe in another. He said,
[1:35:31] "That's a hard thing." Amen. Now, I I
[1:35:34] love this picture. I love it. Not
[1:35:37] ashamed of it. I'm not embarrassed of
[1:35:39] it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Now, let me say what a prophet said.
[1:35:43] Look at that. He said, "For years, I've
[1:35:46] tried ever since I've been all ever
[1:35:48] since I've been out to stand back and
[1:35:51] try to keep out of the picture." So,
[1:35:54] Brother Brandham knew there was a time
[1:35:56] coming that the pillar of fire would
[1:35:58] return to the church. He met the pillar
[1:36:01] of fire. And for now, come on, church.
[1:36:03] From 30 from from 33, Amen. all the way
[1:36:06] to to 50. He was preaching the pillar of
[1:36:09] fire is here. The pillar of fire is in
[1:36:11] this building. The pillar of fire has
[1:36:13] returned. We are following the pillar of
[1:36:15] fire. He was preaching the log go of
[1:36:17] God. But he was trying to stay out of
[1:36:19] the picture. He said, "Now just as much
[1:36:21] as I possibly could, cuz all I wanted
[1:36:23] him to see was the Lord Jesus." Can I
[1:36:26] say this to you? Amen. God had to set it
[1:36:29] up. God had to arrange it. He had to get
[1:36:32] him in such a spot where he was trying
[1:36:34] to hide. But listen folks, he knew in
[1:36:37] the last days there was going to be a
[1:36:39] people in Leosa that would not know what
[1:36:42] to follow. They would not know where to
[1:36:44] go. They would not know what to preach.
[1:36:46] And they needed a voice.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. It's one thing, brother
[1:36:51] Ed, it's one thing if we just had the
[1:36:53] pillar of fire picture. Wouldn't that be
[1:36:55] lovely? Wouldn't that be wonderful if we
[1:36:57] just had the halo? But you know what
[1:36:59] could happen, brother brother Brian? If
[1:37:01] we just had the halo, every preacher
[1:37:03] could photoshop themsel in there and
[1:37:06] say, "Say what I say." But God so set it
[1:37:09] up. God so arranged it that when the
[1:37:12] picture was taken, he had been trying to
[1:37:14] dodge it for years. He had been trying
[1:37:16] to stay out of it for years. But oh,
[1:37:18] when they took the first one, it did not
[1:37:20] develop. And when they took the second
[1:37:22] one and the third one, and the fourth
[1:37:24] and the fifth and the sixth, none of
[1:37:26] them developed. Oh, brother Joel. But
[1:37:28] when they struck that seventh picture,
[1:37:30] there was the pillar of fire and there
[1:37:32] was the seventh angel that the presence
[1:37:34] of God had identified himself with.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm no longer looking for
[1:37:40] something to put my confidence in. My
[1:37:42] confidence is in the voice.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Now that that angel's right here in this
[1:37:49] building tonight.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I got to I got to close right here.
[1:37:54] A message has to have a messenger.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:57] Can I say this to you? You cannot have
[1:38:00] confidence in the message.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; And doubt the messenger.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And you cannot have confidence in the
[1:38:09] messenger
[1:38:11] and doubt the messenger.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The work of God is ye
[1:38:16] believing on him whom he hath sent."
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You know what a proto God said?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "People just don't realize what
[1:38:22] God can do through his servant." That's
[1:38:25] the reason today that people can't get
[1:38:26] so much done is because they've lost
[1:38:29] faith in the servants of God.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Part of it's a servant's
[1:38:34] fault though. He tried to tell you God
[1:38:35] was way back years ago, but God is still
[1:38:37] God. He's right here on the earth and
[1:38:40] he's using his servants like he always
[1:38:42] did. Can I Can I say this to you?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; And we must expect God to do something
[1:38:48] through his servants.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm gonna just close on this.
[1:38:54] If you don't get anything out of this,
[1:38:55] out of this whole sermon, get this.
[1:38:58] Anything God has confidence in, I have
[1:39:02] confidence in.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; brother Jared. Anything God has
[1:39:08] confidence in, I have confidence in it.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God has
[1:39:15] confidence.
[1:39:19] It's not very deep,
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; but it would change the way you look at
[1:39:22] the person sitting next to you.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; See, now now I'm just going to say it
[1:39:29] because sometimes sometimes we wonder
[1:39:32] how could someone have confidence
[1:39:34] in someone or something.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I was I was listening today tape,
[1:39:39] brother preaching. I was listening to a
[1:39:41] sermon he preaching. You know what he
[1:39:42] called it? He called it Corinthians,
[1:39:44] the book of correction. And he going
[1:39:47] through there and man, he's laying it
[1:39:48] out. Brother Brian, he's talking about
[1:39:50] how they go, how I come among you and
[1:39:52] one's got a psalm and one's got a tongue
[1:39:54] and one's got a feeling, one's got a
[1:39:56] sensation, one's got a new revelation.
[1:39:58] He said, "I got the awst keeping all
[1:40:00] them straight and and they depend on
[1:40:01] sensations and things like that." And
[1:40:03] you go among them and try to tell them
[1:40:05] the revelation. They say, "Well, the
[1:40:06] Lord showed me this or I had a prophecy
[1:40:08] or and and he said he finally just
[1:40:10] looked at him and said, "All these
[1:40:11] things will fail." Now what I'm doing is
[1:40:13] brother Carter is I'm reading through
[1:40:14] the book of Corinthians and I know this
[1:40:16] and I read where Paul says this. He said
[1:40:18] in 2 Corinthians 2:3 he said I wrote
[1:40:20] this same unto you less when I came I
[1:40:23] should have sorrow for them of whom I
[1:40:25] ought to rejoice. Now look what he says
[1:40:28] having confidence in you all.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Did I read that right?
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; That my joy is the joy of you all. For
[1:40:37] out of much affliction and anguish of
[1:40:40] heart, you all caused me a lot of
[1:40:42] anguish.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Y'all caused me a lot of affliction, and
[1:40:47] I've wrote unto you and many tears, not
[1:40:49] that ye should be grieved.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; When he was, God have mercy. When he was
[1:40:55] writing to him, he was not hoping that
[1:40:57] they would get grieved. He was saying,
[1:40:59] "No, that ye might know the love,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; which I have more abundantly unto you."
[1:41:06] Come on, Paul. They got a gift. They got
[1:41:08] a psalm. They got He comes among them.
[1:41:11] They're living immoral. There's all
[1:41:12] kinds of promiscuous living going on.
[1:41:14] It's full of corruption. It's full of
[1:41:16] sin. Amen, brother Brian. He could have
[1:41:18] went among them and said, "Forget you
[1:41:20] Corinthians. I'm going to the Ephesians
[1:41:22] because, praise God, I can preach
[1:41:24] predestination down there. Praise God,
[1:41:26] I'm going to the Romans. I'm going over
[1:41:28] to the Hebrews because I can preach the
[1:41:30] deep things there. Bless God, I'm going
[1:41:32] to forget all y'all. I've labored and
[1:41:34] labored and worked and worked and
[1:41:36] everything I preach I come back and
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; but he didn't stop there brother Mark in
[1:41:41] 2 Corinthians 7:16 he said I rejoice
[1:41:44] therefore
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; go ahead
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; yes sir hallelujah
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; now they he I'm closing but I'm feeling
[1:41:53] good he can walked and said bless God
[1:41:54] you bunch of Corinthians I'm going to
[1:41:56] tell y'all right now if you don't get
[1:41:57] your act together and you don't get
[1:41:59] these gifts I'm going to tell you right
[1:42:00] now bless God
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; sir come
[1:42:05] I rejoice and have confidence in you,
[1:42:09] dear God. Paul, in the Corinthians, in
[1:42:12] all things. I got a question for you.
[1:42:15] How could Paul have Oh, God. How could
[1:42:18] Paul have confidence in the Corinthians?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Can I say it to you the same way he
[1:42:23] could in the Galatians? Galatians 5:10,
[1:42:27] he said, "I have confidence in you
[1:42:29] through the Lord." Well, glory to God.
[1:42:32] With all their mistakes, with all their
[1:42:34] failures, with all their shortcomings,
[1:42:37] with all their sexual sins, with all
[1:42:39] their out of order gifts, with all their
[1:42:41] nonsense, oh God, Paul could still walk
[1:42:44] to him and he could look him in the face
[1:42:46] and say, "I got confidence in you. I got
[1:42:49] confidence you." Oh, can I say this
[1:42:51] tonight? Amen. Thank God he don't throw
[1:42:53] the clay away. I say, "Thank God." Amen.
[1:42:56] that he don't anoint men to come to the
[1:42:58] pullpit and beat us till we're nothing
[1:43:00] but pulps. Come on, church. How many
[1:43:02] times has our pastor walked out here and
[1:43:05] known all kinds of situations and had
[1:43:07] every reason to lay a axe to the root of
[1:43:09] every tree, but he come out here and
[1:43:12] said, "I bless you and I pray God use
[1:43:14] you and I pray God anoint you." You know
[1:43:17] why? Because he knows God.
[1:43:20] I'm going to close by saying this. He
[1:43:22] knows the people he's talking to. God
[1:43:25] has confidence in them.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I Can I Can I tell you
[1:43:29] something? To fix a lot of situations,
[1:43:31] you ain't got to get nasty. You ain't
[1:43:33] got to get mean.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. You ain't got to get ugly. All
[1:43:37] you got to do is this. Amen. I don't
[1:43:39] agree with what they're doing, but I got
[1:43:40] confidence in them because they're God's
[1:43:42] children.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Well, this church is doing that and this
[1:43:51] preacher's pushing this and this
[1:43:52] preacher doing that and this preacher
[1:43:53] preaching. Amen. God bless them all.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; God bless them all. I love them, but I
[1:43:58] don't have no confidence in what they're
[1:44:00] doing. I don't agree with what they're
[1:44:02] doing, but I have confidence in the one
[1:44:04] they're serving.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. You can't have confidence
[1:44:08] and criticalness at the same time.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Without spiritual confidence as the
[1:44:12] musicians are coming, you'll never be
[1:44:14] able to help
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; or be helped.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; See, it's a confidence. Paul Paul had to
[1:44:21] approach them as the children of God.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; He had to approach them as the people of
[1:44:26] God with all their faults and all their
[1:44:30] failures
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; and all the mishaps and all the
[1:44:34] mistakes,
[1:44:39] all their little
[1:44:41] leadership.
[1:44:42] Come on folks, Paul come among them and
[1:44:44] preach the message. Preach the truth to
[1:44:46] them.
[1:44:48] Paul walk off from the church and they
[1:44:49] go back to their gifts
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; and he come right back there and he
[1:44:54] said, "But I have confidence in you
[1:44:56] all."
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it'll hit you at lunch
[1:45:02] tomorrow.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; God's got confidence in you.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Is that Is that Hello? Is that striking
[1:45:15] your heart?
[1:45:16] God's got confidence in you. Throw you
[1:45:19] away. He don't throw away stuff he has
[1:45:22] confidence in.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Replace you. He don't replace things he
[1:45:28] has confidence in.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Kick you aside. He don't do that
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; cuz he's got confidence in you.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; His confidence is not in our flesh. His
[1:45:40] confidence is not in our abilities. See,
[1:45:44] if you can get your confidence in the
[1:45:45] right place,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; everything will change. Yes, sir.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember Peter out there fishing
[1:45:51] that night? Brother Dave Paul, he was a
[1:45:53] fisherman, a fisherman. He knew how to
[1:45:56] fish. He knew the tricks. He knew the
[1:45:58] bait. He kn he knew how to hold his
[1:45:59] mouth right and everything, get them
[1:46:01] fish out of that water. And brother, he
[1:46:03] got out there and maybe maybe he got a
[1:46:05] little maybe he got a little a little
[1:46:07] confident in his human ability to fish.
[1:46:10] Bless God. I'm a fisherman. I go out
[1:46:13] there every time I drop that net in the
[1:46:14] water and get fish. Won't never be a
[1:46:16] time I don't get fish. And he goes out
[1:46:18] there and drops the net in. Pulls it up
[1:46:20] and it's empty. Now you talking about
[1:46:22] hurting some fisherman's pride.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Dropped it again.
[1:46:27] He said, "I'll pull them pull them up
[1:46:29] this time."
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Hey, you caught any fish?
[1:46:34] Maybe I'm in the wrong spot tonight. I
[1:46:36] don't know."
[1:46:38] Then all of a sudden, Jesus come walking
[1:46:40] by.
[1:46:42] Jesus said, "What are you doing?" He
[1:46:44] said, "I'm fishing." How many have you
[1:46:45] taken? I've told all night and taken
[1:46:47] none.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, he had told all night and
[1:46:51] taken none. And you know what he said?
[1:46:53] He said, "Let down thy net again."
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; But you know what he done? The only
[1:46:58] thing changed is where his confidence
[1:46:59] was.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Before it was in his ability to fish,
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; but this time he said, "At thy word,
[1:47:06] Lord.
[1:47:08] At thy word, Lord, I'll let down the
[1:47:11] When he positioned his confidence in the
[1:47:13] word, he let down the net. And he
[1:47:16] brought up so much fish, he like to
[1:47:17] broke the net. What are you saying? I'm
[1:47:19] saying you phone yourself away. You've
[1:47:22] thrown Come on. You're throwing things
[1:47:24] away because you just lost spiritual
[1:47:26] confidence. But if you'll get it
[1:47:27] positioned back in the word and begin to
[1:47:30] testify, God has confidence in me. God
[1:47:33] has confidence in my family.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; God has confidence in me. He put a seed
[1:47:38] in my soul
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; and he's not going to throw me away.
[1:47:40] Won't you stand to your feet tonight?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, God's got confidence in you,
[1:47:46] church.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You don't have confidence in your flesh.
[1:47:49] He don't have confidence in our human
[1:47:51] abilities.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; But he does have confidence in the seed.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That he placed in our soul
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] Oh, I was just studying that the other
[1:48:05] day, brother Brian. I got there sitting
[1:48:06] there thinking, I got to just dramatize
[1:48:08] in my mind. You know, all them
[1:48:10] Corinthians sitting there and they heard
[1:48:12] Paul was coming to preach that day.
[1:48:14] And buddy, they knew he was just going
[1:48:17] to come in there and lay them out.
[1:48:19] He walked in there and said, "I rejoice
[1:48:22] over you all.
[1:48:25] Y'all caused me anguish and heartache
[1:48:27] and tears and
[1:48:30] but I got confidence in you."
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, if you tonight can let the
[1:48:35] Holy Spirit reposition
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; your confidence,
[1:48:40] it'll change a lot of things.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; I say it to you.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You're not uncalled. You're not serpent
[1:48:49] seed. You're not an accident. No, sir.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; You're not a mistake.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; You just been through some things
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; and you lost your spiritual confidence.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] But if you could hold it tonight,
[1:49:03] there's a great reward coming to it.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; If you can put your confidence in him,
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; if you could hold that confidence,
[1:49:12] there's a reward coming.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It's like somebody told me one time,
[1:49:15] they said, they said, "Brother Andrew,
[1:49:16] they said, you raise your children and
[1:49:19] they said, you raise one, you're raising
[1:49:21] them and one goes to the world." I never
[1:49:22] will forget an old brother told me, he
[1:49:24] said, "One goes to the world." He says,
[1:49:25] 'Now, what you don't do, he said, is you
[1:49:26] don't pick up the phone and call the
[1:49:28] state to come pick up your kids because
[1:49:29] you failed on one. Kind of looked at
[1:49:32] him. I was like, what? He said, 'N no,
[1:49:34] you just do spiritual warfare. He said,
[1:49:36] you just stand there and say, Devil, I
[1:49:38] did everything I knew to do, but they're
[1:49:39] coming back and these are going to stand
[1:49:41] the right way. I said, brother, what do
[1:49:43] you I said, what? He said, it's called
[1:49:45] Holy Ghost confidence. I said, oh,
[1:49:47] that's it. That's why I don't believe in
[1:49:49] psychology. I believe in Holy Ghost
[1:49:51] confidence. Holy Ghost confidence stays
[1:49:53] with the word in the face of every
[1:49:55] situation. Yes, sir.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; It says we're not throwing this family
[1:49:58] away.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; We're not throwing this marriage away.
[1:50:00] We're not throwing this ministry away.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; We're not throwing the potentials of God
[1:50:04] away.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; I don't have confidence in the ability
[1:50:06] of man to bring it to pass. But I do
[1:50:08] have confidence in God.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And I know he has confidence in you.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him tonight?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; How many say, Lord, I thank you for the
[1:50:17] truth. Lord,
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I thank you for a shepherd. I thank you
[1:50:20] for a Holy Ghost fil shepherd. Lord, I
[1:50:23] thank you for for men of God that are
[1:50:25] identified in the anointing. They're
[1:50:26] identified in the supernatural. Listen,
[1:50:28] I believe it tonight. I believe the Holy
[1:50:30] Spirit's right here to restore spiritual
[1:50:32] confidence tonight. Let's just bow our
[1:50:34] hearts together. Amen. How many say,
[1:50:35] "Lord, restore my spiritual confidence.
[1:50:39] I don't want to throw it away. I know I
[1:50:41] know things are looking dark right now.
[1:50:44] I know things are looking bleak.
[1:50:46] Lord, I know I know there's issues and
[1:50:48] problems, but Lord, I want to hold this
[1:50:50] in my heart tonight. Lord, maybe you're
[1:50:54] here tonight and the enemy is trying to
[1:50:56] wreck your family or steal your
[1:50:57] children. Or maybe you're going through
[1:50:59] a personal battle yourself. You say,
[1:51:01] "Lord, I need that. I need that
[1:51:03] confidence tonight." Amen. I believe it.
[1:51:06] I believe the Holy Spirit's right here
[1:51:07] tonight. Amen. I believe he's here to
[1:51:10] lead. I believe he's here to guide.
[1:51:11] Almighty God, Father, in this building
[1:51:13] tonight are your children. And Lord, we
[1:51:16] have approached them by the preaching of
[1:51:17] the word of life. Father, we stand here
[1:51:20] tonight to speak to them, Lord, not not
[1:51:23] to degrade them, Lord, but to preach the
[1:51:25] promises of life over them. Now, Father,
[1:51:28] I know tonight I'm speaking to what you
[1:51:31] deem more valuable than your own blood.
[1:51:35] Lord, I recognize tonight I'm speaking
[1:51:37] to those that have been washed by that
[1:51:39] blood and they've been called by your
[1:51:41] name. Lord, your prophet said, Lord, you
[1:51:44] chose them by election just as you did
[1:51:46] Abraham and put confidence in them.
[1:51:48] Then, Lord, that's the driving force
[1:51:50] behind the sermons that we preach, Lord.
[1:51:53] Lord, it's the driving force behind the
[1:51:55] behind the anointing that's in the
[1:51:56] building, Lord. Father, it's why these
[1:51:59] men of God, it's why our pastor labor so
[1:52:01] hard under that anointing. For Lord, we
[1:52:03] know the devil's doing everything he can
[1:52:05] through one mistake or through one
[1:52:07] besetting sin or through one habit or
[1:52:09] one wrong thought, Lord, or one wrong
[1:52:11] situation. Lord, we know the devil's
[1:52:13] doing everything he can to hijack the
[1:52:15] spiritual confidence of the church. But
[1:52:17] Lord, tonight we join our faith together
[1:52:19] as a body of believers. And Lord, no
[1:52:21] matter how many things may be going
[1:52:23] wrong or how many situations may be on
[1:52:25] the horizon or we might be walking
[1:52:27] through the middle of them right now,
[1:52:30] Lord, we refuse. We refuse to throw away
[1:52:32] our spiritual confidence. For Lord, we
[1:52:35] know there's a great recompense of
[1:52:36] reward coming to it. Now, Father, I pray
[1:52:39] tonight, dear God, I pray that every
[1:52:41] every pilot here, Lord, every every
[1:52:44] family here, Lord, would see that, Lord,
[1:52:47] you placed a shepherd among us, Lord.
[1:52:49] Father, a man of God that just in that
[1:52:51] World War II when they were attacked,
[1:52:53] that that shepherd stayed by that by
[1:52:55] that by that pilot, Lord, and they flew
[1:52:57] it because that shepherd kept a visual
[1:52:59] contact. Father, I believe tonight that
[1:53:01] you've sent gifts in this body, Lord,
[1:53:03] men of God, to study and stay in prayer
[1:53:06] and stay before you, Lord, to labor
[1:53:08] underneath a burden. Father, Lord, I
[1:53:10] want to tell that devil tonight, Satan,
[1:53:12] you will not hijack one of these pilots,
[1:53:14] Lord. Lord, you will not allow Satan to
[1:53:17] hijack one of your children. Lord, you
[1:53:19] will not allow Satan to to come in and
[1:53:21] sever their communication with you and
[1:53:23] cut off their connection with your
[1:53:25] spirit and lead them into a devil's
[1:53:27] hell, into a sinner's grave. Oh, no.
[1:53:29] Lord, your word is our protection. Lord,
[1:53:32] just as the eagle had confidence in her
[1:53:34] wings, Father, I've got confidence in
[1:53:36] the protection of this word. And Lord, I
[1:53:38] know that you're going to safely lead
[1:53:40] every one of your children to the shores
[1:53:41] of glory. Father, I bind every
[1:53:44] discouraging spirit. Lord, I bind every
[1:53:47] spirit of discouragement that tries to
[1:53:48] creep in, Lord. Father, may that spirit
[1:53:51] of discouragement be bound tonight. And
[1:53:53] Lord, may the anointing of the Holy
[1:53:55] Spirit move throughout this congregation
[1:53:57] of believers. Father, if there be a
[1:53:59] singer here tonight, Lord, that's lost
[1:54:01] their spiritual confidence, may they get
[1:54:03] it back tonight. Father, if there be a
[1:54:05] minister, Lord, that's discouraged, may
[1:54:07] they get that spiritual confidence back.
[1:54:10] Lord, if there's a musician, Lord, or
[1:54:12] Lord, a Sunday school teacher, trustee,
[1:54:14] deacon, whatever office they may hold,
[1:54:16] Lord, Lord, may they get that spiritual
[1:54:19] confidence back tonight. Father, if
[1:54:21] there be just a lay member of Grace
[1:54:23] Tabernacle, Lord, may they get that
[1:54:25] spiritual confidence back tonight. And
[1:54:27] may they hold fast that confidence
[1:54:30] firm from the beginning until the end.
[1:54:34] In Jesus name we pray. In Jesus name we
[1:54:38] pray.
[1:54:40] Amen. God bless you tonight friends. You
[1:54:42] love him.

[1:57:00] I just want to thank
[1:57:03] you,
[1:57:05] Lord.
[1:57:08] I just want to thank you, Lord.
[1:57:13] I want to love
[1:57:16] you,
[1:57:18] Lord.
[1:57:21] Love
[1:57:23] you,
[1:57:24] Lord.
[1:57:26] I want to love
[1:57:29] you,
[1:57:31] Lord.
[1:57:34] I just want to love you, Lord.
[1:57:39] I want to praise
[1:57:43] you, Lord.
[1:57:47] Praise
[1:57:49] you,
[1:57:51] Lord.
[1:57:54] I want to praise
[1:57:57] you, Lord.
[1:58:00] I just want to praise you, Lord. Well, I
[1:58:06] say thank
[1:58:09] you, Lord.
[1:58:13] Thank
[1:58:15] you,
[1:58:17] Lord.
[1:58:20] Thank
[1:58:21] you,
[1:58:23] Lord.
[1:58:26] Well, I just want to thank you, Lord,
[1:58:31] and I want to praise you.
[1:58:37] Yes, my Lord, I want to praise you.
[1:58:42] Oh, I give you all my praise.
[1:58:46] Praise.
[1:58:48] Praise you, Lord. I just want to praise
[1:58:55] you, Lord.
[1:59:00] Amen. How many appreciate that message
[1:59:02] tonight?
[1:59:04] What a a tremendous thought.
[1:59:08] Amen.
[1:59:09] You know, we uh any one of us I I know
[1:59:13] never feel worthy and uh to be for
[1:59:17] anybody to have confidence in me and I
[1:59:18] know you don't either, but I think
[1:59:20] that's a good reminder that that God
[1:59:22] would anything God has confidence in, we
[1:59:25] ought to have confidence in. Amen. And
[1:59:28] though we don't feel worthy, but we have
[1:59:29] a God that's in us that every one of us
[1:59:31] can have confidence in each other and
[1:59:33] that we can strengthen one another. I I
[1:59:36] don't I I know you know it's true, but I
[1:59:39] appreciate what brother Andrew
[1:59:40] ministered tonight and uh you know
[1:59:42] especially and he would uh talk about
[1:59:45] being edifying to one another and you
[1:59:48] know it really is a good thing uh to
[1:59:50] take the time and encourage one another.
[1:59:53] Paul said to do it every day. Paul said
[1:59:55] do it daily. That tells you how needy
[1:59:58] that we are as a people that we need to
[2:00:00] be encouraged and we ought to encourage
[2:00:02] one another and and and edify one
[2:00:05] another in the word of God. And so uh
[2:00:07] don't I think every day I I challenged
[2:00:10] the church here a few months ago. I
[2:00:11] don't know how many's kept the
[2:00:12] challenge, but um I just learned about
[2:00:16] uh keeping streaks and although I don't
[2:00:19] have any streaks. Uh but but uh if you
[2:00:23] if you want to keep a streak, I think
[2:00:24] that's the streak we ought to keep is
[2:00:26] every day I should encourage somebody
[2:00:28] and and maybe pick a different person
[2:00:30] each day and send them a text or a phone
[2:00:32] call or something and pray for somebody
[2:00:34] new every day. And we ought to be
[2:00:36] encouraging one another. And if we're
[2:00:38] going to have streaks, that's the
[2:00:39] streaks we ought to have. Is that old
[2:00:40] news or something? All these kids ain't
[2:00:42] even they ain't even smiling about it.
[2:00:44] That's that's old news. Okay, I'll go
[2:00:46] back to MySpace then cuz I was trying to
[2:00:49] be up to up in the times. But I think if
[2:00:52] we ought to have a streak, that's what
[2:00:53] we ought to have a streak in. I I you
[2:00:55] not not that anybody's counting, but it
[2:00:57] it is sure rewarding. I had a a a member
[2:01:01] of the church that sent me a message
[2:01:03] yesterday just out of the blue and said,
[2:01:05] "Hey, I just want you to know I love you
[2:01:06] and appreciate all you do for my family
[2:01:09] and I'm praying for you and and you know
[2:01:11] how good it makes you feel to see not
[2:01:12] that you don't think people love you. It
[2:01:14] just it it's good to know uh that people
[2:01:17] are behind you and and uh and we ought
[2:01:19] to do that with one another." And so I I
[2:01:22] make that a purpose in my heart is to is
[2:01:24] to reach out to somebody every day. And
[2:01:26] I you know what we don't we only have a
[2:01:28] few years to live on this earth and you
[2:01:30] don't ever know how many days that we
[2:01:33] have left or we we we don't know that.
[2:01:36] But if every moment that we have, we
[2:01:38] ought to we ought to be able to spend it
[2:01:39] encouraging somebody that we would leave
[2:01:42] behind us a life or a testimony that
[2:01:45] somebody could say, "Lord, I want to
[2:01:47] have that same God that they had in me.
[2:01:49] I I want to be a witness to somebody and
[2:01:52] something that could be
[2:01:54] a something that somebody could have
[2:01:56] confidence in and I just appreciate what
[2:01:58] the Lord has done for us and appreciate
[2:02:01] what he said and and I appreciate every
[2:02:04] one of you and I have confidence in you.
[2:02:05] I can say what brother Andrew said. I've
[2:02:08] seen God do miracles in every one of
[2:02:10] your lives. uh testimonies. I I know
[2:02:12] testimonies from every one of you and
[2:02:14] you know them about me and and I we can
[2:02:17] all look around the church and know that
[2:02:18] God has done miracles among us and I
[2:02:21] appreciate God for that and and I thank
[2:02:23] God for every one of you and thank him
[2:02:25] for your stand and it's an encouragement
[2:02:27] to me every time I and uh you know me
[2:02:31] and my wife we come to church early a
[2:02:32] lot of times and sometimes an hour early
[2:02:34] and there's nobody here and and uh I I
[2:02:37] had a walked in the other day. It was
[2:02:39] just me and Sarah and I walked in the
[2:02:42] back room. A little bit later, Noah born
[2:02:44] Trager came in. I said, "Well, Noah," I
[2:02:46] said, "Uh, I'll lead songs and you
[2:02:48] preach and Sarah's going to say, "Amen.
[2:02:49] We're just going to have church." And
[2:02:51] and he said, "No, there's going to be
[2:02:53] other people come." I said, "Well, I'm
[2:02:54] sure they are, but you know, I but if
[2:02:56] they ain't, we're going to have church
[2:02:58] anyway." But, you know, it just does
[2:02:59] something to your heart cuz every time I
[2:03:01] I remember walking in this building when
[2:03:03] there was nobody in it and and I know
[2:03:05] what God has done in our life and to be
[2:03:07] able to bring us together and and I
[2:03:10] don't know if y'all know this, but I
[2:03:11] stood in this building by myself praying
[2:03:13] and asking God for direction after God
[2:03:16] had put it on my heart to be here. And
[2:03:18] and uh I laid on my face for hours and
[2:03:20] all night long in this same building
[2:03:22] when there was nobody in here but me and
[2:03:24] God. So, it does my heart good when I
[2:03:26] walk in it and see somebody that comes
[2:03:28] in that's hungering for the word of God.
[2:03:30] And I thank God of all the labor and the
[2:03:32] effort and the money and the sacrifice
[2:03:34] and the time that everybody put in,
[2:03:36] there's a hungry heart somewhere that
[2:03:38] wants something from the Lord. And so,
[2:03:39] it's worth it all. And so, I just thank
[2:03:41] God every time I see one of you walk in
[2:03:43] them doors that it gives me such a such
[2:03:46] an encouragement. There's such a
[2:03:48] fulfillment in it to see somebody come
[2:03:49] in the house of God and hungering for
[2:03:51] the word of God. And I don't know what
[2:03:53] else I could ever do in this life. I've
[2:03:55] tried everything else to bring
[2:03:57] satisfaction. And none of it was none of
[2:03:59] it was enough. But this is the only
[2:04:00] thing I've ever done in my life that I
[2:04:02] was satisfied with what I was doing
[2:04:05] because every every day is a reward. I
[2:04:08] don't wake up that I'm not rewarded for
[2:04:10] uh was seeing a somebody that's on fire
[2:04:12] for God. And it's so rewarding to see
[2:04:15] people serving God. And so I just say
[2:04:17] God bless you tonight. I sure appreciate
[2:04:19] brother Andrew and appreciate the
[2:04:21] message that he had tonight. Let's just
[2:04:22] bow our heads together. Gracious
[2:04:25] heavenly father. Lord, we just thank
[2:04:27] you, Lord, for the word that you brought
[2:04:30] to us. And Lord, what a word of
[2:04:32] encouragement, Lord, that I I know many,
[2:04:35] Lord, that are that are down, Lord, and
[2:04:37] maybe struggling with things in their
[2:04:39] spirit. But Lord, I just thank you that
[2:04:42] you'd send a man of God by, Lord, to say
[2:04:44] that you have confidence in every one of
[2:04:46] us. Lord, I just ask you tonight, Lord,
[2:04:49] that you would go with every believer.
[2:04:51] And Lord, that they'd be strengthened by
[2:04:53] this word. Lord, I pray that tomorrow,
[2:04:55] Lord, that we would get up out of bed,
[2:04:57] Lord, that there would be such a a
[2:05:00] revival in their heart. Lord, I pray
[2:05:01] there would be a joy, Lord, a a
[2:05:04] restoration of joy, Lord. And God, I
[2:05:06] pray there'd be a new found purpose,
[2:05:08] Lord. I pray there'd be a zeal in their
[2:05:10] heart again, Lord. Let them know that
[2:05:12] all isn't lost, Lord. But we have a
[2:05:14] purpose for serving you, Lord. We have a
[2:05:16] calling, Lord. You've brought us
[2:05:17] together for a reason. And Lord, I pray
[2:05:19] that you would give him such a courage
[2:05:21] to go through another day just to stand
[2:05:22] upon your word. God, I pray you'd bless
[2:05:25] our brother for his ministry that he
[2:05:27] spoke tonight, Lord. And God, I pray
[2:05:29] you'd bring us back safely. Bless
[2:05:31] brother Josh Martin, Lord, as he would
[2:05:33] make uh preparation to come, Lord. I
[2:05:35] pray, God, that you would fill him with
[2:05:37] such an anointing, God, on Sunday, Lord,
[2:05:39] that he would speak to every heart and
[2:05:41] we'd be blessed by it. Lord, we thank
[2:05:43] you for it now in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:05:45] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you
[2:05:49] go tonight. Amen. We'll take the name of
[2:05:54] Jesus with you,
[2:05:58] child of comfort and of joy.
[2:06:02] For I know he will joy and comfort give
[2:06:07] you. So take it everywhere you go.
[2:06:12] Praise his name.
[2:06:17] I see
[2:06:19] the hope of earth,
[2:06:22] joy of heaven,
[2:06:24] a precious name.
[2:06:27] Oh, how sweet
[2:06:30] the hope of earth and joy of heaven.
[2:06:35] I say take the name of Jesus with you
[2:06:41] out of comfort and of joy.
[2:06:45] I know he will more
[2:06:49] give you. So take it everywhere you go.
[2:06:56] Precious.
[2:06:58] Oh, how sweet the whole pervert.
