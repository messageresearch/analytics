[58:08] Christ we pray amen and amen and God
[58:12] bless you tonight if you have your
[58:14] Bibles I would like to look into the
[58:16] word here if we could in 1 John chapter
[58:18] 3 and verse 8 1 John 3 and verse eight
[58:22] I'm a little basy in this thing if you
[58:23] can adjust them 1 John 3
[58:26] in verse eight amen um I'd like to look
[58:30] in verse eight and also verse n amen
[58:33] it's so it's such an honor to have so
[58:35] many men of God here with us tonight I'm
[58:37] just looking across the congregation
[58:39] trying to see all these preachers and I
[58:41] said my goodness what am I doing up here
[58:43] amen I make a better amener than a
[58:45] preacher amen but amen but I I certainly
[58:48] do appreciate each of you that it could
[58:50] be here tonight amen 1 John chapter 3
[58:53] and verse 8 and verse 9
[58:56] now he that committs
[58:58] sin is of the devil for the devil sinth
[59:03] from the
[59:04] beginning and for this purpose the Son
[59:07] of God was
[59:09] manifested that he might be able to
[59:11] destroy the works of the devil now
[59:16] whosoever is born of God doeth not
[59:19] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[59:24] and he cannot sin
[59:26] because he is
[59:27] born of God Amen you may be seated
[59:31] tonight we want to thank you amen if you
[59:34] can give me a little more in my Monitor
[59:35] and I'll adjust it from here amen uh we
[59:38] just want to look at this amen for a few
[59:40] minutes tonight and I want to talk to
[59:41] you about
[59:44] Grace for your
[59:46] dirt Grace for your dirt amen uh I I I
[59:51] look tonight to realize uh that a
[59:54] prophet has been Among Us and has said
[59:57] some very powerful things and amen and I
[59:59] want to just tell you up front I'm a
[1:00:01] message preacher so amen you forgive me
[1:00:04] for preaching what I believe but amen
[1:00:06] I'm not comfortable anywhere else so I
[1:00:08] just go ahead and speak from my heart
[1:00:10] and uh you know the prophet of God said
[1:00:12] this amen he said I've seen squirrels
[1:00:14] appear six different times and he says
[1:00:17] just see he can create squirrels the
[1:00:19] same as he can create flies or frogs or
[1:00:21] anything else he's God he's a Creator
[1:00:24] and no mortal being but then When sin of
[1:00:27] a mortal is confessed and dropped into
[1:00:29] the Clorox bleach of Jesus Christ it
[1:00:31] bleaches all the sin he's purely
[1:00:34] unadulterated without sin and without
[1:00:36] fault and he that is born of God doeth
[1:00:39] not commit sin he cannot sin for the
[1:00:42] bleach stands between him and God and
[1:00:44] how could it ever get there when it
[1:00:47] breaks up and sends it right back to the
[1:00:49] one who perverted it oh he said I feel
[1:00:52] religious I tell you I get stimulation
[1:00:55] he said to know as this begins this
[1:00:58] revival in the first seal he said he
[1:00:59] that is born of God do not commit sin
[1:01:01] for he cannot sin how can you make him a
[1:01:04] sinner when the bleach of the blood of
[1:01:06] Jesus Christ is between him and God now
[1:01:09] that would scatter sin till there would
[1:01:11] be nothing left of it how can that pure
[1:01:14] blood of Christ ever let sin pass
[1:01:17] through there it cannot and John 1 and
[1:01:20] verse2 John says but as many as received
[1:01:23] him to them he gave power power to
[1:01:27] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:01:29] believe on his name which were born not
[1:01:31] of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of
[1:01:35] the will of man but of God Amen isn't
[1:01:38] that amazing beautiful tonight to know
[1:01:40] amen that you are born of God not of man
[1:01:44] not of Flesh not of the will of man but
[1:01:47] of God brother man I'm going to say
[1:01:48] something beautiful about this he said
[1:01:50] now listen I want you to know your
[1:01:51] adoption is not your birth your adoption
[1:01:54] is your placing and you're born again
[1:01:57] see you're predestin you're born again
[1:01:59] of the spirit of God we are the sons of
[1:02:01] God but we are predestinated now here's
[1:02:03] what I'm trying to get to you for the
[1:02:05] sons of this last day we're
[1:02:07] predestinated unto adoption now we are
[1:02:10] here we are now this is what hurts the
[1:02:12] Pentecostals a little they say I got
[1:02:15] born again praise the Lord I got the
[1:02:17] Holy Ghost he said now that's fine
[1:02:19] you're a child of God that's right but
[1:02:22] that ain't what I'm talking about see
[1:02:24] we're predestin unto adoption and
[1:02:27] adoption is your placing amen now we
[1:02:30] find out tonight we're born of the will
[1:02:33] of God Amen but you know there's a
[1:02:35] furtherment of the experience of
[1:02:37] children of God besides birth ain't you
[1:02:40] glad that God had more for us as
[1:02:41] children when we were born we were born
[1:02:44] but we had to move on into something
[1:02:46] amen and and you know here in the signs
[1:02:48] of his coming 62 brother man says if the
[1:02:50] it's the word of the Lord he said that
[1:02:52] it's Prem it's pre premeditated thought
[1:02:56] now that's how we have eternal life
[1:02:59] because we are spoken into existence by
[1:03:03] God well hallelujah amen here's here's a
[1:03:06] real word Prophet we've been spoken into
[1:03:09] existence by God we didn't join into a
[1:03:12] church we are born by the word see the
[1:03:14] Original Seed God said let there be and
[1:03:17] there was and that's the way God borns
[1:03:20] his children today in the womb of their
[1:03:22] heart is with his word and his word
[1:03:24] takes root and then begins to grow now
[1:03:27] how can the spirit in the human heart
[1:03:29] say it's of God and then deny the word
[1:03:32] amen I tell you this I believe this in
[1:03:34] in wisdom versus faith brother B say it
[1:03:36] again now if you're a born again child
[1:03:38] of God you are and you got the holy
[1:03:41] spirit in you you are the manifestation
[1:03:44] of God's spoken word before it was a
[1:03:47] word it has to be a thought before it
[1:03:49] can be a word and a word is a spoken
[1:03:51] thought now thoughts was in God and when
[1:03:55] you were in
[1:03:57] eternity when when we were in God in
[1:04:00] eternity and we were spoken into
[1:04:03] existence by his word amen I tell you
[1:04:06] what amen you start looking at some of
[1:04:08] these things and begin to realize amen
[1:04:11] spoken into existence by his word amen
[1:04:14] children of God not just children of man
[1:04:17] but born of the will of God Amen Let me
[1:04:20] let me just make it in the true Easter
[1:04:22] seal or true true Easter seal brother R
[1:04:24] says it very powerfully he says listen
[1:04:26] uh there's a tree of death which was
[1:04:28] your mother and she brought you into n
[1:04:30] natural life he said but Christ's birth
[1:04:32] through spiritual life see now if you
[1:04:35] live by a woman you die he said but all
[1:04:38] that's born of a man lives and all that
[1:04:41] comes by the woman is natural and all
[1:04:43] that comes from man is spiritual not the
[1:04:46] man here but the man Christ Jesus see
[1:04:49] when you were born of your mother you
[1:04:50] were born into death but when you were
[1:04:53] born of the word Christ Jesus then you
[1:04:55] were born into life amen I believe it
[1:04:58] today I believe God is bringing
[1:05:00] spiritual children into this age that
[1:05:03] we're living in by his word there are
[1:05:05] children being borned amen borned into
[1:05:08] life amen indivisible Union brother BR
[1:05:11] makes it real explanatory here and
[1:05:13] begins to tell you what kind of children
[1:05:14] you are he says listen another thing I
[1:05:17] want you to notice amen what kind of
[1:05:20] children she is bearing he said listen
[1:05:22] this will tell you what your papa is
[1:05:24] whether it's a first ey or the second
[1:05:26] Adam you believe both has children don't
[1:05:28] they and there's a first Adam and a
[1:05:30] second Adam but if the church brings
[1:05:32] forth a child of the second Adam he acts
[1:05:36] like the second way of second Adam's way
[1:05:39] of
[1:05:42] acting I love how the prophet says it he
[1:05:44] said the second Adam's way of acting
[1:05:47] yall know what that is don't you how
[1:05:48] does the second Adam's children act he
[1:05:51] said just like they did on the day of
[1:05:53] Pentecost that's right just like they
[1:05:55] did on the day of Pentecost amen you
[1:05:57] said well I don't know which Adam I'm
[1:05:59] born of well how'd you get your birth
[1:06:01] was it just a church joining was it just
[1:06:03] an agreement to somebody's Doctrine or
[1:06:05] did you get born to the word of God that
[1:06:08] it that gave you an ignition in your
[1:06:10] soul and experience with a living God
[1:06:13] I'll tell you this invisible Union he'll
[1:06:15] say a true picture of the modern church
[1:06:17] today she don't this this neither does
[1:06:19] this modern church one of these here
[1:06:22] screaming shouting tongue speaking acts
[1:06:24] 238 Young running around here see she
[1:06:27] don't want them whooping and crying and
[1:06:29] screaming and amen and Hallelujah why
[1:06:32] such a child would immediately put her
[1:06:35] out of her denomination they had one
[1:06:37] like that and do to their churches why
[1:06:38] they' throw her out right quick amen why
[1:06:41] you let stuff like that go on he here's
[1:06:43] a prophet telling you if you're a part
[1:06:45] of denomination brother Matt here's what
[1:06:47] they'd say why you let this kind of
[1:06:49] stuff go on in your church amen but a
[1:06:51] prophet of God said see amen but they're
[1:06:53] pregnated with something amen the
[1:06:56] churches are growing in the world
[1:06:57] they're pregnated with something he said
[1:07:00] because they're bringing forth members
[1:07:01] all the time but she don't want none of
[1:07:04] them screaming hollering blabbering acts
[1:07:06] 238 miserable creatures she thinks they
[1:07:09] are why it would certainly embarrass her
[1:07:12] it would ruin her her educated ethical
[1:07:15] scientific Society Church she belongs to
[1:07:18] well they would throw her out at the
[1:07:19] next Council she can't have it so she
[1:07:21] don't want to be pregnated with the word
[1:07:24] because that's the only only kind this
[1:07:26] word can bring forth right Born of the
[1:07:29] spirit of God it has the spirit of God
[1:07:31] in it no intellectual Church joining
[1:07:34] Creed joining bobbed haired painted face
[1:07:37] there's no such a thing in all of that
[1:07:39] you can't find that in the word of God
[1:07:41] but you can find an oldfashioned Holy
[1:07:44] Ghost Field child born of the spirit of
[1:07:46] God screaming hollering shouting and
[1:07:49] praising God I pray it never goes out of
[1:07:52] style I pray the oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:07:54] meetings never leave us friends I pray
[1:07:57] there's an atmosphere if there's a
[1:07:59] person in here tonight I pray there's
[1:08:01] such an atmosphere that they can find
[1:08:03] the birth in the middle of this church
[1:08:06] tonight amen I believe tonight I believe
[1:08:08] that people can be born again under the
[1:08:10] atmosphere of God y'all believe that
[1:08:12] brother brand said you let John do come
[1:08:14] in and get in the right atmosphere and
[1:08:16] if he ever gets under it he'll know just
[1:08:18] as sure as there's a God he'll get an
[1:08:20] experience because he gets in the right
[1:08:22] atmosphere I'll tell you this this is
[1:08:24] how we are to bring forth members it
[1:08:26] ought to be another act too and if we
[1:08:28] brought forth members like that you can
[1:08:30] put all the pressure you want on them
[1:08:32] but they're built to handle the pressure
[1:08:35] come on they're not going to fold under
[1:08:36] Le oia because they're built to handle
[1:08:39] the pressure I'm afraid that's what's
[1:08:40] going on we got too many hot house
[1:08:42] plants amen too many chickens amen it
[1:08:45] ain't never been amen the mate ain't
[1:08:47] never been in the house with them yall
[1:08:49] say preacher amen I don't know about
[1:08:51] Doctrine well I'll tell you let's make
[1:08:53] it simple you got some chickens amen if
[1:08:55] you got to let a mate the maale bird get
[1:08:57] in there before you can have little
[1:08:59] chickens and too many times we locked
[1:09:01] out the male bird we got the church but
[1:09:04] what we need is the mail part amen we
[1:09:06] need Christ to come in the church and to
[1:09:09] ignite it to bring little ones right on
[1:09:11] but if God ever brings a little one in
[1:09:13] the church they'll have to be born the
[1:09:15] same way they were in the book of Acts
[1:09:18] they'll have to be born the same
[1:09:21] way
[1:09:22] hallelujah praise be to God I believe
[1:09:26] that's how he brings his members is acts
[1:09:28] the second chapter somebody said well
[1:09:29] brother Wayne Mary just believe the word
[1:09:32] be it unto me according to Thy word I
[1:09:34] mean and that's the scripture but that's
[1:09:36] not her
[1:09:38] Birth come on do I've seen I've seen
[1:09:41] doctors of divinities with their Baptist
[1:09:43] theology try to make it that that was
[1:09:45] Mary just just believe just according to
[1:09:48] the word that's way but that's not even
[1:09:49] what that's talking about come on when
[1:09:52] she got born again how many knows where
[1:09:54] she got her new birth brother BR said if
[1:09:56] God made Mary go in that upper room he
[1:09:59] said and get drunk in the spirit and
[1:10:01] talk in tongues he'll never let us in
[1:10:04] heaven without it amen don't you try to
[1:10:06] get into heaven without an acts 238
[1:10:09] experience with almighty God I believe
[1:10:11] it's going to take it church I believe
[1:10:13] you got to be born again by the baptism
[1:10:15] of the Holy Ghost in the power of God
[1:10:18] Mary believe that's right but it
[1:10:20] requires contact with God it requires an
[1:10:23] encounter with God I believe it I
[1:10:26] believe we got some man-made bars in the
[1:10:28] last days like that brother B saw that
[1:10:30] eagle in that cage he said I'd give
[1:10:32] every dollar I got to get her out there
[1:10:35] and I'll tell you this I believe he was
[1:10:36] seeing more than an old Eagle in the
[1:10:38] cage I think he was looking at children
[1:10:41] of God Eagles that were in the cages of
[1:10:43] man and their misunderstanding and the
[1:10:46] barring in of the church God never made
[1:10:48] you an eagle to be barred in to the
[1:10:51] understanding of man he made you to fly
[1:10:54] he made you to get up there in the sky
[1:10:56] and feel the power of God that's where
[1:10:59] you get your meat when you get up high
[1:11:02] that's where you can see that Revelation
[1:11:04] come on that Hulk gets blind and lazy
[1:11:07] but the eagle Can Fly Fast and Swift and
[1:11:09] he can catch the revelation of his age
[1:11:12] and feed on the modern events made clear
[1:11:15] by prophecy which gives him strength and
[1:11:17] vision amen I I know y' hey brother
[1:11:20] Wayne what's wrong with you amen I tell
[1:11:22] you this I I I I just I I've come to a
[1:11:25] place where I realize that some of the
[1:11:27] churches are getting a bit like they are
[1:11:29] down in Florida you know those those
[1:11:31] mature
[1:11:32] communities but they got signs where
[1:11:35] they say mature communities you know in
[1:11:37] other words don't you bring in a bunch
[1:11:39] of Bratz over here in my swimming
[1:11:41] pool they got they got the condos but
[1:11:44] you can't get one of them Jared you got
[1:11:46] too many young on running around there
[1:11:48] they want a mature Community where there
[1:11:50] ain't no dancing no shouting no running
[1:11:53] amen but I tell you why amen I believe
[1:11:55] believe God's still bringing youngers I
[1:11:57] believe he's still bringing children of
[1:11:59] God in this age and I pray that the
[1:12:01] bursts keep happening that the power of
[1:12:04] God keeps moving in the church I
[1:12:07] experience and the power of
[1:12:11] God man I'm not interested in your
[1:12:13] material communities I want where the
[1:12:14] life of God is bringing birth all the
[1:12:17] time I know I got five grandkids
[1:12:21] now I got one Lord just miraculously
[1:12:24] gave it all of them Miracles but the
[1:12:26] Lord just miraculously gave Eevee to us
[1:12:28] and she tells us now and again Papa me a
[1:12:34] miracle mom made her set in the corner
[1:12:36] and she said me a miracle mama she said
[1:12:38] but you're still in
[1:12:39] trouble so just cuz you're a miracle
[1:12:41] don't mean you can't get a little
[1:12:46] correction yeah that's
[1:12:48] right she told me the other day she got
[1:12:50] this little cousin he's about four he
[1:12:52] might be five but now they call him Coco
[1:12:54] and he says Pao she said Coco don't

[1:13:05] to get up and and walk across our floor
[1:13:08] about middle of the day and they'd be a
[1:13:09] toy here and a toy there and a toy here
[1:13:12] you know what that is don't you that's a
[1:13:14] sign of life around the
[1:13:16] house that's a sign of Miracles that
[1:13:18] have have been manifested in our midst
[1:13:21] sure amen they're infant now but they're
[1:13:23] growing they're growing amen and I I I
[1:13:26] tell you what see as long as you're
[1:13:28] getting in the spirit of God there's
[1:13:30] going to be manifestations of that
[1:13:32] Spirit happening all around you I like
[1:13:34] how brother random says it he says in
[1:13:35] Pat's Vision he said oh John was in the
[1:13:38] spirit on the Lord's day he said that's
[1:13:40] right now remember he says the first
[1:13:43] thing you have to do is get in the
[1:13:44] spirit amen that's right the first thing
[1:13:47] you have to do is get in the spirit he
[1:13:48] said now can you imagine somebody going
[1:13:50] down to a dance he said you start
[1:13:52] dancing Clapping Your Hands patting your
[1:13:54] feet down this Shin dig and throwing
[1:13:55] your hat on the floor and going around
[1:13:57] and around acting silly and you was in
[1:13:58] the spirit of can you imagine a fella
[1:14:00] sitting over there and he said well I
[1:14:03] guess it's a pretty good
[1:14:06] time he said oh you a
[1:14:09] Wallflower he meant then he changes he
[1:14:12] said go down that ball game he said
[1:14:13] somebody knocks a home run he said see
[1:14:16] him look over there he said well I guess
[1:14:18] that's pretty good y'all heard brother
[1:14:20] Ram say it on tape but you well I guess
[1:14:22] that's pretty good he said you ain't no
[1:14:24] baseball
[1:14:26] F he said then we come down to the
[1:14:28] church you get in the spirit raise up
[1:14:30] holler Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:14:33] somebody turn around and say Holy
[1:14:35] Roller Amen brother BR said I'd rather
[1:14:37] be a Holy Roller as an Unholy
[1:14:41] roller amen I'd rather be a Holy Roller
[1:14:43] as an Unholy
[1:14:44] roller see he was in the spirit and
[1:14:47] brother man said it's when you get in
[1:14:48] the spirit things begin to take place
[1:14:50] that's when it is and then somebody said
[1:14:52] to me here while back said I think when
[1:14:54] John got in the spirit spirit and and
[1:14:55] they was explaining what they thought
[1:14:57] and it was funny cuz the next day I was
[1:14:58] reading what brother BR said he said oh
[1:15:00] John was up there he said dancing and a
[1:15:03] jumping and a running all around that
[1:15:05] Island he went he was having a good old
[1:15:07] time he was in the spirit he said now
[1:15:10] that may sound sacrilegious and I don't
[1:15:12] mean it to he says but listen well
[1:15:14] that's what he might have been doing I
[1:15:16] believe he was having a good time in the
[1:15:18] spirit praising God because that's
[1:15:21] exactly what happened when the spirit
[1:15:23] fell the first time and when the Holy
[1:15:25] Ghost fell on them they staggered like
[1:15:27] drunk men and women and acted like they
[1:15:29] were drunk and jaborn and carrying on
[1:15:31] these people are full of new wine that's
[1:15:34] the way they acted the first time so the
[1:15:36] spirit of God comes on them again he
[1:15:39] probably acted that same way there's
[1:15:41] nothing new about this friends this is
[1:15:44] an oldtime religion if you don't think
[1:15:47] it's old go back to the Book of Job it
[1:15:49] said before the foundations of the world
[1:15:52] had job saw the sons and daughters uh
[1:15:55] the sons of God shouting with joy that's
[1:15:58] right amen amen I I know I I don't want
[1:16:01] to just stay here but I want to just
[1:16:02] show you a couple of these quotes as I'm
[1:16:03] moving now watch's the prophet of God
[1:16:05] talk about this he talks about dancing
[1:16:08] in the spirit I always thought it was
[1:16:09] amazing because he talks about
[1:16:10] Jehosaphat and he talks about out there
[1:16:12] when Jehoshaphat was out there with Ahab
[1:16:14] remember and they they kind of got out
[1:16:16] there in that trouble and and they
[1:16:17] wanted to get out of the desert they
[1:16:19] want to get out of the trouble and
[1:16:20] somebody said go get Elijah he poured
[1:16:22] the hand water on the hands of Elijah
[1:16:24] and brother said when Elisha got up
[1:16:26] there he was upset and he said if it
[1:16:28] wasn't for this man of God I wouldn't
[1:16:30] even talk to you people that's right and
[1:16:32] he he said all of a sudden they said
[1:16:33] bring a Minstrel and they got over there
[1:16:36] and he said they got to play in that
[1:16:37] Minstrel he said the next thing you know
[1:16:39] he said the prophet got in the spirit he
[1:16:41] said oh there it is they begin to play
[1:16:44] that music he said Oh my he said if it
[1:16:47] you you can't be the prophet be said but
[1:16:49] maybe you didn't play the instrument you
[1:16:51] know they play that music and begin to
[1:16:53] bring the spirit down on that Prophet
[1:16:55] they begin to play the tambourine and
[1:16:57] beat the drums and oh my okay they me to
[1:17:00] beat the drums and play the instruments
[1:17:02] and all them begin to beat and play had
[1:17:04] great old songs playing he said they
[1:17:06] were singing going to be a meeting in
[1:17:09] the air in that sweet sweet by and by my
[1:17:13] brother randam sure like that one didn't
[1:17:14] he he said oh the prophet began to get
[1:17:17] in the spirit the face thinging you know
[1:17:19] he be to happen he said that's what's a
[1:17:21] matter we can't get any words cuz we
[1:17:23] don't want get in the spirit of it
[1:17:26] he watch what he says the spirit got on
[1:17:28] that prophet he begin to see things see
[1:17:30] you begin to see things when you get in
[1:17:32] the spirit when you get in the spirit
[1:17:34] all you might dance a little oh you
[1:17:36] might shout a little but the most
[1:17:38] important part of that is you get
[1:17:40] outside of your Pride and Prejudice and
[1:17:43] your carnal realm where you can see
[1:17:45] Revelation and you can see the things of
[1:17:48] God oh I tell you this amen I wonder why
[1:17:51] brother Bram knew what got Elisha in a
[1:17:53] good mood I wonder how he knew that
[1:17:55] except Spirit Elijah was on him and he
[1:17:57] was sitting in a meeting one day and
[1:17:59] they got to singing there's going to be
[1:18:01] a meeting in the air and he said an old
[1:18:03] girl got to play it on the tambourine
[1:18:04] other one I think they was beating a pan
[1:18:06] he said they got to dancing in my church
[1:18:08] he said no church manners at all he was
[1:18:11] a Baptist preacher before he started
[1:18:13] walking in the open or the fullness of
[1:18:15] the word sure he was amen and to him
[1:18:18] that was just off of hand what's a
[1:18:20] matter no training at all to do that in
[1:18:22] a church amen but it was more than a
[1:18:24] Baptist preacher he was a prophet and he
[1:18:26] said he be to think about dancing in the
[1:18:29] Bible and begin to run it in the
[1:18:31] scripture and found out it meant Victory
[1:18:34] amen and then all of a sudden a prophet
[1:18:36] cleared dancing by the word and the next
[1:18:39] thing you know he was out there dancing
[1:18:41] with him amen and that Prophet was
[1:18:43] dancing to the same song He said Elisha
[1:18:46] was enjoying out there on the mountain
[1:18:49] now what are we talking about we're
[1:18:50] talking about getting in the spirit
[1:18:52] because man is a spirit do you know that
[1:18:56] man is a spirit and God is a spirit and
[1:18:59] he makes the spirit of man now you were
[1:19:02] created in God's image so when you get
[1:19:04] in the spirit you're getting into a
[1:19:06] realm of the
[1:19:08] unlimited I know I know for a fact I've
[1:19:11] seen it I've seen the Holy Ghost move
[1:19:13] down in assemblies and I've seen him
[1:19:15] move powerful upon them hearts and lives
[1:19:18] amen I've seen people walk in the church
[1:19:20] one thing and leave another I've seen
[1:19:22] them packing in spirits of unclean
[1:19:24] things and when the anointing begins to
[1:19:26] move it breaks the Yoke off of them and
[1:19:29] they leave free and full of the Holy
[1:19:31] Ghost listen if it works for them then
[1:19:34] it'll work for us tonight the anointing
[1:19:37] still breaks the yoke upon the children
[1:19:40] of God you know what I'm telling you is
[1:19:41] the truth you've crawled into church and
[1:19:44] shouted your way back out the back door
[1:19:46] you have come into church and thought I
[1:19:48] don't know if I'm going to make it in
[1:19:50] the back door but when the preaching
[1:19:52] began and the spirit began to move the
[1:19:55] Holy Ghost Begin to
[1:19:57] Fall my goodness you said what's going
[1:20:00] on brother B said it's the casting out
[1:20:02] of demons what's going on the anointing
[1:20:05] the ministry is backing those spirits up
[1:20:08] so you can get into the presence of
[1:20:12] God in the spirit you are
[1:20:18] unlimited listen as long as you stay in
[1:20:20] this realm of dirt you ain't nothing but
[1:20:23] dirt but if you get into the realm of
[1:20:26] the spirit you are an unlimited vessel
[1:20:29] you can do anything there is nothing
[1:20:31] that's not possible with the Church of
[1:20:33] the Living God that stops off into the
[1:20:36] spirit realm amen I believe that I
[1:20:39] believe Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:20:40] born to the spirit of God and God is a
[1:20:44] spirit sir he said brother Wayne I got
[1:20:46] the Holy Ghost what's that make me
[1:20:47] brother bam said the baptism of the holy
[1:20:49] spirit is to be made deity itself
[1:20:52] himself amen he said now that didn't set
[1:20:55] very good he said but a man or woman
[1:20:57] that's born to the spirit of God has got
[1:20:59] a part of God and you're Sons and
[1:21:01] Daughters of God and Jesus said it was
[1:21:03] written in the scripture that you are
[1:21:06] Gods John chap 10:34 I'll read it for
[1:21:09] you Jesus answered and said is it not
[1:21:11] written I said ye are Gods that's right
[1:21:14] and if he called them Gods unto whom the
[1:21:17] word of God came to the scripture cannot
[1:21:20] be broken oh brother Wayne but that was
[1:21:22] for way back there I love how the
[1:21:23] prophet says it Jesus is saying 1957 he
[1:21:26] said see read John 10 down to the 30th
[1:21:29] verse and I want you to listen close to
[1:21:31] the reading and then apply that reading
[1:21:35] to right now this very hour then you'll
[1:21:39] be straight on the word if you leave
[1:21:42] that back there you're missing the word
[1:21:44] but if you bring that up here then
[1:21:46] you're going to be straight on the word
[1:21:48] of course he's quoting Psalms 82 I have
[1:21:50] said ye are gods and all of you are the
[1:21:53] children of the most high that's right
[1:21:56] see testimony of a true witness oh God
[1:21:59] what is it it's the Holy Ghost see the
[1:22:02] true witness of God what is it it is
[1:22:04] deity tabernacled in man
[1:22:08] Hallelujah preacher what are you talking
[1:22:10] about let's continue on it's God living
[1:22:13] in a man deity God himself tabernacled
[1:22:17] into the person when he can speak and
[1:22:20] it's the same as God speaking that's the
[1:22:22] Church of Jesus Christ that's that's the
[1:22:24] way the Apostolic Church went out at the
[1:22:26] first what did they hear as my father
[1:22:29] sent me so send I you what happened when
[1:22:32] they went the father went in them and
[1:22:34] when God sent you to this earth he came
[1:22:37] in you he didn't just send you by
[1:22:40] yourself but it is rich in a little
[1:22:42] while and the world seeth me no more but
[1:22:44] you shall see me I will be with you even
[1:22:47] in You Until the End of the Age then the
[1:22:50] very creator of Heaven and Earth is in
[1:22:53] this building tonight in the form of
[1:22:57] Sons and Daughters of
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:02] God oh it's so easy to believe that
[1:23:05] about Paul Peter James John it's so easy
[1:23:08] to glorify their lives and to make them
[1:23:11] Angelic and sinless and no Faults and no
[1:23:14] mistakes that's the devil dealing with
[1:23:16] your mind to make you think that way
[1:23:19] about them saints of old they were made
[1:23:21] out of the dirt just like you're made
[1:23:23] out of dirt
[1:23:27] let me ask y'all something is dirt dirt
[1:23:29] or is dirt
[1:23:31] dirt come on y'all he
[1:23:34] billies dirt is dirt I don't care if
[1:23:38] it's Texas dirt Louisiana Dirt Ohio dirt
[1:23:43] Canada dirt African dirt dirt is dirt
[1:23:47] and whether we want to acknowledge it or
[1:23:48] not Peter was
[1:23:50] dirt and Paul was dirt and James was
[1:23:58] dirt Jesus was
[1:24:02] dirt oh I know that tears that
[1:24:04] Pentecostal up don't
[1:24:06] it I you know people people don't even
[1:24:09] think Jesus could have had a
[1:24:13] family they really don't they don't even
[1:24:15] think he ever had any struggles of of
[1:24:18] Temptations or burning passions or no
[1:24:21] they they don't think he had any of that
[1:24:23] but my Bible said he come lower than the
[1:24:25] angels and took upon himself the Seed of
[1:24:28] Abraham that he might feel the
[1:24:30] Temptation and be tempted in every light
[1:24:33] manner that you're tempted I know he was
[1:24:35] a Son of God but he was put into Mary to
[1:24:39] have a dirt
[1:24:42] body you know where he got his body out
[1:24:44] of the calcium and the potach and out of
[1:24:46] the vegetables she ate and out of the
[1:24:49] food she took in her body formed a dirt
[1:24:51] body but in that dirt body was a created
[1:24:55] Son of God
[1:24:59] hallelujah I know I know but it was dirt
[1:25:03] then and it's dirt now but for some
[1:25:05] reason you think if it's old dirt it's
[1:25:07] better
[1:25:09] dirt still
[1:25:12] dirt They Carried the word across dirt a
[1:25:14] lot of times you remember David when he
[1:25:16] took the when he took the ark one of
[1:25:18] brother bram's sermons he talks about
[1:25:20] the Victory and David dancing before the
[1:25:22] Ark of the Lord y'all know what they
[1:25:24] done to carry that word over that dirt
[1:25:26] they killed oxen ever six steps they
[1:25:29] wouldn't take six steps without killing
[1:25:31] something amen because the blood was
[1:25:33] coming on the ground I thought we get
[1:25:35] bent and and I love worshiping dancing
[1:25:37] and I worship and shouting but that was
[1:25:40] also worship and killing and sometimes
[1:25:43] you got to kill something before you can
[1:25:45] feel the Liberty to dance a little bit
[1:25:47] and David was killing stuff and he was
[1:25:49] worshiping God but blood was getting on
[1:25:52] the ground I tell you today we need the
[1:25:56] blood we need the blood on this dirt
[1:25:58] that we might have Liberty and victory
[1:26:01] to serve God like we've never served God
[1:26:04] before you know where that word was
[1:26:06] going it was going to the Tabernacle
[1:26:08] that Tabernacle was a tent it was just a
[1:26:11] tent but it was a three-phase which
[1:26:12] represented a human
[1:26:15] body and showed you the ox and blood was
[1:26:17] only the blood of Jesus that would
[1:26:19] sanctify this dirt that would that would
[1:26:22] sanctify the process that the Ark of the
[1:26:24] Covenant would be moved from the
[1:26:26] Tabernacles of levitical law into the
[1:26:29] heart of man so that we would house
[1:26:33] God in
[1:26:36] dirt dirty
[1:26:41] dirt now folks I read this message all
[1:26:44] the time and I heard brother bam say I'd
[1:26:46] like to go in and pray for this little
[1:26:48] boy he said I was waiting for a
[1:26:50] vision brother B said the angel of the
[1:26:52] Lord pulled me back and said he's wait
[1:26:54] and see what you're going to do that's
[1:26:55] right and brother B said see when I go
[1:26:58] in to pray for that child the same dirty
[1:27:00] hands
[1:27:01] that's the same dirty hands will lay on
[1:27:04] that child whether I have a vision or I
[1:27:06] just do it by the
[1:27:08] word do you see hey man let me just say
[1:27:11] it real clearly there is nothing
[1:27:13] impossible with God but God said there's
[1:27:16] nothing impossible with you that believe
[1:27:19] not with God but with you because deity
[1:27:21] is in man the very God that stood back
[1:27:23] here on a mystical platform of the
[1:27:25] eternities rolled the words off of his
[1:27:27] hands and created these things give you
[1:27:29] the privilege to be sons and you're a
[1:27:32] part of him and God dwells in mankind
[1:27:35] and man himself is deity Hallelujah
[1:27:40] there you are might choke you a little
[1:27:42] but study it a while Hallelujah God is
[1:27:45] in the dirt God picked up the dust and
[1:27:49] put his own spirit in
[1:27:51] it let me tell you something about God
[1:27:53] he's a mighty conquerer and it don't
[1:27:54] matter what he's in he's still God God
[1:27:57] is not the kind of thing that you can
[1:27:59] put him in something and it can tame him
[1:28:01] down or weaken him I know I know there
[1:28:04] might be certain products you know come
[1:28:06] on you might you might put something in
[1:28:08] a certain bag and cover the sin or take
[1:28:10] away or weaken down but you can put God
[1:28:13] in anything and he remains to be the
[1:28:15] same
[1:28:18] God you can't weaken him or take his
[1:28:22] power God dwells in mankind that's
[1:28:26] right that great wonderful church will
[1:28:29] go forth with power and deity because
[1:28:32] deity will be
[1:28:34] revealed in human
[1:28:36] beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to
[1:28:40] pass yes sir the thought of your mind
[1:28:43] can you imagine that the sons of God in
[1:28:46] the last day was so take on the mind of
[1:28:50] Christ that when they're meditating God
[1:28:53] will bring to pass the very thing
[1:28:55] they're thinking
[1:28:56] about oh I know it sounds impossible but
[1:28:59] With God all things are possible that's
[1:29:02] what he told Mary wasn't it With God all
[1:29:04] things are possible you know what that
[1:29:06] really means not has never spoke a word
[1:29:08] he don't have the power to
[1:29:10] perform whatever he spoke he has the
[1:29:13] power to manifest that word deity see
[1:29:17] it's speaking perg Church age brother
[1:29:18] says the word comes into you he said if
[1:29:21] that Holy Spirit is in there and it's
[1:29:23] alive as soon as it comes in the very
[1:29:25] promise is true nothing therefore if you
[1:29:26] say to the mountain you know the
[1:29:28] scripture if you say to the mountain
[1:29:29] don't doubt in your heart because what
[1:29:31] you are are is deity speaking now you
[1:29:34] believe that because the Bible said so
[1:29:36] whatever you said shall come to pass if
[1:29:38] you'll not doubt it see if you can get
[1:29:42] all the world breed out of
[1:29:45] you amen if you get all the hbri out of
[1:29:49] you get all of that bread out of you he
[1:29:52] said then let that Holy Spirit make you
[1:29:54] a full son or daughter of God no world
[1:29:57] no condemnation no doubt what is it it's
[1:30:00] more than you then it's God in you then
[1:30:03] you take this word it's a promise and
[1:30:04] say father it's your promise Satan's got
[1:30:07] to move it's got to move because it's
[1:30:10] children of God now I know I know in
[1:30:13] this last day there's all kinds of uh
[1:30:15] falsehoods around this uh the speaking
[1:30:17] the word cuz they're going to name it
[1:30:19] and claim it you get all kinds of of
[1:30:21] jealousy and and and self motivation and
[1:30:24] you know it it it it it gets more clear
[1:30:27] all the time amen that power without
[1:30:30] character is certainly
[1:30:32] demonic but Power with character is fit
[1:30:35] to rule is that right that's why God was
[1:30:38] working on your character but working on
[1:30:41] your character don't forget who you
[1:30:44] are he deals with us as
[1:30:46] Sons that's right people people forget
[1:30:49] these scriptures and I and I recognize
[1:30:51] John 14:12 there was a whole group one
[1:30:54] time that made that he that believeth
[1:30:56] and the works that I do shall great they
[1:30:57] said he is brother Bram they he that
[1:30:59] believeth they just make it one and they
[1:31:01] make it brother brandom well there's a
[1:31:03] lot of scripture says he that believeth
[1:31:05] starts in John 5:24 he that believeth on
[1:31:08] me amen you you see you can't just start
[1:31:10] identifying that it's just belonging to
[1:31:13] one man but unto all of the children of
[1:31:15] Abraham are these promises made we are
[1:31:18] joint air with Christ in every one of
[1:31:20] these so then somebody says to me and
[1:31:23] it's a it's it's a valid question
[1:31:24] brother Wayne will everybody speak
[1:31:26] swirls will everybody speak like this
[1:31:28] listen let me say this it would be
[1:31:30] carnal impersonation on your behalf to
[1:31:32] try to impersonate a
[1:31:35] prophet but there is a potential with
[1:31:38] inside of you that if a man had a need
[1:31:42] the devil said if you be the Son of God
[1:31:43] cast yourself down make these stones
[1:31:45] into bread if you're hungry remember
[1:31:46] that amen but Jesus never said he
[1:31:50] couldn't that's right and later he fed
[1:31:53] 5,000
[1:31:56] I wonder if the devil was watching that
[1:32:00] day you see in John brother bam says it
[1:32:04] like this and I love the sermon in
[1:32:05] spiritual Amnesia he ties together Mark
[1:32:08] 11 and John 1412 and he said can you be
[1:32:12] identified there to believe that's the
[1:32:14] truth if it hasn't then you're getting
[1:32:17] spiritual
[1:32:18] Amnesia and you have forgot see you lose
[1:32:21] your Christian balance you can't tell
[1:32:24] where you're belong you said well I'm a
[1:32:26] Methodist or I'm Baptist he said see
[1:32:28] he's that's what I know about it I'm a
[1:32:30] Pentecostal see watch out that means
[1:32:33] that that disease sign is showing on you
[1:32:36] you got spiritual
[1:32:39] Amnesia as a Believer you have a right
[1:32:42] to those scriptures if you can just
[1:32:44] remember you're a Son of God how many
[1:32:46] was here last night wasn't that powerful
[1:32:48] amen after you remember that God deals
[1:32:51] with you as a child as a son then you
[1:32:53] can strengthen your knees and lift up
[1:32:55] your hands I believe you ought to
[1:32:57] remember who you are you ought to
[1:32:59] remember the sons of God as a right to
[1:33:02] speak the word of God you ought to
[1:33:04] remember you have a right to have
[1:33:06] dominion over the devil you ought to
[1:33:08] remember your right as a son or daughter
[1:33:10] of God I believe you ought to remember
[1:33:12] your rights that's right remember your
[1:33:14] rights and I think sometimes you need to
[1:33:17] remember your
[1:33:18] past the right
[1:33:21] way cuz I know Satan's always trying to
[1:33:23] remember a past but the past he wants
[1:33:26] you to remember is one that destroys you
[1:33:29] why is that as far back as Satan's
[1:33:30] memory goes seems like he can't get back
[1:33:33] to Calvary seems like his memory's not
[1:33:36] long enough he's got shortterm memory he
[1:33:39] wants to talk to you about 30 years or
[1:33:41] 40 years ago but I'd like to talk to him
[1:33:43] about 2,000 years ago Satan if you like
[1:33:46] a debate come on up and we'll talk a
[1:33:49] little we'll talk a little devil gets on
[1:33:51] you wants to come to church with you I
[1:33:53] tell you what you ought to do sometimes
[1:33:55] you ought to shout that devil off you
[1:33:57] ought to dance you ought to say devil if
[1:34:00] you're going to stay on me hang on cuz
[1:34:02] we're going to Worship the Lord a little
[1:34:04] while and that devil will get off of you
[1:34:07] pretty
[1:34:11] quick that's right you ought to remember
[1:34:14] amen I know I know this one thing I you
[1:34:17] and the devil say well you wasn't there
[1:34:19] and I wasn't there before the foundation
[1:34:20] of the world either in my memory but in
[1:34:23] God's memory I was there because he said
[1:34:26] I always was a son right come on Church
[1:34:30] said well you can't say that if you
[1:34:31] can't remember that how many of y'all
[1:34:32] remember the day you're born now how
[1:34:35] many of y'all remember you were 6B and
[1:34:36] 12 O on May the 12th of 1942 or amen you
[1:34:40] come on no but nobody remembers the
[1:34:42] moment of their birth sir but your mama
[1:34:46] told you about it and you traded your
[1:34:48] memory for her memory and you tell it
[1:34:51] like it's the truth
[1:34:54] but you don't no more remember that than
[1:34:56] nothing but you take it for the truth
[1:34:59] and it becomes your memory but I tell
[1:35:01] you this word is my memory I'm
[1:35:03] remembered the way God said it was and
[1:35:07] the beautiful thing is it's not just a
[1:35:09] memory of my past I'm going to remember
[1:35:11] my future I'm going to remember there's
[1:35:13] a millennium coming I'm going to
[1:35:15] remember there's a future home coming
[1:35:18] and the best of all Jared I'm going to
[1:35:19] remember as a day we're going to throw
[1:35:21] that devil in the Lake of Fire and he's
[1:35:24] never going to harm another son or
[1:35:27] another daughter
[1:35:29] again Hallelujah I'm going to be first
[1:35:32] brother Donnie I'm going to stand first
[1:35:34] in line to kill that old nervous devil
[1:35:36] that old anxiety devil I'm going to kick
[1:35:38] that thing right off in the fire and
[1:35:40] maybe do a little dig amen and say to
[1:35:43] him devil amen we fought a long time but
[1:35:47] I knew your day was
[1:35:52] coming sometimes you got to remember
[1:35:54] your future said well how do you
[1:35:56] remember your future you trade your
[1:35:57] memory for his memory because the same
[1:36:00] God that knew what was what is also
[1:36:02] knows what's going to
[1:36:04] be yes sir I remember my future yes sir
[1:36:09] now beloved we are the sons of God it
[1:36:10] don't yet appear what we shall be but we
[1:36:12] know that when he shall appear we shall
[1:36:14] be like
[1:36:16] him but we shall see
[1:36:18] him as he is
[1:36:23] that's right now y'all all know that of
[1:36:27] course is talking of the change of the
[1:36:28] body and the offering glorified
[1:36:31] body but it also speaks with the
[1:36:34] appearing of the Lord in this
[1:36:36] age to manifest what a true son should
[1:36:40] be amen what is it it's Christ would
[1:36:43] manifest to destroy the works of the
[1:36:47] devil we are now Sons and Daughters of
[1:36:49] God not off in the future no not
[1:36:53] sometime in the future we set in
[1:36:55] Heavenly places right now we're right
[1:36:58] now sons and let me tell you this the
[1:37:00] only argument you got about that is
[1:37:02] you're trying to think about angels
[1:37:04] on that's right and some preachers have
[1:37:06] got right on board with the devil and
[1:37:08] they're trying to tell everybody you
[1:37:10] can't be a son till you're an angel well
[1:37:11] let me give you good news you're never
[1:37:13] going to be an angel even when you have
[1:37:16] a glorified body you're not going to be
[1:37:18] an angel but why would you want to be an
[1:37:20] angel when you're a Son of God Amen
[1:37:23] listen an angel can't even go in the
[1:37:25] presence of God without covering their
[1:37:27] face but you and I even as a sinner can
[1:37:30] come under the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:37:33] walk boldly into the throne of grace in
[1:37:37] the time of

[1:38:05] trial no you're talking about angels but
[1:38:08] as a Son of God Amen here's a prophet
[1:38:11] telling us he went through depression he
[1:38:14] went through Temptations He went through
[1:38:16] struggles he went through trials because
[1:38:20] he was just dirt

[1:38:30] right now you're in a terrestrial body
[1:38:32] and if you look it up Paul called it a
[1:38:34] body of
[1:38:37] humiliation this is where you're being
[1:38:44] humiliated listen you young guys don't

[1:39:02] clear the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:39:05] righteous man availeth
[1:39:07] much the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:39:09] righteous man brother B said a righteous
[1:39:11] man is a man who confesses his sins
[1:39:13] that's a righteous one not
[1:39:17] sinless yes
[1:39:20] sir way what are you talking about but
[1:39:22] the time we get done if you really
[1:39:24] personally knew brother brandom you
[1:39:26] might not let him be a
[1:39:30] son hey can can we just get it out there
[1:39:33] we have so glorified brother Ram's error
[1:39:36] that you probably don't even think there
[1:39:37] was one sick person in his
[1:39:42] church I'm not rebuking
[1:39:44] you I'm opening up a door to let you
[1:39:47] understand something have you ever
[1:39:48] thought that the man who had a Divine
[1:39:51] Divine Healing Miracle gift yeah sent
[1:39:54] into the age to restore Divine Healing
[1:39:55] had sick people in his church and don't
[1:39:58] you think the devil run around saying it
[1:39:59] ain't true because that person's sick or
[1:40:01] this certain happened or that person
[1:40:03] died amen when I F here and read the
[1:40:05] prophet of God and he said it ain't
[1:40:07] perfect till it gets in weakness
[1:40:09] strength ain't perfect till it becomes
[1:40:10] weak and then when it becomes weak and
[1:40:12] then then you can see the strength in it
[1:40:14] that was a girl sit in brother Ram's
[1:40:16] meetings for years in a wheelchair and
[1:40:18] brother B said there she sits as happy
[1:40:19] as she could be because she found her
[1:40:22] place and brother said oh she's just as
[1:40:24] happy as she could be amen but she was
[1:40:26] in the prophet's
[1:40:29] meetings there is more scriptures in
[1:40:32] this Bible than when somebody got
[1:40:36] healed I know you like to read about
[1:40:38] Paul shaking the Viper off in the SN in
[1:40:41] the fire I do too but how about his
[1:40:43] swimming lesson from the boat over to
[1:40:45] the bank he's out there swimming with
[1:40:48] the rest of them he's just
[1:40:51] dirt he said who shall deliver me from
[1:40:54] this body of sin oh I don't find
[1:40:57] anything that can do it but one day he
[1:40:59] said oh there's a law that is working
[1:41:02] it's a law of death but I find another
[1:41:04] law it is the law of
[1:41:07] life I know y'all know the law of life
[1:41:09] amen that's why he says it very clearly
[1:41:12] not
[1:41:13] Angelic come on
[1:41:16] dirt I say unto you I say unto you now I
[1:41:22] I would love to have have the same
[1:41:24] emphasis that Jesus
[1:41:27] had when he said to them I say unto
[1:41:31] you can you imagine our lord Jesus
[1:41:35] standing next to that tree that had just
[1:41:36] withered in 24 hours and then turn and
[1:41:39] say I say unto you if you just had the
[1:41:42] faith of God you could speak under this
[1:41:44] mountain and it would be moved and and
[1:41:46] and and a world of unbelievers have said
[1:41:48] oh it's a mountain of sin brother BR
[1:41:50] said no it wasn't he said he was
[1:41:52] pointing at the mountain of of Olives
[1:41:54] amen and and because that somebody amen
[1:41:57] has come up to that mountain and didn't
[1:41:59] feel like it moved brother random helped
[1:42:01] you he said listen if you do that with
[1:42:03] Earnest heart and it's coming from
[1:42:04] inspiration it's nothing more than de he
[1:42:06] speaking and he said a sand has been
[1:42:09] removed from that mountain the very
[1:42:11] moment you spoke
[1:42:13] it I know that's Faith amen and then
[1:42:16] there's God giving a commanding faith
[1:42:19] that comes into the church I'm speaking
[1:42:21] to you church not somebody El tonight I
[1:42:24] say unto you if you say unto this
[1:42:26] mountain I know your dirt God knows your
[1:42:29] dirt he even said it he knows your
[1:42:34] flesh I say unto you little Gods Gods I
[1:42:38] being the one God without sin proved it
[1:42:41] peace be still in the tree no man can
[1:42:44] eat from it verily I say unto you you
[1:42:46] little Gods if you'll say to this
[1:42:48] mountain and be moved and don't doubt in
[1:42:50] your heart you can have what you will
[1:42:53] will say will come to pass you can have
[1:42:56] what you've said Mark 11:24 is the
[1:42:59] scripture now what is it we're living in
[1:43:02] the age of adoption adoption part four
[1:43:05] brother B will say it very clearly going
[1:43:07] back to Genesis to the original what is
[1:43:09] it the world and nature is groaning and
[1:43:11] crying everything moving up for what for
[1:43:14] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:43:17] when true Sons born Sons filled Sons
[1:43:21] amen speak the word of God and it's
[1:43:23] backed I believe we're on the borderline
[1:43:25] of it tonight if you say under this
[1:43:27] mountain Romans the 8th chapter said the
[1:43:29] whole creation
[1:43:31] granth and travaileth until the
[1:43:34] manifestations of
[1:43:37] sons I'll tell you this is the day of
[1:43:39] the manifestation of sons when the
[1:43:41] Mysteries that's been hid from the
[1:43:43] foundation of the world is to be made
[1:43:44] known this is the hour this is the hour
[1:43:49] when sons are revealed amen it takes
[1:43:51] election for God to bring you now I know
[1:43:55] Satan would like to diminish election
[1:43:57] amen and and just set it aside you know
[1:43:59] it's just like believing this message
[1:44:01] when you when you believe this message I
[1:44:03] I know what Satan tries to lay evidences
[1:44:06] and he tries to lay evidences and he
[1:44:08] tries to put them here and put them over
[1:44:09] there and somewhere else because he's
[1:44:11] always deflecting what the real true
[1:44:14] evidence of the spirit of God is and and
[1:44:16] let me just make a a a quick answer we
[1:44:18] can read it later if you need it but
[1:44:20] let's just give the quick answer the
[1:44:21] true evidence of the spirit
[1:44:23] is that you believe the message of your
[1:44:28] day right that's the true evidence so so
[1:44:32] what Satan does is diminish the
[1:44:34] believing part and he tries to say
[1:44:37] things like well Heen everybody could
[1:44:40] believe that message see you're nothing
[1:44:41] special because you believe it but you
[1:44:44] are because you believe it now I let me
[1:44:47] just say something very clearly brother
[1:44:49] bandam says it like this amen he tells
[1:44:51] us that when Peter was standing they're
[1:44:53] talking to the Lord Jesus and he said
[1:44:55] who do you say I am he said Thou Art the
[1:44:56] son the living of God he said there it
[1:44:59] is Peter's name he said light stried
[1:45:02] across it and showed his name was on the
[1:45:04] Lamb's Book of Life this message that
[1:45:07] you are studying looking at reading
[1:45:09] listening to amen there have been many
[1:45:11] mo men that have longed to see what you
[1:45:14] are seen and have not saw it there's
[1:45:16] Kings and Priests and Prophets that have
[1:45:19] longed to see but you see it
[1:45:23] now why do you see it because there is
[1:45:26] something hidden in your
[1:45:30] dirt that's right something in your dirt
[1:45:33] made you believe now some of you guys in
[1:45:35] here are farmers and and the one thing
[1:45:37] about one thing about uh the spring in
[1:45:39] Arkansas I do like it is that you don't
[1:45:41] have snow on the ground in April you
[1:45:43] know they start planting these fields
[1:45:46] and next thing you know the sun pops up
[1:45:48] and starts moving over the field well I
[1:45:50] tell you what that sun covers every part
[1:45:53] particle of dirt out there in the field
[1:45:55] but why is it there there's one little
[1:45:58] piece of dirt out there that there's a
[1:46:00] little movement that happens when the
[1:46:02] Sun Passes over amen that Sun Shines on
[1:46:05] dirt Shines on rocks Shines on limbs
[1:46:08] amen but the place of dirt where there's
[1:46:11] a little seed hiding in there it makes
[1:46:14] it a different piece of dirt and you
[1:46:16] might just be dirt but on the inside of
[1:46:19] that dirt is a part of the Living God
[1:46:23] that is hi itself and when the son of
[1:46:26] this God begin to rise over this age
[1:46:29] something begin to awaken on the inside
[1:46:31] of you and it begin to move you what is
[1:46:36] it it's something in that
[1:46:39] dirt oh it's just dirt but there's weed
[1:46:42] in there oh it's just dirt but let me
[1:46:46] say it there's God in
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:50] there sir I I I tell you one thing I
[1:46:53] enjoy I enjoy the message of the
[1:46:56] hour in Romans the 5th chapter Paul said
[1:46:58] if you're justified by faith therefore
[1:47:00] you have peace with God how many knows
[1:47:02] that the Bible said that the Bible
[1:47:04] foreing the Heathen was saved by faith
[1:47:06] amen therefore the Heathen is saved by
[1:47:09] believing the
[1:47:10] gospel that's how the Gentiles get in
[1:47:13] the Covenant of God it's by faith in the
[1:47:15] word and it's written in Ephesians the
[1:47:17] second chapter by Grace you are saved
[1:47:19] and that is through
[1:47:21] faith so you got a whole world full of
[1:47:24] people out here amen that makes it like
[1:47:27] oh I believed it and I'm
[1:47:30] saved now let me just let me just say
[1:47:33] this the way I the way I see it
[1:47:36] sometimes people become arrogant because
[1:47:39] they can see the message now it's very
[1:47:43] important that God let you see it but
[1:47:45] pray to God that we never get arrogant
[1:47:48] in it because it wasn't you that saw
[1:47:51] it let me let me just say this you say I
[1:47:55] believed it well let me ask you this
[1:47:57] what in you believed
[1:48:00] it you got to go deeper than I believed
[1:48:03] it because there's the same that
[1:48:05] somebody said well I grew up in a
[1:48:06] message home that don't mean anything
[1:48:08] I've seen them go up in the message home
[1:48:09] and disbelieve it I've seen them goow up
[1:48:11] in the gutter and believe it go up in
[1:48:13] the gutter disbelieve it come out of
[1:48:14] mansions believe it disbelieve it
[1:48:16] Baptist Catholic every Walk of Life
[1:48:18] believe it disbelieve it because it's
[1:48:20] all dirt but the one that God laid a
[1:48:24] seed down on the inside there's
[1:48:26] something in them that believes it can I
[1:48:30] say very clearly you wasn't saved by
[1:48:32] your desire you were saved by the desire
[1:48:34] of God so before you could believe it
[1:48:37] God had Grace and let you believe the
[1:48:40] very thing that's going to save you oh
[1:48:43] it's Grace Grace nothing but the grace
[1:48:46] of God there ain't nothing you could do
[1:48:49] it was Grace that gave it to you that's
[1:48:51] why Jesus said man cometh unto me except
[1:48:54] my father first draw him that word draw
[1:48:58] does not mean that he woed you and by
[1:49:00] some great magic that's in you some
[1:49:03] great that you were better than somebody
[1:49:05] else you said God I'm going to come to
[1:49:08] you amen no no no no it's not that way
[1:49:11] at all that's the arm minist way of
[1:49:13] believing things you know what it really
[1:49:15] was the word draw actually means the
[1:49:17] word
[1:49:19] drag and no man come to me and unless I
[1:49:24] drag him you see that's what God done to
[1:49:27] you he drugg you he drugged you into the
[1:49:31] promises of God he drug you into the
[1:49:34] grace of God and after a while you begin
[1:49:37] to surrender because you was done
[1:49:40] getting
[1:49:41] [Applause]
[1:49:44] dragged I was preaching the home the
[1:49:46] other day talking to the church about
[1:49:47] fishing I know y'all's a fishing group
[1:49:50] amen but you know what brother Bram
[1:49:51] likeing third pole of fishing don't he
[1:49:54] and he said it was that third that would
[1:49:55] do it it would catch them and if you
[1:49:57] ever Hook by this message you're hooked
[1:49:59] by God and he has a reputation of being
[1:50:02] a fisherman he ain't never lost no
[1:50:05] fish he knows how to he knows how to get
[1:50:08] you yes sir he knows just how to get you
[1:50:10] we we fish for them big salmon up there
[1:50:12] sometimes in Cadillac and them things
[1:50:14] weigh sometimes 30 and 35 pounds and and
[1:50:17] there's a current in the river amen and
[1:50:19] you're fishing on a you that knows what
[1:50:21] 17 pound means it's a 17lb liter and
[1:50:24] they have a rule of how big a hook you
[1:50:26] can use just a little bitty hook on a
[1:50:28] fly with a 17 lb liter and a 35 lb
[1:50:32] salmon running with its head all it can
[1:50:34] run well me and Zach started fishing for
[1:50:36] them we we' hook up five or six we and
[1:50:39] we'd lose all of them but one and
[1:50:41] finally about second trip we made up
[1:50:43] there amen we we went up there and I
[1:50:46] said Zach it's something got to change
[1:50:47] here we got to we got to change takes us
[1:50:49] 45 minutes to hook one and five minutes
[1:50:51] to lose it
[1:50:53] we got to change something here so after
[1:50:55] a while we started hooking them and we
[1:50:57] got where we we would hook five and six
[1:50:59] and we'd catch five out of every six we
[1:51:01] got but what we did is we loosened our
[1:51:03] drag just a little bit and we quit
[1:51:05] pulling so hard we just loosened the
[1:51:07] drag and I I know y'all know the
[1:51:09] principle sometimes you need to realize
[1:51:11] that when you are fighting with God he
[1:51:14] never lost you he just loosened off the
[1:51:17] drag and you're out there running
[1:51:19] thinking you that you've got your own
[1:51:21] wheel and you got your long way but he
[1:51:23] still got a hook in you and when you get
[1:51:26] really
[1:51:27] tired when you get really tired you'll
[1:51:31] turn that old head toward the boat and
[1:51:33] he'll start reeling you in listen I tell
[1:51:36] you what one day I got tired I was
[1:51:39] sitting in a service and I got tired and
[1:51:41] he begin to drag
[1:51:44] me he tightened the drag brother and he
[1:51:47] started breing me in and let me tell you
[1:51:49] this he got me in the boat and I'm going
[1:51:51] home with him
[1:51:57] we didn't save
[1:52:00] ourselves that deposit of deity that's
[1:52:04] inside of
[1:52:06] you now now I I I just have to I just
[1:52:11] have to preach what's in my heart
[1:52:13] folks one time I told y'all the story
[1:52:16] here at Grace Tabernacle one time I was
[1:52:18] I was uh just studying how to make gold
[1:52:20] I was going to try to become a rich man
[1:52:23] it's illegal by the
[1:52:26] way but I got the reading on all that
[1:52:28] y'all know gold don't actually come from
[1:52:30] the earth it comes from the heavens yeah
[1:52:32] it comes in fallen stars it fell Stars
[1:52:36] burned out in the heaven fell into the
[1:52:37] Earth deposited gold into the Earth and
[1:52:40] then it made veins of gold in the earth
[1:52:43] which was a fallen Source from heaven
[1:52:46] but the thing about the Fallen source of
[1:52:48] the gold is it's mingled in
[1:52:51] dirt that's that's why some property you
[1:52:54] can buy for a hundred bucks and a
[1:52:57] property right beside it might be worth
[1:52:58] a million it ain't always what's on the
[1:53:01] surface it's what under the surface if
[1:53:04] there's a gold mine in that baby you
[1:53:06] ain't taking no $10 for that acre not
[1:53:09] $100 because the value is not what
[1:53:12] you're seeing it's what's down under the
[1:53:14] dirt and God put a deposit of deity in
[1:53:18] your life and said God so loved the
[1:53:21] world he so valued your
[1:53:24] dirt that he would die to redeem you not
[1:53:28] because of what you look like it's
[1:53:30] what's in the inside of you there's a
[1:53:32] son there's a daughter there's a deposit
[1:53:35] of gold down in there now I know amen
[1:53:37] some people think well the minute we dig
[1:53:39] the gold out it's finished but brother
[1:53:41] Braham taught us better than that he
[1:53:43] said when you dig that gold out you're
[1:53:45] not done he said the old days they
[1:53:46] smelted the gold and hid it in fire he
[1:53:48] said but some of them were beaders of
[1:53:50] gold and they take that gold and begin
[1:53:52] to beat it you know what they were doing
[1:53:54] they were separating the pyate and the
[1:53:55] iron and the ore and the and the
[1:53:57] minerals they were taking out of the
[1:53:59] gold so they could get pure gold the
[1:54:01] same way brother W God done me and you
[1:54:04] he took this old Lawson laid him up on
[1:54:06] his work table and began to beat him and
[1:54:09] he beat him and some of you sitting here
[1:54:11] saw me the day he dug me out of the dirt
[1:54:14] and you watched me get beat for years
[1:54:16] and you wonder why is that boy getting
[1:54:17] beat like that it's because I had to
[1:54:20] Bear an image God wasn't done with me in
[1:54:22] a birth he wanted to see his own
[1:54:27] reflection don't forget your sons and
[1:54:30] daughters of God and he's going to deal
[1:54:33] with you somebody said brother Wayne
[1:54:34] when's it done when the beater can see
[1:54:36] his
[1:54:39] reflection you thought that was the
[1:54:41] neighbor that was beating you you
[1:54:44] thought that was the wife the hus you
[1:54:47] thought that was the customer you
[1:54:49] thought that no sir it was God that
[1:54:52] won't let you stay in that stage of
[1:54:54] infancy but it's forcing you into
[1:55:00] Perfection yes sir what is it it's a
[1:55:03] time that when God has took this lovely
[1:55:08] bride and he's begin to bring her into
[1:55:11] that place now it says in the Scriptures
[1:55:13] it says in the scriptures I'll pour my
[1:55:15] spirit out upon all
[1:55:17] dirt and it would come the time of a
[1:55:20] great appearing and a great
[1:55:23] releasing to this church the things
[1:55:25] that's been hid since the world
[1:55:28] began now the thing is it Brothers I I I
[1:55:32] don't want you to think I'm crazy but
[1:55:35] the sunship does not begin in the
[1:55:38] Millennium sunship is
[1:55:41] here there is to be a manifestation of
[1:55:46] sunship before the
[1:55:50] Rapture do you see
[1:55:52] God predestinated the church further
[1:55:56] than the birth further than the baptism
[1:56:00] so brother Wayne how could she go
[1:56:02] further now now I'm I'm an old hillbilly
[1:56:05] and y'all got to forgive me y'all all
[1:56:06] know that y'all y'all watch me grow up
[1:56:09] some of you watch me get the Holy Ghost
[1:56:12] thank God he wasn't done with me
[1:56:14] there cuz tonight I got the holy ghost
[1:56:16] at the altar now now oh my Uncle Tom
[1:56:18] sitting right there he was there at
[1:56:20] night Uncle Tom you can be a witness I
[1:56:23] didn't know if Matthew was in the Old
[1:56:25] Testament or new did
[1:56:26] I thank God that wasn't the finish of of
[1:56:30] that that thank God God didn't say to me
[1:56:32] that's it boy but he had something
[1:56:35] further it's his
[1:56:37] word the birth makes you a
[1:56:40] son this word makes you an adopted son
[1:56:45] Let's just say it the message places
[1:56:47] you the Baptist can't place you the
[1:56:50] Lutheran can't place you they don't know
[1:56:53] where you go but here's a prophet with
[1:56:56] the mind of God setting the order of the
[1:56:59] church now I'll make it simple for you
[1:57:01] amen there's three steps right here
[1:57:03] isn't there and brother BR said that
[1:57:05] woman in them high heels walked up all
[1:57:08] three but when it come to walking that
[1:57:12] word she said I can wear these high
[1:57:15] heels if I want to and she come up all
[1:57:18] three steps wearing it but when it comes
[1:57:22] to the place Eve fell she fell the same
[1:57:25] place and the Pentecostals fell right
[1:57:27] where Eve fell they fell on the word but
[1:57:30] there's a bride that is predestinated in
[1:57:33] this age that will never fail she will
[1:57:36] never fail because she is the
[1:57:39] word she's not trying to walk the word
[1:57:42] she is the
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:46] word all hell can't stop it she's
[1:57:50] predestinated unto the adoption all hell
[1:57:52] won't stop this that's right brother B
[1:57:55] says and all hell won't stop it you're
[1:57:57] predestinated to it you could stop the
[1:57:59] sun quicker that's right that's right
[1:58:03] how many you ever read the story when
[1:58:04] Jesus he got in the boat with his
[1:58:06] disciples he said get in he said we're
[1:58:08] going to go to the other side y'all know
[1:58:09] what was over there Legion was going to
[1:58:11] get delivered wasn't he and when Jesus
[1:58:13] got in there brother bam tells the story
[1:58:15] he said there got a devil got on every
[1:58:18] wave and while the Believers had Jesus
[1:58:21] rest in the boat they begin to tell
[1:58:24] testimonies and had soon
[1:58:26] forgotten what had been done yesterday
[1:58:30] he said but when that storm rose up they
[1:58:32] soon forgot what it was and all of Hell
[1:58:34] decided I got them all in the same boat
[1:58:37] so I'll kill
[1:58:38] them and brother bam talks about the
[1:58:40] boat they were in he said but after a
[1:58:42] little while Peter said somebody go wake
[1:58:44] the master somebody go wake the master
[1:58:48] brother B said see their fear amen there
[1:58:50] was no reason for their fear
[1:58:52] the master was in the
[1:58:54] boat and brother Bram says it I love how
[1:58:57] brother Bram teaches you know he's a
[1:58:58] he's a simple teacher he said look he
[1:59:00] said that boat was maybe made out of a
[1:59:02] certain type of wood a shittum wood or
[1:59:05] it was made I don't remember what the
[1:59:06] wood was now but it was made out of a
[1:59:07] certain kind of wood he says he says see
[1:59:11] that was a ship made out of wood he said
[1:59:14] but in these last days God has a ship
[1:59:16] made out of mud he has a dirt ship he
[1:59:21] said lose the an mud Texas mud can I add
[1:59:24] some Arkansas mud amen and the devil has
[1:59:27] got on every wave of your life and said
[1:59:30] I'm going to stop that boat but don't
[1:59:32] you forget that the master is in this
[1:59:35] mud
[1:59:38] boat don't for don't don't ever forget
[1:59:41] it he said we're going to the other side
[1:59:44] brother I don't care how many Devils I
[1:59:46] don't care how many demons rise up
[1:59:49] against this church we are going to the
[1:59:52] other side I say somebody ought to wake
[1:59:55] up the master tonight somebody ought to
[1:59:57] say wake
[1:59:58] up I know you think you're going to be
[2:00:00] lost you're not going to be lost they
[2:00:03] were secure in that boat and the
[2:00:05] believer is eternally
[2:00:08] secure say wake up the master wake up
[2:00:12] the master trouble everywhere wake up
[2:00:14] the master let me say storms are there
[2:00:18] but it ain't the storms on the outside
[2:00:20] that get
[2:00:20] you as long as the water stays on the
[2:00:23] outside of the boat you're just fine but
[2:00:26] brother when it starts getting in the
[2:00:28] boat it's time to wait the master get
[2:00:30] the boat calm the
[2:00:39] storm would you stand to your feet with
[2:00:41] me tonight oh I'll tell you yes
[2:00:47] Afflicted but not defeated
[2:00:55] uhhuh I tell you that's
[2:00:59] Unstoppable it's because there's a
[2:01:01] vision we're going to the other
[2:01:04] side there's a vision the little boy was
[2:01:06] going to wake up in Finland he's going
[2:01:08] to get up out of the
[2:01:11] Dead how could he wake
[2:01:16] himself how could he wake himself but
[2:01:18] the vision said he would rise
[2:01:24] see the vision says he would rise listen
[2:01:27] the trials of these this of the trials
[2:01:30] of faith is never going to stop this
[2:01:33] Pride oh I got so many good things
[2:01:37] sorry trials are never stop
[2:01:40] her that really isn't that what Satan's
[2:01:43] tried to do stop her isn't that really
[2:01:45] what the purpose is the
[2:01:49] failures do you know the Bible said in
[2:01:51] Romans 8 that he freely give us all
[2:01:54] things Romans 8th chapter it says it
[2:01:57] that he freely give us all things and
[2:01:59] brother man preaches that message pardon
[2:02:00] you know what he says he says if he give
[2:02:02] us all things I want to speak on one
[2:02:04] thing the pardon he
[2:02:06] gave so here the day I got to studying
[2:02:09] that word it's it's actually an English
[2:02:10] word pardon and how because the King
[2:02:13] James version is the one that uses it
[2:02:14] say he paronthi
[2:02:17] and I thought wow where did they get
[2:02:20] that word I mean how did they come up
[2:02:22] with a word pardon you know in in the
[2:02:25] Bible because it's written in Hebrew and
[2:02:26] then they use the English word pardon
[2:02:28] well it actually comes from like way
[2:02:30] back in the
[2:02:31] 600s that that the British
[2:02:35] kings are Kings and they call it by
[2:02:37] divine right they don't they're not
[2:02:40] elected King they believe God made them
[2:02:41] King so they're Divine Right
[2:02:44] Kings and they found that there were
[2:02:46] times that people were in trouble and
[2:02:50] they needed to release them and the way
[2:02:52] they would do it is they would call it a
[2:02:55] Divine
[2:02:57] progator of
[2:02:59] mercy so they could they could it was
[2:03:01] their
[2:03:02] progator to show
[2:03:04] Mercy 1500s they actually made it law
[2:03:07] that only a king could use
[2:03:10] it and then when they made that they
[2:03:12] called it an act of
[2:03:15] Grace thank you Lord so the Kings and
[2:03:17] British they could they could pardon
[2:03:19] someone and they called it an act of
[2:03:22] Grace now that's how that got into
[2:03:24] America was through George Washington
[2:03:27] when the nation first become a nation
[2:03:29] they had a rebellion right quick they
[2:03:32] had a rebellion against George
[2:03:33] Washington and he was trying to stay the
[2:03:36] Rebellion because they were all
[2:03:38] Americans but there was a rebellion so
[2:03:41] if you can't forgive it how can the
[2:03:43] Rebellion ever
[2:03:45] end so George Washington invoked the rot
[2:03:49] he had saw the kings use
[2:03:52] and he pardoned all the rebellion in his
[2:03:56] nation and all they had to do was turn
[2:03:59] and come and receive their
[2:04:00] pardon George Washington used that to
[2:04:03] calm the rebellion and to make them
[2:04:05] citizens he did the same thing do you
[2:04:07] know when you know when President
[2:04:08] Lincoln amen that's how he began to
[2:04:10] cause the divide the Civil War to become
[2:04:13] in unity again is he give a blanket
[2:04:16] pardon to any of the rebels that could
[2:04:19] deny that they were against America
[2:04:21] America they if they would pledge
[2:04:22] allegiance and receive they could have a
[2:04:25] pardon I looked on the internet the
[2:04:27] other day and there's little pardon
[2:04:29] notes written on every kind of paper you
[2:04:31] could find it's all over the Internet
[2:04:33] you can find little pieces of paper from
[2:04:35] the office executive branch signed
[2:04:38] Abraham Lincoln full pardon and he was
[2:04:40] handing out pardons like crazy because
[2:04:42] he was trying to end a a civil
[2:04:45] war see if if if there's no way for them
[2:04:48] to to be pardoned how could they ever be
[2:04:51] a nation
[2:04:53] again so he was causing his enemies to
[2:04:57] become his
[2:04:59] brothers through a
[2:05:05] pardon what what what's our president's
[2:05:07] name the rebel president is it
[2:05:11] Jackson no ST no that's Stonewall
[2:05:13] Jackson I I've got the name written down
[2:05:15] on here huh Andrew Andrew Jackson yeah
[2:05:19] it's Andrew
[2:05:20] Jackson what yeah he's the president of
[2:05:22] the of the Rebellion the southern
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:27] states what in the world come on you
[2:05:30] bunch of
[2:05:33] rebelson Davis Jefferson Davis thank you
[2:05:37] I knew it wasn't Andrew Jackson because
[2:05:39] Andrew Jackson's the one that pardoned
[2:05:40] Jefferson
[2:05:43] Davis Andrew Jackson was the president
[2:05:45] of the United States Jefferson Davis was
[2:05:47] the rebel president that led the
[2:05:49] rebellion and he actually pardoned
[2:05:52] him and brought him back
[2:05:55] in now y'all heard brother B tell the
[2:05:58] story The pardon with Abraham Lin you
[2:05:59] heard that well let me say this I
[2:06:02] couldn't find that specific case
[2:06:04] although there's thousands of Pardons
[2:06:06] sold it but I did find one that Wilson
[2:06:08] versus the United States and there was
[2:06:10] two men robbed a mail truck and they
[2:06:12] were going to be killed this Wilson was
[2:06:14] given a
[2:06:15] pardon and he denied
[2:06:18] it and they killed him
[2:06:21] right now in Supreme Court there is a
[2:06:24] ruling that reads that a pardon must be
[2:06:28] delivered to be a
[2:06:31] pardon and to make the full delivery it
[2:06:34] has to be accepted oh yeah other words a
[2:06:38] pardon isn't
[2:06:39] delivered until the pardon is
[2:06:42] accepted it's in your
[2:06:45] law it says in the law now this is
[2:06:48] powerful that a president can give a
[2:06:51] pardon from the executive branch and the
[2:06:54] Congress has no right at all to
[2:06:57] impede to impede because it is his
[2:07:01] prerogative or his right yeah and it
[2:07:04] wasn't given to the Justice Branch it
[2:07:06] was given to the executive
[2:07:07] branch brother I tell you
[2:07:10] what you talking about you talking about
[2:07:12] something wonderful you said preacher
[2:07:14] what are you talking about I'm talking
[2:07:16] about I'm talking about when
[2:07:18] Ford pardon Nixon
[2:07:22] he pardoned the man you know why amen
[2:07:25] now hey let's let's update it could we
[2:07:27] can we update it when President Trump
[2:07:30] come in office and there was
[2:07:32] 16,700 uh uh uh fellow Americans that
[2:07:35] were in great trouble what'd he do he
[2:07:38] pardoned them made people
[2:07:42] mad well they did this and they did this
[2:07:45] and they did this but a president could
[2:07:48] just pardon
[2:07:49] them and nobody impede his right to just
[2:07:53] pardon
[2:07:54] him glory to
[2:07:57] God I tell you what I I was pretty
[2:08:00] excited about that and then I found out
[2:08:03] what every Republican was mad about is
[2:08:05] Joe Biden yeah the last minutes him

[2:08:10] he did he preemptively pardoned his own
[2:08:14] children Oh my he preemptively done it

[2:16:58] tonight say Lord isn't it wonderful to
[2:17:00] know you in that way amen you know
[2:17:04] brother way he got to tell him that and
[2:17:07] I got to think about over in India I
[2:17:09] preached in a little village over there
[2:17:11] few years ago and and and the when they
[2:17:13] went out there they the church was real
[2:17:15] small had was a little round Hut kind of
[2:17:17] thing and had a thatch roof on it and
[2:17:20] the brothers took me there and you could
[2:17:21] hear all the people singing and we got
[2:17:23] to walk around there and it was only it
[2:17:25] was only about this tall and then the
[2:17:27] you know the roof the thatch roof over
[2:17:28] and I I got to walk around well how you
[2:17:30] how you supposed to get in there well
[2:17:32] over in the side they had a little hole
[2:17:33] and you had to kind of get down get down
[2:17:36] it wasn't no bigger than this Pulpit at
[2:17:37] the doorway so you had to kind of crawl
[2:17:39] to get into the church and I went in
[2:17:41] there and everybody they had it built
[2:17:42] down in the ground because of the
[2:17:43] weather it' get so hot out there and so
[2:17:45] they built it down to kind of keep it
[2:17:47] cool in the in the the building and and
[2:17:50] you know I I sitting there and got to
[2:17:52] looking around and and realize that they
[2:17:54] had built the entire Sanctuary out of
[2:17:56] dirt it was just a mud hut and the
[2:17:59] brother got to telling me and you know
[2:18:00] here there's a river right there next
[2:18:02] door and he said you know I said well
[2:18:04] it's a wonderful place that y'all built
[2:18:05] he said well he said just enjoy it for a
[2:18:08] little while for in a couple months it
[2:18:09] ain't going to be here I said well what
[2:18:11] do you mean he said well every year
[2:18:12] there's a monsoon that comes through and
[2:18:14] during monsoon season he said it just
[2:18:16] comes through and it wipes all this out
[2:18:18] he said there ain't nothing left of it I
[2:18:19] said well brother that's just terrible
[2:18:21] what do y'all do then he said we just
[2:18:22] build it back again he said cuz the life
[2:18:25] that's on the inside is better than the
[2:18:26] dirt that's on the outside I thought
[2:18:28] brother that preach right there and it
[2:18:30] did tonight there's something on the
[2:18:31] inside of it sometimes it just gets torn
[2:18:33] down sometimes it's trampled by storms
[2:18:36] it may get washed away by some great
[2:18:38] storm that came through but there's a
[2:18:39] life on the inside that'll just build it
[2:18:41] back up again I thank God that we have a
[2:18:43] life inside of our dir by the grace of
[2:18:45] Jesus Christ but the Wayne said it
[2:18:48] wasn't the Justice branch that had a
[2:18:49] right to give Grace it was the executive
[2:18:51] branch I thought thank God that it was
[2:18:54] cuz it wasn't Justice that we needed it
[2:18:56] was the grace of Jesus Christ it wasn't
[2:18:58] what we deserve but it's the grace of
[2:19:00] Jesus I thank God that there was a
[2:19:02] greater Branch than the branch of
[2:19:04] justice that was put over my life but
[2:19:07] the power of Grace has been bestowed
[2:19:09] upon us that makes me want to Worship
