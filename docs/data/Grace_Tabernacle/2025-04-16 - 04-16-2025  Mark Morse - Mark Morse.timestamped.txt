[31:02] Wonderful. Well, I sought the
[31:06] Lord and he answered
[31:10] me. He delivered
[31:14] me from every
[31:18] fear. Those who look on
[31:22] him are radian.
[31:26] They'll never be
[31:29] ashamed. They'll never be
[31:34] ashamed. So
[31:36] magnify the

[33:03] [Music]
[33:06] Amen. Do you love the Lord this evening?
[33:09] Amen. And we was talking uh Sunday I got
[33:12] uh brother Matt he was was preaching on
[33:14] the blessings of the Lord but before the
[33:16] service I was just reading and come
[33:19] across it when it talks about Joo and
[33:22] how that he looked up and he they were
[33:24] looking out the window and he was
[33:26] looking up in a window and he when he
[33:28] cast Jezebel down they threw her down
[33:30] after that and I got to looking at that
[33:31] word window and I thought that is an odd
[33:34] word and I got to looking at scriptures
[33:36] about the word window. I just kept doing
[33:39] I was wondering, is that a message? I
[33:40] mean, what what is up with the word
[33:42] window? And I thought, how do you even
[33:44] preach about a window? But when I come
[33:46] in here and I got to hearing brother
[33:47] Matt preaching, he started talking about
[33:49] the windows of heaven being open. He
[33:51] started talking about the blessings of
[33:53] God coming down. And I went, that's how
[33:55] you preach about windows. Amen. Amen.
[33:57] You can see out the window. You could
[33:59] you you know, you can look out the
[34:00] window. You do all these things. But the
[34:02] blessings of God when they come out from
[34:04] the windows of heaven, that starts to
[34:06] change things in our lives. Hallelujah.
[34:08] Amen. I just appreciate it. The It's
[34:10] just an honor to be here this
[34:13] afternoon. And we're just looking
[34:16] forward to what the Lord has in store.
[34:17] Amen. Every every time we come into
[34:19] service, we just look forward to what
[34:21] the Lord has in store. Amen. I I walk in
[34:24] here with an expectation that the Lord's
[34:26] going to move. You know, in school, we
[34:28] have expectations for the way our
[34:30] children are and the way they need to
[34:31] act. But I have an expectation when I
[34:33] walk in this door that I know that my
[34:35] God is fixed to come down and he's
[34:37] fixing to show up and he's going to show
[34:39] out. He's about to do something tonight.
[34:41] I know he is. I believe he is. And
[34:43] there's no doubt in my mind that God's
[34:45] going to move and he's going to talk to
[34:46] somebody tonight. Amen. Do you love him?
[34:50] Do you thank him? Amen. Go. Want you to
[34:52] give him another hand clap of praise.
[34:57] Amen. Amen. He's sure worthy of it.
[35:01] Amen. If you just want to turn to
[35:03] Isaiah chapter 9, we're going to read
[35:06] verse two.
[35:11] Amen.
[35:21] Isaiah chapter 9 and verse two. And then
[35:24] we'll move into 2 Corinthians 4 and 6-7.
[35:31] Isaiah 9 and2 says, "The people that
[35:34] walked in darkness have seen a great
[35:37] light, they that dwell in the land of
[35:39] the shadow of death. Upon them hath the
[35:42] light shine." 2 Corinthians
[35:45] 4 and six it says for God who commandeth
[35:49] the light to shine out of darkness has
[35:52] shined in our hearts to give the light
[35:55] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[35:57] the face of Jesus Christ but we have
[36:00] this treasure in earthn vessels that the
[36:02] excell excellency of the power may be of
[36:05] God and not of us. Amen. individuals who
[36:09] bow your heads this evening. Heavenly
[36:11] Father, Lord, we just thank you for your
[36:13] mercy. Lord, we thank you for your
[36:15] anointing and your presence here in this
[36:17] building. Father, we pray that you would
[36:19] move upon every heart and upon every
[36:21] life. That the light that we speak of
[36:23] would shine into the darkness tonight.
[36:25] Lord, that you would reveal the word of
[36:27] God to each and every one of us. Lord,
[36:29] that you would touch our lives and our
[36:30] hearts. Lord, if we need healing, God, I
[36:32] pray that you would heal us. Lord, if we
[36:34] need deliverance, I pray that you would
[36:36] deliver us. Lord, if we need the Holy
[36:38] Ghost in our lives, I pray you'd give
[36:39] that to us. Father, we just thank you,
[36:41] Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[36:45] You can be seated this
[36:47] evening. Amen. When we speak about a
[36:49] light, you know, it's hard to talk about
[36:51] a light without talking about the sun.
[36:54] And when you look at the sun, no matter
[36:55] what you say or do, it's always there.
[36:58] Amen. You can walk outside in the
[37:00] morning and the sun is there. Amen.
[37:02] Every night that come, every dark hour
[37:04] that comes, the sun is going to open up
[37:06] and it's going to shine upon that
[37:08] darkness. And the darkness is going to
[37:09] have to flee. I don't care what you do,
[37:12] you can tell the sun all day, son, you
[37:13] just stop existing. And the sun is not
[37:16] going to stop existing. It's not going
[37:17] to stop burning. The light is not going
[37:19] to stop shining. Amen. Amen. That
[37:21] there's nothing you can do or say that's
[37:23] going to stop the sunlight from coming
[37:25] to our lives. There's nothing you're
[37:27] going to do or say to stop the sunlight
[37:28] from warming the earth and warming up
[37:30] the seeds that are laying in the earth.
[37:32] There's nothing you can say or do to a
[37:34] plant that's going to stop it from
[37:35] growing. You can't stop the sun. I don't
[37:37] care how you do it. But I got to
[37:39] thinking about that and I thought about
[37:41] what does it take to us to see? What
[37:42] does it take to see? It always takes a
[37:45] light. Amen. Amen. By the word of God,
[37:48] the sun shines today because the very
[37:51] sun that we're enjoying is God's word
[37:53] made manifest.
[37:55] The very sunlight that we see outside is
[37:57] nothing but God's word when he said,
[38:00] "Let there be light." And I got to
[38:02] thinking about how that, you know, the
[38:04] sun is that light. But what if what if
[38:06] there was a way of taking away that
[38:08] light? What if you could possibly do
[38:10] that? And it got me to thinking and and
[38:13] I got I got to kind of researching a
[38:15] little bit and and the you know, the
[38:17] research says that within a week the
[38:19] average global surface temperature would
[38:21] drop below 0 degrees F. the surface of
[38:25] the oceans would freeze
[38:26] over. All photosynthesis would stop and
[38:30] most plants would die within weeks. And
[38:32] that made me think about how that would
[38:34] if there's no light, there's no food. If
[38:37] there's no light, there's no growth. And
[38:39] we have a light this evening that has
[38:40] shined upon the people of God. It causes
[38:43] things to grow. And and it causes that
[38:45] that thing that's down inside of you to
[38:47] grow. And that light shines upon your
[38:49] life. You might have been out in
[38:50] darkness. You might have been out in the
[38:52] world. You might have been all confused,
[38:53] but when that light struck your life, it
[38:56] started making something grow. And you
[38:58] might have you might have saw that light
[38:59] one time. It might have flashed before
[39:01] your eyes and you didn't recognize it
[39:03] and you didn't see what it was. But it
[39:04] might have been just a few days later
[39:06] you realized what that light was. You
[39:08] realize that that light was calling you
[39:10] to grow a little bit higher in God. You
[39:12] realize that there was something down
[39:14] inside you of you that was stirring and
[39:16] it was moving. You might have it might
[39:18] have been covered up in concrete, but
[39:20] that lie warmed the concrete and it
[39:22] begin to come down into your life and it
[39:24] begin to touch you and change you and
[39:26] move you and heal you and bring you out
[39:28] of darkness. You might have been in a
[39:30] barroom somewhere, but the light come
[39:32] down into a barroom and touched your
[39:34] life. You might have been out in the
[39:36] world just walking around lost, but that
[39:38] light came and it found you where you
[39:40] were. And I thank God that there is a
[39:42] light that has shined upon every one of
[39:44] us that came and found us. Amen. the
[39:47] darkness couldn't comprehend it. The
[39:48] darkness could do nothing with it.
[39:52] Hallelujah. I got to thinking about that
[39:54] today that how the the the that light
[39:56] there's no uh there's no possible way
[39:59] that darkness can defeat the light. You
[40:01] bring the light into darkness, darkness
[40:03] has got to flee. Darkness has got to go
[40:05] away. Darkness has got to move. When you
[40:07] have a little bit of darkness in your
[40:09] life, just shine the light of God upon
[40:11] it and watch what happens. Watch every
[40:13] bit of darkness flee. I don't care where
[40:15] it's at. I don't care if it's down in
[40:17] the basement. Take the light down there
[40:18] in the basement and watch the darkness
[40:20] flee. Take the light up in the attic and
[40:22] watch the darkness flee. It's time to
[40:24] shine the light upon your life and see
[40:26] where you're at. See where the darkness
[40:28] is fighting against you. Go shine the
[40:30] light of God on it and see what happens.
[40:33] See how it changes. See how it grows.
[40:35] See how it moves. Just shine a little
[40:37] bit of light on it.
[40:39] Amen. If you've got a spirit tormenting
[40:41] you, go take the light of God and let
[40:43] that light of God move upon that spirit.
[40:46] Move upon that devil and that enemy
[40:48] that's fighting you. Go shine the light
[40:49] of God upon it and see how he has to
[40:52] move. I can tell you one time the light
[40:54] cannot comprehend the darkness. It can't
[40:56] do it. It can't fight it. It can't. It's
[40:58] got no ability to fight with it. And and
[41:00] I find that one time that that Christ
[41:02] himself come down and he went down in
[41:04] the darkness and the darkness had to
[41:06] spit him back out. the darkness couldn't
[41:09] handle the light. How many times when
[41:11] you're at work and the and the darkness
[41:13] starts to come around and you just start
[41:14] shining your light amongst them?
[41:16] Sometimes they might agree with you just
[41:18] for a little bit, but it ain't just a
[41:20] few minutes and the darkness starts
[41:21] walking away. It starts moving away from
[41:24] you. It starts getting out of out of
[41:25] your out of your out of your presence.
[41:28] It starts saying, "I don't want none of
[41:29] that." But then there's that one person
[41:31] that you begin to speak to and you begin
[41:34] to shine that light upon and they begin
[41:36] to get a little closer to you. They
[41:37] begin to know that there's a move of God
[41:40] down in your life. There's something in
[41:41] your life that is shining before that
[41:43] person. The darkness cannot comprehend
[41:46] the light.
[41:48] Amen. People have come across the light
[41:49] and they don't know what it is. People
[41:51] come across this message and and it does
[41:53] nothing for them. It doesn't touch their
[41:55] heart. It doesn't touch their life. It
[41:57] doesn't see them. It's just complete
[41:59] total darkness to them. They don't have
[42:01] a clue. Amen. In the beginning was the
[42:04] word. The word was with God and the word
[42:06] was God. Yes, sir. The same was in the
[42:08] beginning with
[42:09] God. All things were made by him. In him
[42:12] was life and the life was the light of
[42:16] men. Amen. And the light shineth in
[42:18] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[42:21] it not. You know, I thought about how
[42:23] Jesus was standing there that when you
[42:26] talk about the light of God showing upon
[42:28] a people's lives that he was standing up
[42:30] there on a boat and he was just a man.
[42:31] When the boat was moving around, he was
[42:33] just a man standing there. He had fell
[42:35] asleep and he was just a man. But when
[42:37] he put his foot upon the rail of the
[42:38] boat when he stuck his foot up there, it
[42:41] changed right then and there. The line
[42:42] of God was standing there and he said,
[42:44] "Peace be still." He said, "Peace, it's
[42:47] over." And the storm had to stop. The
[42:49] wind and waves had to stop because the
[42:52] master of the light was standing there
[42:53] and it was telling it, "Don't you go any
[42:55] further. You can't do anymore."
[42:58] Amen. He said, "Peace be still." And the
[43:00] ways in the window bade. He was more
[43:02] than a man when he did that. He was God.
[43:05] He was a man at the cross when he cried
[43:07] for mercy. He was a man when he died.
[43:10] But on Easter morning when the tomb
[43:11] opened and the seals broke and death and
[43:14] hell could not hold him any longer, he
[43:16] came out triumphant. He was more than a
[43:18] man.
[43:19] Amen. Sometimes in the dark hours than
[43:23] Jesus come, it was the darkest hour that
[43:26] the three Hebrew children had ever seen.
[43:29] Amen. One morning when the king had
[43:31] heated the furnace seven times hotter
[43:33] than it ever was, the darkest hour those
[43:35] fellas had ever seen, they were walking
[43:37] in the middle of that. They didn't know
[43:39] what was fix to happen, but they said,
[43:41] "I'm not going to I'm not going to
[43:42] worship your god. I'm going to worship
[43:44] the God of Daniel. That's the God I'm
[43:46] serving. That's the God I'm praising."
[43:48] And they stood there in the middle of
[43:49] that fire. They knew what was fixed to
[43:51] happen to them. And they wasn't about to
[43:53] back down. And we got a people this
[43:55] evening that stood in the middle of
[43:57] fires. You stood in the middle of wars.
[43:59] You stood in the middle of things that
[44:01] come against you and you said, "I ain't
[44:02] backing down." And every devil in hell
[44:05] come after you. But you ain't backing
[44:07] down. We got a message that said we
[44:09] don't have to back down. We got a God
[44:12] that said, "You don't have to back down.
[44:14] You don't have to cow down to some
[44:15] devil. You don't have to cow down to
[44:17] some sickness. You don't have to cow
[44:19] down to some idea or some man's
[44:21] reasoning. You don't have to cow down to
[44:23] it. And that king said, "You know what?
[44:26] They won't worship." Can you turn this
[44:28] up? He said, "They won't worship my God,
[44:31] so I'll throw them in there
[44:35] and he tied them up." And here they
[44:38] are. They got closer and closer to the
[44:40] fire. The fire got so hot
[44:45] that the men that were throwing them in
[44:46] there died. The men that were throwing
[44:48] them in there burned up, but they never
[44:51] did. Amen.
[44:53] And that old king, he thought he had
[44:55] them. He thought he had them where he
[44:57] wanted them. He thought he had that
[44:58] bunch of holy rollers where he wanted
[45:00] them. And he took and he thrown them off
[45:01] in the flames. And it wasn't just a
[45:04] little bit. And the king got to looking
[45:05] around and he looked over in the pit and
[45:07] he went, "Wait a minute. I only put
[45:09] three in there. Who's the fourth man?
[45:12] But there was a fourth man in the fire.
[45:15] The fourth man came down and he took the
[45:17] the
[45:19] Hey man, he waved the flames off of them
[45:21] and the ropes were burned off of them.
[45:23] And there they were standing in the
[45:25] middle of the fire with Jesus. And there
[45:27] you are standing in the middle of the
[45:29] fire with Jesus. They can't No devil
[45:31] can't stand that kind of heat. He can't
[45:33] get to you. He can't battle you. He
[45:36] can't war with you. He can't fight with
[45:38] you. I don't care what he does or what
[45:40] he says. You're in the middle of the
[45:42] hottest fire that'll burn him up.
[45:45] You're in such a middle of a fire. I can
[45:48] tell you something about a fire dropped
[45:49] down one time in the day of Pentecost
[45:51] and it started getting in people. I'm
[45:54] talking about people they were scared to
[45:56] walk across the street cuz that Rome was
[45:58] after them. The Roman soldiers were
[46:00] threaten were threatening to kill them.
[46:01] The Roman soldiers were threatening to
[46:03] divide them. The Roman soldiers were
[46:05] coming after them every day. They were
[46:07] killing them left and right. Come on.
[46:09] But they got a hold of the fire that
[46:11] changed their lives. And hallelujah.
[46:14] They walked out of there. They walked
[46:16] out of there with such a new anointing.
[46:17] And it's time to get that anointing this
[46:20] evening. When that
[46:23] Hallelujah. It's time for a fresh
[46:25] anointing. Amen. Amen. I say unto you,
[46:28] we got a fresh anointing. We are a
[46:30] blessed people. We've got an anointing
[46:33] of God that is with us. We've got an
[46:35] anointing of God that is in this place
[46:37] that is moving us and it's healing us
[46:39] and it's saving us. And it's not a dead
[46:42] letter. It's not an idea. It's not a
[46:44] reason, but it's a message of the hour
[46:46] that has been spoken across this
[46:48] pullpit. It's not some some.
[46:52] It's not some madeup idea, but it's
[46:55] straight from the light of God. It's
[46:56] straight from the source that brother
[46:58] Aaron was talking about. That's where it
[47:00] come from. It's the same God that was
[47:02] back in the day of Pentecost. It's the
[47:04] same God that was there at the Red Sea.
[47:06] It's the same God that was there with
[47:07] Noah. It's the same God.
[47:10] Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:13] Hallelujah.
[47:22] Amen.
[47:24] Without that light, you couldn't see.
[47:28] Without that light, you could do
[47:32] nothing. I've tried. I tried to go
[47:35] without the light. I tried to go down
[47:38] the path without the light.
[47:40] You ever been out in the woods without a
[47:42] light? The middle of the dark. I
[47:45] remember one time I was out hunting and
[47:46] and I got to going in the woods and my
[47:49] phone, that's all I had was my phone,
[47:50] which is kind of silly, but I had that
[47:52] phone and it
[47:56] died. I didn't know where I was going. I
[47:59] was on the back of the lake and I got
[48:00] hit in places and I'm going I don't know
[48:02] where I'm at. So, I finally found the
[48:04] edge of the lake and I was so far off of
[48:06] where I was supposed to be, but I didn't
[48:09] have a light. Come on, brother.
[48:11] Amen. Sometimes we go week to week
[48:14] without a light.
[48:16] Sometimes we get into into times and we
[48:18] forget about the light that's guiding
[48:19] us. you. Sometimes we might get caught
[48:21] up in in in ideas and and thoughts and
[48:24] we might get caught up in people and we
[48:26] get to look at other people and we
[48:27] forget about the light that's guiding
[48:28] us. Come on. But if you would just look
[48:30] to the light, it would change it all. It
[48:34] would begin to change your life and it
[48:36] would start moving you and directing you
[48:38] and leading you and guiding you. What
[48:40] did they do in the in the out in the
[48:42] wilderness? The light said, "Go this
[48:44] way." And they went that way. But but
[48:46] just a minute or two or just a few days
[48:49] and they were standing at the banks of a
[48:51] river. They were standing at the banks
[48:53] of the Red Sea and they're going, "God,
[48:55] why did you lead us here? Why did you do
[48:57] this to us, Lord? What is going on here?
[49:00] We're we're here at the Red Sea and and
[49:03] the and the Egyptians are behind us and
[49:05] they're coming after us." But they were
[49:07] following the light of God. Moses knew
[49:09] exactly what he was doing. Hallelujah.
[49:12] Here we are. Sometimes you're at a Red
[49:16] Sea. Sometimes Egypt is standing right
[49:18] behind you. Sometime the world is coming
[49:21] up hot on your heels and you're standing
[49:23] there at the Red Sea. But Moses had
[49:25] something in his possession. Hallelujah.
[49:27] He knew who God was. He knew exactly who
[49:30] he was. And he took the rod that God had
[49:33] given him and he stood it out over the
[49:35] sea and the seas opened up and there
[49:38] went two million two million children of
[49:40] Israel started walking across and then
[49:42] maybe some of them started catching on.
[49:44] They started getting a little revelation
[49:46] that wait a minute. We're walking across
[49:49] this sea on dry ground. They're looking
[49:52] around. They might see the the the the
[49:54] you know I think the the they might see
[49:57] the fish swimming along beside them and
[50:00] they're just walking on dry ground. They
[50:02] don't know, you know, it might have been
[50:03] confusing. I don't know. I wasn't there.
[50:07] But here they are walking on dry ground.
[50:13] I can see that last one coming up out of
[50:15] that.
[50:17] He might have been the oldest guy there.
[50:19] He might have had trouble. He might have
[50:22] had struggle. He might not could walk
[50:24] well. He might not could move well. But
[50:27] he might just be kind of lifted up out
[50:28] of there. Just kind of barely getting
[50:31] along.
[50:33] But God stayed that hand for that one.
[50:36] Amen. Hallelujah. And that one, the one
[50:39] that had been beat, the one that had
[50:41] been tore up, the one that had been
[50:43] tormented every day, the one that had
[50:45] stripes up on his back from the from the
[50:48] Egyptian whips. the one that they just
[50:51] beat him so much and they tormented him
[50:54] so much and they done so much to him. He
[50:57] turned around
[50:59] and he went brother. I mean, if it was
[51:02] me, I might have just looked at the the
[51:03] Egyptians coming and just give him a big
[51:05] old smile.
[51:06] You know what? I remember my God. Maybe
[51:10] they started remembering stories that
[51:13] they had heard about their God. Maybe
[51:15] it's in their minds and it wasn't just a
[51:18] second or two and here come the seas.
[51:21] Them Egyptians was right out in the
[51:23] middle of it. And the Israelites were
[51:25] going, "Oh, wait a minute. I know now
[51:30] what God was doing. I know exactly what
[51:33] he was doing." And it wasn't just a
[51:35] second that Miriam looked over and she
[51:37] saw the the ones that beat her and the
[51:39] ones that whipped on her and the ones
[51:40] that destroyed her life and the ones
[51:42] coming after her. and she saw them
[51:44] floating dead in the water. Hallelujah.
[51:46] And that lady picked up a tambourine and
[51:49] she started rejoicing and she started
[51:51] praising God and she started saying,
[51:53] "Hallelujah. There's my enemy that is
[51:55] floating down in that water and it's
[51:57] over now." But oh, hallelujah, little
[52:00] bride, the
[52:03] enemy is floating in the river. He's no
[52:06] longer pursuing. He can't come after you
[52:08] anymore. He can't come fight you
[52:11] anymore. He can't come to you anymore.
[52:14] Why? Because you're wrapped up in the
[52:15] message. You're wrapped up in the word
[52:17] of the Lord. And you're wrapped up in
[52:19] the light of God. The light is there
[52:21] with you. You have in the light. You got
[52:24] over in the light.
[52:31] Amen. They saw their enemy destroyed and
[52:35] defeated. Amen.
[52:41] Oh, glory. Hallelujah. You know, we was
[52:44] talking about the sun just a few minutes
[52:45] ago. Now that if there was no sun and
[52:50] earth would just li drift off into
[52:55] space. I got to think about that
[52:57] spiritually. If you have no light,
[52:59] you're just drifting.
[53:02] You're just wandering. You don't know
[53:04] where you're going. You don't know how
[53:06] you're getting there. And I started
[53:08] thinking about churches and and how the
[53:11] how that they
[53:12] would churches can tell you the stories
[53:15] of Shamgar. They can sit and they can
[53:17] tell you the stories of Elijah. They can
[53:20] tell you the stories of of Paul and
[53:23] Silas. The Catholic Church can sit you
[53:26] down and tell you all about how that
[53:27] they were standing there and they said,
[53:29] "Won't you just rise up and walk?" They
[53:32] can tell you those stories. But I tell
[53:34] you what, we we can tell those stories,
[53:36] too. But we can also live them. We've
[53:38] lived the story of the Bible. We've
[53:41] lived that story. We've been through
[53:42] those things. We've fought through those
[53:44] things. We've seen those things. The
[53:46] light has shined upon our life. And we
[53:48] have seen the glory of the Lord. I say
[53:50] unto you, lift up your eyes and see the
[53:53] glory of the Lord tonight. Lift up your
[53:55] eyes and see what God is doing. Lift up.
[53:58] We'll stop looking at everybody else,
[54:00] but look up at him. Amen. Look at him
[54:02] and see what he's doing. Look at him and
[54:05] see how this church is moving. Look at
[54:07] him and see how the message is moving.
[54:10] Look at him. Look up at him and see.
[54:13] Amen.
[54:16] Amen. What are we
[54:17] following? Following the light of the
[54:20] Lord. Brother says when they went to
[54:22] develop the
[54:24] picture, they taken out the six glossies
[54:27] that they were supposed to have. He's
[54:29] speaking of the of the picture of the
[54:31] pillar of fire and Sam used to call Sam.
[54:34] He was he said that they would have
[54:36] developed they taken out six glossies
[54:39] that they were supposed to have for Mr.
[54:41] Best shaking his fist and every one of
[54:43] them was blank. God wouldn't permit that
[54:46] camera to take the picture with his fist
[54:50] under that saintly man's nose like that
[54:52] acting like that. Listen to this. And
[54:56] when they pulled the seventh one out,
[54:59] Amen. We went through six ages where it
[55:03] was dark and it was confusing and we
[55:06] didn't know what to do. People didn't
[55:07] know what to do. They went through
[55:08] through Iranian's age. They went through
[55:11] Martin's age. They went through Luther's
[55:13] age. But there was just that little bit
[55:15] of light that was guiding them through
[55:16] those ages. But that seventh one begin
[55:19] to show. And the light of God begin to
[55:22] show on a picture. It wasn't a picture
[55:23] of William Brandon. It was a picture of
[55:25] God. It was the anointing of God that
[55:28] has come across this message. That was
[55:30] God in that picture. Amen. The world
[55:33] don't even know what it is. The world
[55:35] don't know nothing about it. But it was
[55:37] God vindicating his prophet. It was
[55:39] saying that's who that is. It's God
[55:42] showing who he is.
[55:45] The very God of heaven. That's what
[55:49] Amen. The very God of heaven showing who
[55:52] he is. Showing who he was. Oh, how what
[55:55] what a what a humbling thought that that
[55:57] is. That that was God showing who he
[56:00] was.
[56:03] And people just let it drift by them.
[56:05] They let it pass by them. They don't
[56:07] hear what he has to say. They turn it
[56:09] off or they turn their backs on it and
[56:11] they walk away. But we're a bride. We
[56:14] don't turn our back on it. We don't walk
[56:15] away. We're still following that same
[56:17] pillar of fire. We're still following
[56:19] that same thing. We're still still
[56:21] following the anointing of God. It's a
[56:23] fresh anointing. It's a new anointing.
[56:25] It's a new place. It's a new thing. It's
[56:28] not a dead letter. I'm tired of people
[56:30] wanting to say things are dead. This
[56:32] ain't dead. This is still growing. This
[56:34] is still moving. This is still
[56:36] manufacturing. This is still showing
[56:38] things. This is still revealing things.
[56:42] It ain't a dead letter. It's an old time
[56:45] alive God. I wish I knew how to talk.
[56:53] I'm talking about a God. I sit there in
[56:55] school today.
[57:01] We We got We got to talk about
[57:04] a We got to talk about Mo or No, or
[57:08] Jesus cuz we're in Rome. We're talking
[57:11] about the Roman
[57:12] uh the R Roman
[57:16] Empire. And I got to that part. It's a
[57:19] topic subject you got to tell the kids.
[57:22] and it was talking about Jesus being a
[57:24] Jew. And it was all I could do to sit
[57:27] there and read that out loud to those
[57:29] kids. I wanted to preach. I wanted to
[57:32] come unglued. I wanted to say, "Well, he
[57:34] wasn't just a Jew, but he was God.
[57:37] That's who he was. He was God standing
[57:39] there in human flesh once again." And
[57:41] oh, glory. That same God has stepped
[57:44] down into a little bride and he's
[57:45] showing her who she is. Hallelujah.
[57:49] Won't somebody ever get a hold of that
[57:51] revelation? There ain't nothing standing
[57:53] in your way.
[57:56] Ain't no devil can. I don't I might keep
[57:58] coming to this, but I'm so sick of the
[58:01] devil standing in the bride's way. I'm
[58:03] sick of them looking at him. I'm sick of
[58:05] them playing with it. I'm sick of people
[58:07] reasoning with it. I'm sick of people
[58:09] looking at other people and fussing
[58:10] about what they're doing. Turn around
[58:12] and look who's moving this place. It's
[58:15] God moving. It's God's turn. It's God
[58:18] revealing. It's God opening up the word
[58:21] of God. That's who it is. It's a
[58:23] leadership of the Holy Spirit. It's a
[58:26] leadership. It's the anointing of God
[58:28] moving upon people, opening people's
[58:30] lives.
[58:32] That's what it is.
[58:40] It's God.
[58:43] It's God.
[58:45] It's a creator of heaven and earth.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:50] This ain't an idol that you can walk up
[58:53] and and you can take from from India and
[58:56] you can bring home with
[58:57] you. This ain't a Roman god sitting on a
[59:01] throne somewhere. This ain't Zeus
[59:03] sitting somewhere. But this is the
[59:05] almighty God of heaven that wants to
[59:08] commune with you. He wants to talk with
[59:10] you. He wants to speak with you. He
[59:13] wants to have you. He wants to have you
[59:14] as his own. He wants to love you. He
[59:17] wants you to love him back. He's doing
[59:19] it all for you. He's calling out to you,
[59:21] telling you, "Won't you just come back
[59:23] to me? Won't you come unto me? Won't you
[59:25] hear what I have to say?" Hallelujah. He
[59:28] wants to be with his bride. He wants to
[59:30] be like, "You know what, y'all? Let's
[59:32] go. Let's let let's get right. Let's
[59:34] serve the Lord. Let's get our dress
[59:36] right. Let's get our act right. Bride,
[59:39] make yourself ready." Amen.
[59:41] But then his grace holds on and he's
[59:44] waiting upon you. He's waiting on his
[59:46] people.
[59:48] Amen.
[59:50] People can rise up with this, that, or
[59:52] other isms can rise. Communism, fascism,
[59:56] and all other isms can rise.
[59:58] Superstitions, cults, whatever it might
[1:00:00] rise or whatever it might be might rise.
[1:00:04] But when that king light of the Bible
[1:00:06] raises up all superstitions and things,
[1:00:09] but you see, we know it's there, but
[1:00:12] until it's a vindicated proves it's
[1:00:14] light, then we have no right to argue
[1:00:16] against that. That's right.
[1:00:19] Because it shuts all other light out.
[1:00:22] Jesus said, "Let every man's word be a
[1:00:24] lie and mine be the truth." His word is
[1:00:27] superior over all man's word, over all
[1:00:31] anything. His word is light. Amen.
[1:00:35] I got to thinking of or looking at Mo at
[1:00:39] Abraham. How Abraham was
[1:00:42] walking. Abraham was looking for a city
[1:00:44] that was right above him. But after he
[1:00:47] separated from Lot, God said, "Abraham,
[1:00:49] lift up your eyes." And Abraham lifted
[1:00:51] up his eyes and he said,"Abraham, all
[1:00:53] that you see, that's yours." And
[1:00:55] Abraham, good luck. And be like, "Okay,
[1:00:57] okay,
[1:00:59] but but what? Nothing. Just lift up your
[1:01:03] eyes. It's yours. Amen. Let a bride,
[1:01:05] lift up your eyes. It's yours. Look at
[1:01:08] your promises. It's yours. It's your
[1:01:11] possession. It's not the enemy's
[1:01:13] possession. It's not the devil's tools.
[1:01:15] It's yours. And it's yours. It's what
[1:01:17] you can possess. It's what you can walk
[1:01:19] into. It's what you can say. Lift up
[1:01:22] your eyes.
[1:01:26] Gave him. God gave him. God tells
[1:01:28] Abraham that his seed would be numbered
[1:01:30] with the stars.
[1:01:32] Abraham didn't
[1:01:34] waver. Abraham believed.
[1:01:38] Abraham Abraham heard the promise of
[1:01:40] God. And he went through all those those
[1:01:43] long
[1:01:44] years. And finally one day his little
[1:01:47] wife gave birth to a baby. And then
[1:01:50] Abraham could walk in and take a hold of
[1:01:53] the promise.
[1:01:56] Abraham could walk in and take that baby
[1:01:58] up in his arms. And he knew that here
[1:02:01] was his promise that God had gave him.
[1:02:03] He knew that that he could take that
[1:02:05] baby and he could walk over to the
[1:02:07] rocket chair and he could sit and he
[1:02:08] could rock his promise to sleep. Abraham
[1:02:11] could sit and teach his promise to the
[1:02:14] ways of that he had. He could tell him
[1:02:16] Isaac, "This is how you do things. This
[1:02:18] is how you live. This is how you work.
[1:02:20] This is how you need to pay your tithes.
[1:02:22] This is how you need you need to pay
[1:02:23] your taxes. This is how you need to do
[1:02:25] those things." Abraham could go and go
[1:02:27] outside and and play catch with his
[1:02:29] promise. He could go out there and he
[1:02:31] could say, "Isaac, won't you come play a
[1:02:33] little bit?" They go out there and they
[1:02:34] throw a ball back and forth
[1:02:37] because it was his promise. But here was
[1:02:40] Abraham communing with his promise. Here
[1:02:43] was Abraham speaking with his promise.
[1:02:46] Abraham was talking with his promise. He
[1:02:48] was having communion with his promise.
[1:02:51] Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] All of one day the Lord said,
[1:02:55] "Abraham, I need you to take your your
[1:02:58] promise, take him up on the mountain. I
[1:03:01] want you to sacrifice
[1:03:02] him." See, but Abraham again in his
[1:03:08] faith, he knew that God had promised him
[1:03:12] something. He knew God had promised him
[1:03:14] that that seed line would be there. And
[1:03:16] he knew that there was no other way
[1:03:18] outside of Isaac.
[1:03:21] So, here he goes. Abraham takes his
[1:03:24] promise and they go up the mountain and
[1:03:26] they're walking up the mountain. I tell
[1:03:28] you what Abraham could have done.
[1:03:29] Abraham could have looked down and he
[1:03:32] could have looked and watched everything
[1:03:34] that was around him. He could have kept
[1:03:36] his eyes on the ground. He could have
[1:03:38] kept his eyes off over here somewhere.
[1:03:40] He could have kept his eyes over there
[1:03:42] somewhere. But Abraham kept his eyes and
[1:03:44] his faith upon God. He kept his faith
[1:03:46] upon the promised word of God. He knew
[1:03:49] that there would be that that him and
[1:03:50] the son and his son would come back. But
[1:03:53] as they begin to move up the mountain
[1:03:55] and they get up to the to the place
[1:03:57] where where the sacrifice is to be made
[1:03:59] and Isaac looks at him. He said, "Daddy,
[1:04:01] I see this the fire. I see the sticks. I
[1:04:05] see all these things, but where's the
[1:04:07] sacrifice?" And here that's the faith of
[1:04:09] Abraham. And Abraham says, "My son, God
[1:04:12] will provide himself a sacrifice." And
[1:04:15] the angel of the Lord was standing
[1:04:17] there. And Abraham laid his promise down
[1:04:20] upon the altar. There is he laid it
[1:04:22] down. Abraham had to let go of his
[1:04:24] promise. Come on. What a thought that
[1:04:27] is. He had to let go. And he laid him
[1:04:29] down and he took the knife and he
[1:04:31] started to cut his he started to to make
[1:04:33] the sacrifice. But an angel of the Lord
[1:04:37] caught his hand and he said,"Abraham,
[1:04:39] lift up your eyes." And Abraham looked
[1:04:41] up and there was a ram caught in the
[1:04:43] bushes. And he said, "There is my
[1:04:45] Jehovah Gyra. There is my place. There
[1:04:48] is my provider." And it was standing
[1:04:50] there in the thicket. God in the
[1:04:52] thicket. And Abraham Oh, glory. Abraham
[1:04:55] took a hold of that promise.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. And to He took a hold of
[1:05:01] that promise that God had gave him. He
[1:05:03] took a hold of that Jehovah Gyra that
[1:05:05] God had gave him. And he laid that ram
[1:05:07] down upon the altar. And there Abraham
[1:05:10] slew that ram and maybe the blood got
[1:05:13] all over him and he was handling that
[1:05:15] promise. But what do we have to do? You
[1:05:18] got to get a hold of the promise. This
[1:05:20] promise ain't letting go. Never let go
[1:05:23] of that promise. Don't you ever let go
[1:05:25] of what God has given you. Don't let go
[1:05:27] of Jesus. Too many people have fought
[1:05:29] for it. Too many people have battled for
[1:05:31] it. There was a woman one day that she
[1:05:33] saw her promise walking in the middle of
[1:05:35] a crowd. She saw him in there and she
[1:05:38] knew she had to get to him cuz she had
[1:05:40] that issue of blood and it wouldn't
[1:05:42] stop. It wouldn't it wouldn't seize up.
[1:05:44] It wouldn't never do anything. But she
[1:05:46] knew her promise was right there in the
[1:05:48] middle of that crowd. And what she did
[1:05:50] was she started walking
[1:05:53] and she started moving. She wasn't
[1:05:54] giving up. She wasn't quitting. She
[1:05:57] wasn't walking away. She wasn't saying
[1:05:59] things and and ideas. She wasn't looking
[1:06:01] at nothing but him. Amen. She kept her
[1:06:04] eyes upon him. Wherever he went, she
[1:06:07] went. Wherever he moved, she moved.
[1:06:09] Wherever he whatever place he went down
[1:06:12] there, she was.
[1:06:14] I say unto you, wherever God is, you go
[1:06:17] there. You need something from God. When
[1:06:19] he's there, you go. How many times
[1:06:22] brother Matt talks about that that
[1:06:23] little lady over in India and he and and
[1:06:26] she had the the dreamer. The Lord spoke
[1:06:28] to her and said, "You go to the gospel
[1:06:30] meeting." And that's what she did. She
[1:06:33] started going to gospel meetings. She
[1:06:35] had a promise of God and she started
[1:06:38] going to meeting after meeting after
[1:06:40] meeting after meeting. But she met her
[1:06:42] promise one day when brother Matt was
[1:06:44] speaking and he was talking about his
[1:06:46] arm being broke. And it wasn't just a
[1:06:48] second. Her promise wasn't brother Matt,
[1:06:50] but her promise walked down off that
[1:06:52] platform and walked back there to her.
[1:06:55] That anoint that anointing that the man
[1:06:56] of God had walked back there to her. And
[1:06:59] that God reached down and he told her,
[1:07:01] he said, "You just come up here a little
[1:07:03] bit." It might have scared people half
[1:07:05] to death, but there was a whole bunch of
[1:07:06] people that went to rejoicing because
[1:07:08] there was somebody that had got a hold
[1:07:10] of her promise
[1:07:12] and she started walking. But that little
[1:07:14] lady, she was wanting to get to her
[1:07:17] promise. And she fought through
[1:07:18] everything. She fought through every
[1:07:20] trial. She fought through every battle.
[1:07:22] She had no other way. She couldn't, the
[1:07:25] doctors couldn't help her. Her mom and
[1:07:27] daddy couldn't help her. things next to
[1:07:28] people couldn't help her. People are
[1:07:31] little bride, they can't help you. The
[1:07:33] world can't help you. No matter the
[1:07:35] things you get caught up in, they can't
[1:07:37] help you. But God can help you. He can
[1:07:40] pull you out of when you get to him.
[1:07:44] Get to him. No matter what you do, get
[1:07:47] to him. I don't care what you got to
[1:07:49] fight through. Get to him. Yes, sir. I
[1:07:52] don't care who's in your way. Get to
[1:07:53] him. Amen.
[1:07:57] She fought her way. She might have just
[1:08:00] barely got to him, but when she reached
[1:08:03] out
[1:08:05] and she found the hem of his garment and
[1:08:08] reached and grabbed a hold of the hem of
[1:08:09] that man's garment,
[1:08:11] y'all see him
[1:08:13] stop and all these people that are
[1:08:16] pushing up against him, fighting up
[1:08:18] against him and wanting touches and
[1:08:20] wanting all these things. There was this
[1:08:22] little lady with a promise of
[1:08:24] God and he
[1:08:26] stopped. He said, "Who touched me?
[1:08:29] Virtue is left out of me." He said, "Who
[1:08:31] touched me?" I wanted him to say that. I
[1:08:33] wanted to say, "Who touched me?" I
[1:08:35] wanted to turn around and look at me and
[1:08:37] be like, "Oh, you touched me. Let me
[1:08:39] give you a little blessing." I want him
[1:08:41] to turn. I want him to reach and pick me
[1:08:43] up. I want him to put me on a higher
[1:08:45] ground. I want him to heal me. I want
[1:08:47] him to save me. I want him to fill me.
[1:08:49] That's what I want.
[1:08:52] Amen. It's time to get to the heel of
[1:08:54] his garment.
[1:08:56] You might could just crawl your way. Get
[1:08:58] there. You
[1:09:00] You might not can walk, but get there.
[1:09:03] You might not can move, but get there.
[1:09:05] Get there.
[1:09:08] It's time to get to him. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:11] Lift up your eyes. I don't care where he
[1:09:13] goes. There you go. Lift up your eyes.
[1:09:16] That's your promise. walking down the
[1:09:18] dusty road. That little song, there's a
[1:09:20] promise coming down the dusty road. That
[1:09:22] little girl was laying there dead, but
[1:09:24] her promise was coming down the dusty
[1:09:26] road.
[1:09:29] It's time sometimes for a dusty road
[1:09:31] experience. Oh, glory. We got a dusty
[1:09:35] road right there. My promise is coming
[1:09:37] down the dusty road. Oh, and hallelujah.
[1:09:40] Here comes my promise. I'm going to
[1:09:42] watch him the whole way. I'm going to
[1:09:43] see where he goes. I'm going to see how
[1:09:45] he does it. And I'm gonna get right up
[1:09:47] next to him. I'm gonna get right up
[1:09:49] there with him.
[1:09:52] I'm gonna get as close as I can to him.
[1:09:55] I'll be like, "Lord, you remember that
[1:09:56] promise you gave me? Lord, do you
[1:09:58] remember that promise? Lord, do you
[1:09:59] remember that promise? Lord, do you
[1:10:01] remember that promise?" I'm going to bug
[1:10:03] the daylights out of him.
[1:10:06] Too many times we don't want to bug him.
[1:10:08] We're like, "Oh, well, well, God can't."
[1:10:10] Well, I know God. I know God, you can do
[1:10:12] it. But but that's the worst word in the
[1:10:16] English language. Come on.
[1:10:19] I know. I know. I know God
[1:10:22] that. Don't come Don't Don't sell me
[1:10:25] that.
[1:10:27] Don't Don't sell this church that. Don't
[1:10:29] give that to me. I've seen him in
[1:10:31] action. I've lifted up my eyes and I've
[1:10:35] seen my Lord. Amen. I know I get in
[1:10:37] trouble for talking about this all the
[1:10:39] time, but I saw the dead raised. Amen.
[1:10:43] I saw in my own eyes. Hallelujah. I saw
[1:10:46] God move up on people. I saw him deliver
[1:10:49] people. They could talk about it in a
[1:10:51] Baptist church all they want. But I am
[1:10:53] living it.
[1:10:55] I want to live it. You can talk about it
[1:10:58] all day, but let me live it. Let me get
[1:11:01] it inside of me. Let me get it so down
[1:11:03] inside of me that it burns everything
[1:11:05] out. Let it burn inside of me that I can
[1:11:08] walk up to somebody and I can hand them
[1:11:10] a little bit of my fire. I can say, "You
[1:11:12] know what? Here's some of my fire you
[1:11:14] can take in because there is enough of
[1:11:16] it for all of us. There's enough of it
[1:11:18] for everybody in the building. We can go
[1:11:20] pass it down on the street somewhere."
[1:11:24] Amen. Do you realize how quick
[1:11:26] Christianity went to moving when it
[1:11:28] moved?
[1:11:33] You think about how the God does things.
[1:11:37] You might wonder how God does things or
[1:11:39] why he does things the way he does them.
[1:11:41] Why? Why Rome? Why
[1:11:45] there? You realize that Rome was one of
[1:11:48] the first the first civilizations to
[1:11:51] create a road system.
[1:11:55] You want the gospel to move? That'll
[1:11:58] move it.
[1:12:00] So Paul is going and ministering along
[1:12:03] the world around that part of the world
[1:12:05] and he's reaching people he never could
[1:12:07] before because it'll have took 10 days
[1:12:09] to get where it only took a day. They
[1:12:12] had to go through mountains and rivers
[1:12:13] and streams but Rome started Rome paved
[1:12:16] the way for Christianity. They didn't
[1:12:18] know what they were doing. They had no
[1:12:20] idea what they were doing but they were
[1:12:22] paving the way for Christianity to move
[1:12:24] forward. and they think they've got it
[1:12:27] figured out. They ain't got it figured
[1:12:30] out. They just a tool that they just a
[1:12:32] tool that God's using. That's all they
[1:12:34] were. They're just a tool to get
[1:12:36] Christianity out there. It was just a
[1:12:38] tool to get to get a church raised up in
[1:12:41] Black Rock, Arkansas. That's all it was.
[1:12:44] Amen.
[1:12:46] There's no fear there. We don't fear
[1:12:48] that Catholic Church. We don't fear
[1:12:50] that.
[1:12:53] Catholicism. You know, one of the
[1:12:55] priests went to talking to somebody and
[1:12:57] he said,
[1:12:59] uh, he said, "No longer can we say
[1:13:01] silver and gold have I none." And that
[1:13:04] old preacher looked at him. He went, "No
[1:13:06] longer can you say take up thy bed and
[1:13:08] walk either."
[1:13:11] Amen. I thank God we have a promise. I
[1:13:14] thank God that we can look and we can
[1:13:16] see. I thank God that the darkness is
[1:13:18] coming to or the light is coming to our
[1:13:20] darkness.
[1:13:25] He answered and said unto them, because
[1:13:28] it given unto you to know the mysteries
[1:13:30] of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
[1:13:33] is not given. But blessed are your eyes,
[1:13:36] for they see, and your ears, for they
[1:13:39] hear. For verily I say unto you, that
[1:13:42] many prophets and righteous men have
[1:13:45] desired to see those things which you
[1:13:46] see and have not seen them. and to hear
[1:13:49] those things which you hear and have not
[1:13:52] heard them. Brother Ram says, "Look what
[1:13:55] we've seen in this day. The quickening
[1:13:57] power has come to us to open the seven
[1:13:59] seals." What was that? The intelligence
[1:14:02] of a man. No, the quickening power of
[1:14:05] God. See, the quickening power of God
[1:14:09] foretold this would take place. The
[1:14:11] quickening power of God made the world
[1:14:14] testify to it. It's the truth. Yes, sir.
[1:14:17] The angel of the Lord I told you was
[1:14:18] around in a pillar of fire quickening
[1:14:21] power. Let the world testify that it's
[1:14:23] the truth. And in that they didn't know
[1:14:25] what it was. And we knew just look this
[1:14:29] away and it's our Lord up there. You see
[1:14:33] he's speaking of the the cloud. They
[1:14:36] didn't know what it was. The man took
[1:14:37] the picture. They didn't know what it
[1:14:39] was. But when that prophet got a hold of
[1:14:42] that and he turned that picture to the
[1:14:44] right and there was the Lord. I'm
[1:14:46] pointing to something that's not
[1:14:48] there and there was the Lord. The Lord
[1:14:52] was up there.
[1:14:54] Amen. It was judgment to the world. But
[1:14:56] what was it to the bride? It wasn't
[1:14:58] judgment. It was showing you who you
[1:15:01] are. It was showing you what you could
[1:15:03] be. It's showing you how you can defeat
[1:15:05] every devil, every spirit, every enemy.
[1:15:08] That's what it was showing you.
[1:15:10] It was a message. It was saying you can
[1:15:13] live. You don't have to die. You can
[1:15:15] live. You don't have to suffer. You can
[1:15:17] live. You can rest. Hallelujah.
[1:15:24] Amen. Look
[1:15:26] up and you will see. Lift up your
[1:15:31] eyes. Amen. Do you love the Lord? Amen.
[1:15:35] It's time to lift up our eyes and see
[1:15:38] the glory of the Lord. Amen.
[1:15:41] Amen. Few brothers, y'all want to come
[1:15:44] to the music.
[1:15:46] Amen. The things that we have seen, the
[1:15:49] light that has been given to
[1:15:51] us, people have prodded at it and poked
[1:15:54] at it. They didn't know what it was. But
[1:15:58] when the light of God struck it, when
[1:16:01] that when that struck this
[1:16:04] word, it started changing people's
[1:16:07] lives.
[1:16:09] What it did was it started taking people
[1:16:12] that were living in addictions,
[1:16:14] turning their lives around and it
[1:16:17] started taking family uh uh generational
[1:16:21] curses and people that that battled with
[1:16:24] with diseases and battle with addictions
[1:16:26] and and all this thing with the message
[1:16:28] got a hold of them and it turned their
[1:16:31] life around.
[1:16:33] Everybody around them, their whole
[1:16:34] family might be addicts. Their whole
[1:16:37] family might have struggled with things.
[1:16:38] Their whole family might have anxiety,
[1:16:40] but they could look to that woman and be
[1:16:42] like, "What in the world has happened to
[1:16:43] you?" They looked at little Paige and
[1:16:46] they said, "What has happened to you,
[1:16:47] Paige?" And she said, "I met my promise.
[1:16:51] That's what I met David." Oh, you met
[1:16:53] your promise. You met him. You come down
[1:16:56] the dusty road and he come and found
[1:16:58] you.
[1:16:59] You met him.
[1:17:02] I met that promise one day. Amen. And he
[1:17:06] picked me up and he put me on solid
[1:17:08] ground where I was sinking in sin. I
[1:17:12] didn't know where to go. Didn't know
[1:17:13] what to do. But there was my promise and
[1:17:16] reach down and he took a hold of my
[1:17:19] hand. And all the pain and all the hurt
[1:17:22] that I'd been
[1:17:23] through. All the sickness and all the
[1:17:25] things that I've battled, it was over.
[1:17:30] Are there still battles?
[1:17:33] There's battles every
[1:17:34] day. I've got I work
[1:17:38] with I see people in education that
[1:17:41] they're all the time talking about the
[1:17:42] kids and how the things that they they
[1:17:45] you know I they I mean I've heard this
[1:17:46] and I'm not saying this to be a joke or
[1:17:49] in all seriousness that they would
[1:17:51] literally tell me I had to go take an
[1:17:53] anxiety pill because I can't handle
[1:17:55] these
[1:17:56] kids. They would say these things and
[1:17:58] I'm sitting there thinking, so well,
[1:18:00] I've got a higher power. I've got a
[1:18:03] promise inside of me that I know that
[1:18:06] there's a child sitting there that I can
[1:18:08] speak to. I may not be able to just
[1:18:09] spill it all out to them, but there's
[1:18:11] somebody in front of me. I don't need an
[1:18:13] anxiety pill. I've got Jesus. I don't
[1:18:16] need a Xanax. I've got Jesus. I don't
[1:18:18] need alcohol. I've got Jesus. I don't
[1:18:21] need drugs. I've got Jesus.
[1:18:24] Hallelujah.
[1:18:27] Some people might be like, "Well, well,
[1:18:29] you know, y'all don't have a lot of
[1:18:31] fun." Hey, you ever been drunk on the
[1:18:33] gospel?
[1:18:36] Been there. Amen.
[1:18:40] Been right in the middle of brother Matt
[1:18:42] got a little happy the other day. Got up
[1:18:44] here and got to dancing. You don't think
[1:18:45] he was having fun, man? It don't have to
[1:18:48] be some somber quiet thing that the
[1:18:50] world has made it out to be. And
[1:18:51] sometimes it's a time to dance.
[1:18:53] Sometimes it's a time to just kick up
[1:18:55] your heels a little bit. Brother Matt
[1:18:57] said, you know, you can let your hair
[1:18:58] down. Some of you can't. I can't.
[1:19:04] Amen. But sometimes you can just say
[1:19:07] glory. Sometimes you can say hallelujah.
[1:19:09] Sometimes you can stand there and cry.
[1:19:11] Sometimes you could stand there and
[1:19:13] worship the Lord. But your promise is
[1:19:15] here.
[1:19:17] Your promise does not hold you down and
[1:19:19] contain you to some idea or re or or
[1:19:21] reform of man. But your promise is
[1:19:24] standing here saying, "Feel free to
[1:19:25] worship me. Feel free to do what you see
[1:19:28] fit.
[1:19:30] Just feel free. Feel free to worship the
[1:19:33] Lord. Feel free to give a little shout
[1:19:36] every now and again. Just feel free.
[1:19:38] Feel free to say hallelujah."
[1:19:41] Amen. And I remember when few years ago
[1:19:43] when that when I first started uh uh
[1:19:46] serving the Lord, I always thought that
[1:19:47] that was a little I don't know backwards
[1:19:50] I guess for lack of a better phrase. And
[1:19:53] I thought that I thought well I won't
[1:19:54] you know I couldn't really say
[1:19:56] hallelujah much. Couldn't say glory.
[1:19:59] Just kind of tried to hold it in. And
[1:20:01] then one day something come over me and
[1:20:03] I said hallelujah. And I ain't stopped
[1:20:05] since. I could say glory to God. Thank
[1:20:08] you Lord for all you've done. Thank you
[1:20:10] for delivering me. Thank you for healing
[1:20:12] me. I can say hallelujah. And I don't
[1:20:14] care who sees me. I don't care who hears
[1:20:16] me.
[1:20:20] Amen. I remember sitting in a and I
[1:20:22] remember a lot, I guess. But I was in my
[1:20:25] uh at Williams Baptist and I'm sitting
[1:20:26] in we had to do chapel. They made us do
[1:20:28] that. I'm sitting in the back and this
[1:20:31] this preacher got up there and he got to
[1:20:33] preaching a little bit good and I was I
[1:20:35] said, "Amen." And the girl behind me,
[1:20:37] he's like, "What what are you?" She got
[1:20:39] on to me later. She was in class with me
[1:20:40] and she went, "We don't I'm just like a
[1:20:42] backro Baptist. We don't do that around
[1:20:45] here." I was like,
[1:20:47] "Okay, well,
[1:20:50] whatever. I'm not I don't want to be
[1:20:52] dried up. I don't want to be all stick
[1:20:54] in the mud. Come on. I don't want to.
[1:20:59] I know sometimes the circumstances kind
[1:21:00] of hold you down, but if you get a hold
[1:21:03] of the promise, all that goes away.
[1:21:05] Amen. You don't the promise, you ain't
[1:21:07] got to worry about it. Get a hold to the
[1:21:10] promise. Lift up your eyes and see the
[1:21:12] glory of the Lord. Lift up your eyes and
[1:21:15] see what he's doing in your life. Don't
[1:21:17] look down. Abraham wasn't looking down.
[1:21:20] He was looking up. He was looking at
[1:21:22] what God was doing. He was looking at
[1:21:23] how God was moving. Lift up your eyes,
[1:21:26] church, and see the glory of the Lord.
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:30] Amen. And brother Matt, you better come.
[1:21:37] Yeah. Come on.
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:48] I say this joy that I
[1:21:52] had, the world didn't give it to me. I
[1:21:56] know this joy that I
[1:22:00] had. The world didn't give it to me.
[1:22:04] where the world didn't give it. Won't
[1:22:07] you stand to your feet tonight?
[1:22:10] Oh, I say this love that I

[1:29:29] praise. Amen. That young lady wanted to
[1:29:32] give her heart to the Lord. She said,
[1:29:33] "I'm tired of living in darkness and I
[1:29:35] believe God spoke to me tonight. I want
[1:29:37] to have the light of God in my life." I
[1:29:39] think I can't think of a testimony I'd
[1:29:41] rather have that have a desire for the
[1:29:43] light of God to come into my life. How
[1:29:46] many has that desire? Let me tell you
[1:29:48] what happens when you start holding to
[1:29:49] your promise. It call it draws the Holy
[1:29:52] Spirit into your life. Brother Brandon
[1:29:54] preached a message called God is in
[1:29:56] simplicity in 1963. And in that message
[1:29:59] he said that light that Holy Spirit that
[1:30:01] light is moving around this building and
[1:30:04] it is searching for somebody. It's
[1:30:06] looking for somebody that will accept
[1:30:08] it. It It's hunting somebody that will
[1:30:11] open up and let it in. And he said, "You
[1:30:13] know what you do? You just lift your
[1:30:15] hands and you start praising God." And
[1:30:17] you when you begin to worship God and
[1:30:19] let that light of God come into your
[1:30:21] life and you say to God, "Lord, I'm
[1:30:23] holding to the promise. You gave the
[1:30:25] promise. I believe it and I'm holding on
[1:30:27] to it tonight." And that wasn't just for
[1:30:29] some other day. He preached that message
[1:30:31] 62 years ago almost to the day. But it
[1:30:34] wasn't just for them. It's for you
[1:30:36] tonight if you'll lift your hands and
[1:30:38] start praising God and say, "God, you
[1:30:40] gave the promise and I'm going to hold
[1:30:42] on to it. And I'm expecting you to
[1:30:44] fulfill it." And that same light of the
[1:30:46] Holy Spirit that was moving in that day
[1:30:48] is moving today and it'll fill every
[1:30:50] heart and every life in this place. Do
[1:30:52] you believe that tonight? The same
[1:30:54] promise of God to fulfill every desire
[1:30:57] in your heart. I believe that God is a
[1:30:59] God that's moving in our midst. Hey, how
[1:31:01] many believe that tonight? How many
[1:31:03] going to lift their hands? Won't you
[1:31:04] just worship the Lord
[1:31:05] tonight? Every
[1:31:08] praise, every praise is to my God. Can
[1:31:12] you worship the Lord? I say, every
[1:31:15] praise is to our God. Every word of

[1:34:52] just sends the right word at the right
[1:34:54] time to bring us into the right place
[1:34:56] and let the light strike the seed and

[1:36:42] Gracious heavenly father. Lord, how
[1:36:45] privileged that we are,
[1:36:47] Lord. God, to be able to
[1:36:50] witness, Lord, a a little daughter of
[1:36:53] yours, Lord. God, to witness the cause.
[1:36:56] Our brother was preaching on those that
[1:37:00] was leaving out of Egypt that day and
[1:37:02] crossing over the Red Sea and how that
[1:37:05] they witnessed the waters roll back and
[1:37:08] the dry ground beneath their feet. Lord,
[1:37:12] I thought it didn't matter how old they
[1:37:14] were or what their level of experience
[1:37:17] was. Every child, they walked across the
[1:37:19] same dry ground.
[1:37:21] every mother, every father, they walked
[1:37:23] the same path to the same
[1:37:26] testimony. Lord, they the feeble, the
[1:37:28] strong, it didn't matter how how they
[1:37:30] were, Lord. But God, every one of them
[1:37:33] sharing the same testimony. And Lord, I
[1:37:36] thank you, Lord, for giving us a pathway
[1:37:37] to walk. And Lord, I thank you for our
[1:37:40] sister, Lord, putting the zeal on her
[1:37:42] heart to serve you. And Lord, I pray,
[1:37:44] Lord, that you would encourage her. No
[1:37:45] doubt how the enemy would attack her
[1:37:47] mind and body, Lord. But here she made a
[1:37:50] decision tonight, Lord, to stand upon
[1:37:52] thy word, Lord. I pray, Lord, that you
[1:37:54] would fill her so filled with your
[1:37:56] spirit, Lord. Let her be able to have
[1:37:58] such a desire in her heart to serve you,
[1:38:00] Lord. God, to feed upon thy word, Lord.
[1:38:02] May that great light of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:05] overshadow her, Lord. God, I just ask
[1:38:07] you, Lord, that you would go with each
[1:38:08] one as we go from this place, God,
[1:38:11] knowing that each one of us has walked
[1:38:12] that same walk, Lord. We've walked the
[1:38:14] same path to the same testimony. And
[1:38:17] Lord, I ask you, Lord, to be an
[1:38:18] encouragement to her. And Lord, each one
[1:38:20] as we go from this place, encourage our
[1:38:22] brother. Lord, I thank you for allowing
[1:38:24] him to speak to us tonight. Lord, we
[1:38:26] just give you the glory, Lord, for all
[1:38:28] that's done. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:38:31] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight
[1:38:35] as you go.
[1:38:39] Well, I'd
[1:38:41] rather have
[1:38:44] Jesus than

[1:38:54] his than have
[1:38:57] riches untold.
[1:39:01] I'd

[1:39:11] And I'd
[1:39:13] rather be
[1:39:15] led by his
[1:39:21] nail than to

[1:39:31] domain and be held.
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:41] way. I would
[1:39:44] rather have
[1:39:47] Jesus than
[1:39:51] anything that this
[1:39:54] world
[1:39:56] affords today.
[1:40:02] Well, I'd
[1:40:04] rather have
[1:40:06] Jesus than
[1:40:09] silver or

[1:40:16] his than have
[1:40:19] riches
[1:40:21] untold. Hell, I'd

[1:40:31] land. I would
[1:40:34] rather be led by his
[1:40:39] nail pierced
[1:40:41] hands than to
[1:40:44] be a
[1:40:46] king of a
[1:40:49] vast domain.

[1:41:10] anything than this
[1:41:13] world
[1:41:15] affords today. God bless you tonight.
[1:41:20] Oh, I would
[1:41:22] rather have
[1:41:25] Jesus than
[1:41:27] worldly
[1:41:29] applause. I would
[1:41:32] rather be
[1:41:34] faithful to his dear
[1:41:39] cross. I'd
[1:41:41] rather have
[1:41:44] Jesus than
[1:41:46] worldwide fame.
[1:41:50] I'd rather be
[1:41:53] true to his
[1:41:55] holy
[1:41:57] name than to
[1:42:00] be a
[1:42:02] king of a
[1:42:05] vast
[1:42:07] domain and be
[1:42:10] held in
[1:42:11] sin dread sway.
[1:42:17] Yes, I would
[1:42:19] rather have
[1:42:21] Jesus than
[1:42:25] anything this whole
[1:42:28] world affords.
