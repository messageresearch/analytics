[0:02] God bless you. Turn around. Wait for the
[0:05] God bless you. The little girl with
[0:07] tremendous faith be well. God bless you,
[0:11] honey. Go. You're right. Do you believe
[0:13] me as his prophet, his servant? Do you
[0:17] believe that God is near and his spirit
[0:20] and this which is now being done is of
[0:22] the Lord Jesus, not me. I'm a man. Yeah.
[0:26] If God will let me know what's wrong
[0:28] with you as a vindication that I am his
[0:30] prophet standing here revealing the
[0:32] truth. As he said to the woman, "Go get
[0:34] your husband." She said, "I have none."
[0:36] He said, "You have five." She said, "I
[0:38] see you're a prophet." See, I perceive
[0:41] that you're a prophet. Now, that same
[0:43] spirit that was on that son of God, he
[0:46] promised to send it back in the form of
[0:48] the Holy Ghost that would be with us and
[0:50] dwell with us to the end of the world.
[0:51] You believe it?
[0:52] &gt;&gt; If he can know your troubles now, can
[0:54] he? You got heart trouble. Is that
[0:57] right? Every person with heart trouble,
[0:58] stand to your feet. You can be healed
[1:01] right now. No matter what it is of the
[1:03] heart trouble. Lord God, thou knowest
[1:06] our strength and how feeble we are and
[1:09] how weak. But Lord, we know how strong
[1:12] you are. And heart trouble is something
[1:14] our doctors cannot do anything by. But
[1:16] Lord, who made the heart? You did. And I
[1:19] now rebuke this demon power that's
[1:22] holding these people to heart trouble.
[1:23] May he come out of every one of them in
[1:25] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[1:28] bless you, sister. I just want to say
[1:30] something to you. You feel different now
[1:32] than you felt in a long time, have you?
[1:34] I so the people know this is a real dark
[1:37] spirit. You had bad stuff when you lay
[1:39] down. And now it's gone from you. You're
[1:43] healed. You I just told Yes, sir. You
[1:46] are all right. How do you do, sir? All
[1:50] right. us being strangers one to
[1:52] another. But the Lord Jesus knows us
[1:53] both. Is that right? The God of heaven
[1:56] who created the heavens and earth dwelt
[1:58] in Jesus Christ promised to return again
[2:01] in us. And what he done we do also. Do
[2:04] you believe me to be his prophet? The
[2:06] reason I say that the angel of the Lord
[2:08] told me, get the people to believe you.
[2:11] And if they won't believe you, then
[2:12] you'll know the very secrets of their
[2:13] heart and they'll have to believe it
[2:15] then. But you do believe me. And besides
[2:18] the reason that you do believe me, you
[2:20] are a minister of the gospel yourself.
[2:23] And you're here for a good cause. You're
[2:25] not sick. You're in need. And you want
[2:27] an oldfashioned revival to break in your
[2:28] community. Lord,
[2:29] &gt;&gt; that's what you're
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Every one of us wants that. Let's all
[2:34] stand for an oldfashioned revival.
[2:37] Almighty God has created the heavens and
[2:40] earth. I ask now that every demon's
[2:43] power in this building will be broke.
[2:45] The power of Jesus Christ be made
[2:47] manifest. Lord, weak, but we're not
[2:51] defeated. Satan, Iure thee in the name
[2:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Come out of
[2:57] the people. Stand up, you
[2:59] people, out of the wheelchairs. Give him
[3:01] praise. Every one of them.
[3:05] [Applause]
[3:08] Hallelujah.
[3:11] [Music]
[3:15] And if God will just reveal to me what
[3:17] is wrong with you, would you accept him
[3:20] as your healer? You would. Now, we are
[3:24] strangers, I suppose. Aren't we? Never
[3:26] seen each other in life nowhere.
[3:29] But God knows what's wrong with you.
[3:30] Isn't that right?
[3:33] You're one of your greatest saints.
[3:34] You're an enemy also. Isn't that right?
[3:37] You believe that God will make you well.
[3:40] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the
[3:43] woman. Make her well. Father, may she go
[3:46] from here tonight and be made completely
[3:48] whole. In Jesus Christ's name, I ask it.
[3:51] Amen. Now, go
[3:54] rejoicing, pray. Now, that's according
[3:56] to your faith, sister. See, he never
[3:58] told me one thing. Just said what was
[4:00] wrong with you. Watch what he says. See
[4:02] what he tells you that you do. Now,
[4:04] that's totally up to you. See, you
[4:06] believe it. You said you'd accept it.
[4:08] and he talk at your word. You take him
[4:10] at his word. Go testify the same. You'll
[4:12] get wet. Amen. Let's say thanks be to
[4:16] God.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God.
[4:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:20] Now, we are these strangers. I see that
[4:22] you are strictly a stranger to me.
[4:26] You're from away from here. You come
[4:28] from another city.
[4:31] You've got a lot of trouble on your
[4:33] heart. You got hard trouble to begin
[4:35] with. Is that right?
[4:38] There's a whole lot of blackness. I see
[4:39] a black sheep keep following you like
[4:41] that. Or it's a lie. Somebody's pulled a
[4:44] lie on you. And that was a man was
[4:46] professing divine healing. Yes, sir.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; He said you was a witch. Is that true?
[4:51] And you got a whole stir in your church
[4:53] or something about it. Isn't that right?
[4:55] Your pastor's sick right now. He's got
[4:56] polio. Is that right, sister? Don't pay
[5:00] no attention to what them people tell
[5:01] you. They're lying. And the only thing
[5:03] wrong with your heart is that nervous
[5:04] condition got your heart worked up. Go
[5:06] on home in peace and God bless you.
[5:08] You're all right. God bless you. You're
[5:10] not all right.
[5:13] You believe with all your heart. Believe
[5:15] God will heal you. Let that leave you.
[5:17] Make you well.
[5:19] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the
[5:21] woman and may she get completely whole.
[5:24] I ask this blessing in Jesus Christ's
[5:26] name. Amen. Go on your road rejoicing,
[5:28] saying, "Thank you, Lord." And you'll
[5:30] get welcome. Come, lady. Almighty God,
[5:33] author of life, give this woman her
[5:35] perfect health in Jesus Christ's name.
[5:37] Amen. God bless you. Just a minute.
[5:41] Something happened to you. You know
[5:42] that. You're aware of that. Is that
[5:44] right? Wiped all over the building. And
[5:47] every person here could be healed right
[5:48] now if you'd believe it.
[5:51] You believe this?
[5:53] Have faith in God.
[5:56] Are you one of the ushers, sir? All
[5:58] right, sir.
[6:00] That lady sitting right there got heart
[6:03] trouble. That speckled dress on. Stand
[6:04] up, lady. You just healed you. They have
[6:06] that heart trouble. You believe that
[6:08] with all your heart?
[6:10] All right. There's a lady there with her
[6:12] handkerchief up crying. Just had a lick
[6:14] on the head the other day. She's got a
[6:16] headache. It's causing it. Is that
[6:18] right? Stand up and accept your healing
[6:19] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. How many
[6:23] of the rest of you want to accept your
[6:24] healing? Jesus Christ is right here now
[6:26] to heal you. Do you believe that? All
[6:28] that wants to be healed, stand to your
[6:30] feet right now. Every person in the
[6:32] building who wants to be healed, stand
[6:33] to your feet.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands like this to God.
[6:37] Almighty God, the author of life, the
[6:40] giver of every good gift. As our spirit
[6:42] is here tonight, I pray that you'll heal
[6:45] every person in this building, thou art
[6:48] here, the Holy Spirit is here. And I now
[6:52] as your servant along with these other
[6:54] servants curse every disease in the ear.
[6:56] May the Jesus Christ the son of God heal
[6:59] every person in here. Satan leave these
[7:02] people in Jesus Christ's name. Now let
[7:05] the people got their hands up say praise
[7:07] God and go to rejoicing giving God. All
[7:10] right.
[8:06] Nothing like the presence.
[8:10] Nothing like the presence.
[8:14] There's nothing like the presence of the
[8:18] Lord.

[12:13] will because he's been here the last two
[12:15] services and I know he'll show up and

[12:20] a word of prayer? Certainly good to be h

[12:23] all of our visitors. We welcome you.
[12:25] Those on the live stream just ask that

[12:28] Bless you.
[12:31] We bow our hearts.

[12:39] Lord, we know you're present, Lord.
[12:43] Lord, that we could enter in, Lord
[12:45] Jesus. Father, you said you inhabit the
[12:48] praises of your people, Lord. Father
[12:51] God, and you have set this people free,
[12:53] Lord. Father, you broke every chain,
[12:56] Lord God. Lord God, you broke every
[12:59] feeder, Lord God, that would bind us,
[13:02] Lord. So I know we're free, Lord. And I
[13:05] know that who you have set free is free
[13:07] indeed, Lord. So we gather together
[13:10] tonight, Lord. Father, and we lift up
[13:13] holy hands unto you, Lord, that you
[13:17] would be so pleased, Father God, to come

[13:33] expectations of what you will do, Lord.
[13:37] But I pray tonight, Lord, that we meet
[13:39] your expectations, Father. Lord, that
[13:42] our hearts would just open up, Lord, and
[13:45] give way unto you, Lord. Father God,
[13:48] just cover us tonight, Lord. Father,
[13:51] pour yourself out upon us, Lord. Be so
[13:54] pleased in our worship. Be so pleased in
[13:58] the word, Lord. Father God, I'm asking
[14:00] it, Lord. And you said, "Whatever we ask
[14:02] in your name, it shall be given, Lord."
[14:05] That is the promise of your word and I
[14:08] know it shall be fulfilled in the name
[14:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, amen.
[14:16] Amen. You may have your seats tonight.
[14:18] Certainly good to be gathered once
[14:20] again.
[14:21] Just a couple announcements. Uh the
[14:23] bathrooms are up in the church. Just
[14:25] walk in the front doors to the right.
[14:27] Men's and women's are both are on that
[14:29] side. So if you need the restrooms,
[14:30] they're over there. Um after the service
[14:32] tonight, we will be having a meal
[14:33] tonight. And then tomorrow night and
[14:35] Sundays, we will be also providing a
[14:37] meal. So we just have those that we can
[14:39] have fellowship after the word tonight.
[14:41] So I would not be denied. I would be
[14:44] denied. He talked about Caleb last night
[14:46] looking over into the promised land and
[14:48] seeing that inheritance that was his.
[14:50] And Caleb didn't know how long it would
[14:51] take, but he was persevering that no
[14:53] matter what how how long it was going to
[14:55] take, no matter what he had to do, but
[14:56] he was going to get to that promise
[14:57] tonight. So if you have a need tonight,
[14:59] desire of your heart, just keep pressing
[15:01] on and say, "Lord, I'm not going to
[15:02] leave until you bless me tonight." Oh,
[15:05] when pains of death cease on my soul,
[15:10] poto the Lord, I cry
[15:14] until my Jesus came and he made me
[15:19] whole. I would not be.
[15:24] Oh yes, I would not be enough.
[15:29] I know I would not be denied
[15:35] until my Jesus came and he made me
[15:39] whole. I would not be high.
[15:45] Well, as Jacob in the days of old, I
[15:51] wrestled with the Lord.
[15:55] Oh, and instead with the courage,
[16:00] I stood upon God's word.
[16:05] Oh yes, I would not be denied.
[16:10] Oh no, I would not be denied.
[16:15] until my Jesus came and he made me
[16:19] whole. I would not be. Oh, I like this
[16:24] verse. You see, oh, Satan said that my
[16:28] Lord, he was gone and would not hear my
[16:33] Oh, but I got good news tonight. Oh,
[16:36] praise the Lord. The word is done and
[16:41] Christ the Lord he is here.
[16:45] Oh yes I would not be denied.
[16:50] Oh no I would not be denied
[16:55] until my Jesus came and he made me
[17:00] whole. Oh let's sing that third verse
[17:02] once more.
[17:05] You see, oh Satan said that my Lord was
[17:10] gone and would not hear my prayer.
[17:15] Oh, but praise the Lord. The work is
[17:20] done and Christ the Lord is here.
[17:25] I know I would not be denied.
[17:30] Oh yes, I would not be denied.
[17:35] till my Jesus came and he made me whole.
[17:41] I would Oh, sing it again now.
[17:45] Oh yes, I would not be denied.
[17:50] Oh no, I would not be denied
[17:55] until my Jesus came and he made me
[18:00] whole. I would not be redeemed.

[23:42] and pray with the offer?

[24:08] in mind.

[24:23] and live on forever more. Everybody will
[24:27] be happy over you.

[43:06] we have a promise coming. Amen. Where
[43:10] two or three are gathered together in my
[43:12] name, there shall I be in the midst of
[43:13] them. How do you know God's going to
[43:15] show up in the meeting because we have a
[43:16] promise?
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We made a way according to the
[43:21] word of God. Amen. How many's looking
[43:23] forward to an outpouring of the Holy
[43:24] Ghost? Amen. How many's enjoyed the
[43:27] meeting so far? Amen. Hadn't it? Yeah.
[43:29] Go ahead. It's all right. Give the Lord
[43:31] some praise. Amen.
[43:34] Amen. I think we ought to praise the
[43:37] Lord more anyhow. Amen. If he's been
[43:40] real good to you, you give him a little
[43:42] hand clap of praise. But if he's been a
[43:45] big God to you, give him a great big
[43:46] hand clap of praise. Amen. He's a great
[43:49] big God.
[43:51] He's done so much for us, we could write
[43:53] books about it. He never failed us. He
[43:56] never forsook us when we were lost and
[43:59] gone astray. But he came looking for us
[44:02] because you belong to him
[44:04] &gt;&gt; and he said, "I've never lost a one and
[44:06] he deserves our praise." You love the
[44:08] Lord tonight.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; It's been good to be in the meetings and
[44:11] certainly appreciate these brothers.
[44:13] such a wonderful uh ministry that has
[44:16] came to speak and sure enjoyed brother
[44:19] Andrew uh opening up the meeting and
[44:21] just such a faith-building message about
[44:24] the soldiers in God's army and and how
[44:27] that we have the greatest weapon that
[44:29] there is that God has given us to battle
[44:32] whatever it is that we come in contact
[44:33] with. And brother Jonathan came behind
[44:36] him last night and preached another
[44:38] great faith-building message. And I love
[44:40] that. I thought that quote was so
[44:42] powerful tonight. Tonight I thought I'd
[44:43] read it. He said Jesus showed his human
[44:46] parts. He wept with those who wept. He
[44:48] laughed with those who laughed and he's
[44:50] in victory that with those who is in
[44:52] victory. So let's just keep him in
[44:55] victory.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are we're in How many's in
[44:58] victory tonight? Amen. Let's just keep
[45:00] him in victory. I believe he knows what
[45:02] we have need of here. That God has been
[45:04] building our faith for two nights in a
[45:06] row. He's been building our faith. And
[45:07] the Bible says, "For whatsoever is born
[45:09] of God overcomemeth the world." And this
[45:11] is the victory that overcometh the
[45:13] world, even our faith. God has given us
[45:16] a faith to overcome everything that we
[45:19] have need of tonight. I know that's what
[45:20] it takes. It takes faith to have
[45:22] victory. So, we come tonight with a How
[45:24] many How many have faith tonight to
[45:26] believe that God is more than able uh to
[45:28] do abundantly more than we could ever
[45:30] ask or think? Do you ever think of that?
[45:33] More than you could ever ask. More than
[45:35] you could ever think to even ask. God
[45:37] can do even abundantly more than that.
[45:39] God is such a great God. And so we come
[45:41] in expectation tonight and expecting God
[45:44] to do great things. We have uh some
[45:46] requests, prayer requests. Brother
[45:48] Herald had called uh asking for prayer.
[45:50] Wanted to be here tonight and some
[45:52] battling some sickness in his body.
[45:54] Also, we've been praying for brother
[45:56] Roy. Not sure if he was able to make it
[45:58] tonight, but no. And I just want to
[46:00] continue to remember him in prayer and
[46:02] also uh Jordan. And she was in the
[46:05] hospital last night to about 8:00 this
[46:07] morning. And uh but today she was
[46:09] feeling a lot better today. So I just
[46:11] want to continue to lift her in prayer.
[46:13] And I know that God certainly knows all
[46:17] of our heart and all of our needs. So uh
[46:19] maybe if you have a need, won't you just
[46:21] lift it to the Lord tonight? And and
[46:23] brother Dave, could you come? Maggar,
[46:24] would you want to pray over these
[46:26] requests for us tonight? And and we
[46:28] certainly want to allow God to have his
[46:31] liberty in the meeting. And and I
[46:34] believe he's more than able to meet our
[46:35] needs. Amen. So, won't we just call upon
[46:38] him today?
[46:40] Let's bow our hearts.
[46:46] Heavenly Father,
[46:48] Lord, you're so good to us.
[46:51] Lord, I thank you for victory tonight.
[46:54] Lord, I thank you for the Bible says
[46:56] that you took the stripes that we could
[46:58] be healed. And Lord, it's good to be
[47:01] here tonight. I feel your presence,
[47:03] Lord. And as brother Matt already said,
[47:05] you promised you'd be in our midst. You
[47:06] said whether two or three was gathered
[47:08] in your name, you'd be in our midst.
[47:10] Lord, I thank you. And Lord, I pray
[47:12] tonight that Lord, you heard the
[47:14] request. You knew him before they ever
[47:16] made mention.
[47:18] Lord, I know some of them would like to
[47:20] be here tonight. But I believe you're a
[47:22] God that still moves, a God that still
[47:24] answers prayer. And Lord, I believe
[47:26] right now you could go where they're at.
[47:28] Lord, you have total deliverance for
[47:31] them. Lord, I just pray that you'd be
[47:33] with each one. Lord, I pray you'd be
[47:35] with the rest of this service. I pray
[47:37] tonight a great outpouring of the Holy
[47:39] Spirit. Lord, Lord, David said, you're a
[47:42] lifter up in my head. And Lord, tonight
[47:44] I thank you. I pray that there wouldn't
[47:46] be one leave down tonight. I pray, Lord,
[47:49] when we leave tonight, there wouldn't be
[47:50] one leave without healing. And Lord, we
[47:52] thank you. Just pray that you'd be with
[47:55] each thing that's said and done. I
[47:56] trust, Lord, it'd be for your glory.
[47:59] Lord, again, we appreciate what you've
[48:00] done for us being the rest of the
[48:02] service and we'd be careful to give you
[48:04] the praise in Jesus name. Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We honored to have brother Wayne
[48:11] here with us tonight and they come all
[48:14] the way from Ohio, him and Cararissa and
[48:17] and had some time to be able to spend
[48:19] with them and certainly been a a
[48:20] blessing. And Sister Bethy's here
[48:22] somewhere and uh if she would come, I
[48:25] think Destiny may There she is. Amen.

[53:34] to hold forever.
[53:38] You're our healer.
[53:41] You and you alone.

[53:46] &gt;&gt; All depression.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what it is that
[53:49] you have tonight. God has given us a
[53:52] promise that he'll overcome
[53:54] &gt;&gt; every sickness,
[53:55] &gt;&gt; every sickness.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You heal all addiction,
[54:03] [Music]

[54:09] over every heartache.
[54:11] Yes, for you. If you believe that God is
[54:15] going to do that tonight, won't you
[54:16] stand and sing it with us? Sing, Lord,
[54:20] you're going to be
[54:23] Jehovah forever.
[54:27] We know you will.
[54:31] You're going to do it. Not because I
[54:34] said so, but because God said so. Yes,
[54:37] Lord. You're going to do it. We know you
[54:43] will.
[54:44] I say you're going to do it. Yes, you're
[54:50] going to do it. You're going to give me
[54:53] healing for my body. You're going to
[54:55] deliver me of the the things that's been
[54:57] tormenting my life. Lord, you're going
[54:59] to help me to overcome the things I
[55:01] haven't been able to overcome. I say
[55:03] you're going to do it. Yes, you're going
[55:08] to do it. I know you will.
[55:14] Lord, I believe it.
[55:18] Yes, Lord. I believe it.

[56:11] God. Jehovah.
[56:15] Jehovah forever.
[56:19] You're my healer.
[56:22] You and you alone.
[56:26] Yes, we will trust you.
[56:30] Jehovah Rafa. How many can lift your
[56:33] hands to the Lord tonight as we prepare
[56:36] our hearts for the preaching of the word
[56:38] of God? Can you call him that? Jehovah
[56:41] Rafa with an open heart.
[56:44] Jehovah Jehovah forever.
[56:48] Won't you just invite him to come in a
[56:50] spirit of worship tonight? You and you
[56:54] alone.
[56:56] Lord, we will trust you.
[57:01] Jehovah,
[57:02] [Music]
[57:05] you're our healer.
[57:08] You and you alone.
[57:14] Lord,
[57:16] I believe.
[57:20] Oh Lord,
[57:23] I believe.
[57:27] All things
[57:29] are possible.
[57:32] Lord, I believe.
[57:38] Yes, Lord,
[57:40] I believe.
[57:43] Oh Lord,
[57:46] I believe
[57:49] all things are possible.
[57:55] Lord, I
[57:57] believe. I say only
[58:03] believe.
[58:06] Only
[58:08] believe.
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:12] All things
[58:14] are possible.
[58:17] All
[58:19] believe
[58:25] [Music]
[58:34] all things are possible. As a
[58:38] declaration of your faith tonight, won't
[58:40] you just lift your hands and say, "Lord,
[58:42] I believe." Now, only if you believe it
[58:43] now. Say, "Lord,
[58:46] I believe."
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, let this song be a confession of
[58:51] our faith tonight. Lord, I believe
[58:55] that all things are possible.
[59:00] Yes, Lord, I
[59:03] believe.
[59:06] Oh Lord,
[59:08] I believe.
[59:12] Lord,
[59:13] I believe.
[59:17] All things are awesome,
[59:22] Lord. I
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that's the declaration
[59:30] of every true believer. Amen. uh that
[59:34] believes upon our Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:36] Amen. That is the the part that he gave
[59:39] us. I remember one time a man came to
[59:42] Jesus. He said, "Lord, if thou canst
[59:44] heal my child." And the Lord said, "If
[59:47] thou can't believe, all things are
[59:50] possible." So he gave us the easy part.
[59:52] We believe and he does the work. Amen.
[59:54] And so it's certainly good to be here
[59:56] with you tonight and to get together
[59:58] under this tent tonight to be able to
[1:00:00] worship the Lord and be able to come
[1:00:02] here together to see the spirit of the
[1:00:04] Lord, get a hold of our situations and
[1:00:06] our needs. And I want to thank brother
[1:00:08] Matt and Grace Tabernacle here tonight
[1:00:11] for making these things possible. And
[1:00:13] and all of you that came out uh tonight
[1:00:15] to get under this tent to bring your
[1:00:17] lick of fire together, to be able to
[1:00:19] come and to fellowship around the great
[1:00:21] word of God. Amen. And uh it it is real
[1:00:25] honor to have Teresa with me tonight and
[1:00:26] Sister Bethany all the way down. Uh we
[1:00:29] we came down for these meetings
[1:00:31] especially and amen to be able to visit
[1:00:33] with family and it's so good to have uh
[1:00:36] some kin folk here tonight and Rosetta
[1:00:38] and Annie coming all the way in here
[1:00:40] tonight and Ruthanne and Amen just to be
[1:00:42] able to come be a part and amen we we
[1:00:44] certainly pray the Lord would give them
[1:00:46] a real blessing. Amen. and certainly uh
[1:00:49] a privilege to be able to speak tonight
[1:00:50] on the the greatness of our Lord Jesus
[1:00:53] Christ. Amen. Uh we have a couple things
[1:00:56] tonight uh on our heart and I just
[1:00:58] before we read the word, if we could
[1:00:59] just go to the Lord in a word of prayer,
[1:01:02] if you just join with me tonight.
[1:01:03] Father, we thank you tonight for this
[1:01:05] wonderful atmosphere. Lord, we thank you
[1:01:08] for this platform that's been built.
[1:01:10] Lord, a place where your word could be
[1:01:13] spoken.
[1:01:15] the people have gathered in this place
[1:01:17] tonight to glorify the name of Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ.
[1:01:22] Lord, if there's one that don't know
[1:01:24] you, we pray that the very illuminating
[1:01:26] power of God would come into the
[1:01:29] building tonight to open hearts and
[1:01:30] eyes. Lord, if there's a wayward
[1:01:33] believer, Lord, that has fell backwards
[1:01:35] and grown cold, I pray, Lord, that you
[1:01:37] would reach out into the dark, Lord, and
[1:01:40] that you would lift them to a place of
[1:01:42] fellowship. I I ask tonight for those
[1:01:44] that are sick among us, Lord. I ask that
[1:01:47] you would heal them. You would touch
[1:01:49] them. Lord, I pray tonight. Father, even
[1:01:51] maybe some watching this, I pray that
[1:01:54] your great Holy Spirit, Lord, would just
[1:01:56] reach out into that realm of the
[1:01:58] invisible that you would touch the sick
[1:02:00] and needy, Lord. For we know that you're
[1:02:02] a great and mighty healer. Now, tonight,
[1:02:05] we come to you, Father, where you said
[1:02:07] that we could come in a time of need.
[1:02:09] And we ask you, Father, upon these bases
[1:02:12] that you would come and take control of
[1:02:14] these meetings and use them for your
[1:02:15] divine glory. Lord, we humble ourselves
[1:02:18] before you and this congregation knowing
[1:02:21] there's not one thing that a human could
[1:02:23] do to help another. But Lord, here there
[1:02:26] is a great and mighty spirit that could
[1:02:28] take your word, Lord. And if you would
[1:02:30] do something wonderful among us tonight,
[1:02:32] we would give you all the praise and the
[1:02:34] glory and the honor. We ask it in Jesus
[1:02:37] name. Amen. And amen. And God bless you
[1:02:41] tonight. If you have your Bibles, uh,
[1:02:43] I'd like to read to you from the book of
[1:02:45] Hebrews, uh, the fourth chapter. And I
[1:02:48] want to read the 12th verse down to the
[1:02:50] 16th. This is a little something I have
[1:02:52] been personally studying, and it's
[1:02:54] something that has been very much a
[1:02:56] blessing to me. Um, and and I just pray
[1:02:59] that it's a blessing to you tonight. I
[1:03:01] pray God would somehow use it to be able
[1:03:04] to touch your situation. in Hebrews
[1:03:06] chapter 4 and verse 12. Uh I believe
[1:03:10] Apostle Paul is the writer of this
[1:03:12] Hebrew book and he's trying to speak to
[1:03:14] these that are crossing over from the
[1:03:17] Jewish uh the Hebrew into and he's
[1:03:20] writing a beautiful letter and he said
[1:03:22] for the word of God is quick and
[1:03:25] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:03:29] sword. It is piercing even to the
[1:03:33] dividing of sunder of the soul and the
[1:03:36] spirit and of the joint and the moral
[1:03:40] and it is a discerner of the thought and
[1:03:44] the intent of the heart.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Now neither is there any creature that
[1:03:49] is not manifest in his sight, but all
[1:03:52] things are naked and opened unto the
[1:03:54] eyes of him whom we have to do. Now
[1:03:58] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:04:01] priest
[1:04:02] that is passed into the heavens, Jesus
[1:04:05] the son of God, let us hold fast our
[1:04:08] profession.
[1:04:10] For we have not a high priest
[1:04:13] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:04:16] of our infirmities, but was in all
[1:04:18] points tempted like as we are, yet
[1:04:23] without sin. Let us therefore come
[1:04:25] boldly under the throne of grace that we
[1:04:28] may be able to obtain mercy and find
[1:04:31] grace to help in the time of need. We
[1:04:35] ask the Lord to bless his word tonight
[1:04:36] and I want to speak to you for a few
[1:04:38] moments on this. The great
[1:04:40] high priest that can be touched
[1:04:44] that can be touched. Now if you if you
[1:04:48] like to study your Bibles, the book of
[1:04:49] Hebrews is a very wonderful book. It's a
[1:04:52] it's a key book of the Bible. It's a uh
[1:04:55] I I think it's one of the books that
[1:04:56] honestly if you told me I couldn't have
[1:04:59] but one book, it may be that one. Amen.
[1:05:01] It's just it's so inclusive of what it
[1:05:04] is. And you know, sometimes people look
[1:05:06] at something like the Old Testament and
[1:05:07] and of course I know we don't have one
[1:05:09] book, but sometimes you look at the Old
[1:05:11] Testament and you think of of the things
[1:05:13] that are there and really all of the
[1:05:16] laws and all of that only starts making
[1:05:18] sense when you start getting to the book
[1:05:19] of Hebrews. And it's in the book of
[1:05:21] Hebrews that it begins to develop really
[1:05:24] what it is that Christ is, what he did
[1:05:26] for us, how he manifest, and how he
[1:05:29] prophesied. And so it's a it's a very
[1:05:31] beautiful uh reading and and it's it's
[1:05:34] something that Paul I think it's
[1:05:36] powerful here in Hebrews 4 is that he
[1:05:39] has just been talking in Hebrews 3 about
[1:05:42] the rest that God has for the children
[1:05:44] of God. And he was telling them that it
[1:05:47] of course is not a Sabbath such as a
[1:05:49] Sunday or as a Saturday. Of course, a
[1:05:52] lot of people want to worship God on one
[1:05:53] of those days, but Paul was trying to
[1:05:55] let them know that there's not a certain
[1:05:57] day that man would worship, but that God
[1:06:00] had given us a rest. And that rest was
[1:06:02] that the spirit of God entered into man.
[1:06:05] That Jesus said, "Come unto me all you
[1:06:08] weak and heavy laden, and I will give
[1:06:10] you rest." Now, the rest he gave was the
[1:06:12] Holy Ghost.
[1:06:13] That's what gives a person an eternal
[1:06:15] rest. And then Paul goes on to say that
[1:06:18] the people uh in in the Old Testament,
[1:06:20] they heard the word of God. He says,
[1:06:22] "But they did not mix what they heard
[1:06:25] with faith. So they heard it, but it
[1:06:27] didn't profit them anything. They they
[1:06:29] wasn't benefited by the Bible said line
[1:06:31] on line and word upon line, but it
[1:06:33] didn't benefit them in that they didn't
[1:06:35] believe the word." Amen. But he said,
[1:06:37] "Don't you fall after the same example
[1:06:40] of unbelief." Amen. But we we could
[1:06:42] enter in. And if we're going to labor,
[1:06:44] let us labor to enter in to the rest
[1:06:47] that God gives. And then immediately
[1:06:49] he's talking about this rest. And he's
[1:06:51] talking about how that the Sabbath is
[1:06:53] done away with. And now Paul is going to
[1:06:55] be introducing the doing away, amen,
[1:06:57] with the priesthood. He's going to be
[1:06:59] doing away with the sacrifices. He's
[1:07:01] going to do with the altars. Amen. But
[1:07:03] at the same time he's doing this, he
[1:07:05] turns and tells them, "But we do have a
[1:07:07] priest." Amen. Hey, we we're not going
[1:07:09] to have a priest like we used to have,
[1:07:11] but God has left us a priest. And he's
[1:07:14] going to now introduce to us the idea
[1:07:17] that Jesus Christ is fulfilling the
[1:07:20] prophecy that Melazdc laid down in the
[1:07:23] book of Genesis when he came unto
[1:07:25] Abraham. Amen. And and this is this
[1:07:28] makes a great theme knowing that Hebrews
[1:07:30] the first chapter he begins with that
[1:07:32] God in sundried time spoke through the
[1:07:34] prophets. And it was God through the
[1:07:36] prophets, right? Man didn't write the
[1:07:38] Bible. God wrote the Bible. But it was
[1:07:40] God through prophets that wrote the
[1:07:42] scriptures. And he said in various
[1:07:43] times, in various ways. So there was a a
[1:07:45] dispensationalism where God appeared
[1:07:48] under different mask and and spoke unto
[1:07:50] them unto whirlwinds and pillars of
[1:07:52] fires and and God appeared unto them
[1:07:54] always. But in Hebrews, by the time he
[1:07:56] gets done the 13th chapter, he's going
[1:07:58] to say that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:08:01] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:08:03] though he's appeared different times and
[1:08:05] he's appeared different ways and he has
[1:08:08] spoken different times, he never is
[1:08:10] going to change. And Malachi said he's a
[1:08:13] God that changes not. Amen. And how we
[1:08:16] are to relax in that tonight. How we are
[1:08:18] to rest to know that we have a God that
[1:08:20] is an unchanging God in the midst of a
[1:08:23] changing world in a changing time. But
[1:08:25] he is the only uh uh he's the only thing
[1:08:28] that's not variable. He is one, amen,
[1:08:30] that is without shadow of turning. He
[1:08:32] alone is God and there is none beside
[1:08:35] him. And when Paul begins this that the
[1:08:37] word of God is a discerner. Amen. It's
[1:08:40] amazing because Paul is immediately
[1:08:42] forecasting or looking backwards into
[1:08:44] the book of Genesis in Genesis 18. We
[1:08:47] know that Abraham is the father of our
[1:08:50] faith. Now, if you're a Christian
[1:08:51] tonight, it's only because that you're
[1:08:53] Abraham's seed. Amen. As a Gentile, you
[1:08:56] just have no promises in the things of
[1:08:58] God. But God made you a child of Abraham
[1:09:02] through your faith through Jesus Christ.
[1:09:04] Amen. So he made you and connected you
[1:09:07] back to Abraham. And Paul immediately is
[1:09:09] going to do this and he's going to say
[1:09:11] for the word of God is a discerner. Now
[1:09:13] if you're a studyer of the Bible, you
[1:09:15] know in Genesis in the 17th chapter that
[1:09:18] Abraham meets the Lord God Almighty.
[1:09:20] Amen. And then immediately after meeting
[1:09:23] the Lord God Almighty, Amen. he gets a
[1:09:25] name change and he moves from Abram to
[1:09:27] Abraham. And God positions him. But but
[1:09:31] the one after just a couple of days
[1:09:33] later, there's one that appears to him
[1:09:35] that when three men start walking to
[1:09:37] Abraham, he looks at him and he says,
[1:09:39] "My Lord." And the scripture says that
[1:09:42] Abraham spoke to those three and called
[1:09:45] them my Lord. Amen. That's a great
[1:09:47] revelation in itself that he could see
[1:09:49] three different manifestations and still
[1:09:52] know there was just one Lord. Amen. Now,
[1:09:54] Lot didn't have that same revelation
[1:09:56] because when he seen two come down to
[1:09:59] Sodom, he said, "My lords," Amen. Not
[1:10:01] understanding the effect of the
[1:10:03] revelation that there is just one God.
[1:10:06] Amen. And when God appears, it's it's
[1:10:08] always as Abraham said to him, "My
[1:10:10] Lord." Amen. Now, was Abraham vindicated
[1:10:13] and calling him God? This was a man.
[1:10:15] Hebrews 7 says, "Look at how great this
[1:10:18] man was that Abraham paid tied to." So
[1:10:21] it wasn't just a a figment of
[1:10:23] imagination. It's a man that Abraham
[1:10:25] met. He was dusty in his clothes. He was
[1:10:28] tired. He got his feet washed. He ate
[1:10:30] calf and drank milk. So he was an actual
[1:10:32] man. But Abraham called him Lord. Now
[1:10:35] now and when he begin a discussion with
[1:10:37] him immediately Abraham speaking to this
[1:10:40] one has just had a name change. And this
[1:10:42] man talking to Abraham acknowledges him
[1:10:45] not under Abram but under Abraham.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; He calls him Abraham. He knows he has a
[1:10:50] wife and calls her name Sarah by what
[1:10:53] she had all it's been changed. But this
[1:10:56] man knows it. He knows the miracle of
[1:10:58] they're supposed to have a child in
[1:11:00] their old age. He knows the promises. He
[1:11:03] knows their name. Amen. He understands
[1:11:05] their positions. And when he begins to
[1:11:07] talk to them, the Bible says that Sarah,
[1:11:10] Genesis 18, that Sarah be in her heart
[1:11:13] to laugh at the man talking and said,
[1:11:17] "Amen. How could I have a child being
[1:11:19] that I'm in an old age? How could I have
[1:11:21] pleasure with my Lord? And the angel
[1:11:24] talking to Abraham said to him, "Why is
[1:11:26] Sarah laughing?" Now, the Bible says
[1:11:29] that Sarah was in the tent that was
[1:11:31] behind the man. And yet, he knew what
[1:11:34] was going on in her heart because the
[1:11:37] mystery behind it is it was the word. It
[1:11:40] was God that had come down and talked to
[1:11:42] Abraham. But being that Jesus had not
[1:11:45] yet been born a virgin birth, God put he
[1:11:49] actually created himself a dust body and
[1:11:52] stepped into that dust body and came
[1:11:53] down and manifested himself unto
[1:11:56] Abraham. Now, now Jesus, Amen,
[1:11:59] specifically manif uh uh manifest that
[1:12:02] same promise when he comes. How many
[1:12:05] realizes that's how Jesus made himself
[1:12:07] known as the Messiah?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; He started his public ministry with the
[1:12:11] woman at the well. How many knows he did
[1:12:12] it? Amen. That's how he let them know,
[1:12:15] "I'm the Messiah." That was his that was
[1:12:17] his uh uh driver's license, saying, "I'm
[1:12:20] the Messiah." Because God did that in
[1:12:23] Abraham's day to create a sign so that
[1:12:26] when Jesus came, he would be identified
[1:12:29] as the word, not just as a man. He would
[1:12:32] be the word. And the Bible said in the
[1:12:34] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:12:36] with God. And the 14th verse said the
[1:12:39] word had became flesh. So Jesus wasn't
[1:12:42] just the son of Mary and Joseph. He was
[1:12:46] the eternal word coming into a human
[1:12:48] body. And when he come into his
[1:12:50] ministry, he could prove to them who he
[1:12:52] was. And he proved to him through the
[1:12:55] same sign that Abraham had received. And
[1:12:58] what had Abraham received? He received a
[1:13:00] sign before the burning of Sodom.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Y'all know that's the truth. Before the
[1:13:04] burning of Sodom. And the scriptures
[1:13:06] predict that this world is going to burn
[1:13:09] with fervor and heat. Amen. And before
[1:13:11] this world could end, would God not have
[1:13:14] to show uh some mercy unto this world?
[1:13:17] Look what he did back there when when
[1:13:19] Jesus came, he reflected back to
[1:13:21] Abraham. Now Abraham had seen many
[1:13:24] things, had heard many voices, but the
[1:13:26] sign that Abraham saw was the last sign
[1:13:29] to the Gentile before destruction. And
[1:13:32] the church of the living God of course
[1:13:34] receives the same sign. Now, Jesus when
[1:13:36] he was on the earth, if you've not ever
[1:13:38] studied these things, I'll give you some
[1:13:40] scripture reference in John chapter 1,
[1:13:42] you'll find in verse 45 down to verse 49
[1:13:45] is a is a section when he's calling
[1:13:47] disciples to himself. And the Bible
[1:13:49] talks about a man named Philillip, one
[1:13:51] of his disciples. He goes to his buddy
[1:13:54] Nathaniel who's down there under a fig
[1:13:56] tree. And he goes down and can you
[1:13:58] imagine now they've been waiting for a
[1:14:00] Messiah ever since they become
[1:14:02] prophecies in Genesis chapter 3. They've
[1:14:05] been waiting for a savior and that
[1:14:07] savior would be a messiah and that
[1:14:09] savior would be a priest and that savior
[1:14:11] would be a king and they're looking for
[1:14:13] this great one to come and Moses himself
[1:14:15] said he would be a prophet like him and
[1:14:18] they've been waiting for this for years
[1:14:19] and here comes your buddy running down
[1:14:22] David Paul just like maybe Jared of
[1:14:24] Wesley come running to you and say we
[1:14:26] have found him of whom Moses has
[1:14:29] prophesied amen and all of a sudden amen
[1:14:31] Nathaniel's like oh wait a minute now
[1:14:34] amen where's is this guy from? He said,
[1:14:35] "Well, from Nazareth," he said, "Is
[1:14:37] there any good thing that comes out of
[1:14:39] Nazareth?" But the Bible had prophesied
[1:14:41] he would be a Nazarene. Amen. Amen. But
[1:14:43] yet, he says, "Now, what you need to do,
[1:14:46] Nathaniel, is just come and see. Won't
[1:14:48] you just come and look and and come and
[1:14:50] and and view what it is, amen, that
[1:14:52] these people are talking about?" And
[1:14:54] when Nathaniel got down to Jesus. And I
[1:14:56] love how Brother Bram says he said Jesus
[1:14:58] was just holding a prayer line like was
[1:15:00] his custom. And when he come down, he
[1:15:02] saw him coming. he wouldn't have been
[1:15:04] dressed any different than anybody else
[1:15:06] was dressed. And he looked upon him and
[1:15:09] he said, "Here comes an Israelite in
[1:15:11] whom there is no G." And when he heard
[1:15:14] this, Nathaniel said to him, "Amen,
[1:15:16] Rabbi, when did you know me?" He said,
[1:15:19] "I knew you before Philip talked to you
[1:15:22] under that fig tree." And and Nathaniel
[1:15:25] seeing that sign said, "Rabbi, thou art
[1:15:29] the son of God. Thou art the king of
[1:15:32] Israel.
[1:15:34] My goodness. Amen. When he saw that
[1:15:37] sign, he knew that was the Messiah in
[1:15:40] the flesh. What about in John 4? The
[1:15:42] woman in the Samaritan that was at the
[1:15:44] well. She was a ill-famed woman. And and
[1:15:46] the Bible says that Jesus was on his way
[1:15:50] and went by Samaria. Now, that's why
[1:15:52] he's the good Samaritan, right? He went
[1:15:54] out of his way to the well of Samaria.
[1:15:57] Went around. He didn't have to go that
[1:15:58] way, but he took a he took a long way
[1:16:01] around because he had a need to go down
[1:16:03] to buy Samaria. The Bible says he had a
[1:16:05] need down there. Amen. And there was a
[1:16:07] seed down there. Now, she was a little
[1:16:09] illfamed woman and she was coming to the
[1:16:11] well. Amen. Not when the other uh
[1:16:13] virgins came because she couldn't come
[1:16:16] when they came because her lifestyle had
[1:16:18] cut her out of the crowd and nobody
[1:16:20] would fellowship with her. Pharisees
[1:16:22] couldn't help her. The people couldn't
[1:16:23] help her. Nobody could fellowship with
[1:16:25] her. But when she got down there, there
[1:16:27] set a man on the side of the whale and
[1:16:30] begin to talk to her. Him was a Jew and
[1:16:33] she was a Samaritan and they had no
[1:16:35] inner relationships because they didn't
[1:16:37] believe the same thing. You know, being
[1:16:40] a Samaritan, they had the first four
[1:16:42] books of the Bible. Y'all know that they
[1:16:43] had the laws of they had the first four
[1:16:45] books, but they didn't have the prophets
[1:16:47] after Moses. So, they didn't agree on
[1:16:50] places of worship and how to be
[1:16:52] worshiped, where it was, and they didn't
[1:16:53] have all those other books. Amen. But
[1:16:55] they did have the principle that there
[1:16:58] was coming a Messiah who would be a
[1:17:00] prophet. And when they got to talking,
[1:17:02] amen, he said to her, said, "A woman,
[1:17:04] give me a drink." She said, "Well, you
[1:17:06] ain't got nothing to draw or give me a
[1:17:08] drink." She said, "Well, you're a a Jew
[1:17:09] asking me a Samaritan for a drink." And
[1:17:11] he said, "Well, if you knew who I was,
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; you'd ask me for a drink." She said,
[1:17:16] "Now you ain't got nothing to draw
[1:17:17] with." He said, "Oh, that's right." He
[1:17:19] said, "Didn't you go get your husband?"
[1:17:21] He had something, didn't he? Go get your
[1:17:23] husband. Amen. and and and and she said,
[1:17:25] "I don't have one." He said, "That's
[1:17:27] right. That's right. You've had five,
[1:17:30] but the one you got right now is not
[1:17:32] your husband."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And when she he said that, she said,
[1:17:36] "Sir,
[1:17:37] I perceive thou art a prophet." And then
[1:17:41] they start discussing a little bit of of
[1:17:43] of religion. And and all of a sudden,
[1:17:45] the woman saith unto him, I know that
[1:17:48] when the Messiah cometh, he will tell us
[1:17:50] these things. Amen. And you know what
[1:17:52] Jesus said unto her? I am he that
[1:17:55] speaketh unto you. He was the prophet
[1:17:58] and he was the Messiah, making him a
[1:18:01] prophet, a priest, and a king all in one
[1:18:04] person. My goodness, what a reality. You
[1:18:08] say, "Well, preacher, Amen. Now, now you
[1:18:10] you you that gets real deep. I don't
[1:18:12] have time to get to be a Bible study
[1:18:15] tonight, but I'll say this to you. That
[1:18:16] was a Jew and a Samaritan, but he never
[1:18:19] did that for a Gentile." Just put that
[1:18:21] in your mind. And remember, Jesus never
[1:18:23] done that to a Gentile because Gentiles
[1:18:26] wasn't expecting a Messiah in that time.
[1:18:28] You didn't start expecting a Messiah
[1:18:30] until Apostle Paul began to preach unto
[1:18:33] the Gentiles, the revelation that God
[1:18:36] was going to send a Messiah. So, how
[1:18:38] could he have fulfilled that prophecy of
[1:18:40] Luke 17 among the Jews and the
[1:18:43] Samaritans? It was a prophecy of what he
[1:18:45] would do among the Gentiles
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; in the last days. Now you you know Jesus
[1:18:51] was the word. In Matthew 9 it records,
[1:18:54] amen, that he was able to discern the
[1:18:57] thoughts of the scribes. Matthew 9 and4
[1:18:59] said, "Amen. Wherefore think ye evil in
[1:19:02] your hearts?" He knew the very thoughts
[1:19:04] they were thinking. Amen. When the
[1:19:06] Pharisees asked him about his taxes, is
[1:19:09] it right we pay fair Pharisee uh uh to
[1:19:11] Caesar? Jesus, the Bible said Matthew
[1:19:13] 28:2 and 18, he perceived their
[1:19:16] wickedness. Amen. In Luke chapter 6, we
[1:19:20] know there was a man showed up on the
[1:19:21] Sabbath with a withered hand. Amen. And
[1:19:24] they begin to tempt the Lord because
[1:19:26] they wondered about him healing on a
[1:19:28] Sabbath. Amen. And after a little while,
[1:19:30] the Lord said, "I'll ask you one thing.
[1:19:32] Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do
[1:19:34] good or evil, to save a life or
[1:19:36] destroy?" And looking around upon them,
[1:19:38] he said, "Stretch forth thine hand." And
[1:19:41] he did, and his hand was restored. He
[1:19:44] understood the thought that they were
[1:19:46] thinking. In Luke chapter 7, the Bible
[1:19:48] tells us, amen, that he perceived a
[1:19:51] woman that washed his feet. He knew
[1:19:53] exactly what her sin was, but he knew
[1:19:56] what Simon was thinking in his heart
[1:19:58] while the woman was washing his feet
[1:20:00] because he was a discerner of the
[1:20:03] thought and the intents of the heart.
[1:20:05] When the disciples themselves were
[1:20:07] disputing among themselves who was the
[1:20:10] greatest, in Luke 9 and 47, Jesus
[1:20:13] perceived their thoughts at the pool of
[1:20:15] Bethesda. He healed a man that was 38
[1:20:18] years. And Jesus said to him, "You've
[1:20:21] been a long time in this problem." Jesus
[1:20:24] knew how long he had been in the problem
[1:20:26] and met him at the tabernacle a little
[1:20:28] while later and told him to go and sin
[1:20:30] no more. He knew his disease. He knew
[1:20:33] how long he had had it. And he knew what
[1:20:35] sins he had committed because he was the
[1:20:39] word of God. Amen. The crowd that were
[1:20:41] seeking after a sign. Amen. There's
[1:20:44] example after example. But it was our
[1:20:46] Lord Jesus that spoke unto them in the
[1:20:49] Bible and told them, "You seek after a
[1:20:52] sign, but there'll be no sign given unto
[1:20:54] us adulterous and wicked generation
[1:20:56] other than the sign of Jonas, who was
[1:20:59] three days in the belly of a whale." And
[1:21:01] then he walked out into Nineveh. Amen.
[1:21:04] And they repented at his preaching.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; But I say to you, a greater than Jonas
[1:21:09] has appeared unto you in this age.
[1:21:12] Listen, this is a wicked and adulterous
[1:21:13] generation. And what sign will they get?
[1:21:16] They will get a sign that Jesus Christ
[1:21:19] is not in a tomb in Jerusalem. He's not
[1:21:21] in a grave somewhere's in the desert in
[1:21:24] the Middle of East. But Jesus rose on
[1:21:27] the third day. And he's just as alive
[1:21:29] tonight as when he walked on the shores
[1:21:31] of Galilee. He is the immortal, eternal,
[1:21:34] almighty God. And he raised from the
[1:21:37] dead forever more. Now, I I I propose to
[1:21:41] you tonight that he's alive. He's just
[1:21:44] as alive tonight as he ever was. Glory
[1:21:47] to God. I've been to the tomb in
[1:21:49] Jerusalem. I tell you, he ain't there.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He ain't in that tomb in Jerusalem.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; But he raised up and he's upon the
[1:22:00] throne of God.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I I say this tonight, folks. We
[1:22:05] have examples. If you are a a sincere
[1:22:09] Bible Christian and you are sincere
[1:22:12] before God, there are over 8300
[1:22:16] examples on magnetic recording sir
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; of this exact sign done in our
[1:22:23] generation to prove to us he is the same
[1:22:27] yesterday, today, and forever. If I was
[1:22:30] going to take you to court tonight and I
[1:22:32] was going to make you prove that Jesus
[1:22:34] is alive, what kind of evidence could
[1:22:36] you bring? If you would disclude William
[1:22:39] Brandham's ministry, you would be
[1:22:41] far-fetched to try to prove it. You
[1:22:43] would be a dark and dismal day. But if
[1:22:46] you would allow me to present the case
[1:22:48] that he's alive and use William
[1:22:50] Brandon's ministry to do so, I have
[1:22:52] infallible proofs here tonight. I don't
[1:22:55] have a nail. I don't have a piece of the
[1:22:57] cross. I have a manifestation of the
[1:23:00] word of God in this generation. He is
[1:23:03] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:23:06] He is an everpresent God. It's just as
[1:23:09] real tonight as he ever was real.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; He's not another God. He's the same God.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; We have over 8,300 examples that it's
[1:23:17] the truth. Now, you've seen the videos
[1:23:19] here tonight. I don't know who made
[1:23:21] them, but thank God they had them.
[1:23:24] Now, now I can I can show you biblically
[1:23:28] that this Bible says in Malachi chapter
[1:23:30] 4 that I God will send unto you Elijah
[1:23:33] before the prophet the great and
[1:23:34] dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; And he'll turn the heart of the father
[1:23:38] to the children and the heart of the
[1:23:40] children to the father lest I come and
[1:23:41] smite the earth with a curse. Now, now
[1:23:43] some people don't really maybe
[1:23:45] understand that, but scripturally now
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; this spirit of Elijah will come five
[1:23:50] times.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Now, there's no argument in that. I can
[1:23:54] show it to you. If you can read, you can
[1:23:56] see it.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll come five times. Now, where
[1:24:00] it takes a revelation is to understand
[1:24:02] who fulfills that.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; We know we know Elijah did the first
[1:24:06] one.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And we know Elisha had the spirit, the
[1:24:09] second one. And we know John the
[1:24:11] Baptist, even according to Jesus, he had
[1:24:13] the spirit of Elias. Amen. And John the
[1:24:15] Baptist fulfilled it. So it was a man
[1:24:17] with the same spirit that Elijah had.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I propose to you that this man
[1:24:23] William Brandom had the same spirit on
[1:24:26] him that those prophets had back there.
[1:24:29] So well brother Wayne there's no such a
[1:24:30] thing as prophets. Well the devil done
[1:24:32] lied to you.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; He done he done took away Listen, this
[1:24:37] Bible said that God could reveal nothing
[1:24:40] until first he sends a prophet.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Do you think God would let the end of
[1:24:44] the world come and not send a prophet to
[1:24:47] warn this generation? He would be an
[1:24:49] unjust god
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; to not give this generation the same
[1:24:54] opportunity that he gave other
[1:24:55] generations. That's why Jesus says, "As
[1:24:58] it was in the days of Noah,
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:25:04] of man." That's prophet. Amen. As it was
[1:25:06] in the days of Lot, so shall it be in
[1:25:09] the coming of the son of man. Now, these
[1:25:11] are powerful scriptures. But Jesus hid
[1:25:13] something, didn't he? Because you got
[1:25:15] the days of Lot. That's the burning of
[1:25:17] Sodom. But what about Abraham on the
[1:25:19] mountain with Elohim? There's the
[1:25:22] secret. We've got Noah in the flood in
[1:25:25] judgment. But what about Enoch that
[1:25:27] walked off of the earth just before the
[1:25:29] judgment struck? There's the secret. I
[1:25:31] tell you, if there's a judgment, there's
[1:25:33] a secret of a rapture leaning there
[1:25:36] where God is still going to be merciful.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Man, you can let some denomination rob
[1:25:43] you from the great blessing of a
[1:25:44] prophetic word in this age. Amen. But
[1:25:47] I'm going to bypass the tribulation.
[1:25:49] Amen. And I'm not going to let no
[1:25:50] denominational system rob me.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; When the Bible said in Luke 17, even the
[1:25:57] day when the son of man is revealed in
[1:25:59] Revelations 10, my Bible says, "In the
[1:26:01] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:26:03] he shall begin to sound and the mystery
[1:26:05] of God shall be finished."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; I know you're not supposed to take off a
[1:26:10] jacket in a in a tent meeting because
[1:26:11] your li will get cold and get a horse
[1:26:13] vote, but I'm gonna go on and try it.
[1:26:16] Now, the mystery of God would be
[1:26:17] finished. In Revelations 10 and 7, it
[1:26:20] says the seventh angel. Now, that that's
[1:26:22] mysterious, isn't it? A seventh angel.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; But if you go to Revelations 1 and 16,
[1:26:28] it'll get a little more mysterious
[1:26:29] because the Bible says that the Lord
[1:26:32] shows in his in his great uh in his
[1:26:34] great demonstration and vision that he
[1:26:36] had in his right hand seven stars, and
[1:26:39] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:26:40] sword, and his countenance was the son's
[1:26:42] shinth and strength. But if you'll just
[1:26:44] read the 20th verse, it loses its
[1:26:46] mystery. He said, "For the mystery of
[1:26:48] the seven stars which thou sawest is the
[1:26:50] seven candlesticks or the the mystery of
[1:26:53] the seven stars which thou sawest and
[1:26:55] the seven golden candlesticks." The
[1:26:57] seven stars are the seven angels of the
[1:26:59] churches. And the seven candlesticks are
[1:27:02] those which are the seven church ages.
[1:27:04] In Revelation chapter 3, the Bible
[1:27:06] speaks of allow to see an age that is a
[1:27:09] seventh age. And there is an angel under
[1:27:11] the seventh age, and his name is William
[1:27:14] Brandom.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Now, since the seven thunders have
[1:27:18] opened, the symbols themselves have been
[1:27:20] removed, and they're not a mystery to us
[1:27:22] no more.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Now, y'all know the book of Revelations
[1:27:26] is symbol, right?
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; But when the symbol is removed, then it
[1:27:30] brings revelation. Revelation brings
[1:27:32] power. Amen. Now, now I I I know that
[1:27:34] that's a that's maybe difficult for some
[1:27:37] people, but I remember years ago I was
[1:27:39] preaching in a meeting over there in
[1:27:40] Norway and there was a lady in the
[1:27:42] meetings with with leukemia cancer. I'd
[1:27:44] talked to her before. She was a very
[1:27:45] weak woman. She was just about to the
[1:27:48] point of death with leukemia, but she
[1:27:49] pressed through and come to the meetings
[1:27:51] anyhow. And I was preaching on the
[1:27:53] mystery of seven stars. And I just took
[1:27:54] it for a topic. And when I got to that
[1:27:56] seven star, I said, you know, you watch
[1:27:58] this. Nobody has a problem with Paul
[1:28:00] being that first star. Amen. The whole
[1:28:03] world preaches that's Paul. Amen. And
[1:28:05] they have no problem talking about
[1:28:07] Martin Luther and the Protestant
[1:28:09] Revelation and John Wesley and his
[1:28:11] holiness movement and the Zuza Pentecost
[1:28:14] and all that. But when you say the name
[1:28:16] William Brandom,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; every devil in hell crawls up. Amen. And
[1:28:20] starts coming you. You say, "Preacher,
[1:28:22] why is it?" I'll tell you why it is.
[1:28:24] Because he exposed that devil for who he
[1:28:26] was.
[1:28:28] Because the world was trying to say if
[1:28:31] you join a church you get salvation. If
[1:28:33] you shake somebody's hand you get
[1:28:35] salvation. If you come to our belief
[1:28:38] there comes salvation. And William
[1:28:40] Brandham stood on the platform of every
[1:28:42] denomination. And he said there's only
[1:28:44] one way of salvation. It is through the
[1:28:46] blood of Jesus Christ the son of God.
[1:28:50] You cannot replace Jesus with religion.
[1:28:53] You can't replace him with church energy
[1:28:56] or social events. It'll be a personal
[1:28:58] relationship with him. Amen. Jesus
[1:29:01] Christ, the son of God, is the chief
[1:29:04] cornerstone of the church.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And if you try to separate him from his
[1:29:11] word, you're going to have a lot of
[1:29:12] trouble.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; You're gonna have a lot of trouble
[1:29:15] because he is his word. So don't say you
[1:29:18] love him and you don't like his word.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's really where it
[1:29:22] went. They wanted religion without the
[1:29:24] word and William Brandham took it away
[1:29:26] from them and said the word is God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And you can't say you have the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost and deny one Bible verse and walk
[1:29:35] away because God authored the Bible, the
[1:29:38] Holy Ghost authored the Bible. Then God
[1:29:40] himself is the interpreter of the Bible.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; The word of God is sharper and more
[1:29:47] piercing than the zerorter of the
[1:29:49] thought and testimony. Now, let me just
[1:29:51] let me just approach this as I'm as I'm
[1:29:53] moving along. I just want to I want to
[1:29:55] ask you this and and I want you to think
[1:29:57] about it. Amen. You're sitting here
[1:29:59] tonight. You tell me where William
[1:30:02] Brandham missed being the seventh angel
[1:30:06] in one place. Somebody People says to
[1:30:07] me, "Brother Wayne, prove to me that
[1:30:09] Brother Brand was that prophet." And you
[1:30:11] know what I say? I say, "You prove to me
[1:30:12] he wasn't."
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; I've been church studying church
[1:30:16] history. Amen. For 30 years. I've read
[1:30:19] nearly every book I can get my hands on.
[1:30:21] I've listened to every great man, read
[1:30:23] every great book, and I have never seen
[1:30:25] one ministry that could stand in the
[1:30:28] same universe with the ministry of
[1:30:30] William Brandham because it wasn't
[1:30:32] William Brandham's ministry. It was the
[1:30:35] ministry of Jesus Christ that he
[1:30:38] promised in this generation. So, a bunch
[1:30:40] of heretics got around Brother Bram's
[1:30:42] ministry and they started worshiping
[1:30:43] Brother Brandham and they started making
[1:30:45] Brother Brandham in the place of the son
[1:30:47] of God. Amen. And what they done is
[1:30:49] defamed the revelation and reality of
[1:30:52] what God was doing and made the real
[1:30:54] church look like a bunch of fanatics
[1:30:56] when no man of God and no Bible teacher
[1:31:00] ever taught William Brandham should be
[1:31:02] worshiped. On the contrary, William
[1:31:04] Brandham himself said, "Don't you
[1:31:07] worship me. You would make me an
[1:31:09] antichrist. But I have come to introduce
[1:31:12] you to Jesus Christ for his second
[1:31:15] coming."
[1:31:17] Hallelujah. A vindicated word.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I don't want a Baptist teaching. I don't
[1:31:22] want a Lutheran teaching. I don't want
[1:31:24] the ideas of a Roman Catholic. Give me
[1:31:26] the Bible. Give me the original word of
[1:31:30] the living God,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; but make it live.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to throw away one
[1:31:38] scripture to believe the word.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; It was prophesied for my day. Yes, sir.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, what you what
[1:31:47] are you talking about?" Hebrews 4 said
[1:31:48] he's a discerner
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; of the thought and the intents of the
[1:31:51] heart, the word.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; When you seen that ministry, what was
[1:31:55] Brother Brandham doing? He was proving
[1:31:58] that God is still the word.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; He is still the discerner. He is the
[1:32:03] same yesterday, today, and forever. So,
[1:32:07] though Paul is doing away with the
[1:32:09] priest, he's not doing away with our
[1:32:11] priest.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch what he's doing in
[1:32:15] Hebrews chapter 4. Watch this 14th
[1:32:18] verse. Seeing then I love that.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You catch this
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; that we have a great high priest.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me I don't have a priest
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; just because I won't follow the laws of
[1:32:32] Israel. Don't tell me I don't have a
[1:32:34] priest just cuz I won't call some Roman
[1:32:37] guy who's most of them child abductors
[1:32:40] and and perverts and everything else and
[1:32:42] because they put on a black suit and
[1:32:44] turn around and call her I'm supposed to
[1:32:46] call him holy father. You call him holy
[1:32:48] father if you want to. To me it come
[1:32:50] from hell.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I can read it to you out of the Bible.
[1:32:54] It said it ascended out of a bottomless
[1:32:56] pit.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible calls it Amen. It's that woman
[1:33:00] is a and her daughter is harlots.
[1:33:04] She's not the virgin bride of this
[1:33:06] Bible.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Well, it's the truth.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Just because I won't follow some priest
[1:33:13] or some father or some holy
[1:33:14] denomination. Amen. I have a priest.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; I got one, folks. He's a great priest.
[1:33:22] He's a high priest.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; But he's not here in the flesh. Come on.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; This Jesus has passed into the heavens.
[1:33:30] It's Jesus the son of God.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Now Paul's fist set in to teach
[1:33:35] something powerful
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; because now if you if you like reading
[1:33:39] your Bibles, go back after today and
[1:33:40] study this with me. But from the time of
[1:33:43] the Mosaic law when it came in, there
[1:33:45] wasn't no such thing as priest as far as
[1:33:47] law till after Moses. And Moses put in
[1:33:51] his brother Aaron. Remember
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; from Aaron come the tribe of Levi. And
[1:33:56] out of Levi's tribe would come all of
[1:33:59] the priests unto God.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Now, God was so specific with that
[1:34:04] Levitical tribe until every priest that
[1:34:07] was born had to be born from that tribe.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the thing. The whole line
[1:34:13] was a tribe of Levi because Levi had
[1:34:17] been in the loins of Abraham when he met
[1:34:21] Mechazedc
[1:34:23] who was God's priest. Come on.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to watch something
[1:34:26] powerful here. Because every one of them
[1:34:29] were born of the tribe of Levi. Do you
[1:34:30] know if you go back in the in the
[1:34:32] history, you'll not find that there was
[1:34:35] any of the high priest who were kings
[1:34:37] and high priest at the same time.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Because the line of Judah, which was
[1:34:43] David's children, were to be the line of
[1:34:46] kings. In other words, let's put it like
[1:34:48] this. Amen. That I'm going to have sons
[1:34:50] and brother Matt's going to have sons.
[1:34:53] My sons, they could be the Levites. They
[1:34:55] could be the priests of God. His sons
[1:34:58] could be the kings to God. Amen. But
[1:35:00] they couldn't be one of my sons be both
[1:35:04] king and priest because it had to come
[1:35:06] the line of Levi and the line of Judah.
[1:35:09] Amen. So what they did is they separated
[1:35:11] the offices. Now I can prove it to you
[1:35:13] by Bible. There was a man Uzziah one
[1:35:15] time went in and tried to offer unto God
[1:35:19] as a king. He tried to become a priest
[1:35:22] and leprosy struck him.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Remember that?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he was trying to cross
[1:35:29] those two offices together and God had
[1:35:32] thoroughly separated them under the law.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Now, let's watch what Paul's going to
[1:35:37] do. He's now going to offer the idea to
[1:35:40] the people that Jesus, this man you
[1:35:43] crucified, is both of the line of the
[1:35:47] priest and of king. All right.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; What an idea.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. You can see it if you
[1:35:55] watch the law. Now it's one thing. If
[1:35:57] you know an answer, you can back up in
[1:36:00] and prove it. Right?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Like uh you know sometimes you start out
[1:36:03] with the answer and somebody said,
[1:36:04] "How'd you get the answer?" Well, then
[1:36:05] you got to back up in the Bible and get
[1:36:07] it.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; It's kind of like the message. You
[1:36:09] started out with the answer, then you
[1:36:11] just go in the Bible to prove the answer
[1:36:12] that has been given. Now watch. Because
[1:36:15] when you know that the high priest is
[1:36:17] significant because Jesus is going to be
[1:36:19] the high priest.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Do you know that a high priest in the
[1:36:23] Bible was called a head priest or a
[1:36:26] great priest.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; He was also called a chief priest.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; I got all the scriptures. I'm not going
[1:36:31] to read them, but if you want them, I
[1:36:32] can give them to you. And elsewhere, he
[1:36:35] was called the priest that is anointed.
[1:36:39] Now what he done is he was anointed
[1:36:42] differently than the ordinary priest. So
[1:36:45] there would be one priest called the
[1:36:47] high priest, chief priest. He would also
[1:36:49] be called the anointed one. Amen. And he
[1:36:52] was actually had the anointing oil would
[1:36:55] be poured over the crown of his head
[1:36:58] like you were crowning him but you were
[1:37:01] doing it with anointing oil. So what he
[1:37:04] was going to do was he was going to
[1:37:05] anoint him, not put a regular crown on
[1:37:08] him, but put oil upon him, showing that
[1:37:11] the anointing would come upon him
[1:37:13] differently than the other Levites. And
[1:37:16] what he would do, an ordinary priest, of
[1:37:18] course, he was sprinkled with the with
[1:37:19] it. And he was anointed through
[1:37:21] sprinkling rather than through the
[1:37:23] designation of the pouring because it
[1:37:25] was implying a marked distinction
[1:37:27] between the anointings that would be
[1:37:29] upon them. Because see it's a type that
[1:37:32] the high priest was a type of Jesus
[1:37:34] Christ unlike other priest. He was able
[1:37:37] to atone for the sins of the people
[1:37:41] because a high priest was the only
[1:37:43] priest that could in Leviticus 16 that
[1:37:46] was the day of atonement. Amen. Which
[1:37:48] would be in the fall of the year under
[1:37:49] Yum Kapor. He would actually go into the
[1:37:52] tabernacle and he would then propitiate
[1:37:55] for the sins of the people. The high
[1:37:57] priest was the one that wore the the the
[1:38:00] actual chest covering of the uromum. He
[1:38:03] was the one that wore the matter upon
[1:38:05] his head because he become the judge of
[1:38:08] all spiritual matters. Amen. He was the
[1:38:10] one that walked into the priestly office
[1:38:12] and could atone for the sins of the
[1:38:15] people. Listen, if you didn't have a
[1:38:16] high priest, you couldn't have a day of
[1:38:18] atonement because only one man could go
[1:38:21] back there.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. You say, "Preacher, what
[1:38:24] are you getting at?" I'm getting it. Had
[1:38:26] to be a special man. He had to be born a
[1:38:28] special way. Do you know he couldn't be
[1:38:30] illegitimate? He could not have a
[1:38:32] blemish. There couldn't be nothing about
[1:38:34] him that was off. Amen. That's why when
[1:38:37] Paul said Jesus was a high priest, you
[1:38:40] can imagine how them Levitical law
[1:38:43] searchers was just tore right up at that
[1:38:46] idea.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Illegitimate.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. that bastard born child of of a
[1:38:53] Roman soldier born to that young woman
[1:38:56] that had it before she was ever even
[1:38:57] married
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; but he was calling him a high priest. He
[1:39:04] was realizing he was appointed of God.
[1:39:06] He was called of God but he was being
[1:39:08] called after a different order. Amen.
[1:39:12] This would be superior to the arionic
[1:39:14] priest. This would be he wouldn't just
[1:39:16] make an offering in the holy place. he
[1:39:20] would be able to enter in to the heavens
[1:39:22] of heavens. He wasn't just consecrated.
[1:39:25] He was consecrated by an oath that God
[1:39:28] himself made a promise. According to
[1:39:30] Hebrews, he would be holy and harmless
[1:39:33] and undefiled. My God. I'm talking about
[1:39:37] a priest that is holy. He is harmless
[1:39:40] and he's undefiled. Listen, somebody
[1:39:43] tells you you got to keep your sins, you
[1:39:45] tell them they're a liar. I got a high
[1:39:47] priest.
[1:39:49] I got one that's atoned for my sins.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; He was holy. He was harmless. He was
[1:39:55] undefiled. According to Hebrews, he was
[1:39:58] faithful unto him that appointed him.
[1:40:00] Now, when you keep looking at this, he
[1:40:02] was better. Amen. His sacrifices was
[1:40:04] better. His pattern was better. His
[1:40:07] offering was better. His laws were
[1:40:09] better. He was a better priest with
[1:40:11] better promises for a better result.
[1:40:15] Now, why wouldn't he? Now, he's trying
[1:40:16] to convince these people. He's selling
[1:40:18] to them, you need to trade priest.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; He's telling them, you need to change
[1:40:24] priest.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; You need to get out from under that law
[1:40:29] and get under this great high priest.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. You say, "Now, now
[1:40:34] what did he do?" I can't preach the
[1:40:36] whole book of Hebrews tonight, but I'll
[1:40:38] say this. He obtained
[1:40:40] eternal redemption.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When that old priest went in
[1:40:45] and made that blood sacrifice, he made
[1:40:47] redemption for one year.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus went into the heavens of
[1:40:52] heavens, he took his own blood, not the
[1:40:55] blood of some goat or some bull. And
[1:40:57] when he made an atonement, it was an
[1:41:00] eternal atonement of redemption. Listen
[1:41:04] to me. He was the author of eternal
[1:41:08] salvation.
[1:41:10] It's not saved one day and lost another
[1:41:13] day. It's not I'm a good guy today and
[1:41:15] I'm lost tomorrow. It's if a man ever
[1:41:18] did get saved, he is always saved
[1:41:21] because God did not author a temporary
[1:41:24] salvation. He authored eternal salvation
[1:41:28] is through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul was trying to move him to
[1:41:37] the priesthood of Christ.
[1:41:39] Why would you want to stay under that
[1:41:41] law? Why would you want to stay in a
[1:41:43] denomination? Why would you want to go
[1:41:45] under denominational forgiveness? You
[1:41:48] can come to a priest with eternal
[1:41:49] salvation.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the thing.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; This priest, he was tempted in every
[1:41:57] manner according to what man is tempted.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the beauty
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; is this. If you if you're forecasting
[1:42:05] backwards, you're seeing Melazdc in the
[1:42:07] Old Testament. When he met Abraham, he
[1:42:10] introduced himself as the priest of God,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; right? But he also said he was the king
[1:42:15] of Salem
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and the king of New King of Jerusalem.
[1:42:19] Amen. And he was the king of
[1:42:21] righteousness. Now watch, he then was a
[1:42:23] priest and a king. Now, brother Bram
[1:42:26] said the revelation behind it in Paul as
[1:42:28] well is that he was the word but he
[1:42:31] wasn't in a man body that was born of a
[1:42:33] woman
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; because he was without be this is
[1:42:36] Hebrews 7 according to this man who was
[1:42:39] without beginning of days or ending of
[1:42:42] life having no mother or no father
[1:42:46] without descent in other words he didn't
[1:42:48] have any genealogy
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; he didn't come from any line because God
[1:42:54] the bird picked up an element and went
[1:42:58] bold a body stepped into it and talked
[1:43:01] to Abraham.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came into the earth,
[1:43:05] amen, he had to come through the womb of
[1:43:07] a woman. So God created a blood cell.
[1:43:10] Amen. And when Jesus was born, he was
[1:43:13] born like every person in this building.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; He was born, amen, into this world with
[1:43:21] a human body. Can you imagine? Almighty
[1:43:24] God had to have his diapers changed.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. Almighty God had to have a
[1:43:32] bottle. He had to be warmed. He had to
[1:43:35] be cared for.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. You Somebody said to me one
[1:43:40] time, "Well, he became God." Amen. Down
[1:43:42] there. Well, I I I think you need to go
[1:43:44] back with your theology
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said the word became
[1:43:48] flesh.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Amen. you. People get
[1:43:52] this mixed up. They think that a man
[1:43:54] become God. Oh, no. That's real wrong.
[1:43:57] It was God became man. Amen. He was God
[1:44:01] before he was ever a man and he got into
[1:44:04] the human body and he was born that he
[1:44:06] might redeem us. Now watch what
[1:44:07] happened. And he was tempted in every
[1:44:09] might man. That's why listen to me
[1:44:11] folks. When you get saved, I want you to
[1:44:13] know temptation is not sin.
[1:44:16] And you get a good legalist as a pastor
[1:44:18] and he'll keep you under so much
[1:44:20] condemnation that you can't even have
[1:44:22] any faith because every man knows other
[1:44:25] men are tempted with many things. But
[1:44:28] Paul said that our Lord Jesus was
[1:44:30] tempted but he did it without sin.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; I know you never believe this but Jesus
[1:44:38] Christ was tempted with sexual sin.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. He was tempted with smoking.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't think when he walked by
[1:44:48] that bar, amen, that spirit didn't say
[1:44:50] to him, "You are to go on in there and
[1:44:53] enjoy the evening with them people."
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; He was tempted in every like manner of
[1:44:59] man. That's why he was a great high
[1:45:01] priest.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. How could God himself
[1:45:05] ever feel all that? But if God took a
[1:45:08] human body, it was the perfect order. It
[1:45:11] was the perfect thing. the God of heaven
[1:45:14] and a fleshborn body and put them
[1:45:16] together. He would be the king of kings
[1:45:20] and he would be the priest of all
[1:45:22] priests.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; He was tempted in every like manner.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, brother Wayne, I
[1:45:30] got the Holy Ghost." Now, I'm preaching,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; "Brother Wayne, I got the Holy Ghost,
[1:45:34] but I I tell you what, I had a lot of
[1:45:35] troubles. I I maybe I didn't get the
[1:45:37] Holy Ghost cuz I got this temptation. I
[1:45:39] got that temptation." Let me tell you
[1:45:41] something brother Ram said about it. He
[1:45:43] said if you come to the altar and
[1:45:44] receive the Holy Ghost and you go away
[1:45:46] and ain't tempted. He said you didn't
[1:45:48] get it. Go back and try again.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; He said if you wasn't tempted then you
[1:45:54] didn't get the right thing. Because when
[1:45:57] Jesus had the spirit anoint him he went
[1:45:59] immediately into the desert and was
[1:46:02] tempted of 40 days where he overcame
[1:46:05] that devil.
[1:46:07] and he overcame and so can you overcome.
[1:46:11] Amen. Because the overcomer is in the
[1:46:13] inside. He's not just a priest.
[1:46:17] He's God.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; I love it. I I I wish I I I need to take
[1:46:25] some some uh Hebrew lessons because this
[1:46:27] these Hebrew words are beautiful. But
[1:46:29] the title of distinction of high priest
[1:46:31] was known as the anointed priest. And
[1:46:34] and it gives you two uh Hebrew words.
[1:46:36] I'm not going to tempt them. But it
[1:46:38] literally means the Messiah priest.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Paul was letting them know
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; that my high priest,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; he's the Messiah priest.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; He's the one the whole world's been
[1:46:55] waiting on.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; He's the one we've been waiting on since
[1:46:59] the book of Genesis.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; He's the one Isaac said, "Where is the
[1:47:04] lamb?" John answered it in the river and
[1:47:06] said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes
[1:47:09] away the sin of the world."
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; He was also called the Messiah prince.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; From the book of Daniel, he was the
[1:47:17] anointed Messiah prince. He is the
[1:47:19] messianic priest. He's the one, meaning
[1:47:22] the anointed one. I know we preach on
[1:47:24] the anointed ones of the end time. What
[1:47:26] about the anointed one?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; The one anointed to take away sin. The
[1:47:32] one the anointed to deliver the
[1:47:33] children. The one anointed to be the
[1:47:36] king and the priest over the children of
[1:47:38] God. I'll tell you this, Jesus Christ
[1:47:40] fulfills all things of prophet, priest,
[1:47:43] and king.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; He was anointed. Well, the Bible said,
[1:47:46] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me. He
[1:47:49] hath anointed me to preach the gospel."
[1:47:52] In Acts chapter 10 and verse 38, God
[1:47:54] anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:57] with power. He was not put a crown upon
[1:48:00] him, but he was anointed. Prophets were
[1:48:02] anointed to prophesy the word. Kings
[1:48:04] were anointed to rule and priests were
[1:48:06] anointed to mediate. And Jesus had the
[1:48:09] anointing of all three. Amen. He was the
[1:48:12] Lord. Amen. Because the Bible swore that
[1:48:14] he would have a priest forever after the
[1:48:17] order of Melkazdc. He was that priest
[1:48:19] they were looking for. Amen. He was that
[1:48:21] priest. said, "I I don't have time to
[1:48:23] preach it, but you preachers go I won't
[1:48:25] throw this in for you, but in the book
[1:48:26] of Zechariah, he's the priest that one
[1:48:29] day God told Zachchariah, he said he
[1:48:32] said, "Go get priest Jo uh Joshua, which
[1:48:34] means Jehovah Savior, and bring him in
[1:48:36] here, and I want you to make two crowns
[1:48:38] and put them on his head. Make one of
[1:48:41] silver." and he crowned a high priest
[1:48:44] with two crowns and then took them off
[1:48:47] of his head and placed him in the temple
[1:48:50] as a memorial that someday there's
[1:48:53] coming a priest that's going to be also
[1:48:56] he's going to be the king. And the Bible
[1:48:59] prophesied that the priest shall set
[1:49:01] upon the throne to rule. No wonder
[1:49:03] Revelations 19 said when Jesus come from
[1:49:06] the heavens of heaven, he would be
[1:49:07] riding a white horse and he would be
[1:49:09] crowned with many crowns. He'll be the
[1:49:12] prophet, the priest, the king. He's
[1:49:14] Jehovah God.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; He is the king of all kings. He's the
[1:49:20] priest of all priests. There is nobody
[1:49:23] like Jesus.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, you lift him up too
[1:49:29] high. It's not possible.
[1:49:32] He's got a name above every name.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; You're you're combining now under Jesus
[1:49:37] Christ. The major work of course of him
[1:49:40] was the atoning of the blood. Now, if
[1:49:42] you're a Now, I'm I'm sorry. I'm just
[1:49:45] this guy. I got questions, man. When I
[1:49:48] start studying scripture, I'm going to
[1:49:50] ask questions. I'm going to ask if there
[1:49:52] was a high priest, how many was they?
[1:49:55] How many? And and you know, it's
[1:49:56] beautiful. I'm glad for Josephus and
[1:49:58] historians that kept up with it. But
[1:50:00] there actually was about 83 high priests
[1:50:03] from the time of Aaron to the
[1:50:05] destruction of the temple in AD70. There
[1:50:07] was 83 of them that were anointed. There
[1:50:11] was 83 of them that anointed the and
[1:50:13] propituated for sin. There was 83 of
[1:50:15] them men that lived their lives. But let
[1:50:18] me say this, there wasn't none of them
[1:50:20] like Jesus.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; There was 83 of them. But Jesus was the
[1:50:25] last and the final of those high priest
[1:50:27] line because he mixed together the line
[1:50:31] of Judah with the line of Levi.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Now Paul is going to say that he's a
[1:50:38] high priest that can be touched by the
[1:50:41] feelings of the infirmities. Now here's
[1:50:42] the thing folks. What good is it to have
[1:50:45] this priest? What good is it to have
[1:50:47] this God if he is untouchable? If he is
[1:50:50] unreachable? If you can't touch him? If
[1:50:53] you can't talk to him, if you can't
[1:50:55] minister with him, what good is it to
[1:50:58] do? Now, when brother Brandham preaches
[1:51:00] this, and I I would say Hebrews 4:12 and
[1:51:02] Hebrews 4 and and and and 15 are some of
[1:51:05] the most preached of of of of things he
[1:51:08] proves. But, you know, in every time uh
[1:51:10] we can go to the scripture, let's go to
[1:51:12] Mark chapter 5. There's three places in
[1:51:14] the Bible that it tells a story of a
[1:51:17] woman approaching Jesus as a priest. In
[1:51:21] Mark chapter 5, the Bible says in the
[1:51:23] 25th verse, "And there was a certain
[1:51:25] woman which had an issue of blood for 12
[1:51:29] years. And she had suffered many things
[1:51:32] for because of the physicians and had
[1:51:35] spent all that she had. And nothing was
[1:51:38] bettered, but she grew worse." Now,
[1:51:40] here's the thing. This woman, Amen, been
[1:51:43] sick for 12 years, folks.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And she had suffered many things of
[1:51:46] physicians. Now, anybody ever been sick
[1:51:48] a long time? You know that if you can't
[1:51:50] get a doctor to tell you what to do, do
[1:51:52] you know there's some quack somewhere
[1:51:54] that'll take your money?
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; If you insist on being sick, there's
[1:51:58] some I told the church the other day,
[1:52:00] there's some homogenic, but I called it
[1:52:02] hallucenic.
[1:52:03] And I decided the only way it be
[1:52:05] hallucenic if you start smoking the
[1:52:07] herbs, you know. And then it don't be
[1:52:10] smoking the herbs. Come on.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; You You know what happens is is somebody
[1:52:16] somebody gets sick and then there's
[1:52:18] somebody that will offer you a remedy
[1:52:21] for your sickness. And this woman had
[1:52:23] been subject to many kinds of ideas
[1:52:27] because the Bible says by the time she's
[1:52:29] here 12 years in that she suffered many
[1:52:32] things of physicians and she ain't got
[1:52:34] any money left.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; But her condition has gotten worse
[1:52:39] rather than better.
[1:52:42] Now, now, amen. I I'm, if you go into
[1:52:45] the records of the Tamud, Amen, they
[1:52:47] actually speak of the issue of blood,
[1:52:48] which was what was wrong with this
[1:52:50] woman. And they they would have mixtures
[1:52:52] and they would actually one of the one
[1:52:54] of the cures was they would mix ashes
[1:52:56] with ostrich eggs and wine.
[1:52:59] One of them was they would carry certain
[1:53:01] herb like an onion or loom and they'd
[1:53:03] tie it in a cloth as a charm and carry
[1:53:06] it around with. Can you imagine
[1:53:07] Israelites carrying charms for healing?
[1:53:11] Amen. Carrying little little crystals,
[1:53:13] you know, and little rocks and burning
[1:53:15] little incenses and things. A Christian,
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; somebody believes in one God is turning
[1:53:21] to that kind of thing for the healing of
[1:53:23] their bodies.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now it's a it's
[1:53:28] superstitious. Some of them would sit in
[1:53:30] the crossroad with a glass of wine and
[1:53:32] have somebody frighten them believing
[1:53:34] that it would frighten the the problem
[1:53:36] away from them. 12 years of an issue of
[1:53:38] blood. Amen. Means that a woman was
[1:53:40] bleeding consistently for 12 years.
[1:53:43] Amen. And and now the cost was big.
[1:53:46] Amen. And they they actually gave them I
[1:53:48] I took some direct uh I took some direct
[1:53:51] recipes out of their books. Amen. That
[1:53:53] you take the gum of Alexandria and
[1:53:55] aluminum of crocs and weight of zuks
[1:53:58] each and let them be brushed together
[1:53:59] and given in wine. And then there was
[1:54:01] some superstitious charms and things
[1:54:03] that you would go with them. Amen. It
[1:54:05] gives you idea that this woman had went
[1:54:08] through many different kinds of medical
[1:54:11] practices and still she was just as sick
[1:54:14] as she ever was.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the the the scripture says
[1:54:19] financially ruined and weak. That's what
[1:54:22] she was. But the Bible is telling us and
[1:54:24] I just want to read from Mark because
[1:54:26] Mark actually gives us a little more
[1:54:27] in-depth reading. Amen. But it says here
[1:54:30] that that she had spent all she had and
[1:54:33] was nothing bettered but grew worse. But
[1:54:36] when she heard of Jesus,
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. She came in the press behind and
[1:54:43] touched his garment. Now, here's a woman
[1:54:46] 12 years in this sickness. And brother
[1:54:49] Bam describes her table was full of
[1:54:51] doctor's bills. She was without a hope.
[1:54:53] She had tried everything. She'd been
[1:54:54] turned down everywhere. She spent all of
[1:54:57] her money. Amen. And the Bible says,
[1:54:59] "But she heard of Jesus."
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; I tell you this. Amen. I remember when I
[1:55:06] heard of Jesus.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, really heard of Jesus. Amen. Do
[1:55:10] you know my Bible said that's where
[1:55:11] faith comes from? That faith comes from
[1:55:14] the hearing of the word of God. Look,
[1:55:17] faith is not going to come, Amen, by
[1:55:20] watching television or or searching
[1:55:22] Facebook or or ramping up your social
[1:55:24] media. That's not where faith comes.
[1:55:27] Faith comes by the preaching of the word
[1:55:29] of God. Can I can I just help you a
[1:55:32] moment? If you find yourself sick and
[1:55:34] you find yourself without faith, if you
[1:55:37] have no faith, God has set things that
[1:55:40] everything that he has comes through
[1:55:42] faith. So if you don't have faith, you
[1:55:45] say, "Where can I get some?"
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not healing you're looking
[1:55:50] for. It's not salvation you're looking
[1:55:53] for. You're looking for faith. Because
[1:55:55] if you can get faith, then you can get
[1:55:58] healing. Then you can get salvation. And
[1:56:00] faith cometh by the hearing of the word
[1:56:03] of God.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; So when you begin to hear the word of
[1:56:06] God, it begins to bring a reality to
[1:56:09] God. It begins to bring substance into
[1:56:12] things that you have hoped for. There is
[1:56:14] something here tonight I'm more sure of
[1:56:16] than I ever have been in my life of
[1:56:18] anything. Faith is the victory for the
[1:56:21] church of the living God. If you can
[1:56:23] ever get faith, you can get a victory
[1:56:26] over whatever it is that is troubling
[1:56:28] your life. Now, this woman, Amen, she
[1:56:31] had heard of Jesus. Now, have you ever
[1:56:34] wondered what it was she might have
[1:56:36] heard?
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Now, what what has a woman in this
[1:56:39] condition heard that's got her this
[1:56:41] stirred up
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; that she won't be stopped? She can't be
[1:56:45] settled down. She's all stirred up
[1:56:47] believing she's going to get a healing.
[1:56:49] Well, according to scripture, there is
[1:56:51] things that had happened before she had
[1:56:54] ever met Jesus. This is some of the
[1:56:56] stuff she heard in Mark chapter 1. She
[1:56:59] had heard about a leper, amen, that came
[1:57:01] to Jesus kneeling to him and saying,
[1:57:04] "Lord, if thou wil, you can make me
[1:57:07] clean."
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Jesus moved with
[1:57:11] compassion, put his hand upon him, and
[1:57:14] saith unto him, I will be thou made
[1:57:17] clean. And he spoke and immediately
[1:57:20] leprosy had departed him. And then Jesus
[1:57:22] said unto him, "Go show yourself to the
[1:57:25] priest and have an offering made for
[1:57:27] your leprosy." Do y'all know that
[1:57:29] leprosy had no cure?
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; How many knows there's only one place in
[1:57:33] Bible leprosy was healed of was the Old
[1:57:35] Testament. Amen. When Elijah healed,
[1:57:38] Amen. the leprosy in the Old Testament.
[1:57:40] And from that day all the way to Jesus,
[1:57:43] there had been no healing of leprosy.
[1:57:45] And one moment in the presence of this
[1:57:48] man Jesus and leprosy was healed when he
[1:57:51] touched that leper.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you you think you think they
[1:57:55] kept that quiet?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Do you think that leper got healed and
[1:58:00] he kept that quiet? The Bible says it
[1:58:02] like this. He went out and began to
[1:58:05] publish it much more. And he began to
[1:58:08] blaze it abroad in so much that Jesus
[1:58:11] could no more openly enter the city but
[1:58:14] without in the deserts. And they came to
[1:58:16] him from every quarter. He got so
[1:58:19] popular because of the healing of that
[1:58:21] leprosy. They couldn't even let him come
[1:58:24] in the city no more.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; That's a popular preacher, folks.
[1:58:31] Come on now. I know we got some of these
[1:58:33] end time preachers got jealousy all over
[1:58:35] them. And if you know if a man gets
[1:58:36] known a little bit, they oh they all
[1:58:38] they can preach about is the big
[1:58:39] preacher, you know. Well, I tell you
[1:58:40] what, there's a lot of men that couldn't
[1:58:41] never went and heard Jesus
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; cuz he was so popular. Amen. That the
[1:58:46] city, he couldn't even walk out in
[1:58:48] public among them.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Well, it's free. You don't have to
[1:58:52] believe it.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The leper, amen, that was full of
[1:58:56] prophet uh pull before of this. God
[1:58:59] began to speak of him and the leprosy
[1:59:02] was vanished. Do you see this was a cure
[1:59:04] that only God could do? There was a man
[1:59:07] with an unclean spirit while Jesus was
[1:59:09] preaching in the Sabbath. He was
[1:59:11] preaching in there and he was they was
[1:59:13] astonished at his doctrine. And while he
[1:59:15] was preaching, he discerned an unclean
[1:59:16] spirit. And when he began to preach, he
[1:59:19] said unto him that he rebuked the spirit
[1:59:22] and said, "Come out of him." And Amen.
[1:59:24] And the Bible said the unclean spirit
[1:59:27] left the man and he cried aloud and came
[1:59:30] out. Now they were all amazed. What kind
[1:59:33] of doctrine is this that has this kind
[1:59:35] of authority? Amen. Immediately the
[1:59:38] Bible says, "His fame spread abroad
[1:59:42] throughout the region round about
[1:59:44] Galilee." So the touch of him cleaned
[1:59:47] the leper. The voice of him, Amen, spoke
[1:59:50] and cleaned the spirit of the unclean.
[1:59:53] There was a widow coming out. Only son
[1:59:55] she had. They're packing him in the
[1:59:57] funeral. Amen. And as they pack him
[1:59:59] along, they come by Jesus. Amen. And
[2:00:02] Jesus never goes to a funeral, folks,
[2:00:04] because nobody stays dead. And when
[2:00:07] Jesus just spoke to the child and told
[2:00:09] him to get up and immediately the child
[2:00:13] was resurrected and went home with his
[2:00:15] mama, the Bible said, "And the rumor of
[2:00:18] him went throughout all of the region."
[2:00:21] This is some of the things this woman
[2:00:24] was hearing. She just heard about a
[2:00:26] sinful woman that was a harlot that had
[2:00:29] just went and got a box of alabaster and
[2:00:31] went down to Jesus and found him not
[2:00:34] being worshiped. And she began to pour
[2:00:36] that anointing oil out upon Jesus. Do
[2:00:39] you know the Bible tells us something?
[2:00:41] It tells us that this woman was of an
[2:00:43] ill fame. Amen. And she went actually
[2:00:46] behind Jesus. Amen. And washed his feet
[2:00:49] behind him instead of in front of him. I
[2:00:51] wonder why.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; I wonder if she wasn't a little ashamed
[2:00:54] of who she was and what life she had.
[2:00:57] But that woman that was washing Jesus's
[2:01:00] feet had heard from another woman that
[2:01:04] had been caught in adultery that they
[2:01:06] had brought her and put her at the feet
[2:01:08] of Jesus. And this little woman had been
[2:01:11] told of Jesus, "Now look lady, I know
[2:01:14] you done wrong. And these Pharisees are
[2:01:16] here to bomb you. They want to stone
[2:01:18] you." And Jesus looked at all of them
[2:01:20] and said this. He said, "Look." He said,
[2:01:22] "Now, now you that ain't got a a sin in
[2:01:24] you, I want you to cast the first
[2:01:26] stone." And they all dropped their
[2:01:28] stones and they went home. And Jesus
[2:01:31] looks at the woman and he said, "Neither
[2:01:33] do I accuse thee. Go and sin no more."
[2:01:37] And this woman left the feet of Jesus,
[2:01:40] ran down to the house of the ill fame
[2:01:43] and begin to say, "If you ever get a
[2:01:45] chance,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; if you ever get an opportunity,
[2:01:49] you get to the feet of that man, it's
[2:01:52] where harlots, amen, get their
[2:01:54] reputation changed."
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:58] And while that little woman was washing
[2:02:00] the feet of Jesus, the Bible said that's
[2:02:02] when Simon, he said, if he knew who she
[2:02:04] was. And Jesus looks up at him knowing
[2:02:06] his thoughts. And he looks at the woman
[2:02:08] and he said,"Simon, I've been in your
[2:02:11] house and you hadn't anointed me with
[2:02:12] oil. You ain't greeted me with a kiss.
[2:02:14] You ain't welcomed me in here. But since
[2:02:16] this woman came in, all she has done is
[2:02:20] worship at my feet." And he says to
[2:02:22] her,"Woman, thy sins be forgiven thee."
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; There's a great mystery. I won't preach
[2:02:29] all night, folks, but there's a great
[2:02:30] mystery laying there. That woman had an
[2:02:32] awful reputation.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; But that bunch of preachers and
[2:02:36] Pharisees were trying to make Jesus look
[2:02:38] like a fanatic.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; And that woman ruined their plan
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; because everybody had come under the
[2:02:47] influence. Oh, that man's just a pro.
[2:02:49] God don't Hey, God don't have prophets.
[2:02:51] See, they believed he was a healer but
[2:02:53] not a prophet. He couldn't forgive sins.
[2:02:55] Right? That was in that day. Amen. And
[2:02:57] but yet this woman believed that Jesus
[2:03:00] was still a prophet. She believed he was
[2:03:02] the Messiah. So what she done by washing
[2:03:05] his feet is she cleaned up the
[2:03:08] reputation of him saying he is the
[2:03:11] Messiah. This is the right one. He is
[2:03:14] the fulfillment of scriptures. But
[2:03:16] brother, while she started washing his
[2:03:19] feet, she took his reputation on her
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; in so much that Jesus said, "Anytime you
[2:03:28] preach the gospel, you tell this story."
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; I've often thought about that. Can you
[2:03:35] imagine this bunch of starchy people in
[2:03:37] the last days? They got to read about
[2:03:39] that in the middle of the starchy
[2:03:41] churches. Amen. And Jesus made it so
[2:03:43] this woman would condemn every person
[2:03:46] that ever heard the gospel that didn't
[2:03:48] worship Jesus Christ.
[2:03:51] That's the kind of thing this woman had
[2:03:53] begun to hear. She had began to hear
[2:03:55] about it. And you say, "Preacher, why
[2:03:57] does that make a difference?" I left my
[2:03:59] subject. Why does that make a
[2:04:01] difference? Because every one of them
[2:04:03] people was unclean.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; That leper was unclean. That harlot was
[2:04:09] unclean. Amen. Every one of them that I
[2:04:12] just read about was unclean. And they
[2:04:15] touched Jesus.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; It was forbidden for a high priest to
[2:04:21] touch an unclean person and remain clean
[2:04:24] himself.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; But this little woman
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; that had an issue of blood
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; had heard of them. and she heard he was
[2:04:33] passing by because somebody, amen, had
[2:04:36] told her that Gerus's daughter is dying
[2:04:40] and they have sought the rabbi and he's
[2:04:42] going to come right by your
[2:04:43] neighborhood.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now you you that like to
[2:04:47] really read in the scripture, what's
[2:04:49] going on is Jesus is coming for the
[2:04:51] resurrection.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; And while he's on his way to the
[2:04:56] resurrection, he is demonstrating that
[2:04:58] he's the high priest.
[2:05:01] Come on.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a second coming. Now
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; he's coming. He There's a resurrection
[2:05:05] coming. But on his way to the
[2:05:08] resurrection, he's going to prove to
[2:05:10] this Leodysian church. And he's still
[2:05:13] the same high priest that can be touched
[2:05:16] by the feeling of infirmities. And look
[2:05:18] what happens. This woman being unclean
[2:05:20] as she is because she's bleeding. It's
[2:05:22] an unclean. I I got the scriptures if
[2:05:24] you need them. She's she's completely
[2:05:26] unclean. And this woman, knowing she has
[2:05:29] no right to touch him, sees him passing
[2:05:32] by. Now, here's the thing, folks. Amen.
[2:05:35] Everybody's around. This is a big crowd.
[2:05:37] This is pressing there. That she can't
[2:05:39] just have a moment with him by herself.
[2:05:42] But because of the way things is, I This
[2:05:45] is just my thought because she says the
[2:05:47] Bible says she come from behind. I bet
[2:05:49] she might have copied that from that
[2:05:50] other woman. If I could just sneak up, I
[2:05:54] could just sneak in. And watch what she
[2:05:56] did. She said, "If I could just touch
[2:05:59] the hymn."
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you're a if you're a
[2:06:03] student of scripture, Jesus's robe would
[2:06:06] have had fringe upon the corners of it,
[2:06:09] which in the Old Testament was a
[2:06:11] requirement that they wore a border on
[2:06:14] their garment and it would have a blue
[2:06:16] wrapped in the needle work. Now, I got
[2:06:18] pictures and everything, but let me just
[2:06:19] just trust me. It was there and they was
[2:06:22] a hung off. Now, Jesus would have wore a
[2:06:24] robe over his clothes. It would be like
[2:06:26] a like a robe all the way down and off
[2:06:28] of that robe would have hung that
[2:06:30] border. Amen. So this woman believed
[2:06:33] that she could slip in there with such a
[2:06:35] crowd and she could get a hold of that
[2:06:37] garment and he wouldn't never know that
[2:06:41] she had been touching him. But she knew
[2:06:43] there was healing in this man. I'm not
[2:06:46] worthy. See, I'm not worthy that he
[2:06:48] would know about me, but I need him so
[2:06:51] bad. I' I'm 12 years in my problem and I
[2:06:54] I if I could just if I could just if I
[2:06:57] could just touch it now now look folks
[2:06:59] here here here's something powerful
[2:07:01] because what that border represents is
[2:07:04] the covenant of Abraham
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and in that border is the law of Moses
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; you know brother forest I remember many
[2:07:15] years ago you preached on that broaden
[2:07:18] of border and the felactories that were
[2:07:20] increased Amen. And you went back there
[2:07:22] with David. I never will forget it. And
[2:07:25] and you talked about how David snuck
[2:07:27] into Saul. And what what he did is is
[2:07:30] they said to David, "You should kill
[2:07:32] Saul." Amen. And David said, "No, I
[2:07:34] can't touch the Lord's anointed." So he
[2:07:37] cut off the the hymn.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; He cut off the border. Amen. And he went
[2:07:42] out there the next morning and held it
[2:07:44] up and said, in other words, Saul, had
[2:07:46] it not been for this law that I can't
[2:07:49] touch God's anointing, there was the
[2:07:51] reason he couldn't kill Saul, hold it in
[2:07:54] his hand. It was a memory.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And that woman was looking at a memorial
[2:08:00] that the unclean can't touch a high
[2:08:02] priest. But what she did is she saw
[2:08:05] Jesus as more
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; than just a Levitical high priest. She
[2:08:10] saw him in a higher level. She began to
[2:08:13] realize this is the one.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; This is the priest that's going to
[2:08:17] mingle the offices. God has come down
[2:08:20] among us. And she reached out and and
[2:08:23] she reached out and she touched that
[2:08:26] hymn. Now, I want you to watch
[2:08:27] something. She's 12 years, folks.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; How many
[2:08:32] How many ever been sick?
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; How many ever been sick? You
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; ever been sick a long time?
[2:08:40] 12 years is 4,383 days.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; 4,000 days.
[2:08:49] It's 105,000
[2:08:51] hours.
[2:08:55] 6,000 or 6,311
[2:08:59] 520
[2:09:00] minutes.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Have you ever took an ibuprofen and
[2:09:03] waited 30 minutes for it to kick in?
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; That is a long
[2:09:08] 30 minutes.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Have you ever been in severe pain?
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had real pain
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; and somebody gave you some medication
[2:09:18] and and and and they and you say, "Give
[2:09:19] me some medication." They say they say,
[2:09:21] "Well, we gave it to you." And and and
[2:09:23] that 30 minute span, you know how long
[2:09:25] that 30 minutes is?
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; That 30 minutes was 6,311
[2:09:31] minutes for that woman.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; She had been sick a long time, brother.
[2:09:37] and and her sickness had not only made
[2:09:39] her sick, but it made her unclean where
[2:09:42] she couldn't go into the presence of
[2:09:44] God.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; But in that border, she began to realize
[2:09:48] right here it is. Here's the end of 12
[2:09:51] years. Here's the end of my problems.
[2:09:53] Here's the end of my struggles.
[2:09:57] Finally, brother Joe. Finally.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Finally, there's a priest that me being
[2:10:04] unclean will not defile him. Let me say
[2:10:07] this to you tonight. The most unclean
[2:10:10] person in here could never defile Jesus
[2:10:13] Christ. He can take unclean and he can
[2:10:16] make you clean. I don't care what your
[2:10:18] trouble is tonight. I don't care how big
[2:10:20] of a sinner you are tonight, what
[2:10:22] struggles you've had in life. He's a
[2:10:24] high priest. that you cannot defile him.
[2:10:28] If you would touch him, he makes you
[2:10:30] clean.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; 12 years. 12 years, brother. But in one
[2:10:38] moment,
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; in one moment in his presence, listen,
[2:10:42] you see how important it is tonight that
[2:10:44] if you could just touch him, 12 years,
[2:10:46] in one moment is ended.
[2:10:51] You said, "Brother Wayne, you know, we
[2:10:53] know we know healings take a long time."
[2:10:56] Not always.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Not always.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed for Peter's mother-in-law.
[2:11:01] She had a fever and the Bible said she
[2:11:04] got up from the bed and went in and
[2:11:05] started cooking for him
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; because she was immediately healed.
[2:11:10] There was a paralyzed man and some
[2:11:12] friends had him and there was a meeting
[2:11:14] that they couldn't get into. And
[2:11:15] brother, they thought, if we could just
[2:11:17] get this man, if we could just get our
[2:11:19] friend in the presence of Jesus, and the
[2:11:21] Bible said they tore the roof off of the
[2:11:24] building to get the presence of God upon
[2:11:27] their friend. Let me tell you tonight,
[2:11:29] brother. Amen. If it takes tearing this
[2:11:31] tin up, we ought to get in the presence
[2:11:33] of God.
[2:11:35] If it takes shouting the cheers down, we
[2:11:38] ought to get in the presence of God. If
[2:11:40] it takes setting aside all the
[2:11:42] indifferences to get in the presence of
[2:11:44] God because one moment in the presence
[2:11:46] of God could change any person in this
[2:11:50] building. It doesn't matter what your
[2:11:52] past is. It doesn't matter what your
[2:11:54] lineage is. He is Jesus Christ the great
[2:11:59] and the mighty high priest.
[2:12:04] You ask that paraple that paralyzed man
[2:12:06] when he walked in there immediately the
[2:12:08] Bible said he rose up took up his bed
[2:12:11] and he walked off.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; There were two blind men in Jericho and
[2:12:16] Jesus touched their eyes.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; And immediately they were healed.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; There was a deaf and a mute man that
[2:12:24] Jesus pulled him aside and the Bible
[2:12:26] said the Lord put his fingers in his
[2:12:29] ears. Yeah.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Then he spit on the ground.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Stick out your
[2:12:37] tongue."
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; And he touched the man's tongue. And in
[2:12:40] the in Arabic, he said, he said, "Open."
[2:12:44] And what he did, the Bible said the
[2:12:46] man's ears opened up and he could hear.
[2:12:48] The strain was loose from his tongue and
[2:12:51] he could speak an immediate response to
[2:12:54] the commanding power of Almighty God.
[2:12:57] Because the one doing the commanding was
[2:12:59] the same one that created the body.
[2:13:01] Amen. He's the one right here tonight. A
[2:13:03] woman, a woman in the Bible was bent
[2:13:06] over. The Bible said for 18 years
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; and Jesus touched her
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; and immediately
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; she was strengthened.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Wayne, that's just Bible
[2:13:20] stories. Well, sits right there. Brother
[2:13:22] Dave Syler was down in Central America
[2:13:25] just a few years ago and a old preacher
[2:13:27] come through the prayer line at 25 years
[2:13:30] his back had just gotten like this. I
[2:13:33] just asked him to be sure I was telling
[2:13:34] the truth. He said, "Brother Wayne," he
[2:13:36] was bent over like this and he come
[2:13:38] through the prayer line. He said, "And I
[2:13:40] watched him as he started walking." He
[2:13:42] said, "By the time he got to the end of
[2:13:44] the prayer line, he just straightened
[2:13:46] right up and just walked right off
[2:13:49] because Jesus Christ is the same."
[2:13:52] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. You
[2:13:55] don't have to wait a hundred years. He's
[2:13:57] a God and he's a healer in this building
[2:14:00] tonight. He's a creator. He's the
[2:14:03] almighty God.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; No, I'm talking about Jesus.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a mighty God.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Can go. It can go years, brethren. It
[2:14:16] can go years. I'm just sitting here
[2:14:18] tonight. We're blessed tonight to have
[2:14:20] some folks all the way up from Louisiana
[2:14:22] here. Brother Brother Mike War and his
[2:14:24] sister Ra Rachel, his wife sitting
[2:14:26] there, his daughters in our our church
[2:14:28] back home, Sister Kimberly, you know,
[2:14:30] years ago, I went down to brother
[2:14:32] brother Tim Puit and preached a meeting
[2:14:33] on a Wednesday night have mercy. It's a
[2:14:36] Wednesday night prayer meeting. Amen.
[2:14:38] And we preached a little while and I
[2:14:40] ended up on the 11th hour. People get
[2:14:42] the same pay as the first hour people
[2:14:44] does. Amen. Brother Tim called a prayer
[2:14:46] line. Amen. We prayed till the 11th
[2:14:48] hour. Amen. It was a late prayer line
[2:14:50] that night and their daughter came in
[2:14:53] that prayer line. Sister Kimberly come
[2:14:55] up there and said, "Brother Wayne, I am
[2:14:57] desiring of my brother Justin that he
[2:14:59] would get saved."
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; And and we and we prayed an earnest
[2:15:02] prayer knowing the Bible makes a promise
[2:15:04] concerning these things that if thou
[2:15:06] believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ, thy
[2:15:08] and thy house shall be saved. And we
[2:15:11] begin to pray. Well, you know what? We
[2:15:13] the prayer line just kept going a little
[2:15:15] while. Amen. And after about a half
[2:15:17] hour, amen, I hear the awful bunch of
[2:15:20] shouting and rejoicing down there and I
[2:15:22] look over and Brother Tim taps me on the
[2:15:24] shoulder and he points over to the side.
[2:15:26] He said, "Brother, Wayne, you see that
[2:15:28] boy right there?" He had a messed up
[2:15:30] hair like he'd been in bed, you know?
[2:15:32] He's still mostly in his in his uh
[2:15:34] sweats and stuff like he climbed out of
[2:15:35] bed. He said, "That boy is the man you
[2:15:39] just prayed for about a half hour ago
[2:15:41] that he was going to that she wanted to
[2:15:42] see him get saved."
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:15:46] What happened right there? He says he
[2:15:48] can he can testify to you, brother.
[2:15:50] That's his daddy right there. That boy
[2:15:52] was at home in bed and he woke up. His
[2:15:55] parents wasn't home. So, he was
[2:15:57] wondering, "Why are they out so late?"
[2:15:59] So, don't you ever despise a late a late
[2:16:02] uh church meeting.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Why are they out there so late? And he
[2:16:07] got to thinking, "I wonder if I've
[2:16:09] missed the rapture. Folks ain't home."
[2:16:11] So he so he looks over and the neighbor
[2:16:13] and they're they're believers and they
[2:16:15] gone and he calls somebody and they're
[2:16:18] gone. So he says, "Good Lord, I I'm
[2:16:21] missing the rapture." So he goes out and
[2:16:23] gets in his car, his truck, and and
[2:16:26] speeds to church. Amen. Amen. He's so
[2:16:29] convinced he's going to miss the
[2:16:30] rapture. Amen. He runs through a guy's
[2:16:32] fence out in the cow pastor. He messes
[2:16:34] up his transmission. Matter of fact,
[2:16:36] when he pulls up to the church parking
[2:16:38] lot, that truck never moved. They had to
[2:16:41] haul it down there with a recorder.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; He come in that back room and as he
[2:16:46] walked into the church, he realized the
[2:16:49] church was still going on.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I ain't missed it after all.
[2:16:55] I'm going to give my life to God
[2:16:56] tonight." And he came down and give his
[2:16:58] life. He's now married and having
[2:17:01] children and a part of a good church.
[2:17:04] You know why? because he's a high priest
[2:17:07] that can be touched by the feeling of
[2:17:09] your infirmity.
[2:17:12] Who Who did Kimberly Wear touch? She
[2:17:16] didn't touch Wayne Lawson. She didn't
[2:17:17] touch Brother Brandom. She didn't touch
[2:17:19] him. She touched the high priest of our
[2:17:23] confessions.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; No, he is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:17:31] forever. I see brother Dave Hoffman
[2:17:33] sitting right back there in the back
[2:17:34] with his wife Debbie. I remember when we
[2:17:36] were just kids just got started in the
[2:17:38] ministry. A man named Joel Forny come by
[2:17:41] and it was a five-hour service. How many
[2:17:43] was in that meeting that night?
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; It started in the morning. Amen. But it
[2:17:48] was about a five-hour service and and
[2:17:50] brother Juel had preached and the and
[2:17:52] the spirit started moving and we started
[2:17:54] having a prayer line. I was standing
[2:17:55] there with him. Amen. And all of a
[2:17:57] sudden, Sister Debbie comes up in the
[2:18:00] prayer line. She had just been started
[2:18:02] coming back to the church and and she
[2:18:03] was just getting involved and she'd come
[2:18:05] up there and remember I remember like it
[2:18:07] yesterday. She said, "Brother Wayne, we
[2:18:09] want to I want to receive the baptism of
[2:18:11] the Holy Ghost."
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and God filled her with the
[2:18:16] Holy Ghost right there in that room. Now
[2:18:18] listen, it can happen immediate, folks.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest miracle ever happened
[2:18:22] to you is God to give you the Holy
[2:18:24] Ghost. She received the Holy Ghost, went
[2:18:27] back and sat down in her chair. And
[2:18:28] after a little while, Amen. In a minute,
[2:18:31] she showed back up in the prayer line.
[2:18:33] Amen. And she walks up and she says,
[2:18:34] talking to me and Brother Juwel, and she
[2:18:36] says, "Brothers," she said, "I, Amen,
[2:18:39] have got the Holy Ghost now." And she
[2:18:41] said, "I want to claim my family."
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And at that time, Amen. Her
[2:18:46] daughter, Amen, Carrie, Amen, was out in
[2:18:49] the world and she was mixed up in a
[2:18:51] situation that didn't look like she
[2:18:53] would ever get out of it. And we prayed
[2:18:55] over a prayer cloth that night. Amen.
[2:18:57] And she took that prayer cloth and put
[2:18:59] it under the pillow or under the sheets
[2:19:01] of that bed where Carrie slept every
[2:19:03] night. And after after a little while,
[2:19:06] amen, is Carrie starts throwing up at
[2:19:08] the church. She just starts coming,
[2:19:10] starts saying she don't know why, but
[2:19:12] she just felt like coming. And and I'm
[2:19:14] paraphrasing the story for speed, but
[2:19:16] I'll say this. Amen. I got to noticing
[2:19:18] her coming and coming and coming. And
[2:19:20] then one night in the middle of the
[2:19:21] night, she goes in there to make her bed
[2:19:22] or something. And when she does, she
[2:19:24] shakes it out and her and her
[2:19:26] handkerchief falls out in the floor and
[2:19:28] she don't know what that's doing there.
[2:19:31] So she calls her mama in there. What's
[2:19:33] that doing in there? Am I telling it
[2:19:35] right, David? Amen. What's that doing in
[2:19:37] there? And when her mama started telling
[2:19:39] her, Amen. She got under conviction and
[2:19:42] realized that the Holy Ghost had been
[2:19:44] dealing with her and she gave her life
[2:19:46] to Jesus Christ. And because of that
[2:19:49] night, there sets Amen. There sets some
[2:19:52] evidence right there. Let me see your
[2:19:53] hand right there. There's some evidence
[2:19:55] right there. Look right there at
[2:19:56] Anthony. There set some evidence right
[2:19:58] there.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; That wasn't That wasn't something that
[2:20:02] lasted five minutes. That wouldn't
[2:20:03] lasted 10 minutes. Amen. That's a
[2:20:06] salvation that is eternal. Listen, don't
[2:20:09] you look at a bunch of hypocrites to
[2:20:10] judge this message by. There are some
[2:20:13] real believers. There's some real sons
[2:20:16] or some real daughters of God that
[2:20:18] believe in the eternal salvation of
[2:20:21] Almighty God. He is the same yesterday,
[2:20:24] today and forever. Listen, let me tell
[2:20:26] you tonight that woman was touching the
[2:20:29] hem of his garment and Jesus stopped and
[2:20:32] said, "Who touched me?"
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Lord,
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; everybody's touching you,
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; but not like this.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Not like this.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; For somebody has taken virtue from me.
[2:20:50] Somebody has touched me. It wasn't her
[2:20:53] physical touch, folks. If you don't get
[2:20:56] nothing out of this, I want you to get
[2:20:57] this right here. It was not that
[2:21:00] physical touch.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; It was her faith
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; that touched that high priest that could
[2:21:07] turn her situation around. Now, why is
[2:21:10] that important tonight? Because Jesus
[2:21:12] ain't here in the physical body. His
[2:21:15] body is not walking around here. His his
[2:21:18] carnal body, his corporal body is in
[2:21:20] heaven. But you sitting here tonight
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; can touch that high priest the same as
[2:21:28] that woman did on that road that day.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:21:34] Now our Lord Jesus has sent this message
[2:21:36] among us with William Brandham a prophet
[2:21:41] to prove to this generation
[2:21:43] and he done it time and time and time
[2:21:47] again. He stood there in Africa and a
[2:21:50] crosseyed boy started up to the platform
[2:21:52] with a doctor and he got about 20 feet
[2:21:55] from the platform and his eyes comes
[2:21:57] come straight and the doctor ran up
[2:22:00] there and said to brother Brandham said
[2:22:01] what'd you do to him? What' you do to
[2:22:04] him? He's my patient. How did you fix
[2:22:06] his eyes? He said did you do h did you
[2:22:09] hypnotize the boy? He said if hypnotism
[2:22:12] heals the blind he said we ought to
[2:22:13] start practicing it. Amen.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "But for that matter," he said,
[2:22:17] "I didn't do nothing to the boy. He was
[2:22:19] 10 feet from me when he got healed." He
[2:22:21] said, "Who did he touch?"
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Who who did that?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. Amen. As as much
[2:22:29] as I love a prophet of God, he didn't
[2:22:31] save me.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't touch him.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; I touched the God that he was
[2:22:36] introducing me to.
[2:22:39] Your relationship tonight, Jesus Christ,
[2:22:42] the son of God, is just as alive and has
[2:22:46] been proven by this message to be real.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Can you sit in here tonight?
[2:22:56] You too can touch him.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; He never felt the physical touch,
[2:23:05] but her faith.
[2:23:07] And tonight, if you have faith,
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; 12 years,
[2:23:14] immediately
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; the blood dried up. 18 years bent over
[2:23:22] and her her back was healed.
[2:23:26] 38 years at a pool and he walked away
[2:23:31] holding his bed.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm talking about a God tonight,
[2:23:35] folks.
[2:23:36] Yeah.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Holy, undefiled, and unblameable. Can
[2:23:40] our musicians come tonight?
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; He's the same high priest.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; And he can be touched.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; You can touch him.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Don't forget you can touch him.
[2:23:58] Don't forget it. When you're weary and
[2:24:00] you're tired and you're out of money,
[2:24:03] don't forget you can touch him.
[2:24:06] You can get a hold of God. Y'all
[2:24:07] remember when people used to get a hold
[2:24:08] of God?
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Remember they shut the door and they
[2:24:12] wouldn't come out till they got a hold
[2:24:13] of something
[2:24:15] and they'd sing him old songs, call him
[2:24:17] up.
[2:24:19] Call him up
[2:24:23] because they get a hold of God.
[2:24:27] Brother Bram tells the story of blind
[2:24:29] Barnameus how many times?
[2:24:32] And in every time he said he he reached
[2:24:35] out there and said, "Thou son of David,
[2:24:37] have mercy on me."
[2:24:42] Jesus could not hear him physically.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; He was 500 yards away.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't it wasn't the voice he
[2:24:53] heard. It was the cry of faith he heard.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; He can still hear your prayer.
[2:25:02] Somebody said, "Brother Wayne, I'm too
[2:25:03] unclean. You ain't too unclean for this
[2:25:05] priest.
[2:25:07] He's the kind of priest that you can
[2:25:10] make the most unclean to."
[2:25:14] And they'll walk away clean,
[2:25:17] brother.
[2:25:20] He walked down at the resurrection. That
[2:25:22] little girl had already died. Geras's
[2:25:23] daughter is dead.
[2:25:26] She was 12 years old.
[2:25:29] Isn't that that number 12 shows up right
[2:25:30] there?
[2:25:32] She was 12 years old.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know the Bible said she was
[2:25:37] unclean?
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; But not when he started talking.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Damn, arise."
[2:25:48] That's when the dead gets out of their
[2:25:50] beds.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; That's when the lame gets out of their
[2:25:53] chairs. That's when the deaf starts
[2:25:56] hearing.
[2:25:58] That's when the sinner gets saved
[2:26:01] is when they hear from Jesus. Listen, I
[2:26:03] want you to know tonight.
[2:26:06] You can touch him.
[2:26:09] You may feel like the weakest person in
[2:26:11] this building, but you can touch him.
[2:26:15] 12 years bleeding. She was weak.
[2:26:21] Probably worked out for her benefit.
[2:26:23] She was already on her hands and knees
[2:26:25] crawling.
[2:26:27] She was too weak to stand.
[2:26:30] If you're trying to sneak up on Jesus,
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; get down on your hands and knees alone.
[2:26:38] You can reach him there.
[2:26:41] You can touch him. You can touch him.
[2:26:43] Would you stand to your feet tonight?
[2:26:45] You can touch him.
[2:26:49] You can touch him.
[2:26:53] [Music]
[2:26:56] I'm so glad tonight
[2:27:01] before sitting there tonight and
[2:27:03] watching you sitting on that front row
[2:27:05] took me back a long time.
[2:27:08] [Music]
[2:27:11] It was somewhere in the late fall of
[2:27:16] 1994
[2:27:18] and Brother Force was preaching a
[2:27:20] sermon. It's a Wednesday night.
[2:27:23] I don't remember the sermon he was
[2:27:25] preaching about and he was shucking the
[2:27:28] corner.
[2:27:29] I was sitting there kind of about the
[2:27:30] front row
[2:27:35] and my aunt Brenda and my mama and my
[2:27:38] sister had been praying and fasting
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; that God would get a hold of me.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; And I come in there and sit down in that
[2:27:46] little church, that little doughnut shop
[2:27:47] over the edge. And I sat down there and
[2:27:49] I had the prettiest pair of Justin
[2:27:52] boots. Man, they were told up the side
[2:27:54] and brown. They're gorgeous boots.
[2:27:57] As long as you're looking at the tops.
[2:28:00] But I've wore them so long there was a
[2:28:02] hole about that big in the bottom.
[2:28:05] And I was a pridey little fella.
[2:28:08] And I was sitting there with them boots
[2:28:10] on. I sitting there all dressed best I
[2:28:11] could get. The preacher was preaching.
[2:28:14] The longer he preached the war worked on
[2:28:16] me.
[2:28:17] I didn't have church manners. I didn't
[2:28:19] know what they were.
[2:28:21] But after a little while, I kept feeling
[2:28:23] that draw. I kept feeling that draw. And
[2:28:24] that altar was just it was just about
[2:28:26] probably about this distance.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking, "That ain't far.
[2:28:32] That ain't far." And I I started to go
[2:28:33] and I'd sit back. I started to go and
[2:28:35] I'd sit down. He ain't calling for an
[2:28:36] alter call. He's preaching. And I'm
[2:28:39] ready to And I I kept doing this and in
[2:28:41] a minute something said to me, "You get
[2:28:43] down to that altar and they'll see the
[2:28:45] bottom of your boots.
[2:28:49] And all of a sudden, it was like
[2:28:51] something spoke to me. But this is your
[2:28:53] opportunity tonight.
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:28:57] And all of a sudden, I didn't care if
[2:28:59] anybody saw the bottom of my boots.
[2:29:02] I didn't care if anybody was embarrassed
[2:29:04] by me or nothing about it. The man of
[2:29:07] God wasn't even done preaching.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; And I crawled right up in that altar
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; and brother, I touched Jesus.
[2:29:16] I touched it.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's been more than 30 years ago.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know you can touch him?
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; You can touch him tonight.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our hearts together.
[2:29:35] Why don't you reach out to him now?
[2:29:38] You can touch him.
[2:29:42] If you don't know him tonight, won't you
[2:29:44] touch him in the way that he's the
[2:29:47] savior,
[2:29:48] you can reach out and touch him tonight?
[2:29:51] You're suffering with your body tonight.
[2:29:53] You're suffering and you're needing
[2:29:54] help. The doctors don't have the answers
[2:29:57] for you. Won't you just reach out and
[2:30:00] touch him? He was to pass by this way.
[2:30:04] He's on his way to the resurrection. And
[2:30:06] he made a prophesied appointment that he
[2:30:08] would come in this age.
[2:30:11] he would reveal himself among you. And
[2:30:14] here he is tonight in this building and
[2:30:16] and he's passing through this
[2:30:18] congregation. If you reach just reach
[2:30:20] out now with your faith and believe
[2:30:24] for the healing of your body. Maybe
[2:30:26] you're sitting here tonight. You got a
[2:30:28] wavered child out there. I'm telling
[2:30:30] you, he's a priest that can be touched
[2:30:32] for your family.
[2:30:34] He's proven that he can be touched to
[2:30:36] change families.
[2:30:39] You can touch him, too.
[2:30:42] You can make it tonight. Father, we bow
[2:30:45] our hearts in this building tonight. And
[2:30:49] Lord,
[2:30:51] I've used everything that I know to do
[2:30:53] to lift you.
[2:30:56] God, if I had a greater voice, I'd use
[2:30:58] it.
[2:31:00] If I had better examples, I'd use them.
[2:31:02] Lord,
[2:31:04] if I had better ability, I'd dedicate
[2:31:06] it. Lord,
[2:31:08] if I could be more sincere, I would.
[2:31:10] Lord,
[2:31:13] but oh God,
[2:31:15] help me tonight.
[2:31:17] Help me to to magnify to these people
[2:31:19] that you can be touched.
[2:31:22] I pray as you pass through this building
[2:31:24] tonight, Lord, that you would to hear
[2:31:26] the cry of the sick, that you would hear
[2:31:28] the cry of our young people, Lord,
[2:31:30] that's suffering with with anxieties and
[2:31:32] depressions, Lord. That you would hear
[2:31:34] them, Lord. You would hear them that's
[2:31:36] addicted to this pornography and their
[2:31:38] sexual temptations over their lives and
[2:31:41] they're trying to escape. Lord, just one
[2:31:43] touch tonight.
[2:31:46] Just one touch, just one brush from you,
[2:31:48] Lord,
[2:31:50] and immediately you can heal their
[2:31:52] issues, Lord. I pray as you pass through
[2:31:55] this building, Lord, that you'd touch
[2:31:57] every need.
[2:31:59] Now, we call upon you, great high
[2:32:01] priest.
[2:32:03] We offer this to you father in the name
[2:32:05] of Jesus Christ. Let it be according to
[2:32:08] your word.
[2:32:10] In Jesus name.
[2:32:12] In Jesus name.
[2:32:16] Amen. Brother may come and help me sing
[2:32:17] tonight.
[2:32:22] [Music]
[2:32:33] Little girl was lying there.
[2:32:36] People all were weeping.
[2:32:40] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[2:32:44] she's only sleeping.
[2:32:48] Then he took her by the hand.
[2:32:52] She began to live again.
[2:32:56] Some begin to praise the Lord. Some
[2:32:59] begin to sing.
[2:33:03] He's in the house.
[2:33:07] If has to flee.
[2:33:10] Now there is light.
[2:33:14] Darkness.
[2:33:18] Now there is hope.
[2:33:21] There's no more doubt.
[2:33:24] So I praise his name.
[2:33:29] Praise his name.
[2:33:33] He's in the house.
[2:33:38] We were like that little girl dead in
[2:33:42] all our sins.
[2:33:46] And Jesus touched this heart of mine.
[2:33:49] Gave me life again.
[2:33:53] I am just a house of flame.
[2:33:57] But ever since that blessed day,
[2:34:00] there's a light that shines in me for
[2:34:04] all the world to see.
[2:34:08] He's in the house.
[2:34:11] Death has to flee.
[2:34:14] And now there is light
[2:34:18] where darkness used to be.
[2:34:22] Now there is hope
[2:34:25] and there's no more doubt.
[2:34:28] So I'll praise his name.
[2:34:32] Praise his name.
[2:34:36] He's in the house.
[2:34:42] We are like that little girl dead in all
[2:34:46] our sins.
[2:34:49] Jesus touched this heart of mine, gave
[2:34:53] me life again.
[2:34:56] I am just a house of clay. But ever
[2:35:00] since that blessed day,
[2:35:03] there's a light that shines in me for
[2:35:06] all the world to see.
[2:35:10] He's in the house

[3:05:19] Yes, Lord, you're worthy.
[3:05:22] I declare him worthy of all my praise.
[3:05:29] Oh, you are worthy.
[3:05:32] Yes, you are worthy.
[3:05:36] You are worthy
[3:05:39] of all my praise.
[3:05:42] Lord, you never failed me. I say you're
[3:05:46] worthy.
[3:05:49] You never forsake me. Lord, I declare
[3:05:53] you worthy.
[3:05:55] When I turned my back on you, but you
[3:05:58] didn't turn your back on me, I say
[3:06:00] you're worthy.
[3:06:02] When I wanted to quit, but Lord, you
[3:06:04] came and you gave me faith and said, I
[3:06:07] say you're worthy.
[3:06:09] He is worthy.
[3:06:12] Oh Lord, you're worthy.
[3:06:16] You are worthy.
[3:06:19] You are worthy.
[3:06:22] I declare him worthy.

[3:06:29] Oh Lord, you're worthy.
[3:06:32] Yes, you are worthy.
[3:06:35] For my God is awesome.
[3:06:38] Yes, he is awesome.
[3:06:42] He is awesome.

[3:07:08] is why I'm living. So I praise your holy
[3:07:12] name.
[3:07:14] My God is awesome.
[3:07:18] He is awome.
[3:07:26] Is he awesome tonight? He is worthy.
[3:07:30] Amen. Won't you give the Lord a hand
[3:07:32] clap of praise?
[3:07:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[3:07:33] &gt;&gt; How many can declare him worthy?
[3:07:37] [Music]
[3:07:43] He's a king of kings. He's a high priest
[3:07:46] that can be touched by the feeling of
[3:07:48] our infirmities.
[3:07:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; He's been crowned.
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:07:52] &gt;&gt; As the greatest authority.
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; The greatest king, the greatest champion
[3:07:57] &gt;&gt; that has ever walked upon the earth.
[3:08:00] story tonight.
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; Ladies
[3:08:03] and gentlemen,
[3:08:05] [Music]
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; may I have your
[3:08:09] attention?
[3:08:11] I would like to introduce
[3:08:16] to you
[3:08:19] here in this corner
[3:08:23] of the good and the right
[3:08:27] stands a champion roared in white.
[3:08:34] His height exceeds the heavens
[3:08:38] and his weight outweighs the world.
[3:08:42] His reach reaches everywhere and his
[3:08:46] ages ever more.
[3:08:50] He is higher than the highest,
[3:08:55] greater than the grave.
[3:08:58] No one could ever take his crown away.
[3:09:04] He's more mighty than the mightiest and
[3:09:08] he reigns from above.
[3:09:13] He's the alltime
[3:09:16] undefeated
[3:09:17] undisputed
[3:09:19] champion
[3:09:21] of love.
[3:09:25] [Applause]
[3:09:27] Oh, he left his hometown
[3:09:32] to enter this arena just to raise his
[3:09:35] hands to victory for you and me.
[3:09:40] There was an angry crowd cried
[3:09:44] crucified.
[3:09:45] He who wore the crown and they gladly
[3:09:49] watched our champion go down. But let me
[3:09:54] tell you about one. But I will never
[3:09:57] count him out. Is there another one
[3:09:59] today? Cuz I'm a witness of the day her
[3:10:03] roles to proclaim. He's still champion
[3:10:07] of love.
[3:10:09] He is higher than the highest. He is
[3:10:14] greater than the great and no one will
[3:10:19] ever take his crown away.
[3:10:23] Oh, he's more mighty than the mightiest
[3:10:28] and he from above.
[3:10:32] He
[3:10:34] the all time undisputed,
[3:10:38] undefeated
[3:10:39] champion
[3:10:41] of love.
[3:10:44] Oh, I say
[3:10:48] he left his hometown
[3:10:51] to enter our arena for one purpose. He
[3:10:55] walked upon this earth to raise his
[3:10:58] hands in victory for you and me. How
[3:11:00] many can claim that? There's an angry
[3:11:02] crowd crying, "Crucify!
[3:11:06] Crucify him!"
[3:11:09] And they gladly watched our champion
[3:11:12] going down.
[3:11:14] put a crown of thorns on his head. If
[3:11:17] thou be the king of the kings, won't you
[3:11:19] come down off that cross and save
[3:11:21] yourself? But he never said a word. You
[3:11:24] know why? Because he had a purpose of
[3:11:26] dying on the cross of Calvary. It was to
[3:11:28] become the King of Kings and the Lord of
[3:11:31] Lords and the champion of all other
[3:11:33] throughout eternity. That he could shed
[3:11:36] his blood for you and I that we can
[3:11:38] stand in this hour and declare him
[3:11:40] worthy.
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; Take his crown. I say
[3:11:45] he's more mighty than the mightiest
[3:11:48] and he reigns from above.
[3:11:52] He's the all time undisputed,
[3:11:58] undefeated
[3:11:59] champion
[3:12:01] of love.
[3:12:05] Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of
[3:12:07] praise tonight? Is he your champion? Can
[3:12:10] you say, "He's my champion." Somebody go
[3:12:13] ahead and confess it out of your mouth.
[3:12:14] He's my champion.
[3:12:17] &gt;&gt; Tell you why. He had one purpose to walk
[3:12:20] upon this earth.
[3:12:21] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he robed himself in
[3:12:24] flesh.
[3:12:25] &gt;&gt; Took upon every temptation and every
[3:12:27] like manner of man for one purpose that
[3:12:29] you and I could be saved. That we could
[3:12:31] stand here in this generation as sons
[3:12:33] and daughters of God.
[3:12:37] &gt;&gt; He left his hometown.
[3:12:40] to enter our arena
[3:12:44] &gt;&gt; just to raise his hands.
[3:12:47] Victory. Somebody just say, "For me."
[3:12:49] For me,
[3:12:51] &gt;&gt; there was an angry crowd. And there
[3:12:53] still is. Cried crucified.
[3:12:56] He who wore the crown. And they gladly
[3:13:00] watched our champion go. But now, but
[3:13:04] there's one that won't. Oh, but I will
[3:13:07] never count him out cuz I'm a true
[3:13:11] witness.
[3:13:13] The day he rose to proclaim, he's still
[3:13:17] champion of love.
[3:13:20] He is higher than the highest. He's
[3:13:25] greater than the great and no one could
[3:13:30] ever take his crown away.
[3:13:34] Oh, he's more mighty than the mightiest.
[3:13:39] And he reigns from above.
[3:13:43] He's the all time
[3:13:46] undisputed,
[3:13:48] undefeated
[3:13:50] champion
[3:13:52] of love.
[3:13:56] Oh, he's the alltime
[3:14:00] undisputed,
[3:14:02] undefeated
[3:14:06] of love.
[3:14:08] Can you say it one more time? He's the
[3:14:12] alltime
[3:14:14] undisputed,
[3:14:16] undefeated
[3:14:17] champion
[3:14:19] of love.

[3:20:24] just love the Lord tonight. How many
[3:20:25] loves the Lord? Somebody praise the
[3:20:27] Lord. Somebody say, "You're worthy."
[3:20:31] Somebody just give him some praise.
[3:20:32] Somebody say, "Hallelujah." Somebody
[3:20:34] say, "Worthy is the lamb."
[3:20:39] You may have some great trials. You may
[3:20:41] have gone through some great battles.
[3:20:44] There all kinds of of things that the
[3:20:46] devil's put upon the church in this last
[3:20:48] age. Can I just speak honestly to you?
[3:20:51] He's done everything he can to bring
[3:20:54] division and to bring evil spirits into
[3:20:57] the bride of Jesus Christ. Can I tell
[3:20:59] you a secret? Let me let you in on a
[3:21:01] little secret. God's bride is a many
[3:21:04] membered body around the world. She's
[3:21:07] not defined by the walls of a church.
[3:21:09] She's not defined by the walls of a of a
[3:21:12] ministry of any man. But she's a many
[3:21:14] membered body around the world. And I'm
[3:21:16] glad that I'm one of them.
[3:21:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a part of it. and she
[3:21:20] ain't restricted where she can't have
[3:21:22] fellowship one with another. There may
[3:21:24] be some people that have that, but let
[3:21:25] me tell you what it is. It's a demon out
[3:21:27] of the pits of hell that's keeping away
[3:21:29] from a true victory in the gospel of
[3:21:31] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:21:32] &gt;&gt; It's a demon. Can I say that again? You
[3:21:34] can print me if you want to. It's a
[3:21:36] demon out of the pits of hell that would
[3:21:38] keep the children of God from having
[3:21:40] fellowship one with another and being
[3:21:42] able to rejoice in the word of God
[3:21:44] &gt;&gt; and put our shoulders together and and
[3:21:47] have fellowship with people of like
[3:21:48] precious faith. Yes, sir.
[3:21:50] &gt;&gt; One of these days there won't be any
[3:21:52] barriers. There won't be any walls. Men
[3:21:54] didn't make those. Don't look at the
[3:21:56] men. It was Satan that built the walls
[3:21:59] cuz he knows if he ever gets one, he
[3:22:01] can't hardly do nothing with them. And
[3:22:03] two, and now he's got his work cut out.
[3:22:05] And three, he had to call an army. When
[3:22:08] it got to four, he had to create more.
[3:22:10] When it got to five, he gave everything
[3:22:12] he had. And when everybody's together,
[3:22:15] Satan is defeated.
[3:22:16] &gt;&gt; Defeated.
[3:22:17] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this one. Even the
[3:22:18] weakest Christian gets down on their
[3:22:20] knees, he already knows he's defeated.
[3:22:21] No wonder he wants to divide us. The
[3:22:23] Bible says one can flee a thousand and
[3:22:25] two can flee 10,000. But I say, devil, I
[3:22:27] got news for you tonight. There ain't
[3:22:29] one, there ain't two, but there's a two
[3:22:31] or 300 that would gather around the word
[3:22:33] of God tonight and say, devil, you are
[3:22:35] defeated. There's healing. There's
[3:22:38] miracles that took place in this meeting
[3:22:40] because of the faith of God's children
[3:22:42] that came together to see the hand of
[3:22:44] God and to touch the hymn of his
[3:22:47] garment.
[3:22:48] And let me tell you this friends, one of
[3:22:51] these days all those walls will be torn
[3:22:53] down. I just feel free tonight. That's
[3:22:54] why we have a tent meeting. There ain't
[3:22:56] no walls anyway. It don't take nothing,
[3:22:58] brother Travis. He can kick that wall a
[3:23:00] little bit and it'll just fall down. It
[3:23:01] don't take much to knock it down,
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; but one of these days they'll all be
[3:23:05] gone.
[3:23:05] &gt;&gt; Your sickness will be gone. and every
[3:23:07] failure be gone. And you know what? I
[3:23:09] can say this. You got a right to confess
[3:23:11] it today. Can I sing this to you in the
[3:23:13] key of C as we get prepared? The sisters
[3:23:16] have a a dinner prepared for everybody.
[3:23:19] But I'm going to tell you this tonight.
[3:23:21] Well, I've
[3:23:23] got a feeling
[3:23:26] everything's going to be all right.
[3:23:30] Oh, I
[3:23:33] got a feeling
[3:23:35] everything's going to be all right.
[3:23:39] Oh, I
[3:23:42] got this feeling.
[3:23:44] Everything's going to be all right.
[3:23:49] [Music]
[3:23:54] You may let the devil
[3:23:57] [Music]
[3:24:04] [Music]
[3:24:13] back
[3:24:13] [Music]
[3:24:25] I can see now with a smile on his face
[3:24:30] telling all the people with his gentle
[3:24:33] grace. I
[3:24:36] got a feeling
[3:24:38] everything's going to be all right.
[3:24:42] Oh, I
[3:24:45] got this feeling.
[3:24:47] Everything's going to be all right.
[3:24:51] Oh, I
[3:24:54] got a feeling.
[3:24:56] Everything's going to be all right.
[3:25:00] Going to be all right. It'll be all
[3:25:03] right. It'll be all right.
[3:25:09] Well, a little boy named David went out
[3:25:12] to find a child and everybody laughed at
[3:25:16] such a funny little sight. He's a little
[3:25:19] shepherd boy armed only with a sling.
[3:25:23] But the high mighty Goliath seems such a
[3:25:26] puny little thing. But David said, "You
[3:25:29] come to me with spear and a sword, but I
[3:25:33] come to you in the name of the Lord."
[3:25:36] And he put in a stone and he gave it a
[3:25:40] sing. And when it left his hand, he
[3:25:44] began to sing. Well, I
[3:25:47] got a feeling
[3:25:49] that everything's going to be all right.
[3:25:53] Oh, I
[3:25:56] got a feeling
[3:25:58] that everything's going to be all right.
[3:26:02] Oh, I
[3:26:05] got a feeling that everything's going to
[3:26:09] be all right. Be all right.
[3:26:13] Be all right. Be all right. You got time
[3:26:17] for one more.
[3:26:21] And now for the greatest story of them
[3:26:24] all. My Jesus was a dying and hail of
[3:26:29] all. All the demons were rejoicing. They
[3:26:32] thought they'd won the war. But soon
[3:26:35] they would not be laughing anymore. On
[3:26:39] that first Easter morning when the sun
[3:26:41] woke up the earth and the cowards of the
[3:26:44] deep opened up to give birth, there came
[3:26:48] a resurrected savior with feeling in his
[3:26:51] wings. And now the horse of children
[3:26:55] rise and sing. But I
[3:26:58] got this feeling
[3:27:01] everything's going to be all right.
[3:27:05] Oh, I
[3:27:07] got a feeling
[3:27:10] everything's going to be all right.
[3:27:14] Oh, I
[3:27:16] got a feeling.
[3:27:19] Everything's going to be all right. Be
[3:27:23] all right.
[3:27:25] Be all right.
[3:27:27] Be all right.
[3:27:31] Oh, be all right. It'll be all right. I
[3:27:36] said it'll be all right.
[3:27:44] Amen.
[3:27:45] Amen. I believe it'll be okay.
[3:27:48] Over in the by and by. Amen.
[3:27:52] We're getting ready to go home.
[3:27:55] One of these days we'll have a meeting
[3:27:56] like this. We'll rapt you right out of
[3:27:58] here.
[3:27:58] &gt;&gt; Right out of here.
[3:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's the way I want to go.
[3:28:01] &gt;&gt; I know people worry about that and you
[3:28:03] know how am I going how am I going to go
[3:28:04] and my I don't want to be sick. I don't
[3:28:07] want to be old and you know I just
[3:28:08] assume I heard a guy say I if I had to
[3:28:11] die one way it had to be this way.
[3:28:12] That'd be the best way to go. I thought
[3:28:14] my I'm not preparing to die.
[3:28:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know what got people thinking
[3:28:17] like that. The way I want to go is I
[3:28:19] want to go like Enoch did that he walked
[3:28:21] so close to God that one day he took his
[3:28:23] own step on this earth and he walked
[3:28:25] right into glory.
[3:28:28] &gt;&gt; That promise is to somebody
[3:28:30] &gt;&gt; and I just choose to believe it.
[3:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love the Lord tonight?
[3:28:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, could you come and
[3:28:36] close us in a word of prayer? We have to
[3:28:38] announce uh tomorrow morning starting at
[3:28:41] 11:30. We have a youth gathering at the
[3:28:44] fellowship hall. have some games and
[3:28:46] things for all the young people. Uh so
[3:28:48] you're welcome to come uh and uh so come
[3:28:51] for fellowship. Our service tomorrow
[3:28:52] night, brother David Siler will be

[3:28:57] be at 6:00 p.m. at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow
[3:29:00] night. Um don't worry about the weather.
[3:29:02] We're going to watch the weather
[3:29:03] closely. Uh and if it looks like that we
[3:29:05] uh can't have it the church in the tent,
[3:29:08] then we're just going to move the church
[3:29:09] indoors. So all you folks that thought
[3:29:11] we're crazy for having a tent, which
[3:29:13] y'all aren't here because y'all's all
[3:29:14] here, so y'all don't think we're crazy,
[3:29:16] but but all them folks, they'll be
[3:29:18] satisfied. Maybe they'll show up
[3:29:19] tomorrow night. If it rains, it'd be a
[3:29:21] good reason for them to go in church.
[3:29:22] Then we'll see what excuse they had if
[3:29:24] it starts raining. But but if it rains
[3:29:27] us out, we'll just move indoors. We have
[3:29:29] church. Um we don't have as as much
[3:29:32] room. Uh we got we've got we can seat a

[3:29:37] Pretty crowded. and we've got some
[3:29:38] overflow room to accommodate everybody
[3:29:40] else we've made for meetings and things.
[3:29:42] So, um just don't worry about the
[3:29:44] weather and all that. Also then remember
