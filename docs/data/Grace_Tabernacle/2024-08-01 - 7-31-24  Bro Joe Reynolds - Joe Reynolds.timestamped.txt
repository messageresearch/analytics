[38:04] verse1 Hebrews chapter 9:1 says but
[38:07] Christ been come as an high priest of
[38:10] good things to come by a greater more
[38:13] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[38:16] that is a say not of this building
[38:19] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[38:21] but by his own blood he entered in once
[38:24] into the holy Place having obtained
[38:27] Eternal Redemption for us for if the
[38:31] blood of bulls and goats and Ashes of he
[38:33] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the
[38:36] purifying of the flesh how much more
[38:38] shall the blood of Christ who through
[38:40] eternal spirit offered up himself
[38:43] without a spot to God Purge your
[38:45] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[38:48] Living God and for this cause he is a
[38:51] mediator of a new testament that by
[38:54] means of death for the Redemption of
[38:56] transgressions that were under the first
[38:58] testament that which are called might
[39:00] receive the promise of the Eternal
[39:03] inheritance for where the Testament is
[39:06] there must also be the necessity by the
[39:08] death of the testator for The Testament
[39:11] of the force after man are dead
[39:13] otherwise is no strength at all while
[39:15] the testator liveth Revelation chapter
[39:20] 5 excuse me
[39:29] verse one says and I saw on the right of
[39:32] the him that sat on the throne a book
[39:34] written within on the backside sealed
[39:36] with Seven Seals and I saw a strong
[39:39] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[39:41] is worthy to open the book then loose
[39:43] the seals thereof and no man in heaven
[39:46] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[39:48] to open the book neither look thereon
[39:51] and John said I read much because no man
[39:53] was found worthy to open and read the
[39:55] book neither to look thereon
[39:58] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[40:00] not behold the L of the tribe of Judah

[58:42] sacrifice sometimes the same sacrifice
[58:45] over and over again there was no
[58:49] rest there was no
[58:52] peace but that same chapter says but
[58:55] this man offered up once and for
[58:59] all a sacrifice that the father accepted
[59:05] and he said if you're bued in him you
[59:09] are accepted if you're bued in him
[59:12] you're white as

[1:00:26] born and it takes
[1:00:30] over it turns our eyes a different
[1:00:37] direction

[1:00:41] cancelled that day at
[1:00:44] Calvary it it was all
[1:00:49] redeemed in that one
[1:00:52] body god brother say God look
[1:00:57] down upon the sacrifice brother the
[1:01:00] Caleb God looked down upon the body of
[1:01:04] Christ he said he saw both male and
[1:01:10] female the same word spoke of the groom
[1:01:15] speaks of the
[1:01:18] Bride see the first Adam seen Eve
[1:01:21] falling
[1:01:26] and Adam the Jared because his love for
[1:01:30] his
[1:01:31] sweetheart took sin upon
[1:01:35] himself knowing Brother David
[1:01:39] knowing but the second Adam seeing that
[1:01:43] we was
[1:01:44] lost and took our
[1:01:48] sins and became one with
[1:01:52] us hallelujah he took the punishment
[1:01:59] you've heard me say this before just
[1:02:01] like Muhammad Ali they say he'd get in
[1:02:04] the ring he was one of the greatest King
[1:02:07] at boxing there ever
[1:02:09] was he would take the beating he would
[1:02:11] take the punishment he would take the
[1:02:13] licks he would take the
[1:02:18] beating and then when he would win the
[1:02:20] prize he would come back and give the
[1:02:22] check to his sweetheart and the story
[1:02:25] says she didn't take one beating she
[1:02:28] didn't take one lick she didn't take one
[1:02:31] punishment but she's reaping the
[1:02:35] benefits of the king I say tonight
[1:02:39] church at Grace Tabernacle we're reaping
[1:02:43] the benefits of the king
[1:02:47] tonight we don't have to take the
[1:02:49] punishment he's already done it for
[1:02:52] us we're free because God examine the
[1:02:59] lamb
[1:03:03] Hallelujah do you love the
[1:03:06] Lord now Hebrews 9 and 15 says for this
[1:03:11] cause he's a mediator of a new testament
[1:03:16] that means death for the Redemption of
[1:03:19] the transgressions that were under the
[1:03:21] first testament which was called might
[1:03:23] receive the promise of eternal
[1:03:26] inheritance where is a testament a
[1:03:29] covenant that must also be the necessity

[1:03:35] testator now in a natural
[1:03:40] will a father May ride out his wheel and
[1:03:46] he begins to include his heirs or Sons
[1:03:50] or daughters and he begins to put it in

[1:03:56] attach your name to words or
[1:03:59] promises see the whe is written or typed
[1:04:03] out but the paper that it's written on
[1:04:07] is not what's
[1:04:09] important it's actually the
[1:04:12] contents of the wheel and he takes that
[1:04:16] wheel he writes it out and he places a
[1:04:19] seal upon
[1:04:22] it and that will stays sealed to the
[1:04:27] death of the
[1:04:30] testator and then the
[1:04:33] executive has the
[1:04:35] authority to break the
[1:04:39] seal and read the
[1:04:42] contents of the
[1:04:44] wheel when the wheel is about to be
[1:04:49] read I'm just now getting to the good
[1:04:51] stuff

[1:46:36] it I believe you we we have a purpose
[1:46:38] brother Mark to come and magnify the
[1:46:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ here what
[1:46:43] a what a a thought tonight that the Lamb
[1:46:46] of God had paid the price for every
[1:46:49] every sin and every mistake that we made
[1:46:51] and you know brother Jo was preaching I
[1:46:53] got to thinking about how it was in the
[1:46:56] in the old days when a young man would
[1:47:00] do something that he shouldn't do and
[1:47:02] maybe have some sin in his life and you
[1:47:05] know what he would find himself doing he
[1:47:07] would go to his father and the father of
[1:47:09] the house he would go out seeking for a
[1:47:12] lamb that was worthy of a
[1:47:15] sacrifice every time there was a failure
[1:47:17] daddy'd had to go out and search for
[1:47:19] another lamb but you know he's talking
[1:47:21] about that tonight how that the price
[1:47:24] was paid and but Mark you what we
[1:47:26] realize is that God don't have to go
[1:47:27] looking for a lamb that the lamb has
[1:47:30] already been found before the foundation
[1:47:33] of the world he picked the lamb in so
[1:47:35] much that whenever Jesus came walking
[1:47:37] upon the shores of the Jordan River John
[1:47:39] said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh
[1:47:42] away the sin of the world he was
[1:47:44] identified before he ever went to the
[1:47:45] cross of Calvary and if he is identified
[1:47:48] before them well brother Ben he was
[1:47:49] identified before you and I before any
[1:47:52] sin before any mistake before any error
[1:47:55] any iniquity that would abound in our
[1:47:57] life that he was already been identified
[1:47:59] as a spotless lamb and the price was
[1:48:02] paid you know what tells me Daddy don't
[1:48:04] have to go looking for a lamb to pay the
[1:48:06] price for you the price has already been
[1:48:08] paid the only thing he goes looking for
[1:48:10] is he goes looking for us and he finds
[1:48:12] us in our trouble he finds us in our
[1:48:14] mistakes he finds us in the Blackness of
[1:48:16] our lives and he brings us to the cross
[1:48:18] of Calvary and says there's a price
[1:48:20] that's already been paid on your behalf
[1:48:22] I thank God that that God ain't looking
[1:48:24] for a lamb daddy ain't looking for a
[1:48:26] lamb to cover your sin he's looking for
[1:48:29] you to bring you to Calvary and show you
[1:48:31] that the price has been paid how many
[1:48:33] would heed to the call of God say Lord
[1:48:35] I'm glad you found me I'm glad you found
[1:48:37] me when you went out searching for me he
[1:48:39] found me in the middle of my trouble and
[1:48:41] he brought me to the cross of Calvary
[1:48:44] amen I believe we have a right to
[1:48:46] magnify the name of the Lord amen won't
[1:48:48] somebody magnify his name tonight

[1:51:04] me come
[1:51:06] exalt his name
[1:51:12] forever oh taste and
[1:51:15] see that the Lord is
[1:51:19] good and blessed is he
[1:51:24] who
[1:51:24] hides in
[1:51:28] him amen won't you give the Lord a hand
[1:51:30] clap of praise tonight freedom to
[1:51:33] worship amen isn't he wonderful amen we
[1:51:36] have a place to hide in tonight amen we
[1:51:39] just want to remember uh Brother David
[1:51:41] mcgard asked the church to uh remember
[1:51:44] him in prayer and I meant to mention it
[1:51:46] earlier and slipped my mind but uh he
[1:51:48] has got recalled on his on his job to
[1:51:51] work the hour he was working a couple
[1:51:53] years ago and so uh without trying to
[1:51:56] explain it all but there's a there's a
[1:51:58] position on the the job that would allow
[1:52:00] him to be in church on uh and and not
[1:52:02] have to worry about being called out and
[1:52:04] so he's basically on call and and uh you
[1:52:07] have to get so many uh starts in in
[1:52:09] order to be able to to keep the job and
[1:52:11] so um he had all those over the last few
[1:52:14] weeks and so he just asked the church to
[1:52:16] remember in prayer that they could move
[1:52:17] him to the other uh position on the job
[1:52:20] that he'd be able to be uh back in
[1:52:21] service and so I I believe that God is
[1:52:23] mindful of that I believe that we ought
[1:52:25] to be in church and we ought to have a
[1:52:26] desire to be in the house of God I know
[1:52:28] what a prophet of God said he said we'd
[1:52:30] be there when the doors are open there's
[1:52:32] some there's a desire in a Believer to
[1:52:33] come to church and worship God Amen and
[1:52:36] I know sometimes things gets in the way
[1:52:38] and jobs and life and all that but uh
[1:52:40] we'll just pray that the Lord will just
[1:52:41] move every every block out of our way
[1:52:44] and I I pray he'd do it for all of us if
[1:52:46] there's something that that blocks us
[1:52:48] from being able to be all that God wants
[1:52:50] us to be I pray God would take it out of
[1:52:51] my life amen
[1:52:53] just to free us up to be able to come
[1:52:55] and worship the Lord amen you love the
[1:52:57] Lord tonight amen just remember brother
[1:53:00] Timothy he's still coming had um he'll

[1:53:05] part of the the funeral services there
