[39:21] Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. When everyone that's on the other
[39:23] side, they're just rooting us on this

[39:42] you this morning. If you got your
[39:43] Bibles, we invite you to 2 Corinthians
[39:46] chapter 3
[40:02] says, "Now the Lord is that spirit,
[40:06] and where the spirit of the Lord is,
[40:08] there's liberty.
[40:10] But we all with open face beholding as a
[40:13] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[40:15] into the same image from glory unto
[40:19] glory even by the spirit of the Lord.
[40:23] Well, God bless you this morning. It's
[40:26] always good to read his word. You can
[40:28] have your seats this morning.
[40:32] Now, I'd like to take for a few moments
[40:35] today and minister on in his presence,
[40:40] bread on his table.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; As we was looking at this scripture this
[40:44] morning
[40:46] that the Lord is that spirit. Can you
[40:48] say
[40:48] &gt;&gt; amen?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Brother, give me some more monitor and
[40:53] my ear monitors for me so I don't have
[40:54] to power it all the way up.
[40:58] It says, "Now the Lord is that spirit,
[41:01] and where the spirit of the Lord is,
[41:04] &gt;&gt; there's liberty."
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no restraints.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; It's a where the atmosphere or the
[41:11] presence of the Lord is, there's
[41:14] liberty.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; It's got the power to bring forth there.
[41:17] There's no restraints.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; There's freedom.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From glory unto glory, he's
[41:25] changing
[41:26] &gt;&gt; this bride. Amen. Do you believe it?
[41:28] &gt;&gt; He changing. He said from Luther unto
[41:31] Wesley unto the glory unto glory. I'm
[41:35] still the same God that lived in the day
[41:37] of Wesley and Luther. And going back to
[41:40] the original glory. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; It's the same bride with the same
[41:44] liberty to be changed.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; He said in the evening time, brother
[41:49] David, there shall be light. That's
[41:51] right.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said the same s o n that uh
[41:55] poured out kinosis out that day of
[41:58] Pentecost. Amen. He promised the same
[42:01] thing today. What happened in the upper
[42:04] room? They got in the one mind and one
[42:06] accord and and the presence of Jehovah
[42:09] God came down and filled that room and
[42:12] the environment got right and the
[42:15] atmosphere got just right. Amen. And
[42:18] there there was such a liberty. There
[42:21] wasn't no restraint. There wasn't no
[42:23] more uh uh uh kindness or backward back
[42:26] backwards or funny feelings or emotions.
[42:30] Actually, brother Brian, they dismissed
[42:32] those things. Amen. They created an
[42:35] atmosphere to bring things to pass and
[42:38] it it brought a liberty. No doubt.
[42:40] That's the reason why he says here where
[42:42] the spirit of the Lord is,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; there's liberty.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; There's liberty to worship and to praise
[42:49] him.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. for deliverance.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Who was this? Who's with
[42:55] us?"
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Who's this mighty God that's bailed
[42:58] before us? It's the glory of the
[43:00] presence of Almighty God.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; So the presence, there is a freedom.
[43:06] There is a liberty. There's a peace.
[43:09] There is a victory.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, we are commissioned, Brother
[43:13] Joe, to operate in his name.

[43:22] &gt;&gt; Operating under and in his name. Demons
[43:27] have to tremble.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; We're in the presence operating in his
[43:32] name. Hallelujah.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Oh church, the demons this morning
[43:35] doesn't have a choice or a chance.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; He said the rod in Moses hand, Amen.
[43:42] They couldn't stop Moses
[43:44] &gt;&gt; with a rod in his hands. Neither can
[43:47] they stop this church with Jesus name.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're operate. We're commissioned
[43:53] this morning
[43:54] &gt;&gt; to operate under and in his name.

[44:02] has to give away.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Demons have to give away. There's power
[44:06] in just the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[44:10] And the bride of Jesus Christ is under
[44:12] the liberty of worshiping in his name.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; It's not a building.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; We love Grace Tabernacle this morning.
[44:22] We got a beautiful sanctuary, but this
[44:24] is not the tabernacle that I'm talking
[44:26] about this morning where the spirit of
[44:29] the Lord is. In this tabernacle, there's
[44:32] liberty. Amen. Liberty, there's no
[44:34] restraints. In other words, this bride
[44:36] is going to bring forth every promise.
[44:39] Amen. That that has ever spoken of her
[44:42] in this last day, it might not look like
[44:44] it's possible. Amen. But once the spirit
[44:47] of the Lord, amen, comes upon this
[44:50] tabernacle, there's a liberty that
[44:52] brings forth freedom. Amen. There's no
[44:55] restraints.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; We're worshiping this morning because
[44:58] there's no restraints.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There's freedom this
[45:04] morning. And his presence is what
[45:07] changes things.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:10] It has transforming power.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 12:2 said, "Be not
[45:17] conformed to this world, but be you
[45:19] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[45:22] that you prove what is good and
[45:24] acceptable, perfect will of God."
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; God sent his transforming power to
[45:29] fulfill his word
[45:30] &gt;&gt; and change this whole body. Yes, sir.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Just like he said Sarah and Abraham.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Science said it was impossible.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. And there was no doubt telling
[45:39] them it's over. You can never this. You
[45:42] can never bring forth a child. There's
[45:44] no way that you could overcome this.
[45:46] You're well stricken in age. Your body's
[45:48] already filling you. There's no chance
[45:50] of it. You'll never get over it. You'll
[45:52] never get over this.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, if we have breath in our body
[45:57] this morning,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; it ain't over.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God can still defeat the
[46:03] odds that are stacked against us, it
[46:05] ain't over till he says it's over.
[46:08] Oh, in the presence there's no retreat.
[46:11] In his presence there's no defeat. In
[46:14] his presence there's joy unspeakable and
[46:17] full of glory.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; David would make a statement in Psalms
[46:21] and say it like this. In his presence is
[46:24] the fullness of joy.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Can we say that this morning?
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. In his presence there's fullness
[46:32] of joy.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Fullness of happiness.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Fullness of joy. Amen. We don't have to
[46:38] pump you up this morning.

[46:41] to be up here to get you going. No.
[46:43] Where the spirit of the Lord is. There's
[46:45] liberty.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brian, we we was visit the
[46:49] other day. It it ain't that at all.
[46:51] Amen. Where the spirit of the Lord is,
[46:54] there's liberty.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be in an attic. Your mama
[46:57] or your sister or your daughter can put
[46:59] you in an attic with a geography book.
[47:02] Amen. But you don't have to be pumped
[47:04] up. Amen. You don't have to be primed up
[47:06] this morning. Amen. Where the spirit of
[47:08] the Lord is, there's liberty and freedom
[47:11] to worship. We don't have to wait for
[47:13] church camp, youth camp, special
[47:15] meetings. Amen. No. No. We don't have to
[47:17] wait on the pastor. We don't have to
[47:19] wait on your favorite evangelist. Amen.
[47:21] All you got to do is let go and let God
[47:24] have his way. He's more than able. Amen.
[47:26] To let if he can allow rocks to cry out
[47:29] this morning, somebody's going to
[47:31] worship him.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to praise him.
[47:34] Somebody's going to have liberty.
[47:36] Somebody's going to dance. Somebody's
[47:38] going to scream cuz there's no
[47:40] restraints on the body of believers.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe it?
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; I say he's full of joy.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; It's full of joy, full of healing, full
[47:52] of deliverance.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere is what brings results.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere is what brings things to
[48:02] life. That's right.

[49:32] to dismiss funny feelings and and and
[49:35] differences and amen. What we talking
[49:37] about? It's not a tabernacle this
[49:39] morning. As brother Window said Friday
[49:40] night, amen, it ain't the biggest
[49:42] preacher. It ain't so and so. It's all
[49:44] just coming together in one mind and one
[49:47] accord. And let the liberty of Jesus
[49:50] Christ have preeminence in our service.
[49:52] And the dead will raise, the deaf will
[49:55] hear, the blinded eyes will see.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; There will be deliverances in your home.
[50:00] Your children will come back home.

[50:13] up. It just sits there.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Just sits there in that dirt till it
[50:18] gets in the right environment.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother R would say it like this.
[50:22] You can't hide life.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You can't hide life from the sun.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; The sun goes to shining and them little
[50:34] roots wind their way out of a 100 yards
[50:37] if necessary. He's talking about a grass
[50:39] that was under the concrete.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; He said himself a 100 yards if necessary
[50:45] and then will come up.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the way I was. and you was we
[50:51] wasn't 100 yards in the wrong direction.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[50:55] &gt;&gt; but the atmosphere of light dawned in
[50:58] the dark place of our lives. Amen. The
[51:01] church. Oh, I I went my way around. I'm
[51:04] telling you this morning, I'm a living
[51:06] testimony. That the transforming power
[51:09] of almighty God is real.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I was a 100 yard, brother David, in a
[51:15] wrong direction,
[51:17] &gt;&gt; but it got that seed.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. But Sister Martha, that
[51:20] seed got in the right environment.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; I didn't had to work it up.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't had to go to pump it up. The
[51:28] seed got in the right atmosphere.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And it got in the spirit of the Lord
[51:35] &gt;&gt; and there was liberty.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Something happened.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Life sprung forth.

[51:47] then and I can scream out as Job. I know
[51:52] my redeemer living.

[51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I might have felt like
[51:57] brother Matt, Pastor Matt said last
[51:58] Sunday, Job was in a bad situation.

[52:03] &gt;&gt; But one day,
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. that that seed got in the right
[52:07] environment.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:11] He said that grass that was under that
[52:13] sidewalk that was was under there, the
[52:17] lights are shining. He said when that
[52:19] light shine, life comes into existence.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, church can't it can't help itself
[52:26] this morning. Nothing in hell can stop
[52:29] it.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Life comes into existence.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came in the presence of a
[52:40] woman at the well, she was five times
[52:42] the wrong husband and she was living
[52:45] with one that wasn't hers.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; But she got in the presence. And listen,
[52:50] friend, that was so there was a seed
[52:53] down inside of her. She had an eternal
[52:56] representation down inside of that soul.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; And she went to churches and churches
[53:03] and she went to husband to husband. But
[53:06] all that seed was needing was getting
[53:08] into the presence of the one and the
[53:12] only Christ, her redeemer.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And when that seed got in the right
[53:19] atmosphere,
[53:20] something changed.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. She said, you know, it's not
[53:24] customary. I came to this well and
[53:26] certain hour. There shouldn't be no
[53:28] other man here.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; But something changed.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Now, there was liberty,
[53:38] &gt;&gt; come on,
[53:39] &gt;&gt; within this woman.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; That came to a well a harlot.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; But made a man and got in the atmosphere
[53:47] and the environment begin to change that
[53:50] what was in her from the beginning.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That light and she
[53:57] couldn't hide from it.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; You can't hide light from the sun.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He bypassed the the church
[54:05] down the road and and the priest down
[54:08] the road to come to a little woman at
[54:11] the well that nobody else wanted nothing
[54:12] to do with. Amen. But Jesus Christ said,
[54:15] "I have must need to go down to
[54:18] Samaria."
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine
[54:25] the Liberty the Liberty bell was
[54:28] ringing?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; And something changed down inside of her
[54:32] heart. Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; And she ran to the town said, "I met a
[54:37] man.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; I met a man, Sister Sandy. I met a man.
[54:41] I met a man." And no doubt the critics
[54:43] said, "You met a lot of men." Oh, no.
[54:46] But I met a man that could turn on the
[54:48] light. I met a man, amen, that told me
[54:52] my past. Amen. Encourage me in my
[54:55] future.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:59] You drink of this water, I tell you,
[55:02] you'll never thirst again.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Life come into existence.
[55:09] That wasn't just for yesterday.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that happened to me.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; I was lost and undone.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on,
[55:17] &gt;&gt; brothers. And I I mentioned this a lot,
[55:20] but that little woman that that she her
[55:22] life was all marred up.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; She was on drugs. She was an alcoholic.
[55:28] She was a prostitute. Amen. Nobody
[55:30] thought there was no use for her. There
[55:32] was no help for her. There was no
[55:34] redemption for her.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Brandham passed her
[55:38] way one day and she be to pray. And he
[55:41] she told Brother, "What could the Lord
[55:42] do with me?"
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad you asked, sister. I'm
[55:46] telling you exactly what the Lord can do
[55:48] for you. You keep getting all you got to
[55:51] do, little sister, is get into his
[55:53] presence. Hallelujah. When you get into
[55:55] his presence and that environment gets
[55:58] right, there's not nothing going to hold
[56:00] that seat down.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And that woman be to
[56:05] pray. She begin to pray and all of a
[56:08] sudden, church, something be to happen
[56:11] there in Flint, Michigan. Amen. Brother
[56:13] Brand came back by and said, "Amen." And
[56:16] she begin to pray and and something
[56:18] begin to happen. And Brother Brand said,
[56:20] "You know, the blood is so powerful. The
[56:23] blood is so real. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. She got in the presence of the man
[56:27] that can change her life.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And it took her back.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; It changed her.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; There's liberty now.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said took her back to the
[56:40] time that she never done it in the first
[56:42] place.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Brother would say it like this. Took her
[56:45] back to the time she was a virgin.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; What can wash away my sins? Nothing but
[56:51] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. What can make us whole again this
[56:57] morning? Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[57:00] Christ.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; This tabernacle
[57:10] was designed to habitate the atmosphere
[57:13] for change.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] In the Old Testament, there was an outer
[57:17] court,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; inner court, and the holies of holies.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; On the outer court, Sister Joyce, the
[57:28] mana that would drop.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; It would begin to spoil.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It would begin to rot.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; It would begin to decay. But that same
[57:36] mana in the Holies of Holies, Amen. It
[57:40] was good today. It was good tomorrow. It
[57:42] was good next week. It was good next
[57:45] year.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; The difference was it was in the
[57:49] presence
[57:50] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Brother R would say this about Aaron's
[57:55] rod. He said, "But when a man was on the
[57:58] outside, it was just an old rod."
[58:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; It was just an ordinary stick. He would
[58:04] be carried along in Aaron's hand till it
[58:06] was dried up. There was no life in it.
[58:10] He said, "That's the man that's cut off
[58:12] from God." that the man that's without
[58:14] Christ, that's the man may be a member
[58:16] of a church but knows no more about God
[58:19] than a hot and hot would know about an
[58:21] Egyptian knight walking on. He said,
[58:24] "Oh, I belong to a church." It was it
[58:26] was in Aaron's hand. He was used he he
[58:29] was used but dead. But when the robe was
[58:32] put into the holies of holies into a
[58:35] consecrated place of God and God
[58:38] provided place the presence of the Holy
[58:41] Spirit, he says, "You know what
[58:43] happened?"
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; It began to bind.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And blossom
[58:49] &gt;&gt; and yield almonds.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Outside there was no liberty.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; He was just a dried up stick. Came to
[58:57] this world speaking lies and shaped in
[58:59] iniquity.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. didn't have no plague,
[59:02] no way of redemption. Amen. But there
[59:04] came a kinsman redeemer.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And gave his life and gave his
[59:08] blood.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And all we got to do is get
[59:13] into his presence.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He says, he said blossom and yielded
[59:19] almonds in one night.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says that's what we need
[59:24] today is picking up and taking beyond
[59:27] church membership.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. into the holiest and the
[59:31] presence of the consecration of the Lord
[59:33] Jesus Christ.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; What was it? The life that it ought to
[59:37] have been. It was dead and just like a
[59:40] tentpole there.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; But it was a tree.
[59:45] It was an almond tree. All right.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; But it was dead.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; There's many people tonight professing
[59:51] Christianity, but it's dead.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Hopeless.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; They wander along just knowing they
[59:56] belong to a church. And that's not only
[59:58] Presbyterian, Lutheran, so forth. That
[1:00:00] is in Pentecost.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's true." He said, "What
[1:00:03] you need today is come before Christ."
[1:00:06] And look what happened. Now, the first
[1:00:08] thing it had to be refreshed to bring
[1:00:09] forth buds. It budded out. Not only did
[1:00:12] it bug, it brought forth blossoms. No
[1:00:15] one. Catch these things, church. We're
[1:00:16] going somewhere this morning. Not only
[1:00:18] did it blossom, but it it brought forth
[1:00:21] fruit.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it'll be. That's the
[1:00:25] way it'll be. Are you hearing me,
[1:00:26] church? It didn't just come in there and
[1:00:28] sit there and and and had to be begged
[1:00:31] into it or No, no, no. It was a dry rod.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; It was just a dry dead
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; no life. The Reb said out there. But
[1:00:44] that brother David Paul when it came
[1:00:46] into the holies of holies there was a
[1:00:49] presence or an atmosphere or an
[1:00:52] environment amen to bring forth what it
[1:00:56] was in the first place. It didn't bring
[1:00:58] apples, it didn't bring oranges, it
[1:01:00] brought what it was in the first place.
[1:01:03] He said not only did it bl uh begin to
[1:01:06] bring forth, but it brought fruit. It
[1:01:08] blossom. It It was beginning to change
[1:01:11] in what it was intended in the first
[1:01:14] place.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Outside it was dead. I say church this
[1:01:20] morning outside we was dead. There was
[1:01:23] no hope. There was no way of escape.
[1:01:26] Amen. But one day this body got in the
[1:01:30] presence of the som and it brought life
[1:01:34] into existence.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; As brother Matt said, I'm trying to
[1:01:42] behave myself.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; He said it blossom, bear fruits. You'll
[1:01:52] be a worker in your community.
[1:01:55] You'll be a show winner for Jesus.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; You'll be a new person.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] Old things will pass away. Traditions of
[1:02:08] men will fail. But your heart will be
[1:02:11] burning. Oh, I like this. Your heart
[1:02:14] will be burning with the love of God.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Inside this place where they took these
[1:02:19] old rod, laid it in the presence of God.
[1:02:22] God living in the glory of the
[1:02:24] cherubams. The rod all happened at once.
[1:02:29] Oh, he says, "Oh, brother and sister, to
[1:02:32] the light that's concentrated, lays
[1:02:34] before God. It'll change them and
[1:02:36] certain amount standing at this
[1:02:37] platform."
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; It'll take all the fight out of you.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Charles, it'll take all the fight the
[1:02:49] fighting out of you. It'll take all the
[1:02:51] differences out of me.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It'll take all the isms out of you.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; In his presence,
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; he don't just sweep it and all.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; No, he just don't cover it and all.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; He begins to dismiss.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Islams don't belong here no more.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to work it up.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; It's something that's doing it within
[1:03:15] you.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The dead rod didn't do
[1:03:18] nothing but come in the presence of God.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it lays her before God. It
[1:03:27] changes them.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; It takes all the isms out of them.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Like this. It'll make you a real
[1:03:32] Christian
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; if you'll just
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; get into his presence.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Oh church, we take this world and place
[1:03:41] it in the dirt and get into his presence
[1:03:44] and the atmosphere, it just happens.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; It brings forth or manifest.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; What it was from the first place.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. church. We always was.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; We came from God.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And we're going back to God.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're trapped in this world as a
[1:04:04] dried up stick.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; But God who's rich in mercy.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Aaron carried that rod all day long
[1:04:12] outside of the tabernacle.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; It benefited in working. It benefited in
[1:04:19] different ways, but it was just a dead
[1:04:22] stick.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:04:24] But the atmosphere
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; in the presence
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; into the holies of holies.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; It brought to life what it was in the
[1:04:42] first place.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Oh church, these dried up sticks of clay
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; born in sin, shaped in iniquity. But
[1:04:49] when we get into his presence,
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John, he said, "And no man
[1:04:55] can come to me,
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; the father with father which has sent me
[1:05:00] has draw them."
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That there's drawing power.
[1:05:04] Brother said it, brother Brian, it's not
[1:05:06] from a church. It's not from a man.
[1:05:08] Amen. It's from It's not from your
[1:05:10] pastor, he says, but from glory. The
[1:05:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost moving down in
[1:05:18] the right channel and the environment is
[1:05:20] right and it draws you up.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; It's the power of God to access to his
[1:05:29] life. Zoe's life.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; God's own life. Aonio's life never had a
[1:05:36] beginning, never have an end. whole
[1:05:38] church. Amen. When that seed gets in the
[1:05:41] presence of that that kind of
[1:05:43] environment,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; It makes preachers out of them.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; It makes deacons.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; This makes trustees.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; It makes song leaders.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It makes ministers.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; It makes drummers.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; It makes organ players. Not for a
[1:06:00] church, but for the kingdom of almighty
[1:06:02] God.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; It makes worippers. It makes praisers.
[1:06:07] It makes sores. It makes deliverers.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; My
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not you any longer.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; You're just a dried up stick.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Travis. But when this old dried stick,
[1:06:25] could you imagine? Can you visualize it
[1:06:27] just for a moment? It's time. No, time's
[1:06:30] good.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Time's good,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Sister Destiny. Then we just look at it
[1:06:33] for a moment and visualize that rod that
[1:06:38] was dried up. The color was a all pale
[1:06:42] color like a driftwood maybe
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; brother and it didn't look much to look
[1:06:47] like and to look upon rather brother Joe
[1:06:51] they might not think you're much but
[1:06:53] listen when they got that raw and Aaron
[1:06:55] laid it into the presence of the holies
[1:06:58] of holies
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; could you imagine if you were standing
[1:07:01] in that room and all of a sudden that
[1:07:04] old stick that was dry with no life I
[1:07:08] could imagine I'm just dramatizing.
[1:07:11] Amen. But listen, brother David Paul, I
[1:07:13] just imagine that old rod begin to
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; It begin to shake just a little bit.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Like brother said, those bones down
[1:07:22] there was in the valley. Amen. With no
[1:07:24] hope, scattered abroad. Amen. But all of
[1:07:27] a sudden, the word of the Lord came and
[1:07:30] the wind of Yahweh came sweeping down
[1:07:32] and light came into those dry bones and
[1:07:35] it was shaking and a lot of noise going
[1:07:37] on. I can imagine, amen, that roy was
[1:07:40] screaming out in the holies of holies.
[1:07:42] I've got to praise him. I got to worship
[1:07:44] him. I've been dead too long. Amen. That
[1:07:47] begin to shake in the presence of the
[1:07:50] holies of holies. You didn't have to beg
[1:07:52] him. It just happened.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; We don't have to beg you to come to
[1:07:58] church. Once you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:00] you can't wait for the doors to be open.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; That's word.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope you're having fun as I am.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; He says, moving right now into the
[1:08:17] church. He says, "The evening lights are
[1:08:21] shining." How many can say amen to that?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Said the evening light is a shining
[1:08:27] and the bright tree,
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; come on,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; is not dead.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; The bride tree is blooming.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] Maybe they was dried up stick on the
[1:08:39] outside.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; But Aaron's rod came in the Holies of
[1:08:43] Holies and that old stick began to shake
[1:08:45] a little bit.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And all those sat out maybe out of one
[1:08:49] of the knots on the side of that that
[1:08:51] almond branch. There was a little green
[1:08:55] stem begin to come out.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. They said, "Brother,
[1:09:00] the scripture says, Amen. that our
[1:09:02] leaves shall be green."
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're Amen. When the world is in a
[1:09:07] famine, when this world's in a great
[1:09:09] drought, oh, he said, "But you, Amen, my
[1:09:12] people, I'm going to be your God and
[1:09:15] you're going to be my people." Amen.
[1:09:17] There's your leaves. It's going to be
[1:09:19] green. There's going to be life in you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; The bride tree is blooming.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Why? She is in the presence of the king.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] Brother man would say it like this. How
[1:09:37] that thing refreshed in his presence.
[1:09:41] Notice another thing. Once in the
[1:09:44] presence of God, you're not tossed about
[1:09:48] by every wind of doctrine.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not tossed about by
[1:09:53] everything. You're not moved by
[1:09:55] feelings.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; You're not moved by emotions. You're not
[1:09:58] moved by somebody hurting your feelings.
[1:10:00] You're not moved by your Hey, church. We
[1:10:01] all get that way.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:05] be like brother Wind.

[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Goliath. Come on up here. I'll pray for
[1:10:15] you.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; We are human beings.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; We all fight battles. Brother Tom, we
[1:10:21] all get our little isms and we all get
[1:10:23] our little We This old boy right here is
[1:10:26] still badger skin.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're tagging along. Like brother
[1:10:29] Donnie said, we're pulling that guy
[1:10:31] everywhere we go. We're pulling him
[1:10:33] wherever we go. Amen. It's there. No
[1:10:35] matter when I would do good, the
[1:10:37] scripture said, "Evil is present with
[1:10:39] me."
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Well, he says, "But when you're
[1:10:46] standing, there's something happens. You
[1:10:50] know that you're a real Christian. You
[1:10:52] know that you've been in contact with
[1:10:55] somebody that loves you."
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that something happened
[1:11:00] down here and it's refreshing.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And not only that, I like this, brother.
[1:11:07] I thought of you when I read this. He
[1:11:09] said, "Not only that, but you will
[1:11:10] refresh others."
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me you get in the
[1:11:17] presence of the Holies of Holies, you're
[1:11:19] not just going to refresh yourself?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Come on.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; No. Eternal life is living for others.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get in the presence
[1:11:28] of him, you can't help yourself.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You can't help yourself. Somebody can do
[1:11:33] you wrong and you want to turn the other
[1:11:35] cheek. Amen. Why? Because your nature's
[1:11:38] been changed.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But something's happened out here. It's
[1:11:43] refreshing to you and you want to lift
[1:11:46] somebody else up. Oh, come on, brother.
[1:11:48] Rejoice with me. Rejoice with me. Come
[1:11:51] on, brother. Rejoice. God's good. His
[1:11:54] blessings, his mercy's new every
[1:11:56] morning. Come and go with me. Don't be
[1:11:59] down in the m grubs. Hey, I tell you
[1:12:01] church, I need that sometimes, too. We
[1:12:03] all need a encouragement. We all need a
[1:12:06] refresher. Come on, brother. Amen. Let's
[1:12:09] rejoice together. God's good, not just
[1:12:12] some of the time. God's good all the
[1:12:14] time.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, you talking about a church on
[1:12:20] fire. Amen. If we'd all get in that
[1:12:22] environment. Come on now.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Where we're not just woring about our
[1:12:28] for no more.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; We're woring about everybody in the
[1:12:31] church. Like brother W man, he preached
[1:12:32] an amazing service Friday night. He
[1:12:35] said, "Oh, a but we're trying to lift
[1:12:37] each other up. We're trying to help one
[1:12:39] another out." Amen. We might have
[1:12:40] indifference, but we're still brothers
[1:12:42] and we're still sisters and we're trying
[1:12:44] to get to the same place. Let's refresh
[1:12:46] somebody.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; I say this a lot to my family. I said,
[1:12:51] "We don't know what that individual's
[1:12:54] going through."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I know my kids probably get upset at me
[1:12:58] sometime because they want me to take
[1:13:01] their their place. They're shaking their
[1:13:03] heads,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; take their sides, rather.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; But but as a as a minister of the
[1:13:09] gospel, and at church, I I have these
[1:13:12] issues, too. But we got to stop for a
[1:13:14] minute. We don't know what that person's
[1:13:16] been through when they said certain
[1:13:18] certain things.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know what kind of
[1:13:20] situations they was in, the pressures of
[1:13:22] life that caused them to say that. Oh,
[1:13:25] but church. Amen. If we could just begin
[1:13:27] to shake in the presence of the Holies
[1:13:29] of Holies and begin to realize that's my
[1:13:32] brother, that's my sister. I'm going to
[1:13:34] refresh them. I'm going to give them
[1:13:37] something to rejoice about.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Don't wonder, brother. Never let your
[1:13:42] testimony be negative, but let it be
[1:13:45] positive all the time.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't testify nothing for
[1:13:51] the devil.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Brother, they asked him a question. This
[1:13:55] is all free this morning.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; They asked brother a question. He said,
[1:13:59] he said, "Should I should I still got
[1:14:01] this? Should I tell?" No.
[1:14:04] No. You look by faith.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; We don't look by what we can see.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Extra, extra. Read all about
[1:14:11] it. Praise God. I'm healed."
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] Oh, there was ones out there said, "Oh,
[1:14:17] John, you'll never receive it. You
[1:14:19] You'll never get over this. John, you're
[1:14:21] bringing approach on him." But when John
[1:14:23] came back in the prayer line, there was
[1:14:25] a man that's been in the Holies of
[1:14:26] Holies. Amen. He didn't want to just
[1:14:28] refresh himself. He said, "John, just
[1:14:31] keep confessing it." Amen. It's yours
[1:14:33] already. He be refreshing. Oh, church.
[1:14:37] That's what we need this morning. If the
[1:14:39] doctor said you can never have this, the
[1:14:41] doctor said you'll never get over this.
[1:14:43] You'll never be able to have
[1:14:44] deliverance. You'll never be able to
[1:14:46] have child. You'll never have this. I'm
[1:14:48] encouraging you this morning. I'm
[1:14:50] refreshing. It's not over till God says
[1:14:54] it's over.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's all free this morning. No extra
[1:15:06] charge.
[1:15:07] Brian's paying this morning.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:16] evidence you've been in the presence.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; The evidence, brother Joe, that you've
[1:15:21] been in the presence of him.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; You've been refreshed
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; and you're refreshing others.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Brother wheat, I like this. The wheat
[1:15:33] has you going have time, you go back and
[1:15:35] read this whole quote. It's powerful.
[1:15:37] He's talking about the seed, the shuck
[1:15:39] of the wheat separating from the shuck.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He said then when the separation comes,
[1:15:44] the wheat has to lay in the presence
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; of the sun
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; to ripen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; He says that what we're here for,
[1:15:53] friend, to stay in the presence of the
[1:15:57] sen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Till our little group, Can I say that
[1:16:01] this morning? till the grace tabernacle
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; till it becomes so wrapped in Christ.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; It becomes bread on his table.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; That he said brother said that's what I
[1:16:16] want to do is not just be wheat. Amen.
[1:16:20] But become bread on the master's table.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say we will stay in
[1:16:28] the presence of the son. Amen. That
[1:16:30] environment. Amen. You don't have to
[1:16:32] work a rapture up. You just get in the
[1:16:35] right environment.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You get an atmosphere for change.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; I say this outer court is not going to
[1:16:44] produce it.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; The spirit realm is not going to produce
[1:16:48] it.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have good spirit time services.
[1:16:51] We get in the spirit and we have all we
[1:16:53] shout, scream, run, and man, it's all
[1:16:55] good. Boy, but it goes a little deeper
[1:16:57] than that. Amen. Down inside of a
[1:17:00] believer, amen, is called a soul. And
[1:17:04] that soul has a germ seed of life in it.
[1:17:07] Amen. That you didn't receive at an
[1:17:09] altar. Amen. It was you was always an
[1:17:13] eagle. Listen, church, you didn't become
[1:17:16] a son. You always was a son. Amen. No
[1:17:21] way, brother David. Amen. There's no
[1:17:23] way, nothing in time could ever take
[1:17:27] your sunship away.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; God's good to us.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; But I want to become bread on his table.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; From wheat
[1:17:46] to what it was supposed to be at the

[1:18:17] open. Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And out came what went in the ground.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Seeing a seed of wheat
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; and there was wheat hanging there. Amen.
[1:18:26] But that wasn't his full purpose. His
[1:18:29] full purpose was to become bread.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; The whole purpose when that that that ro
[1:18:37] dried up rod came in the holies of
[1:18:39] holies. Amen. It wasn't just to stay
[1:18:41] there, but it was a break forth life.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] Ezekiel tell you tells us that when I
[1:18:50] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[1:18:54] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[1:18:56] and from all your idols where I cleanse
[1:18:59] you. He says I a new heart, brother Ben.
[1:19:02] Also will I give you a new spirit where
[1:19:04] I put within you and I will take away
[1:19:07] thy stony heart.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Let's preach on just for a few moments
[1:19:12] now.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's given you
[1:19:15] something, but he's taken away anything
[1:19:16] that would cause an atmosphere not to be
[1:19:18] right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Well, preacher, that's why sometimes the
[1:19:22] pastor
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the evangelist may get down
[1:19:26] some of your ropes,
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; but it's only trying to get you in a
[1:19:29] place that you can bud,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; get you in a place that you can have
[1:19:32] liberty.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And notice he said, "I'm going to
[1:19:35] not I'm going to take away that stony
[1:19:37] heart that's caused you to be bitter,
[1:19:40] that's caused you being indifferent,
[1:19:41] caused you not to shout, cause you not
[1:19:43] to sh scream, cause you not to sing in
[1:19:46] church, cause you not to preach in
[1:19:47] church, cause you not to raise your
[1:19:49] hands, cause you not to play, push play,
[1:19:51] not to cause you not to read your Bible.
[1:19:53] It's causing you not to pray for your
[1:19:56] brother or refresh your sister."
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you this morning.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] Good.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; If you want a revival,
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; you're going to have to release and
[1:20:08] separate yourself.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; From certain things.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; If you want healing, so you got to
[1:20:14] separate from your doubt and separate
[1:20:16] from unbelief.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, I'm going to take away that
[1:20:20] stony heart.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Out of your flesh. And I'm going to give
[1:20:23] you a heart of flesh. I'll put my spirit
[1:20:26] within you and I'll cause you
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; with a dry rod. Don't have to do
[1:20:31] nothing. Brother David, it just has to
[1:20:33] lay in the presence. I'm going to give
[1:20:35] you exactly what you have need of, and
[1:20:37] I'm I'm going to I'm going to cause you
[1:20:40] to walk in my statutes.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And shall be kept in my judgments and do
[1:20:45] them. And you shall dwell in the land
[1:20:47] that I give you.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And you shall be my people.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be your God.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; there's liberty.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, Brad.
[1:21:02] It doesn't matter how big your
[1:21:03] circumstances is,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Benjamin, it doesn't matter how big your
[1:21:15] circumstance, how big, it doesn't
[1:21:17] matter.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; We all got circumstances.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, mine's bigger than
[1:21:21] yours.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And you're sitting out there saying,
[1:21:23] "Oh, Sister Sist
[1:21:26] my problem's bigger than yours." Why?
[1:21:28] because you're facing it.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Your individual giant's always bigger
[1:21:32] than what you think somebody else's
[1:21:34] giant is.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't matter how big the
[1:21:41] circumstance or how bad it may seem.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Remember Goliath
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; didn't come only in David's presence.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; for David would say this, "This is not
[1:21:54] my battle.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] So Goliath walked in the presence of
[1:22:01] many men.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; He walked in the presence of many men,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Benji,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; and never lost the battle.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And he would have been okay
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; if David didn't bring somebody with him.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; The rest of camp was cowards.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; But David said, "This is not my battle.
[1:22:23] I'm telling you, this is not my battle.
[1:22:25] And the Lord's on my side. I'm telling
[1:22:27] you, giant. Amen. I don't care how big
[1:22:29] you are, how big your spirit is.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; But the difference was David didn't come
[1:22:41] alone.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Goliath was there.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; The circumstances was there.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; The giant was still there. He never lost
[1:22:55] the battle.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; But good David's God was present, too.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; For God said, "I'll never leave you.
[1:23:05] I'll never forsake you.
[1:23:09] Your problems may be here. Your
[1:23:10] circumstances may be here."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; No matter where you are,
[1:23:17] the circumstances that you may be in,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Jonah was in a belly of a whale.
[1:23:25] That's right.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; In the bottom of the ocean,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; brother said, "If anybody had
[1:23:30] circumstances, he had them."
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; There was seem like there was no hope.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; But he turned himself back to the
[1:23:36] promise.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And he created his own atmosphere.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; In the belly, in the bottom of the
[1:23:42] ocean.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Your problems may be there. They may be
[1:23:53] present, but so is your God this
[1:23:55] morning.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid this morning.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You're in the presence of the king.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; You're in the pres. How many believes
[1:24:04] this morning that you're in the presence
[1:24:05] of a king?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; So circumstances don't matter.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Feelings don't matter.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid this morning. Can I just
[1:24:19] preach for one more time?
[1:24:22] Don't be afraid to ask. That's
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Do we serve a little God?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Do we serve a miniature God?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Hey, do we have to carry our God around
[1:24:36] on a stick somewhere?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Sir,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; there's a story told of a king that was
[1:24:45] coming to have an audience with his
[1:24:48] people.
[1:24:50] They was all gathering what they wanted
[1:24:52] from the king.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; This one stood to his feet says, "Oh
[1:24:56] king, give me a cow." He said,
[1:24:59] "Granted."
[1:25:01] This one said, "Oh king, get will you
[1:25:03] give us a pig?"
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was granted. And they begin to
[1:25:08] ask just like we do sometimes. They just
[1:25:11] begin to ask certain things, granted.
[1:25:13] And this one old kid, this one gentleman
[1:25:15] stood up. He said, "Oh, King, I want a
[1:25:18] mansion on a hillside.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I want a creek running through my
[1:25:22] property. I want hundreds of h head of
[1:25:25] cattle. I and and goats and sheep and
[1:25:28] and pigs. Oh, I want enough gold to last
[1:25:31] from generation unto generation." And
[1:25:34] everybody thought, "Man, this guy's lost
[1:25:36] his mind." And the king turned to him.
[1:25:39] He said, "Oh, family."
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody else something only a king
[1:25:44] could meet. Hallelujah.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; And I say this morning, don't ask some
[1:25:48] miss. Amen. Ask that your joy may be
[1:25:51] full as abundantly this morning. Ask for
[1:25:55] all angels. Papa God could meet that
[1:25:58] need this morning. Doctor says there's
[1:26:00] no way. Medicine says there's no way.
[1:26:03] Don't ask a miss. Don't ask about
[1:26:05] feelings. Ask. Get in the right
[1:26:08] environment this morning.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Finally, someone asked
[1:26:15] something only a king could give.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask something this
[1:26:19] morning.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm I'm a nobody."
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We all are no bodies.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; We're all just dried up sticks.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; We all drive different things. We live
[1:26:33] in different homes. We We have our own
[1:26:35] opinions. We have our own noses. We only
[1:26:36] have We have Some has little ears, some
[1:26:38] have big, some are skinny, some are big.
[1:26:41] Hey, but some have got gray hair, some
[1:26:42] don't. Some are bald and some don't.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; They don't change anything this morning.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; God cares this morning.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; God who's rich in mercy, he said, "I
[1:26:56] can't lose a one of you."
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; You can't run fast enough, I'm going to
[1:27:00] catch you. You can't hide good enough,
[1:27:02] I'm going to find you.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, say, "I'm a nobody." Peter probably
[1:27:10] felt that way, too.
[1:27:12] Come on, somebody.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he began to deny Christ three
[1:27:16] times,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And by the law, he lost his disciplehip.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Looked like there was no hope for Peter.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus rose from the dead, he
[1:27:26] told that woman, he said, "Go tell my
[1:27:28] disciples and Peter."
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't leave Peter out.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz he had already Peter had a work.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Peter was going to be refreshing others.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Peter is going to be
[1:27:39] standing on a soap box preaching the
[1:27:42] gospel.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Go tell my disciples and Peter.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Psalms 91. I'm I'm going to I got so
[1:27:53] much God's goodness today.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; We don't have to finish this. Thanks.
[1:27:56] Brother M come back and finish it.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:28:00] the most high
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Shall abide under the shadow
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; of the almighty.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shadow here means it's a
[1:28:08] conjunction. It runs parallel with
[1:28:11] shelter.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It portrays God's protective presence as
[1:28:15] a constant enveloping surrounded
[1:28:18] completely shake.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Break it down, brother.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; I would say the Lord, he's my refuge and
[1:28:26] my fortress. He's my God. Can you say
[1:28:29] that with me? He's my God. Goliath may
[1:28:31] be here, but my God is present.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] He surrounds me.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "Surely he shall deliver thee
[1:28:39] from the snare of the fowler, from the
[1:28:41] non-sung pestilence. He shall cover thee
[1:28:44] with his feathers protected presence.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Under his wings shalt thou trust. His
[1:28:50] truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
[1:28:52] Thou shalt not be afraid by the terror
[1:28:54] by night, or the error that flyth by
[1:28:56] day, the passing that walketh in
[1:28:58] darkness, nor for the destruction wasted
[1:29:01] at noon day. A thousand shall fall at
[1:29:03] thy side, 10,000 at thy right hand, but
[1:29:07] it shall not come nigh unto thee because
[1:29:10] you're wrapped in the secret place of
[1:29:13] the most high God under the shadow of
[1:29:16] his protective presence.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And there's liberty when the enemy comes
[1:29:21] in like a flood. I'm surrounded
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; when the glide in my life is coming my
[1:29:27] way. I'm surrounded. Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; When 600 Philistines was coming against
[1:29:31] Shamgar, Shamgar was surrounded,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, the enemy's coming in like a flood,
[1:29:37] but I'm surrounded by him.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Raging lions was coming after Daniel,
[1:29:42] but Daniel was surrounded by him.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; It was his divine
[1:29:48] protected presence.
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Nothing happens to you this morning
[1:29:54] without Papa God knowing about it.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Can we step into his presence for a
[1:30:01] moment?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; In closing here, he speaks about Gerus's
[1:30:05] daughter
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; and listen what brother Brown says. When
[1:30:08] he walked into the home where they was
[1:30:12] at,
[1:30:13] how could he do anything
[1:30:16] with this kind of unbelief?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:22] Jesus himself walked into the house and
[1:30:25] brother said, "What could he do with
[1:30:28] this such unbelief?" Watch what he does.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; He said, Brother R said, he said, "Every
[1:30:33] one of you
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Doubt, get out."
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Unbelief, you're dismissed.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Fear, you got to go.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said he every one of
[1:30:50] you get out. And they put them out of
[1:30:52] the house.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was getting the
[1:30:57] environment right.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Joe.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it takes a little house
[1:31:05] cleaning.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; It takes a little feeling cleaning. It
[1:31:08] takes a little uh draano in our lives to
[1:31:11] clean out anything that's not and like
[1:31:14] him. Oh, we want to we want to become
[1:31:16] bread on his table. Amen. But sometimes
[1:31:19] we want to hold on to the garments of
[1:31:20] the world. Amen. We want to keep this
[1:31:22] little hidden places in our heart. And
[1:31:25] we play the part. We come to church and
[1:31:26] we sing, we shout, and we go home. We're
[1:31:29] still carrying the little luggage of
[1:31:31] unbelief.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And we wonder why we can't ever
[1:31:34] overcome. We wonder why we can't be
[1:31:36] victorious. We wonder why we can only
[1:31:39] shout on certain days and not on others.
[1:31:41] Why? We can worship on some services and
[1:31:43] some we can't. So, we're carrying some
[1:31:45] baggage.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And we don't want nobody to know about
[1:31:51] our luggage.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; So, we kind of hide it.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; But there was no hiding when Jesus came
[1:31:58] around.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, he said, "Oh, no. This
[1:32:03] ain't going to happen." Reason why she's
[1:32:04] in this condition because unbelief is
[1:32:06] here. Doubt is present. Fear is present.
[1:32:09] He said, "I put them all out of the
[1:32:11] house. Get the get every one of them
[1:32:13] out."
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Bring Peter, James, and
[1:32:19] John."
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Bring faith, hope, and charity.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Just like he said in
[1:32:26] the scripture, he replaced a stony
[1:32:28] heart.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; What was that, brother Rab was saying?
[1:32:32] He would dismiss fa doubt and unbelief
[1:32:35] and and fear and it began to create an
[1:32:38] atmosphere.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Let's bring in some hope.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Let's bring in some faith. Let's bring
[1:32:44] in some love. Let's bring in some
[1:32:46] charity. Let's bring in some meekness.
[1:32:48] Let's bring in some peace. Let's begin.
[1:32:50] What is he doing?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; There was a damsel that that the world
[1:32:54] thought was dead.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "No,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; we just got to get the environment
[1:33:00] right.
[1:33:03] all hope, faith, and charity, come here.
[1:33:05] He says,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; "That's what he had. Bring them in." He
[1:33:09] walked over there and all on the outside
[1:33:11] of the wall was unbelief.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Everything on the outside was unbelief.
[1:33:16] Everything on the inside was conditions
[1:33:18] for change.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Condition for healing. Can Can we do
[1:33:22] that this morning? Amen. Amen. Outside
[1:33:25] these walls, let's begin to dismiss. Oh,
[1:33:27] if we want to just have a ritual.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:30] Come on.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to uh have you to
[1:33:33] miss your potluck today. Amen. Let's not
[1:33:35] just have a ritual.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Just a few songs and a few words and and
[1:33:40] a few songs and go home.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Well, he walked over there. He put on
[1:33:47] the outside was all the wall of unbelief
[1:33:50] was outside the walls. On the inside was
[1:33:52] all the environment. And so listen to
[1:33:55] what I said. All on the outside of that
[1:33:58] wall was unbelief.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; So he was empowered with spirit.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; He was empowered with the spirit.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And where the spirit of the Lord is,
[1:34:10] there's liberty.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; That dry rod that dancel's daughter was
[1:34:15] laying there as a dry rod.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; But when unbelief was out of the house,
[1:34:20] Amen. It was an environment like it was
[1:34:22] in the Holies of Holies.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. that dry that dry rod raised from
[1:34:27] the dead.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He told her, "Give her a drink. She's
[1:34:31] weak. She's not dead. She's sleeping."
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my Jesus Christ, the same
[1:34:40] yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "And we
[1:34:48] I don't know about you. I want to count
[1:34:49] by when brother says we."
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:54] I know there might not have been a mouse
[1:34:56] in the pot. I want to say me right here.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I'm part of the Wii.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Well, John, I'm part of the Wii.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "And we ought to get ourselves
[1:35:06] in that kind of an atmosphere."
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, could we be overcomers this morning?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Funny feeling, you've been riding my
[1:35:18] back long enough.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; You You you demonic power of fear.
[1:35:24] You've been riding my back long enough.
[1:35:26] I've carried you long enough. I've
[1:35:28] babysitted you long enough. It's time to
[1:35:31] go. It's time to get out of these walls.
[1:35:33] Amen. I ain't got no more time for you.
[1:35:36] Deliverance is mine. Healing is mine.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. Joy is mine. How can I
[1:35:43] get it this morning? I'm telling you,
[1:35:45] get into his presence.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. get into his presence
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; and become bread on his table.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle was designed by God to
[1:35:56] take the message and place it in this
[1:35:59] dirt.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And let it live.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And let it live.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Let's put out fear. I'm closing.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Let's put out fear. Let's put out doubt.
[1:36:11] Let's put out unbelief. Invite hope,
[1:36:14] faith, and charity.
[1:36:17] and create an atmosphere for change.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; We're not fighting the battle alone.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Right,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; little David?
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; There is liberty.
[1:36:34] Brother say a husband and wife is no
[1:36:36] longer two
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; but one. Amen.

[1:36:46] with the word. And God is living in
[1:36:48] there himself manifesting.
[1:36:51] There's liberty. There's a countdown.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And she's becoming bread on his table to
[1:36:58] manifest and destroy the works of the
[1:37:00] devil. Flesh of his flesh, bone of his
[1:37:02] bone, life of his life, power of his
[1:37:04] power.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He said, "Life is in the
[1:37:10] grain again."
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Exactly the same grain that went in the
[1:37:15] ground is the same Jesus in bride form.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:37:23] church. With him

[1:37:34] those feelings will have to fall this
[1:37:36] morning. Amen.

[1:37:48] says, "Come here. Let's refresh one
[1:37:49] another and bring in John James. Bring
[1:37:52] in some love. Bring in some charity."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; He said love,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; brother said, "Love is a greatest weapon
[1:38:00] known to man."
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:38:23] love and dismiss those things.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Preacher, Brother Joe. Amen. You want a
[1:38:30] revival? You might lean to let go of
[1:38:32] feelings that you've been holding on and
[1:38:34] haring on against your sister church or
[1:38:37] your brother or your sister.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Martin,
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; don't have to work it up. It'll just
[1:38:53] happen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will restore, say the Lord."
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise God. He said the fourth
[1:39:02] light is to come that will bring forth
[1:39:04] the same signs.
[1:39:06] Watch. He said justification brought the
[1:39:09] pulp. Sanification brought back the bark
[1:39:11] the doctrine of holiness. What brought
[1:39:13] the back the leaf? The Pentecostals.
[1:39:16] Pentecostal leaves clapping, rejoicing,
[1:39:18] shouting. He said the fourth was the
[1:39:21] word itself. The word made flesh and
[1:39:25] listen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Fruits of the proof of his resurrection.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:39:33] justification, sanctification,
[1:39:36] been planted by the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:39] Ghost.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; All hell's been released
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; against this bride.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm surrounded by him.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. All hell's been to released to
[1:39:52] torment you. But if you're a believer,
[1:39:55] oh, I say this morning, we didn't come
[1:39:58] into this fight alone. Greater is he
[1:40:01] that is in you than the he that's in the
[1:40:03] world. Amen. David didn't come alone.
[1:40:06] And this bride is not fighting this

[1:40:31] a bunch have been honed out?"
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; What's that mean? Honed out. Let go of
[1:40:39] some things.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Chipped away.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we do that? That's what that
[1:40:43] two-edged sword is doing this morning.
[1:40:45] It's trying to cut away some freedom
[1:40:47] this morning. He's trying to cut away
[1:40:49] some to that you can reach some liberty
[1:40:51] that you really need for you, your h for
[1:40:54] your spouse, for your home, for your
[1:40:57] church, for your job. Amen. He's wanting
[1:41:00] to cut you loose that you can refresh
[1:41:03] your neighbor this morning. Amen. It's
[1:41:05] just like fire. Shut up in my bone this
[1:41:08] morning.

[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; So they can fit the same kind of
[1:41:15] ministry

[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; When he comes back, he comes back and
[1:41:22] catches this whole thing up to a
[1:41:24] rapture.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; So what is he getting? He's honing you
[1:41:26] down. He's getting everything unlike
[1:41:29] your way. He's honing it out. He's
[1:41:30] dismissing faith or fear and and doubt
[1:41:33] and unbelief and he's pulling in love,
[1:41:36] charity, faith, hope. That's right.

[1:41:49] translation?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; It's transforming power. Amen. Where the
[1:41:54] spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty
[1:41:58] this morning.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to be able to hold you
[1:42:05] down. Sister Katie, there's nothing
[1:42:08] going to be able to hold you down.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, the message has come to hone us
[1:42:13] down, to correct the error, to to give
[1:42:16] you strength, to give you a message of
[1:42:18] hope, message of deliverance.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; And let me finish this. We'll close. He
[1:42:24] says the pyramid, he said that we see
[1:42:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the
[1:42:29] pyramid will stand again. The house of
[1:42:33] God will live again. The tree of life is
[1:42:37] growing again. There's liberty. He's the
[1:42:41] son of man, revealing himself. The word
[1:42:44] is becoming flesh. Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Again,
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; among us.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother said, I challenge you to
[1:42:52] believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in
[1:42:54] the form of the son of man.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Through the bride's body.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Just absolutely word living in an
[1:43:03] individual.
[1:43:06] were just badger skins.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; He said if it hid the glory of God from
[1:43:10] the people, the badger skins, even
[1:43:11] people could see it because it was skin
[1:43:14] that held it.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; The glory of God was behind the skin.
[1:43:19] And now the glory of God is behind your
[1:43:23] skin.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The environment is
[1:43:27] right.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; He said he's going to have a bride
[1:43:30] without spot or wrinkle. God has brought
[1:43:33] the right atmosphere and the environment
[1:43:36] is here. Hell has came. Amen. He's taken
[1:43:39] his people. But Christ has came back. He
[1:43:42] coned. Send it down. God above us. God
[1:43:46] with us. Now God in us.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And holding us down.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Can somebody say, "Lord,
[1:43:54] hold me down."
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Let's dismiss fa doubt.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Let's dismiss unbelief. Let's dismiss
[1:44:03] unbelief and fear and and hurt feelings,
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; bitterness,
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; oh, if we have to get the Holy Ghost to
[1:44:11] get out some these root roots of
[1:44:14] bitterness in our hearts, let's get
[1:44:16] these stony hearts out of the way.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Let's get the environment to right for
[1:44:23] change. Right.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "I got this." But
[1:44:27] brother say, "Yeah." He was talking
[1:44:29] about healing service. He said, "If you
[1:44:31] want to have a healing service, you got
[1:44:32] to get the people in the atmosphere to
[1:44:34] receive healing."
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a work up. Amen. But
[1:44:38] we're dismissing doubt. If you want
[1:44:40] healing, there can't be doubt present.
[1:44:42] If you want deliverance, they can't be
[1:44:44] fear prison. So, what does God try to do
[1:44:46] to prepare service for a healing
[1:44:48] service? Amen. Kick faith. Dismiss. Be
[1:44:51] like Jesus.
[1:44:53] come into the house says, "Oh, no, no,
[1:44:55] no."
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Can you preach women in closing? No, no.
[1:44:59] This ain't going to happen today.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. This hatred's got to go. These
[1:45:03] funny feelings got to go. Amen. This
[1:45:06] hatred and unbelief and fear and
[1:45:09] disbelief got to go. I'm going to
[1:45:12] listen. I'm going to praise you. I'm
[1:45:14] going to replace it with praise. I'm
[1:45:16] going to replace it with worship. Come
[1:45:18] on.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Ain't no rock going to take my place
[1:45:21] this morning. Amen. You got to go.
[1:45:24] [Music]

[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Then go get some love, hope, and faith.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; And have a revival.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Have a revival.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; God's going to get my praise this
[1:45:42] morning.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, Jesus.
[1:45:47] We're in the presence
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; of the one that can make a difference.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; We're in his presence to become bread on
[1:45:59] his table.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; See, how we're going to do it, Joe. Now,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; it's just going to happen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; How we going to take a rapture?
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know. It goes against science.
[1:46:12] It goes against gravitation. I'm just
[1:46:14] here to tell you it's going to happen.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; How you know it's going to happen? Amen.
[1:46:19] Because we're going to get in a right
[1:46:21] atmosphere, right?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; There's going to be an environment
[1:46:24] that's just right. You say, "Oh, no.
[1:46:25] This world's falling apart." Amen. She's
[1:46:27] out. All hell's against us. Amen.
[1:46:30] Religions with powers and doctrines of
[1:46:33] men and doctrines of denominationalism.
[1:46:36] Amen. Political wars.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Countries in war. It's a total chaos. A
[1:46:43] ride in a total chaos.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; God is creating a dynamo full of
[1:46:48] dynamite. Amen. She's going to be so
[1:46:51] full of him. Brother Brian told me the
[1:46:53] other day, "I just want more of him. I
[1:46:56] just want more word. I don't want I want
[1:46:58] less of this other stuff. Give me more
[1:47:00] of Jesus." I'm telling you, this bride's
[1:47:02] going to get in a place of desperation.
[1:47:05] Amen. All she want is more word. More
[1:47:08] word. Less of this and more word. What
[1:47:11] is it going to do? It's going to get the
[1:47:14] people in the right environment.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And she's going to walk and step right
[1:47:18] out of this dimension into a dimension
[1:47:21] there's no more pain. There's no more
[1:47:23] sorrow. There's no more death. There's
[1:47:25] no more hurt. There's no more funny
[1:47:27] feelings. It's not a fairy tale. It will
[1:47:32] happen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, I ain't much. I ain't
[1:47:37] either.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I can't I don't know if I can do it. I
[1:47:40] don't know either. But I know I didn't
[1:47:42] come this fight alone.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; If I'm fighting, I'm sure to lose. If
[1:47:46] David was fighting, he was sure to lose.
[1:47:48] But he's not fighting. This is not my
[1:47:50] battle. Can you say it with me? This is
[1:47:53] not my battle. This is not my battle.
[1:47:56] This is not my battle. Devil, this is
[1:47:58] not my battle. Your children's a stray.
[1:48:01] No gun the devil. Tell the devil this
[1:48:04] morning, "This is not my battle."
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, say with authority. This is not my
[1:48:12] battle.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; This is our Lord's
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; pushing out fear, pushing out doubt,
[1:48:22] pushing out everything. Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden there's just a joy and
[1:48:27] the presence of the Lord is such a
[1:48:30] fullness of joy.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden this sister Sister
[1:48:36] Denisha comes to the piano.
[1:48:41] There's some songs begin to play.
[1:48:46] All of a sudden that old feeling that
[1:48:48] you had is like you know what be like
[1:48:50] that lady.
[1:48:52] I don't feel that anymore.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; She went in there and began to eat more
[1:48:57] of the oats.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
[1:49:02] There's no pain.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; For the first time, I've always had this
[1:49:08] pain. The doctor said that I'd never get
[1:49:10] over it.
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[1:49:20] She had the right attitude. Amen.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; She got created the right atmosphere.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; The environment was just right.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. She went down the road
[1:49:33] screaming, "My God's real. My God's
[1:49:38] real. My God is real."
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; She couldn't wait to go and refresh her
[1:49:43] sister down the road.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; She went down there and there was cars
[1:49:46] everywhere. She don't know what's going
[1:49:48] on. about that time she seen her sister
[1:49:51] said, "Praise God, he's a healer."
[1:49:54] Brother Ram said, "God was at work. God,
[1:49:57] there was such an environment."
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; That those things that was taking those
[1:50:04] people's lives had to be put out.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And that girdle fell off her neck and it
[1:50:10] was gone.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. Can we be like Brother
[1:50:15] Brand? He said when he ate those beans,
[1:50:17] Amen. And he just kept poking them back
[1:50:19] down, poking them back down, poking them
[1:50:21] back down. He said, "Boy, you can't eat
[1:50:23] those things. It'll kill you." He poked
[1:50:25] him back down. Said, "I'm not taking no
[1:50:27] for an answer. God's my healer. God's an
[1:50:30] everpresent help in the time of
[1:50:31] trouble."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] When the doctor said, "You're withered.
[1:50:38] Your stomach is gone. You'll never get
[1:50:40] over this. You'll always have this
[1:50:42] problem."
[1:50:44] Brother said, "You know what? I would
[1:50:47] have been a discouraged boy if it hadn't
[1:50:49] been not been for the vision.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; The vision told him and the in in the
[1:50:53] mess of the wings of a snow white dove.
[1:50:55] He said that he that spirit of the Lord
[1:50:57] spoke out when that squirrel missed his
[1:50:59] mouth and hit his stomach and went and
[1:51:01] fell on that cactus. He went over and
[1:51:03] put his foot upon it and the spirit of
[1:51:05] the Lord came out said, "Your enemy is
[1:51:08] dead."
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; And when the doctor, he went back to the
[1:51:11] doctor, the doctor said, "Brother Brand,
[1:51:13] I ain't got no good news for you. I
[1:51:14] always have that problem." He said, "Oh
[1:51:16] no, doubt, you're dismissed. Oh no,
[1:51:19] fear, you're dismissed."
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; I would have been a discouraged boy. If
[1:51:24] it had not been for the vision.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I say this morning, we're the same way.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to get over the
[1:52:18] mentality cuz we're strong willed
[1:52:21] people.
[1:52:22] We're a bunch of hillbillies. We get set
[1:52:25] in our ways. But sometimes God's saying,
[1:52:29] "You need to let go of this. You need to
[1:52:32] let go of this enough so I can come down
[1:52:34] and show you that I'm still your God and
[1:52:36] I'm your deliverer."
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; That's free this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; I believe that is for somebody. God's
[1:52:42] good. God's mercy.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:58:32] morning.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, let us forget about who we are for
[1:58:36] a moment, Lord.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Let us step into your presence for a
[1:58:42] moment, Lord. Let us feel you once
[1:58:45] again, Lord.
[1:58:49] Let the walls of Jericho fall this
[1:58:51] morning.
[1:58:53] Let the walls of discouragement fall

[1:58:58] Let's put out unbelief for a moment.
[1:59:03] For thou are welcome in this house this
[1:59:05] morning, Lord.
[1:59:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:15] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.

[1:59:22] this morning?
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:31] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:37] Thank you, Jesus.

[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just bow our hearts.
[2:00:03] Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord for this
[2:00:06] opportunity. You give us this kind of
[2:00:08] glory Lord to step in your presence for
[2:00:10] a few moments in this life. Lord God,
[2:00:13] that we can put out everything that's
[2:00:15] unlike you, Lord, and allow the liberty
[2:00:17] bells to begin to ring in our life,
[2:00:20] Lord. Let go of things that we've been
[2:00:22] carrying for so long, Lord God, to allow
[2:00:25] victory in the camp, Lord God. Can we be
[2:00:28] like the lepers that went down to the
[2:00:30] enemy's cave and took back what rightly
[2:00:32] belongs to them, Lord? Can we have that
[2:00:35] mentality? And brother Brown would say
[2:00:37] it like this, Lord. It was their little
[2:00:39] dingy faith that they got encouraged
[2:00:42] enough to say, "This ain't the way I
[2:00:45] should live. This ain't the way I should
[2:00:47] be. This ain't my place of worship. I'm
[2:00:49] going down and take back what belongs to
[2:00:52] me."
[2:00:54] Lord, I pray that somebody could get to
[2:00:56] that place this morning. In the name of
[2:00:59] the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; we pray.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's say of course you sing
[2:01:08] oh peace of God.
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Peace of God cover me.
[2:01:22] Cover me.

[2:02:18] me.

[2:02:28] when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am
[2:02:32] going through the storm.
[2:02:37] Cover me when all seems hopeless. Cover
[2:02:40] me when my strength is gone. Let the
[2:02:44] peace that passes all I understand.
[2:02:50] Cover me.
[2:02:53] Cover me.
[2:02:56] Oh peace of God cover me
[2:03:03] through
[2:03:06] cover only in you.

[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Only
[2:03:18] I
[2:03:20] hallelujah.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's only in you I find peace.
[2:03:26] Hallelujah. Cover me.
[2:03:30] I sing at the hill.
[2:03:32] I always cover me when I am hurting.
[2:03:38] Cover me when I'm not strong.
[2:03:41] Cover me when I am going through the
[2:03:44] storm.
[2:03:46] Oh, cover me when all seems open. Cover
[2:03:51] me when my strength is gone. Let the
[2:03:54] peace that passes all I understand.
[2:03:59] Oh, cover me.
[2:04:02] Oh, cover me when I am hurting. Oh,
[2:04:06] cover me when I am hurting. Cover me
[2:04:10] when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am
[2:04:14] going through the storm.
[2:04:19] Cover me when all seems hopeless. Cover
[2:04:22] me when my strength is gone. Let the
[2:04:26] peace that passes on I understand.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, cover. Hallelujah. Yes. Cover me.
[2:04:36] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this
[2:04:38] morning.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Watch your hand before that word we
[2:04:44] heard this morning. So good to us.
[2:04:48] [Applause]
[2:04:55] He said in in the hand of or out outside
[2:04:58] of the presence of the Lord, that rod
[2:05:00] was just a dry rod and he used it for
[2:05:02] whatever. But when he came into the
[2:05:04] presence of the Holy of Holies, it began
[2:05:06] to bring forth the original purpose of
[2:05:09] what it had.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're here this morning,
[2:05:12] you may be a dry rod. You might be a
[2:05:15] dead stick that Satan used out there in
[2:05:18] the world to do whatever he wanted to
[2:05:19] use you for, but you just come and lay
[2:05:21] in his presence and that original
[2:05:24] purpose of what God had inside of you
[2:05:26] will begin to bring forth life.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's certainly good this morning.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Let's just as we get ready to go, let's
[2:05:33] sing that song. I've been changed. I've
[2:05:36] been reborn.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; All my life has been rearranged. When
[2:05:40] you make come into that presence, the
[2:05:42] Lord will come and he'll rearrange
[2:05:43] everything and you'll begin to do that
[2:05:45] which he has promised for you, purposed
[2:05:47] for you.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I've been to the water and I've
[2:05:51] been baptized. I've been washed by the
[2:05:55] blood of the lamb.
[2:05:58] Well, I've been changed from the
[2:06:00] creature that I once was and redeemed is
[2:06:05] now my name.
[2:06:07] Oh, and I've been changed.
[2:06:10] Oh, I've been reborn now and all my life
[2:06:14] has been rearranged.
[2:06:18] Oh, what a difference it makes when the
[2:06:21] Lord has his way. All my life, praise
[2:06:25] God, have been changed.
[2:06:28] And though my sins were as scared,
[2:06:31] they're white as snow. I was bound, but
[2:06:34] today I am free.
[2:06:38] Oh, I was lost out in darkness, but now
[2:06:42] I'm found. I was blind, but now I see.
[2:06:47] Cuz I've been changed.
[2:06:50] Oh, I've been reborn, but now all my
[2:06:53] life has been rearranged.
[2:06:57] Oh, what a difference it makes when the

[2:11:38] Oh, I just thank you this morning. Let's
[2:11:41] just bow our heads now. Heavenly Father,
[2:11:43] we just come before you thanking you for
[2:11:45] the word that you spoke to us, oh God.
[2:11:47] Lord, that we just know we just got to
[2:11:49] get in your presence, Father, and you'll
[2:11:51] settle the rest, oh God. Lord, there's
[2:11:53] nothing that we can do, Father, that we
[2:11:54] can work up, Father, but we just got to
[2:11:57] sit in that presence, in the presence of
[2:11:59] the sun, Father, and the life will just
[2:12:01] bring forth. Oh, God. We just pray that
[2:12:04] you would just bless brother Joe for
[2:12:06] pouring out himself this morning,
[2:12:07] Father. May you just give strength and
[2:12:08] virtue to him. God, just bless him.
[2:12:11] Lord, be with those that are coming back
[2:12:13] from Manchester, our pastor, and those
[2:12:15] that went with him. Father, watch over
[2:12:16] them. Give them traveling mercies. Lord,
[2:12:18] we just love you. We thank you. Be with
[2:12:20] us as we go about our week. Father, just
[2:12:22] be with each one. Bring us back safely
[2:12:25] Wednesday, ready to hear your word,
[2:12:26] Lord. We just commit everything to you.
[2:12:28] We just say we love you. We thank you.
[2:12:30] We appreciate you. In Jesus name I pray.
[2:12:33] Amen. And amen.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory is
[2:12:41] mine. Oh, victory today is mine.
[2:12:46] Because I told Satan to get thee behind.
[2:12:52] Oh, victory. Oh, God bless you as you go
[2:12:55] this morning. Oh, and when I woke this
[2:12:58] morning,
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; I didn't have a doubt. I knew that my
[2:13:02] Lord would bring me out.
[2:13:06] So, I got down on my knees. I said,
[2:13:08] "Lord, help me please." And I got up
[2:13:12] singing and shouted to victory.
[2:13:15] I'm singing. Victory is mine. Oh,
[2:13:18] victory is mine.
