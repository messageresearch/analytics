it's a reality Jesus keeps holding me are you thankful for it amen the prophet of God brother John said I would have let go a long time ago but it wasn't him it wasn't me holding him it was him holding me amen I've been through some great trials in my life and just like the song said but Cody I was ready to give up I was ready to quit and that strin sister Destiny got to running a little loose in my life but Brother David one day that line begin to tighten up to truth and it echoed back in my heart I had you you the whole time oh are you thankful for the absolute tonight hallelujah hallelujah my I just feel his presence tonight I I know we might be a little sliming crowd but this is a big crowd in a lot of churches I preach at a lot of churches a lot less than this amen we have church and I think we're going to have church here tonight and God's still moving if you got your Bibles I invite you to Hebrews chapter 11 last time we was with you I was uh I meant to get to this uh some of this that night and and we had communion and I was lingering a little too long and so we didn't get into it so um we uh we're going to take a whole service on it tonight Lord's willing and and um May the Lord just richly bless each and each and every one of you here tonight and the one ones that may be listening online and different ones we've been ministering to and witnessing to and visiting with if they Beyond we want to greet them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as well amen God's good isn't he Hebrews 11:1 says now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand the worlds refrained by the the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice then came by which he obtained witness that he was a righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that come to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that disly seeks him amen God bless you just bow our hearts one more time tonight if you got a need just make it known to the author I believe he can minister to your needs through the ministering of the word tonight that's a that's a beauty of the gift that God places in a man's life that that can be operated by you and I tonight if you're willing to pull on the gift God's willing to answer and and minister to your need tonight God bless you let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for this opportunity tonight Lord to worship you one more time father and we come to your throne of mercy and Grace Lord and Lord we want to give you a special thanks for the outpouring of your spirit over the last few Services here our anniversary meetings Lord how that you showed up and showed out Lord you ministered to people's lives Lord L God and Lord we're here tonight Lord God expecting you to move One More Time Lord God and speak to each and every one of our hearts Lord we pray Lord God every hand that risen every heart that's needing tonight Lord we pray that you'll Minister through those needs Lord we ask you to bless the reading of your word and every word that would be spoken tonight Lord we commit this time into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can have now Paul States here that in Hebrews that faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and and then he goes on to say through this Faith this element of faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God and I thought how powerful that is tonight that God had faith in his own word amen when he spoke it amen he wasn't questioning it he actually he's already seen it and he already seen it materializing and my he can speak by faith and faith is a revelation amen and faith is a revelation of the will of God in your life and faith unlocks and Faith sees and Faith hears and Faith understands and faith is Burly and my you can come through the message and and as the Propet of this age begin to tell us and Faith could see and Faith could hear and faith is a victory that overcomes the world and and then Hebrews would begin to tell us fa by faith Enoch by faith uh uh uh uh uh Abel by faith Noah by faith Abraham by faith Sarah by faith Rahab the Harlot by faith Moses and and they overcome by faith and he goes on and and then Paul makes a statement here and he says you know it's impossible to please God with without faith and I was thinking if it's impossible to please God without faith and it's impossible without faith things are impossible but on the other hand what will Faith do amen if you if you're a message listener tonight you can't hardly listen to a message that our Prophet preached amen don't elaborate on faith in some way because it's who we are we're moved by the faith of God Heen we're led by the faith of God we make Footprints by the faith of God Amen the believer is led by the spirit of God which is orchestrated by faith and the prophet of God would say a six sense so faith is the victory that overcomes the world mine and it releases if I had a title tonight is releasing the power amen Faith actually releases the power and I was thinking here a few months ago when I was preaching on those those lepers and and those lepers was coming to Jesus needing an answer needing some healing amen needed Deliverance they was well stricken and and sickness and their body was felling them amen they came to the master said thest thou son of David have mercy upon me and and G and God begin to move in their behalf and and all he was all he did Brother David was give him a word he said go show yourself to the priest and the scripture says as they went and then it goes on and says as they went it began to release a power to them that leprosy could not hold them any longer praise God amen so obedience to the Master's words released a power that hell couldn't handle Hallelujah and we realize tonight is we uh We've if we come through the Bible and and we can look at all the promises in the Bible brother Noah amen I believe that it's told that there's over what 8,000 different promises concerning the church and my there's promises laying down All Through the Bible and but what good would it be to be written on the pages if there wasn't a power that could release unto us the promises of God and make it not just a letter in a book but let it become a real reality in our lives and in our church services come on somebody amen we can release a a power if we have enough Faith tonight I believe there could be a power that's released in this Tabernacle tonight amen that that every demonic power of hell would feel uncomfortable as brother wayy was preaching here Friday night amen I believe there's a lot of demons that begin to feel uncomfortable amen as he begin to minister on just praising him amen listen friends I I don't care what the church down the road says about praising God Heen you take worship and praise out of the church you've got a dead assembly Heen listen friends if there's no praise and worship there's no moving right come on and we may get to that if time terries tonight we always got to throw that in you know the preacher once said you know and I got a watch here on my phone but I don't wear a watch he said you know what a watch means to a preacher absolutely nothing but we'll try to be mindful of it on Wednesday night for sure but but there's thousands of promises and even these lepers obedience to the word of God it changed their lives come on somebody it wasn't they didn't they didn't go to the Revival down the road they didn't have to wait on a special meeting somewhere they begin to cry we'll get to these things if you bear with me tonight they begin to cry cry unto the master and the master heard their cry and he just brother Ben he just simply gave them a word amen and they obeyed the word just like they did amen and my mind goes back just like they did that day in Egypt amen when the death angel was fixing a Passover that God ministered to the hearts of his Believers amen he dropped the word down there and told him amen apply the blood kill the innocent lamb and apply the Blood on the doorpost of your homes amen and when they begin to apply the blood according to the word of a king that night when the death angel was passing by amen listen friends he went into a lot of homes there was a lot of innocent kids that died that night Brother David but every home that appli the token on it released a power that hell could not entered into that home I say if he's the same God yesterday he's a still the same God here tonight and if we'll be obedient to the word of God and we apply the token the life of Jesus Christ my when that Death Angel passed by he might have tried everything Brother David he could do to get into that home but that home was sealed there was peace in the home there was Revival in the home I say there's Revival in the home I believe there's a Revival in our this house too amen it's a bubbling tonight you love the Lord Mark 9 and 23 says Jesus said unto him if thou C believe all can you say all withen tonight all things are possible to him that believeth so there's no limit to what God can do tonight if we will believe so God brother B said God will bless he said but the blessing sister Tammy has got to come under under certain circumstances or requirements certain requirements that you must meet we've always heard the the the the the slogan you know amen if one person gets healed if the next person could ever come under that same place or that same meet God with that same requirement right that he's he was God and he's faithful church we we're many times we're not faithful but we serve a god that is very faithful he's faithful to his word listen friends he's faithful to this message my and he goes on he said if you don't meet those requirements then the blessings or the promise of God is none effect to you anywhere that you meet God's requirements that's where you're healed the power he goes he say says then the power that will rais us up is right in us now how many believes that how many really believes that tonight the power that raised us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters would create a world out here and go live on a private life on it you have the power in you to do it brother ch got a shadow the power of God in you you got power to do it he says God's omnipotent see he says see what I mean the power that's in you he said you could speak a world into existence and go live on it he says hallelujah he says there you are that's what the power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is he said that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments he simply says it's the loss is a joice of Faith Jesus said all things are possible that them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God would lead your soul to believe he says that is yours every place The Souls of your your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you right there's a law when a Believer takes the step of faith it releases a power that leprosy can't handle amen so when there's a there's a law and then whenever a person meet that law my it releases a power it releases Heaven just like it did to those 10 lepers that received their healing as they went to meet the priest he says amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith it opens up to you he says see what I mean the power is controlled by it if you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God it that listen this that never leaves you oh isn't that good tonight that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith is away from it but it's still there says hallelujah no matter where you are tonight amen just like brother Brown said I quoted in my after my prayer brother Matt that line run loose for a season but it was always there job was tied to his absolute but he said it was running loose sometimes we get to that place ch church amen it runs loose in our lives brother the prophetic gift in this hour says Sister Janice it never left you it was always with you it was always by your side it was there all the time Hallelujah he says when you are saved God gives you the faith same quote to rise from the muck of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world he said what is your Faith your faith is the act that God had did in you to make you a Son of God you quit your lion you quit your stealing you quit your drinking you quit your doping you quit your smoking Hallelujah my that brings a freedom a freedom to worship a freedom to praise him tonight I come to church tonight for one reason to praise my God the move is on Satan keeps padding things in our lives but we as a Believer just keep on keeping on and no matter what comes our way we're willing to praise the god tonight we're willing to let go of our feelings we're really we're will to let go of things that that so easily beset us tonight things that keeps our spirit troubled things that keep us down a little bit things that keeps the little differences between the brother and sisters amen we're willing tonight to let those feelings go cuz if we would ever realize it is not your brother it's not your sister but it's only a demonic power of hell that's trying to break unity in a body of Believers no matter how much you dislike somebody's dominor maybe they don't act the way that you act this is free brother man this is your job no matter how they act you know what me and Matt brother Matt we hang out a lot we maybe go to places a lot but just because I like pretzels doesn't mean that Matt likes pretzels there's some things brother Matt don't like that I do and there's some things I probably don't like about brother Matt I had found one yet but I'll find one eventually but no matter what we we as brothers and sisters in a church body will have to come to grip we're realizing we are individuals and we're trapped in mortality and we we all got our own personalities and no matter if you like somebody's personality or not you've got to come to a place to let that thing go and be able to worship God begin to praise God and don't allow to become a bring you under captivity and throw in the prisons of the door Hells Door bar of hell I'll get it out in a minute he's only trying to trap us and keep us bound on how many wants to be bound nobody wants to be bound tonight amen but there's only a trick of the devil to try to get us to a place where we can't worship and praise God my church when it we we come to this this TP of Le when we coming through those back doors amen we we and I'm preaching at brother Joe tonight too we need to learn and to let go of all of our feelings all of our things that's happening on the job everything's happening around us maybe somebody cut you off during dur your day and and you got upset and it troubled your spirit but it's time to let those things go amen cuz we don't want nothing to stand in between amen somebody receiving healing somebody receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost somebody being that's been trapped being set free amen that's what this Tabernacle is all about tonight this is not padded pews to come as a social gathering this is the Church of a living God and God's wanting to move I don't know where all that come from but it took up a little bit of my time but Faith Rises you above it if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by faith you're saved and that through Grace listen to this this right here as much as your faith will be release that's how much power you can have how much faith will be released that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God dwells in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen there you are but he said but it's your faith fa Faith brings Jesus Christ present Faith unlocks the door brother Brown said Brother David he said faith is that little whip by your side and he said if you allow it it can take you to every promise are you hearing me tonight brother John that whip that setting on your side I don't need brother Matt's whip I don't need your whip he said your wh whip that is standing by your side can take you brother Cody to every promise in the book Mark 5 Mark 523 is that my grandson praising the Lord back there something like that and besought him greatly saying my little daughter layeth at the point of death I pray thee come lay hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood for 12 years and has suffered many things from many Physicians spent all the that she had listen and was not none better but rather grew worse now we realize that probably God would tell us that this lady lived on a hill up there and I ain't got that in my notes but he said he would go begin to tell us that sister Tammy that she could even walk she didn't have a strength to carry on but she heard Jesus was passing by my brother ra said that lady you know 12 years with a blood issue had no energy had no strength she couldn't even hardly walk without somebody helping her made her way off the top of that mountain crawling down to Jesus she's been through a lot she spent all of her money and she only got worse but when she heard of Jesus coming she pressed through every trial everybody tell him there's no hope for her everybody tell him there's no way you can get to Jesus there's no way you could stop him tonight you've got too bad of a pastor ever stop Jesus but she had one thing on her mind if I can only touch but the HM of His Garment right come on and that hym just dangled off of his garment see and maybe Jesus sister Destiny maybe Jesus could even naturally feel it that woman brother Travis maybe spent hours hours on top of hours coming down that Hillside to make her way to Jesus she crossed a lot of Rocky places and Shop rocks and logs and traps of hell every demonic power and amen was trying to stop this visitation every demon the Demonic power of hell was trying to stop this predestinated moment of time remember he was trying to stop Sarah visitation brother I don't know how he knew it but she was he was trying to stop it and no doubt everything he could do to throw in her way he was trying to stop her from receiving her healing Heen she Hey listen the the devil didn't care for going to the doctors but she he didn't he had a real problem with her getting to Jesus amen for she said I must touch brother's clothes and I shall be whole and straight way the fountain her blood was dried up and she felt in her body body that she was healed of that plague glory and Jesus immediately knowing in himself listen friends she was healed even before she heard her words of Jesus Amen then G it stopped Jesus in IMM knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and the disciples said to him thou the multitude they're all touching you they're all reaching out to you what do you mean who touched me and he looked around about to see her that has done this thing but the woman fearing and tremoring knowing that was done into her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith thy faith released the power to heal your body hallelujah amen your faith what faith conquering Satan's traps right Conquering the the ability that she said there's no way I can make it it was her faith that she took a step past the negativity of the church negativity of the doctors negativity of her mind negativity of her body and made her way to the foot of Jesus and just simply church as you can do tonight just simply she wasn't making a fuss she wasn't making a stew she didn't need anybody's attention she just simply by faith the whole journey was by faith the whole journey was of faith and when she reached up and touched the Garment by faith it released heaven brother R would picked that up he said like the woman with the blood issue all the people passing by all of them standing up saying there goes Rabbi that's a guy that claims to be a Prophet this is fanatic and all such as that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she came down there regardless of what anybody would say she recognized Who the Master was and said if I can only touch His Garment and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release he said it released his power to heal she fought through many things no I'm not giving up come on Church many time brother Cody she got to a place her energy was all gone maybe her knees was bleeding from all the Rocks brother the mark she was she was fighting with the the infirmity in her body of weakness and loss of strength she was skin and bones but there was just something inside of her says don't give up keep pressing the battle amen what was it the same quote I read to you he said many times you don't feel it but he's never left you and she felt like she was deserted on her journey down to Jesus but there was a there was [Applause] anointing man I I believe this I it was a coincidence that Jesus was passing by her way but before the foundation of the world God seen her delivered I say he's a save God here tonight Hallelujah if we could just fight through it say no no she called Jesus on the scene by his proven word he's now waiting for you to call him on the scene to be proved so let us go and awake Jesus in our lives how do you wake Jesus by believing the word faith brings him on the scene he said are you afraid to wake Jesus in your life come on he said brother said are you afraid awake Jesus in your life I know this the minister of this church don't believe Jesus is the is way off in the milkway somewhere but but was it brother Wayne somebody this weekend that that was speaking might have been brother Tim on Saturday night but he said this message is to declare he is here not in a corporate body but as brother Tim said of the appearing which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen he's always there he never leaves you he'll never forsake you he says are you afraid to wake that thing that a few years ago had come down upon you and filled you with his blessings he said are you afraid to wake him up and say Lord Jesus I'm in trouble tonight move on the scene for me he says in the sailing the Seas I've been stricken with a disease I'm Afflicted help me oh Lord God help me he said are you afraid to call him on the scene he keeps asking this question to the church are you are you afraid to call him on the scene he says no when you call him on the scene like the disciples all doubts takes his seat and sits down Glory brother amen when you recognize and you call Jesus on the scene doubt leprosy has to sit down and take their place doubts are no longer because faith has tuck the place faith of one individual like this insufficient person here in the building tonight will bringing from glory to this building here to prove that he's still the Son of God the same yesterday today and forever he said faith in one individual that don't mean nobody nothing to nobody nobody hardly talks to them maybe nobody recognize you from the pull pit but the god that can deliver fake can release a power to that person in this building that will bring from from Glory bring him from glory to this building here tonight just like the three Hebrews children did just before they walked in the fiery furnace they brought Heaven down into their fiery furnace The Obedience to the word of God I am not going to Bow before you oh King I'm going to stay true to God's purpose in my life oh can I have a witness in Grace Tabernacle tonight say I'm going to stay true to the vision of Grace Tabernacle not my vision but the vision of almighty God and I'm here to tell you church that same God that dropped down into the fire out of the just brother Bown would make a statement said just enough heat to burn the lashes off of their heads and feet cuz you know why cuz he wanted them to give him some praise Hallelujah and brother B said just cuz they could shout and scream and holler and have a jubilee in their fire oh Hallelujah 2,000 years ago brother Cody Jesus said it's finished he took the very heat out of every fire out of cancer out of depression out of funny feelings he took the heat out of it now you're steady he said brother Bown said he took the heat but he let the fire keep on going and now you're overcoming and Satan's fire in 2024 amen the fires are Brewing so great come on but Satan had us Bound for so many years but one day one day the Holy Spirit be to brood over my soul and that other nature came to life I ran for I came to church come on somebody I was that same person I cut my teeth on a message Pew but I went a long time with the B without the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you know what the difference as I was cut my teeth growing up I was in and out and backslid and doing all kinds of things still coming to church still raising my hands still doing the things as a ritual but one day amen when I came in contact with the person of the Holy Ghost amen it changed my life amen I come to church different amen amen you know Satan has no hold on me any longer my hands are free my feet are free my lips are free come hell tries to bind us but let me tell you who the son is made free is free indeed tonight yeah you hear that hand claps of praise tonight tonight for because Jesus is not dead my Lord and Savior is not dead his power is not dead his anointing is not dead and I got some good news neither is his bride she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power Hallelujah so when the odds are against you doctor says there's no way I think as brother Wayne said how many's got healed with cancer the doctors gave gave a lot of men bad reports like one of the brothers said just it's stuck with me I've told Brother David twice and I've told wickness mad a couple times like man down in Little Rock that was 150 something people at a DEA and dumb institution that Reed their healing God can do whatever he wants to do there's just so much power in this Tabernacle tonight it's right everything we have need of can be released to us extra extra read all about it that's one of my favorites one John Ryan says extra extra Read All About It praise God God I'm Healed brother Brown said he just kept testifying brother Mark kept testifying brother R said the most powerful weapon is a committal and a confession and John Ryan was doing both of them he was committed to God and he begin to confess extra extra read all about it he said brother R said John Ryan come into the next meeting he'd be back there screaming on top of his lungs extra extra Read All About It praise God I'm Healed John you're still blind no doubt the devil's telling him John you can't see John there's no way you can see doctors told you boy you was born without eyeballs you can never see on and he just kept on confessing and brother R says the little boy L let him across come on a little boy leted this man across the street to a barber shop was led in by humility by a little lad led him to the seat and that's so smart elec Barber he said wanted to make some fun of him so he lathered him up with the face right good and all the other Barbers and winked his eyes at him because he knew John couldn't see he said got to shaving him got about high H half side down had a laying up there you know he said say papa Ryan he said yes son said I heard you go over there that Holy Roller up there yeah I did he said hm I heard that you got healed he said yes I did praise the Lord for healing me and when he did that come on when he did that his eyes eyes came open in the barber chair I know we've heard these stories all our life could you imagine all he simply did Brother Phil yes I did I was down that Revival this weekend brother Wayne was preaching doctor said this about me and doctor said that about me come on I heard another man at the meeting said praise God I'm Healed for cancer May there may be cancer still alive in his body I don't know but if I was in his place I would be screaming it I'm Healed I'm Healed and John Ry by faith answers the critics one more time in front of all those laughing Barbers everybody that was in the room Brother David praise God he wasn't ashamed of it praise God I am healed and you can imagine if we can unveil the supernatural maybe weeks it's been falling around and all of a sudden his faith released the power that superseded the doctor's reports come on and eyeballs was formed in John Ryan's head and his eyes came open he said out of the Cherry jumped with a towel around his neck and the barber running down the door with a razor in his hand down the street old man Ry just as hard as he could go screaming and shouting praise the Lord he has healed me he said John Ryan was holding on to the six sense hallelujah how many tonight can hold on to the six sense so you know Sister Joyce what the six sense does it be to declare when brother Brown prayed for John Ryan and brother Brown said go testify that wasn't just words he was trying to get the people you go back and come through the message keep praising God don't stop you're almost there keep pray there goes that man out words what was he doing he was getting them to a place that the heavens could be released upon that service upon their lives and he told John Ryan go testify and he held on to that six cense and that six cense begin to declare to him he's healed and he rather he rather took the report of the six sense besides report of his feelings his body or the doctors and he held on to it until he walked right into a body with well eyes oh his word is true you see the Bible was promised it I'm running out of time tonight they stay right there and cry until you get it I sent this brother Mt we he sent me the one on the the blood issue but he said you see the Bible promised it stay right there and cry until

on keep on you have arrived there just keep on knocking until it happens come on what was that telling the devil tonight I'm not quitting no wh every where I'm at I'm not giving up you hear that Satan every one of us should have a knock in our lives letting the devil know whose side we're on tonight amen I'm not giving up I'm not quitting for me and my house we're going to praise the Lord we're going to worship the King of Kings we're going to sing the songs of Zion we're going to shout we're going to run we're going to dance who I am brother real says that's the only thing that this word will produce is a bunch of KN he said I believe it Lord I'm on your hands I'm on your hands I remember the Lord healed me of that stomach trouble and the devil said you haven't got healed I just stuck around and listen to me testify you want to listen to it you want to hear God beay praised he said just stick around and listen at me a while he got tired and went on way oh my come on how many wants to wear the devil out tonight he said finally got so tired and and listen in a while he got out of the way so he will do it the other day he tried to give me a bad cold he handed it to me and I knocked and gave it back to him he handed me again I knocked I gave it back to him and when he just fought on the three or four days and finally the devil went away so there you are just keep handing it back to him just keep handing it back to him just to receive it take it and give it back to him give it back to him he says that's a way to do it just be determined to hold on tonight and wear out wear out those Devils hands it to me give it back to when the believer I'm hurrying when the believer and God gets turning together it generates and releases a power of Resurrection he said everything is in line the only thing you have to do is electricity has push the button but on never do any good for either one for your healer and your salvation until you accept it as your own personal property and then and only then it comes into effect effect is the power to produce the results right bring about or make it happen it's only when you accept it as your own then you can speak with authority and say that's mine that's mine and he said the devil will stand at your window and say hey you can't do that you can't W he said he says you you can't do that well I say you can't watch me if the devil tell me I can't praise ain't no Rock going to take my place Hallelujah as as Sister Jordan saying Devils get out of my way God's going to get my praise that's right now you better not testify that you're healed before you feel something he said feel something brother I believe something Hallelujah faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God I ain't I I'm not waiting on a feeling I believe God's real I'm not waiting on the sensation I believe God is real he's real and every promise in the book is mine all these promises in this book but what good are they if they laid in book form but God would send us a power called Faith a confession a committal to release a power there she goes right there healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ John Ryan running out of the barber chair Georg e cter his brother David testified in the back received her healing amen couldn't even walk but she walked over there started playing the piano been bed stricken for what was nine years been bed strick all that time but God came down in the neighborhood brother Matt said Sunday or amen God came down in the neighborhood and her faith brother s she just read of a in the paper I believe it was of a baptism and she wanted to go be a part of the baptism and her heart learned to be just just she wanted to be in the presence of Believers she wanted to be in the house of God and God who's rich in Mercy would get a hold of a prophet and Lead that man of God down to Georgie Carter's house come on somebody aen to open up and release their power for Georgie Carter to get out of her deathbed and walk and be whole Hallelujah you say brother Brown says you say it isn't effective to me maybe you're leaving them as words on a page man I've got I'm not halfway done that's fful God's good isn't he that's what happens you preach at home know God's faithful but the problem would tell you maybe you're leaving it on the page that the promises is there but he's trying to get you to a place that you can release a power that you can open up every door Hallelujah brother B said I he given you a master key go ahead brother man read your letter I wrote him a love letter says Matthew Morris I give you the keys to the kingdom it's the master key that unlocks every door to every promise what a promise but as long as it lays there in paper form Ma and talk about how good God is and how good his Blessing is and every promise in the book is his he's got a key that unlocks every door but Satan can sit there and beat him up until he actually comes and gets the key that the paper is talking about how's he going to do that the same way the lady with an issue of blood would walk for Miles Crawling by faith to get the key that unlocks every door now it changes his attitude changes come on somebody one thing to be on the page it's another when you actually possess a key that unlocks every promise in the book but David me something Tim when you bought your house you talked about it but how did it feel when you actually got the key and you unlocked the door and you walked in and says this is my bedroom this is my restroom this is my kitchen this is where I come and D this is my living room this is where I rest Hallelujah it means something to you and the devil can't talk you out of it every time the devil says man you can't have what's behind that door he said you came a little too late you came a Day Too Late Heen I've got the key that unlocked the door healing is mine Deliverance is mine salvation is mine Hallelujah Love Is Mine hope is mine Joy is mine Hallelujah grace mercy every promise in the book is mine can we stand to our feet tonight won't you give a lord a hand clap of Praise clap like you mean it John Ryan you are healed and that's what that paper was brother Matt that was brother brandom telling John Ryan you're healed but it was up to John just like those lepers go down to the priest and make yourself known and Matt came as he went he grabbed a hold of a key and Prophet God said he handed you a master key that unlocks every Promises of God oh he's good isn't he Hallelujah and job says Thou speakest like a foolish woman the lord gave and the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord and was so certain that there was a God and when he got that out of his mouth it released a power brother Brown said the Thunders begin to Roar and the lightning begin to flash God moved on the scene Hallelujah isn't that what you want tonight to allow God to be moved on the scene Hallelujah [Music] man man it's hard to quit I didn't even get to my good stuff I didn't think tonight but God's good I'm going to go ahead and quit There Brother David told me he said you know he was listening to series a brother preach one time when he's off at week and a week or so or gone on a working trip or something and he said man the brother would only preach 45 50 minutes an hour and drop it off and he said man I couldn't wait till the next service to hear it again I said well maybe I should be a little short- winded God's good to us amen I just love the Lord and sure thank him for his many blessings here tonight and what a move that Grace

wonderful to be freed by the blood of Jesus Christ my wasn't that a wonderful message how many appreciates brother Joe and pouring his heart out tonight I thought that was good releasing the power of God what releases the power of God in your life Faith releases the power of God praising God releases releases the power of God spiritual worship releases the power of God isn't it something to release God's power in your life there's ways to release his power the potential is there but we just have to release it in our life that just makes me feel good tonight you realize brother Mark people worship all over the world and they don't get nothing from God that's right you know just worship ain't what it ain't just spiritual worship that gets makes you closer to God or ain't just spiritual worship that does it but it's knowing what you worship one one person they can praise and shout and dance all over and it won't get nothing no never get any closer to God but when you know who it is that you worship it opens up a power that there ain't the devil can't take away when you know who it is brother B say that's what the problem with these people are today he said that don't believe believe in the power of God or the power of healing is because they don't have a real father they don't know who their real father is but I thank God I have a real father that when I worship I I'm not just making noise I'm talking to the god that created me whenever we come to church and you lift your hand and praise God I don't I don't believe in a quiet church I don't I just don't believe in it I I can't find a place in the Bible where Jesus came present that nobody made any noise I believe that we ought to be able to worship God there's some life in us there's some emotion in us they call it an emotion it is an emot emotion but it's an emotion that has been caused by something on the inside of it it's a Sanctified life that's been changed by God that makes an emotion come out of this old dead corrupted old Corporal body and causes me to worship my God he's a wonderful God I know who my father is therefore I worship him I make it known but Joe said Till the devil knows that he said devil just stick around a little while if you want to hear somebody worship God in the midst of a trouble then just stay around me a little while cuz that's all you're going to hear out of these lips is somebody saying praise the Lord that's why we y to tell the devil next time just get you a seat and sit down if you like to hear Satan if you like to hear people worship God I know you can't stand it cuz you got kicked out of heaven because that's all they did up there and if you like to hear people worship God then go ahead and get you a bucket of popcorn and a chair and a good recliner and set up over by me for a little while cuz that's all you're going to hear out of these lips it don't matter what you bring up on my life I'm going to worship God you may as well sit back and enjoy the show devil cuz I come to worship God you can bring trial you can bring pressure you can bring sickness you can bring heartache but I'm still going to worship God so enjoy the show if that's what you're here to criticize well enjoy the show I'm going to worship God if you're here to make fun enjoy the show I'm going to worship God if you're here to persecute enjoy the show I'm going to worship God but I want God I want God to know that I love him and I want to give him everything that I have he he set us free he set us free gave us a ride he gave us the key gave us the key my brother Joe that was powerful what good did the letter do if you didn't go get it I never had I got a brand new truck I know brother Joe has some nice trucks any one of them be nice to drive that's that box truck that's that's a good one too praise the Lord isn't that wonderful to have the key I don't know that that that felt good to me to see the letter and then to actually have the key it's difference than just to read it than having the key how many can lift your hand to the Lord and say Lord that's what I want put the key in my hand that unlocks every door maybe we just sing this song before we go in the key of SE well sometimes I just want to praise you oh sometimes just to speak your name oh I say sometimes I just want to thank you oh without asking you for a [Music] thing well sometimes I lift my hands to you oh and sometimes all I do is cry but everything that I have I owe to you oh Lord and calvaries the reason why for I know I was lost but you knew where to find me amen how many say Amen to that I was hungry thank you Lord but you were bread for my soul when I was thirsty you gave me living water and you were my shelter when I had no thank you Lord place to go so I say sometimes I just want to praise you and sometimes I just want to speak your [Music] name oh sometimes I just want to thank you yes Lord without asking you for a thing and sometimes I lift my hands to you oh when sometimes all I do is cry will everything that I have I owe to you to you Lord and calvaries the reason why amen let's just bow our heads we want to remember sister Paige in prayer and just had her baby the other other night and in the middle of the night during the me the meetings and so we just want to ask the Lord to continue to touch her in recovery and bless that little fellow we went over there and and and help for a little while yesterday so just wonderful to see a new life but we just want to remember her in prayer tonight amen you how many appreciates the presence of the Lord amen how may just tell him how much you love him isn't he isn't it something just to just to say Lord I love you as we as we close the service in prayer won't you just tell him how much you love him Lord I
