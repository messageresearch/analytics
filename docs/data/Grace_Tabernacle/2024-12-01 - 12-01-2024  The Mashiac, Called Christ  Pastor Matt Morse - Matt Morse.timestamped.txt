[43:01] you this morning as you would take your
[43:03] Bibles I want to invite you to the book
[43:05] of Isaiah and we're going to read out of
[43:07] the 10th chapter and we'll start in the
[43:10] 24th verse so Isaiah the 10th chapter
[43:13] and the the 24th verse we'll give you
[43:15] just a moment a moment to get there and
[43:18] man how many loves the word amen we sure
[43:21] love the word of God Amen and and I we
[43:24] just want to see something in it all all
[43:27] all the time to allow God to bring
[43:28] Revelation to our hearts how many loves
[43:30] Revelation amen it's what'll give you
[43:32] power over the enemy when you know who
[43:34] you are and what you stand for and who
[43:37] the enemy is and uh it sure makes a it
[43:39] sure makes a stronger believer so I want
[43:42] to read from Isaiah the 10th chapter and
[43:44] we're going to start in the 24th verse
[43:46] the Bible says therefore thus sayeth the
[43:48] Lord God of hosts oh my people that
[43:50] dwellest in
[43:53] Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he
[43:56] shall smite thee with a rod and he shall
[43:59] lift up his staff against thee after the
[44:01] manner of Egypt for yet a very little
[44:03] while and the in in indignation shall
[44:06] cease and mine anger in their
[44:08] destruction and the Lord of hosts shall
[44:10] steer up a Scourge for him in other
[44:12] words he would stir up a whip or a
[44:14] whipping a Scourge for him according to
[44:16] the slaughter of Midian at the rock of
[44:19] orb now here God as he's as he's telling
[44:21] the people what he's going to do he
[44:23] brings their mind back to the day of of
[44:26] Gideon when Gideon fought the great
[44:28] battle and what God done to the
[44:29] midianites at the hand of Gideon he said
[44:31] I will stir up a Scourge according to
[44:34] the slaughter of meting at the Rock in
[44:35] other words it'll be like it was when
[44:37] Gideon went down uh to the
[44:57] of the anointing and I would like to
[44:59] take from this this morning and speak a
[45:02] message on the Mesi called Christ the
[45:06] mashiach called Christ and we'll just
[45:08] ask you to take your seats this morning
[45:11] now as a reading out of the scripture of
[45:14] Isaiah uh here uh the Bible would tell
[45:17] us just to kind of lay a foundation of
[45:19] how that Israel here was in bondage to
[45:23] this Assyrian army this was a great a
[45:25] great enemy a great f
[45:27] uh this great Army had came through many
[45:30] nations and they would come to the land
[45:32] of Israel and the Lord as he's speaking
[45:35] of these things he would speak of the
[45:36] Yoke of bondage that there would come a
[45:38] time when this yoke would be removed or
[45:40] this yoke of Oppression would be removed
[45:42] off of their neck and and you realize
[45:45] that that that he's telling Israel that
[45:47] this yoke of bondage is a temporary yoke
[45:49] and there this this oppression it's a
[45:51] temporary thing and and and and to be
[45:53] able to understand the context of what
[45:55] uh is taking place in Isaiah the 10th
[45:57] chapter you'd have to go back into
[45:59] Isaiah 78 and9 and hear a few chapters
[46:02] and read the context of what's taking
[46:04] place and uh you you can see that that
[46:07] you realize that these were God's
[46:08] children but they were in bondage they
[46:10] were they were they were the the Sons
[46:12] and Daughters of God but yet they were
[46:13] in bondage and you say well if they were
[46:16] God's children why were they in such
[46:17] bondage to begin with and why would God
[46:19] have to come and deliver them and after
[46:21] all they were already uh given this
[46:23] Promised Land but this comes in a time
[46:25] where idolatry had become common in the
[46:27] place of worship and and throughout
[46:29] every uh land that would follow God it
[46:31] would be the land of Syria or whether it
[46:33] be the land of Israel or the land of
[46:35] Judah uh but but they would all idolatry
[46:38] had become a common part of the worship
[46:40] and matter of fact it was in the temples
[46:42] of God that when you went into the
[46:43] temple there was Idols that set around
[46:45] the temple and you know how it must have
[46:47] bothered God that he would look into the
[46:49] temple and here these Idols had taken
[46:50] the place of a of a real Godly worship
[46:53] and men had turn to other things and and
[46:55] the Bible would tell us that this
[46:56] bondage was actually Allowed by God as a
[46:59] judgment because of their sin of
[47:01] idolatry so so we see that they were in
[47:03] this bondage or this great Assyrian uh
[47:06] uh judgment that would come that God
[47:07] asked to use them you ever think of it
[47:09] like this that God would use an evil and
[47:11] a wicked Assyrian army to cause them to
[47:14] destroy the idols that Israel wouldn't
[47:16] destroy you know what that tells me it
[47:18] tells me if God can't find somebody on
[47:19] the inside that'll fix it then he'll
[47:21] bring somebody on the outside that'll
[47:23] fix it in other words that God wants
[47:25] somebody to have to have a clean place
[47:27] of worship this is the desire of God
[47:29] that that the place of worship would be
[47:31] clean that that they would worship God
[47:33] and God Alone that the idols would be
[47:34] removed from the people's hearts and and
[47:36] so here God would use evil to exact good
[47:39] isn't that an odd thought many would
[47:41] look at this you mean God would use an
[47:42] evil thing to bring good to his people
[47:44] but most certainly God does this we
[47:46] matter of fact you can read it in Psalm
[47:48] 76 David say surely the wrath of man
[47:51] shall praise thee and the remainder of
[47:53] Wrath shalt thou restrain in other word
[47:55] God will use evil to bring about good he
[47:58] will use he will use men he will he will
[48:00] use the the arrogance of men or the evil
[48:03] of men to bring about the very purpose
[48:05] of God and and but but what God is
[48:07] showing us is that it only lasts for a
[48:09] season so it only lasts until God would
[48:11] be able to fulfill his purpose and rid
[48:14] them of the idolatry and so you see what
[48:16] God is doing he's going to use something
[48:18] wicked and then God would bring judgment
[48:21] on the wicked one for doing the work
[48:23] that God allowed them to do you say you
[48:25] mean God I I don't want to put a uh
[48:27] damper on your thought of God on your do
[48:29] old grandpa version of God that people
[48:31] build God up as but but we find this
[48:33] pattern All Through the Bible that God
[48:35] would allow evil to come in and he would
[48:37] allow a wicked to come in to bring
[48:39] judgment upon people but then he would
[48:41] destroy the very one that he allowed to
[48:43] go in he would judge them for going in
[48:44] and doing it you you see that in Joseph
[48:47] and his brothers whenever they sinned
[48:48] against Joseph but God used their
[48:50] wickedness to further God's purpose and
[48:52] then he judged his brothers for the
[48:54] wickedness that they did you've seen it
[48:56] the day when Saul sinned against David
[48:58] and God God used it for his purpose but
[49:01] then he judged Saul for for for the acts
[49:03] against David you seen it in Judas when
[49:05] he sinned against Jesus but then a after
[49:08] God's purpose was fulfilled he judged
[49:10] Judas for the wickedness that Judas had
[49:12] so so we see this is something this is a
[49:14] pattern that God used so many times
[49:16] through the scripture we find God doing
[49:18] this very thing but the Bible says that
[49:20] God said but it will come to pass in
[49:22] that day that the remnant of Israel as
[49:25] such have escaped to the house of Jacob
[49:28] will never again depend on him who
[49:30] defeated them but they will depend upon
[49:33] the Lord the Holy One of Israel The
[49:35] Remnant will return the remnant of Jacob
[49:38] to the Mighty God so you see the very
[49:40] purpose of God was the REM the remnant
[49:43] of the Believers to return back to God
[49:45] this is this is God's purpose this is
[49:47] why God would allow evil or this is why
[49:49] God would allow oppression or he would
[49:52] allow this great this great uh
[49:53] wickedness to come upon the land it was
[49:55] to push them back to God it was to bring
[49:58] the purpose of God that they would come
[50:00] back to the to the Mighty God I thought
[50:01] my isn't it something that God used it
[50:03] and then when his purpose was fulfilled
[50:05] you'll find that this great Assyrian
[50:07] army here they were they had taken over
[50:09] the land of Samaria which was the
[50:11] capital of Israel the northern kingdom
[50:13] and and this as they had taken over this
[50:15] place the then the Assyrian King had got
[50:17] swelled up in his heart he said well we
[50:19] took them over let's go on down to
[50:21] Jerusalem and we'll do the same thing in
[50:23] Jerusalem that we done in Samaria and I
[50:25] I remember as the Assyrian King was said
[50:27] it like this he said he said I'll as
[50:30] I've done in Samaria and her Idols I'll
[50:32] do in Jerusalem and her Idols see there
[50:34] was a mistake that the king of Assyria
[50:37] had made as he recognized or he had
[50:39] thought that the idols were the gods of
[50:41] the the true children of Israel so he
[50:43] said well the idols in Samaria they
[50:45] didn't stop us and neither were the
[50:46] idols in Jerusalem in other words we
[50:48] destroyed the gods of Samaria so let's
[50:50] go to Jerusalem and we'll destroy the
[50:52] gods of Jerusalem but listen as he would
[50:55] go and and and get this build built up
[50:56] in his heart God said but I will punish
[50:59] the fruit of the arrogance of the heart
[51:01] of the king of Assyria and the glory of
[51:03] his hotty looks and I'll remove the Yoke
[51:06] of bondage and I'll lift the burden and
[51:09] there see because there was something in
[51:11] Jerusalem brother Joe that was greater
[51:13] than all of the idols there was
[51:15] something in Jerusalem that was greater
[51:17] than the gods of Samaria there was
[51:19] something in Jerusalem that was greater
[51:21] than the that great Assyrian army or the
[51:24] greater than the greatness of that King
[51:26] but in Jerusalem the Bible said there
[51:28] was an
[51:30] anointing see there was something there
[51:32] would caused them to be able to win this
[51:34] battle there was something there that
[51:36] would keep them from being able to fall
[51:38] although it looked like they would be in
[51:40] bondage and it looked like this yoke
[51:42] would be upon them and this oppression
[51:44] would be upon them and they would be
[51:45] destroyed but there was something there
[51:47] that would not allowed them to fall into
[51:49] the hands of the Assyrian King I thought
[51:51] my isn't it something that the Bible
[51:53] would say because of your anointing you
[51:55] shall be free because of your anointing
[51:57] the Yoke would be lifted because of your
[51:59] anointing this this would would pass
[52:01] from you now we realize that over time
[52:04] that this anointing that was in Israel
[52:06] this this greatness of God or this th
[52:09] this this uh the desire that they had to
[52:11] really serve God we saw that that
[52:13] anointing became lost over time now you
[52:16] how many believes this that in the Old
[52:17] Testament the the the things that took
[52:19] place in the natural of the Old
[52:21] Testament were spiritual types of things
[52:23] that would take place in the New
[52:24] Testament so many times in the old test
[52:26] when you see something taking place of
[52:28] the natural it's a type of something
[52:30] that's going to come spiritually so we
[52:31] fast forward a few hundred years and
[52:34] you'll find Israel had become this great
[52:36] place of worship here uh brother Wesley
[52:39] they through time we see that they had
[52:41] this Godly worship or this Godly
[52:43] anointing had become nothing but more
[52:46] than a tradition it it had the idols
[52:48] that were once there that that God had
[52:51] had hated and the the idols that were
[52:53] once there that he allowed wickedness to
[52:55] come in to drive the idols H those Idols
[52:57] they there may not have been Idols in
[52:58] the temple but they had been replaced
[53:00] with the traditions of men and so these
[53:03] the the men had built this up until the
[53:05] until church just became ritual and the
[53:07] temple had just become a a ceremony and
[53:10] and and it didn't matter what you did
[53:12] outside of that as long as you came to
[53:14] church on Sunday morning and you and you
[53:15] done your ceremony and you done your
[53:17] your ritual and you and you went through
[53:19] the motions and you recited what you had
[53:21] to recite then you could go out and it
[53:23] didn't matter what kind of life you had
[53:24] as long as you made the ceremony on the
[53:26] inside and that was good enough but what
[53:28] it did is it caused the Church of God to
[53:31] become formal and it caused it to become
[53:33] dead and and it caused it to become cold
[53:35] and the anointing of God had left out of
[53:38] the synagogue no longer was there this
[53:40] great anointing of God the presence of
[53:43] God was not there any longer but in this
[53:46] time there were still a few that desired
[53:49] the true anointing of God there was
[53:51] still a few in the land of of Israel
[53:53] that that their heart they were they
[53:55] were they were waiting waiting on an
[53:56] anointing of God they were waiting on
[53:58] the reality of a God that could still
[54:01] move a waiting on the god that could
[54:03] still part Waters and and the god that
[54:06] they could still open the Red Sea and
[54:08] they could still stay the mouth of lions
[54:10] a god they could still slay Giants that
[54:12] were a people that were waiting on a God
[54:14] that had an
[54:16] anointing and they were holding to a
[54:18] promise that this God would return they
[54:20] were holding on to this promise that one
[54:22] day that the anointing would return back
[54:25] to the Church of the Living God again
[54:27] and we find it during this time the
[54:29] Bible would tell us here as Jesus's
[54:31] Ministry begin to rise in Luke the 4th
[54:33] chapter you'll find Jesus as he went
[54:35] into the synagogue in Jerusalem there
[54:37] the Bible says he took a portion of the
[54:39] scripture out of Isaiah he said the
[54:41] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[54:43] ha anointed me to preach the gospel to
[54:46] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[54:48] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[54:49] the captives and recovering of sight to
[54:52] the Blind and to set at Liberty them
[54:54] that are bruised to preach the
[54:55] acceptable year of the Lord in other
[54:57] words he is Anointed me to preach the
[54:59] year of God's favor so here there's
[55:01] coming a time that the favor of God is
[55:04] going to be upon the earth oh my here
[55:06] that that for so long that people had
[55:08] been under a spiritual bondage for so
[55:10] long they had been under the the this
[55:12] spiritual oppression where they they
[55:14] couldn't break through any longer they
[55:15] couldn't break through to God they were
[55:17] they were hidden behind the veil they
[55:19] weren't they weren't good enough in
[55:20] order to be able to meet God but here he
[55:22] said but he has anointed me to come and
[55:24] preach that this is the year of of God's
[55:26] favor Jesus said I was anointed to
[55:28] preach the gospel my is't it something
[55:31] you realize that the Old Testament would
[55:33] say it was a promise of God he said that
[55:35] when my word Goes Forth out of my mouth
[55:37] it will not return to me void but it
[55:39] will accomplish that which I sent so
[55:41] that means if he was anointed to preach
[55:43] a gospel then there had to be somebody
[55:45] that was going to hear it whenever he
[55:46] preached it see when God sends a message
[55:49] there's always somebody to receive the
[55:51] message that God sent now I want to look
[55:53] at this word anointing and find two
[55:54] places in the scripture if you look at
[55:56] these with me the first was whenever
[55:58] King Saul was called to be the king here
[56:00] he was about to go into battle and the
[56:02] Bible would say in 1 Samuel that Samuel
[56:05] he said he he said unto Saul the Lord
[56:07] sent me to anoint thee to be king over
[56:10] his people over Israel now therefore
[56:12] hearken thou unto the voice of the words
[56:14] of the Lord now notice why he would come
[56:17] to anoint him now remember in the Old
[56:18] Testament there was many that were
[56:20] Anointed with oil so it came in a time
[56:22] that that when one would come into the
[56:24] office of priest or the office of a king
[56:26] and many even even the office of a
[56:28] prophet when they would when they would
[56:29] come to this place many they were they
[56:31] would they would have to be anointed it
[56:33] was an oil of consecration in other
[56:35] words it consecrated them to that office
[56:37] or their Divine appointment that God had
[56:39] given them and so this is what this is
[56:41] what's happening in the days of Saul
[56:43] that the priest would say that or the
[56:45] prophet would say I'm coming to anoint
[56:47] you to be king so it was a literal
[56:49] pouring of oil over the head of them in
[56:52] other words it was to anoint them with
[56:54] oil it was an outward an act to to
[56:56] consecrate them to God but notice in
[56:58] this word anointing there's actually two
[57:00] different meanings the first it was as a
[57:03] verb it meant to anoint with oil but it
[57:05] also the word anointed means to be
[57:07] nominated or to be chosen for a purpose
[57:10] so here to be anointed it would mean it
[57:12] would mean that they had to be chosen so
[57:14] not only were they consecrated but they
[57:16] were chosen by God to be in that office
[57:18] now you notice as Jesus is identified in
[57:21] the scripture and I'm going to I'm going
[57:22] to jump right into this but as he as he
[57:24] was identified in the scripture notice
[57:25] how Jesus presents himself when he goes
[57:27] to Peter and he asks he says Peter who
[57:30] do you say that I am and Peter said I
[57:32] say that thou art the Christ the son of
[57:34] the Living God remember when he went to
[57:36] the woman at the well and the and he be
[57:38] to discern her heart and and at as as he
[57:41] would discern her life in her heart the
[57:42] woman said unto him she said I know when
[57:45] the Messiah cometh which is called
[57:47] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[57:50] all things now notice when she uses this
[57:52] word she actually uses the Hebrew word
[57:55] mashiach and other words she said the
[57:57] when the mashiach would come he would
[58:00] tell us all things so this word mashiach
[58:02] is actually referring to someone who is
[58:05] Anointed with oil which signifies their
[58:07] consecration to a specific role or a
[58:10] specific office so here this woman had
[58:12] recognized this now in the Hebrew Bible
[58:14] you realize that this term it was used
[58:16] to describe priest it or Kings or
[58:18] somebody that was anointed this was
[58:20] their this was their Divine appointment
[58:22] but over time this word the mashiach was
[58:24] not only used to speak of of a messiah
[58:26] there were many Messiahs because there
[58:28] was many that was anointed and the
[58:30] Messiah meant one that was anointed so
[58:32] this word mashiach was used to described
[58:34] many priests it was described to use
[58:36] many men of God and many many Great Men
[58:38] of God that were anointed for a Divine
[58:40] Purpose but over time as as as the
[58:43] longer they would go and waiting on this
[58:45] one that would be so anointed of God
[58:47] waiting on the returning of this great
[58:49] one that the term mashiach and it was no
[58:51] longer just used to describe any Messiah
[58:54] but it was used to describe the
[58:56] so it it had a greater meaning can I can
[58:58] I say it to you in a caral way this
[59:00] morning if you ask some of these young
[59:01] kids who who is going to be the next
[59:03] president then most any of these kids
[59:05] would tell you it would be Donald Trump
[59:07] see they they would how many y'all kids
[59:08] would would know that see so who's yeah
[59:10] all these young boys so if you say who's
[59:12] the president so well it's going to be
[59:14] Donald Trump but do you realize that
[59:15] that there's actually tens of thousands
[59:17] of presidents in the United States
[59:20] there's a president of every Association
[59:21] there's a president of every Club
[59:23] there's a president of of of major
[59:26] companies there there's presidents of
[59:27] universities but whenever this term is
[59:30] used alone if you don't specify that I'm
[59:32] talking about a president of a club or
[59:34] president of an association when you
[59:36] just say who's the president anybody
[59:39] would say well it's the highest office
[59:40] in the land so without any any more
[59:43] explanation you always it's always
[59:45] referring back to the highest office
[59:47] this is what this woman at the well was
[59:49] talking about she wasn't talking about
[59:50] the coming of a priest when she said I
[59:52] heard that the mashiach would come she
[59:54] wasn't talking about just one of these
[59:56] priests that may be anointed or the next
[59:58] one that came in the temple that would
[1:00:00] have oil that would anoint their head
[1:00:01] and they would be consecrated for the
[1:00:03] office she what she wasn't talking about
[1:00:05] the next king of Israel she wasn't
[1:00:06] talking about just a prophet that would
[1:00:08] that would be anointed but she said when
[1:00:10] the miach would come she was talking
[1:00:12] about Christ the anointed one she said
[1:00:15] his name Shall be Called Christ now
[1:00:17] notice here when she would speak this
[1:00:19] she this m called Christ she wasn't just
[1:00:21] talking about any anointed one she was
[1:00:23] talking about the anointed one Christ
[1:00:25] the anointed one she said the mashiach
[1:00:27] which is called Christ now that word
[1:00:29] Christ was the Greek word which was the
[1:00:31] Greek equivalent to the Hebrew word
[1:00:32] mashiach so she says the mashiach would
[1:00:35] come or the Messiah which you call
[1:00:37] Christ the anointed one and so here
[1:00:40] she's referring to the anointed one
[1:00:42] Jesus Christ this one that was chosen to
[1:00:45] come as a deliverer to this great nation
[1:00:48] or a deliverer to the world you notice
[1:00:50] how he would be the one that God had
[1:00:52] chose to be the Savior the one that he
[1:00:54] would chose to to be the he he was an
[1:00:56] anointed one brother Wesley he was a
[1:00:58] chosen one he was chose to bring healing
[1:01:00] to the Nations he was chose to bring
[1:01:02] Deliverance to Israel he he was chose to
[1:01:05] bring the gifts of God back to the life
[1:01:07] of a human being he was the chosen one
[1:01:10] so Jesus would stand up and he would say
[1:01:13] I was anointed to preach the gospel the
[1:01:16] spirit of the Lord is upon me he was
[1:01:18] anointed with the spirit of the father
[1:01:20] he said he has anointed me to preach the
[1:01:23] gospel to the poor I was anointed to
[1:01:25] heal the the Brokenhearted I was
[1:01:26] anointed to preach Deliverance I was
[1:01:28] anointed to recover the sight to the
[1:01:30] Blind and I was anointed to set at
[1:01:32] Liberty them that are bruised anointed
[1:01:35] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:01:36] Lord see Jesus wasn't he wasn't reading
[1:01:40] from The Book of Luke like we read but
[1:01:42] he was reading from the prophecy of
[1:01:43] Isaiah this prophecy that was concerning
[1:01:46] the coming of the mashiach he was he was
[1:01:49] reading from this prophecy you realize
[1:01:51] this prophecy spoke of an anointed one
[1:01:53] that would be sent by God that had a
[1:01:55] specific specific role a role that no
[1:01:57] man would ever be able to fulfill a a
[1:02:00] role that could only be the Son of God
[1:02:02] he would he would come as one that that
[1:02:04] that was enlightened by the spirit of
[1:02:06] God he would he would bring the spirit
[1:02:07] of God Back To Human uh human beings
[1:02:10] again and you notice this is the this is
[1:02:13] what the Bible's prophesying of and here
[1:02:15] Jesus would go up before the synagogue
[1:02:17] and he would take the these crows of
[1:02:19] Isaiah and brother Joe as he would read
[1:02:21] this CR of Isaiah at the end of the
[1:02:23] reading he would say this day this
[1:02:25] scripture is fulfilled in your ears in
[1:02:27] other words the hour has come the wait
[1:02:30] is over all these things that have been
[1:02:32] prophesied through the years that that
[1:02:34] what you what you have been waiting on
[1:02:35] it has come to pass in this hour but
[1:02:37] you're living in the age of the
[1:02:39] Fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah
[1:02:41] and friends let me tell you what was
[1:02:43] written in the Scrolls of Isaiah what
[1:02:45] was a word in the Scrolls of Isaiah the
[1:02:47] very moment it came out of the mouth of
[1:02:50] Jesus Christ no longer was it just a
[1:02:52] word but it became an anointed word it
[1:02:55] was a word that was fulfilled it was a
[1:02:57] word that had power it wasn't in the
[1:02:59] mouth of anybody that would read it it
[1:03:01] was just a word in the mouth of those
[1:03:03] that would read it it may have been just
[1:03:05] a dead letter as many would pick up a
[1:03:07] Bible and they'd read as Paul would say
[1:03:09] the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[1:03:11] life without the spirit of God it would
[1:03:13] do nothing but when the anointing of God
[1:03:15] came that same word became an anointed
[1:03:17] word and because it was an anointed word
[1:03:20] in the mouth of Jesus Christ I feel like
[1:03:22] preaching this morning we may as well
[1:03:24] it's Sunday morning because it was
[1:03:26] anointed word in the mouth of Jesus
[1:03:28] Christ the Bible would call it gracious
[1:03:30] words when he would speak they would say
[1:03:32] it was gracious words when he went down
[1:03:34] to Galilee the Bible said when he spoke
[1:03:36] they said he speaks as one that has
[1:03:38] Authority and has power let me tell you
[1:03:40] because the word that he spoke was an
[1:03:42] anointed word it was so anointed when he
[1:03:45] went down there was a man outside of the
[1:03:47] the tomb that had been filled with so
[1:03:48] many Devils that they locked they got
[1:03:51] him away from the people but when the
[1:03:52] words of Jesus spoke to him and told the
[1:03:55] demon to come out out of him the demon
[1:03:56] had to come out because it was anointed
[1:03:58] for that hour it was an anointed word
[1:04:02] and he cast out you say well how did a
[1:04:04] demon come out of a man because he the
[1:04:06] word had the authority to do so because
[1:04:09] his word was an anointed word somebody
[1:04:11] say Amen his word how many believes that
[1:04:13] that the words that Jesus spoke was an
[1:04:15] anointed word his message it was an
[1:04:18] anointed message when he went into the
[1:04:20] tomb it was anointed when he resurrected
[1:04:23] on the third day it was anointed when he
[1:04:25] preached in the mountains it was
[1:04:26] anointed when he preached on the shores
[1:04:28] of Galilee it was anointed when he went
[1:04:30] out in the fishing boat and he spoke to
[1:04:32] them it was anointed when they hung him
[1:04:34] on the cross of Calvary his word was
[1:04:36] still
[1:04:37] anointed he went to the tomb anointed he
[1:04:39] resurrected on the third day it was
[1:04:41] still anointed when he ascended into
[1:04:43] Glory it was still anointed when he
[1:04:45] descended in the in the in the the
[1:04:47] office of the Holy Ghost on the in the
[1:04:50] the the book of Acts on the day of
[1:04:51] Pentecost it was still anointed and that
[1:04:53] same word that was anointed fell Upon a
[1:04:55] man named Peter and turned a man that
[1:04:57] was a coward into a real gospel preacher
[1:05:00] when he came back out he preached the
[1:05:02] word of God and the Bible says whenever
[1:05:04] Peter preached there was 3,000 Souls
[1:05:06] that were W to the kingdom of God why
[1:05:09] cuz the same word that he heard had came
[1:05:11] alive in his heart and the anointing
[1:05:13] that was on the word that Jesus Christ
[1:05:14] spoke was upon the man named Peter and
[1:05:17] when he spoke that word 3,000 Souls were
[1:05:20] won you say why were they won to the
[1:05:22] kingdom of God because his word was
[1:05:24] anointed
[1:05:26] when he went down with John to the gate
[1:05:27] beautiful they found a lame man you know
[1:05:29] what he did he preached a little faith
[1:05:31] message to the man and the man got up
[1:05:33] and walk you said why' the man get up
[1:05:35] and walk because his word was
[1:05:38] anointed it was an anointed message see
[1:05:42] God anoints men to do great things he
[1:05:45] anoints women to do great things God
[1:05:47] anoints us to do great things to bring
[1:05:50] about God's purpose do you realize that
[1:05:52] there's anointed men and women among us
[1:05:55] God anoints us to do great things we've
[1:05:57] been Anointed with a message to be able
[1:06:00] to speak to bring Faith you realize I
[1:06:03] you know there was something I always
[1:06:04] thought fascinating that that brother
[1:06:06] Billy Graham said one time he said the
[1:06:08] message I preach has not changed from
[1:06:11] the is late in his ministry he said my
[1:06:13] calling is to preach the love of God and
[1:06:15] the Forgiveness of God and the fact that
[1:06:17] God does forgive us see he here was a
[1:06:20] man that had a calling of God a gift of
[1:06:22] God in his life and he was anointed for
[1:06:24] that purpose how many how many believe
[1:06:26] that I I believe brother Billy Graham to
[1:06:28] be a man of God I believe he done great
[1:06:29] work for God he he he he was he he he
[1:06:32] done his his calling of God he he was no
[1:06:35] different than the angels that went down
[1:06:36] into Sodom that called lot and his
[1:06:38] family out of Sodom that they would be
[1:06:40] saved before the time of judgment he was
[1:06:42] a great man of God and then but I love
[1:06:45] how when he when he spoke this he said
[1:06:47] my message never changed another word he
[1:06:50] abided in his calling so God gave him a
[1:06:52] calling anointed him for a calling and
[1:06:54] then he abided in his calling many great
[1:06:56] men and women they they've been given a
[1:06:58] calling of God they get something
[1:07:00] specific to do but but but he abided in
[1:07:02] his calling but I love it he said my
[1:07:04] message never changed is that the way it
[1:07:06] ought to be my message never changed you
[1:07:09] know I think many today can I just
[1:07:10] preach a minute I think many today have
[1:07:13] forgot what the message
[1:07:15] is I think they've forgotten what it is
[1:07:17] you know you remember the story about
[1:07:18] the little boy that went on the race
[1:07:20] they told him well that here's a race
[1:07:22] all the boys are going to go and you got
[1:07:24] to go through this whole obstacle course
[1:07:25] and when you get down to the end of the
[1:07:27] course then you just give the password
[1:07:28] and they'll let you in whoever first one
[1:07:30] down to the end of the course gives the
[1:07:32] password you get to go in so the boy
[1:07:33] began to train he trained so hard that
[1:07:36] he could be the one to make it to the
[1:07:37] end brother Wesley he worked out so good
[1:07:39] until he was the fastest and the best
[1:07:41] came out to the race that day M when
[1:07:43] they let it go there wasn't nobody could
[1:07:45] catch him he went around every obstacle
[1:07:46] went over every Hill jumped every barrel
[1:07:49] went through every every maze that he
[1:07:50] had to go through when he got to the end
[1:07:52] of the door there was a the lady
[1:07:54] standing there and she just looked
[1:07:55] looked at him he said I I'm here what's
[1:07:57] the
[1:07:58] password oh I forgot it in all my
[1:08:01] training he forgot what it was but my
[1:08:04] isn't it is't that a good story to think
[1:08:06] what would it be like to get all the way
[1:08:08] to the end of the the trial and the end
[1:08:10] of the obstacle and the end of the great
[1:08:12] race and forget what the message even
[1:08:14] was is it something I think that has
[1:08:17] been lost that that many has forgotten
[1:08:19] him but I thought what a sad thought it
[1:08:21] is to get to the end of our race and
[1:08:23] forget the message that Jesus gave us
[1:08:25] many have forgotten it but let me just
[1:08:27] remind you this morning John 1 John 3:11
[1:08:30] John said this is the message that you
[1:08:32] have heard from the beginning that we
[1:08:34] should love one another and friends I've
[1:08:36] got news for you it's the same message
[1:08:38] today this is the message that you have
[1:08:41] heard from the beginning that we should
[1:08:42] love one another not as Cain who was of
[1:08:45] the wicked one that slew his brother
[1:08:47] is't that the way it is in the world
[1:08:48] today everybody wants to slay one
[1:08:50] another Well slay this one cuz they
[1:08:51] don't see it the way I see it or slay
[1:08:53] that one cuz they don't believe the way
[1:08:55] I believe he said but slay Cain would
[1:08:57] slay his brother because Cain was of the
[1:08:59] wicked
[1:09:00] one he said why did he slay him because
[1:09:02] his own Works were evil and his brothers
[1:09:04] were righteous he said but Marvel not if
[1:09:06] the world hates you for we know that we
[1:09:09] have already passed from Death unto life
[1:09:11] because we love the Brethren that's how
[1:09:14] you know you passed from Death un life
[1:09:16] is that you love the Brethren and he
[1:09:18] that loveth not his brother abideth in
[1:09:20] death that we love one another think
[1:09:24] about it I think people have got the
[1:09:25] wrong
[1:09:26] message I do I think people have got a
[1:09:29] hold of the wrong message I think
[1:09:30] somehow in their minds that they they
[1:09:32] have built up the wrong message that
[1:09:34] that that that today it's about
[1:09:35] something else but friends I've got news
[1:09:36] for you it's still about the same thing
[1:09:39] I'm going to tell you something that
[1:09:40] most pastors won't tell you and I and I
[1:09:42] know our church is a growing Church
[1:09:43] there's a lot not here this morning but
[1:09:45] ever since we started there there's new
[1:09:47] people that come here every month and I
[1:09:48] thank you for having enough confidence
[1:09:50] in in the ministry that that you would
[1:09:52] come to to be fed spiritually but
[1:09:54] friends I've got news for you let me
[1:09:56] just tell you from my heart this morning
[1:09:57] that coming to this church ain't never
[1:09:59] going to save none of us being a member
[1:10:01] of this church ain't never going to save
[1:10:03] nobody you can come here all the days of
[1:10:05] your life it'll never get you anywhere
[1:10:06] with God that is not what's going to
[1:10:08] save you you can say well I'm going to
[1:10:09] be a part of Grace Tabernacle but it'll
[1:10:11] never save you it'll never give you
[1:10:13] eternal life pastors don't like to say
[1:10:16] that but it's the gospel truth being a
[1:10:18] member of this church never saved
[1:10:19] anybody being a part of this church
[1:10:21] never saved anybody calling me your
[1:10:23] pastor it'll never save anybody but
[1:10:25] there ain't one place to find Salvation
[1:10:27] and it's at the cross of Calvary where
[1:10:29] the blood of Jesus Christ is Flowing
[1:10:31] down from calvary's Cross where he
[1:10:33] poured his Blessing out upon human race
[1:10:36] and beneath the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:38] is where salvation is found it ain't
[1:10:40] found in a church building it ain't
[1:10:42] found in a Baptist it ain't found in a
[1:10:44] Methodist it ain't found in Church of
[1:10:46] Christ it ain't found in Grace
[1:10:47] Tabernacle it ain't found in no man or
[1:10:49] no name that's been made by any man but
[1:10:52] it's only found in one and his name is
[1:10:54] Jesus Christ
[1:10:56] that's the message of the
[1:10:59] hour Amen brother it don't matter what
[1:11:02] you think it don't matter what man does
[1:11:03] you think about what men have done men
[1:11:05] have built churches and put their
[1:11:07] beliefs between people and God and put
[1:11:10] Creeds between people and God but you
[1:11:12] know it's what what happened when Jesus
[1:11:14] came brother Joel when he came to the
[1:11:15] Earth he found precious people trying to
[1:11:18] find Salvation in the
[1:11:20] church I wonder how when he came there
[1:11:23] you realize what they found when he
[1:11:25] found precious people they were looking
[1:11:26] for salvation but what they found
[1:11:28] instead is they found ceremonies and
[1:11:30] rituals they found those that were
[1:11:32] pouring out water over their hands and
[1:11:33] sisters in front of the in front of the
[1:11:35] pull pits and here their their garments
[1:11:38] wearing clothes a certain way washing
[1:11:39] washing the plates and things they had
[1:11:41] all these ceremonies but they never got
[1:11:44] salvation they never got salvation what
[1:11:47] is salvation it's Deliverance they never
[1:11:50] got deliverance from it it was it was a
[1:11:52] ritual it was a ceremony and I often
[1:11:55] wonder if Jesus came today what would he
[1:11:59] find if he came to every church and he
[1:12:01] visited every church this morning what
[1:12:03] would he find in there would he find it
[1:12:06] a place of ceremony or a place of ritual
[1:12:08] or a place of formalism or would he find
[1:12:10] it a place that had the anointing of God
[1:12:13] would he find it to be a place where you
[1:12:15] could find Salvation I thought my most
[1:12:18] of the time he it would be just about
[1:12:19] the same people are going to churches
[1:12:21] they're looking for salvation but
[1:12:23] instead they're getting a bunch of
[1:12:24] things to recite that men have made but
[1:12:26] friends that ain't what we need this
[1:12:27] morning we don't need something to
[1:12:28] recite what we need is the Holy Ghost
[1:12:31] back in the church again we need the
[1:12:33] power of God we need a church that's
[1:12:35] based on the new birth and the real
[1:12:37] Bible Holy Ghost I know I know you
[1:12:39] realize that most of Christianity Today
[1:12:41] brother Wesley they follow after
[1:12:43] man-made religions and man-made thoughts
[1:12:45] and and these men that built up their
[1:12:48] their great images to them but do you
[1:12:49] realize that we can't follow that and
[1:12:51] ever find God we're not looking to
[1:12:54] follow after that what we need to do is
[1:12:55] to get back to the Bible get back to a
[1:12:58] Bible Holy Ghost as anybody believes
[1:13:00] that this morning get back to a Bible
[1:13:02] move of God get back to Bible healing
[1:13:04] back to Bible salvation back to Bible
[1:13:07] deliverance we got a man to follow and
[1:13:10] his name is Jesus Christ I think we
[1:13:13] ought to get behind him because he was
[1:13:14] anointed to preach the gospel he brought
[1:13:17] an anointed word 2,000 years ago and
[1:13:19] that same word is still alive this
[1:13:22] morning you said well how do you follow
[1:13:24] him brother Matt
[1:13:25] let me just tell you you follow Jesus by
[1:13:28] following his word that's what John said
[1:13:30] he said in the beginning was the word
[1:13:33] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:13:35] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:13:38] it dwelt among us the logos of God it
[1:13:40] was made flesh and it dwelt among
[1:13:42] Humanity to see so to follow him would
[1:13:45] be to follow his word this word this
[1:13:48] anointed word was so great that even
[1:13:50] Jesus himself that was given the power
[1:13:51] to judge he said I don't come to judge
[1:13:54] you but it's my word that will judge you
[1:13:56] when I'm gone see because it was an
[1:13:58] anointed word the word of God is what
[1:14:01] we're looking for that's what we're
[1:14:03] after but do you realize that to follow
[1:14:06] the word of God it would come with a
[1:14:09] ridicule or
[1:14:11] persecution it's not always the easiest
[1:14:13] thing Jesus said this to the disciples
[1:14:15] before you make this great decision to
[1:14:17] follow the word he said You shall be
[1:14:19] hated of all men for my name's sake but
[1:14:22] he that endureth to the end shall be
[1:14:24] saved
[1:14:25] they'll hate you they'll make fun of you
[1:14:28] they'll persecute you you remember the
[1:14:30] sermon that Jesus preached on the sermon
[1:14:32] on the mouth one it said to be the
[1:14:35] greatest sermon ever preached it was the
[1:14:37] greatest uh words that were ever written
[1:14:39] it was such a great thing that Jesus
[1:14:41] said but the Bible says that whenever he
[1:14:43] preached this they marveled that he
[1:14:45] preached as one with authority that same
[1:14:47] word but you realize that he preached on
[1:14:49] on that day brother Mark it still has
[1:14:51] Authority it has authority over every
[1:14:52] sin it has authority over the devil it
[1:14:54] has author authority over hell it has
[1:14:56] authority over sickness it has authority
[1:14:58] over our thoughts this morning and you
[1:15:00] think about about when Jesus would stand
[1:15:02] up there and give that great message do
[1:15:03] you realize that if Jesus went and he
[1:15:05] stood in pull pits today and he preached
[1:15:07] that same message most the people would
[1:15:09] get up and walk out they wouldn't even
[1:15:11] want to hear the the most fundamental
[1:15:14] sermon that Jesus preached matter of
[1:15:16] fact people skip part of it parts of it
[1:15:18] when they read it because they don't
[1:15:19] like what parts of it says but it was
[1:15:21] the sermon on the mouth and it was
[1:15:23] anointed
[1:15:25] it was anointed of God it may have been
[1:15:27] some part it may have been hard it may
[1:15:28] make half the people mad but but he
[1:15:30] preached it because he was anointed to
[1:15:32] do so and it didn't matter if it made
[1:15:34] people feel good or feel bad it was
[1:15:35] still true it didn't matter if they
[1:15:37] believed it or they didn't believe it it
[1:15:38] was still powerful it was bold it
[1:15:40] corrected wrongs but it revealed truth
[1:15:43] many men they sit around and heard it
[1:15:45] and they reviled against him because of
[1:15:47] the words that he spoke but it was still
[1:15:49] truth can you imagine sitting there that
[1:15:52] day no wonder they hated him that's
[1:15:54] right can you imagine sitting there and
[1:15:56] hearing as Jesus would walk up on this
[1:15:58] mountain the multitude would gather
[1:16:00] around him and the disciples would come
[1:16:02] up by him and he would sit down on the
[1:16:03] top of this mountain and begin to speak
[1:16:05] to them do you realize in that day that
[1:16:07] these people they were all considered
[1:16:08] little people they were considered
[1:16:11] people they were a spiritually oppressed
[1:16:13] people they were they weren't great like
[1:16:14] the priesthood the priesthood they were
[1:16:16] special people they because they had the
[1:16:17] robe just right they were special
[1:16:19] because of their natural lineage they
[1:16:21] were special because they come from the
[1:16:23] lineage of Levi and my they they could
[1:16:25] trace all the way back to Father Abraham
[1:16:26] they were a special class of people and
[1:16:28] the rest of them were just peasants that
[1:16:30] put money in the synagogue in the pot to
[1:16:33] help take care of the bills and and help
[1:16:35] their help them to have a better kind of
[1:16:36] a living this was this was what was
[1:16:39] going on when Jesus went up on the
[1:16:40] mountain to preach and can you imagine
[1:16:43] the the hatred that took place in the
[1:16:45] synagogue in the in the lives of the
[1:16:48] Pharisees when Jesus began to speak and
[1:16:50] he would talk about how an ordinary man
[1:16:52] could obtain what what what this
[1:16:55] supposedly righteous man told them they
[1:16:57] could never obtain in other words that
[1:16:59] the ordinary man could be more righteous
[1:17:01] than the man that was deemed righteous
[1:17:03] the ordinary man could be more righteous
[1:17:05] than the man that was supposed to be a
[1:17:07] priest here Jesus come he mixed it all
[1:17:10] up because he's talking about how that
[1:17:12] they become formal and it was just a
[1:17:14] tradition but the life of God was no
[1:17:16] longer in it and he began to talk about
[1:17:18] the condition of the people and these
[1:17:20] religious spirits that that had
[1:17:22] corrupted them and held them and the
[1:17:23] Bible says as they gather gathered
[1:17:26] around him can you imagine sitting here
[1:17:27] this morning can we do we have we have a
[1:17:29] minute it's still a little bit early can
[1:17:31] you imagine sitting there this morning
[1:17:33] and hearing Jesus in the in this
[1:17:35] condition and here there was this great
[1:17:37] this great priesthood that was over you
[1:17:38] and you my you had to you had to Bow
[1:17:40] your head to walk by by because they
[1:17:42] were so much greater than you on but but
[1:17:45] when Jesus come and here they gathered
[1:17:46] around him and he began to speak to them
[1:17:49] here they're sitting on the mountain and
[1:17:50] he said but blessed are the poor in
[1:17:52] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:17:54] heaven Heaven I'd have shouted all over
[1:17:56] the mountain a poor boy from Arkansas
[1:17:59] that's enough to send me up and down the
[1:18:00] mountain blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:18:03] for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven I
[1:18:05] didn't know any of it belonged to me he
[1:18:08] said but blessed are you for theirs is
[1:18:10] the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they
[1:18:12] that mourn for they shall be comforted
[1:18:15] how many were sitting around him that
[1:18:17] day that were in mourning lost and never
[1:18:20] didn't have a way out brother Bobby had
[1:18:22] no hope but he said blessed are they
[1:18:23] that mourn thank you
[1:18:25] for they shall be comforted you Lord
[1:18:27] blessed are the
[1:18:29] meek for they shall inherit the whole
[1:18:32] earth can you imagine them little
[1:18:34] sisters that were sitting there those
[1:18:36] little women those little Meek women
[1:18:38] that they went in the been shunned out
[1:18:40] of the synagogues they wasn't good
[1:18:41] enough to be in and M couldn't even come
[1:18:43] in certain time of day couldn't go to
[1:18:46] certain places but all of a sudden they
[1:18:49] Meek as they were they remain Meek but
[1:18:51] when the anointed one begin to speak he
[1:18:54] said blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:18:57] inherit the earth Hallelujah I think
[1:19:00] there was some shatters on the hill
[1:19:01] Glory
[1:19:03] Hallelujah blessed are they which hunger
[1:19:06] and thirst after righteousness for they
[1:19:08] shall be filled Lord blessed are the
[1:19:12] merciful for they shall obtain
[1:19:14] Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for
[1:19:18] they shall see God Amen blessed are the
[1:19:21] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:19:24] children of God God thank you Lord my
[1:19:27] hear the wars religion had become such a
[1:19:30] great battle and who's right and who's
[1:19:32] wrong and who's free and who's
[1:19:34] bound but Jesus said blessed are the
[1:19:37] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:19:39] children of
[1:19:41] God and blessed are they which are
[1:19:44] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[1:19:46] theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed
[1:19:49] are you when men shall revile you and
[1:19:51] persecute you and say all manner of evil
[1:19:53] against you falsely for my sake you just
[1:19:56] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[1:19:59] is your reward in heaven for so
[1:20:01] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:20:03] before you my if they' persecute the
[1:20:05] prophets of old then what do you think
[1:20:07] they'll do today they'll persecute the
[1:20:09] believer today so they persecuted them
[1:20:11] that were before you but you are the
[1:20:14] salt of the earth they had never heard a
[1:20:16] message like this on they had always
[1:20:18] been called the dogs but Jesus the
[1:20:21] anointed one said but you are the salt
[1:20:23] of the earth man who you going Listen to
[1:20:25] listen to the to the to the Pharisee or
[1:20:27] listen to the anointed one he said you
[1:20:29] are the salt of the
[1:20:31] earth but if the salt has lost its Savor
[1:20:34] where shall it be salted henceforth it's
[1:20:37] good for nothing but to be cast out and
[1:20:38] trotten under the foot of men and then I
[1:20:41] love this next part these old nobodies
[1:20:45] you are the light of the world you're a
[1:20:49] city that is on a hill that cannot be
[1:20:51] hid my goodness neither can a man that
[1:20:55] would light a candle put it under a
[1:20:56] bushel but on a Candlestick and give it
[1:20:59] light unto all the house so let your
[1:21:02] light shine before men that they may see
[1:21:04] your good works and glorify your father
[1:21:07] which is in heaven now what a message
[1:21:10] from an anointed word of God you are the

[1:21:15] light but take the bushel off and let it
[1:21:17] shine before me my you may not have much
[1:21:21] but what you have give it to the kingdom
[1:21:23] of God you may not be ble to do much but
[1:21:25] what what you can do it for the kingdom
[1:21:27] of God this same don't you realize this
[1:21:30] same gospel that Jesus preached is the
[1:21:32] same gospel today the same message that
[1:21:34] he preached is the same message today
[1:21:36] and brother Joe it still has the same
[1:21:38] power it has the same Spirit it has the
[1:21:41] same anointing brother John it has it's
[1:21:43] the same word and it still has the same
[1:21:45] promise it'll do the same thing that it
[1:21:47] always done and I thank God that there's
[1:21:49] still some Believers here just like they
[1:21:51] was on The Sermon on the Mount that
[1:21:53] stood down there and said that ain't
[1:21:55] nothing but the truth and though many
[1:21:57] would walk away from him but there was
[1:21:59] the disciples that followed Jesus that
[1:22:01] said Lord where would we go for thou
[1:22:03] Hast the words of eternal
[1:22:06] life many would turn away would you go
[1:22:08] also I have nowhere else I can go for
[1:22:11] thou Hast the words of eternal life the
[1:22:15] same promise that Jesus brought is the
[1:22:17] same promise for the church today how
[1:22:19] many believe that the same the same
[1:22:21] words that that sermon on the mouth it
[1:22:23] wasn't just for the disciples it wasn't
[1:22:25] just for the people of Israel but that
[1:22:26] sermon was for you blessed are the meek
[1:22:29] for they still shall inherit the earth
[1:22:31] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:22:33] theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven every
[1:22:35] promise of God it still belongs to you
[1:22:39] as a body of Believers I I remember Jack
[1:22:41] Co you know how I love to I Love The th
[1:22:43] those great men of God I remember Jack
[1:22:45] Co he was a great faith healer back in
[1:22:47] the 50s but Jack Co said one time he
[1:22:49] said you know it'd be like going into a
[1:22:50] restaurant he said when you open up the
[1:22:52] menu and on the menu it have a T-bone
[1:22:54] steak and you'd read you'd say I want to
[1:22:56] order a T-bone steak and the waiter
[1:22:58] would say well that was for a day gone
[1:23:00] by he said I just get up and walk out of
[1:23:03] the restaurant why would you put it on
[1:23:04] the menu if it wasn't for nobody here it
[1:23:07] was an anointed word when Jesus spoke it
[1:23:09] it's still the same anointed word today
[1:23:12] said I want a restaurant that I can get
[1:23:13] all of it I I want to be able to walk in
[1:23:16] and order anything off the menu there
[1:23:18] anything that's anointed for my hour I
[1:23:20] want to be able to receive it I don't
[1:23:21] want to go in and some waiter come by
[1:23:23] and say but you a have that that promise
[1:23:25] ain't good for you or you ain't good
[1:23:28] enough for it I want to be able to order
[1:23:31] off the menu that's what we need we need
[1:23:33] to be able to have a full menu that's
[1:23:35] what this is this is a Full Gospel
[1:23:36] Church we believe the whole gospel I
[1:23:39] want the whole full menu I I want every
[1:23:41] part of it I want from page to page from
[1:23:43] cover to cover I wanted the promises of
[1:23:45] God that were promised to me in this age
[1:23:47] I want them for me in my
[1:23:50] family that's what we need every
[1:23:52] spiritual man he needs something to be
[1:23:54] able to feed feed on it's the word of
[1:23:56] God how many believes it this morning I
[1:23:58] believe how many believes every word of
[1:23:59] it I believe the word of God every word
[1:24:02] of it although we may not always
[1:24:04] understand it although we may sometimes
[1:24:06] we may explain it wrong in our flesh but
[1:24:08] you know God is always he is always
[1:24:10] leading us and we're growing in
[1:24:11] Revelation and growing closer to God and
[1:24:14] growing closer to the the promises of
[1:24:16] God and I still believe that they're for
[1:24:17] you and I I don't believe the promises
[1:24:20] of God are for a day gone by I believe
[1:24:22] they're for us and I believe we have a
[1:24:25] right to it it's not just a written word
[1:24:28] we ain't just reciting a word but it's a
[1:24:30] word that's anointed for a season think
[1:24:32] about it we we have a word we have a
[1:24:34] message in this hour it's anointing for
[1:24:36] this season Jesus spoke it it wasn't
[1:24:38] going away he spoke it he said it it'll
[1:24:41] take you all the way into a Rapture he
[1:24:43] he went down into a grave that same
[1:24:45] message it was buried in a tomb but that
[1:24:47] same message resurrected and it's been
[1:24:49] Vindicated in this hour to still be
[1:24:51] alive the same word of God you think
[1:24:54] about it what good would a message of
[1:24:55] Noah do today although it's great for
[1:24:58] inspiration but what good would it do
[1:25:00] you if you built an ark in the middle of
[1:25:01] a field it never save anybody because it
[1:25:04] wasn't anointed for this hour you think
[1:25:06] about the message that Moses preached
[1:25:08] although it it was it was not our
[1:25:10] message although it was a type of our
[1:25:11] message but but still yet what good
[1:25:13] would it do if you went out telling
[1:25:15] everybody to come out of
[1:25:16] Egypt it wouldn't do you no good to call
[1:25:19] everybody out of Egypt that's not the
[1:25:21] message that we've been called to in
[1:25:22] this hour but it it was anointed for
[1:25:25] that hour isn't it something you see
[1:25:27] when you find something that's anointed
[1:25:28] for the hour that you live in it comes
[1:25:30] with a power it comes with an authority
[1:25:32] that's why they said his word has
[1:25:34] Authority and power because it was
[1:25:35] anointed in the hour that we live so see
[1:25:38] so in the days of Moses because the
[1:25:41] because Moses's message was anointed
[1:25:43] when he went into Egypt it had a power
[1:25:45] and authority to turn water into blood
[1:25:48] because his message was anointed he had
[1:25:50] the power to bring Locust upon to
[1:25:52] destroy the crops because it was an
[1:25:54] anointed message it it had the power to
[1:25:56] bring Darkness upon Egypt and it had the
[1:25:59] power to bring judgment and death upon
[1:26:01] the firstborn because it was an anointed
[1:26:04] message it had the power to part the
[1:26:06] Waters of the Red Sea you think about it
[1:26:09] the word that Moses spoke it was
[1:26:11] anointed For That season he said brother
[1:26:13] Matt well what was it anointed to do
[1:26:14] I'll just tell you I'll just skip to it
[1:26:17] the the message of Moses was anointed to
[1:26:19] bring Deliverance how many believe that
[1:26:21] it was anointed to bring Deliverance to
[1:26:22] the for the children of Israel from
[1:26:23] Egypt yeah it was anointed for that
[1:26:25] purpose you think about I think about
[1:26:28] how powerful this is it was anointed to
[1:26:30] deliver you ever you ever looked at the
[1:26:31] birth of Moses I know I got too long you
[1:26:34] ever look at the birth of Moses Exodus 2
[1:26:36] chapter first verse the Bible said and
[1:26:38] there went a man out of the house of
[1:26:39] Levi and took a wife of the daughter of
[1:26:42] Levi and and from this Union of a man
[1:26:45] from the house of Levi and a daughter
[1:26:47] from the house of Levi from this Union
[1:26:49] was born Moses the deliverer I think
[1:26:52] this is too good cuz see the tribe of
[1:26:54] Levi how many knows what it was Levi was
[1:26:56] the tribe that was anointed for service
[1:26:58] it was the the the tribe that the priest
[1:27:00] who come out out of this tribe they
[1:27:02] would be Anointed with o they were The
[1:27:04] Keeper of the anointing and so here here
[1:27:06] in this in this tribe that was The
[1:27:08] Keeper of the anointing I thought my
[1:27:09] isn't something it was those set aside
[1:27:11] for service when an anointed husband met
[1:27:14] an anointed wife it brought forth
[1:27:17] Deliverance man that'll preach on when
[1:27:19] the anointed husband met an anointed
[1:27:22] wife they were both from the house of
[1:27:23] Levi it brought forth a it brought forth
[1:27:26] a deliverer or or or Deliverance I
[1:27:28] thought my isn't that the way it is
[1:27:29] today when Christ the husband of the
[1:27:31] church here it was an anointed word and
[1:27:34] he's calling to an anointed bride he's
[1:27:36] calling to in other words he's calling a
[1:27:38] people back to the word of God he's
[1:27:40] calling the church back to the word of
[1:27:42] God and when that anointed husband met
[1:27:44] that anointed church or that anointed
[1:27:46] bride it will bring Deliverance to them
[1:27:49] we're living in an age of rapture we're
[1:27:51] living in a Rapture Age We that that's
[1:27:53] why in this Rapture age we don't need to
[1:27:55] come out of Egypt we need to come out of
[1:27:57] leosia we need the revelations 18 that
[1:28:00] say come out of her my people and be not
[1:28:02] partakers of our sin it's a call of the
[1:28:05] people of God out of the world and back
[1:28:07] to the god back to the god of the Bible
[1:28:09] on come out of her my people be not a
[1:28:12] partaker of her sin that's the message
[1:28:14] that you hear today it must be anointed
[1:28:17] for the hour that we live in we're
[1:28:18] living in an age of rapture and our call
[1:28:20] is a Rapture message and that anointing
[1:28:23] you think about that anointing God has
[1:28:25] given to us we've been anointed as as
[1:28:28] Believers you think about it there's
[1:28:29] been a union between Christ and the
[1:28:31] church and because that anointed word
[1:28:34] has been married to that anointed bride
[1:28:37] you think about it then it brings
[1:28:38] Deliverance out of Le oysa and that's
[1:28:40] what will take her to her future home to
[1:28:43] her Heavenly bridegroom as the Bible
[1:28:45] would say you think about an anointed
[1:28:47] word of God that's been Vindicated any
[1:28:49] man that's born to be a Son of God he'll
[1:28:52] see God's message as sure as there's a
[1:28:54] in heaven you know why Martin Luther did
[1:28:56] it in the days of Martin Luther he saw
[1:28:58] the message for his age and he believed
[1:29:00] it John Wesley done it he saw the
[1:29:02] message for his age and he believed it
[1:29:04] and started a great Revival think of it
[1:29:06] these Great Men the Pentecost done it on
[1:29:09] the day of Pentecost when it came they
[1:29:10] followed just what Wesley done the same
[1:29:13] outpouring of the Holy Ghost that fell
[1:29:14] in the days of John Wesley and the days
[1:29:16] of Martin Luther is the same thing that
[1:29:18] fell on the day of Pentecost don't don't
[1:29:20] think that that Pentecost just started
[1:29:21] in 1906 on ausa street that ain't where
[1:29:24] it came from it fell in the book of Acts
[1:29:26] 2,000 years ago and every anointed man
[1:29:28] of God since that time has been anointed
[1:29:31] by the same spirit of
[1:29:33] God John Wesley found his Martin Luther
[1:29:36] found his the Pentecost found his but
[1:29:38] what about you that's right brother you
[1:29:41] have an ear that's anointed to
[1:29:44] hear you thinkk many in the days of
[1:29:46] Jesus and I'm going to close with this
[1:29:49] many in the days of Jesus heard and they
[1:29:52] believed but the the but the crowd still
[1:29:56] cried
[1:29:57] crucified isn't it something there were
[1:29:59] many that believed but the crowd cried
[1:30:02] crucified he was anointed to preach but
[1:30:05] they crucified him anyway you said well
[1:30:07] if there's anointing there'd be no
[1:30:08] persecution there's anointing there'd be
[1:30:10] no no that ain't the case not at all
[1:30:13] they crucified him do you realize to be
[1:30:14] a follower of Jesus in that day you'd
[1:30:17] have to be accounted as trash you'd had
[1:30:20] to be you'd had to suffer persecution
[1:30:22] you'd had to Bear the shame of the
[1:30:24] crucifixion no wonder they were hiding
[1:30:25] when he was crucified cuz they were men
[1:30:27] and women just like us yes sir and they
[1:30:30] suffered the shame of of the crucifixion
[1:30:33] and to be called you know you realize
[1:30:34] what an ugly thing that it was in the
[1:30:37] minds of the Pharisees for you to say
[1:30:39] that you were a follower of Jesus Christ
[1:30:41] it was an ugly thing to say that and to
[1:30:44] say that today to be a True Believer and
[1:30:46] say I just want to follow the word I
[1:30:48] want to follow the Bible I just want to
[1:30:49] be a real follower of Jesus Christ well
[1:30:51] you don't fit in in any in any group so
[1:30:54] it's the old ugly ducking in the minds
[1:30:56] of the Pharisee it's still an ugly thing
[1:30:59] because you just want to follow Jesus
[1:31:00] Christ you're not a part of the right
[1:31:02] Charter so you don't fit in but I just
[1:31:04] want to follow Jesus Christ you're not a
[1:31:06] part of the right group but I just want
[1:31:08] to follow Jesus Christ you're why you
[1:31:10] didn't you didn't go to the right school
[1:31:11] but I just want to follow Jesus Christ
[1:31:13] why you wasn't you wasn't Anointed with
[1:31:15] the with the oil you wasn't you wasn't
[1:31:17] ordained by the right man but I just
[1:31:18] want to follow Jesus Christ let me ask
[1:31:20] you who was it that ordained Moses when
[1:31:23] he went to the back side out of a desert
[1:31:24] it was the power of God that came down
[1:31:26] to a burning bush that took the word of
[1:31:28] God and began to speak it to his heart
[1:31:30] that he could write the first five books
[1:31:31] of the Bible he was anointed by God to
[1:31:35] preach the word of God and God still has
[1:31:38] men and women in this hour that are
[1:31:40] anointed by God to be able to stand upon
[1:31:42] the word of God and testify to a lost
[1:31:44] and dying world Amen that's the
[1:31:47] anointing that we need anointed you
[1:31:49] think about it even in the days of Jesus
[1:31:51] as anointed as the message was it didn't
[1:31:54] match the Theologian it was persecuted
[1:31:56] it was crucified and are you ready for
[1:31:58] it brother Charles his crucifixion I
[1:32:00] know this may this may shock some folks
[1:32:03] but his crucifixion was not a private
[1:32:06] crucifixion hello somebody come on I
[1:32:08] want you to hear that it'll mean
[1:32:09] something to you one day his crucifixion
[1:32:11] was not private it was very public it
[1:32:14] ain't no secret crucifixion when they
[1:32:16] went to crucify Jesus Christ and all
[1:32:18] those that followed him it was very
[1:32:20] public it was ordinances that were
[1:32:21] posted on the PO to identify who they
[1:32:24] were and if you find any of them bring
[1:32:25] them down to the jail cuz they're a
[1:32:27] bunch of Heretics and they've lost their
[1:32:28] minds it was very public it was
[1:32:31] publicized everywhere it was announced
[1:32:33] in the newsletters it was announced on
[1:32:35] the street corners it was announced at
[1:32:36] the post at the Judgment Hall where even
[1:32:38] a man named Paul or Saul would go down
[1:32:41] looking for a bill that he could take
[1:32:42] those Christians and put them in a jail
[1:32:44] cell because they wanted to follow Jesus
[1:32:46] Christ they didn't fit in the
[1:32:49] theologians they didn't fit in the
[1:32:51] Pharisees they didn't fit in Judaism
[1:32:53] they didn't fit in the synagogues but
[1:32:56] they were anointed to follow an anointed
[1:32:59] word a public crucifix you realize
[1:33:02] that's the same thing today yeah it'll
[1:33:05] never be private amen that's right
[1:33:07] brother it'll never be private it'll be
[1:33:08] very public to you think you think
[1:33:11] anytime a Christian gets in trouble
[1:33:12] isn't it something you let anybody from
[1:33:14] any church ever do anything and it's
[1:33:16] publicized across the world Across the
[1:33:18] Nation the the guy out there in the bar
[1:33:20] he can do the same thing it'll never be
[1:33:22] publicized that's right but it's there
[1:33:24] because the the Satan wants to shed
[1:33:26] light on the hypocrisy of Christianity
[1:33:29] to turn anybody from being a Believer
[1:33:30] and being able to follow Christ let
[1:33:32] people do crazy stuff and there's people
[1:33:34] all over this world that do crazy stuff
[1:33:36] but that's what they pick out and
[1:33:37] publicize never do the never does the
[1:33:40] media take some Revival or or a move of
[1:33:43] God and say you know God really came and
[1:33:45] there was many Souls that were one to
[1:33:47] the kingdom of God wasn't that a
[1:33:48] wonderful thing down there in Black Rock
[1:33:50] when they baptized 10 people that gave
[1:33:51] their heart to the Lord they don't want
[1:33:52] to talk about that yeah let's find
[1:33:54] something wrong with somebody that we
[1:33:56] can talk about that and make that make
[1:33:58] that why because crucifixion is public
[1:34:02] persecution is
[1:34:03] public you know what it didn't matter
[1:34:06] how public it was the Believers remain
[1:34:09] believers they went through they went
[1:34:11] through being crucified they went
[1:34:12] through being burnt with oil they went
[1:34:14] through being being burned at the steak
[1:34:16] brother Wesley they none of them ever
[1:34:17] cared they went and laid down their life
[1:34:19] for Jesus Christ and I thank God that
[1:34:22] there's still some Believers in this
[1:34:23] United United States of America that
[1:34:25] still says I want to be a Bible believer
[1:34:27] and I think we have a right to stand
[1:34:28] upon this Bible that that that this
[1:34:30] world may one day they may do away with
[1:34:32] it but they'll never take it out of the
[1:34:33] heart of these believers they may take
[1:34:36] every book they can burn every one of
[1:34:37] them they they they can do what they
[1:34:39] want but they'll never take it out of
[1:34:40] the heart of the believer because he was
[1:34:42] anointed to preach it and you was
[1:34:43] anointed to hear it we're anointed in
[1:34:46] this hour to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ you think about it we we we we we
[1:34:53] we we can go back all the way to the
[1:34:54] Bible we'll find out that Moses in his
[1:34:57] day you think he he was not the only
[1:34:59] prophet in the day but there was also a
[1:35:01] prophet named balum you know the
[1:35:03] difference between balum and Moses is
[1:35:05] that balum was concerned about his
[1:35:07] position with an Earthly King and Moses
[1:35:09] was concerned about his position with a
[1:35:11] Heavenly
[1:35:12] King bam wanted to be approved of by Bao
[1:35:16] and Moses wanted to be approved of by
[1:35:18] God you know when bam went down he began
[1:35:21] to prophesy all the good things notice
[1:35:23] what BB did here as he would he would
[1:35:26] come and B would tell him he would take
[1:35:27] him to the bad parts of Israel he'd say
[1:35:29] but look at all the things that they'
[1:35:30] done wrong look at all this stuff look
[1:35:32] at all this carnal stuff he said see
[1:35:35] they had sides of them think about this
[1:35:36] they had sides of them that were not
[1:35:38] praiseworthy but in spite of their
[1:35:40] imperfections the purpose of God that
[1:35:43] works to election by his grace and not
[1:35:46] by works despite of their imperfections
[1:35:49] they had a cloud by day and a pillar of
[1:35:51] Fire by night they had a Smit Rock they
[1:35:54] still had a Brazen serpent they still
[1:35:56] had signs and wonders and they were
[1:35:57] Vindicated by God in God that's good why
[1:36:02] in spite of their imperfections you say
[1:36:03] brother Matt what's that mean that means
[1:36:05] you may have places in your life that
[1:36:07] are not praiseworthy I'm talking to
[1:36:09] somebody you may have pray places in
[1:36:12] your life that are not praiseworthy but
[1:36:14] in spite of your imperfections you still
[1:36:17] have access to Healing there's still
[1:36:19] salvation there's still the Holy Ghost
[1:36:22] there's still a place to find Refuge
[1:36:24] you're still Sons and Daughters of God
[1:36:26] in spite of your imperfections in spite
[1:36:29] of your places in your life that aren't
[1:36:30] praiseworthy you still belong to God
[1:36:33] won't you to stand to your feet this
[1:36:34] morning see if he was the Messiah the
[1:36:38] anointed one for that day that would
[1:36:39] come to fulfill the word of God to be a
[1:36:42] redeemer and the anointed one think of
[1:36:45] what God done with that one when he went
[1:36:46] into the grave on he was crucified but
[1:36:49] he raised again amen and if he done it
[1:36:52] with that body then what about his bride
[1:36:54] today that's anointed for this day she's
[1:36:57] already been raised with him in
[1:36:58] Resurrection because they are
[1:37:02] one we're flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:37:04] his bone that's right so we were
[1:37:06] crucified with him persecuted with him
[1:37:09] resurrected with him on the third day
[1:37:11] brother Mark when he ascended we go with
[1:37:13] him you think about it we're a part of
[1:37:15] him the Bible said he's the head and
[1:37:17] we're the body that's right so just as
[1:37:19] much as Christ is the head so are we the
[1:37:22] body that's right right so if that body
[1:37:25] was resurrected and this is the anointed
[1:37:27] bride of Jesus Christ I'm not talking
[1:37:29] about the people in this building I'm
[1:37:31] talking about around the
[1:37:32] world but this is these Believers that
[1:37:36] that are followers of Jesus
[1:37:38] Christ all around the world many
[1:37:40] churches true hearts True Believers that
[1:37:44] just love
[1:37:46] God I don't care what name's on the door
[1:37:49] I'm talking about the name that's
[1:37:50] written in the heart of the believer
[1:37:52] they're followers
[1:37:54] of Jesus Christ True Believers that the
[1:37:57] anointed one for this day is the Bride
[1:38:00] of Jesus Christ and she's already been
[1:38:03] raised with him in Resurrection because
[1:38:05] they are
[1:38:06] one that means there ain't no enemy can
[1:38:09] hold you that's right no power can
[1:38:12] oppress
[1:38:14] you any evil or wickedness that's been
[1:38:16] released upon this world has only been
[1:38:20] only been for one purpose and that's to
[1:38:22] drive you back to God amen any
[1:38:24] wickedness any evil that's been released
[1:38:26] you feel like it's been released upon
[1:38:28] your life it's been done for one reason
[1:38:31] it's to drive you back to God why is
[1:38:34] this wickedness come upon my family why
[1:38:36] why are these evil things coming why we
[1:38:37] got such battles why are these trial so
[1:38:40] great is to drive you back to God Amen
[1:38:43] you notice what God does said but at the
[1:38:45] end of it when they found theirself back
[1:38:48] with
[1:38:49] him then he took and he brought judgment
[1:38:52] upon the evil he said now remove that
[1:38:55] yoke from off you can I read it again
[1:38:58] thus sayith the Lord God my people that
[1:39:00] dwell in
[1:39:01] Zion that's the Bride of Jesus

[1:39:30] little while yes th ignation shall cease
[1:39:34] and my anger and their
[1:39:36] destruction and the Lord of her hosts

[1:39:40] according to the slaughter of Midian at
[1:39:42] the rock of Orab and as his Rob is upon
[1:39:45] the sea so shall he lift up after the
[1:39:48] manner of Egypt and it shall come to
[1:39:50] pass in that day that his burden shall
[1:39:52] be taken away away from off his shoulder
[1:39:55] and his work his yoke shall be taken
[1:39:58] away from off of thy neck and the Yoke I
[1:40:02] love this part and the Yoke shall be
[1:40:06] destroyed in other word the very yoke
[1:40:08] that the enemy would use to bind you he
[1:40:10] said in a very little while I'll remove
[1:40:13] the power of the Yoke and destroy it and
[1:40:15] it'll never have no power over you any
[1:40:16] longer not that he would remove the Yoke

[1:40:24] be replaced amen their yoke I feel the
[1:40:27] presence of the Lord amen their yoke

[1:40:39] that have been anointed by the word of
[1:40:41] God in this hour the resurrection of
[1:40:44] Jesus Christ the spirit of God a true
[1:40:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost it ain't some
[1:40:49] ritual it ain't try to get people to
[1:40:51] speak in tongues and things like people
[1:40:53] make it out to be or some show but it's
[1:40:55] a real change in the life of a human
[1:40:57] being when the spirit of God comes into
[1:40:59] the heart of a of a human being it
[1:41:01] drives all of the things of the enemy
[1:41:03] out it'll take every Idol out of your
[1:41:05] heart all those things that you used to
[1:41:07] worship all those old spirits and things
[1:41:09] that you use to worship the spirit of
[1:41:11] God will make you clean of them God
[1:41:14] wants a clean
[1:41:15] house can I say it that way he wants a
[1:41:18] clean place of worship where people will
[1:41:20] worship God and God Alone where they'll
[1:41:23] look to Jesus Christ and he alone he
[1:41:25] said I'll never have no other God before
[1:41:28] me you can't ever put a god between you
[1:41:31] and God you can never put another man
[1:41:33] between you and God it's Christ and
[1:41:35] Christ alone oh look at the image that's
[1:41:38] before us this morning what's been
[1:41:40] lifted up in this hour is Jesus Christ
[1:41:43] and he's not lifted up on the cross many
[1:41:46] would take the image of the Cross of
[1:41:48] Calvary and they lifted up oh but do you
[1:41:50] realize a crucifixion or a picture of
[1:41:52] Jesus hanging on the cross that ain't
[1:41:54] what's been lifted up but it's a
[1:41:56] resurrected savior that's been lifted in
[1:41:59] this hour that's right he said and if I
[1:42:01] be lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[1:42:04] he'll draw them under the anointing of
[1:42:06] Jesus Christ that you might have power
