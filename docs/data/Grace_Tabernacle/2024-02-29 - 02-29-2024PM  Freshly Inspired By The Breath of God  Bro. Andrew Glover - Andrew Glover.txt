believe this message and amen have been dear to our life and and a real inspiration to us and all the ministers I know there are so many here tonight God bless you brothers and your Ministries and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the book of St John the 20th chapter we want to begin there tonight in John 20 and um while you're turning there tonight I do want to give a special thanks to brother Wendell and sister fresa for bringing us over from Oklahoma drove us over today and to be here in the meetings tonight we sure sure appreciate apprciate them for being here as well Amen in St John chapter 20 and verse number 18 you love the Lord tonight amen in John chapter 20 and verse 18 the Bible here is speaking of Jesus resurrection and in the 18th verse the Bible says Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her and then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews I want you to notice this came Jesus and stood in the midst now we know that Jesus is the word he was the word made flesh so we could very well say the word came and stood in their midst Jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this now I want you to catch this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained now I love that he says as my father has sent me so send I you then he breathes on them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost and right after that he begins to speak of the authority that he's given to the church that has received the Holy Ghost amen I believe that tonight I believe that same Authority is in the church here tonight don't you amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord tonight to speak to you here and if I will tell of this tonight I want to speak to you on freshly inspired by the Breath of God Amen freshly inspired by the Breath of God you know I believe if there ever was a time that we could use a refreshing I believe we could use it right now amen I believe we could use a refreshing in our homes in our churches and our lives amen I believe if there's ever been a time that the Believers of this end time word amen could use a refreshing I believe that time is right now now when you look at that word refresh of of course you know uh that the root word refresh is fresh and when you look at the definition of that word fresh it means to have its original qualities unimpaired to be full or renewed in Vigor not to be stale nor sour nor decayed not faded amen I love this one not altered by processing amen so when something is fresh it has its original qualities amen and those qualities are not decayed they're not faded they're not sour they're not not stale amen but they're still packing the same quality that they were packing in the beginning and when you look at that word qualities it means the standard of something amen as measured against other things of a similar kind it is the degree of Excellence of something there is a distinctive attribute or characteristic that is possessed amen by someone or something now we believe amen that Jesus was the word made flesh and the prophet said that Jesus was Poss amen with all the fine qualities of God so all that was in God Amen he poured into Jesus Christ and when Jesus amen met Satan there in Matthew 4 you will realize that brother BR said he did not use any of those qualities so he was full amen fully possessed of the qualities of God but when he met the devil he did not use any of those qualities but rather he said these words it is written and the prophet said see what he was doing was he was bringing the power and the authority of the word of God into the reach of the weakest of Christian amen so I believe that our refreshing is not coming amen from who we are or what church we attend or where we're going amen but our refreshing is coming from the word now I just want to take a minute here and read you a paragraph from the message here ye him ma Matthew 17 brother BR preaching on Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and he says you know that God's word is so Eternal it's so inspired that it's not just for one one occasion or for one generation he says but the word of God Is So Eternal it's the same and it's the truth amen how many can agree the word is the Eternal it is the same and it is the truth he said the same word that inspired the disciples it inspired the first Royal disciples and then the next as they followed down through the Lutheran age through the Methodist age and every age and it's just as sufficient and inspiring today to us as it was the first day it was given and if the world should stand stand a million years that word would still be just as inspired to the generations that will follow amen as it is to us because it is perfect amen it is always given for the time he said now one great way we could approach this afternoon the coming of the Lord see first of Moses and then Elijah and then Jesus he said then we notice that Peter while he was there amen he had just been freshly inspired because he had just given a witness to who Jesus was amen and he was inspired he said now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word then the two Inspirations gives a result no matter how well you study the word it'll never do you no good amen till you are inspired yourself amen it takes your inspiration the word is already inspired ain't that beautiful that we didn't gather here tonight amen to inspire the word but the word is already inspired amen but as the word begins to go forth there is an inspiration amen that is released from that word that falls upon your life amen and then you become as inspired as the word is inspired and the prophet said that's what we need today is an inspiration over us amen God sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself amen that it might Inspire us and Quicken us and awaken us to his word amen when the word being brought in the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things take place because the two just comes together amen I love this that the word of God is not like the word of a man when the word of a man is given it's only given for a certain meaning or it has an expression for a Time amen but the word of God has an eternal meaning down Through the Ages brother B said every generation can pick up the same word amen because it is an inspired Eternal Everlasting amen nonfading declaration from God if the apostles read it it meant something for them him if Wesley read it it meant something for him if Luther and Calvin read it it meant something for him but yet today it's just as brilliant and bright and it's got just as much in effect as it did for them on the day it was spoken because it is God's word he said when God speaks it's Eternal it's breathed from the very breath of the immortal Everlasting amen Creator himself and listen friends we're not here tonight amen with a word that has lost its original qualities amen but the same qualities that the word had Amen on the day of Pentecost and in the beginning amen that word has the same qualities tonight if that word healed then that word heals now if that word save then that word saves now if that word delivered then that word delivers now amen because it's not the words of a man it's not the ideas of a denomination it is a nonfading declaration it is the Breath of God that is breathing over the church let me say this the message of the hour amen has brought the word of God to us unaltered amen it's not been processed it's not been soured down and diluted amen but it's got just as much strength it's got just as much ability it's got just as much anointing right here tonight friends amen you're in the way of the word and the word can do what the word said he can do listen this is not a man's word this is a king's word and a king's word is not altered said a king's word must be carried out and when God speaks it must be car it must be carried out there's no altering playing politics it's got to be taken out exactly the way he said it if it once spoken it's established forever in glory amen so when we read his word it's Eternal and will never cease to exist amen that's powerful church when we read his word and his word inspires us his word amen will never cease to exist listen then you are a people who have been born by the word and that's why the devil hates you amen is there's nothing he can do to defeat you there's nothing he can do to put you Amen on the extinction list amen you have been birthed by the word of God and every time the devil knocks us down amen the word is breathed over us and we get back up amen every time the devil attacks our body amen somebody breathes the word of Mark 16 over us and healing comes into our body every time the devil says we're not going to make it amen somebody comes behind the puit and says I saw you there amen and that's more than just a quote that is a nonfading declaration of the almighty God that devil can't stop us and hell can't defeat us the word is in the prde and she will manifest everything not altered not soured not decayed but with the same strength and the same Vigor amen the word must have preeminence amen the word must have the preeminence Amen brother said the word of God it must have the first place in the service Amen in job 32:8 amen I love what the Bible says it says there is a spirit in man and it is the inspiration of the almighty amen that giveth him understanding when you look at that word inspiration it means breath it is the spirit or the Breath of God Amen it is every breathing thing amen the spirit of man so when we read that tonight we can say it like this in other words amen the breath of the almighty amen is what giveth us the understanding in job 33:4 the Bible said the spirit of God hath made me and the breath of the almighty amen hath given me life I love what the prophet says oh God who formed the heavens and the Earth and just let his breath go forth with his word and everything take in its right position amen there is a direct connection between the Breath of God Amen bringing you into your position position he said the Earth and the moon and the stars they just swung into place amen as God breathed upon his word and oh God today we ask that you'll breathe on your word as we are trying to bring it to the people may it take its position this morning its place and be rooted and grounded in every heart that we might receive the blessings of God listen every breath that we breathe amen is coming from God every breath that we breathe is coming from God now in Genesis chapter 2 amen you'll find there is the first word amen that breath is mentioned in the Bible in Genesis 2:7 the Bible says and the Lord God Amen for man of the Dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life amen and Man became a living soul brother man picks this up and says I can see Adam standing amen let's take it this way we see him standing like a tree amen God has made him he's not dead he said he was his dead rather as he could be amen and his toes like the roots amen was sticking in the ground amen but God said let there be amen here's Adam in the creation and his toes are in the ground amen like Roots but then God says Amen Let There Be and When God says that brother said oh he breathed the breath of life into him amen and he jumped and he came to himself amen let me say this the Breath of God Amen has the ability to bring a Son of God Amen to the recognition that they are a son of God Amen the same breath amen that breathed into Adam and he became a living soul and recognized that he was a God and he was a Son of God Amen I'm getting ahead of myself but I'm going to say it amen that's the same breath in Luke the 15th chapter amen that the prodal son was out of his position amen the prodical son was in the hog pin he didn't belong in the hog pin he belonged in the father's house amen but the same breath that brought Adam to a recognition that you don't belong here as a dead tree you are a son of God it's the same breath that breathed in the prodical son and caus him to leave the hog pin and go back to his rightful position I say that's the same breath that's brought every sinner in the house of God that's the same breath that's delivered every prodical in this generation amen because it's God breathing on the church and his word still has the same effect and the same power that it had back there amen when you begin to the Breath of God you will find amen that creation is connected to the Breath of God in Isaiah 42:5 he said thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it amen he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and the spirit to them that walk therein brother said you are the God who brings forth the first breath of life that ever come onto the Earth and has had control of every life until this present time amen I'm I'm laying a foundation if that's okay amen but this one just blows my mind the problem of God speaking the Breath of God he said now look he said look he said upon the mountains amen watching the great planations and so forth the great planets of the heavens and the solar system amen knowing that you made them Lord and you spun them out there with your hands now watch the prophet you blowed your breath in the palm of your hands and every Star come into existence amen before the star was in the sky amen it was in the hand of God and when he breathed into his hand amen the breath that BW across his hand amen was created breath and it created the stars and you all know what the prophet said he said the stars of God are the sons of God listen every devil in hell is trying to disposition you every spirit in hell is trying to get you out of your position amen but I come here tonight to put hell on notice amen we have not put oursel here by a handshake we have not put oursel here by sigining a card amen but the same breath that blew across the hand of God and created the stars and the natural is the same breath that is blw across our lives and positionally placed us as adopted sons of God listen we are not in the hands of a man we are not in the hands of a church we are in the hands of God and the prophet of God said God wants to be God and if he ain't God he ain't going to be second place he don't have to let bail and some man make dogma and some theory of some man or some idea of a Creed or some idea of a denomination standing his way he is God and he takes what he can get in his hand he takes what he can get in his hand amen that is nothing and he breathes the breath of life into it and it becomes something amen that will serve him amen that's what makes him God Amen I don't know about you but I can Rejoice tonight amen because I was that nothing I was on my my way to hell I was a sinner born in sin amen shaping iniquity amen but one day God picked me up amen and he breathed into his hand and when he breathed in his hand he created somebody who would say Amen to his word he created somebody that would believe he's God and there's no God above him and there's no God with him he's God and he's God alone well listen every believer here tonight you're in his hands amen you got the same power and the same Authority you've not been created to be Defeated You've not been created to be nervous you've not been created to be confused you have been created by the Breath of God Amen to manifest the promises of God and there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough jealous Spirits out of the pits of hell that will ever defeat you from being what God has breathed upon you to be he breathed upon you to be an overcomer he breathed upon you to be a Victor he breathed upon you to be a champion he breathed upon you to be a Victor and in this age the devil cannot stop it the Breath of God has positioned us in our place and that breath now I might as well preach that breath is a sign of life I said that breath is a sign of life and if there is no breath then there is no life come on if there is no breath amen there is no life amen let somebody fall over amen pick up the phone call 911 what's the first thing they say are they breathing amen are they breathing because they want to know oh God is there a sign of life and the prophet said now the baby's born with live muscles he's got a beating heart but no Breath of Life in it its muscles is twitching now watch he said if there wasn't a spirit that had to come into it later than our breath amen could leave us and we could breathe no more and still be alive but when this body does not receive amen oxygen or breath when this body does not receive oxygen or breath he says the intake and the outtake of our lungs amen then we are dead so you can be sitting and Tak it in and Tak it in and Tak it in and you can still be dead because the lungs have to take in and they have to outtake in other words the intake and the outtake of our lungs they work together to bring oxygen into the body amen and take carbon dioxide which is a waste product out amen so when you breathe amen when you breathe in amen you're breathing in oxygen amen but when you exhale you're letting poison and you're letting things that shouldn't be there amen out of your lungs amen as you're intaking and out taking amen your lungs are getting stronger now I might as well preach I'm this close to it amen if you want a living church amen preach this message if you want young people on fire preach this message amen listen come on now amen anything outside of this message is carbon dioxide side and we choke on it we choke on your opinions we choke on your traditions we choke on your man-made doctrines amen but give us the word give us the Breath of God until we can breathe again we can praise again we can confess the word again we can get some Liberty and Shout again we can get our power back we ain't got to take in everything we've been anointed to take in some things but I might as well say it some things have got to come in and some things have got to go some things have got to come in and some things have got to go amen the word has got to come in and our Traditions has got to go the word has got to come in and our ideas has got to go can I say this joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's got to come in and depression has got to go the peace of God that passes all understanding has got to come in and confusion and nervousness and anxiety it's got to go I might as well say it amen healing has got to come in and cancer has got to go healing has got to come in and make room for miracles and sickness has got to go you got to start breathing again you got to start taking in the word and breathing out the trash some things have got to be taken in and some things have got to be taken out now the more you breathe in and the more you breathe out amen the stronger your lungs will get that brings me to my next Point amen breath is connected to praise breath is connected to praise so don't get mad at us because we got some good lungs Amen to praise God with amen we got some good lungs Amen to bless the name of the Lord listen we've been through enough we faced enough we fought enough Devils we fought enough situation I think it's time to let our hair down and just have church again until the anointing of God comes in the building and begins to blow across the church and our young people can breathe our preachers can breathe our singers can breathe oh Breath of God breathe on the church again and put a song set of lungs that'll praise God come on somebody I'm talking about breathing out your problems and breathing in the word breathe out the negativity and breathe in the positive gospel breathe out the that devil don't like it but our lungs are getting stronger and they're getting stronger we're breathing out amens we're breathing out hallelujah we're breathing out glory to God Amen don't get mad at us if we're in a CLI service and we just scream out hallelujah it's CZ our lungs are feeling the breath of the Creator and all we can say is hallelujah amen it's going to be okay he is a Healer he is a deliverer he is a way maker he is a Red Sea opener he is a wall bringer down Hallelujah we've been taking in the word and breathing out the problems and our lungs woo brother our lungs are strong our lungs are strong the devil hates it I might as well preach it here the devil hates it cuz our lungs are so strong when Trouble Comes our way we just throw up our hands and start praising God the devil hates it brother Tim when a bad problem comes we just throw up our head and say well if he did it before he's going to do it again when the devil throws sickness our way we go look in the word and say if he healed before he's going to heal again I'm talking about a church that's got some Psalms 150 lungs let everything that ha breath praise ye the Lord now job said when the Breath of God comes the understanding will come so in other words the prophet of God said Lord we don't know how it's beyond our understanding to know how to give you praise but with breath comes understanding with breath comes understanding in other words the prophet of God said amen now I'm not emotionally but I am and anything without emotion is dead he said if you say you love somebody and you don't express that love he said then that's an expression he said now we should constantly long to be in worship to Worship the Lord to worship him at home to worship him while we're driving our cars wherever we are amen Worship the Lord I'm going to take away your excuse tonight if that's okay the Bible said let everything that hath breath praise the Lord and he said praise ye the Lord and here's the words of our Prophet amen even if you haven't got any breath amen still praise the Lord now that's a heavy one brother Joel if you haven't got any breath amen still praise the Lord I love this one don't you just love that amen that sweet mellow of the holy spirit amen just breathing upon us like see it's so simple amen that all the starch and all the intellectuals of the world has been taken away and the spirits just worshiping oh church amen the spirit is just worshiping amen worshiping God through us the Holy Spirit making intercessions Hallelujah breathing out Worship in other words God created you and then he breathed upon you and he put a breath in you to praise him and then the breath that he put in you to praise him is the Tabernacle that the Holy Ghost is dwelling in and now if you got the Holy Ghost amen and you feel like praising God don't you take no backwat amen don't you take no criticism amen because it's really not you praising it's really not you doing what you're doing but it's the Holy Ghost on the inside of you amen that's wanting to praise the god that is serving oh God wherever that inspired word is wherever that inspired word is if it connects if it makes contact amen with a Believer there's going to be a praise wherever the inspired word strikes the seed in your soul there is going to be a praise let me just say this brother B we went in an noted Baptist Church here in City of Tucson so we went in there to see if we could kind of get a little fresh feeling you know he said we went in there and sit down preacher got up and got to preaching about Israel leaving Egypt he said how they didn't have to go back and eat that garlic no more and he said something like the people of the day he said we all said amen he said we all said amen he said I never seen a bunch the whole church lost side of the preacher and look back to see who it was said amen it like just scared them to death see they didn't know what it was but David said Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord praise him on the harps praise him on the salry let everything that has breath amen praise ye the Lord can I say what a prophet said God rejoices in his people God rejoices in his people he said so let them of the learn say Amen when anything is said right amen it's not you amen it's God responding through you to his word glory to God I just say this amen you can only contain so much before you got to let an amen out you can only contain so much before you got to let a Hallelujah out amen cuz this word we're preaching is not sour and it's not stale and it's not polluted and it's not altered amen it's got the same Vigor in it that it had on Sunset Mountain it's got the same power in it that it had in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s and if it comes in the life of a Believer there's going to be somebody yield their selves to that word and manifest the potentials of it amen I love it I love to think about how amen that we've not been been born by our own life or our own breath rather we have been born by the Breath of God brother preaches that Blasphemous names and he says now I'm going to correct something here the Jehovah Witness teach this that your breath is the soul he said that's not right he said now the breath is wind and wind is what you breathe into your nostrils he goes through Genesis 2 and said but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he become a living Soul amen a soul that cannot die now notice breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul because God breathed not what nature done but what God did he breathed the breath into his nostrils and he become a living Soul you say to me brother brandom Adam died but remember amen but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him those who he forne he is called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type amen Adam F fa then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was a Son of God now breath he says as the African word they use the word Amo he said which means the wind or an unseen Force he said but listen animals breathe amoya amen and sinners breathe Amo he said but God upon Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven he was God of the earth now watch a prophet and someday the sons of God will become Gods again then when Adam fell amen the breath did not die amen but the breath has come into the church and this the father has sent me so send I you listen friends amen if anybody got a right to praise God if anybody got to right to confess the word of God is the Bride of Jesus Christ who has been born amen for a Time such as this amen I'll tell you what the devil don't want you to do he don't want you to come to yourself he don't want the Breath of God to come into you and cause you to come to yourself because when you come to yourself he's lost himself when you come to yourself that devil is finished but I say old tonight let the Breath of God breathe across the church and let the Believers come to themselves and recognize we're not a bunch of poor peasants we're not a bunch of begly church members we are the sons of God in the last days who have been prophesied to be here in the age we're living in I say this with everything within me the true church is you and the true church is born by the Breath of God listen we didn't join the church we were born in the church by the word that's why bad days can't take us out that's why depression can't take us out that's why sickness can't take us out it's cuz we didn't come in by those things and we're not going out by those things I might as well preach that's why our favorite singer can't bring us in and our favorite singer can't take us out that's why our favorite preacher can't bring us in and our favorite preacher can't take us out come on church that's why a gift cannot bring us in and a gift cannot take us out we come into this P the jees of almighty God born by the word Eternal with God he said that's how we have eternal life because we were spoken into existence by God not joined into a church but born by the word the original seed that God said let there be and there was listen friends God watches over his word and God Reveals His word then his word must have the preeminence can I say this to you the revelation of the word is the inspiration of the age there's a million people carrying the same Bible you're carrying and they're living without Revelation but in the last days according to Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 amen the son of man would be revealed again and the prophet said when you see the church getting worly like it was in the days of Sodom see the church all going in the worship of the God of this eil evil age but then you'll see a little minority group they'll be gathered out there under the inspiration of God and they will be producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the same scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what power you're living in oh Church we're not living under some man's inspiration we're not living under a Church's inspiration but we're living under the influence of the third po that is open the word to the church come on friends I think it's time to turn away and Look Away to Jesus look away from this problem look away from this situation well this church is doing that and this preacher is doing this and this church is doing that amen forget it all and Look Away to Jesus again and see him high and see him whole ho and see him as The God Who was the god who is and the god which shall ever be come on I think it's time to remember God sent a message and I think it's time to look at that message and forget everything contrary to that message and stand with the message of the hour if you have to stand alone Church stand there because somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus he'll stand with you he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you don't you get out from under this inspiration don't you get out from under this inspiration you stay under it you live under this inspiration let this inspiration change you now the prophet of God said what's happening right now and this is what the devil hates he said no man come to me except my father draws him and all the father has given me will come are you ready for this it's the word joining with the word yes sir the word is joining with the word in other words we are called by the word the written word has called out to the predestinated word and there has been a union there has been a marriage take place between the written word and the predestinated word and you are the fruit of that Union you have been called by the word somebody say the word word now if we're this far into it let's go and say this what a prophet says are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst the Bible said that Jesus walked in a room and there were Jews in there that were afraid over what was taking place but he walked in there and the word came in their midst and when the word come in their midst the word rebuked the fear and release them of the questions the prophet said Jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergan age which was yet 200 years off from the patmas vision he knew the drift would caus him to go in the Dark Ages he knew the way man would originally get away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave the word you have left God thus he has presented himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages and here's what he's saying I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't you ever let anything or anyone get between you and that word this which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that don't you let anything or anyone get between you and the word I am the word remember that he said I wonder then if we are sufficiently amen impressed with the word that's in our midst he begins to talk about the word and how you should pray in the name of Jesus then he says there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word word and we cannot petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus somebody shout Jesus the name is the word brother says will you cannot separate God and the word they are one now then the word that he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled life he said there it is he is spirit and he is life here it is church so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go come on Church Satan cannot stand before that man I tell you why the devil wants to take the word out of the church it's because he wants to take the power of the word out of the church if he can separate you from the word that he can run you around he can paralyze you he can taunt you amen but if you ever recognize amen that the word has stepped into Grace Tabernacle and you join yourself with that word and you say come whatever I'm not leaving the word deity will be in your midst Hallelujah notice he said are we sufficiently impressed with the word now I want to say this the prophet did not say sufficiently impressed with signs he said word although we believe in signs but let me say what a prophet said signs can be impersonated but the word cannot be impersonated the devil can impersonate a sign but he cannot impersonate the word now I'm just going to is it okay if I preach brother Matt amen I'm going to read a quote where the prophet of God said more and more I made to believe that people are not getting to Christ and you know what a bunch of a bunch of bunch of reprobate Spirits has done with that quote is they've said well the message is one thing and Christ is another Amen brother Bram never separated Christ in this message he said this message is Christ amen you don't get somebody to Christ and then get them to the message amen I say get them to the message and you get them to the way to the truth to the life get him to the message you get him to the atonement in action get him to the message and you have just introduced him to the identified characteristic of Jesus Christ and it's not a natural characteristic it's a supernatural characteristic oh may I announce to you tonight this is not a natural church with a bunch of intellectual starchy formal ideas this is a supernatural Church church that has been birthed by the Breath of God and the fire of God and the power of God has come in the Church of God and there's a strength in this church we know how to overcome we know how to move mountains we know how to heal we know how to pray we know how to believe for a miracle by the word of God we're not a bunch of a bunch of babies don't know nothing we're Sons and Daughters of God and we know the word is in our midst and that word has supreme authority over every SP Spirit over every gift over every sign over everything the word has the preeminence in our midst and we're joined to that word and the prophet of God said now let me say this there's one thing he cannot impersonate he said he cannot impersonate the word in the debate between he and Jesus each time Jesus said it is written the word he never relied on his qualities but the qualities that was in the word was in him in other words you didn't get down here to Le osia and God say oh mercy I got to come up with a new way for Jonah to overcome I got to find a new way for Jonah and for the young people to get out of Le seea no he knew that his word would be inspired from the first time it was given oh god listen till the last time it was spoken his word would be inspired so he knew when you showed up you wouldn't be showing up Amen to worn out manifestations I'm I'm preaching to you now listen we ain't got to GA here and look back 30 years ago and say I remember when God I remember when God I remember when God healed Congressman Upshaw and I remember when he healed Georgia Carter I remember when he saved hady R boys I remember I remember amen the same qualities that healed up Shaw and Georgia Carter and saved Patty's boys is in this building tonight and they're not decayed and they're not sour they just need somebody that'll break beyond the traditions and believe that God is in his word and his word still packs the power to defeat that devil and bring a victory in the house of God ain't got to sit around and talk about testimonies 20 years ago no we can talk about what God's doing right here right now he's still saving I said he's still saving he's still giving the Holy Ghost he's still calling people to the message he's still revealing to them that William Brandon was a prophet he's still he's still God oh I feel like preaching he's still God his word is still true his power is still here his anointing is still accessible to whoever will break beyond the traditions and break be on the creeks and just get some starts out just get some starts out and believe God again come on we got people that ain't start you about shout but they sure start you about believing God well I don't know I don't know if God will I don't know if God can that's starchy but get rid of that starchy devil and get some power anointing get some flexibility in you that when the wind begins to blow when the winds have changeed begins to come in the house of God you ain't all starched up you can say tonight's my night this is my meeting come on church this is my hour This Is My Season right here right now don't you let the devil don't you let the devil make you all stiff when it comes to the promises of God concerning your life the word didn't come to you second-handed it comes the truth I said it come is the truth and we must receive a love for the truth we must love the truth more than anything else we must love this word more than we love our next meal we love our next paycheck on our job we love our next promotion come on young people we better love this word more than we love some sport or some idea we better fall and in love with this word because I'm going to tell you I feel like preaching here it's the only thing that's going to get you through the things when your favorite preacher ain't around and your favorite singer ain't Within Reach if you got this word in your midst he'll deliver you in school he'll deliver you in your bedroom he'll deliver you on your job come on you can walk into an agnostic atheistic amen University and stand there and testify that where is one true Living God and his name is Jesus Christ I'm talking about some word born spirit filled message of the hour pillar of power following sons and daughters of God that are joined in the word they love the word more than they love anything else yes sir amen we're not a generation of sign Seekers come on Church we're not a generation of sign Seekers remember said that's a scorcher he said but God never plac signs ahead of the word God never plac signs ahead of the word he said no that's a scorcher he said they were added for the proof of the word then how can you tell them amen give them the word test now don't get mad at me okay but let's go back and bring the word test out again let's bring the word test back to our pull pits let's bring the word test back to our singing let's bring the word test back to our let's bring the word test out of the closet and put it back as the headship of the church and stop let Little Devils come in and break up fellowship and break up Brotherhood and break up Unity amen give that devil the word test and if he don't pass kick him out and repent of the thing and move on for the glory of God and let the unity of the spirit of God ReSound in the Church of the Living God give it the word test and put that devil in his place well brother and I'm scared don't you be scared of that devil brother said the word comes first and then watch the miracle see the miracle takes place on the word tell you why the devil hates you is cuz there's going to be times that you as an individual the devil wants to lead you by your flesh he wants to lead you by your spirit but there is a soul in there that has got a Channel of inspiration and sometimes it gets clogged but the prophet of God said it got clogged to job one day he said but job had this Revelation amen I know in whom I have believed he said now want he couldn't get a word from God but the devil could not move him there was a time that job could not get a word from God but the devil could not move him he said when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do then see just wait for the channel of inspiration to open up to you and say now I'm Healed and when it drops in there then it's all over see you don't need a prayer line nothing else it's been revealed to you can I say this look at Simeon amen it was revealed to him amen that he would not see death until he seen the Lord's Christ can I say this nothing somebody say nothing nothing could shake him amen because it was revealed to him I love way the prophet says this no matter how many babies he would visit each day he knew that God had revealed to him that he was going to see the Christ before he died no matter how many babies now come on think about it Simeon was an old man his shoulders were stooped his back was probably hurting he was about ready amen he was just saying Lord I want to go on home some days but he had a revelation hanging over his life and the devil could not impersonate that Revelation by saying here's the child but there was something in simeon's heart that knew when I see that baby there will be a true certain sound that this is the Christ child let me say this amen don't you accept nothing less than a found oh God don't don't you accept nothing less than an authenticated amen miracle and manifestation of the word of God in your age don't accept some sign in the hand or some flesh or blood amen stay on that word and back that devil up now listen what the prophet of God said he said sometimes you got to get yourself out of the way and let the word of God move in now when you get yourself out of the way he said when you get that enemy of yourself out of the way then you get to a place that God can come over and he can do things that William brandom knows nothing about see when we're out of the way come on now when we're out of the way then the inspired word moves in and does things for us when we're out of the way the inspired word moves in and inspires the believer and the two Inspirations comes together and you see a result veram said preach a gospel that can make people actually that was once bootleggers and gamblers and prostitutes and everything out on the street amen set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus listen you can feel the inspiration of the spirit rise you to a place till you lose yourself and you scream out amen hallelujah amen praises to God that's a wonderful thing see what is causing that reaction is the word is back in our midst and a prophet has identified that it's the same word it's the same yesterday today and forever and whatever you have need of You Can Touch the Hem of His Garment you can pull from his virtue you can receive from his attributes listen friends he is here he's here in power he's here in Authority he's here in a third pull bride he's here in an open book come on Church get up off the ash Heap pick up the word of God and feed that experience on the inside of your soul come on sometime or another you got to lose yourself and let the Holy Ghost take over sometime or another you got to lose your ideas you got to lose your preconceived thoughts you got to lose yourself and let the Holy Ghost ignite that seed on the inside of your soul and raise you to a place that you can believe for a miracle you can believe for a prodicle you can believe for a Rapture we're not anointed by some denomination John has opened the Hallelujah the seventh Angels opened the book and John is e in the book and now there's a strength in the bride there's a strength in the bride to say Amen to what a prophet said sometime or another you got to lose yourself in amen things you don't understand oh I'm going back that devil up in the corner you got to lose yourself and amen things that your Pentecostal Traditions won't let you agree with you got to lose yourself and agree with some things that your Baptist ideas will choke on but you got to do it I said you got to do it cuz you got a prophecy over your life you got an anointing upon you and you will take the Rapture by the word well it's in here I might as well preach sometime or another you got to let this message whip your flesh sometime or another you got to let the Angel's message whip your flesh sometime or another you got to let the Angel's message whip your flesh what are you talking about I'm talking about let the message defeat your flesh the angel appears to Mary and says Mary you're going to have a child without knowing a man it's going to be the son of the most high he goes through all these things and Mary stops and brother Wayne Mary says but how shall this thing be but you know what she didn't do she didn't quit listening to the angel see don't quit listening to tapes when brother Bram crosses your idea lose yourself and let the word move in there and correct the error and move on Mary said how's this going to be and the angel kept on preaching and the angel kept on preaching and brother Matt here's what I love about it when the angel got done the only thing Mary could say was these words be it unto me aord oh no the only thing Mary could say was not how could this be do you know my background do you know my failures do you know my family when the angel got done preaching the message the only thing Mary could say was be it unto me according to Thy word Brother David Paul the message brought Mary's flesh into submission and the only thing she could do was say some morning between 6:00 and 9 I'm going to take a

16 would be the true church well the true church sister Destiny is born by the word of God so that means if you're a part of the true church then brother Joel you're a Mark 16 believer you are the word you're not following signs and wonders signs and wonders are following you you're not unsure they're following you the best example I know of is brother Danny Steam and brother Tim several years ago at Youth Camp I remember he got up there and he named two boys amen I think Josh you might have been one of them he wasn't he named two boys one was signs and one was wonders amen and he says now listen you all follow me I'm the believer and brother Danny just took off walking you know and he never stopped brother Joel and had a prayer meeting and said oh dear lord is signs and wonders with me he never made sure they was there wherever he walked signs and wonders went with him because he was the word and you can't separate the word from the Spirit come on church I love this he said if I speed up signs and wonder speed up he said if I slow down signs and wonders slow down this is the one I loved he said if I he walked off the room in a closet he said if I go in a dark place he said signs and wonders go with me I do not question I do not check I am a believer and as a Believer they are commissioned to follow me well come on CHR Tabernacle you are a Mark 16 Church you will lay hands on the sick and they will recover you will cast out Devils listen there will never be psychology take the place of the Holy Ghost in the church of living God we are a mark 16th church and we believe from verse one to the final verse is inspired We Are Holy Ghost filled word believer and signs and wonders are following the believer well somebody shout hallelujah somebody make that nervous devil nervous somebody make that anxiety devil flee signs and wonders follow the believer Devils can't stay I said Devils can't stay Spirits can't stay confusion can't stay this is a word church who's been birthed by the word of God now I'm running out of time but the pr of God said there was a woman one time was in a was in a home and she got real sick and her son he was overseas studying to be a theologian and she needed some prayer but he couldn't get home in time she was dying so he just went on about his business when he come home brother Joe his mom was sitting there healed she was

from the ninth verse on it's not even inspired she said oh dear Lord you know what she did brother Tim she kind of shouted a little bit she got a little happy you know and he said oh no Mama no you're not only believing like them you're acting like them that's a good preaching Point well don't expect me to believe the word and not act like the word don't expect me to preach Mark 16 and not act like Mark 16 don't expect me to believe a seven seal message and a third full anointing and act like a halfway believer I am a holy ghost filled fire baptized message of the hour preaching Piller of fire anointed Son of God and the only actions I can demonstrate is the ones that's in the word it's who I am it's who you are I act like the word I sing like the word I preach like the word I shout like the word I believe like the word I dance like the word because I am a word born child of God well somebody give me some shout room in the house of God I am a word born son of the Living God when the wind begins to blow Mama calm down Cal down you're acting like them she said Woo calm down mama do you know from Mark 16 the 9th verse on is uninspired do you know it's a false witness it was put in there brother Vernon by a false witness she said Woo if God can heal me y'all know what I'm talking about if God can heal me with uninspired word then what can he do with that which is really inspired Well church a living God if he could save you if he could heal you if he could deliver you then you better believe some morning he's going to sweep one more time and by the same word that saved you and the same word that delivered you and the same word that healed you that word's going to change your body in the moment in the twinkle of an eye the old is going to become young and our loved ones are going to appear and we're going to be changed I'm not talking about something that's sour I'm not talking about something that's stale I'm talking about something that's alive this message is alive brother it's alive it's alive I said it's alive it's a living it's a breathing it's a changing it's a saving it's healing it's turning things around it's bringing the walls down it's opening the Red Sea things are changing church right here in this area tonight things are changing by the word of God I say yield yourself move yourself out and let the word move in let the word move in until it changes your habits and it changes your nature and it changes your attitude let's a word move in it'll deliver you I said things are changing this building tonight things are changing the devil's winds being bound I said the devil's contrary winds are being bound brother Wayne they're being bound they're losing they're losing their ability to blow on the church because there's a stronger wind there's a stronger wind and it's in the Church of the Living God and it's blowing out everything now the Bible says that Satan got in the Wind on the sea that night I'm going to close on these points and the wind was contrary said Satan began to push out his poisonous breath and begin to blow his Winds of stri breaking churches apart separating Brotherhood making people think they're a little better than somebody else belong in a better bracket belong in a church he said there's only one Church there's only one church and I salute you Matt mois I salute Grace Tabernacle for lifting up a gospel it says there's one church with one motive and one objective and that's to see Souls born under the anointing of this message I thank you for being a lighthouse it'll say somewhere down the diry dirty Roes is a place where sinner can be saved somewhere there's a place where drunk can be delivered somewhere there's a place where a father can become a father again somewhere the Dynamics is mixing with the mechanics and there's a Wind of Change coming across the church we Rejoice for the wind of God we praise him for the Breath of God as it begins to blow it begins to bring change as the wind of God begins to blow it begins to bring change I said it begins to bring change I said it begins to bring change it begins to bring change I said it begins to bring change no I'm not a broken record I'm pushing against the devil right now it begins to bring change brother Kobe it begins to bring change when the wind of God breaks out it begins to bring change Hallelujah I'm talking about the wind of God you realize how powerful the wind of God is it can pick things up and move them are y'all hearing me last year after our tent meeting we finished up putting some chairs together and we packed the chairs together brother Luke you know about this packed all the chairs up and we laid them up against poles you know waiting till the next day to put them up and that night there was a gust of wind come off a hill Bo underneath that 10 and Brother David Paul I'm talking about a poll about this big you know what it did it the wind picked it up and the chairs fell over and the pole was landing on the chairs and there's a sermon right there I said there's a sermon right there there's some devils that's leaning on you there's some devils been lingering around you there's some Spirits been lingering around your mind been lingering around your confession been and they've been leaning on you you can't praise like you want to you can't worship like you want to cuz them old devils are propped up against you you but can I say tonight there is a mighty rushing wind of the Holy Ghost blowing in this building tonight and it's knocking down every sickness it's knocking down every problem listen the devil oh them Devils that's leaned on you tonight won't you put your foot on them won't you put your foot on them won't you put your foot on that devil put your foot on that depression put your foot on that nervousness put your foot on that habit put your foot on that thing by the Wind of Change that's blowing in the house of God devil you've ruled long enough we're going to put our foot on it amen you've told us long enough we're not going to make it but tonight there's a change and this wind is no Hallelujah this wind is changing our dress it's changing places we go it's changing music we listen to it's changing things we say it's the wind of God I close by saying this I close by saying this whatever say to blows on he's trying to sink it whenever go whenever Satan blows on something brother Wayne he's trying to sink it but whenever God breathes on something whenever God breathes on something he's trying to raise it up I said he's trying to raise it up I said he's trying to raise it up come on Church the devil's bowing on you cuz he's trying to sink you but God is bowing the breath of his word on you because there's a new testament church and it's rising up we're not getting weaker we're getting stronger we're not defeated we're Overcomers there's a wind of God there's a wind of God and when it begins to blow when it begins to blow things begin to change don't say when he begins to breathe things begin to change can I can I leave you at this tonight what happens in the natural is happening in the spiritual God has cleaned the air up in the church do you realize in n in in in the in America in the United States of America there's something called the Clean Air Act the United States started this and their intention was to reduce and control air population it was an act to improve and strengthen and accelerate programs for the prevention and abandonment of air pollution brother Wayne I got to looking at this and you know the year that that was enacted was 1963 in other words when America is nationally wide trying to stop air pollution in the natural a prophet receives an open book and begins to reveal the Mysteries and begins to improve the air quality in the church and you go from breathing in polluted denominational stagnated air that chokes you and you can't believe in healing and you can't believe in miracles and you can't believe in the Supernatural till a prophet opened the word and he put a filter in the church he put an air filter in the church and he said now if it's not in the word don't worry about it put it out of the church he clean the pollution up in the church he cleaned the pollution up in the church he he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost why don't you to stand to your feet with us tonight he breathed on them look at this word breathe it means to blow or breathe upon where Jesus after the manner of the Hebrew prophets expressed by the symbolic Act of breathing upon the apostles the communication of the power of the I got here too late of the power of the spirit G of the Holy Spirit giv them this word was only used by the by the translators Genesis 27 when God breathed on Adam and he became a living soul but watch this just as the original creation was completed by an act of God so to the new creation was to be completed by an act from the head of the new creation he said see he's created his bride not to a denomination but by the word he said see he was the head of the new race he's the head of the new creation can I can I leave you with this tonight and a prophet turns and says now the breath and the spirit has become the same and she's uniting together bringing forth the same powerful bow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there is manifesting the same Works John 14:12 that he did back there is being manifested right today the same thing oh Lord not you that speaketh he says but the father that dwelleth in you he doeth a talking it's not you talking to that mountain it's the father that's in you speaking to that mountain it has to move can I say what he said she's bone of his bone she's life of his life she's power of his power prophet of God stood and said I challenge you to believe that the son of man is revealed in human flesh through the bride's body she is him she's him oh I see a I see a valley it's a valley of dry bones brother Wendell can they live again Lord can these bones live again Lord thou knowest son of man prophesy oh God Son of Man prophesy brother Tim I remember you preached it years ago I was a little boy listening to it thou must prophesy again somebody's going to eat this book and prophesy again and when he stood there he began to he begin to look at those bones and brother Vernon let's just say it like this there was a Vernon and a Robbie in that Valley and Vernon had a backbone and Robbie had a backbone and Vernon had a kneebone and Robbie had a knee bone amen and when the when the bones were laying there no doubt Them Bones had all been scattered they had all been scattered but he said Can these bones live again he said Son of Man prophesy and as he began to speak sen you came and muscle came and flesh came but there was still no life he said but prophesy to the Four Winds and let them come in those bones and when he began to prophesy the Bible said bone went to his bone in other words brother Robbie you didn't get brother Vernon's backbone and he didn't get your your ankle bone every bone went back to a trap are you hearing me and the only thing that can bring you back is the fourth stage when the wind of God the divine presence begins to cap off the pyramid it will stand again the tree will grow again what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the re restoration has come the wind of God has blowed the power of God is in the church can I say this to you we which are alive and remain look at this word alive to be fresh to be strong to be powerful what are you saying brother Andrew brother said Jonah in the belly of the whale he said Jonah needed some oxygen he said he just breathed normally for three days and took a nice little rest he could take his 40 days journey across the wicked City he got all freshened up with some new oxygen Out of Heaven he got all freshened up it couldn't come out of a whale it couldn't come out of the sea had to come from God can I can I pray a prophet's prayer over you tonight oh breathe on us tonight Lord that the oxygen of the word of God in the power of

carbon gets on the lamp Wicked it'll smoke your lamp all up that's what's the matter with us we got too much carbon on the lamp the fire can't draw right it can't get enough air from the bottom but what we need is a good breathing spell a good breath of fresh air from Heaven to the baptism of the Holy Ghost over again and the Holy Spirit working in the church with signs and wonders following the true seal of God I don't know how many will get it he says but there'll be some of them will trim their lamps for it's lamp trimming time and it's on tonight and you say tonight Lord trim my lamp I
