I believe he's if he's done something for you, won't you just praise him a little while? Has God been good to you? Just give him a Just give him a good ovation. Say, "Lord, I thank you for what you've done for me. I thank you for waking me up this morning, giving me a a heart to be able to believe. I believe he's worthy of it this morning.

Every moment we could spend praising God. We never praise him enough. You love the Lord this morning, somebody turn around to somebody and say, "God is good." &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. We just love the Lord. Want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus. Want to [music] remember those that are gone uh this morning in need of prayer. Also, uh, Brother David Hoffman and his wife, both sick, ask for the church to remember them in prayer this morning. If you have a need on your heart, just maybe just lift your hand to the Lord. And I know God is mindful of all that we have need of. And we just want to invite the Holy Spirit to come into the service and minister to our hearts. Amen. That when we leave this place that we're closer to God than we ever were. How many say that's your prayer this morning? Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Won't each one just pray in your own way? Gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we love you, Lord. And God, we're so thankful for an opportunity to stand and to be able to speak these words of eternal life, Lord, knowing the value of the word that lays before us, Lord, and the Lord, the responsibility of this moment, Lord, of believers gathering in a building. Lord, I pray that it's something that never grows common to us. But Lord, what a great moment it is, Lord, to be able to stand in your presence, Lord, to be able to worship you, Lord, and to give you back the honor that uh what little that we have to offer you, Lord. And God, we count it as a privilege to serve you and to know you as a God and Lord, as a healer and a savior and all the mighty things that you've done for us. And Lord, we just ask you this morning, Lord, that you [music] would come down among your people. And Lord, that you would minister to every heart, Lord. I pray, Lord, you would drive every spirit out of this building, Lord, that don't belong. Lord, anything that would be here, Lord, that maybe has been tormenting somebody, Lord, that would come to hinder them from being able to receive something from you. But Lord, I just ask you this morning, the merciful God that you are, Lord, that you would move in every heart, in every life. Lord, I pray that there wouldn't be one person that would miss anything that you would have for on this morning. Lord, may the blessings of God fall upon every life, Lord. But I pray you would heal those that are sick, Lord. You would anoint this word to the hearers, Lord. We pray in Jesus name. [music] And the church says, "Amen." You love the Lord this morning. Amen. We just want to invite you to the scripture to John the 4th chapter. And we're going to read out of the 19th verse. John 4 and 19th verse. We'll read down to the 24th verse. Amen. How many feels good being in the house of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Cold outside and maybe just warm in here and just to come fellowship around the word. And I don't I know I know I say it a lot, but I just love the word of God. Amen. there. Uh it don't matter what I've ever gone through in my life. Uh any any major uh trial or any major decision uh there's none of it that I've ever gotten through without uh the word of God. Amen. So it's always been a guide to us. I want to read John the 4th chapter 19th verse. The Bible says the woman you it's a very familiar story. The woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain. And you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. But Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father. For you worship, you know not what. We know what we worship. For salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. And we'll just ask the Lord to add his blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats this morning. I'd like to speak on this subject on the God of our fathers. The God of our fathers. How many knows that a god is an object of worship? &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly it's an object of worship. In other words, it's a an object or a person uh that you would give an expression of reverence to or a feeling or expression of reverence to someone or something. As believers, we are accustomed to worship. We live in a world uh that universally accepts spiritual things. The the world that we live in I I know sometimes we we think this the opposite way but in reality uh the world that we live in believes in the existence of a god or a higher power. Matter of fact nearly 90% of the world uh claims to believe in spiritual things or a higher power or a deity. Uh uh they believe in that. most uh only a small minority of the people on the earth uh don't believe in a god or a spiritual thing. There there's very few that don't believe uh in a god in some way. Uh in fact, if you study history, you'll find that uh uh many of the greatest wars that were ever fought in history uh was to answer the question of not is there a god, but what is the true god? Who who is this god, this creator? Countless millions of people have lost their lives uh trying to answer that very question, fighting over that very question. And brother Mark Studia uh studies history and it's always uh uh been a a battle to answer that question. We were created but by whom? And the world was made but by whom? And uh many questions have have uh uh risen over uh that very subject. Who is God? And how must I worship God? And what is the true God? many millions and millions of gods uh that are upon this earth and and uh you know I realize that we don't uh uh that that that our nature that that our nature is to worship God it's it's our the nature of a human being is to worship something it's to idolize it it don't matter even those that don't serve God and uh many in the in the in the world even in our our country uh they don't serve God but they'll claim to believe in God how many knows that I mean there's millions that'll say well I believe in God if If you took a poll, 90% they believe in a god, but maybe they just don't serve God. They uh they they serve the world. They don't go to church. They don't serve God in any way. Uh but if you would ask them, they would say they believed in God. And uh but but our nature shows us that we are we are worshippers or we we idolize things. Um uh it doesn't matter what it is. In fact, if you um look around our society and the and the great things in the social part of of the United States, you'll know that that we idolize uh people. We idolize uh singers. We idolize musicians. We idolize uh athletes, actors and actresses. And uh uh in so much that it's so such in our nature to worship that uh that that you'll notice games were where thousands and hundreds of thousands of people and uh hands raised and my get into the spirit of something so great uh and would about knock each other down if one of the athletes off the field would just so happen to walk by their car when they left out of the stadium. I mean it they couldn't even get to their car. They had to have security guards around them everywhere they go because they're so idolized by people because it's in our nature to idolize things. It's our in in other words that's the that's the inherent part of your life that as a worshipper causes you to idolize people and idolize it ain't just in sports. It ain't just in music but even in religion. Uh brother Bam said if we could get the superstitions of the world how they worship they want to become good uh even certain denominations and they're they think that if a man becomes real good he becomes a god to the people and then the people worship him as a god that they they even even the great ministers and and even in brother Bram's ministries the same way that there would be so much fanaticism around his ministry of those that would worship a great man of God as a god because it's in our nature to worship something. It's in our nature to idolize and and to worship or or to uh to have reverence to something. And and so so so we realize that that we didn't that that we worship automatically. We're going to worship something. We're going to worship somebody. Even those that don't believe in God and you know don't but they still out and they're worshiping something because it's in our nature. We were created that way. But but when we come to church this morning, brother Mark, we didn't come to worship a man, but we come to worship God. How many say amen? So we worshiped him in singing. We worshiped him in prayer. We worshiped him in our holiness, in our in our sacrifice. We wor we made our bodies a living sacrifice to come to the house of God. And brother Bam said, "Now that we've worshiped the Lord, we'll continue to worship him." He says, "See, so we worshiped him singing. We worshiped him in in praise. But now let's worship him as a cutting sharp two-edged sword as it moves through us to find out where we're standing." And here a prophet of God would show us that worship is not only just praising God in a song service. It's not only just lifting our hands, but even while we're hearing the word of God going forth, that we can worship God and entertain God, the spirit of God as he's moving through our lives to find out where it is that we're standing. See, see, worship has always been a part of our life. It's always been a part of who we are. It's not a new thing. &gt;&gt; It's not a foreign thing. Even uh before the world has ever began, God was alone with his thoughts. Remember in the beginning, he was that great spirit. He wasn't even a god because a god has to have something to worship him. But he he was an eternal one. He had nothing to worship him. There was no one there, no angels, nothing. It was just God alone. But brother said, but then in order for him to be a god, there had to be something to worship him. So he created angels and beings and cherubams to worship him. And then God's great plan began to unfold. So here they was created, brother Mark. And as they were created, they were created with the with the purpose of worshiping God. But how many knows this that whenever God created man, he created man with that same ability. How many knows that he created that man that you have that same uh purpose in you? There's a calling in you that calls you back to God. He created us with a desire to worship God. That's why it makes you feel so good to get out of this world and and come into a church service and and and to hear music and begin to lift your hands and close your eyes and and give worship to your God is because because you were made to do that. It's something that's satisfying to you. It settles the things of the world and those things that you question and all the problems that are going on on the outside. But when you can come into an atmosphere of worship and just worship God and forget about the confusion and the fights between this one and that one and this church and that church and all these things that that Satan builds up in our mind, he's trying to keep you out of that atmosphere of worship because that's where you find peace and that's where you find answers and that's where you you grow in God and and so the atmosphere is created that the word can come forth and and the whole thing is interacting with God in worship. See, it's always been here. And God God made that for us, brother Mah, to be a part of worship, even in the mind of God. Uh, you realize that we were we were worshiping God. And while the Bible says while God created, you realize while the the foundations of the earth were being laid, the Bible says the sons of God were shouting for joy at at seeing the foundation of the earth being laid. They shouted for joy. at seeing God's plan to come out of the mind of God and begin uh and to begin to to be laid as a as a foundation upon the world. And here that those sons of God back there saw the plan of God as they were there in the mind of God. And as God began to lay that plan out upon the earth, something inside them begin to shout and to praise God because they saw God's great eternal plan. And do you realize that that we always belong to God? If you were, if your name's written in the lamb's book of life, God is an eternal God. He predestinated you by his fornowledge. You were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. Even Jesus was in the mind of God. It was his plan all along. Even when he wasn't born, brother Bam said, "But God slayed him before the foundation of the world in his own mind." And when that so whenever he came to the earth, the work had already been done in the mind of God before God ever created before he said, "Let there be light." before he created the earth in the mind of God, the whole plan of God had already unfolded. He's an eternal God. He knew how nothing ever caught God offguard. He He knew what was going to take place. And and even you and I, we may not have been there. We may not have been born. We weren't there in the natural, but Ram said, "I wasn't there. Neither was you there. But but if our name was in the lamb's book of life, then our names are over there. It was put on there before the foundation of the world. We may not have been there in person, but before the foundation of the world, we were there in spirit. God knew us in the mind of God. And see, so, but when God created us, he didn't want us to be like angels. He He God had enough angels. Can I just say it like that? Just some plain Arkansas talk. But God had enough angels that just worshiped God because they had to. He had enough that was created by the thousands that that just worship God and stay before the throne of God, constantly worshiping God. But God wanted a man that had free will, a man that would worship him and choose uh that and desire to worship God and by choice he would go and he would worship his maker and worship his creator. You know, because Satan that that Lucifer that that that old devil had made it in such a way that that that that nobody the only reason that the angels worship God is because he forced them to do it. And and if you ever give me a shot at them, they wouldn't they wouldn't worship you no more. So God created man and gave man a free will. Gave us a free choice. The Bible says he or or brother said he created Eve knowing that she would fall. But still yet he gave her a choice. And when she came to this earth by choice because of the fall in the garden, it brought death upon upon mankind. But but after the fall of God, notice what God done is he came into the garden. He slew a lamb in the garden. and the lamb that altar of sacrifice where the lamb was slain became a place of worship between God and man. So here he introduces a place to worship God. It was a it was an altar of sacrifice who of course you know uh the history of of Cain and Abel and how uh that they had came as brothers and they were both taught how to worship God and how to bring a sacrifice unto God and and so so that's what would cause the uh the disagreement between the brothers is because one would bring the flowers and and and the fruits of his labor but the other would bring a lamb and he would slay the lamb and and do it exactly just as God had done because what They laid up on the altar, brother Mark, it was an act of worship. They were just trying to fulfill what was on the inside of them to be a worshshiper. That's why Cain, although his worship wasn't the right kind of worship, but there was something on the inside of him that caused him to want to worship because we are created that way. We're made to with a desire to worship where there's something in us that causes us to want to worship something. So see after it became a a a place of sacrifice, it became a law of God to go to the altar of sacrifice and to bring worship unto God. So but before the people could worship God, there had to be sacrifices made. So when they would come to worship God all through the the Old Testament as the laws of God, when they would come to worship, they would have to sanctify the altar and and then the and sanctify it and cleanse it with a burnt offering in order to sanctify the place of their worship. And so they would come in, remember that was the order God gave to Moses. Before they come and lay anything upon the altar, first you come and cleanse the altar so that everything that's laid upon it would be accepted by God. I I thought, isn't that a wonderful instruction in the Old Testament, and it still applies today, that a sanctified altar is the place that you can lay a sacrifice on, and God will accept your sacrifice. Because I I I don't know about you, but but there ain't none of us that want to worship a God that won't hear our worship. No. Nobody wants to worship a god that won't that won't accept your sacrifice. How many how many wants to come and serve God and God not accept your your serving? But our desire to worship is a desire to have a personal relationship with God. Somebody say amen. Our desire to worship is a desire to have communion. It's a it's a desire to fellowship. It's a a desire that our that our sacrifice would be a sweet smelling savor. It would be accepted by God. it would it would be a delight in the in the in the in the in the mind of God or in the heart of God that our worship would be a delight unto God. &gt;&gt; So here it's our desire to worship &gt;&gt; and it's not only our desire to worship but it's desire to worship our God. &gt;&gt; So here when we open this scripture in John the 4th chapter we realize that these Samaritans were a a a special class of people. The Samaritans, they believed in the patriarchs of the Bible or the fathers of the Bible. They believed Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of course, being the the patriarchs. And actually, in their teaching, in the Samaritan teaching, they're still Samaritans today. In the Samaritan teaching, they keep the they kept the patriarchal law or the Mosaic covenant, they believed to keep it. And in in fact, they have their own Torah outside of the Hebrew Torah. In the Samaritan Torah, they believe it to be the original unchanged version of the pench that came uh uh from Moses uh to the Israelites on Mount Si. They believe they actually have the original uh in their possession of the Samaritan people uh for for hundreds and even thousands of years. They have what's called the Aisha scroll. The Aisha scroll was written by uh the son of Aaron, the one of the priests. It was the son of Aaron, the high priest. And and they believe that this scroll is the oldest actual scroll that ever existed. It was a 3,000-y old scroll. Of course, the Christians and the Jews have tried to disprove that and to none avail to the Samaritans. But but but they they they so believe in in in where they are and what they and and the God uh the patriarchs of the Bible and who God is and their connection with God and and and they believe that the summit of Mount Jerism, it's right in Samaria, is right where the Mount Jerism is. And they believe it to be the true location of God's holy place. And so they believe this is the place they actually can trace their history uh that soon after the Israelites entered into the promised land that by Samaritan history that that there was a division among the high priest Eli and then the and then the the high priest Uzi which is in 1 Chronicles the the I believe it's the sixth chapter you can read the descendants of Aaron the high priest but maybe the fourth generation down from Aaron was the high priest uzi and so here the Samaritan people would actually tell you that that that Eli, which was a which became a wealthy priest, and he he was he was a he was a reckless priest. And they would say that he would he went down to the altar and and and there was a division between him and and the and Uzzie the the the the high priest and and that that whenever he would go down to the altar, he he left he left such a a division that the Israelite leader cast him away or or b or or rebuked him and he went into shallow and formed what we know now as Jerusalem or Judah. And so it was a division of the people of God that caused all of this. And so you say, "Well, what was the division about?" I'm just telling you some Samaritan history, but the division they they would say is because that Eli offered a sacrifice, but his sacrifice was offered without salt. And so, in other words, he was inattentive to the sacrifice. He wasn't uh he he was reckless in his sacrifice. And here as a of course if you study in that history of time uh there was two priests that that God had actually taken their life because of the way that they sacrificed them because they were reckless and they they were doing things in the church with you know with you know with with women and money and all these things in the church. And so God actually took their life and then the same the same angel of death actually visited their father who was a high priest. And so so so there was many things that went on in the priesthood that so so in in all of this time period the Samaritans said there was a great division and that he that Eli made a sacrifice but he didn't use salt and so when the great high priest uzi heard of it he found the sacrifice wasn't accepted by God and he disowned him and rebuked him. But those that sympathize with Eli when he went to Shiloh they formed what today is Judah or Israel be because they they there was a great division among the people. And so you realize that th that this is a this is the Samaritan history. They they believe in this place and they believe in the mountain. There was a great division and no doubt we have no way of knowing exactly what took place. But in that history there was certainly something that divided people. And so uh maybe maybe it was that may or or what it was. We don't really know uh all the things. They try to prove it and find history. But uh but but we know there was something that caused such division. But but this is what the Samaritans believe. This is what they believe took place. And so this is what actually caused or or the conversation at Jacob's well to turn to worship. So here was a woman that was a Samaritan and had a different background than the Jews. So here she sat on Jacob's well under the shadow of Mount Jerism. Now now according to their tradition as she was raised her whole life uh and taught there was such a segregation between the Samaritans and Jews because there was a division in the priesthood. They they had kept their belief. They had kept and the and the Israel had kept their belief but they actually believe that Mount Jerism is the oldest and most central mountain in the world. They believe that Mount Jerism is the place that the only place that stood above the great flood when the when the earth was flooded in the days of Noah. They believe that the the uh that the ark of Noah landed at Mount Jerism. They believe that the Mount Jerism was the holy place. They believe it was where Abraham took Isaac when he laid him and and would take him to sacrifice Isaac. they uh instead of what the Jews believe that it was on Mount Mariah, the Samaritans believe that Mount Jerism is the place of God or where the holy temple was rather than Jerusalem's temple mount. They they they they as much as the Jews believe that God that the temple mount was a holy temple, that's how much the Samaritans believe that Mount Jerisum was a place of the holy temple. in fact in so much that for 300 years they had a great temple built upon Mount Jerism just a few hundred years before Jesus came to the earth and so this was a great thing to them even to this day three times a year the Samaritans actually ascend up that mountain on the at the Passover shabbat and suck up they they go up that mountain they make that journey every year under that holy under that holy place with God and so it is a it is a great holy place this was the division between the Samaritan and the Jews is the Jews had a holy temple on a holy mountain in Jerusalem. They believed that that what happened on Mount Mariah is where Abraham took his son. And here on the other side is the Samaritans saying, "No, it wasn't on your mountain. It was on our mountain. It was on Mount Jerism that it took place and y'all robbed us of it and you went and built your own temple and you started your own religion and you took our God and you took our uh the God of our fathers and you took them somewhere else and you tried to form some some other thing." So there was a great division and segregation among the Samaritan and among the Jews. So here at the at Jacob's well sets a Jew and a Samaritan having a conversation. And to even think of of of having a a religious conversation is immediately going to bring division because this is how the Samaritan and the Jew was raised. But the Bible said that Jesus being wearied with his journey, he sat on the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said to her, "Give me to drink." She said, "Well, how is it that you being a Jew asked me which a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans, but Jesus said, if you knew the gift of God, who that said to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water." And the woman said, "Well, I you have nothing to draw with." And the well is deep. So when where do you have this living water? Now notice where she turns this because because she's been taught by the tradition of her fathers, she says, or and whence do you have that living water? And are you greater than our father Jacob that gave us this well and drink hereof himself and his children and his cattle? See, they were firm believers in their forefathers and the patriarchs of the Bible. And so and so Jesus said, "Well, whosoever drink of this water would thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I would give him would never thirst, but the water that I will give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." Now notice what the woman does. She says to him, "Sir, give me of this water that I thirst not, and neither have to come back to this well to draw." See immediately she shows us something is that she wanted something greater than the tradition of her fathers. Her first word was said are you greater than our father Jacob? Are are you greater than the tradition of our fathers? Or is there something better about you than Jacob? Jacob made this well and Jacob's family drank from this well and Jacob's children drank from this well and Jacob's cattle drank from this well. Are you greater than he? But then whenever whenever he tells her about another well and a water that's springing up that could give everlasting life, she said, "I you know I mean my my the tradition of my fathers maybe maybe it wouldn't bring me it. It it don't promise something like that." But she turns from that tradition and shows that there's something greater in her than just following after the tradition of her fathers or the people that she was raised by. And so here when she asked for that, give me a drink of this. What did Jesus do? The Bible says he told her all the things that she had ever done. He told her about her life. He told her about her past. He told her about her history. He told her about her her family problems, her problems growing up, problems with her daddy, problems with her mama. She said, "He told me all the things that I'd ever done, all the mistakes, all the wrongdoings. He sat on that well and discerned her entire life. And he told her about her life." And as he began to tell her about her life, she said, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet." So, she recognized him as a prophet of God. And so, just and so and because she recognized him as a prophet, notice where she takes this because they're not talking about this subject. But because she recognized him as a prophet here in her heart, she begins to think maybe, just maybe, he can answer the question that has troubled all of our people this whole time. So, here she said, "I perceive that thou art a prophet." And then notice where she goes. She says, "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place that men ought to worship." I thought, "Isn't that of all the things that you could ask a prophet of God?" Of all the questions that you could ask them, what can I do to make my life? What can I do to have eternal life? What all the questions that we could ask, if we recognize that the prophet of God was setting before us of all the things she could ask, it was the greatest question that she knew to ask. Y'all say worship in this mountain. It was the greatest division. Yeah, it was the problem between all of the fathers of both nations. It's what caused the segregation. And that was the question that she asked him. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, but you say that men ought to worship in that mountain. But Jesus said unto her, he said,"Woman, believe me that the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father." Friends, there was a woman that sat at the well that had a desire to worship God. And she didn't want to be wrong. She had heard what the Samaritans said about it and she heard what the Jews said about it. She had heard enough division between Jerism and the and the Temple Mount. She she had heard enough people argue about it and enough people bicker about it and enough people fight and say, "No, this is how you worship God. That's how you worship God and this is how you have church and that's how you conduct service." And she had heard so much about it that she that that she was just torn to pieces of hearing about it. But when she got in the presence of a prophet of God, she said, "I perceive that thou art a prophet. And if you're a prophet of God, you must have THE ANSWER. AND HOW IS IT THAT I MUST WORSHIP GOD? MUST I WORSHIP AT THE TEMPLE of Jerusalem, or must I worship at the temple of Jerusalem?" But Jesus said, "Believe me, neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem do you worship the Father. For you worship, you know not what, but we know what we worship. For salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is. Somebody say, "Now is." That when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the worshipper seeketh such to worship him for or the father seeketh such to worship him. For God is a spirit. Somebody say, "A spirit." &gt;&gt; And they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; The woman said, "I know the Messiah cometh, which is called Christ, and when he comes, he will tell us all things." And Jesus said, "I that speak unto thee am he." You know what the Bible says? The woman left her water pot. She went into the village, into the city, and she said, "Come and see a man that told me all the things that I've ever done." Let me tell you what he told her. He told her how to get back past her problems. He told her how to get past her past. He told her how to get past all the traditions of her of her fathers. And he told her how that she could really have a relationship with God. He told her how to satisfy that longing in her heart to worship God and that real desire for true worship. And he answered the very question that she had in her heart. I want to be a true worshipper. I want Oh, you think friends that if he didn't know everything that had took place in her life that he didn't know what she was really asking when she asked about the mountain, he said that that God is a spirit and they that worship him. He answered a question that she didn't even ask. If you really want to worship God, the only way to worship him is to worship HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT MOUNTAIN OR THAT NATION or the FIGHT OR THE FEW BETWEEN THIS AND or the other. BUT JUST GET ALONE WITH GOD AND WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT CHURCH YOU GO TO. I DON'T CARE WHO YOUR PASTOR IS. I DON'T CARE WHAT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS ONE OR THAT ONE. BUT WE AIN'T WORSHIPING ON THAT MOUNTAIN OR THIS mountain or this church OR THAT CHURCH. GOD DON'T CALL US TO A PLACE LIKE THAT JUST TO WORSHIP GOD. HE SAID, "BUT NOW IS THE TIME that God is a spirit AND THEY THAT WORSHIP HIM MUST WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT, HAND in truth." &gt;&gt; And brother Noah, she caught a revelation of true worship. And it went beyond the traditions of her fathers that the Messiah, you know what the traditions of her father? The Messiah was going to come and restore the temple of Jerusalem. That's what the Samaritans believe. But when she saw the Messa sign, it wasn't pointing to Mount Jerism. It wasn't pointing to the Temple Mount. It was pointing to a holy mountain. A holy Hallelujah. It was pointing to a holy God, a holy mountain, a temple that was not made by man's hands. &gt;&gt; You worship a God that you know not what. Even around the world, he said, "See, God is a spirit." Around the world, there's many that worship things. But you notice most people worship things that they can see. &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus is answering. God is a spirit. In Africa, there's actually most of South Africa, some of the great uh religions would say that you worship a God that you worship a God as Christians that's a force that you can't see. And we have to have something in order to worship it. I've got to see it to believe it. I've got to see it to worship it. How many knows what that is? If I got to see it to worship it, it's idolatry. I have to see it to worship it. I I But and you Christians, y'all worship something that's just a force in the wind. You're worshiping a spirit. But but don't you realize that's what Jesus said? He said God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. And brother Bam said, "And they are led by the same spirit." Friends, let me take a while on that. Are you hearing me? Does somebody hear that? He said, "You worship him in spirit and in truth, and you're led by the same spirit." That means that you are led by the spirit that you worship. Hello, somebody. So, if you worship a spirit of error, it's going to lead you into error. If you worship a spirit of truth, it'll lead you into truth. Isn't that what happened with Moses? Moses was a man of God that was led by the spirit of God. But do you realize there was a time in Moses's life he was not led by God because it wasn't the spirit of God that he was worshiping. But there was a time he wanted to lead himself. And he got all the way down there in Egypt and he saw the condition of his people. and he saw that that old uh taskmaster whooping uh uh one of the the the Israelites and because he's a military mind. He was a great man and he was taught in the military. He went to to try try to set everything in order. Brother said see he he thought he could get go out and do it right himself but he found himself a failure. He said because every tech technique he started was wrong. He slew a man because that's what the military taught him is to go kill somebody if they're doing something wrong. So he went out on his military education. and he slew a man and it caused him, what's the result of his slaying? It caused him to be a stranger to his brethren for 40 years. He said, "But one day an old shepherd, he was walking out on the backside of a desert in the at the end of that 40 years and the first thing you know, he came into the presence of God and when he did, the Holy Ghost got a got a fire bush there and he told Moses more about his leading in five minutes than all the years of training that he ever had. And he had to take that military out of him and put a real genuine Holy Spirit in him so that he could be led by the spirit of God. So see, he had to take that that old worship and that old he had been raised up with those those those Egyptian gods and and and you know, you say maybe Moses was a great man and he wouldn't worship those gods, but he still had his studies and he still depended on his military and his training and all all of that. And because he was so into that, whenever he saw an opportunity, he slew a man. But you realize it wasn't the spirit of God that was leading him. He said, "But God had to come and take that out of him and put a real genuine Holy Spirit in him." So somebody say, "Amen." He had to put a real genuine Holy Spirit in him so that he could be led by the spirit. So you know what that tells me? That depending on the spirit you follow, it will determine the result in your life. It'll determine the result of every situation, every every question you have you need an answer to. So, in other words, brother Mark, you can't follow a bad spirit and expect a good result. Hello, somebody. You can't follow a bad spirit and expect a good result, BUT YOU HAVE TO worship the right spirit. And that spirit you worship is what's leading you. And it will bring you to a desired result. Oh, friend, can I can I just preach a minute? Sometimes you see people and there's something wrong with their body. Maybe there's a sickness, but if you aren't careful, you you'll find yourself worshiping the spirit of the sickness. I I I I get to hear uh brother Ron tell his testimony uh so many times that he was diagnosed with cancer and and and and terrible cancer all over his body many uh months ago that he was supposed to he was supposed to die. But you know what? You'll never find him doing I've never one time found him worshiping the spirit of that cancer. You know what? And because he's not worshiping that spirit, then that spirit's not leading him. And so every time he talks about he says, "God is good and I'll live as long as God wants me to live. And when God's done with me on this earth, then God's going to take me off this earth." How can a man say that when his body's filled with cancer is because he's not worshiping the spirit of cancer, but he's worshiping the spirit of God and he's led by the spirit that he is worshiping. AND SO HERE WE FIND OURSELVES SO MANY TIMES GETTING CAUGHT up under a spirit and maybe it's a sickness or something and we get so negative or the spirit oh I'm going to get in trouble but it's let me just oh let me just help you out this morning. But when YOU WORSHIP THAT SPIRIT all of a sudden that's what's leading your whole entire life and you get so negative and down. I got a problem I can't get over. And if you knew what I was going through, why you wouldn't feel that way towards me and maybe nobody even feels bad. But in your mind, they do because you're being led by the spirit. You worship. AND BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN CAUGHT UP BY THAT spirit of negativity, and I'm never going to be well, and and this is just the way I am, and this is just the problem of my life, and this is my sickness, and this is my problem, and these ARE MY FEELINGS. OH, IF YOU FELT LIKE I DO, IF YOU KNEW WHAT I went through, OH, I'M SO MISTREATED. THERE AIN'T NOBODY LIKE ME. UH, BUT FRIENDS, CAN I JUST SAY THIS THIS MORNING that we are Christians. How many Christians are there? We're Christians. And I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE AS CHRISTIANS handle our problems like Christians instead of like pagans do. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. We're Christians. And Christians don't handle things like pagans handle things. Christians aren't supposed to be led by the spirit of fear. We ain't supposed TO BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF CONFUSION. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF A SICKNESS OR AN AILMENT, BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THE BIBLE SAYS, "SONS OF GOD ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD." &gt;&gt; Not to be led by the spirit, some sickness. No wonder people are down. Get the negativity out OF YOUR HOUSE AND WATCH healing come to your body. Get the negative, friends. I'm just giving you some help this morning. But if you'll TAKE THE NEGATIVITY OUT, HOW CAN GOD EVEN HEAL YOU? If it's all about negative and all about how bad it is and how worse IT IS AND HOW I GOT IT WORSE THAN ANYBODY ELSE. AIN'T NOBODY EVER FELT LIKE I FELT. AIN'T NOBODY that that's been mistreated like I've BEEN MISTREATED. GET THE NEGATIVITY out of your life &gt;&gt; so that healing can come to your home. &gt;&gt; Healing can come to your body &gt;&gt; to see because you're being led by the spirit that you worship. It's so easy to to settle into that spirit &gt;&gt; and worship it. &gt;&gt; Somebody get a little problem. That's all there you God forbid you go bound. How are you today? God bless you. Good to see you. How are you today? &gt;&gt; Why? Because they worship the spirit. &gt;&gt; They want the problem. &gt;&gt; They love the problem. &gt;&gt; And they there's something in them that that the attention of it or whatever whatever it is, they worship the spirit of it. Don't ever get caught up worshiping the spirit of a problem. &gt;&gt; This is the worst time. You know, I heard somebody say this the other day said, you know, this is the worst time in the world for problems. There's more problems in the world today than there ever has been. How many knows that? &gt;&gt; So, see, it's the worst problems that the world has ever had. So, it's the worst time in the world to be a problem. &gt;&gt; It's the worst problems we've ever had. It's the worst time to be a problem. Don't be a problem. Be a solution. &gt;&gt; Don't be a negative. be a positive. &gt;&gt; You have children and people that that look to you and are and friends and family that look to you. So don't so don't get caught up in something that took place in your life and allow it to negatively affect everybody around you. Somebody in the home has to turn back and say, "I'm not worshiping that spirit." Hello, somebody. Somebody in the household has to rise up and say, "I'm not going to bow down to that spirit. I know it came. I know it happened. I know it took place. I know the HISTORY OF IT, BUT YOU'LL NOT CATCH ME BOWING DOWN to that spirit. I won't worship it. It come from the devil. It didn't COME FROM GOD. MY GOD IS A HEALER. HE'S A DELIVERER. HE'S A SAVIOR. AND I STILL BELIEVE IT. AND I WORSHIP GOD. I'LL BE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AND BECAUSE I'M LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL BRING HEALING TO MY BODY. &gt;&gt; I think it's time we handle things like Christians. &gt;&gt; See, the result you get comes from the spirit you're worshiping. That's right. &gt;&gt; Comes from the spirit you're worshiping. &gt;&gt; So if you want healing, here it is. Don't worship the spirit of a sickness. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of a sickness don't bring healing. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God does. &gt;&gt; If you need deliverance, well, don't worship the spirit of an addiction. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of an addiction don't bring deliverance. The spirit of God does. &gt;&gt; So see, what spirit you worship determines the result. that you get. &gt;&gt; But we have to enter into a true spirit of worship. This is what makes you a real believer. &gt;&gt; Moments like this. I'm going to take a minute. &gt;&gt; This is what makes you a real believer. Is when you find yourself sitting in moments just like this and reflecting on your life and say, you know what, I've been doing that. I I find myself many times worshiping that spirit. Something that come over me or something that happened on I found myself entertaining and I give more reverence to that than I do the word of God. I give more. I bow down to that more more than I do the word of God. I fall into that more than I do the word the the word of God. But when we find oursel in that place, say, you know what? I'm not going to entertain that. &gt;&gt; Let me enter into a spirit of worship. I don't want to see my family going down this path. I I don't want to to see where that ends. I I don't want to be 50, 60, 70 years old and that be my whole history. But let me be a let me be an old man with a testimony. You know what? My family went through a great trial. It looked like it was going to take us out. But I claimed the blood of Jesus over my family. I was a worshshiper of God and I follow and because I worshiped God, the spirit OF GOD, HE LED ME AND MY FAMILY RIGHT OUT OF THAT CONDITION TO WHERE WE BECAME A GREAT TESTIMONY AMONG THE people of God. And then your children can go on and have good lives and and lead great lives and have great households and be testimonies for God. They they they can be great Christians and leaders in a Christian community because of a decision that a mama and a daddy made. &gt;&gt; You young people a decision that you make in your life, it reflects or it affects the rest of our life. &gt;&gt; Said, but we got to enter into a spirit of worship. Isn't that what John done? He said, "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day." But said, "You can't do any good until first you get in the spirit. God can't use you. All your efforts are in vain until you first do it in the spirit. If I sing, I will sing in the spirit." Isn't that what Paul said? If I pray, I will pray in the spirit. He said, if there's anything that comes to me that's any good, it has to be revealed to me by the spirit and then confirmed by the word. In other word, here prophet of God said, before I will accept anything, it has to come by the spirit of God and then I have to confirm it by the word of God and then even after that it's made manifest by the result that it bears. Are you hearing me? So, if it's not bearing the right kind of result, then go back and check it and see, you know what, maybe that wasn't the spirit of God that led me into that because it's not bringing the right result. My We shouldn't BE BICKERING AND WE SHOULDN'T BE DOWN and my my children shouldn't be bound. WE SHOULDN'T BE LIVING IN BONDAGE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE REJOICING. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN A REVIVAL. WHAT'S CAUSING ALL OF THIS? SEE, THE RESULT, it shows what spirit that you worship. It's so easy to worship spirits. He said, "But it's revealed to me by the spirit, confirmed by the word, and made manifest by the result that it bears." He says, "So, in other words, if I say Jesus Christ promised his word that if I would repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the first thing for me to do is repent." He makes this so easy. It's revealed to me that it's true. Then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then the result is that I receive the Holy Ghost. See, it's a positive result because you was worshiping the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Because you follow the word of God. All through the Bible, people are reminded to change who they worship and who they serve. How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Did I run out of time? &gt;&gt; All through the Bible, our human nature, it's so easy to be led by other things. It's so easy to be led by false gods. You But but but you realize that, Brother Mark, that we're not we're not meant to do that because we're a different class of people. Hello. You're a chosen people, a chosen generation. You've been called out by God to be separate from the world. You you you you you're a chosen people. God has called us in this hour. &gt;&gt; You know, I think about Israel. I'll use this as a closing point. It'll take a minute, but I think of Israel and their and how that they come out of Egypt. You realize that they were under such bondage when they come out of Egypt that they didn't have the liberty to freely worship God. &gt;&gt; They were bound by task masters. It wouldn't it wouldn't give them the liberty. It's just just it's any problem that you have today and maybe maybe it's over you. Maybe it's whooping you and beating you and you've been so bound up. It's a taskmaster that would keep you. But then there come in the middle of all of that bondage. You realize it was in the midst of bond bondage, brother Elum that the deliverer came. It it didn't come after they got it came right in the middle of it. I know sometimes we don't like that. And you know what? The Israelites didn't like it when Moses came either. They said, "You make it hard on us." They got unsettled. They started squirming in their seat. You you make it hard on us. you're making you make our our work harder. Would you go on just leave us alone? We're happy where we are. BUT HE COULDN'T DO THAT. He was a deliverer and he was anointed of God for that TIME TO COME RIGHT INTO THEIR HOME RIGHT INTO THEIR INTO their land, brother Mark, right into Israel and walk right in amongst them and say, "Well, here's a problem. You wasn't made to be like this. You was made to be God's free people. God didn't call you to be bound up by Egypt. He didn't send you here to live under bondage. He didn't he didn't he didn't make you to be living under a taskmaster. But you're God's free people. You're supposed to be free. You're supposed to be able to freely worship God. But the devil has came and put you in bondage. But I have a word from the Lord THAT NOW IS THE TIME OF DELIVERANCE. And Moses, HE DIDN'T CARE THAT THEY DIDN'T want him there BECAUSE HE WAS CALLED OF GOD TO WALK RIGHT INTO THEIR HOME AND SAY, "YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE BOUND. YOU'RE MEANT TO BE FREE. YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO WORSHIP THAT SPIRIT. YOU'RE MEANT TO WORSHIP THE SPIRIT OF GOD. YOU'RE GOD'S FREE MEN AND WOMEN CALLED BY GOD IN THIS HOUR TO BE CALLED OUT." And &gt;&gt; when he went into that place, he brought them out into this land, going into the promised land. And no doubt as they went out there, brother Noah, that their mind would go back to where they came from because their whole entire lives was wrapped up in Egypt. [crying] &gt;&gt; So their mind was would go back there. But notice what Joshua would tell them whenever they would they would they would hear about those around the camp. They were starting to they were starting to idolize other things. They were starting to pick up. Maybe maybe one of the maybe one of the kids remember one of those Egyptian gods and maybe the guy over there with a little with a piece of flint and man he got to get carving him out. One of them little gods and yeah I remember what that one looked like. He just carve him out out a little god. But the Bible said here they were starting to pick up these idols and in their mind they were they were they had they had moved out of Egypt. They went into the land of the Amorites who served even other gods. No doubt when they walked through the land of the Amorites there's these great big gods. I know you've never been to India, but over in India, there there's gods that are 300 feet, 200 feet tall, 150 feet tall. When you drive by them, you can't help but look at them. It's got a monkey head and a and a and an elephant body and and and all kinds of weird things that that's going on. But people bow down by the thousands and worshiping and you're driving by looking at this great big God. But but what happened when they came out of there? They they were picking up these gods and and so here Joshua came in the camp and he began to call upon them to fear the Lord. He said, "Fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood in Egypt and serve ye the Lord." So all of this time when they had came out that they that they had served these gods, they grow grown up serving these gods. But now here Joshua is speaking to the children of those that were raised in Egypt. They they were babies when they come out of there. Maybe some of them were even born out in the wilderness. They they had never experienced that. And when they came out there, they were holding gods and not because they worshiped the god or loved the god or had any history. They were only holding it because it was the god that their father used to have. And so now because their father had it, they were just going to go through it. Or because my dad was a Baptist, I'll be a Baptist. Because my dad went to church, I I'll go to church. But here Joshua came and he said, "But put away the God of your fathers BECAUSE YOUR FATHER'S GOD ain't going to do you no good." &gt;&gt; He said, "On the other side of the flood in Egypt, and serve you the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, then choose you this day whom you will serve, whether it be the gods of your fathers, served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. I thought, isn't it so easy to pick up the gods of our fathers? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to pick up the traditions &gt;&gt; of our fathers and the way they believe them. We we'll believe because this one said it was or this is a tradition. So, we'll pick it up because that one said it was. It's so easy to pick up the gods of our fathers. Maybe some even your father was an alcoholic and a son will become an alcoholic. Why? Because it's easy to pick up the gods of our fathers. &gt;&gt; Father listen to rock and roll so the boy listens to rock and roll. Why? Because it's easy to pick up the gods of our fathers. You see why it's important not to be that way in front of your children. It's important to be a son of God and to and to treat every situation that way. Because your children your children when they answer to God, can I just friends? Let me tell you something Lord just put on my heart. But when your children answer to God, you won't be there with them. It ain't between you and them and God. You ain't going to be there to babysit or or say, "God, now you take care of my CHILD NOW." IT AIN'T IT AIN'T NONE OF YOUR business when God is dealing with your children. Has nothing to do with you. They're God's children. He only lent them to you to raise them. They're God's children. They're not your children anyway. They're God's children. Be careful how you treat God's children. Be careful how you raise God's children. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY TO GOD'S CHILDREN. BE CAREFUL HOW YOU TEACH GOD'S CHILDREN, &gt;&gt; especially when it's against the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, daddy, well, that's not your daddy. You got a real father. A earthly father, that's just who you was born to." Well, good. And it's good to obey your father and mother while you're living in their household. And there come a time at an age of accountability, a child has to obey his heavenly father. &gt;&gt; You obey the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You got to take that stand because when you answer to God, daddy ain't there, mom ain't there. You know, the word says this, but daddy said it was okay, but daddy ain't going to be there to answer for you. It's between you and God and the word. &gt;&gt; Mama said it was okay, but the word says this. Mama ain't going to be there for you. &gt;&gt; That's between you and God and the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to pick up the gods of our fathers. &gt;&gt; Listen what they said. They said, "God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods. For the Lord our God, he has brought us out of Egypt and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. And we seen great signs and wonders in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went. And among all the people through we passed, and the Lord drove out them before us, the Amorites which dwell in the land. Therefore, we will also serve the Lord, for he is our God. Watch how Joshua answers them. He said, "You cannot serve the Lord. We will serve the Lord for he is our God. Joshua says you can't serve the Lord. You can't serve the Lord for he is a holy God. Here Joshua is looking at the condition of the people. We're serving the Lord. You can't serve the Lord because he is a holy God. He's a jealous God. and he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods. &gt;&gt; So, see, there's so much pressure on you. Joshua wanted to he wanted to make them aware. If you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods, he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after all that he has done that was good. And the people said unto Joshua, "Nay, but we will serve the Lord." You see what he's doing? He's given us a warning, brother Ben, don't promise to serve God and then go serve other gods. &gt;&gt; He said, because the blessing you would receive would become a curse instead. &gt;&gt; It's so easy &gt;&gt; to pick up the gods of our fathers. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to worship the gods of our fathers or the the maybe maybe it was just something mean or some spirit or something evil. It's so easy to be that way. It's so easy to be like everybody else. It's easy to pick up the gods that other people carry. You walk around with your friends and they pack certain kind of gods. It's easy to pick up their gods and start worshiping their gods. &gt;&gt; Say, you know, I want to worship their gods. You know, it makes me fit in better. It makes me It makes me feel better around them. I I'm not such an outcast. I'll just pick up the gods that they carry and I worship their god. It's so easy to pick up the gods of our fathers. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "How God blesses a man that would be true to the word of God." said, "He may not be very popular, but he will be blessed." &gt;&gt; And now people, they have to make their choice whether you want to act like the rest of those fellas or whether you want to be blessed of God. &gt;&gt; You can just take your choice, but if you're going to live like the rest of them, then you're going to be blessed of them. &gt;&gt; You'll receive their blessing. I'm so proud of you. You finally got out of that old that old bondage of church. I'm so proud of you. You're man, you finally had a mind of your own. You finally got tired of being brainwashed. I'm so proud of you. If you'll follow after the rest of them, &gt;&gt; then you'll be blessed of them. &gt;&gt; He said, "But but if you'll turn your desires to God, you'll be blessed of God." &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't know about you, but what a marvelous choice to be blessed of man or to be blessed of God. &gt;&gt; How many How many can make that choice? I You want the blessings that man has to give? Man's blessings are limited. A good pat on the back, they don't even have a dollar to give you. They couldn't even bless you with a little bit. Nobody has nothing to give. It's just to make you fit in their crown. But you the blessings of man are the blessings of God. A cow, a father that owns the cattle on a thousand hills. Joshua said, "Choose you this day whom you will serve." &gt;&gt; You say, "What day?" It ain't any certain day. It's every day. &gt;&gt; You realize every day that you have that same choice laying before you. Choose you today whom you'll serve. &gt;&gt; Will it be the gods of your fathers? Will it be some strange god that you picked up? be some some spirit, some some thing or another that you'll follow. Said, "But choose you this day, every day, not just elders, not just leaders, but every one of us, young people the same. Choose you this day whom you will serve. &gt;&gt; Don't wait until you're older to start serving God, &gt;&gt; scarred and broken and bitter and all these things that happen in your life. I think what you ought to do is just give God the best years of your life." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so proud of our young people because they have a desire to serve God. Don't think the devil ain't trying to do everything he can to take them out. But when the devil hits them, I don't hit them, too. &gt;&gt; I've never been that kind of person. When the devil hits somebody, I'm going to come by and give them a good sucker punch, too, cuz I realize the devil just hit them. I'm not going to hit them because the devil hit him. If he's hitting them, I'm going to try to pick them up. I'm trying to lift them. I'm trying to encourage them because I think this is the day that you can serve God and make a difference in the world. Make a difference. Don't Don't give God the best years you have. Sometimes you don't feel like you're a part, but let me just tell you this this morning. Remember your creator. As a music players, come remember your creator. It was God that made you. God, you don't you don't feel like you fit in. You may not feel like a part, but you realize that everything that God ever made was made for a purpose. How many How many knows that? You you realize that the trees have a purpose. The the animals have a purpose. The grass has a purpose. The birds have a purpose. Even the insects in our world, they all serve a purpose. You know, I was reading an article the other day, science, it was saying that that the living every living organism, it serves a purpose. It's unique in its existence. Everything feeds something or or eats something. &gt;&gt; It's all here for the purpose of this this cycle of life. It provides for another species. And they all rely on each other for survival. There ain't nothing that God ever made that wasn't for a purpose. &gt;&gt; The smallest little insect, smallest little bird. And I was looking at all kinds of them. I was going to show pictures, but all the oddest things that God created, but each one had a purpose. &gt;&gt; You know, I was even reading article about insects. It says some of the strange purposes that insects had and what they were made for and how that they were shaped in a certain way and why they had that shape and how it caused them to interact with the with the rest of the the environment. And I was reading that and in the article they were praising the ingenuity of evolution. They're saying how wonderful is the ingenuity of evolution that all of this created itself. I thought y'all are so dumb to be so smart. The dumbest smart person I know wrote that praising the ingenuity of evolution. I thought here, you know how ignorant of a statement that is. Ingenuity is the quality of being clever. That's what it means. The quality of being clever or or inventive. And clever it means means quick. Somebody that's quick to understand or intelligent. So even by their own definition, the ingenuity of evolution, it would mean that it had to have an intelligence. So it can't just be happening. There has to be an intellig intelligence behind it. I thought here by their own definition, in order for things to exist in order for things to involve, there had to be an intelligence behind it. But friends, let me tell you that intelligence has a name. And Moses called him Elohim. He called him a great creator. He called him Jehovah God. He was called in the Bible Jehovah Gyra, a provider. He was call Jehovah Rafi, our healer. He was called Jehovah Rohi, our shepherd. Jehovah Sidkanu, our righteousness. Jehovah Shalom. He was called our peace. And he came to the earth in the form of a man. And they called him a man from Galilee. They called him a boy from Nazareth. They called him a carpenter's son. They called him the son of David. They called him, even his critics, they called him Beelzebub, but he has a name. What do you call him? Says, "Well, I I call him Jesus. He's my Lord. He's my Savior." That intelligence has a name, Brother Mark, and it's Jesus. He's my healer. He's my deliverer. He became my sacrifice. The Bible said he was before all things and by him all things consist. All things were created by him and for him. And that same intelligence that made all of those things made you and I. Can I say this this morning? The one that made the sun and made the earth. He made the stars. He made the moon. He made the He made the animal. He made the insect. He made the trees. He made the ocean. He made the fishes of the sea. He made the whale. He made every dolphin. Everything that's ever been existence in this world. It was made by God. This man Jesus that we read about, the very God that was in that flesh is the creator of the heaven and earth. Brother Mark, he made everything. But there was only one thing that he didn't make. He never made a mistake. And that same God that made all of that, that never made one error, is the one that made you and he made you and he made you and he made you and he made you and he made you. He made you and I. There ain't nothing that God has ever made that's been by accident. He made us and he made us for a purpose. No wonder there's a desire in our heart to not follow after a tradition. There's no it's it's not a desire in our heart to be a grandson of God, but it's a desire to be a son of God. It's a desire in our heart. Lord, I wonder if you'll stand to your feet this morning. How many say there's a desire in my heart to to call that's calling me back to the creator or the one that made me? God, let me look past everybody else and the influences of this world and the influence of my of my my my peers and my my my siblings and my father, my mother, my uncles, my aunts. May I look past all of the influence and just be a worshshiper of God? Can I just be a daughter of God or a son of God? And can I just serve you? Is there a worship in your heart? Let me ask you friends, what spirit are you worshiping? The result shows you what spirit is leading you and you're led by the spirit that you worship. Friends, if I got caught up in something that had me so wrapped up that it became every thought in my mind, every time I went to bed, that's all I thought about. It's what caused I and because it just can't get right. It causes so much confusion. All cut it out of your life. Why be unhappy? Why be miserable? Just cut it out of your life. Stop worshiping the spirit of it and go back to worshiping this Holy Spirit. This God that is a spirit. We worship in spirit and in truth. Go back to worshiping God. to be led by the spirit of God. God made you. He made you for a purpose. And let me tell you friends, that purpose was not to serve the world. It was made to serve God. It wasn't made to serve sin. It was made for us to serve him as sons and daughters of God, the God of your fathers. Amen. How many come just to worship the Lord? Joshua said, "If you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods, then he will turn [music] and do you hurt and consume you that he hath done after he had done you good." I thought, you know, many times in my life, I should have been destroyed. If that's the case, many times in my life, God should have came and brought me hurt instead of good. I should have been destroyed. But you know what? Since the days of Joshua, brother Mark, since the days of Joshua, there came another sacrifice. Brother said, you know how that when God came to Abraham and began to tell him that he's going to visit Sarah the time of life, you know that she laughed in her heart at God. He said, and God should have destroyed her. He said, "But because she left, he should have destroyed her if she hadn't been a part of Abraham." He would have. He said, "A lot of times our unbelief would destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ." He said, "But God, are you listening to me, friends? You may have been wrapped up. You may you may have picked up strange gods. You may you may be worshiping the wrong kind of God and worshiping the wrong kind of spirit and it's leading you down the wrong path." And many preachers would take that scripture of Joshua and saying, "God will do you hurt and God is going to destroy." But I'm not going to say that to you this morning. I'm going to tell you what a prophet said. He said, "A lot of times our unbelief would destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ." He said, "But God can't destroy us now because the blood of Jesus CHRIST KEEPS GOD OFF OF US. FOR WE ARE A PART of Christ just as Sarah was a part of Abraham. FOR WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND WE THE people who's born of THE SPIRIT OF GOD, WE OUGHT TO WAKE UP AND GET OUT OF OUR SHOES AND WATCH FOR THE SUPERNATURAL SIGN OF THE coming of the Lord Jesus. When God ought to destroy you that it can't even destroy you because you're under the blood of the sacrifice. Friends, the spirit you worship is what saves you. The altar of sacrifice is what saves you from destruction in this world. What spirit are you worshiping? Let's just bow our heads this morning. It's so easy. It's so easy. You say, "Brother man, how do I know if I'm worshiping it?" It's leading you. It becomes your absolute. It's where you turn to get answers. You take it over the word of God. When you have to take any part of God's word and and dismiss it to do something else, it's leading you. That's how you know you're worshiping it. Say, "But I don't want to be caught worshiping any spirit like that." Wonder how many today, you say, "Brother man, I pray you'd remember me. God bless you, brother, for being honest, sister. God bless you. But I know who [music] I am." Let me tell you, friend, you are a son of God. God needs you. You're a daughter of God. He needs you in this great age that we live in. God needs real men and women to stand upon the truth of his word to worship the the spirit of truth and and to be a an absolute to the world that will never hear that word. God needs you. Could you just lift your hand? Just surrender. Say, "Lord, let me just be found worshiping." I wonder how many just say, "Brother man, I just want to restore that. Lord, let me just worship you. Lord, let there not be one thing in my life. If there's something I'm worshiping, Lord, I pray you'd take it out of my life. Let me not be worshiping any other spirit outside of the spirit of God. God, God sees our hands. Lord, that's a desire of my heart. Lord, let me let me lead the right way. Let's just pray. Gracious heavenly father. Lord, we just thank you for your spirit here this morning. God, what a desire that we have as believers, Lord. And God, not to be caught up in sacrificing on the altars that are made by men and worshiping things, Lord, that spirits that are unlike you. God, I understand. And God, that we live in this world. And God, I understand that we do things and we fellowship and we have friends and peers. And Lord, many folks that we interact with in town, Lord, not even believers. And Lord, but we don't worship the spirit. But Lord, let us be found as Joshua said, putting away the gods of our fathers that was bound them on the other side of the floods. Lord, you are such a an open view of our lives. Lord, to see how that a daddy as a young man, Lord, would be left out of something in such a way or a mama that was seems like that she was always left out and in her heart, in her spirit be so torn up by it, Lord, that that now they would come to a place that in their own children that they would force things upon them that they wouldn't feel the feeling that they felt. But God, you you can go all the way back and see where the problem really was. And Lord, I just ask you this morning, God, that you would open it to our heart, Lord. God, let us lead our children according to thy word. Lord, let us not let us not cause them to pick up any strange God. Let us as fathers and mothers, God, to lead them to the spirit of God, to lift it up over our lives and our homes and our families, Lord, that we would worship that spirit and that spirit alone that he may lead us, Lord. That we would have a result in our life that's pleasing unto God. Lord, if there be somebody that's bound, Lord, I pray this morning that this message that's gone forth, Lord, would deliver them. Lord, I just pray, Lord, I've seen many sitting here as spirits would leave their life while they were just hearing the preaching of the word, Lord, as it was going forth, Lord, spirits leaving the building, Lord. And I know that when we leave this place, that same enemy, Lord, would come back and start speaking to their mind, Lord. God, I pray you'd give them the strength to say, "I'm not worshiping that spirit any longer, but I just want to worship the spirit of truth. Let me be an example, a worshshiper, a true worshipper." Lord, we just ask you these things in the name of Jesus. Here I am to worship. [singing] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say you're [singing] my God. You're worthy. [music] You're lovely.

I worship God because of who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And knowing that he can't destroy me &gt;&gt; because who he made me. &gt;&gt; It causes me to love him. It caused me want to serve him. It causes me want to to live right by him. To be a living sacrifice. You know why Paul said a living sacrifice? Go home and read the word. Look up the word sacrifice. Take a good hour and study on what it means to sacrifice. It means to give up something. &gt;&gt; It's a and it ain't something to sacrifice. It isn't to give up something that you don't like. &gt;&gt; Even the Catholics are better than that. When they teach you, you got to give up something. For for Lent, you got to give up something that you enjoy. &gt;&gt; Don't give up something that you that you don't like. Can you imagine going around your house and picking out a bunch of stuff you don't like no more and giving to people for Christmas? Yeah, I just had it on my heart to give. No, you didn't like it. You didn't want it. So, instead of throwing the trash, I gave it to you. That's not a sacrifice. But when brother Andrew says, you know, I really like that tie. You just take off the That's my favorite tie. That's the only one my wife lets me wants me to wear. I'm just kidding. But you a sacrifice to give up things you enjoy. Make our bodies a living sacrifice. Some things that would be appealing. Some things that Satan would make it enjoyable. It would it would be a blessing from the world. But I would give it up. See, why make my body a living sacrifice? It's a sacrifice. [music] It is. You know, it's a sacrifice to serve God many times. Persecuted, made fun of, criticized. [music] But Jesus said, "If they persecute you for my name's sake, you're blessed." And friends, I don't know about you, but I'd rather be blessed of God than blessed of men. Amen.
