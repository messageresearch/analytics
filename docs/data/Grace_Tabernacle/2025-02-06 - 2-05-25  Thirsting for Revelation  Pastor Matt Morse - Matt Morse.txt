everything I can to get behind them whether they're my kids or your kids and I trust y'all will help me and get behind them with me and so we sure appreciate them but I want to read tonight out of the Book of Genesis the 21st chapter and the 14th verse the Bible says and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he took bread and a bottle of water and he gave it unto Hagar and putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beerseba and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she went and set her down or set down over against him a good way off and it were a b as if it were a bowshot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she set over against him and she lifted up her voice and she wept and I would like to speak tonight on thirsting for Revelation if you could take your seats on thirsting for Revelation I realize this tonight that our in our lives there is a balance between natural things and spiritual things how many believe that say Amen we believe that we believe that there's there's a difference between our natural life and our spiritual life and uh we realize that nearly nearly everybody on Earth would believe that there is a spiritual side to humanity I I've talked to people from all uh different kinds of beliefs and backgrounds and uh Church going people and not Church going people and different kind of U uh different kind of gods that they serve from from from India and uh uh different places to Korea to uh South America you know around the world you'll find out that majority of people believe in some type of spirituality they believe there's a spiritual uh uh part of our Humanity the doctors will say that there's things that they can't explain the scientists say there's questions that they don't have the answer to but I thank God tonight as a body of belie Believers that not only do we think that but we know it amen uh that that we are as a people that we are Triune beings and in our in our our life or the makeup of our life that Brother Kyle there's a body and there's a soul and there's a spirit and and we realize that we're constantly dealing with these three things it doesn't matter what we do in our life that we're always uh trying our effort our work all that we do is trying to make it our life a place of comfort or a place uh to be satisfied with our life and uh to make things a little bit easier on oursel and so uh it doesn't matter uh what we're doing we're always trying to work on one of these three areas this is this is just what we uh do in our life we spend time working on these areas of our life and you know there's something that I found out that that you can recognize when somebody is working on a certain area of their life you you spend time working in a certain area it always shows in the outward man so you know uh you know you have somebody that's spending time in prayer and they're spending time uh reading their Bible and they're getting closer to God you don't have to go around telling everybody you know I I I've been praying a lot lately I've been reading my Bible a lot it's it's something that automatically shows it shows what's taking place on the inward man is always showing in the outward man and so uh you know I realize that that because we're working on this that uh what happens is sometimes we go to praying and we asking for God to come and move and help in situations and and I believe that God is a God that can take things out of your life I believe in the power of prayer how many believe that I I believe that you can lay hands on the sick and the sick recover I believe those uh that like some that came in Sunday and and and the spirit of the Lord came in and delivered them from Spirits that they've been battling for many years and so I believe that God is certainly able to rid us of spirits and he can drive uh evil spirits out of our life and but I also know this that whenever a spirit leaves a man it always tries to find a way back in and so you may come up and you may get delivered and God May deliver you and and and then all of a sudden here comes that same spirit that's trying to find his way back in and work his way back into our life but I believe that we have a right as a Believer to exercise the rights that God has given us to be able to speak to that spirit that would come in and say I've had a nature change there there's something that's happened in my life and no longer are you welcome here and friends I've got news for you this uh this evening it don't matter what the spirit is you you have a right as a Believer to say i' I've Been Changed God's came and he took that out of my life and I know you're trying to come back in I recognize who you are and I know that there's a tempter and he's always working his way back in but I but I'm a Believer and I've had a nature change and God has done something in my life and I don't want no part of you anymore see there's some there's one thing to allow God to take a spirit or something out of our life but then there's another thing to exercise our rights to keep that from coming in and and to and bringing us back into that place or dragging us back down see it's a constant battle just as hard as you're working to get to a place spiritually that you can be free the devil's working that much harder to get you a place spiritually that you're bound up again see so it's a constant battle not only is it a struggle In the Flesh and a struggle to make it from day to day but brother Mark it's a struggle in the spirit uh to be free and be freed from these things and you know but I I just say this tonight just to uh lay a foundation that I am a believer that people can change how many believes that say Amen I'm a believer that people that that they can change that a person don't have to be the same person that they always were matter of fact I I heard the prayer of a prophet he said Lord may you make our lives so tender and make us so flexible that you can change us at any time and mold us into being Sons and Daughters of God I believe that God can change us I believe that we can be so flexible that God can use us and you know I realize that tonight that when we go to work that we're working on these things when you go to your job you're working you're dealing with carnal things you're trying to you're you're you're dealing with your natural life you work to make your natural life better but when you come to the house of God we don't come to the house of God to deal with the natural life we come to deal with a spiritual life so if you can go to to the to the Natural work and you can work there to get better off in the natural and I believe that you can come to the house of God and you can do some spiritual work and you can go away better off as a spiritual man we don't come we come here to deal with a spiritual man and the soul of a man and you know that's why that I don't believe that we ought to have a carnal church because I believe that that that that there's no place in the house House of God for carnality I believe the house of God is a spiritual place I believe it ought to be kept as a spiritual place it ought to be kept as a sanctuary that God can move in and deal with the hearts of people it it ain't a place of joking and making fun and poking around but it's a place that we can come and dedicate a a certain part of our life and a time of our life and a little place of Refuge that the Holy Spirit can come with deal and deal with hearts and lives and so we come to the house of God brother Mark we come to grow in the word of God we come to grow in our experience with God and I realize that today there's all kinds of churches that they ain't the same way there's all kinds of of carnal churches and carnal things that you can go to but friends I've got news for you if you can go to a church and you can't grow in the word of God and you can't grow in faith and you can't grow in Revelation then you need to find a church that you can go to that you can grow in faith and you can grow in God and you can grow in Revelation and you can get closer to God I believe that we have a right to be spiritually worked on by the spirit of God how many believe that see what happens is when our spiritual man is strengthened then you begin to gain power as a Believer you gain power over sickness you gain power over problems you you get power over family struggles over those inherited qualities that was passed down from generation to generation when you get to a place with God and you begin to grow spiritually you gain power over these things that have always had power over you that's why I believe that we ought to have a spiritual church that's why we fight to keep atmosphere in the house of God because there's nothing carnal that can that can help a spiritual man there's nothing carnal that can that can grow a spiritual man it takes a moving of the spirit of God it takes a growing in the spirit of God to help that spiritual side of our Humanity see a spiritual a spirit filled church I believe this is a powerful church but let me tell you this if a spir how many believe that and but but if a Spirit-filled church is a powerful church then what do you think a spirit filled man is he's a powerful man a Spirit-filled woman she's a powerful woman but let me tell you it only comes by one way according to the scripture we'll only find it by Revelation I I remember when they come out of the upper room that day and here they were they had been in contact with the power of the Holy Ghost the Bible said here they come out of there they were staggering around like drunk men and they the people would look at them and say that that they've been drunk but we realize it wasn't the drinking of a natural wine it wasn't that old wine that people talked about but it was the were drunk on a new wine and brother Bram said see what it was he said wine represents the stimulation of Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell they seen the fire of God fall upon them and it begin to stimulate them and the first thing you know they got so stimulated to the people actually thought that they were drunk he said but what it was is they were stimulated by the Revelation it was by God's word he said it see what it was it was God's Vindicated Revelation that stimulated them it was made PL to them and they were happy about it because God had promised it and now here it was revealed to them it was Vindicated to them remember what Jesus said he said you go over there and you T until the Holy Ghost comes and then you shall receive power they had a promise of God they waited on God to come and perform the promise of God and then all of a sudden here come the Holy Ghost and and the very thing that they had been told about now they were living in the presence of it and it caused them to be stimulated because the word of God had been revealed right before before their very eyes he said that's what they did they saw it and Peter went out and he was preaching this is that that the prophet Joel spoke of he said there it was it was a Vindicated by the same sign that we have today they were stimulated by Revelation you realize that the same holy ghost that they saw that day that stimulated that church is the same holy ghost that still stimulates you and I brother Mark it's the same stimulation and it comes by Revelation he said see it was a revelation that caused them to recognize the Holy Ghost it was a revelation that released the power that was within the Holy Ghost it oh friends I know there's a power in a lot of things there's power in prayer you believe it there's power in the Holy Ghost there's power in our confession I could spend hour speaking on the power that comes from the confession out of a human mouth but a prophet of God said but there ain't nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God there ain't no power there's any greater than Revelation it's no wonder he would say pray for revelation than anything else because it ain't just a word that you hear it ain't just something that you're repeating it ain't just something to recite but it's a revelation that would stack the heart of a believer that would cause the power that laid behind it to be able to be spoke out of your mouth and would bring things to pass see promises don't just come from confession but I believe the Bible tells us that the church was built on the confession of the revelation of who Jesus was it wasn't it wasn't just Peter making a confession but he was confession a confessing a revelation ation that he had that's why so many people never grow spiritually because they confess but they never get a revelation of what they're confessing by the whole world is reciting the Bible the whole world is quoting quotes and and reciting things that someone tells them to recite and maybe you could spend hours to you know a good psychologist to give you something to repeat when you get up in the mirror that that'll help you to overcome your your daily struggles but you realize that just a confession will never cause you to overcome see but it took a revelation of what you were confessing see when the Revelation came then the confession had power you see many today they confess but they never see the fruit of their confession you say well why not it's because they don't have the right Revelation see because the fruit of confession can only come by a revelation and when a revelation tracks a heart and you begin to grow in Revelation well then your confession becomes greater when you grow in Revelation suddenly your confession has power and has an authority and you overcome by confession because of the Revelation that you had so see so when a when you take a revealed a revealed word and you confess a word that has been revealed to you no longer is it just a word or just a scripture that you're quoting or confessing but it's a revelation that's in your heart and so when you can speak of something you're speaking out of a revelation and you're speaking by Revelation and then you're confessing something that now has a great power that's that's why we follow the message of the hour because God had sent in the hour that we live in a word Prophet how many knows what a word Prophet does a word Prophet preaches the revelation of the word of God it wasn't just to come many men have stood up in our day and have taken this Bible and they spoke many scriptures and they preached millions and millions and millions of sermons that have been spoken out of this Bible but brother Mark but then God would send the spirit of the Holy Ghost Among Us and the Very purpose of it was to take by Revelation and reveal the word of God to the hearts of the Believers see it wasn't just reciting that would give them power it ain't reing that would take them into a Rapture it ain't reciting it that would give us faith it wasn't just hearing it with our natural ear but hearing with a heart a revealed word of God it would bring power to the church again it's a time of restoration and when that word strikes your heart not just words that you would hear a man speak but when the word a revealed word of God would strike a man's heart then that man can speak to a mountain and the mountain has to move he can speak to a giant and the giant has to fall he can speak to a water and the Waters par he can speak the valleys and they're made plain and they're made level ground why is it because he had a revelation of who he is and and the word of God that applied to him and what he had a right to stand on and the power of God is upon his life yes sir brother Andrew was preaching on Sunday morning about the presence of the pillar of fire I got I got I got in inspired by the by the message that he preached the presence of the pillar of fire you know I think sometimes people misunderstand the attraction that we're following as a people do you realize what it was let me ask you this when Moses went to the Wilderness and he saw the bush that was burning What attracted Moses to the top of the mountain the attraction was the pillar of fire right Moses went up he was attracted because he saw a fire that was burning but didn't consume the bush that it was on see he was attracted by it and you realize that that same Pillar of Fire the Bible tells us is what led the children of Israel out of Egypt when they went out that same pillar they they could have argued with Moses and said he wasn't the man for the job and and well he couldn't talk good enough and he now he wasn't a good enough speaker or good enough good enough leader they they could have they could have came up with all that but you realize that these people had been taught by prophecy that there was coming a time that they'd be delivered out of this place of Egypt they had heard many voices brother Mark Through the Ages they heard the voice of Abraham say that God said they're going to go into this place they heard the voice of Isaac that that that would that would confirm what his father said they heard the voice of Jacob that would say that that that they're going to go into Egypt but they heard the voice of Joseph that said whenever we come out of there take my bones with you cuz we're not going to remain all of those that had gone on before him had spoke of the promise of God that was going to happen and so here when Moses came he was Vindicated by these great signs and wonders and this Supernatural uh that was following his calling and so he came before the people of God and here signs and wonders and works that he done that that were performed that were miraculous great miraculous works and I thought here a after seeing all these great Miracles and seeing the things that Moses had performed with just a just a little Rod that was in his hand and a voice that God was speaking through him but you realize that when they left out of there the Bible says still yet when they left out when they departed and they went on their Journey from suck off the ethem into the edge of the Wilderness you realize that they what what it was that they were following you realize brother Mark when they left out of there they were they went down the worst road that a man could ever go down when they came out of Egypt they went down the worst path that you could take out of Egypt to go to the promised land this is not the path that a man would have would had any sense would lead a group of people down it was the worst path brother Mark it wasn't the easy path it was a a treacherous road it was an undeveloped Wilderness I thought my they they could have went through the land of the Philistines the Bible said it was a much easier path they could have went through the Philistines and you know an ordinary man he would have let him that way he would have took them the place that where they could have water when they needed water he took them to the place where there was plenty of rivers and there there was food supply that they could have a place to get food but he said but God knew that they would have went into that land and God knew they would have seen war and they would have got fear of war and they' have returned back to Egypt out of the fear of a Great War if they went into this land of Philistines you know what God done because God knew what would happen down the road he took them down a harder path I'm going to get somewhere in just a minute but God knew what was going to happen down the road they said wouldn't this be easier would it be easier take the road that's already built there's already ways there's places we can stop after all we had these great Sports and wouldn't this be a a greater way but God knew what was going to happen down the road and God didn't see fit for them to take the easy route God took them on the hard route he took them down a treacherous road he took them through the Wilderness because God knew what would take place I thought my is it something to hear the people when they left out of there the Bible said God LED them through the Wilderness you realize they weren't following after a man they weren't following after a committee they weren't following after an organization they weren't taking a vote and saying this is what we ought to do or maybe this is the direction that that the church needs to go but they were following after God and he led them out in the middle of a Wilderness you me tell you what my Bible said it said that Pillar of Fire by A Cloud by day and a pillar of Fire by night and it never left the children of Israel they followed that Pillar of Fire that Moses saw in the bush and here they went out in the middle of the night and they walked down the they walked through that Wilderness every TR trouble that they came to brother Mah it was the pillar of fire that led them through when they came to the Red Sea the pillar of fire it let them past it when they when they needed water it was the pillar of fire that provided it when they needed some food it was the pillar of fire that provided it for them they followed after the pillar of fire you realize that when they many times through the scripture you see this same thing take place I was reading today about how they went down that they were having a prayer meeting one night at John Mark's house remember Peter he was on his last leg he was he was sitting in a prison cell and he was locked away and the Bible said it was his last night before he was going on trial before King Herod here he would been put to death but they had a prayer Mee and they begin to pray Lord we got a disciple and he's a he he he's a preacher he's Lord he he's serving you and we just asked you that you would help him they you know when they got in trouble look what the people of God always do when they got in trouble brother the Travis they just came together and had a little prayer meeting yeah and the Bible said here while they were sitting there praying here he was about to go on trial I could just see Peter sitting in this place here was a man that was sitting in a jail cell he was chained up between his hands he had he had hand cuffs on his arms shackles that chained him to the ground he had a guard sitting on his right and a guard sitting on his left and just outside the door there was a guard standing on the right and there was a guard standing on the left it was dark in there he was chained up he he had no way to get out of this situation and the Bible says but all of the sudden the angel of the Lord appeared in the jail cell and a light Shone in the room where he was don't you realize friends what it was it was that same Pillar of Fire that came present before Peter the Bible said all of a sudden when the angel came he brother B said what what was it it was the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt and it came right down in a jail cell where Peter was let me tell you what we're following church he he began to speak to him he said wrap your cloak around you Peter and come and follow me my what a word from the pillar of fire wrap your cloak around you and come and follow me I don't know who you're following tonight I don't know what you're following after but I know you better know who it is that that he'll lead you down the right path Peter got up and the Bible says Peter didn't even know what was going on he thought maybe I'm in a vision so you know what I'll just go or in a trance or a dream or something so I'll just go ahead and go on and do it so he got up and the chains fell off of his arms and he looked around and here here the the the guards he woke up and the guards stayed fast asleep I thought isn't that the way it is when the pillar of fire comes sweeping through it wakes up one man the next guy sleep right through it but here but what he done is he be to walk brother Mar out of this place and the Bible said he walked past the one guard then he walked past the next guard then he walked past the next guard and when he came to the gate the gate opened up by itself without a man touching it and he walked down to the end of the road and all of a sudden Peter came to himself and he was standing there as a free man and he said now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent an angel to rescue me from the clutches of a Herod my isn't that the way it is he said it came right in because of a prayer meeting the power that that that that the pillar of fire because of a prayer meet came right into where Peter was and he led him out of that dark place and put him on a put him on a path brother Mar where he could be free I wonder how many could speak like Peter tonight and say without a doubt I've been I I know that the Lord has sent his Angel and he's rescued me I know without a doubt the angel of the Lord has came in my life when I was Shackled and I had no way out when I was in a dark place and I couldn't find my way when I had guards that were guarding my day of judgment but the pillar of fire came down in the room where I was and the shackles fell off and the guards fell fast asleep and I stood up and walked out every gate opened every doorway was opened up and he came out a free man without a doubt being led by an Angel without a doubt the angel of the Lord has came yes sir and he's led me out of this Condition it's the pillar of fire remember Paul saw him on the road to Damascus here he was walking along but said listen here Saul when he seen him he is a Hebrew and he was well taught in the word notice whenever he saw the pillar of fire watch how he responded he said Lord who art thou is this something he used the word lord said well why he used the word Lord he said because he was well taught in the word and he knew it was the Lord he knew it was only explanation it could be when the presence of Pillar of Fire that it had to be the Lord he said because he was well taught in the word I thought here he recognized the pillar of fire because he was well taught in the word he recognized God because he was well taught think of it he was well taught he was a Hebrew I thought that's the way we need to be be tonight we need to be well taught we need to be taught like the Samaritan woman brother Mark she was well taught in the word she said she sat there that day and she GL makes me want to preach she sat there on the side of a well and here because of her life and because of the things that she knew about the age that she lived in here she had had such a wrecked up life here she had five husbands and and and the one she was with wasn't her own and here she sat there and Jesus began to speak to her about her life but because she was a well-taught woman notice what she said she saw one she she knew what the sign of the Messiah was so he began to speak to her about her life and she said isn't this the sign of the Messiah you realize what was taking place because she was well taught she recognized the Messiah whenever he came her way it wasn't she wasn't just some regular woman brother Mark she was well taught and let me tell you what happened because she was well taught then she got well taught because she was well taught in in the word in her history she sat by the wellside and she got a a new lesson she she had a lesson from Jesus Christ that said I am he that speaks unto thee oh she been when the Messiah comes he would discern when the Messiah comes he would do these things he said well I am he that speaks unto thee Oh don't you that's what we really need tonight we need a trip to the well and to be well taught we need to listen at The Well of God to recognize the presence of God when he's here she had a well experience brother Mark she was well taught you know not only do we need to know the scripture or the prophecies conc concerning the age but what we really need tonight is we need a trip to the well we need to go to the place to be able to find Jesus that that's what Mary did that day when she went down and she was here just an ordinary girl 16 18 years old brother Mark she was on her way to the well and all of a sudden she met the angel of the Lord that's the trip that we need to make tonight brother M said she went there he said she was engaged to a man she was an ordinary girl she loved God she believed in God but one day on her way to the the well to get some water she met God isn't that good she loved God she believed in God but one day on the way to the well to get some water she met God on the way to the well to get some water she met God and from that time the world has held her blessed art thou among women on the way to the well to get water she met God on a trip to the well brother Mark her future changed yeah on the trip to the well her life suddenly had meaning I'm preaching to you listen on a trip to the well God gave her her purpose in her life when she felt like she had no purpose her life had no meaning after all I'm just a mother raising children after all I'm Just a Nobody at my job after all I don't have any Great accomplishments to my name but on the trip to the well her life suddenly had meaning all of a sudden she had a purpose but man said God take us tonight to the Wells of water that we can say from that time something took a hold of me and I had an experience with God wonder how many how many wants that tonight Lord take us on a trip to the Wells of water take me to a place that I can say from that time no longer did I have headaches anymore take me to the place to that well of water that I could say no longer that I had those nightmares any longer that tormented me in the middle of the night but take me to the Wells of water that I can say from that time this has changed in my life take me to the Wells of water I can say that old man that I used to be but from that time I was a changed man from the time I took the walk to that well I became a changed man my past no no longer did I make the same mistakes in my past because I went down to the well I wonder how many can say that tonight amen I've been to the well and I came away a changed man how many testify I've been to the well and I came away changed amen that ought to do something for those that haven't been there to think that here a room full of people hundred or so people that could say I've been to the well and I came away changed I've been to the well and I and and the desires that I used to have they left me and I no longer had those same desires I went to a well that changed me from that time my doubts had fell away from that time I'm a changed person I'm a changed human being from the time that I went to the well you know what she done brother Mark when she left out of there because she had met Jesus she met the last man that she'd ever need to meet the Bible says she threw a water pot on the ground and she went into the city hollering come and see a man that's told me all the things that I've ever done she had such a conviction and such a testimony that God had changed her life that the people that met her the Bible says and they believed on him because of her testimony something happened at that well she didn't go she didn't go back home the same woman that left something happened it took place at the well oh friend don't you realize she threw it all down all of her past was thrown down I can just see that Old Devil come around brother Jared say you know what happened to your what happened to all that unbelief you used to have but you can look back at him and say I left it at the well what happened to what happened to you I remember when we used to could get together we could make fun of all them church people and poke fun at them and now you done lost your sense of humor what happened to your sense of humor I left it at the well amen what happened to that old critical spirit that you used to have I left it at the well what happened to that adulterous Spirit you used to carry but but I left it at the well what happened what happened you used to smoke and and drink and and be so much fun to hang out with what happened to all those things I left it at the well used to have a bad temper I left it at the well used to tell everybody off but I left it at the well ain't that the way it is she went to a place and she left her old life she broke it my she just threw it down on the ground I thought my that old thing must have shattered into a million pieces I in my in my mind when I see that image it just turned into dust it just broke into all kinds of chars that it couldn't even be put back together why cuz it was a symbol of her throwing away her old life and and knowing that she didn't have to go draw for any more water had found something that would quench her thirst she was taught by the side of the well oh my she had a well-taught experience brother Mah with Jesus Christ that's what we need when she met him her thirst was quenched quenched by a man that was setting out a well she was well taught amen see brother B said see I see a lot of people today they have a Victorious Life they're always living constantly on a housetop and they're praising God how many knows people like that seems like they're always on fire for God and when you look at those people you say well I wish I could feel that way he said the reason you feel like that is because there's a thirst in you and it's a natural thing for every person to thirst for God now isn't that something it's a natural thing to have a spiritual thirst that's a common thing for you to have a spiritual thirst it's a common thing it's a it's something that every body every that something that we have there's a thirst for God I you know you realize that in the Natural Body our Natural Body thirst for water and here you realize that what that thirst is brother Mark that thirst is a is an alarm it's a sign he says see it's an alarm clock that goes off and it the soul sets off an alarm it's a buzzer inside of you that tells you that death is lurking that if you don't get water pretty soon that you're going to die and it'll get louder and louder until finally you'll keep putting it off and if you keep putting it off then you're going to physically die that's why God gave you that how many how many knows what it's like to be thirsty and that's why God gave you that that ability to thirst and and and and the longer you go without water The Thirst gets greater and greater it's an internal alarm that tells you that your body needs water but if that's that way in the natural you think about it here here that that that's what was taking place in in the Bible in the story of Hagar here she had gone into this into into this Wilderness you realized that Hagar brother Mark that she had never she didn't do anything wrong she hadn't made it wasn't a mistake that she made that put her in that place here she was in the line of duty she done what was asked of her by by by by her her own Master she was a servant she done everything that they asked her to do here she had a child with Abraham she raised the child up the child had been the raised the the way that that he was supposed to be raised but whenever the promise of God had took place in Sarah's life the Bible says that Sarah saw the children together and something happened in her heart that she wanted them to be separated here he was mocking and making fun and she went to Abraham and said you need to get rid of her and and send her out into the Wilderness and I don't want her son to have anything to do with mine the Bible says Abraham went to the Lord and God told Abraham obey the what your wife the desires of your wife he said because I won't let him die out there in the wilderness but I'll allow him to be a great nation but he can't be with Isaac because or or because he he would be a a promised son so so they're going to be separated but he'll still yet be a great nation so the Bible says Abraham goes he rises up and he gives bread and a bottle of water to Hagar and he sent her and the child away and they departed out and wandered Into the Wilderness so here they come into beerseba brother Mark in this hot Wilderness here the the the Desert Sun that was beaten down upon their flesh and they had the bottle of water here she was trying to make her way did not know where she was going wandering around out in this place and after a little while the water that she carried ran out and the water was spent you realize that what took place is after she got to this place of thirst and she realized I imagine as a mother she looked around for water the first few hours without water you you go around looking for a place that I can find water is there a cactus somewhere is there a shade tree somewhere that there's a little bit of water is there's something somewhere I can find and she had searched out until she found that there was nothing else that she could use to quench her thirst all that she had was spent she had looked all that she could look until they were weary and weak and had nowhere else to go and she finally took her son and she put him over in one place and went went went over into another place she said because I can't bear the thought of watching my son lay there and thirst to death and as she went over the only thing left in her her alarm clock had long since gone off in the natural it had long since gone past its time uh that that you're that you're going to die if you don't find water and I can imagine her here she was a woman that was so she she had been misjudged and and misunderstood and she was cast out though she had done nothing wrong she had no place to go here her and her child they were perishing in this place I could imagine the heart of this mother as she begin to cry out to God and say why am I in this kind of condition what have I done to deserve this what what have I done to to get into this place you know you realize that that if she that everything that she done it was right then why would she come to this place if she had obeyed the Lord why would she be in this Wilderness without any water if I if I done what you asked can you imagine the the the request that she had when she called out to God I've done everything you asked me to do I've served every way that I could serve I can't think of a time that I that I that I went the the wrong way or I wasn't obedient I done all that I could do but still yet I found myself hiding under a bush thirsting for water my son hiding over thirsting for water crying out I think that's the way it is many times we look at our situation we look at our sicknesses and and and afflictions and things that come upon us and say why what have I done that would cause this to come upon my life what would I what have I done to cause me to get into this place and this place of thirst in this place of this Wilderness type place what have I done to cause me to be dragged into this place brother said maybe it wasn't something that that we done at all but maybe it was all done just so God could show his grace and his Mercy to you that he could bring you to a crying out place a place that you didn't have no choice but just to trust in God that God could bring bring you to a place you realize as human beings we want to control everything but sometimes God brings you to a place that you have no control because when you have no control you can't do nothing but cry out to God so here he had brought her to this crying out place but the mark in here she could hear I could just hear it as her hearing over her child here he was crying and crying and crying for water after a little while his little voice was so parched and lips parched so dry C they couldn't even cry and it became a a cracked faint of a cry that she heard until eventually The Cry of the lad had completely faded away can you imagine sitting in this place and all that that she just gone through and then as it be to fade there wasn't hardly a sound left and the Bible says but then all of the sudden she heard the voice of an angel my she went from hearing the Cry of her child to hearing the voice of an Angel and he said Hagar what is ailing you why are you weeping for we have heard the voice of the lad where he is here brother Mark she looked at her condition it was hopeless but God said but I've heard the Cry of your children I've heard the Cry of your child and I know you're in this condition that you can't get out of I know you're in this place that you don't have no answer for and you don't know what it was or where you gone wrong in your life you didn't do nothing but serve and you done everything that was asked of you you was a good wife you was a good servant you you brought for children you done all that you was asked to do but you found yourself in this place and God has heard the Cry of your child he knows the needs of your child you believe God knows that tonight he knows the need of your child he said so arise and take the lad and hold him in thy hand and I will make him a great nation what a promise here when she thought all hope was lost her family was lost her children were lost had nothing else to turn to nowhere to turn but then the angel of the Lord he said you hold your child in your hand for I will make of him a great nation here he was confirming the very promise that God had given unto Father Abraham but then watch what happened brother Mark he didn't just leave it in the natural but but but all of a sudden the supernatural begin to take place in her life the Bible says and God opened up her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and she gave the lad something to drink oh my it is something that here in the middle of a desert that God would provide a well of water but Mark here she was the entire time and the well was there she just couldn't see it the very thing she had need of it was laying right before but she couldn't see and many days and hours had gone by that she cried out to God and the answer was laying right before her but then the angel of the Lord came and when God opened her eyes she saw a well of water my isn't there something that the well it was there brother KY even when you can't see it with your natural eye but let me tell you something friends just because you can't see something with your natural eye it don't mean that it isn't there I believe that God directed her path I believe that God led her to that place in the wilderness why because God had placed a well there that she would sit right under that very Bush when she was wandering around and taking those misguided footsteps and searching around for water and completely lost and didn't know where to go but God was leading her to The Well of water a woman in a line of duty thirsting for something that she didn't even know was there all of a sudden her eyes were open and she saw the well you know what she would call that well later it would be called beer laar Roy which means The Well of him that liveth and seeth me now what a name of a well that had provided salvation for the mark whenever all hope was lost I thought what a powerful Revelation she had in her greatest time of need that God opened her eyes to a well that would satisfy her thirst and he revealed to her that God was still alive in her greatest time of need look what God is showing her by by by her own confession by naming this well The Well of him that liveth and seeth me but I'm actually showing you what a revelation was that God came in my time of need and he revealed himself to me that he is still a God and he's still alive and not only is he a living God but he saw me in my condition he saw my child he saw the needs of my family he saw me when I was laying under the bush and I had no way out he saw our bottle it was Spin and we were a thirst and dying in that place not only is he a living God but he's a God that sees me amen what a revelation to have to reveal unto her I live and I see you friend how makes me want to shout all over this building he's a God that liveth and he's a God that sees you right he's a God that knows the very challenges that you face and the things that go on in your heart and in your mind in the middle of the night when you want to give up and throw up your hands and say I can't go another mile but he's a God that liveth and seeth me amen I wonder how many tonight that thirst for something that they just can't seem to find thirsting for a closer walk with God or thirsting to hear the voice of God or to see the supernatural or to see can I just be real with you to see past the bush that I've been laying under to see past this Wilderness and this this place that I that I've hid I I've been wandering alone in this Wilderness thirsting for a way out thirsting for something that you just can't find just not a natural thirst for the cow it's a spiritual thirst David said as a deer panth after the water Brooks so my soul longth after thee say see he's longing to have a life of victory longing to overcome that's where we are longing to be victorious longing to be able to be a a real believer and to get through this this life the the hard pressures of this life he said a man never knows what it is to live a Victorious life until he's completely overcome himself you see we got to get to a place to get past this big enemy that's getting in our way to keep us from seeing the things of God brother Jared we have a great big enemy it's this flesh we have a great big enemy it's the worst enemy we how many believes that the worst enemy you have is you when you you know why you can't do nothing for God because of you you know why you can't ever get nowhere because of you you know why you can't grow because of you it ain't nobody it's because of us we're the worst enemy that we have said the biggest enemy you have is yourself that's why you can't rise up in faith because you're the reason that you can't overcome there's an intellectual part of you brother Mark that stops you from receiving the things of God there's an intellectual part that stop stops us from being Believers and it stops us from overcoming it reminds me I know I run out of time but it reminds me of that that man in India that came up for prayer that was blind and here he come up in that prayer line I remember whenever they they brought him up to the prayer line I wanted to hide behind the pull pit cuz what could a natural man do to help a man that was blind in his natural eyes there was nothing I could say there was nothing I could do there was nothing I could quote there was I had no ability to give him back his eyesight and they said the the the the man that brought him had heard in the preaching of the word that God was a God that could do the impossible and God was a God that could open blinded eyes and God was a God that could part Waters and two million people walk across he was a God that could do the Supernatural and he wasn't dead but he was still alive the man got up and he walked out of the meeting and he went down the street and he found his old buddy that was a blind man and he brought him back into the house of God because he believed that God was a God that could do the supernatural you know what I did brother Mark after I got out from hiding behind the pull pit I thought the only thing I knew to do is to tell him what Jesus had already done and I started telling testimonies of every man I could ever think of that Jesus had laid hands on that had received their eyesight I told him about the one where he took the mud and he made it into an eyeball and he put it in his socket I told him about how he sent the man to the pool of salom and told him you go wash and when you wash you'll come see it and then I told him about how that same Jesus came right down in the town that I was borned in and gave a little girl her eyes side back through the voice of a prophet of God and how that I heard that testimony my whole life and then I asked him this question I said do you do you know Jesus he said I've heard of him but I've never met him yeah I thought what an answer I've heard about him but I've never met him I said well friend let me introduce you to him cuz that same Jesus that healed them is standing here right now and he can still heal you do you believe that he raised up his hand I said do you will you you will you serve a God that could open your eyes he said yes I will and he sat there and I prayed for him brother Mark the brothers come and prayed with him and he left out of that meeting I thought I'll never hear nothing about him never see nothing about him no more because there's so many you go from meeting to meeting but that night we were having another service and here in the middle of that service I watched that man walk in that building he was wasn't being led by nobody there wasn't nobody leading him through the crowd brother Mark I noticed he was watching so closely to the ground and he came up to some wires that were laying there going across the speakers and I watched I I I I turn I cut loose when I watched that man come up to those speaker wires and step his foot over the top of them wires I thought my god there was a trip haiser laying in the floor that that would show that something had taken place in his life here he he could faintly a little bit see just enough he come through there and you know in his arm I've got a picture of it in in his arm he had his little wife in one arm and then on the other side of her with his mother-in-law he came all the way to the front of the building interrupted the whole service and the brother I said oh y'all let him let him alone I came down there sir can I help you he said well my wife and my mama they want to serve him too I thought my God what a testimony that's the same thing that happened on the side of the well that day she went away with a testimony and they believed on him because of her testimony later on I got an email from the pastor he said that man his eyesight is perfectly well it took a few weeks and few months had gone by until it developed where he could he could see just like anybody else I remember that man's testimony he said he wanted to tell you this and I was already gone but whenever he stood there that day and I asked him I told him that Jesus was standing there and he could do the same thing for him that he had done for those other people that blind man that didn't know anything about Jesus Jesus had barely ever heard the name of Jesus in his life didn't know where he come from or couldn't tell you one thing about him but that blind man when I said he's standing here and he can do the same thing for you he done for them that blind man thought he was standing there and we couldn't see him because we are looking through a natural eye but that man had no natural sight so when I said he's standing here he thought that man was standing there that I was telling him about he thought that man laid hands upon him that I was telling him about he felt the same hand that put the eye in the socket of the man down there by the river in Galilee it was a same Jesus because he had no natural sight to keep him from receiving the promise of God my is't that something here it was something that he couldn't see see we we have to get out of our own way but Mark sometimes we're the worst enemy that we have I can't see God so God must not be there I can't see the pillar of fire it must not be present I can't see the supernatural there must not be no Supernatural it ain't got nothing to do with our natural sight see see if we could get out of our own way we might could receive something from the Lord the Bible says trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lead not unto thy own understanding see once you overcome your flesh your spirit your feelings your emotions then you'll have a life of Victory you want to be free you have to overcome you your feelings all this old leading that you had this is what happened to that Samaritan woman she was taught in the scripture she knew the coming of a messiah she believed that it would happen in her day enough that she could receive it whenever he came and you realize all it took was one little Messiah sign of him saying he said are you go get your husband she said I have no husband he said you've spoken true because you've had five husbands and the one that you're with now is not your own and because of that sign of discernment she recognized it as the Messiah she see so when she knew the promise she knew what the Messiah would be and when she seen the promise fulfilled but ra said it opened her eyes when she saw the promise fulfilled her eyes came open said see before that her eyes had been closed with sin but she saw the promise of God fulfilled in her day and it opened her eyes he says see when she saw the Messiah he would come when he do those things or he'll do those things he said I am he her eyes were open and she has eternal life now because her eyes were open then she sat on the side of the well and her eyes opened up to a revelation of Jesus Christ she knew the prophecy she knew the scripture of the Messiah but on the side of a well her eyes were open to a reality that Jesus Christ was in her midst so many that we could go through tonight I don't have time that eyes were open whenever they met him philli his eyes was open the disciples Peter's nathaniels their eyes were open but said but what has it done to our eyes in this day a promise fulfilled has it opened your eyes you realize the word of the scriptures that's been fulfilled in the day we live in John 14:12 he said verily I say unto you as the music players come I say unto you that he believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father that scripture has been Vindicated in the day that we live in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and for ever how many believe that's been proven in this day I said how many believe that's been proven in this day he's the same yesterday today and forever Luke 17 said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man how many believe that we're living in that day amen it's been manifested in this age Malachi 4 said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord how many believe what we're living in that day all of those scriptures brother Mark that's been fulfilled right before us and then watch here's the question that's all been fulfilled but what has it done to our eyes You' seen the promises of God has it opened your eyes to see a revelation of Jesus Christ a true reality of who it is that you're following after not a organization or man or a church but to follow after Jesus Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost but a Mark that would come in our midst to this age say see when you see the works of God you recognize it how many say this today you recognized it as a sign of the Messiah alive today do you realize that that same Jesus is still alive same God he's still The Works that same well is present before us tonight beer lroy it's present the god that liveth and seeth me he said see after seeing these things if it doesn't open your eyes it'll blind them eternally cuz it opens some and it blinds others isn't that the Bible remember when Jesus went and he went up braid in the cities because they had seen the mighty works of God and he said great will be the Judgment that comes upon you because the works that have been done in your city if the works that had been done in capernium were done in Sodom Sodom would still be here today because they would never went into that he said you're worse off than they were cuz you've seen the mighty works of God but still yet you sin listen what Jesus is showing us that sin and unbelief is one thing but sin and unbelief after seeing the works of God is another thing sin is one thing but sin after seeing the works of God is a far another thing he said God judgment shall be more tolerable to Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee because they didn't see the works of God Like You you've seen he said but I thank thee Oh Lord because you have hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes I say may God give us Grace tonight that we respond to the word that we hear that he would give us Grace to receive the the revelation of the word of God and receive Rapture in faith that he would put a put a put a a thirst in us that would bring us to the Wells of salvation [Music] a well of Revelation Brother Kyle if you want to stand to your feet tonight he said we could go on and on but let's just think
