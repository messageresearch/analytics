if you would just want to say it's an honor to be here with you and amen to have this moment together know how many more moments we have upon this Earth but um I don't know about you but I'm looking for a body change and I'm looking for our Lord to come back amen I'm sorry I can't hardly handle a code if you don't mind amen so uh we we're just really thankful though to the Lord to be serving him in this time that we're living in and and it's a great time amen you know brother Brandon would say it's a terrible time and then if you're in there you say yeah it's a terrible time there a lot of things going wrong a lot of lot of issues in the country we're living in and the world but then you continue the quote he said but a wonderful time for the believer because it's one of the greatest times ever be living on the face of this Earth is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and so we're looking for that I I bring you greetings for I'm home church and my father brother the Tim and just said to be sure and greet you this morning Luke chapter 8 and vers vers 22 now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launch launched forth and as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a strong or a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in Jeopardy and they came to him and awoke him and said master master we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and the Raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and the water and they obey him amen we'll let you be seated today amen also thankful to have my wife sister Ruth here with us and see a lot of people here friends amen from Arizona goodness you must have knew I was preaching today wasn't a baby dedication they come for amen no amen we love brother Michel and his family and and then we got some burges is here too brother amen I'm just so thankful to have everyone and a lot of you I don't know I've met maybe didn't see your faces and and I remember a lot of faces I have a lot of trouble remember names you know I'm getting up in age we're at the point that we don't even have kids that go with us anymore uh you know uh you used to travel with all your children and things and now they're married and amen we got a we got a grandchild coming on the way so that's a new phase of life that we're looking forward to and and uh but you know we're we none of us would have ever expected to still be here uh but I'm thankful to know that it wasn't on my time but it's on God's time because if God would have came many times in the time that we expected him to come amen many of you wouldn't even be here today many of you would have still been in a lost condition or or not even born into this world but God has waited because he has a time and and an hour for his his appearing and we nobody knows the exact moment or the exact time but we do know he is coming amen and we we we are declaring that this morning that there is a Rapture that is going to take place is not a fairy tale it's not a a sand castle that you build and and it's just a bunch of sand nothing to it but it is the realities of God because it's spoken his word and God's word will be performed he will fulfill what he has said this morning I would like to speak to you on Faith's decree uh a decree is an official order issued by a legal Authority and I I got this from uh just I was listening to a tape and heard brother brandham quote this song he said there is a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever and we only reach that Shore by Faith's decree we only reach that sweet Forever by Faith's decree by the word of God Amen that place that is so impossible this morning to even describe he would go there and have that experience of going Beyond and he said I I can't hardly describe how wonderful it is over there and how how amazing and the love and all that he couldn't even put hardly put it into words you know and we haven't even been there and if we did go we would come back and and it would be hard for us to describe the grander and the beauty that awaits a Believer who goes to that place and you know that's one thing that gives me Comfort you know to as as you think about the experience that brother brandham had when we when we lose our loved ones you know we grieve and and we mourn and when we suffer great loss but you know they're not over there grieving for us they're not over there missing us they're not over there you know worried about us and all of that and he say he would actually say is he would look back there at his body laying there on on that bed and and he would see his hands behind his head and he was laying beside his wife there were children in the Next Room that he loved very much but his heart was not upon his wife or his children his heart was to stay there he didn't want to go back he said do I have to go back to that Old Rag again to that old body again because it was such a wonderful place and and and we know that we are looking for that and we're going to experience that very soon no doubt but we will only see it by living by faith speaking by faith speaking face decree so what is face decree a decree is an official order given by a legal Authority it is the decree is the word of God the word of God is what faith speaks amen amen you may speak a lot of things but if you're speaking your feelings you're not speaking by faith amen you're speaking by feelings but we want to speak the word of God and that's where faith will find this resting fa resting place see Faith always looks to the word faith places itself on the unmovable Rock God's Eternal Word Faith doesn't look at reasons I don't care how much you can show maybe something would be better but if the word says no faith rests right there if the word says yes Faith rests right there that is the sanctuary of Faith resting place now we can rely on hope we can have hope but when you have just hope in your heart You Hinder Faith Hope looks for something way off I hope I'll get there I hope I'll be there but Faith looks as it as right now cuz Faith is the substance of things hoped for amen it it Faith claims it right now faith says God said so and it's settled it's finished it's mine I don't care what the devil says or anybody else says amen faith says God said it I believe it it's finished amen so that settles it you know I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick I don't care it has nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's my possession it's mine right now why cuz God said it was mine and not it's not mine because I feel like it is mine or I think it's mine it is mine because God's word said it is mine therefore I believe it hope says what God said so and I'm expecting it to get it someday I I'm expecting someday for it to happen but as long as Satan can put you into another day as long as he can push you off to another service or or another to another moment just as just as just as good as he wants he he just don't want you to realize it's yours today it's your moment right now you know if you never get it just believe that you know you know you know Satan's always like the you know putting the carrot out in front of the horse that he never gets there it's always out there in front of you you one day I can be a Christian one day I'll be good enough one day I I'll be a Son of God one no today God is PR declared that's who I am I am healed why not because I feel I'm Healed I'm Healed because his word declares I'm Healed I I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved because his word declares I'm say Amen so this is where you got to put it Faith acts now it's positive amen you know sickness or everything else when Faith steps in he said it's like a snowball on a hot stove it melts away everything everything goes away from Faith cuz Faith stands up and takes over the rule When Faith speaks everything else keeps still he said that little old sickness is Burling around and making big challenges and saying well days of Miracles are passed or it'll be another Serv or or this that and the other another day it might happen but let step Faith step up one time and pull his muscles up and say I'm here to take over he said I'm telling you everything else will keep still When Faith speaks amen that's what we want this morning we don't want our feelings to speak we don't want our thoughts to speak we don't want even a man from Louisiana to speak we want the faith of almighty God to speak amen faith has a voice a decree has no power unless it's de declared and it has no power declared unless it has something to back it up amen therefore I'm thankful I'm not here declaring the words of just a seventh grade educated Kian or just the words of some man that wrote A Few scriptures but I'm here declaring the word of almighty God and there is something that is here that'll back up what he said he said in Matthew 17 and verse 20 Jesus said if you have faith you shall say to this mountain I love how he puts that brother M he don't say go get a preacher and speak go let him speak for you go let somebody he said if you say to this mountain how many you's are here to this morning if you say to this mountain amen this mountain see this mountain must hear your voice not just a preacher's voice this ain't all about a preacher this ain't all about a prophet amen it's all about God coming in flesh in this hour that we're living in and that mountain hearing your voice so the action the Bible of faith is speaking the word of God the decree and standing on your statement of faith Jesus said if you have faith you will speak so there's no such a thing as just silently believing come on somebody well I I just not me well there's no such a thing as silently believing what you believe will come out amen if you don't have enough confidence to say it then you really don't believe it come on somebody body Jesus said he said if if you have faith as grain of a mustard seed you'll say to the sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you if you have faith and don't doubt you say to this mountain it shall it shall happen so according to Jesus for Faith to operate it must be released through a spoken word hallelujah what you speak is the evidence of your faith another way of saying it is your speech really reveals what you truly believe come on somebody amen 2 Corinthians 4: 13 says but having the same Spirit of Faith according to what is written I believe therefore I speak we also believe therefore we also speak so if you believe you will therefore speak you know uh Luke chapter 6 and verse 45 we'll go through through a few uh scriptures here a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth which is good and the evil man out of the evil Treasure's heart bringing forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh Amen in Luke or Matthew 12 and: 34 he says you old Generation of Vipers how can you be an evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things an evil man out of the evil treasure bring forth evil things but I say unto you that that Every Idle word that men shall speak shall give account thereof in the day of judgment and I got to looking at this word this what is it mean by Idle Word Idle Word is insincere language of a person who speaks one thing but means another amen do you know that God bless you can be an Idle Word if it's inere insincere and and you mean you speak one thing but you mean another come on somebody or you don't really mean it amen this is what an idle word for by thy words th shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned so it's very much there's a very much of power that goes with what words we speak in our lives amen so out of the abundance of the heart the mouth is speaking now amen you know I want to talk about a man that was named fimon that's in the Bible and Paul would speak about him in the first chapter and he would he would thank God and make mention of him in his prayers and he said I've heard of your love and I've heard of your faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus then he said that that toward and toward all saints that the communication of thy faith may be effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the Saints are refreshed by the amen by what the communication of his faith by what he spoke amen by what he said amen I I want to be a refreshing Christian I want to be somebody that when they come around they're refreshed because I have something good to say and it ain't my own thoughts or what I think about something it's what God's word says about it amen see thoughts become words and words become actions amen I want to be a refreshing Christian amen that somebody can come and get a fresh drink of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I don't want to be so gomed up with everything and hard feelings and situations that's happened here and there and that's all I'm thinking about that's all I'm dwelling on that's all I'm looking at but I want to be looking at the word of God that if there's Church troubles I want to be looking at the word of God Amen if there's situations I don't know how to handle or I don't know what to do or I don't know where to turn I want to be looking at the word of God Amen so amen it's very powerful if you look at how much power our tongue has now just go into this for a moment Proverbs 18 and verse 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue yeah buckle up just for a moment moment they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof what the scripture is saying is the words you speak have the ability to give life to a person or a situation however they also have the ability to kill and destroy amen the scripture is a simple reminder of how much our words matter amen so out of your mouth you have the ability to build up or tear down you have the ability to motivate or discourage you have the ability to lift people higher or drag them down lower out of the out of the abundance of the mouth to inspire to Greatness or to push them to mediocrity all because of the words that are coming out of your mouth this is life and death that is in the power of the tongue right am amen hallelujah amen Matthew again 12 and: 37 says for by thy words thou shall be justified or by thy words Thou shalt be condemned so our words are very important how we speak is very important how we speak to each other is very important how we speak man to wife is very important husband to wife how we speak uh father to daughters and sons and mothers is very important amen how we speak about our church and our church people it's very important amen we got to make sure we ain't dwelling on negativity cuz I can promise you the devil is always there to show negativity he is always there to tear down and to tear down the preacher and tear down the deacons and tear down the music and tear down and tear down and tear down that's his job I don't want to be accomplice to the words of the devil but I want to be guilty of lifting up guilty of building up and saying you can make it you will make it amen this church will stand amen so in Hebrews chapter 4 and verse1 14 seeing that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession Hebrews 10:23 says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise and Psalms 19 and verse1 14 it says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength My Redeemer amen I you know I I've seen I've you know I've seen it over I've been down the road a lot I good Lord I'm getting close to too close to 50 I never thought I would even think that but here we are and so you go down the road a little while you know and you see a lot of things I I've seen men that have actually tore down uh uh the ministry over sitting around a table and they they NE they're negative about what this done and how you handled this and that and they're spewing it out to their children and then it tears them down to where they don't have confidence in the ministry and then their children get in trouble and they want the ministry to help when they can't help no more because there ain't no confidence there and it wasn't tore down by anybody else but the father the mother sitting around disputing out all this negative I I don't know why I'm here but this is where we at I I just know the devil loves to work behind the scenes over time trying to destroy the work of God and he's always there trying to tear this and tear that and pick against this and pick against listen we're not here for our feelings to be petted we're not here to just get a pat on the back and say you're doing good we're here to hear the word of God and if God wants to come and tear us apart and it needs to be tore out of our life let it be so [Applause] Proverbs 6 and verse 2 says Thou Art snared with the words of thy mouth and thou art taken with the words of thy mouth Proverbs 13 and3 said he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life W amen good bible study this morning brother Timothy thank you Thou Art taken with the w but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction well I just need I just got to say something well you don't have to you know that's that's a big problem with a lot of people they don't they don't have no filter what there is a filter it's a thinking man's Filter Hey I I feel like I'm home this morning I'm sorry amen you know we we I just got to say it I got no you don't have to say it amen think on things that are good and of a good report amen Proverbs 15 and4 says a whol tongue which is a healing tongue a wholesome tongue is the tree of life but perverse perverseness therein is the breach of the spirit Amen brother R say it like this he said let him that's weak say I'm strong hey it works it works you know my mother went through that all that brain trauma and she was in a in in a she she couldn't do anything she was in a in the ICU and not responding and the doctor come in to give my dad the M the news and and he's standing there and giving him all the news and he says he says she's not she's not going to she's not going to respond she's done and dad says Karen let the weak say and she goes I'm [Music] strong that doctor looked at look at brother Tim he said well look like you're doing more good here than I amise Lord amen why amen even in that weaken condition her faith was I'm strong amen I I just preached at home about those that died in faith I want if God takes me by the way of the Grave I want to be a testimony that I died in faith listen when people die of sickness it ain't because they didn't have faith it was their faith that took them there let him that's weak say I'm strong but I'm a weak Christian I I don't have a let him say I'm strong why are you saying that because the word says that Amen brother Brandon would he would try to eat that uh bowl of beans and onions you remember the story and and the doctor told him he ate it again he's going to die and he said well I just believe God's word and he took it and he just ate it and he started regurgitating and coming up and he's swallowing it back down saying but I'm Healed by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he'd go back and he swallow it back down in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm Healed and he said somebody said I was making a mockery out of that he said I wasn't making no mockery I wasn't saying it because I felt healed or I thought I was here he said I was saying it because that's what God's word said listen you always have the right as a Christian to speak God's word but the devil wants to make you think well it's just your feelings or that's just you that's just you saying it no I'm saying what God said I'm speaking what God said listen if we can ever get to the place that we quit speaking our feelings or our fear or our unbelief and we only speak what his word says then things will take place in our lives he says see I am strong I have now accepted Jesus as my healer never have any negative testimony just believe it God is under obligation he Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the father to accept what you say he said sitting there as the high priest of our confession to make good before the father anything that he died for that you're confessing that he's done now healing is not something that you just say well I I believe it I believe that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally say I believe it and I accept it but then if you accept it on these these basis then you just keep saying it over and over say it out loud come on say it out loud I'm here and he keeps saying it say it over and over I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until you actually believe it and he said when you believe it then something's going to take place he said but don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess well I still feel bad today and you go right straight back to the same rut you was in the beginning that's not a man or woman that's been baptized with the Holy Spirit but would start that your convers your confession saying I believe I've lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone for me and you'll go right down that's right don't ever have a negative testimony amen you can look that up as many times don't ever have no negative testimony Jesus has healed me I'm well it is finished come on somebody Jesus has healed me I'm well it is finished it is over with I'm not dealing with that no more yeah I may still have the symptoms but symptoms are liars his word is the truth and his word says I'm Healed therefore I'm Healed his word says I'm saved therefore I'm saved his word says I'm a son or daughter of God therefore I am a son or daughter of God don't ever have no negative testimony testify positive Jesus has healed me and I'm well amen you go on and you'll receive your healing no matter how you're feeling if you go to feeling and you know go back to that every time that you have a negative testimony every time you look at the symptoms then you fall back that's not a Christian amen that's not a Christian is no matter how solid you are in faith is right now that something's happened to get you a hold of you to tell you're not a Christian you start out testify well I'm not a Christian no more and you'll drop right back you're no more a Christian as soon as you testify that you've Fallen amen see it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say come on somebody that's just what the devil wants you to say I'm not a very good Christian amen you must never say that direct quote you must never say that don't never let your testimony be be negative let it be positive all the time I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart with all my heart it's finished and let your testimony always your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come to your mind if you can help it and if it does come don't entertain it sure the devil's going to put negative thoughts to in your mind towards a Ministry towards whatever it goes on this church all kind of negative thought but you ain't got to entertain that thought amen amen he wants to come and he wants to stop you and he wants to he wants to put Nest on your in your head he want it's like he like a bird flying over your head you know he said you can't keep it from flying over but you can keep it from building a nest how many of you there's there's there's these birds called barn swallows I hate them I'll just be honest with you they're on the I think the protected list but they need to be off they make a mess on your house here y'all have them up here we got them bad down in Louisiana and they build a nest on the side of your house and they build it out of mud and they'll stand it'll stand it's a mud I don't know where they get the stuff from or how they build it it's incredible and they build this mud Nest right on the side of your house and then they begin to poop down sorry that's what they do and they just make a mess and it's all down the side of your house you can get a pressure washer and you can try to pressure and you can try to pressure and you can't hardly getting stuff off it's worse than dirt dobbers and thing it's inter it's it's incredible what they can do and how destructive they can be but I found out one thing that'll keep that from happening is don't let them build there well how do you do that well a shotgun you don't have to put this on the internet that's all the way you can do it get rid of it amen and when when it comes by you just take your shotgun bam and it's over with they ain't got the strength to building this no more they can't pick up a piece of mud no more they can't do anything no more well poor little birds I and I've seen people they got that attitude poor little thing and they allow it to just mess all over their house right I I I went up to somebody's house the other day and they had a little one of them nests right there on the front porch and it was just a mess everywhere and the sister was like I couldn't not have no hard I said pH that ain't my house my house I got the heart y'all might be some tree huggers here I don't know but I'm I'm I'm going offend some people I'm sure but listen I I'm not dealing with their mess I got something that'll take care of it I got something that'll get rid of it listen I and bring it over to the other side I've seen people coming to the house of God with Nest all in their hair and they got Nest this high they bump the door coming in the back cuz all the negativity and all the things and all the stuff that's been going on and God give them the ability to get rid of it before he got there amen you say how well there's a shotgun it's a double barell shotgun and it's full of bullets that you can fire at your enemy and say devil you don't have a right here this is the body the Temple of the Holy Ghost I don't have to listen to your nonsense [Applause] amen see you speak what you believe in your heart ah yeah you know you can pretend for a while and lie you know and say things and you really don't believe it but when your guard is down and you speak without thinking you will say what you believe well I just want to give him a piece of my mind how many pieces you got left amen some sooner or later you're going to run out of pieces Romans 10 verse 8 said but what saith that the word of not is n the word is n the even in the mouth in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that it sh th Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Sh believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead and thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth un righteousness but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so where is the word of faith it's in the heart and in the mouth amen for for Faith to work properly it must be in both places amen what you believe in your heart must be expressed through your mouth for it to produce salvation means Deliverance so this is the way the scripture tells us people can be delivered and set free by believing it in their heart and saying it in their mouth Amen brother Tom Ray told me one time he was preaching along these lines and speak to your mountain and he said as he was speaking the spirit of God got to moveing and up in the balcony there a a little lady stood up just in the middle of his sermon she just got so overwhelmed by and she said I believe my family saved in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said that we watched as God moved Time After Time After Time till he brought them all in and gave him the Holy Ghost amen what was it it was believing in the heart but it can't just stay there it has to be spoken out of your lips it has to be released there's a power that has to be released your words have power this is why he would say to the the disciples he says who does man who do men say that I am and some say well you're John the Baptist some say Elias some say Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said well who do you say really don't matter what anybody else thinks is what do you think amen you know what do you think you're going to get out of this service come on it ain't really mattering what anybody else thinks what do you think amen you know uh what are you expecting to receive and Simon answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed you didn't learn this from your mom and dad amen but my Father which is in heaven and I say to thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll be of my church upon what rock not Peter but the revelation of who Jesus was or is amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I'll give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven see Faith spoke and power was released hallelujah hallelujah Faith decreed and power to was loose amen was given to loose and to bind because a man spoke what he believed Peter believed it because there was many there was 70 that walked away from him he said You shall eat my flesh and drink my blood and they was that's a hard saying what is he talking about and they left and Jesus looked at them said will you go also and Peter said where else are we going to go only you have the words of eternal life that's what I say to all these people that wants to walk away from this message I I see where it's LED you to I ain't going I'm not going that direction I've seen what it's LED your children to and where they're at amen I've seen preachers that were once great men in this message that walked away and now their children are homosexuals and all kinds of stuff that's going on I'm not going there where else are we going to go that's what I want to ask people when they say well I I just want I just want to learn more about Jesus well what Jesus there's all kinds of jesuses but there's only one true reveal G Lord Jesus Christ and this message has brought it in a reality in such a place that we have to say where else would we go there's nothing better there's no other place to go to but I know what he did for me I know how he bound the sin that was in my life and he loose the Holy Ghost upon me amen I know what he did in my life he called me out of Darkness he called me out of sin he called me out of unbelief and he filled me and made me his son I know what he did for me listen this Jesus Christ is in the building to perform Miracles how many believes he's in the building I believe he's in the building you know why I believe it because it's worth say he is I don't believe it because I felt something cuz listen you're not always going to come to church and feel something sometimes you ain't going to feel like coming to church preachers don't always feel like preaching come on just the truth brother Joe you always feel like preaching no brother Matt you always feel I I don't always feel like it no I today I didn't feel like it but I ain't come here on my feelings this is not about my feelings it's about him if we'll get it out of our heads at churches about our feelings then we can have a lot more church and God to be more Freer to move in our lives when we realize it ain't about my feelings if I feel good if I feel bad if my feelings are hurt if they're lifted up it ain't got nothing to do with my feelings it's all to do with his word yes amen I know he's I know he's here cuz he said he would be where two or three are gathered in his name that's what we're gathered in we're not gathered in the name of this church or the name of Matt Morris or Timothy pu we're gathered in the name of Jesus Christ amen then they he says when he when he's he's here to perform Miracles but he does it through his church hello through his church I I he he didn't say his preachers or his prophet he said his church he said his people amen his church his people they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits the commission is given to the church that's what he said that's what's a matter with the church today it don't know his position but if you know positionally who you are and what you are there wouldn't be a feeble person in here that next 5 minutes we got a lot to unlock we got a lot of untap resources amen you wouldn't be a feeble person in here the next five minutes the thing of it is we're looking off into the Millennium or something else to happen when it's already here now we're sons of God not we will be we are right now now we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus not we will be we are right now now oh if you only recognize that the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every preacher uh no he said to every believer how many Believers we got in here every believer anything you desire anything you have need of the only thing you got to do is ask and you shall receive it whatsoever things you desire you pray believe you receive it and it shall be given unto you that is the truth I told the testimony before but we we had that little girl come up here to in a prayer line at our church on a Wednesday night brother Wayne Lawson was there and and and she just said I want my brother back he's been out in sin brother Wayne and brother Tim they was praying I was leading singing said he's out there and he's just come back home out of the college and he's he's been in all kinds of stuff said I just want him back I want him in the house of God and I want our family back together she began to speak those things prayer went forth spirit of God was sent after him oh yeah he went right from 546 White Oak Road dropped right down over in his neighborhood there that boy was laying in bed and he woke up and he realized I ain't heard mom and dad come home and he looked around and he said man what time is it it's 11:00 they should be home by now and he jumps up runs into their room and they ain't there his sister ain't there and he said my I I I got to go see and he jumps in his truck it's raining and pouring down he flies across town to another brother's house he ain't there he goes another over to another house he said and he that brother wasn't there he said man I done miss the Rapture and he flies down this little pig trail of a road by like what y'all got out there and he's flying down he runs off hits a hits a bunch of fence knocks a 100t of fence down and tears his transmission up and it just cripples and it comes right into church falls apart that truck died right there in the parking lot they had to get a tow truck or something to take it off he couldn't even move not another moment and he falls out of the truck and there's this brother out there on it's now almost midnight and his brother out there with a baby and he's like what in the world and this boy falls out of this truck and he's stilling his pajamas he didn't care he said I got another chance he said they're still here I got a chance and he started running to the house of God and he come in there and boy I knew it as I was singing I looked up and in the back door here comes Justin draped over a couple of deacons they brought him down to the altar they prayed over that boy and God come down and so cleansed his life in a few moments his family was around the altar his family was around the altar brother Mike where's Dad said you know it's kind of funny he said he said we're about around the altar we got through praying Justin knew how his daddy was his dad's out of the Navy ex ex Navy gu so he's real particular about some things he said dad I run the truck right there at the altar he said Dad brother Mike laughed he said Justin I ain't worried about that truck all I know is I got my boy back I got my son back I'm worried about that he said I could care less about that other stuff listen that boy today is still serving God got a wife and now a new baby on the way listen if God could do it for him he got that for little girl that would say I want my brother back and God would move on the sea what could he do for us this morning if we would allow our mouth to release our faith and speak the word of God so well I don't know brother Tim what brother brand says it like this says which has greater Authority greatest Authority and a angel from heaven or an angel in the pull pit he said an angel at the pull pit yes sir amen Paul said if an angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel than this that I've already preached let him be a curse so Thea the so the angel Anointed with the Holy Spirit and with the word stands next to God in heaven his authority all powers in Heaven and Earth is given to my hand go and I'll go with you what if you loose on Earth I'll bind in he or I'll loose on Heaven whatever you bind in on Earth I'll bind in heaven he said if the holy go holy church if the great holy church only realized this power to do these things now notice he talks about the angel the pull pit but he didn't leave it right there he said if the great holy church only realized his power to do these things but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church will never stand upright but when every talk of fear oh talk of fear is vanished sir listen you can't help help having thoughts of fear or thoughts of unbelief or thoughts of Doubt but don't ever let them thoughts become talk cuz that's when it's got power when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is complete control of the church all those fears gone that church has the power power and they have everything that heaven owns behind them amen we're not in this alone you are not by yourself this church is not by itself the bride around this world is not by theel matter of fact there's more with us than there is against us amen you say well brother Timothy there's a lot of cancer there's a lot of fears there's a lot of anxieties there's a lot of all sin there there's so so much of it seem like every I don't know a person anymore that ain't affected by cancer or some kind of sickness but let me tell you there's more healing than there is sickness there's more joy than there is sorrow there's more salvation than there is sin there's more for us than there is against us and if God be for us who can be against us no weapon formed against you will prosper but it'll fall to the ground whenever talk of fear is vanished they have everything that heaven owns behind them they're ambassadors of the throne the ambassador of Christ has the authority and anything that Christ own belongs to that Ambassador he said go ye into all the world you're my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and what is a witness it is an ambassador now I've been overseas a lot and they got ambassadors to countries and we've watched Even in our governments how they backed off and let people get killed and stuff because you know what for political reasons or whatever and that Ambassador thinking he's got the authority of the country behind them then the country moves back the this country is going to move back it may do a lot of things but one thing God won't do he will never move back from you no he'll stay right there matter of fact if you find yourself without God you go back to where you left left him amen so he will never back back up from a fight he will never back up from a battle he never pulls back and say well just see if you can handle this one no he's there all the time he's moving all the time he's helping all the time where would we be if it wasn't for him this morning a lot of us would be out on the streets a lot of us probably be dead in the graveyard somewhere amen if it wasn't for God moving in our hearts and our Liv and many times we don't even think about it but God is always orchestrating things sometimes we get all upset because you know we're delayed a little bit and meanwhile God's blocking you from something you don't ever know what's behind the scenes but all you got to put is in your mind and heart and confession is all things work together for the good all things but to be an ambassador amen the whole powers of Heaven is right in your hands it's not in heaven it's in your hands but the church will still will still sit bar and we sit dormant is because we don't recognize what we have he said when the least of his Believers no matter how long how little whatever you are the least of his Believers is in him all evil is under you Christ is the head of the body wherever the head is the bodies with it amen we saw his head in heaven the cloud was signifying his head but where's his body it's on Earth amen showed it Revelations 10 he had a head in heaven but his body came down on Earth and he put one foot upon the land and one foot upon the sea showing he had dominion over every Power but who's represented by that body you are amen it ain't just one man Christ it's his body on Earth operating as he would operate healing as he would heal deliver as he would deliver yes sir well brother Timothy I'm Just a Nobody well maybe you are maybe you're nothing but the souls on the maybe that's all you are just the souls on his feet but when that foot goes down every Devil's under you you might be that's why he'd say the least the least believer would get down on his knees every devil in hell trembles that's right amen see he don't get out of his word where Jesus is the church is with him he stays with the word watch it make it manifest his church is with him well brother brandom I'm the least one that's the souls of his feet remember he triumphed with you he triumphed over every bit of even The Souls of his feet every sickness listed every devil every Power even death itself is under your feet amen I don't feel he said I don't even feel like I'm 52 this morning that's the truth if I can just get the church to see it brother we'll be Tri Tri triumphant Church Believers in him all evil under him you say well brother brandom I have no power neither do I I have no power well brother bradam I'm a weakling so am I aren't you glad a prophet would admit that kind of stuff amen but I'm not depending on my strength it ain't my strength I'm depending on the authority that's been given me I'm not strong I'm not I'm not very strong he but he is strong and I am his and that's all that matters so maybe you are weak this morning maybe it don't feel like much this morning but why don't you just lift yourself up and say I am a son and daughter of God I don't have to be bound by this depression I don't have to be bound by this fear I don't have to be bound by this anxiety I can Rise Above It In The Name of Jesus Christ it is under my feet he said just like he said in Louisville said be cars zooming up and down the highway 60 mes an hour everybody just rushing and hustling and buffing bustling around and one little man walk out there raise his hand blow his whistle and Brace that little man ain't got power to stop one car but he's got Authority amen glory it ain't his power well if one of them cars would hit him it'd just demolish him but let him raised his hand the driver of that car recognizes that uniform now I now I understand the world we're living in they've turned against the police come on right defund the police and all that I I think it's something cuz amen the devil is also trying to diminish your Authority he trying to tell you there ain't there ain't no power behind you there you don't have no Authority you know just like he did brother brandom he come to him in the in the M that early morning that little demon standing over in the corner W was talking to him said look like Aly oop and the funny papers now that's past my years I don't even really know what Ali hoop some of y'all may know I know these kids don't know but apparently he was an ugly preacher and he's standing there telling the prophet of God you have no Authority what are you kidding me this man cast him out cast demons out how many services how many sicknesses were healed how many blind old eyes were open how many cripples walked how many people got out of the wheelchair how many things happened under this man Ministry and the devil's still telling him you have no Authority well if he' tell somebody like that don't you know he going to tell you yes sir why would he tell you that because he knows you do so he's trying to keep you into that defeated space and that defeated spot Amen to where you think well back up just you need back up a little bit and your faith gets weaker and you back up a little bit and faith gets weaker as that man boo boo you know what I'm talking about but listen he said I looked at that thing for a moment and I said Satan you're an offense to me get get out of here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said that thing just Whirled up in a ball and left he said the sweetest presence came into the room and a voice began to speak said the never-failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go that's who is with you this morning brother Matt can't always be with you I can't always be with you no preacher can or wants to but God can he can be with you in your weakness he can be with you in your struggle he can be with you in the moments where you feel down and nobody cares and nobody understands nobody knows what I'm going through God knows I know he knows the devil wants to destroy Authority because he knows if faith is released his power is broken come on now look at his authority this little man he might look like I just say it look like Barney F you know what Barney F he didn't look like he had no Authority I tell on myself I was watching one of them episodes and he come out to the edge of town somebody was selling some stuff and he told him he had to move and this guy bullied him and he forgot his authority you know Bo Barney he couldn't have but one bullet and he couldn't even have it in his gun that's what the devil wants to make you think like you ain't nothing but Old Barney you ain't got no Authority just a bunch of La everybody's laughing at you nobody cares I know I'm getting real nobody understands you and you don't even have a bullet in your gun hahaaa and Andy had to remind him that they it had nothing to do with his gun had nothing to do with his build he didn't have to be the biggest guy What mattered was the badge that was on his chest amen and he went back out there and the man tried to bully him again but Barney for a moment tried to back up but all of a sudden he remembered those words but this badge speaks for what I say and he said there's a town that backs me up and if you don't move you're going to have to pay the price and that man realized I can't Bluff him no more I'm going to have to get my stuff and move out of here listen if you'll just stand up to the devil one time and say devil listen I may not be nothing but it ain't dependent on my strength it's dependent on the badge of the holy spirit that lives on the inside of me and I have authority over you this morning and you'll realize he's just a bluff it's all he is he said when that man steps out and he's all them cars whooping up and down he says stop all them [Applause] brakesman I've seen it happen brother Matt I I've seen it happen when a man gets enough of the devil and he speaks out a word of faith and he says stop and he has to stop listen where some fathers at get enough of the devil that's going through your home and say stop come on somebody amen where's somebody at that's tired of the devil running through their mind and say stop you I don't have to bow down to your thoughts those are not my thoughts brother talks about it very clearly go look up he said how does some questions ask him how do you know if you're thinking your thoughts or the devil's thoughts he says anything that's contrary to the word of God is the devil's thinking and he said anything that's lined up with the word of God is God's thinking he never puts it actually on the person who asked the question it's either the devil's or it's Gods come on somebody so if you're thinking thoughts that are contrary to the word of God that is the devil's thinking it's not your thinking it's the devil trying to put thoughts there but if you allow it to sit there you know he'll laugh he'll come in with suicide thoughts and he'll hammer and Hammer and Hammer until finally somebody puts those thoughts into action come on Amen but he has no power Amen to do anything unless that person puts that thought into an action and this is exactly right he has no power he can put thoughts of negativity ity he can put thoughts of all kinds of things towards your marriage towards the church towards your child towards whatever but unless you put it into action he has no power same with God's thoughts if you never put them into action there's no power but once you releas it in faith believing all things are possible I can have what God has told me I can have I can have my children yes how do you know you can have your children brother Timothy because the word of God said I could he said the promises unto you and your children he said they shall be there and their offspring with them so I have promises for my children and devil I'm here to tell you stop you can have a Peaceable marriage that Devil comes in your home and he wants to bring disruption he wants to you need to stop for a moment and realize what's happening it ain't your wife it ain't your H I'm sorry might be getting the pastorial job but it ain't that that's what the devil wants to make you think well my wife she crazy well she probably thinking the same thing about you well you just don't know brother Timothy my wife's going through the change yeah I do know brother I've seen it but I know God's still God during those moments too I seen my own mom I never thought that I would have to sit down and counsel my mom and dad sit down with my mom cuz she was going through the change of life and it was so hard on her and she was just tore up in her mind the devil put all kinds of crazy thoughts in her mind and she's begin to think it was her own thoughts and she just cried and to me and said tell me I don't want to think these things you devil was anointing jealousies and stuff all kinds of stuff so she had got on some some hormonal treatment and things and that wasn't helping and she went over to a meeting over there in in in Europe brother Tim and brother Ron Spencer brother Eddie biscuit was invited there ministering and one night had been a deal went on I won go into all that but Dad was up late dealing with a situation she was in her room and she was all tore up in her thoughts my mom when she'd get nervous she'd ring her hands and walk back and forth and crying and thinking something's happening to my dad you know and all kinds of thoughts are going through her mind he walks in and finds her all Disturbed and has to spend hours calming her down and the next night brother Ron Spencer's preaching he's walked down the aisle and he looked at looked at my mom and he said sister Karen the work God started in you he's going to finish he said God saw you last night ringing your hands he said but God's here to finish the work listen brother Matt I saw a woman that went there so hurt and so bound up by this thing of of hormones and things that was just so so torment in her mind come back a different person actually what she used to be and she didn't know no longer her rest of her life ever had to have any hormones any treatment anything so I know God heals that too but he wants to take people in their weaknesses and make them think well you're just thinking that that's who you are that's you know the devil no that's just the devil coming in your mind and trying to twist it and turn it and hurt you and hurt others but there is a power that's greater I'm a witness of it you can stand upon the word of God and say devil stop let me just drop a little Word of Wisdom here when you say that you ain't talking to your wife you ain't talking to your husband well I tell you devil stop you got a no no that'll cause you a lot of grief cause you a lot of trouble but when you get down on your knees and say God I don't know how to handle this I don't know what to do I don't know where to turn but I know the devil has no right I know he has no right to come and cause this torment and cause this this Division I know he has no right so therefore I submit myself to you God I've had to do it many times when you realize who is at work CU if you find out how quickly I don't even know why we're going down all these paths but we're just here but I know you know how it is he he makes sure that you're on your way to church or somebody's about to come over something's about to take place then he wants to bring all this stuff up in your life because he knows something somebody's about to get help and he's trying to destroy it and hurt it where help can't come but this is where we got to submit oursel it's not that we're strong we're nothing but what is behind you what's with you you've joined an army you've joined a force there's going to be keep that you're going to keep law and control of these Devils you're on the police Forge the whole thing's behind you see you reckon Yourself Dead you're nothing you can't stop nothing but your Authority that's been given you because you're raised and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the devil recognizes that and everything slides as breaks when those hands go up hallelujah amen maybe this morning you don't feel like it and you've seen yourself all tore up and you seen yourself tore up in your spirit but if you'll just start raising those hands I'll throw up these hands and praise you again and again amen I may not feel like it I may not want to it may not be what's going on me at the moment but if I'll just do it anyhow this man one time came to Jesus he was a centurion he came to him as we bring these things down said Lord my servant is lying paralyzed Jesus said well I'll come and heal him he said well I I'm not worthy for you to even come under my roof but you say the word and he's healed see because I'm a man that's subject to Authority uh with soldiers that are subject to me I say to one go and he goes I say one come and he comes my slave do this and he does it Jesus answered he was amazed said those that are following I tell you truly I have not found such great faith that anyone in Israel I say to you that many Gentiles will come from the East and West and will sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven while the sons and Heirs of the Kingdom those that are descendants of Abraham who would not recognize me as Messiah will be thrown into the outer Darkness into that place there' be weeping and grinding of teeth and Jesus turned to him said go and it will be done for you as you have believed and the servant was restored to health that that very hour he said I like the attitude of the Centurion he man that felt unworthy and as long as you feel Unworthy of the blessing you're asking you're going to get it when you get to a place where you think that God just owes it to you then that's where you're mistaken we're in debt to God God is not in debt to us but we're indebted to him but he said Lord I'm not worthy that you come under my roof neither I'm worthy to come face you in other words I've sent to your church to meet you and ask this question but I have faith I know that you're man and authority and you speak the word and it'll happen Jesus said I've never seen such faith in all of Israel we have been brought under the time of restoration it's a full rest not Reformation restoration it's restoring it right back to an Eden again brother you can go through this and I I'm I'm not going to go through all of it but brother Brown talks about restoration and to restore is to bring it back a claim and enforce it and you enforce it by your voice he said restore is to bring back what it was at the beginning back to a natural condition in order to do this we have the right to enforce it to enforce his rightful condition if somebody stole property from you and they were holding it captive how long will you allow that to happen not no red blooded American no sir let me ask you one of your brothers go home this today and you go in there and you knock you open your door and somebody sitting on your recliner done helped himself to some iced tea said looks at you and says what you doing here I'm going to look at him and say what are you doing here he said well I I I'm a squatter well you ain't got now that's another thing that this world is turning on they turning against the police force the authority and they're also giving more rights to squatters than they do to owners what you see in the natural is also happening in the Supernatural Satan's trying to tell us he's got more rights than we do and squat and stay and sit there there's some of us that allow Satan to sit there longer most of our lives and he's put depression on you he's put anxiety on you and he's put fears on you and he's put all kind of he's nothing but a squatter amen but you as a red-blooded American know you have rights amen I I I we we've had our our Sheriff's come out and tell us look you got more rights than those

have the right to enforce R would talk about this enforcing and he would talk about a car that got stolen and how they got on their knees and got called out to God and God the Holy Spirit would go to that man and convict him and he'd bring that car back what was it God showing us he's not so much concerned about a car but he was concerned about the person who owned the car how much more is he concerned about your children your health your marriage this church you have the right to enforce you have the right to speak the word of God let's bow our hearts if you're Afflicted and he's made you

hand clap of Praise this morning how many appreciate brother Timothy just yielding to the Lord and how many knows that the Lord spoke to you amen we don't come here to hear men talk we come to hear the word of the Lord and I believe God has spoke this morning if you could hear it we look for God to move brother Mark but sometimes in our Humanity we don't see what God's really doing but I believe that God came this morning and he spoke to us and he gave us a word I'm not going to be the devil's accomplice amen I'm not here to I don't I don't work for the devil so I don't speak like the devil I don't talk as talk I don't walk as walk I'm not here to work for the devil I don't here I'm not here to represent him I'm not an ambassador of the devil this morning but I'm an ambassador of Jesus Christ so it may get on your nerves but I want to testify about what God says may not be the answer you want to hear sometimes but let's just say what God says about it and it'll fix every problem sometimes it don't feel good when somebody don't agree with you everybody wants you to see it their way but I think we need to just take what the word says and stand on it because it's the word of the Lord amen I believe that I believe we have a right we have a right to come and stand on God's word amen how many believe that say amen amen want somebody give him a hand clap of Praise again and we're going to say keep on the fire in line keep on the fireing line amen somebody say praise the Lord L somebody say hallelujah hallelujah I know people don't like that when you do that but the prophet did it he said I think we ought we ought to say hallelujah we ought to praise the lord we shouldn't be afraid to worship God you know that's what happened to Daniel that day whenever the king put out a decree and they came by and said you couldn't pray anymore and you couldn't you couldn't worship any other God besides the god that we've created but Daniel said I'm not living by King's decree but I've been given another decree this morning it was called Faith's decree and I can lift my hands and the Bible said with his window open he bowed down and he prayed to God Daniel was a worshipper he wasn't ashamed of what anybody thought about him and I believe that's the way we ought to be as Believers this morning with the windows open we ought to lift our hands and say praise the Lord how many say praise the Lord this morning don't be ashamed of God don't let that old cold Spirit come into the church and well I got a secret serve God secret worship God after all it's according to the dict it ain't the dictates of your heart that's what the devil's doing when he suppresses the believer say from saying I believe God we ought to be able to confess that out of our mouth I believe God and I deny every devil that would tell you anything different it's God and he's God in power and we got a right to worship him we got a right to lift our hands not not only do we have a right to but according to my Bible we're obligated to as Believers to worship Our God and any devil that would stand in the way within you going out the doors and go Fellowship somewhere else but because we have a right to worship God and we got a right to do it without the devil suppressing God's people we got a right to be free this is a church that's free and you have a right to come in here and be free not to have some Spirit come in and sit down the Pew next to you and suppress your worship and your praise to God I rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ these people are God's people they're God's free men and women the prophet called them and they got a right to worship their maker they got a right to say God I love you you got a right to confess and speak out of your mouth that's what the devil's what took everything out of our mouth but we got a right here's what the brother said we got a right to speak I say we should speak it this morning speak worship speak Grace speak praise speak speak edifying things to one another I believe it was a word from the Lord amen we're not a bunch of Fanatics coming around here just saying a bunch of things he read that quote that's one of my favorite quotes brother B said you say it until you do believe it cuz the world looks at says you're a fanatic because you're just saying things but you say it from your heart and you keep confessing it until you do believe it amen how many believers do we have do you love the Lord amen let's just bow our heads together gracious Heavenly Father Lord we certainly thank you Lord for a word that you've given us this morning Lord we thank you for your spirit Lord we thank you for moving amongst the church Lord and knowing the hearts and lives that you've dealt with this morning and God the things that are done Lord that that people sit in this building Lord and God are so blind to what's really being done and Lord I know how we get Lord so focused on the Flesh and all the things that goes on around us but Lord to see your hand moving this morning Lord how humbled it makes us God to see the work that you're doing in a Heart Lord speaking to a young man and God the decisions that he's made just sitting in a church pew Lord and God when it don't even look like anything's happening on the surface but God you're dealing with his heart and changing his decisions Lord and the and the promises that he vowed to you Lord just sitting in a seat and Lord I ask you Lord this morning Lord that you would give him the strength to be able to stand on it and God I pray as a body of Believers Lord that you would give each one the strength to be able to see all that you're doing here and God we want to give you the glory for all that's done Lord let us never spurn your presence or the work that you're doing in your midst or in our midst Lord we we just thank you for all that's done we ask you to bless the food Lord as we go to have Fellowship one with another God and may everything be done according to your word Lord and God to testify the work that you're doing and We Praise You In The Name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning as you go well if you're in the battle for the Lord and the r keep on the fire in line if you truly win then brother you must fight we'll keep on the fire in line well there are many dangers that we all must face in there is
