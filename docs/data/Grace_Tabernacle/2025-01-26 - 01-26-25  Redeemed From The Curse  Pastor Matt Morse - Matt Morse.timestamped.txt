[43:38] few uh Services just in this one chapter
[43:41] so whenever you're home uh throughout
[43:43] the week you might read uh just through
[43:45] Galatians the 3D chapter there's a lot
[43:47] that's laying in here that pertains uh
[43:49] to the bride of Christ here in the end
[43:52] time and uh so we just want to take the
[43:54] time to be able to bring that uh bring
[43:56] that out but the Bible says in the 13th
[43:58] verse it says Christ has redeemed us
[44:00] from the curse of the law being made a
[44:03] curse for us for it is written that
[44:06] cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[44:08] tree that The Blessing of Abraham might
[44:10] come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[44:12] Christ that we might receive the promise
[44:15] of the spirit through faith and we'll
[44:17] just ask the Lord to add His blessings
[44:19] to the reading of the word how many say
[44:21] Amen to that scripture amen may God
[44:23] bless you this morning now I I done so
[44:26] much studying on this uh on this chapter
[44:29] uh you there's no way you can get to uh
[44:32] get to it all in one uh service I I
[44:35] would uh sometimes you kind of have to
[44:37] break it up between services and and you
[44:39] really just want to get in there and and
[44:41] and bring it all out and but I realized
[44:43] we're not in India this morning we're in
[44:45] Arkansas and so uh we I I I started to
[44:49] preach over there on the Sunday morning
[44:51] I had 104 fever and walked out there and
[44:54] that brother leaned over to me and he
[44:55] said it was 11:00 he said brother Matt
[44:57] You Preach till 2:30 or 3:00 no problem
[45:00] brother I said well you don't have
[45:01] nothing to worry about I won't at 3:00
[45:04] the brother that's with me won't be in
[45:06] here anymore so I'm going to have to be
[45:08] wherever he is we but but he he said you
[45:11] know the people will sit for three or 4
[45:13] hours that's no problem they they just
[45:14] want you to preach all day and uh but
[45:17] but the the reality is in 3 or four
[45:19] hours uh we wouldn't be able to sit here
[45:21] any longer and I don't know ain't nobody
[45:22] wants to hear me that long so I wouldn't
[45:23] do that to you this morning but I do
[45:25] want to bring some things out of this
[45:27] this uh this verse of scripture uh that
[45:30] I feel like is something that is so
[45:32] important to the church and and uh you
[45:34] know last week we had started we read
[45:36] from the seventh to the ninth verse and
[45:38] showing uh how that the Seed of Abraham
[45:41] uh that possessed a great faith and know
[45:43] how Paul was teaching that uh that that
[45:46] what we received from God it was not by
[45:48] The Works of the law that we received
[45:50] the promises of God but the way we
[45:51] received him was by our faith and uh
[45:53] brother Bram would say that he said to
[45:55] receive the word of God any the word is
[45:57] a seed he said and the only uh the Bible
[45:59] said it was a seed that was sowed the
[46:01] sewer went forth to seow said but in
[46:04] order for that seed to grow it has to
[46:06] fall in the right kind of soil you
[46:07] remember the the parable that Jesus made
[46:09] and brother B said that soil is our
[46:12] faith in other words it takes something
[46:13] for the seed of the word to be planted
[46:15] in that it would be able to grow he says
[46:18] so that soil is our faith it has to have
[46:20] an atmosphere for growth if you want to
[46:22] see a word growing in you or to be a
[46:24] word born son or daughter of God and to
[46:26] grow strong how many would like to be
[46:28] strengthened in the word of God and be a
[46:30] a son or daughter of God that can stand
[46:32] by the word and be so be so strong and
[46:35] when the things of the world come come
[46:36] at you you're able to defend it said but
[46:38] it has to be in the right kind of soil
[46:40] and that soil is our faith and and from
[46:42] that comes water and comes nutrients and
[46:45] it comes a uh from the soil comes a
[46:47] structure that a seed can grow in it's a
[46:49] place for it to have its roots and a and
[46:51] a place to uh uh it it gives strength
[46:55] and support to a seed and so we realize
[46:57] that our faith is such an important part
[46:59] of our life and and so uh and without it
[47:02] we' never be able to go anywhere with
[47:04] God so it takes that for the seed to be
[47:05] able to fall in so uh we saw how Paul
[47:08] was talking about that and you know of
[47:10] course through these uh Services you
[47:12] realize that what Paul is speaking of
[47:14] especially in Galatians the thirr
[47:15] chapter here in this chapter he was
[47:18] actually trying to teach the galatian
[47:20] church here they had they had by false
[47:22] teaching they had gone into a teaching
[47:24] that the works of the law is what it
[47:27] took to be justified in the sight of God
[47:29] and so here Paul would come to reprove
[47:31] the galatian church in other words he
[47:33] was bringing correction to them to show
[47:35] them that that that the works of the law
[47:37] is never going to justify you there a't
[47:39] no no matter how hard you work or how
[47:41] much effort that you put into it or how
[47:44] how many times you go to make sacrifice
[47:46] it doesn't matter what what you would do
[47:48] but it would never it would never bring
[47:49] justification again and this is what he
[47:51] was teaching in a in in a grand uh
[47:54] scheme what he was teaching the galatian
[47:56] church is that justification does not
[47:59] come by The Works of the law but it only
[48:01] come by faith and so here in this
[48:03] scripture he would speak these words he
[48:05] said Christ has redeemed us from the
[48:07] curse of the law you know I read that
[48:10] and something just kind of stuck out me
[48:11] we know the the word redeem it means to
[48:13] regain possession how many knows that so
[48:15] he said Christ has redeemed us now
[48:17] there's something right in the very
[48:19] beginning of this uh of this uh
[48:22] scripture and this is what I want to
[48:23] speak on this morning that Christ has
[48:25] redeemed us from the curse and here at
[48:27] the very beginning of this as Paul would
[48:29] begin to speak on it he shows us that
[48:32] this word he uses is the word redeemed
[48:34] now how many knows redeemed is the past
[48:37] tense of the word redeemed so here Paul
[48:39] has showing us from the very first word
[48:41] brother Mark that this is not something
[48:43] that God is going to do but it's
[48:45] something that God has already done see
[48:47] there's many today that are looking for
[48:49] a way for God to redeem them is there
[48:51] something I can do that would cause God
[48:53] to redeem me out of this place or redeem
[48:55] me out of this condition but Paul said
[48:57] but Christ has already redeemed you from
[48:59] the curse of the law so first off before
[49:01] we ever even get started into this
[49:03] scripture we have to first realize that
[49:05] is not something that God Can Do You
[49:07] Realize God can do nothing else to
[49:09] redeem you God can't do any other work
[49:12] that would bring you to God or bring you
[49:13] closer to God he can't do something to
[49:15] redeem you because Redemption has
[49:17] already been done so we first off have
[49:20] to understand that it is a past tense
[49:22] it's something that God has already done
[49:23] see and here Paul is showing us that
[49:26] many we go search for Redemption and
[49:28] it's not a bad thing for us to search
[49:30] for Redemption but what we have to
[49:31] realize that in our search for
[49:33] Redemption that there will never be
[49:36] another Act of redemption for the act of
[49:38] redemption is what Jesus has already
[49:40] done so when we're searching for it we
[49:42] may find Redemption but we're not going
[49:44] to find God performing another act to be
[49:47] able to redeem us back to him say See
[49:49] Redemption is a past tense thing so we
[49:51] realize that as Paul is speaking on this
[49:54] that we find that today that many have
[49:56] failed to see the value of their
[49:58] Redemption that God has paid for and you
[50:00] know I look at people they you know you
[50:02] you talk about Redemption and talk about
[50:04] all the things that God done and to some
[50:06] people it don't mean anything to them
[50:08] you ever notice it don't matter how many
[50:10] times you talk about it it don't mean
[50:11] nothing to them they that they find no
[50:13] value in being redeemed they find no
[50:16] value in Redemption and I thought you
[50:17] know I I I thought about that I thought
[50:19] you know the reason that people don't
[50:21] find Value in Redemption is because they
[50:24] don't understand the gravity of the
[50:26] curse that they were under see if you if
[50:29] you knew what you were really under and
[50:30] you knew what you where you were really
[50:32] heading and you knew uh the the burden
[50:35] of the curse that was upon you then it
[50:37] gives Redemption a lot more value if you
[50:39] knew what what if you knew how in other
[50:41] words if you knew how bad the curse was
[50:43] You' know how how much meaning that that
[50:46] Redemption had that it saved you from
[50:48] the curse so you know as I so I I
[50:50] thought on these on on these things of
[50:53] of the curse that that Paul was speaking
[50:55] of and and you can read about it in
[50:57] Deuteronomy through the the law of Moses
[50:59] and he begins to speak of the of the
[51:01] people following and obeying the word of
[51:03] the Lord and how that the curse would
[51:06] come upon them and and he would say
[51:08] because the they must obey the voice of
[51:10] God and observe his Commandments and
[51:12] notice what the Bible said that then the
[51:14] curse would come because they failed to
[51:15] obey the word of the Lord and here was
[51:17] the curse he said cursed shall you be in
[51:20] the city and cursed shall you be in the
[51:22] field cursed would you be in your basket
[51:24] and in your store cursed would be the
[51:26] fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy
[51:28] land and in the increase of thy cattle
[51:30] and the flocks of thy sheep and cursed
[51:32] you will be when you come in and curse
[51:34] you will be when you go out so here God
[51:37] is going to lay out the curse of people
[51:40] that will not obey the word of the Lord
[51:42] and you realize that in this curse it
[51:44] came with poverty it came with sickness
[51:47] it came with destruction and it came
[51:49] with no way of Escape so it didn't
[51:51] matter who you were or it didn't matter
[51:53] who you were born to or what your tribal
[51:56] inage was because they failed to obey
[51:58] the word or the law of God then they
[52:00] were cursed with poverty sickness and
[52:02] destruction had no way out so here's
[52:05] what Paul was preaching he was talking
[52:07] about the curse that would come on the
[52:09] church and he said but Christ has come
[52:11] and has redeemed us from the curse of
[52:14] the law he didn't say Christ took you
[52:16] redeemed you from the law that's why
[52:18] Jesus didn't even preach that he said I
[52:20] didn't come to do away with the law but
[52:22] I came to fulfill it you say well how
[52:23] did he fulfill it he became the Cur
[52:26] curse that was associated with the law
[52:28] Paul said he was made a curse for us for
[52:31] it was written that cursed is everyone
[52:33] that hangeth upon a tree in other words
[52:35] whenever the curse you deserve the curse
[52:38] because we broke the law of God and you
[52:40] deserve the curse because you couldn't
[52:41] keep the law of God but Paul said but he
[52:44] became the curse for you in other words
[52:46] he fulfilled the very law of God he he
[52:49] fulfilled it by becoming the curse that
[52:51] you and I so deserve and he said in The
[52:53] Blessing of Abraham it might come on the
[52:56] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we
[52:59] might receive the promise of the spirit
[53:01] through faith can you put that up there
[53:02] Galatians 3:14 that The Blessing of
[53:05] Abraham might come on the Gentile
[53:06] through Jesus Christ that we might
[53:08] receive the promise of the spirit
[53:10] through faith now this is a powerful
[53:12] verse of scripture now I know you you've
[53:15] read this we read it last week but if
[53:16] you could take a moment just to read
[53:18] this that we might receive the promise
[53:21] of the spirit through faith now there
[53:23] there's something that Paul is trying to
[53:25] show I I I love just getting into
[53:27] scripture and just going going down
[53:29] right deep into it and finding finding
[53:31] the meaning of it and but notice what
[53:33] Paul is teaching the church he's showing
[53:35] us that The Blessing of Abraham was the
[53:38] promise of the spirit of God so here
[53:40] here he's bringing a revelation to the
[53:42] to the church that it wasn't just this
[53:44] land in Canaan it wasn't just that they
[53:47] would receive this Borders or this
[53:48] border of this land but there was
[53:50] something farther in the the promise
[53:52] that God was making to Abraham uh that
[53:55] was to every believer and so here is he
[53:57] would show it that it was the that that
[53:59] the blessing was the spirit of God and
[54:01] here you notice what he's teaching he's
[54:03] actually teaching us on the Covenant of
[54:05] Abraham so here here that you could
[54:07] think as the galatian church now I know
[54:09] you've heard it but the galatian church
[54:10] hadn't heard it here they thought that
[54:12] Abraham uh that the Covenant that God
[54:14] made with Abraham only applied to Israel
[54:17] and it only applied to that that that
[54:19] great nation that they that they had
[54:21] seen rise and fall and go through these
[54:23] things but here Paul was bringing
[54:24] something else to them by re ation he
[54:27] was a prophet of God he seen things that
[54:29] that they didn't see and here he went
[54:31] all the way back into the mind of God
[54:33] when God would make a promise to Abraham
[54:35] and he would say to the church that
[54:36] before God made a promise to Abraham he
[54:39] had you on his mind and so when he would
[54:41] go to make that promise to him he saw
[54:43] you and he saw your condition he knew
[54:45] you would have to have a way out he said
[54:47] and then God after he saw your condition
[54:50] he went back in time because he's an
[54:52] eternal God and he found Father Abraham
[54:54] and he made a promise unto him him and
[54:56] that promise applies to you today and so
[54:59] here he was bringing this to the church
[55:01] and notice how he was teaching on this
[55:03] Covenant of Abraham I could just imagine
[55:05] the galatian church sitting there and
[55:07] their minds begin to to be stretched out
[55:09] and their thoughts stretched out that
[55:10] you mean the Covenant it applies to you
[55:12] and me my I I never thought that that
[55:15] you know when I read about it I never
[55:16] saw that in it but Paul he begin to
[55:18] bring the Covenant of Abraham and to
[55:20] bring it present in the in the Gentile
[55:22] church he said see you you would ask
[55:25] this well how would Abraham's Covenant
[55:27] give me the promise of the spirit of God
[55:30] you know you you think about what a
[55:32] covenant is see a covenant is an
[55:34] agreement that is made and there's many
[55:36] covenants throughout the Bible you you
[55:38] could you could find I know we we speak
[55:40] on them many times but you there there
[55:42] was the abrahamic Covenant there was the
[55:44] uh the the noic Covenant in other words
[55:47] it was a covenant God made with Noah
[55:49] that he would never flood the Earth
[55:50] again there was the The davidic Covenant
[55:52] that God made with David that there that
[55:54] there would come one after him that
[55:56] would rule or that would reign in the
[55:59] Throne of David there was the adamic
[56:01] Covenant that God made with Adam
[56:03] remember don't touch this tree or thou
[56:05] Thou shalt surely th Thou shalt surely
[56:07] die many times we find covenants that
[56:09] God makes with man throughout the
[56:11] scripture thank you for having that
[56:13] brother but many times he he he brings
[56:15] this he brings this out there's many
[56:17] covenants that God's made but but we
[56:19] find this that in all the covenants that
[56:21] God makes with man there's only two
[56:23] types of covenants and one is a covenant
[56:26] of law and the other is a Covenant of
[56:28] Grace there was one that was a covenant
[56:30] that's based on conditions and there's
[56:32] another Covenant that's an unconditional
[56:34] Covenant and see brother BR said that's
[56:35] why God had to make that kind of
[56:37] Covenant because every time God makes a
[56:39] law man always breaks it when God makes
[56:43] a covenant with man man never keeps his
[56:45] Covenant he said he never kept his
[56:47] Covenant in the days of Adam he never
[56:48] kept his Covenant in the days of Moses
[56:50] he never kept his Covenant in the days
[56:52] of Jesus man always breaks his Covenant
[56:55] but I thank God this morning that God
[56:57] don't ever break his God always keeps
[57:00] his you'll never find a place in
[57:02] scripture you read through the entire
[57:03] Bible and you'll find where man has
[57:05] broken his Covenant with God but you'll
[57:07] never find a place in the Bible where
[57:09] God ever broke his Covenant with man say
[57:12] see so it means something for God to
[57:14] have a covenant with us see you know
[57:16] it's important listen what God is making
[57:18] this Covenant with Abraham you realize
[57:20] when you look at this Covenant God made
[57:22] with Abraham it was not based on man's
[57:24] abilities it was not based on on what
[57:28] Abraham could do or could not do and
[57:30] this is such an important thing that
[57:32] Paul is teaching because it applies to
[57:34] the Gentile church now notice what God
[57:36] gave can I take just a minute in this
[57:39] and if I don't finish I'll pick up next
[57:40] next time but notice what God is telling
[57:42] Abraham he tells him seven promises that
[57:45] he's going to give to him when he calls
[57:46] him uh calls him out of the the land of
[57:49] his fathers he said I will make thee a
[57:51] great nation I Will Bless Thee I will
[57:53] make thy name Great Thou shalt be a
[57:55] bless bling so not only am I going to
[57:57] bless you but I'm going to cause you to
[57:59] be a blessing to others in other words
[58:01] you're going to possess something in you
[58:03] that you're able to give out he said
[58:04] Thou shalt be a blessing he said and
[58:07] then I will bless those that bless you I
[58:09] will curse those that curse you and in
[58:12] the shall all the families of the earth
[58:15] be blessed and see in these precious
[58:18] promises that God gave to Abraham lays
[58:21] the promise to the gentile people now
[58:23] you think about it here it was many
[58:25] years after God spoke this to Abraham
[58:28] before God comes and makes it a formal
[58:30] Covenant remember in Genesis 17 the
[58:32] Bible says I think Abraham was 99 years
[58:34] old and God came to Abraham and he said
[58:37] Abraham I will make a covenant this has
[58:39] been many years since he's called him
[58:40] out many many years has gone by that
[58:42] he's lived out out in the plains this is
[58:45] after he had already went and and fought
[58:47] the Kings and and and and defeated the
[58:49] Kings and restored lot back to his home
[58:52] it this is the time that God comes to to
[58:54] make this formal Covenant with Abraham
[58:57] notice and when he when he would call
[58:58] him to this place he said I'm going to
[58:59] make a covenant with thee and multiply
[59:02] thee exceedingly and the Bible says and
[59:04] Abram fell on his face before God and
[59:07] God talked with him I thought my that's
[59:09] something we ought to hear this morning
[59:10] you most of the time people fall on
[59:12] their face but they do all the talking
[59:14] but the Bible said Abraham fell on his
[59:15] face before God and God talked to him I
[59:18] I think that's a place that we ought to
[59:19] get to this morning that we can lay in
[59:21] the presence of God and allow God to
[59:23] speak that we can get to a place that we
[59:25] can hear the voice of God that's that's
[59:28] what we're doing this morning is to sit
[59:30] in the presence of God and hear the
[59:32] voice of God as it begins to speak to
[59:33] our soul and he says things that that we
[59:36] we that we wouldn't be able to say and
[59:38] puts things together in our life and
[59:39] leads us words that a man wouldn't have
[59:41] the ability to be able to speak but the
[59:43] spirit of God is able to speak to our
[59:45] soul because we're laying in the
[59:47] presence of God and hearing the voice of
[59:49] God speak he said as behold as for me
[59:52] behold my Covenant is with thee you'll
[59:54] be the father of many nations neither
[59:56] shall thy name be more called Abram but
[59:58] your name shall be Abraham for a father
[1:00:00] of many nations have I made thee and I
[1:00:02] will make thee exceeding fruitful and I
[1:00:04] will make nations of thee and Kings
[1:00:06] shall come out of Thee I will establish
[1:00:08] my Covenant between me and thee and thy
[1:00:10] seed after thee and generations it'll be
[1:00:12] an Everlasting Covenant that's a key
[1:00:14] point in other words the Covenant I'm
[1:00:16] making with you is not just for this
[1:00:18] generation of people but it is
[1:00:20] Everlasting so here that's where Paul
[1:00:21] could pick this up and say this still
[1:00:23] applies to us today it's an everlasting
[1:00:26] Covenant and to God to be a god unto
[1:00:28] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[1:00:31] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[1:00:33] after thee the land that thou art a
[1:00:35] stranger the land of Canaan as an
[1:00:37] everlasting possession and I will be
[1:00:39] their God now notice this is not just a
[1:00:42] promise but now God here is making a
[1:00:44] formal Covenant with Abraham that these
[1:00:46] things are going to come to pass now
[1:00:48] notice a as Abraham was a man just like
[1:00:51] you and I he had emotions just like you
[1:00:53] and I do he he was a man that that had
[1:00:56] insecurities like us and when God come
[1:00:59] and he said I'm going to make this
[1:01:00] Covenant with you because he's just like
[1:01:02] you and I are he said well how do I know
[1:01:05] that this is really going to take place
[1:01:07] isn't that the way we are that's our
[1:01:08] human nature what how how how can I have
[1:01:10] a confirmation of this how how do I know
[1:01:12] this is really right and listen how how
[1:01:14] do I know that I'll inherit and here
[1:01:16] here here God begin to speak to him and
[1:01:18] notice how God confirms that this is
[1:01:20] watch this is what Paul is bringing out
[1:01:22] now Paul Paul just makes this statement
[1:01:24] but this is where he got it from here
[1:01:25] here whenever here when God begins to
[1:01:28] confirm it he tells Abraham he said go
[1:01:30] and make a sacrifice for me take a
[1:01:32] hepher and take a ram and take a gold
[1:01:34] and a pigeon and a turtle dove and he
[1:01:36] divided up those four-footed beasts and
[1:01:38] and he laid them out upon the Altar and
[1:01:40] then as you would lay them out one piece
[1:01:42] to another then the Bible says here
[1:01:44] Abraham he was watching over the
[1:01:46] sacrifice you you could just see him
[1:01:47] here as he went out brother Mark to obey
[1:01:49] the word of the Lord and he took the he
[1:01:51] took the animals and the RAM and the and
[1:01:53] the goat and he and he took them and he
[1:01:55] div bed them in half and he laid one
[1:01:57] piece on one side and one piece on the
[1:01:59] other side and here head to tail he laid
[1:02:01] these sacrifices upon the Altar and you
[1:02:04] realize that Abraham being a just man of
[1:02:06] God and trying to obey the word of the
[1:02:08] Lord the Bible said he watched over the
[1:02:10] sacrifice he stood and he made sure that
[1:02:12] the birds and the that didn't come and
[1:02:14] get on the on the fresh meat but he was
[1:02:16] making sure that God was able to use
[1:02:18] them so it wasn't that that that just
[1:02:20] Abraham was relaxing and he well I I did
[1:02:23] what God wanted me to and he went back
[1:02:24] and kicked back to take but the Bible
[1:02:26] said he was watching over the sacrifice
[1:02:28] and I and and as the as the sun began to
[1:02:31] go down and here this man of God was
[1:02:33] watching over the sacrifices he had done
[1:02:35] what God had asked him to do and I could
[1:02:37] just see him so intently trying to keep
[1:02:39] the word of the Lord and as he as he was
[1:02:41] watching over it and the sun began to go
[1:02:43] down the Bible said but all of the
[1:02:45] sudden a deep sleep fell upon Abraham so
[1:02:48] here as this sleep fell upon him what
[1:02:50] God was doing he was showing him
[1:02:52] something now he put him into a sleep
[1:02:54] and then the Bible said and then a great
[1:02:56] Blackness a great Darkness fell around
[1:02:58] him and in the middle of that Darkness
[1:03:01] as the darkness would fall around then
[1:03:02] all of a sudden there came a smoking
[1:03:05] furnace and a and a burning lamp that
[1:03:07] came right between the sacrifices and
[1:03:09] divided them in two and the prophet of
[1:03:11] God say listen what God was showing to
[1:03:13] Abraham remember he began to speak to
[1:03:15] him he said Abraham your your your seed
[1:03:18] is going to go into an a land that is
[1:03:20] not theirs and there they'll be there
[1:03:22] for four generations but no oh if you
[1:03:24] could just see the plan of God he said
[1:03:25] they're going to go there but why why
[1:03:27] would God take them through this place
[1:03:28] because God's going to raise them there
[1:03:30] he's going to build a nation and he's
[1:03:32] going to use Egypt to build them he's
[1:03:33] going to give them a place that they can
[1:03:35] grow and they can multiply and they
[1:03:37] became this great this great uh people
[1:03:39] or this great nation of God and he made
[1:03:42] sure that they were fed and they grew
[1:03:43] although it would be a time of bondage
[1:03:45] he said but then there comes a time that
[1:03:47] I'm going to bring them out and when I
[1:03:49] bring them out they're not going to be
[1:03:50] packing bricks and they're not they're
[1:03:51] not going to be packing Egypt and
[1:03:53] they're not going to be packing all all
[1:03:54] the burdens that Egypt had put on them
[1:03:56] but when they come out they're going to
[1:03:58] come out with a great substance and
[1:04:00] they're going to leave out with silver
[1:04:01] and gold and The Spoils of Egypt they're
[1:04:03] going to come out with great wealth and
[1:04:05] they're going to go into the land that I
[1:04:07] that I have given unto them notice but
[1:04:09] that you see what God was doing he was
[1:04:11] giving them this place of inheritance
[1:04:13] now I know a a lot of the people that
[1:04:15] don't that that just aren't Christians
[1:04:17] and don't like Christ I feel like
[1:04:18] preaching this morning y'all just have
[1:04:19] to let me go but but but the people that
[1:04:21] don't like Christianity they say well
[1:04:23] God's an unjust God because he took land
[1:04:25] away from from one people and he gave it
[1:04:27] to another people why would God do a
[1:04:28] thing like that but notice What God Says
[1:04:30] to Abraham he says you have to go to
[1:04:32] this place of Egypt or this place where
[1:04:34] you'll be a stranger because the because
[1:04:37] the iniquity of the amorites is not yet
[1:04:40] fulfilled so here God is telling Abraham
[1:04:43] that the amorites that possessed the
[1:04:45] land of Canaan the land that was
[1:04:47] promised to Israel that they were a
[1:04:49] people that was going to receive the
[1:04:50] Judgment of God because of their
[1:04:52] iniquity but here God knowing that their
[1:04:54] iniquity he said it's not yet filled
[1:04:56] they haven't came oh my that ought to
[1:04:58] tell us something this morning that they
[1:05:00] haven't came to the place of judgment do
[1:05:01] you realize that that's the way God is
[1:05:03] today that's the very Mercy that you see
[1:05:06] of God today is because God is a
[1:05:08] merciful god and he would allow them to
[1:05:10] sin and allow them to commit iniquity
[1:05:12] until the cup of iniquity was
[1:05:14] overflowing and it demanded the Wrath or
[1:05:16] the Judgment of God that's the place
[1:05:19] that we are today don't you realize that
[1:05:21] you that the there would come a time
[1:05:23] that was judgment you said well brother
[1:05:25] man when when judgment come it's when
[1:05:26] the cup of iniquity is filled it's
[1:05:29] whenever that's what that's what brother
[1:05:31] maram said when he was talking in the
[1:05:33] second seal about Satan remember he said
[1:05:35] Satan would be three things one he was
[1:05:37] Satan he was incarnate in the in the
[1:05:40] early Church in the Jews Satan was an
[1:05:43] antichrist but then in the Dark Ages he
[1:05:46] became no longer the well it was still
[1:05:49] the the spirit of antichrist he said but
[1:05:51] in the Dark Ages he became a false
[1:05:53] prophet so here because it it was that
[1:05:55] dark denominationalism that is leading
[1:05:57] Leading the People of God and here
[1:05:59] they're drinking out of this cup of
[1:06:01] iniquity he said he become a false
[1:06:03] prophet see there they are with a cup of
[1:06:05] iniquity that's the church age that we
[1:06:07] live in now but after this age the
[1:06:09] church is going to go home and whenever
[1:06:11] she goes home speaking of the bride of
[1:06:13] Christ and whenever she goes home then
[1:06:16] Satan will become a great Beast he'll
[1:06:17] become the devil incarnate that great
[1:06:19] red dragon himself he said you can't see
[1:06:22] but notice he will be in his people then
[1:06:25] that great spirit can you imagine that
[1:06:27] people in the that walking in the world
[1:06:29] would be the devil incarnate he said but
[1:06:31] after that bride goes home then that
[1:06:33] same he'll become the dragon now he'll
[1:06:35] there'll be the devil incarnate why
[1:06:37] because there's no God in it at all and
[1:06:39] he would it would be Satan incarnated in
[1:06:42] his people you say oh my what a sad
[1:06:44] thing it is to see people that that the
[1:06:46] very demon out of the pits of hell would
[1:06:48] be incarnate living in human bodies but
[1:06:50] what got them to that place he said they
[1:06:52] got there because the false prophets
[1:06:54] have proph side them right into it
[1:06:57] that's why the Bible said that they
[1:06:58] would they would give over to strong
[1:07:00] delusions to believe lies and be damned
[1:07:02] by it what is it it's false prophets
[1:07:04] that are prophesying people into a place
[1:07:06] to be able to possess the very demon out
[1:07:09] of the pits of hell I thought my there's
[1:07:11] a there's coming a time when the cup of
[1:07:13] iniquity iniquity would be filled
[1:07:15] there's coming a time when judgment
[1:07:17] would stri the Earth you realize that
[1:07:19] that that we're so close to it now but
[1:07:21] the Bible says they would deny the word
[1:07:23] of God or they would have a a form of
[1:07:26] godliness but deny the power of God is
[1:07:28] that not the age that we live in the
[1:07:30] world has a form of godliness but deny
[1:07:32] the very power of God and deny the power
[1:07:35] of the Holy
[1:07:36] Ghost see but when the cup of iniquity
[1:07:38] is full judgment would come but notice
[1:07:41] what God's telling him here this is
[1:07:43] coming he and he says first a deep sleep
[1:07:46] fell on Abraham then a whr of Darkness
[1:07:49] then a furnace of fire a burning light
[1:07:52] went between the Covenant between the
[1:07:54] sacrifices and divid it he said well
[1:07:56] what what does all that mean but M said
[1:07:58] see it means that every human being has
[1:08:01] to die see notice what he's showing us
[1:08:03] through Abraham's sacrifice that every
[1:08:05] human being has to die and we deserve to
[1:08:08] go to hell this darkness that come
[1:08:11] around him he went into a sleep Darkness
[1:08:13] come on him he says see that's right in
[1:08:15] darkness we deserve to be in darkness
[1:08:18] and outer darkness and to be separated
[1:08:20] from God what is it it's the curse of
[1:08:22] the law said but then the light came in
[1:08:26] and it went in between and it divided
[1:08:28] those sacrifices so what was supposed to
[1:08:31] been separated was brought back together
[1:08:33] by the Light Of God he says see oh I
[1:08:35] think this is so good brother Mark
[1:08:36] because this first off God puts Abraham
[1:08:39] to sleep to prove that Abraham had
[1:08:40] nothing to do with it isn't that good in
[1:08:42] other words that you ain't this you you
[1:08:44] may you may have set it up for me but
[1:08:46] but but this this sacrifice has nothing
[1:08:48] to do with he didn't even allow him to
[1:08:50] perform the sacrifice oh all he did was
[1:08:52] had it laid on the altar God put him to
[1:08:54] sleep and then God went to to work on
[1:08:55] the sacrifice so he showed him that it
[1:08:58] was not based on his conditions and it
[1:09:00] ain't based on your it a it ain't based
[1:09:01] on your abilities or your Merit or
[1:09:03] anything that you that you could do to
[1:09:05] deserve it but it was unconditional it's
[1:09:07] not based on your ability to be able to
[1:09:09] perform a sacrifice for God to accept
[1:09:11] you it ain't based on how good you can
[1:09:13] pray or how good of a Christian you can
[1:09:15] be or how good of a Preacher you are how
[1:09:18] good of a singer you are or how much
[1:09:20] more you do than the next person that
[1:09:22] ain't what the sacrifice is based on
[1:09:24] said it was an uncondition
[1:09:26] he showed it wasn't Abraham's marit but
[1:09:28] it came in now notice in this process of
[1:09:30] sacrifice God was confirming the
[1:09:32] Covenant and he confirmed it by sending
[1:09:34] a light between the pieces in other
[1:09:37] words the light confirmed that God had
[1:09:39] accepted Abraham's sacrifice is there
[1:09:42] there there there's such a I could
[1:09:43] preach for an hour on this but there
[1:09:45] there's something the to realize what it
[1:09:47] means for God to accept your sacrifice
[1:09:50] and the presence of God or the presence
[1:09:52] of that light upon the altar of Abraham
[1:09:55] the very meaning of that was God saying
[1:09:57] I have accepted what you've done I've
[1:09:59] accepted this I've accepted the work I
[1:10:03] I've accepted this as being satisfactory
[1:10:06] to God it was a sweet smelling Savor to
[1:10:08] God see that's that's what we want with
[1:10:10] our life we want our sacrifice to be
[1:10:11] accepted by God we want our how many how
[1:10:14] many say it I I want My Worship to be
[1:10:16] accepted by God I I don't want to
[1:10:17] Worship in vain I I don't want to serve
[1:10:19] God in M but I want God to accept me I
[1:10:21] want him to accept me in my worship I
[1:10:23] want him to accept my praise I want him
[1:10:25] to accept my prayer and and all that I
[1:10:27] have to give to God nobody wants to give
[1:10:30] somebody a gift and then they'll take it
[1:10:32] can you imagine going through all the
[1:10:34] effort of giving somebody a gift and
[1:10:36] wrapping it up and making it so nice and
[1:10:38] maybe you don't have a lot to give and
[1:10:40] don't have a lot of money to spend but
[1:10:42] but you you make them a little something
[1:10:43] and and give it to them and then they
[1:10:44] would look at so I've had greater gifts
[1:10:46] than that and they just throw it over in
[1:10:47] the corner wouldn't even accept a how
[1:10:49] how would it make you feel see we we
[1:10:51] wouldn't like that we want God to accept
[1:10:54] our sacrifice sometimes we don't have a
[1:10:56] lot to offer we don't have a lot to give
[1:10:58] God but here he said but I will accept
[1:11:00] the sacrifice that you give me see it
[1:11:03] meant something to Abraham for God to
[1:11:04] come and accept what he was able to give
[1:11:07] see he said but notice what it meant we
[1:11:09] that the L came and confirmed that God
[1:11:11] had accepted the sacrifice he say see
[1:11:14] what was God showing us that man didn't
[1:11:17] perform the sacrifice it wasn't our
[1:11:20] actions but Tom it wasn't our abilities
[1:11:23] he said but it was God himself showing
[1:11:25] that he was going to come and be made
[1:11:28] flesh he would be he would come in the
[1:11:30] middle of that sacrifice and become the
[1:11:32] sacrifice that he would be he would be a
[1:11:34] part of the Covenant that he made with
[1:11:36] Abraham said that's what he done on on
[1:11:38] the cross of Calvary God that Jehovah
[1:11:41] God he took Christ on Calvary and he
[1:11:43] tore him into two and he set his soul on
[1:11:45] high and put his body in hell what was
[1:11:47] he doing he was dividing the sacrifice
[1:11:49] on the cross of Calvary said but then
[1:11:52] after he divided it here it laid there
[1:11:54] it was a great dark time the Bible said
[1:11:56] Darkness fell upon the Earth but in the
[1:11:58] midst of the darkness on the third s on
[1:12:00] that third morning all of a sudden the
[1:12:02] light of God came down into the tomb and
[1:12:05] the body came out of the grave and it
[1:12:07] resurrected again oh let me tell you
[1:12:09] that was what happened in the natural
[1:12:10] but there was something happened in the
[1:12:12] spiritual but God took that same Jesus
[1:12:15] and he set him on high in glory and here
[1:12:18] again this sacrifice was separated it
[1:12:20] was a head separated from a body it was
[1:12:23] Christ the head of the church separated
[1:12:24] from the body the Believers that were
[1:12:26] down on the earth that God wasn't going
[1:12:28] to leave it that way but just in a few
[1:12:30] days the Bible said Terry here until you
[1:12:33] be ued with power from on high and the
[1:12:35] Bible said when the day of Pentecost was
[1:12:37] fully come the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:39] fell in the room where they were like A
[1:12:41] rushan Mighty Wind and the Bible said
[1:12:44] upon them fell little licks of fire what
[1:12:46] was it it was a burning lamp that came
[1:12:48] to bring Unity between one half and the
[1:12:51] other half it was the light of God that
[1:12:53] brought them together again but let me
[1:12:55] tell you something about this light of
[1:12:57] God it wasn't good enough for God for it
[1:12:59] just to rest upon them it wasn't good
[1:13:01] enough for God for the licks of fire to
[1:13:03] fall upon them the Bible said that they
[1:13:05] didn't just stay on them but then they
[1:13:07] were filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:10] Ghost they were filled with the spirit
[1:13:11] of God that's why the prophet of God
[1:13:14] would say the spirit of God is a
[1:13:16] Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ the light of God is a Vindication
[1:13:22] that God has accepted the sacrifice
[1:13:24] that's why we're Holy Ghost Church
[1:13:26] that's why we preach in the baptism of
[1:13:27] the Holy Ghost that's why we pray until
[1:13:29] you're filled with the spirit of God
[1:13:31] because the spirit of God is a
[1:13:33] Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:13:36] Christ it's a Vindication that God has
[1:13:38] accepted the sacrifice on your
[1:13:42] behalf glory to God takes the spirit of
[1:13:46] God to confirm the sacrifice takes a
[1:13:49] spirit of God to confirm that God has
[1:13:51] accepted it said see that's the same
[1:13:54] thing today
[1:13:56] but said if there was no Holy Spirit to
[1:13:59] vindicate it we couldn't even believe in
[1:14:00] the
[1:14:02] resurrection that's why we believe the
[1:14:04] Holy Ghost think of the story of the
[1:14:06] Resurrection you know that's the most
[1:14:08] debated thing about Christianity No One
[1:14:11] Believes the resurrection they think
[1:14:12] that that these these unbelievers but
[1:14:14] you realize he said we believe the story
[1:14:16] and we accept it because God promised he
[1:14:19] would not leave us comfortless he knew
[1:14:22] that it would be all tangled up in this
[1:14:23] age in the days to come there would be
[1:14:25] teachers false teachers and all these
[1:14:27] that would come and have a word and it
[1:14:29] would all be mixed up but in the end
[1:14:31] time what would he do he would send a
[1:14:34] direct messenger what was it it was the
[1:14:36] Holy Spirit he said he would send a
[1:14:38] direct messenger called the Holy Spirit
[1:14:41] which was the Vindication of the
[1:14:43] resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:14:45] God has sent in our hour you realize
[1:14:47] that you the whole world searching for a
[1:14:49] proof but that that that very proof of
[1:14:52] the Resurrection is living in
[1:14:53] 12-year-old girls in this building
[1:14:55] the very proof of the resurrections
[1:14:57] living in little teenage boys in this
[1:14:59] building because they've been filled
[1:15:00] with the holy spirit of God and that's
[1:15:02] the only Vindication that this world
[1:15:04] will ever see is the spirit of God
[1:15:06] living in you they're not going to go
[1:15:07] find a tomb somewhere and take some DNA
[1:15:10] to be able to prove it they're not
[1:15:11] they're not going to go to the Sea
[1:15:12] somewhere and find some proof to be able
[1:15:14] to prove it but the Bible tells me all
[1:15:16] the way from the book of of Genesis to
[1:15:18] the Book of Revelation that that
[1:15:20] Vindication comes from the presence of
[1:15:22] God or the spirit of God being present
[1:15:24] in his church church he said it's a
[1:15:27] Vindication of the Resurrection can I
[1:15:28] say it like this if it's a Vindication
[1:15:30] of the Resurrection it's a Vindication
[1:15:33] in the United States it's a Vindication
[1:15:35] in India it's a Vindication in Africa it
[1:15:38] don't matter where you go in this world
[1:15:39] they receive the same Vindication that's
[1:15:42] why Jesus was preaching it that it had
[1:15:44] to be testified in every language of the
[1:15:46] resurrection of Jesus Christ that they
[1:15:48] would go into all the world and preach
[1:15:50] the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:15:53] Jesus had ordered in Luke 2 four he said
[1:15:56] he said that repentance and remission of
[1:15:58] sins would be preached among all nations
[1:16:01] beginning at Jerusalem ain't that what
[1:16:03] they did here they were sitting there
[1:16:05] that day brother Mark and they were
[1:16:06] praying they were caring all of a sudden
[1:16:08] when the Holy Spirit fell on them and
[1:16:10] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:12] they came out speaking in tongues you
[1:16:14] you know I know I know many people quote
[1:16:16] this they don't quote it right but a lot
[1:16:18] of people say well they were speaking in
[1:16:19] unknown tongues but the Bible don't say
[1:16:21] they were speaking in unknown tongues
[1:16:22] they were well-known tongues but the
[1:16:24] Bible said they spoke spoke in other
[1:16:25] tongues in other tongues in a way that
[1:16:27] when the men heard them from other
[1:16:29] nations they said how is it that every
[1:16:31] one of us are hearing in our own
[1:16:33] language how how is it that that I'm
[1:16:35] from galatia but I hear my own language
[1:16:37] and this one's from Persia and he hears
[1:16:39] in his own language and the Bible said
[1:16:40] there was devout men in Jerusalem from
[1:16:42] every nation under the heaven was
[1:16:44] present that day what was it it was the
[1:16:46] spirit of God manifesting himself and
[1:16:49] going into those men that they could
[1:16:51] preach it around the world and fulfill
[1:16:53] the very words of Jesus Christ
[1:16:55] every man heard them speaking his own
[1:16:57] language they begin to say Well they're
[1:16:58] crazy and they're drunk men and how how
[1:17:00] are they speaking all these foreign
[1:17:01] languages where where do they get this
[1:17:03] from but Peter stood up and he said this
[1:17:05] ain't this ain't a bunch of drunk men he
[1:17:07] said this is the promise that the
[1:17:08] prophet Joel spoke of that I will pour
[1:17:10] my spirit out upon All Flesh and they
[1:17:12] will prophesy of the mighty works of God
[1:17:15] here were men and women that were
[1:17:17] standing there filled with the Holy
[1:17:18] Ghost that were prophesying and telling
[1:17:20] of the works of God and brother said all
[1:17:23] those that heard him when they repented
[1:17:24] and they they received the the baptism
[1:17:26] of the Holy Ghost 3,000 Souls that were
[1:17:28] saved when they received the spirit of
[1:17:30] God they became carriers to the world to
[1:17:33] take that very Spirit or the life of
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ they didn't take his body
[1:17:37] they didn't take a piece of his clothes
[1:17:39] they didn't take a little chunk of the
[1:17:40] Cross so that they could be represented
[1:17:42] but they took the very life of Jesus
[1:17:44] Christ that was born on the inside of
[1:17:46] them and they became carriers around the
[1:17:48] world to manifest the resurrection of
[1:17:50] Jesus Christ a confirmation of his
[1:17:54] Covenant so here the prophecy was
[1:17:56] fulfilled and the Covenant was confirmed
[1:17:59] this is what God was doing the prophecy
[1:18:01] fulfilled the Covenant was confirmed and
[1:18:04] Paul said he became the curse for us God
[1:18:07] AC accepted him by the presence of that
[1:18:10] great light to see so here he came into
[1:18:12] the church and he proved to the church
[1:18:14] that I have accepted this sacrifice
[1:18:16] that's why Paul would say that the
[1:18:18] spirit of God would on the Believers
[1:18:20] through faith faith in what in Christ
[1:18:23] Jesus say see that's where we are today
[1:18:26] you realize we have a god that is able
[1:18:29] I'm going to hurry up we have a god that
[1:18:31] is able to fulfill his covenants isn't
[1:18:34] that wonderful by the time he's able to
[1:18:36] fulfill it you think about it it matters
[1:18:38] it matters who gives the
[1:18:41] promise it matters who makes the
[1:18:43] Covenant because some may not have the
[1:18:45] ability to perform it but who could heal
[1:18:47] listen what was the curses who could
[1:18:50] heal our sickness who could heal who
[1:18:52] could could save us from destruction who
[1:18:54] could Deliver Us from poverty who who
[1:18:57] who would make a way of Escape who would
[1:18:59] be able to fulfill this curse well
[1:19:02] notice who it was that spoke to Abraham
[1:19:04] see before God ever makes the Covenant
[1:19:06] he first tells Abraham who it is that's
[1:19:08] talking to him I love this y'all's about
[1:19:10] preached out but I'm
[1:19:11] going the Bible says when God came to
[1:19:14] him the Lord appeared to Abraham see it
[1:19:16] matters who's doing the who's doing the
[1:19:18] talking the Lord appeared to Abraham and
[1:19:21] when he came to him he said unto him I
[1:19:23] am the almighty God God walk before me
[1:19:27] and be thou perfect now you know that
[1:19:29] word almighty God when you look this
[1:19:31] word up in the Hebrew this word says an
[1:19:35] El
[1:19:36] Shai so here God would speak to Abraham
[1:19:39] and he would say this an i El Shai I am
[1:19:42] the almighty God when you look into the
[1:19:44] depth of that word that word El Shai it
[1:19:47] actually means the bosom or the breast
[1:19:49] of God so here God is telling Abraham
[1:19:52] walk before me but here I am the god
[1:19:55] that is able to give you strength
[1:19:56] there's going to come a time in this
[1:19:58] walk whenever you that you have no
[1:20:00] strength there's going to come a time
[1:20:01] where you feel like you can't go another
[1:20:03] mile there's coming a time when you feel
[1:20:05] like that you can't fulfill this promise
[1:20:07] or you can't this Covenant can't be
[1:20:08] fulfilled in your life you're going to
[1:20:10] feel like giving up you're going to go
[1:20:11] through stages that you're laying by the
[1:20:13] wayside there's a you're going to go
[1:20:14] through times it may be months it may be
[1:20:16] years that that you just completely give
[1:20:18] up but I want you to know I am El SHI
[1:20:21] I'm the place the the breasted God the
[1:20:24] place where you can go and draw strength
[1:20:26] from God here you can come to me and you
[1:20:28] can whenever you get down you can
[1:20:30] nourish back to strength you you and in
[1:20:32] one place you'll be able to find healing
[1:20:34] and you'll also be able to find
[1:20:36] Salvation brother said it was both part
[1:20:38] of the New Covenant that God had made
[1:20:40] with him every part of it was fulfilled
[1:20:42] in what God was in that name elai he
[1:20:45] said it was healing for the Natural Body
[1:20:47] it was salvation for the soul and
[1:20:48] friends I've got news for you this
[1:20:50] morning it wasn't just in the Old
[1:20:51] Testament but Jesus fulfilled that same
[1:20:54] thing for the Bible said he was wounded
[1:20:56] for my transgression and by his Tri I
[1:20:59] was healed so if El Shai provided
[1:21:02] salvation and healing in the Old
[1:21:04] Testament it was still El sh die in the
[1:21:06] man Jesus Christ that provides salvation
[1:21:09] and healing he said I'll take my wounds
[1:21:11] upon my body that you'd be able to
[1:21:13] receive the healing in yours I'll take
[1:21:15] Strife that you'd be able to receive
[1:21:17] salvation oh friends in in the Old
[1:21:19] Testament he was El Shai in the New

[1:21:40] strength of Eli draw from the strength
[1:21:43] of almighty God it don't matter what you

[1:21:55] been you keep drawing from the breasted
[1:21:58] God that is able to give you strength he
[1:22:01] said when you draw from God your
[1:22:03] strength will begin to renew he'll all
[1:22:05] of a sudden things in your life will
[1:22:07] begin to straighten up your arms will
[1:22:09] begin to move out your heart will begin
[1:22:11] to to be normal your eyes will be
[1:22:13] brighter again just keep
[1:22:15] drawing until you have the strength that
[1:22:18] you need you say Lord I you promised it
[1:22:21] and I'm a Seed of Abraham oh how many
[1:22:23] say that this morning I'm the promised
[1:22:25] Seed of Abraham and you said it as your
[1:22:27] child I'm drawing from this promise he
[1:22:29] said it's thus sayeth the
[1:22:32] Lord It's thus sayith the Lord he'll
[1:22:35] give you strength cuz you're the Seed of
[1:22:37] Abraham I'm El Shi what a what a word to
[1:22:40] tell Abraham I'm El Shi walk before me
[1:22:43] and be thou perfect oh God I feel weak

[1:22:57] draw from the strength of
[1:22:59] God he said he'll give you strength he
[1:23:03] said you may say I'm sicker than I ever
[1:23:04] was he said but keep
[1:23:07] drawing it may look worse than it ever
[1:23:09] was but keep drawing you may have gone
[1:23:12] farther than you've ever gone but keep
[1:23:14] drawing said you're Abraham's seed so
[1:23:17] speak like Abraham I stagger not at the
[1:23:20] promise of God through unbelief but I'm
[1:23:22] strong in faith and I'm giving glory to
[1:23:24] God for the promise said it would be so
[1:23:27] and keep on drawing amen he said he's
[1:23:29] the same El Shai tonight he changes not
[1:23:32] and his Covenant people have the same
[1:23:34] privilege to draw from this same
[1:23:35] resource that Father Abraham had to draw
[1:23:38] cuz God swore by the same Covenant that
[1:23:41] he would give us the promise oh that
[1:23:43] don't that make you want to shout this
[1:23:44] morning that if Abraham could draw from
[1:23:46] him hear that God gave you the same
[1:23:48] promise to draw from God let me tell you
[1:23:51] friends in the same Covenant I'll tell
[1:23:52] you what may it just makes me want to
[1:23:54] shout every time I look at on the news
[1:23:56] and I see that great nation of Israel
[1:23:58] you realize the very same Covenant that
[1:24:00] promised that Israel would be a great
[1:24:01] nation is the very Covenant that
[1:24:03] promised that you could possess the
[1:24:04] promises of God so every time you see
[1:24:07] that flag flying over there you can just
[1:24:09] say well praise the Lord the promises of
[1:24:11] God are true for God gave him what he
[1:24:13] said he would give them and he'll give
[1:24:15] me what he said he'd give me and I'm
[1:24:16] going to keep drawing why because it was
[1:24:18] the promise of el Shai the almighty God
[1:24:23] think about it the natural seed is still
[1:24:26] standing let me tell you a secret I may
[1:24:28] as well just let it out there there
[1:24:30] there's no Hamas there's no there's no
[1:24:33] nation in the world that will ever
[1:24:35] destroy that Nation I know they make all
[1:24:37] threats and we're going to wipe it off
[1:24:38] the face of the Earth but they never
[1:24:40] will it was promised by God that they
[1:24:42] would possess that land and that would
[1:24:43] be their land and they'll have it it
[1:24:45] don't matter how mad the world they can
[1:24:46] do the protest and all these liberal
[1:24:48] wacky things that people get going but
[1:24:50] you'll never destroy that Nation because
[1:24:52] God has established it there he set the
[1:24:54] boundaries he set them in that place he
[1:24:57] brought judgment against the amorites
[1:24:58] and amalekites and all those that
[1:25:00] inhabited that land because of their
[1:25:02] iniquity and he gave it unto his
[1:25:04] children and that same God that gave
[1:25:06] that to them has given you the promise
[1:25:09] Paul said of the spirit of God to
[1:25:12] vindicate the resurrection of Jesus
[1:25:13] Christ where will you see him
[1:25:15] resurrected you'll see him in
[1:25:17] you that's where you'll see that's where
[1:25:19] you'll witness the greatest witness of
[1:25:22] the Resurrection is knowing what God has
[1:25:24] changed changed in you when he took the
[1:25:26] desire to sin out of your life and he
[1:25:29] put a desire to serve God in you what
[1:25:31] was it it was a resurrection of a seed
[1:25:33] that was laying on the inside of you and
[1:25:35] in the presence of that great life that
[1:25:37] seed come to life and all of a sudden
[1:25:40] you realize I'm not the same person that
[1:25:41] I used to be it's a Vindication of the
[1:25:44] resurrection of Jesus
[1:25:46] Christ said see if that natural seed is
[1:25:50] still standing and what about that Faith
[1:25:52] seed Paul said you are the children of
[1:25:55] God by faith in Christ for as many as
[1:25:57] You' have been baptized into Christ you
[1:25:59] put on Christ there's neither Jew nor
[1:26:01] Greek there's neither Bond nor free
[1:26:02] there's neither male nor female for you
[1:26:04] are all one in Jesus Christ and if you
[1:26:08] are Christ then you are Abraham's seed
[1:26:10] and your heirs according to the promise
[1:26:13] you know what that means if there is
[1:26:14] still a Seed of Abraham then there's
[1:26:17] still an El Shai that made the
[1:26:19] promise he's still keeping us he's still
[1:26:22] giving us strength now notice according
[1:26:24] to this Covenant we are his Covenant
[1:26:26] people I'm going to close with this we
[1:26:28] are his Covenant people so if we are
[1:26:31] God's covenant people then we're not
[1:26:33] living under the curse but we're living
[1:26:35] under the blessing see so if you're
[1:26:37] under the Covenant of Abraham then what
[1:26:39] did Paul say then you receive the
[1:26:41] blessing of Abraham by a't that good
[1:26:43] people try to put curses on you all the
[1:26:45] time but it don't ever work why because
[1:26:47] you're not living under a curse you're
[1:26:48] living under a blessing see why it's
[1:26:50] important to recognize the Covenant that
[1:26:52] God has has called you in and it's
[1:26:54] important to find your place so when the
[1:26:55] Devil comes and says you'll never be
[1:26:57] able to serve God and you'll never be
[1:26:58] able to be a Christian you'll never be
[1:27:00] able to live this life and all these
[1:27:01] things that he tells you you can go
[1:27:03] right back to that Covenant say but
[1:27:04] devil it wasn't you that made the
[1:27:06] Covenant it was God that made the
[1:27:07] Covenant with the Seed of Abraham and
[1:27:09] when I read it right there my Bible says
[1:27:11] that because I have faith in Jesus
[1:27:13] Christ that I am that Seed of Abraham
[1:27:15] therefore the promise that God made to
[1:27:16] Abraham applies to
[1:27:18] me see because I know who I am he said
[1:27:21] you're the children of God by faith in
[1:27:23] Jesus Christ you're Abraham's seed to
[1:27:26] see so because we're God's covenant
[1:27:27] people therefore I'm not living under a
[1:27:29] curse so Satan can't bring a curse on me
[1:27:31] for I'm living under a blessing said see
[1:27:33] because we're living under the blessing
[1:27:34] of Abraham but Mark then that means we
[1:27:36] receed the benefits that God had for
[1:27:38] Abraham and Abraham's seed let me tell
[1:27:40] you friends I'm not looking for a curse
[1:27:43] I'm not looking for Destruction I'm not
[1:27:45] looking for sickness I'm not looking for
[1:27:47] poverty I'm not looking for failure I'm
[1:27:49] looking for the blessings of God you say
[1:27:51] how can you preach it because the Bible
[1:27:53] promised to me for David said I praise
[1:27:56] the Lord oh my soul and forget not all
[1:27:59] of his benefits for he forgives your
[1:28:01] iniquities he heals your diseases he
[1:28:03] redeems you from destruction he crowns
[1:28:06] your life with tender Mercy he satisfies
[1:28:08] your mouth with good things so that your
[1:28:11] youth is renewed Like an Eagle it's God
[1:28:13] that took away our sickness it's God
[1:28:15] that took away our destruction it's God
[1:28:18] that filled your mouth and took away
[1:28:19] your poverty and he gave you the very
[1:28:21] blessings of almighty God David said and
[1:28:24] the Lord is merciful and he is plenteous
[1:28:27] he's gracious and he's plenteous in
[1:28:28] Mercy he's slow to anger he may he may
[1:28:31] be angry for a little while but his
[1:28:33] anger will never will never last for the
[1:28:35] mercy of God will always override his
[1:28:38] anger he said he didn't deal with us
[1:28:40] after our sins listen to The Promise
[1:28:42] David made God don't deal with you after
[1:28:45] our sins or reward us according to our
[1:28:48] iniquities because we're the Seed of
[1:28:50] Abraham God don't give you what you
[1:28:53] deserve you know what we deserve death
[1:28:55] but that ain't what God gives you
[1:28:57] because you're the Seed of Abraham he
[1:28:59] said he hasn't dealt with us after our
[1:29:01] sin he don't deal with us he don't
[1:29:03] reward us according to our
[1:29:05] iniquities he don't give us what we
[1:29:07] deserve oh my can you imagine when you
[1:29:10] talk to your mom remember when my mama
