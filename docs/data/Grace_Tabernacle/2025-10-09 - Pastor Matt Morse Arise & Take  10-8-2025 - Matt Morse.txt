How many say, "God's been good to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't think of a day that goes by that God hasn't done something for me and I don't let a day go by that I don't thank him for what he does. Amen. certainly love the Lord and just say it's good to be back in the uh house of the Lord with you tonight and we sure enjoyed our uh meeting and went up to Ohio and as brother Wayne and their church there in Ohio and had a wonderful time there and visiting with the saints and uh they asked that we bring greetings back to the church tonight and uh there's several that are coming down for the tent meeting next week. So, uh, we just, uh, really enjoyed the time and and just seeing, uh, the Lord, uh, come by and move in a special way and, uh, so we just want to want to remember the meetings that are coming up. I know we're certainly looking forward to what God has in store and seeing the guys putting up the tents there before church and and uh, and I don't know if they was expecting it, but they got about halfway done. We fenced them all in with cars. They may as well just they just stuck here. So, they had They may had to find a way out. It's like, but but if if we got to we got hold them here one way or another, we'll we just uh just get them in here. No, we sure appreciate these young men that stayed out there and helped. And want to remember uh brother uh Andrew tonight asked for prayer. They're is preaching for brother David Templeton over in Alabama uh tonight. So remember them in prayer. Also, please pray uh for my grandson Jackson. He fell and has hurt his arm. That's from brother Ed. So, we just want to ask the Lord to touch him. And you they I know God is certainly more than able and I've I've had an experience with broke arms and broke legs and and I've seen God do the miraculous. So, we just trust the Lord to do what God does tonight. Amen. And certainly good to see Sister Sandy back uh uh tonight and and had a good trip. Brother Roy and Sister Judy. And um we just been blessed that they've had Lord has led them to be here at our church and make this their home church. And uh so we certainly appreciate them being here elders uh in this gospel and they mean a lot to me and they'll certainly mean a lot to our church. And uh so we appreciate them. And isn't God good? Amen. He's he's always taking care of his children. And we just want to be in the will of God. And I believe that's the desire of every son and daughter of God is to be in the will of God. And uh so we certainly ask that tonight. Maybe if you have a need on your heart, uh won't you just ask the Lord to come? I believe that he's certainly uh more than able to do just that. And uh just pray each one in your own way. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, how we love you tonight, Lord. And God, we thank you for another opportunity to come and just to share the gospel, Lord, with people that are here with open hearts. And Lord, we have a a strong desire, Lord, to to grow in the word of God. And Lord, we just ask you tonight, Lord, that you would bring a special anointing among the church. And Lord, that you would answer every question, Lord, you would meet every need. And God, may we just get out of the way tonight, Lord, to give you a liberty to do just that. And Lord, those that need healing, Lord, I pray that you'd give healing in their body. Lord, maybe somebody just needs a word of encouragement tonight, Lord. You're more than able to do just that, Lord. And we just ask you to come, Lord. And we'll be careful to give you the glory for all that's done, Lord. For these needs that were read out loud, Lord. I pray you would meet them tonight, Lord. Touch their bodies. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We just say it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. We want to invite you to the scripture uh to the book of Genesis and we're going to read one verse out of the 19th chapter and we'll read out of the 15th verse. So Genesis 19 and 15 and give you just a moment uh to turn there. Genesis 19 and 15. How many's looking forward to the meetings there? Amen. We are excited. a lot of people that are coming that's been calling and texting and and so we're looking looking forward to that and and and it just it's just something together uh with people of like precious faith. Amen. That uh I know this when I uh you know I have needs in my own life and I can't think of anybody to go to except for people of faith. When you have real needs uh that's the kind of people you turn to. So when you have a meeting and have people gather like that, it's just um uh I just can't wait to see what God has in store. Amen. So I want to read tonight uh Genesis the 19th chapter. We're going to read out of the 15th verse. And the Bible says, "And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city." And we'll just ask the Lord to add his blessings to the reading of the word as you take your seats. Take thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. I'd like to take this uh uh scripture tonight and speak on arise and take. Arise and take. This was the instruction of the angel of the Lord to Lot. Arise and take. You know, this scripture has been used many times in speaking on escaping from judgment or uh making preparation for the coming of the Lord. And uh uh there's been many many sermons no doubt preached out of this very uh out of this very scripture. But you know, when you read this, you really can see a an an act of the grace of God here uh that God would go into a place of judgment and send an angel into a place of judgment. And I thought here it's such a wonderful type as an act of grace because uh God was not willing to leave them in a Sodom condition. The these were people that belong to God and he wasn't willing uh to leave them in this place. But uh that before judgment would come here with this angel would come on his way and the angel would carry a message uh the message of arise and take what is thine. I thought what a message for an angel to carry uh in a time of judgment is to arise and take what is thine. And uh you know they didn't realize that whenever they was following uh those men that those that those angels or the Bible said as these men would come uh to them it was just men that were sent there. But they didn't realize that following those men uh was their only way to escape judgment. They couldn't foresee judgment. They didn't foresee uh fire and brimstone. They had no vision of it. they had uh the only thing that they had was the word of the men that were standing in their house uh that was trying to offer them a way of escape and given an instruction. And so uh in reading this I I just there's so much power in this scripture. I could take a whole series on this one scripture, but uh just to take a little bit direction this uh or tonight, but uh in reading this, it shows us a principle theme in the whole entire Bible or or or a requirement that God has to every believer. You find this throughout the scripture. uh first in that God never judges without first bringing a warning. So, it's something that we can uh that we can uh uh stand upon tonight that God's always going to bring a warning before he brings judgment. But, uh then also that when God gives a warning, the warning is not just a blanket warning. You know, it's easy for somebody to come by and say, "Uh, there there's a fire coming. There's a fire coming." But that don't really help you because you you may run this way or or you ever seen a tornado siren go off and and my when the tornado sirens people run everywhere. One's going east, one's going south, one's going west because they don't know where the tornado is. So, uh, just a warning isn't good enough because you may run right into trouble while you're trying to flee trouble and and run right into it. But whenever God gives a warning, his warning always provides a leading or it provides a direction for the church or his children. And so, uh, God always gives us something to follow after, you know. And so I I followed this through the scripture and thinking about how God would find us in a condition and then try to lead us out of it. And uh in the warning it would provide a leading and I came to Jesus even whenever Jesus would speak to the to the disciples Jesus would say Matthew 16:24 he said if any man that will come after me somebody say any man. You know what that means? That it's the same instruction for everybody. It don't matter if you're rich. It don't matter if you're poor. It don't matter if you're a great pastor or a little person. however you feel. But Jesus said, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." I think that's wonderful because it shows us that God is no respector of persons. And Jesus gives this out to anybody. It don't matter who you are. It don't matter where you come from or what kind of background or what you've been taught or who you've been raised under. But Jesus said, "If any man will come after me," he gives us all the same instruction. He said, "Deny himself and take up his cross and come and follow me." You know, I want to I want to lay this out here tonight that first off, when Jesus makes this statement, Brother Joe, that this cross was not a literal cross. He he didn't looking for us to go build a wooden cross and pack it on our shoulders and and drag it around the world. So, the cross was not something that was literal that we're packing around. And neither was the following of Jesus meant to be some carnal thing. The car the cross wasn't a carnal thing. Your carnal mind makes it to be this this big image made out of cedar wood. But the cross wasn't a carnal thing. And neither is following Jesus a carnal thing. But to follow after Jesus, what he's telling us is to come into this place, a a spiritual place with God in order to be able to follow him. So following Jesus is not a carnal thing. It's a spiritual act. Carrying the cross, it ain't a carnal thing. It's a spiritual thing. I and I know to some people sometimes it seems odd when you start talking about following Christ in a spiritual manner, but this is what he's calling the church to. And but can I tell you what Paul said? 1 Corinthians, he said, "But the natural man," the reason it seems odd to be a spiritual person or or to follow spiritually. He said, "Because the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to the natural man, neither can he even know them because they are only spiritually discerned." So spiritual things aren't discerned by a natural man. They're not discerned by a carnal mind. A spiritual thing can only be discerned by a spiritual mind. Therefore, it can't be judged. It can't be talked about. It can't be explain. That's why that's why the world looks at at a spiritfilled church and sometimes it's easy to look at spiritual things and say, "Well, that and call them fanatical." It's easy for an outsider. Well, I may as well preach. But it's easy for an outsider to say to call a spiritual person a fanatic. It's easy for them to look at you and say you belong to a cult. It's easy for them to look at you and say uh what you believe is false because because you can't discern spiritual things with a carnal mind. And friend, I I got news for you tonight. I I don't I don't entertain devils. Can I can I just lay this out here tonight? I I don't entertain devils. there. There's no demon spirit that's going to come to me and tell me and challenge the spirit of God or or or or a spiritual move of God and challenge it with some theology or some thought that man made or something that they read on the internet. I don't entertain devils. I I'm not going to sit down and let them fill my mind full of a bunch of garbage and well, here's the way I I think it is and look at where this came from and you know this person sat over here. I'm not letting a carnal mind, some carnal-minded devil that was anointed uh uh that anointed somebody to come and sit in my presence to entertain. I'm not not going to entertain him to uh to to allow him to to lead me away from the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; You know, I had a I had a teacher one time when I was in uh uh in the music department and and I and I'm he was he was a a trumpet instructor and that's all he did was taught trumpet. I remember uh one day I was sitting in his office and he was talking about all these orchestras and things that was going on. And I I made this statement. I regretted making it after I did. But I made this statement. I said, "Well, you know, the worst thing about an orchestra is all the stringed instruments." I said, "I can't stand them violins and stuff in there. They sound I just don't like the way they sound." He just stood up and put his hand up. He said, "Boy, you're showing your ignorance." Well, I didn't, you know, I it took me a while to understand what he meant by it. He said, "But it's not an orchestra without the stringed instrument." You know, and I thought, you know, you know, I used to hear him say that. I thought, you know, it took me a while to understand that, but you know, I think that's going to be my new saying. Next time somebody comes to sit down anointed by a devil to try to challenge the spiritual things of God, it's okay just to look right back at them and say, "Well, I say this nicely, but you're showing your ignorance." See, because you're speaking from a natural mind or from a carnal mind, and ignorant ain't a bad thing. It just means you don't know any better. So, so your ignorance is on fine display. Sometimes when the devil, well, I may as well preach it anyway. But sometimes when the devil sits down in your living room or picks up the phone and he uses somebody to try to uh to try to point out negative things about a move of God, well, if they ain't a spiritual person, I certainly wouldn't listen to them when they're talking about spiritual things. They're just showing their ignorance. See, it's easy to look at spiritual things and call them fanatical whenever you're a carnal-minded person. You got to be careful with it though because you because the spirit of God is what God is using to lead the church. &gt;&gt; So be careful what you call carnal. Be careful what you call man-made. Be careful what you call man following because spiritual things were made by God. The very God that created the heaven and the earth. And if you don't understand it, then just leave it alone and don't understand it. But don't ever stand and call something that God called spiritual and you call it carnal. That's what they done in the days of Noah when Noah went out and he built an ark. And the Bible would say as he would he would go through all of this to build. So many would stand around Noah and talk to Noah. I wonder how many times that somebody came by Noah and said, "Well, that's just the goofiest thing I've ever seen." How how silly that is. Why you call that God? That ain't God. This temple over here that we built, that's what God is. What do you got to do with God? What's a boat going to help us? But you know, let me tell you what happened one day. That same Noah us stood at the door of that hour with a proclamation that the hour is at hand when the word of God that I spoke about is going to be fulfilled. And friends, let me tell you, there coming a day that there will be a voice at the door of the ark that will say the hour is at hand. That the word that you have heard is going to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And when Noah made that commandment, when he made that statement, it was God, the hand of God came into the land and he closed the door of the ark. And the Bible said that the waters begin to climb. Let me tell you what happened when the waters climbed. Every man that had a breath, he died in the water in the flood uh in the flood of the earth. But the only person that or the people that didn't was those that was in the ark. And the Bible said as the ar the waters rose, so did the ark rise. Isn't it something that the very thing that God sent to destroy the earth is the very thing that saved Noah and his family. &gt;&gt; But said, that's what's happened today. That's why people have gotten so off because the very thing that God sent to save the earth has become a stumbling block to the very world that God is trying to save. So, isn't that the truth? That's what the Holy Ghost done. If God sent a Holy Ghost to save us, that's become, you ever notice that's the stumbling block to the church? There's a there's millions of believers that'll follow after and believe the Bible and say and say, "Certainly, I'll believe that and be a, you know, some nominal Christian or something as long as I don't have to be spiritual." I may I may just say it what it is. As long as we can just be carnal church members, we'll be church members. I can go to work. I can give money. I can have a house. I can support. I can put my name on a door. We can be somebody as long as we don't have to be spiritual. You see where the stumbling block lays in the in in in the gospel, brother Mark, is being spiritual. It's the Holy Ghost. It it it's to be able to get out of our carnal mind and and fight out of this flesh and get into a spiritual place with God. The place that Jesus was inviting us to. This is the stumbling block to the world when they see people shouting in the presence of God and speaking in tongues and rolling around the floor and dancing and running around the building and shouting hallelujah. Well, I can I can do anything but I just don't want to be a part of that. It's became a stumbling block to the world. Holiness is a stumbling block to the world. Spiritual things are a stumbling block to the world. He &gt;&gt; said it become a stumbling block. He said the things the the Holy Spirit the very making the world don't want it. It's making the world where they don't want it. The things that the Holy Spirit causes you to do, it makes to where the world don't want it. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? The very thing that would save one would destroy another. &gt;&gt; He said the very thing they're turning down is what will take the church up. &gt;&gt; He said it's the Holy Spirit that's going to take the church in the rapture. Friends, the whole world, they can deny the Holy Ghost. But let me tell you what happens. When you deny the Holy Ghost, you just deny God. &gt;&gt; When you deny healing, you deny God. When you deny the move of God, you deny God. When you when you deny the rapture of the church, you deny God. When you deny the power of God, you deny God. When you deny move of the spirit, you're denying God. But I think what we need to do tonight, instead of denying God and denying the things of God and denying the Holy Ghost and denying the move of God and denying the spirit of God, I think what we ought to do is what Jesus said and deny ourselves and take up the cross and follow Jesus right into that spiritual place that he has called us into. I didn't come to deny God. I came to deny me. I wonder how many say amen tonight. How many real believers we got here? He's This is This ain't my words. This ain't something that was made up. This is what Jesus said. He said, "How many would deny theirel and take up their cross and follow me. &gt;&gt; I don't deny God. I deny me." &gt;&gt; When I read a scripture I come across, sometimes sometimes it's a little hard to read. Sometimes it don't strike you right. Sometimes it's corrective. Sometimes it makes you change the way you live and the change the way you dress and change the way you act. But when you read it, I don't want to deny the scripture. Let me just deny me. &gt;&gt; Don't deny God. Deny yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. and follow me. &gt;&gt; See, God has called the church to walk with him. Isn't that what he called? Come take up your cross, follow me. You say, "Well, what's going to happen whenever I start this kind of a walk?" And well, I'll just tell you, you go through the scripture, ask Enoch what happens &gt;&gt; when you walk with God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he walked with God and then one day he wasn't in this world no more. &gt;&gt; He walked so close to God and he literally exited the the very the very atmosphere of this world that we live in. And friends, let me tell you something tonight. You can walk close enough to God that you can physically walk out of the atmosphere of this world into a supernatural place with God to where the things of this world, they don't bind you. Sickness don't bind you. All these pressures of life, they no longer bind you. But you can enter into a place with God that you're completely out of the atmosphere of this world that would hold you down. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Said he walked out of this world in 12. He was where God had called him. Friends, don't you realize that's where we're heading tonight? One day you're going to take your last step on this earth. Let me tell you about these people. You can make fun of them. You can mock them. You can ridicule them all you want to, but let me tell you about these people here. One day they'll take their last step upon this earth and they'll walk right out of this world and enter into a heavenly place and a reunion with their God. You can call them what you want, but I say this tonight that every believer under the sound of my voice will step out of this world and step into eternity. There ain't one of us that'll miss you. When you belong to God and you're a believer and you're part of the bride of Jesus Christ, you don't have to worry about it. One day you'll take your last step through the muck and the mire. You'll drag your last burden. You'll carry your last load and you'll step right into eternity with God. &gt;&gt; Friends, there's many places we could go in this life that are great places. I know there's many things that we would desire to go to as men. There's many great events that no doubt that people line up in long lines to be able to get to. But there's one place that you better make sure you don't miss. Friends, it's greater than any Super Bowl. It's greater than any VIP tickets. It's greater than any world movie premiere. It's greater than a dinner with any president of any country. I'm talking about a place to go with God where the elite of the elite will be the VIP of God, the bride of Jesus Christ. There's somebody's in the kingdom of God that'll be raptured off of this earth. &gt;&gt; There ain't no place I'd rather be. &gt;&gt; One day we'll march right out of this dimension into another. &gt;&gt; Enoch was a type of the bride of Jesus Christ. He's our type in the Old Testament. He the Bible says, "And he walked with God and he was not." &gt;&gt; You know, I love how simple that is. I just love it. And he walked with God and he was not. Don't that just simplify things. Can I say that again? Just let it sink in your heart. He walked with God and then he was not. Don't we make it so much harder than that? But he walked with God and he was not. Friends, don't you realize that there ain't no other walk that you can walk on this earth that has that destination &gt;&gt; but walking with him. &gt;&gt; Nothing else will bring you to that destination. This is the only walk that'll bring you to a rapture, &gt;&gt; bring you to this destination. &gt;&gt; See you realize that's that's why we're here. That's why we have a church. But Ram said that's our purpose is a closer walk with God. He said, "I believe that's what we can all do and believe is the Lord Jesus is with us and we're here to walk closer with him. &gt;&gt; I want to walk closer with him until one day I have the testimony that Enoch has." Friends, don't you realize there's going to be somebody that has the testimony of Enoch? I wonder how close to God I can walk. I I want to I want to interview Enoch and say, "How close to God did you have to walk that you could walk out of this world and go on a walk with God?" &gt;&gt; That's how close I want to walk with him. to walk with God. That's why we have meetings. That's why we preach the gospel. That's why we have a church because we have a we want to have a closer walk with God. We want to be able to introduce people in a walk in their life that that that that they can walk out of this world and the pressures of this life. We want to give people a relationship with God that God can lead them throughout their life, &gt;&gt; a closer walk with God. It gives you more of God. It gives you more revelation. It gives you more of the love of God. It gives you more of the things of God, of the nature of God, of the wisdom of God, a closer walk with God. It just makes you who you really are. &gt;&gt; This is what God is calling us to. Jesus said, "If anyone come after me, let him deny himself." It means lose sight of yourself. &gt;&gt; Forget himself and his own interest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Deny himself &gt;&gt; and take up the cross and cleave to me. &gt;&gt; Cleave to me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In living and in dying &gt;&gt; in our life, in our leaving this earth, brother Mark, it's to cleave unto the cross. But we're going to say that's what we need tonight. There's a whole church full of some soft hybrid flabby churches. Just make a confession. This is the truth. Just make a confession and you're a Christian. The whole world is full of people that'll just let you put your name on a book and be a Christian. As long as you sign this and put a here, let me get an offering. We'll put a little offering out there. as long as you put enough money in the offering plate. Well, well, that that's good enough. But friends, one day you'll find out it's all lies. It's all deception. There ain't there ain't but one way to really make it. He said that ain't that ain't a Christian life. The only real Christian life is to deny yourself and do what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; A Christian life is a life of self-denial. Deny yourself and take up your cross. Depend on him for everything that you have need of. &gt;&gt; Friends, let me tell you something about following God. It's not always an easy decision. But let me tell you this. There ain't one person today that's ever It's It's a hard decision. Let me tell you why. Because there ain't nobody that's ever walked with God that didn't have to first walk away from something else. &gt;&gt; Can I take a minute? &gt;&gt; Nobody's ever walked with God that didn't have to walk away from something. &gt;&gt; God, in order to have to draw closer to God, if you're calling closer to God, you're going further away from something. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You don't You have a front, you have a back. The farther you go this way, the farther you are away from that. So the the closer you go with God, the further away from something. We always come out of something. We always have to leave something. Remember when he called Peter, Peter had to leave his fishing boats over by the sea to follow Jesus. When he when he called Abraham, Abraham left his family and he went into the land that God called him. Noah, he he he left his he left his own dreams and his own ambitions and he and he dedicated his life to doing what God called him to do. See, you always have to leave something in order to go where God wants you. Enoch, he he he walked close to God. Moses, he he left the palace of Egypt just so he could be able to follow God where where he had a place where he could be the next Pharaoh. But Moses put it behind him and he went and he followed after God. This is a powerful point that I think about whenever you're walking with God that in order to get in order to get in with God, you have to get out of where you are. That's right. &gt;&gt; If God is calling you to this place, in order to get into this place with God, you're going to have to get out of something. See, otherwise, God wouldn't be calling you. He wouldn't that there's a call there for a reason because you're in something in some condition, in some spiritual condition or some place in your life, and God calls you out of it. But in order to get into that place with God, you got to come out of that. &gt;&gt; And so here, God is always calling us. That that's a powerful thing about the call of God. In order to get in, you must first get out. That's why he called us. That's why he sent Revelations 18. He said, "Come out of her, my people." That was the call of the message of the hour. Brother Mark is God is calling us out of something before he can take us into this place with God. &gt;&gt; Before there could ever be a rapture, there had to be a Revelations 18. &gt;&gt; There had to be a come out of her, my people. Before we could ever enter in with God, listen. Listen what the Bible said here. When the angels came to Lot, the men said to Lot, "Has there any besides the son-in-law, the sons and daughters? But bring them out of this place, for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed and great." So here they're telling of the judgment that is coming. And the Bible said, "But when the morning arose, the angels hastened Lot and said, Arise and take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. Arise and take and lest thou be consumed." I thought what a call this is. You know, I looked back in Israel and saw how that before that whenever God would call call them on their wilderness journey, Brother Ben would use this as a tie. But do you realize that before they could ever enter into the promised land, they that before before Miam could ever uh dance with a tambourine on the on the bank of the river, before Joshua could ever march around the walls of Jericho, before Caleb could ever say, "Give me my mountain," there had to come a Moses that would call the people out of the condition that they were in. We read about the great victories and we have such a shout over the victories of entering into the promised land and inhabiting the land and feeding on the mana and seeing the uh the the water come out of a rock. But before they ever had a victory, they had to first come out of the condition that they were in. &gt;&gt; Before Joshua, before Caleb, there was a Moses saying, "Come out of her, my people." I thank God that he would send a message in this hour that would say, "Let my people go and come to this mountain where they can worship me." It's God's desire is for us to come into a place of spiritual worship. His It's his desire for us to enter into a supernatural place with God. &gt;&gt; Come out of the carnal mind &gt;&gt; and into a spiritual place with God. &gt;&gt; But see, in order to in order to worship God and this place that God is calling us, you have to first come out of what you were under. &gt;&gt; Isn't it true? &gt;&gt; We've all been under something. said, "But you can't freely worship God if you're under bondage." &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been bound down where you couldn't worship? Can I get some hands? &gt;&gt; Thank you, elders. God bless y'all being honest. It helps the young people. &gt;&gt; We've been bound down so much. I didn't feel like worshiping God. I've been I've been so bound. I I've been in such depression that I wouldn't worship God. I know what it's like to be in such a low state that you couldn't worship God. But in order to get to that place with God, I had to come out of that condition. It takes God, you know, I love them angels. Sometimes it takes just God to anoint somebody to come by your house and to take a hold of you and say, "Arise. Take and eat. Arise." Isn't that what happened happened to Elijah when he when he felt that way hiding underneath the juniper tree and the angel of the Lord came to him. He said, "Elijah, arise and eat. Don't don't lay down there in that weakened state. You don't you don't have to lay down there no longer, but God has provided a meal for you. He's prepared it before the foundation of the world that you can be strong. Arise and eat. &gt;&gt; God, his desire for us to worship. &gt;&gt; But you can't freely worship when you're under something, &gt;&gt; under bondage, depression, &gt;&gt; under sin, under condemnation, all these things that that we get under. But God has to call us out of it. &gt;&gt; Look, watch Apostle Paul. Whenever God called him, brother Bram said that Paul had a Christ centered call and that was his absolute. I thought, isn't that something? There's many people today that have callings that are not Christc centered. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; So, just having a call isn't good enough. Well, I got a calling on my life to preach. I got a call on my life to to do this kind of work. I got I got a calling on my life to sing. But but but the calling ain't good enough. He said he had a Christ centered call. &gt;&gt; You're talking about a real calling of God. See, it's centered around Jesus Christ. I think that I think that's the problem today. There's many people that feel like, well, I've been called to worship God, but the problem is it ain't a Christ centered call. So they come to churches and they worship something. They worship men. They worship churches. They worship pastors. They worship priests. They worship bishops. They worship all they worship all kinds of things. But our but God has called us has given us an invitation to come out of that and to follow him and to worship God freely in spirit &gt;&gt; and in truth. &gt;&gt; See, when God calls you out of something, &gt;&gt; he's always calling you into something. &gt;&gt; Into something. If he's calling you into something, he's calling you out of something. They're they're connected. &gt;&gt; So if God calls you out of doubt, he's calling you into faith. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? If if God's calling you out of judgment, he's calling you into mercy. &gt;&gt; If God is calling you If God is calling you out out of the world, he's calling you into Christ. If he's calling you out of sickness, he's calling you into healing. If he's calling you out of death, he's calling you into life. God God don't call you out without having a place for you to go. When God calls you out of something, he's leading you into something. He don't He don't intend on people just wandering around. Friends, let me tell you, God has given us a place for you to walk in. I think that's the problem today is there's too many people that's been called out that just haven't entered in. They came out of the world. They came out of the sin. They came out of a bar room. They came out they came out of uh uh some some uh ill-famed house. They come out of all these kind of conditions and denominational spirits and churches. All these things they come out of. but they just haven't entered in yet. But friends, I think it's time that we recognize that God called me out and God called me in. He didn't just call me out to sit on a church pew or call me out just to take up some space where I would sit somewhere. Now I'll sit somewhere else, but that ain't what called you to. He didn't call you from a bar stool to a church pew just to take up space. But when he called you out, he's calling you in &gt;&gt; to enter into this place of spiritual worship. &gt;&gt; This is our call of God. It's a call to enter in. God has calling this church to enter into a place of spirit. Let me tell you, friend, too long have we sit with carnal minds. Too long do we sit thinking on the things of the world and the things of the flesh and we're so bound down by the world that we can't even even enter into a move of God &gt;&gt; where something would happen or somebody gets sick. We're so running scared because we don't know what to do. But God is calling you to a place that you can get a hold of God. He's calling you to a place that you can have a be on friendship with God &gt;&gt; that when you have need of something &gt;&gt; friends it's different when you call your friend &gt;&gt; you know you get in some financial trouble when you call the bank sometimes they say yeah sometimes they say no &gt;&gt; I'm in bad trouble my truck payment's behind can I get another week no we don't give you too many weeks no more weeks but sometimes you just have to call a friend &gt;&gt; you know and a friend they they they do stuff different you ever seen a banker They go sell a trailer to help you out. Banker ain't selling the trailer. He's not your friend. Just a banker, but your friend, they try to do stuff. They'll they'll go work an extra shift or something to to help somebody. I want God to be a friend to me. &gt;&gt; I want to be a friend to God. &gt;&gt; I want to have a relationship with God that that when I need when I need God, I I can get a hold of him. When he needs me, he can get a hold of me. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of walk with God that we want. You see, when God calls you, he gives you a place to walk in. Can I take just a minute here? &gt;&gt; He gives you a place to walk in. &gt;&gt; Paul said 1 Corinthians 12:18, he said, "But now hath God set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him." &gt;&gt; Isn't that a powerful scripture? See, set means placed. God has placed every member in the body as it hath pleased him. &gt;&gt; It don't always please us. Oh, that's right. &gt;&gt; But he sets them in the body as it has pleased him. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? Not only did he give them a place or a position, but watch what Paul says. Paul actually uses the natural body to teach this. He talks about how some are hands, some are eyes, some are nose. Each one of us a different part of the natural body, but we're not really eyes. We're not really eyes of God and hands of God, feet of God in a natural sense, but in a spiritual sense. So when Paul's talking about this, it not talking about we're literally that, but what we are when he's talking about us being the body of Christ and some are hands and some are feet, some are nose. What he's actually speaking of is some are pastors, some are teachers, some are evangelists, some are singers, some are worship leaders, some are prayer warriors, some some some speak in tongues, some worship, some some interpret, some prophesy. God, he gave these gifts unto men. And so, so when he's talking about the members of this body, I love how Paul explains this because he says even in the natural body, some parts of the natural body are not as as popular as other parts. &gt;&gt; See that? This is Paul's preaching. He says, "So some things aren't aren't as as as popular as other parts." He says, "So what God does is he gives more honor to the parts that are less desirable so that there's no schism in the body." In other words, that there's no division in the body. So that means that don't matter where you are in the body of Christ. You could be the lowest person on the totem pole in your own mind. But Paul said, "But God gives more honor to the one at the bottom." So there is no division. That means the person that you would look in the natural eye and say, "We're the lowest one in the church." Which I don't believe that. But but but if you looked at in the natural eye and said, "Well, you know, that person preaches, so he must be real high. And this lady, she just cleans the toilet, so she must be real low." But Paul said, "No, that ain't it at all." He said, "But God gives more honor to the less desirable place, so there's no division in the body." He, in other words, they're all equally valuable to God. Isn't that powerful? So, it don't matter where God places you. That's why Brother Brandham could say, "It wouldn't matter to be a door mat in the house of God." That's why you could say that because it don't matter where God places you in the body. It's as equal value as where he puts anybody. So, we can come to God and trust him and say, "God, you just put me where you want me. You just use me where you need me &gt;&gt; and let me just be available. &gt;&gt; Come follow me. &gt;&gt; Deny yourself. &gt;&gt; And follow Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, each one of us, we're not all pastors. We're not all all preachers. We're not all evangelists. We're but we're all equally valuable in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? &gt;&gt; That's the way I believe it 100 100%. I believe what Paul taught. I believe there ain't a there ain't a little person in this church or or in any church that's lesser than another one or none greater than another. I don't believe that one ounce &gt;&gt; that one's better than this or this one or we ought to accommodate this more than that. I don't believe that. &gt;&gt; So, we're equally valuable &gt;&gt; in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Somebody turn around to somebody next to you and say, "You're valuable. &gt;&gt; You're valuable in the kingdom of God." Say, "See, we're all equally valuable." You say, "Well, brother Matt, I that that's a lot, isn't it?" &gt;&gt; Isn't that a lot? You want to You want to have a church that's in a revival? You want to have a church that the that which we we we're that kind of church. &gt;&gt; You want to have a church that's in a revival, the only way to have a revival is to catch that revelation that Paul preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that we are all important. &gt;&gt; Then you know what it causes you to do? It causes you to suffer when your neighbor's suffering &gt;&gt; because they're important. It caused you to rejoice when they're rejoicing. &gt;&gt; They they they got a game. Well, I didn't get the game, but I'm going to rejoice with them because I'm proud that they got it. &gt;&gt; I'm not jealous because something happened to my brother. Jared had 10 eggs. I'm not mad Jared had 10. God bless you. Hope he has 10 more. &gt;&gt; But you don't you're not you're not you're not jealous of somebody for for God blessing somebody. We want to say, "God, I thank you for for blessing my my brother." Because if it's a gain to them, it's a gain to me. I I want to see them grow. I want to see them encourage in the Lord. I want to see God strengthen them. I I want to see their family blessed. I don't want to see nobody cursed. I want everybody to be blessed of God. &gt;&gt; And when they're suffering, I want to suffer with them. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see them in trouble. That's why you lay awake at night in the middle of the night crying out to God because somebody's suffering. And you can't just Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; And you can't just lay all night and watch movies all night and and not worry about what's going on with anybody else. If you really care about people, you got to take some time and think about the the suffering of others and spend time in prayer and supplication for them. &gt;&gt; Because you care. &gt;&gt; I suffer when you suffer. We rejoice when you rejoice. &gt;&gt; See, we're part of the kingdom of God. Paul said God placed us. I get a little sidetracked. &gt;&gt; God placed us. says, "And notice how that Joshua done whenever Joshua came into the promised land, the Bible tells us that Joshua divided all of the inheritance &gt;&gt; to the to the children of Israel to each tribe of of Israel and said each person said they were placed positionally exactly the way their Hebrew mothers had named them when they came to Palestine. Asher and Gad and Efali each one Judah they were all placed in their position. So what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of God's placing in the church. So here when Joshua, you know, Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost, but I I love this because Joshua, the Bible says that Joshua placed them. It was Joshua himself that placed him. And Joshua being a type of the Holy Ghost. So who is it that's placing us in this age? It's not somebody. It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So we allow the Holy Spirit to place us in the body. He said every member, every stone, every place, every Christian itself, it's always the Holy Ghost himself that is placing us in the body. And each one of us in our peculiar way has a place in the house of God. Isn't that right? Every one of us in our own peculiar way. You have a place in God's house. You know, it got me thinking about Solomon whenever they built the temple or Solomon's temple. When they went out and and to build that great temple, you realize they went and got stone from all over the world and different parts of the world and different caves and different mountains because this was going to be a grand temple before God. And and and when they brought the stones into the temple, some of them came all the way into Japa, some of them came by by wagons, some of them came by boats, some of them were shipped over. These stones were brought from all over to build the temple of God. But let me tell you something about those stones. Every one of them was a different shape. They were a different size. They were a different color. If you could look at one, they were peculiar stones. They were odd stones. They all they wouldn't know two of them alive, but they were bringing them to build the temple of God. And brother said that's a very beautiful type of today that's what we need a Joshua for. He said because the trouble is when people come into the promised land is the problem is is God wants to raise sheep like Ephraim and one man wants to raise cattle like another and every man wants to be the same. So God gives a man a gift of healing everybody wants to be a a healer. If God everybody wants a gift of healing if God uh gives a man one thing the other man wants it. He said, "But we are all divided in our own position. And we don't all have a gift of wisdom. We don't all prophesy. We don't all speak with tongues. We are not all prophets." But God has set in the church. Some that prophesy, some that speak in tongues. We want to make and we want to make them all speak in tongues. See the confusion that men has caused. &gt;&gt; They want to make every preacher the same. &gt;&gt; I may as well just lay it out there. &gt;&gt; They want to make every preacher the same. Well, if they don't preach like him, I don't want to hear them because they want to make them all the same. But they're different stones. They're peculiar stones. &gt;&gt; They're they're odd stones. Some of them are odd stones. They they look odd the way that we look at things. It ain't the way it ain't the kind of stone that you like to look at. &gt;&gt; We're odd stones. They're peculiar stones. &gt;&gt; But they were all used to build the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Said, "Here they come." Said, "God, some prophesy, some speak with tongues." He said, "Then you can't get nowhere. They can't ever overcome. He said, "But when each man, listen now, when each man by a leader separated them by spiritual discernment and place them into the body, there they remained and become the cream of the earth." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When that man, speaking of the Holy Ghost, when he could come and positionally place us in the body, he said, "There they become the cre cream of the earth." He said, "God, give us a Joshua today. Give us back a Joshua that will hold the commission with the word of God." They want to place us in our position in the body of Christ. Friends, let me tell you, there's all kinds of stones. They've been placed they've been placed by the master builder. Some fit Some fit in the corner. Some go to the basement. Some have to be a foundation. Some you never see. They're hid behind sheetrock. Some are some are placed at the altar and they're seen all the time. They're all different kinds of stone, but every stone was needed for the temple to be built. &gt;&gt; We're all different shapes, different sizes. But remember said, "I think down through time that God has cut some very odd stones." I say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; He said, "Down through time, God has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood, but they have their place exactly in the temple in the building of God." Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if we could look at each other that way, &gt;&gt; if you could look at other brothers and you know, instead of being so critical sometimes as we get, I don't mean to get on you tonight, but &gt;&gt; but instead of being so critical that we are about others that you know that you know, God cuts stones of all shapes and sizes, &gt;&gt; but they're used to build up this temple of worship that God is building. &gt;&gt; Well, you can you can you see the very picture he's building around the world. There's stones here and some some in Africa and some in India and some in the United States all around the world, South America. Here, God is building this great spiritual temple. One day, brother Mark, when the heavens open, they'll rise up and go right into the heavens with him. &gt;&gt; One day they I believe that. I believe there'll be a meeting in the air. And then that great city of God will sit down right upon this earth. And they'll come right into that city and fellowship with their God. It's what God is building. &gt;&gt; Stones of all shapes and all sizes. Let me tell you, there's a lot of odd shapes. &gt;&gt; Thank you for laughing, sis. She's a good lady. I didn't mean didn't mean to get you tickled. There's a lot of odd shapes. There's some odd shaped stones. &gt;&gt; Odd sizes. A lot of oddsized stones. I'm one of I I picked up Wayne's little grandson. Never met the boy in my life. He He come over there by me. He got up on my lap. I said, 'Well, buddy, it's good to meet you. You know, his family, well, I I I have seen him, but not since he's able to talk and stuff. And uh and so he he sat there and looked up at me. And after a minute, he just looked at me. He reached up and he grabbed my ear and he went. His mom said, "Yeah, they come in all sizes, don't thank you." Yeah. They come in all shapes and sizes. &gt;&gt; They're all different stones. We're all different. But let me tell you something about these stones. Although we're all different, but there is some things that all of the stones have in common. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to get all into it, but let me tell you what Peter said. All these stones are lively stones. &gt;&gt; None of them are dead weight. None of them are useless. None of them are are wasted. Peter said, "You as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." So it don't matter what stone you are. If you're a foundational stone, if you're a cornerstone, if you're a headstone, it don't matter what stone you are. We are all lively stones used in God's spiritual house to offer a spiritual sacrifice unto God. Friends, let me tell you, God is building a place of spiritual worship. He's building a church that he could have every every stone. Let me tell you, he's went all over this world to gather stones. He's went down into bar rooms. He's went down into old school houses. He's went down into some slaughter house of the world. And he's dug out stones. He's the best miner that there ever was. He's dug in the middle of caves. He's tore down mountains to get the some. He's went to the bottom of the sea. He'll go wherever he has to to find every predestinated stone of God. And he's brought them into the house of God to be a lively stone to build up a temple of God, a spiritual temple to bring a sacrifice unto him. &gt;&gt; These are God's tones. We're lively stones. Let me tell you friends, I'm not talking about being lively just to make a bunch of noise. That's what Pentecostalism is. I'm not talking about just making a bunch of noise. That don't save anybody. But let me tell you, if you ever come alive, all of a sudden, you can't help but making some noise. There's something in you that changes in you because God has awakened you. You've been quickened unto life. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you can shout all you want to. You can, you know, you say, "Well, shouting and dancing that make that don't make you saved." Let me tell you the difference between shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues and running the aisles and all this stuff that Pentecost does and and and the and people don't want to do because they don't want to be Pentecostal. But there's a difference whenever you shout. Can I have a minute? &gt;&gt; There's a difference when you shout and praise God and dance on the altar and all. that whenever you have an altar that is sanctified before God, &gt;&gt; the difference is found in the Old Testament when God is dealing with the priest and he says before you make a sacrifice before me, he said you shall anoint the altar and sanctify the altar and make an atonement for the altar for the altar must be holy. &gt;&gt; And then he said, whenever the altar is holy, then whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy. &gt;&gt; Well, where is that altar today? &gt;&gt; That altar is your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is that altar today? That altars your heart. &gt;&gt; So here in the Old Testament, you had to sanctify an altar before that you could offer a sacrifice if you wanted God to accept it. You see why running don't do it and emotion don't do it and shouting don't do it. But let me tell you what happens when the Bible if the altar is your heart, the Bible says, but what happened whenever the altar got sanctified, then whatever touched the altar became holy. So you show me a person with a sanctified heart, I don't care if they shout, it's a holy shout. If they raise their hand, it's a holy hand. If they're stomping and shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit, it's holy unto God because whatever touch the altar becomes holy because it's from a sanctified heart. &gt;&gt; And God has called us to sanctify the altar of God. Friends, once the altar sanctified, you go on and have church. Don't you hold back no more. The altar's sanctified. You see why Satan wants you to have so much condemnation. You see why he reminds you of the past. You see why he tempts you. He's trying to He's trying to keep you out of this spiritual place with God. He don't want you to deny yourself. He certainly don't want you to follow Christ. He don't want you to rapture out of this world. He wants you to be down that same pit he's in. &gt;&gt; So, he brings you down and brings all this on you so that you can't enter into this place with God. &gt;&gt; He's dragging you down all all this and bringing all this unbelief and all this stuff on you. Why? Because he wants you not to be able to feel free to worship. &gt;&gt; You know what you do? You repent. You sanctify the altar. &gt;&gt; You give your heart to God and you turn around and look the devil in the eye and said, "I can show you the place where I gave my life to God." &gt;&gt; I can show you the place where I walked away from this world. I got a right to raise my hand. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't you realize that we there's places in this world you can't do that. You We can't go out publicly and lift our hand. But but right here, I say, "I have a right to raise my hand. I have a right to dance in the spirit. I have a right to shout. I have a right to praise God. I have a right to sing. I've got a right to preach the gospel. It don't come from a man. It came from God. &gt;&gt; And God accepts it as a spiritual sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When it comes from a sanctified altar, &gt;&gt; some music players want to come. &gt;&gt; From an altar most holy. &gt;&gt; From an altar most holy comes a holy worship. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Go ahead and shout. &gt;&gt; It's an altar most holy. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and dance. It's an altar most holy. Don't be ashamed of it. Don't be ashamed of dancing in the spirit. It's an altar most holy. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed ashamed of praising God. It's an altar most holy. You know the altar. &gt;&gt; No man knows what altar what what what uh whether your altar was sanctified. You know that &gt;&gt; I sanctified it before God. &gt;&gt; An altar most holy brings holy worship. &gt;&gt; It's your right to worship God. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; It's your right to worship God. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you this tonight in closing. What if they wouldn't have accepted the place where Joshua gave them to inhabit? Can you imagine? Isn't that the way it is sometimes in the flesh? I'm not I'm I'm getting about halfway through and we'll pick it up Sunday, but you you can imagine what it would be like. Said, "Well, I don't I don't want that portion. I want this portion." says, "So the key to following the Holy Spirit was to accept the lot that was given to you by the Holy Spirit." That's what it means to deny yourself. &gt;&gt; I know it's a simple message, but I'm talking about bringing somebody out of carnality and into a real place of spiritual worship, &gt;&gt; a real place of fellowship with God. There's some key things. I accept what you made me. I accept where you've placed me. I'm not looking. See how easy it is? Satan wants you so unsatisfied. He can't help you looking around the internet everywhere trying to find something. He wants you unsatisfied with where you are. But if God could come tonight and tell you one thing, say, "But I brought you to this place. I need you in this place. So let me use you in this place. Deny yourself and take up your cross and follow me. Do you believe the Holy Ghost can still speak to you? &gt;&gt; I don't know anything else that speaks &gt;&gt; that's truth. We can sit and reason and try to figure and make things work out, but brother Mark, there's no other place to find truth, but the devil comes on the outside. You know how I know that it's true? Cuz Satan tells you that it ain't. The devil comes on the outside and he says, "Well, you're not being used. They don't really like you. They don't. Nobody even pays attention to you. You don't you don't really have a real play." So So the devil says all of that. What is he doing? It makes you feel like you're not valuable. And watch immediately what it does. Can I can I hit a spirit? Watch immediately what it does. It immediately brings what Paul was trying to stop. It immediately brings division between you and other believers. Paul said, "If we recognize that there is no schism in the body, there's no division." Immediately, when Satan gets your heart down that path, then there's division. You know what? They don't really don't really care much about me anyway. Yeah, I got other things to do today anyway. Immediately becomes divisive. It separates fellowship, separates. Isn't it true? If you felt like somebody don't like you, you don't want to hang out with them. Say, so what we do, we just go like them the more. make sure they don't feel that way. Friends, I don't believe in having five churches in one church. I don't believe that. I believe we're all one body in many churches, many places of fellowship. We're all one body. And I don't believe as a pastor that you just sit back and allow that to happen in the church. I don't believe that. I believe I have a a a right, not only a right, I believe I have an obligation as a pastor to combat that spirit and say that you should not have things between one another. You should be able to go to your brother and love them and help him and be an encouragement to them. And when you feel bad about somebody, you ought to be able to go to him and say, "Brother, I'm sorry I felt that way." &gt;&gt; I know people don't like this is old style preaching. &gt;&gt; But if you want to have a real revival, we're about to have a meeting next week. &gt;&gt; If you want to have a real revival, let me tell you how to get there. Don't wait until Wednesday of next week to start getting prepared for revival or a move of God in the meeting. You start doing that right now. &gt;&gt; Getting prepared in your heart. all they're we're doing all kinds of things to prepare the tent, prepare the sound, prepare all that in the natural, but what can we do spiritually to be prepared for a real move of God? We're hosting this meeting. I want people to be able to come in and and be able to get something from God. people that have real need needs, sicknesses, cancers, things that people have in their their body and in their life that they could come to this place and they can find their healing. They can find direction from God. They can hear from God. That's what we're creating. And God is using you stones. God is using you stones to do that very thing. Won't you stand to your feet tonight? [Music] I don't believe the spirit of division. I think the devil's a liar. Do you believe that tonight? Somebody say, "The devil's a liar." &gt;&gt; People get caught up there. They get caught out, but not in. God called you out of a lot of things, but don't get caught out and not enter in. He brought you here. Every one of us have a different testimony. Every stone come from a different place. We all come from something. But go ahead and enter in. Deny yourself. You know, you had to make give up a little bit of sleep. You had to give up a little bit of time to get into prayer and enter in before a service. You you had to give up some things. You had to deny your flesh &gt;&gt; to enter in this place. But I wonder how many as we bow our heads, you you could raise your hands, say, "Brother Matt, I want to do that." Here we got these meetings coming up and I want to be able to dedicate some time to allow God to be able to use me wherever he can use me. If he needs me to sing, I'll sing. If I need if I need to uh wash something, I'll wash some. If I need to hammer something, I'll hammer. If I if I need to preach, I'll preach. Lord, whatever you need me to do, Lord, let's just be a stone that is able to be used in the master's hand. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful for your presence here tonight, Lord. God, we just thank you, Lord. God, that you would be so mindful of us. You know what we have need of. And God, a spiritual church, Lord, you're calling us out of this world and into a walk with you, God. It's our desire to be so close to you, Lord, not to be caught up in this world and the things of this world. God, we just ask you, Lord, as we take this as a time, Lord, as our hearts begin to be prepared. And Lord, we just know that there's so many things that you have prepared for us and have in store. And God, I pray that you would bless this church, Lord. I pray, God, that you would help them, God. Each one, Lord, that you would give them a blessing for the effort that they have to put forth, God, to bring this kind of a meeting, God. May you just help each one. Give them strength and encouragement today. God, if there's something in any life, Lord, I pray that your hand of mercy would be upon us, Lord. May we give it to you tonight, God. May we surrender, Lord, every spirit, Lord, anything that's unlike you, God. May we have nothing wrong in our spirit, Lord. God, just be surrendered that you can use us, Lord.
