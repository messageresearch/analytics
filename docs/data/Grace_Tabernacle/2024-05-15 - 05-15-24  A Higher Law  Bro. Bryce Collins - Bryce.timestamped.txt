[47:06] Christian born again filled with the
[47:09] Holy Ghost on my way to
[47:12] heaven we're
[47:15] privileged and I often times we don't we
[47:19] don't realize how privileged we are
[47:21] we're we're we're in battles we're in
[47:24] struggles we're in fights and the life
[47:27] of a Christian is not a a flowery bed of
[47:30] ease but it's worth every bit of it
[47:34] every battle you face everything that
[47:36] you go through it's worth every bit of
[47:39] it and we look at what he did for us and
[47:43] what he went through for us is worth it
[47:46] amen amen don't you love the Lord Jesus
[47:50] amen it's so wonderful Amen to to know
[47:53] him and say God bless you to each one of
[47:56] you it's good to be with you and
[47:58] appreciate brother Matt and his uh
[48:02] kindness and uh you know inviting us to
[48:06] be with you and um we we're just uh
[48:10] passing through here we was coming as I
[48:12] think he said we was here to do a little
[48:14] bit of work and things and I told him I
[48:17] said we worked one time today and one
[48:20] and one way and now we're here working
[48:23] again amen praise the Lord but amen and
[48:27] this labor as the Bible says your labor
[48:32] in the Lord is not in
[48:34] vain all of our other
[48:37] labors you know someday is going to burn
[48:39] up and it's going to be gone but
[48:42] anything that we do in God's kingdom
[48:46] that will
[48:47] remain and so you live your life
[48:50] especially young people however much
[48:53] time we got left we don't know but as
[48:56] long as you're here here if you would
[48:57] focus your life on that and think
[48:59] everything that I do in God's
[49:03] kingdom my treasures are being laid up
[49:06] somewhere and they're going to meet me
[49:08] on the other
[49:09] side my treasures here are going to burn
[49:13] everything I labor for here is just
[49:16] we're just passing through we're we're
[49:18] just passing through this land we're on
[49:20] our way home amen and so we we we
[49:24] certainly uh are our privilege to to
[49:29] serve the Lord and to love him let's
[49:31] just before we go to the scripture let's
[49:33] just bow our hearts before the Lord and
[49:36] as we bow our hearts if you have a need
[49:39] upon your heart if you just take that
[49:42] before the Lord as we go to
[49:44] prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just bow
[49:49] our hearts before you and we know the
[49:52] songs of worship and praise have come
[49:55] forth Lord and surely your people have
[49:58] entered into that place and that
[50:00] atmosphere of worship and we now Lord
[50:03] approach your word which is the most
[50:06] important part and Lord we're all
[50:09] together insufficient Lord as a a man to
[50:13] to try to handle this word but Lord our
[50:16] sufficiency is in you and God we're
[50:19] asking Lord that you would bless Lord
[50:21] both the speaking and the hearing of
[50:23] your word and God that you would move
[50:26] Lord by your Spirit upon the needs of
[50:28] your
[50:29] children we know surely Lord that every
[50:33] heart that said I have a need every
[50:36] everyone that thought in their mind I've
[50:39] got this need Lord that you saw that you
[50:43] know that and God we're asking God that
[50:46] you would move for that one Lord father
[50:49] let Faith arise in our hearts to believe
[50:52] upon you Lord for that need and Lord
[50:56] Jesus that your blessings would be upon
[50:57] the remaining portion of this service we
[51:00] ask in Jesus Christ's precious name amen
[51:04] God bless you if you have your
[51:06] Bibles want to turn to
[51:10] Romans chapter
[51:12] 8 we're going to read the first two
[51:15] verses there of scripture and then we'll
[51:18] let you be
[51:20] seated and you know so often you've
[51:23] you've been in church enough to hear
[51:25] this over and over it's just a simple
[51:27] thought well I I'm I'm just going to say
[51:32] that one more time this is just a simple
[51:34] thought but I do know that God hides
[51:37] himself in
[51:38] Simplicity and he reveals himself in the
[51:41] same so if if you hear that and somebody
[51:44] says that well you know that God hides
[51:46] in those places
[51:48] too Romans 81 says there is therefore
[51:51] now no
[51:52] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[51:55] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[51:58] after the spirit for the law of the
[52:01] spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
[52:04] me free from the law of sin and death
[52:08] amen God bless you you can be
[52:11] seated amen
[52:18] we well it's good to be in the house of
[52:20] the Lord
[52:21] amen David said I was glad when they
[52:24] said unto me let us go into the house of
[52:26] the Lord Lord and I believe every
[52:27] Christian feels the same way you know
[52:30] the prophet tells us that you don't have
[52:32] to tell them people to go to church he
[52:34] said they'll go through rain they'll go
[52:35] through snow they'll go through all
[52:37] kinds of things to be there because they
[52:40] they love church amen it's a it's a part
[52:42] of a Christian's life amen that we we
[52:45] need God and we I'm not ashamed to say I
[52:47] need more of him amen I'm not ashamed to
[52:50] stand before you and say I have not yet
[52:52] arrived yet amen we're we're we're we're
[52:55] not on the other side yet so we all
[52:57] we're all still we're in this battle
[52:59] amen and every day you know you get out
[53:02] there among the world and you work and
[53:04] you you you go through your trials and
[53:06] things and you face the devil every day
[53:09] and you know you can get you can get
[53:11] blessed in the Lord you can get those
[53:13] Victory moments and times and and that
[53:16] you know the presence of God so strong
[53:18] and no sooner than you get out the door
[53:20] and you drive down the road and
[53:22] something happens and it this world has
[53:24] a way of just pulling it out of you amen
[53:27] it has a way of just seemingly just
[53:29] pulling it it's the age we live in the
[53:31] age we live in is the the most evil Age
[53:34] The Prophet tells us it's it's worse
[53:36] than any age that there ever was and
[53:38] it's it's the most deceptive age it's
[53:40] the darkest age amen but God always
[53:43] makes a provision for whatever we go
[53:45] through his people have never been
[53:46] without a provision so no matter what
[53:48] the devil would have God's got a
[53:51] provision for his people to meet the
[53:53] challenge of the day thank God for that
[53:55] amen he provided provides whatever our
[53:57] need is amen he provided for his
[53:59] children on their Journey whatever the
[54:01] need come amen God was the provider of
[54:04] that need he's still the same he didn't
[54:07] change whatever your need is God's made
[54:10] a provision for it whatever your
[54:12] struggle is God's made a provision for
[54:14] you amen you're not without amen but
[54:17] what we need is to appropriate the faith
[54:19] Amen to take a hold of the promise of
[54:22] God that we need in our day and our our
[54:24] hour what we're facing amen God's made a
[54:27] way for you but you need Faith to
[54:29] appropriate that to your life to reach
[54:31] out and say that's mine I'll take it
[54:33] amen praise the Lord and I believe we
[54:37] have uh received a message Amen to bring
[54:40] us back to the place where all the
[54:43] promises of God are yes and amen they're
[54:46] alive amen they're not
[54:48] dead amen praise the Lord amen so
[54:52] thankful we have amen the message of the
[54:55] hour because without that we would be a
[54:59] part of the chaos amen we'd be a part of
[55:01] Babylon and everything confusion and
[55:03] everything else but we sit here today by
[55:06] God's provision for us and we're not in
[55:09] confusion we're not a part of Babylon
[55:12] we're not a part of Leo DEA that's
[55:14] that's something apart from us amen but
[55:17] we've been called out of that amen unto
[55:19] a resurrection unto a living God Amen
[55:22] and to a provision amen that will keep
[55:25] us and bring us through amen and we will
[55:28] have Victory amen we will have Victory I
[55:31] may not be on the mountain right now I
[55:33] may be going through the valley but I
[55:35] promise you as I walk with God I will
[55:37] see the
[55:38] Mountaintop I'm going to see a
[55:40] Mountaintop Victory man as long as you
[55:43] keep your eyes on the Lord and you keep
[55:45] walking towards your promise you're
[55:47] going to see the victory amen it's a
[55:50] promise so I want to speak a little bit
[55:52] to you tonight the Lord with his help on
[55:57] a higher law and just to uh background
[56:00] this for a few short moments here and
[56:03] I've got way too many notes so by God's
[56:06] grace we're we're we're going to cut it
[56:08] short somewhere amen we won't keep you
[56:11] past two or three hours anyhow praise
[56:14] the lord well brother Bram say that all
[56:17] the time you listen T I trust you listen
[56:19] to your to the tapes every chance you
[56:21] get or the the the message amen but he
[56:23] say that so often well we ought to be
[56:25] out by mid night anyway and so amen
[56:29] that's a that's a good ice breaker amen
[56:32] praise the Lord so we we look at the
[56:34] laws of of Nature and and and the laws
[56:38] that we live by and the laws that God
[56:41] God created all that we have as far as
[56:45] as as the the creation itself we know
[56:48] it's a Satan's perverted so much of it
[56:51] and and so much of has been tampered
[56:53] with but but we look at the the the law
[56:56] La that we look at and and know that
[56:58] they laws like the law of gravity or the
[57:00] law of thermodynamics or the law of
[57:03] electricity and different discoveries
[57:05] and and how that you know man has
[57:08] studied these laws man has applied
[57:10] himself to learn these laws and to
[57:12] understand these laws and and applied
[57:14] himself to to take these laws and to use
[57:17] these laws to his advantage and these
[57:20] laws amen have you know for years the
[57:23] law of gravity had the had the uh had
[57:28] man under that law where he had no
[57:31] ability to do anything about gravity
[57:34] gravity had its hold on man and man
[57:38] could never overcome gravity but through
[57:41] the study of of these laws of nature
[57:44] that God made man began to understand
[57:47] there was other laws that he could apply
[57:51] uh with that law and this law and
[57:54] together using those laws would overcome
[57:57] the law of gravity he could take amen
[57:59] and discover how a wing uh air foil and
[58:02] and and discover uh aerodynamics and and
[58:06] discover how to cause with uh different
[58:08] fuels how to thermodynamics and
[58:11] combustion and things and develop an
[58:13] engine and cause propulsion to to drive
[58:16] that that that Wing through the air and
[58:18] then and then cause that that vehicle to
[58:21] to lift off you know what if the R
[58:24] Brothers had had had listen to everybody
[58:27] that said well that's gravity and we we
[58:29] man was not made to fly man can't go
[58:33] above the ground he's not made for it
[58:35] and if they'd have listened to that law
[58:37] and not pursued a higher law they'd have
[58:40] stayed on the ground they never tried to
[58:43] to find a way to go higher amen but
[58:46] there's something in a man that's
[58:49] different than all other creation amen
[58:52] because man was made in the image of God
[58:55] man is always looking for something
[58:57] better he's always trying to change his
[59:00] surroundings and change uh uh his
[59:03] environment and and make something
[59:05] better and and we're living in the age
[59:07] where it's it's it's very evident amen
[59:09] man has been able to successfully do so
[59:12] many things and so many you know even
[59:15] the medical uh world and how they can
[59:18] how they can do surgeries now that are
[59:20] totally uh without by Robotics and and
[59:23] on a video camera and and go through
[59:25] somebody told told me recently about
[59:27] some surgery they went through and it
[59:28] was totally uh didn't even open them up
[59:31] they just used a deal and went through
[59:33] the body and and was sewing things
[59:35] together and and fixing things and I
[59:36] thought man that's that's wonderful
[59:39] that's marvelous but that's Man by the
[59:41] tree of knowledge that's what man's been
[59:44] able to do by the tree of knowledge and
[59:46] and some of those things are are
[59:47] wonderful but we know the tree of
[59:49] knowledge can only go so high and we
[59:52] know that it comes to its end and
[59:54] brother R said when you come to your end
[59:56] on that just get on the tree of life and
[59:59] you keep going higher and higher and
[1:00:01] higher amen science can't go where you
[1:00:05] can go amen science can't see what you
[1:00:08] can see science doesn't understand what
[1:00:10] you see here today under the privilege
[1:00:12] of the opening of the word amen science
[1:00:15] don't understand what you understand you
[1:00:18] know the Unseen realm was the Unseen
[1:00:20] realm until a prophet came then that
[1:00:23] unseen realm became a seen realm that's
[1:00:25] right then that that that veil was taken
[1:00:28] off and those Devils amen that you are
[1:00:31] fighting and I fight we uncovered and
[1:00:35] made known and revealed amen that that's
[1:00:38] a devil that's troubling you that's
[1:00:40] because of something you did and
[1:00:41] something you didn't take care of and
[1:00:43] some sin in your life that you allowed
[1:00:45] that's why the devil's there and as long
[1:00:47] as that's there he has a right to remain
[1:00:50] he uncovered the work of the devil
[1:00:52] through a prophet to you and I that we
[1:00:54] can know EX exactly where we're standing
[1:00:57] and where the devil is and who he is and
[1:01:01] Satan don't like to be uncovered he
[1:01:03] don't like to be exposed but in this age
[1:01:06] he's been exposed and we know amen who
[1:01:09] he is and what he's doing and he's out
[1:01:12] Amen to do one thing and that's exactly
[1:01:15] what he did to Eve to cause her to
[1:01:20] disbelieve the
[1:01:22] word amen cause her to let go of the
[1:01:26] word and take something different from
[1:01:29] the word brother B tells us that's where
[1:01:32] we're at in this age amen this is kind
[1:01:34] of off to the side of everything but he
[1:01:36] tells us that's where we're at and the
[1:01:38] God of this evil age he said this age is
[1:01:40] to prove to Satan that this bride is not
[1:01:43] what Eve was she's not that type of
[1:01:46] woman she's not going to mix the word of
[1:01:49] God with anything praise the Lord that's
[1:01:53] what you're here for bride I'm speaking
[1:01:55] to the elect amen you sit here tonight
[1:01:58] and I'm a part of the Bride this is this
[1:02:00] is who we are amen we're here to prove
[1:02:03] to the devil we're not that kind of
[1:02:05] believer we're not going to mix it with
[1:02:08] anything amen but we're going to take it
[1:02:11] right with what the word amen that's
[1:02:13] been given to us and we won't vary from
[1:02:15] it praise the Lord amen a bride that's
[1:02:20] virtu is to Christ Christ is the word
[1:02:23] and she's done been United to Christ
[1:02:25] amen that's where we are today we've
[1:02:27] been United with Christ the word amen
[1:02:30] praise the Lord and it's bringing on a
[1:02:34] Rapture amen so this these laws of
[1:02:38] nature and and and as we said the laws
[1:02:41] different laws that Isaac Newton and
[1:02:43] different ones discovered and and built
[1:02:46] upon and and and and was passed on down
[1:02:49] Through the Ages and these laws have
[1:02:50] been transformed or utilized to to
[1:02:53] overcome other laws and and to realize
[1:02:56] amen that through these things there's
[1:02:58] been uh you know water has been
[1:03:00] harnessed to produce electricity and and
[1:03:03] fire and and things to make Steam and
[1:03:06] control you know to move a train down
[1:03:08] the tracks and all these things and we
[1:03:09] know these things have progressed to the
[1:03:11] end of this age amen it's it's all come
[1:03:14] down as the countdown in different
[1:03:16] places brother bam tells us you know man
[1:03:18] traveled by horse and buggy for
[1:03:20] Millennia until these last days amen he
[1:03:22] went from horse and buggy to an
[1:03:24] astronaut and these things are all
[1:03:26] telling us where we're at and we know
[1:03:27] that we're at the end time but this this
[1:03:30] gravity and and laws and things that
[1:03:33] that have held for centuries have been
[1:03:36] overcome amen and we know that the
[1:03:38] natural always types the spiritual amen
[1:03:41] we know that these things are not done
[1:03:44] in in in such a way that they have no
[1:03:46] meaning amen but if you look closely you
[1:03:49] can recognize the church amen needs to
[1:03:52] be
[1:03:53] progressing they're progressing we ought
[1:03:55] to be progressing they're they're
[1:03:58] they're they're manipulating things to
[1:04:00] their advantage and and gaining the
[1:04:02] knowledge well how much more ought we to
[1:04:04] be adding to our faith virtue and virtue
[1:04:07] knowledge and knowledge Temperance
[1:04:09] coming on up into the fullness and the
[1:04:11] measure and the stature of Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] amen so we we have no place to settle
[1:04:18] down and
[1:04:20] relax amen it's human nature we want you
[1:04:23] know people work all their life to
[1:04:25] retire so they can do nothing amen but I
[1:04:29] don't know that God ever intended it to
[1:04:31] be like that amen I don't know that that
[1:04:33] was really the original uh uh plan of of
[1:04:36] God that man would just sit around and
[1:04:38] do nothing amen because there's no time
[1:04:40] for that amen we're we're in an army
[1:04:43] that's right and in this Army am me
[1:04:44] there's no retirement you don't get old
[1:04:47] and just sit and do nothing about it
[1:04:50] amen but every day amen you're to you're
[1:04:52] to be a reflection of the word of God
[1:04:55] you received amen you're to be a you're
[1:04:57] to be a lighthouse amen you're to be an
[1:05:00] example amen you're to be amen what
[1:05:02] others can look to and say there is a
[1:05:04] true brother in in in the Lord there's a
[1:05:07] real Overcomer right there praise the
[1:05:10] Lord so these laws that once held man
[1:05:14] and limited him are now being overcome
[1:05:18] in the restoration of the Bride tree
[1:05:19] brother Ram says you know a fish has a
[1:05:21] law and that fish can stand up here in
[1:05:24] the water and he has a law within him
[1:05:25] and if he'll just let go of that law
[1:05:27] that's in him he can sink Plumb to the
[1:05:30] Bottom of the Sea and it won't bother
[1:05:31] him a bit won't break one cell you tried
[1:05:34] to do it he said the law is not in you
[1:05:36] you can't do it but the fish can he
[1:05:38] deflates himself of that air such a way
[1:05:40] that he can and there's nothing in him
[1:05:42] to burst open he's made that way he
[1:05:44] knows it he can enforce that law to take
[1:05:48] Taking Plum to the Bottom of the Sea and
[1:05:50] then rais him back up again and a bird
[1:05:53] has a law now it's body it's material
[1:05:55] material Earthbound sits on the earth
[1:05:57] here but in it it it has a law within it
[1:06:01] and that's the way it spreads its wings
[1:06:03] it can fly Plum out of sight and that's
[1:06:05] against science they claim it's
[1:06:07] Earthbound gravitation has to hold it
[1:06:09] here but it can defy gravitation and
[1:06:12] lift itself right off of it and go right
[1:06:14] on out because it has to put that law
[1:06:17] that's in it to work and it's built to
[1:06:20] possess that law now I'm beginning to
[1:06:23] feel religious he says now we have a law
[1:06:27] and that law of life is in us and we
[1:06:29] don't the only thing you have to do
[1:06:32] you're made and born and placed here in
[1:06:34] the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters
[1:06:36] of God and you don't have to knck down
[1:06:38] to the
[1:06:40] devil so why do we ever knck down to the
[1:06:43] devil that's a good question amen
[1:06:46] because we don't have to do it in other
[1:06:48] words we got a choice in this we got a
[1:06:51] choice to let the devil run over us and
[1:06:53] step on us are we have a choice to say
[1:06:57] no sir I'm not going to sit back and be
[1:07:00] your floor
[1:07:01] man amen we've got a law and that's the
[1:07:04] law of the Holy Spirit and the only
[1:07:07] thing you know you have to do is know
[1:07:09] how to let go and let God you keep
[1:07:13] fighting at it it won't never work when
[1:07:16] you let go and let God that's all he
[1:07:19] said if that fish said wait I'll I'll
[1:07:21] catch my breath real good I'll bring up
[1:07:23] a little oxygen and me and I'll see if I
[1:07:25] can go go down no he doesn't uh he
[1:07:28] doesn't do that he would burst open see
[1:07:30] the bird say I'll see how fast I can run
[1:07:33] down here and and maybe I'll take off no
[1:07:35] he won't do it he'll fall down see he's
[1:07:38] got to know how to control and how that
[1:07:41] law can control
[1:07:43] him that law controlling him and the
[1:07:47] same way it is with us if it isn't what
[1:07:50] we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I
[1:07:53] don't get this and I don't get that
[1:07:56] that's not it it's to know the law of
[1:07:59] life is in you to know it's in you it's
[1:08:03] in me amen and you just let go and let
[1:08:07] God then he takes control he takes you
[1:08:10] to your healing he takes you to the
[1:08:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and anything
[1:08:15] that he's promised any claim that he's
[1:08:17] given is yours by letting go and letting
[1:08:20] God ain't that good amen that's good
[1:08:22] that you just let go because there's
[1:08:24] something in inside of you a law amen
[1:08:27] that you possess and it possesses you
[1:08:31] amen it's not just you possess it but
[1:08:33] it's got a hold of you amen that's
[1:08:36] different amen when it gets a hold of
[1:08:38] you that's different amen well I got a
[1:08:40] hold of God but one day he got a hold of
[1:08:42] me and when he got a hold of me
[1:08:44] everything changed amen so many people
[1:08:47] say well I I I I got a hold of God no
[1:08:49] you need to let God get a hold of you
[1:08:52] amen he gets a hold of you and it'll
[1:08:54] change your life it it'll change your
[1:08:56] thinking it'll change your actions it'll
[1:08:58] change your love amen it'll change
[1:09:00] everything about
[1:09:01] you
[1:09:03] amen he says now if the officer is going
[1:09:06] to take a fellow that stole your
[1:09:08] property and he was going to take him to
[1:09:10] court and you keep pulling him back and
[1:09:12] say well I just I don't know whether you
[1:09:14] should do this or or not he'll never get
[1:09:17] him there he'll never get him to the
[1:09:18] court he'll never get him to Justice
[1:09:20] just let him go and he said that's the
[1:09:22] way you do let Satan just get away all
[1:09:25] the doubts and everything flee from your
[1:09:27] mind then God will raise you up amen you
[1:09:31] got to let God do it got to let go and
[1:09:33] let that let God Amen have his way amen
[1:09:37] and he'll take care of it and since the
[1:09:40] fall of Man we know the law of death has
[1:09:43] been the greatest thing that's been held
[1:09:45] over us the law of sin and death and
[1:09:48] that's the thing that amen had man uh
[1:09:51] since the fall amen he he's he's never
[1:09:53] had an answer for it man man could never
[1:09:56] achieve it man could never never rise to
[1:09:58] the occasion to to meet the demands of
[1:10:01] the law of Moses he could never do it
[1:10:03] and we we know these things and and so
[1:10:05] it was a hopeless Affair but you know
[1:10:07] God in his sovereignty he didn't leave
[1:10:10] us without a witness but there was an
[1:10:12] Enoch just seven short Generations down
[1:10:15] the road that showed that there would be
[1:10:18] someday coming somehow that law of death
[1:10:22] would find its its match amen that there
[1:10:25] would be a law called life that would
[1:10:28] overcome that law of death amen and
[1:10:31] death would not have a hold on a people
[1:10:34] amen and Enoch testified of this through
[1:10:37] his life amen there's coming a day and a
[1:10:40] People amen that death is not going to
[1:10:43] stop them you know brother B was asked a
[1:10:46] question concerning you know uh how
[1:10:49] Elijah uh you know come back there in
[1:10:53] Revelation and and died and he said I I
[1:10:55] always the question I don't remember
[1:10:57] exactly but he he referred to that and
[1:10:59] somebody said what about Enoch and he
[1:11:00] said I've always wondered about that and
[1:11:02] and I was thinking you know but we've
[1:11:04] got to have a type we have to have a
[1:11:07] type Enoch was our type Elijah wasn't
[1:11:11] the type for us amen Elijah came back
[1:11:14] and
[1:11:15] died but there's got to be a people
[1:11:18] Enoch never had to come back and die so
[1:11:21] that testifies there's never been a
[1:11:23] people that hasn't died until this day
[1:11:27] amen praise the lord it's a perfect type
[1:11:30] it is a perfect type because he was a
[1:11:32] seventh from Adam and we're the Seventh
[1:11:34] Generation down the seven Church ages
[1:11:37] we're here amen this is the Enoch
[1:11:39] generation amen that's our type someday
[1:11:43] there's going to be a a people praise
[1:11:46] the lord they're just going to get up
[1:11:48] just like every other day their hearts
[1:11:51] going to be to serve the Lord it may not
[1:11:54] be flashing light
[1:11:55] nights people may not even know your
[1:11:58] name praise the Lord you might be a
[1:12:00] housewife you get up just to take care
[1:12:03] of your family and do what you always do
[1:12:05] serving the lord
[1:12:07] Faithfully oh but that'll be your last
[1:12:10] day amen it'll be your last day there
[1:12:14] won't be no more days of suffering and
[1:12:16] heartache and toils and troubles and
[1:12:19] stress and pressures upon you but it'll
[1:12:21] be the last day amen oh what a promise
[1:12:25] so God gave a glimpse that that law was
[1:12:28] going to meet its End
[1:12:30] Amen the law of Walking with God the
[1:12:33] author of life would produce a
[1:12:37] translation praise the Lord Enoch walked
[1:12:41] with God that's a part of it amen it's a
[1:12:43] daily walk amen it was Enoch that walked
[1:12:46] with God it didn't say nothing about
[1:12:47] Enoch's family but Enoch because it's a
[1:12:51] personal thing that you walk with God
[1:12:54] your family may not follow you amen your
[1:12:57] brother may not care about it Mom and
[1:12:59] Daddy may not believe it but you put
[1:13:03] yourself as an Enoch and you walk with
[1:13:06] God you make the choice hey you got a
[1:13:10] choice in this every day you get up I
[1:13:13] can be an Enoch today I can walk with
[1:13:15] God today amen I can overcome today
[1:13:18] greater is he that's in me than he
[1:13:20] that's in this world there's a spirit
[1:13:22] inside of me the spirit of life that's
[1:13:25] consuming me it's got a hold of me and I
[1:13:28] I can't get away from it it's consumed
[1:13:31] my life I can't get away from it can you
[1:13:33] testify to that something's got a hold
[1:13:36] of me and it's changing me day by day
[1:13:39] week by week amen year by year I'm not
[1:13:42] the same as I used to be I can look back
[1:13:45] and say thank God I'm not what I used to
[1:13:48] be I can join with Paul to say the life
[1:13:50] I once lived I don't live that way no
[1:13:53] more I don't think that way no more but
[1:13:55] God Has Changed
[1:13:57] Me
[1:13:59] amen praise the Lord amen Abraham and
[1:14:04] Sarah had their promise amen of bringing
[1:14:06] forth life but the law of death had a
[1:14:09] claim on them now law of death was
[1:14:11] working against them amen every day it
[1:14:14] was telling them that you're dying you
[1:14:17] look in the mirror and you're getting
[1:14:18] older you're getting weaker the promise
[1:14:21] seems further away anybody ever felt
[1:14:24] that way you believe in God for
[1:14:26] something and the promise seems further
[1:14:28] away not
[1:14:29] closer seems to be further away no doubt
[1:14:33] they battled Amen brother B would say it
[1:14:36] like this and we call ourselves the Seed
[1:14:38] of Abraham but we can't believe God for
[1:14:42] a few days or even a week or a month now
[1:14:46] we say great faith is getting the
[1:14:48] immediate results but I'd say that great
[1:14:51] faith is somebody that can hold on when
[1:14:54] everything's against you there's no
[1:14:56] signs to believe there's no there's no
[1:14:58] flashing thing happening there's no
[1:15:01] Pillar of Fire in your life amen and
[1:15:03] showing up amen there's no vision no
[1:15:05] dream no nothing but all you got a word
[1:15:07] to believe but I say blessed is he that
[1:15:11] takes the word of God and believes the
[1:15:13] word of God regardless of everything
[1:15:15] else you're going to see God Amen you're
[1:15:18] going to see God Amen when you consider
[1:15:22] not amen your situation
[1:15:25] the deadness of your own body and the
[1:15:28] deadness of your wife amen and and the
[1:15:30] the inability you know God puts a
[1:15:33] promises outside of the reach of man and
[1:15:36] man can't attain to them man can't make
[1:15:38] them happen man can't you can't force it
[1:15:40] amen but you got to let go and let God
[1:15:42] you got to believe amen God will do
[1:15:45] exactly what he said he'll do praise the
[1:15:49] Lord but there one day amen that law of
[1:15:53] death had to give way to the law of
[1:15:56] faith that was in Abraham and Sarah that
[1:15:59] they believed God regardless amen praise
[1:16:02] the Lord Death was wrapping him up ready
[1:16:06] to put him in the grave death thought he
[1:16:09] had a hold of him but he never had one
[1:16:12] claim on him no sir amen because why God
[1:16:17] has spoken a word concerning
[1:16:19] them amen they had a word concerning
[1:16:22] them that means if if you have a word
[1:16:25] concerning you and you have received a
[1:16:28] word from the Lord and you have had
[1:16:30] Revelation in your heart concerning your
[1:16:33] life and and whatever you're
[1:16:36] facing amen there's a word concerning
[1:16:39] you death ain't got a hold it don't have
[1:16:42] a claim on you amen nothing can hold you
[1:16:45] nothing can stop you amen there's
[1:16:48] nothing the devil can do to stop you and
[1:16:50] I as Believers as long as we hold on to
[1:16:53] the word of God God will keep that word
[1:16:55] to you praise the Lord amen oh my I'm
[1:16:59] not talking just from notes or or or
[1:17:03] Bible or or the message but I can talk
[1:17:05] from a personal amen experience of my
[1:17:08] own amen with God Amen I wouldn't be
[1:17:11] qualified to stand there and preach this
[1:17:13] word if I hadn't seen God do it but God
[1:17:16] will keep his word to you God will
[1:17:18] fulfill a promise to you
[1:17:21] amen for a testimony or two
[1:17:27] for Faith's sake cuz
[1:17:29] testimonies are good for Faith amen I
[1:17:35] I've seen testimonies used for the wrong
[1:17:37] thing and I'm not going to use them for
[1:17:39] the wrong thing I want to use them for
[1:17:41] one thing and that's for faith in your
[1:17:43] heart to God Amen and and I had an
[1:17:48] experience and I hadn't thought about it
[1:17:50] but today it come back to me and I
[1:17:52] thought well perhaps I I should share
[1:17:54] that but I had an experience one time
[1:17:57] that that I can't explain it but God
[1:18:00] Amen just the reality of who God is
[1:18:04] God's mindful of us God sees amen he he
[1:18:08] hears he he he knows all about what
[1:18:11] we're going through or what means
[1:18:13] something to us he's very intimately
[1:18:15] aware and I I had I was brand new in the
[1:18:19] ministry and I had been down to the
[1:18:20] church praying and just had a a
[1:18:23] wonderful time in prayer
[1:18:25] and I come out from that atmosphere and
[1:18:27] you know just as I was saying earlier
[1:18:29] you no longer get out from that
[1:18:31] atmosphere and who's there to to meet
[1:18:33] you and I I know more got out to my
[1:18:35] truck and I was driving down the the
[1:18:37] road there right by the church and the
[1:18:40] burden of something come on me that had
[1:18:42] been weighing on me heavy I was at the
[1:18:44] time uh in construction and we had built
[1:18:47] a couple of Speck houses me and another
[1:18:49] guy were partners and we had these and
[1:18:51] it was 2008 everything had fallen to uh
[1:18:55] horrible there in the fall of 2008 if
[1:18:57] you remember and construction it was a
[1:18:59] horrible deal and and so we had these
[1:19:01] two Speck houses we had one that had
[1:19:03] been on the market for several months
[1:19:04] and it was eaten away and you know we
[1:19:06] was having to pay all this interest and
[1:19:08] everything else and and then we had this
[1:19:10] other one that was finishing up and we
[1:19:12] was taking on these payments and stuff
[1:19:13] and it was getting kind of heavy and so
[1:19:16] there a burden and and and I I man I
[1:19:19] just come out from that atmosphere is
[1:19:20] all I can say the Lord had not it it
[1:19:23] wasn't away from me me and as I was
[1:19:26] driving down that road all I can testify
[1:19:28] to you is when I was driving down that
[1:19:30] weight of that that that those houses
[1:19:33] come on
[1:19:34] me and I thought oh you know I felt it
[1:19:37] come and I I heard myself speak just as
[1:19:41] you would under the anointing preaching
[1:19:43] does something come to me and I just
[1:19:45] spoke and I said I'll sign a contract
[1:19:48] tomorrow and I it caught me by surprise
[1:19:52] and I thought why did I say that I mean
[1:19:56] I Within Myself why did I say that I
[1:19:59] said it out loud nobody in the truck
[1:20:01] just said it out loud in the face of
[1:20:03] that devil that was there to torment me
[1:20:06] and and take the joy out of my life and
[1:20:08] take the victory out of my soul to weigh
[1:20:10] me down with the pressures of this life
[1:20:12] amen where I would had been down there
[1:20:14] to get away from that to get in the the
[1:20:17] presence of God and get the mind of God
[1:20:20] and so I spoke it and I thought well I
[1:20:22] don't know what it means but all I can
[1:20:24] do is just see what happens you know so
[1:20:26] that was a a
[1:20:28] Tuesday and the next morning I wasn't
[1:20:30] even thinking about it and I got up and
[1:20:33] I was driving to to work and the phone
[1:20:36] rang and it was early that morning and I
[1:20:39] had done for God about this woman had
[1:20:41] looked at the house like a week before
[1:20:42] and expressed interest in it and I done
[1:20:45] forgot she said she was going back home
[1:20:46] to Texas I thought she was
[1:20:48] gone I I I'll I'll testify to you the
[1:20:52] very first words out of that woman's
[1:20:54] mouth on the phone was we're leaving
[1:20:56] town today and I want to sign a contract
[1:20:58] on that
[1:21:00] house God's Hest
[1:21:02] truth because God
[1:21:04] cares and God's present and God hears
[1:21:08] and he understands what we're going
[1:21:10] through and I I I I went and and we we
[1:21:14] sat down with her and we made some deals
[1:21:17] on some things and then she kept
[1:21:18] pressing and I said no that's it was a
[1:21:21] fair deal and I told my partner
[1:21:22] afterwards I told him what happened he
[1:21:24] said wow he said well we shouldn't have
[1:21:26] given anything you know and I said no I
[1:21:28] wanted it to be fair but God spoke to me
[1:21:31] I mean he he he he revealed something
[1:21:33] there to me amen that if we would
[1:21:36] surrender oursel to the Lord there's
[1:21:37] just no telling what God would do
[1:21:41] amen another testimony that I I I want
[1:21:44] to speak to encourage your faith is
[1:21:48] holding on when everything's going
[1:21:51] bad and my wife and some of you you have
[1:21:55] probably know this but my wife uh
[1:21:57] suffered she went through uh breast
[1:22:00] cancer back in 2006 and and since then
[1:22:04] you know there's been a lot of things
[1:22:06] she's she's kind of went through and and
[1:22:08] and things I I don't know exactly when
[1:22:11] it started but she started having really
[1:22:13] bad headaches and these episodes would
[1:22:15] go for a week or two and then she'd be
[1:22:17] good for a while and then they'd go for
[1:22:20] a month and she she kept just
[1:22:22] progressively getting worse and we went
[1:22:26] and spent all kinds of money searching
[1:22:29] of course we were praying we were we
[1:22:31] were reaching out to the Lord the whole
[1:22:34] time but we were getting desperate and
[1:22:37] we spent I can't even tell you how much
[1:22:39] money that we spent going and looking
[1:22:41] and this doctor over here has an answer
[1:22:43] and this one has an answer and this one
[1:22:45] thinks he can help you and we went to
[1:22:48] multiple uh natural doctors multiple
[1:22:51] neurologists multiple all kinds of of
[1:22:54] things have a list of doctors we saw
[1:22:56] through the years that it it was brother
[1:22:58] Joe and sister Manny know and just
[1:23:00] constantly and we were looking for
[1:23:02] answers and looking for answers but
[1:23:03] always believ in God never quit
[1:23:06] believing God we know no matter what
[1:23:09] he's our healer and so we never ever
[1:23:14] give up my wife would be in bed for days
[1:23:18] with headache couldn't do anything
[1:23:20] couldn't take care of the family
[1:23:22] couldn't couldn't take care of herself
[1:23:23] couldn't take care of things
[1:23:26] miserable sad fighting depression
[1:23:30] struggling why am I here have I done
[1:23:34] something the Lord's not moving for me
[1:23:37] he's not answering my prayer what's
[1:23:40] wrong anybody ever been there Lord why
[1:23:45] why are you not hearing me why why is
[1:23:47] the answer not come we were there and
[1:23:50] I'm telling you it was a battle it's
[1:23:52] hard to convey just what how the devil
[1:23:55] would fight you and then I'd get up
[1:23:58] behind our pulpit and preach Christ is
[1:24:01] our
[1:24:02] healer by the grace of God never ever
[1:24:07] turn from that because God's word's true
[1:24:09] brother Braham said if I prayed for a
[1:24:11] thousand people and every one of them
[1:24:12] died I'd bring the next one up and pray
[1:24:14] because it's God's word God's word is
[1:24:17] true no matter what we see no matter
[1:24:20] what we experience we believe God Amen
[1:24:23] no matter what comes and what goes God's
[1:24:26] word is truth amen and so we we fought
[1:24:30] we struggled we we look for answers we
[1:24:33] we reached out we spent like I said
[1:24:35] traveled all over and looking for these
[1:24:37] things trying to get a mail everything
[1:24:39] that everybody had to tell us trying to
[1:24:41] help us you know been through all kinds
[1:24:44] of of

[1:24:56] special she's she's a spiritual girl I
[1:24:59] just say she's dedicated and she prays
[1:25:02] and a lot and she's she's always she's
[1:25:05] been that way ever since her conversion
[1:25:08] and she got up that morning and she
[1:25:10] prayed and she said Lord she said would
[1:25:13] you just do something for Mom today in a
[1:25:17] supernatural way that she'll know that
[1:25:20] it was you and so and she prayed another
[1:25:23] prayer concerning her cousin that's
[1:25:27] backslid both those prayers were
[1:25:29] answered that
[1:25:31] day my wife was on a Saturday she was in
[1:25:36] bed struggling I was I was preparing for
[1:25:38] service Sunday and I was in my office
[1:25:41] and I I got to thinking well I go check
[1:25:44] on her and see how she's doing if I can
[1:25:45] get something for her I I went in there
[1:25:48] this is April 1st last year and I went
[1:25:51] in there and I I come in the room and
[1:25:55] something was different and she was
[1:25:57] crying and I said honey what's wrong and
[1:25:59] she said right now she said God's
[1:26:01] speaking to me I said okay and I I said
[1:26:05] thank the Lord and I I walked out and I
[1:26:06] just rejoicing the Lord was speaking to
[1:26:09] her and had no idea what was going on
[1:26:12] but she she had joined a uh streaming of
[1:26:16] service brother Jeremy Shriner and
[1:26:18] Amarillo uh Saturday evening service and
[1:26:21] she was watching that service and she
[1:26:24] watched it for a little bit and then she
[1:26:25] thought well I'm just going to turn the
[1:26:27] I'm going to turn the the deal and I'm
[1:26:29] going to uh you know just she was
[1:26:32] starting to thing I just turn it off and
[1:26:34] something spoke to her and said no maybe
[1:26:36] God's got something for you and so she
[1:26:38] said well I'll watch a little bit longer
[1:26:41] and brother Jeremy at the end of service
[1:26:43] he's leading s or singing there
[1:26:45] concluding service and he uh comes to a
[1:26:49] point and he stops and he says I'm just
[1:26:52] going to say it he said I don't know
[1:26:54] know why I I'm doing this I I have no
[1:26:57] idea but he said I can't get away from
[1:26:59] it that God put somebody on my heart
[1:27:02] this this person don't even go to our
[1:27:04] church I don't even have any idea if
[1:27:06] she's even watching our service I have
[1:27:08] no idea but sister Stephanie Collins has
[1:27:11] been heavy on my heart up here for the
[1:27:13] last 15 minutes and I've been fighting
[1:27:15] it but I'm going to say it and he said I
[1:27:18] believe that God has something for her
[1:27:21] and he said I want us to join together
[1:27:22] as a church and pray for her right now
[1:27:25] that God would heal her and and deliver
[1:27:27] her and the church began to to pray and
[1:27:31] and and my wife said the presence of the
[1:27:33] Lord come through that that room there
[1:27:36] just moved across that room across her
[1:27:39] and she felt it it just lifting off of
[1:27:42] her and she was in that in that
[1:27:44] atmosphere when I come in there she was
[1:27:46] rejoicing thinking God for her healing
[1:27:49] and I can testify to you that she amen
[1:27:53] the head stop that
[1:27:56] moment that

[1:28:04] by after all the prayers after all the
[1:28:07] tears after all the holding on after all
[1:28:10] the the perseverance amen but I told her
[1:28:13] I said we don't know why we're going
[1:28:15] through this in the midst of our trial I
[1:28:17] said but God's got to have a witness
[1:28:20] God's going to have a witness of
[1:28:22] somebody that can persevere somebody
[1:28:25] that can go without an answer somebody
[1:28:27] that can believe God when there's
[1:28:29] nothing to look to somebody is going to
[1:28:32] be a witness that God Amen will meet

[1:28:54] in the midst of her struggles one time
[1:28:57] and she was very low I went up to her
[1:29:01] and she was there in bed and
[1:29:03] weeping and I I had to do it because I
[1:29:06] knew there was going to be a testimony
[1:29:08] and this is part of the
[1:29:10] testimony I said honey in all of your
[1:29:14] struggles in all of these hardships and
[1:29:17] times and times alone for hours I said
[1:29:20] have you ever felt like just giving up

[1:29:46] hesitated she said this God's all I've
[1:29:49] got I don't have anything else he's my
[1:29:52] he's my hope he's my everything thing

[1:29:58] don't quit I believe God and we had us a
[1:30:01] time right there and we rejoiced in the
[1:30:04] midst of the trial and we said we're
[1:30:06] we're not backing down we're not
[1:30:08] quitting we're believing God and I tell
[1:30:11] you God is
[1:30:13] faithful God knows where you're at and
[1:30:16] he knows what you're going through amen
[1:30:18] and you've got a spirit of life in you
[1:30:21] you got a law inside of you that's
[1:30:23] greater than anything you're going
[1:30:25] through and any struggle you're in amen
[1:30:28] you say my roads been hard and we've had
[1:30:30] some hard roads amen we're not here to
[1:30:32] compare hard roads with hard roads but I
[1:30:34] want to tell you there's a God that can
[1:30:37] keep you on your Hard Road and meet you
[1:30:40] and he'll bring you out to
[1:30:43] Victory
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:46] amen amen there's a law that is higher
[1:30:51] than the thing amen that you're up
[1:30:53] against it's a higher law these laws are
[1:30:57] subject to God and His law Which is
[1:31:00] higher that law of faith is is a higher
[1:31:04] law he says here and who is this MDC he
[1:31:08] said and then when you become subject to
[1:31:10] that Spirit it throws your whole being
[1:31:12] subject to that spirit and that spirit
[1:31:14] is nothing in the world but this seed
[1:31:16] word made manifest and Quicken
[1:31:18] Hallelujah made alive when the Bible
[1:31:20] said don't do this that body quickly
[1:31:22] turns to it there's no question and what
[1:31:24] is it it's the earnest of the
[1:31:25] Resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:31:28] again because it's already started
[1:31:30] praise the lord it's already started it
[1:31:32] was once subject to sin and mire and

[1:32:02] don't eat up eat up with cancer
[1:32:04] tuberculosis see them persons a little
[1:32:06] while after that perfectly normal and
[1:32:08] strong if there's no Divine Healing
[1:32:10] there's no Resurrection because Divine
[1:32:12] Healing is the earnest of the
[1:32:13] resurrection and you know what that
[1:32:16] earnest money is don't you it's a down
[1:32:17] payment he was wounded for our
[1:32:19] transgressions with his stripes we were
[1:32:22] healed notice how wonderful we love him
[1:32:25] he says now this body is subject to the
[1:32:27] spirit and have not entered into the
[1:32:29] word form yet but we're still in the
[1:32:31] flesh form but subject to the word Death
[1:32:34] In the Flesh will take us there to that
[1:32:37] word body amen he says and the power
[1:32:40] that'll raise us up is right in us now I
[1:32:44] love this that power that'll raise us up
[1:32:48] is in us right
[1:32:51] now we are now in heavenly places right
[1:32:55] now the believer that is our position
[1:32:59] brother BR would tell us that is your
[1:33:01] position Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:33:06] amen you reading Ephesians and it says
[1:33:08] that Christ was exalted and and seated
[1:33:11] in Heavenly places then another place it
[1:33:14] says that we have been lifted up into
[1:33:16] those heavenly places on down Ephesians
[1:33:18] 2 or 3 and then at the end of the uh
[1:33:21] Ephesians there it tells us that we are
[1:33:23] we are being we we're wrestling against
[1:33:26] powers and principalities Amen in high
[1:33:29] places but if you look at that word it's
[1:33:31] Heavenly places it's the devil that's
[1:33:34] trying to keep you from your position in
[1:33:37] Christ which is Heavenly places amen and
[1:33:41] we allow him to pull us out of those
[1:33:42] heavenly places to live down here on
[1:33:45] Earth and walk around like we're a bunch
[1:33:47] of carnal people amen and and identify
[1:33:50] with carnality amen and live our life in
[1:33:53] this world this is not where our life is
[1:33:55] our life amen is up there in Christ amen
[1:34:00] that's where we
[1:34:02] belong amen don't get identified down
[1:34:06] here don't get your identity wrapped up
[1:34:08] down here you're more than a carpenter
[1:34:11] you're more than a painter you're more
[1:34:12] than a plumber you're more than what
[1:34:14] that's not who you are amen you're a son
[1:34:17] and daughter of God Amen made in the
[1:34:20] very image of Christ amen praise the
[1:34:24] Lord he says if there wasn't a law to
[1:34:26] that he said we're now in the power of
[1:34:28] the Resurrection if there wasn't a law
[1:34:30] to that Sons and Daughters of God would
[1:34:31] create them a world out here and go live
[1:34:34] a private life on it you have the power
[1:34:37] in you to do it our minds blow because
[1:34:41] we can't quite
[1:34:43] comprehend if you've got a shadow of the
[1:34:46] power of God in you you've got the power
[1:34:48] to do it God is omnipotent see what I
[1:34:50] mean the power that's in you will make
[1:34:52] you could speak world into existence go
[1:34:55] live on it Hallelujah he says there you
[1:34:57] are that's what power is in the church
[1:35:01] now but it's controlled by a law and
[1:35:04] that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:35:06] Commandments it's a law of Faith Jesus
[1:35:09] said all things are possible to them
[1:35:11] that believe if you can believe it
[1:35:14] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:35:16] believe that is yours every place The
[1:35:21] Souls of your foot can set upon in faith
[1:35:24] amen God gives it to you amen amen amen
[1:35:29] it's yours you possess it if you can
[1:35:32] find the key to this law of faith that
[1:35:35] opens it to you you see what I mean the
[1:35:37] power is controlled if you're a a Son of
[1:35:40] God or a daughter of God that never
[1:35:42] leaves you it's with you all the time
[1:35:47] but your faith gets away from it but
[1:35:49] it's still there
[1:35:51] Hallelujah another place he said says
[1:35:54] now healing is in the reach of every
[1:35:57] person remember healing is in you ain't
[1:36:01] that beautiful it's in you that power is
[1:36:05] in you God placed in the peach tree

[1:36:25] baptism he says remember they was
[1:36:29] only I think that's that's a different
[1:36:32] quote sorry about that remember they was
[1:36:34] only two days journey away from Kadesh
[1:36:37] barnea and he held them back just for 40
[1:36:40] years because of their unbelief your
[1:36:42] healing might not be five minutes away
[1:36:47] but your unbelief will keep it away from
[1:36:49] you as long as you live You've Got to
[1:36:53] Believe it amen praise the Lord amen how
[1:36:58] many laws do you suppose was broken by
[1:37:02] Moses when he went down to Egypt how
[1:37:03] many laws am me God's Supernatural so

[1:37:15] to him that's right he supersedes those
[1:37:18] laws he he breaks those laws left and
[1:37:21] right amen and you remember the
[1:37:23] testimony brother B praying for that
[1:37:25] that girl there in the in the hospital

[1:37:43] nurse sitting there saying sir how can
[1:37:46] you say that it's never been in history
[1:37:49] recorded that these numbers that anybody
[1:37:52] ever come out of this
[1:37:53] and he said bless your heart darling
[1:37:56] you're looking according to natural
[1:37:59] medicine and Science and the books he
[1:38:01] said but I'm looking according to
[1:38:04] God Amen that makes all the difference
[1:38:07] amen I'm looking above that to God that
[1:38:11] supersedes that amen he's greater than
[1:38:14] that he's greater than your trouble he's
[1:38:16] greater than your problem he's greater
[1:38:18] than your doctor he's greater than your
[1:38:20] lawyer he's greater than all the things
[1:38:23] that's against you amen we're looking
[1:38:27] higher than that amen how many laws were
[1:38:32] broken when Joshua spoke to the son son
[1:38:35] stand still and it obeyed the voice of a
[1:38:39] man how many laws were broken amen when
[1:38:42] Moses held the staff over the Red Sea
[1:38:44] how many laws did God break throughout
[1:38:46] all history Amen to prove himself to us
[1:38:49] how many laws were broken amen by God
[1:38:52] through a prop Propet in this end time
[1:38:54] to vindicate a word to us Amen to show
[1:38:57] us amen that God is so much greater than
[1:39:02] anything amen and yet we sit here
[1:39:05] sometimes overcome with you know
[1:39:08] questions and and unbelief amen and and
[1:39:11] the prophet tells us plainly he said the
[1:39:12] worst thing a Christian can do is
[1:39:15] disbelieve
[1:39:17] God it's the worst thing we can do
[1:39:22] amen the La of faith has got to be
[1:39:26] released within us it's got to be we we
[1:39:30] we got it within us but we got to
[1:39:32] release it we got to take our hands off
[1:39:34] of our situations we got to commit them
[1:39:37] to God and trust the Lord and believe
[1:39:40] God Amen we got to it's hard to do
[1:39:43] sometimes we want to fix it we want to
[1:39:46] do it we want to we want to do something
[1:39:48] about it and it's in our nature amen
[1:39:50] we're not want to sit back and just let
[1:39:51] somebody else fix our problem we're
[1:39:52] going to take care care of it it's our
[1:39:54] nature and there's nothing wrong with
[1:39:56] that nature until it comes to not
[1:39:58] letting God take what we can't do you
[1:40:02] know a perfect example of that and kind
[1:40:04] of here and there but brother brandom
[1:40:07] talking about Rebecca when she got all
[1:40:09] all you know rebellious and acting up
[1:40:12] and she was a what he called a teeny
[1:40:14] Annie and she was acting up and and and
[1:40:16] sister M was all tore up about her and
[1:40:18] saying you got to do something we got to
[1:40:20] do something about this she's rebelling
[1:40:21] she slammed the door she's she's all
[1:40:24] kinds of you know you got to do
[1:40:26] something and brother Bram said
[1:40:29] darling we got to commit her to the Lord
[1:40:32] we got to take this before God and take
[1:40:34] our hands off is't that backwards I mean
[1:40:36] what we we think man we we got to do
[1:40:38] something about
[1:40:40] this and the prophet said you know
[1:40:43] what we've got to take this before the
[1:40:45] Lord he said sometimes we put our hands
[1:40:48] at things and we only make it
[1:40:49] worse but if we could only commit it to
[1:40:52] the Lord right and trust God he can do
[1:40:55] what we can't do and he said you know we
[1:40:58] did that and we just in
[1:41:00] a really short time Rebecca came back to
[1:41:04] her senses she got right with God and
[1:41:06] everything was fine quite an example in
[1:41:09] it amen praise the Lord for the law of
[1:41:14] the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has
[1:41:16] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:41:19] death for what the law Moses law could
[1:41:21] not do in the it was weak through the
[1:41:24] flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:41:27] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:41:29] condemn sin in the flesh the law over
[1:41:32] mankind amen the soul that sinth it
[1:41:34] shall die yet God made a provision a
[1:41:36] higher law the law of a kinsman redeemer
[1:41:39] proved to be greater than law of sin and
[1:41:41] death right it supersedes it God's

[2:03:08] Monday we're going to have a picnic here
[2:03:10] at the church uh everybody's welcome to
[2:03:12] attend you can invite who you want to I
[2:03:14] don't know what we're cooking how we're
[2:03:15] cooking it what we're eating I don't
[2:03:16] know none of the above but we're having
[2:03:18] a picnic and it's going to be a good
[2:03:19] time it's going to start about 11:00 I
[2:03:21] made that up we're going to be out here
[2:03:23] about 11:00 and then I don't know when
[2:03:25] the food will be served but if you're
[2:03:26] here at 11: you're bound to be able to
[2:03:27] catch it so somewhere after 11: we'll
[2:03:30] have food and we're just going to have a
[2:03:31] good time of fellowship and we just want
[2:03:33] to come and and give everybody some
[2:03:35] folks have a place to go God bless you
[2:03:37] pray the Lord will be with you wherever
[2:03:39] you go but those that are here we just
[2:03:41] want to have a good time with everybody
[2:03:42] amen we used to do that every year and
[2:03:45] and then uh but circumstances happen and
[2:03:48] so but we just uh just look forward to
[2:03:50] that and also just be praying our
[2:03:52] trustee board we've been speaking with
[2:03:54] our trustees about making room in the
[2:03:56] church and I know on Sundays it's been
[2:03:59] kind of uh tight in the pews and in the
[2:04:02] parking lot especially and and I know
[2:04:04] brother Mark don't mind us parking in
[2:04:05] his yard but after a while that gets old
[2:04:07] I'm sure and um but we if we don't do
[2:04:10] something we're going to be in his yard
[2:04:11] so I thought maybe we'll just take part
[2:04:12] of brother Mark's yard and make a park
[2:04:14] and I'm just
[2:04:15] kiding but we want we're going to have
[2:04:17] to have some more parking lot and and
[2:04:20] we're discussing on taking the sides of
[2:04:22] the building the the the two Wings here
[2:04:26] that are on the side of the sanctuary
[2:04:27] and and in in phases removing those and
[2:04:30] open up the sanctuary and we could add
[2:04:32] about 100 more seats in the sanctuary so
[2:04:35] um now this isn't the trust disease this
[2:04:37] is just brother Matt but I may as well
[2:04:38] just tell it all well I'd like to see
[2:04:41] I'd like to see after that's all done is
[2:04:42] then then one day we'll be able to move
[2:04:44] this platform back a little bit and
[2:04:46] maybe CU When we take the offices out
[2:04:48] we'll have to have somewhere to go with
[2:04:49] them and maybe put a baptism and and and
[2:04:52] things in the back and so we'll have to
[2:04:54] build on to the back of the building to
[2:04:55] do that but uh the cheapest way to
[2:04:57] expand is to go with what we already
[2:04:59] have in square footed so y'all just be
[2:05:00] praying about that and I know these
[2:05:02] brothers we've worked hard and we're not
[2:05:04] we're not starting new construction

[2:05:09] those seeds and amen I like to I just

[2:05:14] way up brother Bry says we ain't looking
[2:05:16] for a way to bail out or just just cu
[2:05:19] the devil brings by a little bit of
[2:05:20] trouble and trials and all that stuff

[2:05:23] us here for a purpose we're a lighthouse
