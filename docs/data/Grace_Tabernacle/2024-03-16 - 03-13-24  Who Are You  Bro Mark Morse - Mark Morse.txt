this evening we uh we'll do our best to present the word of God Amen that's what we're here for is to hear the word and you know sometimes preachers get up here and they need to hear the word too amen sometimes it comes just fresh and and new up here as it does out there amen that's just the presence of the Lord I appreciate the presence of the Lord tonight and appreciate him being with us won't you just give him a hand clap of praise tonight amen we got amen we've got a couple of different scriptures uh turn to Hebrews 11 we start at verse one amen says the Bible says in Hebrews 11 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which our are seen we're not made of things which do appear and you don't have to term that in Romans 10:1 17 the Bible says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God and in Acts 19 and 15 Bible says and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are ye amen if you just want to Bow your heads this evening Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for all that you have done for us Lord we we thank you for the healing power Lord we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your grace Lord we thank you for your presence here tonight Lord we thank you for all that you have done for us and father we pray that we would move out of the way and just step into that atmosphere of God tonight Lord we're looking to hear from you that's our goal tonight is to hear from the Lord father we just thank you now in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated I know that's a rather odd assortment of scriptures that we have this uh this evening amen but we'll get to it in a little bit amen so the Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the word faith is just simply means complete trust or confidence in someone or something now the word manifestation means an event action or object that clearly shows or embodies something especially a theory or an abstract idea I got to look in you know you think about that God when he was creating the Earth and and the world that when his word went out it was the faith of God that caused the Earth to be made it was that faith that he had inside of him he wasn't sitting up there worried about it he wasn't confused about it he wasn't he had what he was in his mind and that's what he spoke and when he spoke the Earth began to be made when he spoke the the the sun came forth when he spoke the stars came forth when he spoke the dry land appeared when he spoke Adam and or Adam come up out of the ground when God spoke that's what happened because he had his faith in his own word and I like to look at that I got to thinking about God's faith if you could ever have God's faith we might have our own faith in something sometimes but when you pick up on God's faith that changes everything things begin to start moving and things just begin to start changing when you get a hold of God's faith when God's faith comes down into you it changes the whole situation you could have you know something you've been praying for forever and you could have all the faith in the world but when God's faith steps down in there then you know that something's begin to change and we know that the creation was a manifestation of God's word brother Bram says but let's take it on another tree so we can bring it out and fulfill our text let's take it a tree of faith that Eve taken of this forbidden tree of unbelief that we could then we could make the text come out it was Faith she disbelieves God's word God said a certain certain thing will happen she ought to have left it alone she ought to ought to have believed it the way God said it but no Satan come along with his Theology and she mixed it and gave it to Adam and it caused a hybrid Faith that's what the church has got today so-called Church a hybrid Faith it's mixed with fears doubts frustration if it was genuine faith it wouldn't move When God says anything it would be that way but see she mixed it took what God Said and what Satan said and churned it together here it is that's the way many people do today see they take what the Bible says and what man says makes a hybrid faith and when they do they bring it back oh it makes a beautiful Church sure but it's no life in it it's dead a hybrid Faith oh I do believe that God was yes but now he's not a Healer today that's hybrid faith I believe to the the Holy Ghost to the Pentecostals back there on the day of Pentecost but that's not for us today a hybrid Faith condemned by God hybrid no good stay away from it it's evil it brings in doubts maybe I'll go up and get healed maybe the Lord will heal me that's hybrid Faith it's no good that's church Faith we want God's faith God said something and that's the truth stay with it amen oh I wish my words was wrote with an iron pin stay with what God said it's the truth hybrid Faith it'll read Hebrews 13 and say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews and then the hybrid faith comes in well in a certain way he's the same yesterday today and forever but he's not oh just right there when you think about Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever when you read the Bible and you read the what he did in the Old Testament and you see the things that happened the healings that happened when you see the the men of the old when they looked upon the on the brass serpent that they were healed when you look upon the cross you're healed he is Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God he was back there the same God he is today and when you get a hold to that faith that starts changing your life you can mix it with whatever you want to mix it with you can try to turn it and make your own idea you can try to reason it out you can try to think about it you can try to to forge it you could try to do whatever you want to do but when you begin to mix things with God's faith it starts turning things around that's what the church needs today they need a little bit of God's faith to step in because they're still want to do their own way they still want to do their own things people's wan to leave and they're trying to reason out God they're trying to say well God can't do this today God can't do that today the message is wrong this is wrong that's wrong what they're looking at is their own idea and their own faith but they never look to God's face because they missed the whole point they can look at the man but they miss the Christ you can look at the man all day but you miss the Jesus down inside the man when you miss the Jesus inside the man then there's something wrong the man the man could fall the man might make mistakes but when you look at Jesus Christ inside the man that turns everything around that's what I want to look at tonight I want to look at every person in here I don't want to see the man I don't want to see the nature of the man inside of them what I want to see is the Jesus that resides down in their heart I want to see the faith of God that comes out inside of them every day that's what I want to see I want to see when they're depressed that God would come down and they would step up just a little bit higher that's what I want to see tonight I want to see God move I want to see the hand of God's faith the genuine faith will say he is the same it's not hybrid it's not it's not all churched up with Theology of man not mule religion man's word and God's word mixed together like the perverted wi Vine hey amen I tell you when God says it that's the way it is you can hang your hat on that when God tells you something's going to happen you just go ahead and you stand upon that Faith When God says you're healed you stand upon that When God says you're saved you can stand on that why too many doctrines and theologies you got people getting saved every other night and they'll get saved tomorrow and get saved the next day and try to go get saved this time that God's already said it you need the altar experience you need that experience of God and when you get that then won't you stand upon that and then don't let the devil come back in you make a mistake you plead the blood of Jesus you fall down you just say Lord I'm sorry you get back up and you keep on going too many times people walk away from God and they walk back into the same nonsense that they they did they come out of because they don't know who he is he's a God that saves he's a God that heals he's a God that delivers why do I know that because he's done it for me I'm a witness that can stand here and tell you that God's faith got inside of me one day I had my own faith I had my own ideas I had my own will I had my own way but when my God stepped down inside of me it changed it all it changed it from corruptible to Incorruptible that's my God if my God can change me he can change anybody amen if my God can do that he can change anybody I have no doubt in my mind that God can change a biggest atheist that in the world he can go to him and he can prove who he is God can turn it around I don't see God sitting up there chewing on his fingernails wondering if you're going to be saved or not I don't see God chewing his fingernails wondering if he's going to see you in the Rapture I don't see him doing that I see him standing upon his word and saying that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and you're coming up here to be with me no matter what circumstances you go through no matter what sickness you come through no matter what depression comes your way no matter what reasoning comes out of you no matter what thing God is standing there saying you will be with me that's what I believe tonight I might have failed I might have made mistakes I might have tripped up but my God said you're going to be here amen that's the place that rock is Christ Jesus said point you to the promised land you get on him one time and you'll see every promise of God is true absolutely that's right if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you cuz he is the word it just manifests itself through you when you abide in him amen I love this what brother R says he said Enoch needed a ladder one day he had walked 500 years with God and had pleased him he needed a ladder God provided him a highway walked right up home amen them crazy things just get in the way half the time says Elijah needed a rope one time and God gave him a chariot with horses to it oh my Samson needed a spear and God gave him a jaw bone of a wild mule and it beat down a thousand Philistines with it God provides your needs God has a way what if Samson said now wait a minute this Jawbone isn't sharp it isn't a spear look at them big thick helmets on the Philistines he just took God's provided way and beat right into it that's all you need is to take What God Says and go to beaten with it just as hard as you can you'll get yourself free after a while yes sir amen when you get a hold to God's word you just take that word and you have a promise of God and you just start beating and you just just start beating and you just start beating and eventually you're going to get out of that mess because you took what God said about it and you took his word and that's what you did with just keep beating just keep beating amen he went through a thousand Philistines with Jawbone when natural nature tells you that there is no way that would happen but God Did It God's faith oh good lord God's faith stepped over into a jaw Bon a mu one time I tell you God's face stepped over when David was standing there and it got into a little old rock somewh where and it it knocked down a Philistine what can his word do in your heart tonight what can his word do with you tonight I tell you it'll break every chain it'll break every idea it'll break everything that youve got it'll break all the things that have bound you down that's what God's word will do for you that's what it's done for me Oh Glory to God Amen Joshua needed the bridge God provided a power God provided a power for you and I there was a there was a power sitting there we didn't have a power Pentecost didn't know what to do with it but God sent a man named William random and he was a prophet and he begin to show you what you could do with that power and you got a hold to the message of the hour and it changed you amen you didn't know where you were going turn these monitors up a little bit he did you didn't know what you were doing you had no idea but then that Prophet came and he begin to tell you he begin to point you the right direction he said that's Jesus over there that's where I'm pointing to amen that's that's what he's pointing to he says that's the faith that you need you he didn't need faith in the man but you needed faith in the god of the man that's where the faith that's what he pointed to that's all he ever did was he pointed to that and then somebody picked up that message and they started running with it somebody picked it up and now you look around you and you begin to hear the testimonies of what God is doing you begin to hear the cancers being healed you start to heal that people are being delivered of drugs and alcohol and all the things that come against you start seeing people matter of fact there was a a little testimony come out of a brother Tim PR that he was that they were having service one night and a young man had had left church and he wasn't going back and he was out working or no he they said he was asleep in his bed and and it was a Wednesday night and he woke up and it was real late he he walked around the house and he got to look and there was nobody in the in the house and he's like well where's everybody at well the young boy had thought honestly thought that the Rapture taking place so that young man got in his truck and drove down the road they said he went through Fields he went through everywhere getting to church and he walked in that church and at that time right before that his sister had went up for prayer for him and then he come in that church wearing his pajamas and found the Lord there he's still an on time God oh how how long do you have to wait I don't know Abraham waited 25 long years Abraham waited forever but then one day Sarah be to cry out and begin to give birth about something that was a promised son and there he was and oh and Abraham could take and he picked up in the he picked up Isaac and he held him in his arms what I thought that it was that Abraham was standing there with Isaac and holding him and carried him and he knew that God had met his needs oh Hallelujah you talk about God's faith Daniel needed the fence to keep the Lions off of him God gave him an angel see that's the provided way what needed God provided and God provided in his own way now what If Daniel would have said now wait a minute I can think of a better way than a pillar of fire standing before me now that that line might not have any effect upon him he might come right on through that Pillar of Fire if you'll just get me a great big fence and fence me in see that would have been Daniel trying to do something but he just accepted God's provided way laid down and went to sleep and slept all night just in peace God provided a away the Hebrew children needed some water a fire hose down there to put out all that fire when they jumped in there but God provided them a fourth man God provided a fourth man in the fire god provided a pillar of fire for us to lead us in this day amen if we wouldn't have had the pillar of fire where would we be we would had the message of the hour where would we be and people want to just go off and and wander off out in the wilderness cuz that's where they're headed they're wandering around in the wilderness because they're not following the pillar of fire that's what we need tonight we need to follow that Pillar of Fire wherever it goes wherever it leads it might lead you down into some into some ghetto somewhere but you follow that Pillar of Fire I don't care where it takes you you follow that and you hang on to that because that is not just a just a flame or or or some myth or something but that is the word of God that's Jesus Christ walking again that's what it is amen the wise men needed a compass God provided a star they took the star that's all they needed the church needed power God provided the Holy Ghost he didn't provide a book of Ethics he didn't provide a Christian government he provided the Holy Ghost that's what God provided he never Ste go up there and study at Jerusalem up there until I get a certain amount of Education in you till I indument you and so and so he said wait until youve endued or you're endued with power from on high after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you shall be my Witnesses in Jerusalem Samaria in Chicago Illinois in Black Rock Arkansas in werri Arkansas over in India down in Peru over in South Africa you go preaching my word because I will give you the words to say when you get there take no thought of what you will say cuz I'll be with you cuz that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what's leading me that's what's guiding me I don't people try to talk people out of it uhuh you ain't talking me out of it you can't talk me out of it I seen God show up in a job on a me m I've seen God heal broken arms I've seen God give people the Holy Ghost and I never thought they would ever got the Holy Ghost amen raising my own hand pointing to myself I've seen God raise the dead I've seen that God I've seen a God In Action if if you don't want a God In Action I don't know what you want too many times they've got Gods that they Wonder off to and they they try to get and they try to say well this God's this and that's God's that that God's over here I tell you one time they did that and they put the the the Ark of the Covenant in there with their God and their God was a great big fish God and in the next morning they come in there and the God was laying on his face they gone the fish God was laying on his face before the Ark of the Covenant and they they come in there and they propped him back up you know they might have put a stick over I don't want a God that you got to prop up I don't want a God that I got to go take some cement and try to try to put his feet back on because the next time they come in there his arms and and his feet were busted off of him I don't want that that kind of God I want a God that's a deliverer I want a God that's a Healer I want a God that's a savior I want a god that'll take my pain away I want a god that'll take depression away I want a god that'll take anxiety away I want a God that delivers me and that's what I have tonight amen cuz he's my God he's our God he pulled you out of situations You' have never dreamed he' you come out of amen and I'm happy that he's my God I'm grateful that he's my God I I want to worship my God I Want To Praise my God I want to give my God thanks I've watched too many people stand at some chilly old ball game and I've done it myself I stood up there and I've shouted for the ball game I've went to the concert I stood on the back of the bench and oh I was just happy as I could be I was happy as I could be standing in that old ball game or that old concert oh but then something got a hold to me and I come to a new new place and now I can come in here and I can start talking about my God and oh Lord I ain't going to stand on the chair but I that's what I was doing I was standing in a chair at that concert I'm sitting there singing her I was amen standing there just a just a singing and shouting and praising I guess if you want to call it that but when I start talking about my god when you start telling me about what God has done for you that does something to my soul when brother Matt goes to India and he comes back and he starts witnessing of what God has done that does something to my heart because what I can do then is I can take the the testimony that he has and I can go give it to somebody else that needs it because he I asked him the other day I said I said I I hope you don't mind this but I I said I I told somebody a testimony of yours and he said it ain't my test Tony it's the Lord's testimony amen it's the Lord can you imagine it's the Lord's testimony cuz the Lord is the one did it God is the one did it God's the one brought you out of your sickness God's the one that brought you out of all the nonsense you were in it's God that did it amen amen God showed up amen God there's another door just around the corner it's a Door of Faith oh there's many of them let's talk of Faith just a moment now I'll let you in Jesus but I've got my own faith well he can't do much for you if you got your own faith I don't want no faith I want his faith my faith is no good the faith of God is what we need God's faith in us my faith is no good your faith is no good it takes Christ to come in and stand in that door of faith and be Lord Lord over your faith when you read in the Bible Jesus Christ the same yesterday today day and forever your faith will your faith will say that's impossible but his faith will say amen I am if the critic says the days of Miracles have passed the the faith of God will say he doesn't know what he's talking about if the critic says Jesus doesn't heal the holy spirit standing in the door of your faith will say I'm the Lord that Health all of thy diseases it just makes such a difference to let him in at the door of Faith do you believe that tonight I tell you God is faithful he's my God I begin to look over and when we were starting to read Hebrews chapter 11 it says by faith abble offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and without faith it is impossible to believe to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of him that diligently seek Him by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet move with fear prepared an arc to the saving of his house by faith Abraham by faith oh they're all I ain't really got time to go through there's 40 verses right there and one more shall I sa for the time would fail to tell me of Gideon of barck of Samson and Jeffy of David also and Samuel and other prophets who through faith subdue kingdoms righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escaped the edge of sword out of weakness were made strong wax vient in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received our dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of of of cruel mockings and scourging gave more ever of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned and they were swn aunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wondered about sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in Deads and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen first Peter 2 and9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light how many's come out of Darkness tonight every one of us should have our hands raised because every one of has come out of Darkness we have stepped over into the light the light that God has provided it's not some some man-made idea it's not a man-made light but it's a pillar of fire that's what we stepped into and that's what I want to step in tonight I want to see that Pillar of Fire moving and stirring and stirring people's hearts and it moves over here and it moves over there and it begins to speak to people that's the light that I want to be in I want to be in a light that is manifested of god the devil can manifest anything he wants he can create it he can try to make it he can try to reason he can try to do all that but my God is real amen which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which have not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy for thou are Deuteronomy 7 for thou are Unholy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more number for than any people but you are the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you because he would keep an oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations amen you love the Lord tonight you know I got to thinking about you know the the the faith that is manifested I wanted to kind of go through something it's kind of a little simple a simple thing but some of some of us you know some of us you know grew up kind of playing chess a little bit you know me and Matt grew up with with it and I don't know how many knows a lot about Chess but as I begin to look at the chessboard I started looking at at at the different pieces of the chessboard you're sitting there and every piece that is on that board is working for the king every piece there is working under the authority of the king you know the the Chess Master sitting there and everything is working under that Authority you begin to look at the Queen the the queen has more Authority than any spece on the board she can go she can go at any angle she can go straight and she can go any way she wants she holds the authority and her main job is to protect the king without the queen when you take the Queen off the board or somebody captures that it it causes problems but she holds an authority that the other pieces don't hold she holds that Authority and you begin to look at every piece of Bishops they have their place the knights they have their place the Rooks they have their place but every time they move they're moving under the authority of that King but there's one little piece that I want to talk about tonight that the little Pawn It's the littlest guy on the board and in chest every piece is worth so many points a lot of people don't play that way but they're all worth and he's a least of all that little Pawn don't mean nothing you know he can be just sacrificed to a lot of guys they just sacrifice and throw him off the board so we don't really need that pawn and that little Pawn he he's kind of he's kind of limited to what he can do he he's kind of limited in what he can and how he can move you know his first his first move is that you know he can move two spaces on his first move that's a that's a big jump for the pawn but then after that you know that little Pawn he begins to get around and and he can only take one step at a time he can only move forward one time and you know he looks over and he sees this great bishop and he he looks over at him he's like well that guy can move way over here matter of fact that night he can jump people and he can do all this over here and and when he looks at that Queen he looks and he says you know what you know I'd like to be that little Queen someday I'd like to be that but but you know he's just a kind of a simple little old pawn but that pawn he starts going through a lot he starts going through through spaces and he's seeing all this movement around him he's watching his buddies you know get captured knocked off the board but he's only moving one step at a time and I find that sometimes that people only move one step at a time sometimes it feels like you're moving backwards even but just move one step at a time like that little Pond just keep moving just keep taking your steps just keep moving but then that little Pawn comes up to one more step there's eight squares on a board it's a 8 by8 board and that pond steps over into that e Square he gets through all the defenses he gets through all the things and all the conditions and all all the fights and all the wars and all the battles and all the things that come against him all the people that are talking about talking about him saying you don't mean nothing little pwn you ain't nothing you ain't nobody you're never going to make it you're never going to get any bigger you're never going to get any hard higher you're never going to do anything and he just keeps stepping but when he moves over into that eigh step he moves over into the Eighth Day there's something that begins to happen with that little Pawn there is a choice that's being made right there that little Pond can now become a queen but anything that he wants to be that's what he can be and then when he becomes a Queen full Authority is placed upon his life when you become the Bride of Jesus Christ full Authority is placed upon your life and then here's what I want you to do after you took that eight step I want you to turn around I want you to look at the board and you look at all the pieces that have about you all the things that have battled you all the pieces that have done everything to you and tell those pieces who you are tell them who you are and that's what they said to those men they said who are you Jesus I know Jesus I know Paul I know but let me tell you because a pawn is never just a pawn a pawn is a queen in waiting all you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward one square after another and you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of Power who are you who are you this this is what I want to hinge on tonight you talk about faith being manifest I want to tell you who you are tonight I'm the one that was healed with cancer when they ask you who are you I'm the one who's depressed and now have joy I'm the one who has anxiety and now have peace I'm the one who was healed with headaches I'm the one who had strokes but I'm now healed I'm the one who was blind but now I see I was the one who had foot pain for a year and a half now I have no pain I was the one who was an addict and now I am free I was the one who was

it behind you and you got all the things that are in there all the little goodies and all the food and all the the the things that are in your house that you can enjoy and the devil's locked outside cuz you hold the key one day death had you bound one day it had you bound but Jesus went and took the keys of death and hell and unlock the door amen who are you you're the one that saw your name written upon the L's Book of Life why are you shouting John because I looked over and I saw my name written there that's what I've done tonight I look over and I see my name written upon the Lamb's

there and it was just like anytime something would happen something would happen things would it's just a big seemed like everything wanted to fight with us to get out there we got out there and brother uh brother Joe had had had quoted a quote about the cookie y'all remember the him talking about the the kid the child w a cookie so the Wednesday morning I come and told him I was talking to him about it and I said you know brother Joe Wednesday morning I was listening to a tape and brother brand quotes that quote you know I thought that was amazing I thought you know what the lord is good well this is two times Thursday night I went out to the camp and brother Andrew Glover was standing out he he told me to come here and I got to testify him testifying to him about that quote and his mouth just fell open he was standing there and he went that's where I'm at Thursday night he quoted the same quote so it got me to thinking you know what I'm going to cry out to God God I need a cookie I need something and I'm going to get it amen I need something I'm going to get it I'm going to bug you until I get it amen I'm going to bug you until I get it I'm going to bug you till I get my peace I'm going to bug you till I get my Deliverance I'm going to bug you till I get healed I'm going to BU B you I'm going go there was a man did that one time that Elijah was standing there he said if you see me go you're going to get a double portion of what I have and then elishah got to get all over him you know Elijah was probably like man would you leave me alone would you get off my back he said no I'm not going to get off your back because I've had a promise I've had a promise I'm not getting off your back and he followed him and he followed him and then there come a day that Elijah was fixing to go up and Elijah took his mantle and he walked over to the river and he said River roll back and the river roll back and he walked across and Elijah he told Elisha you you might wait here no I'm coming with you I'm getting that double portion I'm going to get that and he went across with him and then out of the heavens came a chariot of fire and horses and oh Elijah the man of God that he was stepped up over onto that Chariot and he took off up to heaven and Elijah going wasn't just a second or two the mantle fell back down and Elisha picked up the mantle oh and it fit him quite well by the way and he went to that River and he rolled that that that mantle up in his hand and he smoke the river he said where is the god of Elijah and the river rolled back and I tell you tonight where is the god of Elijah it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ that is where it's at because that was a sheep be waving that's what that was that was showing you who you could be that was showing you the authority that you have that's showing you who you are and it's time to step out and tell the devil who you are but we were out there again and the aaden he always had that thing with his eye little Crosse eye that got messed up when he was little when he was a baby a man grew over and he stopped the growth of the vision of that eye and so I took him up PR prayer and I told the brothers what was going on with him and so they they prayed for him and then uh the next day there was a blind man come through the through the line and we prayed for it and then brother Wendell the next night whatever night it was Saturday night he is testifying he said there is a man here that God healed of blindness and the brother out I thought well I want to talk to that fell I want to talk to him I want ask him his testimony when me and Sarah went out when we went out that night I I went up to him I got introduce myself we got to talking and I said brother you know tomorrow if you got time I'd like to hear your testimony and his wife said you know what uh it's not very long you can tell it now and the first words that come out of his mouth was my eye was crossed lost when he was born and right then and there I knew the Lord was speaking me I knew it anyway but it was just a confirmation that God was there and he said I had surgery on my eye to fix it and that surgery caused my eye to go blind that's the same surgery they're wanting to do with with Aiden to fix that eye and and he said he was in a meeting in at brother Sean Martin he was sitting in the congregation and the Lord dealt with him and he said Lord I'm Healed and accepted his healing it was a manifestation of his faith the man told his wife when he left he said I'm driving home and held his hand over his good eye while he drove home I looked at the man I saw the man and both of his eyes are just as straight as they can be but the faith that I have for that little boy right there there's going to be a

house of God and the Lord come by and say but you're not a nobody you're somebody the Queen of Heaven my praise the Lord and I just I appreciate that but Mark said I want to see the Jesus in the man you know he he was telling that testimony and I know he wasn't here Sunday and heard you know testimony of of of his mother-in-law praying for she had come up for prayer for Aiden Sunday morning he didn't know that they didn't know anything that was going on and and I told the testimony there at the end of the service and and I i' been gotten in just under inspiration was telling the testimony of that little girl that was healed and of blindness and and I didn't know what brother Mark was going to preach tonight but I put this I put this down because I wanted when I told it I don't want to tell anything wrong and when I told it I kind of mixed up two different test testimonies and I and I pray y'all forgive me for that I don't I don't I'm human and and I mess up more than anybody but but but the but the account of it was greater than I could tell it anyway and you know somebody had brought it to my attention and you know called that that little girl was that was a little white girl and I'd call her black girl and kind of mixed up the stories whatever but but uh but but you know sometimes we get lost in the weeds and we miss the we missed the whole story but I thought you know I'll I just wanted to to share this tonight and and uh that this uh this had happen in Jonesboro Arkansas and actually uh it wasn't just I I'd put both stories together and but it was two different testimonies and two's better than one anyway and so I thought you know what I'll just read it the way it happened and and uh and and I didn't know he was going to preach that or tell testimonies about his boy's eyes but but the the Lord had already put this on my heart so I just want to read it tonight but brother Bram was telling an account of these are me the meetings that took place in Jonesboro in the first account and and it was that little girl that came to him and asked asking for healing and or you remember she had she was coming to look for the Healer and and he said she's coming this way and pushing and bumping and excusing herself and hollering daddy daddy where are you he said and I leaned over and he said I he said you know wait till this is over he said because you're going to think I was a hypocrite doing this he said but I moved over to where I got right in line with her and she'd go this way and I'd stay in the way until she bumped into me and when she bumped in something told me to go over there he said when she hit me she said pardon me I said yes ma'am she said Daddy I said what do you want who are you calling she said sir uh I I I want my daddy and I can't find him nowhere and I just don't there ain't nobody to help me and he said where you from she said I'm from Memphis and that's about 80 miles out of and they took those charter buses and I seen one that said Memphis and I said well where are you going over here and she said I come to see the Healer he said the what and I just thought I'd try her faith she he said I know it was horrible looks horrible to do that but she said I come to see the Healer she said they tell me this this was his last night here and I can't even get near the building and I've lost my daddy and I ain't got nobody to help me get back to the bus I don't know what to do will you help me kind sir he said I he said I I said I want to ask you a minute question you a minute you said you come to see who she said the Healer he said you believe in such stuff as that she said yes sir said I thought well that kind of made me feel you know I said I believe he could help you and she said yes sir he said well look she said I was the he said it was a little girl she said I was 10 years old I had cataracts on my eyes the doctor told me when they got rip he would take them out now I don't know what rip means but but when they got rip he' take them out he said now they're rip and the doctor says that if he would take them out he would pull my Optical nerves out of my eyes and I can't ever be healed until I go in the building and see him I said Well Woman do you believe any such stuff as that in the days of These Fine doctors in medical science do you believe that the story about the angel appearing to that man is the truth she said yes sir he said now we couldn't she couldn't see me me cuz she was totally blind I said how' you hear about this she said on the radio this morning I heard a man testifying that he had been blind so that that man from about 10 years I know brother Brown tells this story three times and one time he says it and the man had been blind for 20 years one time he said the man had been blind for 10 years one time the the man was from kennet Missouri one time he said the man was from Corning Arkansas don't get caught in the weeds we live here we know what kennet and Corning is I call kenet Corning and Corning kenet my whole life I can't never get him St don't get caught in the weeds he said but nevertheless she said he said well that she had heard a man that had came and and and and and uh had been healed and and so she had came on that testimony of another man being healed and she said I read I heard him testify and I heard him on the radio testifying and reading his Bible and she said that's the only hope that I have to ever see I said Do You Believe such and she said yes sir he said listen sir is there any way you could just get me to where he's at and if you'll get me to where he's at I'll find my daddy after that he said that was too much for me she said I'll find my daddy if you can just get me in there I thought that's the way our God is he he he tried her faith just enough until she find out she had the faith of God and but friends what What mattered was is she was standing in the presence of the Creator and his name wasn't William brandham it was Jesus Christ and he worked through a prophet of God to give a little girl her sight back isn't that wonderful tonight that our God would give a little girl back her sight I believe that same God that would take a man in Oklahoma and that would that would fix his eyes that was crossed that had gone blind the same God that'll touch that little boy's eyes that is Sting here tonight I believe that and I shared that that you know I know how that that this world is today and and you know they there's let me can I just give you something free tonight let me give you something that's going to help you because you're going to come there this you mark my words you're going to be challenged you'll be challenged in this hour of of testimonies that brother brandham told well this way somebody said it this way and this way somebody but I want to tell you something that William brandom nor any man that's ever been ordained of God to preach the gospel has ever made a claim that William brandham was an infallible man he never claimed that and any god-ordained man has never claimed that any man that God has ever inspired has never claimed that that does not come from God people may have put that on his life but that did not come from God and it never came from him but let me say this but the message that he preached was an infallible message it was sent for the purpose of bringing a bride out of Le oosa and bringing a people back to God that they would find out who they came from and they would see the very Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ don't get caught in the weeds but you'll be challenged on it but you have to know that same you think about it they would pick little parts and they pick on his stories I I kind of feel that way sometimes people pick on me I tell stuff backwards all the time I don't mean to and I don't do it to mislead anybody and you know if we could if we could ask him brother BR why'd you tell that that way and then the other time you said it was blue and the other time you said it was black he'd say friend I'm you forgive me sometimes I'm tired and I I'm weak in my body and you forgive me I don't mean to do that that's the way he would do it don't don't don't don't let that whenever whenever that comes around you you I'm just giving you a fair warning one day that'll come around and there'll somebody sit in your living room or call you on the e e she said I believe I will see when I leave here brother brandom then asked everyone to bow their heads the young man he did not mean to be disrespectful it was suddenly brother Brandon pushed the little blind girl from him and as he did the young man watched intently as big white marbles these were his words formed in her eyes he stifled a gasp at the sight just as as brother Brown spoke to the little girl he said oh honey I forgot to ask you what color eyes did you want and the little girl quickly answered blue and once more brother Brandon pulled her back to him and in a voice that conveyed both assurance and humility he said Lord I forgot to ask you if you would give her blue eyes the young man's gaze was fixed upon the child's eyes as he saw the blue of the iris's form in the child's eyes even as she had asked the prophet of of God she left the building seeing through new blue eyes although almost half a century has passed that young man now a pastor in a Southern state has never forgotten the day he really witnessed the power of God to create the Creator is still here that's the point of the story is the creator is still Among Us isn't it wonderful to know the Creator friends let me tell you that same Creator is still here today let me tell you another story I was standing at in India one day I and a man come up to the prayer line and he walked up there and I'd been preaching and and in in my broken way of preaching but something had put a a draw in his heart to to come up and some other people in the the assembly had known him in the street they knew that he was blinding they went and they got him and they brought him into the meeting and they brought him up to the front of the platform and after preaching of the faith of God and the power of God and brother Joe when they stood that man before me that day I wanted to hide behind the platform because I didn't know how you you you you preach something and there's such an authority in preaching it but whenever they walk that man up I realized I had no ability to open his eyes I had no ability to heal him I had nothing I could offer him except for the word that I'd been preaching and I felt about this big and I walked around there to the side of that little platform and those Brothers had brought him up and had an interpreter there said brother what do you come for prayer and the brother began to speak for him he said he's blind he's been blind for many years and it may have been from his birth if I told that before it was from his birth y'all forgive me me because I'm human sometimes I forget but I don't remember if it was when it was birth or or maybe it been been many years but long long time when the man was blind he stood before me you could see over his eyes they were glazed over in a in a in an odd look it it wasn't even an ordinary look and I'm not a doctor but I just I just know it wasn't how the human eye supposed to look and I stood there and the only thing I knew to do was testifying of what our Creator God could do and I went testimony after testimony I be to tell that man to the best of my remember remance and I told him of how that John Ryan brother Joe told about it the other day I told him how John Ryan had received his healing and I told him about the little girl in Jonesboro and I told him I said I'm from Jonesboro I'm from the same city that that little girl was healed in and I told him about the other little girl that was healed there and I'm from Jonesboro and I and I begin to make connection with him about how God the Creator God had had came and done these these miraculous things and as I testified about Jesus and all the things that Jesus had done and I kept telling him after a little while or a few minutes I asked him I said brother I said do you I said do you know Jesus or I said if you heard of Jesus he said well he said I've heard of him but I've never met him I thought my what a what a response he said I've heard of him but I've never met him and I said well friend he's standing here right now and I'd like to introduce you to him and I started I knelt down and I asked him I said well friend let me ask you if he was a God that could heal other eyes would you serve him if he had heal your eyes too and that man said I'd serve him all the days of my life would you renounce the gods of India the gods that that that you've been serving that you got on your mantel that you that you carry out in your pocket and we would you serve this Jesus if he had open your eyes and the man's testimony he said I would serve him if he had opened my eyes and I stood there with them brothers and I laid my hands on that man and we had prayer for him they let him out of that building just a few minutes later a few the power God dropped in there the people was worshiping other people many healings that took place in that meeting they let him out of the building that night we came back and we had another service later on that evening and at the end of that evening I watched as that man come in there and here in one hand he had one woman in the other hand he had another woman and he walked up there I remember him stepping over a cord and I thought isn't that something that that man it was the wires and all the cords that they had bundled up to go to all the microphones and speakers and I remember watching that man as he scuffled up and Brother David and he stepped over that cord about ran out of the back of the building I thought what would give that man the ability a a man that couldn't see a few hours before but he had enough that he could see the cord laying in the floor and he walked up to the front of that church he said brother Matt he said he said I brought my wife and this is my mother-in-law he said and they want to serve Jesus too I thought is't this something that our God why because he's a Creator God he can put enough in them enough faith in somebody that his wife would give her heart to the Lord and his mother-in-law there ain't no telling how many shows that have been worn from the testimony of one man I remember when I got on the plane and that brother sent me an email from India and I was I was sitting there on the flight going home it's about a 30h hour flight mix you know stopping and going and I remember when I was sitting on that flight and somehow got enough when he got on the Wi-Fi and got an email Brother David I got an email from that brother and he got to testifying of what that man had said and and and Buddy when he started testifying about got in trouble on the plane and he he he wrote in the email he said that brother he said brother Matt when he when you told him that Jesus the Same Jesus that healed that little girl and the same Jesus that healed John Ryan and the same Jesus that put the eyes that made mud and put it in that Blind Man's eyes over there by the pool of salom when you told him the testimonies of what Jesus done and you said that same Jesus is standing here right now would you meet him he said the man was blind he said and in his testimony he didn't realize that Jesus this is in India in his testimony he didn't realize Jesus was one that had an Earthly Ministry 2,000 years ago and that he wasn't really standing there he said and that man told us that when you told him that he thought he was just standing there beside you because he couldn't see you no more than he could see him I thought brother isn't that something he said didn't our Prophet say that our sight is a hindrance to our faith in the very in the very senses of our flesh is a hindrance to our faith I thought isn't that something but that man stood there and his own sight couldn't be a hindrance to him to believe that Jesus was still standing there and could give him back his sight that's the kind of faith that I want tonight the faith of God that could drop into the heart of a man and his senses his five senses couldn't hinder him from believing God I had a jubilee on the airplane R home I I come up out of my seat saying praise the Lord oh God don't ever let my senses be hindrance to my faith and he received his healing that's my God he's the Creator and he's still alive today he's still doing the same work today and I believe that Daddy has got a right to confess the healing for his son's eyes that one day that little boy will stand in this same pulpit and Testify the same thing that I was a little boy and my eyes were crossed and it bothered me but I but my but my daddy and my mama they stood for me and God healed my eyes and I'm here to testify about today that I'm Healed by the blood of Jesus Christ why because our God is a Creator he's a Healer brother Mark said we had an authority when you know who you are to stand on the truth of God's word isn't he Wonderful Tonight somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight Our God's A Healer he's a miracle worker I say praise the Lord I believe every word of it can we bless his name oh would you play well you can lock me up in a prison when you can throw away the key oh you can take away my vision that Des
