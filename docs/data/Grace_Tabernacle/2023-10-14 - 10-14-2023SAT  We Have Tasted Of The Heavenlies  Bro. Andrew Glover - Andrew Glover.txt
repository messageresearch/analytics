give a a hand clap for that he God something a great sacrifice to put on a meeting like this know many brothers and pastors have come and love David S back there and pastoring and left his his own home Church to be able to be here and it's it's a sacrifice to be here and I know they need him at home and but he made the sacrifice to be here and the sacrifice is rewarded by the souls and the lives that's held and that's what we do as Ministers of the gospel and as people and Believers that we we we sacrifice so that somebody can be help I know I be and I want to give all that I can that somebody else beside me maybe something that you're going through or somebody watching a service service online might not even be here but God is ministering won't be long friends we'll never have another meeting like this again we'll be caught up in the air to meet our Lord in the air I still believe in the Rapture I believe in the Rapture of the church I don't think we're out here just

Tabernacle we say thank you and God bless you and all the work and effort that goes into attemp meeting amen we are believing that there will be many Souls on the other side that their names will be attached to the labors of this assembly for the things that God has done and I I'm thankful tonight to be a part of what God is doing in this generation amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go straight to the word we'll invite you to one place we want to read tonight in the book of Hebrews the 6th chapter and we want to look in the first verse of Hebrews chapter 6 and my what a powerful service here last night amen word of the Lord just so rich Among Us Len anden I believe every service every Minister and that has given to themselves to be a blessing to God's children we want to thank them and sure looking forward to the service in the morning heing brother David and amen these men of God that stand for this message we thank the Lord for them amen amen Real Men of God that preach this message with all their hearts amen the book of Hebrews the 6th chapter and in the first verse I want to read here I love Paul's writings how many loves Paul's writings amen he said say here in Hebrews 6 and verse one he says now therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection oh yeah not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God but of the doctrine of the baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment now watch this next verse and this we will do if God permits so Paul here is exhorting to see spiritual progress so not staying where they were but moving forward now watch here in verse four for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift how many's tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come now watch this if they shall fall away to renew them again under repentance seeing they crucify to the themselves sells the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beare thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh un cursing whose end is to be burned now watch verse n but beloved we are persuaded better things of you oh yeah amen I believe you speak speak to us tonight amen we are persuaded of better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak amen we ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seats this afternoon for a few moments I want you by the help of the Lord to speak to you tonight out of these scriptures and if I will title this sermon tonight I want to speak to you on we have tasted of the heavenlies amen we have tasted of the heavenlies I believe here as Paul said in Hebrews 6 he said that tasted of the Heavenly gift we have tasted of the good word of God we have tasted of the powers of the world that is to come now that word tasted it means to try the flavor of to taste it means to perceive the flavor of it means to partake of to enjoy to feel to make trial of to experience to take food to eat Amen to take nourishment so here we're finding out that some amen tasted and when they tasted they went backwards amen but then there was some that tasted and they didn't go backwards but they went forward and you know I believe here this week amen every service every song every word that's been said amen I believe that we have tasted of the goodness of God how many can testify that we have tasted of the goodness of God Amen brother says it like this and turning northward he said that's just the way it is he said when I get a taste of God when the Holy Ghost comes into the meeting that's good but I want more of it amen amen it's good to taste it on Wednesday night but I want more of him on Thursday and it's good to Tas him Thursday amen but I want more of him on Friday and it's good to Tas him on Friday but I want more tonight amen I say this there's going to be more tomorrow because he is the inexhaustible Fountain amen of Truth amen when the Holy Ghost comes in the meeting that's good but I want more of it see amen and there's more of it because he promised that every Redemptive blessing is ours how many are redeemed here tonight then if you are redeemed every Redemptive blessing belongs to you amen as a son and daughter of almighty God Amen as we so beautifully heard last night that we as a human amen we have an inner man we have an outer man and the outer man has five senses amen and the inner man has five senses amen and the Inner Man and the outer man is contacted amen by those five senses of our Earthly home but you know I love here in Psalms 34:8 these two scriptures have just been have just been ringing in my heart in Psalms 348 David said oh and see amen that the Lord is good amen blessed is the man amen that trusteth in him in the New Testament Jesus says in Mark 9 verse1 he said unto them verily I say unto you amen there be some of them that stand here amen which shall not taste the death amen though they have seen the kingdom of God Amen come with power now I don't know about you amen but that blesses my heart to know we're living in a Time Amen brother brother amamos from the world is full of uncertainty amen the politics are uncertain religion is uncertain amen come on education is uncertain everything in the world brother Tom is uncertain but there's one thing that's not uncertain and that's the Lord Jesus Christ in his word is not uncertain amen listen the world today is full of Uncertain sounds amen but we are not following an uncertain sound we are fallowing a Vindicated sound and it's not a sound to go back it's a sound to go for and I don't think church we got to keep going through the motions amen and going through recycle services and going through Cycles but I believe I'm talking to people tonight that have heard a certain sound and they have recognized that they're anointed to break the cycle of Revival and death and move forward I want to tell the devil there's some people here in this meeting amen that got to touch from God and they'll never go back to the things of the world there's some people here in this tent now that God tou from God and they'll never desire the things way I to see it amen because they tasted of the goodness of God Amen and they know that it's something more than a feeling it's something more than a sensation something more than an emotion something more than a tradition it's something more than a religion it is an experience amen of the goodness of God I don't know about you but I feel like preaching here tonight I'm talking to some people that is experienced amen the goodness of God when it look like you was going down God brought you through it when it looked like it was over God brought you through it when it look like this is the way things with in God said no amen he called a little gospel tent meeting Amen to give you an outpour of his spirit and you have tasted of the goodness of God Amen I know there's a lot of uncertainty but there's one thing that's not uncertain and that is the goodness of God go down preaches that message the uncertain sound he said no you made it very dark brother brandom you said there's all kinds of things uncertain he said is there anything thing that's certain he said yes he said the word of God he said now they say the old slogan that there's two things that's certain one is taxes and the other one is death he said now death isn't certain no indeed amen there might be a Rapture amen there might be a Rapture then there's no death amen death ain't too certain no amen not in this day it was many years ago amen but not now death is not too certain do you realize friends that we are in a meeting tonight amen that in the next moment we can lead time and step into eternity I'm just going to preach and certain night do you realize in this meeting that loved ones amen could come walking through this tent in just a moment and your eyes could see them and you would know that in just a few moments things are going to begin to change listen we're not just having church services we're not just gathering together and singing a few songs but dimensions are blending together in one of these days time is going to give away to and Corruption is going to get we and incorruption and the old is going to become new and the dead are going to raise and listen I believe it can happen right here tonight amen I believe we have tasted of something that could take us from this world into the next World am then death is not too certain under this message there is a promise of a Rapture I love how how Webster defines this y'all preaching me and I a even lay the foundation amen Webster defines this word taste he says it is to ass certain the flavor of Amen by taking a little into the mouth Amen to eat or drink especially in small quantities to perceive or recognize amen it's if by the sense of taste I love this definition it is to become acquainted with by experience amen so when you taste something you are coming acquainted with it by experience it is a sensation of came from a substance Amen in the mouth that is typically produced amen by the stimulation of the of taste combined a with those of touch and smell amen when you taste something amen you're moving beyond just smelling it when you taste something you're moving beyond just seeing it amen but now you're becoming acquainted with it amen by the experience of partaking of it but said there's something about a man or woman that ever tasted of Jesus Christ amen they can't taste the world no more amen they will spit out every time he said I'm so glad that we have a heavenly father that if we'll just permit him he will place us in a place where the devil's house and all the whiskey and night clubes can never touch us amen we are far beyond the screams of this world and all of its pop and all of its worldly mixture and all of its FAL Fanatics amen if a man's ever tasted of that good gift of God Amen these things become As Dead As midnight I tell you what's happened here this weekend amen the things of the world has become dead amen and the things of God have become a reality in your heart listen I believe that depression has died here this weekend I believe that cancer has died here this weekend I believe that fears and complexes and family curses and generational curses and church problems and church situation I believe they di here this weekend and there is still a resurrection of the reality of Jesus Christ if a man or woman itates to the things of God the world is dead to him they'll never think about it again acquainted we are acquainted amen by experience amen you know what Daniel 11:32 says it says that such as the wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries amen but the people how many people do we have here but the people brother Vernon that do know their God they shall be strong and do exploits the people that do know their God Amen shall be strong and do exploits somebody say we know our God we know our God the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploits but said what if in the morning or tonight sometime you would happen to turn over and feel a real strange pain in your side you'd happen to say oh what is this you'd call for the doctor the Pain's going down your side and then the doctor says heart attack just a few more minutes he said then what was about this experience of being born again he said what about knowing Jesus Oh you say well I know the mayor of the city and I'm acquainted with a pastor that ain't what I'm talking about what about being born again and knowing Jesus amen don't you guess at it just don't imagine you are amen but you must be born again and I don't mean a fanatical emotional mental workup he said I mean a real experience amen I mean a real experience in other places said usually experience amen ACC companies faith and that's the reason usually it takes a person amen that is acquainted with Christ as the Forgiveness of their sins Amen to know that he's forgiven you amen you had experience when you're born again amen then Christ forgave you and you know it I tell you why there's such a liberty in this T it's because there ain't a bunch of people hollering wondering if God forgive them there ain't a bunch of people shouting wondering if their sins are in the SE of forgetfulness amen but by the power of the Holy Ghost there is a revelation that is Dr in the M of their soul amen that their sins are annihilated amen their past is Forgiven they are redeemed and they're saved they're Sanctified they're sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil couldn't get you if he had to we're not here shouting because we're we're guesting and shouting we're shouting because we know amen that Christ has forgiven us therefore with that experience amen it's easy then for you to believe God Amen for anything that he promised when you've had an experience it's easy to believe God for anything that he's promised you listen some of you all believe for salvation and the devil said that's as much as you can believe for amen but what about last night what about breaking Beyond amen just believing for one pain or believing for two things we believing for three things listen I'm going to preach tonight I believe it's time to start believing for the Rapture I think it's time to start what the devil tell us amen that this is the way things will always be amen this world is coming to an end America is on the way down politics are falling apart amen but there is a revelation of the Rapture that is sing on this generation that some morning she not taste de but she will taste the supper of the marriage of the lamb and she will go there the world is falling apart but there's a bride that is coming together if you ever become acquainted with God and then then you can take anything his word says and you all know there's a natural man that has a natural diet and there's a spiritual man that has a spiritual gu you know the prophet said the Holy Spirit feeds on the word I'm going to go and preach to you tonight because some of you all amen God done some miraculous things for you in these meetings amen God answered questions he broke chains he broke addictions amen he give a lot in your future listen you cannot stop amen and just say well God done something for me but you got to feed that experience and you cannot feed a Heavenly experience on Earthly Mana you got to feed a Heavenly experience Amen on Heavenly things you cannot feed an Earthly experience with Heavenly Man the Earthly feeds the Earthly amen but the Heavenly feeds the Heavenly I don't know what I'm going to do on Monday when these meetings over I tell you what you're going to do mean you're going to lay in the message of the hour and you're going to feed on the vitamins of the word of God and it's going to give you strength to keep confessing your freedom to keep confessing your healing to keep confessing your deliverance listen friends this message is not noise in the room when there's nothing else to play this message is vitamins amen that if you partake of them it'll put strength in your body to face another day the Bible is God's spiritual God for his church and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with Thanksgiving you water it and every Divine promise will produce exactly what God said it would do other place we thank you we have had our spiritual die Lord we thank you that the vitamin of the word grows sons of God it does not affect on any other type of character only on Sons and Daughters of God how many knows that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now when it comes to food I know amen I don't want to ask you to raise your hand but I know we amen you you like food we all love food everybody loves food right amen Jo been Al amen we all love food amen when it comes to food only s you really benefit from

the truth them ribs can smell real good out there on the barbecue and them steaks can smell real good on the grill amen but smelling them will never it'll never put any nutrients in your body it'll never put any meat on your bones but when you take them off the grill and you begin to partake of them and you begin to eat of them then something begins to react in your body and you begin to manifest what you're proten up listen friend I believe there's a BL here tonight who's not just eating something out of denomination she's not just eating CED and darkness am but she's feeding upon

heard about amen this message is not a commentary amen it's not a better idea this message is Heavenly Mana that rained out of Heaven into this Earth amen and it will not affect the Baptist it will not affect the Pentecostal amen but it will affect Sons and Daughters of God because it was sent to them the Bible says the house of Israel called the name thereof mana and it was like a corander seed

top of this the anti type amen the Holy Ghost takes like honey he said I seen the saints of God Amen so drunk upon it amen to they would lift their lips and say so good he said there's something about honey there's something about honey there's something about honey when it comes into a meeting and it begins to get all across the congregation there's something about the Revelation when the honey

honey amen there's something about it amen you know honey is a very powerful substance amen honey is a very powerful substance you know what honey has it has many healing properties in Psalms 119: 103 David said how sweeter the words unto my taste yay they are sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts I get understanding amen therefore I hate every false way I love what Psalm or proverb says in 24:13 brother Matt it says my son eat thou honey amen because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to that taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy Soul when thou has found it then there shall be a reward and the expect amen shall not be cut off listen y'all forgive me amen but I can't stop expecting things when I'm eating on something that is full of expectation I'm sorry I cannot come to church on Wednesday night and let some old devil of formalism Amen ding my expectations down to just a little Wednesday night service and a few songs and a little sermon in I think God can come in on the Wednesday night and can change a church we can change a situation list we're not in church we are the church and we ought to get back to Heaven church we ought to just get back to Heaven yall used to just have church we didn't tell who was seeing we didn't tell who was there who was we were just happy to be together one more time in the house of God lord I said bring back the Liberty Amen to have expectations we on just termin by preacher ANS to Christian ANS but give us the liberty to believe that Miss L can be restored on Wednesday night give us some Liberty to believe that day can come walk this listen I'm Fe on the food and my expectation will not be cut [Applause] off anybody agree with me I expect I know what that devil does that devil puts a lot of pressure on us and a lot of pressure on us and a lot of pressure on us and we fight all hell to get there on Wednesday night and when we finally get in brother B and we finally shut down you've been studying praying laboring got a word and then you got to spend 20 minutes Amen to get the expectation of the building you know why because we let the devil tell us amen that we can only have certain services at certain times well guess what you ain't got a politician up here you got a preacher I refuse to believe that Dev I refuse to believe that our young people sh and a you I refuse to believe that we can only have Liberty and the Holy Ghost when it took me I believe our churches can have Liberty I believe our young people can have I believe anywhere any any place the Holy Ghost show up we can have Liberty hallelujah hallelujah brother man is not justonight it's toight it's not just Sunday morning it's another time for the god of our expectation who we've been feing on to come in and manifest himself my expectation shall not brother C it shall not be cut off you what are you Fe on in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets that's Revelation 10:7 right amen don't just leave it in Christ Revelation 101 and the seventh angel Revelation 10:7 let's go on to verse 8 and the Bible says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him amen give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it amen my belly was bitter and he said to me th must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations remember said this seventh book of seven Redemption plans has been brought to us he said it's what the book holds he said now we're going to get over in the 10th chapter here where the mighty Angel proclaimed something he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did it got in his belly and it was bitter amen but in his lips it was sweet when he begin to partake in this book am me it was sweet in his mouth but when it hit his stomach it was bitter said now watch he said when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody's telling you you're a Holy Roller you're M out of the other Senor off your head it's hard to digest but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips and when you stand up in a meeting when you stand up in a meeting and say glory to God hallelujah he said when you're going through that great Siege it's hard but then when you're out of that great Siege you can testify of it amen because then it's sweet in the what is it church it's the book of redemption amen I love what the Bible says that David I'm going somewhere David had a script bag and in the script bag he had some rocks and on those rocks he put some honey on them and the prise said when the Sheep would get sick they would put honey on that rock it was a limestone Rock and those sick sheep would go to licking on that rock he said that's what we need to do tonight he said let's put this honey on Christ and not on some church either he said it'll go on where it belongs on and will'll lick on him Hallelujah he said they need healing if there's any virtue if there's any power if there's any praise it belongs to him that's right on Christ the solid rock I stand amen and The Rock played a great part in it too oh yeah so the Rock and the Honey played a great part together because in the Bible the rock represents the Revelation in the Bible the rock represents the Revelation and the Honey represents the holy goost that goes on the Rock oh my and the prophet said there's nothing as powerful as Revelation can I ask you something why is our young people such a powerful young people why are our churches such powerful churches I'll tell you why amen because they're feeding on a powerful Revelation and that Revelation is releasing a vitamin in them that's giving them a strength am me to be more than just a Christian Camp to be more than just a Christian in church but it's giving them a strength to be a Christian on their good days and on their bad days on their up days on their down days can I just make a declaration here I am a Son of God on my good days and I'm a Son of God on my bad days I'm a Son of God when I'm sick but I'm a Son of God when I'm well I'm a Son of God when I'm rich I'm a Son of God when I'm broke I'm a Son of God when things are going good and I'm a Son of God when things are falling back amen my sunship is not resting upon the condition of this Earth and world I have tasted of a Heavenly food I eat of a Heavenly Man I tasted the good word of God I'm feing upon the power of the world to come and it's releasing something in me that's causing me to walk by faith and not by sight it's causing me to trust God when I have every reason to doubt God it's a revelation it's a perfect Revelation where say oh my there is nothing in such prevailing power as the revelation of the word so when you begin to feed on this re this revelation will bring you amen from drifting to stability this revelation will bring you amen from going this way and that way to set I love what Paul says if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God Amen set your affection on things above and not on things on the earth for ye are dead amen Lord give us Grace we are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory said it's the time amen that we ought to be Heavenly set somebody say heavenly set we ought to be Heavenly set till the world seems dull and dingy and dirty another place you said we are preparing people amen we're getting them lighted unburned from the things of the world Amen getting their souls amen set in the presence of God that when Jesus does appear the second time in glory those who are ready will Rapture and be C up together to meet him in the air and be with him is't that beautiful we're getting the church unburdened L to get him ready for the Rapture I love the prophetic instructions he gives us in Israel and the church he said now be careful and you be s in the word the other place he said don't be tossed about with every wind of Doctrine you believe God's word you get stable and you get set and when you look at this word Heavenly that word Heavenly is relating to the heaven amen or the heavens amen Divine suggesting amen the Blessed state of Heaven do you all realize that Jesus in the prayer to the father he said these words he said father let thy kingdom come let thy will be done Amen on Earth as it is in heaven amen so in other words he was saying that there was a people who would not have to wait till they died and went to heaven to enjoy heaven but there would be a people on ins Side of Heaven that would be enjoying the Blessed Spate of Heaven and the only way they would be enjoying it amen was that God would send a prophet who would break the traditional view of heaven and would bring a revelation view of heaven and would say heaven is a place that's real he would say I believe it's not the place the churches talked about where the oldtime said we went to heaven and we played up on a harp and we set up clouds No they knew there was a place called Heaven amen but they didn't know what it was he said it isn't playing Harps he said said but what a conception that was amen before they had the fullness of the word come into existence or the opening of The Seven Seals amen that promised to us in this age amen then we would understand he says I believe that heaven is a real place can I get a witness here tonight that believes Heaven is a real place it's just the same as this real place amen where God started us in our spiritual growth in this place and I believe that heaven is a place that's just as real as this where we don't sit up there for eternity and just sit around on a cloud amen so Heaven is a real place and Paul said amen let us go on into Perfection amen then tell me what is perfection Heaven is perfection and Perfection is heaven so Paul was saying there's somebody who's going to break the cycle they're not just going to keep going for the Motions they're not just going to keep going to Services they're not just going to keep hearing sermons amen but they're literally going to grow they're going to progress come on church we we got to move on we cannot stay where we are we got to go forward are you hearing me we got to go forward it's hard for the time but we got to go forward because we cannot stay in the same place we'll drop up and die but we got to keep on moving forward so when we going to we're going to heaven heaven is a real place in the adoption series but I'm said like this he said your adoption is not your birth he said your adoption is your placing he said we were born the spirit of we were sons of God Amen we were predestinated he said for this son the last day we were predestinated unto adoption now here we are this hurts Pentecostal amen but they say I got born again praise the Lord God the Holy Ghost F you're a child of God but yet that ain't what I'm talking about amen see you were predestinated unto adoption amen and adoption is the placing of a son come on church because the prophet emphatically teaches amen that the believer's position in CHR is Heavenly places the believer's position in Christ is not in depression it's not in condemnation it's not in guilt it's not in fear it's not in anxiety come on now it's not just in a Pew on a Sunday morning but the believer's position is in Christ and that is in Heavenly places see then this bribe by an adoption message has been positionally placed in the heavenlies I love what the prop says in the countdown he said the position of the church should be plumbed into the heavenlies not down here floating around through the clouds and buzzing around like an airplane amen but something that's propelled by something that seem be on anything that an airplane can think of Amen it's an astronaut brother went hit it last night it's an astronaut in church we are not horse and buggy drivers we are not automobile drivers we are not airplane pilots come on Church we're astronauts and if we're astronauts we have no place in horse and buy we have no place in automobile we have no place in the airplane we got to climb up we got to climb up into our position and our position is an astronaut he said that's the age we're living in right now somebody say now we're living in right now is spiritual astronauts he said see live in the heavenlies not visit the heavenlies not just read about the heavenlies not just sing about the heavenli amen but live in the heavenli oh carry yourself away so you can see things that is to come which was which is and shall come amen lifting up above anything that the church has had since the day that Christ was on Earth are y'all hearing me this message Has Lifted the church above anything that the Earth has had since Christ was here on Earth and church it's time to change your identity it's time to change your identity can I say what your identity is it's not church it's not just an old sinner amen saved by grace but I I hit something some I well preach there we are all sinners amen saved by grace but I'll say this we should not live every day of our life talking about what a sinner we were and how horrible we were we have been saved by grace it's time to lay aside the condemnation it's time to lay aside it's time to go follow church it's time to go to it's to go CH if You' been out of it looking back at it thinking about it and talking about it it's time to go on under Perfection it's time to go to a perfect Faith it's time to believe a perfect word it's time to serve a perfect God we have called unto Perfection we're spiritual astronauts in the astronaut age amen positionally somebody say positionally positionally placed in the heavenly oh my by the Holy Ghost itself you don't know what I'm talking about horse and buggy automobile airplane astronaut I'm talking about the life that was in the husk is in the stalk is in the tassel is in the husk it all gathers in the seed so the power that was in the horse and buggy came over into the automobile and brother Nathaniel the power that was in the automobile came over into the airplane and the power that was in the airplane has come over into the as in other words it's not less power amen but all the power that was in all the power that was in justification was poured into sanctification and all the power that was in sanctification was poured into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all that was in the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been poured into the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection God have mercy to come right down in Perfection amen back to the word again to manifest itself can I just goe and say it ye are perfect but I'm going to say it again ye are perfect but I'm going to say it again ye are perfect I'm going to say it again brother man ye are perfect say no no you got to wait no I don't have to wait ye are perfect how can you say that because your draw a perfect word and if we are following the perfect word then the word has come into our flesh in Perfection he says that's the first thing amen spiritual astronauts have astronaut Faith he said to believe that God is here to do what he promised to do he said see we've gone beyond just speaking with tongues we've gone beyond these little things we're in a place now where we got to have astronaut Faith that's astronaut power to realize that we're in Christ already oh Mercy we're in Christ already just more of Christ see to lift us up in the Heavenly places then what is the faith of this hour it's astronaut Faith the faith of this hour he said it's going to take more faith than ever was any age for this has to be a rapturing faith to be taken up listen horse and buy faith will not get you out of this age I don't know Bill faith will not get you in a Rapture come on now airplane faith will not get you Rapture the only thing that will get you in a Rapture is astronaut Faith it's astronaut Faith amen defy you off of this Earth to meet Jesus he said you don't want to be left here asleeping virgin then you better get in the astronut right now and get up above these things amen it's hard people to understand he said but one of his final and latest achievements is to manifest himself and say he that believeth in me amen The Works that I do shall he do also The Works that I do shall he do also he said what is it it is spiritual manifestations of spiritual word becoming literally fulfilled before us it is literally being fulfilled Church of the Living God can you open your eyes and say that's what happened in this T is the word of God that's been prophesied been read about been preached about then sung about they fall about come on your eyes are be holding the leral Fulfillment come on word of God that's going to pull you off of this Earth someday where we at he said we're way up undering the Heavenly he said where Christ becomes the full thing that takes completely over and lives his life acts through you exactly like he did here on Earth it's the astronaut age the countdown his own brother the countdown his own brother re though the countdown is on he said I know we're ready for God's great achievement what is is achievement to leave this earth but the mest next achievement is to take a people off of this Earth are you all hearing me this Earth is not where you're just going to have to St under Earthly influences under Earthly sicknesses amen but there oh God there is a Heavenly word and there is a Heavenly power and there is a Heavenly food and there is a Heavenly gift there is a Heavenly anointing Amen in God's church has gone from airplane from horseback and is leaving in an astronaut to another world Amen which is heaven another world which is heaven somebody say another world which is heaven we're going to heaven I said we're going to heaven I said we're going to heaven said you're not too late God say we're going to heaven church we going there we going to go it's a real place it's a real place to go I know some you may think that all your thoughts and failures is going to keep you out of it amen but there's a Heavenly food there's a voice of the son angel that is screaming out in this hands brother God let us go on with protection let us go on Brother David let us lay aside all this thing and let us go forward now church if you're going to go forward you got to get Earth you got to get less Earthly and more Heavenly you got to get less Earthly and more Heavenly said people become so Earthbound amen just like this was the only place there was but there's a Heavenly world it's all around us too do you realize in Ephesians one what Paul's is okay to preach what Paul was doing in Ephesians 1 he said it like this he said to move from Earthbound Corinthians to heavenbound Ephesians do you realize we are not promised another Corinthians we are promised another Ephesians we are not promised another Corinthians we are promised another Ephesians in other words the Corinthians were Earthbound because they were living by Vision they were living by song they were living by a dream somebody was out praying and they saw something in the air and they come to church and that become the direction so Paul never could bring them to a Heavenly manner because they were too Earthbound so what he done was he come to Ephesians and begin to teach him predestination he begin to teach him election he begin to teach him inheritance he begin to teach him things amen that would so the Corinthians would feed the Ephesians that I'm talking about a message it choke the Baptist it choke the P around this but to the and daugh of [Applause] Fe listen I think it's time to move I think it's time to move I think it's time to move from where life was from where life is move from where life was brother bur into where life is if you stay where life was you're going to die if you stay where God was you're going to die but let us go [Applause] on you realize to move forward you're going to be an oddball you're literally going to be an oddball to move forward until everybody accepts it come on until everybody accepts it you're going to be odd then when everybody y'all remember cell phones years ago funniest thing somebody carry a cell phone well they're just trying to be something they're just odd they're just they just got they just got too big for their bres they just think there's something important now cuz they're carrying a cell phone and so somebody had to step out and they had to Bear the reproach of carrying something that the majority was not accepting but there was a power behind it can I just take some Liberty here and say thank God for our elders around this message who advaned to where life was instead of staying where life was they Advanced and they had to step up and you give me some but I want to say this publicly I want to say thank God for our Ed bll amen he stepped out and begin to say there's more to this thing than just sitting around a campire talking about stories and God Prophet but this is the reveal this is the resurrection of the that's crucified has come our thank God for our elders who on our foods and they Mar through ideas and they Mar through criticism to preach us a message come on church I say thank God for I'm going to bring it right in this P they fought all hell young people to get this message to you and don't you let some devil water this message down to just a bunch of scaming har and I believe in all of it that this message is the call of the that Jesus Christ he is the election of God there's more to this thing life was where come on some Harley talking last night amen 60 years ago amen life was God said a prophet God sent a prophet thank you for sharing those things with me last night God sent a prophet but now where life is is you are what the prophet was sent for so either we stay back here talking about hun stories and brother so and so and brother so and so step forward and go on into Perfection either we stay back there and eat dead stories or we start eating the Heavenly manner it'll take us to Perfection you better get out of all those stories we thank God form but that's not the vision for the bride the vision for the bride is thus saith the seventh angel yes sir Andrew what are you saying you all know I'm telling the truth it was odd till it was accepted but when it was accepted everybody wanted a part of it come on 10 years ago 15 years ago get out somewhere and be lost and get your phone out get on your GPS find where you're at and somebody that was still stuck with life was pulled their Atlas out and flipp through the atlas and you was in Alabama and they was in Arkansas why it worked in it day but now we've Advanced all right come on church that's why we're no longer having meetings that we're having to work five services to finally get a breakthrough on the 6 nights because there's a word that has come into the church and it's a word of perfection it's not a de letter it's not a bunch of de work it's not beat the altar it's believing that you're in Christ already it's believing that if you ever was a Son of God you always was a Son of God it's believe that you're not going to become one you always were one you got to move out of the Earthly into the Heavenly things father God said like this he said move out there that we might see somebody say see the invisible God I think that's amazing cuz it almost sounds like a contradicting statement see the invisible I God he said the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible and through his sacrificial death at Calvary his resurrection he positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible let us go on under Perfection let us go on into that realm where the invisible God comes into the individual and makes his word visible ver said what is that Holy Spirit then it's the isap it's the spiritual revelation of the word the Holy Ghost itself but how many can agree with me that this is where're right the Holy Ghost itself amen not just a baptism but the person the Holy Ghost itself now listen there's been some awful cool dras for says that's come through these cracked walls he said like I was a kid mama would take that Kung to get the matter out of her eyes he said listen I'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen shut and she's blind to what God has for her she needs some hot oil the spirit of God unless she receives the spirit of God she will go on Su program for power and Creed for word he said receive the Holy Spirit and let him do the explaining he wrote the book he can tell you what's in it and what it means you know what I believe I believe that this bride joh has been anointed and her heart has been anointed to believe you know what I believe church I believe that I'm I'm I'm turn the corner now if if the position of the church is plum in the heavenlies then I believe it's time to explore the heavenlies test it still working if the position of the church is Plumb in the heavenlies then don't you think it's time to to explore the heavens don't you think we got the Earthly explored enough come on church that word explore means to travel in or through it means an unfamiliar country or area in order to learn about or familiarize oneself with it it is to search for resources to inquire into or discuss the subject or issue it means to detail to examine to evaluate amen now watch this an option or a possibility do you realize there is more than a possibility for you to take a Rapture there is more than a possibility for you to be standing some morning in your bathroom combing your hair and loved ones appear behind you God time the food you've been feeding on is Heavenly Mana that is igniting something in your soul to believe that you can see your dead loved ones right here my brother andw how how are we going to go forward how many wants to go forward amen we want to go forward how are we going to do it he said listen God the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backward he's going forward into the word amen and believing the promises for things that has never come yet for the spiritual Revelations to manifest amen the spiritual things that God has promised watch what the prophet says he says and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication we do have somebody say we do have we're not waiting for it we're not looking for it we do have it so if we have it we ought to get acquainted with it and the way we get acquainted with it is we taste it and the way we taste it is we quit looking at it we quit smelling it we become a partaker of it and we begin to feed on it and the promise said get acquainted with the Heavenly things of that spirit that comes down from heaven where Holiness stands Where Angels of God stand where Jesus Christ stands at the right hand of God in majesty and glory and Holiness and power he said listen Jesus prayed for this church that they would not be of the world they are not of the world if you're a Christian your spirit is from aair so it makes you live holy want to be holy want to act like Christ act like God your whole desire is on heaven and not of the world your whole desire is on heaven and not of the world then what happens is amen is you're trapped amen we're trapped right now the prophet of God says in this old pest house in this Tabernacle of humiliation amen and these all Mortal decaying corrupt bodies we're trapped in them amen but there's a Perfection it's in a sermon called f are to me there's a Perfection that is calling out to us and listen the the pool of perfection amen is greater than the pool of your imperfection are you hearing me the pool of perfection is greater than the pull of your imperfection listen the devil right now is trying to hold some of your minds in this service he's trying to say well you know what I did I let you WI loose and I let you Thursday night loose and I even let you loose last night to get up there and believe that God really was here to do something for you amen but what about Monday morning what about Tuesday morning what about when you go back to school and your friends are there what about when you go back to work and your buddies are there what about that when I tell that devil one about it it's over it's over listen devil we cannot go back to something it's not there to go back to come on cannot go back to something that's not there to go back to and if there's nothing to go back to brother Caleb we can only go forward and the only place to go is heaven so it's time to put your walking shoes on it's time to start familiarize and yourself with the message of the hour and say this it's your exit it's your way out of here it's your estate the walls are coming down the end is here but there is a bride who has been elected to escape she's been elected to escape now watch this she's been elected by grace to escape what is coming up on the earth he said the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride then listen God has made a way of Escape amen for all those who desire to follow that way it's the mercies of him amen making a way do you realize the mercy of God has made a way way for you to escape the wrath of God that is coming upon the Earth in Luke 21 the Bible says that she shall be accounted worthy to escape amen the Wrath that is coming upon this Earth I love what the prophet says he said and knowest time amen they seen the word being erected to float he said the word being put together for it to be transformed amen from the ground to the skies the word was put together somebody say put together the word was put together to transform amen them that was in the uian age from the Earth to the skies he said that structure was made of the word he said same as in this time amen Noah's seed word erected a floating transformation from Earth to the sky it sounded crazy to the people to have a little cult like Noah had and he told them thus says the Lord amen rain is coming amen but listen Church there was a time brother B and they worked on the ark there was a time that Noah built the ark there was a time that Noah put the door he put the pitch he put the go for wood there was a time Noah built the ark and then there was a time that the ark was finished there was a time that the ark was finished and you quit looking at it you quit walking around it you quit saying wow what an arc wow this is amazing am if you was going to escape what was coming up on the earth you had to quit walking around it you had to quit looking at it you had to quit thinking about it you get it you had to get it you had to do more than just say no was a good preacher you have to do more than just say that no one not be right but you have to tie you had to untie yourself am from all the Earthly connections and you have to step into the ark come on church that Ark was an exit it was an exit are you hearing me it was a compound Ark that Ark was an exit the rain was coming the floods were going to Dr it the W was at its hand things are coming to and if you're going to escape it you better get in this heart if you're going to overcome it you
