about you this morning but I say Lord take every door in my heart this morning and walk in there and declare yourself as the Risen Lord amen of my life how many wants that this morning let's just bow our hearts together today for a word of prayer as we open the word this morning let's invite the Lord to come and amen maybe you just say Lord send the spirit of Revelation into the B building today and unfold the word as I have need of it in my life Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Resurrection Sunday father I know the world is not considering this day as Easter but Lord your Prophet has taught us that to the believer every day is Easter and Lord as we come here this morning we're standing here Lord shoulder toosh shoulder Believers of like Precious Faith father we're not coming out of form or fashion Lord not out of ritual or tradition oh God but Lord we're coming because there is a deep calling to the deep and Lord your Prophet has told us that before there was a deep call there was a deep to answer and Lord this morning as we come here today Father we're Desiring more of you I don't believe there's one here this morning today father that could say they don't want more of you more of your word more of your power more of your reality but Lord we're so thankful this morning to know that if there is a desire in our hearts for more of you then that means there's more of you for us to receive so father may you come in this building today and may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit may you just bring a piece of your word upon the lives of your children here father I pray for those that are maybe suffering in their bodies today Father maybe some of them even push Beyond it to even be in this meeting this morning I pray dear God that your anointing would deliver the sufferer from the suffering Lord father for those that are home Listen by the way of streaming different places Lord May the angels of God visit them in their homes and wh they will hear this father Lord may you Minister directly to their needs I pray father we commit this meeting in th faithful hands have your way among us today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we do pray and all the Believers says amen and amen you love the Lord today amen God Rich you bless you if you have your Bibles this morning while you're standing with us we want to turn in the Book of Romans the 10th chapter and then we have a couple of places also we would like to read but we want to say God bless you all this morning morning we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we bring the greetings from our pastor in the church there at home brother Sean Martin sends their greetings to you this morning and amen just a wonderful time to serve the Lord amen amen I believe I could ask you this morning if you've been fighting the devil and I guarantee everybody in here could say yes amen but one thing I like about it brother Joe we're not just fighting the devil but we're winning amen so we thank the Lord for the victory today and sure want to say we appreciate brother Matt the opportunity once again to be here and to stand in the pull pit and we just pray something will be said to bless you and help you today but we want to look here in Romans the 10th chapter and in the 17th verse um just one scripture here and then we're going to turn to the Book of Luke but Romans 10 and verse 17 Paul here writing says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now I've been speaking a little bit on this for some time but I did find a very powerful thing that brother Bram tells about this here he he says hearing by the word of God he said or the word made manifest so we're not just hearing the word but we're actually hearing the manifested word and our faith is coming from hearing the word of God made manifest now in the book of St Luke the first chapter the book of St Luke the first chapter and I want to look there in the 26th verse I know this is a very familiar reading to you it's quite lengthy but I just want to if I can to rehearse to you the conversation between a between the Angel and Mary in Luke 1 and verse 26 the Bible said in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth now I want you to specifically note this Angel was sent from God unto a city in the 27th verse to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came into her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be now watch this and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end so he's given some very specific details concerning this prophecy and in the 34th verse he said then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man so there's a great mystery how shall this be seeing I know not a man but the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow Shadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth sheath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her now I also want to look at one other place and that's in the book of Acts the 2 7th chapter the book of Acts the 27th chapter and here in Acts 27 Paul is speaking of the vision that's been given to him concerning the future and he says there in Acts 27 and verse number 25 he says wherefore s be of good cheer for I believe God how many can put your name there and say I believe God for I believe God now this is what I love that it shall be even as it was told me it shall be even as it was told me we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning amen I want to by the help of the Lord from those scriptures for just a few moments if I could to speak to you here I want to speak to you on Faith's power to believe amen Faith's power to believe and maybe uh just to take something out of that it shall be even as it was told me amen it shall be even as it was told told me 1958 brother BR preaches a message have faith in God and he refers to acts the first chapter in the 8th verse and he says now remember you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you not before or when you get your PhD or whatever but after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you'll have power of Faith to believe amen after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you will have the power of Faith to believe now in Romans 10 and verse1 17 from the the Amplified Bible it says so faith comes from hearing what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message concerning Christ amen faith comes from hearing what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message concerning Christ and I believe we can all say this morning that we emphatically believe that this message is Jesus Christ we don't believe it's about a man or about a church or about anything outside amen of the Lord Jesus Christ again acts 27:25 in the Amplified Bible it says so keep up your courage men for I believe God and have complete confidence in him that it will turn out exactly as I have been told amen I believe God and have complete confidence in him amen that it will turn out exactly as I have been told amen I believe this morning that we are believers here and I believe that we can say I believe God and I have complete confidence amen that whatever has been told me is going to turn out amen exactly the way it has been told in the message it shall be even as it was told me 1950 he said oh don't you just love that it'll be as it was told me if the angel truly comes from God and is sent from God it's bound to be it's a direct message from Glory if the angel comes from God and speaks anything from God it will be exactly the way it was spoken it's bound to be that way if it came from God another place in Jehovah of Miracles she looked speaking of Mary she looked at this great Angel and his name is Gabriel now there's angels of the Lord there's many of them and they come to the Earth amen and they bring messages but Gabriel when he comes amen there is something major going to happen see he was the one who announced the first coming of Christ he'll be the one that'll announce the second coming of Christ amen I love how brother BR says this and he told Mary Gabriel told told Mary that thou H has found favor with God he said now what a message to bring her thou H has found favor with God so he was not just bringing her amen some words or something that he thought she might like to hear but he was bringing her a message amen and it was coming from heaven so that was making it a Heavenly message and it was a vision concerning her life amen so it was making it a heavenly vision and it was an announcement to her Mary thou Hast found favor with God now we believe in this generation that God Amen has sent a prophet among the church and he has come here amen not of his own accord or on the Accord of the Pope or on the Accord of the bishop amen but he said it like this he said I have no power within myself to do anything amen I'm just a man I'm unlearned I'm uneducated amen but I am sure that my testimony is Right amen that truly a supernatural being came to me and made these statements and I have not been disobedient Amen to the heavenly vision so here's a prophet saying amen that just as there was a Heavenly being came to Mary and gave her a message and announced to her amen and there was a messenger came to Paul and told Paul amen by way of vision you're going to be Shipwrecked and you're going to go through troubles amen but Paul you're going to stand on the other side amen that same angel that same supernatural being amen came to a prophet in this generation and said now if you can just get the people to believe you amen nothing will stand before your prayer amen I don't know about you this morning but I say thank God Amen that we have received a message amen not from a natural God Amen but from a supernatural God and I can say this morning that we are believers Amen in the Supernatural how many Believers here do I have Amen in the Supernatural now that word Supernatural is of or relating to an order of existence beyond the visible amen observable universe it is departing from what is usual or normal amen especially so as to peer Amen to transcend the laws of nature it is attributed to an invisible agent amen such as a ghost or a spirit amen now you read your Bible and see that the Holy Ghost is referred to amen as the Holy Ghost as well as the holy spirit amen so I believe that he is God's invisible agent amen that is in the church that is among the people amen and he's doing things beyond the nature he's doing things beyond the ideas of trinitarian Doctrine doing things beyond the ideas of denomination amen he's come Among Us declaring himself Amen in the Supernatural brother said the Mighty Man of Valor could refer back to the old word and know that it's right amen because he know this that God is a supernatural being how many believes that amen and wherever a supernatural being is amen he will do Supernatural signs because the Supernatural is in him amen wherever a supernatural being is amen he will do Supernatural signs amen because the Supernatural is in him you just can't get out of it how can you stand in the face of wind without having wind blow it how can you get in water without being wet water's wet that's the chemical of it it's wet and when you get in water you're going to get wet right and when you get in the presence of God the supernatural there's going to be Supernatural signs amen and Supernatural workings of Amen a supernatural God Amen don't you let the devil reduce your services down Amen to just Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings and a few songs and a few quotes and a few scriptures amen no there's more to this amen amen this is a manifestation of the supernatural God that has come into this generation to declare amen that there's a power in you amen and it's a power beyond any other power it's a power beyond your education it's a power beyond your family's ability it's a power beyond your past it's a power beyond your present amen can I say where this power is coming from it is coming from the spirit of Truth who has already been in your future let me say it to you Church you're not a natural Church Grace Tabernacle you are a supernatural church because there's a supernatural being that has come into your midst and you didn't push him off in the corner amen but you recognize that that's the god of Abraham that's the god of Jacob that's the god of Israel and that's my God if he is my God then what he did through them he will do through me everywhere God is the supernatural takes place because he is Supernatural and then I'll say this if he's a supernatural God then he has a supernatural seed and the prophet said these great Heroes died he said there's one thing they had to die amen because they were natural seed amen so natural seed has to die he said oh but one day there come a supernatural seed which was born by a super natural birth amen the same Faith born not by the natural birth but by the supernatural Birth by the supernatural Faith which Abraham had amen not according to the sexual desire of Abraham and what God did to him that way amen but through a supernatural Faith amen that he had amen if we're serving a supernatural God it's going to take more than natural Faith Amen to believe the things he spoken he is able to bring to pass amen but if he's a Supernatural God then he's released a supernatural faith and the prophet said the supernatural faith is Supernatural amen and it does Supernatural things amen let me say this you may not agree with me but I'm going to say it anyhow amen just you being here this morning is Supernatural amen just you having a desire Amen to believe the word that God has revealed in this age amen that's more than just luck that's more than just a chance amen that's a supernatural thing amen that God loved you enough that he brought you out of the natural birth and prepared a supernatural birth to break the bars of humanity over your life that you could receive a supernatural message amen the prophet said Abraham's Faith as he was here hundreds of years later amen come the supernatural seed that he believed in and when this Supernatural seed come on the earth he done the supernatural sign of a supernatural prophet he was greater than a prophet amen he was a god Prophet Amen to give a n natural people a supernatural birth is this okay he was a god Prophet to give the natural people a supernatural birth what did he do he went before us amen and he died but they couldn't hold him amen Abraham's grave is still there Isaac's grave is still there but there's an empty tomb Amen on the supernatural seed that done a supernatural work that had a supernatural Resurrection friends this morning recognize amen there's nothing that you go through amen can hold told you you know why because there's a supernatural god with a supernatural word with a supernatural Faith with a supernatural seed that has moved inside of you and has made you a super sign to this generation then that's why ever grave the devil tried to bury you in you're alive this morning amen because you are a part of a supernatural resurrection and if God be for you then who can be against you brother said what did he do when doing it he conquered death Hell In The Grave I'm going somewhere and possessed its Gates and Rose on the third day in a supernatural Resurrection now here's what he said I have the keys of death and hell I was he who was dead and now I'm alive forever more and because I live the Seed of Abraham shall live also there you are and lo I'm with you always even until the end and the works that I do shall you do also he said now remember Isaiah said it shall be an everlasting sign hereo he said some of you people that don't know about it you think he's a historical God or worshiping something that was way back y a long time ago but that same God Amen raised from the dead as a supernatural sign and after 2,000 years is still living right here now and can work miracles like he did when he was here on Earth amen through a supernatural people that has been born to a supernatural spirit with a supernatural Faith amen that the same thing Abraham had am amen the same thing Abraham had so I'll say this morning church that we are the possessors amen of the same Supernatural faith that Abraham had we are the supernatural people we are the possessors of that Faith seed he said then if we are God's children by Heir amen then we're Heirs of the kingdom and we're Heirs of Abraham then we should walk as our Father Abraham walked and we should call those things which are not amen as though they were if God is said they were see if God has said they are then we don't know how it's going to be amen but God said so so we just believe it and move forward amen walking by faith amen what a beautiful life see Abraham a 100 years old yet he had many disappointments he had many upsets like all Christians do amen while he was waiting on the promise but the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God Amen through unbelief amen there's many things taking place amen famine distress things happen amen but Abraham didn't stagger he still believed that God was going to give him the baby amen then can I ask you where did the faith come from Amen to believe in the face of disappointments in the face of adversity in the face of hard days and bad days amen where was the faith coming from Amen to believe it was coming from the vision amen that was given to him and Abraham didn't put his confidence in the womb of Sarah he didn't put his confidence in the life of his own human ity he put his confidence in that what God has said amen shall be exactly as it was told me listen friends we have received a word amen and it's a word seed and if you don't sew it and let it stay there and let the atmosphere produce the life of it if you keep digging it up every day well I don't know I don't know I don't know brother said if you dig it up every day it's never going to grow he said but put it in the ground amen and leave it in the ground and let the life of the sun and the water bring it to potential he said I say this with a challenge in faith that every promise of God will be brought to pass if you take the right mental attitude towards it is that okay amen you can't go dig up the weed every day and expect weed at Harvest Time you can't go dig up the potatoes every day and expect potatoes at Harvest time are you hearing me amen when the word has been sold you've got to receive the power of Faith Amen to believe the god that sent the word the god that spoke the word the god that revealed the word amen is God enough to bring that word to pass amen and don't walk in defeat amen don't walk in complexes don't walk in inferiority amen but walk as Abraham walked amen and call things that are as though they're not and things that are not as though they are come on church amen you're not a natural people you are a supernatural people with a supernatural god with a supernatural Faith amen and God has sent a supernatural Prophet into this generation to teach the church amen what faith is amen and what Faith's power is now you all know these verses by heart but Hebrews 11:1 Paul said that faith is the substance amen of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen he said for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand I'm going somewhere through faith we understand amen that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen now watch a prophet what is faith brother says is God by the spirit yes sir revealing to you something that he's going to do or he has promised to do see then you see you hear the word and God reveals it to you that it is the truth and by Spirit revealed truth he confirms your faith to God Amen then that's the church that God built upon the rock upon the gates amen that hail cannot Prevail against it amen another place he said face power amen brings to pass God's revealed Revelation amen so God by the spirit reveals the word and you receive the revealed word amen then you believe that the God who spoke it and revealed it has the ability to bring it to pass amen and that unlocks the power of Faith Amen to believe that God's revealed Revelation is going to come into manifestation in other words faith is a revelation from God brother said where does faith come from he he said Revelation comes from above he said now people try to figure out the godhead they try to figure out water baptism he said scratch their head and pull their hair out he said don't scratch your head and don't pull your hair out he said just look up he said because Revelation comes from above and church this morning I'm going to preach on that amen we need to get our head out of all our problems get our head out of all our situation amen we need to do what the Bible said we need to look under the heels from which cometh our help amen our help comes from God and our help is not coming in the form of a denomination amen but our help is coming in the form of a spiritual Revelation because that's the only thing that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the Gates of Hell will prevail against your feelings they will prevail against your emotions they will prevail against the gifts they will prevail against sensation amen but when Revelation stands up and speaks with a voice of authority amen then revelation will prevail over every devil over every situation listen I tell you what we need more than anything is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to our lives that nothing can shake us from it you know what I'm talking about amen and that's what faith is it's a revelation from God Amen faith is something that's revealed to you glory to God Amen that is not yet amen but you believe it will be faith is something that's revealed to you that's not yet but you believe it will be see faith is a revelation of the will of God now how many can agree it's God's will to save you how many can agree it's God's will to heal you how many can agree it's God's will to deliver you three of you can how many of you can agree that it's God's will to Rapture you how many of you can agree it's God's will to give you all things amen see that's the word of God Amen now you can't just read it amen but somewhere that that that reading has got to turn to Revelation and you begin to walk by Revelation it's God's will to save my babies it's God's will to save my family it's God's will to heal my body it's God's will to take me in a Rapture it's God's will to deliver me come on Amen when you start living by Revelation you'll have a lot better Services when you start living by Revelation you'll have a lot better prayer time amen when you're not down there before God as some poor beggarly person that's trying to beg God for something but your eyes of understanding has come open Amen to realize that you are in the lineage of Abraham and you are air to the same faith that caused Abraham to look at things that were and call them as though they were not and things that were not as though they were because of faith is a revelation of the will of God another place he said it's a revelation see he has revealed it to you by his grace he has revealed it to you amen by his grace it's nothing you did amen I might as well preach on that point it's nothing you did you did not work yourself up into faith if you ever have faith it's been given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you amen therefore faith is a revelation we will not work our way into faith we will not pray our way into faith we will not fast our way into Faith amen if you got any faith in your life this morning it is a gift from God through the grace of God brother said in an audience of people when a prayer line comes he said you'll find some they're all good people will say he said but there's some amen that's trying real hard to believe it they're trying to work themselves into it and then someone just can't do it at all see he said but then there's others and it's just by Grace it's just given to them see now there is the difference see amen that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first when the word of God is revealed and takes preeminence in your life amen that's the real Revelation that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against amen I want to put this on record this morning and say Amen to the bride the Rapture is a revelation we're not here trying to get rapturing works this morning we're not here polishing up our rapturing works we are here looking amen for more rapturing faith and more rapturing grace amen that's the only way you're going to take a Rapture amen it's by the faith of God through the grace of God Amen the prophet of God said the rap is a revelation he said and faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that you could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so in other words you can look at every devil and says you're not going in a Rapture and say I've already made it you can look at every line vanity that says I cannot overcome Leota and you can say I've already overcome it you can look at every negative spirit and says you're to this and you're to that and say no if caught before me amen then you can gather all the negative Spirits Out of Hell against me amen but with this Revelation I will prevail over amen the gates of hell with this Revelation I will take a Rapture with this Revelation I will be a serpent Bruiser with this Revelation I will fulfill the word concerning my life and there won't be enough devils in Hell Amen to stop this Revelation from prevailing over in situations now brother said it very beautiful he said denomination don't even believe in spiritual Revelation he said no they don't he said but the true church I believe I'm preaching that true church but the true church Amen brother Morgan is built upon a spiritual Revelation he said the whole entire body amen of Jesus Christ amen is built on the spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ amen now pray tell me who is Jesus Christ he is the head of this body so the whole body amen is built upon the foundation of headship and that headship is not a man it's not an idea it's not a Creed Dogma or ritual amen the headship is Christ the word you all know this story very well amen but in Matthew 16 the Bible said that Jesus comes in brother mat into the coast of cesaria Philippi and he walks among the disciples and he asked him a question he said who do men say that I the son of man am amen and they begin to speak up and Brother David Paul one said you're Elias and one said you're jeremias and one said you're one of the prophets amen but he said listen I didn't come here Amen to get a collective Revelation amen I come here to hear to who do you individually say I am amen now this is what amazes me out of all the disciples that was there amen out of all the ones that could have spoke up brother Wesley the one that spoke up with Simon Peter and let me just go ahead and say it Simon Peter didn't have a good record behind him amen he was a he was a God denier right amen he was a cursing preacher amen one day he lost his temper to can sort out and cut a man's ear off amen and God had to put the ear back on to save Peter from The Penalty amen Peter didn't have a lot going for him in the sense of the world Amen but what I love about it out of everybody that could have spoke amen God chose Peter to say these words amen but Thou Art the Christ amen the son of the Living God now I'm not going to ask you this to raise your hand but we all got a lot of mistakes in here we all make mistakes every day amen but can I say what I love about this amen is Peter's Revelation was greater than all of his mistakes all of his mistakes all of his failures all the things he done all the things he said amen but when it come time Amen brother Randall for somebody to identify who that was in flesh amen God chose Peter and he said Thou Art the Christ amen the son of the Living God can I say what I believe I believe your mistakes don't have enough power to rob you of spiritual revelation I think if you would put them mistakes on notice this morning and say I've got mistakes I've got failures I got things I don't like about myself amen but greater than all my mistakes and greater than all my failures is a revelation that is taken preeminence in my soul and no matter how low I get no matter how down I get no matter how sick I get I can still testify in the weakest of situation in the darkest of hours that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and the prophet of God said Jesus turn and said Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock glory to God Upon This Rock I will build my church amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I love that word Prevail it means to be strong to another's detriment it means to Prevail against it means to be superior in strength come on Church cuz some of y'all's giving the Gates of Hell more strength than they really got the Bible said you will not be inferior you will be superior the Bible said they will not overcome you but you will overcome them see but what is that rock he said it's the spiritual revealed revelation of the word of God brother said down for the ages we've had Creeds and denominations and what more but the Church of the Living God moves just the same it's in the minority I know that amen but someday it will be in the majority when the redeemed of all ages Rises to go with her to meet Jesus it's the Church of the Living God now can I say this to you Revelation is more powerful than you realize Revelation is more amen how can I say this amen it's more needful than you realize cuz I know some people get in their mind we just need the Bible we just need the Bible amen but let me say this we had the Bible for hundreds and thousands of years years and when a Prophet come on the scene they were still getting it wrong but when brother brandham took the Bible and begin to preach it under the inspiration of the pillar of fire he begin to make a declaration amen that the same Pillar of Fire that was here while the Bible was being wrote is the same Pillar of Fire that's here while the Bible is being interpreted Amen in other words I'm not bringing you another Bible I'm not bringing you another scripture I'm not bringing you another book that they found Amen in the Lost Books of the bble he was saying I'm bringing you the revelation of what's been laying in this word for years and if you can accept this Revelation it'll be a door of escape to you in the situations of your life tells something very beautiful he says a Baptist Minister called me and said brother BR I want to straighten you out on the godhead I had left my subject I'm going somewhere amen I want to straighten you out on the godhead he said this Baptist believe there is one God and three persons I said sir repeat that again he said one God and three persons I said where did you go to school at he said well I went to a Bible school I said I can believe that I said now let me ask you this amen you cannot be a person without being a personality and if you are a personality you are one personality to yourself amen you are are a separate individual being he said well the theologians can't even explain that I said it's by Revelation amen the theologians can't explain that amen and the reason why is because it's by Revelation now listen to these words words and he said I cannot accept Revelation I cannot accept Revelation I said then there's no way for God to ever get to you because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent amen and is revealed to babes amen such as will learn accept it amen there's no way for God to get to you amen you close yourself off to him so the very day that you get in a place that you cannot accept Revelation is the very day you slam the door in God's face and God can't get to you amen because the only way he can get to you is through the channel of Revelation he said the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there is no other way to know God Only by Revelation to whom the son will reveal him amen Revelation he says amen everything is revelation amen can I say this what he said he said not to accept Revelation then you're a cold Theologian and there is there's no hope for you if you cannot accept Revelation you become a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you now I'm here so I'm going to go ahead and say it if that's okay we get in our mind that the only place there's called theologians is on the platform behind the pull pit amen but I've preached some more theologians in the pews than I have in the pull pits because they've got their own Direction they got their own mind made up they got their own Vindication amen and they're literally sitting there and God is knocking on the door trying to get to but their theology has slammed the door in his face and they will not accept Revelation let me say this what we need is not amen a new church we don't need another preacher we don't need another direction we need the spirit of the Living God Amen to come in the church in the fire and dynamics of the Holy Ghost and tear down every icicle tear down every stronghold and bring a fresh Revelation back in the church amen I'm going to tell you why I believe in Revelation amen sister Vanna because Revelation brings hope amen Revelation brings hope in lives education puts it out amen ideas put it out amen but when Revelation comes in the building amen you can be preaching in the tightest of tight atmospheres you can be in the coldest of cold services but if Revelation comes in and begins to knock on somebody's heart and they open up the door and Jesus Christ the god of that Revelation steps in their heart amen they'll receive a fresh drink of water they'll receive a bread they'll receive a strength Hallelujah I am a firm believer that Revelation brings hope sir Revelation brings hope in the darkest of hours Revelation brings hope in the confusing moments Revelation brings hope when you don't know which way to turn Revelation brings hope are you hearing me Revelation in the service will bring hope Revelation in a song will bring hope Revelation in a sermon will bring hope are y'all hearing me you don't believe me just get in the valley amen I see some of our elders back there amen waving their hands cuz they've been there they've been in The Valleys they've been in the storms they've been in the situations and the only reason they're still here today is because there was a revelation on the inside of their soul that they knew there was something more than what they were seeing and what they were hearing and what they were facing they knew there was more to this message than a bunch of this that and the other they knew there was more to this than just some man's opinion opinion they knew there was a supernatural God who had come down in this generation with a vision concerning their life and they were willing to persevere through the bad days good days up days down days because why they had a revelation now the problem of God said it very beautiful he said if you don't believe in Revelation look at Matthew 15:14 he said Jesus spoke to the Pharisees and said let them alone they be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind lead the blind blind then they both shall fall into the ditch that word blind actually means mentally blind I said why were these Pharisees blind he said what made them so blind is because they would not accept Revelation they would not accept Revelation amen or Vindication of the word now let me say this I believe that the message of the hour has revealed Jesus Christ I believe the message of the hour has revealed Jes Jesus Christ in plain view according to Romans 16:25 Paul says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began amen but now is made manifest so at one time this Revelation was secret but brother Wesley today it's now made manifest and here is this Revelation by the scriptures of the prophet according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God and is made known to All Nations amen for The Obedience of Faith amen so when this Revelation is released it's going to bring a faith in the church but it's going to bring an obedience to that faith in other words this Revelation is going to cause you to obey Faith rather than feelings this Revelation is going to cause you to obey the word amen rather than some man-made interpretation this Revelation is going to cause you to believe the word over everything and it's going to release a superior strength in your life and Paul goes on to say in Colossians 1:27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles amen which is Christ in you amen the hope of glory now I love this because the Gentiles was a hopeless people they were Outcast they were not included in anything as far as the Jews were concerned it was a waste of humanity amen and there was no hope for them unless somebody take the place of a savior to break the bars of a natural birth and to bring them in by Grace so Jesus Christ the son of God hung on the calvary amen and by him hanging on Calvary he revealed himself in plain view amen as a savior of all mankind and his death at Calvary amen broke the bars over the door and a Door of Hope was opened unto the Gentiles by the death of Jesus Christ but it didn't just stop at his death on the third day by a supernatural Resurrection he arose again and brought hope back in the church listen friends we have got a power this morning and it's not the power of psychology it's not the power of denomination it's the power of Faith to believe God's word has opened the door of Hope unto this generation and I say this to you in the name of the Lord you don't have to stay where you are you don't have to live behind those bars you don't have to live underneath all that fear amen there's a word concerning your life and it's a heavenly vision amen amen are you hearing me and the hope is Christ in you said what is the mystery of God is God in you the hope of glory shining forth the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said now watch and see where the gates of hell is against it's not against the denomination the government recognizes that the world recognizes those amen what is the gates of hell again brother Joe it's against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now the same yesterday today and forever the gates of hell is not against your feelings come on I'm preaching to you now amen because I tell you what'll happen amen you'll come in church and sometimes you won't feel like getting in you won't feel like saying amen you won't feel like singing the now I might as well preach somebody will hurt your feelings in the parking lot somebody hurt your feelings in the vestib somebody won't shake your hand they won't recognize you amen and your feelings get defeated and brother r on just a matter of minutes amen but greater is the Revelation amen than the feelings of your Humanity I say this this morning we can have a good service ever service we can have a breakthrough ever service amen because our services are not bound to Five Senses amen our services are controlled by the Super S and it's a revelation and if the Holy Ghost comes in the building we'll begin to praise we'll begin to worship we'll begin to shout we'll begin to sing we'll begin to preach we'll begin to shout until them Devils back up and the liberty of the Holy Ghost comes in the building and manifest himself in the power of his resurrection listen you're looking at one preacher that still believes in the power of the Resurrection I said I still believe in the power of the Resurrection you say preacher why do you believe in the power of the Resurrection because before the resurrection he needed a door to walk through but after the resurrection he can walk right through the wall are you hearing me before he needed a door but after the resurrection he can walk right in through a wall Oh Glory to God you know what that tells me that the power of the Resurrection is unlimited are you hearing me you say brother you don't know how far I've gone I don't need to know how far you've gone I'm coming to tell you how far he came and he didn't stop on earth oh God he didn't stop on the earth he didn't stop in Galilee he didn't stop in Nazareth he went all the way to hell and through a supernatural Resurrection he took the keys of death hell and the grave away and sent me here this morning to announce unto you there's a supernatural God in this building this morning and he's got a faith to break whatever situation you're going through I believe in Revelation I believe the gates of hell is against it but we'll Prevail over them by this revelation we shall overcome am now can I just say it Satan hates Revelation yes sir amen but we love it let's say that together Satan hates Revelation but we love it let's say it again that felt pretty good Satan hates Revelation but we love it Satan hates it but we love it Satan hates it but we love it you know why we love it because he cannot Prevail against it and it makes him so mad it gets him all tore up it gets him all bothered amen but I don't care I'll say it again there is a revelation in this building that the devil cannot Prevail against he can Prevail against my flesh he can Prevail against my spirit but there is a revelation In My Soul by gen seed of almighty God and there ain't enough devils in Hell Amen to defeat this Revelation I believe this morning you are an Unstoppable undefeatable Invincible Army and it's not by your works it's not by your ability it's by the revelation the Revelation is coming to your life and the prophet said he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true Spirit or the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army brother Tom she won't be she might not be possibly she will be an invincible Army you know what the word Invincible means too powerful to be defeated amen now if you would let your soul worship this morning your seat wouldn't have contained you just then but we've all been there and the reason why we can't is because our flesh is telling us well this and that amen but let me repeat that again Invincible means you're too powerful to be defeated you are too powerful to be defeated come on Church some of y'all sitting there thinking something's going to defeat you if we open the mic and had an open floor this morning amen there be people here that's been through enough they shouldn't be here amen but if God got you this far if God brought you through everything that he's brought you through amen then why are you backing up and let some more unbeli a negative devil amen convince you he's got more power than this word come on church amen if God took this church from that back corner Amen to where it is this morning that I challenge every devil in hell you didn't defeat him then and you won't defeat him now then this is more than that mois this is more than Grace Tabernacle this is a supernatural Revelation that has come into this Church by the preaching of the message of the hour and it's pursuing Devils it's recovering families it's restoring homes it's restored lives I refuse to believe that the devil will defeat this church I refuse to believe that the devil will defeat your young people I refuse to believe that I refuse I refuse I refuse to believe it there is a revelation in my soul this morning that is testified you are an invincible Army bad day won't defeat it down days won't defeat it sickness won't defeat it depression won't defeat are you hearing me I'm telling you I refuse to get out that spirit I refuse that's why that Devil's pushing against me right now is I refuse to get under it because he knows if I get under it I can't break it but if I can stay above it and preach to you the word of God I can break through the clouds and say come on Church we can break through the situation we can break through the [Applause] CFT you know I'm telling the truth you'll never break a spirit you get under you'll never break a spirit you get under cuz the minute you get under it is the minute it controls you I know what I'm talking about the minute you get under it is the minute it changes your confession it changes your vision it changes your worship it changes your praise I know what I'm talking about amen but I didn't come here to preach a fancy sermon I come here to preach the word and I know the word will defeat the Devil anywhere any time any place under any condition can I say this in any church if God can just find somebody who will believe his word he will come in that atmosphere and he will manifest himself and he will break spirits that you think will never be broken I know what I'm talking about amen it's an age of spiritual warfare and I think it's time to release the revelation of the Holy Ghost back in the church and get some fire behind it and get some Joy behind it I know what I'm talking about well we've been through this we've been through that amen guess what you've been through it but you're no longer in it so if God brought you through it and God brought you out of it then don't you think it's time Amen to shake off the shackles don't you think it's time Amen to let the faith of God arise in your hearts and declare that if God be in me who can be against me don't you think it's time Amen to break out of depression and to break out of the Blues and to break out of all the I know that devil don't want me to but I'm going to break it if it's the last thing I do and you can sit there and watch me do it that devil is defeated this morning that cloud that hangs over and hangs over and hangs over it will hang over no more because greater is the revelation of Jesus Christ in your life and if God be in your soul that's more than a feeling that's more than a sensation that is a reality that Jesus Christ is not in the grave come on I know you're all natural born people but I didn't come to preach to you a natural birth I come to tell you there's a supernatural birth with a supernatural Faith with a supernatural power and there's a supernatural Resurrection taking place right here this morning in this building House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Graves open up release the Believers release the children of God release him from the fear release him from the anxiety release him from the nervousness and bring them back into the revelation of Hope hallelujah hallelujah bring him back in the Revelation where God can come on the scene I refuse to get under it I refuse to get under it I feel that right here in this building this morning I refuse to get under it Matt Morris refuses to get under it Joe Reynolds refuses to get under it Mark refuses to come on elders y'all refuse to get under it brother Morgan you refuse to get under it that's why the devil's pushing and he's pushing and he's pushing it's cuz he wants you to get under it let me prove it to you Spirits work when you don't know they're working years ago a brother told me he was in a prayer line went over to pray for a sister man of God laid his hand on that woman when he laid his hand on a Brother Matt and began to pray a spirit spoke and said you're wasting your time you're helpless you're useless nothing you can do to help her nothing you can do to pray for her nothing you can do to deliver her you know what that devil was doing that devil was trying to manipulate somebody with a revelation of Mark 16 to come under the influence of demonic spirits and just agree that this woman could never get free he said but I stood there and I prayed when I didn't feel like praying I believe when I didn't didn't feel like believing he said even though that devil was talking to me amen and that woman got a breakthrough afterwards the pastor told him he said brother we've been praying for that for a long time he said what do you mean he said she's been under a spirit of depression he said that Spirit of depression has been telling her she can't get free she's useless she's hopeless she'll never overcome it and watch how that devil worked amen that devil already had one under that spirit amen so here comes a man of God brother Joel with a revelation that that Spirit can be broken and he lays his hand on her and that devil says I got her so let's see if we can intimidate him and get him underneath the Same Spirit but he stood there with a revelation and he prayed a prayer of Deliverance and the woman left her free I'm telling you church if you're going to break the spirit you got to get out from under it if you're going to break the spirit you got to get out from under it well brother and I'm under will get somebody and join with you that ain't under that spirit and get in a spiritual warfare come on Grace Tabernacle I think it's time to declare war I think it's time to declare war I think it's time to take back your Revival I think it's time to take back your vision I think it's come on Church well brother we've been through some hard times I know you've been through some hard times but can you open your eyes and see you're still here Satan hates that Revelation because he cannot defeat it now Pro God said there's nothing is life given and prevailing as Revelation right yes sir now what are you getting at brother Andrew I'm saying faith comes from hearing glory to God what is told I'm telling you the vision this morning I'm telling you what the word says concerning your life he said I went into a place an insane institution he said there I was facing a very hideous demon that was cursing me and spitting on on me and trying to bite me in a straight jacket now you don't know what a straight jacket is it's something someone puts on you to restrain you on because you're acting contrary to the way they want you to act hello so in other words you're not you're not I'm getting in trouble L say they put them on you when you're acting out out when you shouldn't be acting the way you're acting so you're out of control so they're trying to control you to act the way they you should act so they put a straight jacket on you and say this is the way you act and when you act the way we say you act then we'll let you have the straight jacket what they do is they bind the person and the prophet said when I went in there to meet that demon he said I knew that one thing that first I knew that Christ amen died to free that man from that demon so brother Tim brother Bram didn't walk in there and say I wonder if I'm here to pray I wonder I wonder if God will do something no he walked in there Wesley with the Revelation that Jesus Christ died at Calvary to free the person from that demon he was not going in there looking for a revelation to help the person he came in there with a revelation church at the Living God I didn't come here this morning looking for something Amen to help you I came here with something to help you and it's the message of the hour it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and that Revelation coming into your life will defeat the devil that says he'll defeat you he goes in there brother Mark and he said when I went in there he said I know the angel of the Lord came to me that night and spoke to me and told me that nothing would stand before the prayer if I could get the people to believe me and if I would be sincere when I prayed therefore I had a double witness that I could ask him through the name of Jesus Christ to come out of that person and the man was took out of the straight jacket and went home normally in his right mind he said why because in the authority of the name of Jesus Christ every demon in H hell is subject to that name every demon in hell is subject to that name amen watch that's right it's the name of all names that's a good sermon title it's the name of all names is Jesus amen it wasn't given by human lips the holy ghost that Gabriel the holy ghost that Gabriel it was came down and told Mary to call his name Jesus the angel came down and told Mary the Heavenly being came down told Mary what's conceived in you is a supernatural being and don't you call his name Joseph II or Junior amen you call him Jesus amen and there will be a power in that name and every devil will have to bow with that name can I prove it to you when she went to Elizabeth there was a baby laying in her womb that hadn't moved in 6 months and when that name was spoken amen because Mary believed what was told her and what was told her is when that name is spoken there will be power behind that name there will be an authority behind that name there will be a miracle behind that name there will be a Deliverance behind that name there will be a healing behind that name there will be a Dominion behind that name when that name is spoken there will be a power come behind that name and that name will cause every knee to Bow every tongue to confess it will cause every devil to Bow I want to say it this morning Jesus amen can we say it in the church Jesus the devil hates the name but we love the name and the name is Jesus come on somebody shout Jesus I said somebody shout Jesus shout it more than just a name shout it as your savior shout him as your healer shout him as your deliverer shout him as a miracle worker shout it out as the mighty con I'm talking about Jesus I'm talking about the name that heals cancer I'm talking about the name that delivers depression I'm talking about the name that restores chicles I'm talking about the name that gives the Holy Ghost the name of all names and it's Jesus I said it's Jesus I said it's Jesus I'm going to put on my walking shoes this morning and I'm going to walk around in my inheritance because I am an heir of the authority and the power and the ability and the majesty and the glory of that name and it's Jesus it stops storms it raises the dead it breaks up it breaks up funeral processions it brings the blinded eyes in it's Jesus I said it's Jesus I tell you why the devil don't want you to say that name it's cuz you are a people in Black Rock Arkansas that actually has the Divine authority of that name want me prove it to you brother B said they're out here hollering the name Jesus right they're out here hollering the name Jesus and they're not getting nothing so they're out there this morning saying Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and they're not getting nothing you know why they're not getting nothing because they're not under the manifestation of the interpretation of the name of God I'm just going to say what a prophet said he said when the seals were open he said he received a new name when the seals were open he received the new name he said and now the name of God is the word interpreted the manifestation of the name of Jesus is the word interpreted so wherever the word is interpreted there is a manifest of the name that's being spoke well Grace Tabernacle there is an interpretation of the Living God in this building this morning his word said he would save and Joel you're saved his word said he would fill with the Holy Ghost and you're full of the Holy Ghost come on Brother David the word said he would deliver and he you sit here this morning with you and your family amen Delivered come on the word said he would heal and just a few days ago you had a stroke amen but here you stand this morning amen healed amen by the name of Jesus the word said you the word said you wouldn't make it amen but here you stand on the other side of that trial I say to you this morning you are a living breathing living manifestation of the name of God I say Jesus I speak Jesus over the young people I speak Jesus over every marriage I speak Jesus over every home I speak Jesus over every preacher I'm not chanting I'm not chanting the name Jesus I'm speaking in the name Jesus by the manifestation of the Revelation that has been made clear in the age I'm living in Jesus his name is power his name is Holy his name is [Music] [Applause] righteous Jesus now either I'm a crazy man or a Believer and I'm a Believer I see the name of Jesus in man man estation in this building this morning I know what that Devil's doing right now he's pushing and he's pushing and he's pushing and he's pushing but guess what we're pushing we're pushing and we're pushing and we're pushing and we're going to keep on pushing you know why because there's an authority behind this Revelation amen yes sir what are you saying I'm saying Mar went down to Jesus or to to Elizabeth and said Jesus and when she said Jesus a dead baby in a mother's womb leap for Joy a dead baby in oh God in a mother's womb leap for Joy I'm about to have to tie my hands and sit on Bap for Joy at the name of Jesus the baby wasn't even born yet but when he heard the name Jesus come on Church the the vision said there'll be power in that name when that name is spoken he'll be a ruler when that name is spoken there'll be there'll be overshadowing power that will come behind that name and when she said that name the life of that name went into that womb and delivered that baby from whatever condition it was in brother said if the name of Jesus yes sir goad we'll do that for a dead baby he said what ought it to do for a church if it'll do it for a dead baby amen what ought you to do for a church that's got likeing come I know some of y'all this morning come on church I know what I'm talking about amen but what you need to do is you need to overcome that Devil by the name of Jesus I know it's an age of depression I know it's an Age of Anxiety I know it's an age of complexes and fears amen but I'm telling you Church Church there's an authority in the name of Jesus now can I can I prove to you something when a vision comes amen it's more than just a word amen it's a direct message from God then why say this in closing we've got to put our faith in the vision that's right yes sir we have got to put our faith in the vision said like this he said now what have we received we have received a heavenly vision I love that we have received a heavenly vision he said now watch ask 2719 I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision in other words when the vision comes you've got to obey The Vision by placing your faith in the vision and then the effect of the vision is The Obedience of it can I say this to you whatever is in the vision must be in the Fulfillment so in other words if there was power in the vision there must be power in the fulfill M if there was Authority in the vision there must be Authority in the Fulfillment come on church if there was healing in the vision there must be healing in the Fulfillment whatever was in the vision brother Bobby must be in the Fulfillment or it's not a correct vision if there's one thing different in the Fulfillment than what was in the vision that Vision didn't come from God come on Church a vision must line up with the word of God now watch a prophet he said see this Vision what is it it's another dimension yep that's right so you're literally leaving this Dimension and going into another dimension it's outside of the five senses are y'all ready for this it's a forecast of future events so in other words when the angel came to Mary and told Mary to birth that son and call his name Jesus she was receiving a vision of forecast of future events and here we are some thousands of years later and we're still living out the vision oh God we're still living out The Vision by the authority of the vision said watch he said it's a forecast of future events now if you read Ephesians 1:18 the Bible says that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of your calling of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints so what happens is is a vision comes amen from the spirit of Enlightenment right so in other words what you're looking at Brother David Paul is real dark it's real dark it's real gloomy it's real heavy but if a vision comes a vision is forecasting beyond what you're seeing so all you're seeing right now is the clouds but brother Randall if a vision comes it'll forecast Bey on the clouds and you'll see the sun yes sir oh God if a vision comes brother Travis it'll go beyond the clouds it'll go beyond the disappointments it'll go beyond the present and you'll see the future by Vision now if you see it by Vision you're going to see what's there in the vision and then when you step into the Fulfillment of it you're going to be able to say as it was in the vision so is it in the Fulfillment in other words the Vision by Revelation becomes your Authority in faith in the vision now can I say this the vision has a voice I'm moving into something here The Vision has a voice and the prophet of God said like this he said the voice of the vision paraphrasing if it's coming from Heaven is coming from the spirit of Truth Now John said there's the spirit of error and there's the spirit of truth right amen now hereby know we the spirits amen the spirit of error and the spirit of Truth so the spirit of error can I say it like this he's a prop sir yes sir y'all know what I'm talking about I see I feel I think I hope I believe I see I feel maybe could be it's a propine devil sir don't get tired on me preach with me and that devil will lie to you and he will lie to you and he will lie to you and he will bind You by his false interpretations by his false prophecies come on well we might as well just go and let the rubber hit the road and preach a minute amen I think it's time to get back to giving things the word test we used to think we used to check things by the word and not by personalities well come on church we used to check things by the word and not by just because of who done it or who said it amen but some little old personality devil come right in and now we don't want to check nothing amen but Church Living God if you're going to overcome leay out of sea you got to get back Amen to giving things the word test if you're going to overcome deception you got to get back you got to lose the fear of checking things by the word if you come on church amen some of you all have been through that and you know what that does it binds and robs and hacks and cuts amen but I say thank God for the word that we can check the Spirit by and we can determine if it's coming from God or if it's coming from the devil amen can I open up with you for minute I fill the room I know what them Devils do they come in and disguise themselves under spirituality and under anointing and they always run over and claim that famous verse brother Joel touch not my anointed and do my profits no harm and I believe that but I don't believe your false interpretation that you're trying to subject me to is that okay I don't believe it I believe what the Bible said and the Bible said that just the preacher is not the only anointed the Bible said whatever Christ comes into becomes the anointed can I ask you something amen why are we got to be AF oh I clean up amen why we got to be afraid to check something amen there's such a fear oh if I if I if I check that preacher and what he told me amen God might come after me amen why don't we move that same level of respect to the pews because you're just as anointed as the preacher is come on if you're if you're under the word it's the same anointing it's a word anointing but that Spirit comes in and says now oh God get in trouble sure's the world man I remember I was just I don't know I just started preaching I don't know maybe maybe 15 16 and Lord really just started opening some doors for me and I was going out and preaching you know and we had a brother come in the church and I say this uh it's on the internet how do I say this preacher come by and he got up one night and he said he said now you all know God uses me in the prophetic and discernment and and and visions and prophecies and and so well you know I checked it by the word now let's move on so he gets up you know the Lord use me and he stands there brother Bobby and all of a sudden he says you know he says Andrew Glover come up you know and I said okay so I you know respectfully walked up there and he said he said y I say unto thee my son thou Hast a SE of pride in your heart yay I say unto thee thou H has revealed unto me that thou H has a seed of pride in thy heart in all the places God would love to use you if thou would only humble thyself all the places God would exalt you if thou would just humble thyself I see this seat of pride in your heart okay so I stood there just stay with me I stood there real reverence you know and I listened to him and he said and yay I say unto thee thou Hast going to face a trial in a few days and and this trial is going to be so hard you're going to be so low you're going to feel like you're forsaken amen but yay I say un thee if thou will remove the seed of Pride from myy heart and look unto me I will be with thee in this trial okay so I took it to the word pray it over me I went to PE for a solid weed week I lived in pure confusion for a I'm preaching to you now for a solid week I lived in confusion I was praying I was fasting I was asking God I was calling Brothers I don't see this seat of pride in my heart I don't see I mean God if it's there reveal it to me okay so a week goes by amen and I'm talking to a brother and I'm telling this brother what happened and he says brother go listen to a tape called humble thyself so I actually I talk brother Wayne about it he said go listen to stay pumble myself so I went listen to it amen and all of a sudden ride down the road the spirit of Truth come in the car and revealed to me it was not a seat of Pride that I wouldn't humble myself to God it was a seat of Pride I wouldn't humble myself to that man on I'm preaching to you now and what they do is those spirits come in and they will bind your future I know a lady right now that 20 years ago a preacher told her amen you've gone too far amen and God can't use you till you do do something and she went done it but to this day she's still living in that fear can I just goad and take the gloves off and say what that is it's a line Spirit from the pits of hell that's trying to interpret a heavenly vision and put you in fear and put you in bondage but I say this morning amen there is a perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication we don't have to live one day up and one day down and one day this is going to get me we have come back to a heavenly vision and the fear is gone now you know what I'm saying the fear is gone can I say this to you this morning the thing may still be there but the authority of the name of Jesus the Revelation and faith and vision has accumulated in your heart and you have the power this morning to believe the vision and walk free amen amen so somebody told me this brother Ender and somebody told me this and somebody spoke this over me take it back to the heavenly vision take it to the word amen give it the word test and if it don't line up with the word cast it aside and walk like Abraham walk like Abraham call it contrary to the word of God and walk like Abram come on Church if you're going to get out of this thing you got to start walking you got to start walking and you can't walk like he oh come you can't walk like Cain you can't walk like some false interpretation you got to walk like Abraham you got to walk like Enoch you got to put your eyes on the vision you got to put your faith in the vision and you got to walk unconscious of criticism you got to walk unconscious of fear you got to walk unconscious of what this said and what fat said come on Grace Tabernacle am I believe it's time to put your walking shoes on and I think it's time to walk in faith again I think it's time to walk in power again I think it's time to walk in Rejoice come on y'all remember what it was like a whenever service he was walking by Revival he was walking by Joy amen but some critical devil criticized and some negative spirit said this and some devil division but let it go this morning and come back to the word of God and line yourself up with the vision and speak the name of Jesus can I close on this point amen there is power in the vision is faith in the vision and S there's faith in this vision and this vision is concerning your life and it will not return into God void and it shall be exactly as it was told come on church if it was told in the vision I saw you there amen N I believe what the Bible says I believe that you're a daughter of God I believe a prophet said he saw you there come on church I believe it I believe everybody he saw there is going to be there know what Devil's push ping again I'm going to push back the vision said I saw you there the supernatural being give that Vision you got to believe that vision and call everything contrary is trying to keep you here and believe the vision and say I'm going to be there I'm going to be there with my babies I'm going to be there with my church I'm going to be there with my testimony I'm going to be there with my grandbabies I'm going to be there and if devils in Hell Amen to defeat me I've been seen in the vision and whatever is in the vision will be in the [Applause] Fulfillment can I leave you this you've got the authority this morning amen yes sir to put your faith in the vision amen and kill the enemy amen tells us this he said while he's talking about a vision he while this woman is praying the Holy Spirit goes right to that woman and calls her whatever it did and tells her who she was and told her rather who she was and what her trouble was and about her having cancer and said she it would be all right the little lady went home couple days after that she just started choking to death nearly just her throat swelled way up she gave a big cough in the cancer jumped out and she's perfect well that's what was making a little woman get worse many times I've explained it if you get worse that's a very sign you're healed that's right I'm out of time if you get worse that's a very sign you're healed amen come on Church well brother Andrew since I give my heart to God and I've totally dedicated and got the Holy Ghost and serving the lord things are getting worse that's a sign you're on your way to a place the devil don't want you to go come on a that's a sign you're going somewhere he don't want you to go come on church amen if Matt was trying to get in that room and I didn't want him to get in there I'd get between him and that room and I'd do everything I could to convince him he don't need to go in there there's nothing for him stay out of this room but if he knows by Revelation that there's a there's a whatever he needs is on the other side of that wall he will by Authority remove me open the door and go to what's promised him and Grace Tabernacle I'm leaving you if this this morning God has done some things for you God has done some mighty things in this church God has perform the supernatural right here in this church amen I'll tell you what's happened the devil's trying to get between you and your future he's trying to get between you and the Rapture he come on church I know what I'm talking about amen you've had people come in and give their heart to God and get baptized amen and their lives almost fall apart you know why because the devil is trying to stop them from getting to what they're air to but I say this morning we have got Authority and we have got power this morning to look that Devil's sare in the face and by the word of God physically remove him between us and the door of our future and throw him down and put our foot on his head and walk like Abraham and walk into our future it means you got something now I know I know I know I know you s how you preaching this as a musicians are coming brother said it got worse but it had to let loose see it was just getting worse all the time and choking her it was C and swelling but it had to let loose see the life was out of it come are y'all hearing me the life was out of it it had to get worse it had to keep on swelling but the life was out of it see oh like that sprung are you ready for this brother Joe it pulled it Loose from the rest of her flesh and the dead substance just the body with no life in it the cancer gone jumped out see and fell out so that's what the body went out then that wasn't the devil went [Music] out the house he lived in so he said the devil didn't go out the house he lived in he went out are you ready for this he went out why because the woman's faith in what was told her knowing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's what killed the cancer and took the life out of it her faith in the vision complete confidence that what was told would be killed the cancer and took the life out of it you know what that cancer was doing it was trying to stand between her and her future that's right but sister Joyce she spoke and when she spoke that cancer left remember since you went back to the doctor the doctor said okay said let's take a look he said all nonsense things there same as always was she said that's right the growth was there but not not the [Music] life the growth is there but the life of it's gone and if the life's out of it come on church if the life's out of it that means it's defeated if the life's out of it that means it's dead if the life's out of it that means it can't hurt you no more oh Church of the Living God there's a vision coming this generation and it spoke over your life it spoke over situations it spoke over your church and it's rebuked the life out of them Devils the life of is gone Miriam your enemy is dead won't you stand your feet with us this morning Miriam your enemy is dead now I said all that to say this what what's held you can hold you no longer what's bound you can bind you no longer when the authority of the name of Jesus comes into the church it does things it does things Jesus subdues atmospheres I'm telling you friends we're not here hollering the name of Jesus we're not here beating people on the back Jesus Jesus Jesus J oh Jesus Jesus we're standing here as adopted manifested children of God whether we feel like it or not we know our Authority whether we sense it or not we know who we are whether feeling smelling seeing hearing tasting imagine reason whatever whether none of them will declare it or not makes no difference it don't make one difference we stand here with faith with Revelation and we will prevail in Jesus name we will prevail in Jesus name how many can say this morning I will prevail in Jesus name we will prevail the prevail power of Revelation speak the name of Jesus this morning speak it over your life and watch what'll happen speak it over your family and watch what'll [Music] happen I've seen it remember one time over in New Zealand preaching one morning in a convention and just started preaching about the power of Jesus just breaks the Devil's Backbone in fear the name of Jesus his dream just break the Devil's Backbone in fear when I said that there was a woman in the back when I said that she jumped up just real just just jumped straight up kind of kind of widey you know and she was looking at me and I just felt drawn to preach to her for a second and I said you know I've just preaching away and I said the devil's fear he'll put fear on you he'll tell you you ain't going to make it he'll tell you you're going to get killed you're going to you're going to die and all these things are going to happen and I said he'll put all these fears on you and when I said that brother Mark she literally started screaming in the back and saying I'm free I'm free I'm free I said maybe even the devil tell you you don't need to go that camp because you'll die on your way to it when I said that she just started I mean she just screaming took off running she come the cafeteria and grabbed the microphone from the brother that was going to pray for lunch she grabs the microphone brother Wesley and she says I'm free I'm free she said ever since I got married she said I've lived under a fear she said that my husband and I was going to get killed and and somebody else have to raise her babies she said this year my husband finally convinced me for us to come to this Family Camp as a family she said I went in my bedroom and I rode out a wheel basically and she said I hid it under my pillow she said because the devil convinced me we wouldn't come back alive and somebody else have to raise her babies she said I she said it was so real I wrote it out she said but when you spoke that this morning she said my mind knew the word discerned my heart and said I knew what was laying on my bed she said but today that fear is broken and she said I can say in the name of Jesus Christ I'm free I'm free I told that down at brother Tim's Youth Camp the following year and a couple sitting in the very back an older couple amen that God had just recently blessed her with a child she come to me after service she said brother Andrew she said because of our age she said we live in fear so we've been in fear that we're not going to be able to live long enough to raise our baby that God give us she said but this morning that fear is broken in the name of Jesus Christ what are you hearing me I'm telling you there's a natural devil that's trying to bury you under natural problems and natural situations but there's a supernatural being in this building this morning with a supernatural power with a supernatural Resurrection challenging you in faith to resist that devil

for me I'm So Unworthy to live yet I'm not F to kill but then a man on the cross he wrote my name it is Will and said that I can still go free can we sing this verse together will I never could Qui have you ever stopped just to think about it while the king of Heaven that had never been walking on this filthy Earth that it would take a flesh body for the mark to come down in the filth of this world that we're living in the Bible said that he would be tempted in every like manner of man the the same trials that you go through he went through the same problems that you face he fa the same emotions he felt every emotion that he could conquer every one of them that one day sister Laur Lee that he would fulfilled his very commission upon this Earth he would have walk down that road to Calvary the cross that he didn't even deserve brother Joe the cross that should have been there for every one of us but he went and he put his hands out on the cross of Calvary he let him put a a crown of thorns on his head and he could have called 10,000 angels but he hung on that cross and instead of crucifying them instead of condemning them he said for father forgive them for they know not what they do and by the cross of Calvary he set every one of us free this morning that's why we can sing this song I can still go free some somebody tell me what kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for me I'm So Unworthy to live yet not fre to kill but then a man on the cross he wrote my name in his will and said that I could still go free how many's free this morning by the blood of Jesus Christ you say brother Matt I don't why why do you praise God the way you do why are you so free like you are well let me tell you why I come to church and there's a liberty in my soul ringing out to God Brother David let me tell you why it's there is because God has forgiven me see you can't experience Freedom if you never experiened bondage some folks they just don't know they're bound but I'm I'm I'm I'm man enough to say I was bound but now I've been set free that's why I can worship God like I worship there was a little woman that came down to his feet one day when he was in Simon's house and she began to wash his feet and they they looked at her and they condemned him for washing her feet and you know what Jesus done he turned around he said let me tell you a little story there was a creditor one time and one man owed him 50 and another man owed him 500 and he forgave them both and Jesus asked this question he said now you tell me which one of them is going to love him the most he said I would think it would be the one that was forgiven the most he said what you speak is truth why why are we so free why do we love God like we do because he's forgiven me of so much I was unworthy I was unfit but he forgave me of so much so I can praise him I love him with all my heart I serve him with everything that I have in me cuz he forgave me of much it makes me want to makes me want to be a real Christian a real believer how many love the Lord this morning how many appreciate that message our brother spoke wasn't it powerful that we're free men and women I know it's winding down the end of the service maybe you've been sitting in your seat you say brother Matt I want that kind of Freedom I'm going to invite you to come and have it you don't have to go through this life being bound come on let this Brothers pray for you and give it all to the Lord make a commitment this morning and say Lord I want to always give an opportunity when the Lord puts
