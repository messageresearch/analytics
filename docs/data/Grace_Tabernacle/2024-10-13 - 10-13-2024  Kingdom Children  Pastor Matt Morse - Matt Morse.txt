your Liberty Lord May the hearers this morning God just to move out of the way and God that we could just focus on your word a few minutes and pull from the gift of God that you would come and speak to our hearts Lord we ask and we'll give you the glory for all you do in Jesus name amen amen the church say Amen you love the Lord this morning amen I want to invite you to the scripture to Galatians the 4th chapter and we're going to read out of the fourth verse and just hold you a few moments this morning and I just really been enjoying the speaking over the past uh few weeks enjoyed that service Wednesday night and sure appreciate our our service and brother speaking and and the Lord really moving and that's what we want to see amen as God moving in our midst amen and we just really and went down Thursday night into the meeting at brother Tim's and really enjoyed that brother Tom Ray had spoke and and certainly enjoyed uh being in meeting with those so I know there are several uh from from down there is even coming up for our meeting uh in uh next week so just continue to be praying for that look forward to it so we want to invite you to Galatians the 4th chapter and we're going to read out of the fourth verse and we'll read down to the seventh verse the Bible says but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of the son in our hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if you're a son then you're an heir of God through Christ amen would us ask the Lord to add his Blessing how many say Amen to that if you're a son that you are an heir of God through Christ and this morning I want to speak on Kingdom children we've been speaking on this series on a kingdom series and uh but I I want to take this scripture here in Galatians 4 uh in the adoption series how many listen to that adoption series uh lately and um well well God bless you so maybe with something we ought to get get a hold of it especially in what we've been speaking on in this uh Kingdom uh series over the past few weeks but it may have been a while but I know SE how many's heard it at some point okay that's more like it several has heard it but in the adoption series but BR would take this scripture in Galatians 4 and tie it to Romans the 8th chapter and say where the earnest that says where the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God he said I want to point this point this out that God is trying to place his church in a position he's trying uh to manifest himself and getting one that he can work through like this so he can say that my spirit flows freely through him there there is somebody that I can work through that's what God is trying to do he's trying to get a people in a position that he can work through them so he'll get one over in one place and one over in another and maybe uh one over in another place and and God is is literally taking the Sons and Daughters of God and placing them in a position that he can flow through them God do you realize that God God wants to use you somebody say that God wants to use me amen he he wants to use you and so he has to get them in a place and but said so here's what's happening it's adoption placing and manifesting this is the three things that is going on in the church it's adoption and then God placing and then manifesting the life of Jesus Christ now I know uh many of you since it's been a while since we've heard the adoption series but uh but but on uh adoption uh it's it's what it's it's it's what the way the prophet explains it is a way that in the old days when a son would be raised up by his father and the son was set under a tutor and for so long of his life as a young man he would be trained by a tutor the ways of the father and so even though he was a son all along and although he he he was he was born of his father and all of those things but there would come a time in his life that he would actually have the will of the father it would be so taught into him that that the will of the father would be a part of him and he would come in the father would put his stamp of approval on him and then he could go and he could he could take the checkbook he could take Daddy's checkbook I don't know how many of y'all would give your kid a checkbook but but but there Comes A Time in his life that you could he could take Daddy's checkbook and he' go to town and he wouldn't write hot checks and squander and buy all the every all the toys in the toy aisle and Walmart he'd be he would do what the father would do with it so he explains of how that when we come to this stage of adoption is whenever the power of God actually comes to the church because it's something that God can trust you with with it's not something that you would abuse you realize that God isn't going to give you some uh uh some power that you could go go abuse you know people you know driving down the road we would abuse it if you had the power to speak people out of existence every Monday morning you'd speak somebody out of existence you driving down the road and they pull out in front of you and and and red Buick be gone I mean it would any grandma that ever drove y'all don't laugh it's the truth but but but God he gives you power knowing that you would use it correctly and so here here we're coming to this age of adop and this is what God is doing you realize that adoption is what God is relying on in order for the church to manifest Christ in know see we have to come to this place in order for God to use us and the Bible tells us the channel that God would use to bring the church to this place of spiritual adoption and now I'm going to make this statement but I believe that God's word was meant to live how many believe that say amen I believe his word was meant to live you say well how can it live John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then the the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us I always thought that was a powerful scripture because he said the word became flesh you know I thought how can a word have flesh how can a word have legs how can a word have feet how can a word have hands how can how can a word live the Bible said the word became flesh in other words the word became alive the word could breathe it could talk it could feel it had compassion it it had emotions it could weep and you say well how could the word come alive well it can only come alive One Way Paul preaches it he said the letter kth but the spirit gives life you say well I've got the word I've got the Bible I know the whole world that we got the same Bible so our church is good enough we preach out the same Bible we've got the same word we can quote it just like everybody else but do you realize that just having the word is not enough it wouldn't matter of fact I can prove it to you cu the past 2,000 years the church world has had the same Bible the same letters from the same Apostles the same word and the only thing it done is created denominations and caused division between people caused families to separate it it it broke things apart it didn't bring Unity it didn't bring people together the same Bible same scriptures all the things they had but all it did was build walls it builds barriers it separates Fellowship because that's what the word would do by itself because no one could interpret it they don't understand it and one sees it one way and one sees it another so so it causes separation and it causes Division and it comes down and then the power of God's Not in it and though so then people would say well they'll deny the power of it because they don't see God working anymore out of his word but you realize it was used for all these things and it's been used for wrong I'm going to tell you this this morning before I even get started the word of God has been used wrongly by many men it's been used wrong it's been used to control people it's been used to bind people it's been used uh to to to to cause people to uh to come under subjection to you it's been called uh used to rule over people it's been used for fame it's been used to to build great Kingdom but but but in all of the things that it's been used for still yet it had no life in it at all but then that same word brother Wesley when it was anointed by the spirit of God it become a great power here's what brother BR said he said Christ never sent me to build an organization he said he sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the spirit of God by his word so by the word of God the spirit would dwell in you and you would become a Powerhouse I don't know about you but I I I see some powerhouses here this morning that's what God intends for you he don't intend for us just to be some Christians that that come in the church and just sit through some services and just get by from one week to another he said but it's in my intention to bring the spirit of God upon the word of God that's in the hearts of the Believers and cause them to be a spiritual Powerhouse in the age that we're living in I want to know how many sitting here this morning is there a Powerhouse here this morning morning is there I I know you may not feel like it but just speak it by faith this morning and say brother Matt I'm a spiritual Powerhouse let me tell you what a Powerhouse is a Powerhouse is a person of great energy strength and power so you know what he done when he brought his word the spirit of God it anointed the word it made you strong and energetic it made you a powerful believer that's what we see this morning brother Mark there's some spiritual powerhouses I know some of them don't know what they are but I know that's what I am this morning he made me a spiritual Powerhouse he took me from serving the devil and he caused me to serve God he took me from serving the world oh you put that same person in a barroom they'll shout and dance and do all kinds of goofy stuff but you put them in the house of God and they sit there why they hadn't been made a Powerhouse yet but I thank God there's somebody that the spirit of God has gotten a hold of and it ain't when they got a microphone it's all the time it made a spiritual Powerhouse out of them and they they're energetic and and strong and they're a powerful believer he gave us a power let me tell you something about this power that God has has given the church this morning it ain't like the powers of the world the power that God give you is a Perpetual power now I know you know if you if you study in the world you'll find this this is something that don't exist this is what all the science Elon Musk he love to to to to get a hold of something like this but it's impossible to do because in in order according to the laws of physics everything has to have an energy in order to cause it to have power so a Perpetual power it would be something that would that that would have power that didn't need an outside source to cause it to be able to produce power it don't need any outside energy so in other words it works infinitely without any external energy so that means if you would take a let's say you took a you know the little ball and you and you and you spun it around it tapped the other ball and it spun around and tapped it and it spun around and tapped it and it went on forever and ever see that would be a Perpetual power you see because there wasn't no outside energy but it will never do that because of the laws of physics and the law of gravity and all and the laws of friction and all the laws that come in in play eventually it's going to run out unless you would come in with an external power and you would cause it to go again see so Perpetual power is something that the world has never been able to do science has never been able to do it but when it comes to the believer God done that in you now is't there something that there something that is impossible in the world Brother David but God done it in the heart of every believer you say well how how in the world do we have a Perpetual power let me tell you how God did it first off he spoke a word and the Bible says faith comes by what by hearing of the word of God and then faith is what brings power to your life and you know what happens whenever power comes to your life you speak the word of God and then it's made manifest isn't it something now you you see what happens and because you speak it Faith by faith uh when you hear it it brings faith and Faith brings power and it causes you to speak it and when you speak it you hear it and it brings faith and Faith brings power and it causes you to speak it and you hear it it brings faith and Faith brings power and power causes you to speak it and there ain't nothing on the outside that has to come in to to to work you up there ain't nobody has to get a microphone and get you worked up this morning because there's something on the inside of you that is always working and it hears and it speaks and it and it has faith and it brings power and it's constantly why because it's a Perpetual power that's on the inside of every believer but said this is what we are he said everything that you have need of in this earth journey is in you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the healing you ever need it's already in you glory to God all the rejoicing you ever need it's already in you all the power you ever need everything that you have need of is in you when Christ is in you it's a Perpetual power brother Jared everything you have need of is in you when Christ is in you see that's what he gives us a power source and brother Wesley this power source is an eternal source that never gets old it's a it's a perfect Source it if you add to it it it don't work if you take away from it it don't work the way God gave it to us it's perfect the way God made it it's a perfect power source that's what this message was given for it was given to take a church that had lost its power and to bring it back into the power of God you see where we are in this age you realize that that this is what God was wanting to do is to bring the church back to the Bible days to bring the power of God back to the church again see the church had lost its power can I say that you know why it got formal it got cold it lost its power it LO it lost the spirit of God and then here God would come in this last stage he said but I won't leave it that way I'm not going to leave it lukewarm I'm not going to leave it powerless but God come in the last day in order to restore the church back to its former glory or back to its former power back to the upper room back to the pillar of fire back to a move of God again you say well how and not by hyping it up and not by ping it up but by the spirit spirit of God that give life to the word of God and brings power back to the church this is what God wanted to see power restored back to the church again now watch Jesus when he was entering into this capernium one day the Bible says the Centurion you remember the story The Centurion comes to him and he says my servant is at home sick and he's tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him but the Centurion answered and he said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I'm a man under Authority I have soldiers that work under me when I tell one to come he comes if I tell one to go he goes I understand a position of authority and notice what Jesus's response was he said I say unto you I have not found so great faith not in all of Israel right but I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out in the outer Darkness where there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth now notice this term that he uses the children of the Kingdom now notice when Jesus is speaking this watch what he's referring to see we use this term children of God or child of God how many how many believes they a child of God we use this term children of God or children of the Kingdom or a child of the Kingdom But realize there's many definitions or theological definitions of what a child of God is one place would say that well we're all children of God since we're created in God's image and another place would say well that we're that any living believer is a Son of God because you're a Believer and you're alive therefore you're a Son of God but notice what the Bible says in John 1 he said he was in the world and the world was made by him but the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him notice it wasn't just believing but it was receiving said any as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name see so they they believed him they received him and they were given power to become a Son of God you notice that believing it gave them a power to become a son but it didn't make them Sons he said he just gave them power to be it takes a power in order to find your position it takes a power to get in your place he said it give you a power to become the sons of God but then the next verse John finishes he said which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but we were born of God see so in other words in order to be a Son of God it takes a birth how you know you think about it how how are you what you are how are you a Morse Carter he was born a Morse he can't help it who his daddy is that's who he was born to he's a Morse so he can't change it neither can you and shakina was she was born of Reynolds wesy you was born of hams Travis you was born a kisser because of your birth it made you what you are so see so that's the way it is brother said that's the way to become a child of God just like you became a a child of your father because you was born of your father it made you a child of your father well that's the way it that's what it takes to be a child of God it takes being born by the spirit of God into the Church of the Living God so you want to be a part of God's church and be a child of God it takes being born by the spirit of God so you notice when Jesus uses this term Children of the Kingdom he's actually referring to the Natural lineage of Abraham or Israel now I I don't believe that Jesus used Idle Words I don't I I don't believe that that I believe that he fulfilled scripture how many believe that I believe that whatever he said was a fulfillment of what took place in the Old Testament every prophecy that pertaineth to him he fulfilled it every everything that was concerning him he fulfilled it he knew what he was saying he knew the law and the prophets he certainly knew he he no doubt he could quote Malachi he remember whenever the Bible said he knew it remember when they came to him and they said shouldn't Elijah first come he said well certainly he shall first come and he has come and he will come see he knew what Malachi had prophesied he knew he knew that he would come so I'm going to say if he knew Malachi 3 then he knew Malachi 1 see cuz there was no ones twos and threes and fours back then it was just a letter from a prophet and so if he knew the prophet Malachi then Jesus certainly knew that God had spoken through Malachi when he said who is there among you that would shut the doors for nothing neither do you Kindle a fire for nothing in other words is there not a priest among you that would go and make a sacrifice earnestly is there somebody that would make a sacrifice that that that would have an Earnest sacrifice or a sincere sacrifice said that you don't just do it for no reason or just because it's a law is there is there not one among you this is what God is crying out this is hundreds of years before Jesus ever walked upon the Earth Malachi's prophesying of the condition of Israel saying is there not a priest among you that would make a sacrifice that is a worthy sacrifice is there not a priest among you that would make a sacrifice for a reason is there not somebody among you that would come to the house of God on purpose is there not somebody among you that would come here and worship God that would have a reason is there Earnest sacrifice that is still is still there is there not just one he was calling for one priest that would make an Earnest sacrifice before God he saw the condition of a Nation the coldness that had crept in he said is there one that would make an Earnest sacrifice listen what God said he said for I have no pleasure in you says the Lord of hosts neither will I accept an offering at your hand because it was an Earnest I won't even accept the offering that you make so all these years Brother David they went out and they made offer and it wasn't even accepted by God out of the mouth of his own Prophet saying I won't accept it it's not an Earnest sacrifice I'm not going to accept it you can go through the motion if you want to but I'm not going to accept it because it wasn't an Earnest sacrifice but listen what God said it wasn't going to be the end it wasn't that God was just going to go give up and give up on people he said but for from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles and every place incense shall be offered unto my name in every place incense shall be offered unto my name in every nation in every place in the world my name would be great isn't that a wonderful thought it would be a pure offering he said every place incense would be burned it' be a pure offering unto me for my name shall be great amongst the Heathen sayeth the Lord my that's something Malachi was prophesying that God that the the very God that was only known by the Jews the one that wasn't worshiped by the heathens he wasn't worshiped by the Gentiles he wasn't worshiped by the people of the world but Malachi prophesied that that very same God that one day that there would be a gentile people out of every nation and his name would be great among them I don't know about you but I think we're a fulfillment of that this morning that that that we're a nation and in this nation there's a gentile people and I don't know about you but his name is great in my mouth I say in this nation let his name be great in all the nations of the world his name has become great when they would turning down but his name was great say why because there was a people that God would call it was prophesied that it would come to him you think about what Israel was waiting on they thought he would come in great power of judgment and because he would come this is how they took this scripture brother Jared God G or this this Messiah this Christ would come in this great power of judgment and because he would bring such a great judgment upon the world that that he would lift Israel he would destroy all their enemies and because this great king of judgment would come the nations would fear him and he would be a great name among their Nation this is what they were looking for this great judge but you realize that that's not what made his name great it wasn't the coming of a judge that made his name great it was the coming of a savior that made it exact opposite of what they were looking for the coming of a judge that would caus them to have reverence toward him but that ain't what it took it was the coming of a savior that caused this day do you realize the day that we're living in that there's Believers in every nation in this world it don't matter what nation you go to there's a gentile people that the name of Jesus Christ is great in their mouth it's a fulfillment of Malachi 1 brother Mark and I'm glad to be able to say I'm a part of it it wasn't the coming of a judge that made me serve him it ain't the coming of a judge that made him great before my eyes but it was the coming of a savior that came down and picked us up out of a my clay and said I won't leave you in that place I don't come to tread you down but I come to lift you up and because he lifted us it made his name great becoming of a savior made great his name the coming of a savior it gave hope to those that were hopeless the coming of a savior it saved those that were lost the coming of a savior it's what it's what brought healing to the sick the hope to the weary and it's what brought power back to the church the coming of a savior and the Bible said and unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves in the stall and shall tread down the wicked it would brought power back to the church listen what what Paul's message was he said see this Blessing of Abraham it would come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ this is where Paul would take these scriptures of Malachi and the life of Jesus and he would he would apply it into the doctrine of the church today said The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit this was Abraham's promise that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made but notice Paul points this out that God God never said to Abraham into to thy seeds plural he said but to thy seed singular he said so what he was speaking of his seed which was Christ he say so his seed would be able to inherit the promise so all of those that are in Christ or all those that Christ is in see that's where the promise would be inherited he said so I say this and then Paul proves this scripture he proves to us he said see how could the Covenant that God made with Abraham before he said before the law the law came 4 30 years after the Covenant was confirmed to Abraham say see so remember when God went up on the mountain with Abraham and he took and he made the sacrifice remember God came down and he divided it and he made a covenant remember he put him in a sleeve and he confirmed the Covenant that he made from him that his seed would receive the promise of God say see so This Promise came to him it was confirmed to him but at that time there was no law 430 years later because of the transgressions of people then God brought the law into the church he said see now he said how how can this law that came 430 years later disano the promise that God had already made 430 years before see so God confirmed it when there was no law God God confirmed it when that law didn't exist he said so it couldn't all La it could how could it make it a none effect he said see how in other words how could the law come and take the Covenant away and cause the Covenant to come by something else he said see so by so the inheritance if it be of the law then it's no more of the promise right and God gave it to Abraham by a promise I don't know about y'all but I think that's good he said see so if the inheritance be of the law it couldn't be of both you can't get it from one way and then get it from another so if it be of the law then it couldn't be by promise and if it's by promise then it couldn't be by the law he said see God gave it to Abraham by promise he said then why do we serve the law it was added because of transgressions until the seed would come to whom the promise was made isn't that a powerful scripture it was added until that seed which was Christ would come to whom the promise was made so here we are this seed of God it would come that that law was there until that seed would come until Christ be born in you and then no longer are we living by a law it's not a a book of rules it's not under a tutor but it's the spirit or the life of Jesus Christ that's living in you that that allows you to be able to walk and serve God and do the things of God and the will of God so we don't have to serve him by law I serve him because of the seed that is on the inside of me so see it's the life of of Christ said see so the law it's not against the promises of God he said if there had been a law given which could have given life then righteousness would have been by the law but the scripture concluded all that were under sin that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe so see so before Faith came we were kept under the law you see your tutor before Faith came we were kept under the law we were we were closed from Faith which would afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after faith has come we are no longer under the school Master for you are the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ isn't that good When Faith came it made you a child of God by our faith in Christ it ain't by our law it ain't by our lineage it ain't by our natural birth you realize this is what Jesus was telling this Centurion he said I have not found so great a faith in all of Israel here he walked among his people all this time but I never seen this kind of Faith he was waiting on this scripture to come to fulfillment that prophecy of Malachi to come to fulfillment he said see it be I have not found so great a faith in all of Israel and because of his faith the Bible says his servant was healed that selfs hour nobody laid hands on him he didn't go down there to where he was he said but you're because of your faith he realized that the power of the spoken word had power to raise him up and he was raised up that self same hour Jesus said I say unto you many shall come to the East and the West notice what he's telling them many shall come from the East and the West to use this this Centurion this Gentile as an example he said and they will sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven in other words around the nations of the world many shall come they'll become come from Sudan there'll be some from the United States there'll be some from Canada there'll be some from from Colombia there'll be some from Guyana there'll be some from India from all the nations of the world from the East and the west and they'll come and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom those that were born of this Kingdom they'll be cast into outer Darkness see what Jesus shows us if you're born of the if you're just a children of the natural Kingdom then you have no hope but if you're a children of the Heavenly Kingdom then you can receive the promise of God but Abraham said see here's what a child of God is a child of God is the Seed of Abraham how many believes that somebody say that with me a child of God is the Seed of Abraham you know what that means if you're a Seed of Abraham you'll have the the characteristics of your father and then you know what Abraham done he walked and he called things that were not as they were he walked and he said they said well there ain't nothing there Abraham said there is something there there's a city and it wasn't made by man it was made by God it would call things when you have a sickness in your body but because of that Seed of Abraham that is in you you can look at the symptom and say I'm not going to believe the symptom I'm going to do like Abraham does and I'm going to call it I'm going to call me well I'm going to call it healing I'm going to call the Lost saved I'm going to call those that are bound I'm going to call them free because there's something in me that cus things that aren't as though they were it's the Seed of Abraham and if you the child of God is the Seed of Abraham says so we walk by faith we don't walk by sight we don't walk by symptoms we walk by faith isn't it something friends just you you can just feel this coming in this building right now that when you see a faith of people begin to build up and real and realize what God is doing with them it it it builds our faith and all a sudden you can look at things and look at situations and things that seem hopeless and the very thing that used to seem hopeless that would never happen the the people you know you got loved ones that are lost and you want to see them serve God and it seems like a hopeless case but when faith comes into the building all of a sudden that thing that was hopeless don't seem so hopeless anymore because it's God he's building there's a power in you he's waiting on you to take it and find your position and to release that power upon this world and speak the the very word of God by the power of the spirit and allow it to go to word then God can look back at you and say there's one I can work through there's one I can speak through there there's one I can use you see God ain't going to come and speak with an audible voice and call a person out of sin and call a person out of darkness and set them on a church pew but what God's waiting on is you and I to be able to speak and say in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going you're going to be delivered of that in the name of Jesus you'll be healed of that in the name of Jesus you're going to give your heart to God and you're going to serve him all the days of your life I claim you in the name of Jesus Christ he's waiting on a son or a daughter of God to come into their position and take the very word of God by the spirit of God and claim the things that God has desired in his own heart he's waiting on you to manifest him to see Abra we're Abraham's seed we call things as no as though they were not as though they were this is what God says so we just keep moving on in a sign of adversity we move on in a sign of circumstance we just keep moving on because we're Abra we're Abraham's seed but notice not only does God show us what a real child of God is brother Wesley you're a real child of the Kingdom but he gives us an identifier to know that we are that isn't that good God gives you a checkup so I know that I've I know I've met that place how many wants to hear some of them I know I know I've made it to that place here here's what the Bible says the Bible says he chastens those he's love he loves he said see if you cannot stand chastisement of God the scripture are lining you up say I don't want to hear that stuff I don't want to be corrected I don't want to be corrected by the scripture if you can't stand to hear it he said it's a sure evidence that you are not a child of God if you can't stand correction you can't stand chastisement you can't take the word of God corrected you it's a sure evidence that you are not a child of God because a real child of God would be hungering and thirsting after the word of God a real child of God even whenever it hurts they say come on preacher just pour it on it's the truth when the word of God's going forth just come on May I know I shouldn't be that I know I shouldn't be in this condition I know I know I shouldn't be in this shape a real child of God they just say Bring It On just keep saying why because they're hungering and thirsting you say why are they hungering and thirsting because they're they're a child of God you realize as a child of God you have a body on this Earth I may as well preach it but you have a body on this Earth and then you have a body that's representing you in glory and so this heavenly body is pulling this Earthly body into subjection it's calling you and it's pulling you into this life to be able to serve God and to be able to be a Christian and be a believer it's pulling you to become that and the world is pulling you down this old flesh is pulling you down and to be able to serve the devil and be able to serve the world and all the things that the world has but then this other body it's pulling you up so what it what let me ask you this this morning what is this fleshly body representing is it representing the world or is it representing that body in heaven let me tell you it may be a struggle but I thank God there's something that is pulling us it may it may be a trial but there's something that is drawing you how how come every time you come in the house of God he pulls on you and he pulls at your heart he's trying to draw you into this place into this heavenly body that God has created you say see he's made you you're hungering and thirsting after that because that body is drawing you said what are you what what what are we using this body for see that's the body we should be so what are we using this one for are we using it to serve the devil hello somebody are we using it to glorify the devil or are you going to use it to glorify God this body is the one that everybody sees are you using it to testify of Jesus Christ are you using it to testify The Works of the devil what are you using this body for see this is the body this terrestial body the one that we see see what are you using it for is it looking towards heaven is there something up there that is drawing you is it trying to to mimic that is it trying to grow into that you say well brother Matt I I know I'm going to get myself in trouble but I'm a pastor I got a pastor you say well I was baptized so that you know I did everything I was supposed to do I was baptized in the water and boy I got it right but remember said you can be baptized in the water and deny the word and you're an illegitimate because your birth wasn't correct say see so a real baptism would cause you to receive the word of God it cause you to say amen amen means so be it a real baptism it causes you to receive the word of God it don't it don't reject it it don't push it out it you know even Oh Glory it it don't push it out it has a desire to hear God's word it has a desire to be right it has a desire to be corrected it has a it has the desire to walk in line with the word of God why because it's trying to get back to that body that one that was bypassed it's trying to get to that it's trying to manifest that life you realize you may grow up in the wrong influence and grow up with you know the friends and stuff in school and they they do all kinds of things but all of a sudden God calls you and whenever he calls you but J he calls you out of this world because he wants you to be something else there there's something isn't it something that God before the foundation of the world he made you and he created you and he had you in his mind they may go down whatever path they're going to go down but you don't have to go down that path because God has made you something different and he's calling you drawing you back to that body said see so we claim if you claim to believe him and den and deny his word it's an illegitimate son he said but my actions and the Vindication of God's word in my life shows whether I'm a Child of God or not my actions think about it I know people don't like to hear this because they like Grace and it don't matter what you do you're you're a Son of God but my actions and the Vindication of God's word in my life you know what that means that God's word has changed me it's been Vindicated it's changed me it's I I know it to be the truth I I accept it to be the truth that's what determines whether I'm a Child of God or not let me tell you what children of God do God's children they obey the father that's what a good that's what a good child does if not whether you're not Wesley's child if you're Wesley's child you obey the father I know some children don't obey the father but wesle children they obey the father but our children they should obey their father in a household the family comes under subjection to the Father the father he's the head of the household and so because they're subject to the father says see we live if you're living in this natural house it's the natural father and the and the and the father's rules they're the rules and whatever the father says that's what it says I mean it don't matter how many times you say why or why can't me and you know I don't know I don't know how y'all Oh Glory I don't know how y'all's kids are but stomping and throwing fits and my my kids it never got them anything it never it got it got them something all right but it sure wasn't it sure wasn't a sucker you know that's what people today they want to quet their kids down they'll put a sucker in their mouth so they'll be quiet and they're stomping around I watched a kid the other day in the store and he told his mom I mean he told his mom I I w't even repeat it but but anyway she did it he he put her right in her place and he was about 5 years old and she he put her right in her place and she gave him his cell phone he went and sat down in the corner and watched whatever he wanted to watch until she got done shopping I thought man I'll tell you what have you that kid ain't mine glory to God but they obey the father praise the Lord and they should be obedient to the father he said see so that's the way it is in a natural house but how about in the house of God you see in the house of God we live by the word of God the Bible says every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and any other word we wouldn't even we wouldn't accept it we' call it a fraud we want because it's only God's word say see so the family of God obeys the order of the father of the family and you know what the Bible said he was he said he was the father he was the governor the king the Emanuel the first and the last the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and every one of his children obey every word to the order because they're a part of him we obey we're obedient because we're Children of the father see but also being a CH a child of God it comes with privileges see to be a to be a child of God we get to Feast at the father's table ain't that good when you have need of something you got a father that owns a cattle on a thousand hills he can always meet your needs isn't it something I don't know about y'all but it something about having a rich daddy Glory I'm going tell you it's it's a good feeling to know that he can take care of you and brother Mark it don't matter when you get in trouble he's got he's got he's got the fix for it you can you can get yourself in the middle of a mess he knows every lawyer he knows every doctor he knows every judge he knows every jury member he's got control over every bit of it the Bible said he's the one that puts in power over all the kingdoms of this world that's my heavenly father father and because he's my father it comes with privileges he's a just God brother heart but he he's a God that it's a merciful god but the wesy preach singing about him he's a god of Mercy you remember you remember how the the story about the little girl that went in she got her a speeding ticket reckless driving and then she came up there and she says well you got to go to court and you know they she may have even had to spend the night in jail she's out there just driving crazy so she comes up there and they said well um to come to the courtroom and loger brings her in she goes and lo and behold the judge was her own daddy she walked in there and said well this this will be a piece of cake that's my dad that's the judge you know what he is he's a just judge so whenever she came in and she pleaded her case well you know I I wasn't really paying attention but you know I was talking on the phone to my friend and you know how how kids do and you know I got to go a little fast I didn't mean to and her daddy looked down at her he said you're guilty she thought he had set her free you're guilty see because he's a just father and he called her guilty but after she was guilty she said now you go over there to the bayith table and take care of your debt you got to find so the girl walks over and then the daddy takes up he gets down he takes his robe off and he walks off the bench he walks over the B table and he takes his checkbook out and he writes a check for the fine and pays it see he's a just God but he's still your father see he's not he's not changing the rules for you he's not bending the rules for you trying to make us illegitimate children but he's a just God but he's still your father he's a merciful god even whenever we're found guilty he says you're guilty by law you're found guilty the I I made the law and you're found guilty but I'll have mercy upon you I I'll save you I'll I'll pay the price and make sure that that's what he done on the cross of Calvary brother Wesley paid the price that we'd be able to stand before a just judge and the debt would be paid he's our father it comes with privileges he's a place of Refuge the children of God they're protected they have a they have an ability to sense the enemy brother said this what the spirit of God does he said there's something about a child of God when you're born by the spirit of God and receive the holy spirit that you can sense the enemy just like a deer you ever noticed a deer out in the woods and it's just something about them you don't have to make a noise or nothing but there's something about them that are so finicky whenever they sense that something's there there's something about their nature so that's the way a Son of God is that you have the ability to sense the enemy that's the Holy Ghost in you that tells you that something just ain't right you go to you you hear something's preacher that just ain't right it don't it don't you ever done that it just don't feel right it don't there's something in you it just don't it just a't what is it's it's it's trying it's something that senses the enemy you realize that Satan is always trying to come in he's trying to to destroy you and trying to lead us astray said but God gave us something that could sense him when he comes you you believe that you see Satan he's trying to sneak into the church that's what he's doing this morning he's trying to sneak into the church around the world and take the life of God out of the church he's trying to take the spirit of God out of the church but friends I've got news for you is not going to succeed at it because we are children of God how many says that with me we are children of God somebody say I'm a child of God and because I'm a Child of God then there's something in me that's calling out for the supernatural there there's something in me that senses what Satan's trying to do and he's trying to bring coldness into my life he's trying to bring coldness into the Church of the Living God but I am a child of God I'm a Son of God and I've got a right by by the power of God to came against what Satan is trying to do and say Satan you can't take another one you can't bring coldness into their life you can't take the Revival out of their heart you can't drag them back into the world you won't drag them back into a barroom or something because I am a child of God and I've got a right to stand upon his word there's something calling out for the supernatural it's calling out it won't stand by and let Satan come in and Rob us of our Victory I won't let Satan rob me of my Revival I ain't going to let him take the dancing and the spirit out of the the church I ain't going to let him take the shouting out of the church or singing in the spirit out of the church because I am a child of God and I sense what the devil's trying to do I sense the coldness that he's trying when he tries to bring it in my life but something in me comes rising up and says Satan you're a liar I'm a child of God and I'm going to serve him anyway when you come to the house of God and all of a sudden you well I just can't worship God like I used to you say I sense what the devil's trying to do and say Satan you're Li I'm a daughter of God I'm a child of God and I'm going to worship God like I should I'm going to worship him like I should why I'm going to stand on his promises I'm going to stand for what's right I'm going to stand for truth why because I've been identified with Jesus Christ I've been identified with by new birth I wonder how many this morning can say I identify with the Holy Ghost I can identify with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can identify with laying hands on the sick and them recovering I identify with a move of God in the church I identify with spiritual worship I identify with people dancing in the spirit I identify with people shouting I identify with people saying amen I identify with the move of God and I'm proud to say it I identify with it because I believe it's God's will I identify it's the spirit of God that gives life to the word of God I know some some aren't convinced yet you but you know they they say well I want God to use me I want to be filled with the power of God but they're not convinced of who they are I want God to use me but you realize in order for you to be convinced of who you are then you first must first be convinced of who God is see how can you be a child of God you don't ain't even convinced who God is when need to be convinced first of who God is convinced that God is real isn't this what you think about what this the world this is what the whole world says you convince me then I'll be a believer convince me God's real then I'll then I'll serve him you convince me to believe that message then I'll believe it you convince me see brother B said but they but they've got to be convinced first he said but the problem is there's only one convincing thing it's the gospel being identified in you see that's the only thing that'll ever really convince you is when the gospel's identified in you it takes a real identity it takes the the the manifestation or the identity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ being identified in you that's what convinces you you know let me let me explain that what it what it means is that whenever the gospel comes into you and it it changes your nature then you're convinced because you know what you used to be are you hearing me so it's not what God can do it's what God did and so therefore I'm convinced that God can do it nobody can make me doubt I'm convinced that God can take a life and and change it I'm convinced that God can take a drug addict and take the desire to do drugs out of their life I'm convinced that God can take an is there somebody convinced this morning why because the gospel's been identified in you I'm convinced that God can take an alcoholic when you couldn't go to bed without drinking a bunch of alcohol and then pass out and you called that a good night's rest but whenever God can take that out of your life and now you can't stand the smell of it without throwing up it convinces you because it's the gospel that has been identified in you and when he identifies in you then you become convinced say see so not only do we want to be identified with the gospel brother Mark but we need the gospel to be identified in us we need it to be identified in us I want to be identifiable by the Gospel of Jesus Christ I want to be identified by when people come by and say that's a child of God right there that's a daughter of God right that's a Son of God because I want the gospel to be identified in me it must become your identity who you are in other words the only way it can become who you are you you need to Bear the characteristics of it you become become the nature of it and see once once you see the gospel identified in you well then you can truly be convinced of who God is a personal experience not just some emotional workup like people try to work people into it but a real personal experience and the gospel being identified in you that's what the world's missing that's what they're missing is a real gospel identified in a person's life but that's what we need a personal experience you know it's so sad you look around this world today and people they just wander in and out of church they just wander in wonderand out you ever see somebody wandering it's a sad thing to see somebody in that condition in the natural to see you know maybe Amnesia or something that would come and they forget who they are and they they lose that identity and it's a sad thing to see but friends let me tell you something the the the the natural Amnesia I would much rather see a person in that condition than a person with spiritual Amnesia see a person with that natural Amnesia There's Hope in a few days they're going to have a new body all that'll pass away from them they won't be in that condition any longer their mind will come back they'll be in in Perfection this is this is the hope of the Natural Body no matter what the sick is in a natural body but you think a person that is lost spiritually and they're wandering there is no hope there they they if they died in that condition they'd be lost they they got to be able to come out of it so it's just a sad thing that people just wander around they wander in and out they wander in church they wander into a pray line they wander out of a prayer line they wonderand they're just kind of wandering around you ever seen about they they they they they don't they they they don't know what they believe they don't know who they are they have no identity they're just wandering wandering around I wonder I wonder if God can I wonder if God will I wonder it just wonders and wonders you realize what what it means to wonder it means to walk aimlessly in other words it means they have no Direction they're just wondering wonderand to church on Sunday wonderand out of church Wonder to church on Wednesday wonderand out of church but you realize that God he didn't call us to wander he didn't call us to wander around brother Mark and just wander in and out but he called us to a place of perfection he called us to a stature of a perfect man you know you know what the Bible said he called us from the foundation of Faith to the Capstone of love that's what God wants in you it's the stature of a perfect man and he's called you to this place of perfection all the way to perfect love where that you're not that you're not just people don't have to you know most people people are walking around wondering people walking about them are wondering too they're wondering who they are and why they come to church and what what they believe and are they a Christian some days they look like it some days they don't it makes other people wonder too but God didn't call us to wonder he called us to be perfect he called us to be in that's what the Bible said he says Be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you said well I'll never be that but let me ask you this question this morning I know we're about to wrap up let me ask you this has God changed you in any way somebody raise your hand if you know that God has changed you I want to see look around okay I don't see a hand that isn't up God has changed you in some way you really believe that now let me ask you this if God has changed you do you not think he can keep changing you isn't it something it's an odd thing thing that I want you to get past this morning that people think that when God changes you he just changed you enough to get you on a church pew and now you're here this morning so now you wander around but that ain't what God called you to he didn't change you you think about it he didn't change you just enough to sit on a Pew he didn't change you just enough to come to church on Sunday he didn't change you just enough to be dedicated on a Wednesday night he didn't change you just to come to the house of God and go home and be a a dedicated Church goer he didn't change you but listen listen what the Bible says he said as we beheld the glory of God we are changed into the same image from Glory unto Glory even by the spirit of God so God is changing you he's not he's constantly changing you and if God has ever changed you if he's brought you this far then he's going to keep changing you he didn't bring you this far just to leave you on a church pew and say well I made it now now what but he's constantly changing you and the work that God done in you ain't nothing compared to the work that God is going to do in you he's con ly changing you and growing you and building you and making you into His Image the Bible said from Glory un Glory he's changing us into the image that we behold you see he changes us he's in you even when you don't see him by Spirit you realize that we don't let our flesh rule over us because he's in us it's Christ that is in you remember the Bible says we're made up of Body Soul and Spirit we're trium beings whenever a person dies they gave up the ghost remember the spirit would leave them and what God does he came down in the spirit to dwell inside of a man and so now that spirit of God is in you even whenever sometimes it seems like it ain't sometimes we get backslid sometimes we get a little cold and indifferent it it just seems like it isn't there we go through we go through so much trouble sometimes but the SK isn't it something to think that the spirit of God is so close I know this is something you've heard before but the Lord put it on my heart that the spirit of God is so close but yet sometimes it seems so far away isn't that something if I told you to go get your arm it'd be easy to get well I got it but the spirit of God even though it's dwelling in you it seems like that we're praying for God to come down off a mountain somewhere and come back send a prophet off a mountain somewhere and bring the spirit of God back to us it we we get in that condition you say what it what is it it's a mind it's a mind battle it's your mind that's blocking you from what's really already there to see CU it's already in you the power that you need is in you Christ is in you see so when you call on him what you have need of he's waiting he he's there but he's not forceful he's not he's not he he's still a gentleman he he's still trying to lead you but he's waiting on you to call on him isn't it something for Christ to be in you say how can that be that Christ is in you yet he's wait I always thought it was such a paradox that he was here the whole time and he was an OM omnipresent God yet he would wait on you to call him on the scene I always thought what a paradox that is but he's in you but he's waiting on you to call him why it's it's like the disciples was that day in the boat the Bible said they went out across the boat and as they crossed the sea the wav the waves begin to uh overtake the boat and it begin to torment them and the wind was tormenting them and brother Mark as the waves got great they said but Jesus was asleep in the boat and finally somebody said why don't we go wake Jesus and let him Cal the storm you see that's what brother said that's what we have to do is we have to wake the Jesus that is in US you have to call him on the scene it ain't that God has gone off somewhere and and he's gone away and he ain't here and he don't have nothing to do with you but sometimes times you just have to awake the Jesus that is in you and call him on the scene you say well how do you awake him he said you awake him by believing his word and Faith brings him on the scene and that's what brings him that's what brings him down says see so when then you call on him to confirm his word and you don't doubt it in your heart you don't fear you don't do it you just believe him as it is written and you let it be done and God will prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I wonder how many this morning can say but mat that's what we need to do I want to awake him let me just believe his word by believing his word it awakens the Christ that is in you let me tell you it builds faith in you that's why all of a sudden when you were down in the dumps oh you you got a little bit of a smile and something begins to build up what's happening it's that that Christ in you that is becoming awake you're Awakening by believing his word saying I don't have to be down I don't have to be tormented I don't have to be sick I don't have to be beat up I don't have to go through I I I got a right to be free I got a right to Victory I got a right to have joy I got a right to have peace in my life and by believing the word of God it awakens the Christ that is in you and all of a sudden it changes the circumstance you live in as a music players would come this morning say see that's what we're doing we're calling him on the scene an invisible God many people they're looking to a god that they can see but do you realize if you could see him this morning it wouldn't even be true if a man walked on this platform with a crown of thorns and nail scars in his hands and walked up here and appeared before you I would rebuke it because the Bible says he wouldn't be here he wouldn't be here during this age he won't be appeared in this time until this Earth is burned over he'll never step a foot on it in that Natural Body it wouldn't even be right it's not even scriptural any Hollywood actor could do that any little Hollywood magician can make it appear like here's a man with a crown of thorns you see if you're looking for that to be convinced you'll never be convinced because Satan's done built up enough things to keep it from convincing you well that's just an actor that's just trickery that's just lighting he's done built up enough to that you wouldn't even believe it but God had to do something that would convince you said how would he convince you he would bring his Spirit Into You The Gospel as it was preached and allowed to enter into your life and that gospel would make you identified as a Believer it would change your identity and that would convince you of who you are a son and a daughter of God see to see him his works said his gospel is preached he wants to see it he wants to see the same works that was in Jesus manifested in you this is what God Is Waiting on Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also these signs shall follow them that believe let Christ be awakened in you oh son and daughter of God oh child of God let Christ be awakened in you let him be awakened in your your worship let didn't be awakened in your going to church let didn't be awakened in your in your everyday life when you go to work let Christ be awakened in you be identified by the Gospel of Jesus Christ let the gospel be identified in you don't just stop brother Wesley just filling up a Pew that's not what we want but I want to be identified as a child of God won't you stand to your feet this morning how many say brother Matt that's the desire of my heart let him be awakened in me let me be identified with him and him be identified with me our identity has changed don't stop don't feel a Pew don't feel a Pew go all the way run the race that is set before you go all the way Paul said lay aside every weight and run the race every weight and sin that easily besets us and run with patience the race that is set before us and you know what he said he said and in this there is a cloud of witnesses a great cloud of witnesses that have gone before us so therefore run your race you know what I thought about when I read that I remember whenever I was a young man I was about the ninth grade and you know I I I was pretty fast for the kids my age but when they put us in the track team we got in there and all the kids were Juniors and seniors and may you you couldn't keep up with those guys I remember going out there and well they just they just they just beat your socks off so the coach come out one day he said well here's what we're going to do he said today we're going to learn how to run the mile some of you got to run the mile some of you going to run the 440 or relay some of you's going to run the 40 yard dash some's running the 100 yard dash some of you big boys you're going to do the shot put everybody had to have a position when we came into this race said I want youall line up on the track and then Coach gave us some advice he said now face yourself you don't want to lose all your energy at the beginning I don't know a lot about running the mile but you'll figure it out but if you get wore out your time will go down and I lined up with all them seniors and juniors and thought man here we go again but see what they didn't have at their house they lived in the city what they didn't have at their house they didn't have Village Creek and this 40 acres of pasture that was around Village Creek and the farmers had come and they made this dirt path this little Levy all the way around it where they drive their tractors around and we go out there all the time as kids and I used to love to run around that and if I ever got started I go I run all the way around that whole thing and I I don't know how far it was I never measured it but it was a pretty good it was a pretty good field it had to be a mile 40 acres so quarter quarter mile around each each segment so I I run around it all the time why I didn't know what I was training for so I come out there during that race and you know he said run with run run it and and you know just be you know pace yourself we got out there running and man they they let the gun go the whistle blow and them boys took off out there and brother Tom I got in behind them and I knew right fast if I ran at the pace they were running I would never be able to make it to the end so I just backed off like well I just can't beat them I was just a kid I can't beat them they beat me every time I raced them so it was no TR mess with trying to do it now so I just kept running by the about the second lap I still remember this like it was yesterday cuz it was a big thing for me cuz I always lost against them about the second lap they were half a track ahead of me two boys they were half a track and I looked all me I'm jogging down the track and look over there like and there ain't no way I mean how in the world are they that fast I mean what did God give them he didn't give me and I looked at their legs and looked at mine I figured it out but there are half a track ahead of me but brother Mark I just kept on kept on going kept my pace and we came around the end of that lap and I was a little bit closer started on the third lap and got about halfway around it and I was only about a 100 yards behind them and right whenever we got to the end of that third lap I thought that I had lost account of the laps and they had all made it before me and I thought because I was the only one still running that I had lost count of the laps but I still had some left in the tank so I thought I'm just going to make another lap but really they had all run out of steam and all those sprinters a third lap right when we started at the Finish Line they beat me and then I passed them and I was I was almost 3/4 of a track ahead of them I turned it on and ran around that track as free as I could I said well they may have made it but I'm going to make this in the best I could no coach he got the hollering that's the best mile I've ever seen you beat all of them they're seniors how'd you beat them I didn't know I thought they I I thought we ran more said no they they just ran out of steam you know I went on the track team and we ran and we'd go out there and run in that in that race on the track and you know what the be the best part is after you had run all these races then they put you in the relays and before long you run so many races it was you was tired by the time you got to the mile but there was something about when you come out down that last eighth of a mile and all your friends were sitting over there in the bleachers and they started hollering at you in all the schools and they had all their colors and here all your friends they got to holler it saying go Matt go give it all you got don't quit Matt go you can make it go make it to the Finish Line pass him don't let him catch you go Matt go there something about your friends encouraging you that would give you another step it would give you another boost it when you felt like giving up that would it was it would it would put something in the tank I I have an experience of that it put something else in the tank it made you run a little bit when you couldn't even feel your legs no more and you thought you was going to fall down but you just trusted by faith they were still there and you kept running gave everything that you had because there was a encouragement listen what Paul says he said run this race he said for there's a cloud of witnesses I thought isn't that something that here we had those witnesses that have gone on before us you realize what the Bible said he said Christ in you is the hope of all glory those prophets that have gone on before you they're W they're they're crying they're cheering You On th those that have died and gone on before you they're cheering your own they're the witnesses they're they're not they're not just Witnesses in Paul's day but brother Mark they're sitting there like Apostle Paul and Malachi and those prophets of old and Ezekiel and Daniel and they're looking over the banister today and they're crying out to the Bride of Jesus Christ in this age saying come on don't quit you can go another mile we prophesied about you we call we we put all of our faith knowing that you was going to make it to the end bring it home you're the last leg bring it home don't give up don't lay down don't quit don't don't quit now it ain't too heavy bring it home we gave our life for it carry it through we laid our life down they died at the tips of Roman Spears they were burned at the steak they were dumped hot oil on them and tart and feathered for this gospel and now they're crying out to you saying bring it home I wonder if there's somebody that's identified with the Gospel of Jesus Christ what an encouragement it is don't let me quit on the last leg let me bring it through let me manifest the life of Jesus Christ let me be a real son and daughter of God let me be identified in this world that there's still in the middle of Le oosa if the whole world wants to turn around let there still be a son and daughter of God in Black Rock Arkansas that'll stand for the Gospel of Jesus Christ bring it home bring it home don't quit don't give up bring it home they prophesied of you you're our hope bring it home may you bow your heads with me this [Music] morning a word of encouragement to every believer my you think about what we have a opportunity to be hear meetings coming up on Wednesday and tent meeting and so many people they need a they need a touch from God they need a real experience they don't need just need to come to a church and feel good they need a real experience they need a new birth here we have an opportunity to make an atmosphere for that to happen that the very God Of Heaven can come down and take a life and change it and dwell in it an old filthy dirty life that God would change it that's the opportunity that we have I wonder how many you lift your hands this morning and say Lord let me be present let me be identified let your gospel be identified in Me God bless youall let it be identified in me let me be a witness let me be a real testimony of the life of Jesus Christ I don't want to make excuses you know friends it's easy we could all make excuses of what other people did and why we are where we are how we got in this condition and what the other Church did did what the other Pastor did and what these other people said we could all make excuses but we didn't come to make excuses this morning we come to make everything right with God he said brother mat I want you to remember me I I I I've gone astray I just want to serve the
