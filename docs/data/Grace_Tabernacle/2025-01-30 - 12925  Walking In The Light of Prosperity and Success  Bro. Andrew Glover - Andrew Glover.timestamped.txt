[48:29] there and then we're going to turn to
[48:30] Luke 4 amen you love the Lord
[48:33] tonight amen second chronicles 20 and
[48:36] verse number 20 the Bible says and they
[48:39] Rose early in the morning and went forth
[48:41] Into the Wilderness of tcoa and as they
[48:44] went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said
[48:47] hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of
[48:51] Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God
[48:54] and so shall you be established so
[48:56] belief in God will establish a Believer
[48:59] but watch this believe His prophets and
[49:03] so shall you prosper so the belief in
[49:06] the Lord your God will establish you but
[49:09] believing in His prophets that he send
[49:11] you so shall ye Prosper one other place
[49:15] I want to look is in St Luke chapter 4
[49:17] St Luke chapter 4 it's a very very
[49:20] familiar reading brother brandom uses
[49:21] this in this in the message he preaches
[49:23] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[49:27] in Luke chapter 4 and verse number 16
[49:31] and it came to and he came to Nazareth
[49:33] where he had been brought up as his
[49:35] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[49:38] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[49:42] so he's reading from the Scrolls that
[49:45] Joshua has been told to meditate therein
[49:48] day and night he was reading from the
[49:49] Scrolls now watch this and there was
[49:51] delivered unto him the book of the
[49:54] prophet Isaiah and when he opened the
[49:57] book he found the place where it was
[50:00] written let's read that last part there
[50:02] and when he had opened the book and when
[50:04] let's read that together and when he had
[50:06] opened the book he found the place where
[50:09] it was written we ask Lord this evening
[50:12] to add the blessing to the reading of
[50:13] his word as you can have your seats here
[50:15] this afternoon I want you by the help of
[50:17] the Lord tonight I've uh taken a few
[50:19] parts here on this thought with you all
[50:21] and maybe uh just one more portion
[50:23] that's on my heart tonight we spoke to
[50:25] you on the peculiarity of life the
[50:26] believer walks in and last time we spoke
[50:29] to you on footsteps means possession
[50:31] tonight I want to speak to you on
[50:32] walking in the light of prosperity and
[50:35] success amen walking in the light of
[50:38] prosperity and success I remember here
[50:41] in 1956 brother Ry says now when a man
[50:44] will walk for God and walk with God God
[50:47] will walk with a man when a man will
[50:50] walk for God and walk with God Amen God
[50:53] will walk with a man but when that same
[50:56] individual turns his back from God then
[51:00] God just lets him shift for himself amen
[51:03] so a man that will walk with God and for
[51:06] God God will walk with that man and God
[51:09] Will Make A Way amen for that man now
[51:12] you all know we've been taught since
[51:13] little children amen that the Lord
[51:15] actually orders our footsteps I believe
[51:18] amen that the Lord orders our Footsteps
[51:21] in his word and as we were speaking to
[51:23] you last night amen this is the last
[51:25] time this is the fever season Amen to
[51:27] possess lamb there when Joshua would say
[51:30] in Joshua 13:1 he said now Joshua was
[51:33] old and stricken in years and the Lord
[51:35] said unto him Thou Art old and stricken
[51:37] in years amen and there remaineth yet
[51:40] very much land to be possessed now there
[51:43] just a refresher that word land actually
[51:45] was territory and that word possessed
[51:48] was to be Heir amen or take possess of
[51:51] Amen to destroy to bring to Ru to
[51:54] disinherit now that might be uh
[51:56] confusing that The Possession would
[51:58] actually destroy something amen but the
[52:00] reason they had to destroy something is
[52:02] because something was inhabiting their
[52:05] land that did not belong there they had
[52:07] the full inheritance but the Giants was
[52:09] on that land so God told them you go in
[52:12] and drive out the inhabitants of the
[52:14] land now there remaineth yet very much
[52:17] land not just a little or just a portion
[52:20] amen but there is very much land and
[52:22] Joshua's whole commission amen from God
[52:25] was to get the people people into the
[52:27] land of their inheritance now in Joshua
[52:30] 1:3 he says it this way every place amen
[52:33] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[52:35] upon that have I given unto you as I
[52:38] said unto Moses remember said when
[52:40] Joshua was over there walking around
[52:43] after he crossed over Jordan then be to
[52:45] eat some of the old corn he said he had
[52:47] a great vision the Lord said I will be
[52:50] with you amen just as I was with Moses
[52:53] so will I be with you called him out one
[52:55] night and said now look Joshua my
[52:58] servant Moses is dead amen now rise and
[53:01] go over this Jordan thou and all the
[53:03] host of Israel and the Lord thy God will
[53:06] be with thee no man amen shall stand
[53:09] before thee all the days of your life as
[53:11] I was with Moses amen so will I be with
[53:15] you only be good courageous do not be
[53:18] discouraged just keep moving on I will
[53:20] be with you every place that you set
[53:23] amen The Souls of your foot is a
[53:25] possession for you he said Footprints
[53:28] means possession brother and what the
[53:30] church needs tonight is some more
[53:32] Footprints over here on this land don't
[53:35] hang around Jordan too long let's get
[53:38] out here amen and see what we got every
[53:41] time that he made a footprint every time
[53:43] he footprinted on it it was a possession
[53:47] he says again Brothers it's time for us
[53:49] to make Footprints we cannot stay amen
[53:51] right here in this same camp the fire
[53:54] amen is moving on so let's move move on
[53:56] from glory to glory amen and from Bible
[53:59] experience to Bible experience amen is't
[54:02] that powerful Amen brother Joe from
[54:04] glory to glory amen and from Bible
[54:07] experience to Bible experience let's
[54:09] unfold and open up our hearts and raise
[54:12] up our hands to God but let's keep
[54:14] saying and let's stay in the Bible don't
[54:17] get outside of that amen stay right
[54:20] there following the word of God let me
[54:22] say to you we are not looking back to
[54:24] what God has done for us
[54:26] amen we are looking forward to what he
[54:28] is going to do said that's been the
[54:31] problem is men has always looked back
[54:33] amen and they've seen what God done and
[54:35] they've looked forward to see what God's
[54:37] going to do amen and they are missing
[54:39] what God is doing right in front of them
[54:42] listen you say I'm going to have a Bible
[54:44] experience what can I tell you amen it's
[54:46] not going to be handed to you amen
[54:48] you're going to have to pick up a sword
[54:50] amen and fight for every experience that
[54:52] you get the prophet of God said anything
[54:55] that's handed to you on a platter amen
[54:57] you don't enjoy it certainly you can't
[54:59] appreciate whatat give to you and God
[55:01] told Moses I give you Palestine amen
[55:04] I've swept out all the houses hung up
[55:06] the curtains you all just go right up
[55:08] there and live there would that have
[55:10] been it they never would have enjoyed it
[55:13] he said but I'll give it to you but it's
[55:15] full of giants amen you'll have to fight
[55:18] every inch of the way amen but every
[55:20] place the soul of your footsteps amen
[55:23] that is a possession amen go and take
[55:26] make it sure as I was with Moses amen I
[55:29] will be with you listen when they
[55:31] receive the Revelation that my footprint
[55:34] Amen on a promise is my possession it
[55:37] removed the need for God to come down in
[55:40] a Corporal body and remind them what
[55:42] you're standing on is yours they
[55:45] received a revelation if I can just put
[55:47] my foot on it amen I've got a right to
[55:50] claim it because God has already given
[55:52] it to me let me say to you tonight
[55:54] listen we don't have to go back and get
[55:56] saved amen every service or go back and
[55:58] do the first works over when God Saves a
[56:01] man and gives him the Holy Ghost he is
[56:03] sealed until the day of his Redemption
[56:06] he is not sealed from one service to the
[56:08] next he is not sealed from one Camp to
[56:10] the next he is not sealed from one tent
[56:12] meeting to the next he is sealed until
[56:15] the day of his Redemption and every time
[56:18] you make a mistake there is a blood amen
[56:21] an atoning blood and a powerful blood to
[56:24] forgive you and tell you amen get back
[56:27] up and keep on walking you got land to
[56:29] possess I believe it I believe it's time
[56:32] to walk around unafraid I believe it's
[56:34] time to walk around not a fearful amen I
[56:37] believe it's time to walk around in the
[56:39] land of our inheritance how many knows
[56:42] in the Old Testament there was a Joshua
[56:45] amen and there was a Caleb do you know
[56:48] in this last day there is again another
[56:50] Joshua and Caleb brother said like this
[56:53] let me read this to you he said now let
[56:55] us stand like Jos josua and Caleb our
[56:57] promised land is coming inside amen even
[57:00] as their's dead he said now Joshua means
[57:03] Jehovah Savior and he represents the end
[57:07] time leader that will come to the church
[57:09] even as Paul came as the original leader
[57:13] amen so Joshua represents a prophet amen
[57:17] coming to an age as a leader amen with
[57:20] the word he said but Caleb represents
[57:23] those amen that stay true with Joshua
[57:26] amen so there was an end time leader
[57:28] amen but there was an end time follower
[57:31] amen of the end time leader listen I
[57:33] don't know maybe some are ashamed of it
[57:35] or embarrassed of it amen but I am not
[57:37] ashamed Amen to say I have found my type
[57:40] in the scripture I know I'm not Joshua
[57:44] amen but I have received a revelation
[57:46] that I am Caleb and I have recognized my
[57:49] Joshua therefore I will follow my Joshua
[57:52] and as I follow Joshua amen oh I come on
[57:55] Church amen I just can't help but preach
[57:57] for a second Amen brother said the
[57:59] greatest Revelation that Joshua was God
[58:02] Amen as I was with Moses amen so will I
[58:05] be with you remember said what was that
[58:07] Revelation that all the mistakes amen
[58:10] that Moses made God never left Moses and
[58:13] he said brother Travis If God stayed
[58:15] with Moses in the face of all of his
[58:18] mistakes he said then I know amen he
[58:20] will stay with me well come on church
[58:23] was there one God for Moses and one God
[58:25] for Joshua and another God for Caleb the
[58:28] same God of Moses was the same God of
[58:31] Joshua was the same God of Caleb and if
[58:33] the god stayed with Moses and God stayed
[58:36] with Joshua he's going to stay with
[58:38] Caleb come on bride of Christ amen he
[58:41] stayed with this prophet and he's going
[58:43] to stay with you you say I got mistakes
[58:46] that don't make no difference your
[58:48] mistakes don't change the Revelation
[58:50] that as I was with Moses so will I be
[58:54] with you remember God Israel amen as a
[58:57] virgin with his word but they wanted
[59:00] something different see amen so did the
[59:02] last day church God did not move Israel
[59:05] or let her go into the promised land
[59:08] until it was his own appointed
[59:11] time now the people might have put
[59:13] pressure on Joshua and said the land is
[59:16] ours let's go take it Joshua you're all
[59:18] through you must have lost your
[59:20] commission you don't have the power that
[59:22] you used to have see you used to hear
[59:24] from God and you used to know the will
[59:27] of God and act amen quickly something is
[59:29] wrong with you amen but Joshua was a
[59:32] godsent prophet and he knew the promises
[59:36] of God so he waited for them he waited
[59:39] for a clearcut decision from God and
[59:42] when the time came to move amen God
[59:45] placed the full leadership somebody say
[59:47] full leadership the full leadership into
[59:50] the hands of Joshua because he stayed
[59:53] with the word see God could trust Joshua
[59:57] but he could not trust the others amen
[59:59] so will it repeat in this end day amen
[1:00:02] the same problems and the same pressure
[1:00:05] now there was a Joshua and there was a
[1:00:07] Caleb can I tell you what Caleb's
[1:00:09] responsibility was amen Caleb's
[1:00:12] responsibility amen was to stay with
[1:00:15] Joshua screams it out keep and step with
[1:00:18] Joshua he said get the new grapes and
[1:00:20] the new Pentecostal wine Heen get drunk
[1:00:23] on it brother you won't even look to the
[1:00:25] world anymore he said oh let us go
[1:00:28] forward amen following the steps of our
[1:00:31] great leader amen and Conquer remember
[1:00:34] God told Joshua brother them footsteps
[1:00:36] means possession he said now listen amen
[1:00:40] keep your eyes on Jesus amen the Joshua
[1:00:43] the leader amen just keep moving on
[1:00:46] deeper depths and higher Heights until
[1:00:49] you possess everything that God promised
[1:00:51] you in his word amen don't you stop
[1:00:54] moving until you possess everything amen
[1:00:58] that God has promised you in his word
[1:01:00] can I say something to you not everybody
[1:01:03] can receive this it is hid to the eyes
[1:01:05] of the world it is foolish to them but
[1:01:08] those who are born and elected to
[1:01:10] eternal life amen they believe it we see
[1:01:13] the hour We're living so let's go
[1:01:15] forward amen remembering this that we

[1:18:02] gifts light amen but we are walking in
[1:18:04] the light of the fullness of the word
[1:18:07] notice he was the word made light or
[1:18:09] became light the word in that generation
[1:18:13] he was speaking of Jesus he was the word
[1:18:16] light of that generation why was he the
[1:18:18] word light of that generation brother
[1:18:20] Jared because the prophets of old had
[1:18:23] spoke of him and here he come and
[1:18:26] Vindicated he was the light of God's
[1:18:29] spoken word all the prophets had said
[1:18:32] had been fulfilled in him the prophets
[1:18:35] back here amen with the word so when you
[1:18:38] seen Jesus you did not have to go back

[1:18:44] you didn't have to go back to Isaiah's
[1:18:46] prophecy when you seen Jesus brother
[1:18:48] Carter you didn't have to go back and
[1:18:50] read what Moses said you were looking
[1:18:52] after fulfillment of what the prophets
[1:18:54] had head in the manifestation of the

[1:21:12] experience when you say you love this
[1:21:14] message amen it want to shack up

[1:22:00] become young that is the message of the
[1:22:04] hour yes sir then if we are walking in
[1:22:07] the god-given light of the hour then God
[1:22:10] takes the word that's given for the hour
[1:22:13] and vindicates
[1:22:15] it just like he did in Genesis 13 He
[1:22:19] said let there be light you say who you
[1:22:22] after the devil and spirit
[1:22:25] let there be light and light come forth
[1:22:27] his word went forth and light followed
[1:22:30] it and cleared away the mist and the
[1:22:34] Darkness went to one corner and the
[1:22:36] light shined on the other side remember
[1:22:40] said that's the gross Darkness that's
[1:22:41] upon the churches and things today to
[1:22:43] fail to see amen the light that
[1:22:47] shineing come on anden if you're going
[1:22:50] to help somebody tell them about the

[1:22:55] somebody if you love them tell them
[1:22:57] about the word come on church amen you
[1:22:59] know what the definition of insanity is
[1:23:01] right brother Bobby they've been doing
[1:23:03] the same thing over and over expecting a
[1:23:05] different
[1:23:07] result so they've been preaching the
[1:23:09] same ideas for hundreds of years and
[1:23:11] ain't changed nothing amen so somebody
[1:23:13] trying to put a little message flavor to
[1:23:15] it ain't going to do nothing either we
[1:23:17] had to come out of the world's light to
[1:23:20] walk in the pillar of fire he said no
[1:23:22] man will never see it it's only the
[1:23:25] predestinated seed that's going to
[1:23:27] receive it but we've come to the place
[1:23:29] again that the Bible said you are the
[1:23:32] light of the world can I say what a
[1:23:34] prophet said Shalom 1964 and in this
[1:23:37] hour that we're living in now the EV
[1:23:40] indicated word of this hour Pentecostals
[1:23:43] you say speaking in tongues and so forth
[1:23:45] that was the day of Pentecost that was
[1:23:48] the light of the hour then see but this
[1:23:51] is another day he's the light of the
[1:23:54] hour today so brother John he brought
[1:23:57] that light down amen for more than just
[1:24:00] it is the light of the hour he said but
[1:24:02] he notice not it the gift amen but he
[1:24:06] the person amen The Giver is the light
[1:24:09] of the hour the word is light when it's
[1:24:12] Vindicated until the word is Promised
[1:24:14] for the day is a Vindicated then it's
[1:24:17] not light it cannot be there is a lot of
[1:24:19] the hour today that is Jesus Christ in
[1:24:22] the power of His res Resurrection his
[1:24:25] word that is Promised for this day what
[1:24:27] is his word promised for this day Eagles
[1:24:29] The Works that I do amen shall you also
[1:24:32] sorry I'm just feeling the Liberty right
[1:24:34] now the works that I do shall you do
[1:24:36] also and greater than this shall you do
[1:24:38] for I go to the father Works greater
[1:24:41] than he did do you believe it I believe
[1:24:43] it it seems humble it seems like it goes
[1:24:45] over the top of the people's head look
[1:24:47] when he was here on Earth how could you
[1:24:49] do Greater Works I've translated it many
[1:24:51] times amen it's not greater it's more
[1:24:54] the same thing there is what the
[1:24:56] evidence of the holy spirit is amen now
[1:24:58] some of y'all Amen Let The Devil beat
[1:25:00] you around a bush all the time do I have
[1:25:02] the Holy Ghost do I not do I have the
[1:25:04] Holy Ghost do I not it's been a month
[1:25:06] since I felt him it's been a week since
[1:25:08] I felt like shouting it's been a week
[1:25:09] since I felt like dancing amen can I
[1:25:11] tell you what a prophet said there is
[1:25:13] what the evidence of the holy spirit is
[1:25:15] is believing the word of God when it's
[1:25:18] manifested for he was the word
[1:25:22] manifested well glory to God the only
[1:25:25] evidence there is is when a man believes
[1:25:28] the written word come on somebody say
[1:25:31] well that's just simple no that's a
[1:25:32] powerful thought church when you can
[1:25:34] believe the written word that is the
[1:25:37] evidence of the Holy Spirit when it is
[1:25:39] Vindicated and you believe it and you
[1:25:42] walk in the light of it Jesus was the
[1:25:44] light of the
[1:25:46] hour because he was the promised word of
[1:25:49] the hour and he tried to tell them so
[1:25:51] but they were too much in darkness to
[1:25:54] understand it amen so it is today now
[1:25:58] listen how did Jesus bring confusion
[1:26:01] upon them by identifying himself as the
[1:26:04] written word in Luke 4 and: 16 he came
[1:26:08] to Nazareth when he had been brought up
[1:26:10] and as his custom was he went into the
[1:26:12] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:26:14] up for it to read and there was
[1:26:16] delivered in him the book of the prophet
[1:26:18] Isaiah and when he had opened the book
[1:26:21] oh church I can preach there and when he
[1:26:23] had opened the book he found the place
[1:26:25] where it was written he could not find
[1:26:28] the place that was written of him
[1:26:30] brother Emanuel till he opened the book
[1:26:32] listen neither can you find a place to
[1:26:34] stand and whip that devil that's trying
[1:26:36] to kill you until the book has come open
[1:26:39] but may I announce unto you tonight amen
[1:26:41] Seven Seals have been revealed the third
[1:26:44] pool has been manifested the seven
[1:26:46] Thunders have fluttered listen the book
[1:26:48] is open come and see your place in the
[1:26:51] written

[1:27:01] Caleb come and see you're a part of the
[1:27:05] rapturing generation yes sir when the
[1:27:08] book was open he found the place where
[1:27:12] it was written then if he had recognized
[1:27:14] the one they were talking about of being
[1:27:16] a prophet look like they would have seen
[1:27:18] right there that same Prophet oh God
[1:27:21] picked up the word again
[1:27:25] amen the same Prophet picked up the word
[1:27:29] again and began to reveal it which he
[1:27:34] was the word I love this and was
[1:27:37] revealing himself by
[1:27:40] mouth oh God

[1:27:48] longer just heing the sick revealing who
[1:27:51] he is he's no longer just raising the
[1:27:53] Dead revealing who he is but now by his
[1:27:57] own confession Hallelujah Now by his own
[1:28:01] confession he is revealing who he is oh
[1:28:04] church of living God I think it's time
[1:28:06] to change the way you talk about
[1:28:07] yourself I think it's time to quit

[1:29:01] soul he began to reveal himself by the
[1:29:04] word that was written of him he began
[1:29:07] and started from Moses and explained to
[1:29:10] them all the prophets had said then he
[1:29:12] said fools and slow a heart knowing that
[1:29:15] Moses and all the prophets said Christ
[1:29:17] must suffer and enter in his glory see
[1:29:19] for that age that's what's supposed to
[1:29:20] take place don't you know he's supposed
[1:29:22] to do that see
[1:29:24] revealing oh
[1:29:27] God revealing the written word of
[1:29:33] him I don't have time to preach on that
[1:29:36] he found the word and it became his
[1:29:42] confession we also hear Jesus as I
[1:29:44] follow amen as I follow the scripture

[1:30:01] among the church right amen a greater
[1:30:03] witness would come among the church now
[1:30:06] look here he found the place where it
[1:30:09] was written and he said this now you
[1:30:11] won't receive me but another will come
[1:30:14] and come in his name and him you will
[1:30:16] receive we can join a Creed another we
[1:30:19] can join the denomination and you'll
[1:30:21] receive him but you but when you receive
[1:30:24] Jesus it's different another will come
[1:30:27] and I'll say I'm a Methodist I'm a
[1:30:28] Baptist I'm a presbyterian and you'll
[1:30:30] receive that all right but I come in my
[1:30:33] father's name doing what the father said
[1:30:35] I would do and you receive me not he
[1:30:39] said John came he had a great witness
[1:30:41] but I have a greater witness in God in
[1:30:44] God than what John did for what the
[1:30:46] father has given me to do amen that I do
[1:30:50] also listen the words that was written
[1:30:54] of him what he must be in that day can I
[1:30:57] just tell you a prop amen a prophetic
[1:30:59] profession is that okay he says this he
[1:31:02] says say it all together in one Accord I
[1:31:04] believe that Jesus Christ is alive and
[1:31:07] here now confirming this word of the
[1:31:10] hour the prophecies that was written of
[1:31:12] him has now been fulfilled in our midst
[1:31:17] come on Zion you are the Bride of Jesus
[1:31:20] Christ and David wrote about you and you
[1:31:22] know what he said he said God is in her
[1:31:25] midst and she shall not be
[1:31:29] moved God is in her midst and she shall
[1:31:32] not be moved he said say it in one
[1:31:34] Accord he is my savior let's say that
[1:31:37] together he is my savior he is my God he
[1:31:41] is my king he is my all and all then
[1:31:45] what does that make you that makes you
[1:31:47] children of the Word of Promise he said
[1:31:50] oh my The Word of Promise came to the
[1:31:52] Virgin Mary but that word a promise was
[1:31:54] he himself to be made manifest not a
[1:31:57] Creed the person he said God was made
[1:32:01] manifest he himself acted at the same
[1:32:04] time and fulfilled his own Word of
[1:32:06] Promise in the Virgin it was an angel
[1:32:08] that had brought her the message but the
[1:32:10] Angel's message was the word of God come
[1:32:15] on Church there's been a seventh angel
[1:32:17] that has brought you a message but his
[1:32:20] message
[1:32:21] is are you with me yes sir but his
[1:32:24] message is the word of God Isaiah 9 and6
[1:32:28] he fulfilled at the time all that was
[1:32:31] written of him because she accepted his
[1:32:34] word to her because Jesus accepted the
[1:32:37] word and found the place that was
[1:32:39] written of himself and chose to walk in
[1:32:42] it rather than what the scoffers thought
[1:32:44] of him all of a sudden brother Benji he
[1:32:46] became a Mystic ain't that something he
[1:32:49] was not a Mystic until the word come
[1:32:52] open oh God he was not a Mystic until
[1:32:55] the word come open and he found the
[1:32:58] place that was written of himself and he
[1:33:00] identified that I am he that is speaking
[1:33:03] there and they then turned and said
[1:33:05] you're a
[1:33:08] Mystic you're weird yeah you know why
[1:33:11] they think you're weird because you
[1:33:13] think you're just as much a part of this
[1:33:15] Bible as Moses
[1:33:16] was you know why they think we're a
[1:33:19] Mystic is because we are convinced by
[1:33:21] scripture and Supernatural vindication
[1:33:24] that William brandom is just as much a
[1:33:26] part of this Bible amen as John the
[1:33:28] Baptist was you know why they think
[1:33:30] we're Mystic is because we don't welcome
[1:33:32] psychology into our pull pits to fix our
[1:33:35] homes you know why they think we're
[1:33:37] Mystic is because we stand on the old
[1:33:40] Holiness landmarks and we preach a man
[1:33:42] ought to look like a man and a woman
[1:33:44] ought to look like a woman and a church
[1:33:46] ought to operate as a church well you
[1:33:47] know what I say I don't care what they
[1:33:50] think about me I know who I am I know
[1:33:53] where I come from I know where I'm going
[1:33:56] call me a Mystic if you want to I found
[1:33:59] my place in the word of God and I refuse
[1:34:02] to walk in anything
[1:34:09] else Jesus lived in a world that no one
[1:34:12] knowed about he was an odd person he
[1:34:15] lived in a world of perfect faith and
[1:34:17] the perfect God in which he was that's
[1:34:20] the way it is to all believers they're a
[1:34:22] Mystic and so when a man lives by faith
[1:34:24] and walks by faith I mean substance
[1:34:26] Faith he is isolated from the entire
[1:34:29] world am I reading that
[1:34:31] right and becomes I like it whoever said
[1:34:35] it and becomes said exactly and be
[1:34:37] somebody been reading and becomes a new
[1:34:39] creature in Christ there now you're
[1:34:42] getting into bride material see you're
[1:34:45] getting into rapturing condition sir
[1:34:48] when you come into a world of faith
[1:34:51] alone with God that means for each one
[1:34:53] of us not just the pastor not just the
[1:34:56] deacons not just the trustees that means
[1:34:59] for the
[1:35:00] Ley come on church amen it'll get very
[1:35:03] lonely if it's just preachers walking in
[1:35:05] this
[1:35:06] world come on it'll get very lonely if
[1:35:08] it's just the deacons or just the
[1:35:10] trustees I say it ought to be our
[1:35:12] youngest of children amen walk in this
[1:35:14] world you say what do you mean by walk
[1:35:16] in this world he said you're baptized
[1:35:18] into this kingdom and there's nobody in
[1:35:20] there but you and God and he gives the
[1:35:22] orders and you pack them out whatever he
[1:35:25] says there's not a Shadow of Doubt
[1:35:27] nowhere you walk right on if the Lord
[1:35:30] says this there's nobody in the world
[1:35:32] can talk you out of it you go right on
[1:35:35] just the same woo glory to God now
[1:35:39] you're coming into perfect Faith perfect
[1:35:42] Perfection that cannot fail that faith
[1:35:44] never fails yes he was a Mystic to them
[1:35:47] with this perfect faith and so it is now
[1:35:49] with fol who have perfect Faith are a
[1:35:52] Mystic to others can I tell you
[1:35:54] something how many can be honest and say
[1:35:56] I've been tempted to the devil this
[1:35:59] week sir I've been tempted to the devil
[1:36:04] today did you get out of
[1:36:07] bed I've been tempting the devil today
[1:36:10] we all have but you know why we're
[1:36:12] Mystic is because when Satan tempts us

[1:36:18] perfect word just like Jesus did come on
[1:36:23] Church that's why you're here tonight is
[1:36:25] you got the ability Brother David to
[1:36:27] shake the devil off that's why you're
[1:36:29] here tonight brother Bobby is God has
[1:36:31] put something in your soul by
[1:36:34] revelation God sent a prophet to open
[1:36:37] the word and to show you the place that
[1:36:40] was written of you and he turned to John
[1:36:42] 14:12 and said sister kareim that's you

[1:42:03] the light of
[1:42:05] instruction Joshua only be thou strong
[1:42:08] and very courageous that thou mayest
[1:42:10] observe to do all according to the law
[1:42:13] that thou mayest Prosper whether soever
[1:42:16] thou
[1:42:18] goest this book of the law I'm closing
[1:42:20] on this shall not depart out of thy
[1:42:25] oh church this word shall not depart out
[1:42:30] of thy mouth amen which is how Jesus
[1:42:34] revealed himself when he found himself
[1:42:38] in the book and thou shalt meditate
[1:42:41] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:42:43] observe to do according to all that is
[1:42:44] written therein for then shall thou make
[1:42:46] thy way prosperous and then shalt thou
[1:42:48] have good success I love what Ram says
[1:42:51] he said Joshua remembered his commission
[1:42:54] let not this book of the law my word
[1:42:59] depart out of your mouth I love when
[1:43:01] brother says in other words he says in
[1:43:03] other words Joshua I don't care what the
[1:43:06] tribe says I don't care what the clergy
[1:43:09] says you stay with this word for then
[1:43:15] Thou shalt make thy ways prosperous
[1:43:18] Joshua if you can just keep the
[1:43:20] confession of my word in your mouth
[1:43:24] Hallelujah if you can just keep the
[1:43:26] confession of this word in your mouth
[1:43:29] you're going to prosper and have good
[1:43:31] success look what David said he said
[1:43:34] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:43:37] the counsil of the
[1:43:40] ungodly you got to quit walking in the
[1:43:42] counsil of what people think you ought
[1:43:44] to be
[1:43:45] doing when is contrary to what God has
[1:43:48] revealed that you ought to be
[1:43:51] doing I got tight there it's ungodly
[1:43:56] counsel walketh not in the counsel of
[1:43:58] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:44:01] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:44:04] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:44:06] of the
[1:44:08] Lord and in his law do he meditate day
[1:44:11] and night he shall be like a tree
[1:44:14] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:44:15] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[1:44:17] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[1:44:20] whatsoever am I reading this right
[1:44:22] Psalms 1
[1:44:23] 13 and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:44:28] prosper am I am I reading that right yes
[1:44:31] sir whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:44:34] John said beloved I wish above all
[1:44:36] things that thou May prosper and be in
[1:44:38] health even as thy Soul Prosper look at
[1:44:41] this word Prosper it means to lead by a
[1:44:43] direct and easy way yes sir if you can
[1:44:48] obey the word there is a victory in love
[1:44:51] divine you say brother that was the hard
[1:44:54] way but in reality it was the easy way
[1:44:57] because it was the way that God had
[1:44:59] chosen for his servant to walk in and
[1:45:02] prosper amen remember said there's a
[1:45:04] thirst for Success people spend
[1:45:06] thousands of dollars to send their
[1:45:07] children to school and do universities
[1:45:09] and colleges and so forth get an ed
[1:45:11] education to be successful they called
[1:45:13] in life but now I have nothing against
[1:45:15] that now that's all right but to me you
[1:45:17] could get all the schooling in the world
[1:45:20] and still you haven't found the right
[1:45:22] success say because that will just
[1:45:25] temporarily make things a little easier
[1:45:27] for you here but when you die you'll
[1:45:29] leave all that behind you listen and
[1:45:32] this entire economy that we
[1:45:35] have can I just say something to you
[1:45:38] don't lose sight of the Rapture because
[1:45:41] the promise of a booming
[1:45:45] economy the world's view of success and
[1:45:48] prosperity is different than God's view
[1:45:51] of success and prosper
[1:45:53] Satan through sin builds the people up
[1:45:55] with a great Prosperity or a good time
[1:45:57] going to the nightclubs said what he's
[1:45:59] doing is he's only building you up
[1:46:03] brother Joe for a great let
[1:46:06] down can I can can I leave you with this
[1:46:09] tonight he does it in the religious
[1:46:11] realm as well yes sir said Prosperity is
[1:46:15] not always a sign that God is with you
[1:46:17] he said people think that Prosperity is
[1:46:19] a sign of a spiritual blessing that's
[1:46:21] exactly contrary another Place usually
[1:46:23] Prosperity causes sin because many
[1:46:25] people look upon Prosperity as blessings
[1:46:28] it would be if we could handle it right
[1:46:29] but it usually leads to sin and
[1:46:31] dishonoring God I'm just saying what he
[1:46:33] said he said Prosperity sometimes is a
[1:46:36] hindrance he said now man calls
[1:46:38] Prosperity sometimes religion but
[1:46:41] Prosperity will blind people's eyes from
[1:46:45] the word of God you me prove it to you
[1:46:48] he said I talked to a man the great
[1:46:49] religious Realms the other day they said
[1:46:51] to me God proves it he's with us why we
[1:46:53] grow last year brother Brandon I forget
[1:46:55] how many hundreds like that I said
[1:46:57] that's not one bit of approval uh-huh
[1:47:01] that's right prostitution increased last
[1:47:03] year about 30% did that show God was
[1:47:06] with prostitution he said no sir I said
[1:47:09] sure see what Prosperity does is it can
[1:47:12] paralyze your
[1:47:13] faith good said we had a little we had a
[1:47:16] little breath of prosperity went off
[1:47:17] into building programs lost old
[1:47:19] fashioned Pentecostal blessing used to
[1:47:20] fall Among Us got a new car a new house
[1:47:22] raised on a job brother said what we did
[1:47:24] is we forget God when Prosperity comes
[1:47:27] in like that he said that's what America
[1:47:29] done they turned their heads that's what
[1:47:31] the church has done he said but Lord and
[1:47:33] IET I'm closing right here I'm feeling
[1:47:35] good there's a good atmosphere here
[1:47:36] tonight lord it's y'all's
[1:47:40] fault Lord in our great Prosperity Satan
[1:47:42] has blowed his poisonous breath again
[1:47:45] and he said the days of Miracles has
[1:47:46] passed there's no such a thing as the
[1:47:48] Holy Spirit there's no such a thing as a
[1:47:50] new birth he said Lord God what walk in
[1:47:53] on your
[1:47:54] promises walk in on your promises and
[1:47:57] show to your people that you still live
[1:48:00] and save them from the breath of Satan
[1:48:04] somebody say are you preaching against
[1:48:05] buildings I'm not are you preaching
[1:48:07] against blessings I'm not I'm preaching
[1:48:09] against replacing the opening of the
[1:48:12] word with something else to whip the
[1:48:14] devil with we are children of promise
[1:48:17] and the power of God is no longer just
[1:48:20] in the book it is now walking in us he
[1:48:24] said God said in Genesis 2 they were
[1:48:25] Gods because they had full domain over
[1:48:27] the Dominion of the world he give them
[1:48:29] Dominion of all things brother we are
[1:48:31] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:48:33] sons of God who will come back and take
[1:48:36] it over again we are waiting for the
[1:48:38] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[1:48:40] up to the top when the full sons of God
[1:48:42] will be manifested are y'all ready for
[1:48:44] this are you ready for this when the
[1:48:47] power of God will walk out
[1:48:53] that's good did I read that right when
[1:48:55] the power of God will walk out and will
[1:48:58] take every Power that Satan's Got Away
[1:49:03] amen from
[1:49:05] him can I tell you this tonight as our
[1:49:07] musicians are coming when you get up and
[1:49:09] walk out of this building you are the
[1:49:11] power of
[1:49:13] God Amen walking right
[1:49:16] out you say I'm the power of God sir yes
[1:49:21] you say how can you say that because
[1:49:23] Jesus found the place that it was
[1:49:25] written and when he found that place it
[1:49:28] released a power in his life sir to
[1:49:31] resist the devil yes sir with a perfect
[1:49:33] Faith Amen in the perfect
[1:49:35] word believe in the Lord your God yes
[1:49:38] sir and you shall be
[1:49:40] established Believe In His
[1:49:42] prophets and you shall prosper
[1:49:46] amen that's
[1:49:48] good can I hone it way way way way way
[1:49:51] way way way way way way way way way way
[1:49:55] way way way down for you
[1:49:57] tonight we say things like marriages are
[1:50:00] falling apart homes are falling apart
[1:50:03] churches are falling
[1:50:05] apart we say things like that family's
[1:50:08] falling apart we say things like that
[1:50:10] Ministry is falling apart we look at the
[1:50:13] world and we look out there and we say
[1:50:15] my I tell you what look at that look
[1:50:17] what's happening there but can I can I
[1:50:19] bring it into perspective to you tonight
[1:50:23] the only reason we're
[1:50:25] prospering is we have
[1:50:29] acknowledged we have acknowledge the
[1:50:31] words of a
[1:50:32] prophet that's the success of this
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:36] church come on Grace
[1:50:39] Tabernacle there's churches that start
[1:50:41] with a lot more than this church started
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:44] with is this
[1:50:46] okay they start with a lot more brother
[1:50:50] Bobby they start with about five or six
[1:50:51] hundred members

[1:50:57] all kinds of worldly views and popcorn
[1:51:00] nights and movie Nights oh yeah in a few
[1:51:03] years it falls
[1:51:06] apart but have you ever stopped and
[1:51:09] thought that nearly six years
[1:51:12] ago in a barn on the side of a
[1:51:16] road a man and his family decided to
[1:51:20] acknowledge the words of a prophet
[1:51:23] and build a place I didn't mean that
[1:51:24] that is the first time they acknowledged
[1:51:26] it they built a place that those words
[1:51:29] could be acknowledged
[1:51:36] unadulterated and this church is
[1:51:38] prospering because of the message of the
[1:51:41] hour and the minute you want to become
[1:51:43] another statistic lay the message
[1:51:46] aside the minute you want your young
[1:51:48] people to become another statistic lay
[1:51:50] what a prophet set aside
[1:51:53] but if you walk in the
[1:51:55] light if you walk in the light if you
[1:51:58] walk in the light of
[1:52:00] instruction it may get hard for a while
[1:52:03] but way down the road it's going to pay
[1:52:08] off are you hearing me

[2:15:02] the word of the Lord over my life I
[2:15:05] wonder if there's anybody else can lift
[2:15:06] their hand and claim that as their own
[2:15:09] that's the word of the Lord over your
[2:15:11] life it don't matter what the devil says
[2:15:13] about
[2:15:14] it that's what God's word said about it
[2:15:17] isn't that wonderful how many enjoyed
[2:15:18] that message tonight amen
[2:15:26] amen just want to remind the church um
[2:15:28] the the brother Wayne's the church is
[2:15:32] having the the youth banquet in Ohio
[2:15:35] Lima it's on February the 8th online you
[2:15:37] can find the sign up uh form for it we
[2:15:40] encourage you to go um we just uh uh I
[2:15:44] know it's quite a ways to go but
[2:15:45] certainly would be a joy to be there
[2:15:48] brother Joe will be going up and taking
[2:15:51] the Thursday night service and then
[2:15:53] they'll have some activities for the
[2:15:54] young people on Friday and then on
[2:15:57] Saturday have the youth banquet and
[2:15:59] brother Ray will be speaking there on
[2:16:01] the uh Sunday following at the home
[2:16:04] church so anybody that could go I'm
[2:16:06] certain it would be a blessing to you
[2:16:08] also as uh we go I want to remember uh
[2:16:12] brother Wesley was been sick and still
[2:16:15] working and know that's a miserable
[2:16:17] feeling just ask the Lord to touch his
[2:16:19] body and strengthen him also brother
[2:16:20] Dave margar ask the church for prayer
[2:16:23] tonight sick in his body too so as we go
[2:16:26] let's just remember these in prayer and
[2:16:28] ask Lord just to strengthen our brother
[2:16:30] for pouring his heart out and allowing
[2:16:33] God to be able to use him I believe God
[2:16:35] has wonderful gifts Among Us that if we
[2:16:40] can open up to receive them that God can
[2:16:43] use them to speak to us just like he
[2:16:44] does I just believe that I don't believe
[2:16:47] church is a carnal thing I don't think
[2:16:49] it's some place that we go to take up
[2:16:52] time or space but we come to hear the
[2:16:53] word of the Lord that's why whenever I
[2:16:56] when I hear these ministers preaching I
[2:16:59] love to I love to hear preaching I know
[2:17:01] I preach a lot but I love to hear
[2:17:02] preaching because it's edifying it gives
[2:17:05] you strength the Bible says iron
[2:17:06] sharpens iron and I always draw
[2:17:08] something from it so I appreciate our
[2:17:10] brothers laboring before the Lord uh to
[2:17:13] bring a word that is that is relevant
[2:17:15] and on time and God never fails amen
[2:17:19] when you get a gift that is surren
[2:17:20] surrender to God and a people that are
[2:17:22] surrender to God God never fails to do
[2:17:24] something for his people so I just thank
[2:17:26] him for that tonight let's just bow our

[2:17:44] all that been done and said Lord we ask
[2:17:47] you to continue Lord those that have
[2:17:49] been sick Lord to continue to to lift
[2:17:51] them and touch them and Lord I pray you
