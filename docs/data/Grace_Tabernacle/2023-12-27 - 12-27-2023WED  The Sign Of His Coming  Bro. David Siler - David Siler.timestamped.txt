[32:41] disciples came to him to show him the
[32:44] buildings of the temple and Jesus said
[32:47] unto them see you not all these things
[32:51] verily I say unto you there shall not be
[32:54] left here one stone upon one another
[32:59] that shall not be thrown
[33:01] down and as he sat upon Mount
[33:04] olives the disciples came unto him
[33:07] privately saying tell
[33:09] us tell us when these things shall be
[33:13] and what shall be the sign of thy
[33:17] coming and of the end of the world again
[33:21] verse three as he sat upon Mount olives
[33:24] so Matthew 24: 1 and 2
[33:28] actually took place in ad30 on Tuesday
[33:31] morning and then in that afternoon that
[33:34] Tuesday afternoon they go to mount
[33:37] olives and the Bible says as he sat upon
[33:40] the Mount of Olives disciples came unto
[33:42] him privately saying tell us when shall
[33:45] these things be what shall be the sign
[33:48] of thy coming and of the end of the
[33:52] world so's in prison now
[33:55] 1963 just a pick up this subject says
[33:58] there will be a Ministry that'll show
[34:00] great wonders Joel said so as Jesus
[34:03] first preached and was rejected that
[34:06] same ministry will have to repeat again
[34:10] what if that could be the third pull
[34:12] Jesus's Ministry when he was Healing The
[34:15] Sick he was wonderful that young prophet
[34:18] of Galilee why he makes the blind to
[34:21] seea even raised the dead but one day he
[34:24] turned around and he said you generation
[34:26] of vipers you make the outside of the
[34:29] platter clean you appear to be holy but
[34:33] the inside of you the inside of you
[34:37] you're nothing but a bunch of snakes oh
[34:40] when that prophecy went forth condemning
[34:42] that organization didn't it change they
[34:45] turned against him that's right and
[34:47] finally by rejecting him they crucified
[34:51] him I'd like to use that for a subject
[34:52] tonight and speak on the sign of his
[34:56] coming let's just by our hearts heavenly
[34:58] father thank you tonight for the reading
[34:59] of the word I pray Lord that you would
[35:02] just help me now Lord as you Lord shove
[35:05] my Humanity aside and Lord may you just
[35:08] anoint us tonight to be able to look
[35:10] into your word you see every need that
[35:13] is represented in this place tonight and
[35:15] I just pray Lord that you would come and
[35:17] minister to the heart of your people
[35:19] Lord we're living in a day where
[35:21] Revelation is so important and your
[35:24] Prophet tells us we should pray for
[35:26] revelation more than anything else so
[35:29] tonight Lord when we look into these
[35:31] things I pray Lord Make It Real to us
[35:34] may our eyes be illuminated I ask now
[35:36] father use us For Your Glory we'll be so
[35:39] careful to give you the praise in the
[35:41] name of Jesus Christ and everybody said
[35:44] amen God bless you tonight you can be
[35:47] seated we know when it comes to Matthew
[35:50] chapter 24 that Matthew 24 is dealing
[35:54] with the subject of the coming of the
[35:56] Lord and Jesus is telling his disciples
[36:00] as he comes to this place in Matthew 24
[36:03] as as the prophet picks it up in the six
[36:06] seal on Matthew 24 and we know that all
[36:10] Seven Seals lays in Matthew 24 whenever
[36:14] the prophet preaches the Seven Seals and
[36:17] then he finally gets down to the Sixth
[36:18] Seal which is speaking about the
[36:20] tribulation period he actually takes in
[36:23] that message and goes back to Matthew 24
[36:26] and he shows how that the seals lays in
[36:29] Matthew 24 but the problem is no other
[36:32] teacher in the world has ever took the
[36:35] Seven Seals from Matthew 24 many of
[36:38] theologians preach the seven seal from
[36:40] Matthew 24 or the coming of the Lord but
[36:43] they don't tie the rest of the seals in
[36:45] there but when it comes to the end time
[36:47] ministry this message come to be able to
[36:50] make the Bible a new book to us to
[36:52] illuminate what already lays within the
[36:55] word so Matthew 24 is going to actually
[36:59] deal with his coming so when Jesus comes
[37:01] to this Temple and he's actually walking
[37:04] through the temple he shows them the
[37:06] buildings that are in this Temple no
[37:08] doubt the temple was beautiful as they
[37:10] come through it now remember this is the
[37:12] first temple that they're looking at no
[37:15] doubt that it's beautiful uh it's an
[37:17] incredible sight to be able to behold
[37:20] people from all over Israel they would
[37:22] come keeping the Feast of the Lord they
[37:24] would come into that Temple to be able
[37:26] to Worship in that Temple they would
[37:28] bring their sacrifices in to be able to
[37:31] worship and the temple was a beautiful
[37:34] attraction as far as looking at it from
[37:36] the outside appearance it was a
[37:39] beautiful place that they had built
[37:41] they've taken so many resources to be
[37:43] able to build this to make it so so big
[37:46] and so beautiful and we know that the
[37:48] temple is the temple being built from
[37:50] the tle Tabernacle in the wilderness to
[37:52] Solomon's Temple now to this Temple it
[37:55] would be built by three courts pattern
[37:58] it would be the outer courts the inner
[38:00] courts and then the holies of holies and
[38:02] you would think where would they get
[38:03] this mentality to be able to build this
[38:06] kind of a temple well if you'll remember
[38:08] back in the book of Exodus that Moses
[38:10] was actually caught up by Vision into
[38:13] the heavens as Paul tells us in the book
[38:15] of Hebrews that he actually saw in
[38:17] heaven exactly what God wanted upon the
[38:20] Earth so Moses saw the pattern of a
[38:23] three-fold Tabernacle in the heavens and
[38:25] that's what God wants upon the Earth and
[38:28] I'll say this not only does God want
[38:30] that in the natural Tabernacle in the
[38:33] wilderness and Solomon's Temple and this
[38:35] Temple but when it come to your temple
[38:37] you would be built up of the same way
[38:39] you'd have an outer Court an inner court
[38:42] and then you would have a soul so when
[38:44] it come to this Temple it was an
[38:46] attraction amongst Jerusalem and the
[38:48] people would have to take and make their
[38:50] Voyage down and their pilgrimage down to
[38:52] where the Tabernacle is and they was
[38:55] using the beauty beuty of this Temple
[38:57] let think about it they was using the
[39:00] beauty of this Temple to be able to
[39:02] validate how great that they was they
[39:05] was using the outside appearance to be
[39:08] able to validate how spiritual they are
[39:11] how much understanding they are and they
[39:13] was using the temple itself as an
[39:16] identity that if we've got this kind of
[39:18] a temple then God must be with us and if
[39:21] you don't believe that God is with us
[39:23] look how big our temples are look how
[39:26] big our churches are look how many
[39:29] programs we got we got all types of
[39:31] schools all kinds of programs we built
[39:33] things anybody follow me tonight look at
[39:35] our Temple and by looking at our temples
[39:38] you can tell that God must be with us or
[39:40] we wouldn't have these kind of temples
[39:43] so they're showing him I'm going to use
[39:45] that tonight to be able to paraphrase
[39:47] back and forth so they're using the
[39:49] temple showing what is taking place
[39:51] spiritually in their lives by looking at
[39:54] what they possess naturally so they're
[39:56] looking at the outside to be able to
[39:59] identify truly God must be among us or
[40:02] we wouldn't have what we have and so
[40:05] when they come to Matthew 24 Jesus comes
[40:08] there and they're looking at the temple
[40:10] and then he comes out in Matthew 241 and
[40:13] he shows them the buildings that are
[40:15] around the temple and Jesus is going to
[40:18] let the disciples know he's telling them
[40:21] do not allow this attraction to be a
[40:24] distraction don't allow the temporary to
[40:27] be able to take your eyes off of what
[40:30] God really wants you to see don't allow
[40:33] the temples and I'll say this today in
[40:35] this age don't allow the structures
[40:38] don't allow the numbers don't allow the
[40:41] members to distract us from really what
[40:43] God is doing in this hour and Jesus is
[40:47] letting them know don't allow it to be
[40:49] this attraction to become a distraction
[40:53] and the temple that you're looking at
[40:55] think about this Temple that you're
[40:57] looking at it's got so much Beauty
[40:59] that's all the way around it but I want
[41:01] to tell you it's only a temporary
[41:03] building the mortar listen the mortar is
[41:06] temporary the blocks are only going to
[41:09] be temporary the building itself won't
[41:12] even last as a matter of fact th coming
[41:14] a day these stones that you're looking
[41:16] at right here and no doubt they was
[41:19] gigantic Stone they won't be one left
[41:21] upon another and the things that are
[41:24] around you are only temporary and he's
[41:26] letting them know don't get your eyes up
[41:29] on that don't allow that to be the
[41:31] attraction to think that that's a
[41:33] measuring stick for spirituality don't
[41:35] allow that to come to your mind to think
[41:38] that if you got this then truly God must
[41:40] be among us get your eyes off of
[41:43] temporary Tabernacles get your eyes off
[41:46] of temporary things get your eyes off of
[41:49] your temporary Temple and your temporary
[41:52] mortar and your temporary don't get your
[41:55] eyes up on that don't get your eyes on
[41:58] your flesh it'll be a distraction from
[42:00] the real attraction that is inside of
[42:03] your
[42:04] soul Hallelujah so get your eyes off of
[42:08] temporary things because I want to
[42:11] announce to you as Jesus would show them
[42:13] the day of the Lord is coming now
[42:16] whenever you see that phrase in the
[42:18] Bible every time you see that phrase
[42:21] it's speaking about the day of judgment
[42:23] or the tribulation period that's going
[42:25] to come upon the Earth so you read it
[42:27] through the Old Testament talks about
[42:28] the day of the Lord Malachi picks it up
[42:30] behold I'll send you Elijah to the
[42:31] prophet for the great and wonderful day
[42:33] of the Lord it's speaking about the time
[42:35] of judgment so Jesus is telling them
[42:38] don't get your eyes on this judgment's
[42:40] coming get your eyes on the word and get
[42:43] your eyes on Truth get your eyes on what
[42:46] God's doing oh my and I want to tell you
[42:49] that same spirit that was upon the
[42:51] people of that day is the same spirit
[42:54] that is right here in Le Osa tonight
[42:56] tonight they've got their eyes upon the
[42:58] wrong thing the Asen the Pharisees the
[43:02] herodians they could not see the word
[43:04] being manifested right in front of them
[43:07] so whenever they did not have the
[43:09] ability to scripturally identify the
[43:12] word coming to fulfillment they simply
[43:14] turned it down and they rejected it and
[43:17] they said he's just another preacher
[43:18] he's another man like John the Baptist
[43:20] he got his head cut off this man will be
[43:22] here for a few days and he's gone but
[43:25] look at our Temple our Temple's going to
[43:27] be here whenever this man is gone just
[43:29] like when John's gone this Temple's
[43:31] going to be staying here and Jesus says
[43:34] don't get your eyes on it boys I'm
[43:36] telling you that's not the attraction
[43:38] that's a distraction from the real
[43:39] Temple can you imagine the temple of God
[43:43] was walking around in shoe leather and
[43:45] they're looking at the wrong Temple they
[43:48] got their eyes on the brick but listen
[43:50] they should have had their eyes upon the
[43:52] real Temple that was standing in front
[43:54] of them and the real Temple that was
[43:56] standing there fulfilling the word they
[43:58] rejected him whenever he
[44:00] came they rejected truth yes now let me
[44:04] say it like this and I'm tying this with
[44:06] our day they knew the law by
[44:09] education they knew it by intellectual
[44:12] conception but they could not see the
[44:14] Fulfillment of it by Revelation so I
[44:17] tell you what's more important education
[44:20] or
[44:21] Revelation what's more important being
[44:24] educated or being real I have nothing
[44:26] against education and I'll just tell you
[44:28] tonight I don't believe brother Ram had
[44:29] anything against education where brother
[44:31] Ram stood against education was is when
[44:34] man tried to use their education to find
[44:37] God that's when the prophet condemed
[44:39] education but as long as we're here
[44:41] we're going to have to go to college and
[44:42] learn things to be able to get by but
[44:44] listen the first time we try to use that
[44:46] education to identify where God is or
[44:49] try to identify how great God is that's
[44:51] when that IDE education becomes a
[44:53] distraction from the attraction
[44:59] lord well that just felt good that just
[45:01] fell right out of Heaven amen don't
[45:04] allow to become a distraction so now
[45:06] watch what's taking place the Kingdom of
[45:09] Heaven is at hand and Jesus's time upon
[45:13] the Earth is coming to an end so he's
[45:16] coming as we understand SP spiritually
[45:19] he's coming to the place of the third
[45:22] pool of his ministry which is the time
[45:24] of rejection now remember every Ministry
[45:28] Noah's Ministry Jesus's Ministry this
[45:31] ministry today the revealing of the son
[45:32] of man every Ministry that has a third
[45:35] pull will actually do the same thing
[45:37] there will be a rejection of that
[45:39] Ministry so because of the blindness of
[45:42] these people and it overwhelms me
[45:45] because after all the signs that was
[45:47] done all the Wonders that was performed
[45:49] all the Miracles the supernatural that
[45:51] was done over and over again the things
[45:53] that had been done it was all of that
[45:55] was was not enough to get their
[45:57] attention the blind coming open the dumb
[46:00] speaking and the lame walking you would
[46:02] think they could identify Isaiah's
[46:04] prophecy but they're so spiritually
[46:06] blind that they cannot even see the
[46:08] Fulfillment of the word taking place
[46:10] right in front of them the religious
[46:13] people of that day had rejected Jesus's
[46:16] message and now he comes to the third
[46:19] pool of his ministry and that third pool
[46:22] is coming into effect now notice that
[46:25] Jesus is going to warn them he's going
[46:27] first of all he's going to give them
[46:29] opportunity he's going to give them
[46:31] chance after chance after chance after
[46:33] chance after chance after chance and no
[46:36] matter how many signs is done how many
[46:38] miracles is done they're going to walk
[46:40] right away they're going to call him be
[46:41] Els above they're going to call him a
[46:43] devil and so Jesus warns them of
[46:46] Prophecy he warns them of something that
[46:48] is fixing to take place and he's letting
[46:50] them know judgment's fixing to strick
[46:53] this Temple that judgment destruction is
[46:56] coming among them what's he speaking of
[46:58] ad70 with the Roman general Titus was
[47:01] going to come in he's letting them know
[47:03] you're not safe in this Temple you're
[47:05] not safe right here in Jerusalem
[47:07] judgment's coming to this place make
[47:09] sure that you flight not being the
[47:11] winner make sure that you leave here
[47:13] don't get caught in these walls make
[47:15] sure that you're not with suckling child
[47:17] at that time don't be like judgment is
[47:19] coming he's trying to warn them of a
[47:22] prophecy of 70 years that's fixing a
[47:24] take place and he's trying to let them
[47:26] know don't be caught up looking at this
[47:28] Temple make sure you're ready to
[47:31] escape do I even have to say it make
[47:34] sure you're ready to escape he's telling
[47:38] them judgment's coming so they rejected
[47:41] his ministry they have concluded by
[47:44] education that he is false and when they
[47:47] rejected his message Jesus has got to
[47:51] pronounce judgment upon that land right
[47:53] now watch Jesus's message was sent to
[47:57] liberate the
[47:59] elect right and to condemn the systems
[48:02] of that day now watch the third pull it
[48:06] comes to do something for the elect but
[48:09] it comes to condemn the systems of that
[48:12] day the religious systems must be judged
[48:16] the religious systems must be condemned
[48:19] and the religious systems is a cursed
[48:22] system so Jesus's ministry under the
[48:25] third pool because they are spurning the
[48:27] mercy of God away he must come because
[48:30] of the rejection of the message of Grace
[48:32] the message of Salvation the message of
[48:35] the light they're turning it down and
[48:36] Jesus said they love the darkness more
[48:39] than they do the light and because of
[48:41] that judgment's going to be pronounced
[48:43] this is not Jesus being mean this is not
[48:46] Jesus with some type of hate oh no he
[48:48] don't want to pronounce judgment but
[48:50] judgment only comes after Mercy is
[48:53] rejected only after Mercy has become
[48:56] Stern as judgment come from the mouth of
[49:00] Jesus you see the same thing has
[49:02] happened in this day only after Mercy
[49:05] has been poured out over and over again
[49:07] they reject Jesus the same way they did
[49:09] there they do it here now they called
[49:12] him all kinds of names they refused to
[49:14] be identified with him don't you see the
[49:16] parallel of this age in so much that the
[49:19] Bible tells us in the Book of Revelation
[49:21] chapter 3 that Jesus was put outside the
[49:24] church and he was knock and trying to
[49:26] get back in why did he get put out they
[49:28] failed to recognize he was among them
[49:31] they called it middle telepathy they
[49:33] called it all some type of a spirit of a
[49:36] man they called him always a stargazer
[49:38] and he just reads mine but I want to
[49:40] tell you they missed it the same way
[49:42] that these Pharisees missed it it was
[49:44] more than that Jesus had come in and the
[49:47] son of the Messiah was being produced
[49:49] and they didn't even recognize who he is
[49:52] and the final pull of his ministry was
[49:55] their last opportunity oh listen to that
[49:59] the final pull of his ministry was their
[50:01] last opportunity the thing that they
[50:04] should have recognized quicker than
[50:06] anybody else they failed to see it Jesus
[50:09] come to be a redeemer he come to be
[50:12] their savior he come to be the Messiah
[50:16] he come to be the
[50:17] king but he came to his own and his own
[50:21] received it not think about this for 30
[50:26] years for 30 years this man's alive but
[50:30] he don't even start his ministry until
[50:33] he's
[50:34] 33 a Ministry that lasts three years we
[50:37] talk about Jesus we read the story do
[50:39] you really understand the man only
[50:41] preached for three years three years and
[50:45] remember when he started preaching is
[50:47] when John the Baptist went to prison
[50:50] that was a sign and the Bible said when
[50:52] he saw that that was the sign that he
[50:53] was to go forth so he is going to preach
[50:56] for three years watch this three years
[50:58] his ministry is going to be there it'll
[51:00] start it'll begin and it'll end within
[51:03] three
[51:05] years three
[51:07] years the foundation of everything that
[51:10] we believed is within three
[51:14] years every events tied to this coming
[51:17] the entire Old Testament pointed to this
[51:19] moment now watch it's only a couple of
[51:23] days Matthew 24 it's only a few days
[51:26] before he's arrested he's fixing to be
[51:28] arrested he's fixing to be he's fixing
[51:31] to take and be beaten to be whip but
[51:33] notice just before just before the final
[51:37] rejection and the crucifixion you get to
[51:39] Matthew 24 Matthew 21 Matthew 22 and
[51:45] Matthew 23 is the last of the public
[51:48] Ministry of
[51:49] Jesus it's the ending of his public
[51:51] Ministry and let me just say it like
[51:53] this first Paul and second PS come to
[51:56] the end so it ends with Matthew 23
[52:00] Matthew 23 is Jesus if you read Matthew
[52:03] 23 Jesus is condemning the systems he's
[52:05] coming against the Pharisees coming
[52:07] against the systems of that day it's the
[52:09] ending of his public Ministry because
[52:11] Matthew 24 he's going to go to mount
[52:14] olives actually leaves the temple and
[52:16] he's going to go to mount olives do you
[52:17] know what the Bible said he did when he
[52:19] went to mount oliv his disciples took
[52:21] him apart
[52:23] privately privately
[52:26] not publicly privately so whatever Jesus
[52:30] is going to tell them it's not going to
[52:32] be a public Ministry but notice under
[52:35] the third pool privately privately not a
[52:38] public show it's not something
[52:40] everybody's going to see but he takes
[52:42] them to the mountain privately and he
[52:44] reveals to them the entire book of The
[52:47] Seven Seals now they didn't understand
[52:49] it but Jesus preached the entirety of
[52:51] the mystery of the seals underneath his
[52:54] private Ministry of the third poor after
[52:57] he had become
[53:00] rejected it is astounding when the Lord
[53:02] showed me this the how that Matthew 21
[53:05] 22 23 and 24 so ties together to the
[53:09] ministry of the son of man in this day
[53:11] do you understand that same time has
[53:14] happened in the day that we're living in
[53:16] after a man comes off of the mountain
[53:18] which was an attraction he comes back
[53:20] that watch he Jesus was on that mount
[53:23] Olivas he comes down goes to the Temple
[53:25] goes back up on Mount olives and I want
[53:28] to tell you friends that's exactly what
[53:30] has happened in this hour a mighty Angel
[53:32] has descended under Revelation 10 1-7 he
[53:36] come down off the mountain went back
[53:38] East preached the revelation of the
[53:39] Seven Seals which is the third pool to
[53:42] the elect which is the opening of The
[53:44] Seven Thunders that God would issue
[53:46] forth to wake the bride
[53:49] up how
[53:52] privately
[53:53] privately so he goes to mount olives to
[53:56] preach to his elect the masses are not
[53:59] gathered he doesn't have people it's not
[54:02] the lame coming it's not the blind
[54:04] coming it's only his
[54:07] elect that is listen those who has
[54:10] followed his message so they've received
[54:13] first pull and second pull but he
[54:17] gathers them together to reveal the
[54:18] third pull which is Matthew 24 the
[54:21] revealing of the Seven Seals notice in
[54:23] the anointed ones at the end time the
[54:25] prophet picks this thought up on on the
[54:27] third pool and he said first pull
[54:29] healing second pull prophesying third
[54:34] pull opening of the
[54:37] word the Mysteries
[54:39] revealed so the third pull then is the
[54:43] Mysteries he said remember you that
[54:44] spiritual he said you should have caught
[54:46] that the other day do you realize
[54:48] Matthew 24 and 25 deals with end time
[54:52] prophecy it's the mysteries of the
[54:54] Kingdom of Heaven because Matthew 22 24
[54:56] and 25 has nobody else speaking it's
[54:59] written and
[55:00] read Hallelujah because Jesus is going
[55:04] to answer the three questions that came
[55:06] to the disciples When shall these things
[55:08] be what is the sign of thy coming and
[55:10] what is the sign of the end of the world
[55:11] he's going to answer all pre questions
[55:14] but notice it wasn't going to be given
[55:16] just to everybody it ain't going to be
[55:18] just given to anybody but it's to those
[55:20] who is a part of the initiated who's
[55:23] received the revelation of the hour who
[55:25] has not rejected his ministry who's not
[55:28] rejected his message listen the
[55:30] Pharisees ain't there the Sadducees
[55:31] ain't there but he Reveals His secrets
[55:34] to his elect only notice s in prison the
[55:38] third PO he said while I was under that
[55:40] I thought this what day are we living in
[55:43] watch this question what day are we
[55:45] living in could this be the third pool
[55:50] I've got some notes here I want you to
[55:52] watch his notes he says I've got some
[55:56] notes Here well I'd like to know what
[55:59] his note says and his note says watch
[56:03] where he goes and Jesus we find out
[56:06] Jesus in his ministry after he preached
[56:10] to the people after his public Ministry
[56:14] now we're going to be real scriptural on
[56:16] this after Jesus had finished his
[56:19] ministry his ministry was rejected by
[56:23] the people now notice after after the
[56:27] time where he offers dispensation of
[56:29] mercy and mercy and opportunity upon
[56:32] opportunity but when he comes to the end
[56:34] of his M public Ministry now it's going
[56:36] to be a private Ministry because only
[56:39] the elect is going to have ears to hear
[56:41] what the spirit is saying to the church
[56:43] he could have preached it they would
[56:44] have never have caught it but it's only
[56:46] to those that's got an ear to hear what
[56:49] the mystery is being
[56:51] revealed and he said Jesus finished his
[56:54] ministry was rejected by the people
[56:56] watch his next statement now you'll read
[56:58] between the
[56:59] lines you'll read between the lines and
[57:03] draw your own
[57:06] conception I just like the word he used
[57:09] draw your own
[57:11] conception remember what I told you at
[57:13] first after he had preached notice he
[57:17] says Jesus had clearly came identified
[57:20] himself after he preached he clearly
[57:23] came and identified himself self and he
[57:26] prophesied and after the days of his
[57:29] prophecy through those scripturally
[57:32] identified and the church said though
[57:35] scripturally I he wasn't trying to hide
[57:37] from them he wasn't trying to pull the W
[57:39] over their eyes he scripturally was
[57:41] identified among them and they couldn't
[57:43] see it the same way they can't see
[57:45] Malachi 4 the same way they can't see
[57:47] Revelation 101 they cannot see it
[57:50] because they're blind even though it's
[57:52] scripturally identified amen
[57:55] those script identified the people
[57:57] rejected him that's right and he
[57:59] preached then he preached then after
[58:04] they rejected him
[58:06] here oh God could it be friends could it
[58:10] be those that reject this gospel think
[58:13] about it those that turn it down and
[58:16] they go to organization denomination all
[58:19] types of things put their names on
[58:21] church books what are they prisoners
[58:23] Souls
[58:25] in
[58:26] prison I hope you're
[58:28] seeing so Matthew 21 now watch let's get
[58:31] to 21
[58:33] 2223 Matthew 21 takes place at the end
[58:37] of his ministry now watch brother said
[58:39] he scripturally identified himself well
[58:40] let's just find out where he did so he
[58:43] comes to Matthew 21 it takes place at
[58:46] the end of his ministry the prophet
[58:48] picks this thought up at the end of his
[58:51] ministry and watch the attraction on the
[58:54] mountain yeah so he picks up the
[58:57] attraction on this mountain Mount olives
[59:00] and he's going to identify the
[59:02] attraction on Mount Sunset so he's
[59:04] dealing with the attraction on the
[59:07] mountain now look it is the end of his
[59:10] public Ministry and Jesus in Matthew 21
[59:13] he's coming to fulfill the Old Testament
[59:16] scripture of Zechariah 99 now catch this
[59:20] I want you to understand Zechariah 9:9
[59:25] prophesied Zechariah prophesied of both
[59:28] advents of the coming of the Lord not
[59:30] only did Zechariah prophesy about both
[59:33] advents Malachi prophesied about both
[59:36] advents so he prophesied of the first
[59:38] coming of Christ and he prophesied of
[59:41] the second coming of Christ so Zechariah
[59:43] 9:9 is the prophecy of the coming of the
[59:46] Messiah the king that he's going to come
[59:48] to Jerusalem and then he prophesied the
[59:51] second one in Zechariah 14 where he said
[59:53] in the evening time there shall be light
[59:57] so the only other Prophet to do that's
[59:59] Malachi so he prophesies of both comings
[1:00:02] remember Malachi said behold I sent my
[1:00:03] messenger before my face he prophesied
[1:00:06] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:00:07] Lord first coming of the Elijah Ministry
[1:00:09] and the last coming of the Elijah
[1:00:10] Ministry Now watch how this unfolds
[1:00:13] Zachariah speaks of a time that the king
[1:00:17] is going to become identified publicly
[1:00:19] among the people he's going to be
[1:00:22] identified publicly among the people
[1:00:25] so Isaiah actually preaches or Zechariah
[1:00:28] actually declares this
[1:00:30] 487 years before it happens Zachariah
[1:00:34] prophesies of his coming do you know
[1:00:36] what that means Zachariah will be dead
[1:00:40] several years before his prophecy comes
[1:00:43] to pass and I wonder how many people
[1:00:46] called Zachariah a false prophet because
[1:00:49] his prophecy still
[1:00:51] lingered Zachariah speaks of a Time that
[1:00:54] the king's going to come and he says it
[1:00:57] like this in verse n what the way this
[1:00:59] prophecy is written Rejoice greatly oh
[1:01:03] Daughters of Zion now watch who he is
[1:01:06] speaking to Rejoice you Daughters of
[1:01:09] Zion shout Daughters of Jerusalem notice
[1:01:14] he's calling them daughters which means
[1:01:17] they're The
[1:01:18] Offspring they're the progeny and he
[1:01:21] called them the progeny watch you're not
[1:01:24] the proy of a Pharisee you're not the
[1:01:26] progy of a sadducee you're the prophecy
[1:01:29] of Zachariah you are the you are the
[1:01:31] progeny of Zion you're the progeny of
[1:01:35] Jerusalem hallelujah amen you've got
[1:01:39] opportunity you're in the right place

[1:01:42] right place for the visitation you've
[1:01:44] got opportunity so the seed of Jerusalem
[1:01:47] is in the right place all thanks
[1:01:49] spiritually friends don't you realize
[1:01:51] that you had to be in the right place
[1:01:52] you wonder how you come to this message
[1:01:54] and you may chalk it up oh it's Daddy's
[1:01:56] idea Grandpa's idea I want to tell you
[1:01:58] it's God's idea you may be the seed of
[1:02:01] somebody that has believed it and left
[1:02:03] it but you're still standing on because
[1:02:05] God pricked your

[1:02:11] he says Behold thy King look how
[1:02:14] personal thy King cometh unto thee he is
[1:02:19] just having salvation lowly riding upon
[1:02:23] an ass and upon a cold and the fall of
[1:02:25] an ass remember he's on Mount olives but
[1:02:28] now watch now he's got to descend off of
[1:02:33] the
[1:02:35] mountain he's got to
[1:02:37] descend oh listen if he's going to
[1:02:40] fulfill Zechariah 9 the King has got to
[1:02:44] descend into Jerusalem listen what I'm
[1:02:48] telling you he cannot remain in heaven
[1:02:51] he cannot remain on the mountain that

[1:02:59] salvation he can't remain in the in the
[1:03:01] heavens he's got to descend into
[1:03:03] Jerusalem I want to tell Jesus had to
[1:03:06] come down and become a man he had to
[1:03:08] come all the way down and become a human
[1:03:10] being he could not remain in the heavens
[1:03:12] he had to descend off the
[1:03:16] mount and when he does Zachariah is
[1:03:19] telling us telling the people when you

[1:04:08] other age has known he's going to sound
[1:04:10] with seven Thunders that nobody's going
[1:04:12] to understand but the elect in the last
[1:04:15] days and at the end of his ministry
[1:04:17] watch here he comes to fulfill Zechariah
[1:04:20] 9 remember Matthew tells us Matthew 24
[1:04:24] 21 and4 watch what he says and all this
[1:04:27] was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:04:30] which was spoken by the
[1:04:32] prophet do you realize what Jesus was
[1:04:35] doing watch the sign of his coming what
[1:04:37] Jesus was doing he was fulfilling the
[1:04:40] spoken word of Isa of of
[1:04:42] Zachariah so in order to come to this
[1:04:45] day he must fulfill the spoken word and
[1:04:49] when the spoken word is fulfilled notice
[1:04:51] when is it going to happen at the end of
[1:04:53] his ministry under the third pool
[1:04:56] Matthew 21:5 it's going to fulfill that
[1:04:59] which was spoken by the prophet saying
[1:05:00] tell the daughter of Zion tell
[1:05:03] her you can't tell her unless somebody's
[1:05:06] caught it tell the daughter of Zion
[1:05:09] Behold thy King comth Jesus even
[1:05:12] believed in Preachers tell them the do
[1:05:14] tell the daughter of Zion tell The
[1:05:16] Offspring of Jerusalem tell the sea tell
[1:05:18] the progeny tell them that there are
[1:05:20] Kings coming under thee how's he coming
[1:05:23] he's coming meek sitting upon an ass and
[1:05:25] upon the coat of the fo of an ass and
[1:05:27] let me say this those days of him riding
[1:05:30] into Jerusalem and Matthew 21 those are
[1:05:33] days of Mercy those are days of light
[1:05:37] that is days of opportunity upon
[1:05:39] opportunity all they had to do was come
[1:05:42] out and bow this was a public offering
[1:05:45] to the people he was offering himself as
[1:05:47] the king to the people and he's given
[1:05:49] them opportunity to be able to receive
[1:05:51] the
[1:05:52] word he descended listen he didn't
[1:05:55] descend P down into Egypt that ain't
[1:05:57] where he descended to he didn't descend
[1:05:59] up into Ethiopia notice where he went he
[1:06:02] went right to where they're at I believe
[1:06:04] this America will burn hotter than any
[1:06:06] other Nation do you know why because God
[1:06:09] revealed himself right here in this
[1:06:11] nation right here the people that had
[1:06:13] more op there ain't no language barrier
[1:06:15] you don't have to get it through an
[1:06:16] interpreter and I want to tell you I
[1:06:18] believe that the ashes of America will
[1:06:20] burn harder than the ashes of solom and
[1:06:22] gamorra because of the works that is
[1:06:24] been done right here in our
[1:06:28] nation it descend right into the
[1:06:30] religious Capital the religious
[1:06:32] headquarters of the world here comes the
[1:06:34] King right into headquarters and when he
[1:06:37] came in listen to this verse eight a
[1:06:39] very great
[1:06:41] multitude spread their garments in the
[1:06:44] way praise God they cut down branches
[1:06:48] from the trees and stro them in the way
[1:06:51] now watch there's an anointing that's
[1:06:53] coming with you
[1:06:54] and the anointing is following the
[1:06:58] word the anointing is following the king
[1:07:02] the anointing is following the word and
[1:07:04] there was some people that was there
[1:07:06] that did not reject him that did not
[1:07:09] turn him down but they got under the
[1:07:11] anointing of the hour and they begin to
[1:07:13] scream and they begin to holler and they
[1:07:15] begin to cut down branches from the
[1:07:17] trees they was moved to worship there
[1:07:20] was an anointing to worship among them
[1:07:24] and the Bible says in the multitudes
[1:07:26] that went before that followed crying
[1:07:28] sing Listen what they're saying
[1:07:31] hosana hosana to the son of David
[1:07:35] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:07:38] the Lord look what they say
[1:07:40] hosana to the highest hosana is not only
[1:07:45] a term of
[1:07:47] adoration but do you realize hosana was
[1:07:51] originally an appeal for a deliver to
[1:07:54] come and help
[1:07:56] them listen so when he comes off the
[1:08:00] mountain they're crying this is him
[1:08:04] they're appealing to a King this is him
[1:08:07] they're saying hosan deliver savior
[1:08:12] salvation helper hosana to the highest
[1:08:15] Lord come Deliver us they are crying and
[1:08:18] they're appealing to God and they're
[1:08:20] letting him know what's going on they're
[1:08:22] fulfilling their part
[1:08:24] Jesus is fulfilling his part and the
[1:08:27] daughters of Zion are fulfilling their
[1:08:29] part I want to say not only has the son
[1:08:32] of man done his part not only has the
[1:08:35] king done his part but God seen you
[1:08:38] saying amen he seen you Clapping Your
[1:08:40] Hands he seen you rejoicing because the
[1:08:43] daughters of Zion spiritually is the
[1:08:45] bride and we must
[1:08:52] Rejoice notice verse 10 and when he come
[1:08:55] into
[1:08:56] Jerusalem watch how this is so twofold
[1:08:59] all the city was
[1:09:01] moved all the
[1:09:04] city in other words you couldn't sit and
[1:09:07] not know something's going on you
[1:09:09] couldn't sit in your closet and hide
[1:09:11] from it something's going on not just
[1:09:13] some of the city all the city was moved
[1:09:16] I want to tell you the Revival that
[1:09:18] struck this nation you couldn't hide
[1:09:20] from it you couldn't run from it you
[1:09:22] couldn't cross the sea get away from it
[1:09:24] it was a universal
[1:09:28] Revival and he said the all the city was
[1:09:31] moov saying who is
[1:09:34] this who is this look at the question
[1:09:38] who is this the people that knew the
[1:09:41] word is asking
[1:09:44] who the people that studied the Torah
[1:09:48] they should have recognized what's
[1:09:50] taking place but they're not seeing it
[1:09:54] so they say who who is this but I want
[1:09:57] to tell you somebody's catching
[1:10:00] it somebody's catching it do you realize
[1:10:04] the Bible said they was moved in that
[1:10:06] word literally means it caused a tremble
[1:10:09] in that City it caused it to shake to
[1:10:11] agitate the mind so before there's a
[1:10:15] physical earthquake there's going to be
[1:10:17] a spiritual one Hallelujah anybody
[1:10:20] hearing what I'm saying before there's
[1:10:22] physical earthquakes it takes place
[1:10:24] under the Sixth Seal the seventh seal is
[1:10:26] going to produce a supernatural
[1:10:28] spiritual earthquake to awaken the bride
[1:10:30] up so it shakes Jerusalem Jesus come
[1:10:33] riding in a spiritual awakening is going
[1:10:36] on there's an announcement that's taking
[1:10:38] place that's what I want to say there's
[1:10:39] an announcement that's taking place a
[1:10:41] declaration is being made in so much
[1:10:44] that it stirred the minds of the people
[1:10:46] that they had to forsake everything else
[1:10:48] and say who is
[1:10:50] this Matthew 21:11 and the multitude
[1:10:53] said said this is Jesus the prophet of
[1:10:57] Nazareth of Galilee now watch what he
[1:11:01] does he comes from
[1:11:03] Jerusalem he goes straight to the
[1:11:06] headquarters and then after he gets done
[1:11:08] with headquarters he goes to the temple
[1:11:12] watch the Bible Jesus the prophet Azar
[1:11:14] verse 12 and Jesus went into the temple
[1:11:18] of God watch what he's gonna do so he
[1:11:22] comes off the mountain by Str the Palm
[1:11:24] leaves in front of him and Jesus goes
[1:11:27] straight to the
[1:11:28] temple so the
[1:11:30] temple is going to the
[1:11:34] temple the word is going to the
[1:11:37] temple he's been delivered there by a
[1:11:42] cult somebody's packing this word in
[1:11:45] it's being carried in it's been adorned
[1:11:48] it's being worshiped rejoicing why it
[1:11:51] comes in and he goes straight to the
[1:11:54] temple and the Bible said in verse 12
[1:11:56] and when he went into the temple of God
[1:11:58] he cast out watch what the word does he
[1:12:00] cast out all of them that sold and
[1:12:02] bought in the temple over through the
[1:12:04] tables of the money changers and the
[1:12:06] seats of them that sold doves now watch
[1:12:09] he comes in at Passover that's why
[1:12:12] they're up there selling doves he comes
[1:12:15] in at Passover he comes to the temple
[1:12:18] listen to that here is the Passover Lamb
[1:12:22] coming to the temple at the temple
[1:12:24] coming to the temple during the time the
[1:12:27] Passover Lamb is coming during the time
[1:12:28] of
[1:12:30] Passover and when he comes into the
[1:12:32] temple it's a
[1:12:34] mess there's no sanctity I'm preaching
[1:12:38] everybody right now the temple must be a
[1:12:40] place of sanctity there's no Godly
[1:12:42] reference there's no Godly fear think

[1:17:27] is they're only coming in and giving
[1:17:31] offering they was allowing the listen
[1:17:34] there was prelates that was coming and
[1:17:37] they was allowing the prelates to be
[1:17:39] able to exchange their
[1:17:41] coins it's not personal it don't mean
[1:17:44] nothing are you hearing me it's not a
[1:17:48] personal experience it's an
[1:17:51] obligation just by lamb any lamb will do
[1:17:55] just go to church any church will
[1:17:59] do God never told him to do that in the
[1:18:01] law you know what the law says be thou
[1:18:03] set apart in other words it's got to be
[1:18:06] personal don't just take any lamb take
[1:18:09] the lamb that you got and give it to the
[1:18:10] Lord and here he comes to this Temple
[1:18:12] let me go he's here he comes to this
[1:18:14] Temple and he finds the temple corrupt
[1:18:16] and they're exchanging coins for the
[1:18:17] prelates and the people coming from the
[1:18:19] other countries around and they was
[1:18:21] giving them the correct coin of Judea so
[1:18:22] they was spend the coin of Judea and
[1:18:24] they were selling them something to
[1:18:25] offer right and Jesus walks in and he
[1:18:29] sees this mess going on he goes into
[1:18:32] their churches and he ask them are you a
[1:18:34] Christian I have you know I'm Baptist
[1:18:37] you a Christian I have you know I'm
[1:18:38] Methodist and when he hears this he's
[1:18:40] offended at it so when Jesus went into
[1:18:44] the temple he purged it yes he did and
[1:18:47] when he purged it it caused a spiritual
[1:18:49] earthquake in the land it shook the
[1:18:51] religious order of that day day he
[1:18:53] turned the tables
[1:18:55] over let me just put it like this cuz a
[1:18:58] lot of people don't like this sweet kind
[1:19:01] loving precious gentle forgiving Jesus
[1:19:04] picks up a
[1:19:06] whip you ever hear some preachers preach
[1:19:09] it they preach it greasy Easy Greasy
[1:19:11] always just sweet love kind and just
[1:19:13] lovable teddy bear Jesus I want to tell
[1:19:16] there's two sides of that story story he
[1:19:18] is just as much God in judgment and in
[1:19:21] Justice he's just as much God in mercy
[1:19:23] and forgiveness as he is and
[1:19:27] judgment how many knows the Judgment of
[1:19:29] God is just as awesome as the mercy of
[1:19:32] God I know why if you don't say Amen to
[1:19:34] it you don't understand it say Amen if
[1:19:38] you really understood that God's Great
[1:19:39] no matter which side it's on and in this
[1:19:42] case if you're the elect you don't have
[1:19:44] to worry about the other side you're
[1:19:45] standing with him and that's
[1:19:48] awesome you
[1:19:51] realize Jesus picking up up the Whip and
[1:19:53] running them out is an act of
[1:19:57] mercy God correcting people is an act of
[1:20:01] Mercy but people don't want to be
[1:20:03] corrected you let a preacher stand up
[1:20:05] print correct people the way they dress
[1:20:06] they come to the church and dress like
[1:20:08] they would out in the bar somewhere they
[1:20:09] need to be
[1:20:10] corrected who else is going to do it
[1:20:12] come on well I'm going to leave it up to
[1:20:14] Mama what a mama don't say it listen
[1:20:16] where does judgment begin at in the
[1:20:18] house of the Lord where did judgment
[1:20:21] begin at when Jesus walked into the
[1:20:22] Temple that's where judgment began at
[1:20:24] that's why you get people living loose
[1:20:26] and thinking that anything goes anything
[1:20:28] don't
[1:20:31] go
[1:20:33] sorry that's an act of Mercy they
[1:20:36] corrupted the temple and if your
[1:20:38] Temple's corrupt you're going to corrupt
[1:20:39] this Temple their temples was corrupted
[1:20:42] their worship was corrupted it was no
[1:20:44] longer holy it's no longer Sanctified he
[1:20:47] was trying to purge their hearts and
[1:20:49] turn them from their wickedness and give
[1:20:51] them an opportunity of
[1:20:54] Mercy what a
[1:20:56] decoration think about it his last act
[1:20:59] in his ministry he turns the tables
[1:21:02] upside
[1:21:05] down I'll tell you what I believe he was
[1:21:07] doing he was purging the floor of the
[1:21:10] Garner notice what happened let me quit
[1:21:13] right here he gets the temple clean he
[1:21:17] gets the thieves run out right he gets
[1:21:20] rid of all these doves in here nothing
[1:21:22] nothing wrong with the doves just the
[1:21:23] way the doves was presented notice what
[1:21:26] he did he run everything out and after
[1:21:28] the temple gets clean after the temple
[1:21:31] is purged after the word is put in its
[1:21:34] place and Jesus is standing in the
[1:21:36] middle of the temple all right all of a
[1:21:38] sudden here comes the supernatural right
[1:21:39] back into the temple and the Bible said
[1:21:41] in verse 14 and the Blind and the lame
[1:21:44] came to him in the
[1:21:47] temple and he healed them you see what
[1:21:51] Worship in order does do you see what
[1:21:53] sanctity does you see what Holiness does
[1:21:56] you see what order Church order does all
[1:21:58] of a sudden here come listen that tells
[1:22:00] me the lame must have not been there
[1:22:02] because they know God wasn't in there
[1:22:04] but listen the blind mustn't in there
[1:22:06] because they know God wasn't in there
[1:22:08] but I want to tell once the money
[1:22:10] changers got pushed out here comes the
[1:22:12] word back into the temple and here comes
[1:22:14] healing Here Comes Deliverance Here
[1:22:16] Comes
[1:22:19] salvation here comes the Supernatural
[1:22:22] and the blind the lamb came to him in
[1:22:23] the temple and he healed them verse 15
[1:22:25] and when the chief priest and the
[1:22:26] scribes saw the wonderful things that he
[1:22:29] did and the
[1:22:31] children the children
[1:22:36] crying in the
[1:22:38] temple ain't that something they're not

[1:22:43] the spirit of God falls in the children
[1:22:45] are crying in the temple you know what
[1:22:48] that tells me something must have been
[1:22:49] going on in that church I'm talking
[1:22:51] about from the time he turns the tables
[1:22:53] over and runs everybody out all of a
[1:22:55] sudden Jesus walks in here come some
[1:22:57] little ones that was up there in the
[1:22:58] temple here they come gathered around
[1:22:59] the temple and whenever they seen the
[1:23:01] Blind and the lame start getting healed
[1:23:03] they go to cry and the children were
[1:23:05] crying in the temple saying hosana to
[1:23:08] the son of David and the Pharisees the
[1:23:12] Sadducees can I say it BST Methodist
[1:23:15] Presbyterian they see the Miracles they
[1:23:17] see the signs they see all the Wonders
[1:23:18] and what they do get mad and the Bible
[1:23:21] said and they were so or
[1:23:23] displeased you know why because these
[1:23:26] children are crying because they're
[1:23:27] seeing
[1:23:28] fulfillment they're seeing an attraction
[1:23:31] coming off the mountain the children was
[1:23:33] crying in the temple The Offspring oh

[1:24:33] away here come children shouting crying
[1:24:38] hosan to the highest
[1:24:41] deliverer you know what they're calling
[1:24:42] for a total
[1:24:45] deliverance and when the priest heard
[1:24:48] this yeah they were sore displeased you
[1:24:51] know why they didn't like the noise in
[1:24:53] the
[1:24:54] church they didn't like the worship I
[1:24:56] want to say this if you don't like
[1:24:58] Worship in the church something's wrong
[1:25:00] with your
[1:25:02] experience I'm not telling you all of us
[1:25:04] has got to act the same way or act like
[1:25:05] me God knows he don't want nobody else
[1:25:07] doing that but there's something about
[1:25:10] the element of the supernatural when it
[1:25:12] moves on people it stimulates the nerve
[1:25:16] remember the prophet saying it takes
[1:25:17] something to stimulate the nerve and I
[1:25:19] want to tell the ultimate stimulation
[1:25:21] Falls among them and the listen they
[1:25:24] didn't like the
[1:25:26] noise and the reason they didn't like
[1:25:28] the noise is because they didn't know
[1:25:31] who he
[1:25:32] was they did not see who he was what's
[1:25:37] the attraction what was the matter with
[1:25:38] those scribes what was the matter with
[1:25:41] those priests what was the matter with
[1:25:43] those religious people this was wrote
[1:25:45] 487 years before it happened by
[1:25:47] Vindicated Prophet was already put in
[1:25:50] the writings called the Bible the
[1:25:51] Scrolls of the the Old
[1:25:53] Testament why why couldn't they see that
[1:25:56] that's prophecy being
[1:25:58] fulfilled the same
[1:26:01] reason they can't see it today they had
[1:26:04] took the word of God and made it a n
[1:26:06] effect to the People by teaching
[1:26:08] for well this is the way we always done
[1:26:11] it this is the way we always done listen
[1:26:13] I don't care the way you've always done
[1:26:14] it I want to do it the way the word says
[1:26:16] to do
[1:26:17] it well Grandpa bless God I don't care
[1:26:20] what grandpa I want to do what the word
[1:26:21] says amen we are not called to be like
[1:26:24] any other church every church is
[1:26:26] Sovereign within
[1:26:27] itself we want to be Sovereign under the
[1:26:30] leadership of the Holy Spirit you know
[1:26:31] why because we want Liberty in the house
[1:26:33] of God and that was the problem whenever
[1:26:36] he come in they didn't have their order
[1:26:38] no more he run them out and he took the
[1:26:40] word of God and they made it a none
[1:26:42] effect to the People by teaching for
[1:26:43] traditions for Doctrine they made their
[1:26:45] tradition of Doctrine they was blinded
[1:26:48] by it and they Twisted the word they
[1:26:50] distorted the picture and Jesus was
[1:26:52] trying to offer them Mercy to wake them
[1:26:54] up and he's trying to pry their eyes
[1:26:56] open preaching as hard as he can his
[1:26:59] last sermon his last message their last
[1:27:02] opportunity and they are mad and Jesus's
[1:27:05] replies this and he said unto them
[1:27:08] hearest
[1:27:09] thou what these say look what he's doing
[1:27:13] he's pointing to those that are
[1:27:15] fulfilling their part of the word he
[1:27:17] could have said don't you know who I am
[1:27:19] but he looks at the prophet's prophecy
[1:27:23] and he says do you hear what these
[1:27:24] people are saying do you hear listen at
[1:27:27] them do you hear what they're saying
[1:27:28] listen at what they're saying listen to
[1:27:31] what they're preaching open up your ears
[1:27:33] in other words do you hear do you have
[1:27:36] an ear to
[1:27:37] hear listen to this and Jesus said yay
[1:27:41] have you never read out of the mouth of
[1:27:43] babes and suckings thou H has perfected
[1:27:46] praise you know what Jesus is doing he's
[1:27:49] quoting the psalmist David and he's cuz
[1:27:52] David foretold that the king's going to
[1:27:54] come and David said when this would H
[1:27:56] David tells us when this would happen he
[1:27:58] tells us what's going to take place and
[1:28:00] he said when he comes in they're going
[1:28:01] to
[1:28:02] Rejoice he's going to tell them listen
[1:28:06] let me close the psalmist tells us why
[1:28:09] they're
[1:28:10] rejoicing and I want to tell you why
[1:28:13] Psalms 8 And1 oh Lord excellent is thy
[1:28:17] name in all the Earth who has set the
[1:28:20] glory above the heavens out of the mouth
[1:28:22] of babes and sucklings hast thou listen
[1:28:25] to this hast thou ordained
[1:28:28] strength because of thine enemies in
[1:28:31] other words out the M because of the
[1:28:33] enemy there's going to be strength
[1:28:35] that's going to come that thou mightest
[1:28:37] steal the enemy and the Avenger right
[1:28:41] you know what that word still means it
[1:28:43] literally means he's going to destroy
[1:28:45] exterminate completely remove your
[1:28:48] enemies that's before you he's going to
[1:28:51] be your another other words he will
[1:28:52] exterminate anything that comes and I
[1:28:55] want to say this they needed an
[1:28:58] exterminator because they had all kinds
[1:29:00] of things that was in their life but
[1:29:02] when the word come in it drove the enemy
[1:29:04] from their life he literally stealed the
[1:29:07] enemy in their midst in other words when
[1:29:09] they recognize the deliverer when they
[1:29:11] recognize the savior they will never
[1:29:13] come into the punishment that listen
[1:29:15] they'll never have Vengeance against
[1:29:17] them they'll never have recompense
[1:29:19] against them he will stop the Judgment
[1:29:21] against against them and when you
[1:29:24] recognize him he stops the Judgment in
[1:29:26] your life and when the children got to
[1:29:28] crime they realize this is the one that
[1:29:29] David spoke about this is one Zechariah
[1:29:32] in other words I don't have to go to
[1:29:34] judgment because I me the the deliverer
[1:29:36] you're going to escape the Judgment he's
[1:29:38] going to steal the
[1:29:41] enemy let's stand our
[1:29:43] feet
[1:29:45] Hallelujah that thou mightest steal the
[1:29:47] enemy and the Avenger verse five for
