There's something about the testimony of a believer. Amen. It's not coming from something they learned in a school or something they memorized by a code of creeds or dogmas. But a believer's testimony is coming from an experience. Amen. Something that we have personally experienced. And you know this morning I woke up this morning and turned on the prophet of God and he just began to talk about how thankful he was. And he said something that just really uh spoke to my heart. He said, you know, he said, I've made many mistakes. He said, but I'm thankful for the grace of God to rise and try again. And I just stopped right there and said, thank you, Lord.

It's sure good to see you all again. God bless you this morning. Amen. This morning we want to bow our hearts for a word of prayer. I just received a prayer request for Sister Kim Weeks there in Virginia. You all know Brother Kevin Weekes. He was here and his family with us in the meetings. It's actually his sister-in-law. She had a knee replacement several weeks ago and is now dealing with a very severe uh infection in her stomach. They're actually going to be doing a procedure here shortly and it's a very um risky procedure, but I I know a man who can. Amen. Brother Brian, we know a God that can step on the scene. And may we just bow our hearts this morning for a word of prayer and approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers have gathered here this morning on this, Lord, beautiful resurrection Sunday that you've given us, Father, with joy in our hearts, with a song in our mouths, oh God, with praise upon our lips unto you. Lord, we are so thankful this morning that we can approach you. We can approach you by the way of prayer. We can come into your presence this morning. And father, we can present our petitions before you knowing that you're more than able to move upon them. And Father, we bring Sister Kim before you this morning, Lord. A dear sister in Christ. Father, a faithful veteran and soldier of this gospel for many, many years. And Lord, you see her there this morning in the hospital there in Virginia, afflicted in her body. And Lord, we may not be there in physical form to to lay our hands upon her and pray with her. But Lord, I know the angel of God is ever present. And Lord, I pray you would pass by that hospital room this morning, I pray, oh God, Lord, that before the doctors would even touch her, Lord, may you drive that infection out of her body, Lord, may you bring a great healing virtue through her, Lord. Father, I pray for this meeting this morning that you would come among us in a special way. Lord, as these believers have gathered here today, Lord, I have nothing in my human self to offer them, but Lord, we have a message and we believe that is the king's message. And I pray this morning you would help me to get myself out of the way that Lord liberty could come among us and Lord that we could deliver the things that you brought to our attention in your word. Now Father, I pray if there be any sick among us today, even in this building, may you heal them. If there be any bound, may you deliver them. Oh God, if there be any empty, may you fill them. And Lord, when we would leave this place today, may we be able to say like those on the Emmas road, did not our hearts burn within us as he came and talked to us along the way. Not as brother Andrew talked to us or any other man. But Lord, as you, the son of man, would walk among this congregation today. Lord, you would reveal yourself into our hearts. We'll be sure to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. For it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And all the believers says, "Amen." And amen. Won't you say it like a believer this morning? Amen. Amen. We We say, "God bless you today." If you have your Bibles, while you're standing, we want to go uh to the book of Malachi, the 4th chapter. Uh we just have one service here today. So, we want to take a few moments here in the word of the Lord. Amen. Malachi, the 4th chapter, and then we want to go to the book of Jude, the first chapter. Amen. It's just a it's just a good day to serve the Lord, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. The blessings of God upon our lives, and Amen. We we thank the Lord for that. Malachi chapter 4 and verse number five. Very very familiar scripture here. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And notice this. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers. Brother Bham said, or restore the faith. Now, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. I also want to go to the book of Jude chapter 1. Jude chapter 1. It's that little little book just a just one chapter between the three epistles of John and the book of Revelation. In Jude chapter 1 in verse number one, Jude the servant of Jesus Christ, the brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father. Brother Brham stopped and said that's not the unbeliever. He said that's the sanctified set aside ones in Christ and preserved in Jesus Christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied. Now beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith. Somebody say contend for the faith. contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. So this is not a new faith, but it's a restoration of the original faith. For there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men turning the grace of our God into listiviousness. Watch this. and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We ask Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seat here today uh from those passages of scripture this morning if I would uh take a title to speak to you here today for a few moments. I want to talk to you on this um contending for the faith. Amen. Contending for the faith. I'm actually going to begin this this morning and Lord willing take it in another portion on on Wednesday. But tonight uh this morning rather just to to lay a foundation in this contending for the faith. Brother Brham said this is the only scripture in the Bible that I know of that we are commanded to contend. We are to keep contentions away from us. He said but here we are to contend for the faith. He said the faith that was once delivered unto the saints. Now I may be to take a a portion out of that contending for the faith. I want to speak to you on this. The bride's contention. Amen. the bride's contention. Brother B said, "There has been churches, churches. There has been brides, brides, churches, brides, brides." He says, "But there has got to come one." How many believes that there's got to come one? There has to come a real bride. There's must come one that's not only got the mechanics of it, but they've got the dynamics, he said, that will make the church live and move in the power of his resurrection. 1953. I say this today. If you believe me to be God's servant, you are now living in the day of the restoration of the faith that was once delivered to the saints. Amen. Amen. There's no longer a question of what day we are living in. We now have a vindicated prophet declaring we are living in the day of the restoration of the faith. We are living under the power, amen, of the latter reign of the Holy Ghost raising up today and calling. He says great doctors and divinities out of everything, amen, out of all the denominations. Again, he'll say it like this. What we need today, Amen, is a contending for the faith. Now, I believe I can say to you this morning that we are living in the time, Amen. This is not Moses's day. Amen. This is not David's day. This is not Paul's day. This is not Peter's day. Amen. But I believe this is the bride's day. I I believe this is the opportunity for the real bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. I believe this is your opportunity to contend. Re said if you would have lived in the days gone by when they when they crucified Jesus, well, you would say, "I would have stood for him. I I would have given my life for him." Well, he said, "You have more of an opportunity to do that now." Amen. Than you would in them days. Amen. Stand now. Amen. The opposition is greater today. Amen. Than it was then. Now, amen. I can say then that we are living in what Paul will call, AMEN, A PERPLEXED TIME. In 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 8, he will say we are troubled on every side. How many can testify? Amen. YET NOT DISTRESSED. WE WE ARE PERPLEXED BUT NOT in despair. I love that word perplexed. It means to stand in doubt. It means to be without resources, not to know, Amen. which way to turn. How many's ever been there? Amen. You don't know which way to turn. Now look at this word despair. It means to be utterly at loss, it means utterly destitute of measures or resources. It means to renounce all hope. So when one is perplexed, amen, they don't know which way to turn. Amen. But they are not in despair. They don't they're not renouncing their hope. Now, amen, that word renounce, it means to formally declare, amen, ONE'S ABANDONMENT OF A claim of a right or a possession. I want to say this morning in these perplexed times, amen, we may be faced with situations. WE WE MAY NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN. WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT there is one thing that this bride will not do is we will not renounce our hope. Amen. AMEN. OUR HOPE IS NOT IN A CHURCH. AMEN. OUR HOPE IS NOT in a preacher. OUR HOPE IS NOT AMEN IN THE PRESIDENT OR IN THE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD. OUR HOPE IS IN GOD. AMEN. AND A PROPHET SAID THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE WE HAVE. AMEN. IS NOT THE ATOMIC BOMB. AMEN. Our hope is in Jesus Christ and Christ is the answer. Amen. Then if this HOPE IS IN YOU, Peter said, Amen. Be ready always to give an answer, amen, to every man that askketh you a reason, amen, of the hope that is in you. BROTHER SAID, "IF I CAN TESTIFY, AMEN, to the hope that lays within me, well, it'll be a blessing for me to tell you, and I hope it'll be a blessing to you to receive it." AMEN. AND KNOW THROUGH YOUR FAITH, AMEN. It corresponds with the same thing. Now, I want you to hear this. AND THE SAME FAITH, SOMEBODY SAY, "THE same faith." The same faith that's in me, amen, LAYS IN YOU. AMEN. ISN'T THAT POWERFUL? WE ARE FELLOW CITIZENS, AMEN, OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD. AMEN. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM DIDN'T HAVE ONE faith and you got another. AMEN. BROTHER MATT DON'T HAVE ONE FAITH AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER. AMEN. But the SAME FAITH THAT WAS IN THE BIBLE. AMEN. THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS IN THE PROPHETS. THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS IN THE DISCIPLES AND WAS IN THE APOSTLES. AMEN. HAS COME INTO THE BRIDE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. NOW, &gt;&gt; that faith, AMEN, IS NOT JUST MAKING US FEEL GOOD. &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH IS NOT JUST EXCITING US. AMEN. BUT THAT THAT FAITH IS BRINGING US TO THE REALITY THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A VERY PROPHETIC TIME. NOW, AMEN. THE BIBLE PROPHESIED IN 2 Thessalonians 2, Paul said, amen, THAT THERE WILL COME A FALLEN AWAY. RIGHT? He said, I beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him. Now, look what he says in verse two. THAT YOU BE NOT SOON SHAKEN IN MIND. AMEN. AMEN. OR BE TROUBLED neither by spirit. Amen. nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as the day of Christ is at hand. He says, "Now let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come except THERE COME A FALLING AWAY FIRST and the man of sin be revealed." Amen. The son of predition. I I CAN SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. We are living in the last days. We We are living in the end time. One place you'll say, "WE ARE LIVING IN THE END OF THE END." AMEN. THE TIME HAS COME WHERE there is a falling away. The Bible SAID IF THERE DON'T COME A FALLEN AWAY, the man of sin won't reveal himself. He said the Pentecostal church is living in the final of all times. The time has come. Amen. The time has come for signs to follow believers. He said we're at the end. We're in the latter rain. We're at the time. Amen. When men will be heady and high-minded, lovers of pleasure, lovers of God, more than lovers of God, truce breakers, false accusers, INCONTINENT, DESPISERS OF THOSE THAT ARE GOOD. Now listen, the time has come when they're teaching doctrines of devils, amen, and perverting the BIBLE'S TEACHING INTO THEORIES AND THEOLOGIES. NOW, WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? AMEN. TO DRAW groups of people, amen, away after them. NOW, WATCH THIS. AMEN. BUT THE TIME HAS COME, AMEN, WHEN GOD WILL GATHER HIS CHURCH TOGETHER. HE SAID, "THE TIME HAS come for Jesus to come." AMEN. THE TIME HAS COME, AMEN, FOR THE GATHERING OF THE PEOPLE. LISTEN, THE SON OF PREDITION, AMEN, IS GATHERING HIS PEOPLE, AMEN, BY PERVERTED TEACHINGS ON THE WORD OF GOD. BUT THE SON OF MAN IS GATHERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE ORIGINAL TEACHING OF MALACHI 4 AND LUKE 17:30. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING A BUNCH OF CUNNINGLY DEVISED FABLES. WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE IDEAS OF THE CHURCH. WE ARE BACK IN THE BIBLE WITH A FAITH THAT GOD GAVE US IN THE HOUR THAT we're living in. I say if there's ever been a time, amen, that you're going to do ANYTHING FOR GOD, AMEN, now is the time to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say it like Peter SAID, THE END OF ALL THINGS IS AT HAND. How many agrees? &gt;&gt; BROTHER B SAID, NOW WATCH THAT SEVENTH SEAL. It's the end OF ALL THINGS. IT'S THE END OF STRUGGLING NATURE. IT'S THE END OF THE church age. And everything ends on that seventh seal. It's the ushering in of the millennium. Now, I can say this. There cannot be an end time until there's a falling AWAY. RIGHT? RE SAID, "AND PAUL SAID, AMEN. THERE'LL BE A FALLING AWAY." NOW, WHAT WILL THERE BE A FALLING away from? From the real Pentecostal faith. AMEN. THE PENTECOSTAL FAITH WILL BE DONE AWAY with and dignitaries will be set in. THEY'LL HAVE A MAN TAKE THE PLACE OF GOD WHO WILL SIT IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD AND OPPOSE HIMSELF ABOVE ALL THE PEOPLE. HE SAID, "NOW WATCH. THAT'S NICO OVERCOMING THE LEOTY AND ALL THAT'S CALLED GOD. NOW WATCH THIS. PAUL SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN." AND HERE WE ARE RIGHT HERE NOW AND SEE THE FALLING AWAY AND SEE THE CHURCH GETTING further and further away. Amen. From it and going right back again. WE'RE AT THE END TIME. NOW WATCH THIS. THERE'S A FALLING AWAY, AMEN, BY OR FALLING AWAY FROM PENTECOSTAL FAITH. BUT BRINGS IT ON DOWN AND HE SAYS THERE'LL BE A CHURCH THAT'LL FALL AWAY FROM BIBLE FAITH. AMEN. AMEN. SEE, WHAT ARE they doing? They're organizing themselves together. They are cooperating. THEY'RE THEY'RE BINDING THEMSELVES TOGETHER. HE SAID, "NOW WATCH." AND THEY DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IN THE BIBLE. THEY DON'T EVEN believe in the REAL TRUE WORD OF GOD. YOU SAY, "WELL, THE BIBLE SAYS THIS." THEY SAY, "THEN THINGS ARE PASSED. THERE'S NO SUCH A THING AS DIVINE HEALING. THERE'S NO SUCH A THING AS MIRACLES." HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN, WHAT IS THAT SEED? It's maturing. IT'S THE END TIME SIGN SEED." WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE PEOPLE, AMEN, DENYING THE FOUNDATION OF THE GOSPEL, AMEN, THAT'S NOT THE TIME TO BECOME PERPLEXED AND TO RENOUNCE ALL YOUR HOPE. THAT IS THE TIME TO LIFT UP YOUR HEAD. AMEN. BECAUSE YOUR REDEMPTION IS DRAWING NIGH. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BECOME HELPLESS. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BECOME HOPELESS. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BECOME WEAK IN FAITH AND TO BECOME FAINT AND HARD. IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A TIME TO SHARPEN YOUR SWORD. IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A TIME, AMEN, TO STAND TOE-TO-TOE WITH THE DEVIL. THE SON OF PREDITION HAS BEEN REVEALED. BUT SO HAS THE SON OF MAN HAS COME IN THIS HOUR WITH A FAITH THAT'LL DELIVER YOU FROM THE TEMPTATION THAT HAS COME UPON the world. My when you see these things happening, Amen. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD. YOUR REDEMPTION IS DRAWING NIGH. I THINK IT'S POWERFUL. AMEN. THAT THAT GOD DEALS IN THE PROPHETIC. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT HE HAS A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; How many can agree you are that that prophetic class? &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THIS. THEN IF GOD HAS A PROPHETIC WORD AND HE HAS A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE, THEN SURELY HE HAS A PROPHETIC TIME, RIGHT? THEN I CAN SAY WE ARE LIVING IN THE PROPHETIC TIME. WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME, now I want you TO HEAR THIS, WHEN THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE Bible prophecies being fulfilled at the same time. Are you with me? Now I can show it to you. 1 Timothy 4:1, it says, "NOW THE SPIRIT SPEAKETH EXPRESSLY THAT IN THE LATTER times some shall depart from the faith." NOW I LOVE THAT IT DON'T SAY ALL. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS SOME SHALL DEPART FROM THE FAITH. NOW THEY WILL GIVE HEED to seducing spirits AND DOCTRINES OF DEVILS. LISTEN. THEY WILL SPEAK LIES IN HYPOCRISY. THEY WILL HAVE their conscience seared WITH A HOT IRON. NOW WATCH THIS WORD DEPART. IT MEANS TO DRAW AWAY. It means to refrain. It means to withdraw self. It means to excite, to revolt. IT MEANS TO DESERT. SO WHEN ONE BEGINS TO DEPART FROM THE FAITH, THEY BEGIN to draw THEMSELVES AWAY. THEY BEGIN TO BECOME HOSTILE AND THEY BEGIN TO DESERT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE HOLDING ON TO. Brother said, "Look, those Jews, THEY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE JESUS." AMEN. AS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY THAT A MESSIAH WOULD COME, he said, "Now, what did they do?" HE SAID, "THEY BECOME HOSTILE TOWARDS HIM AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM." HE SAID, "AND THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT SPOKE THROUGH HOSEA," AMEN. SPOKE THROUGH JOHN AND SAID, "IN THE LAST DAYS, THE CHURCH WOULD BE NAKED, WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR, and blind." HE SAID, "NOW WATCH THIS. THEY WILL BECOME HOSTILE TOWARDS THE MESSAGE." AMEN. I I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU VERY PLAINLY. AMEN. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BECOME HOSTILE TOWARDS THE MESSAGE, IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE BECOMING HOSTILE, AMEN, TOWARDS BROTHER BRANDHAM or towards Brother Matt or any other PREACHER OR CHURCH, IT'S ACTUALLY YOU'RE COMING HOSTILE, AMEN, TOWARDS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD. LISTEN, THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A MAN, FOLKS. IT'S NOT A PREACHER. AMEN. IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY. THIS MESSAGE IS THE BIBLE BEING FULFILLED BY THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH WHO SENT IT INTO THE AGE YOU'RE LIVING IN. AMEN. NOW, WATCH THIS. THERE WILL BE SOME WHO WILL DEPART FROM THE FAITH. AIN'T IT FUNNY? AMEN. PEOPLE SIT ON A PEW FOR 20 YEARS AND NEVER DO NOTHING FOR THE FAITH, BUT THEY FIND ONE LITTLE MISTAKE. AMEN. AND THEY THEY THEY BECOME HOSTILE AND THEY GO AROUND THE WORLD TRYING TO SPREAD a bunch OF A BUNCH OF NONSENSE. AMEN. AND THE ONLY THING THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS TEAR YOUR FAITH DOWN. AMEN. SO YOU WILL FOLLOW THEM. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS, THAT'S ONE BIBLE PROPHECY. AMEN. BUT THERE'S A SECOND BIBLE PROPHECY. AND IT'S OVER IN the book of Jude, THE FIRST CHAPTER, WHEN HE SAID, "IT WAS NEED FOR ME TO WRITE UNTO YOU AND EXHORT YOU THAT YOU SHOULD EARNESTLY contend for the faith THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO the saints." LISTEN, THIS WAS 33 YEARS AFTER PENTECOST. And Jude BEGINS TO WRITE THIS. AND A PROPHET COMES ALONG AND SAYS, "NOW, WHAT IS TO CONTEND?" He says, "Contend is to debate." I love that. I'm going somewhere with that. Amen. CONTEND IS TO DEBATE OR TO STAND THERE AND HOLD FAST ON YOUR CONVICTION. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU ARE CONTENDING, YOU ARE STANDING FAST AND YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO YOUR CONVICTION. I LOVE THIS. 1955 HE SAID NOW TO CONTEND MEANS NOT TO ARGUE EXACTLY BUT OTHERWISE HOLD FAST. AMEN. OR UPHOLD AND STAY PUT WITH IT AS WE CALL IN THE STREET EXPRESSION. I WANT YOU TO EARNESTLY NOW WHAT DID HE SAY? EARNESTLY CONTEND. REB SAID NOT JUST HALFHEARTEDLY BUT WITH ALL YOUR SOUL AND ALL YOUR MIGHT. AMEN. Contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. AMEN. CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU? AMEN. SOME ARE DEPARTING FROM THE FAITH. AMEN. BUT OTHERS ARE CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH. AMEN. THERE'S TWO BIBLE PROPHECIES ACTUALLY HAPPENING BEFORE YOUR EYES. AMEN. SOME ARE DEPARTING, BUT SOME ARE CONTENDING. AMEN. NOW, THIS DEPARTURE DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN IN THIS AGE, BUT ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE THIRD AGE, IN THE PERGAMIAN CHURCH AGE, A PROPHET SAID, "WE HAVE TWO CHURCHES BEARING THE SAME NAME, BUT WITH A BITTER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM." HE SAID, "ONE HAS DEPARTED FROM THE TRUTH. SHE HAS MARRIED IDOLS AND HAS NO LIFE IN HER. SHE HAS HYBRIDIZED HERSELF AND THE SIGNS OF DEATH, NOT LIFE FOLLOWING HER WAKE. SHE IS POWERFUL WITH MANY MEMBERS AND SHE IS FAVORED BY THE WORLD." NOW, THAT'S THE GROUP THAT HAS DEPARTED FROM THE FAITH. SHE IS POWERFUL IN MEMBERS. SHE IS FAVORED BY THE WORLD. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP AND BEN SAID IT'S A LITTLE PERSECUTED GROUP BUT SHE FOLLOWS THE WORD AND THE SIGNS FOLLOW HER. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS MORNING. BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT EYES TO SEE AND YOU GOT EARS TO HEAR and you got a HEART TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. YOU OUGHT TO PUT YOUR SHOUTING SHOES ON IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. THE WORLD HAS DEPARTED. SHE IS FAVORED BY the world. SHE IS ADMIRED BY THE WORLD, BUT SHE IS REJECTED BY GOD. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE FAITH WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN RESTORED BY THE MINISTRY OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL. SHE MAY BE PERSECUTED, BUT SHE'S GOT LIFE AND SHE'S GOT THE POWER OF GOD AND SHE'S GOT THE GRACE OF GOD UPON HER LIFE. YES, SIR. AMEN. In her the SICK ARE HEALED. IN HER the dead are raised. SHE IS ALIVE WITH THE LIFE AND WORD OF GOD. LISTEN. SHE LOVES NOT HER LIFE, BUT HOLDS TO HIS NAME and his faith even unto death. Now, ACCORDING TO SCRIPTURE, THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE FAITH. CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU? THERE'S NOT A BAPTIST FAITH, SAINTS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A METHODIST FAITH. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A PENTECOSTAL DENOMINATIONAL FAITH. THERE'S NOT A CATHOLIC FAITH. THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NOT A LUTHERAN FAITH, BROTHER DAVID. AMEN. THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NOT A HOW CAN I SAY IT? THERE'S NOT A MAN-MADE FAITH IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THIS. ACCORDING TO PAUL IN EPHESIANS 4 AND VERSE 5, HE SAYS THERE'S ONE LORD. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THERE'S ONE FAITH AND HE SAYS THERE'S ONE BAPTISM. BROTHER REM COMES ALONG AND SAYS THEN CONTEND FOR THE FAITH, NOT A FAITH. So if IT'S A METHODIST FAITH, IT'S A FAITH. IF IT'S A BAPTIST FAITH, IT'S A FAITH. BUT IF IT'S COMING FROM THE BIBLE, IT'S THE FAITH. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE REALLY one faith. There's one Lord, one God, AND ONE BAPTISM. NOW, MANY PEOPLE SAYS, "THAT'S AGAINST MY FAITH." HE SAID, "BUT LISTEN, THERE'S ONLY ONE THE FAITH." HEARD HIM SAY IT LAST NIGHT. HE SAID, "WELL, YOU SAY, "I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT DIVINE HEALING. IT'S AGAINST MY FAITH." HE SAID, "IT'S THE WORD OF GOD." SO, IS THE WORD OF GOD AGAINST YOUR FAITH? &gt;&gt; NOW, COME ON. WHAT KIND OF FAITH HAVE YOU GOT THAT WHEN SOMETHING IS PREACHED FROM THE WORD OF GOD, IT OFFENDS YOU? WHAT KIND OF FAITH HAVE YOU GOT WHEN SOMETHING IS REVEALED BY the revealing of the son OF MAN AND IT DON'T BRING A JOY INTO YOUR HEART? IT BRINGS A IT BRINGS A FINE SPIRIT. I TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF FAITH YOU GOT. YOU GOT A HYBRIDIZED FAITH AND IT'S NOT COME FROM THIS BIBLE. IT HAS NOT COME FROM GOD. IT HAS COME FROM THE DEVIL. BUT IN THE EVENING TIME, IT SHALL BE LIGHT. WHEN THE MESSAGE OF MALACHI 4 SHALL BEGIN TO SAIL, THERE WILL BE A RESTORATION in the FAITH OF THE CHURCH. IT'LL BE THE FAITH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Reverend said, "There's only one WAY TO BE POSITIVE, SURE, THIS NIGHT IS TO GO BACK AND SEE WHAT KIND OF FAITH THEY HAD TO CONTEND FOR. And then we should EARNESTLY CONTEND FOR THAT TYPE OF FAITH." I LOVE THIS. HE SAYS, "THE FIRST ONE TO INTRODUCE THE MESSAGE," I LOVE THAT. THE FIRST ONE TO INTRODUCE THE MESSAGE, BROTHER BRIAN, OF OR THE FAITH WOULD BE OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JOHN JUST INTRODUCED THE LORD JESUS AND JESUS WAS THE PRODUCT OF WHAT GOD INTENDED FOR US TO CONTEND FOR. HE WAS THE WHOLE OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH. NOW LISTEN, IT LAID in Jesus Christ in our faith in him. Look here, HE SAID, NOW SEE, THEY WASN'T CONTENDING FOR SOME HISTORICAL AFFAIR, BUT THEY were contending FOR A LIVING CHRIST. THEY WERE CONTENDING FOR A RESURRECTED ONE WHO WAS IN THEIR MIDST. NOW WATCH THIS. WE ARE NOT CONTENDING FOR REASONINGS. AMEN. WE ARE CONTENDING FOR FAITH. BROTHER SAID YOU CANNOT GO REFER TO YOUR REASON. HE SAID IF YOU DO THEN YOU WILL CONFINE YOURSELF TO REASON. IS it okay? &gt;&gt; I say something. &gt;&gt; OKAY. HE SAID NOW THERE'S TRY DON'T TRY TO REASON IT. YOU SAY NOW LET ME SEE. Maybe I do this. Don't reason IT BELIEVE GOD. HE SAID GOD DOESN'T COME BY REASON. HE SAID YOU KNOW GOD BY SIMPLE CHILDLIKE FAITH TO ACCEPT HIS WORD. HE SAID NOW LISTEN your reason power within yourself but FAITH IT COMES FROM GOD. HE SAID FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT'S BORN IN YOU. IT'S SOMETHING THAT GOD GIVES YOU. AMEN. NOW WATCH THIS. THEN THAT SON OF GOD STANDS THERE. AMEN. KNOWING where he's AT AND ALL THE DEVILS IN HELL COULD NOT SHAKE HIM AWAY FROM IT. YOU COULD POINT A MACHINE GUN AT HIM AND YOU WILL NEVER BACK HIM OFF OF HIS CONVICTIONS. AMEN. I think it's amazing. AMEN. THAT THIS FAITH I'M SPEAKING OF, IT IS NOT EARNED, BUT IT IS A GIFT OF GOD TO YOU. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "BY GRACE ARE YOU SAVED THROUGH FAITH AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES. It is the GIFT OF GOD." IN GALATIANS 2:16, KNOWING THAT A MAN IS NOT JUSTIFIED by the works of the law, Amen. But by the faith of Jesus CHRIST, I LOVE A PROPHET. HE'LL STOP RIGHT THERE AND HE'LL SAY, "NOW, AMEN." DID HE SAY, "CONTEND FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS DELIVERED to Israel." HE SAID, "NO." HE SAID, "CONTEND FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS." HE SAID, "BECAUSE WHAT ISRAEL HAD WAS UNDER THE DISPENSATION OF LAW." HE SAID, "BUT WHAT WE'RE TO CONTEND FOR HAS COME UNTO US UNDER THE DISPENSATION OF GRACE." He said, "Now watch. We have believed in Jesus Christ that WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED." AMEN. NOT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW, BUT BY THE FAITH OF CHRIST. FOR BY THE WORKS of the LAW SHALL NO FLESH BE JUSTIFIED. I LOVE WHAT PAUL SAYS IN PHILIPPIANS 3:9. AND BEING FOUND IN HIM, NOT HAVING MY OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS, which is of THE LAW, BUT THAT WHICH IS THROUGH THE FAITH OF CHRIST. AMEN. I WANT TO SAY THIS. YOU GOT A HEART IN YOU, RIGHT? AMEN. And in that heart, brother said, THERE IS A DOOR TO THE HEART, RIGHT? HE SAID, "BUT THEN THERE ARE DOORS IN THE DOOR, &gt;&gt; RIGHT?" HE'LL SAY THIS. HE SAID, "NOW, LET'S FIND THAT DOOR OF FAITH." HE SAID, "NOW, YOU'LL COME TO CHURCH AND YOU'LL WATCH SIGNS OF GOD AND WONDERS BE performed and you won't pay any attention TO THAT BECAUSE THE CREEDS HAS LOCKED THAT DOOR OF FAITH IN YOU AND WATCH AND MADE YOU THINK THAT THAT IS A FAITH." HE SAID, "AND THERE IS ONLY ONE FAITH AND THAT IS THE FAITH OF GOD. AND THE ONLY ONE CAN BRING THE faith of God is Jesus Christ, HIS SON, THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEART. LISTEN, HE'S KNOCKED AT YOUR door &gt;&gt; through signs, WONDERS, AND MIRACLES. BUT YOU'LL KEEP THAT ALL PINNED UP AND SAY, "I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT." OH, IF HE COULD ONLY STAND AND YOU WOULD OPEN up that door. It wouldn't BE TWO MINUTES. YOU WOULD BELIEVE EVERY WORD THE BIBLE WROTE AND SAY AMEN TO EVERY BIT OF IT IF YOU WOULD JUST OPEN UP THE DOOR AND LET JESUS COME IN AND GIVE YOU THE FAITH THAT HE HAS TO GIVE YOU. He said WHEN YOU TAKE CHRIST'S FAITH THEN YOU RECOGNIZE HIM. WHEN A MAN MARRIES A WOMAN, AMEN, THE BRIDE, AMEN, ACCEPTS ALL THAT THE BRIDEGROOM HAS. I WANT TO SAY THIS TO you today. Amen. That there was a first Adam. How many KNOWS THAT? AND THERE WAS A A FIRST EVE. AND AND AND I CAN SAY THIS TO YOU. AMEN. THROUGH A PROPHET'S TEACHING, WE NOW UNDERSTAND, AMEN, THAT THERE IS A SECOND ADAM and there is a second Eve. AND WE FIND OUT THAT THE FIRST ADAM AND EVE FAIL. BUT A PROPHET SAID THE SECOND ADAM AND EVE WILL NOT AND CANNOT FALL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ARE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH WHAT HE'LL SAY, BROTHER ED. HE'LL SAY, "THEN WE ARE IN ANOTHER GARDEN of Eden." Amen. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS? HE'LL SAY, "LOOK, FOR 6,000 YEARS, HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING HE can to PERVERT GOD, WHAT GOD MADE." HE SAID, "SEE, IT'S NOW SATAN'S EDEN." NOW, HOW MANY CAN AGREE, AMEN, THAT THE SECOND ADAM is Christ? That's in the Bible. 1 Corinthians 15, it is written, "The first man, Adam, WAS MADE A LIVING SOUL, BUT THE LAST ADAM was made a quickening spirit." Ver said, "NOW SEE THE SECOND ADAM," he said, the first Adam LOST HIS POWER. BUT WE ARE TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE, LISTEN, I LOVE THAT, brother Tom. WE ARE TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE THAT WHAT THE FIRST ADAM LOST, AMEN, THE SECOND ADAM, CHRIST RESTORED AGAIN TO THE HUMAN RACE. AMEN. THERE IS A PROPHET OF GOD, MALACHI FOR WHO'S NOT INTRODUCING A NEW FAITH. HE'S TELLING YOU WHAT I'M SAYING UNTO YOU IS WHAT THE FIRST ADAM LOST, BUT IT'S BEING RESTORED BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. THEN IF THE FIRST ADAM IS CHRIST, THEN I CAN SAY TO YOU TODAY THE SECOND EVE IS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND PAUL SAID THAT THIS BODY HAS A HEAD. AND HE SAYS THE BODY IS THE CHURCH. And he SAID NOW IN THE BODY OF HIS FLESH through death to present you holy, unblameable, unreprovable in his sight. He said now look THROUGH THIS LIFE OF HIS SON, his cross, the blood. It says THERE OF HIS CROSS THAT HE MIGHT RECONCILE TO HIMSELF A BODY WHICH IS A BRIDE WHICH IS EVE THE SECOND EVE AND GOD GIVE IT IN TYPE. HE SAID NOW THE SAME THING HE DID IN ADAM and Eve. Amen. Giving them a type THAT THEY WERE THE TYPE OF CHRIST AND THE BRIDE. He is the second Adam. I'm laying A I'M LAYING A POINT HERE. HE IS THE SECOND ADAM AND THE CHURCH is the second Eve. HE SAID, "AND AS LONG AS THE SECOND EVE, AMEN, COMPROMISES AGAINST THE WORD, ISN'T SHE DOING THE SAME THING THAT THE FIRST EVE DID?" &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER BRAND BRINGS IT DOWN PRETTY CLEAR, DON'T HE? HE SAID, "NOW, THE CONGREGATION SAY AMEN." HE SAID, TRYING to say, "Well, it was for SOME OTHER AGE." HOW CAN IT BE ANOTHER AGE WHEN HE is the same yesterday, TODAY, AND FOREVER? HE SAID, "NOW, WATCH THIS. GOD PURPOSED THAT BUT HE HID IT FROM THE EYES OF THE WISE AND PRUDENT AND HE WOULD REVEAL IT UNTO THE BABES. NOW WATCH THIS SUCH AS WOULD LEARN SAID IT BEAUTIFUL. He said who were predestinated TO RECEIVE IT. MY THEN WE CAN SAY NOW AMEN YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS END TIME MESSAGE IS REJECTED BECAUSE IT'S NOT ANOTHER DENOMINATION. BROTHER DAVID PAUL IT'S THE REVELATION OF GOD'S MYSTERY. AMEN. GOD IS NOT KNOWN BY DENOMINATION SAINTS. HE IS KNOWN BY REVELATION. HE SAID LOOK GOD IN HIS BODY CHRIST AND CHRIST IN HIS BODY THE BRIDE. HE SAID GOD MADE MANIFEST IN CHRIST. THEN CHRIST IS MADE MANIFEST IN THE BRIDE. AND AS GOD TOOK FROM THE BODY OF ADAM THE WOMAN AND SHE FELL. THEN GOD HAS TOOK FROM THE BODY OF CHRIST HIS FLESH HIS BODY WHICH IS HIS WORD. LISTEN. and is bringing A BRIDE OUT THAT WON'T FALL BY DENOMINATION OR CREED. WELL, IF I WAS A DEVIL, I'D BE AGAIN YOU, TOO. IF I WAS A DEVIL, I WILL DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO KEEP YOU DISCOURAGED AND KEEP YOU DEPRESSED AND KEEP YOU UNDER CONDEMNATION BECAUSE YOU ARE UNDERNEATH A PROPHECY AND HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT THE PROPHECY OF THE WORD OF GOD SHALL NEVER FAIL. THERE WILL BE A BRIDE AND SHE WILL NOT FALL. SHE WON'T FALL BY CREED. SHE WON'T FALL BY DENOMINATION. HE SAID, "NO, SHE IS the second Eve." HALLELUJAH. SHE IS NOT BREAKING AND SPOOLING HER SKIRTS OF PURITY AND HOLINESS TO HER HUSBAND. SHE WILL STAY with his word &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANYBODY SAYS. YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE ECUMENICAL moves you WANT TO AND ALL THE AFFILIATIONS AND SHE WILL NEVER LEAVE THE WORD. I LOVE THIS IN THE MASTERPIECE. HE SAID, "THE SECOND Adam and the second Eve, BROTHER JOE, THEY ARE NOW READY FOR THE GARDEN, THE MILLENNIUM BACK ON THE EARTH." YOU KNOW WHAT HE CALLED THIS SECOND ADAM AND THIS SECOND EVE? HE CALLED HER THE MASTERPIECE FAMILY. AND HE SAID, "AND NOW THE MASTERPIECE FAMILY HAS COME AGAIN. IT'S CHRIST AND HIS BRIDE READY TO COME. THE SECOND ADAM, THE SECOND EVE ARE NOW READY TO RETURN BACK TO THEIR HOME." AND THE WHOLE PICTURE HAS BEEN REDEMPTION FROM WHERE IT WAS, BRINGING IT BACK JUST EXACTLY LIKE IT WAS. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, WHAT WAS IS NOT A MYSTERY. IT'S NOT A HISTORY. IT'S A REALITY. IT'S A REVELATION. LISTEN, I'M NOT CONTENDING FOR A BUNCH OF HYBRIDIZED THEOLOGICAL PERVERSIONS OF THE MOST SACRED BOOK THAT HAS EVER BEEN PUT INTO WRITING. I AM CONTENDING THAT THIS IS GOD'S WORD. I AM CONTENDING THAT IT IS MOVED OFF OF THE PAPER INTO THE FLESH OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. I AM CONTENDING THAT WE ARE NOT ANOTHER CHURCH. WE ARE THE MANY MEMBERED BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. I AM CONTENDING WE ARE NOT UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF A MAN. WE'RE UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF THE WORD. I AM CONTENDING THAT THERE WILL BE MIRACLES. THERE WILL BE SIGNS. THERE WILL be wonders. THERE WILL BE HOLY GHOST MANIFESTATION. THERE WILL BE SOULS SAVED. THERE WILL BE SHACKLES BROKE. THERE WILL BE DEAD RAISED. THERE WILL BE SICK HEALED. THERE WILL BE HOMES RESTORED. THERE WILL BE LIVES TRANSFORMED. I AM CONTENDING upon the convictions of the revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; IN THE AGE I'M LIVING IN. AMEN. I can tell you today a prophet God said the fall in the garden did a lot to man, didn't it? &gt;&gt; You know what IT DONE? IT CAUSED MAN TO BECOME conscious to the fact he was made superior over everything. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And inferior to nothing. Now think about that. Superior over everything. Inferior to nothing. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN dominion &gt;&gt; over the foul of the air, &gt;&gt; over the fish OF THE SEA. OVER EVERYTHING THAT LAYS OR CREEPS UPON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN DOMINION. NOW WHEN GOD MADE MAN SUPERIOR to everything on the earth, HE SAYS THAT POWER WAS OPERATED BY A LAW. RIGHT? AND HE SAID NOW WHAT WAS THAT LAW? IT WAS THE LAW OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH IN GENESIS 3 WHEN THE SERPENT MADE HIS ATTACK BROTHER BEN IS POWERFUL. HIS ATTACK WAS ON THE FAITH OF GOD. WHEN THE SERPENT ATTACKED EVE, HE WAS ATTACKING THE FAITH OF GOD BY PRESENTING WISDOM. SO THE FALL IN THE GARDEN WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE contest between WISDOM AND FAITH OR AS WE KNOW WISDOM VERSUS FAITH. NOW LET ME SAY this to you. Amen. Serpent attacked the simplicity OF THE FAITH OF GOD. LOOK HOW SIMPLE IT WAS, BROTHER JARED. IF THE WIND WAS TOO HIGH, THE LAW OF GOD IN ADAM COULD SPEAK AND SAY, "NOW CALM DOWN, WIND. IF THERE WAS A TREE AND SISTER NISH, IT WAS WHERE YOU ARE AND EVE LOOKED OVER AT ADAM AND SAID, "AND I KNOW YOU WIVES would never do this. Won't anything change in the front yard?" But but if HE LOOKED OVER THERE AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THAT TREE OVER THERE IN THAT CORNER OF THE GARDEN." ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS SAY, "TREE, GET UP AND MOVE." &gt;&gt; NOW, come on. You You brothers know what I'm talking about. Amen. When you were I remember when I was dating my wife. Amen. I was just a country boy. I didn't know any better. And I pulled up and I I gonna tell everything, but I pulled up and you KNOW, I HAD THIS I HAD THIS OLD 99 FORD F350. Thought it was the greatest thing ever made, Carter. I mean, it was a big truck DY. I mean, I SURPRISED THAT THING. I PULLED UP TO pick her up at school ONE DAY AND I TURNED in there. I was going to pull up and pick her up. Had them camo I'm showing how country I am. Had them camo rain guards and camo door cover. AND BROTHER WESLEY, I PULLED IN THERE IN FRONT OF THIS GREAT OLD BIG SCHOOL and I GOT STUCK RIGHT THERE IN THE TRAFFIC LINE CUZ THAT DOULY WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THERE. BUT BUT I WAS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS YOU'RE TRYING TO DATE, RIGHT? YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPRESS HER, YOU KNOW? AMEN. LET ME GO GET THE car for you. Let me OPEN THE DOOR. COME ON. ADAM HAD US ALL BEAT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE HAD US ALL BEAT. AMEN. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS SPEAK AND WHAT SHE WANTED WOULD APPEAR. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW WATCH THIS. BUT THE SERPENT COME IN AND BEGIN TO ATTACK THAT AUTHORITY BY OFFERING WISDOM. AND BROTHER SAID, "WHAT IS SATAN'S WEAPON AGAINST YOU IS TO TRY TO GET YOU TO DISBELIEVE YOUR WEAPON. HE DISARMS YOU." HE SAID, "IF HE CAN GET YOU TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR WEAPON IS EQUIVALENT, IF HE GETS YOU TO BELIEVE YOUR WEAPON IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH, HE HAS DISARMED YOU." OH, BROTHER NEVILLE, I HOPE WE NEVER LEAVE THAT. He said, "LOOK, HE'S DISARMED YOU WHEN he gets YOU TO BELIEVE YOUR DISBELIEVE YOUR WEAPON." SO, ADAM'S WEAPON WAS THE AUTHORITY OF THE FAITH OF GOD OPERATING THROUGH HIS LIFE. LOOK WHAT HE SAYS. WHEN YOU LAY THAT DOWN, WHEN YOU LAY YOUR WEAPON DOWN, THAT FINISHES YOUR FIGHT. HE SAID, "WHAT HAPPENS? YOU ARE DONE." NOW WATCH A PROPHET. HE SAYS, "HOLD YOUR WEAPON." HOW MANY WILL RECEIVE THAT? HE SAYS, "HOLD YOUR WEAPON. DON'T YOU LAY IT DOWN." COME ON, CHURCH. THE DEVIL DON'T HAVE TO SHOOT YOU AND THEN TAKE YOUR ARMOR AWAY OR WEAPON TO DISARM YOU. IF HE CAN JUST GET IN YOUR MIND AND GET YOU TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE IS NOT ENOUGH AND THE HOLY GHOST YOU HAVE IS NOT ENOUGH AND THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOUL IS NOT ENOUGH. THE VERY MINUTE YOU BEGIN TO THINK THOSE OLD DEMON THOUGHTS IS THE VERY MINUTE THAT DEVIL BEGINS TO DISARM YOU. BUT I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME FOR THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST TO GET HER WEAPON BACK IN HER HAND AND SAY THE THOUGHTS THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE PURE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE HOLY. THEY'RE GOING TO BE OF GOOD VALUE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE OF GOOD REPORT. I REFUSE TO BE A DISARMED CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, YOU SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, PREACHER?" I'M SAYING, "CONTEND FOR YOUR WEAPON." &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? I'M SAYING, "CONTEND FOR YOUR WEAPON. CONTEND FOR THIS MESSAGE. CONTEND FOR THE HOLY GHOST. CONTEND FOR THE REALITY OF JESUS CHRIST." NOW, look what THE BIBLE SAYS IN GENESIS 3:1. Is this okay? IT SAYS, "NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE SUBTLE THAN ANY BEAST OF THE FIELD WHICH THE LORD GOD HAD MADE." NOW WATCH THIS WORD SUBTLE. IT MEANS SHREWD, &gt;&gt; CRAFTY, SLY, SENSIBLE, PRUDENT. Now look WHAT IT SAYS IN GENESIS 3:6. AND THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD FOR food and THAT IT WAS PLEASANT TO THE EYE AND WAS A TREE TO BE DESIRED. NOW WATCH THIS. TO MAKE ONE WISE. &gt;&gt; She took of the fruit thereof and did eat AND GAVE ALSO UNTO HER HUSBAND WITH HER and he did eat. Now look at this word wise. It means to be PRUDENT TO BE WISELY UNDERSTAND. LISTEN, IT MEANS TO HAVE SUCCESS. BROTHER JARED, WHEN THE SERPENT COME TO EVE, NOW NOW COME ON FOLKS. SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE TO THE TO THE TO THE CREATION OF GOD. SHE WAS MARRIED TO GOD IN FLESH. SHE LET ME BACK UP AND SAY THIS. SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE SPOKEN WORD OF GOD. ADAM CREATED, RIGHT? BUT THEN THIS SERPENT COME AND WATCH WHAT HE DONE. HE BEGAN TO SAY, "NOW, IF YOU'LL LEAVE THAT &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL COME WITH ME, YOU'LL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL." I JUST PICKED UP SOMETHING AND I'M going to PREACH A SECOND. HOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN WRECKED? &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm not a politician. I'M A PREACHER. HOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN WRECKED BECAUSE WOMEN GOT THEIR EYES ON OTHER MEN? &gt;&gt; COME ON. AND A SPIRIT COME IN AND SAID, "NOW, IF YOU'LL LEAVE THAT, IF YOU'LL LEAVE YOUR HUSBAND AND COME OVER HERE WITH ME, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S A DEVIL." AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT DID. IT DIDN'T START 10 YEARS AGO. IT STARTED ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN WHEN THE SERPENT TOLD EVE, "IF YOU'LL JUST COME AWAY FROM ADAM, IF YOU'LL JUST GET AWAY FROM THAT WORD, I'LL MAKE YOU SO SUCCESSFUL." YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET GOD SAID? HE SAID, "RAFAIR THE SERPENT PERVERTED THE THIRST OF SUCCESS IN THE SOUL OF HUMANITY." YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID, "IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WANT TO REALLY BE RIGHT WITH GOD, TAKE MY ADVICE." LISTEN TO ME. GOD DON'T MEAN THAT. REB SAID THAT IS THE HISS OF THE SERPENT. HE SAID THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD FOR FOOD. Now listen to a prophet. Now this is THIS IS POWERFUL. HE SAID, "SEE WHAT IT WAS? HIS REASONINGS BROUGHT HER TO know that it was right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT WAS TRUE. BROTHER DAVID, THAT MAKES ME WANT TO STOP AND PREACH FOR TWO HOURS. THE SERPENT'S REASONING HAD THE ABILITY TO AFFECT EVE ENOUGH. IT WASN'T TRUE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HE WAS PRESENTING, HE HAD ENOUGH REASONING BEHIND IT THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT TRUTH TO HER. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? SOMETIMES YOU BELIEVE THINGS THAT AIN'T REALLY TRUE, but they're true to you. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU YOU GET IN YOUR MIND, EVERYBODY'S AGAINST YOU, AND THAT AIN'T THE TRUTH. BUT THE DEMON OF REASONING HAS SO PERVERTED THE AFFECTION IN YOUR SOUL THAT EVERYBODY'S AGAINST YOU. NOBODY LOVES YOU. AMEN. WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THE GLOVES OFF OF THIS MORNING AND SAY, "I AM THE SECOND EVE. I AM NOT THE FIRST EVE. I REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE HISS OF THE SERPENT AND ALLOW THE DEVIL TO BEGIN TO PERVERT THINGS IN MY MIND AND PARALYZE MY FAITH. &gt;&gt; NOW, BROTHER, THAT BREAKS IT ON DOWN. HE SAID, "SATAN is presenting knowledge. KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS CONTRARY TO the word." &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; So, SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ADVICE, MAKE SURE IT'S COMING from the word. &gt;&gt; Can we preach? YOU DON'T TAKE FINANCIAL ADVICE FROM YOUR BROKE UNCLE. &gt;&gt; Brother David, it's good to have you back up here this morning. You got my back. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU DON'T GO TAKE ADVICE FROM YOUR BROKE UNCLE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAKE SURE THE ADVICE YOU'RE GETTING IS COMING FROM A PURE SOURCE. WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT. AMEN. AND MAKE SURE YOUR ADVICE, AMEN, THAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR YOUR HOME IS COMING FROM THE WORD OF GOD AND IT'S NOT UNDER THE H OF THE SERPENT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO MAKE ONE WISE. NOW WATCH THIS. AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE NAKED. NOW BROTHER SAID IT BEAUTIFUL. HE SAID THERE'S ONLY TWO SOURCES WE DRAW OUR LIFE FROM. He said there's ONE WISDOM AND THE OTHER IS FAITH. HE SAID NOW YOU WILL SEE WHAT WISDOM PRODUCES AND THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT FAITH PRODUCES. HE SAID, "BRING THEM UP OUT OF THE BIBLE AND SHOW WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO, AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE." SO, WISDOM WILL DO SOMETHING. IT'LL SHOW YOU IT. IT'LL WHEN YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT WISDOM FROM THE BIBLE, YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS, WHAT IT'S DOING, AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO. YOU CAN LOOK AT FAITH AND SEE WHAT IT DONE, WHAT IT'S DOING, AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO. NOW, I LOVE THIS. ARE YOU WITH ME? IN GENESIS 1, THE BIBLE SAYS THIS, THAT FAITH AND WISDOM WAS BOTH INTRODUCED. RIGHT? IN THE BEGINNING, GOD CREATED HIM SAID, "SEE, GOD WAS THE AUTHOR OF FAITH." HE SAID, "AND SATAN IS THE AUTHOR OF WISDOM. HE'S TRYING TO GET THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT HIS WISDOM." NOW, LISTEN TO THIS. AND PULL THEM AWAY FROM THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; NOW, ARE YOU ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? THE SERPENT IS STILL AROUND, FOLKS. AND HE'S TRYING TO PULL THE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE FAITH. GENESIS 3 WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTEST BETWEEN WISDOM AND FAITH. NOW WATCH THIS. OUR WISDOM DOES NOT COME FROM SATAN. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram SAID, LOOK, HE SAID THE EARTHLY WISDOM DOES, it was inherited FROM ME. AND NOW NOW, NOW CAN YOU TAKE A PROFIT? &gt;&gt; HE SAID, WHERE EVE SWAPPED OFF FAITH FOR WISDOM. &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. THEN I CAN BRING IT TO TODAY AND I CAN SAY, "BROTHER BRIAN, WE ARE IN THE FINAL CONTEST. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE FINAL ROUNDS OF THE GREAT CONTEST BETWEEN WISDOM AND FAITH." NOW, I WANT YOU TO WATCH THIS BECAUSE IN GENESIS 3, IT ACTUALLY PARALLELS WITH 2 CORINTHIANS 11. AFTER THE FALL IN THE GARDEN, THE WOMAN RECEIVES HER OWN IDENTITY, WHICH IS APART FROM ADAM, AND SHE RECEIVES A NAME AND IS NAMED EVE. NOW, IF YOU IF YOU LIKE TO STUDY YOUR BIBLES, ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; IF YOU LIKE TO STUDY YOUR BIBLES, YOU CAN RUN A CHAIN ON THE NAME EVE. OKAY? AND YOU'LL FIRST READ IT RIGHT THERE IN GENESIS 3:20. AND ADAM CALLED HIS WIFE'S NAME EVE BECAUSE SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVING. THE SECOND TIME YOU read the name Eve IS IN GENESIS 4:1. AND IT SAYS, "ADAM KNEW EVE, HIS WIFE." NOW LISTEN FROM GENESIS 4, EVE IS NOT MENTIONED AGAIN UNTIL 2 CORINTHIANS 11 WHEN PAUL IS MOVED TO WRITE A WARNING OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NATURAL IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE SPIRITUAL. AND IN 2 CORINTHIANS 11:3 HE SAYS, "AS THE SERPENT BEGOUT EVE THROUGH HER SUBILITY, SO YOUR MINDS SHOULD BE CORRUPTED FROM THE SIMPLICITY THAT'S IN CHRIST." LOOK AT THIS WORD CORRUPTED. IT MEANS TO LEAD AWAY A CHRISTIAN CHURCH FROM THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE AND HOLINESS IN WHICH IT OUGHT TO ABIDE, TO PERISH, TO CORRUPT, TO DEFILE, TO DESTROY. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. THE MIND IS THE WOMB OF THE SPIRIT. THERE IS A WOMB OF THE PHYSICAL. THERE IS A WOMB OF THE SPIRIT. AND THE MIND IS THE WOMB TO THE SPIRIT. BURB SAID, "THAT'S HOW ADULTERY IS COMMITTED SPIRITUALLY IS WHEN YOU KNOW HIM BETTER." AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY THE WORD OF GOD, BUT BY THE INNER COURSE OF THE MIND, YOU TAKE IN A LIE OF THE DEVIL. NOW LISTEN, IT'S AGAINST THE WORD. LOOK HERE. AMEN. THE SAME WAY NATURAL ADULTERY IS COMMITTED, HE SAYS. AND WHEN THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST LETS MAN-MADE CREEDS AND DOGMAS TAKE THE PLACE OF THE WORD, SHE IS COMMITTING ADULTERY. NOW WATCH, WHOSOEVER, NOW I'M IN THE BIBLE, AIN'T I? WHOSOEVER LOOKTH UPON A WOMAN TO LUST AFTER HER IN HIS HEART, HAS COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH HER ALREADY, NEVER LAID A HAND ON HER, NEVER GOT PHYSICAL, BUT JUST WHAT ENTERED HIS MIND. OH, GOD BRINGS A SPIRIT OF ADULTERY UPON THAT HEART. SAID, "WELL, THAT'S THE SAME THING IN THE SPIRITUAL. YOU LET IT COME INTO YOUR MIND." &gt;&gt; WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. I'M HOME. AMEN. WHAT ARE WE LETTING COME INTO OUR MIND? IT'S AFFECTING OUR FELLOWSHIP. IT'S AFFECTING THE WAY WE SPEAK TO PEOPLE. IT'S AFFECTING THE WAY WE ACT. &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. I SAY IT'S TIME TO SAY, "HOLY GHOST, BAPTIZE MY MIND. CLEAN OUT THE CHANNELS of my heart." BECAUSE WHATEVER IS IN THAT WOMB IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BRING FORTH. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. WE JUST DEDICATED OUR BABY. THAT IS A PRODUCT OF WHAT COME OUT OF THE WOMB. AND WHATEVER YOU'RE MANIFESTING IN THE SPIRIT WORLD IS A PRODUCT OF WHAT YOU'RE ALLOWING TO COME INTO YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; NOW, brother said through his bride, through the word, he's going to bring up the millennium. Now, I want to say something to you. Satan was able by wisdom and reasoning to begile EVE AND DRAW THE HUMAN RACE away from the living faith to live by knowledge, right? wisdom and reason. Now I want to say this to you. There is a wisdom of God. Bre said there's a wisdom from above. It's first pure. It's peaceable, gentle. This is the Bible. Each of being treated full of mercy and good fruit without partiality. Now watch this. And the wisdom that is from above is without hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? BROTHER SAID, "NOW WATCH." HE SAID, "THERE IS A WISDOM OF GOD AND HERE IT IS. STAY WITH HIS WORD. BUT SATAN IN HIS WISDOM IS TRIED TO TWIST THE WORD SO THAT THE WISDOM I'M SPEAKING OF, HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN, THIS IS POWERFUL. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FAITH THAT GOES WITH SATAN. IN ORDER TO ACCEPT SATAN, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE SATAN. &gt;&gt; Church of the living God, I'm trying to behave, but I'm feeling pretty good where Wesley TO ACCEPT SATAN, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE SATAN. AND THERE IS A PERVERTED FAITH TO A PERVERTED THING. DO YOU NOT SEE THE HISS OF THE SERPENT? AMEN. HOW DO YOU ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST? YOU BELIEVE ON HIM AND THEN YOU BRING FORTH OUT OF YOUR SPIRITUAL WOMB WHAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED FROM HIM. Oh my. HE SAID, "NOW WATCH ALL SATAN AND HIS POWER, HE'S GOT IS A PERVERTED POWER." HE SAID, "NOW WE'RE GOING TO REFER TO IT AS WISDOM BECAUSE IT'S NOT SATAN'S FAITH." HE SAID, "WATCH." NOW, NOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "A LIE IS ONLY THE TRUTH MISTOLD. A LIE, BROTHER XAVIER, IS ONLY THE TRUTH MISTOLD. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IT. DO YOU REALIZE A LIE GETS AROUND THE WORLD THREE TIMES BEFORE THE truth ever gets its boots on? &gt;&gt; Oh, God. AMEN. NOW, WATCH THIS. SO, EVE HAD TO DENY GOD'S WORD BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE IN SATAN'S LIE. &gt;&gt; NOW, WATCH THIS. AND PAUL IS WRITING TO TIMOTHY IN 1 TIMOTHY 4 AND HE USES THE SAME EVENT OF GENESIS 3 AND SAYS,"DO NOT GIVE HEED TO SEDUCING SPIRITS &gt;&gt; AND DOCTRINES OF DEVILS." LOOK AT THIS WORD, SEDUCING, DECEIVER, WONDERING, ROVING, MISLEADING, leading into error. &gt;&gt; My God, &gt;&gt; we got a pulse in here. OF AGABON, &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; AN IMPOSTOR, A CORRUPTOR. &gt;&gt; LOOK HERE. WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY SPEAK LIES IN HYPOCRISY, HAVING THEIR CONSCIENCE SEARED WITH A HOT IRON. NOW, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S BEAUTIFUL WHAT A PROPHET SAYS? HE SAYS, "WHEN JUDE BEGAN TO WRITE IN JUDE 1, HE SAID HE WAS RIDING WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE SPIRIT SPOKE THROUGH PAUL IN 2 TIMOTHY 3:1 WHEN HE SAID THIS, KNOW ALSO IN WHERE THE LAST DAYS." ANOINTED ONES AT THE END TIME. BROTHER SAYS, STOP. UNDERLINE THAT. LAST DAYS, RIGHT? NOW, WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. THEY WILL HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS, &gt;&gt; BUT WILL DENY THE POWER THEREOF. AND LOOK WHAT PAUL SAYS. HE SAYS FROM SUCH TURN AWAY. &gt;&gt; HE DON'T SAY EMBRACE IT. HE DON'T SAY FELLOWSHIP IT. HE DON'T SAY OPEN IT UP AND BRING IT INTO YOUR HOME. HE SAID TURN AWAY FROM IT. FOR THIS IS THE SORT OF THEY WHICH CREEP INTO HOUSES AND LEAD CAPTIVE silly women LADEN WITH SINS AND LED AWAY WITH DIVERS LUST. NOW WATCH THIS. EVER LEARNING BUT NEVER ABLE TO COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH. HE SAID, NOW LISTEN, IT WAS THAT SAME GROUP OF FUNDAMENTALIST BELIEVERS THAT PUT JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS AND KILLED HIM BECAUSE HE HAD SIGNS AND WONDERS AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. NOW LISTEN, THAT SAME SPIRIT LIVES AMONG THE church today. &gt;&gt; IT'S A RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. IT'S NOT A BUNCH OF INFIDELS. IT'S NOT A FUNDAMENTAL BUNCH. AMEN. NO, IT IS A fundamental bunch. He said, "PLACE IT RIGHT OUT THERE." AND THEY'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I'VE BEEN EVANGELIZING AND PREACHING SINCE I WAS A YOUNG MAN. IF I'VE EVER LIVED TO SEE THE FULFILLMENT OF THAT, you're seeing it right now. TAKE THE BIBLE. TAKE THE MESSAGE, TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND PROVE WHAT'S WRONG. AND PEOPLE STILL LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, "WELL, I DON'T FEEL THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS." WELL, COME ON, CHURCH. BROTHER SAID THEY HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS FUNDAMENTALLY RIGHT, BUT WILL DENY THE POWER THEREOF, THE POWER OF WHAT? THE POWER OF HEALING, THE POWER OF SHOUTING, THE POWER OF SPEAKING IN TONGUES, THE POWER OF INTERPRETING. LISTEN, THE POWER OF THE CHURCH MOVING. &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU? AMEN. DON'T LET IT EVER BE SAID ABOUT ONE MEMBER OF GRACE TABERNACLE THAT WE'RE SO REBELLIOUS AND WE'RE SO STUBBORN AND WE'RE SO INFLUENCED BY THE HISS OF THE SERPENT THAT WE STAND IN THE WAY OF THE CHURCH MOVING FORWARD. &gt;&gt; OH, THE CHURCH MOVING FORWARD LIKE IT IN THE BEGINNING. OH, BROTHER, SISTER, WE ARE CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH. NOW, NOW, CAN I SHOW Y'ALL SOMETHING? I'M IN THE WORD. IS THAT OKAY? I'm moving to the second seal. AMEN. SEDUCING SPIRITS. THEY BEGIN TO DENY THE REVELATION of the word. REMEMBER SAID SEDUCES WHAT? A SEDUCING spirit in the church. &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAYS THAT IS CLERGY. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; CAN I CALL WHAT BROTHER CALLED IT, BROTHER BRIAN? IS THAT OKAY? &gt;&gt; SEDUCING CLERGY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; WORKINGS OF DEVILS. HYPOCRISIES IN THE CHURCH. HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT DENYING THE REVELATION THE POWER AND THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT FROM SUCH TURN AWAY SAID HERE IN THE CHURCH AGE BOOK I'M going to lay this in and nail that devil's hide down HERE IS WHERE WE RECEIVE THE true revelation of the serpent seed here IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE WORD SAYS EVE WAS BEGALLED BY THE SERPENT YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID SHE WAS ACTUALLY SEDUCED BY THE SERPENT. LISTEN, FOLKS. AMEN. HERE'S SOMEONE AGO ASKING ME THE QUESTION NOW. NOW, NOW CAN I CAN I SLOW DOWN and and and read this TO YOU? &gt;&gt; DID GOD TELL EVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THE serpent or the serpent WOULD SEDUCE HER? NOW, LISTEN. GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ONE THING ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. JUST GET THE POINT OF THE STORY. He simply gave the word. &gt;&gt; HE SAID NOT TO PARTAKE OF KNOWLEDGE. MY GOODNESS. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN." AMEN. &gt;&gt; PARTAKE OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND LIFE WAS THE WORD OF GOD. NOW LISTEN. AND DEATH WAS ANYTHING THAT THE WORD NOW DEATH WAS ANYTHING THAT WASN'T THE WORD OF GOD. NOW LISTEN, SHE ALLOWED ONE WORD TO BE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; Just one WORD TO BE CHANGED, BROTHER BOBBY. AND RIGHT THEN, SATAN HAD HER. &gt;&gt; MY GOODNESS. HE DIDN'T HAVE HER, BROTHER MAD. WHEN WHEN HE BROUGHT THE ACT ABOUT, HE HAD HER THE VERY MINUTE HE GOT IN HER MIND. AND CONVINCED HER THAT WHAT SHE WAS BELIEVING, AMEN, WAS NOT EXACTLY THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; CHURCH, I'M PREACHING TO YOU. GOD FORBID WE ALLOW THE SERPENT FATHERS TO HISS OVER OUR FAMILIES AND HISS OVER OUR CHILDREN CUZ WE DON'T HAVE THE CHRISTIAN COURAGE TO STAND ON the convictions OF THE WORD OF GOD. FOLKS, YOU SAY, "PREACHER, YOU'RE GETTING PRETTY STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS." I AM. BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO DESTROY THE HOME. HE'S TRYING TO DESTROY THE FAMILY. AND IF HE DESTROYS THE HOME, HE WILL DESTROY THE CHURCH. A CHURCH IS ONLY AS STRONG AS THE FAMILIES THAT MAKE IT UP. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; God could have said, "Don't pick more fruit off of that tree than you can eat." &gt;&gt; And Satan could say, "Look, that is quite right. You see, if you pick too much, it'll rot. But here is a method of preserving the fruit. Folks, brother Ram's holding it down, ain't he? &gt;&gt; AND YET AT THE SAME TIME, YOU CAN PICK all you want. &gt;&gt; Now, here's a method of being in the church and still being in the world. &gt;&gt; And here's a method of not believing in the power of God and still being in the church. And &gt;&gt; so you see now look what he said. You can have your way and God's way at the same time. &gt;&gt; The devil would have had her right there. &gt;&gt; He that is guilty in one point of the law has broken the &gt;&gt; whole law. Don't you fool with that word. &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm I'm going to I'm going to keep &gt;&gt; I'm pushing that devil. Brother Ram will keep on bulldozing him. Okay. &gt;&gt; Jezebel seduced the servants of God to commit fornication. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said like this. He said I suffer. He reads that scripture suffest. He said that's tolerate and seduce my servants to commit fornication. Now brother picks this up and says in this satire and church age she is a dominating female. She is mystery Babylon. She is the great She is Jezebel the false prophetess. Why? Because the true female is submissive to God. &gt;&gt; Christ is her head. Now I'm I'm I'm going to pull out of this. Okay. She has no word but he is. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS NO FAULT BUT HIS. SHE HAS NO LEADERSHIP BUT HIS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS CHURCH? SHE HAS CAST OUT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS DESTROYED THE BIBLES AND WERE THE ESSAYS OF THE GODLY. SHE HAS SLAIN THOSE who would preach the truth. She has taken over kings, PRINCES, NATIONS, CONTROLS ARMIES, AND INSIST THAT THIS IS THE TRUE BODY OF CHRIST AND THAT HER POPES ARE THE BACKERS OF CHRIST. NOW LISTEN TO THE PROPHET. SHE IS ENTIRELY SEDUCED BY THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; UNTIL SHE IN TURN HAS BECOME THE seducer of others. &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN WHEN SOMEBODY BECOMES SEDUCED by the devil, &gt;&gt; they begin to start trying to seduce others &gt;&gt; into the error that they're a part of. &gt;&gt; But she now it's pretty straight. SHE IS THE BRIDE OF SATAN. NOW WATCH THIS. HAS PRODUCED HIS MASTERCH CHILD RELIGIONS. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, NOW WATCH THIS. SEDUCING SPIRITS WILL LEAD PEOPLE FROM TRUTH TO ERROR. &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT LOOK WHAT PAUL SAID. HE SAID, "AFTER MY DEPARTING, SHALL GRIEVOUS WOLVES ENTER IN AMONG YOU, NOT SPARING THE FLOCK. ALSO, OF YOUR OWN SELVES SHALL MEN ARISE, SPEAKING PERVERSE THINGS." NOW, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? TO DRAW AWAY DISCIPLES AFTER THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT TIMOTHY SAID? HE SAID, "SEDUCERS SHALL WAX WORSE AND WORSE. THEY will deceive and be deceived." BUT LOOK WHAT HE SAYS IN SECOND TIMOTHY 2 TIMOTHY 3:14. HE SAYS, "BUT CONTINUE THOU IN THE THINGS WHICH THOU HAST LEARNED AND HAS BEEN ASSURED OF KNOWING OF THEM, KNOWING OF WHOM THOU HAST LEARNED THEM, OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, WHEN THE WORLD HAS BELIEVED A SEDUCING SPIRIT AND IS FULFILLING PROPHECY AND IS DEPARTING FROM THE FAITH AND HAS BECOME THE SEDUCER OF OTHERS." HALLELUJAH. THERE WILL BE A BRIDE WHO WILL BE STANDING UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST THE WORD. SHE WILL BE POSITIONED UNDER THE REVELATION. SHE WILL NOT HAVE TIME FOR MAN'S IDEAS. SHE WILL NOT HAVE TIME FOR SEDUCING SPIRITS BECAUSE SHE WILL BE STANDING AS A CONTENDER FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE SAINT. OH, I WONDER THIS MORNING. IS THERE ANYBODY SAY, "LISTEN HERE, DEVIL. YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT THE FIRST EVE, BUT YOU WON'T GET THIS ONE. YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT THE FIRST EVE, BUT YOU WILL NOT GET THIS ONE BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT HISS OVER MY FAMILY. YOU WILL NOT HISS OVER MY CONVICTIONS. YOU WILL NOT HISS OVER THIS CHURCH. You will not hiss over this pastor. You will not hiss over this pullpit. WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND WE STAND FOR the restoration OF THE FAITH OF GOD BY THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW, somebody shout amen. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Got to pull up out of it. Amen. Now listen. THOSE THAT DEPART from the faith, you know what? They become repribates. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Concerning the faith. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to skip over some stuff here because I want to get to something. Jesus said this, "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith?" Remember said, "Will he find Malachi 4 fulfilled?" &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4, Elijah the prophet, William, Mary, and Brandon is off the scene today. &gt;&gt; He is not here in a physical corporate body. I don't care how much spiritual fanaticism people come up with. &gt;&gt; He is not here in a corporate body. &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORD OF MALACHI 4 &gt;&gt; IS RIGHT HERE. AND WHAT HAS IT DONE? IT HAS RESTORED THE FAITH. NOW I WANT I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU. SOME WERE ORDAINED to depart. &gt;&gt; But brother, SOME WERE ORDAINED TO CONTEND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER MORGAN, SOME WERE ordained to believe them seducing SPIRITS AND TO ALLOW HYPOCRISY AND TO FOLLOW THE HISS OF THE SERPENT AND TO LET THE DEVIL BEGILE THEM IN THEIR MINDS AND DESTROY THEIR HOMES AND DESTROY THEIR FAMILY. BUT THERE WERE SOME, BROTHER JARED THAT WAS ORDAINED TO CONTEND. YOU KNOW WHAT BROTHER SAID? HE SAID RIGHT HERE HE SAID NOW HOW MANY BELIEVES JESUS CHRIST? WILL YOU RAISE YOUR HAND? HOW MANY WILL SAY I BELIEVE JESUS CHRIST? NOW BROTHER SAYS THAT AND HE STOPS AND SAYS HOW MANY WILL RAISE YOUR HAND AND SAY I WILL NEVER DOUBT NO MORE IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; How many will raise your hand and say I will never doubt no more in my life? Now this is a trick question. &gt;&gt; How many will raise your hand and say I will not doubt no more in my life. real high. You'll raise it real high. Rebraham said, "Why was it some of you camp your hands down?" &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I told you, but I'm in the quote, not in the church. Okay? Though one would RAISE FROM THE DEAD, YET YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. HE SAID, "NO MATTER WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE, THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WERE BORN NOT TO BELIEVE." &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID THEY WERE ORDAINED OF OLD TO THIS CONDEMNATION. OH, BUT AREN'T YOU HAPPY TONIGHT, &gt;&gt; BROTHER MARK? AREN'T YOU HAPPY TONIGHT THAT GOD HAS TENDERED YOUR HEART TO LOOK TO CALVARY and believe? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?" BECAUSE HE SHALL TURN THE HEART OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN. HE SHALL TURN THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN TO THE FATHER. AREN'T YOU HAPPY TONIGHT THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR WHICH HAS BEEN PREACHED IN THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST HAS TENDERED YOUR HEART AND YOU CAN LOOK AWAY FROM THE SERPENTS? You can look away from seducing spirits and you can look to Jesus and live. &gt;&gt; Turn back to the faith. Turn back to the Bible. Now, can I say something to you, brother Andrew? What is this message of the hour you're talking about? Are you ready for it? &gt;&gt; Are are you ready? REPENT &gt;&gt; AND TURN BACK TO THE FAITH OF THE FATHERS. &gt;&gt; Turn now. Now say this with me. Turn back to the faith. &gt;&gt; Can you say something else? Contend for the faith. &gt;&gt; Contend for the faith. &gt;&gt; Can I take it a step further? &gt;&gt; Continue in the faith. &gt;&gt; Continue in THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; TURN BACK TO THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; CONTEND FOR THE FAITH. CONTINUE THOU IN THE FAITH. GROUNDED AND SETTLED AND BE NOT MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOPE OF THE GOSPEL WHICH YE HAVE HEARD AND WHICH WAS PREACHED TO EVERY CREATURE WHICH IS UNDER HEAVEN. WHEREFORE I APOLOG SAID, WHAT IS IT? He said, IT'S A COMMISSION TO US TO CONTINUE. HOLD ON UNTIL HE COMES. &gt;&gt; WELL, LET ME HAVE SOME PREACHING ROOM. HOLD ON UNTIL HE COMES. HALLELUJAH. BROTHER ANTHONY, THERE IS A PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH THIS MORNING WHO WILL NOT TURN LOOSE. THEY WILL NOT BACK UP. THEY WILL NOT LAY DOWN. THEY WILL NOT COMPROMISE. THEY WILL NOT GIVE IN. THEY WILL HOLD ON. They will hold on. REMEMBER THE MATCH. THEY WILL HOLD ON IN THE GOOD TIMES. THEY WILL HOLD ON IN THE BAD TIMES. THEY WILL HOLD ON when they're on the mountain. THEY WILL HOLD ON WHEN THEY'RE IN THE VALLEY. BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ESTABLISHED in the faith. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say something to you. There's only two types of people left in the earth today. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this, &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby? It's contenders and departers. &gt;&gt; Contenders know who they were. I I'm I got a few more. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Jesus know it by faith in the revelation of God's word in his own predestinated life. Jesus knew who he was. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; How many will accept the rest of it? &gt;&gt; Satan was wondering. &gt;&gt; JESUS KNEW WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; SATAN WAS WONDERING. HE KNOW THAT HE WAS A PREDESTINATED CREATURE OF GOD. THAT GOD HIMSELF WAS MANIFESTED IN HIM. IT WASN'T HIM DOING THE WORKS. NOW, IF JESUS knew who he was, THEN WHAT ABOUT THIS PREDESTINATED BRIDE BODY? &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. I'm preaching to you this morning. I'M GOING TO DELIVER THE MAIL TO YOUR ADDRESS. YOU MAY BE WEAK. YOU MAY BE TIRED, BUT YOU'RE A CONTENDER. &gt;&gt; You may be weary AND WELLOING, BUT YOU'RE A CONTENDER. YOU MAY BE BROKENHEARTED, BUT YOU'RE A CONTENDER. YOU MAY BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN, BUT YOU'RE A CONTENDER. You may be perplexed, BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RENOUNCE ALL YOUR HOPE BECAUSE YOU ARE A CONTENDER. And you know WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THE BIBLE SAYS THE PEOPLE, CAN I CHANGE THAT? THE CONTENDERS THAT DO KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL BE WEAK AND BARELY HOLDING ON AND BARELY OVERCOMING and barely able to worship and barely make it to CHURCH AND BARELY STAY AWAKE WHILE THE PREACHER'S PREACHING. OH NO, THOSE THAT KNOW THEIR GOD WILL BE STRONG. THEY'LL BE STRONG AND THEY'LL DO GREAT EXPLOITS. You know WHY THEY'LL BE STRONG? BECAUSE THEY'RE ON SOME VITAMINS. Oh yeah. The prodigal said, "We need some spiritual vitamins in the church today." You know what he said? He said, "If the children get the right kind of vitamins, &gt;&gt; come on. Come on all you vitamin pushers. &gt;&gt; Is it safe?" &gt;&gt; I woke up this morning and my little toe hurt. I got a vitamin for it. I come home and my back hurt. I got three vitamins for it. &gt;&gt; Come home and my wife looked at me wrong. I got a vitamin for it. I was driving down the road and while I was driving my eyes went got a vitamin for it. I'm not preaching against vitamins. I take them. &gt;&gt; BUT A PROPHET OF GOD SAID IF YOU EVER GET THESE SPIRITUAL VITAMINS, YOU'LL ALWAYS FEEL GOOD. I JUST IDENTIFIED YOUR BAD MOOD PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; I JUST IDENTIFIED WHY SOMETIMES YOU COME TO CHURCH AND YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE world and sometimes you come in HERE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S ON TOP OF YOU. IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT BEEN TAKING YOUR VITAMINS. BUT IF YOU'LL GET BACK IN THE WORD OF GOD AND QUIT ACCEPTING THE HISS OF THE SERPENT AND START FEEDING ON THE VITAMINS OF THE WORD OF GOD, YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON SUNDAY AND YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON MONDAY. YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON TUESDAY AND YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON WEDNESDAY. YOU'LL FEEL GOOD ON Thursday and you'll FEEL LIKE GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE A PART OF THE PROPHETIC WORD. YOU ARE HERE TO contend for the faith. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring this down to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to bring this down right here. &gt;&gt; Contend. If you got a few minutes, &gt;&gt; an hour and three minutes. That's how long I've been preaching. Contend don't mean to exactly argue. &gt;&gt; Direct quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, Brother Bram said, contend means to debate. &gt;&gt; You know what, brother? Brother Matt, I found out something. There is a difference in arguing and debating. &gt;&gt; Some of you kids just woke up. What do you mean? Well, in college they have debate classes, right? &gt;&gt; They don't call them arguing sessions. &gt;&gt; I I'm that guy. Okay. Brother Tom, I had to know what's the difference in debating and arguing. I'm I'm not going to read the whole thing, J. I'm just going to read this one thing. A core distinction is distinction is intent and approach. Debate uses reason &gt;&gt; and facts &gt;&gt; for understanding &gt;&gt; or victory. &gt;&gt; Did I read THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHILE A COMMON ARGUMENT RELIES ON emotion &gt;&gt; and ego and OFTEN LEADS TO CONFLICT RATHER THAN RESOLUTION. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN HAVE LOGICAL ARGUMENTS WITHIN A DEBATE, BUT AN ARGUMENT ITSELF, IT OFTEN LACKS THE STRUCTURE. THAT A THAT A DEBATE CARRIES. NOW, I picked that up. You don't debate your parents. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; IN JUDE 1:9, JUST A FEW VERSES DOWN. Are you READY FOR THIS? YET MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL, &gt;&gt; WHEN CONTENDING WITH THE DEVIL, &gt;&gt; DISPUTED ABOUT THE BODY OF MOSES, DUR NOT BRING a railing accusation, BUT SAID, "THE LORD REBUKE YOU." REMEMBER SAID, "LOOK HERE." AMEN. NOW WATCH THIS. NOW I WANT TO BACK UP HERE AND PULL THIS OUT FOR just a second. This is not this is not brother Ram. This is Bible commentary, okay? It's not of authority. Take or leave it. It's just I thought it was good. Jude is warning THE FALSE CHURCH ABOUT FALSE TEACHERS. MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL is the chief angelic defender OF GOD'S PEOPLE. NOW WATCH THIS. DESPITE HIS AUTHORITY, MICHAEL DOES NOT RELY ON PERSONAL POWER or insults when confronting the devil. THE JEWISH TRADITION SUGGESTS THAT THIS INVOLVEMENT WAS PREVENTING AN MISUSE OR IDOLATRY OF MOSES BODY. SO THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY WERE AR THEY WERE TRYING TO ARGUE THAT YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WITH MOSES'S BODY. WHERE IS IT AT? NOW WATCH THIS. DUR NOT BRING A railing accusation. Michael did not insult. &gt;&gt; He did not MOCK SATAN. HE DID NOT CLAIM AUTHORITY IN HIMSELF. HE JUST SIMPLY SAID, "GLORY TO GOD. THE LORD WHO GLORY LORD REBUKE YOU." &gt;&gt; STANDING THERE GOING BACK AND FORTH, BROTHER BOBBY AND MICHAEL JUST SAID, "The Lord rebuke &gt;&gt; thee." &gt;&gt; I'M GOING SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS. WHY JUDE USES THIS EXAMPLE? IT CONTRASTS MICHAEL WITH FALSE TEACHERS WHO SPEAK ARROGANTLY ABOUT SPIRITUAL THINGS. &gt;&gt; THEY MOCK AUTHORITY AND ASSUME POWER GOD NEVER GAVE THEM. IF MICHAEL WOULD NOT SPEAK PRESUMPTUOUSLY AGAINST even Satan, HOW MUCH MORE SHOULD HUMANS BE CAREFUL? &gt;&gt; I love this. Are Are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; SPIRITUAL VICTORY IS NOT IN VOLUME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BRAVADO OR INSULTS, BUT IN ALIGNMENT WITH GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT VICTORIOUS ON HOW LOUD YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AND Y'ALL KNOW I'M LOUD. YOU'RE NOT VICTORIOUS ON HOW EMOTIONAL YOU ARE. YOU'RE VICTORIOUS ON HOW ALIGNED WITH GOD'S WORD YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE STANDING TOE-TO-TOE WITH THAT DEVIL. JUDE 1:9 TEACHES THAT TRUE SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY IS EXERCISED THROUGH HUMILITY AND SUBMISSION TO GOD. IT'S NOT ARROGANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are y'all ready for this? &gt;&gt; Even when confronting evil. &gt;&gt; Now, can I can I drop something to you? &gt;&gt; I took time this morning to listen to it. Very powerful. If you want it, I'll send it to you. TL Osborne gave his testimony. I shared it with some of the brothers. T Osburn gave his testimony when he watched Brother Random in a prayer line. You know what he said, Sister Lillian? He said, "I was a Pentecostal." He said, "I believe the louder you were, the better off you could be." &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe the quicker you could get the atmosphere all worked up and get loud and volume and noise." He said, "The more noisier, the better chance that devil was going to go." He said, "And here walked a little deaf and dumb girl, I believe it was, or blind girl, one of the two, walked before brother." And TL Osborne said, "I was up there, Brother Charles. She was up there in the balcony." And he said, "I was watching that." And he said, "I was a Pentecostal." He said, "I was ready to go." I I'm I'm out of time. I'm probably butchering this, but he said, "I was ready to go, brother Roy." He said, "I was ready to get up there and scream and let's get this devil out of there." He said, ' And before I could even get my head bowed, he said, ' And get it back up again, I heard brother Brandham say these words. Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I adjure thee by the power OF THE LIVING GOD, COME OUT OF THE GIRL, AND NEVER TORMENT her no more according to what was done THAT DAY AT CALVARY. He said, and he said, now raise your head, audience, the girl as well. HE SAID, "RIGHT THERE, I SAW, AMEN, WHAT A SON OF GOD DOES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD OF GOD." LISTEN, FOLKS, I I I DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ IT TO YOU, BUT I WANT TO SAY IT TO YOU. I DID SOME STUDYING LAST NIGHT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID THIS, "SATAN HASN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT. DON'T YOU ARGUE WITH HIM. DON'T YOU FUSS WITH HIM. YOU JUST IGNORE HIM AND WALK AWAY. IF YOU KEEP ON FUSSING WITH HIM, YOU'LL FUSS ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT." THE BIBLE SAID, "RESIST THE DEVIL." HALLELUJAH. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. COME ON, CHURCH. WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF DEBATE ARGUERS. WE'RE NOT A BUNCH OF FUSTERS AND FIGHTERS. WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE ARE CONTENDERS AND WE ARE HERE. &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU, I'M &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET GOD SAID? HE SAID, "GOD AND THE DEVIL GOT A DEBATE ONE TIME ABOUT JOB." You know that? HE SAID GOD AND SATAN HAD A DEBATE ABOUT JOB. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID, BROTHER MORGAN? JOB LOOKED AT THE LOOKED AT OR THE DEVIL LOOKED AT GOD AND SAID, "IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE HIM TO ME, I'LL MAKE HIM CURSE YOU TO YOUR FACE." YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "AND GOD TOLD SATAN, I'VE GOT A SERVANT IN THE EARTH. THERE'S NONE LIKE HIM. WHATEVER I SAY TO HIM, HE WILL DO IT. HE'S A PERFECT MAN AND A JUST MAN." AND SATAN SAID, "IF you'll just let me have him, I'LL TAKE HIM AND MAKE HIM CURSE YOU TO YOUR FACE." JOB NOT KNOWING ALL THESE THINGS WERE GOING ON, IT BROUGHT THE PATRIARCH INTO A DEEP DISTRESS. BROTHER JARED, YET SOMEHOW WHEN ALL WAS GONE FROM HIM, HE STILL MAINTAINED HIS POSITION IN CHRIST. OH, CARTER, I SAY, GOD, GIVE US SOME MORE JOBS. COME ON, FOLKS. WHEN THE DEVIL AND GOD GOT INTO A DEBATE ABOUT JOB, GOD DIDN'T GO TO THE LIBRARIES AND GET SOME BOOKS FOR MATERIAL AGAINST THE DEVIL. DO YOU KNOW THE MATERIAL THAT GOD USED AGAINST THE DEVIL AND HIS DEBATE ABOUT JOB WAS THE LIFE THAT JOB WAS LIVING? GLORY TO GOD. THE LIFE I'LL TEAR THAT WALL OUT TODAY FOR YOU. THE LIFE THAT JOB WAS LIVING WAS THE MATERIAL THAT GOD USED AGAINST THE DEVIL. COME ON, FOLKS. HE HIT SOME LOW SPOTS. HE HIT SOME PLACES WHERE HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SCREAMING. HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHOUTING. HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE DANCING. BUT IN THE FACE OF ALL OF IT, BROTHER JARED, HE STILL MAINTAINED HIS POSITION IN CHRIST BECAUSE HE WAS A CONTENDER. &gt;&gt; Can I show you this? Brother Bam never stood there and said, "Now Satan, I'm going to fuss with you." &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, he never stood there and said, "Come here. I want to argue with you a minute. He said, "Now, devil, I challenge you to a debate." &gt;&gt; Satan, you are aware you're whipped. &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, my Lord, stripped you of every authority you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness. And you're nothing but a bluff. And we're calling your bluff. And you know that when our Lord came on the tree, he cursed the tree. And the next day it was withering. And our Lord said to his disciples, "Have faith in God. For if you shall say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe what you've said will come to pass, you can have what YOU SAID." SATAN, YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURE ON THAT. And I I got to close my Bible. I'll keep ON PREACHING. AND I HAVE JUST TAUGHT THIS PEOPLE THAT GOD IS IN THEM. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? HE SAID, "WHAT IS THE FAITH?" HE SAID IT'S THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT WAS IN the apostles. I HAVE JUST TAUGHT THEM THAT GOD IS IN THEM AND IF GOD IS IN THEM AND THEY SPEAK TO THAT DISEASE AND SAY BE AWAY FROM ME AND DON'T DIE IN THEIR HEART RIGHT THEN THAT DISEASE HAS TO MOVE FOR IT'S NOT THEM THAT SPEAKS. IT'S THE FATHER IN THEM THAT SPEAKS. THEY'RE IN NEED. SO COME OUT OF THEM IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew? I challenge you to a debate. You don't have any legal power. Satan, you have no power over them. &gt;&gt; Y'all want something to shout on all week? &gt;&gt; Anybody? Two of you. &gt;&gt; You have no power over them. You didn't have it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stand on your feet and give GOD PRAISE. YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT in the first place. &gt;&gt; You was only bluffing them. &gt;&gt; You was only bluffing. &gt;&gt; But Christ stripped you of everything you had at Calvary. &gt;&gt; He stripped every power you ever had. And you're nothing but a bluff. And we called you a bluff. And they are the children of God &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Contending. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some are departing, &gt;&gt; giving heed to seducing spirits, &gt;&gt; giving up their revelation of who they are in the word. &gt;&gt; Backing up at every little issue that arises. &gt;&gt; Come on. Break that spirit right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Break it. &gt;&gt; Break that devil right now. &gt;&gt; He's hanging over, &gt;&gt; but just go ahead and break him right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Just go and say, "I'm going to stand with the word of God. I'm not going to be seduced &gt;&gt; not going to receive these things in my mind. My my spiritual womb is closed &gt;&gt; by the word of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I'm in a position that God gave me and I'm contending contending for the faith. Years ago, I was over in West Virginia and I was preaching there and Brother Matt Vest and I was rabbit hunting a lot and we got done rabbit hunting one day and he said you know he said I'm looking for a special gun. He said I'm looking for a 410 contender. I said ever heard of one of those. I He said yeah. He said it's a little it's a a 410 shotgun contender pistol. Some of you probably know what I'm talking about. Brother Phil, anybody know that contender? You know. And I said I've never seen one of those. I'd like to see one. He said well he said I I've been been wanting one. and he said, "Let's just stop here by the pawn shop." So, we pulled in at the pawn shop and went in there and the guy behind the counter, he said, "Can I help you?" And Matt said, "Well, I know you're a gun dealer. You're also a pawn shop owner here." He said, "Uh, have you have you got a contender, a 410 contender?" And the guy started laughing. He said, "That's funny." Kind of looked over. He said, "A contender is hard to find." I just kind of stood there for a second. He said, "They're hard to find." He said, "They're rare." He said, "They're really valuable." He said, "They're really sought after, but they're hard to find." He said, "But you know what? You can find one somewhere." Folks, Matt set out on a Brother Matt set out on a hunt to find one. And he found one. And I said, "You know what? I'm I'm Brother David. I'm I'm going to prove this guy up there in West Virginia. Don't know what he's talking about. So, I still live in Tennessee. So, I went down to my buddy's gun shop and I walked in. I said, "Hey, I'm looking for a contender." He said, "You can't find them. They're hard to find." I said, "Really?" He said, "Yeah." He told me the prices and value of them and everything. He said, "You can't find them." He said, "If you find one, you are a blessed man." Two days later, he called me. He said, "You ain't going to believe it." He said, "You know what? Somebody just come in here and traded one in." He said, "If you want it, you can come get it." He said, "They told me they were going on to better things, better guns." I said, "Hold that. I'm coming to get it." C Can I tell y'all something? A contender is hard to find &gt;&gt; for the faith. &gt;&gt; They're rare, &gt;&gt; but they're valuable. &gt;&gt; And no matter how rare they are, and no matter how hard they are to find, &gt;&gt; I found some today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I found some today. &gt;&gt; I found some real Christians that will contend with that devil &gt;&gt; and maintain their position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan, be careful. This is not that first Eve. &gt;&gt; This is a word for word formed bride. &gt;&gt; She knows who she is. She knows what she believes &gt;&gt; and she knows where she's standing. I wonder today how many say, "Lord, I want to get some of those vitamins." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be a contender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, don't ever let the serpent hiss over my life. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the serpent seduce me in what I believe and what my convictions are. May we bow our hearts this morning. Contenders are rare. They're hard to find, but they can be found. I wonder today how many say, "Lord, I don't want to be an arguer of this message. I want to be a contender for it. I don't want to be a fusser and a fighter of this word that's been given. I want to be a contender. I want to I want to debate that devil. I don't want to I I want to I want to exercise authority just like Michael did when he stood there toe-to-toe with the devil. He didn't scream at him and didn't get all emotionally worked up and falling apart and egotistic and arrogant, but he just stood there and said, "The Lord rebuke thee." I wonder today if there be somebody say, "Lord, that's the kind of courage I want. I want to be a job, Lord. Lord, I want to be that person that when the devil and you have a debate and the devil says, "Listen, there ain't nobody can live that message. There ain't nobody going to continue in the things that William Brandham taught. There ain't nobody going to stand for them kind of convictions. There ain't no young people on that earth that's going to stand for them kind of standards of holiness and modesty and clean living. There's nobody down there that'll do it. How many say, "Lord, I want to be your job. I want to be that one that you can point to and say, "But I've got a son here in Black Rock, Arkansas. I've got a daughter down there in Arkansas. I've got a I've got a young man there. I've got a young lady there. I've got a I've got a I've got a group of young people scattered all over the world standing for these convictions. I wonder today how many say, "Lord, let me be that one. I want to maintain my position." Now, if you're going to have victory, you got to stay aligned with God's word. Spiritual victory comes from alignment with the word of God. Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your presence today. Father, I believe I'm speaking privilegedly here today, speaking to contenders. Father, they're not departers. They've not given into seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. They've not been given over to reprobate minds concerning the faith, the truth. But Lord, they're just ordinary people, common people. But Lord, they found their place in scripture. They found their position in the word of life and they're standing on it. Now Lord, they've got many troubles and many of them are perplexed. They're at the crossroads. Don't know what to do. Don't know where to turn. Going through this situation, maybe facing this you, facing this problem, maybe maybe things that seem seem impossible, but Lord, they're contenders. So they're perplexed, but they're not in despair. They're not under enough pressure to renounce all their hope. Father, they're standing here today, some of them tired and weary in spirit, but Lord, they're contending now. Father, I pray today for a grace upon the lives of these contenders. Lord, maybe today by the preaching of your word, they could leave with a different outlook on who they are. Maybe they've just looked at themselves as human beings or church members or members of Grace Tabernacle. But Lord, may they leave here today and get in this word and realize, I'm a contender. I'm not an arguer. I'm not a fusser. I'm not a fighter, but I am a contender. and my life will challenge the devil to a debate and I'll stand there as a son and daughter of God and say, "Satan, you know the word." The Bible says this and the Bible says that and the prophet of God taught that and I stand upon it. Father, give us give us give us lives here today that are built on convictions. They're not built on the shifting sands of man's ideas. And they're not built on the on the mood and the atmosphere of a church, but they're built on wordbased convictions. Father, we're fixing to close out an old year and go into a new year. Lord, I pray, dear God. I pray, Lord, may we may we close out this old year as we take these last few days of this old year. And Lord, may we do inventory, Father. Lord, may we may we allow your word to to do our our yearly inventory, Father, where we're lacking, Lord. May you bring it to our attention, Lord, where we need to tighten up. May you bring it to our attention, Lord, where maybe the hiss of the serpent is coming in in our home or in our family or in our relationship or in the activities we're doing. And Lord, the hiss of the serpent is deteriorating our testimony and we not even got the courage to stand up against it. Father, may you give us that courage. Lord, we don't want to be just church members. We want to be contenders in the name of Jesus Christ. With every head bowed, every eye closed, I wonder right now, just you and the Lord, maybe you say, "Father, you just raise your hand. Say, Lord, come by my way. Lord, I know you're moving all over this building and I know you're dealing with hearts, but but come by my heart and do inventory right now. Check my heart. Check my life. Check my standing with you. Am I am I where I need to be? Am I strong in areas? Or am I getting weak? Am I getting relaxed? Am I am I am I am I allowing the hiss of the serpent to come in and to begin to hiss over my family? Oh God, give me that conviction. Lord, Lord, align my life with your word. I wonder today, how many young people here under the sound of my voice and under the opices of this word today can say, Lord, I want you to take my life and I want you to align my life with your word. I don't want you to take the word and align it with my life. I want you to take my life. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to argue with this devil no more. I don't want to fuss with this devil no more. I'm tired of arguing with that devil. You said, "But how do I argue with him?" Well, devil, I don't know. I just can't overcome. And I just can't give this up. And I go to church and I go to youth camp and I go to this convention and I go to this meet and I get real touched and I come right back. But if you if you'll move today from just being an arguer into becoming a contender and stand toe-to-toe with that devil on the on the foundation of the word of God, you'll overcome him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, just you and the Lord right now. You want to raise your hands before him? I believe it. Sing it, brother. Jesus is here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. the mat. Would you come? &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; You believe he's here this morning and I receive it. &gt;&gt; I lift my hands. Oh, I lift my hands to the heaven. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. I lift my hands toward the heaven. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. Healing is here. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it is this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, healing is here. How many believe that today? &gt;&gt; Healing is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, my Lord. Hallelujah. I receive it. &gt;&gt; What am I going to do? &gt;&gt; I said healing is here. &gt;&gt; Physical healing. &gt;&gt; Spiritual healing. &gt;&gt; Healing is here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Healing is here. Yes, my Lord, I believe it. So I lift my hands toward the heaven. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you. You're my rock, my healer. I trust in you. &gt;&gt; How many trust in him today? &gt;&gt; Oh, I lift my hands toward the heavens. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you, for I know Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; How many believe that today? &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; How many just raise your hands in his presence this morning? &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus is here. Yes, my Lord, I receive it. &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning, how many reach your hands to him right now is here. &gt;&gt; Just pull out of El Shadi right now that what you have need of &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; He's right here in this building this morning. Jesus is here. Yes, my Lord and I believe it. So I lift my hands toward the heaven. Lift my eyes where my help comes from. &gt;&gt; I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. Yes, I lift my hands for the heaven. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. Oh. Oh. Healing is here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Healing is here. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Healing is here. Yes, my Lord. I receive it. &gt;&gt; How many this morning say, Lord, I receive it. I wonder right now this morning, how many how many will just look at that devil right now in this in this Sunday morning worship service and &gt;&gt; you'll say, "Satan, I challenge you to a bait right now. &gt;&gt; I challenge you to a debate right now. You've told me I can't be healed." I challenge you right now to a debate. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53 said, "By his stripes, I'm healed." You said, "I can't be saved." I challenge you to a debate. The Holy Ghost is here. I'm an heir of salvation. &gt;&gt; See, I've done my part. &gt;&gt; I've preached the word. &gt;&gt; Now, you do your part and believe the word. &gt;&gt; And brother said, this time of the service right now, this little this little section after the word goes forth, he said, "Now, this is God's part of the service." &gt;&gt; He said, "This is when God comes in and begins to confirm things." &gt;&gt; How many can testify in atmospheres like this, you've experienced the transformation of God? See, right now is not the time to worry about what time it is or where you're going to go or what you're going. Right now is the time to let that word begin to find a place to root in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; So I lift my hands toward the heaven. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. So I lift my hands toward the heaven. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. Oh, healing is here. Healing is here. Healing is here. Yes, my Lord, I receive it. &gt;&gt; Oh, healing is here. &gt;&gt; Healing is here. Healing is here. Yes, my Lord is the pass. Oh gentle say you hear my humble cry. And while on others thou are calling. Do not pass me by. I'm crying. Saveior. Yes, Savior. Hear my humble cry. While on others thou are calling. Oh, do not pass me bow. I say pass me not oh gentle savior. Oh he my humble cry. And while on others thou art called thee, oh Lord. Oh, do not do not pass be. I'm crying. Take your Yes, my savior. Won't you hear my humble cry? Oh, and while on others thou are calling, won't you? Do not pass me by. I say while on others thou are calling me. Do not pass me by. Amen. You believe that this morning? Amen. While the spirit of the Lord is moving and dealing with our hearts, how many can say, "I'm a true contender." &gt;&gt; Amen. Contending for the faith. Amen. What a tremendous message to remind us who we are. Amen. You know, I we hear that word a lot. It's used the contender in many different v venues and different things. You know, I was thinking when brother Andrew was preaching that and you know, in the in the sports world, they say uh there's all kinds of teams, but the contenders are those that have a potential to win the prize. &gt;&gt; They say they're contenders. You know what it means, brother Jared? in a in the football world, a contender, it's one that had a good offensive line, that had the ability to push their way and push the enemy out of the way and had quarterback that had the presence of mind to be aware of the the pocket and all the dangers that were around them and wide receivers that could run. They had people in every position that had the ability to to do things greater than their enemy or their opponent. And that made him a real contender. In other words, to be a contender, it means it was one that had had the qualities that were necessary for victory. And I thought as he was preaching that, that's what a contender really is. It's those that have the qualities that are necessary for victory. For in the end there is a victor. &gt;&gt; In the end there's a victor. And you know what? Even those contenders when they talk about him a contender, they still lose games. They still lose battles. They have bad they have bad times. They have down times. They sometimes they feel defeated. Sometimes they had to have a a good coach come by just to pick them up to remind them who they are. I think that's what God done this morning. Come by to say, "You're a contender. &gt;&gt; You have the qualities. You possess the qualities that are necessary for victory. And in the end, there will be a victor. You're a true contender. It doesn't matter what you heard or or what you how down you got or how low you get, you're still a contender. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but that does something for my heart this morning for God to come by and remind you that you're a contender of the faith. We're not pretenders. We're contenders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a whole world of pretenders, but we ain't pretenders this morning. We're contenders. That's what the devil says you are. You're a pretender. How many looked the devil in the eye and say, "I'm not a pretender. &gt;&gt; I'm a contender." Say, "How do you know it?" Cuz the greatest analyst that there ever was. Said, "Look down in my heart and in my life and said, "They possess the qualities it takes for victory." &gt;&gt; There ain't nobody that could look at a life like God can. And he looked at your life and said, "You have the qualities that it takes." &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a contender this morning. Amen. You love the Lord. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful just to know who you are? We're not just wondering. &gt;&gt; We're not wondering. Said, "The devil wondered, but Jesus knew." &gt;&gt; We're not just wondering who we are. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate our brethren. That's just like sitting down and talking to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just reminding you who you are. Can we try that song? Just a little talk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. Just remember our service at Wednesday night having our uh end of the year service. Uh, Brother Andrew will be speaking for us and and if this was anything uh to do with the uh he said this was part one, that's part two. I can't wait to hear the I can't wait to hear the evangelist come out there on on Wednesday night. And uh Brother Matt McGary and his family are coming down and fellowship with us. I know we have several coming to be a part of the service. We're cooking a breakfast for everyone. We're not doing a watch night service. So the service will be at normal time at 7 o'clock. Um what that means is that we don't have intention of being at church until midnight. So that's not what our goal is. We but uh but we just we're going to come and just have church. So uh you know whatever happens happens. We don't ever put a limit on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just coming to have church Wednesday night. So how many's going to come and join us uh to bring in the new year? I can't think of a better place to be. When I was in the world, you know, everybody wanted to go down to the club or to the to the bar or to the party and all this stuff to bring in the new year. And then and most of the time them crazies didn't remember what it was like bringing in the new year. And I thought, you know what? That's where that's the way I want to be tomorrow or Wednesday night. I don't even want to remember what it was like when I brought in the new year. But it ain't because I'm drunk on the spirits of the world, but I want to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that I didn't even know what took place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think we may as well just come and have church and put the old year behind us and bring in a new year and go on and be a contender in 2026. Amen. You love the Lord. Let's just sing this together. Well, I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in. And then a little light from heaven filled my soul. Well, he b my heart in love and he wrote my name above.
