morning and sure appreciate all of you we just thank God to be able to come and gather in the house of God just a fellowship around the word and and we certainly appreciate everybody coming and we just appreciate the brothers just always there to help one another and brother Chris and and his family come this morning and uh they they've made this their home church and said the Lord and put that on his heart and so they drove several hours this morning to be in service U looking for a place to be able to to come down this way so we just want to welcome you brother and your family and just trust that the Lord will uh help you to grow and and that we would be able to do something to to help you and I know we have so many wonderful families here that the Lord has uh brought us together I don't believe he brings us together by accident uh but I believe that God has a purpose for us and I know what the Bible says where the carcass is there shall the Eagles be gathered together so we're not coming to together in a church but we come together around the word of God Amen so we ain't here to build a church not to build a Ministry uh but to take the the very message that we have and and and to preach it to the people and uh that maybe we could not just maybe but that we could grow in in faith brother Bobby till one day we just walk right out of this world so we welcome everyone and always seems like there's new uh folks that are coming and and uh so we just want to ask you to make yourself welcome and Worship the Lord according to the dictates of your heart and uh we don't we don't bind people you have Liberty if you feel like raising your hand raise your hand and if you feel like shouting you shout a little bit nobody's going to look at you funny if you sing off key uh it's okay there ain't nobody going to pick on you and and my if people put up with me don't worry they're going to put up with you so uh we just we just make sacrifices for one another and and uh but we just love the Lord how many love the Lord amen amen we just certainly appreciate what God is doing and and appreciate the the support that we get and I was just thinking about this last night and I was watching some videos and some Services of Brothers was texting uh pictures of other countries and and I'd put some things on there of India and got on my mind and and you know I remember sometimes you get over there after some long days and just feels like you've you've been home or gone for a month and and and just miserable but uh but the Lord moves and the services and that helps but when you're not in church it's just it's just uh It's just tough and and uh I remember sitting over there one morning and got a text and uh brother Tim Andrews sent me a text he said brother just want you to know I'm praying for you sure love you can't wait to hear what God does uh for you in the meetings you know may just seem like a simple thing but to think that we have brothers and sisters that support one another and it it just made me feel good that somebody's thinking about you and you know I think if you have somebody on your mind you ought to tell them you ought to say brother I love you God bless you and sister I love you and it just helps us to know that we that we have each other's back amen and so we just appreciate every one of you and appreciate what God's doing how many loves the Lord this morning amen and uh we uh we don't want to overlook nobody but we sure appreciate everybody for being here and uh we have several that are sick this morning I know many families uh there's a dozen or so families been affected by this sickness and U their sister Sarah their children are homesick and um also for Kelsey and family there is sick as well and um also want to remember uh sister Brooke uh she's H at the hospital having her uh new little baby girl this morning so I just pray the Lord would be with her and and they're getting a girl in their family so uh that'll that'll soften brother Connor up pretty good I think you know when you get a baby girl uh we also want to remember uh sister Sher Allan and and their family Stephen um their mom had passed away this week and so I know that's uh they've been battling cancer for quite some time just ask that the Lord uh would come for them and uh so we just know that God is certainly more than able to do that and if you have a need on your heart maybe just lift your hand to the Lord and and ask him to come how many just would just invite him to come would just you have something on your heart something you have need of and but we can just sincerely just ask the lord lord would you come by and would you speak to my heart and Lord just let all the the things of this world and life just fade away for a few minutes and let me find something in the word of God that would help me through this time would you do that this morning let's just pray together gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you and Lord we're so thankful Lord for another time to come and gather in this place and Lord just to have Fellowship around the word of God lord I ask you Lord that you would meet every need this morning Lord I pray that you would help us to get out of the way and Lord that you would come and minister to the saints of God here this morning and God you know what we have need of you know every heart every family Lord the situation the trials that we Face Lord and God but we just ask you Lord that you would have such a liberty here Lord God that we could get out of the way and allow you to speak to your children Lord we pray that you would move Among Us Lord and we'll give you the glory for all you do in Jesus name we pray amen amen how many say amen amen you how many Say Amen amen you know what amen means it means so bit so whatever the word says I say amen amen just allow God to have his way amen you love the Lord this morning we just also y'all remember our brothers that's ministering today brother Andrew is over in Poland and brother Joe was out in in the Carolina so just want to remember I think brother Joe born treer went with him so I just want to remember them this morning that the Lord would give them uh souls for their labor amen so we just want to invite you to the scripture we're going to read out of the uh the book of Galatians in the 3D chapter and we'll start in the 23rd verse and give you just a moment to uh uh to get to that place and uh we've been uh doing a series on this Galatians the third chapter and I've just really uh I I really enjoy uh digging into uh uh scripture and and getting below the surface and finding out what's really there there's always some good stuff whenever uh you dig a little bit and you know I've always remembered that story uh where that you know they they said the man had went and and and had a had a a gold mine out there that he had bought and he dug and dug and dug and and uh he had spent so much time and finally he just got tired of digging and just left it alone and and and he sold the mine for just pennies on the dollar just to get out of there and and and the the man that bought it they sat there for for several years and finally they thought you know what it was classified they had you know a little bit of gold there at one time and somebody went around in there digging and and three feet of digging they struck gold I thought my I don't want to be the guy that stops digging three feet from the gold amen so I just love to dig in the word of God and brother Mark find out what God has for us amen you love that this morning and just to find what God has in store so I want to read from Galatians the 3r chapter 23rd verse the Bible says but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified ified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school Master for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus and this morning I would like to speak on this thought on the faith children now this Falls in our series on the faith children you may you may have your seats This falls in our series of Galatians the third chapter last Sunday uh we were speaking on the hand of a mediator I hope that that you enjoyed it and how uh we were talking about the difference between between our mediator and the mediator that Israel had and you know uh how that Moses was the man that stood between Israel and God but whenever our mediator came of course it was Christ that Christ that Moses couldn't mediate for us but Christ could and brother Bobby he's the one that stood between he's the one that stood between us and uh and anything that would we would have a need of and so uh when Jesus would come he would even say these words he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me I've been shouting all week over that to think that he would he would he would present himself as the Christ and he was the anointed one he was God in flesh he was the he was the father that was in heaven he was the son that was on the earth he was the Holy Ghost that was sent uh to those in the upper room he was the he was the image of an invisible god brother Mark and he is our mediator he's the Stander in the Gap he's the one that stands between us in trouble he's the he's the same God that stood there when Moses got in trouble and remember how when he got trapped out at that Red Sea see and he began to cry out to God and ask God to help brother BR said it was Jesus that came on the scene he was the one that came and he come down and he hung in the form of the pillar of fire right between Moses and danger see because he's our goet he's our he's our stand between how many how many thanks God that we have a mediator this morning he that whenever we get in trouble we got somebody that we can call on that he can stand between you and trouble I I don't know about y'all but there's some things that I can't face and there's some things I don't have the answer to and there's some trials that are too big for me to overcome but I thank God that I have a God that can come on the scene right now today and he can stand between me and a trial brother B said he's our stand between he's our mediator he's the one that came down to Moses he brought Darkness to the Egyptians but he gave light unto Israel he said because he's our mediator he's the pillar of fire and he's that same Pillar of Fire today that is standing here he's our lord Jesus and he comes and he stands between you in sin he stands between you in sickness he come he stands between you and death brother Bobby he's our God he's our mediator he's our he's our stand between he's our go between and I thank God that we have somebody brother Mark whenever we Face judgment he stands between me and judgment to make brother the brother was posting brother Xavier posted on our on our our our brother's chat yesterday about how that there was a Jesus that would stand in our place and after all of our all of our all of our good things that we could present uh at judgment there ain't none of them that would be good enough but we would all be lost if it wasn't for Jesus that would stand in the Gap and you realize that it's always been that same Lord Jesus he said as long as I am in this world I am the light of the world he's the one that brought light to Israel and brother Brown said in every age it's always been the same it's always been the Lord Jesus you I I've got news for you this morning he's the light of the world if he was the light of the world then he's still the light of the world now and brother Mar I realize that this morning that every one of us have an opportunity that we can walk in darkness or we can walk in the light but in order to walk in darkness you have to reject the light that God has sent in this age and let me let me tell you like this this morning that there is a reward for walking in darkness and there's a reward for walking in light for those that choose to walk in darkness and those that choose to reject light you notice you go back through the Bible you'll find out that they always receive their reward in the days of Noah those that rejected the light in Noah's day they walked right into the Judgment of a flood in the days in the days of of Moses and Pharaoh they rejected the pillar of fire and what happened to the army of pharaoh they walked right into the Judgment of the Red Sea even even in in Dayan was was a man that followed after that light but there came a time that he rejected the light of God and the Bible say the Earth opened up and what happened to daythan and and those that would follow after him they walked right into the Judgment of the Earth but remember said it's always happened in all ages to those that fail to walk in the light of their day but I thank God that there's some Believers here this morning brother Bobby that we're not walking into judgment we're not walking because we haven't rejected the light of God therefore we're what we're not walking after Darkness but we're walking after the lie so we're not walking after judgment but brother Morgan we're walking like Enoch walk and one day we'll walk right out of this world into another dimension and walk right into the presence of almighty God I don't know about you but I don't want to walk in darkness but I want to walk in the light how many say walk in the light this morning I want to walk in the light you say he said see we're walking in the light of our day you say well what is the light of our day the prophet said it's Jesus all the time somebody say Jesus all the time it's Jesus that was in Noah's day it was in Jesus in Moses day it was Jesus in the days of of Dayan it was Jesus in the days of Abraham it was Jesus with Elijah it was Jesus with David it was Jesus with Solomon it's been Jesus all the time he said and it's still Jesus today for he is the word word and the word makes the light and it is the light of our day friends don't you ever get lost thinking that it's some new thing or there some new revelation or there's a new God or we're following after something new today that some man made up thing but it's the same Jesus that Paul said he's the same yesterday and today and forever it's been Jesus all along see but many fail to recognize him today because they don't know who he is they don't know how to find God remember how Paul whenever he met when he met Jesus on the road to Damascus here Paul the Bible says that when he met him he fell down and he said who art thou Lord you realize why why he would call him Lord because Paul was a devout Jew he was a man of the tribe of Benjamin he was a he was a a great Pharisee a studier of the laws of God and so when Paul met that great Pillar of Fire he immediately recognized the presence of the pillar of fire as the Lord and he called upon him he said Lord who art thou that I persecute he said it is I jesus but said notice he called him capital l r d in other words age or her for back in the days of Moses but brother Bobby he said Lord who art thou and he fell on his face before God he said it was Elohim that self-existing God oh my to think about it no wonder people can't recognize God he could be standing right here in your presence and you'd never know who he was because you don't know how to recognize God it's Elohim God comes in many forms he speaks to you in many forms don't you realize when Moses wrote about him he went to writing about God in the very beginning of the Bible and Moses wrote the name Elohim in in in in in the first chapter of the Bible he wrote Elohim 32 times he couldn't even write without writing the name Elohim there ain't even that many verses in Genesis the first chapter but there's more name Elohim than there are verses in the chapter because Moses Couldn't Write without speaking of Elohim he said it was Elohim that that created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning Elohim said let there be light eloh him said let there be a man that was made in my image it was eloh him that created you know you say well why would he use this word see there's a revelation behind this name Elohim remember we preached a a message on it but Elohim it was the self-existing one whenever Moses would call him this Elohim in other words it was when there was no air there was no light there was no stars or Earth or solar system nothing existed in the world but there was still God and when Moses wrote about God he used a word that could Define a self-existing God he didn't just say God see a God could be anything we can any man can build any image and make it a god a god is an object to worship so it couldn't just be God he was more than a God he was Elohim in other words he could exist when there was nothing to exist in other words this Elohim this God that we serve is a God that cannot be made by the hands of man he's a God that cannot be created he's a self-existing God he's the god that would come in many ways I I think it's wonderful to think about how how that he's not just a god brother Mark but but but but see anything could be but he was more than a God and notice this word it is so so hard for us to understand because our human Minds it's hard for us to think of a God that existed when there was nothing that existed you ever just sit and thought about it and just you mean you mean there wasn't nothing there any of y'all like me you know my mind goes way back and I think you know how there was no stars there was no Earth there was no there was no there was no nothing but still there was a God but how did the god get there you know but when did he come from there there had to be a time there he had to be made out of something he had to come from something but but because we're human and we and we have a beginning and because we see people born and see people die we see we see life and death and we see this cycle our our our mind brother Mark is always looking for where does something come from and and where is it going to go but when it comes to God God is an eternal God it's so far beyond our understanding this word Elohim but but but you realize that in this word lays the revelation of how you see Christ today without a revelation of the name Elohim you'd never be able to recognize Christ today because people would ask where is this Christ where is this bearded man that would walk they had sandals on they had long hair they had nail cars in his hands I I'm looking for Jesus you you remember the story of the little boy that he that that he went to his mom and and he said Mama I want to see God and she said well you know that may be a question for your pastor or or your Sunday school teacher when you get to Sunday school maybe ask them and she we went to Sunday school and he said you know I want to see God and the Sunday School well that's a that's above my pay grade but why don't you ask the pastor about it so he went went to the pastor and he said pastor I'd really like to see God and the Pastor said well you know it gave him a nice theological answer and you know you know God he don't appear before men you know like he used to and you know you know you we just we just read just read the word and you know but but but you can't see God like that so the boy left out of there disappointed and he went out and that week and finally Grandpa went and took him out on a fishing boat and he got out there fishing on the water brother Mark and you know he could tell something was bothered about him and he said what's matter with you he said you know I just had something been troubling me I I asked my mama I wanted to see God I asked my Sunday school teacher I asked the pastor i' really wanted to see God and none of them could show me God and that old man he sat there and he began to cry and tears flowed down his cheeks and he sat there and looked at the boy he said he said son he said for the last 50 years that's all I've ever seen is God he said when I look out every time I see a sunrise I see God every time I see a sunset I see God when I sit out here on this w I see God when I see the the animals that that come and drink out of this stream I see God everywhere I look I see God you me tell you what it takes brother Mark it takes somebody that's been through something to be able to identify God in this age it takes somebody that that that's been through some things oh I could just see him sitting there when I was lost I met him as a savior when I was sick I met him as a Healer whenever I needed help I met him as a mediator he he was God that came on the scene everywhere I look I see God oh don't you realize when I when I lost loved ones I met him as a comforter I can't go a day without seeing God see it was Elohim he was the god of many forms you realize that this word Elohim it's a plural word the Greek Scholars would take this word and make many gods a father and a son and a holy ghost because after all it's a plural God it's speaking of many gods but a prophet of God he'd say oh yeah it's a plural word but the plurality of it's not speaking of many gods it's speaking of the many attributes of the one God so he's a savior he's a Healer he's a restorer he's a deliverer he's a comforter he's a leader he's a guide brother Mark he's the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last he's a god of many names he's a god of many attributes he's a god of many natures and characteristics This Is Our God it's no wonder when Moses would see him in a pillar of fire he recognized him as God that's no wonder Paul seen him on the road to Damascus he recognized him as God because God is Elohim he comes in many forms you know why I think isn't it such a paradox of this I didn't I wasn't meaning to preach on eloh him but but but there such a paradox this morning this name for the Bible says I am the Lord thy God and I change not you ever notice that's what the Lord said Malachi 3 I'm the Lord thy God and I change not but every time he meets somebody he meets him in a different form I'm the Lord thy God I change not and he met Moses he was in a burning bush I'm the Lord thy God I Chang not but when he met Abraham he came in the form of mecdc and the Lord I th God and I changed not but when he met Gideon he came as an angel when he when he met when he met Joshua he was a captain of the host when he met John he was Jesus the Lamb of God when he met Paul he was a pillar of fire but I'm the Lord thy God and I change not see it's a paradox that people don't have the answer to but the answer is is that it's the same God and many attributes of one God that's why he can come to you as a comforter when you need comfort he can come to you as a Healer when you need healed he can come to you as a savior when you need salvation because he's Elohim he's a god of many forms a self-existing God he don't need Oh Glory he don't need nobody to build him up he don't need nobody to prop him up and to make him up that he can help you to overcome he's a self-existing god of many forms and he's still the same Christ of this age you think about when Moses wrote about him he had such a revelation of who he was he said in the beginning Elohim created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning Elohim made man in the beginning Elohim made the Earth Elohim planted the trees Elohim put the trees in the midst of the garden it was Elohim and when he came to a burning bush notice what the Bible says when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see this Burning Bush the Bible said Elohim spoke to him out of the burning bush see Moses had a revelation of who he was Elohim called and said Moses Moses he answered here am I that's who Paul met on the road it was fell him the self-existing God but Bobby no wonder no wonder that Paul could separate law From Grace because he met the same Pillar of Fire that gave the law to Moses is the same Pillar of Fire that met Paul on the road to Damascus no wonder he could look no wonder he could separate it clearly cuz he met the same Pillar of Fire that gave one the law and gave the other Grace I thought my isn't it something that that's the same one brother Mark that's here this morning in the form of the Holy Ghost it's Elohim all along it's the same it's the same God the same Jesus he he's the same Pillar of Fire he's the same one that I know the world don't believe it no more they look for a Jesus that's someday gone by or look for him for someone that would come they may say it's false but I say it's true they say he can't heal I say he still can they say he's dead I say he's alive they say he's far away I say he's ever present they won't accept him but I accept him as that this morning he's the Paul said that the promises of God by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe you know what those promises were they were the blessings of Abraham now how many believers do we have here this morning see we're Believers everybody in the building God bless you we're Believers so if you're Believers Paul said it would be given to them that believe the promises of God the blessings of Abraham would be given to them that believe oh yeah in other words so if you're a Believer guess what else you are you're a receiver of the blessings of Abraham that means because you're a receiver you can receive s or or joy in the place of Sorrow you can receive peace in the place of turmoil you can receive healing in the place of sickness you can receive love in the place of hatred you can receive you can receive happiness in the place of Mis misery because you are the Seed of Abraham because you're a Believer this is what Peter said he said you are a chosen generation I didn't I'm I'm getting to my message you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a pecul your people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light what is the light he said it's the revelation of a present God this is what God is calling us out I know what people are calling to I want to see the great mysteries of God I want to see the seals revealed see the the that light of God how many knows that in the Bible that light represents Revelation it's a an enlightening it's it was to reveal something it would take you know in the middle of a shadow in darkness but when light would shed on it now you can see what's there see so so light is revelation and people are looking for this great Revelation they look for for great they want to see the seals open I I want to see God in in the Supernatural I I want to see the hand of God so mighty I want to see Jesus right now but you realize that people fail to see Jesus you say well why why don't they see him be because there's an order to Revelation this is something that most people miss you realize that there are some things that you'll never see until you see something else first can I say it like this in other words before you can see Christ in this age then you have to first know the age that you're living in and what the scriptures uh uh prophesy pertaining to the age that you're living so you say I want to see Christ in my age well how can you see Christ today if you don't know what day you're living in how can you see Christ today if you don't even know what age it is because the Bible said he would come in many forms God would come in many forms in one age he would be the son of David and another age he would come as a son of man and another age he he he would come as the Lord Jesus walking on the earth off through the Bible he came in a different form this is that great Elohim but if he would come today the only way you would know that he was here today is you would know the age that you lived in see there's an order to Revelation this is why many people fail to see God see there's an order to it brother brother B said in the introduction to the church ages he said like like the the burst of a Roman Candle he said the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light then follows until the whole of the Revelation opens up wide before our wering eyes so brother Tom before you could ever see the Seven Seals before you could ever see the this great Thunders or or or the works of God you have to first recognize the age that you're living in so see that's why people fail to see the message they fail well I'm going to preach it anyway but but they fail to see God in the message of the hour because they've got their Revelation out of order said but before you can ever see God in that way you first must recognize the age that you live in so we come and find that this age or this church ages brother the mark it was to identify the age of the believer it shows us where we are that we're right in the midst of leysia and how Christ would appear in leysia what the condition of the church would be but let me tell you it would be an old lukewarm day that it'd be a place where the spirit of God couldn't move but I thank God that right in the middle of Le oia the Bible said but to him that overcometh I thank God we're sitting in a building this morning that's filled with Overcomers that right in the middle of that old lukewarm State there's somebody that can still raise their hand there's somebody that can still say amen and shout hallelujah and praise the Lord because we're because we're Overcomers we recognize the age that we're living in so see before before you can get these Revelations you have to first get the first one the age that we're living in how can you see Christ in this age if you don't even know what age it is so the first thing is to recognize the age we're in and then you can recognize Christ how he would come in this very age see so this is this is how Paul think about this is how Paul would introduce Christ he's showing the Galatians how to recognize him so he would he's showing them that the law would never allow you to do it here they wanted to recognize the Messiah you see it they wanted to recognize the Messiah they were longing to see a messiah there's a Christ that will come and he's going to to deliver us they're longing to see him but Paul is showing them that the law would never allow you to see it say see but before Faith came he said we were kept under the law we were shut up under the faith which should afterwards be revealed think of it first he speaks of the Mosaic Covenant how it required a mediator then he speaks of the abrahamic Covenant that that it was a promise to the believer and then he shows us that that promise now only comes by faith he said before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up under faith that would afterwards be revealed and so the promise he shows that it comes by faith in Jesus Christ and now in the 23rd verse he establishes that Faith can't come without a revelation see he said faith will come once it's revealed so here Paul is establishing that faith is a revelation somebody say that with me Faith is a revelation see brother said that's what faith is it's a revelation of God and the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body that includes every one of us that means you can't have faith without a revelation so here what God is doing he's bringing the revelation of the hour in order to give you the faith to be able to receive Christ as he would come in this age I I know many people well I want to have faith and I got I I want this kind of faith and a strong faith said but faith can only come by Revelation it you you you read it in the Bible in Hebrews 11th chapter the Bible talks about all these Great Men of faith and when it speaks of Abel it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified that he was righteous you you you realize that that that Abel by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice but said what is Faith he says faith is something that's revealed to you it is not yet but you believe it will be see faith is a revelation of the will of God so that means that you could kind say it like this so I I could say instead of by faith able offered a sacrifice but I could say this this morning by Revelation Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain because his faith couldn't come without a revelation so by Revelation he offered a more excellent Sacrifice by you m matter of fact friends anytime you see Faith you can put Revelation in its place so you say Anytime by faith you're healed you can say by Revelation I'm Healed because it took a revelation to have faith by Revelation that I'm saved by Revelation that I that I can come to God by Revelation I can believe that God is because the Revelation is what gave me the faith so he said it see it comes by Revelation and that's why Church today don't don't receive a move of God he said because today they don't believe in a spiritual Revelation they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system but I thank God we're not the churches of today brother Bobby we're not the churches of today but we're the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bride of Jesus Christ has the revelation of the message of her hour she recognized who she is she recognizes the age that she lives in and by that Revelation she's been given Faith to be able to receive the promises of Almighty God where the by Revelation think about it we offer God a more excellent Sacrifice by Revelation it was it was pleasing unto God our sacrifice been accepted by God oh by don't you realize that there's churches full of people I may as well preach anyway but but there's churches full of people that that that come in and they sit down they raise their hands they sing songs they got a loud drummer just like we do and they they they they go through all the Motions but but the the spirit of God never moves in the they when the song quits the people quit and it shuts down what's happened it's because they failed to have the revelation of this hour to be able to recognize Jesus Christ but I thank God we don't have to have some drums to get us all worked up I ain't got to have a piano to get me worked up I don't have to have some singing to get me worked up but there's something about the revelation of God's word that puts us a Zeal in my heart to want to be able to serve God why it's a revelation of the message of the hour he said they don't believe in spiritual Revelation it's just some dogmatic teaching of some system but that ain't who we are today but Mark we make that same sacrifice and God accepts it we make the same sacrifice and God receives it why because the the altar has been Sanctified in our hearts brother the Bobby it's a clean place to be able to offer worship unto God and he accepts and the Bible says which God testifies you are righteous a't that wondery how many how many how many would lift your hand this morning say I'm righteous most of us wouldn't you know why because we don't feel righteous Bobby can I read you something we're we're going to slow and read anyway so brother said it wasn't a righteous man is not a sinless man I don't feel righteous he said it was a righteous but a righteous man is not a sinless man a righteous man is one that confesses his sins to a holy God and he believes it by faith how many feel a little more righteous it's not a sinless man it don't mean that you have no sin and you don't make no mistakes or you don't have any false that's not what makes you righteous to be righteous it means that you'll confess your fault to a holy God and believe by faith that God is able to take your sin out of your life that's What Makes You righteous he said we're not righteous within ourselves we're righteous through Jesus Christ I could not oh can I just read it I manyan can I read it he said I could not even be Sanctified in my own self but I am Sanctified through Jesus Christ who stands in the presence of God in my place it isn't my Holiness it's his Holiness my Holiness won't work at all but his does because God has already accepted him and in accept AC in him he has accepted me because I'm in him oh that that's the that's what makes it real that we don't have to depend on oursel that makes me want to shout over this building that it ain't my Holiness it's his Holiness it ain't my righteousness it's his righteousness I couldn't even be Sanctified in myself but he Sanctified in my stead glory to God that's our god well I tore it all apart hallelujah it's our it ain't our righteousness it's God's War comes before judgment I hit that thing three times before I broke it it ain't our it ain't our Holiness it's his Holiness sorry brother Ben but we don't he said see but we don't sin willfully but every day can I read you this every day you're bound to sin my isn't that the truth he said every day you are bound to sin and you're bound to be backsliding constantly so it takes a constant prayer to God my I'm sure a prophet seen it the way I do every day you're bound to sin and your back's like now how many can lift your hand I think I might be righteous you know what cuz I fit all those category every day I'm bound to sin every day I seem like I'm backsliding constantly I have a con I have to take a constant prayer to God but Paul said every day I die daily said if Paul would have to die every day then what about you and I we'll never be good enough to serve God we'll never be good enough to be righteous we'll never be good enough to be holy but I thank God that I have one that is standing in my my place it's not my Holiness it's his you realize that Revelation it changes what you believe by Revelation it changes how you see things you see why we need a revelation by Revelation it causes you to have faith regardless of the outcome I I think I I get so tired of seeing people try to put God to the test I'm going to put God on to test I'm I'm gonna pray for this and if God don't do it then I ain't going to believe in God no more I'm going to pray for healing and if God don't heal I'm not going to believe in God I'm going to pray for this situation if they don't move just this way then I ain't going to believe God ain't on trial don't put God to the test if God will do this if God will do that why we're always stuck we're testing God who do we think we are to test an almighty God God ain't on trial it's our faith that's on trial this morning that God even whenever it happens I believe God when it don't happen the way I think it should I still believe God when it seems like everything went wrong I still believe God when I'm having a good day I believe God and a bad day I believe God I'm not putting God on trial he's not to be tested he don't have to be tested we're the one on trial said but God think about it the problem is is that people are searching for the wrong kind of Faith see they're looking to have faith in God which is which is a good thing but we don't just want to have faith in God I want the faith of God that's the faith that Abraham had that's the faith of God the very one that said let there be he didn't have nobody to have faith in but the faith of God said let there be and there was a light the faith of God said Let There Be A Man created in my IM there was a man in His image because that was the faith of God that's the kind of faith that we need this morning the faith of the Creator the faith of Elohim the the that said let there be and there was think about it the faith of almighty God the entire history of the law you think of this a thousand year old law Paul's writing about this and he types it with a child that was in school he said ' wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us under Christ that we might be justified by faith watch He's teaching the galatian church here all the works that they done would never bring justification although they made a great effort said but it would never bring just you'll never be good enough this is why people go for a little while serving God and then they then they they they get so backslid they can't go because they never can get over their s or their own mistakes for their own failures and and some legalist is sitting around there making them feel like a hypocrite coming to church because they have something that they're trying to overcome in their in in their life outside I'm going to say it like it is but but but but see Paul said but you the the law was a school Master to bring us under Christ that we might be justified by faith in other words that your Works ain't ever going to be good enough you're always going to struggle you're all the day you Rapture out of here the night before you're going to be asking God to help you overcome something we're never going to be perfect in this flesh you're going to be overcoming things all the time growing all the time until one day we come to that place of perfection that's why I don't just dismiss people when they struggle I don't kick people out when they're having a hard time when they when they get backslid you know why because I've been backslid you know the prophet said we go backslide every day said so we don't kick people to the curb we don't push them out say well they don't belong no more why look at them sit back and make fun of them raise up our nose like we're some self-righteous bunch of church members that ain't what we are we every one of us ain't nothing without the grace of God we wouldn't be able to make it another day without the grace of God we all sin by his grace and he alone School master in other words it was the one think about being a school master in other words it was the one that taught us right from wrongs this is what Paul's saying I think about children in school you think about when a child goes to school you know what they do in kindergarten getting a single file line they don't know why they're doing it they just do it because the teacher says stand by the wall single file line anybody been there I still remember kindergarten I I hated the tornado drills they made you come out there and they made you sit down okay everybody come the bell rang everybody come and put your hand over your head and sit down the hallway was that an earthquake or tornado one of them you had to sit on your desk one of them you sit in the hallway but but anyway brother Mark here they call they call us because it was a school Master now you know you think about this as a as a kindergarten student I never understood the gravity of what a tornado would do if it ever hit the school we never knew what it would really do can you imagine today as an adult and you look back on a thought like that it's a it's a it's a terrible thought to think of some uh disaster like that was striking but but as a child you never understand the gravity of a tornado drill was just something goofy that everybody went around and put their hand over their heads you didn't know why you were doing it you just followed the instruction and the teacher would do it that one day if something like that would happen it would be a place that you'd be able to be protected even even in your learning they never teach you they never tell you why you're learning what you're learning so the teacher comes in say says one plus one is what is two and you're like well that's good you go home mama so proud cuz you could do one plus one but you didn't know why you learn one plus one but someday you're going to be a adding uh adding systems of equations and you're going to need to learn addition and and things like that that it all maybe some of us did some of us didn't but but but but you you had to learn that in order to use it there but they can't tell a kindergartener what a system of equation is because they'd never understand it so they just give you what you need for that day so you're just following along you never have a real revelation of why you're doing it you think it's just good enough to get a pat on the back it's good enough to say you did a good job you got a piece of candy at the end of the day you got a star put by your name why because you was under the school master and the school master was leading us along listen what Paul said he said it was a school Master which was to bring us to Christ and he said listen he said and you were the school Master you were under can you imagine think of this here under a school master that everywhere you went the law was hanging over you this is a school Master it don't matter where you go you can go anywhere on the playground you can go anywhere you you could go out to the ditch by the where you wasn't supposed to be to get in the water anywhere you go the the it was hanging over you you had to you had to come back and you're going to you're going to meet the school Master no matter where you go what it's always hanging over you so here Paul is showing us that that it was there the whole time all the way through some thousand years that this law was hanging over the people of Israel everywhere they went they could never they could never uh uh be able to have this spirit of God they they could never really be free they they always had to go back and make this sacrifice and why because it was always hanging over them it pointed out where they were wrong it pointed out where they would make a mistake they go make another sacrifice to try to make it right but the law was always hanging over them I thought my isn't that the way it is today that me that that's why I I that's why there just something in my spirit that just that just gets so worked up when I think about somebody that would bind the people of God and put something over their head to keep them down and be able to keep them from being able to worship God and people can't even serve God freely cuz the men have made so many laws and put over them that men that that you have to live by and most of ain't even found in the Bible it's some man-made law that's been passed down from some great grandpa or something but they'll take something and that just becomes their law of their church and just to oppress the people of God and to make them stay under them and keep them under that great Brill of thumb and my how dare you ever say anything against it God will strike you dead or something see it's always hanging over them but listen bound no Liberty but notice what Paul was doing he wasn't saying that there was no need for a law he was actually showing the purpose of it he said the purpose of it the revelation of of its purpose it was to bring you to Jesus Christ see remember they were believing that they were justified by the law but Paul says the law was a school Master to bring you to Christ so it had a purpose its purpose was to bring us to Christ its purpose is it brought us to a true justification says so it brought us to this place but then Paul said but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school Master you know what that means it's graduation day oh my I don't I don't know about y'all but you know what it felt like whenever you came out from under that here they you may have had a mean principal I don't know if y'all have one or not but there was a couple of mean teachers that that that I went to school with and and you know of course I was a a good kid never done anything wrong and and so I don't know why they were mean but but but you know I'm just teasing but but but even if he was a nice kid there were just some mean teachers there it just seemed like they were always under you but you remember what it felt like when you said you didn't have to get up as 7:00 every morning and go down to that same old school house you remember what it felt like on graduation day and you threw the cap up in the air what was it it was symbolized in there's a liberty that I don't I don't I slept in noon the next day I I I'm not I'm not going back up there I'm not going back to to to to see what it's about I'm not going back to the lunchroom I ain't going back to the classroom what I was trying to get out of it brother Mar it was graduation day and this is what Paul said there comes to a place of graduation there comes to a place of Faith he said and when faith has come you're no longer under the school Master he brought us to this place of Faith he said and then and then we come oh I I don't know about y'all but maybe that just feels better to me that y'all must had great times in school I hated school I couldn't stand a minute of it I I I mean I I just couldn't stand it all through high school is the worst four years of my life and my and my parents made me go I couldn't stand going I didn't like it the it was slow the learning was slow it it just seemed like we repeated the same thing every day we never got anywhere and then they had take time to talk to the kids in the back of the room and they never could keep up and it it was just a miserable experience I done everything I could to not be in class I didn't like going to school I wanted I wanted to be out and that graduation day meant something to me cuz I didn't go back I it brought a liberty to my life anybody see it it brought a liberty to my life it was a graduation day you realize that we come to this place in our life that no longer was this hanging over you realize in this same period of time is when the Rich Young Ruler come to meet Jesus but tells the story of the Rich Young Ruler I love how he says it because he actually uses that word he said he was about the age of graduation he said here he come he was a rich man and he had been given all this he knew the laws of God he had kept the Commandments from his youth but when he came to Jesus there was a desire in his heart and he said Lord what must I do to have eternal life he said well do you keep the Commandments he said I've kept all these Commandments from my youth see he had lived under the school master all of his life but then there came the time of graduation day and he was here he was standing at a place that he could receive his cing gown and he was standing in the presence of Jesus Christ he said what must I do to have eternal life he said tell all that you have and give it to the poor and the man it was overwhelming what he had to do and brother Mark he couldn't he couldn't live that kind of Liberty he couldn't live that kind of Freedom you know what he did he went right back to the own the old laws to the old school master I thought my here he had an opportunity to be free just like Jesus gives every one of us today an opportunity to be free an opportunity to walk away from your past and walk away from the history that's been holding you down and binding you in the house of God and give you a liberty as a believer as a son and daughter of God that you can lift your hands again you can worship God again like you really feel like he can bring he can bring something back in your heart that used to be there the day when you gave your heart to the Lord It's a restoration it's graduation day people call out I want to be closer to God you think of it I want to be closer to God but they're not willing to change this is what he was this is where this man was I want to be closer to God but he wasn't willing to make a change I want to move into a supernatural realm but see see here's the problem is that people are looking for a dimensional change I want to move up I want to move into a higher power I want to move into this Supernatural realm I want I want to see the supernatural but they're looking for a dimensional change but you realize you can't have a a dimensional change without a dispensational shift remember we're talking about the age we live in so in order to have a to a change in Dimensions you have to shift in dispensations in other words this is what Jesus was telling him this is what Paul was telling the galatian church you're still living under this old law and you need to step into this new dispensation how many knows what a dispensation is it is a it is a divinely ordained order prevailing at a particular period in history so here here there had came a new order it was the dispensation of Jesus Christ they were living under the old order and here they were still trying to live by and Paul come down he said but you're living under the old order but God has brought a new order and you can't live under the old Order anymore because it'll never get you where you need to go but you got to step over you got to have a shift brother Mah into a new dispensation to where you can move up in Dimensions oh don't you realize there's been many today that's caught living under the wrong order they're caught living under that that that an old order they and they fail to receive the benefits of the current order don't you see what the man was offered here there was a new order that had its own benefits had its own freedom and Liberties it was the man Jesus Christ it had such a salvation but because he was living under an old order he couldn't even receive the benefits of the new but it takes a change said what do you do you move out of the old order into the new you move out of that old dispensation that that old mindset or that old that old teaching into into what Paul was saying there's there this is the dispensation of Jesus Christ and then you'll change into another dimension you remember the sanan woman when she came to Jesus here she came the Bible says when she came to him she worshiped him and said oh thou son of David have mercy on me you remember what the Bible said and he didn't even answer her a word he wouldn't even respond to her because it was the wrong order he wouldn't respond to her but then brother martin he says she changed her worship and she said Lord have mercy on me she fell down and she began to worship him and call him Lord not son of David anymore Lord what what did she do she took a dispensational shift she recognized that something had changed she said Lord have mercy on me Lord my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil lord I have need of you and you realize that even after she done it that Jesus still wouldn't accept her but but she got a response but it wasn't the response she wanted he rejected her he said it ain't me to give the children's bread to the dogs but you know what she done she said but even the dogs eat the crumbs off the master's table do you realize you ever find a True Believer you can't do anything to offend them let me tell you you can't run them off you can say the meanest thing you want to and they're not going to stop I I don't know about but I've been to India and there's Beggars by by the thousands that are standing on the streets and then one they'll come over there knocking on your window and trying to get money off of you you know why they they know you're an American and they know you got money because you come all the way there from the United States but let me tell you something it don't matter what you say to one of them Beggars you'll never get them away from your window without the car driving off brother John you could say well you don't deserve it and my you live you live a filthy life and what are you doing over here begging it wouldn't change nothing they'll still stand there with their hand now why because they need something something and because there's a need and they know you have the ability to give it then you can't do anything to offend them you can say get away from me oh but I but I have a need oh go somewhere else but I have a need I can't stand your kind but I have a need and you couldn't even offend them because they have a real need and they'll stand there until they get what they had need of but I'm Mar because because there's a real need there don't you realize when the need gets greater than our feelings when you realize that that the need for the move of God is greater than our feelings emotions or or how we feel about one another or what somebody said to us or what then then we then we take our feelings and we K them off our shoulders and realize what we really need is the presence of the Lord we need the presence of God we need a unity in the house of God where the spirit of God can come Among Us and minister to his children I have a need and it's greater than my feelings I have a need notice what she did she made a shift when she shifted all of a sudden it brought a new dimension but remember said it released a power my you think about it that shift just a shift of wording it released his anointing it released his power of healing she recognized him as Lord and she kept pressing brother Mar because she recognized him as there and she pressed on until and she pressed on until she was willing to do whatever it took he he called her a dog she said yeah I'm a dog you she wasn't a dog she was a woman but she said yeah I'm a dog it didn't matter what he called her she would have accepted it because she had a need she had moved herself under his headship as Lord and she had established him as the Lord over her life he wasn't a lord over Israel he was the Lord over me she said Lord and she worshiped him she made that shift and it brought about a dimensional change in her life it brought the supernatural it brought the power of God to her life that the Bible says whenever she went home she found her daughter laying in the bed and the devil had gone out of her thank you Lord why because she had shifted she stepped out of one order into another she took that that that Chang but B said this is what happened with the little woman that had an issue of blood remember when she heard about him she' come down regardless of what she said she said if I could only touch His Garment he said see and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release it released the power to heal her her genuine faith in God it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around he says what was wrong with her he said your faith is savior others are standing around they might have been sicker than was but she recognized his presence and she knew it was her opportunity there may have been some that was in worse shape there were in some that were in worse conditions they needed healing worse but she recognized his presence and she saw her opportunity he said if we could only do that tonight if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us oh don't you see it that's why Jesus is here brother marah is that he could release our desires to him if we could just recognize his presence and his appearing that he can release our desires that we have I don't know about you but that makes me want to shout out over this building if you could ever recognize the presence of God it would release the desire that you have the very thing that you need from God if you could recognize God you hearing me I'm not talking about tomorrow I'm talking about this morning if you could recognize God this morning and you could recognize him being present in this place it releases the desires that you have the very needs that you have that are given to you to you if you recognize him it releases our desires you said what do you do you've got to recognize his presence you said well how how do you recognize his presence here's what a prophet said he said when the promised word for this age is made manifest said then you can recognize his presence so when you see Malachi 4 promised and manifested you recognize it it releases a power in you Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also that's a promise of God when you see that promise manifested in the Believers it Rel is a power in you you realize where this faith is coming from you've seen Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also Greater Works than these shall you do you look out across the land and you see even in our own church and you see sick that are healed the the the blind eyes that are open uh people that get well that the people that have needs and God meets their needs what it build your faith because you see the word of God being manifested in your age you recognize the presence of God and it releases a power in you it releases healing it releases Deliverance it releases salvation it releases Grace brother Mark to be able to receive from God it releases because you recognize somebody say that releasing by recognizing that's what releases the power of God in your life is recognizing the present Jesus Christ you recognize him in one another we recognize him in the five-fold ministry we recognize him being present here this morning speaking to our hearts by the by the power of the Holy Ghost the Bible said it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart that's why God is dealing with you on a personal level when you come in the house of God how can he say all of this and deal with with 150 people differently but God can because he's a sovereign God he deals with us brother Markin it releases the power of God in our life you think about if you can ever shift into this place the right dispensation you realize the age that we're living in it'll bring you into another dimension see we're not under the old law but we're under the order we're not under the order of Moses but we're under the order of Jesus Christ the dispensation of Grace you said well I wonder if it belongs to me I'll just tell you what the Bible says Paul said in Ephesians 3 he said if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me he said not revealed and the it was not in other ages it was not made known but is now been revealed to His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel this is the dispensation of the grace of Jesus Christ Paul said it was time when it wasn't revealed but now it has been revealed that the Gentiles should be fellow AES that means that for you and I it's the time to be able to receive the grace of almighty God this is the time to receive Grace it's the time to recognize who you are oh listen what Paul said he said for you are the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ that's what makes us his children is the faith that we have in this hour he said we're we're in the dispensation of the grace of Jesus Christ and by faith brother Mark we receive it we're partakers of the promise of God he said we are the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ think of it the children of God can the music players come we're the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ here notice how Paul words this the children of God I love this word of see because the word of it expresses the relationship between one entity and another Paul says you're the children of God in other word of signifies your origin you're the children of God that means you're a part of something you're a piece of something now you you remember remember what Jesus told the Pharisees he said you're not of God you're of your father the devil see he was showing them their origin but here Paul says but you because of your faith you are the children of God in other words you come from God remember what the Bible said about Cain he said that Cain was of the wicked one that's the revelation that shows us that he didn't come from God Bible said he was of the wicked one it was showing his origin you say well I thought the Bible said he was he was of God that ain't what the Bible said well Eve said that somebody told me that one time Eve said he was of God but that ain't what Eve said eve said that whenever that Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived and bear a son Cain and Eve said I have gotten a man from the Lord see there's a difference of saying that he came from the Lord and he was of the Lord see of signifies origin but she said I got a man from the Lord you say well how could she say this well as any mother would that God is the creator of life and the Very creator of life that made the heavens and earth that made a man and woman that very that very life all life comes from God at one point it came by the power of the spoken word but because of the fall in the garden that life had to come uh through conception and so so all life always come from God it was a law the law that brings life was was put into Adam and Eve they had that law in their members they had the ability to sin the ability to fall they were free moral agents you you realize that they were they had the right to choose you you can prove that in the Bible they were free moral agents otherwise God wouldn't have gave them an order and a punishment if they didn't follow it see so God knew they were free moral agents because they gave them an order and said this is what happened if you don't follow it so they they had the right to choose but the the the the law of life was in them for the mark so they could bring forth life that's why you realized that the serpent he couldn't create life he was an upright beast but the Bible said he had a seed so life came from the law in their bodies it didn't come it wasn't of God it came it was from the Lord because all life is from the Lord but it wasn't of God oh my I can I can take this a little bit further you realize that when the Bible even writes to the generations of Adam that here the Bible said in Genesis the 5th chapter you can go home and read it but it said this is the book of the generations of Adam in other words this is those that that originated of Adam they this is their origin they come of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and he blessed them and he called their name Adam in the day when they were created and Adam lived 130 years and he begot a son in his own likeness after his image and he called his name Seth you see Seth he was an appointed seed of God and he came right through the lineage of Adam I I think about this that Seth was the son of Adam and here Adam was the son of God now in that son something Enos was the son of Seth who was the son of Adam who was the son of God Canan was the son of Enos who was the son of Seth who was the son of Adam who was the son of God mahel Hill was the son of Canan who was the son of Enos who was of Seth who was of Adam who was the son of God Jared was the son of Mah Hill who was the son of Canaan who was the son of Enos who was of Seth who was of Adam who was of God the Bible goes all the way through their Generations but I think how what a what a thought it is to think this morning that here Seth could go around the own Bible the he he could go around and and and and and know out of the scripture that that that it was such a privilege to be listed in the generations of Adam how good it must have felt to be identified with God for the Bible says that Adam was of God and Seth was after the likeness in the image of Adam can you imagine if that was your testimony this morning can you imagine if you walked around reading this scripture and Ed it you read it and it said Adam was of God but Noah he was of Adam who was of God now wouldn't that be quite a read if every time you read that scripture but B you'd find your name in there you could go around bragging like Seth could you could say I I don't know if y'all know who my daddy is my daddy's the one that God created he formed him out of the Dust of the ground I don't know if y'all met my daddy Adam but but he was you know he he was out he didn't even exist and God formed a body Out of the Dust of the ground and out of the mouth of God he breathed his own life into my father and I come out of him what a testimony that Seth had I thought my wouldn't it be Wonder wonderful if we could go around and say how wonderful it is my daddy was made by the hands of God my father he was the one that was created by God can you imagine if you had that testimony to be able to say it Adam was made in the likeness in the image of God but I was made after the likeness in the image of Adam same likeness in the image of God you can go to Luke the third chapter you can find the whole entire lineage from Joseph all the way back to Adam and back to God the Bible tells every name from the time of Joseph all the way back firstborn sons all the way back to God I thought my and even today there's people that can take their ancestry and they can go all the way back to Joseph and so they can say right now from where I am I'm of this one that's of this one that's of this one that's of this one that's of this one that's of Joseph that's of this one that's of this one that's of this one some 50 Generations later that's of mahalah Hill that's of Canan that's of Enos that's of Seth that's of Adam that came of God and they could track it all the way back that my generation's come from God but friends I've got news for you this morning you don't have to go to Luke the third chapter to find your ancestry to trace it back to God but we can read about it in first John the thir chapter John said behold what manner of love that the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God when we don't deserve it he said but what love he bestowed upon us that we're the sons of God when I'm a failure he said but what love that you can be called a son and a daughter of God when I don't deserve it when I when I fall by the wayside when I ain't good enough he said but what manner of love he's bestowed upon you that you can be called The Son of God oh don't you realize that church you have a greater testimony than Enos you have a greater testimony than Canaan a greater testimony than Seth for Seth says that was my father was the man that God created but friends I've got news for you I can go all the way back and I can say but my father is the god that created man he ain't just a man that God made but he's the god that made man and I'm his son I'm his daughter he created me in his own image and by his own love he has bestowed upon me the right to be a Son of God the right to be a daughter of God I'm a Child of God Paul said by faith I was born by faith the Revelation that Paul is bringing to the church is that you're a child of God by faith and Jesus Christ oh if you could hear me not by your own works not by your own efforts never can you do enough to deserve it you'll never deserve it friend you can't work your way into it but if you could stop for just a moment won't you stand to your feet if you could stop for just a moment and you can say it's not by My Sacrifice but it's his sacrifice is't that wonderful friend if you could ever get a revelation of that you're talking about Liberty as a believer that it ain't you mean he ain't looking at me he ain't looking at me he's looking at his own sacrifice that he made that's already been accepted in the face of our failures he ain't looking at me ain't that a wonderful thought this morning we don't deserve him but he made us but Mark in his own image we've been created it don't matter what you ever go through or what you I know what the devil's devil Works overtime to destroy your life the Bible said for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil that means you have power over the Devil by by faith you're a child of God you're over Overcomers and Jesus said he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son I'll be his God he shall be my son because he's an overcomer you say well well maybe one of these days I'll be a Son of God maybe I'll be an overcomer and then I'll be a Son of God when I get over there but listen what the Bible said he said but beloved now are we the sons of God not something that we're waiting on I don't know about y'all but that makes I'm a Son of God I wonder how many lift your hand in the air and say I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God right now I'm a Son of God not by my worthiness not when I get good enough right now I'm a Son of God by his own love he's best what love it is he has bestowed upon me to call you his son my isn't it wonderful we look at our old Earthly mess we look at this people bind people such a way I had a brother call me the other day ask me people know some church trying to bind him up and he he had just come out of this community and he said you know I've had this over me my whole life that I honor my father and mother said so I couldn't ever I had to follow whatever they believe no matter what I said well that what if your mama was an alcoholic I believe you ought to honor your father and mother as a child they're come you ought to honor them as an adult all the days of your life you are to honor them but that don't mean if your father and your mother's in the wrong that you follow them in the wrong that don't mean if they're in sin here here's an adult in a family but but but you got to follow him into sin say see but who is your real father it's God even the Bible said your children are not even your own they're mine they were given to you just to raise and if you love them more than you love me you'll have no part with me they're temporary for you to have they're God's children they don't belong to us you're children aren't your children well I gave them my name they're mine I know how we get we get possessive but they aren't yours they're Gods God will do with them as he pleases they're his we're God's children you're a child of God you're a Son of God by faith in Jesus Christ amen isn't that wonderful want somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me and all my days I've been held in your hands from the

brother Donnie Reagan will be here speaking for us on Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday so this Wednesday night any of the brothers that would come and could come and help um we're going to take all of these old pews out and bring our new pews in the church um so I think some are coming this afternoon at 3:00 after dinner to help uh move those in and bring them together uh so Wednesday night uh the brothers that can come that maybe don't care to driveing the snow and they can come and help us we'll do that so we won't be having service Wednesday night uh so just be uh uh just you be ready

just anybody that could help we would appreciate the help this afternoon 3:00 appreciate the help and y'all be praying about how many's looking forward to our our meetings coming up and now we've got we're trying to make the room we're making an overflow in here with a with a screen and the door open where uh brother Morgan's kind of got a plan for that uh we hope we'll have a little bit more seating the way we'll uh put the pews in and uh we we wasn't able uh but I know it's our desire um to to expand the church you know and we've been working on the sides and uh we haven't really got a pencil together yet as or put together a price of what it'll actually cost but um just be praying about it it's been on our heart to take the uh the side walls of this building out uh and add it'll add about 30 fet this way and it'll add about 54 ft this way so we'll be able to add a 100 seats uh I know during this sickness you may not those that are visiting you may Wonder but uh those that are here frequently there's some days you can't you can't get in here and so um but we want to make room and we want to make everybody comfortable we're also uh working on the parking lot uh adding to the parking lot that is our plan to have that done before the meeting so we'll have the parking lot expanded to add about 20 new spots out there and uh I talk to the guy that owned the land next door and he okayed it for us to take up some of the land there and make extra parking lot out of it so um we want to we want to we be working on that the after the snow so that that'll be done before the meeting uh and the pews that we just paid to get done um would be enough pews that once we expand the church we actually have enough of them that we can that they'll fit in the whole area so uh we just want to we just want to make room for everybody and you know uh brother brother Ben I I I didn't uh don't mean to put you on the spot but uh just to keep from embarrassing everybody turn around and look at brother Ben right there with the glasses in the suit nice looking fell there but U brother Ben King they they've just moved here and they made this their home Church they they moved over to pocah so they live here now so I want y'all to welcome brother Ben and his wife and family and we got brother ammer the other day when he was uh dedicating their babies so uh but we sure we sure appreciate the the confidence that people would have in us to be able to come and and bring their families here and Worship the Lord with us and you know friends one of these days we're going to be done with this we're going to work together and we'll work about you know the song it says we'll work till Jesus comes and that's what we're going to do we're going to keep winning Souls keep reaching out that's how this church was founded you know I I got a little nostalgic the other day and I listened to the first service that was ever preached in this building have a little recording of it and and to hear the the the Zeal on our hearts and everybody that prayed and just some just want to see God do something and a move of God in this area and so is to be one and I thought my in that very thing what's taking place some I I I don't have the count but somebody told me the other day there was there was nearly 60 people that we baptized in this little assembly in a town uh the town of Black Rock has we're we're about I think six or 600 or so people in this city and we're in the suburbs we're not even in the city we're in the suburbs of Black Rock but and people would drive down that old dirt road and in the but but we come here because we want to be in the presence of God and we came here when there was there was no pews in here these walls weren't in here it was just an old empty shell and and and people sitting here without any heat and without any air conditioning and they burned up and froze but didn't care they just wanted to be in the presence of God and souls were one and and that's what we want to continue to do and you know every now and then it's a good reminder just to go back to what we really are we're not trying to be something we're not trying to be a somebody we're not trying to create this great image or a church or build something like that we have one purpose and that's to build the kingdom of God we're not to build a Ministry of a man but we're build the kingdom of God and to win souls to the kingdom that's my purpose that's my heart and as long as I'm here that is that that's what we're going to do so I appreciate the the Zeal that you have to support that kind of a work and let's just go on till Jesus comes and how many's been praying for the meetings man you're looking forward to it and I'll tell you what do bring some friends and and come early on the meetings because I know the seating will be will be tough and we're going to try to add all we can but be here early and get get a seat and uh get parking and uh just be praying about it spend this next couple of weeks so we just appreciate y'all and God bless you we'll see you on next Sunday and with us moving those pews if you guys can take all your belongings your blankets your books whatever it is take it out because if it's there this afternoon when we come we're going to put it in the back and it's going to be piled up so you're going to have to dig through it amen aren't you thankful you're in this church you know I sent a quote out this morning to the brothers the church is not the building but it's the people and he kept saying that this morning you know it's nothing we done to deserve it but it's by by his grace that he's given us to be in this church anden as we go let's sing this song I'm in this church well I'm in this church this glorious
