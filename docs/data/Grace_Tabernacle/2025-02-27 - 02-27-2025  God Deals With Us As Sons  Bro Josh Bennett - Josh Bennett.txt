Amen I I tell you I believe there's there's uh two debts that we owe it's really the only two debts we should owe and one is to give God all the glory and the other one is to love one another I manyan know that the Bible says that that's a debt we owe and we should owe no man any other debt than the than the debt that we have to love one another amen and we and we definitely owe it to God Amen to

real small to to be among you but uh we just counted a great honor to be here tonight and may we just bow our hearts together and look to the Lord and if you got a need just want to make it known to him by an uplifted hand let's just let's just speak to him now Lord Jesus Lord we just thank you God for this opportunity that you've given us to come together Lord and worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and at the beginning of these meetings Lord we just want to we want to dedicate ourselves Lord we just want to enter in God and Lord we want to make a place for you Lord we want you to come and Lord we want you to be welcomed and Lord we just don't want to uh you to come and be a an onlooker as the prophet said or recording Angel but God we're inviting you to come into this meeting and Lord we want you to take an active part Lord we want you to do the speaking and Lord we want to do the receiving Lord Jesus we want you to have preeminence Among Us Lord we just pray that you would be Lord lifted up and Lord I I pray God like as you taught us to pray thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven granted Lord I pray that your will would be done done in these meetings and Lord we know that your word can never return to you void but it will have to accomplish the thing that you sent it to do so Lord we just pray Lord that you would just anoint lips of clay now and anoint ears to hear and anoint our hearts to receive and Lord we'll be careful to give you all the glory and the honor in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight if you just take your Bibles we'll get right into the word and uh we just want to invite you to turn with us to the book of Hebrews in the 12th chapter of Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 and I'd like to uh just read from the fifth verse and the scripture says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which have which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verely for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rest rather be healed and follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled may God just add the blessing to the reading of the word as you're seated tonight I want to just speak to you tonight by God's help on God deals with us as Sons God deals with us as sons and I I believe it's a powerful Revelation when you begin to understand that we are the children of God and uh and when we say that we're the Sons and Daughters of God we're we're we're literally saying that we are God's Offspring in other words God we are something that came from God and so you know I I would just say it like this if God has children then they're going to be like him because you know when a man reproduces himself whatever is coming from him is something that's like him and so you know as we as I I thought about this you know the the scripture says I believe Paul writing here in the book of Hebrews he said him you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children and then he says my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth amen and and we know that the Bible says over in the Book of Revelations as many as I love I rebuke and chasen and and the prophet said in the church a book he said to rebuke is to reprove and to reprove is to expose with a view to correction see chasen chastening does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind I tell you I I I believe believe that so important for us to realize that God is Not punishing us amen but he is chasing he's he's chastising us sure but he's not punishing us amen but God is trying to bring us to Perfection is that right and then Paul would go on to say if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons amen as with sons now amen the Bible says over in the book of First John chapter 3 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not and then I love this word this verse beloved now we are the sons of God ain't that beautiful listen the Bible don't say we're going to be the sons of God one day but now we are the sons of God well I tell you what friends when you begin to realize you always was a Son of God Amen you was never made a Son of God you just come to a realiz realization of who you always was amen we were always Sons amen and so he says we are now the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now amen as you think about that God deals with us as Sons or as his offspring Amen in other words you are a gene of God in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen you know just like brother Brown would say just like you were in your Earthly father you are also in God Amen you are in the mind of God Amen which is the loins of God because God don't reproduce himself like a man but God reproduces himself by Spoken Word and how many knows that a word is a thought expressed so then the prophet comes along and says that we were in the mind of God as a thought of God but for the foundation world I tell you that's beautiful tonight because before you ever made your first mistake amen you were a Son of God and God already knew you amen and he fornew you is that right how many knows that forn knowledge is knowledge beforehand in other words amen God knew you before you even knew yourself and before you ever got here God already knew you were coming I want to tell you God has children but God don't have no surprises amen some of us amen might have had a few surprises but God ain't he listen he don't have no surprises amen he's got a pre-planned family amen and all his children started out in his mind amen as a thought is that right amen I tell you what but just like you were in your father's seat and your natural father yet he could have no fellowship with you until you were birthed amen neither could God have fellowship with you until you were born again and although we were always Sons we had to be born again by the spirit of God Amen so that we could have fellowship with God amen amen as a Son of God Amen do you believe that tonight and that's why the Bible says God deals with us as Sons Amen in other words God is dealing with us as his offspring amen how many knows that God Amen desired to have a family now brother Brown was say in the church book he said here in is set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons but don't miss this part he says Sons like himself so God didn't just want children but he wanted children like him he wanted Sons like himself now and in in in the adoption series brother Brown we talk about how that God was uh uh just the great Elohim and he was a self-existing one amen and he was known as Elohim amen the alls sufficient all powerful selfish existing God he said but then in Genesis 2 amen he made a man and he said I'm Jehovah amen and what did it mean I am all existing one who has created something off of myself he said to be a son of mine or an amateur little one of mine he said oh he gave man see Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateure God so he isn't self existing anymore now he exists with his family hallelujah amen God existing with his family and God created man to be to to have predominant over all the Earth he had a dominion and Earth was man's Dominion is that the scripture amen then he was a god of the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so amen listen for amen why because he amen was a Son of God or an offspring of God is that right he said there you are it was God now existing with his family his little ones with him I love that amen now remember God is dealing with us as Sons or as his children as his offspring brother Brown would say in the church age book he would give an example of how that God in every age would always praise the church chur or the elect of that age and he would he would uh you know brother Brown would give the example in the Ephesian age how that God would say I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canest or can't bear those which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and or not and found them liars and has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted and brother Brown would take that and the in the church AG book and and show how he said how beautifully the the Savior praises and commends his children see he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there's weakness among them but as of yet he does not cry out against it he said isn't that just like our Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the right ma matters and discourage Us in the wrong is that right we could all learn a good lesson right here in running our church and our families and better still we could learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us exactly this way see don't ever be discouraged saint of God for God is not ungracious to forget your labors of Love ain't that beautiful that before God ever rebuke them he first commended them amen and the prophet of God said see why amen why would God do that amen because God is dealing with you as his children he's dealing with you as his sons amen but as many as the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth and then he says as many as I love I rebuke now you got to catch this because amen you know I know we live in a generation of uh of what they call gentle parenting and you know and and people don't believe in correcting their children no more and all that kind of stuff and that just seems to be oldfashioned amen but the prophet of God said we need some of them Old Kentucky mamies around again amen that that that remembers amen that they got a responsibility and look amen because amen people have it in their mind that less correction means more freedom anden that there if there's no chastisement then you got more Liberty but I want to tell you it ain't nothing but a lie amen because I tell you amen what is going to produce is is a bunch of jellyfish amen generation with no backbone entitled thinking everybody owes them something they'll never be able to stand the pressure can you say amen and God don't want his family like that as a matter of fact God is looking for a bride to rule and reign with him in a millennium and then throughout all eternity and God knows if I'm going to have a people or a family or a bride that's going to share my power she's also going to have to have my character and the only way she can get my character is she's got to share my suffering and there's going to have to be correction and chastisement she's going to have to stand rebuke is that right as many as I love I rebuke and Chason is that right now the prophet said in the church a book The emphasis in the Greek is upon the personal Pro of I he does not say as many as would feel he should say as many as love me he said as many as I love see we we we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this verse no amen it is the many that are loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours brother BR would go on to say he said listen we can't say that God you know is just a he loved the whole of humanity and then he's waiting on on on men to fall in love with him so that he can express his love to them and he said that's not how it is at all he's already declared his love and the problem said his love is elective love ain't got nothing to do with human marit at all God Don't Love You CZ you deserved it God loves you because he saw amen through predestination and election amen he saw something in you that you can't even see in yourself Hallelujah I'm glad tonight it's not my loving question it's God's love that he's declared to me I remember years ago I heard brother per green say this he said and I I've bared it many times he said listen there ain't nothing you can do to make God love you anymore and there ain't nothing you can do to make God love you any less you say well brother what's this all about I tell you amen listen God there's nothing you can do to make God love you anymore or any less but I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again listen friends amen God couldn't love me no more than he did at the beginning but I love him more now than I ever did Hallelujah and the more God reveals himself to me and and Reveals His grace in my life I keep falling in love with him amen but his love is elective love amen and he declared it in the Book of Romans he said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and the Bible is is is very specific in saying that before either one of them boys done anything good or bad God had already declared his love for one and and he already said that he hated the other is that right that the purpose of election might stand amen the prophet is using these scriptures to prove to us that God's love is elective love and and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke man now now remember this this rebuke is to to reprove it's it's to expose with a view to correction now the prophet would then read the verses that we read as a text tonight and then he said heing is set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself see and there before him lies all mankind and one lump of clay and out of that same lump he will now make vessels under honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to be conformed Into His Image in their walk see he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands and sometimes a Potter must take the vessel that he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it it's exactly or that he may rebuild it exactly like he desires but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be now you know God's love has been misunderstood many times because like we like Israel a lot of times we think love means no suffering well if God loves us then we shouldn't suffer you know Israel had the same question there in the Book of Malachi they they said the the the Bible says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you say the Lord yet we say where inest thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau and I laid his mountain in his Heritage Wass for the dragons of in of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love and the proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love is proven truly by the fact that we are chosen under salvation because God had chosen you to Salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and a belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that's his prerogative he's Sovereign but it's all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose and he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace but his purpose is that after we have suffered a while amen we would be made perfect and established strengthened and settled amen and job said he put strength in US you see himself suffered he himself suffered speaking of Jesus and learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered is that the Bible though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect he become the author of Eternal salvation of them that that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was per perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left the church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would be would come to a place of perfection see God deals with us as Sons now God never corrects us to punish or and God ain't trying to make you pay for your sins that's listen friends if God if God was going to make us pay for our sins then it then Calvary was in vain see God ain't trying to make us pay for our sins amen he's bringing us he's correcting us sure chasing us absolutely but God is Not punishing us or trying to make us pay listen friends that's why we don't believe in no purgatory and all that kind of Catholic nonsense they don't realize but that Doctrine is nothing but diminishing the power of the blood of Jesus Christ and the price he paid on Calvary come on church I tell you what that might be their revelation of their sacrifice but I got a greater revelation of My Sacrifice there's a reason why I ain't got to suffer for my sin it's because he bore my grief he he bore my pain Hallelujah the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes I'm Healed tonight do you believe that so you see but I'm telling you amen what what what if if God helped me tonight I'm just going to tear amen the ground right out from under the devil because every time you go through a trial the devil's right there to say you deserve this you've done something wrong and that's why you're going through this and God is punishing you and eventually he's going to turn the things so amen that he's going to say if you was really a child of God you wouldn't be suffering like this or if you was really bride you wouldn't be going through this but I can take the scripture tonight and prove to you on the on the contrary hallelujah amen I love the message of the eye thank God for a prophet cuz he can read the book of Job and he could say job wasn't going through that cuz he was a secret sinner Joe was going through that because God had confidence Hallelujah God was going to prove to the devil that I got a man on the earth I don't care what you do to him you can put him through the pr and he'll come out praising me you can take away everything he's got and he's still going to praise me anyhow hallelujah amen and and there's one thing joob never lost he never lost his Integrity is that right because God deals with you as sons and God wants Sons like him so God is putting a character in you that can only there's only one way you get it I'm just going to tell you we want trials that ain't Trials come on friends we we want trials but we don't want trial we want trials with that really ain't trials amen you understand what I mean amen but God Amen wants to put something in you a character listen friends God ain't just want sons he wants adopted Sons God's looking for adopted Sons amen God that's why amen he's taking you through the training process amen he's bringing you to a place amen amen that you can stand as a Son of God Bible says for as many as led are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again uh uh to fear but have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then hirs Heirs of God and join HS with Christ it so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us hallelujah for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen how many knows that that that the whole earth is trembling and travailing even now amen what is it for amen longing for the manifestation of the sons of God the prophet said go right back to Genesis to the original what is it the world in nature is groaning in ing everything I is moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now that's 1960 friends I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir when we'll say this mountain let it be so brother I desire so so and so a certain thing to be done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning out you H I ain't got no rain I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord God and bless your cross oh waiting and groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man a domain friends that's God's desire to have a family of sons like him listen friends that's why because that's what the prophet is showing you everything as God Is chastening Us sometimes Hey listen I know I've been whipped by God and I know any of y'all I know some of you been serving God a long time and and we know what it's like amen we've been we we've been through those times amen but you know what when you come out on the other side you always have the testimony I'm better now than I ever have been it only brought me closer to him it was all for my good amen God Amen had had your amendment in mind God was bringing you to Perfection it was all with a purpose though no chastening seems to be joyful in the present see as Paul would say for the present it seems to be be Grievous but but nevertheless afterward it brings forth Peaceable fruit of righteousness is that right amen listen if it don't hurt it ain't going to serve its purpose amen you know and you think about how how you easy it is to misunderstand this because you know you can think about I'll give you examples in the scripture think about David and here David is a little Shepherd boy you know a a and and and here comes uh uh you know Samuel down down there and with a horn of oil amen the prophet comes anoints David to be king of Israel David you know what you know what's amazing to me that that after David was anointed to be king of Israel David didn't go right to the throne after that great event of the prophet Samuel coming down Amen to Jesse's house and all Jesse's Sons walking before him say no he's not it and he's not a ain't you got another one yeah he's out there in the field go get him go fetch him amen somebody goes out there brings David up there the prophet Samuel anoints with o you know after all that was over with his dad just looked at I guess and just said go on back out there and tend them sheep think about that amen now he's anointed king of Israel they didn't build him a special room in the house amen his daddy didn't look at all his brothers say now you serve him and and you know make sure no hey and David ain't going to work another day in his life no he just went right back out in the field and started tending sheep again and and think about this here comes a a lion and here comes a bear and you know what a lot of people would have you know what have happened right there for a lot of people they would have said bad things just keep happening to me and I barely escaped I barely escaped the bear and I barely escaped the line and I just can't believe if God anointed me to be king of Israel why does he keep letting these bad things happen in my life I thought I was chosen of God I thought I was anointed to be the king of Israel why do he allow that Lon to come why do he allow that bear to come I tell you why because God knew there was a giant that was in front of David and God was going to use a line and he was going to use a bear that David could stand out there before that Gass and we heard the boast of that devil he can he can stand there and say you come to me with a spear and a sword but I come to you in the name of the Lord hallelujah and just like God SLE the Li and just like he deliver the Bei you will be just like them think about that tonight because David was going to the throne that's why God allowed him to face a blind and a bear and a giant because he was making a king but ain't amazing David could have easily took the attitude while I just don't understand it bad things just keep happening to me I thought God loved me think about Joseph and Joseph you know you know he he's God gives him dreams and visions and shows him that he's going to the throne and and he and you know and that his brothers is going to bow down before him and and the position that he's going to hold and all these things that God shows Joseph and when it was all said and done his brothers hated him next thing you know they they they cast him in the pit sold him into slavery robbed him of his coat amen went lied to their father amen Joseph ends up down in Egypt and just when things start getting better that's right his master's wife tells a lie on him he ends up in prison don't you think Joseph could have said I just don't get it I thought I must have misunderstood the vision I miss I must have misunderstood you know I I thought thought God had chose me to you know I I thought I was chosen of God I thought I was destined for greatness I thought even God was going to use me in a great way but it just seems like everything bad happens and it's just one thing after another and just when I get on my feet something else comes along come on church but you know what God was doing he was leading him to a throne hallelujah amen God thought when he was going in the pit he was on the way to the throne when he was sold into slavery he was going to the throne when he was cast into prison he was on his way to the throne Hallelujah and when he got there he had been through enough that he could look at his brothers at the right time and say you meant it for evil but God meant it for good Hallelujah don't fear God did this to preserve life said he said many weary and MN been pushed about all for their own good many weary and worn being pushed about all all for their own good their child training to bring them up in the admiration of God trials are worth more than silver and gold but it's written no chastisement is Pleasant for the time being see but finally when the church becomes to have this training or its training then they will become adopted Sons or place Sons to inherit into the inherit of God which shall inherit all things and be equal in powers and blessings of the Son of God Brothers Listen another place he says sons and daughters and who has the most power before God ain't this powerful brother BR said who has more Authority an angel in heaven or a son on the earth it's a son see amen cuz an angel is a servant but what are you a son and a daughter Hallelujah that's been saved by the grace of God we'll have more Authority in heaven than the Archangel that stood by his side I want just watch this because I don't know what time it is oh my Mercy but Hallelujah catch this because Paul says and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children now I want you to catch this because these Believers have become discouraged because they have forgotten am me because one reason for discouragement is because when you see no reason that God would allow difficult times to arise see you forget the principles of the scriptures that that God chastens them that he loves mean God is Desiring a family like himself see you know I think there's a lot of difficult times that comes in our lives by by that phrase we forgot you know the prodical son if I could just maybe use this for a little bit he got to the place that he forgot and and you know you know what I love about that that Parable in the scripture is that Jesus never told that that story to show the evil of the boy go read it friends go Jesus didn't tell that even brother Brown said in the message he preached prodal he said Jesus told this Parable to show us the love of the father to a wward son so when Jesus is telling the the parable of the prodical son he's not telling it to show you how evil that that boy is he's showing you amen the love of the father to a son that is lost and now just think about that because we know that you know he was Reckless and wasteful and foolish and but he but all those things caused him to forget who he was and the Bible says and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed the swine and when he had filled his belly with the husk of the swine did eat and we know what a you know to a Jew this is just a they they didn't have no dealings with pigs you you understand amen but now he's eating with the pigs amen and the Bible said when he had filled his belly with the husk of the swine amen the Bible says that he did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself when he came to himself listen friends what happened he remembered amen and what did he remember he said how many hired Servants of my father's house I tell you what he come to he remembered that he had a daddy he remembered he out of Father Hallelujah even brother Brown said he said think of the father amen that has all the wealth he has all the things that he has given me and here I am laying and dying of hunger laying in a hog pin eating slop the Bible said he came to himself and that's what the church needs today is to come to themselves and realize who is your father for sometimes we act as though we have no Heavenly Father for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church Divine Healing and salvation freedom of amen from worry and anything belongs to the church Jesus died that we would inherit all the things of God through him we're HS of the Kingdom my father is rich in houses and in lands he holds the wealth of the world in his hands that's how we are we just need to come to ourself Hallelujah and remember we got a father tonight I'll tell you what that boy's problem was he had forgot he forgot he was a son he forgot he had a father I tell you this I believe that God has got a pig pin for every prodal come on church amen and and watch amen because in that story that Daddy was going to deal with him as a son that's why he didn't send him a check every week come on church are you hearing me amen and that boys amen rebellious uh condition when he went went Wayward amen that daddy wasn't sending him a check in the mail every week to get him out of every problem that he ever had he allowed him to get all the way down in a pig pin because he knew that's my boy and I'm his daddy and he's got to remember come on church he might have to get all the way down on his back before he looks up to me but I'm going to allow the situations not because he didn't love him he did it because he did love him and it was in the big bin that that boy remembered amen that he had a father telling you that church God's got a pig pin for every prodical hey there's a lot of other people eating in that pig pin amen but none of them come home they were different come on Church you know I'm telling you the truth there's a lot of other it was a lot of other people out there in the same barroom you went to but you were a son oh I want to tell you something friends that boy was a son in his father's house he was a son when he left the father's house he was a son when he was living in ride as living he was a son when he was wasting everything he had he was a son in the barroom he was a son in the Big B he always was a son Hallelujah he was a son amen out there in the world he was a son in that Baptist Church and there's a lot of other Baptists out there and happy to be but there was something in you a deep that was calling to a deep he come to himself he remembered that he had a father oh you begin to remember I love what brother BR said because the Bible says amen remember from where thou has fallen amen repent is that right amen and brother BR would talk to take that in the church they B he said amen evidently they have forgotten something they have forgotten where they originally had come from they had forgotten amen and they had W left the word and his Purity and amen they had forgot what it was Amen to say for me to live as Christ come on they for God amen amen there when they can stand and say amen I know nothing save Jesus and him crucified come on friends they got to the place amen that it got to be about amen who was the best and who amen had the uh the biggest church and who was the the best preacher and who had their greatest gift and and they forgot of what it was just to be a Christian and love God and serve him they forgot what it was Amen to have no other motive no Alternatives ain't pushing nothing ain't trying to be nobody amen I'm just a sinner saved by the grace of God hallelujah I was nothing when he found me I still ain't nothing tonight but I'm in his hand Hallelujah that's what they have forgot and the prophet of God said they had to return first in their mind and then in reality that's a perfect example of the prodical son he had to first remember he came to himself he began to think even the servants in My Father's House are doing better than this I tell you what I'll do I'll rise Hallelujah I'm getting ready to get into it in a minute lift up them hands that hang down and strengthen the feeble knees rise up and say I'm going back hallelujah amen I might have wasted at all amen I might be a nobody I might be a backslider but I got a father tonight Hallelujah you know brother B tells a story in spiritual Amnesia he talks about that French soldier boy and remember they put them soldiers on and they was all shell shocked and and they had Amnesia and this boy didn't even know who he was had no identification he didn't know who he was or where he came from I had them all loaded up on that train they made a little stop they got off and they and that that the the man that was the captain was watching them you know the story that that boy got off that train and he started walking that man decided I'm just going to watch him a little while he walked down this little path he looked up at that water tank and turned over a little path over here brother Andrew and he started walking down and something in his mind he said there's something familiar about this he starts walking down that path and he comes over to a old house and there's a old man on the porch come running off that porch and he said my son he said they told me you was dead but I never believed it I knew you was going to come home to me amen he went out there and run and grabbed that boy and threw his arms around him and he came to himself and the prophet said just like the prodal what happened he remembered who he was I got a father I got a home oh Christian soldier of the cross I know many of you here tonight you've been Shell Shocked you've been Church hurt am mean you've been let down amen and in all that many times you'll forget who you are but I want to tell you tonight amen I let the Revelation rise in your heart and let spiritual Amnesia diminish and flee away you got a father Hallelujah and when that prodal son went back home let me tell you his daddy never treated him like a servant he went back as a servant glory to God I feel like preaching right now I tell you what when that boy went back he didn't go home with a bunch of excuses he didn't go home blaming his problems on everybody else he didn't go back and say well if y'all would have called I say if the deons would have come and visited me or you know if sister so and so wouldn't have said that I would have never been in this problem no he realized it was me the whole time I was the one that done wrong I sinned against God and you that was his attitude but brother his daddy never looked at him as a servant he never said one word about his sin he just said my son that was lost has come back home go kill the fat calf go get the best robe he dealt with him as a son I'll tell y'all I'll tell you something so powerful cuz I want to tell you if some of y'all sitting out here tonight you think you just don't know my situation all you don't know you don't know the situation of my children I just want to tell you something to encourage you I've been preaching a series in the book of Hebrews for a long long time and and I'd been i' been this you know a month or two ago I think a couple months ago and I'd been in this chapter and I'd already preached a couple several services on these verses that I just read tonight God deals with us his sons and you know how it is you ministers understand this I was thinking brother man I was thinking you need to move on you know they they going to get tired of hearing this you need to move on and I was studying ahead you know and I said man I'm want I'm moving forward and God just kept pulling me back that's right I kept going back and I was and he led me in this direction of that prodigal Cent I walked out in my office that Sunday morning one of my wife's Brothers I looked over he sit on the left side of the church that boy ain't been in a church since he was 17 years old he's almost 40 years old right now over 20 something years he never stepped foot in a church and God had laid it on my heart to deal with some of these things and I started preaching on that prodigal I looked over there and them tears just running down his face and he ain't missed a service s we got a father tonight and he deals with us as his sons I want to tell you you can't go far enough you can't hide deep enough you can't run fast enough if you belong to him listen friend Jesus said all that the father has given unto me will come unto me and of those that he's given I will lose none Hallelujah wherefore wherefore now that you have an understanding now that you've been reminded come on Friends Paul been he said you forgot that God speaks to you like children you forgot that God chastens you like Sons you forgot that God is your father and you're his children amen but but now that you've been reminded wherefore since afflictions are so beneficial to you come on church amen now that you've been reminded that the chasing of the Lord is just a further proof of his love and he's working right now all things for your good hallelujah oh listen now that you're wherefore because now you've been reminded and you got to understanding that you're a Son of God lift up the hands to hang down and strengthen your feeble knees come on church now that you've been reminded that your sons and daughters of God quit Walling around in self-pity quit feeling sorry for yourself quit letting the devil say that you're not worthy and that you're not a child of God and you'll never make the Rapture now that you got an understanding lift up the hands that hang down strengthen them feeble knees and make straight the path of your feet Hallelujah brother you get this Revelation you'll worship God Amen when you're in good days when you're in bad days if I feel good if I'm sick if I got money in the bank if there ain't no money in the bank I'm not praising God because of my condition come on church and by the way while we're right there I just tell you this we need to stop praising God because of how we feel feelings ain't got nothing to do with it come on friends and here's another one that always gets this where I lift my hands if I was just worthy let me just let you in on a secret praising him ain't got nothing to do with your worth it's got everything to do with his worth I'm not praising God cuz I'm worthy I'm praising him because he's worthy come on church and when you get a revelation in your heart hey amen if he slays me I'll trust him the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah people don't understand this but I'm going to tell you this is this is the gospel truth that's why God allows churches to go through troubles I'll give you a quote brother B said I'm paraphrasing a little bit but in the church book he said the church that ain't suffering ain't got it it ain't a God listen friends why amen why would he say things like like that why would God allow things amen don't you know even the atheists that's their biggest argument if God is God and he's such a good god which you claim to why does he allow all these things to happen but I going to tell you something there's things that that they put they blame God for that never God wasn't the author of it in this in the beginning but God does allow things to happen and he allow troubles to come into the church brother Brown said he puts bits in trouble's mouth harnesses it uses it see cuz God wants a church that's why listen I want to just say this tonight that's why God allows you to have them every now and then you going to have a slow service and every now and then you going to have them Wednesday nights that are thin and every now and then you're going to have hey you preachers you understand what I'm talking about every now and then you're going to have them Services you walk out there and you think man amen I I wish that song leader has sung two more songs it's so cold and tight in here but you know what God wants preachers that'll preach whether they there's a good feeling in the building or not God wants some men that's got enough backbone that even when it's being resented and resisted they're going to say it anyhow so God will allow the opposition because God wants some Sons God will allow them slow Services because God wants a church that ain't just going to praise him when the Revival's hot and not they're not just going to stand and say amen I know God is God when they feel it but they're going to declare whether I feel God or I don't feel God he's still God and this message is right whether there's a hundred people amen and or nobody Hallelujah wherefore now that you understand all this lift up your hand that hang down and strengthen them feeble knees Hallelujah in other words just get up and Shake That discouragement off and let's move forward in the battle tonight we got a race to run we got an enemy to defeat there's a resurrection and a Rapture to be had God don't want a bunch of lazy entitled amen weak back generation of Believers he wants some Sons and Daughters hey actually Paul is quoting an Old Testament scripture and I'm getting ready to close just as soon as I get done but but Paul is quoting an Old Testament scripture here and I think it's beautiful I Isaiah says in Isaiah 35 strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble needes say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be open and the ears of the Dead shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as a heart and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for in the wilderness shall the waters break out and the streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become as a pool and the Thirsty land and springs of water and the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reads and rushes and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of Holiness and the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though RS shall not air therein no Lon shall be there nor any ravenous Beast shall go up their own it shall not be found there amen but the redeemed shall walk there and the wring of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting Joy upon their head they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sign shall flee away Hallelujah wherefor now that you understand who you are let the redeemed of the Lord say so come on church amen you say Amen but you just don't know who I am you don't know how lost I was you don't know what I done yeah you might be that prodal you might be that shell shock Soldier but if you're a Son of God what difference does it make you got a father tonight lift up the hands that hang down strengthen the feeble knees listen as I close with this musicians come that probably said listen to this prayer he said we pray Lord that all unbelief I I wonder maybe in the first night of this meeting if we could just join our hearts with the prophet of God in this prayer we pray Lord that all un belief all doubt all frustration all that's unlike God will flee from us tonight that the Holy Ghost might have the right away in our hearts may he speak to us in a mysterious way may he speak to us in his power may he resurrect those that are spiritually dead bring back to health amen those that are sick and afflicted lift up the feeble knees and the wearied hands that are hanging down and may there be a timer rejoicing another place he's praying a prayer again he said Lord if there's sick if there's a sick body here tonight touch it heal it make it well Grant it Lord if there's a sick soul may it be healed right now let the crippled Soul be straightened out and may the feeble knees them weak hands that hung down raised up in glory and shouts to God May the Crooked paths be made straight and may there be a highway in the wilderness for our God lord we believe you're coming soon let us blast forth Thy word Lord and make a highway in the wilderness the Crooked path straight for our Lord let us blast out every denominational route let us blast out every root of bitterness let us blast out all malice and envy and strife that the true word of God might flow like rivers of Joy he said father I come with the blessings for the people I come with his spirit with his anointing with his words and they out over the people now as it was like grains of food and they received that oh God may they take root right now may Life begin to Spring May the seed begin to break open and life Life begin to raise up strength begin to come to weak bodies May sight begin to come into those blinded eyes and strengthen the feeble knees oh God may it start growing and may the Holy Ghost purging and pouring it on and on and on until one great Victorious stream of God will he heal every sick person in this building tonight

going through all the Troubles of our life but what a powerful message tonight to know that it's God that made us it's God that leads us amen how many believes that tonight that I know who I am I'm a Son of God I'm an heir of all things we wasn't just created as as as subjects but we was created as Sons ain't it wonderful how many sons of God are here how many daughters of God isn't it wonderful to be called the Sons and the daughters of God when we were lost and seemed hopeless but he redeemed us you know what it means to be redeemed it mean to be bought back mean it wouldn't mean that God
